i will def be coming here from now, the food is amazing, fast and top notch service, everyone is kind and willing to answer any questions you have. the food came out so quick, i was suprised because the quality of the food looked as if it was prepared for much longer. kathy personally took us to our table and treated us very nicely. i recommend anyone looking to try asian cusine to go eat your hearts aways here! 

as far as the food i couldnt express how tasty and satisfying it was. i had the leftovers the next day and it was just as good. must go!
