We had three dishes between three people: pork belly, a spicy fish dish, and eggplants. The dishes came out extremely fast, less than 5 minutes after we put the order in, which was surprising. It makes you wonder about how they do their cooking; maybe they cook a large amount at a time, and then reheat things and serve it? At least with the eggplants, that is a possibility. The eggplants were really hot temperature-wise, but if you sample the sauce, it's room temperature. Also, once the taste of the sauce has left your mouth and you're left with the eggplant, there's no flavor anymore. It didn't seem like the eggplants were actually cooked with the sauce to let the flavor seep in. More like they cooked the eggplants, then poured sauce over it, then served it.

Aside from the eggplant, the spicy fish and the pork belly were pretty good. Pork belly always tastes good, just watch out for the jalapeno peppers that they serve with the pork as they are hot. I love the sauce for the spicy fish, I actually used it to dip the eggplants in.
