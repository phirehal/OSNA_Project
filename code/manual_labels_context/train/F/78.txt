Ordered from here for lunch via door dash! First, the lunch specials are such a steal. $6.50 for a rice dish with a side of egg drop soup! I work in FiDi, where lunch options are pretty average to mediocre, so I am so glad that I found a tasty and cheap option. 

Vegetarians, order the mapo tofu. Though this didn't taste like the traditional mapo tofu, I was impressed with the sweeter spicy taste. It was a pleasant surprise for my taste buds. Also, the quality of the food is fantastic, not greasy like most Chinese take-outs.
