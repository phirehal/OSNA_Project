Great Shanghai soup dumplings! The mapo tofu, however, came out a bit strange. It was served over rice and barely had any sauce. The sauce it did have was not spicy (having traveled through China, I like my mapo HOT). It came with a fried egg on top, which was a bit overdone. Overall, clean and friendly service / ambiance!
