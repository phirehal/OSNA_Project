Soup dumplings.

Go in, get seated, take the menu the hostess gives you, throw it out the window, ignore the shocked looked you'll most likely get, and demand two orders of the soup dumplings aka "xialongbao" aka "XLB." 

If you're by yourself, yes, consume it all. If you're with a friend, tell them to order their own and proceed to consume it all.

If only I lived in NY. Here in MD we have Bob's Shanghai, which is kind of like Joe's Shanghai's third cousin twice removed. Good but not as delicious. Joe's gets the skin just right and the broth in the dumpling is so tasty. Probably some of the best XLB's I've ever had.
