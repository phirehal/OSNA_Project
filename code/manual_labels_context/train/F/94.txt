#I went for the lunch special and I know I have to be careful with the hot spicy Szechuan food for my butt's sake. I usually like to get fish with #chili sauce, but played it safe and got the Fish Fillet with Pinenuts in Sweet Vinegar Sauce $12.75 with #Hot and Sour Soup. The fish was pretty good and not spicy. There was a ton of fish in that dish, even for a #lunch special.

Then next to me, there was a #family that got an awesome deep red spicy looking hot pot. That looked awesome. I wonder if what their butt thought of it though. Probably #worth it.
