Note to self: don't trust reviews left by a bunch of white hipster gentrifiers. The food here is undoubtedly overrated. I'm upset that I shelled out more than twenty dollars for it. I got the soup dumpling, sweet and sour pork ribs and sweet and sour soup. The soup dumpling was cold and I agree with other reveiwer , it's much worse the Joe's Shanghai. The sweet and sour pork rib has a lot of fat in it. Sweet and sour soup taste like a lot of corn stretch.
go for food somewhere else as the food here is extremely underwhelming and appeals to people who don't know good food.
