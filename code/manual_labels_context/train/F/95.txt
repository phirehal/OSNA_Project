This place has great sichuan food. The restaurant is on the smaller side but we had no problem getting a table for two. 

Hot tea was complementary (as it should be). The menu is large and I recommend sticking with the sichuan specialties.  Anything labeled with "sichuan peppercorn" has a Mala flavor (a distinct mouth numbing almost bitter spice) -  it's delicious. 

We ordered the sichuan pickled vegetable appetizer, smoked tea duck and fish with tofu and chilis. 

The pickles came first.  These weren't really pickles,  but carrots,  celery,  turnips and chestnuts on oil with Mala peppers.  They were definitely good but not extraordinary. If we come back,  we'll try the cucumber salad instead. 

The standout by far was the duck.  It was fatty,  crispy and had that distinct camphor smoked tea flavor we love.  Watch out for bones when ordering this dish,  they hack the duck apart  so there are many little bone pieces. 

The fish and tofu dish was great too however some of the fish pieces had too much corn starch and the texture came through.  The tofu was pre-wired so it had a chewy outside and soft inside. The dish was loaded with ginger and scallions. 

Nothing was too salty which was great given the parching effect that many Chinese meals tend to have. 
Service wasn't great but the food made up for it.
