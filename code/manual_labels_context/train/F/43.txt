Surprised to see so many reviews already considering that they've only been open for a week. To be honest I expected a long wait, bad food and disorganization since YT is so new. But these reviews well deserved. They're running a pretty smooth operation as far as I can see. Prices were affordable and it took less than five minutes to receive my order. The food? I was pleasantly surprised by both the authenticity and quality. I couldn't be happier to have a proper Asian joint in Downtown Brooklyn. Welcome to the 'hood, Yaso Tangbao.
