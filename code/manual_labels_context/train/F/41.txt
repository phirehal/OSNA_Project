Big fan of Soup Dumplings and other similar fare, this wasn't anything great. The curry chicken in pan fried noodles was tasty but meager portions. For $10 and mostly vegetables, next time I'll pass.
The soup dumplings were nothing special. They are heavy on the sesame oil. With Chinatown a mile away, spend the extra 10 minutes on the subway or a car and go to one of the local spots on Pell Street
