I've never had soup dumplings like the ones they serve here before. There was so much soup! The dumplings skin were not too too, not too thin. But I think they were thin enough for you to see the soup inside but yet did not break when you go to pick one up with the tongs provided. 

They have two types of soup dumplings crab and pork. I've never had crab dumplings before so I thought that was a very interesting meat to use. The soup from the dumplings definitely tasted like crab. I couldn't really taste the crab in the actual meat (although my friend did) but I was okay with that because the flavor came through in the soup. 

I also tried the snow pea leaves. Delish! It was cooked very simply with just some oil and garlic. 

The rice cakes were good too. The rice cakes were not over cooked and it was not too greasy. The ratio of vegetable, meat, and rice cake was perfect. 

I'd definitely order everything I tried again and this is definitely on my list of places to go the next time I'm in New York.
