I've been here and enjoyed the food a number of times in the past, and am happy to report that per my last visit a few days ago the food is still up to par.  Recently we split the chicken & spinach rice and the Veggie Trio w/ Spicy Garlic sauce.  We also shared the spicy cucumber salad and boy am I in love with the Szechuan pepper in that dish.  My lips were all a tingle!  In the past we've also had the cumin lamb and the mapo tofu which was very good.  This is a go-to for reliably good Chinese food.
