As a huge fan of Szechuan food, I go here for lunch 1-2 times a week. Have had almost everything on the menu! 

The best meal is the prawns with minced pork. My second favorite is the double cooked pork, which is basically bacon. Third favorite are the Kung Pao dishes.

Be warned that the spicy food is actually spicy.

Bon Appetite!
