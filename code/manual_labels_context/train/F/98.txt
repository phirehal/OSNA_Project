I feel like I've merely scratched the surface with this place.  Had a great array of items here last week, including the Dan Dan Noodles, soup dumplings, and scallops in garlic sauce.  Everything had great flavor and was brought out promptly.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, and was sure to warn us that soup dumplings would take about 20 mins (they seemed to come quicker, but always good for a heads-up).  
Luckily, this a mere 5 streets from my office, so I think I'll be spending more time here investigating further items on their menu. 
We also spoke to 2 asian gentlemen next to us that was discussing on the spicy beef dishes that they ordered and how it's usually prepared.  Very interesting meal, for so many reasons.  Will be back!
