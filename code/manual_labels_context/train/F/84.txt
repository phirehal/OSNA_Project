Only ate "appetizers" here, so take this with a grain of salt.

Pork xiao long bao was pretty good - I'd say comparable to joe's shanghai. 
pork and crab- couldn't taste the crab.

scallion pancakes were not very good - dense and way too oily. 

can't say much about the actual entrees.

Don't get me wrong. The xiao long bao is good. I'd come here over Joe's Shanghai for soup dumplings because then you don't have to wait as long, but soup dumplings are just as satisfying if not better, since last time I went to Joe's I thought theirs were getting super salty.
