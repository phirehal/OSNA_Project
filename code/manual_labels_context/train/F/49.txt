I am a big fan of shanghainese food and really want to love this place but disappointed after my first try today. I waited about 5 minutes on line not knowing what they have until I got to the cashier and quickly read through a one page menu printed on a plain A4 paper. Their hot and sour soup is $4 served cold in a tiny paper bowl next to the cashier and it's $8 for 6 cold, non-juicy and easily break dumplings...I would rather take a one stop train ride to Chinatown.
