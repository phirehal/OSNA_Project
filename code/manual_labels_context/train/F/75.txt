I thought this place was going to be great because of the rave reviews of the soup dumplings. I thought it was gonna be another nirvana, thin skin, great soup inside, great flavor.

Dumplings had thick, like thick skin. Soup was ok, got cold really fast somehow.

Would probably not come back again
