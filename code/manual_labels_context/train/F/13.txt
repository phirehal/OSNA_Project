Comparable prices to Chinatown, definitely fills the hole of authentic chinese food in the area! Xiaolong bao are great, juicy, though just a little bit more skin at the top than I'm used to. Garlic cucumbers are nice, salty, and vinegary, (almost) just as good as the ones my shanghainese dad made at home!

Update: just added the sweet and sour pork ribs and a bowl of rice to my lunch, ribs are great! Rice is, well, good ol' rice.
