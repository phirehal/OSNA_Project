Ever since I learned about this new Shanghai dumpling house, I've been wanting to go. Went there to get lunch on a Saturday, and surprisingly the restaurant wasn't too crowded. For me and my cousin, we got 2 orders of soup dumplings and old fashioned tomato soup, one cucumber appetizer, one meatball noodle soup and the wine chicken. The soup dumplings were soo soooo good although honestly the highlight for me was the tomato soup and meatball noodle. The tomato soup has just enough sourness and sweetness and the meatballs were just over the top, so soft and juicy. Having tried couple other soup dumpling places in ny and Boston, i'd say Oh YEAH, this is prob one of my best experiences so far. If you'r ever craving for some yum Chinese quick bites, THIS is the place to go.
