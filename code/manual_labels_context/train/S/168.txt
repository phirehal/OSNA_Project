Our server BLEW. The restaurant is small enough that I can see who got seated after we did etc.  Umm..why did it take 15 min for the server to come over, got irritated when we asked her questions, and then took the order from two other tables (who were seated after us) before us?  Yeah...not sure either.

3. It was so bad we left before finishing our meal.  

For me, service is a huge part of the whole overall experience.  I understand when you are busy, and I will be patient, so long as you are courteous and somewhat attentive.  When service is this bad, it makes my blood boil.  My blood now? Boiling.
