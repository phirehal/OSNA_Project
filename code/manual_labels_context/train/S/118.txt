Let me start off by saying that the food at this establishment is excellent. The only thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review was the poor service. Our waiter kept all of this interactions with us as minimal as possible - never smiling or even introducing himself. He then dropped the check on the table without saying a word. Not sure if he was just having a bad day, but his lackluster service was a bit of a downer on the entire experience.
