
Never in my life have I waited so long to order a drink and food.  Not only that, but the service was simply snobby.  This improved at the bar, the guy serving water was really nice and a breath of fresh air to this establishment, but everyone else was less than disappointing if there is such a thing.  Being from San Francisco and moving to New York, I don't really think that these folks have a leg to stand on and whatever they think they have..well let's just say this, you should always be nice to everyone.  I feel like this establishment has forgotten this essential fact of service.
