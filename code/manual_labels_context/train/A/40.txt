You would think for a new place on the block, that this place would try to please all your needs. Unfortunately that is not the case. I came into the restaurant to get a seat 10 mins before they closed after calling ahead and they wouldn't seat us. Totally bullshit. When you close at 10, you close at 10 and not 10 mins before. I hope the manager reads this and tells his staff to not leave the job early. Was so turned off will not go back to try it. Cutting corners isn't the way to do business in NYC. There's a million other places to try. Take note!
