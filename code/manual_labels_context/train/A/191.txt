This review is for the ambiance. We were in Taxim for about 20 minutes. We arrived, and were immediately directed to table adjacent to 6 extremely loud bros. There were at least 20 empty tables in (relatively) quieter areas, so we helped ourselves to a more secluded table. 

While sitting at our table, we heard a (1) baby screaming a lot, (2) very loud music, and (3) obnoxiously loud laughing at something that was presumably not that funny. It was a cross between an echo chamber and an airport terminal from hell (assuming ORD isn't actually, you know, hell). 

After 20mins of this without much activity from the wait staff, we decided to give up and go to Whole Foods instead. That was a good choice.
