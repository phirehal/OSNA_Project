It's hard to find good Indian food in the city and I usually find myself going out to the suburbs for it. Turns out India House was better than I expected, albeit definitely more on the expensive end. 

Favorites: 
- Mango lassi - Super delicious, creamy, and tastes like real mangoes. Just a warning that my drink was slightly sour which I enjoyed because it meshed with the sweetness of the mangos.
- Onion Bahji Appetizer - Loved the three sauces it comes with, they were perfect dipping compliments to the fried vegetables.  
- Chicken Makhani - Butter chicken in a tomato based sauce. Great spices, a lot of chicken - most pieces were tender though there were a few that seemed more dry.

Skippable:
- I wasn't a fan of the garlic naan which is sad because I love garlic naan. It's a must-get for me at every Indian restaurant. This one here just wasn't fluffy :( and was rather stiff. 

The lunch buffet seems like a great option and if I were to come back, it would be for that! Dinner can add up to be way pricey!
