For dinner we ordered Chicken Haryali Tikka and Dal Makhani which are our favorite dishes to order when going out for Indian food. The Chicken Hariyali did not taste like it had been marinated because it was lacking a lot of flavor that we have come to expect with this dish. It also came with carrots which are odd because whenever we had the dish before it came with bell peppers (might I say much better, but probably more expensive for the restaurant). And then there was the Dal Makhani.. It was good but it did not have kidney beans like it is supposed to (it just had urad dal)Overall, it was far from authentic and way over-priced. Don't go here if you actually like Indian food.
