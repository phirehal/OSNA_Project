Nope.. Not the place you want to go if you're looking for good Indian food.

Ordered :
Paneer pakoda :Meh
salt lassi - was a little too sour with not enough flavor
Alloo paratha : uncooked. Not enough potato stuffing
Palak paneer : just the lamest way of making this dish. You don't put chopped spinach in your pre-prepared curry gravy!! That is not how this dish is cooked.
Dal Tadka : Saltless

Total fail
