The best Italian I've ever had. I feel like that's all the recommendation this place really needs, but for those of you who need more than that, here's some more info: I always ask for the waiter's recommendation whenever I try a new restaurant, and was recommended either the lasagna or the lobster pasta. He claimed the lasagna was worth making a trip for, and I'm glad to say he was right. My friend got the lasagna since I'm not really a big lasagna fan, and we both agreed it was probably the best lasagna either of us have ever tried. I got the lobster pasta, which came in a delicious cream sauce. It was good enough that my friend kept sneaking little tastes of sauce off my plate the entire meal. My other friend got the seafood pasta, which he asked to be made spicy. It wasn't actually spicy, but still very well executed. The grilled calamari was good enough that my friend wanted to order a second one after finishing the first one. Good thing we stopped him because the portion sizes were generous for our entrees and we probably wouldn't have finished it. I normally never choose tiramisu, but we decided to split one between the three of us for dessert. Given how delicious the rest of the meal was, we didn't want to pass up on dessert even though we were full. This was a good one. It's very rare to find a restaurant that's capable of killing it in on appetizers, entrees, and dessert. 5 well deserved stars for this restaurant for delivering such consistently good food. On top of this, this place is a good value for your money. Between the check in offer and the voucher, this place became a very affordable nice restaurant.
