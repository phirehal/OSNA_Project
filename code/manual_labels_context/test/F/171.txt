I was very disappointed,  I had ;
1) pork shoulder= bland, beans undercooked, lack of acidity in tomatillo broth.
2) whipped brandade= unimaginative, looked broken as if cod and potato separated.
3) hanger steak= meh
4) chicken dish = ok
5) chorizo dates= good
6) desserts were as imaginative as if a six year old had created them and plated by a two year old. Horrible shards of chocolate and brittle.  Chocolate crepe, nutella and mascarpone.  No textural difference, no wow.
