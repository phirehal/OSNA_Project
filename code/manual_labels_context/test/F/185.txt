DO NOT GO HERE!!! It is WAY overpriced, and the food is average at best. The cheese was good, but nothing spectacular. You can get better cheese at Whole Foods.  The mushroom appetizer was greasy, very little flavor.  The tagliatelle bolognese was disgusting! Bolognese sauce should be dark red with a very slight brown tint from the meat, have carrots and, maybe, a little nutmeg. This was fried chop meat with some kind of clear gel. The pasta itself was good. Then the hanger steak was flavorless, overcooked on the outside, and was tough; it was like eating leather. The waiter suggested we order a secondo because the past course would be too small. Actually, the portion size for the pasta would have been just right, but then again, I would have been angry to just have that dog food of a dish.  We saw chicken on the other table, and it looked like a dry burnt piece of meat. The steak come with potatoes and this ricotta onion dip. The potatoes were completely flavorless, dry and over cooked. The potatoes reminded me of hash fries at a diner, but I am sure one could get better potatoes at the diner. The deserts were average at best. The pumpkin tiramisu was ok, the chocolate dish with the hazelnut was average - absolutely pedestrian, and the olive oil cake was subpar and stale.
