Unimpressive.  RPM Italian is better.

The porter rolls were the best part of the meal with the rosemary butter.  Otherwise, nothing too impressive.  The biggest disappointment was the chocolate souffle. Everyone ordered it because it sounded delicious, but were sorely disappointed when we were served what is basically warm chocolate soup.
