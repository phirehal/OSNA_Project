One star review for the very disorganized and chaotic ambience. The lighting is so dim I thought I was at a candle light supper. Lousy sorority/frat crowd and stupid screaming babies. Would not recommend for any Californian looking for a tasty greek dinner and a refined night out.  The last thing I saw as we left the place was a very ill mannered toddler trying to enter the kitchen area...
