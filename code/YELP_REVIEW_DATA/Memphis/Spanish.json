From the moment I stepped on, it was apparent that customer service is supposed to be at the forefront of the minds of the staff. Someone ged the door open for me, asked how my day was, and immediately led me to a nice booth even though I was eating alone. From there my waiter (Ryan Herd, I learned from my receipt), immediately came to get my drink order, then again to ask if I wanted an appetizer or salad to start. I opted-out. I explained that I hadn't been to this restaurant in quite some time and that I may need some help choosing my meal. Ryan was more than happy to go through the ingredients and preparations of the menu items I was interested in. With his help, I finally decided on the veggie burger. It was fantastic!!! It actually takes the cake as my new favorite veggie burger (followed by the oat burger at Otherlands). The thick, juicy burger was oat based and was comprised of a whole host of other veggies including beets (BEETS!!!!). It came with lettuce, cheese, red onion, tomato, and pickle on a delicious toasted bun. I chose broccoli (which came sprinkled with parmesan! Yum!) as my side. I finished held my meal, then got the rest wrapped to go. I decided to follow this up with the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was the special desert of the day. It was absolutely perfect. It was creamy and decadent, filled with vanilla beans, and topped with that perfectly crisp sugar crust that Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is known for. \u00a0Then they put a dollop of whipped cream on top with berries and mint. It was a huge and heavenly; I went to bed dreaming of having it again. Other things to note: My waiter was so attentive. I can't remember a moment that my water glass had less than a sip missing from it. My mom has gone with a group of friends and had the same waiter. She had nothing but high praise for him! Other people brought out my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and answered questions I had with a smile! I really enjoyed the customer service and the food.

Pay $3 for a 3 oz pour instead.The owner of the bar, who calls herself the \"Fairy Wine Mother,\" is the sweetest woman. She welcomed 22 of us with open arms. Her small staff was able to handle the big group of us without coming off as overwhelmed or annoyed. They were very gracious, knowledgeable, and helpful. We had a fabulous time wining, dining, and mingling. The environment of the restaurant is also charming. You feel welcomed and valued from the second you walk in the door to the time you walk out. The food is on the expensive side, but if you splurge and try it out, you'll realize that it's worth every penny. As a self-proclaimed \"cheapskate,\" I would pay for the picnic basket, the butter-poached lobster, and whatever that amazing apple-cake-something dessert was all over again.

We have been wanting to stop by for some time, and finally decided to take my Mom there for her birthday. She absolutely loved it! From the moment you walk through the door, the gentlemen kick into gear and explain how it works. You can start a tab, which is recommended, but be careful, the wine adds up quick! You receive a smart card and you put it into the machine of your choice (bold red, medium red, white, etc) then you select the wine of your choice and either 2, 4, or 6 oz. The prices are listed accordingly, and the least expensive I saw was for $3.50 for a 2 oz. That being said, the wine is delicious and it's fun to mix and match as you go. We also ordered the 'firm' cheese plate which was a great pairing, then she had the Butter Poached Lobster which she has now declared her favorite meal. It was very good and had a very rich, creamy sauce. Since it was her birthday, she received a slice of decadent chocolate cake, but the staff highly recommend the Fried Pound Cake, which she will probably try next visit.We were told the menu may change up a bit from time to time, so they recommend calling ahead if interested in anything in particular on the food menu.Greencork is run by a local family, owned by a Ms Robin, whom we met as we were leaving. Her son explained many of the wines to us while we browsed and her daughter is the chef. They were all very friendly and we should all strive to support local family-owned businesses.

Oh, wait. \u00a0I should explain the concept first: Greencork is Memphis' first self-serve wine bar. \u00a0You stop at the front check-in area and get a wine card. Wine dispensers line the walls with description cards. \u00a0You slide your card in the machine and press one of three different ounce sizes of your choice. The amount you pay for each glass depends upon the size of your drink. They have 32 different wines nightly. \u00a0Yes!ATMOSPHERE:It's a casual and cozy place where you can have a romantic beef short rib dinner and wine by the fireplace or meet a group of gal pals to nosh on wine, cheese, grapes, olives and French bread over gossip. \u00a0Kidding. \u00a0I'd NEVER gossip about ANYTHING!The restaurant can serve as a picnic at a table. \u00a0There's even a picnic basket item on the menu. I suggest, if you're going to Levitt Shell or a Botanic Garden concert, that you get the Premium Picnic Basket to-go. You can also sit at the bar and watch the Grizzlies win the playoffs (fingers crossed).They have what they call \"Test Kitchen Tuesdays,\" when you sample FREE potential future menu items that could be put on the menu depending on how diners like the test dish. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is ROBIN, A.K.A. \"Your Fairy \u00a0Wine Mother.\"She is actually the owner and literally makes you feel like you're eating and drinking at a friend's house.

The whole self-serve concept is fun and different. While they do have a full bar as well I stuck with the wine this time and I did find one I really liked. They tell you the flavors to expect and the region of the wine so it's not too much of a mystery. Also you can get it in 2oz if you aren't sure about getting a bigger glass of it. I think that's my favorite part! Customer service here isn't lacking either, even though they don't have to serve you as much they are still very friendly and sociable.

Very original idea and certainly not something you see every day which is why it's the perfect place to check out when you feel the need to try something new. Would make an excellent choice for date night. But be warned, it is a little pricy. You have options to choose from 2oz, 4oz, or 6oz wine pours. The wines vary in price depending on the quality. But they had wines from all over the world which turned our night into an adventure. We ended up going with a 2oz pour (varies in price from $3 to $9) and trying different types of wine. They also served some really good looking cheese platters and desserts. The lady who owns the place is very sweet. She called herself our \"fairy wine mother\" which was adorable. And she told us that they usually test out new menu items on Tuesday afternoon (for free!). The interior decor of the restaurant was also gorgeous and a little on the fancy side so dress \u00a0accordingly.

Home for the holidays, I arranged to meet a group of girlfriends at the Cooper-Young wine bar. (One point for the chance to make a reservation!)Like a YoLo for vino, Greencork bills itself as a self-serve wine-on-tap wine bar. With the swipe of a Greencork card, we could sample two-, four- or six-ounce pours of fine and finer wines that ranged from $3.50 to $20 for a two-ounce try. At the end of the night, we were charged for all the pours associated with our card. Brilliant!Although Greencork's wine selection could certainly stand alone, I'd recommend my dinner dish, as well: Diviiiiine Butter-Poached Lobster atop fresh scallion johnnycakes and served with semi-sweet lime butter. (I wasn't as impressed with my friends' gnocchi in a one-note tomato sauce.) And of course, who could resist a shared slice of Fried Pound Cake?!Since I'm merely a wino in training, I wish I could've learned more about wine pairings!

The atmosphere like the other Yelpers have said is very cozy and and the wine stations are setup throughout the restaurant so you don't have to deal with long lines. They're split up by types of wines, like \"Bold Reds\", \"Crisp Whites,\" etc, and they rotate the wines out intermittently so you can have plenty to taste. Upon entering for the wine tasting, they take your credit card and hand you another card that gives you access to the wines. Everything will get charged directly to your card, so hold on to your access card! This process makes the self-service fool-proof. You can also decide if you want 2 ounces, 4 ounces, or 8 ounces. The food was also good. We had the drunken figs, coconut shrimp, and lamb sandwich. All of them were delicious. The lamb sandwich could have used a little extra heat, but very good otherwise. I was disappointed that we didn't get an itemized receipt at the end, it's kind of hard to remember every tasting you just did. The servers were a little quirky and really talkative, which was fine because we were there to have fun. But at times we were wondering why they wouldn't leave us alone. There is that fine line after all of being friendly and overly friendly.I would definitely go back again."], ["Amanda E.", "I love this place! I met up with a friend on a Tuesday and there were about 5 tables of people and no wait to fill my card. Thanks to the reviews here I let the hostess know I knew what to do and handed her $20, they also have an option to hold your credit card and ring you out at the end for those wanting the exact amount. There are four wine dispensing machines with eight wines each - 2 whites and 2 reds although one of the whites has several ros\u00e9s. I was able to try four different 2oz pours and spent $15.50 on wine. They do have beer and cocktails available and the cocktails sounded amazing. Tuesdays are taste kitchen days so with a minimum spend of $15 you get a free sample of what the kitchen is trying out - which was half of a chicken panini, very good. We got the picnic basket and it was great! I wish my phone hasn't died so I could take a picture as it was beautifully displayed. A nice variety of cheeses, meats and accompaniments. They have a mixture of high and low tables as well as a fireplace seating area, a small bar and a couch seating area. Very nice ambience! The owner came to talk to us and she was very nice, as is the staff. She was great to tell us about some of her favorite wines. The wines change out often so going back will always be a new experience. If you are eating be prepared to spend at least $25 per person for food and wine but you could easily spend $40 or more per person so this does have the potential to be a pricey night out.

The atmosphere is really cozy and nice for small groups. There is a mixture of seating; tall tables, short tables and chairs by the fireplace and off in a corner. The seating is limited so if your party is larger than 2-3, I'd say make reservations. The owner/\"Fairy Wine Mother\" always makes her way around to greet guests at their tables and ask about their experience thus far. The waiters and the owner's son are very attentive, checking in and clearing empty wine glasses off of the table regularly. You can watch whatever popular sporting event on the tv over the bar, especially a Grizzlies game. The food and wine are amazing!

I adore the concept (self-serve wine...whhhhaaaat), I am obsessed with Cooper-Young, and the staff is friendly -\u00a0makings of a complete win.

It takes a good 10 minutes for them to explain the set-up and if you walk-in behind a group that is just getting started...you're looking at quite a wait before you get your glass of wine. \"Ain't nobody got time for that!\" I like to walk-in to a place and get my alcohol ASAP. Plus, how much do you load on the card? If you load too much you have to come back and use it...and you'll probably never hit it just right. And if you don't load enough, you have to go back to the front counter. It is just exasperating. And then the cheese plate...don't even get me started on the cheese plate. There are 4 cheese on the plate, 2 of which have nuts in them...like those disgusting cheese nut balls. 1. If they have nuts IN the cheese, I think they should warn their patrons on the menu. 2. It is gross cheese. 3. I live for cheese plates so I was pretty disappointed. It really is a great idea but it is lacking...mostly with the loading of the card. But I was also didn't enjoy their wine selection that much either. I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm hoping they'll fix a few things. It has the potential to be a baller place.

The sunroof was back, the radio was turned up, and I was only 10 minutes late meeting everyone. It was a good day! This is not a place I would have just passed and thought to stop in. Partially because parking is in the rear of the building off of New Orleans St. and I would have been aggravated that I couldn't find a place to park, and gone somewhere else. By the way - \"thank you\" to the nice man I accidentally and unknowingly blocked in a private parking space for not having my car towed... Don't park in front of the restaurant people!When I walked in, no one was there yet for the UYE. \u00a0I just assumed that Veronica had told me to be there 30 minutes early hoping I would make it on time. That wasn't the case, everyone else was running late too. That was cool because I got a chance to look over the menu and take in the atmosphere a little. The inside of the restaurant is painted a somewhat bright colors with pictures of famous Venezuelans \u00a0covering the walls. The TVs are on Latino stations. \u00a0The comfy booths are upholstered in a trendy floral fabric. \u00a0There's also a little patio in the front that I can't wait to try out. They definitely get an A for the atmosphere. As soon as everyone else got there, we ordered our food. \u00a0Everything on the menu looked unusual and interesting. I'd really like to try it all, and I plan to do just that over several trips. \u00a0I started with the fried cheese sticks. \u00a0They were different from typical cheese sticks. \u00a0I'm not positive what kind if white cheese they use, but they are wrapped in dough and fried. They came with this great garlic cream sauce which is indescribable. When it came time to order an entree, I was a bit indecisive because everything on the menu looked and sounded so good. \u00a0I asked the sweet little waiter to just bring me his favorite thing off the menu. He brought two tostones - one with shredded chicken and one with shredded beef. They were both scrumptious! \u00a0I have to say that even though I'm a lover of chicken, I liked the beef tostone better. They were served on plantains, rather than bread, and topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and some sort of sweet slaw. I quickly scarfed mine down and made a happy plate! I even got a to-go order to take home to my son and he loved them. He has asked me several times to take him to there for dinner. \u00a0He's a little food connoisseur in the making. The service was great! \u00a0They little guy taking care of our table reminded me so much of my son that I wanted to hug his neck. (Spence thinks he's too big to hug his mamma now.) Don't worry, I didn't hug the waiter. That would have been a little creepy for the poor kid, and everyone else at my table for that matter. He was attentive and very helpful with suggestions when we had questions about the menu. I got the feeling this is a family owned and operated business. \u00a0The staff was very warm and personable. They give free salsa lessons on Friday nights. I'm thinking I should get in on that if anyone wants to tag along. I'm not exactly graceful or coordinated, but booze helps me think I am. Let's hope it's BYOB salsa dancing. I'm sure it will look like a Saturday Night Live skit of Dancing With The Stars, but in my head, it will be smokin hot. \u00a0My second visit was with my husband and other son. We had the shrimp tostones for an appetizer, and they were addicting. I had the DePabellon, hubby had the tostones, and the boy had a Venezuelan hamburger. We left with happy tummies. \u00a0Thank you Yelpers for turning me on to this cool little spot! \u00a0Can't wait to go back again and again!"], ["Elio R.", "Food is OK but not really 100% Venezuelan. The place was really clean and service was goog. Food is a little overpriced. $10 for an \"arepa\" when in Miami is $6. Nothing special, I don't think I'll be back."], ["Leo B.", "We live in Collierville, so this place is quite a hike. \u00a0The first time we tried to go we went on the wrong day and they were closed, and from the street it looked like well, not much. \u00a0Fortunately my wife forced me to try and go again. \u00a0This time they were open, and we were forced to find the ample parking at the rear of the building.In a place like Miami this would be a solid 4-star location. \u00a0In Memphis this is a 10 star option. \u00a0This is food you cannot get anywhere else in memphis, and it is very, very good. \u00a0We went with a group and got almost everything on the menu across the group, and there were no disappointments.I wish we lived closer, we would go more often."], ["Lauren W.", "SO GOOODDDDI dropped in to get some of the vegetarian tostones for take out.The vegetarian tostones are like two little sandwiches with the fried plantains as buns. The main filling is made of black beans, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. There was also lettuce, tomato, avocado, and some sort of aioli.First of all, the aroma was the absolute best. It took all of my willpower to not pull over after a minute because the food made the whole car smell delicious.And the wait was well worth it because the tostones tasted just as good as they smelled. The portion size was good for the price. I ate a little too much because I was way too into the food, but that's my fault."], ["Reggie W.", "Went here for the first time tonight. The food and service were good! I enjoyed the black beans and rice with the slow cooked beef. Great flavor and the plantain chips were awesome.My wife enjoyed the beef arepa. We will go back again the food and service are great reasons to go again. Great place to enjoy a relaxing evening."], ["Andy S.", "So... the other day, my dinner crew was going to a new restaurant that had a super long wait, so we made the change to try out Arepa and Salsa. \u00a0I had been wanting to try them for a while, but for some reason I hadn't. \u00a0This was right before Christmas, and they ended up having a Christmas special. \u00a0They had a typical Christmas Venezuelan meal. \u00a0Naturally, I had to order that. \u00a0I also had an order of their UFO's, which is basically fried cheese. \u00a0It was ok. \u00a0Another member of our crew ordered the tostones cups. \u00a0These were great. \u00a0Their were several different ones each with a different meat. \u00a0Another member ordered the empanadas which were also very good. \u00a0Now, back to that Christmas meal. \u00a0It was very tasty, but also unique. \u00a0I had never had some of the items quite like they were prepared. \u00a0The main dish was called Hallacas. \u00a0This was kind of like a tamale but it wasn't in a husk when it was served. \u00a0It had a variety of meats, raisins, and olives in a maize type substance. \u00a0It was tasty. \u00a0I wish it had been a little warmer. \u00a0It also had a pan de jamon. \u00a0It was like a mini sandwich that had ham, raisins and olives in a pastry type bread. \u00a0There was also a cup of chicken salad. \u00a0It was very heavy on the potatoes. \u00a0So, I googled the information after the meal and that is really what they eat. \u00a0It was different, but in a good way. \u00a0I need to go back and try an arepa. \u00a0I recommend this place!!"], ["Okwe O.", "The Tostones are excellent!! A perfectly fried plantain bun nicely compliments the meat, lettuce, avocado, and house salsa inside the sandwich. I had the shredded chicken the first time, but I had to come here again to try the shredded beef. Definitely wasn't disappointed! \u00a0I think my fav is the shredded beef, but they are both delicious. You can certainly try both since your order comes with 2 sandwiches. Service is.. meh...but they did have some friendly staff. The food gets 5 stars. The only real downfall is that they don't have a location in Texas!"], ["Husni E.", "First time eating at a Venezuelan restaurant....Arepa and Salsa was a good introduction I think! \u00a0Lets explain the 4 not 5 stars...service was great but slow especially since get weren't really busy! So it's really a 4.25! Can't wait until Yelp goes metric!!!Now the food, I had the tostones cups for the appetizer, it had chicken beef and shrimp: it was a bite-sized piece of heaven. \u00a0For my main meal I had the De Pabell\u00f3n Arepa with beef and a side of their spiral chips...the food was very flavorful and filling, only issue was that the bottom half was soggy. \u00a0Again, the negatives were not unfixable so I'll definitely be coming back for more...gotta try the Tostones!!!"], ["Neal C.", "Man I wanted to love this place. Fills a totally unserved niche for Latin in Memphis, great service (really friendly and accommodating), unique and authentic atmosphere, etc. Unfortunately, the food just lacked distinct flavor. Cachapas had a decent sweetness combined with the salty pork and mozzarella but it had nothing excellent about it. The arepas were very subpar: not crispy at all on the exterior, and had less than three ounces of meat compared to gobs of mayonnaise-y sauce. Tostones were likely our favorite, as the fried plantain chips provide a unique addition to the baked beans and meat within, but still don't warrant another trip."], ["Manuel Z.", "Great food and nice service. Dishes are served with a very nice presentation. I had the arepas, which are similar to a pita sandwich, but the bread is corn. The dish was served with potato chips (not sure if home made though). The second time I visited I had the shredded beef cachapa, it looks like a crepe, but it is 10 times better. Lots of cheese in it. My wife had the pork tostones, which are two small plantain patties forming a sandwich. Very good, but loaded with a creamy sauce that can get messy :) Definitely recommend this restaurant."], ["Prashant M.", "I went there after reading such good reviews. Food was ok. Not to my taste though.The server I got was either lazy or not interested in working. I finished my ice tea and have to literally tell her for another one 10 min. after my glass was emptied. I couldn't do it again since I \u00a0don't want to be demanding and had to leave thirsty. It may be that I went there in the servers bad day. The UFO was crunchy but flavorless even with the dipping sauce. I ordered vegetarian arepa. The sausage was good and so the vegetables in it (black beans, mushroom, lettuce) \u00a0but the flour bread was very hard to bite. I had to leave the bread in the end and finished the filling. The plantain vegetables tostadas was good. Overall, i would have liked the place if the attitude of the server had been nice. I don't think I'll be going back. I don't want the food if it is costing me the service."], ["Leang C.", "Visited on a work trip. With the reviews, I was expecting a great dinner experience and great tasting food. The server was very nice but the food was bland and felt like it was all just thrown together. Most likely will not revisit."], ["Taylor W.", "Incredible food and service. I had the cachapa. My wife had the empanadas . The cachapa was one of the best dishes I've eaten in quite a while. The empanadas were great but small ( as there were supposed to be in the appetizer section) I wish they had a bigger version of it. Overall my experience was wonderful ."], ["Rob B.", "This is another place I tried this week on the basis of rave reviews from my Yelp! buddies. And while it was good, I wasn't blown out of my seat. Part of the problem was after reading the previous reviews, I had extremely high expectations -- so high that perhaps I was setting myself up for a let down. The food I ordered looked like a small sandwhich on flat bread -- it was actually a fried plantain with shredded beef, slaw, sheese, avacado, and ?? -- held together with a tooth pick (like a hamburger at Huey's). I tried to eat the first one by picking it up.....I don't think that was the proper method because by the end of the first one I had narrowly missed putting most of the \"sandwhich\" in my lap. \u00a0-- I used a knife and fork for the second one.My friend ordered an Arepa which came with homemade potato chips -- fried to order. While I didn't try the Arepa, the chips were soggy with grease. Not so much as to be inedible, but definately not the intent.So I feel like a traitor giving this place only 4-stars after seeing that so many others are smitten by this place. I'm going back...maybe even today...and hopefully I'll see what everyone else has experienced. To that end -- I would recommend going if for no other reason than to just try something different. It's a nice place -- simple, nicely decorated, clean and very friendly wait staff. It has all the right ingredients for a 5-star review if I can get on board with the food."], ["Eliza R.", "Totally drool-worthy food here at Arepa and Salsa! \u00a0I went mid-week around 5pm and I was the only person in the restaurant, so I was in and out pretty quickly. \u00a0I ordered a fresh mango juice which was like the nectar of the gods, and a tostones sandwich. \u00a0HOLY COW. \u00a0The plantains were fried to perfection, and the flavoring and sauce were amazing. \u00a0Choosing items from the menu was a little difficult, because everything looks so delicious! \u00a0I'm happy with what I ended up with, though.I liked that the space was a little divey, but still cute and clean. \u00a0My server was very sweet and attentive, as well. \u00a0This little gem in Memphis is highly recommended. \u00a0:)"], ["Andrea B.", "Yummy!!! Absolutely delicious Tostones.The owners are very friendly and service was good!!"], ["Elizabeth L.", "Unique and delicious food! My husband got the cheese cachapa which he devoured, but was a little rich for me. My vegetarian arepa was excellent and filling, although next time I might trade the homemade chips for another side, not because they weren't tasty, but because some of the others (like the 'salsa' that came with the cachapa) looked so good! The only reason I give 4 stars is that our 8 year old was harder to please. We got her shrimp and chicken tostones cups which I recommend (despite being a small serving for $6) but she wasn't a fan of the plantains or of our dishes. She ended up devouring my chips and eating a side dish of rice. Perhaps it's more accurate for me to say that Arepa and Salsa gets 5 stars unless going with picky eaters?"], ["Theos M.", "Great food, mid-high prices and the service is great. One thing for sure is that it is not smokey as the burger place that was here before.Am a visual person, so more pictures for plate reference would be sweet!"], ["Dan B.", "Loved it! Fresh and delicious !! Great plantains and arepas and even dessert was awesome !these guys figured it out hope the public catches on so these guys can thrive"], ["Liz J.", "This food is simply amazing! I have never had Venezuelan fare before, but it was flavorful without being too spicy or overwhelming. The quantity of food for the price also can't be beat. I had what I would call \"nachos\" as an appetizer, and then a \"plantain sandwich\" filled with beef, coleslaw and avocado as my meal.I'd definitely go back and recommend all my friends to dine there, too."]], "Flight Restaurant & Wine Bar": []}
