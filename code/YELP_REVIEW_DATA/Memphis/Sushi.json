The food is a wonderful mix of American cuisine, \u00a0traditional Japanese fare \u00a0and sushi that can (and does) make your mouth water. The only thing I truly dislike... the desserts. Or lack thereof. Chocolate dipped marshmallows and spongy cakes. That's it. They do offer to bring a bowl of ice cream. But that is all. And their salad bar leaves one lacking. Other than that, it's a great semi-upscale buffet to settle your sushi cravings."], ["Dawn M.", "Looks like people are moving things into restaurant and one dumpster is gone.

As a buffet setting, it is 5 stars for me for the overall quality, variety, and good dining ambience. The staff and servers are very friendly for sure. I call this buffet an \"upscale\" one for it is much better (and of course more expensive) than most of the cheap Chinese buffets you usually go to. This buffet provides a variety of really good gourmet entree items like Asian spiced stewed beef (my favorite), Vietnamese spiced salmon, Korean spiced pork, stir-fried seafood (real shrimps, scallops and squid!) with vegetables, tonkatsu (Japanese fried chicken cutlet), Thai curry chicken, Chinese spiced ribs (very delicious!) I tried all of them, and they are consistent and delicious! (Imagine you will probably have to pay $15 for any of those single entrees at a restaurant!). This buffet also offers good side dishes, such as spring roll, tempura (shrimp and a variey of vegetables), pot stickers, grilled veggies and seafood, fried rice and noodles. They are delicious as well. I am impressed with the tempura, especially. Though being in a buffet setting, they change foods quickly to keep every item fresh. Now, the sushi section. Most of the rolls are decent, though I would not compare them to the rolls made to order at a sushi bar. But still, those rolls are still good enough. Another great thing about this buffet is that they offer a variety of sashimi! They have salmon, tuna, yellow tail, octopus, etc and they are surprisingly fresh! Since sashimi is popular, they are out quickly but re-stocked very quickly too! Their mussel with mango salsa is very tasty too! I also like its salad section since it has my favorite seaweed salad! Their soup section is decent too (miso, seafood and Vietamese ). Seafood soup is a must try. :) As for the dessert, I usually only eat the creme brulee, which is good (and all you can eat!) I am not really impressed by the variety of the cake, though. (As another reviewer mentioned, I would rather they have fewer cake items but upgrade their dessert section as a whole.) They also offer green tea and azuki bean ice cream, and they are yummy! They also offer unlimited stir-fried clams and crawfish. Your server usually asks if you want some of them, and they will bring them to you. I am not a fan of crawfish, so I sometimes asked for clams, which are yummy!Overall, I think this buffet is a very good one. I usually left this place with satisfaction! Now I either go there once a week or at least every other week. :)"], ["Rick G.", "The pluses - friendly staff, yummi gyoza, and they even had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cups for dessert.The negs: Their sushi (buffet) was just the typical buffet experience.

Fresh fruit would also be a huge plus.

I really did. I was such a big fan of them in every way, from the giant fishtanks to the huge glasses of perfect sweet tea to the great sushi to the... well you get the point. Then, they closed... for a long time.I actually did not even realize that they were back open, but I went with some friends to check them out last weekend. First, let's talk about the good stuff: the sushi is pretty great. The key is, it's fresh! I would not pick it over a dedicated super expensive sushi joint but for the price you cannot beat their wide selection and unlimited nom nom nom... sorry, got carried away. The fried shrimp was still great, the spicy pork was good, and the dessert cakes looked as good as ever. The waitress kept me with plenty of that delicious sweet tea too, so that was good. Then Stephen, you say, why not four stars then if the sushi, service, and tea were great?Here is the problem: the hot items were not that great (except for a seafood dish, the shrimp, and the spicy pork). Also, about 1/5 of the buffet was tempura (where it used to have a lot more variety of foods available. That being said, I am not being critical. If everything was like that and the sushi, service, and tea were as good as they were, I would normally give four stars. There were two major problem areas: one, the table smelled. It smelled like it had been wiped down with a dirty rag. This kind of puts one off the food. Worse than that, however, was the heat. It was hot in there, the air was on 80 and they said it was not working right. I don't mind eating while I sweat, as long as it's from the spices! In this case, it was just hot. I don't do hot.

As all you parents may have already found out...after you have kids, holidays (even the ones that are meant for couples) are all about kids.Food: The food ranged from 'not-very-good' to 'good'. \u00a0The starting salad was not very good. \u00a0It was basically just iceberg lettuce and a soy-based dressing. \u00a0The starting soup was nice, hot, and flavorful though, so that was in the good category. \u00a0In addition, I ordered the 'Jumbo Shrimp and Ribeye'. \u00a0I am not particularly pleased with the size of the 'jumbo' shrimp though -- they were honestly the size of a normal shrimp you'd buy at Kroger. \u00a0Whereas the 'regular' shrimp were tiny. \u00a0In addition, the shrimp wasn't really seasoned to my liking. \u00a0I just didn't like them. The fried rice was o.k. \u00a0In my opinion it wasn't seasoned very well, and there were too many onions which sort of over-powered the rest of the dish.The high point was the ribeye. \u00a0It was cooked and seasoned exceptionally well, it was tender, and flavorful. \u00a0It was a nice way to end a relatively sub-par meal. \u00a0In fact, the meal was so underwhelming, we decided to go elsewhere for dessert.Food: 2 / 5Service: This is where the establishment made-up some of its points. Like I prefaced in the introduction, our hibachi attendant was super nice and very interactive. \u00a0There isn't much to be said besides he was fantastic. \u00a0On the other side, the regular server was o.k-at-best. \u00a0She seemed inconvenienced when I asked her to empty the gratuitous amount of ice in my Coke, and also seemed as if she didn't want to be working on V-Day. \u00a0I don't know, but I wasn't impressed with her level of service.Service: 4 / 5 (2 for regular server, and 5 for the hibachi operator)Atmosphere: It was a nice atmosphere. \u00a0I liked the waterfall right when you walk in, the furnishings were classy, and the rest of decor was very tasteful. \u00a0In addition, one thing I always look for is cleanliness, and this was a very cleanly dining room and restroom. \u00a0The one thing about the atmosphere that annoyed me was the music. \u00a0Sigh...call me weird, but I am not a fan of hearing Justin Bieber in the background while I am dining at a Japanese restaurant. \u00a0I would much prefer Japanese/Asian inspired music, Classical, or really anything other then Brittany Spears and Will.i.am or Bieber in the background.Atmosphere: 4 / 5Price: I thought it was a little over-priced for the overall quality of the meal; \u00a0however, we had a coupon from dine.com that we used, so it was 50% off. \u00a0I feel as if what we paid was a little more appropriate than the full price we would have paid. \u00a0Price: 2 / 5Final Impressions: We will not be back to Sekisui since there are so many other dining options in the area offering similar fare. \u00a0We figure that we might as well try something else since this was such an underwhelming experience. \u00a0I would recommend not coming here unless you have a coupon like we did."], ["Wayne R.", "Not very good. \u00a0The price is too expensive. \u00a0The taste is bad. \u00a0Stay away. \u00a0Stay far away!"], ["Drew A.", "One of my favorite sushi places in all of Memphis.

The Sekisui in Bartlett is one of the newer Sekisuis, and it's rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to go for a quick bite or weekend meal. Aside from a few service and happy hour glitches (more on that momentarily), the food is consistently good and there are a lot of outstanding deals to be had.The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall near Kirby-Whitten and Stage Road. There's a Kroger, a Stevi-B's, and at the end, Sekisui. The space inside is not enormous, but they've done an exceptional job - there are hibachi tables, but also a sushi bar, regular tables, and small bar area. Warning for parents: Upon walking in, there is a large wall-sized glass fountain with running water. It's pretty, but I've seen kids trying to use it as a swimming pool or drinking fountain. Neither is advised. You'll be asked if you want a hibachi table, sushi bar, or regular table. You can order hibachi even if you sit at a regular table.Before I get to the food, I need address a few things. The service is good, and they have excellent happy hour deals on both drinks and food - however, there are a few things you need to know about these deals and in general.1. The happy hour runs until 7, and for the alcohol it includes specials on domestic beer, \"select\" wines, well cocktails, and 2 for 1 hot sake. All well and good, but the thing is that the \"select\" wine changes constantly. Sometimes the server will tell me that they don't have any wine specials at all - sometimes it's just one white, sometimes just one red, sometimes a selection of both. There was also one night where I ordered the white wine on special, and I could tell that my second glass was an entirely different white wine than the first. Perhaps having a pre-set and consistent wine special would make this easier on the staff and the customers - especially as wine special is ON the menu.2. There are excellent happy hour specials on sushi - you can pick from a limited number of rolls, plus soup and salad, at a price much cheaper than ordering a la carte.3. On the weekends, they have a hibachi special until 7pm - chicken and shrimp or steak and chicken for $13.95, or steak and shrimp for a dollar more. These meals come with vegetables, fried rice, soup and salad. It's a bargain considering the cost of non-happy hour hibachi.4. If you order off the regular hibachi menu (not happy hour), the meal is described as also coming with a \"shrimp appetizer\" - what is not mentioned is that they will not bring you this shrimp appetizer unless you are actually sitting at a hibachi table. If you're sitting at a regular table they just skip over it, and yet you pay the same price as the patrons who get the shrimp. I debated a bit about this with a server, and pointed out that it made no sense to charge me for something that the menu says I should get but I do not receive. She brought me the shrimp that night, but I shouldn't have to ask for something already written into the menu. I've ordered off the regular hibachi menu one time since then and did not receive the shrimp that night, either, but was too hungry to argue about it.5. If you order hibachi at a regular table, you will also have to ask for the dipping sauces to be brought to you, whereas they seem to be automatically produced at the hibachi tables. That all being said, the food here is, truthfully, quite good - and aside from the few glitches mentioned above, I'm happy with the service. The hibachi dinners are well seasoned and plentiful, the sushi is fresh and loaded with fish (more than I can say for a lot of places). If you decide to order off of the regular hibachi menu, I recommend the jumbo scallops - they're delicious and actually cooked correctly. So many places overcook scallops that these are a delight to eat. The soup and salad are fairly standard edition, but tasty and nicely sized. I have no complaints about the food here - it's not revolutionary by any means, but it is delicious. My biggest complaint is outlined above - the need for consistency. Either you offer wine specials or you don't - and if you do, have a pre-set white and red. Either you serve hibachi to regular tables or you don't - and if you do, the regular tables should get absolutely everything the hibachi tables receive, up to and including shrimp and sauce without having to ask. Give this Sekisui a try - as long as you keep a few things in mind, you'll enjoy your experience. I like this place quite a bit - if they'd just correct a few things, I'd probably love it."], ["Amanda J.", "We love Sekisui Bartlett. \u00a0The ambiance is great. \u00a0We've gone on Saturdays at lunch and they weren't very busy. \u00a0The servers were very friendly. \u00a0I recommend the Big Cheesy."], ["Misty R.", "I love sushi and all of the Sekisui locations in the area, there are several.

They have a great sushi bar and a Japanese menu (tempura, chicken teriyaki, teriyaki shrimp etc.) Each Sekiusi offers different rolls, some are the same, some are unique to the location. My favorite here is Godzilla- shrimp tempura, crab, avocado, cucumber and eel sauce. Try the Tempura cheesecake, it's a nice splurge!"], ["Tracee C.", "This was my first time eating at this location.

I try to frequent it at least once a week. The servers know my beverage of choice by heart (hot sake, yum!), but I always try to mix up what food I get each time. I love their basic rolls (Tuna, Salmon, Philly, Crunchy shrimp) and their specialty rolls (Hurricane is always good but the Arctic roll has become a new favorite of mine!). Their hibachi is always delicious too. The meat, veggies, and rice are always on point. And their clear soup and house salad always hits the spot as well. The number one reason I come here is their Happy Hour specials. From 5 pm to 7 pm every day (yes, even Friday and Saturday!) There are 2-1 hot sakes and specials on beer and wine as well. Then there are all the food specials...there are one, two, and three roll combos. You pick from a select menu and the sushi also comes with a salad and soup. They also have happy hour specials on hibachi meals and teriyaki meals! Their teriyaki burger is good as well. They have brunch specials on Sundays. I never have had a bad meal here!

The deep-fried salmon roll was filled with salmon, masago and cream cheese. The Tokyo roll had tender raw tuna, avocado, crab and cream cheese. The Crazy roll wasn't too insane - it was stuffed with crab, avocado and masago and topped with raw whitefish and green onions.

The rice was plain American rice, not true Japanese short gain rice. The salad's peanut sauce...wasn't what I would expect. It was some sort of brown sauce with bites of ginger in it. I couldn't even taste it with the salad. The meat was good, but without hood rice. It just ruin the whole meal. Then the sushi....was it even sushi? They didn't use Japanese sushi rice...and they surely did not try to make it into sushi rice because it was missing vinegar and it was falling apart in front of me. The box itself was expensive and not good...I also one sushi roll, the fire roll, it is a rip off! I've had better elsewhere. The sushi rice was falling apart, the sauce that topped the roll was the Vietnamese hot sauce. Uh...come again? I will never come back here again. FYI, this place is owned by Vietnamese.

The cordova and orlando rolls were pretty dang good....fish tasted fresh, great flavor from the sauces. My only complaint was that some of the pieces would start to crumble apart in my soy sauce dish. SERVICE: Herein lies the one glaring problem with this restaurant. My first visit was early on a Friday evening, around 5:30. They weren't busy at all and were able to seat us immediately. Our waitress was a young girl who proceeded to spill an entire HUGE glass of ice water all over my lap and phone, which had been sitting on the table. Not only was she not apologetic AT ALL, but she actually looked like she found the entire situation humorous. While my boyfriend and I were frantically trying to clean up the mess with our TWO napkins, she just stood there and watched and appeared to be stifling giggles. She made no offer to assist in our cleaning efforts, no offer to go grab some more napkins or a towel and no offer to switch tables. Now, as someone who has had 6 years of serving experience in New York City, I am well aware that accidents happen. I can excuse that. HOWEVER. That being said, it is customary to offer some type of recompense...a complimentary beverage or appetizer perhaps. But no, all I got were smirks and a DRENCHED lap in an already-freezing-cold restaurant. On my second visit, which was this past Friday, the restaurant was much busier. Without even glancing up at me, the hostess abruptly and rudely asked \"how many\". To my knowledge, hostesses are actually supposed to WELCOME you to their restaurant. This young lady appeared to not even want to be bothered. I replied 'two' and she threw the seating device at me without even asking me for my name nor telling me how long the wait was. As I was about to inquire on this, a gentleman, who I can only presume was the manager, came up and interrupted me, commanding the hostesses to seat a particular party that had a reservation. All I can say is...if that really is the manager...now I can understand why the service here is so poor. Once we were seated, our waiter, who appeared confused and lost the entire evening, came over with waters (which he did NOT drop on me). I asked for a sake recommendation. He couldn't give one. Okaaaaaay. Fine, I guess just a glass of wine. When he finally got around to coming back to take our orders, he stared blank-faced at me when I concluded my order with asking for a salmon-avocado roll. When he read the order back to me, he said \"and a salmon roll and an avocado roll\". I say, \"No, not 2 separate rolls...one roll with salmon and avocado in it\". He says \"We don't have that.\" First of all, what kind of sushi restaurant does not have a simple salmon avocado roll? He offers to add avocado to a \u00a0plain salmon roll, but will have to charge me extra. Ridiculous, but fine. When the food arrives, we get the salmon-avocado roll as we requested, but also a separate avocado roll. At this point, i am just so exhausted from trying to communicate with this young man, that I just give up and accept that I will have to pay for an avocado roll that I did not ask for. In closing, if the managers happen to read this, which I am assuming from previous reviews that they don't, you really need to hire people that WANT to be servers. All your restaurant seems to offer are sniveling, bratty, young people who would rather be anywhere else."], ["Happie H.", "Was skeptical because of some previous yelp reviews, but it was great.

Four months!! In addition, I called multiple times. But, of course, when we arrived there was a 30 minute wait only to find that we would have to wait two more hours to get the room we reserved. Some group had been late and thrown the entire schedule off. The manager didn't offer any apologies or comps. He just sat us at a hibachi table, where we couldn't talk and that was it.

We thought this would be a nice time to check out a new restaurant. Here are brief opinions.1. The sign outside is extremely cheesy. Whoever designed it needs to refund the monies charged.2. The restaurant did a decent job on remodeling the inside. It does not seem at all like the old bookstore. This is, unfortunately, the only positive from the meal.3. The food is overpriced.4. The food is bland.5. We both found it odd there is an extraordinary amount of non-hibachi seating. In most Hibachi restaurants, there is Hibachi seating and a small bar. Here, there are 6 hibachi table areas, and then a ton of seating and a huge bar. Jeff G made the remark that the restaurant is having an identity crisis. I agree.6. In years of frequenting other hibachi restaurants, we collectively decided that the sauces served with the Hibachi meals were the worst ever. One tasted like a chemical. The other tasted like A-1. In a ramekin. With a trendy name. The waiter seemed shocked when we asked for sauced. \"You want sauced? With the meal?\" Uh, yes. We do. Because the meal is bland and overpriced.7. Griff decided that this would be a good restaurant for someone to choose for lunch if they had to walk to lunch and ate at Buffalo Wild Wings the day before.

Or Picadilly across the street.2 stars."], ["Jen M.", "I would rate it a 4 for the fresh sushi rolls, but a 3 for the way they put them together (sloppy and didn't even give me ginger, soy sauce or a bowl), as well as the customer service.Went back a second time.

My family would drive from Oakland, TN to the Macon location on special occasions to eat at my favorite restaurant, so living so closely to this location was truly a blessing. Upon walking into Osaka, I was amazed by such attention to detail in the design. It offers quite a different vibe than the other locations and I really do enjoy it, but the decor can't make up for the poor service. Once placing your order with your server, who typically has an \"I don't care to be here\" attitude, you are left for a lengthy period of time to wait on your sushi. During this time you can do nothing but listen to the horrible playlist that the restaurant plays. I'm in love with the playlist from the Macon location and was hoping to find the same at the Poplar location, but I was sadly mistaken. So there you sit... listening to the countless melancholy ballads of Bruno Mars. I would say it took about 20 minutes to get my sushi on one very slow Sunday afternoon. The sushi is consistent with the other locations, but all things considered, I was disappointed. I only go back because of their heavenly sushi rolls.

She was throwing dishes onto to the table, rolling her eyes, and scowling.After hours of feeling uncomfortable, unsatisfied, and unhappy, we were literally afraid to walk across the restaurant to exit in case we ran into her.

All the rolls are beautifully messy, fresh and delicious. Also the cool thing is that they have a lot of \"off menu rolls\" which you can ask your waiter about. I just discovered the Jungle roll and it's basically life altering. It's a spicy roll with an equally spicy noodle vegetable salad on top, perfection. If you like spice, order it asap!!Service is good but kinda depends on how busy they are. We usually go closer to closing time and the service is excellent and fast.

The albacore tuna nigiri is usually outstanding, because of the quality and the size of the nigiri cut. My wife loves the seaweed salad. The chicken tempura is okay, but lacking a bit of flavor - definitely need the dipping sauce it comes with. The rolls are good. The Tofu Sukiyaki Don was just okay. The service is variable.

The salads were pretty good. The ginger dressing had a different flavor to it, but it was good. And, my wife loved the eel. That's where it stopped, however. The Miso soup, not quite sure how to describe the taste, not good? She tasted, and pushed it my way, I tasted and pushed it to the sink. The Pork Tonkatsu said it was I think fried pork, onions, eggs over rice bowl. It looked like dog poo on top of rice, didn't taste much better. Again, after about 2 bites, it made its way to the garbage. So on to the crunchy shrimp. Not so fast. There were 2 sushi rolls, but they were not crunchy shrimp. See pic posted.

We have been regular visitors since before this much more convenient location opened.

This place is about the deluxe, big portion, American style sushi rolls. Messy, saucy, crunchy, yummy. Sometimes we start by splitting the delightful mermaid salad. Wonderful chopped pieces of raw salmon, tuna, avocado, cucumber, flying fish roe and spicy mayo. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!The big raves are for the Joyce Roll, but I just don't like fried rolls. I'm sure it's great for those that love them. There are three rolls we consistently order, though we do occasionally omit one so we can try something new on the menu. So far, the same three rolls are still on top. The Mardi Gras, Mexico and Mother of All Rolls (the 3 M's). The Mardi Gras is sweet, crunchy with delicate pieces of tuna and salmon layered on top. The Mexico is creamy and crunchy and salty. And the Mother is difficult to describe because it has so many textures and flavors going on and a dipping sauce that complements it. These three have never failed us.And by the time the bill arrives, we are usually completely stuffed and have to take home leftovers. The cost is extremely reasonable considering we have in the past spent twice as much at Sekisui, with no leftovers and still a bit on the hungry side.If you visit Sakura, you won't really experience it unless you stray away from the rolls you know.

Can't compare it to other Japanese places because I usually get sushi, but even if those places taste better you can't go wrong ordering it from here.Pine nut tuna is also a thing to try... get a side of rice, as well as many of their special rolls.All of their other entrees are pretty decent, again nothing spectacular, but when you only have to wait 10 minutes vs the half hour or more at other restaurants (and honestly it's probably a lot longer than a half hour).I will say I don't like their soups, and while the salad is just a premix with cabbage and carrots the ginger dressing is actually pretty good(so if you order anything with soup or salad stick to the salad).So if you are in a hurry or don't want to dish out $100 bucks for dinner give this place a shot."], ["Katie M.", "My all-time favorite Japanese restaurant in Memphis. The fried rice is absolutely unbeatable. The sushi is fresh and very yummy. I've been going to Tokyo grill for about a year and have been hooked since. I order to go at least once a week because it's also very affordable for me, being a college student and all. If you order any of the fried rice meals you're 100% going to have leftovers, the amount they serve you is NUTS. Oh and if you order hibachi must ask for the two special sauces in little cups it compliments the meat and veggies so well! :) it's the best."], ["Cristina H.", "This place is the cheapest sushi, hibachi, teriyaki place in Memphis that still has decent quality.

At lunch its better to just get it to go bc it gets packed quick, I;ve posted our bill under pictures just to give you an idea of the prices and its really good.

They've got a nice dining room, but their primary business seems to be take out. Several parts of my meal (but not all of it) were served in to-go containers, which seemed a little weird for dining in, but it made packing up the leftovers easy.And I had a lot of leftovers, mostly because I ordered way too much food. Tokyo Grill's menu is extensive for such a small restaurant, and my friend John and I had a hard time choosing. We were the only people in the restaurant, so the waitress came and took our order very quickly. When we weren't able to make any concrete decisions after asking for more time, I just started ordering things.We started with an order of crab rangoon. I know that crab rangoon is fairly standard, but whatever wrappers Tokyo Grill used were better than most. They were perfect little crispy fried triangles filled with sweet cream cheese and crabmeat.We also got sushi - a Spider Roll (on the server's recommendation) and a deep-fried Yummy Roll. Both rolls were good and fresh, but not spectacular. On the Memphis sushi spectrum, they fall somewhere between gas station sushi and Ryu.The best thing we ordered, though, was the Pine Nut Tuna. When I placed the order, I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting - it was listed as coming from the sushi bar, but didn't mention any kind of roll.What I got was a long dish of cubed raw tuna and chunks of fresh avocado, topped with a soy-based special sauce and sprinkled with pine nuts, sesame seeds and roe. It was sort of like Japanese ceviche.Pine Nut Tuna, Tokyo Grill, Memphis, Tenn.I ate it with chopsticks, but next time, I'll probably take it home, make some wonton chips and eat it like salsa.Tokyo Grill is open daily from 11 a.m. until 10 p.m."], ["Chris M.", "Pretty good food.

The staff is very nice (and definitely had our orders memorized pretty quickly after our first few visits) and service is fast. I usually stick to the hibachi and combo meals because you get a ton of food for a great price: choice of meat (steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, and salmon, with various combos), a side of vegetables (mushrooms, onion, and zucchini), and a big heaping of rice (fried or white). I've had their tempura chicken and vegetables before and they're quite nice and come with a tasty pot of sweet-and-salty dipping sauce. Their scallion pancakes and yakitori chicken are tasty appetizers, and they serve their salads with the best ginger-sesame dressing ever. Everything is served in carry-out containers, whether you dine in or carry out, but that just makes it easier to take any leftovers home.This is a great place to go for quick, tasty \"fast casual Japanese\"--perfect for lunch or a lazy weeknight dinner.

When I got the beef, it was not only over cooked but really tough and dry! I was already ready to give up on life because of the shenanigans I've endured earlier that day. So my friend (which tried both proteins and felt the same way about the dryness) took my food up to the chef and told him my beef was over cooked. So then the chef began to tell my friend that it's not filet minion! I'm seriously over this place. Please don't come here. I liked the woman taking my order, she was apologetic and nice.

A couple friends and I decided to have lunch here the day after thanksgiving. I arrived after my friends did and walked over to the table. The restaurant was pretty empty at this time- 2 at the bar and my friends. Several staff people were decorating near the door but I wasn't acknowledged at all when I entered. We were seated in a booth with wonky seat cushions and although it was raining and cold outside, for some reason, the staff wouldn't turn the fans off when asked by another customer. So the food...I got three different rolls and seaweed salad. Crunchy shrimp roll, fried salmon roll, and the philly salmon roll. The seaweed salad was a bit too salty and because of that I couldn't finish it. The sushi was okay- not bad not amazing, just okay. My friends had lunch entrees and were generally satisfied but again not amazed. If you like sushi, you know that there are some phenomenal sushi spots around the city. The sushi was fairly priced but you can find better tasting sushi for just as good of a price elsewhere in the city.

Oh course the container on our table was empty as well has 3 others I stole from nearby tables. Not a big deal, but by the time I got some soy sauce, my husband had eaten most of my sushi...So on to the important stuff, food! We ordered the shrimp gyoza starter and 2 sushi rolls. The gyoza was fresh and the dipping sauce was perfectly sweet and salty. The sushi rolls were the island roll (tempura shrimp with lettuce which was amazing and different) and the Sriracha roll (shrimp tempura with tons of spice.) Sounds like a lot, but the portions are kinda small, so we ended up ordering the steak fried rice and fried ice cream which was a smart decision because both were even better than the sushi!

After about 5 minutes of watching my SO eat his fried rice I decided to give the fried roll one more chance and it still tasted like rice pudding.

The lunch menu was priced reasonably: choice of soup, spring roll, and entree with rice for just 8 bucks!

It's everything and the kitchen sink including adventurous dishes and sushi. I know this is how most Chinese restaurants work (or most international cuisine restaurants in general)--but I would rather have one page of menu items to choose from that they do really well. I got the Mu Shu Pork which was supposed to come wrapped in \"chinese pancakes\" which in reality were just thin tortillas. (I'm sure this is considered authentic but it just felt like a missed opportunity for flavor). The filling was pretty bland and the huge bowl of hoison sauce on the side didn't help boost any of the flavor.

I have worked in the service industry in the past and I would never deliver app, salads, and entrees at the same, let alone before the other apps were served. This kind of upset me because I wanted to enjoy a hot meal, by the time I ate my salad, soup and spring roll it was not the steaming hibachi plate I had came for. I was forced to eat my meal in a timely manner, but the food was very good as always. On top of that, with all this food in front of me our server had the nerve to ask if I was ready for dessert, I almost died. I know now to order at my own pace next time unless you want 7 plates brought to you at once.

Take a food that puts a lot of people off, makes them uncomfortable, and then prepare it poorly and it is a recipe for trouble. I love sushi. I love raw fish. I've eaten fish raw straight out of the ocean and had a heavenly experience, and I've drunkenly bought sushi from the grocery store and regretted it forever. Red Koi is a step up from grocery store sushi. When you think of fresh fish, you think of it as being kept on ice at the market and smelling like the ocean, cold and crisp. The fish I got here was room temperature and limp. This is not appetizing. The fish at a sushi restaurant should be kept on ice as used, and kept very well wrapped and in the fridge when not being used. So, how did it become room temperature by the time it got to the table? On all 4 orders of rolls? Then, the rolls were only okay. I ate them since I paid for them, but wished I had just eaten somewhere else. I asked around the table when we were done eating, \"Do any of you guys think you'll come back here?\" and everyone answered the same: \"No, not really,\" \"Probably not,\" \"There's better sushi in town,\" and so on. My advice, skip it.Here is a review of the restaurant without thinking about the sushi. When I go to a japanese restaurant, I look for the large bottle of asahi or kirin to accompany my cheap house sake. This restaurant only has the standard sized bottles of beer. Speaking of cheap house sake, they only have the warm filtered sake, if you're looking for nigori here you're going to have to pay for a bottle of it. It's not terribly expensive, just not what I want in this type of establishment. I want the large beer to make my sake bombs with, and the nigori to wash it down with.I gave it a shot, but I'm not a fan. Oh well."], ["Angela G.", "Hands down the best miso soup in Memphis!

No sauce listed for the crunchy shrimp. Both descriptions are standard when it comes to these 2 types of rolls. I get the rolls and there's this white sauce on both rolls. Maybe you've heard of white eel sauce, but I haven't - ever. And it tasted like suped up Miracle Whip - yuk!Fried Rice - It was salty and nasty. The rice was stuck together and it just had an odd flavor overall like they didn't just use soy sauce but also some added flavor. I didn't try the Habachi grill but I'm assuming if the basic rolls and fried rice were bad, the Habachi won't be any better. It took me two days, but I ate both the sushi and rice.

Here thankfully, there's no show but you get all the delicious hibachi brought to your table like a regular meal: your salad, your awesome clear soup, great veggies, rice and for me, steak. I won't say this is the top hibachi I've ever had, and I wish it came with noodles too, but it's very good and you get a good portion. I also love the Spicy Tuna Salad. It's delicious and seems like a generous portion to this sushi novice. My boyfriend the actual sushi fan has enjoyed his meals each time we've been here, and the price is just right. We both walk out full, me with leftovers, for about $50 before tip, and that includes a little alcohol. Servers and sushi bar folks are very friendly.

I had a tequila sunrise, spicy salmon & spicy tuna rolls, and bread pudding. 1) The tequila sunrise was very good. They were not stingy with the tequila at all. Good, balanced drink. 2) The spicy salmon & spicy tuna rolls were both very much as advertised. If you're used to sushi bars that pay lip service to the term \"spicy\", these will be a shock. They were EXTREMELY spicy, so just be warned. I can't be sure they didn't crank up the heat to cover up the fact that the fish wasn't the best quality.3) Finally, the bread pudding was very \"meh\". I will not be getting it again. It was quite bland; not enough cinnamon, nutmeg, or really ANYTHING. Bread pudding should present the taste of the spices front & center, not as a hint. 4) The service was EXTREMELY slow, and it can't be blamed on the crowd, because it wasn't crowded at all.Overall: it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

If you go with a big group, definitely ask ahead of time to get one of lounge areas or the rooms if you want to be more private. I love the blue lighting and swanky decor--it definitely makes you feel like you're going somewhere special.The service is always good. The sushi is even better. I've honestly had a lot of items off the menu and liked pretty much everything I've eaten. You can also ask for freshly grated wasabi if you don't mind paying a little extra--and yes it makes a difference than the green goop you get in most sushi restaurants for free. Only one downside is that the sushi's on the pricey end--you can get as good quality at Sakura in Germantown.

The quality of the the fish was... fine. Nothing special, but really not bad. I would stay away from their special rolls. I don't tend to enjoy rolls with cream cheese, but even the ones without this blasphemous ingredient were just ok. The seaweed salad, however, was excellent. I suggest ordering it with octopus.Both times I came, the service was slow slow slow. Took forever to order when I was there, despite the restaurant being almost empty.

It is a perfect place to take a group of both sushi lover and less adventurous eaters.
