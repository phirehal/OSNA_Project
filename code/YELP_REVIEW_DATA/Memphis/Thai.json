Maybe you're a person who eats chicken a day or so past the sell-by date. \u00a0Does that mean that your customers should, too? Grow up, enter the twenty-first century, and act like you give two ships about your customer's preference. \u00a0I've eaten at Bhan Thai for YEARS (I remember when they opened), and gradually I've watched the prices go up ($14 for Thai fried rice? \u00a0Seriously?), and the quality go down, and the attitudes of the staff go from passable to apathetic at best (or downright snarky and obnoxious, such as the time when I called to place a takeout order on a busy night and they refused to take the order, stating, \"We're the most popular restaurant in town tonight, and if you want the food that much, you can come up here and wait for two hours like everyone else in the restaurant\"). \u00a0I just kept giving this place the benefit of the doubt, but I'm done with that now. \u00a0So why two stars instead of one? \u00a0The patio is nice, if you can get a seat."], ["Lana M.", "The Salmon Panang is delicious. \u00a0Dine alfresco and have a relaxing experience while listening to great live music."], ["Stephen M.", "A pleasant surprise last Sunday night.

So then we were FINALLY seated and wanted a bottle of wine. It took 30 minutes for her to take our drink order and even longer for us to ever receive it. Then we ordered our food and it took an hour to come. By this time it was past 10 and we were all starving!!! Finally the food came and it was great.

Last night some co-workers got together and decided to venture a bit further out and try Bahn Thai since it had a 4 star rating on yelp. The restaurant is in a residential neighborhood in an old house. The ambience was nice and restaurant was quite full on a Tuesday night around 8:30PM which was encouraging. There were 3 of us and we had the Tom yum soup for starters. The soup was very watery and fairly tasteless. Then we had the spinach delight with Tofu which was almost decent, the Green curry chicken was pretty much inedible and so was the Basil fried rice. There seemed to be no salt of seasoning in the food. We kept piling on the chilli paste to add some flavor. The service was below average, I had to summon the waiter from a distance to re-fill my water couple times.Bottom line, it seems like a decent spot if you don't care too much for the food.

After entering and walking through the inviting dinner area that made you feel as if you were peeking into to someone's private home, we made it to the outside area. Immediately hit with the music from a pretty good live band and the energy of people, friends and strangers interacting at the bar. We were tucked away in a lil corner to ourselves yet close enough to the action to feel totally involved. Our server came quickly and did a wonderful job despite me having the decide long than anyone of what I would have. I finally settled on broc and chicken because I love garlic and it was in a garlic soy sauce which I could have had in a glass it was sooo good. The chicken and broc was seasoned perfectly, the portion was spot on and the price was extremely good. We got to hear \u00a0live music, on an outside patio, eating great food with the awesome atmosphere they have created for a more than reasonable price. I would have expected to pay much more than what I did.. Also at one point the Chef came to our table and introduced himself to those he didn't already know and asked how was the food which is always a plus.

I don't know how they have 4 stars."], ["Mike D.", "The food is delicious. I got the Steamed Dumplings and the Pad Prik with chicken. Both were very good and appropriately spicy. Note if you order something hot here, it will be hot.The one thing that keeps them from a 5 star review is the speed of service. I understand waiting for good food, but we had to wait 15 minutes to order our food. I watched one couple next to us give up and walk out. We were nearly at that point ourselves when she took our order.Overall I'd recommend them for good Thai good. Just wish they would have some more staff to help customers more efficiently."], ["Brent E.", "I am kinda of a Thai food snob. I eat at a lot of Thai restaurants and cook it all of the time at home. \u00a0I came here because it was close to my hotel. The garden rolls were good. The Tom Yum not so much.

The change in location has not changed anything except the menu card design, restaurant size and the distance. You can try anything from menu. Almost everything tastes wonderful. My favorites:1.) papaya pog pog (salad): Ask them to make it thai hot with fish sauce. It is awesomely hot and you will need thai tea to get rid of that heat. But it feels great to eat that. You can get it with medium hot or mild (but this is not as fun as Thai hot)2.) Tofu Pad prik3.) Chicken satay4.) Kao pun noodles5.) Kao Soi6.) Sticky rice with mango (dessert)7.)Pineapple fired riceYou MUST go here to eat VERY GOOD Thai food."], ["Srishti S.", "I had heard some amazing reviews about this place. So we decided to drive 20 miles for dinner. We were a group of five and everyone wanted to eat just vegetarian food that day( one of those rare occasions ). We tarted with veg Thai spring rolls an veg wontons. They were vey good. The wontons were like indian peas corn and cheese samosas. The plum sauce and chili paste were good too. I ordered the Thai ice tea which was very refreshing. Loved it. Them we ordered some vegetarian Tom Kha soup. It was hands down the show stealer, just so awesome. A friend of mine who once ate some amazing Thai food in California said the Tom Kha soup at Emerald was as good or even better. We all just loved it.Then we ordered one massaman curry and one spicy vegetarian fried rice. Both the dishes were very tasty. We gulped everything down. I was really keen on trying the papaya salad. That was the only thig that we were not a fan of. I had high hopes from the salad given all the amazing reviews. But overall it was an amazing experience. My husband says we will be back within a week or two to try their green curry. I would love to try their chicken satay and some appetizer with chicken patties. Our waitress told us that those two appetizers were pretty popular.I just can't wait to go back to Emerald Thai. I love going to family run places. They usually have pretty authentic food :)"], ["Deen W.", "The food gods were smiling upon me when Emerald Thai opened up near my house!! \u00a0I saw this past Friday that the long anticipated (at least by me) reopening of Emerald Thai had come to fruition. I felt a twinge of regret that I was on my way out of town, but resolved that Monday, by goodness, I would feast.And feast we did. We got an order of steamed dumplings and two lunch specials - Thai fried rice and Chicken Pad Prik (spicy red curry with onions and peppers). Lunch specials are all $7.50, served with steamed rice and come with your choice of soup (Tom Yum or Tom Kha) or fried spring roll. I got the Tom Kha, my daughter got the spring roll.Everything was just as tasty as I remembered them to be! As one would expect, inside is spartan, but very clean. Service was great and everyone was very friendly. If you'd like a glass of wine with your meal, bring your own - just a $5 service charge.

I'm a harsh judge since our last duty station was Hawaii and they gave authentic stuff, but I was impressed and will go again. Pad Thai is yummy"], ["Chris C.", "I've been here twice now.

I rely heavily on the curries and beef salads to judge a Thai restaurant. That being said, both their panang curry and namtok beef salad are outstanding. They can make them both to your standard of spice and can really bring the heat if asked for. We have always had great service as well. The ambiance is perfect for a date, and the price is far less than you would pay at a nice place equal to the caliber of this one. \u00a0I highly recommend this place.

You will be asked for a 1 to 10 rating on spice, but depending on who is in the kitchen, your 5 could become a 10, and 10 could become lave from hell. \u00a0Spice rating can be inconsistant to say the least.I will 'ding' the alley on service, but really, good service is getting hard to come by in most mid tier restaurants. \u00a0Bangkok Alley is no different from most in the area on the service aspect.The Collierville location does have a great bar and atmosphere - the Piano player is a good add if there.Here is the hidden gem - the Bomb sushi roll - don't miss that one. \u00a0If you are looking for a nice cheap night out - with an easy eye to the alcohol - you can be out on Date Night for under $30. \u00a0Of course, I am seldom easy on the alcohol..."], ["Brett P.", "Wow was that awesome!!

The Potstickers (not really a Thai dish) are supposed to be steamed & then browned on the bottom of the dumpling. These were dropped in hot grease and deep fried. The Chef's fried rice with beef was boring. The Pad See Yeu had very little broccoli and no ground peanut.
