The wood adorning the walls and the bar itself are dark and rich like a steakhouse should be. However, with any good restaurant, the focus should be on the quality of the food and drink, and the service that provides it.Unfortunately, at least as of this time, this restaurant is lacking in the service category. We waited for over 20 minutes before we got our first drink, notwithstanding the fact that we ordered it within five minutes of sitting down. The craft cocktail that I ordered was extremely good. It was exactly as described on the menu and they actually used top shelf alcohol in making it. The wine selection is very good, and there were numerous options to order by the glass, which is a very welcome discovery if you are planning to only sit in the bar or dine by yourself.Unfortunately, I must go back to the issue of service, or the lack thereof. We ordered two separate appetizers, as a group, and it took more than 40 minutes for them to come out. All that we ordered were parmesan fries with truffle oil, along with calamari. The quality of both the fries and calamari were outstanding. The fries, once again, were served with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil, which were outstanding. The calamari, as a nice surprise, had peppers that were included in it, and it was also outstanding. It is just sad that the quality and deliciousness of this food was overshadowed by the snail's pace of service and seeming lack of any type of immediate concern for getting both food and drink out to the waiting customers.Other friends who have dined at this restaurant lately have also noted that the dining experience takes an incredibly long time. I'm hoping that this is simply due to the newness of this restaurant, and that it will wear off very quickly within the near future. If this restaurant does not pick up the pace fairly quickly, it will lose its \"draw\" with the traditional steakhouse crowd, as there are plenty of good steak houses in Memphis that can serve the same great food at a quicker pace.For now, I will give this restaurant three stars in hopes that they will soon clean up their act, or should I say, quicken their pace. I will definitely give this restaurant a second try, but I will be looking for a much more impressive experience at that point."], ["J K.", "I would like to qualify this review by saying the Capital Grille as a whole is a very consistent and great restaurant. I travel and entertain clients regularly and often times at Capital Grilles around the nation. With that being said, I had the most horrible service by a general manager in a restaurant ever. Craig Patton was the most condescending, egotistical and pompous manager that I have ever met in the food industry. The food was horrible and all that he did was tell me that that was the way it was supposed to be. Absolutely not true. If you go to Atlanta they are wonderful, the food is amazing and everything about the experience is much different. I know they have only been open a year and a half but I promise you I will never go back there again!Oh yeah, if you ever have to go there because there are no other restaurants open in town ask for Merideth. She is an amazing server."], ["Elle S.", "I haven't had a satisfying meal in a long time and I had one tonight. To be honest I didn't have high expectations since it's a chain restaurant.

The calamari was dry and meh.Lobster Mac n cheese= holy shizzballs goodFilet sirloin w pepper au jus= filet part amazing, the sauce was holy crap good, sirloin I'm not a fan but I just don't like that kind of meat and I knew it when I got it.

We had a party of 15 in one of the lovely private dining rooms they have available. The rooms come equipped with all the necessary A/V equipment. We had a preset menu (choice of soup or salad, one of 5 entrees, family style servings of the most delicious green beans and mashed potatoes and several desserts to share) which made ordering very easy and also kept the cost at a reasonable limit. Our server, Michael, spaced everything out perfectly and while he was very attentive, he also gave us space in order to work. He even helped us carry our to-go bags (which were necessary because the portions were huge!) and work equipment to the car.If you are need of private dining space or really just a good meal for lunch (which is more affordable than you may think) or dinner, I highly recommend Capital Grille."], ["Liza C.", "The food was decent but didn't really wow me.

Ridgeway & Poplar seem to be getting overtaken by upscale, steakhouses: Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, and now Capital Grille. Our waiter was fantastic. Even though this was a work function, we were really laid-back and the waiter accommodated his service accordingly, i.e. not being overly stuffy or pretentious. Having said that, the entire staff was really nice--including the hostess and the guys at the valet stand. For the appetizers, I tried the lobster and crab cakes (2 on a plate--delicious). The calamari was good with the addition of the hot peppers. I also had the Stoli Doli which was pineapple martini--went down smooth.For the entree I had the sushi grade tuna steak with three different sauces and gingered rice. I was a little underwhelmed by the flavor--it didn't blow me away, so next time I come, I'll probably try something different. My coworkers who had the steak entrees were more than satisfied with their entrees--obviously that is Capital Grille's specialty. The desserts also looked great. I didn't partake, but the cheesecake got a lot of great compliments. All in all, a very good experience. Next time, I'm going to try the happy hour at the bar."], ["Emily R.", "This is a beautiful posh restaurant. The decor is very upscale. The servers are extremely attentive.

I had to use my phone to shine light on the menu and still had a hard time reading.The waiter was great and explained the dryed aged steaks. We ordered the filet with butter poached lobster and the porcini delmonico. Both were very delicious. Now my second complaint.

Waiter came back three times to apologize and tell us they would be out soon.To end this review, our check with 2 beers, one glass wine, 2 entrees and one side was $150.

There are no seats available in the lobby waiting area to sit. So we stood for about 10 minutes. But we were sat promptly at our reservation time. The room where our table was a little humid and not very cool. Glasses of water were sweating. The wine menu was on an iPad which isnt a bad idea since the restaurant is very dark. Water glasses were rarely paid much attention. The restaurant seemed under staffed. My 10 Oz filet was a complete bust. Asked for it medium. It came out well done. Manager couldn't have been nicer. Next one came out rare. He couldn't believe it. \u00a0Came out the third time and it was still rare to med rare. He said it was on the house. He didn't wait to see if the 3rd time was a charm...I ate it because my party was long through eating and I was hungry but it was medium rare to rare. The side dishes were average.

So we did and it turned out to be a fun, relaxing and pretty quick wait.We sat down, had some more drinks and ordered our food. I had the Beef Sliders and my girlfriend had the Mojo Shrimp. We split some fries. All of it was great. They were both small plates and we left not very full. So I'd recommend ordering the big plates ($$) if you have have a big appetite.

The caramel apple martinis are quite tasty. The boyfriend is a fan of their mojitos. While quite tiny and $7 for 2, the beef sliders are tender and seasoned just right.The Okay- The mojo shrimp are okay. I actually enjoyed them on the 1st trip better than the second time around.

We were nice and toasty even though it felt like we were outside (the walls are ceiling-to-floor windows). And they have a really cool grass wall keeping with the outdoorsy theme. OK so the Madison has a teensy bit of a better view of the river but the food (their cheese plate - swoon), cocktails (realllllllly yummy), service, adorable view overlooking Harbor Town makes the Terrace at River Inn win hands down ten times over in comparison.

IMO two people would have to get at least 5 things to share to not be hungry , which puts this in a fine dining price point. The chairs at the regular tables are terribly uncomfortable which goes against the idea of hanging out grazing and drinking.

The food items were underwhelming - kind of like an upscale Cheesecake Factory with less of a selection, thankfully. While I'm still on board with the truffle oil trend however many years later, that is about as exciting as their small plates menu gets. The wine list was plentiful, there were creative cocktails and although they weren't craft, still looked delicious. Service was perfectly fine, and the manager visits tables individually to make sure everything's going okay -\u00a0nice touch!"], ["Christopher B.", "This place was nice to grab a drink and take in views of the river.

The rooftop now has enormous glass windows all around the perimeter that fold completely away so on lovely evenings \u00a0the fresh air can blow through- but on hot, cold or stormy evenings it can be made comfortable. The kitchen whips up tasty, tapas style treats. The ambiance is reminiscent of something you may find in Europe, with big comfy couches as well as plenty of tables. Personally, by walking into the Terrace I was transported back to a rooftop in Barcelona that I was impressed with when visiting there. Not bad, eh?It's dressy casual. It opens at 5 and closes at 10 weekdays and 11 on the weekends. This place is destined to become the place to see and be seen.

It was a drier Mac and cheese, not soupy, which I prefer. \u00a0So it worked for me. My friend thought it was just ok. Drink prices were reasonable.

We chose to get a bunch of small bites since we couldn't frequent the place. We got: Drinks: I think I made a bad decision. I got a champagne margarita and it basically tasted like beer. Thinking back, this could have been a combo thing. Food:Reuben Egg Rolls- Way better than I thought they'd be. Deliciousness in every bite.Chicken and Waffle sliders- good flavor in the chicken. The waffle was ok. It's a sweet potato waffle and it tasted like there was syrup already in it?? It was either soggy from the syrup or too buttery. I ended up just eating the chicken. Duck fried rice- Eh, it was ok. I think it has been hyped up and I expected more.Gouda mac and cheese (because where there is mac and cheese, there are my taste buds :) )- HEAVEN!! Probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I am a fan of gouda in mac and cheese. I know a lot of people who are not. But this right here was oooey and goooey and cheesy and fantastic! I didn't want to share. Service:The service was fabulous. Everyone who worked there were genuinely friendly, I mean, it's Memphis. This is to be expected.

Also, the duck patty melt and the chicken and waffles are really good. Skip the fried avocados; they weren't that good, and actually was kind of odd with the olives. We did order cocktails the first visit, but not the second. They weren't very good, but it could be just an off day for the bartender (or no bartender), so I can't really judge completely.

Also you can choose any of the top notch sides but substitution is an additional $1.

Pure and simple: the food is done so well I applaud the succulent flavor of the burger, the presentation of their plating of the fries and sriracha onion rings (which are not spicy but bold and smokey), the service staff (which are allowed respectful body art.

Okay that's fine whatever. She brings it out and I take a drink and it's kinda weak. There's a lemon wedge on the rim so I squeeze it in then throw the whole thing in. That helps a lot.

For a family that doesn't eat duck, we sure did last night. It doesn't take long for the rice to come out. I dig right in because I am starving (which explains why I don't have a picture if the whole plate) I tried not to break the egg, but I did, so my first bite is covered in runny egg yolk. I'm the kind of girl who only eats egg whites so this was going to be different for me. It honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. My mom takes control of the situation and cuts the egg up into the rice which is the thing to do. We proceed to devour the rice. I would defiantly order it again.

I wonder how it got on my plate but brush passed it but then..it's in the waffle..okay. I take a bite and it's a savory waffle?! Oh no. It was bad. I pushed the waffles aside and just ate the chicken and syrup. Everyone else enjoyed their food though. My mom's pork chop was delicious and I pretty much helped her eat the bowl of mac and cheese.

Walking into Next Door, you will be convinced that you are in a bar that happens to serve food. \u00a0You would be incorrect. \u00a0Not the part about being a bar (because it definitely is -- complete with multiple TVs, excellent drink options, and more barstool seating than chairs -- but rather about the primacy of the food quality. \u00a0I'm gonna go ahead and say it: \u00a0all things considered, I'd rather eat at Next Door than Sweet Grass. \u00a0I wanted to try at least 70% of the items on the menu. \u00a0My wife approved of her standing rib roast sandwich with carmelized onions, and I was a big fan of my butternut squash bisque and fried oyster caeser salad (a special). \u00a0I've been on a sort of butternut squash soup pilgrimage since tasting what I consider the holy grail at a St. Louis tapas place called Mosaic. \u00a0My wife's homemade efforts aside, Next Door's bisque was as close as I've found to recreating that grail. \u00a0The fried oyster caeser was also on point. \u00a0I expected maybe 4 oysters, but was thrilled to see no less than 8 or 9 of the Gulf's finest teetering atop the Romaine lettuce. \u00a0Our companions each ordered the arugula salad -- a Next Door staple that has already been praised by other reviewers. \u00a0The best part? \u00a0Even after splitting a cheese plate with the table, a glass of red for my wife, and several Abita's for myself, the two of us managed to escape for less than $60 (tax and tip included). Why not 5 stars? \u00a0Even on a Wednesday night, it was difficult to talk at a normal level inside the restaurant, mostly due to the Tigers basketball game being pumped from the speakers. \u00a0Also, the service was a little off. \u00a0I had the impression that there may have only been one server for the entire restaurant. \u00a0I realize that these complaints make me sound like a d-bag because, after all, Next Door makes no bones about being a bar. \u00a0It just so happens that you might forget that once you start eating."], ["Chris M.", "My first trip in was not very good.

On our first visit, hubby ordered the special House Smoked Pork Chop with a cup of French onion soup, which came to $32. The soup was very good. He was blown away by the smoky, juicy pork chop, and still raved about it after a couple year. It was very substantial and more than necessary to make an enjoyable meal. I ordered the mussels appetizer as my entree. It was good but not the best I've ever had (not the freshest, I suspect). The table bread was cold and borderline stale. You can get better French bread from Kroger. On a second visit, we were both disappointed: the Roasted Sea Bass was overcooked, the potato puree underneath was boring, the overabundance of fatty pancetta was more of a distraction than a complement. The lamb chops were alright to me but he said he had better lamp chops at home and elsewhere. The complimentary bread was an improvement from our first visit. Portion sizes are larger than what you would expect from a white-linen restaurant. I personally would like to see a smaller portion size with a slightly lower price, which makes a more proper dining experience in my humble opinion, and may draw more people in.

I reserved the table through Open Table and made a request that they do something a little special for her. I didn't expect anything since I didn't follow up with a phone call, but was please to see that they had decorated the table in confetti and gave her special attention and acknowledgement from the Owner/chef to the wait staff throughout the evening. As mentioned in an earlier review, the menu prices are marginally expensive, though not too over the top if you come prepared knowing this; I think if the prices had been lower, they would be considered \"less than expected\" (which can be a nice surprise!) and so in that regard I didn't consider it off-putting. \u00a0The food: the Sea Bass was well prepared, but I concur with Veronica's review that there was maybe too much pancetta; mine wasn't overly fatty, but the flavor is much stronger than the fish and thus could be used with more restraint. The potato pur\u00e9e, while good, had an over abundance of butter. My daughter had a filet mignon, which was charred black on one side (maybe someone forgot to flip it), but otherwise was cooked per our order. The pommes frites, which is not what not what normally comes with the steak (maybe that's the issue) were sitting in the juices of the steak and thus soggy. My wife had the pan seared scallop special with spinach, pasta and a cream sauce was rich but balanced. For desert, we had the sorbet which was very good (reminded me a little of the sorbeto in Italy), and crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e had a great light custard, though I believe they used too much sugar on the glaze as it was thick, hard to break, and instead of accenting the custard, took away from that delightful and light flavor. In summary: this is a place I want to love, maybe in great part due to the friendliness of the Owner and waitress, but there were some issues with the food that kept it from being REALLY good. I also felt the decor was \"tired\" and as such the atmosphere needs something....anything.....though there was very nice artwork in the dining room. On an upside, we shared all 3 dishes (steak, scallops and fish) with my 5-year old and she raved about it all night! If you want brutal honesty, ask a 5 year old girl!I'm giving the food 4 out 5 stars because I think that even the flaws were not so bad as to say it wasn't good and has the potential for something great. The dining experience gets 3 out of 5, because while both friendly and helpful, the waitress would leave for long spans of time leaving us unattended; to me, the experience is equally as important as the food quality.

I expect \"sir\" \"ma'am\" or if they wanna go French like they claim \"monsieur\", etc... certainly not GUYS. \u00a0Okay, so we are seated and there are apparently no coat racks for coats. \u00a0Wha? \u00a0Again, I wouldn't EVER expect this from Applebee's but seriously, it's a $125/dinner restaurant that claims to be among the best in Memphis. \u00a0Not so my friends...

I liked the natural light and it was good for my photos. It has a very casual vibe inside with some interesting decor. Parking was a little confusing, but we parked at the fresh market and walked over. The food at this place was great. I really enjoyed everything I ordered, plus the complementary bread with balsamic and olive oil dip was delicious. So delicious that we got a second, no, a third basket! It's addicting. Food:Mussels - they were so savory and full of flavor. The white wine sauce was a perfect balance to the mussels, and the crispy croutons on top were a great pairing. $12.50Ham & Gruyere baked chicken - this entr\u00e9e comes with a side of mash and gravy with asparagus. The potatoes were smooth and the gravy reminded me of thanksgiving. I really liked the add of the ham inside the chicken because it added a nice salty taste to the breast meat. $18.50Pan seared mahi mahi special - this dish was excellent. I would order this again if I could, since it was a special. The mahi was cooked well, and came out nice and flakey. It was filling and light. $24Cheesecake - definitely recommend this dessert. It is so creamy and thick. And the amaretto with fruit sauce is a great addition to break up the creaminess a bit. It's not too sweet either. Yum. $7Overall, 4 stars for great service and food.

I usually get the scallops, another fish special, or the blue cheese burger, but I always have a great dinner here. I personally love the atmosphere even though there isn't much space. The dining area somewhat wraps around the kitchen and the bar so the staff are always moving about with haste.

But luckily my partner was in town, which means more menu items to try. We sat at the bar, as all of the tables were already reserved. Usually I'm pretty uncomfortable eating at bars, but this was set up so that you're not bumping elbows with anyone.I have to say, this was definitely the best meal I've had since being in Memphis. To list:Crab Cake... When I saw it, I thought it was going to be 95% filler, but nope, so much yummy crab covered in a crunchy panko crumb. And the 'spicy' sauce, while not spicy, wasn't some abomination that super-trendy restaurants keep trying to pair with their poor little crab cakes. My partner got one bite.Mussels... Best broth I've had in years. I could have eaten a few orders of these.House Salad... Three ingredients. Nothing else needed.Filet with Truffled Mash, mid-rare... Perfectly seasoned and cooked. Not completely charred on one side like I've experienced at other restaurants here. AppleJack with Beurre Blanc, special... While I'm all about sushi, I can't stand cooked fish. So every time my partner and I go out, he orders s fish dish, I take a bite, make a face, and put yet another species on my list of fish that I can't stand cooked. So not the case with the AppleJack! While I probably couldn't eat the entire serving, this was the most texturally enjoyable fish I have tried. Partner wouldn't stop raving about the beurre blanc.Amaretto & Goat Cheese CheeseCake... The woman next to us saw the look on my face when I bit into it, ordered one for herself, which resulted in the same exact face. Get the cheesecake. Especially if you're going home alone.The service was perfect... Made you feel more than welcome while staying on top of things. And this is definitely the kind of place that you could go to alone and not feel at all awkward."], ["Matt S.", "Had read good reviews on this place and was excited to give it a shot. Called in at open at 3:30pm to arrange reservations for 4. The only slots were 5:30 or 8pm unless we wanted the table by the kitchen door. We opted for 5:30... Very early but we wanted to avoid being seated In a noisy high traffic area. We arrived at 5:25 to an empty restaurant. We tracked down the hostess who then pored over the list then walked is to the only other table in the hall by the kitchen. I explained we arrived early to avoid such a table. She acted very put out and spent 5-7 minutes between the list and the back room... Nearly every table is a 4 top and none were occupied. What the hell. We finally get a table by the door. Okay. Our server was nice but very slow and quickly was overwhelmed by his 2 tables. Drinks were slow. Food was slow. Table touches were few and far between. One of my favorites, French onion soup, was average at best. Scant onions and the cheese was exceptionally clumpy. The broth was lacking flavor. The mussels app was very good. Great broth/base and properly cooked. Entrees came out and my grouper was good but slightly overcooked so it was tough on the thinner ends of the filet. Overall it was good but not great. My date's scallops were quite undercooked. To the point we questioned if they were safe to eat. $25 for 3 scallops you'd think they could cook them properly. Have to add that we struggled to hear each other over the din. For the style of place it is, the noise was a bit much. Had to flag down the server to get our checks. Overall some highlights but overall a disappointing experience on the food and service front. I'd go 2.5 here for the mussels and the accompaniments to the grouper, but forced to round it's got to be down.

Not only is this old Victorian a historical landmark, it's just aesthetically beautiful. Remodeled rooms and secret nooks that maintain a unique vintage-y chic vibe on every level.

Noland Fontaine built this Queen Anne Victorian mansion as a wedding present for his daughter, Mollie, in 1886 (not to be confused with the Mollie that haunts the Woodruff-Fonatine house across the street). It has gingerbread ornamentation and is widely thought to be the best representation of 1880s architecture in Memphis - truly gorgeous! Fun fact? Supposedly (or rather, rumor has it) that this is the location for the first photo spread in Penthouse magazine (before Karen Carrier, the now owner, bought the house in 1985). Anyways, it was originally the location for Karen's catering business, Another Roadside Attraction, and then later became the restaurant, Cielo, in 1996. Finally in 2007 it became the Mollie Fontaine Lounge!This is still my favorite place in Memphis but after learning the history of the place I felt an update was warranted. Plus every person I bring here falls in love with this place and it instantly becomes their favorite lounge/restaurant/hangout/bar/you name it in Memphis too. And I've brought a lot of people here for their first time since my review last year...The decor is out of this world and actually inspired a lot of my own furnishings in my home. I didn't get hot pink Victorian furniture (although I haven't completely ruled that out yet) but my chandeliers and cowhide rugs are pretty similar to theirs...oops. Well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...And the food? I actually witnessed my friend kiss his steak last week (his first time there) and while I'm typically into sharing dishes...I am so not into that here. It is just that divine and I typically **politely** suggest people get their own plate instead of sharing mine. Mollie Fontaine is simply a home run across the board. Victorian Village is my absolutely favorite place in Memphis and this home is one of the few remaining originals from the time period. It is so well preserved and a step back in time. The only thing people can possibly complain about is that sometimes it can take too long for the waiter to bring you your drink. My suggestion? Enjoy the extra time with your friends and order your next drink ahead of time. Mollie's ghost is thought to wander here still so don't forget to \"Cheers to Mollie!\""], ["Ashley P.", "I usually love this place. We went last Friday before the Bruno Mars concert.

The couches are all vintage and antique styled to go with the ambiance of the entire place. The waitresses and bartenders are all very nice. I have seen people celebrate birthdays, coming out parties, bachelorette parties and more here. Young mature adults who just like to have some drinks and enjoy this place are what you will usually expect to see when you come inside. Its in a dark area but this place is full of life inside and it has a classy feel to it. I finally tried the macaroni and cheese and it was really good. Just enough cheese to sober me up and the bacon, well bacon is good anyday, anyway!!I've mostly been on Saturday nights but Fridays are more LGBT friendly. Either night has always been fun.

So you have to venture out knowing that you'll spend some time there.The cocktail menu was not as extensive as I would have liked. They need freshen up their items.

Love the space- it's a lounge/bar in an old Victorian house. Two levels- one bar downstairs, one bar upstairs. Each bar is in a small room, there are no doors but the spaces are still separated since it's an old home. The bars were pretty packed but we opted to sit in one of the lounge areas on the comfy sofas and someone soon came by to take our drink order. The drinks came out pretty quickly and were very reasonably priced- compared to Atlanta prices, cheap even. The night we went there was a DJ spinning upstairs.

Sadly it did not come with mortadella. The olive spread had a good flavor. I also ordered some \"award-winning\" fries. These did not impress me. They should not have won any awards. The reason I give 4 stars is the great service I received. My server must have noticed my fristration with the beer list. She was very helpful in fixing this problem.

The service was good and the restaurant has a nice ambience, I was just expecting so much more from the food."], ["Caroline V.", "The food was fine (if a bit heavy). \u00a0Our waiter was great, very friendly and helpful. \u00a0$5 margaritas on Tuesday seem like they should be a deal. \u00a0The hostess, however, was unapologetically rude. \u00a0I saw Kelly English wandering around, but he didn't stop by our particular table. \u00a0I e-mailed management that night and received a phone call the next day that was also not quite an apology. \u00a0It's been two months since then, and it just isn't at the top of my list of places to go. \u00a0There are similarly-priced, equally-yummy restaurants within walking distance of this one where I'm welcomed from the moment I walk in. I'll pick those any day over one where the reception is \u00a0chilly (and that's putting it kindly)."], ["Vim I.", "On a Saturday afternoon, my husband and two of our friends decided to try our luck at snagging a table at The Second Line. Knowing that it's one of the hottest restaurants in Memphis right now, we got there at 6:00 to put our name on the list. (They don't take reservations). Second Line is right next to Restaurant Iris (great spot in Overton Square)--and walking distance from the new-ish parking lot across Cooper. It's a small, intimate restaurant--not many tables--so plan ahead if you're coming with a large group. If the weather is nice, you could hangout on the front porch or the back porch while waiting on your table. We waited about 45 minutes for our table--enough to enjoy a cocktail. I had the Kudzu (which was similar to a mojito except made with cilantro instead of mint...it was crazy good!)Now for the food....We had the BBQ shrimp (which was a John Besh recipe) with a loaf of poboy bread--it was so good, words don't do it any justice. This is a bbq sauce unlike any other. Our friends had the andouille, crawfish, pimento cheese fries--which were heavy for a starter, but delicious nonetheless. \u00a0For the main course, I had the Chicken Verno--braised/shredded chicken thighs and swiss on a poboy. It was unbelievably mouthwatering. I could have it everyday and not be bored. Lots of well-developed flavor and the bread (which is imported from NOLA), was perfectly toasted on the outside but still spongy on the inside just like a good poboy should be.I tasted my husband's fried shrimp poboy which was authentic NOLA. Our friends had the roast beef poboy--which is more traditional in NOLA than a oyster or shrimp poboy, and they were very happy with it. To end this delicious meal, we had the bread pudding--it was a good end to the meal, but the po-boys are really the star of this restaurant.Not to mention Kelly English walked around the restaurant and said hi to everyone.I'll be back for sure...interested in trying lunch on the weekend."], ["Sally W.", "I believe the first step to treating an addiction is publicly acknowledging it as an overriding obsession and The Second Line's barbecue shrimp about meets that criteria. \u00a0The sauce is unforgettably complex and incredible to the point that we would not let the wait staff remove it until it transformed itself from shrimp sauce to a po boy dipping option! \u00a0It has oyster juice, shrimp stock, Worcestershire sauce, butter and pepper making for a decadent option.. The environment is festive with a New Orleans vibe to it. \u00a0Staff is attentive and quirky at times, but service is efficient.The Second Line's bread is shipped \u00a0in from New Orleans and this small effort makes a huge and authentic impression.All of the sides we tried from the red beans and rice to spinach madeline were healthy portions and delicious.It was great to see Owner and Chef Kelly English a consistent presence in the restaurant checking on various tables and clients. \u00a0We thoroughly enjoyed our fried catfish po boy and one made from chicken thighs.A second line band may follow the main band, but not in this case. At The Second Line, the food is the star!Overall fun atmosphere, excellent food and many reasons to keep going back!Sally"], ["Brad B.", "There's an important question you should ask yourself, to temper your expectations here: have you ever been to New Orleans? If not, you're in for a treat! The place certainly has a New Orleans-y look and feel to it. Everything from the art, the furniture, the menus, makes you feel like you're not in Memphis. The BBQ shrimp and gumbo taste like what you imagine good Cajun food must be. They even have Crystal and Louisiana hot sauces. If you've never been to New Orleans, this is a nice little bite. If you HAVE been to New Orleans, then you'll realize this little 'bite' is not the same as a taste. Those BBQ shrimp were half the size as you'd find in any respectable New Orleans restaurant. While tasty, the flavor was a bit off (too heavy on the Worcestershire sauce?). The bread, which should have been soft and sponge-like for sopping up the sauce, was far too crispy. And when the waitress read off the dessert menu and mentioned a root beer float with IBC instead of Abita (Louisiana's very own), that's when Second Line's credibility really tanked. Seriously, if you like root beer even a little, find some Abita. They know their bread pudding, though, I'll give them that. Top notch all the way, with candied pecans, caramel sauce, and a scoop of ice cream on top. For a few minutes, all was forgiven. So, yes, Second Line has the atmosphere and the trappings of a traditional New Orleans restaurant but lacks some of the authenticity. I could see myself coming here with friends to enjoy a few cocktails from their impressive drink list, maybe enjoying a snack. Not sure I would see myself coming back just to eat. I would like to sample a few more offerings from the menu, though, so I'll give them another chance."], ["Tom S.", "WTF. \u00a0This is much better than a 3 star. \u00a0Get off your high horse and enjoy some of the best grub in Memphis. \u00a0 \u00a0Love this place. \u00a0Chicago could use talent like this- my hometown"], ["Mandy H.", "I had no idea this place existed until a Louisiana native friend of mine insisted that we go a couple of months ago. She took me there as a treat for my birthday and it was so awesome I couldn't wait to go back. Both times that I have gone have been late evening...and, judging by the negative reviews for this place, I'm assuming day shift employees must not have their hospitality panties on like the evening shift staff. My friend and I ordered drinks off the cocktail menu...ridiculously expensive but sooo good. I don't remember what she got but it tasted like lemon merengue pie and was amazing. She ordered meat pies...unfortunately she didn't consider that they may use a mayo based sauce for them until after the order was put in and the staff were wonderful when she asked about it. She offered to scrape off the mayo sauce and they felt so bad they brought her a whole new batch! She loved them. I had the beef and gravy po boy and red beans and rice. I am a red beans and rice connoisseur, if I do say so myself...it is extremely hard to please me on that front, but these were delicious. Albeit, the second time I went, there was way too much sausage in it for my taste...but that's just my taste ;)The second time I went, my mother joined me and our server was a delight. She spent a fair amount of time explaining each item my mom asked about, and didn't seem even the slightest bit annoyed...EVEN AFTER HAVING TO RETURN THREE TIMES BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T DECIDE! Very positive attitude!Overall, I love the place. Kind of small, and the sidewalk outside is insanely dangerous. But the ambience is cozy and friendly.

I went on a Monday night and the place was packed, although we did not have to wait. Our server was friendly, quick, and knowledgable. I had the beef poboy with spinach on the side and it was great!

Other than that, it was perfect."], ["Ebonye B.", "We were determined to try a new place. \u00a0Second Line...you're up! We ordered the enchiladas as an appetizer. \u00a0They were a tasty beginning. \u00a0Frankly, I expected a big cheesy mess, but it was not. \u00a0The sauce was nice- spicy, but not overwhelming. \u00a0Most of the appetizers appeared somewhat small- best shared by two or fewer people. \u00a0It is not a problem, but you should know up front.We both ordered the shrimp po boy. \u00a0The bread was perfect and the shrimp were big, fresh and well-seasoned. \u00a0The flavor was great. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft one the inside. I also ordered the greens and they were great. So with all these positive notes, you may wonder, \"why just three stars?\" \u00a0Well, the wait was excruciating. For more than 30 minutes we had to stand in a cramped space. The sever repeatedly reached over us to grab a water pitcher. Why she didn't relocate it, I'll never know. During this waiting period, we saw several dishes delivered to the bar near us. The fries were limp and small portion for the cost. I was concerned that I had chosen poorly because nothing that came out looked particularly appetizing. While my po boy and greens were great. I haven't been inspired to endure the cramped wait to enjoy them again. I noticed they appear to be working on a patio. Perhaps more capacity will allow me to stop by and give them a fourth star."], ["Brandon H.", "This is one of my favorite new restaurants in Memphis because it takes the kitchen from my absolute favorite restaurant in Memphis (Iris) and serves it in a more casual, less pricey fashion that fits in right alongside the other restaurants in Overton Square.I'm in love with the barbeque shrimp appetizer. Pro tip: If you want to feel good about the things you eat, though, do NOT look up the recipe. Nothing gross -- just an unholy amount of butter. Still, though, it's fantastic and I can't help but order it every time.Another advantage of this place -- the service is always second-to-none. I'm by no means a regular here. I have gone maybe once a month for the past six months. But I'm recognized and treated exceptionally well each time I come.I used to hear of some folks talking about how the Second Line was always too crowded, but I've never had that much of an issue. My wife and I went for dinner at 8 p.m. on a Friday night and were seated within five minutes. That may have been more the exception than the rule, but overall, getting seated has never been an issue.If you're looking for a place to begin a night out on the town, be it with a group or a date, I couldn't recommend the Second Line any higher."]], "Bar DKDC": [], "Kooky Canuck": [], "The Majestic Grille": [["Joy C.", "Downtown Dining Week continues....The husband and I went for a late bite to eat.

Seriously. In the best possible way. Bar seating is a Battle Royale but if you're cool with making friends while you dine, do it. Being from Portland I couldn't help but immediately like the bartender with his thick TN accent and incredibly helpful, charming demeanor. The bloody mary was perfect. A little kick from some horseradish just the way I like it. But the food is where this place shines. Filet Mignon eggs benedict? Whaaat? Cheddar Grits?? Getitinme. Those grits...maan...they will be the benchmark for which all other cheddar grits will be based on. They even serve you cute little biscuits as an appetizer, gratis.

But I wasn't overly thrilled with their desserts. I was here for a food tour and so we got to try six of their mini desserts. It's a super cute concept each dessert comes out in a little mini cup. So you get to try lots different things without being overwhelmed and flavor. And again you get to try different things.We tried carrot cake, Keylime pie, delicious chocolate mousse, strawberry shortcake, And a couple other things I don't remember. Obviously they don't stand out in my mind. Out of the six things the carrot cake was the best. But I've had way better carrot cake other places.Everything about this place screams money. So if you're looking to spend extra money then go here. But that's entirely up to you. If you're looking just for dessert I don't really recommend this place but there were worse places to go.

She didn't greet us (minus a star!) \u00a0I said hello and asked her if they were open since I noticed that they were setting up, I suppose for dinner. She looked at us again with confusion and told us how can she help us. I said we would like to eat in if possible. She hesitated and told us to hold on for a moment. Now I looked at my husband and told him that maybe we should leave because the hostess was obviously confused LOL If they were closed or busy , she could of just told us or expressed that we needed a reservation. Either way communication would of been nice. She came back after a few minutes and told us to follow her. She seated us in the very back, which was cool because I was able to view the big screen that plays all the old movies. \u00a0 However, after we were seated it took about 15 minutes before a waiter showed up (minus a star!). When our waiter finally got there, he was polite and courteous and recommended the seared tuna. My husband ordered the seared tuna while I ordered the Lemon Grilled Chicken. While we waited on our food, our waiter brought out our drinks and the complementary bread . Now the bread was delicious. It was seasoned and tasted great. My Lemon Grilled Chicken was so good. The chicken was moist and the roasted veggies tasted yummy. My husband greatly enjoyed his tuna, asparagus and jasmine rice. Overall, this place was great except for the hostess incident and the wait for a server. \u00a0I thought the restaurant had a really nice atmosphere, the food was delicious, and our server was great once he arrived.

For the the quality of food, service, and atmosphere this place would be price jacked if in the ATL. I'm a sucker for a nice plate setting and great interiors, and The Majestic Grille does both well. This place is much more larger inside than it appears on the outside. It is roomy, seductive, and has a fantastic bar. Food wise my husband was not impressed with his Artichoke Flatbread. Myself on the other hand enjoyed the Artichoke Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was plentiful. The eggs poached perfectly, and the artichoke gave a nice vinegar taste to the dish. Also as I alluded to earlier, the prices on the menu are well under what I'm used to for brunch in Atlanta. I was more than satisfied. Our service was a little frazzled, because it looked like she had many tables to serve, and their was a hiccup with getting a booth bused, but other than that I had no complaints."], ["Ronika A.", "I know it's a Memphis staple but this restaurant is just okay in my opinion. Don't get me wrong I'm going to keep going but the food is average at best.The good--The ambience is beautiful and I do mean beautiful.

The drinks and shot glass desserts are rather delightful, too. The fact that it's close to the Orpheum makes it a natural choice before or after a show.The okay- The food and service. Not bad, but not great. Servers are usually nice but slow. The server kept forgetting my condiments. Food lacks enough seasoning for my taste. For dinner, I prefer to stick with appetizers and flatbreads. For brunch, I like to get the frittatas (one of my friends loves their brunch and enjoys several of their offerings).So while the Majestic isn't my favorite, it's a solid pick for dinner & a show, a date when you are unfamiliar with your companion's tastebuds, or brunch with friends."], ["Ashley F.", "This place was to die for.

SO good, I couldn't keep my hands out of the biscuits...and I don't even like bread that much!My daughter ordered the steak and eggs, my husband got the John D (basic breakfast fare) and I opted for the crab cakes benedict. Oh, and my husband got a Bloody Mary - - at $4 and touted by someone at the CA as \"the best Bloody Mary I've had\" then he kind of had to. I had one sip....it was good, strong, and spicy! A few sips of my sweet tea quelled the heat, thankfully.Everything was absolutely fantastic. My daughter liked my crab cake better than her steak, so we switched. The steak was nice - perfectly medium rare - and the soft scrambled eggs came just so.

We were actually pleasantly surprised.This place has a very nice atmosphere! We were greeted by staff and seated promptly. Being brunch time, I was looking to have a Mimosa. I was happy to see that the drink prices are very reasonable here. A single mimosa cost $4 or you can have the whole bottle and a carafe of orange juice for $15 dollars! The food prices are reasonable as well. Unless you're eating brunch at a diner or McDonald's the prices run the same with most restaurants serving brunch.I ordered the Artichoke Benedict and my fiance ordered the breakfast sandwich. I tasted his breakfast sandwich and it was very good, but my artichoke benedict was amazing! Even my fiance liked my entree better than his! I mean WOW! The egg was poached perfectly, the english muffin toasted nicely and the hollandaise sauce was on point! It is probably the best benedict I've ever had! The artichokes complemented the hollandise sauce very well. The service was nothing short of excellent as well.We are very glad stopped to have brunch here!"], ["Anita P.", "Good Upscale American food. I had the shrimp and grits, and that is a favorite dish of mine! The shrimp were tender and nicely seasoned. The grits were creamy and well seasoned. Together they were heaven in the bowl.

The renovated house is really nice and I'm in love with their breakfast antipasto, you never know what you will find on your tray. Usually it's a boiled egg, brie, dried meat, fruit, a small baguette, great cheese, and a honeycomb. I always get a small french press and cream (which is good for about 3 cups of coffee). I never leave without my favorite honey almond pastry either. Even though it's French food, I'm always satisfied when I leave, not stuffed but satisfied. Their French onion soup is everything you want it to be, very addictive....and dangerous. During my first visit to Tart my mother asked the guy at the counter if they had anything low fat, he asked if she had ever seen a fat French woman....I would happily be the first. I love Cooper Young, and after eating at Tart its so nice to talk a little walk around the area. They are cool with you bringing your dog with you to eat on the patio too.

It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I'd be inclined to come back for breakfast if I lived nearby. The server mentioned that they were having trouble with the coffee machines as the coffee took a while to prepare. Unfortunately the coffee was bitter and the chai latte tasted like it had coffee in it. Food was ok. Brioche was a bit on the dry side and over-cooked but the ingredients themselves were good quality - sliced ham wasn't processed and the cheeses were fresh and tasty (wasn't regular grocery store mass produced cheese). Perhaps they were just having an off day...? Or maybe pastries are this place's specialty...?"], ["Gracie C.", "Delightful! Love this little bakery. The pastries are just great (mmm - that almond croissant) and the coffee delicious. I highly recommend the French press.

Highly highly recommend this lovely little place."], ["Ronika A.", "I definitely want to go back. I met a former colleague here for brunch. I got the hot chocolate, Croque Monsieur, and a chocolate almond croissant and something I can't remember for dessert to go. No, I didn't need dessert and yes, I ate both treats before I made it home.Back to what I actually consumed at the restaurant. The hot chocolate was rich and creamy AND quite delicious. The main event, the Croque Monsieur was better than I could imagine. Right amount of ham and gruyere- and the bread, ciabatta was fresh and just plain good. My colleague had quiche-can't remember what kind but she was equally in love with it-I like my quiche a little overdone (I know I'm weird) so if I ever order this I will have to request for them to put mine back in the oven.

Had some work to do so I decided to try out a local cafe while he was in meetings all day, and I'm so glad I tried Tart! It's a cute little French cafe, with a very friendly staff. I tried their Croque Monsieur, which came with a side of black eyed peas salad, an iced tea with the meal, a hot Mocha Ganache beforehand and Tart Citron for dessert.

I don't typically like apricots that much, but this hit the spot. As far as my friend goes -- she got the garlic leek soup which had a little more of a cream base than she or I cared for when I tasted it. Menu items are not cheap -- if you get a sandwich, you're looking at $10-13 per item. I am accustomed to paying this in DC, but in Cooper Young? The times are changing, I guess. The sandwich I did see one girl has sitting next to us while on the patio wasn't substantial. I am not saying the quality isn't there because she did relay to us it was pleasantly good. Personally though, I think I would rather spend my money elsewhere in the area with as many offerings as they are. I can't blame a place for prices if there is a market for people who will buy the product. Just saying I probably would use this more as a pastry/coffee/quiche place than sandwiches or salads. It is nice they have these additional features though.- They have local art on display throughout the restaurant. - Staff are friendly- Dog friendly place with room for your doggies to hang with you on the large patio in the front of the building.- Mommies, they have a changing table for your baby in the restroom.All around I think this is a quaint place -- worth visiting again for sure... just not for the sandwiches because I am cheap."], ["Caroline V.", "When it comes to Tart, I am torn. \u00a0The croissants and coddled eggs are where it's AT, but the service and the pricing are borderline ridiculous.

The number of instances when I've stood by the register dumbfounded at the length of time it takes for the staff to put a pastry in a box to-go is ludicrous.On top of that, the prices are high for what you get, even if what you get is delicious and darling (I'm looking at you, four-cheese quiche with your side of the world's tiniest baked apple).Four stars for food (when you finally get it), 2 stars for service: 3 stars average."], ["Richard A.", "Cute French bistro in the Cooper Young district. \u00a0There was a slight mix up in our food order, and the chef came out personally to apologize and even brought us a little goodie to munch as a good gesture. \u00a0Food was delicious, a lot of cheese on the croque! \u00a0The onion soup could've used a tad bit more salt, but the cheese made up for it! \u00a0 Why bother with ordering a small coffee press, get yourself a large! \u00a0Enjoy it all on their spacious patio. \u00a0Will definitely venture on back!"], ["Kontji A.", "Great service, great atmosphere, delectable food!Grab your laptop and enjoy the patio.

The space is nice but a little barren, I thought there was supposed to be art on the walls? The food is very good and different from the typical memphis cuisine. On one hand I applaud them for authenticity on the on the other here in America I want a little more than a small sandwich for $11. If they added chips or a side salad I'd be perfectly pleased at the prices, but I do understand the French are not a chip eating people. The service is very slow, it's great that everything is made to order but only come here if you have the time to linger, not that chairs are super cozy, hard and small rather. Also, pastries sell out fast so come early if you want your pic of everything in the case. This review seems a little more whiney than I intended so here's why I'm giving four stars - yummy food. We split the croque Monsieur and the salmon roulette, very good! The butter cookies dipped in chocolate, omg delicious!

The steak was too cooked and really cold. And it was pretty much just served on a bed of lettuce. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have touched it. I went back to get a cherry tart because I was still starving...and that was just like a party in my mouth. I'll be back, but next time listen to what they recommend.

The coffee is served in a presser for each order which gives you about 2 and a half cups, they offer a variety of creamers dairy and non (I had almond milk). Their apricot tart was what we shared for dessert and it was awesome--we asked them to warm it up and it was even better that way. They don't serve alcohol, but they do allow you to bring your own champagne without charging a corkage fee, which is amazing. They sell freshly pressed OJ to mix with your bubbly. \u00a0The atmosphere is cozy and quaint, with small tables and chairs and creaky wood floors.

The patio looked nice, but I'll try it out on a non-rainy day.I tried the tartine (toasted baguette) with herbed feta, delicately sliced radishes, salted pork, and mashed peas with a side of the tomato and leek bisque. Although the tartine I am used to (toasted baguette with preserves and butter) was not what I had, it was still excellent and very savory. The soup was not as light and bright as I expected, but still tasted good. The cute little salad had a nice and lightly lemony, acidic dressing that was perfect. My cafe au lait had the perfect amount of steamed milk, and I enjoyed the presentation of my meal. My only qualms that gave this place a four star review: I know that a French-inspired place is going to have smaller portions, so just be aware of that. I was fine with it because I was expecting this. I ate slowly and was satisfied. The lighting was not my favorite. Maybe because it was rainy, but I think more lighting would really help.There was no music playing! Everyone in here was sitting alone or with someone in basic silence...I think a little bar area with high tables/stools would be cool when their wine license is approved. $10 corking fee if you can't wait until that time.In other words, I'll be back and am excited to try breakfast.EDIT: forgot to write about the service: order at counter and sit. Very helpful and nice. Bonus that they can pronounce the menu items well.

We were treated like celebrities!!We had a 7:30 reservation, but we arrived about 5 minutes early. Instead of seating is at one of the many available tables, they asked if we didn't mind waiting for a \"special seat\" they had for us. Initially I was slightly annoyed with the 8 minute wait...until we were escorted to our table and sat down. We were given a table for 2 on the balcony overlooking the main dining room--it was amazing! Our server immediately greeted us and we were given a glass of complimentary champagne. Our server was very attentive and made sure our every need was met before we could think about asking. Everyone from the hostesses to the wait staff made sure to wish us well and made our night special. This was our first time at Flight but my husband is already planning to return."], ["Bianca M.", "I can't describe in words how absolutely amazing this meal was. A nice twist on the usual small plates approach, this restaurant served superb flights of foods ranging from roasted lamb to braised elk. Paired with their recommended wine flights, this meal was to die for! Absolutely would come back here. Highly recommend. A little pricey but definitely worth it!!"], ["K D.", "Beautiful idea to have for a delicious selection of foods and wines! Must go!"], ["David Y.", "Reading reviews about the organization of the menu at Flight Restaurant, I was worried that it was going to be mostly gimmicky with so-so food. My worries proved unfounded. I love the concept and the food.Alot of people have commented on the ambiance and customer service and I would just reaffirm those who came away with very positive feelings about this aspect of the experience. From the maitre d', to the bartenders, to our server Chris (who looked so young I kept wanting to ask him when he was going to graduate from high school), to the runners and bussers -- everyone made us feel welcome, comfortable and special. That is something I really appreciate when i am going to spend $200 on a dinner for 2.When I eat at a nice restaurant that has a good, diverse menu, I am often frustrated if I have to choose one appetizer and one salad and one entree and one dessert. So I love the idea of small plates. Flight takes this concept one step further, so I like it that much more.I won't bore you with the gory details of our meal, but I will say that of 15 plates that came to our table, only the tuna tartare I would not eat again. MORE IMPRESSIVELY, the entree flight I designed had bison, elk, and quail and each of these three items were delivered to the table at exactly the proper temperature. I am not a chef, but I have had plenty of meals in which the kitchen could not prepare a single entree at the correct temperature, much less three at the same time. My compliments to the entire kitchen brigade.I recall glancing at one Yelp review that suggested the portions were not a good value for the money. I could not disagree more. Each item in each flight we had was at least 1/3 of a portion. We had an appetizer flight, a salad flight, and two entree flights, and we couldn't finish our dessert flight. It was more than enough food.The only misstep of the entire night was when I order the Tennessee whiskey flight to close the meal and the bar substituted one of the whiskies without asking me first.If I make it to Memphis again, I will definitely eat at Flight again, no question about that. I will also see if they won't comp me the whiskey they were missing the last time."], ["Shannon C.", "I stumbled across this restaurant while out walking. My friends and I decided to try some wine tasting. This place is awesome! You can get tiny portions of anything; appetizers, drinks, desert, whatever. Seeing that this was our first time here, our waiter Chris L., was extremely helpful when assisting us with our selections. We enjoyed the restaurant so much we are coming back tomorrow."], ["Amanda W.", "This is an amazing experience! New to the area, and not yet finding very many fine dining restaurants, we were ecstatic to discover Flight. I took my husband here for his birthday. Our initial impression is that it wasn't very fancy; the decor and atmosphere wasn't what I expected. However, the service was impeccable, and the food and menu choices were divine! They have a fabulous wine list, and everything you order is in \"flights.\" From the appetizers to the main course, wine, and even desert, you get to try three of each! So unique! It's not really tapas style, as 1) it's not Spanish cuisine, and 2) it's a flight (small samples of full dishes). We truly enjoyed ourselves and will be back."], ["Devon O.", "The idea is basically tapas for American food and wine tasting. Three mini meals or three types of wine for a round price \u00a0The wonders of the world wine flight was awesome, as was the lobster gravy and biscuits (all seafood, even the gravy). Veal was also awesome."], ["John Q.", "I pulled off the interstate in search of Memphis' best on a dinner away from home...the first barbeque joint that I selected was closed, so I rolled the dice searching for simply good food..what I found was an exquisite dinner for 1/3 the price if I were to be eating at one of Manhattan's finest.The restaurants approach to dining is to allow flights of food, along with flights of wine. \u00a0This allows for a robust portions across multiple entree's...for example, three preparations of fish, a variety of shellfish, or in my case bison ribeye, elk chop, and a succulent filet.Beyond the menu, I found the staff friendly, and fully engaged with ideas on how to craft a food and wine dining experience that was fun and superb.I look forward to a return with my family to show them what wonderful food, and attentive service is all about.Best- John"], ["Michael B.", "Let me just say I have never ate at Flight nor will I ever. \u00a0I called Flight to arrange for a dessert to be brought to some good friends of mine who were celebrating their anniversary. \u00a0They had already finished eating so I was unable to send anything to their table. \u00a0TWO MONTHS LATER I received a charge for $96 on my credit card, the original item I had ordered was in the $30 range and it was two months ago and they never received it. \u00a0I accidently noticed the charge on my credit card and called Matt at Flight who knew what I was talking about but offered no apology and indicated it was a mix up with Open Table which is weird since I called the restaurant and read my CC # over the phone. \u00a0I did get the credit 36 hours later and I get that mistakes happen but to be charged for non existent items is criminal. \u00a0I would definitely be wary of using my credit card at Flight."], ["Sara Y.", "Flight's food is practically unmatched. The small plates of intricate, different meals is so refreshing- definitely better than your run of the mill hunk of steak. The presentation of all of the food is simply exquisite to the point that you feel bad destroying the art by eating it. Their plate of cheeses and meats is absolutely phenomenal and has some interesting picks, though nothing offensive or risky. I don't really know where to start with the desserts... Oh, the desserts... They are so elegant and so tasty, but they never last long enough.The service here and the darkness could use some work. Other than that, Flight is my #1 pick if I'm willing to drop that kind of money on food. It is definitely worth what you pay, however."], ["Chealsy L.", "Oh my goodness. If you were a devout Catholic you may need to seek confession after eating here. It is all sinfully delicious! Cannot rave enough about it. The Ostrich and Bison are to die for. \u00a0Amazing! Must go at least once."], ["Richard L.", "I had a well travelled customer tell me Flight was the best restaurant in Memphis. I called to see if they served Sunday brunch and found it was their first day doing so. We were the first customers to experience the brunch menu. The \"Flight\" concept of mixing and matching small plate or entree portions is wonderful. We started with a Mimosa from the bar. We chose the Great with Syrup and Delta flights. The small portions gave us six items and two sides to share. Each was truly amazing. The Pork Tenderloin on Pumpkin Ravioli (topped with Apricot Chutney) was our favorite. Ghiradelli Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Cheese Grits, Chicken & Waffles were the best we ever had. \u00a0The coffee with a hint of chickory is not to be missed. \u00a0Prices very reasonable for such a quality menu. \u00a0Service from front door to table was exceptional. Brittany our waitress was informative and helpful. Management checked in to get feedback about brunch. \u00a0Take advantage of the outdoor patio seating on those pretty mornings. Flight is truly the best restaurant in Memphis."], ["Jeannine S.", "I can't say enough about this place. \u00a0I love food and wine, so how could I go wrong? \u00a0Well, it's possible, but not at Flight.I've been here a handful of times for a variety of occasions, from business dinners to personal celebrations to date nights. \u00a0If you're going with another person, try to request a table on the second floor either next to the window (for a great view and some privacy) or next to the railing overlooking the first floor tables/bar (for some good people watching).The food is delicious. \u00a0I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on that, but I've had just about every non-seafood item on their menu. \u00a0My favorite I think would be the duck, or maybe the lamb, or whatever, it's all good. \u00a0The wine is great, and they will let you do a flight of high-end wines...and save room for the Port flight.TIP: When you order a flight, you do NOT have to order all three dishes! \u00a0You can order only one or two small plates and they will just charge you for each small portion. \u00a0It will help you save room for dessert.Foodies, put this place on your list. \u00a0Bookmark it on Yelp. \u00a0But make sure you make a reso in advance. \u00a0Same-day is near impossible and the bar is always packed."], ["F G.", "Great food, problematic service.Waiter shared \u00a0his entire life story with the table next to us. We waited for at least 5 minutes before we got a wine menu. No chance to order an aperitif. First fail, in my opinion. After getting a lecture of what a flight is (no question about if we know what a flight is... we do, doh) my wife ordered a glass of Prosecco with the Carpaccio starter.Carpaccio came, no Prosecco. After reminding the service that we were still waiting for a Prosecco, it eventually arrived (and I got my flight of wine with the starter, for whatever reason). After we barely finished the Carpaccio, literally 30 seconds later, our entree flights arrived, but my wife was then waiting for her flight of wine.The food was great, but way too much for a \"flight\" which is supposed to be a taster, not three heavy starter-sized plates. But please, just because we are not from Memphis, we aren't idiots."], ["Sofia M P.", "Yesterday my husband and I went on a date to celebrate our 11th anniversary* On the past we've heard awesome things about this restaurant So I went on Yelp to make sure this place was what we had in mind for our place to celebrate. The pictures showed a nice atmosphere and yummi food, and so I reserved online, we sure weren't dissapointed . \u00a0The place has a very romantic feeling, the service is profesional and inviting, and of course the menu has all good options for every taste. We went with the flights because we are foodies with a big appetite and we like to try all types of food . My husband got the soup flight and I got the appetizer flight and we shared both. \u00a0The appetizer flight has two huge shrimp, a crab cake that is Out of this world, and the Calamari in that awesome cilantro sauce.... oh the calamari! It's creamy, perfectly well cooked and that Sauce is the best partner for those pieces of heaven. \u00a0The soups are super creamy and delicious, my favorite being the acorn cream with caramelized almonds on top.Then, he got the meet flight ( ostritch, elk and steak )and I got the fish flight. Both were delish! \u00a0Probably the best on my trio was the fish filet On top of the Lobster rissoto, and on my husband's plate was the steak on top of the mashed potatoes. \u00a0That Sauce was amazing! Also the ostrich was very good, very well cooked . My father in law had ostriches a while back ago, so we have had try ostrich before, but never prepared as exquisite as it was yesterday. The price is fair because this type of meals are special and very well executed. \u00a0For a special date or a nice dinner this is a good place to go. \u00a0The price are worth it."], ["Brian R.", "Went on a double date about a week ago and absolutely loved it! A little pricey but you get what you pay for!"], ["John H.", "I love the food and the service more. One of our favorite stops in Memphis."]]}
