I went a little unconventional, but really liked what I got. I went with a side salad with gorgonzola added to it, a bowl of their avgolemino soup, and the eggplant fries. Oh those fries! They alone will Insure my return. The bread pudding of the night was cherry, and I wish it were a regular on the menu. I would order it every time. Outstanding!

I've been back three times and I can honestly say that the jump from two to four stars is well deserved!My boyfriend and I were invited to join two other couples at Ciao Bella and we accepted. \u00a0I was a little leery to try this place again, but I certainly didn't want to be rude, so I went. \u00a0Let me tell you, it was a great decision. \u00a0We ordered a few appetizers; calamari, tasted ravioli, and the antipasto. \u00a0The variety of cheeses, meats, and olives on the antipasto plate was impressive. \u00a0Not a large amount, but lots of different flavors to enjoy. \u00a0My boyfriend and I both ordered the special of the evening which was a hangar steak served over wilted spinach and finger potatoes. \u00a0I loved the steak. \u00a0It's too bad it was a special and not on the regular menu. \u00a0I would order the steak again. \u00a0I had coffee for dessert and when I asked for whipped cream the waiter said, \"no problem.\" \u00a0When he brought it out to me in a little dish he told me that the kitchen had just prepared it for me fresh. \u00a0It was awesome!! \u00a0Nothing like REAL, fresh whipped cream. \u00a0Overall everyone was really pleased with the food and the service. \u00a0The SO and I enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back a few weeks later. \u00a0I was sad to learn that there would be no steak because like I said, it had been a special and was not available. \u00a0I went with the Veal Picatta and enjoyed it. \u00a0Once again, I ordered coffee and the whipped cream put a huge smile on my face.Last week we went back AGAIN. \u00a0Still no steak but we did order the appetizer special of the evening. \u00a0I wish I could remember what it was called. \u00a0It was shrimp sauteed in a buttery sauce that was so incredible we ordered another one. \u00a0After the two of us polished off two generous servings of saucy, shrimp amazingness, I was hardly interested in ordering \"dinner,\" so I got the wedge salad."], ["Don C.", "Dyann and I went here for a late lunch. \u00a0Atmosphere is nice and service was good. \u00a0My eggplant was fresh and tasty as well as was the salad. \u00a0They had a Yelp coupon good for a half price lunch.

Very impressed with the super outgoing staff, comfortable atmosphere and last but not least the food!!!The Fired goat cheese polenta was amazing!!

I had a wonderful time and cannot wait to visit again!!"], ["John F.", "This place is too legit to quit! I am from St. Louis, and when I moved to Memphis I was begging for a decent Italian place to eat. I believe I found it here. They got everything right, the lighting is dark, the pasta has perfect texture and there's even a chunky man in the back corner looking like the Godfather. Pizza and Pasta is on point and they also have great sandwiches for lunch. I think it's worth trying! ;-)"], ["Margie S.", "Everything I have tried is excellent, including the service.

If you've seen Seinfeld soup nazi episode you know what I'm talking about! The heirloom capreese is the best. Presentation is everything and they know how to do it. I also ordered the Bella Donna (beautiful lady) sandwich with the homemade chips. The waitress said the chef made up this sandwich and that he was really good and talented, based on what I've tasted so far I would definitely agree with her. The sandwich has mortadella, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, roasted red pepper heated and finished with fresh basil, shredded lettuce and baslamic mayo all on a wheat berry bread.

We usually have our three-year-old with us, and they are very accommodating. Most of the time they come out with a dough ball for her to roll around on the table.Arrive with an empty stomach. They start you off with bread fresh from the ovens of heaven. When the server asks you, \"Would you like to start off with any appetizers?\" say, \"Yes, I would love the baked ravioli.\" Why should you say that, you ask? Because it is from the same ovens the bread comes from, I'm sure of it. It's so crispy and warm and has the most cheesy, delicious filling.When it comes to the main course, I am afraid my opinion isn't very extensive. Because I love it so much, I have only ever ordered the Pasta Primavera, sometimes with chicken, sometimes without. I always mooch off my husband, who is not afraid to try new things, and have never been disappointed in the various other dishes he's ordered. We always finish off Ciao Bella with a short walk down to Yolo for gelato, though I'm sure their desserts are great."], ["Ediza F.", "Let me start of by saying, that we called ahead and since they closed at 9:30 we asked if they could still accommodate us 15 mins before closing...they welcomed us with open arms!! Talk about souther hospitality!!! We immediately told chef Brandon that I was Vegan and my fianc\u00e9 was vegetarian, and appetizers and meals were customized to our dietary needs. He made me a PHENOMENAL dish with vegan mozzarella and all the fresh produce from their local organic farmers!! It's the first meal I've had that was vegan that I felt was 100% gourmet. No lie. Remember not all dishes are the same it depends on what their farmers will offer, but honestly just \"let em cook\" and they'll make you a good vegan dish!!"], ["Tony M.", "There are so few good non-chain Italian restaurants in this area, and I believe this one ranks as one of the top 2 in the city. The service was as crisp as the house salad, and the entrees were wonderful. Between the four of us we each ordered a different style entree, and there was little talking during the meal as we each savored our meals. I HIGHLY recommend this restraint; we will definitely be going back!"], ["Beth S.", "We had to wait for about an hour as it was Friday night, but we waited in the bar, where \u00a0the bartender was friendly and attentive. After almost an hour, we were starting, so we decided to have appetizers in the bar.I had the Caprese Salad, which was fresh and delicious, but could have had more basil and I missed the capers. But the balsamic was tasty and the mozzarella was fresh and slices were generous. We didn't mind waiting, as the bar is lively and fun with a good wine selection.Dinner was excellent. My Grouper Alla Pesto was wonderful - I loved the fresh vegetables and the fish was flaky and tender. When I divided my portion in half and asked for a to-go box, the server was so impressed with my willpower she brought us a free slice of cheesecake. I took a small bite and it was creamy and delicious.This was our first visit, but it most certainly won't be our last. It's casual but upscale with a relaxed feel and a bar so cool you don't mind the wait."], ["Melody D.", "This is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants I've been to lately. We started with the Mozzarella and Parmigiana Garlic Bread. It was great--and the marinara that came with it was some of the best I've ever had. The house bread they brought out was very good too. My husband had the manicotti (full order) and ate it all--I didn't even get to try it! He said it was wonderful. I had the white pizza, which was amazing. I'll definitely be going back."], ["Katie P.", "Ciao Bella is a great place for a family dinner, date, dinner w/girlfriends, etc. It's in East Memphis in a shopping center, so you might not think it's really nice inside (with an awesome patio), but it is. I loved it before I was vegan, but I thought I'd pretty much have to just write it off afterward. But then they started offering vegan (and gluten-free) offerings. I have been several times and tried several different things and have been wowed every time.I usually just tell my server I'm vegan and ask the chef to make me something. I tell them what I don't like, and both times the chef has actually come out to my table to talk to me about it. They have awesome bread and oil and fountain drinks and coke products, which, if you know me, matters to me a lot!My only problem is that I wish they didn't serve veal. Along with foie gras, veal is one of the most cruel animal products there is. I wish Ciao Bella (and about a million other restaurants) would be more sensitive to that."], ["Nancy K.", "I've been away from Memphis for a while so when I had the chance to come back and eat a catch-up meal with a girlfriend, she suggested Ciao Bella since I've never been before.Ever since I started dating my now-fiance, I have rarely eaten Italian (aka 0 times). He's not a big fan of anything noodle-y so that means no Italian food and also no more pad thai (one of my favorite foods but that's another story). Anyways, I was pretty excited to go try out this Italian eatery.My friend and I started off by sharing the Caesar salad, which was very tasty and a good sharing size. We were also given a basket of fresh bread with olive oil and generously offered more bread when our basket emptied.For the entree, I had the half portion Penne Pesto. This is a great size for one person and left me very full. The pasta was super pesto-y, which I personally love, but the chicken was a little chewy.Overall, I loved the food here and would love to go again. Our waiter was very nice and kindly refilled our waters because we ended up chatting for almost 3 hours. We went on a weekday night so I'm not sure how the crowds are on busier nights."], ["Kerry C.", "There's a good reason that Memphians have loved Ciao Bella for the last 10 years. The casual East Memphis restaurant serves great Italian food. They also are great at curing extreme pasta cravings (like the one I had a few nights ago).We started with one of Ciao Bella's appetizer specials - seared scallops with blood oranges.Both scallops and blood oranges are on my shortlist of favorite foods, and these were excellent. They came dressed with a tangy, fruity sauce that complimented both. I'm pretty sure this isn't on the regular menu, but it should be.Speaking of the regular menu, it's pretty impressive. There are pizzas, pastas, Italian-inspired entrees and plenty of seafood.I couldn't decide between the pasta and seafood, so I went with the lobster ravioli ($18).The orange and white striped pasta was much spicier than I thought it would be. I think part of the spice came from the roasted red pepper cream sauce, but the pasta definitely had some flavor on its own.The raviolis were stuffed with chunks of lobster. It wasn't some lobster mash, either - there were big, visble hunks of meat.Atmospherically, Ciao Bella is cozy and intimate in a way that makes you forget that you're in a strip mall. The lights are dim, and when I was there for week day dinner, there were plenty of couples on dates. It's casual enough for a regular dinner but special enough for an important dinner.The restaurant is a also larger than it seems from the outside. There's plenty of seating in the dining room, bar and on the twinkle-lit patio."], ["David P.", "I enjoy pizza, \u00a0Ciao Bella has a damn good one. \u00a0I ordered the Piccante 12\"($15) and added jalapenos($1). \u00a0 The Blue Moon beer went down well with this awesome pizza. \u00a0Too bad I live in Atlanta and can't enjoy this sweet find more often. \u00a0I sat outside on a beautiful day, the waiter Christopher was attentive but not annoying. \u00a0A well spent $21."]], "Marciano": [], "Carrabba's": [["J Penelope Walkininit S.", "We went to the wine tasting last week and it was fabulous, the Wulfe mahi was really good.

It needed sugar, which he brought me. The bread they bring before the meal was sooo good and soft. I could have eaten a loaf by myself. I ordered a small portion of Chicken Parmesan. It was amazing! I made the mistake of getting garlic mashed potatoes as my side instead of the pasta. The potatoes still had the skin which I can't stand. Luckily my mom had some noodles she was willing to share. I would totally recommend the chicken parm. I ate every bite!! Our server kinda started to lack around the time our food came out. We noticed him standing around talking to other servers.

Once we got seated, our waiter was efficient, although we did have to remind him once about our wine/beer order. He brought out the fried cheese sticks, and they seemed a little over-done to me - almost bordering on burned.

The meals everyone got seemed to please all - my pork tenderloin was a little crispy (sensing a theme here - a little to much heat in the kitchen)....but the saut\u00e9ed spinach was cooked perfectly, great flavor and cooked just right.

During this time, the oil was poured but the bread didn't come out for another 30 minutes and then, after another wait, the soup/salads came out at basically the same time. All told, we were there nearly two hours, not counting the wait after our ostensible reservation time. I enjoyed my food (the Marsala sauce was excellent and the vegetables and soup were surprisingly good), but my dining companions' orders were much less impressive. The calamari felt like someone had squeezed fried goo onto fish-flavored goo. The pizza was compared unfavorably to the cardboard box that a pizza might come in and was left mostly uneaten.

So we went after church this past Sunday. There was no waiting to be seated, however, I did not like being placed by the door on a cool Sunday afternoon.

Okay, so if i am going to have to wait 45 minutes for the food, then it better be good. \u00a0I was sorely disappointed. \u00a0I was told by others that it was good. \u00a0Apparently, they told their friends because there was still a wait at 9 pm. \u00a0Sorry, i digress, back to the food. \u00a0The menu is extensive and they have daily specials also. \u00a0The more unusual items offered includes lamb chops with mint bourbon demi glaze and spiedino de mare (scallops and shrimp in italian breadcrumbs with lemon butter sauce). \u00a0They have wood fired pizzas also for about 10 bucks. \u00a0I chose on this night to try a special--veal and sage ravioli in a brown sage butter sauce. \u00a0As most entrees do here, it comes with a choice of soup or salad. \u00a0I chose an Italian salad. \u00a0It was sadly lacking. \u00a0It was devoid of any flavor except oil and the salt from the two olives. \u00a0 There was no bite to the salad as far as flavor. The Caesar salad my fiance has was slightly better. \u00a0Again the Caesar dressing was on the thin side and had a hint of anchovy goodness. \u00a0I think if i go back that the soup would be a better option. \u00a0Honestly, the Olive Garden has better Italian salad. \u00a0As for the main entree, the veal ravioli special was favorful and almost too rich with the sage butter sauce. \u00a0My fiance had the linguine pescatore with mussels,shrimp, scallops in a marinara sauce \u00a0The menu said a spicy marinara. \u00a0I wouldn't say it was spicy. \u00a0It was just a simple tomato sauce, really spare maybe thinned out with a white white and some vinegar or lemon acid. \u00a0 It has a bite but not a spicy one per se. \u00a0 The complimentary bread was interesting. \u00a0it was a round crusted with lots of garlic. The crusty is slightly chewy and the inside was doughy and reminded me of a biscuit in texture. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0If you are on a date and you eat the bread, you might want to grab some mints on your way out the door. \u00a0As for dessert, we didn't have room for any. \u00a0The tiramisu looked interesting as well as a butter cake with fruits. \u00a0The service was sufficient. \u00a0However, having now eaten there, i still don't understand why they have a wait because the food is overpriced and not that tasty."]], "Fratelli's In the Garden": [["Vim I.", "What a great place to have lunch when the weather is pretty!

Although some of the potatoes were crunchy, the dish itself was very good. Oh, and the Fratelli Tea with Raspberry and Peach flavoring was a compliment to the meal.There were so many intriguing choices that I was hard pressed - but extremely pleased - to choose the Siena Chicken Panni. In fact, I will likely go back again simply to try my other choices - Chicken Cordon Bleu, Cubana, Porcheria and more, including their fresh salads.The fact that they are also part of Project Green Fork was not only encouraging to see, but it also explained why the food was so fresh and delicious.Seriously, if you have not been to this \"hidden treasure\" of culinary delight you need to go and check them out.

There were puppies everywhere and they climbed all over me when I sat down.

Some friends encouraged us to try the place a few months ago, and I can't believe that we have been missing out for so long. Probably the closest we might have here in Memphis to true NYC style pizza, Little Italy's pies consist of a delicious crispy crust, an excellent red sauce and fresh toppings of your choice. The crust totally makes this pizza. I like Garibaldi's sauce a tiny bit more so this is the only reason they still top my list over Little Italy. The place is really small, so we usually call in and order and my husband will pick up for us. Not sure if they have delivery, but it is definitely worth the drive."], ["Paul C.", "Tried it again, except this time I got pepperoni. \u00a0I still think the cheese and sauce need help, BUT the pepperoni was awesome! \u00a0Definitely more than made up for the taste deficiency in the rest of the ingredients. \u00a0Crust was still great. \u00a0I will definitely come back when I get a craving for decent NY style pizza, although I still think it's a bit steep that it's around 17.50 tax included for a large one topping."], ["Brendan G.", "Tried Little Italy last night for the first time. The food was excellent. As a NY native, I really know good pizza and the places that have \"actual pizza\" are far and few between anywhere in the South.

My only complaint about the meal was that they \u00a0used precooked meatballs and you could definitely taste that. However, they did not screw you on the amount they gave you. That was my only gripe and the only reason why I did not give them 5 stars. The staff was very friendly and I am going to be a frequent customer over there now.

The meat on the Reuben was very chewy and I couldn't cut my half sandwich in half without it going everywhere. They did pile it with meat and the bread was nice and toasty, served with lettuce, onion, tomato, and a pickle all on the side. The salad was actually an unlimited amount of trips through the salad bar. Salad bar: Incredibly clean and wonderfully fresh. Lots of veggies to choose from and a really amazing tuna salad. The salad bar was by far my favorite. Hot tea: The server brought out a tea basket of different assortments of flavors to choose from. Also came with a very cute bottle of honey. The hot tea was delicious!My lunch guest had the full ham and cheese sandwich plus a trip through the salad bar. His sand-which was big and came with fries.

Overall the food was good, but the main dish that really stood out was the brisket. The brisket was juicy, just fatty enough, and was not overpowered by a ton of sauce--paired with a delicious creamy mashed potato. Everything else was good, but not particularly special. The croquettes were good, but there wasn't much salmon or salmon flavor present. It was more like a really good hushpuppy. The dessert bar was a hit.

After pondering over good restaurants in Memphis for lunch, at last minute, as I was searching through places in Cooper Young, I came upon this little gem. I had seen it earlier by walking around and remembered the menu sparked an interest. So I thought, why not give it a try?I had in company my lovely mom who agreed to dine with me wherever of my choosing. When I told her I decided on Strano, she was definitely open to a new restaurant experience as well. However it was a sweltering saturday which left the restaurant dead empty except one other party of two, but that did not drive us away.Now onto the restaurant itself.We were greeted to what I assumed was \u00a0ust a person to show us to our table, but ended up to be our waiter for the day. He approached us with a smile but didn't quite warm up to us yet that is until we asked for lemon water. When he came back out with a dish of lemons, my mom commented on how big they were which happened to break the ice with him which then he seemed to be much more comfortable and discussed how they had just got them in and that they were too, the biggest lemons he'd seen. After I ordered a fennel salad with grilled shrimp, and my mom, the margarita pizza, he presented us a warm basket of complimentary bread and an infused olive oil with a variety of herbs and spices. Once we unfolded the napkin from the bread basket, I could already tell this was going to be great bread. I was right. It had the most wonderful charred, but not burnt crust to the outside and a soft hearty texture to the inside. When you dipped a piece of bread in the olive oil, this made the perfect moment when it just melts in your mouth. I have named this the best complimentary bread in town. Three pieces of bread later, (with no regrets) our food came out. My salad was very clean and organized looking, while my mom's pizza looked great, although a slight bigger than advertised as a \"personal pizza\" in both our opinions. The salad was so refreshing but a factor of choosing this salad was that it was presumed with more toppings and most I could see besides the shrimp was just oranges and onions. I would have appreciated more dates but I took what I got. Besides that, the shrimp were grilled to perfection and when you got a bite of everything, it was a taste sensation! My mom seemed to enjoy her pizza quite a bit although commenting on the portions a few times. The mozzarella tasted so fresh and we were notified by our waiter that both the tomato sauce and the pizza crust are homemade which was quite impressive. Overall it was a great meal, and we thought we had ended on a great meal...That is before he came out with the dessert menu!I honestly couldn't resist, there was a wide selection but after going back and forth on the vanilla gelato and the lemon sorbet, I fell for the lemon sorbet as a perfect ending to a hot day and a nice experience. When he came back, it was a beautiful presentation of the clean sorbet topped with chopped mint and an artistic rose shaved from the rind of a lemon all in a shell of frozen lemon skin itself. My, it was the most perfect blend of both tart and sweet and accompanied by the mint was a great addition. I just might have taken home the frozen rose too! He even offered to give us a cup of it to go! Since we had more than half of the pizza left, he got it boxed up for us, and we left. I must admit, I enjoyed the entire rest of the pizza that night and it was even Strano standards after being re-heated in the oven! I can't wait to go back for more!

It's was delicious, but I'm not sure it was 30 dollars worth of delicious. Here's another biggie. The smoke. I'm not sure if something was going on in the kitchen, but I about gauged my eyes out. I noticed the smoke from the get-go, but it wasn't until the last 20 minutes that my eyes really started to burn. I would love to explore their menu a little more, but that smoke was a big drawback.

This also happened the last time I was there (first tasted different than the second), so I say with confidence the cocktails are a mixed bag...always good, but ordering the same drink doesn't mean it's going to taste the same.Food!: The ravioli - delish - always. It changes daily but we got it both times and yummm! We got the half order for an app. I ordered the branzino because the person at the adjacent table ordered it last time and it looked beautiful, and it was highly recommended by the server. It was full of bones - one that stabbed me quite heartily in my mouth, so I gave up half way and just ate the sides - risotto and asparagus were good. The skin wasn't crispy, the fish was alright...I just didn't get it. We also ordered the chicken parmesan ($17) but the waiter made a face when my date ordered it and said it was plain and \"meh.\" He then recommended either the tenderloin ($28) or the steak - it felt he was pushing for a tip... The chicken parmesan was good. The chicken was huge!! But I wasn't a fan of the spaghetti with it. I dunno, if I pay $75 for a meal plus tip, I just want a bit more.

I got a veggie slice, my wife got a pepperoni slice and we got our son a cheese slice. The cheese slice barely had any cheese on it, the pepperoni slice had dried and congealed cheese on it and the veggie slice was very soggy with chunks of artichoke heart weighing it down, and all the slices were cold.The size and style of the slice is like a New York slice, so you expect it to be foldable but still maintain its ability to stay intact. When I folded my slice, the bottom of it tore and flopped to the side, spilling artichoke hearts and olives off of the pizza. The crust was soggy, cold and flavorless. I hope this was just an off day for them and not a true representation of how their pizza normally is, because if so then this place will close like the 4 or 5 other places in its spot that have closed over the past 10 years.I would have given it a 2-star if the price of individual slices were a little bit lower."], ["Phil M.", "Amazing Italian fare.

Oh price is about medium. $10 to $20 for most things, with few below $10."], ["Ken R.", "Hog and Hominy serves a hybrid of Italian and Southern dishes, specializing in pizza and small plates. In my opinion, the restaurant is a combination of a classic pizzeria like Aldo's Pizza Pies and a Southern eatery (McEwen's comes to mind). Hog & Hominy has a unique menu that demonstrates the creativity of the owners, such as beef heart with Vidalia kimchee, and biscuit gnocchi, something that sounds wacky (as in Foghorn Leghorn meeting the Mario Brothers) but is probably very good. In venturing into the menu, I got the Buffalo Pork Tails, which is an offshoot of traditional buffalo wings. Compared to them, the nuggets of pig tail are just as savory as wings from places like Kelvin's Hot Wings (which moved to Millington, news that should have been issued through its Twitter account). The sauce has a nice balance of peppery spices and vinegar for a moderately spicy taste that is very good. The pig tail is garnished with shreds of celery leaves and fried pig ears that has the same texture and taste of bacon. It seems like the guys at Hog and Hominy have some \"black\" in them when it comes to making the most out of what they have. Now before you accuse me of playing the dreaded \"race card,\" what I'm saying is that Hog and Hominy are adhering to the \"Soul Food\" tradition of using unconventional pieces of meat (as in scraps similar to what African-American slaves ate) to make dishes that are not only palatable, but delicious. It's this kind of creativity that separates Hog and Hominy from most restaurants and will probably be the foundation for its long-term success.After having the Buffalo Pork Tails, I moved on to the main course, the pizza. I didn't know what I wanted, even after reading reviews on Foursquare and Urbanspoon (it folded into Zomato, which isn't blogger-friendly). I was at a loss on what to order even though most recommended The Red Eye. In a leap of faith, I settled on The Prewitt because it had something that I never had before, boudin sausage. Generally, most boudin consists of pork (I know what you're thinking, \"duh\") but beyond that, other ingredients depend on where you get it. Assuming that the sausage was made in-house (or at Porcellino's, Andrew and Michael's butcher shop that's adjacent to the restaurant) with locally sourced ingredients, my guess is that the boudin has pork liver, rice and pork heart stuffed in it. Boudin in the United States (especially in Louisiana) has that combination along with seasoning for added flavor. Bottom line, the boudin (along with the Fortina cheese) stood out in the brick oven-cooked pizza that I enjoyed every bite of. The pizza also has scrambled eggs on it, but the boudin was so good that I barely noticed anything else on the pizza. Overall, The Prewitt is an outstanding pizza that I want to have again.After having a well-rounded meal at Hog and Hominy, I left with a great impression of the place. Given what I had, I'm confident in saying that the restaurant is excellent and I recommend it to anyone looking for an awesome culinary experience. The menu is creative and utilizes locally sourced meats and vegetables to provide high quality meals to its customers. To go along with the food, the restaurant has an extensive alcohol menu for those who enjoy their libations. That includes a beer selection that excludes domestics like Bud Light and Pabst Blue Ribbon in favor of premium craft brews (I started off with an Abita Andygator that gave me a really nice buzz). Overall, Hog and Hominy is an awesome restaurant and if you haven't been there yet, you are missing out.

It's primarily a gourmet pizzeria, really, with some smaller appetizer/tapas-esque dishes to round things out. The pizzas are fine. They're more akin to the east coast thin-crust variety than the Chicagoan deep-dish type, although the crust is a little more chewy and bread-like than you'd find anywhere in the NY tristate area. We ordered the most peculiar-looking pizza we could identify and were pleasantly surprised by the combination of flavors. It's also clear that they cook these pizzas fairly quickly and at high heat, so you should go in expecting a little ash.We also had crab legs, which were swimming in butter and quite tasty.Dessert came as a peanut butter pie, which tasted like it came from a box, and some vanilla gelato which tasted like slightly melted ice cream.So nothing was really offensive other than the total price, which was gratuitously expensive for the quality of the meal.If the bartender could get his own review, however, he'd get a five.

Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. With a peanut and jalapeno-cilantro flavoring, it tasted like spicy chicken tenders. Also had the brussels sprouts (good but a little heavy on the bacon chili jam, which ironically, was what drew me to them) and octopus, which was chewy and not the best I have ever had (try City House in Nashville - Chef Tandy Wilson knows how to prepare octopus). However, the star of the night was the Inchio pizza with squid ink skordalia and sausage. This was my first time trying anything with squid ink, and I found the flavor to be rich and complimentary with the other flavors in the pizza. Reservations are highly recommended, as it's a small but warm and intimate space. We also had great, friendly service, and this is a place I'd return on another trip to the area."], ["Jay B.", "We sought out Hog & Hominy while visiting Memphis after hearing they had one of the top 10 rated burgers in the US presently - although the restaurant has a focus on wood fired oven pizzas. While I would have liked to try the burger, the server indicated that the kitchen wouldn't modify the burger to suit my dietary needs (something I've never had problems with at any other restaurant or burger place previously). The explanation was that it was an award winning burger and so it wouldn't be modified. What a load of outrageously arrogant bs. Last time I checked, I was the customer and the service of food in a restaurant is supposed to be about my satisfaction - not gratifying the chef's ego. Had I not been traveling with family I probably would have gone to another establishment - there are plenty to choose from nearby to Hog & Hominy. This issue aside, two in our party did get to try the burger and they did enjoy it. (They didn't, however, think it was the best burger they'd ever had.) The desserts really did steal the show - plapple crumble (a combination of plum and apple) and Carol's Delightful Smile (a chocolate mouse pie with Oreo crust topped with whopper pieces). They were outstanding! Based on food quality, taste, presentation, service and ambiance alone (setting aside the arrogant one-size-fits all approach of the kitchen in respect of the burger) I would be rating the restaurant as 4 stars. But obviously my rating has to reflect the entirety of the experience."], ["Renetria D.", "New menu new pizzas The Thunderbird 40 twice is delish.. Yummy pepperoni drizzled with honey it's divine...

You can't play dinner roulette in Memphis without someone mentioning Hog and Hominy and everyone exploding with glittery and glowing comments about how great the food is. While the food is enjoyable, I just don't feel like I've ever had a meal here that would make me feel like a terrible Memphian if i didn't continuously shout that experience from the rooftops. The inside of the restaurant looks like Tom Sawyer just tricked the whole gang into whitewashing the the place. Everything is white and glass and covered in mass-produced corporate ornamentation of what people think \"fancy\" Southerners display in their homes. It seriously looks like Pier One threw up in here. It's also fairly small inside with enough room \u00a0for a handful of tables and only a few spots at the bar. It is cool, though, \u00a0to be able to look into the pizza baking area and the kitchen and see the chefs throwing together some unique dishes. To be fair, I've never had a bad meal at Hog and Hominy. I've had several of the dishes, and all of them have been tasty, if somewhat....underwhelming. The food isn't underwhelming because it's not good and (executed to perfection), but just because of the unrelenting hype you hear about this place. I do enjoy the fact that they have a significant cocktail menu and a rotating seasonal menu. The menu, the staff, and the restaurant all deserve most of the accolades they are receiving and I am glad that people love the place.

The brunch is described as a Sunday Jazz Brunch. \u00a0It says \"Enjoy the music of the incredibly talented pianist, Jon Felix.\" \u00a0It would have been nice to know this music would be enjoyed via CD. \u00a0I'm sorry but, in this gal's book, you cannot call your brunch a \"Jazz\" brunch if you are simply piping a CD of some performer through your loud speakers. \u00a0Onto the food. \u00a0We arrived at noon- the brunch starts at 11- and everything on the \"hot side\" of the buffet was luke warm at best. \u00a0I cannot imagine how irate my husband would have been had we gotten there any later, as that food had to have been downright cold. \u00a0At $12 bucks a head, that ain't okay. \u00a0The fruit salad was good, as was the bacon. \u00a0The only stand out item was the pasta with red sauce and sausage. It was the clear winner and makes me want to return for dinner options in the future. They serve up a lobster hash, which actually has huge chunks of fresh lobster and potatoes with various veggies sauteed into the mixture as well. \u00a0The potatoes were mealy and the lobster was rubbery. \u00a0It was a shame because this dish seemed as if it had been \u00a0prepared for one single person, it would have been delicious. \u00a0For the masses? \u00a0Not so much. \u00a0That is the problem with Spindini's Jazz Brunch. \u00a0They do not have the capability of serving a buffet. \u00a0There is no line of hot lights, there are only large, tin, mess-hall looking trays floating in hot water with tea lights underneath. \u00a0It seriously ruins the food.There are some ala carte options on the brunch menu, they will make them as you order. \u00a0Which is the way I suggest you go if you decide to partake in this brunch. \u00a0We were sorely disappointed in this place. \u00a0It was a Holiday Inn buffet, and the price was too high for what they were cooking up. \u00a0The service was great, our waiter was wonderful, attentive and friendly. \u00a0I will definitely be back to try the dinner menu. \u00a0There has to be something I missed given the rave reviews I've heard of Spindini."], ["Shauna M.", "I came here with a larger sized group on a Friday for a friend's birthday. \u00a0The place was pretty empty for a Friday after 7:30, but the inside is nice. \u00a0Our server was friendly, but we had to ask if there were specials, and that's when he told us the off the menu items. \u00a0We also had to ask for more silverware and plates, he'd leave quickly when some of us wanted drink refills and we had some dirty wine glasses. \u00a0I had the eggplant rollatini, which our server recommended. \u00a0When I was eating I thought this tastes good, but its still. \u00a0I wanted something lighter and it was breaded and fried, which it did not say on the menu and every other place I've had this dish it was baked with no breading. \u00a0I think the filling and the sauce were lacking on herbs (though I find myself saying this every place I go to since moving to Memphis). \u00a0Most of the group had pizza, especially the lobster one which they raved about the flavor combination of the chipotle sauce and lobster being unexpected, but good.

I've been here a lot and I've watched the restaurant through ups and downs ever since its been open.This is a pretty recent acquisition for the Preston Lamm collection of establishments. While sitting at the bar, here is what I observed.Why is the Head/Executive Chef wandering around the front of the house. Then I see him expediting pizza?Good pizza that are so thin that they seem like flatbreads. Well executed. Far better than the quasi Southern Italian of the previous proprietor. Good bar staff. Why is the chef constantly \"on display\" while good, consistent, well executed food flows from the kitchen? Is it \"Good Italian\" - nope. Spindini wouldn't last a week in Chicago or NYC. Best in Memphis? Nope, that's Andrew Michael.I ordered a Caprese sa lad. Decent mozzarella, hard as nails tomatoes (early in the season, but really no excuse). Gigantic basil leaves (come on! Have you EVER heard of chiffonade? Its easy, looks elegant & doesn't overwhelm your palate and the other flavors. This is pretty damn basic).It's nice to have your own farm (and they do have one in Holly Springs, MS) but you can buy perfect heirloom tomatoes at the Memphis Farmers Market (two blocks away) that your customers would rave over for $5/lb retail (which is a ton compared to what they would pay wholesale) OR you can serve hard, unready tomatoes from ground you own in N Mississippi. Hummmm.Pizzas are consistently good. The Lobster Pizza is outstanding.The menu is good, not great. Does anyone really care about \"My Grandmothers Salad\"? Screw the \"Kissed By The Flame\" stuff on the menu. The oven is heated by burning natural wood. I like it. But it's not unique. It's been done in Peoria, IL for 25+ years for goodness sakes!I also tried something that is pretty scary outside of big time Italian restaurants in my experience...\"Parmesan Risotto\".Is it great? No. Reasonable? Absolutely! Worth $6 as a side? Yepper. It's wonderful just to get a pretty damn good risotto on Memphis.I keep comparing Italian cooking here in Memphis to the big times in NYC & Chicago- & that is not fair. Memphis, as much as I love it, doesn't understand big time Italian food. Love the bar, the staff is outstanding. Nice place to hang.That's all that's needed."], ["Paul K.", "Decor was nice inside, and the restaurant was actually pretty crowded for Memphis standards.

However, the service this evening was horrendous! Jamie was our server, and at first I just thought that he wasn't the best (very limited knowledge of wine) but I thought that he was competent. However, my salad did not arrive with my parents. This would have been no biggie had he come to check on us, but he had not come by nor had my salad arrived by the time they were almost done. We flagged someone else down and they took care of it. However, when Jamie came back to clear their plates (he inexplicably did not take mine) he offered no excuse or apologies. He then began to cop an attitude, telling us that all we had to do was call for him...um, I've waited tables before and I'm pretty sure that it was my job to check on the tables not for them to yell out my name at a restaurant! The food was great; however, our server once again copped an attitude when we didn't buy into his \"upsale\" for dessert or coffee...he proceeded to tell us that it was in his job description. My parents and I are both exceedingly polite and forgiving or wait staff. I waited tables for years as did my sister; my parents know proper protocol and have heard every nightmare table story in the book. This type of service is never forgivable, but it is at least understandable if the place is packed or someone is covering multiple sections-not the case. In my book when I screw up, I apologize and make it right. I certainly don't cop an attitude with the table I've screwed up because they asked for what they ordered. On a complete side note, if it is Spindini's policy to instruct waiters to upsell desserts and coffee at the end of the meal, they should stop. This is the type of thing that I expect at Chili's, not a nice independent restaurant. Offer a dessert menu, if declined ask if the table is ready for a check. I am an adult...I will let you know if I want another glass of wine, dessert, or coffee."], ["marcus r.", "I read the the reviews. \u00a0Took everything into consideration, and decided to go. Every thing started great. We arrived an hour early to sit at the bar and have a cocktail and an appetizer. Kasey had the Spindini Martini, and highly recommends it. It's their twist on a pomegranate martini. Being a man of simple tastes, I had a Blantons, neat. The pour was shallow, hardly acceptable for $12. We also sampled the house sangria they have sitting on the bar. The red was palatable, Kasey loved the white. A little sweet for me, but far better than the red. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza. By far the highlight of the meal. We should have stopped there. We moved to a table and ordered dinner. The wedge salad was like everyone elses. Nothing special. The tomatoes and mozzarella could have been better for a place that claims to use their own organically grown vegetables. The vinaigrette is only salad oil and red wine vinegar. The server was slow and hardly attentive. We saw her when she \u00a0took the order, when she brought the food, and when she brought the check. The chicken parmesan was thin and very dry. Served atop overcooked angelhair. The halibut was dry, and the spinach, while plentiful, was overcooked. I don't know why the menu lists sides without the prices, most of the entrees do not come with a side. The mashed potatoes were old and the risotto was mushy. The server and the manager must have sensed all was not well, because at the end of the meal he brought the check over and expressed he sensed they dropped the ball. He comped the entire meal, except the halibut. I should mention that our reservation was at ten and they close at eleven for what its worth. Btw...they didn't even offer us dessert!
