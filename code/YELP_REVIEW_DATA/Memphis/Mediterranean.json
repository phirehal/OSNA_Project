Our waitress, Alex, was awesome and let us sub in angel hair pasta on both our dishes. And the bread and pesto was ridiculously awesome, but our meals were not. We got the Chicken Alfredo and the Pollo al Diablo. The alfredo was bland and the diablo was overpowered. We also got the cheesecake, which I thought actually tasted better without the fruit.

Didn't want to risk the bland flavors and whatnot I'd heard described on here cause I was on a date!Anyways, the crab cakes are amazing--they're super creative and Mediterranean... it was so good. \u00a0And then we just went for some serious classics: shrimp fettuccine alfredo and veal saltimbocca. \u00a0A+The service was kind but a little confused. \u00a0However, he came around frequently to take good care of us. \u00a0And the atmosphere is very nice. \u00a0It's the kinda place you go for a hidden, off-the-beaten-path kinda chill experience. \u00a0Will definitely go back.Oh yeah, and wear whatever you want--it could be construed as a dressy place but wear casual if you feel like it--they're friendly and can use the business! \u00a0GO!"], ["Joelle P.", "A-OK sums it up pretty correctly. This place has been on my bookmark list forever so when my mom asked to meet Drew for the first time I thought this would be a cool place to do it. It is in East Memphis, has pretty good reviews, and most importantly - I hadn't been. Apparently that last reasoning did not sit well with them though. Drew was thinking Folk's Folly and my mom was thinking Erling Jensen's. They wanted a place they knew was dynamite - oops. I made a reservation for 3 at 7:00 for Sunday night but when we pulled up, we were the only car in the parking lot. And we remained the only people in the restaurant until an elderly couple walking around 8:00. I know this place has been open for a few years so I'm assuming they get more traffic on other nights...but it was kinda weird and awkward being the only ones in there. For appetizers, I ordered the antipasta plate that was bland and not all that good but my mom was obsessed with the mussels and Drew loved his lobster bisque. I just ate the cheese off my plate. And for dinner, they enjoyed their rack of lamb and quail. (Aren't they fancy? ha) while I liked my chicken parmesan but it wasn't anything to write home about. I didn't finish it so asked for a to go box and was annoyed when I came home to find my dinner and appetizer stuffed in the same box. (It didn't exactly go together.)I have to agree with Barrett R on the decor. The outside of the restaurant, which is nice, certainly didn't match the inside. The interior is extremely dark and what you would expect to find in a restaurant in a strip mall. When you see the building outside you immediately expect the interior to match and be new, upscale, even slightly pretentious (and two stories?). But the dining room is plain. There is no crown molding and it is just...blah. I keep trying to think of how to describe it but it is nondescript. That would actually be my biggest recommendation is to make the dining room more memorable. If you're paying over $20 for your entree, I think the restaurant should have some charm.

My boyfriend and I went here for a nice date night, and we got the chef's antipasti platter sampler, which was amazing. A great start! Then he ordered the crab cake appetizer along with a chicken ceaser salad for his dinner. I ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta. The crab cakes were really rather small, and they had a lot of tomatoes in them, which is unusual, I think. For $14, they were really tiny, and the breading was thin and kind of soggy. He said the salad was okay, and they did give a lot of chicken, which was nice. My meal was $23, and I got 7 shrimp, the meat of 3 lobster claws and a tiny helping of angel hair pasta. The shrimp were amazing, but the lobster was horrendously overcooked- near inedible. And I was incredibly disappointed with how little pasta I was given. I guess I had Olive Gardens generous helpings in my mind, and that's what I was expecting. It was barely a single serving of angel hair. Our bill was $70 ($45 with the 25 off), and it was really pretty disappointing. Absolutely not worth their high prices. The service was good, and the restaurant was pretty empty the whole time we were there, and we went at 7pm on a Saturday night, which was surprising to see only 3 other groups in the restaurant. Overall, I wouldn't go back, simply because their high prices do not match the quality or quantity of their food."], ["Charles F.", "I have been passing Marciano's for years.

I had the Wednesday fish and rice special. I'm not sure what I was expecting - maybe a tilapia fillet on a bed of rice - but what I got was way better: a halved, mostly-whole fish (it was headless and gutless) topped with tomatoes and onions and a giant plate of rice. It was seriously some of the best fish I've ever had. The meat, especially under the bones - was perfectly moist and tender. The plate of rice it came with was massive. And while I ate most of it, it would have been plenty of food for two not-quite-so-hungry people.I tried the hummus, too. It was excellent - fresh, dripping with olive oil, and a much larger portion than the $4.99 pricetag would suggest.After dinner, I spent about 10 minutes in front of the big bakery counter. The friendly woman behind the counter was incredibly patient with all of my questions about the treats. I wound up with two big pieces of baklava (the best I've had in the city), cream filled phyllo rolls, and a sweet cheese square covered in soft, shredded phyllo.Middle East Bakery is open daily until about 8 p.m. (we got there at 7:30, and they were closing up when we left).

I have been here repeatedly for the fresh pastries and dolmas and on several dates. I love the food, but the service and the atmosphere is little to be desired, therefore, I would suggest getting your food to go."], ["Thomas G.", "To be honest, I was a little frustrated when reading the comments that gave minimal stars on this restaurant. \u00a0Why go to a Middle Eastern restaurant in the first place? Because, you want to try something different. You want to taste and experience Middle Eastern Cuisine/Culture. \u00a0 Bottom-line: This is a really fantastic restaurant if you desire an \"authentic\" Middle Eastern experience and food. \u00a0How do you know it is \"authentic\"? Let me explain: I am in the military, active duty and have served in multiple deployments/tours to the Middle East and Afghanistan. During my service in the Middle East, I have sampled multiple dishes and cultural cuisine in the following countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Iraq. Because of this experience, I can honestly tell you if the restaurant is considered a great authentic Middle Eastern restaurant or not.Restaurant Cuisine: Flat Bread is an important part of the Middle Eastern meal. This restaurant has some of the best bread I have tasted this side of the ocean. It is made fresh weekly by a Middle Eastern lady who sells it to the store. You can also purchase 6-8 loaves in a package which I recommend. Humus (chick peas): \u00a0This restaurant makes it fresh and there is a certain amazing taste when humus is made fresh and olive oil is incorporated. \u00a0Speaking of olive oil, the restaurant owner uses Sultan Olive Oil which is a favorite in many Middle Eastern Restaurants.Falafels: Absolutely outstanding, some of the best falafels I have tried. \u00a0Because falafels are deep friend chick peas, it is served piping hot. Recommend caution before diving in. Baba Ghanoush (egg plant): Also very good. I recommend requesting half Humus/half baba ghanoush as an appetizer. Main Dish: Personally, I love the Chicken Kabobs. It is served with grilled tomatoes, raw onions, and a lemon. Please ask the restaurant owner to bring you some lemon juice. The main dish is a large portion size. If you want to enjoy it the way it is eaten overseas, recommend tearing off a piece of bread. Put a piece of chicken, some grill tomato and raw onion, wrapping it like a small pita. Then add some lemon juice to it and enjoy! This is traditionally how this is eaten.Restaurant Ambiance: This restaurant is simple and basic: chairs, tables, menus, and a few pictures of Iraq on the walls. As Americans, we are spoiled in our concept of what ambiance is supposed to look like. If you travel to the Middle East, you will find that this restaurant is pretty darn authentic. You don't have to travel thousands of miles to see what an authentic Middle Eastern restaurant is suppose to look like: it is here in Memphis! \u00a0 Restaurant Service: Again, take off your American glasses and enjoy the Middle Eastern experience. It's a slow process because it is made fresh. We are so use to hurry up, give me service and food now. That is not the Middle Eastern culture. \u00a0 Dessert: Recommend the walnut baklava which is really delicious with some Turkish coffee. \u00a0One final note, the owner and his family are from Baghdad, Iraq and escaped the tyranny of Saddam Hussein's rule."], ["Todd J.", "Went by here cause I bought a groupon, I was surprised !!The kabob w rice was good and the chicken was terrific. decent service, not too long wait time.

I asked how big the sandwich was, since, even though everyone raves about how big this sandwich is, the photos always make it look so small, and I'm a pretty big eater. But believe me when say this thing is the largest sandwich you will ever eat, if you get the whole. I got the half and definitely could have downed another quarter, but there's no way I could have gotten through a whole.It took a while to cook, but by the time I got home and unwrapped it, it was so worth it. Ham, salami, provolone, olive goodness, tomatoes, and who knows what else, all surrounded by a toasted bread that, surprisingly, didn't turn to a soggy wet mess, which alone is worth five stars. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've had in a few years.The staff was pretty great, too.

If I were to rate this just on the food, I would immediately give this a five star rating. However, the grumpy, and potentially hungover man, was behind the counter with a sketchy order on a receipt which deemed the service underwhelming. However the very Korean women that has to trusts that you say what you ordered at the cash register seemed fine, but again, very Korean. I see this place maybe better for to go? Anyway, we did find a nice seat at the counter out looking Madison Avenue. Also, it might have been just an off day for service. After a tediously long wait for our food, our falafel platter showed up. This included nicely seasoned pita bread, falafel pieces, hummus, and taziki dip. I did enjoy this very much meanwhile staying away from the taziki dip which isn't my favorite, but was informed it was tangy good. Then came out our steaming bowl of our chicken Bi Bim Bap bowl! It was really hot so don't even try touching the bowl which helps it to continue to cook while you're eating it! Even though it was hot in both spiciness and temperature, it was filled with depths of other flavor. I enjoyed how all of the components came together and found my cravings fulfilled. Since the rice is on the bottom of the hot bowl, it sort of chars and sticks to the bottom. However, I loved how the char gave it a slight crisp sweetness and found myself scraping the bottom for more! The hummus was great to eat in between to give the spice a break as well. I was surprised on how fulfilling it was, so don't worry about being hungry after you leave!

They offer several different sandwich options that are completely out of this world, not to mention the BEST muffaletta sandwich that you've ever put in your mouth.One of the main attractions, however, is the Bi Bim Bop, which is a Korean dish that is outstanding. You can get your Bi Bim Bop in three different iterations: beef, chicken, or tofu. I have always gone with the chicken option, because that's what I like. However, I don't think that you could go wrong with any selection. If you have not tried this dish before and you think that it is outside of your level of adventure, do yourself a favor, and try it. You will not be disappointed!You will not be impressed by the interior or exterior of this establishment, as it is an old convenience store/gas station. However, do not be dissuaded by the appearance of this place. You are about to eat one of the best sandwiches, Bi Bim Bop, or other Greek (yes I said Greek!) dishes that you have ever tasted. \u00a0While you're at it, feel free to grab a bag of chips, a cold beer, or one of the other assorted drinks and appetizers that are offered in one of the cold cases around the store.Do not sell yourself short.

That was a terrible sign. And sorry, I do know about Middle Eastern food since a good chunk of my family comes from Lebanon.

It didn't look that intimidating on the plate, but there's no way I could've finished it. It was delicious, and I think especially together - I've never seen that presentation elsewhere. Two of your favorites, better together! It's served with a couple pita breads and two sauces. The first is a jalapeno-feta sauce which the waitress admonished was very spicy so I should be careful. The second was a mango-something sauce. She said that I should \"have fun and make sandwiches\". cute...That jalapeno sauce was awesome. I got a little carried away with it, despite the warning, because it was that good. The mango sauce tasted mostly like mayonnaise, but was good for cooling my tongue after overdoing the hot sauce. I also had the \"best tea in memphis (iced)\". I couldn't decide if I really loved it or I really thought it tasted like dish soap, but I went ahead and had another glass anyway. Lastly, since I had read the reviews, I knew that I could not leave without trying the chocolate mousse. oh my word...for a mere $3, they bring you a bowl the size of a cereal bowl full of chocolate mousse. it's delicious. it's not overstated. you HAVE to try it. service was kind of slow, even when they weren't full, but very pleasant and prompt once you have their attention. the ambiance is lovely, especially the lighting. oh also the pricing is REALLY reasonable. especially for what you get. i actually felt like, compared to other dinners I've had in the area, like the prices were below average."], ["Gadafi A.", "They have excellent service even when they are busy and rushing themselves.

The beef & lamb Shawerma (Shawarma?) was tasty. The small mezza combo was a lot less impressive looking than the big one. I felt that the reduction in size and variety was more drastic than the price difference between the big ($19) and the small ($8). The hummus I had last time was very pasty. The baba ghanoush was not very smoky. The falafels were small and unremarkable. \u00a0On one occasion the pita bread served on the side was hard and dry.

I have to say that I felt he was a bit condescending. I'd hate to think that it was because I was black man with a hi-top fade and clearly a first-timer in the restaurant (i.e. indecisive, asking questions).

She said \"Well, everything's already ready back there.\" Um... red flag number three, but I started eating anyway.Just a few more minutes later, my waiter came saying \"beef and lamb? Egyptian Hawashi?\" I looked up horrified. It seemed that one of my friends had ordered the beef and lamb shewarma. Upon discovering this, they apologized and gave him the Hawashi, which was certainly understandable, but said nothing to the customer who was actually given the wrong meal -- me.
