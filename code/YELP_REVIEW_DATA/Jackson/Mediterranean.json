For instance, a while back a little controversy erupted when the owner made some anti-Semitic comments to a local Rabbi. They apparently made up about it and so it is safe to go there again. I was excited, because the food was sloppy delicious the first time I went. My most recent visit involved the owner emerging from the kitchen with a knife and jovially threatening to cut some bits of anatomy from the man working the cash register who cowered in what was probably only mock fear. This sort of banter will probably color your visit too, especially if you come with a group.Price is reasonable. Menu is limited but the quality was not what you can get elsewhere. Wraps is somewhat (or used to be) entertained with another greek restaurant in town, Krilakis, but I am not sure the relationship anymore. You may be better off finding Krilakis (it was in \"downtown\" Ridgeland, last I checked).Quality has definitely declined. The lamb was *ok* but the chicken was tough. Granted they did admit they were scraping the bottom of the barrel on the chicken (end of the lunch time) but still, it was pretty bad.Service was entertaining. While they kept forgetting to bring out fries, the proprietor did come over to regale us with tales of his mother banishing him to Jackson (from NYC) (truly the Rothschilds of dingy Greek diners). He peppered this with a few colorful jokes and free dessert. That Baklava was on point. Probably the best I've had in Jackson. Of course, the unexpectedness, the freeness and the fact that I was almost hand fed it by the owner made it that much better too.However, we go to restaurants to eat primarily and the quality of the food just isn't good enough to make it. Stop by for the experience though!"], ["Duan C.", "Considering the hype behind the Rabbi's experienced at the restaurant - this update is strictly in regards to the service I received from the proprietor.My service wasn't as bad as the Rabbi's - but it wasn't downright welcoming either. I guess I was so excited behind the portions of the food I was not paying that much attention to them, as were they to me either. I'll put it to you like this - when we walked in - I wasn't greeted with an \"Hello, welcome to...........\" When I paid out - I was thanked and that was it. So in regards to the customer service I received, I can honestly say I have received better at other places."], ["Ruhi R.", "Going into the place, it gives off a slightly shady vibe.

Lady at the register didn't have change for a $20 so I had to use a credit card. Most employees were pretty friendly, but it was obvious they were Greek. \u00a0Food was okay. I got a gyro and fries-- fries were good and gyro was a little salty. Sauce was good. The only complaint about food was that it didn't have paper wrapped around it so I felt like I was eating a large taco.

Lots of random pictures and paintings decorate the walls. Girl behind counter was basically it as far as employees.

And the food was good. And it was ready relatively quickly. But my experience was horribly bad, due to the rudeness of the worker behind the counter. She was mean, and angry. She also substantially overcharged us, and acted terribly inconvenienced when she had to issue a refund. I left with a pit in my stomach, the kind that you get after a confrontation with someone, or after you've been bullied. Yes, it was just that bad. If there had been even a hint of a smile, I'd give it 3 or 4. But when I tapped the bell to get her to the front to issue our refund, I saw and heard her yell, \"Jesus!!!\" before she came out. My husband is orthodox Christian, so that made him feel kind of ashamed that an orthodox establishment would have workers that behave that way. The really good food is why I didn't give a 1 rating. :( If mean people don't upset you like they do me, by all means go there. I'll never ever go back. So much negativity! (For reference, our visit was late January 2014, on a Friday night, so no owner seemed to be present.)"], ["Liz C.", "My husband and I are stationed in Meridian and we both had a serious craving for Greek food, gyros in particular. So after reading the amazing reviews for Wraps, we decided to go there. I'm not sure if maybe we just went on a bad day...or have eaten at enough of other good gyro places that we know what a true gyro tastes like and have become a little picky. The bread was covered in butter, making me feel like I was eating a fast food burger. The meat was extremely salty, to the point where I just couldn't eat anymore after 3 bites. Even the feta cheese I got on mine was extremely salty. I couldn't even taste the tzatziki sauce because the salt was so overbearing. There was no taste at all...but salt. I started to pick it apart and eat just lettuce with tzatziki sauce to try and let my mouth take a break from the salt over load...and even then there was no relief! We are pretty healthy eaters so maybe we just aren't used to a salt overload? Either way...we will never eat here again. The fries were not \"fresh cut\" as advertised...they were just like any other fries you can get at any food place. The thing is....the fries had less salt on them than the gyro did! The place had a nice, laid back feel to it. The plastic chairs are actually really comfy! It has a nice \"hole in the wall\" feel that we love. But that's about the only positive thing I can say. With the price of two gyros, fries and drinks at this place we could have gotten a much better meal in a nicer place. Typically the \"hole in the wall\" places have some of the best food I've ever had but this place is an exception to that rule. They have these little quotes all over the walls that I guess employees or guests write and put up, and although some were funny, a lot were not very family friendly. We don't have kids and don't care about it, but if we did have kids, I wouldn't want them reading some of the stuff they have on their walls. So, I guess if you are used to their salty gyros and that's all you know, then that's awesome. But if you've had a truly good gyro before and have a craving for one...don't go here."], ["Baron M.", "As far as the Jackson metro market goes for gyro's, this is as good as I have found. The portions are large, sometimes huge, yet still flavorful. I end up going here about once or twice a month and I always end up with the same thing - the regular gyro. To me, it is good enough that I don't really even feel compelled to try the rest of the menu, though the red snapper (I believe) gyro sounds quite tempting. The fries are generally done right, though sometimes I ask them to make them a little crispy. They come with some sea salt and a nice flavor. The inside is fun, though seating can get a little tight. I wouldn't suggest a group of more than 4. Possibly 5 if you can snag a chair from another table. Some days it can be standing room only, but they are still, generally, quite fast getting your order out. I am marking it as cheap, but it can get pricey, depending on what you get or add (I think feta is $2.50 extra on a gyro that doesn't already have it, dessert is a bit over $4 after tax, etc)."], ["Kristin B.", "This place is awesome.Wraps is a local hole in the wall Mediterranean gyro place with about 6 tables inside and 3 outside. \u00a0You grab your drinks from open coolers located by the door, or the pitcher of iced tea on the main counter.

In fact I was surprised that they even took cards at the register!My brother recommends the veggy wrap - All the regular veggies of a typical gyro, minus the meat, but has fries in it instead. Strangely delicious. I'd recommend the fish gyro though - delicate fish (talapia I think?) seasoned just right and melts when you bite into your gyro. And of course the regular ol' gyro is pretty tasty too - though like Shannon says, the meat is cut kinda chunky.They're \u00a0big too - come hungry.

The salad had two olives, and had thinly sliced soggy tomatoes. And it was saturated in dressing, rather than just drizzled and then tossed to get a good coating.

The one downfall, and this is strictly personal, is that there is SO MUCH FOOD in such a tiny foil package that it's hard to handle the gyro gracefully.

Really, everything I have had is good. The staff is always friendly and the food always comes quickly.

Basically, I found this place via Yelp and it's really good reviews. I went in and ordered the combo that had a Lamb Gyro and a greek salad. The Greek Salad tasted pretty decent and the Lamb Gyro left quite a bit to be desired. The meat tasted almost unseasoned and the sauce they put on it did not have much flavor like I am accustomed to. Also, I asked that they add Feta cheese to the gyro. They charged me $1.50 to do so and put none on there. That really rubbed me the wrong way. I pointed this out to the girl at the front and she got me a small ramekin of it. It was actually some of the strongest feta I had ever tasted. A little too strong actually. Other complaints I had were the fact that there was only 1 other table that had occupants in the place at 7:15 yet the floor was dirty with food and straw wrappers that were on the floor. There is no excuse for that in a slow restaurant. The unsweet tea was also terrible as it tasted like straight up water. They also charged my AMEX for a drink that I never requested as well. The total came to like $16.00. I left very full, but the food was not that great at all. Had the food been priced at about $10.00 I may have felt a little better about it. Sure my company was paying the tab but I spend company money as if it were my own. Another turn off was the place was crawling slow yet my Gyro came out within 1 minute. It was warm which means that everything is precooked and just sitting under a heat lamp or above boiling water or something. Basically it is definitely NOT prepared fresh. Based on my experience, I am giving it 2 stars which is pretty generous. Apparently many folks think they have awesome burgers. The other table that was occupied were eating burgers and they did look pretty good. My advise is to go with one of those because they have to be better than the gyros.

This place is my new go to Greek joint. It's also BYOB which is good for the cost conscious. The gyros are great. I prefer the melted feta from Kiefer's but this is much closer to my house. The parking doesn't result in door dings like the poorly laid out lot at Kiefer's. Also, the bum factor is non-existent at Krilakis. The burger is excellent with great bun but will come after your guests who order gyros. I'd prefer all plates to arrive at the same time, otherwise you watch people eat. They have a gyro combo with fries and soft drink which is very reasonable at around $9 before tip. Speaking of fries... They are worth the trip as well. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with sea salt. My wife doesn't care for their veggie gyro with the fries in it though. Overall worth checking out if you haven't and immensely better than Kristo's which is close to the same area."], ["Mike B.", "My son and I stopped in on the way home from Middle of Nowhere Mississippi to wait out rush hour traffic and to stop the pleas of \"Daddy, I'm hungry\" emanating from the back seat. \u00a0I'd eaten at Krilakis in the past, when it was located in Byrum, so I was confident that it was as good as I remembered. \u00a0While everyone raves about the burgers (and trust me, they are as good as their reputation), I was in the mood for Greek.My son is a huge fan of \"dip\", so I ordered the hummus. And as a cheese lover, I had to order the pita melt. \u00a0Pita bread, mozzarella and feta? Perfection. \u00a0For the entree, we chose the mixed gyro. Given a choice, K would have had just chicken, because that is his default food selection if pizza is not an option. \u00a0The food came out promptly, and the hummus was by far my favorite. It is the perfect consistency, and the seasoning is spot on. Not too salty, with just the right amount of garlicky goodness. \u00a0The gyro came with a mound of hand cut fries, which K promptly dunked in hummus. \u00a0While it is not your typical culinary combination, it seemed to work well for him. In short order, the hummus was decimated, and there was a huge dent in the aforementioned mound of fries. \u00a0The pita melt was hot and cheesy. \u00a0My only complaint is that the feta didn't come through quite as much as I'd hoped. \u00a0Mozzarella is a wonderful cheese, but very bland in comparison, so I'd hoped the feta would provide a little more bite. \u00a0Still, it was good and I would have it again.The gyro was almost an afterthought after making our way through everything else. \u00a0But what a pleasant afterthought. \u00a0The pitas are soft and delicious, and the tzatzki creamy and delicious. \u00a0It's always an added bonus when proportions are done well. \u00a0Often, gyros are drowning in sauce and it becomes a bit of a mess. \u00a0In this case, there was just enough to get the flavor in each bite of the grilled chicken and lamb laden pita. Overall, it was a great meal, and some of the best Greek food I've had in the South. I'm sure there are better places out there, and I know for a fact there are much worse. Two things kept me from giving Krilakis five stars: the lamb and chicken were a little dry for my taste, and the decor was a little lacking.

Don't be bummed though, because Aladdin is nestled right here in the heart of downtown Fondren and it is one of the best dining experiences you can have in town!Let's start with the atmosphere. Walking up to Aladdin's, you'll walk through the front porch sitting area first. If the weather's nice, absolutely grab a seat here! It's such a pleasant place to sit and there are several tables as well as big comfy seating as well. If you choose to sit inside, you'll have your choice between lots of tables as well as some cushy booths as well. It's a small space, but if you've got a group of friends, they're always willing to push some tables together. I've walked in with groups of eight or nine before and had no issue getting seated pretty quickly. The servers are typically really nice. I've been here dozens of times, and I've had maybe one or two dining experiences in which the service was a little lackluster. That's not to say the server wasn't friendly or attentive though! Like I said, they're all usually super nice and the food gets delivered to the tables really quickly.About the food... Omg. So good. This is authentic Mediterranean cuisine, for sure. I love that it stays true to it's Mediterranean/Greek roots while still being a true Jackson, local spot. You can get a sweet tea with your hummus, and you won't be disappointed by either. The homemade falafels are my favorite thing on the menu. The falafel plate is vegetarian and comes with rice and veggies. It's plenty of food for one person and so good! The homemade hummus is reeeeally good and it comes with most dishes. They'll bring you some fresh, warm bread to go with it. YUM. Other excellent dishes: chicken dolmas (served hot!), beef schwarma, gyro, lamb kebab. Everything is so good! And the menu is huge. I could come here every day for a month and not get bored. The desserts are really great too! Get the tiramisu to split with friends. Or get one all for yourself! Oh, and it is super reasonably priced! You can get a gyro for $5. The falafel plate will run you about $9. The most expensive items are the lamb dishes, but even then, nothing goes above $20. NB: This place does NOT serve alcohol, but they do let you brown bag which is so nice! You can grab a bottle of red wine across the street at Fondren Cellars and enjoy it with your meal with some friends. Talk about a perfect evening!"], ["Jeana S.", "Hands down the best Mediterranean in Jackson! The food is always super fresh and delicious. I really enjoy both the chicken shwarma and the dolmas. Another reviewer mentioned this, but I'd like to reiterate that their dolmas is served hot unlike most places. But now I won't eat it any different way! Most plates comes with rice, hummus, and a side salad. Their meats are always seasoned and cooked perfectly. Now that I've thought about it, I've never had a bad dish here! I also love love love the mint tea! The interior is great for a small or large group, and the service is great!

The plates arrived timely and were very colorful with a small bowl made of humus containing olive oil. \u00a0The humus was tasty. The Greek salad contained cucumbers, tomatoes, and black olives with a smidgen of tasteless feta and a store bought Italian dressing. Warm pita was provided with the meal. I don't know why but they were cut into strips. I prefer the whole so I can separate the sides and fill it like a pocket. All of this could still make a decent chicken shawarma but the biggest disappointment was the chicken. This was not the stacked, marinated, slow grilled meat you would anticipate but rather pan fried, dry over cooked chopped chicken with a light spice on the outside.

However, this place was open late (until 10 or 11p) and boy, am I glad it was.The location is convenient to access right there on the main strip of the city, adjacent to the government buildings a few blocks down. The decor has your typical, Mediterranean style feel which is always fun, if not in some kitschy way.

Since Petra is closed, Aladdin is busier than before. For an appetizer I can recommend the fried Kibby or Spinach Pie. The Kibby has a hard outer shell and filled with ground beef. The Spinach Pie has a soft, fried exterior and filled with spinach and goat cheese. Both come with a dipping sauce, but the thick Lebna sauce (yogurt sauce similar to Tzatziki) for the Spinach Pie is outstanding. You might as well order 2 Spinach Pie's because they are to die for. I would not recommend the Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) as they are too small - the size of cigarillos.For the meal, I've tried the Lamb Kabob Plate, Combination Plate, and roasted leg of lamb. But I think the Gyro Plate tastes better, contains more food, and even is cheaper than the others. The plate is filled with meat, rice, salad and hummus. Pay the extra to upgrade to a Greek salad (with feta and olives) or Tabouli. Nothing has an overpowering taste - the rice, salad and hummus are all mild and delicious. Strangely the Gyro Plate comes with no yogurt sauce, which is a necessity in my book. But ordering extra Lebna was quickly fulfilled - just make sure they don't bring you an entire Lebna appetizer.The tea has a hint of mint which is nice.

The lamb has a mysterious flavor but I do get I believe to be a smoked paprika taste, it was a little spicy but even though I have a mild tolerance could handle it. The basmati rice was light and fluffy and lightly seasoned or flavored with saffron. If I was to criticize anything it would be two things on the lunch plate: the lamb was not drained of grease before it was placed on the hummas so it leached into the rice the second item I would criticize was that I was not asked what dressing for my salad and it arrived with one I will not eat. \u00a0Finally dinner is the house special Big Combo (4 shrimp, 2 lamb chops, and chicken kabob chunks.

Here are the things I tried and my feedback:- Hummus - Very good hummus, doesn't have a strong flavor by itself so it easily pairs with anything else. I got their wheat pita bread and it was fresh and very very good.- Qudsia - Chicken and fava beans on top of hummus, makes the hummus a little more tangible as an appetizer. Had this the second time!- Meat dolmas - These were alright, I wasn't very impressed. I have liked dolmas before when they were seasoned really well but it was bland meat inside bland grape leaves with no flavor to them. Meh.- Spinach pie - VERY yummy. I really liked the filling in this and the pastry was light and really good.- Falafel - AMAZING!! You have to get the falafel here, even if you haven't tried them before. Very flavorful, not greasy, just yummy yummy yummy.- Hummus with lamb - Lamb was very good and tender, came with a small cucumber salad which was pretty good.I added this spicy sauce you can ask for on the side to a lot of what I tried here because their biggest weakness was underseasoning on some dishes that had the potential to be phenomenal. They also didn't have eggplant for baba ganuj which was disappointing.

I believe what I meant is that Keifer's has better Greek food (while \"real\" was not the best word choice as it is definitely Americanized) while this place has better Persian/Turkish, etc. While I still believe Keifer's hummus, gyros, tzatziki and feta dressing slightly edge Aladdin out, the food here has grown on me more and more through the years. They also have good gyros and hummus, but what truly makes the menu is the lamb. Doesn't matter whether you order it in kebab, wrap, chop, or plate form, it's delicious. I usually get the Hummus with Lamb and make sure to ask for labna or tzatziki to go with it (it doesn't come with any yogurt sauce, which I've always thought was strange.)

We started with the Aladdin Special, a \u00a0sampler platter with hummus, baba ganuj, Lebna, grape leaves, tabouli, falafel and kibby.The hummus was well seasoned, although not a smooth as I would have preferred. The Baba Ganuj was not bad but not memorable either. The Lebna was very good. The grape leaves were a little over cooked but not bad. The kibby was also very good. It was my first time trying it so I don't know what it was supposed to taste like but I liked it. The star of the sampler platter, though, were the falafel! Those were some of the best I have had. Very well seasoned, cooked perfectly.For main courses, my mom had the Lamb Chops and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned! I had the chicken shawarma with a side of hot sauce (can't remember what it was called) but it was VERY spicy and the flavor went well with the chicken. Although the chicken was seasoned well, it was a bit overcooked and somewhat dry.To end it, we tried one of the \"blendies\" drinks made with strawberry on top and avocado?!?! on the bottom. \u00a0It was surprisingly tasty but I would have liked it to be a bit colder as the strawberry section was colder than the avocado. Once I mixed them together, the temperature was more to my preference and I enjoyed it. Overall, a great first experience with Greek food in Jackson.

I ordered the vegetarian plate (hummus, baba ganouj, and tabouleh). \u00a0My companion had chicken kabobs. \u00a0All the food was fresh and delicious, and was served promptly. The haloumi was sliced a bit thicker than is customary and did not have the traditional slight crustiness on the outside, but it was still delightfully \"squeaky\" and came with a nice garnish of tomato and cucumber slices.The reason for no fifth star is that the restaurant is \"bring your own bottle\" but this fact is not advertised on their website. It would not have deterred us from going if we had known, but was nonetheless disappointing when we arrived to not be able to have a beer or some wine. The second reason is that the waiter didn't seem to be too familiar with the menu - he would have been of no help to someone who was not already familiar with middle eastern food. \u00a0However, if you're looking for solid mediterranean fare in Jackson, you will be happy with Aladdin!"], ["Kashif A.", "Lamb chops!

I love that you can BYOB for no cork fee... have a nice dinner with wine (there's a liquor store literally next door) on the cheap! My only complaint is that once, I ordered that same vegetable dish I always order and it came without the cheese (my favorite part). I asked about it and was told they were out. I was annoyed, because the dish was really bland without it, and they hadn't even told me. I think they took off 50 cents? Gee, thanks.

They offer either wheat or white pita. I get the white, the texture is better to me, but for die hard wheat fans, the wheat is good. I have had their lentil soup, and most of the time, I've had it, it's been good, flavorful, and comforting. I get the combination plate of chicken kabob, schwarma, and gyro meat. I love the gyro meat, it's soft and spicy a grilled so nicely, and you can eat it with the hummus that comes with your meal. The chicken and beef are marinated in something amazing and grilled. Usually my chicken is juicy and tender and my beef is falvorful. The hummus is very creamy and I wish I could figure out how to get the creamy consistency of Aladdin's hummus at home. The meal comes with a salad with a homemade italian dressing. I usually get an extra side of dressing to dip my meat it, because it is fantastic! I think I could literally drink a cup of their dressing. It's that good. \u00a0I haven't eaten the salads there, but I've seen them, and they look beautiful. I have had the gyro and it's delicious. I have also had the falafel and while I like it very much, Keifer's wins on the falafel, hands down. I usually have great service when I go to Aladdin's. If I could I would eat Aladdin's weekly, that's how much I enjoy it. Portion sizes are reasonable and so is the price of the food.

Shin e. is right, they do have a grocery section which is nice, unfortunately, Jackson doesn't have a huge need for Middle Eastern groceries, so some of the items may have sat on the shelf for a lil' while. The stuff in the case is solid though. The desserts are for the most part really good. The tiramisu is AWESOME, but I'm not sure that it justifies the $5.99 pricetag. Try a chocolate pecan bar instead, they're really good (but I'm not sure that it's a middle eastern thing) The hummous is SO SO fresh, you can taste the lemon and olive oil. Do yourself a favor and get some to-go for later in the week. Okay so pricing is a little pricy, but in all fairness the portions are pretty huge. The best time to go is for lunch, where you can get lunch plates in the neighborhood of $6-9. Dinner gets a little pricy with plates ranging from $10-$20. I had the kebab which was good, but not the best I've ever had. Then I tried my brother's dish, and realized I made a mistake choosing meat. This place is called Mediterranean Cafe and Fish Grill, and griling fish \u00a0is a fine art that they have perfected. True, they use frozen fish, but they do a pretty good job at making it palatable. Hell, even more than palatable. I would recommend getting the pasta with fish. The pasta is done in this mediterranean sauce that I'm not familiar with, but it's delicious, and there are also grilled vegetables with it too. DEF. worth the visit. The owner (Elias?) is a very accommodating guy.One last tip, this place is BYOB! Which is amazing! (Except on Sundays). There's a liquor store in the strip, but I'd recommend shopping elsewhere for wine selections."], ["Chad S.", "The owner Elias is your best friend you always missed. This place has great lunch & dinner. But you should be ready to have grilled fish or shrimp....because its great. Also BYOB with liquor store next door.

They also have a 150-person banquet room available, but I've never seen it in-use.Yesterday I had a gyro, hummus, eggplant dip and stuffed grape leaves. They include a small cup of extra cucumber sauce, which is nice. \u00a0My friend had a kabob plate with 3 sides and enjoyed it. \u00a0I have had the grilled fish in the past.

Everything is very healthy & very fresh tasting. I agree that this is probably the best Mediterrean place in the Jackson area, though they all have different slants & specialties, so its not totally fair to compare.

Also, with your lunch you can get any two sides: a bit of hummus/pita, lentil pilaf, etc.. The fish, Shrimp, grilled chicken, lentil pilaf are all quite nice. Elias (the owner) really is into pushing healthy & is delightfully a bit of a \"Seinfield Soup Nazi.\" \"You want \u00a0a diet coke refill?, How about a water?..Try the Tabouli, its the healthiest thing you can put in your body.\" But he's otherwise friendly.

There's seating at the bar as well as some high top tables for smaller groups when you first walk in. Then, in the proper dining room, there are both booths as well as tables.

Situated right in Belhaven between Fondren and downtown, this place is central to all the going's-on's here in Jackson, and is a perfect place to start your evening.But let's talk about the food. I eat out relatively often and can be a bit of a food snob, I'll admit. This place regularly blows me away. Everything I've had has been phenomenal. The first time I ate here, I had the steak and it was by far the best steak I've had in town. Better than any of the restaurants \"known\" for their steak! Since then, I've had a variety of dishes from salads to brunch to pizza and everything has left me raving. The menu changes regularly, and features a bevy of local vegetables and produce which I LOVE. I wish more Jackson restaurants would do that. It shows a certain pride in this city, which goes a long way with me. This is a fantastic date locale. It's classy, not stuffy, and quiet enough that you can hear yourself chat but not so quiet that no one chats.Their bar is fully stocked and their drink menu is extensive. They offer a fantastic variety of wines and beers, but I've always been most impressed by their unique and finely crafted cocktails. Service, for me, has always been great. The only time it's ever been a bit slow was when I stopped in for a late lunch but that's to be expected at any restaurant when the wait staff is switching from lunch to dinner mode. Even when it's a bit slow, the wait staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful-- always ready with a recommendation or a menu suggestion.

I ordered the shrimp bisque based on the recommendation from the lady taking my order. I was not impressed. There was basically no shrimp and instead of a creamy sauce it was more of a broth. The smoked wings were pretty good though I had expected more from the white barbecue sauce, it was peppery and fairly spicy (and not in the tasty way) in my opinion.The couscous was something to brag about though. This is also a recommendation from the lady who took my to go order. I wanted the Parmesan truffle fries but she said they were a special and they no longer carried them at this moment. She offered the couscous as a substitute, and she actually got this one right. It had small cut mushrooms with some Parmesan and some truffle oil. Recommended!

Prices are reasonable for the quality of food!They have an excellent brunch - probably the most creative and tasty brunch in Jackson right now. The happy hour is also not to be missed. Half off cocktails and pizzas is perfect for an after work drink and snack or a full blown early dinner date! The last time I went to the happy hour, the mixologist (I only use the term because he was actually our waiter at the time, not the bartender, though he had come up with many of the cocktails) was happy to hang around and tell us about how the cocktail combinations had come about. The staff is always knowledgable about where the food comes from and how it is prepared.The only issues I have had with them is weekday lunch - but this is a more difficult time for most restaurants. The food was excellent, of course, but the service was a little lacking. That is to be expected at a busy lunch place like this, however.MAC & CHEESE LIST - This Mac & Cheese is different. It is not your standard comfort food style, so if you are looking for Velveeta (no judgement zone - sometimes we are!) this is not your place. Today it was Pancetta Mac & Cheese (see pic) which was awesome, but it has been a different formulation in the past. Definitely good, but lighter on the cheese than most places. Worth getting for sure though.MUST HAVE DISHES IN JACKSON - The Best Damn G&T. Like the name says, it is the best G&T you'll have, at least until you figure out how to make it yourself.

And every time I try something different, I love it. This is definitely one of Jackson's best and most creative restaurants. Worth trying!"], ["Melissa M.", "I've wanted to try this for awhile and happened to be nearby today. \u00a0The place is bright, clean, and well appointed. \u00a0Love the abstract art from local artists hanging in their gallery. \u00a0Our server was quick and friendly. \u00a0We'd gotten a gluten-free menu from the host, but our server went the extra mile and took it back to the chef who told him the dish we wanted was not gluten free and also cooked in the same oil as non gluten-free items. Fortunately we aren't that sensitive but we appreciated his thoroughness in verifying the items. \u00a0I ordered the salmon salad but asked for the kale to be changed for the local lettuces, omit onion, and add feta. \u00a0They did this without a charge (although they did leave onions on - no problem as I could easily remove them.) \u00a0My dining partner had the simmons catfish with parmesan fries. \u00a0Our order came quickly given the lunch rush. \u00a0My salad was very good. \u00a0The portion was relatively small, but it ended up being enough. \u00a0It included lettuce, finely diced cucumber, kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and a feta vinaigrette. \u00a0My son had 3 nice sized filets and a cup of fries. \u00a0He liked the fish but really raved about the fries. He said the parmesan permeated the entire dish, not just the fries on top. \u00a0Being yelpers, I pulled the listing up and saw a free dessert with entree offer with check in. \u00a0We had the chocolate mousse. \u00a0It was excellent and a nice sized serving. \u00a0It was a complex dish with several layers and flavor profiles - chocolate, crust, ganache, cream, raspberry drizzle, and mine. \u00a0And it was complimentary, so there's that! \u00a0I will go back and try something else. \u00a0It was above average food and service. \u00a0Prices were a little steep for lunch (2 entrees, no drinks was $35 with tip) but it was very good."], ["Jon D.", "Very good, prices are a little high but you get what you pay for - worth the price. I had a wedge, shrimp and grits, and a baked apple. Would go lighter next time as my meal was a little heavy. Delicious nonetheless. Free Dessert with Yelp check in was a big bonus. I'll be back, no doubt."], ["Jessica S.", "Very nice atmosphere. Wait staff was nice. I ordered the salmon but it was really salty. As were a few other things I ordered. Aside from that it was pretty good."], ["Shane S.", "This place is great! It has only been opened for a year and half, but they have received awards such as Best New Chef, Best Restaurant, even the sous chef has gotten accolades. The Manship is a huge space, but also welcoming with a more than competent wait staff. The drink menu is extensive and eclectic. The shrimp and grits were out of this world, the pimento cheese is a perfect creamy texture with a little heat. My crawfish pizza was amazing. The crust was just crisp enough to hold up to the buttery sauce. They have a great happy hour with half price pizzas. The strawberry tart with ice cream was the perfect compliment to finish the meal. The Manship is one of the very few reasons to visit Jackson again."], ["Ann M.", "The manship is one of my favorite sit down dinner spots in Jackson, and it's my all time favorite happy hour! Half off pizza's and drinks- YES! Every pizza I've eaten so far has been divine, and the porch-swing and heat index always hit the spot. As for dinner, simple sides like their any gratin potatoes or and veggie dish have satisfied my appetite. Personally, I go for the brocollini and some divine crab beignets . The duck and the filet are terrific, as well as the salmon and redfish. We used the Manship for our wedding rehearsal dinner and were so pleased! The services were great, and all of our guests were extremely happy with their food. I recommend them for events, for happy hour, and for a fun date night! Definitely in my top five for favorite Jackson restaurants."], ["Lisa G.", "Food was amazing as well as the staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, from explaining the artist & artwork on the walls to the best recommendations of what to eat. Jake was my server and did not disappoint with the rabbit ravioli with pancetta and chocolate silk tower for dessert! He even brought me a spoon to not miss out on all the goodness of the most flavorful sauce! Telling everyone at the conference to try this place out."], ["Scott A.", "Best steak in Jackson. The reduction sauce on the steak is amazing. I had the Prime cut. Best Mac and Cheese I've ever tasted. My wife got the Greek chicken, little dry in the middle but lots of great flavor. Also had the red shrimp appetizer. Really good but not very many. Only thing missing from the meal was bread to soak up the sauces. The apple dessert was very tasty as well. Great atmosphere."], ["Amin A.", "Actually a 3.5 starWas visiting Jackson because corporate hq is centered here and had to attend training. Prior to arrival I mapped out all the restaurants that I wanted to try and Manship just so happened to be first on the list. \u00a0Day one after training I went to the hotel, changed, and went to manship to check out the Jackson food scene with 2 other colleague . The decor was beautiful and the restaurant very clean underneath a hospital it was apparent that the customer attraction was young professional- the restaurant was very busy- \u00a0we were seated immediately. The waitress introduced herself and said that the restaurant had many different foods but many dishes have a bit of Lebanese twist and spice added., since the chef was Lebanese. We ordered the tuna dip, and duck wings as appetizers. The duck wings were very good and greasy but had barely any meat on them. The tuna was actually a very good dip. For an entree I ordered the Rabbit pasta- to my surprise rabbit was a little salty of a meat- but furthermore the pasta dish was incredibly small- this was unexpected for a 18 dollar dish. My colleague got the strip steak which tasted remarkable but was a very little bit. The third colleague ordered a pork shoulder- which I cannot comment on because I do not knowingly eat pork. The desert was the best thing i got Tiramisu which was free with checkin was absolutely delicious maybe the best thing I got \u00a0Anyway with 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 2 drinks- 62 bucks. Not bad - it just didnt really satisfy portion wise. Regrets: I would get the pizza.I would return."], ["Landon M.", "First time here this evening while visiting Jackson, pleasant experience. The staff adhered to the reservation notes well. Charcuterie and cheese assortment were great. Salad and entr\u00e9es were well but a bit on the large side. Red fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned well. The sirloin was cooked spot on med rare, only complaint is it was over sauced when it could have stood on its own. Very nice wine selection, especially northern Italians. Bar service was top notch cocktails were well, plethora of digestifs and probably the best Scotch whiskey list in town. \u00a0Slides in to one of my top five when in jackson."], ["Shenika C.", "I visited the Manship one afternoon for lunch. I ordered the shrimp po-boy and although it was slightly salty, I enjoyed it. I wasn't impressed with the parmesan fries. Very nice atmosphere and I definitely will eat here again."], ["Cherry D.", "Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon with a couple of friends. We ordered the chicken, pork, and beef entrees, as well as a couple of alcoholic beverages. The pork was a little on the sweet side for my liking, so I ended up not eating my dish. The beef had a good Mediterranean flavor and it was really moist. But the chicken was on point! I would definitely go back for the chicken. My mouth is salivating just thinking about the chicken. Can't wait to go back."], ["Kris A.", "We were in town from New Orleans celebrating our anniversary so the pressure was on to find the perfect restaurant. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The restaurant and bar area were full when we arrived with one party waiting but we were sat right away thanks to the convenient reservation I made on my Yelp app a few hours earlier;)On to the service/food experience...First of all the seasonal menu is amazing and I had a really hard time narrowing down my choices because I wanted one of each! We asked the server tons of questions and he answered all of them patiently and honestly. After thorough discussions with the server, browsing through Yelp photos and some meditation, we ordered: the white bbq wings, marinated crab claws, burrata apps, ribeye deckle, parm reggiano fries, mushroom bacon egg pizza entrees and for dessert the chocolate mousse and tiramisu. If youre having as hard of a time deciding as we did, here's the breakdown:Wings were delicious, nothing out of the ordinary thoughCrab claws are the only thing we wouldnt order again. \u00a0They were tasty but we expected them hot which thru us offThe burrata was the best Ive ever had. Ribeye deckle are medalions that melt in your mouth and is AMAZING. The pizza had generous amounts of exotic mushrooms, nice chunks of meaty bacon and a perfectly cooked poached egg that just made the bite velvety deliciousness. I am a french fry connoisseur and I wouldnt change a thing about these. Perfect size with perfect amount of salty cheese in a perfect portion. I even left a few which is hard for me to rationalize still today. Our desserts were complimentary thanks to our yelp check in! \u00a0The tiramisu is more of a dulce de leche with a slight taste of Bailey's. It was good, just not your typical espresso soaked. The mousse was excellent with a dollop of raspberry that complimented it well. Overall it was an awesome anniversary dinner and we would recommend Manship to everyone in the area. ($160 after tip: 3 andygator draft beers + 1 heavens milk martini not mentioned)"], ["Darren S.", "Now that I have a toddler, we have to make every date night count. The Manship is our most consistent go-to spot for a great experience. You can enjoy The Manship any way you'd like: cocktails and small plates, pizza and beer, or steak and wine. Whichever route you choose, you'll find fresh, local ingredients and the wood-fired grill accentuating everything. We've had excellent service every time, and the decor is bright and clean, contemporary but still comfortable. The open kitchen adds a nice buzz to the room."], ["Claire S.", "Extremely mediocre and pricy not for the portion but because it was kind of gross. Chicken was terribly dry with no flavor whatsoever, yet sitting in fat. Pizza suffered from the same dry chicken and artichokes were incredibly tough. Waitress never did a quality check, which was probably the worst part. She didn't have a full section and never once asked if everything was okay. Mac and cheese was probably the best part and even then - it was 2/10 at best. Won't be back. Won't recommend it to anyone. Best part was the drinks, which were well made."], ["Leon S.", "Food is good....service is slow....shrimp bisque (has \u00a0curry in it)....

The staff was nice and accommodating, always a plus. I got the beef Poboy, absolutely delicious. 2 others got the chicken shwarma and nothing was left. The Spanish fries were amazing. A touch spicy, but that's ok. For the dessert, I got Tiramisu. A little on the creamy side than what I'm used to, but that's ok (others weren't a fan). There was also this lemon tart thing with sherbet which was also delicious. If I ever end up back in Jackson, definitely a place to go!"], ["Brenna M.", "Yelp has not let us down yet! It helped us find this awesome little restaurant, Manship Wood Fired Kitchen. We had Grouper with Polenta & Tomatoes/Veggies, Italian Crab Claws, Parmesan Truffle Fries & their Brisket as well as a Pepperoni Pizza with 2 Fried Eggs. Ridiculous. Food Porn. Oh, and their Bread with Seasoned Olive Oil is fantastic. Our three year old devoured the Italian Crab Claws & Brisket!"], ["Vicky O.", "Our evening at The Manship was not good at all! Our waiter never introduced himself as our waiter (he just appeared and asked for our order) nor told us his name (our receipt says his name was Brandon). In fact, his first few words to us included labeling my friend 'sassy'. We should have known then what would follow...Let's back up...I made a reservation, arrived on time and still had to wait to be seated. Not very long, maybe 10 minutes, but what's the point of a reservation if you have to wait? I wasn't a big deal so I let it go. Anyhow, as I was led to the very back of the restaurant (by the kitchen) I passed by 2 open tables that could have fit our group. \u00a0I let that go too. My friend and I waited at least 20 minutes to place a drink/appetizer order along. Thirty minutes later only \u00a0one of the two appetizers had been received. The other appetizer never appeared and our waiter was so inattentive that we had to flag down another server...whose only response was that he would ask our waiter about the food. \u00a0After an hour of bad service we did not bother ordering entrees and took our business further down State Street to Surin, where the service was EXCELLENT!Also, if you choose to eat at The Manship (which we \u00a0will no longer be doing) \u00a0DO NOT EAT THE BREAD! Our table was in the back next to the bread station (the worst table possible even though we made reservations and there were other tables open!!!) and ALL of the servers handle it with their bare hands. Gross. Gross. GROSS. The funny thing is even though we were so close, our waiter never bothered to provide us with any bread during our one hour stay. And when we asked for our check, instead of asking what the problem was or if we wanted anything else, he handed us our \u00a0checks (the only thing he did promptly) with a vibe of \u00a0'good riddance'. That is not okay.I will say that the pork belly was pretty good (Table 100's is better IMO) but the culture \u00a0of bad service is unforgivable for any dining experience. We will no longer support this business and I plan to share my experience, good and [mostly] bad, with other Jackson foodies."], ["Bill B.", "To start you must try the Porter. Brewed just down the road in Hattiesburg. \u00a0Best I've had in a long time. Nora, Caroline and I shared the pasta with lamb special, the shrimp with grits and two veggies, spinach and asparagus. \u00a0All first rate. I started with the Caesar. The dressing was a bit under done but still good. The croutons were great. I usually don't eat them but these are a don't miss. Afterward we had ice cream with strawberry tart.

Take any recommendations they give you."], ["David M.", "On my first visit, I had the fried catfish plate and Parmesan reggiano fries. \u00a0The catfish was extremely hot and fresh. \u00a0The coating was unusual - a little heavier than what I'm used to but still very good. \u00a0The fries were the best part of the meal - covered in just the right amount of parmesan.The environment is really nice. \u00a0It's clean, bright, and casual but still feels like fine dining. As it was lunch, I didn't try the cocktail menu but they had a wide variety of interesting options. I think what I like best is that it's locally sourced as much as possible and everything is really, really good quality. \u00a0I'll be back to to try the dinner menu soon."], ["Allen T.", "This place is excellent.

Don't forget to check in for the free dessert.We had the red fish, lamb pizza, and rabbit ravioli. Also the Jerusalem artichokes, carrots, and braised greens as sides. All was excellent. Fish was light and flaky. Pizza wasn't too greasy but the lamb is strong just as a warning. Rabbit ravioli was a bit small but again not too greasy and the rabbit isn't too strong. Just slightly chewy and very tasty. Artichokes aren't actually artichokes but actually sun chokes like fingerling potatoes. Carrots great. Greens good but a tad salty.Minus one star bc my parents didn't like the server Patrick and the tirimasu was pretty meh. To be fair two people recommended the apple cheesecake so must try that if ever back in Jackson."], ["Vim I.", "So glad to see that more and more local-focused restaurants are coming to Jackson. It's been a while since I've been back to the city, so I was pleasantly surprised to see to the new Belhaven building.We tried to make dinner reservations for my sister's bday at Manship for Saturday night, but they were full, so we went for lunch instead. So glad we did. First off, the ambiance is wonderful--very laid back but well thought out decor. A huge blackboard is displayed right next to the open air kitchen--listing the locally-sourced ingredients at Manship.I had the Fennel Sausage pizza since they have a wood fired oven. It was delicious as it sounds. The crust was crispy and flavorful just as it should be.My sister got the duck leg, egg, and polenta brunch special--that was out of this world good. And the boys went with the Italian Panini sandwich and Roast Beef sandwich--which they were really pleased with. The waitstaff left something to be desired--didn't refill water until we asked, switched up the order, and almost spilled the sandwich on one of us. That's the only reason I knocked off a star.Otherwise Manship is well worth going to."], ["Luke C.", "Regular spot for me and my wife. Always pleased with the food and service. The local sourcing of ingredients is particularly appealing. You're doing it wrong if you don't order the au gratin potatoes."], ["Brandon M.", "Went in tonight for dinner and the meal was terrific. We started with the pork belly which had a fantastic flavor. Our party had the pepperoni pizza, Amberjack, salad, potatoes au gratin and spinach. Each was perfect. We finished the night with blueberry cobbler which was a perfect end to the night. Mitchell was our waiter and all his recommendations were on point. Stephen, the GM, made sure to check in with us several times to make sure the meal was great. All in all this was an outstanding meal!"], ["Shay R.", "Filet was delicious! I got my order To-Go and the steak was perfect. Fried okra was also delicious."], ["Emma D.", "4 adults came for dinner. \u00a0We arrived early to beat the crowd. \u00a0The bar was fairly crowded.We all ordered something different. \u00a0The Frito Misto, a fried food appetizer, had a few nice plump oysters and some regular size shrimp along with many popcorn shrimp or something fried, plus some fried squash, artichoke hearts and some very tough fried asparagus. \u00a0It was accompanied by two OK dipping sauces.The pizza was so-so; the filet was a filet. \u00a0Other than an overpowering sauce the duck breast was tasteless despite an appropriate amount of fat. \u00a0The salmon was bland. \u00a0We shared side dishes. \u00a0The roasted cauliflower was charred but essentially raw and barely warm throughout. \u00a0The spinach had been barely wilted and contained an overabundance of stems and garlic. \u00a0We enjoyed excellent coffee and the house merlot was good. \u00a0All in all I would not recommend The Manship and do not plan to return.The music was not well chosen and was much too loud to allow for pleasant conversation.The desserts were all quite good - tiramisu, chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce and cobbler with iced-cream. \u00a0The cobbler was remarkable for not being too sweet.Our service was excellent."], ["Molly G.", "I love this restaurant! Happy hour is a great deal... Pizzas for $5 and cheap fancy drinks! The best drink is the Porch Swing. It's a sweet adult lemonade with alcohol. Careful, though, the drinks are strong! I also love the Jerusalem artichokes and the broccolini. The tabbouleh is thick and mushy-- you might want to skip this dish. The bread is to die for."], ["Krystal C.", "This establishment was great. Well lit, clean, excellent atmosphere. The bread brought to the table was fresh and served warm. I ordered the chicken wrap. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. The pita was fresh and toasted just right. The tzasiki sauce was excellent. The truffle fries were fantastic. I wish I could have snuck an extra order home for later. My husband enjoyed his fried oyster po boy and home fries as well. Highly recommended."], ["Susan L.", "As a foodie, I thoroughly research via yelpRestaurants trying to find a great choice. On our way to Florida, stopped in Jackson MS. Manship was everything the reviews said; it is so worth the stop! From the porch swing drink, the pork belly app, and the Egg, bacon pizza, everything was delicious. It is so refreshing when a chef takes passion in the fresh, best ingredients and takes pride in using them in the most creative and delicious way! Spectacular!"], ["Orlean S.", "Visited Manship for the first time early on a Sat evening. Parking is a chore at the Belhaven building. The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern. Even though they weren't yet busy, because I had no reservations we were placed next to the bar. I chose Manship not because of the menu online but because of the outstanding pictures of actual dishes they post on Facebook. There is nothing on their appetizer menu that appealed to me. I heard people mention the tuna dip and the waiter recommended it. It really is tunafish with a smoky taste plus saltine crackers and some fancier bread crisps. It tasted OK but I would not order it again for $13. For a salad we ordered the wedge and Mediterranean. The wedge was standard, but I was not impressed with the Mediterranean. I guess I was expecting a Greek salad but this was very different. It had little dressing and was crunchy due to the chickpeas. I would not order it again.Finally for the main courses we had the duck breast and red snapper special. The duck was tasty yet a little chewy as duck often is. The snapper was outstanding - a light flavored fish over risotto and a few squash slices in a wonderful broth. Both dishes need a side so we shared 3: broccolini, fried okra, and tabbouleh. All 3 were terrific. The broccolini was well seasoned, the tabbouleh was good with a little more tang than is usual, but the standout was the fried okra. This should be on the appetizer menu. They were delicious whole fried okras with a roasted red pepper dipping sauce. They are addictive. Overall the Manship was a nice experience. It's too bad the standard menu isn't more to my liking - lacking in appealing appetizers and a larger selection of seafood entrees. But the main course was outstanding - I definitely would return again. Even though we had 3 different people try to take our drink order, the wait staff was pleasant, friendly and attentive."], ["STEVEN W.", "Great happy hour prices. \u00a0I had the Scallops, they were a little salty and would not recommend. However, the server asked to redo them and I ate them as is. \u00a0The bread before the meal was great. \u00a0They have a huge selection of alcohol. \u00a0The pizza was great and looked delicious. \u00a0I would try this place again."], ["Tom M.", "Oddly enough EVERYTHING was great .I had a bone in ribeye with a veal reduction sauce with a farm fresh fried egg on top.My goodness was it good!"], ["Patrick C.", "Outstanding food & bartenders!

We ordered the pimento cheese and bread as an appetizer as well as the pork belly over creamy polenta. Both were great and not much was left on our plates. The pork had great flavor and the pimento cheese spread was a great addition to the garlic bread. I ordered the gulf shrimp as my main course. Angel hair pasta with olive oil and Italian spices with lots of shrimp. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the spices on the pasta really topped it off. Our server was outstanding as well. This place definitely stands out as a favorite!

Staff is friendly and very responsive. The lunch entrees we got were the special of the day of brisket, potatoes, and Brussels Sprouts with bacon. Tasted fresh and a great deal for $11. The steak kabob could use a little more refining. Price of $14 comes with 1 side but no starch (rice pilaf would go great) which can leave you leaving unfulfilled. The meat was cooked very well, but 2 main drawbacks: way too much oil is left in dish intended to be part of the sauce and not enough bell peppers to add some crunch to the dish."], ["Rich R.", "Couldn't believe I found this in Jackson Mississippi - the food was amazing, drinks superb and service to boot. The bacon, mushroom and egg pizza rocks.....what the won't tell you on the menu is the pizza has a nice hint of truffle on it.....excellent....

We were greeted with a smile by our server/bartender Nick. Although he was very busy at the bar, he was always very attentive. The food was amazing and delicious! I was kicking myself wondering why I didn't discover this place EARLIER! We ordered the Pork Belly app, the Caesar, the mushroom risotto, the prosciutto pizza, and the Pannacotta dessert with Red Wine poached pears with a raspberry drizzle with phyllo crisps. Everything was spot on, plenty of flavor, and all the right balance of textures. The pizza comes with four silicone ramekins of condiments - fresh dried fragrant oregano, grated parmigiano, large sea salt flakes (Maldon?), and what every pizza should have sprinkled on it, red chili flakes. Nice touch!

The bartenders are really friendly and great at recommending cocktails to try, and their Best Damn G&T is to die for. My only complaint--and the only reason it gets less than 5 stars--is that the hostesses are absolutely abysmal. They're not attentive at all when you walk in. Recently, my friend called to make a reservation, and the hostess told her no reservation was needed that evening because the restaurant wasn't crowded or booked at all. Well, when my friend arrived, despite all but 3 tables being empty, the hostess said they couldn't be seated for 45 minutes b/c all the tables were for reservations. The hostesses really bring down what is otherwise an amazing restaurant and definitely one of the best in Jackson."], ["Christina M.", "Upon entering the restaurant on a Friday early evening we were asked by the hostess if we were there for happy hour. We replied that we were really there for dinner and were seated in the back of the restaurant. The menu stated that happy hour was from 3-6 and included 1/2 price pizza and discounted cocktails. My husband ordered a beer and a pizza and I had the shrimp and grits. Service was ok. Food was good. However when the bill arrived we were charged full price for the beer and pizza. When we mentioned to the waitress that it was still happy hour time and could we get our discount, she replied \"no, that's only for people sitting in the bar or patio\" and would not give us the discount. She said this happens to a lot of her customers and the conversation is always awkward but there wasn't anything she could do about it. Not sure why sitting in one place qualifies for happy hour prices when another location does not, wish this was made clear by the hostess when we were seated."], ["Ryan D.", "I rarely ever write reviews, but the Manship boasts amazing food mixed with great service. I tried the calamari (excellent tomato sauce) had the hanger steak with grits. Everything about this meal was perfect. The chef has opted to avoid superfluous amounts of sauces and veiling ingredients and has chosen to instead perfect the meats with basic seasonings. The entree sizes are perfect and the wide variety of addon side items allow for dozens of combinations. The atmosphere is also excellent and the staff is top notch.

The service has been...OK, but not good.The atmosphere gives the impression that you will be having a really special dining experience. The price would lead you to expect that you will be having a really special dining experience. Even the way they package left-overs in these fancy little boxes gives the impression that you are at a high-end restaurant.Let me be clear, I don't mind paying a great deal of money for a fabulous dining experience. However, for the prices here (which I consider to be the high side of moderate) I expect food and service that is a bit better. I don't expect 5-star food and service, but better than somewhere like Applebee's. On our latest visit, we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes appetizer. They seemed to be under cooked and the consistency was off. I had the Lobster Fettuccine and as another reviewer posted, \"the sauce was like milk both in consistency and taste. That rich flavorful Alfredo that normally comes with it was watered down or made improperly.\" I can't find it on the menu, so it may have been a special. It was good, not great. There was very little seasoning to it and very little crab. The portion was large though.My wife's dish was so unmemorable that we cannot recall what she ordered. Obviously nothing particularly great or particularly bad. That really sums up our overall dining experiences here, not particularly great, but not particularly bad either. It is perfectly adequate. I probably only go here once every year to year and half and that is just about long enough to forget that I was a bit disappointed last time. \u00a0I think for the prices, it should be a bit better.

It is fine.Some other reviews have noted that sometimes they rely on too much sauce or cheese and too much salt. I'd definitely agree here. One particular instance was a salmon salad, nothing fancy, just a bit of salmon dropped on top of some mixed greens. The salad, however, had way too much olive oil and lemon juice. So much that it really interfered with the salmon.There are definitely some tasty dishes but nothing is going to blow you away here.The food is generally well prepared, however.

This review is atypical of my previous experiences but it was so horrible it is worth voicing!The service: The waiter just didn't give us the attention like we mattered. He wasn't that busy, but even when he did come to our table he didn't ask or offer anything outside of taking our order. The manager was young, not-confident, lacking genuine concern for customer satisfaction and again didn't ask or offer us anything outside of fixing our problem bass on our suggestion. The chef and or cooks had to have been short cutting because everything was horrible!The food: My entree was the Lobster Fettuccine and not only was the lobster still blue but the sauce was like milk both in consistency and taste. That rich flavorful Alfredo that normally comes with it was watered down or made improperly. The manager brought me my bowl, and it was incredibly obvious as the liquids sauce sloshed around that it wasn't right. He should've never placed it in front of me.My brother's ravioli was over cooked and under salted. The filling was mostly gone and the pasta was a hardened yellow color. The manager did offer to replace my entire, so I ordered the Beet, Goat cheese and Arugula salad. My brother had finished eating by the time they got it to me so it was not comfortable with him having to wait for me. There was some in identified ingredients in the salad and the arugula salad was not only old and rotting but the tough core of the Arugula was not chopped ours.My brother and I were in shock. \u00a0They messed up 3 dishes. They offered free dessert and we turned it down. Free or not we wanted to get out of there first because I was starving a needed to get food somewhere else and 2nd because we couldn't trust them to remake anything.It's clear based on this incredibly horrific experience that the chef and cooks, manager and server cared nothing about the quality of our food or experience.I only hope they can redeem themselves, they'll only get one chance from me if I work up the guts to take the risk.

It damn sure ain't no Olive Garden or Carrabba's. It's also in a pretty nice part of town (there's a Rolex dealer next door, and a Brooks Brothers within walking distance).During my last visit, I sat at the bar with my girlfriend. The bartender, whose name escapes me at the moment, was awesome. He was a young guy, late twenties, and I believe he had recently graduated from nursing school. This guy is a rock star at what he does; very personable and a good conversationalist. If I'm not familiar with the menu and I get the feeling that my server has similar tastes, I'll hit them up for suggestions. Everything he recommended was great. First we tried a peach on prosciutto appetizer. Peaches on cured ham sounds crazy, right? It was da BOMB! My girlfriend and I shared an entree: baked ziti. I'm not a big pasta guy, but I enjoyed it.The app and entree were great, but honestly, the real reason I came here was for dessert. So diabetes runs in my family, but YOLO. I love bread pudding. If a restaurant has it on the menu, I'm ordering it. I had it both times I've dined here. The first time, I had their standard white chocolate bread pudding. It's so good, I don't even know where to begin. It's like jumping off of Mount Everest wearing a wingsuit, while Jimmy Page plays a thirty minute extended version of the Stairway to Heaven guitar solo. IN YOUR MOUTH. Hands down the best I've ever had. The bartender recommended I try the bread pudding bomboloni, which was basically flash fried pieces of bread pudding with rum sauce and vanilla ice cream, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar (if I recall correctly). IT.WAS.AMAZING.. Like Zeus himself came down from Olympus and shot a sugary lightning bolt in my mouth. If i lived near this place, I'd probably dessert here every day.

The waitress was very nice and kept refilling teas and water, which is always an important part of any meal. I went with the half and half lunch special - half of a Caesar salad, half of the chicken piccante pizza. The salad was laughably small, just funny how small it was. The pizza was overwhelmingly large - I eat a lot and I could not finish it. The pizza was amazeballs though.The chicken piccante pizza is spicy grilled chicken, smoked bacon, leeks, Montchevre goat cheese, on Italian cheese. Yummy, delicious, amazing. Everything blended together well and the goat cheese finish was just impressive. Strong, lots of flavor, I can't help but thinking about it and wanting it again.

The wedge was just as I was craving. Pretty standard. The ravioli was not at all what I was expecting. It was in a very light olive oil and butter sauce with large pieces of walnut and small cubes of squash.

They can use some work on the drinks; my advice is not to have a drink containing St. Germaine on the menu if you're unable to get it.

Two of our party had shown up late (the reservation was for 5:15 but that should not matter - and they would not accommodate them because of the lateness; i.e get them a chair. They then had a audacity to stick a gratuity on the bill (which I can see because of the party) but if you really stick it to your patrons you should remove a gratuity. Strike two.The manager kept saying that, in no way, was he asking us to leave. In my book, if someone tells me that my table has been reserved - and I'm waiting for my dessert - then you are essentially asking me to leave. Strike three.The waitress was apologetic - until the end. She even began crying. When she came back with the receipts, she threw mine down on the table - and I'd been nice and not said a word to her. However, one guy in our party commented that we'd be going somewhere else next time.

The parking lot is always crowded, even on weeknights, which is rather indicative of their popularity amongst locals. Once inside, the bar area is usually flowing nicely with guests grabbing a drink during their wait or with those finishing up their meal and offering seats to those waiting. I've dined at the bar once with my hunny and the service was impeccable. We had the most attentive bar tender who even offered to give us a smaller portion of the carne pizza (I forget the exact name) since we wanted something to snack on with our drinks; for dinner, he had our pasta dish nicely split into two bowls. Absolutely delightful. When a regular guest complained about the pasta, the same bartender had the meal removed from his bill. I have also dined at a table a few times and while the service has been good there, as well, I'd have to say my experience at the bar has been the best one yet at Amerigo.On to food, if you don't like Italian, you're not totally out of luck. The pizzas are delicious and I'm sure you could find a few other appetizers to suit the non-Italian seeking palate. I, for one, love all things carb, and I have yet to be displeased with a dish. I always swap out the marinara sauce for alfredo (hi calories!!) so they can easily handle such substitutions. My hunny enjoys their steak and their soup of the day is always a nice starter, as well.

For my meal, I decided to order some pasta since I figured that would probably be an Italian restaurant's specialty. Man, I was disappointed. I got the tortellini with grilled chicken. First of all, the tortellini kind of tasted weird. Secondly, the chicken was about 1/4\" thick. No lie. I've never seen chicken breast that thin and unappealing. And it wasn't just my dish, others in the group that ordered pasta with chicken also had flat, dry, flavorless chicken. The place wasn't all bad - the service was very friendly. The atmosphere is pretty nice but as others have said, a little cramped. This definitely seems like an establishment for old housewives to frequent and be \"seen\" at. Definitely a bit of a snobby vibe but not overwhelmingly so. I would go back , the salads looked really good so I'd probably opt for that next time.

Friendly staff, work well together !!"], ["Aaron Ray A.", "If you are looking for an alternative to fried greasy food and want something fresh this is it! \u00a0 This place sparkles it is so clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. \u00a0I hope you enjoy it as much as did."], ["Melissa B.", "I love Pita Pit! I've had it numerous times and it's always delicious. The only negative was when I ordered online because I needed it delivered two hours in the future. When I received it, it was soggy and lukewarm, as if it had been sitting out for the two hours in advance. I'll try it again because I love Pita Pit for their delicious and non-greasy food, but I hope it'll be made fresh next time I need to place a future order!"], ["Molly P.", "I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and it was delicious! Mine was to go, but the restaurant was so clean and inviting that I thought about just eating there. I love Pita Pit, and this was definitely the best experience I've had at one."]], "Keifer's Restaurant": [["Michelle C.", "Keifers in the old location was great when I was in high school in the Jackson Metropolitan and those memories paved the way to this trip to Keifers in the new location- they did not disappoint. The pita wraps are delicious!Service is fabulous! The porch is the perfect ambiance for this style cuisine!"], ["Richard L.", "A go to spot in the Belhaven area, it does a lot of things kinda well, no real stand outs. I usually get a wrap and the cottage fries. The fries are different quite often, which I brought up to a gentleman in the front whom I assumed gave a damn, but turned out he really couldn't care less. Anyway, I stopped going, and tried Jimmy John's across the street for the first time. Yeah, maybe I'll try Keifer's again."], ["Sarah T.", "I really like this place. It can be crowded at times, but it's a local favorite. The employees are so energetic and attentive and it's such a neat environment. The food is pretty good, but the hummus is amazing. I seriously eat like a whole plate by myself ever time. It's hard to go wrong on this menu. Go eat here and enjoy your Greek experience!"], ["Cody M.", "Keifer's is widely known as a Jackson staple. It's often the first restaurant people visit when in town as well. Since moving locations (only across the street), the atmosphere doesn't quite reach what it used to be, but the overall feel of the place is just as good, and probably cleaner and sharper. I've loved eating here my whole life, and have gotten just about every wrap on the menu, never finding one that I haven't liked. The feta sauce is a definite add on, adding bold flavor to a wrap or to the tasty cottage fries. Though not quite hitting the \"authentic Mediterranean\" mark, it's still very tasty and an awesome local restaurant!"], ["Erica A.", "Good was good. For lunch was a bit more than I usually pay. No kids menu options. Sliced potato was fantastic, service was fast and nice restaurant."], ["Cherry D.", "We got the gyro, hummus, dolmas, and falafel for about $26 total. It must have been an off day or something, because this place has such good reviews, but I was hella disappointed today. I did not like the flavors at all! The humus needed more garlic and lemon, and it was chunky! They should have blended the garbanzo beans a little longer. The falafel just tasted like it was deep fried in old oil. The gyro was dry. Greek food is my favorite and I'm sad that this place was such a disappointment."], ["Jennifer S.", "Usually a great place to eat, but must have been off their mark today. I ordered a Gyro with no onions, and shared a cottage fries with my husband. My Gyro was not warm and the meat was dry. There was a big old lettuce leaf stuffed in it gobbed with their cucumber dressing. I had to spoon out the dressing because it was just way, way to much. We sent the fries back because they had apparently been cooked an hour or so prior, waiting on the lunch crowd. \u00a0I don't know if this place is under new management \u00a0or not, definitely needed improvement today. Sorry Keifers!"], ["Tiffany Y.", "This is one of my favorite lunch spots when I visit my family in Jackson. \u00a0You order at the counter, and they call out to you to get your food. \u00a0Doesn't take them long to fix anything either. \u00a0I usually get the veggie wrap with mozzarella and their awesome curly fries. \u00a0My mother usually gets the chicken gyro, and my sister gets their burger. \u00a0The food is good and the atmosphere is pretty laid back with the food served on plastic trays with paper plates and drinks in styrofoam cups. \u00a0But it's a cool hole in the wall kinda place in downtown Jackson, I mean it's what Jackson is good for at times... hole in the wall places with good food. \u00a0Oh and they close at 2:30 so sometimes it's a challenge to get there before they close, but it's well worth it if you can make it for lunch."], ["Chaitanya K.", "I travel to Jackson almost every other week and lunching at Keifers makes it worth the long haul. My staple is the chicken gyro and curly fries. I have lost count of the number times I have eaten here in the past year but the food has always been consistently tasty. The seasoning on the curly fries is to die for. Only once have I tried the regular beef and lamb gyro but didn't find it as flavorful. Doesn't matter, I will stick to my usual order of the chicken gyro and curly fries."], ["Kim C.", "Quaint restaurant with inside and outside seating. You are greeted at the door and handed menus to seat yourself. Very tastefully decorated. We were waited on quickly and our waiter was nice and polite and met our needs without us needing to chase him down. We chose to eat here because it is walking distance from the hospital that my husband will be in for surgery coming up. When I asked if they had a paper menu and explained the situation the lady at the register told she was sorry but they were out of paper menus. BUT...she grabbed one of the laminated menus and let me take it. So now....they not only have customers that are happy they won't have to eat hospital food but they have customers that will shout from the rooftops what great customer service we received!"], ["Count D.", "After reading the other Yelp reviews, I went into Keifer's with solid expectations. Sadly, I was quite disappointed. But let me be fair - this is by no means some Mediterranean restaurant where I expect everything to be top-notch, tradtional, big flavors, etc. I was expecting a solid gyro to satiate that craving. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.Ordered the standard gyro with a side of fries with it. The cashier asks \"cottage or curly?\" Me, having never heard of cottage fries, asks \"what's cottage fries?\"\"straight-cut fries\"\"okay I'll take those then\", thinking these are your standard fries. I wish I would have listened to Tiffany Y's review and went with curly fries!When my order was ready (the one thing this place did right was make my food hot & fast), I saw the fries were basically humongous chips. Imagine taking a potato and slicing it long-ways so you have chips the size of a potato! Not what I was expecting, but they were messy to eat. In a good way, I guess. I would have definitely preferred the curly fries - my mistake. It was basically eating an entire baked potato, but fried.On to the main meal, the bread & butter of any gyro place, the gyro itself. This was such a HUGE LET DOWN. The only thing going for it was that it was hot.NO TOMATO??? NOT ONE SLICE???BARELY any onions, the SMALLEST LITTLE PIECES! GIVE ME SOME RED ONION SLICES.What kind of disgrace is that?! You don't even deserve to be called a gyro!I made sure to take a bite of the meat itself to analyze the flavor, and I was honestly disappointed. It was okay at best. The meat was under-seasoned, oily, a little spongy, and somewhat thin. My sandwich was basically meat, pieces of lettuce, and yogurt sauce (which wasn't even that good, mind you). I was bummed out, to say the least.I had to do some kind of investigating. Maybe not getting tomatoes was a fluke, an accident by the chef. But after reading the menu, NOPE. Only comes with lettuce, onions, and sauce. Very sad. This would make your sandwich so much tastier and heartier. Not to mention I saw an entire fridge full of them when I was ordering. Nonetheless, I finished my gyro and left. Regardless of the other reviews, I don't think I will ever come back to Keifer's. I was so disappointed with my lackluster gyro that I am just not willing to try their other menu options (although some of them did sound quite appetizing).RESTAURANT STAFF: If you're reading this, there is NO WAY someone is paying $6 for hummus! You'd have to give me a PLATEFUL, or it would have to be extremely delicious. Which I don't think this place is capable of making amazing hummus anyways. Really glad I skipped on that one."], ["Deidre B.", "The bacon cheeseburger at Keifer's downtown is the best in Jackson! Seriously! My kids and I eat here more than we should : ) They think the curly fries with the special seasoning is the best thing they've ever eaten. I know most people eat Greek food at a Greek restaurant but if you don't get the burger, you're really missing out!"], ["Bruce D.", "Great food, Lots of atmosphere. We went for lunch and the place was packed. The staff was super friendly and helpful."], ["Chris and Tami T.", "Look, we really had a good time in Jackson, Mississippi. \u00a0Everyone told us \"BEWARE, JACKSON IS LIKE ALL KINDS OF RED NECKS AND RACISTS\" but you know what? \u00a0We LOVED the people we met in Jackson! \u00a0So...Dear People Hatin' On Jackson,You need to shut up. \u00a0We went to this place called Keifer's...and while we have had better Mediterranean fare in place with a heavier Mediterranean population, this place was pretty good for what it was working with...that being...(I am assuming) a more modest Greek culture in the area. \u00a0This was the Tex-Mex version of Greek food - kinda Americanized but still totally yummy. \u00a0So, haters, go to Keifer's when you are in Jackson and talk to the hard working Keifer's folks about fun things and stop being such punks about the south. \u00a0Love,Chris and Tami(representing Deep South for real, y'all)Thumbs up."], ["Lee H.", "I try to go to Keifer's whenever I am downtown at lunch time. The downtown location is not open for dinner. \u00a0The gyros are fantastic, and since I visit infrequently that's what I always get. I tried the roasted red pepper humus this time too. Really good."]]}
