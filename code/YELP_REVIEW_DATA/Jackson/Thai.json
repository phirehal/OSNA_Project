Nice touch, probably not really authentic Thai, but different and a nice touch.Appetizers: I got the sample platter of three items. Unfortunately it was fried to death. No taste, lots of crunch. Pass. Spring roll was pretty good though.Also got the sweet and sour soup. Holy Cow, or elephant as they seem partial to elephants here. It was HOT. Scalded my mouth temperature wise and very peppery hot too. A little too much maybe, not very sweet. Pass.Main course was the green curry with chicken. Very good indeed. Sadly they don't use sticky rice here which would have gone down a lot better. But the dish was very good and I would recommend it.

However, when the food came out and I started eating, it wasn't satisfactory.I ordered the pad see ewe and a cup of tom ka and steamed rice. Pad see-ewe was bland, thick noodles, and was missing the egg. They didn't offer tom yum soup in a cup so I resorted to the bland tom gah even though I asked for medium spice.

I go when I jones for the crunchy bamboo shoot noodles that is in the Red Curry Chicken which the weekday buffet offers, along with one or two other nice offerings. Regretably the small buffet does not offer enough diversity from day to day to not get tired of pretty quick. And at night and weekends the menu is about 30% higher than it should be. So to satisfy a diverse pallete its really too expensive. Pan Asia offers the next closest thing, as a Asian Fusion restaurant, but we could really use a 2nd thai place. If you've been to the big city Thai places, in Atlanta or elsewhere, the Thai House isn't quite there. I wish the peanut sauce wasn't such a commodity. They only give a saucer full.

We questioned the total, and he pulled out another receipt from under the top one and said there were two! We look like a couple (rings on too), but looks aside, we were never asked when seated if it was one check or two. We did not think that $30 for 2 buffet lunches was worth the selection they offered. We can get better food elsewhere in Jackson for that price, though not Thai. Yes, we probably should have asked how much the buffet ran.

They've been in Jackson for 2 years now, but I just tried them for the first time. \u00a0The food is great and reasonably priced. I went with friends and we ordered the curry puffs for an appetizer which were really good but kinda pricey ($6 for 3 puffs). I got the Green Curry, my friends got the Massaman curry and the pad thai. \u00a0Both loved their dishes, and I loved mine! We all ordered our mild, but there was still some heat. I always feel silly ordering mild dishes at places that are traditionally spicy, but I really am not built for spicy. You are given the chance to order it however spicy you want when you order. I asked for \"as mild as you can make it,\" but those who know green curry know that it's one of the more spicier Thai dishes. I was definitely face sweating and tearing up a little bit at the mild level. But it was so good I don't care!!!!So the only downside is the service. Only one woman was waiting on all the tables. She was a little discombobulated for the most part and couldn't remember which table asked for what sometimes. Also, all of our dishes came at separate times. The pad thai came with the appetizer (what.) and the green curry came 5 minutes before the massaman curry. I'm sure you've also read below and around the web that this place is BYOB. They've recently instated a \"corkage\" fee for alcohol. \u00a0Before 7:00pm I think it's around $6, which is reasonable. But later than that, it shoots up to freakin' $15. \u00a0That's just ridiculous. What's the point of bringing anything then? Honestly, that kinda makes me mad. I've been to upscale restaurants in Chicago that are BYOB and they only charge a flat $5.

But they are very nice people - from the moment you walk in the door, to the moment you leave - they are grateful that you came and did business with them. Whereas with Fusion, I've had some bumps along the way - and we are repeat customers, so that kind of troubles me.

I have to get Tom Kha at any Thai place I go to. It's my pad thai (which is the plate some people use to judge a Thai restaurant), which I never really order since it's usually on the sweeter side for me. There was more coconut milk than I was used to but still good. Finally, the Pad See Iew with beef was a giant plate that I couldn't finish but smelled and tasted equally delicious.

This isn't a crap-shoot Thai restaurant that just throws more crushed red pepper onto their dishes when you ask for something high on the spicy end of the spectrum, you'll actually be able to taste all of the delicious flavors in your meal without your taste buds being burned off in the first 10 seconds, even if you order \"Double Thai Hot\" which isn't even listed on the menu, but being a regular I ordered frequently. \u00a0The staggering fact of it is that even though I'm now living in an area (Seattle) with 10,000% more Asians in the demographic, not 1 of the many Asian restaurants I've been to so far has used any spicing method other than throwing a bunch of crappy crushed red pepper onto their food. Even in a hub of many different Asian cultures, the way Thai Tasty spices it's food stands alone, and I can only hope that some day I find another restaurant that knows how to do spicy Thai food half as well as they do at Thai Tasty. \u00a0If ever the restaurant's staff should read this, even after the name changes my wife and I went through, you'd probably remember me by the silver beard bead and leather jacket I wear.

Or, maybe I shouldn't have gone to their toilet! lol***"], ["Greg M.", "I really wanted to like this place, because I love Thai, I love sushi and I love the Fondren neighborhood, due in large part to the plethora of great restaurants in the area. \u00a0Sadly, Surin isn't one of them. \u00a0The setting, on the ground floor of a retro-looking office building, has the feel of a hotel lobby bar/restaurant. \u00a0 \u00a0Nothing fun about it. \u00a0The service is fine. \u00a0The coconut milk soup (aka Tom Kah soup) is quite good, and complimentary at lunch. \u00a0The sushi rolls we tried (server recommended) were mediocre, as was the cashew nut chicken. \u00a0I can't think of any good reason to go back to this totally forgettable eatery, especially with several, very good and unique restaurant options within a few blocks of this dud."], ["Paul W.", "Nice lunch specials, which are available everyday! I had the curried duck, which was delicious, however, the lunch portion was very small. \u00a0The restaurant is beautiful, and large. \u00a0Had wonderful service. \u00a0Overall a good experience, except I am not sure it is a very good value."], ["Hannah G.", "I like to give a business two chances before I write it off completely. My first experience was ruined by bland, oily food. However, the weather was great, and my server was very nice. My second experience was ruined partly by the same terrible food, but mostly by the ten minutes we spent not being greeted on a slow night while our server lost their very visible argument with the host over not wanting to take our table. The service was somehow worse than the food. I felt like I was eating in a failing airport restaurant. Sorry so critical, but I love Fondren, and I would love to see a better business in place of this one."], ["Rachel P.", "After weeks of waiting, I finally had a chance to grab lunch here and I was DEFINITELY not disappointed! Located centrally in Downtown Fondren, Surin of Thailand is an easy and safe walk to lots of other popular spots-- like the Apothecary, Fondren Public, Fondren Cellars, etc. It's a great place to go for lunch if you want to explore Fondren a bit, or a great place to start your big night out on the town! If you ever had a chance to eat at Nick's, which is the restaurant that occupied the space Surin is now in (and I miss it all the time. they had the BEST brunch. oh, man. okay... back to my Surin review), the atmosphere is similar. At lunch, it's definitely casual. There were folks in everything from businesswear to shorts and tshirts. At dinner, though, it's probably a bit classier. The restaurant is spacious. There is a sheltered patio that faces Old Canton Road that you can sit on, or there is tons of seating inside the restaurant. In the front, there's a bar with a lot of seating and in the back part of the restaurant is the sushi bar as well as many more tables and booths. There are lots of seating options if you come with a large group, as well. (Though, definitely make a reservation.)Onto the food-- our meal started off with the coconut soup they serve before every entree. I really enjoyed it, but it was definitely very heavy on the coconut. I'm a huge coconut fan, but my friend that I went with wasn't and he wasn't too fond of the soup. It's probably hit or miss for most folks. Luckily for my friend, our entrees came out very quickly after the soup was served. I ordered the thai noodles with chicken and shrimp and it was super flavorful and well-executed. With lots of veggies, spices and peanut, it was everything I was looking for a in a thai dish. The portion was HUGE, but I was really, really hungry so... I took care of it. My friend got the masaman chicken and I had a few bites and it was also excellent. The curry sauce, especially, had an incredible flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of tenderness to it. This place would have gotten five-stars no questions asked, but unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. Upon arriving, we waited four-five minutes for a hostess to seat us and once seated, waited another four-five minutes before anyone welcomed us or asked for our drink order. Throughout the meal, our waiter seemed bored and distracted, and rarely made eye contact with us while taking our order and rarely checked in to make sure everything was okay. I try to be really forgiving and understanding with servers (I waited tables for six years, so I *get* it), but he was just quite unfriendly. The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded, especially considering we were there during peak business lunch hours and I was a bit disappointed in this aspect of the dining experience. Despite that small setback, I supremely enjoyed my time at Surin of Thailand and will definitely be returning to try more dishes there!"], ["Emmi S.", "You cannot beat their lunch specials. The soup is amazing. The chicken noodle bowl is my favorite. \u00a0Sushi is pretty great too. \u00a0Try the super crunch."], ["Nick W.", "Excellent service and excellent food tonight.

Also, the employees are truly lovely :)"], ["Minna Z.", "Always a fantastic experience dining here! The food is delicious, staff is friendly, and atmosphere is sophisticated, yet laid back. I crave spicy food like how regular people crave sweets, and their food hits the spot perfectly. My favorite is their spicy beef noodle and the chicken panang is a close second. The portions are huge, so the price is definitely worth it. Their basil rolls are also delicious! Their lunch deals are also great, but I warn ya that because it is SO great, that they do get pretty busy during lunch hours."], ["Tina L.", "Great food, excellent bar, adult atmosphere, nice happy hour, terrific dessert, pleasant staff.

The atmosphere is very upscale and fresh. \u00a0The staff has been extremely pleasant on both occasions. \u00a0This time I ordered the egg rolls as an appetizer and the spicy beef salad as my lunch entree. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, but some of the other menu items can get a bit pricey for lunch. Still reasonable pricing for a dinner menu.  The coconut curry soup is absolutely delicious. The egg rolls are also very good. While the spicy beef salad was a good choice for a hot summer day, it seems to be lacking something... It certainly was not spicy. The menu had three peppers, which is their highest spice rating, but I felt that it had very little spice to it.Overall, my experience was pleasant, just as it was on my first visit. I will definitely be back again, & I was told to try the duck. I will not likely order the salad again, although \u00a0I'm sure that some people would certainly enjoy the flavor profile. It just was not my favorite."], ["Michael T.", "Been here before and like the place. \u00a0But what I got today... \u00a0Very small sushi roll; nice server; totally tasteless entree. \u00a0Before now, l could not imagined accusing a Thai place of that. \u00a0I was introduced to Thai food 25 years ago by a fellow who was Thai. \u00a0Since then I've been feed a lot of stuff with Thai for a label little of it authentic. None the less I like most of the pseudo-Thai ( not as well as the real stuff but...) \u00a0we couldn't get out of the place fast enough"], ["Kim W.", "The food is really good. I can handle spicy food. So we order pad Thai, thai hot. But it came out plain. The red dick curry was wonderful. Perfect sweetness and duck wasn't chewy. The spicy beef salad very refreshing with a mild kick from the hot oil. Only real complaint. The server seems to be in rush. He really wasn't attentive."], ["Jennifer M.", "I love this restaurant! The lunch specials are great! I can get soup and a good sized entree for a price that a college student can afford.

My husband and I split the potstickers with red curry which was amazing. The red curry sauce was so tasty. Then I ordered the pad Thai and my husband had the beef and broccoli. Both dishes had layered flavors and were very delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was great. They have great service and everything was brought out in a timely fashion. I highly recommend Surin for tasty Thai food. We cannot wait to come back and try more items off the menu!"], ["Richard L.", "Helping a friend move over the weekend, he offered to take me to Surin, and I'm glad he did! Walking in, I didn't expect the upscale decor. We were dressed in shorts and sweat stains. The service was top notch, our waiter Zeus had too much class for a man his age, but it was much appreciated. The food was top notch. Honestly was it the best Thai food ever? No, but it was delicious and the presentation and service really made it more palatable. I'll definitely be visiting often."], ["Aaron Ray A.", "Fondren has another fantastic restaurant. \u00a0If you are looking for flavorful food that is priced well, you have found a new place to eat. \u00a0I cannot say enough about how good the food is. \u00a0They have a full bar and are open on Sundays. \u00a0Next time you are trying to decide on where to eat give Surin a chance, you won't be disappointed."], ["Robert B.", "Second time in for lunch and was pleased with the service I had duck and curry 1st time and was good2nd time in I tried the masaman chicken .

The atmosphere was very upscale, and the wait staff was very helpful. I ordered the yummi yummi roll which certainly lived up to its implied name. About three fourths of the way through my meal I noticed that the glass I had been drinking from for the entire meal had lipstick on the rim. I was unable to catch my sever's attention until the end of the meal. Of course, she was appalled and brought me a clean glass. The manager came by and made jokes about my glass not having \"lips\" the next time I came to the restaurant, which I found to be tasteless for the amount of money I spent."], ["Pai A.", "There are not a lot of good asian restaurants here in jackson, but this one won't disappoint.

Loved the Mississippi Sipper. Don't judge. It was a Don Draper lunch kind of day."], ["Torey C.", "Went to Surin tonight with som friends, as others have said, service was slow and lacked knowledge of the food. Before the food came we were given an bread course of a cinnamon and cheddar biscuit. Though it wasn't bad, it was quite strange to be eating it in a Thai restaurant. I ordered the spicy beef noodle, and I was quite impressed. It was definitely the best Thai food I've ever had in Jackson. I will definitely be coming back, though the lunch menu seems to be the same food as the dinner menu just cheaper.

My son had the green curry with chicken, which was a large bowl with chicken, carrots, bamboo shoots, basil, and more. \u00a0 It was also delicious. \u00a0We ordered the basil roll for an appetizer and it was good, but I probably wouldn't order again unless I was eating super-clean. It included 2 large 4 slice rolls in a spring roll wrapper filled with lettuce, thai basil, cucumber, bean sprouts, and a few shrimp, along with two dipping sauces. \u00a0If you want something light and healthy, it's a good option, but as it came out with the hot food we ended up eating only one of the rolls. \u00a0Our total bill was $32 with tax, but that was for an appetizer two generous servings of very fresh and tasty food. \u00a0Our waitress was friendly and attentive, refilling our water regularly. \u00a0The owner came out to check on us, also.

Well, I was a bit disappointed there were no actual dishes that infuses the two together. Decor is dark, but clean. Nothing fancy here at all, just a few Thai ornaments here and there. Service is not the most prompt, but we did come here during mid-afternoon with only one server working with 7 tables to serve.The menu is divided into a Japanese section and a Thai section. Basing on all of the other tables around me, seems like the Thai menu is more of the popular choice. We ordered a Pad Thai and a Red Curry dish. The noodles are sweeter and not as sour as the authentic dish, but I have to admit they are not shy on the sprinkling of peanuts on top (I liked that). The curry was also a little disappointing, it did not have lemongrass to help with the flavours. If you want extra rice, be prepared to be charged for it.Definitely not the true authentic experience, but will settle my stomach of Thai cravings until I get home. More cons: the owners and employees are not Thai so may be the excuse for non-authentic taste, they charge for hot tea, an employee parks near the entrance (leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since I've worked in customer service for years)"], ["Baron M.", "I stopped here to grab some takeout one evening when I was looking for something a bit different.
