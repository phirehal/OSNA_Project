On this day, I was flat out disappointed with what I saw. As I reach the bread area I saw a baby roach leaving from the staff side crawling toward the customer exchange area. There were two managers standing behind the young lady serving the bread and I got their attention without making a scene. I pointing to the infraction (pest in the serving area) and one of the mangers grab a paper towel and circled around to the customer side looking for the roach. Not one time did the manager apologize or make any type of gesture which I don't know what could have been said anyway. The killing part is that the customer behind me was an elderly lady and the roach almost fell into her food. I guess I'm writing this review because there were several people on the staff line with what appeared to be two mangers and they all had different conversations going among one another. Very bad customer experience at this location. And \"NO\" I couldn't eat my food. Please be advise that it's a good idea to watch what you put in your mouth."]], "St Anne Catholic Church": [["Donna H.", "Nice location, but the church is just a big open room with drums and guitars. \u00a0Masses in English and Spanish. \u00a0I didn't move to Carthage because I couldn't imagine going to Mass in a place like that. \u00a0Confession before mass and by request."]], "The Manship Wood Fired Kitchen": [["Darius W.", "One of my favorite restaurants to visit for lunch.

My friend and I had to wait a very long time for the server to come to our table, and then he forgot to put in our food order. We waited for over an hour before we finally flagged him down to ask about our food, and he just said, \"whoops,\" and laughed. The table behind us got a free appetizer just for knowing him, and all we got was a \"whoops\" for our food not getting put in. No apology, nothing. I called the manager afterward because I didn't want to make a scene, and he was friendly and apologetic and said he had seen the whole thing and it was unacceptable. He took my address and said that he would send me a gift card for my troubles and said for me to tell him when I came in again so they could give me better service. The gift card never came and I have been too angry to go back. The food may be good, but what we ordered was pretty bland and definitely not worth paying over $30 for a meal just to be disrespected.

Our server was extremely nice, made some great recommendations and checked in on us from time to time. This is one of the cases where great customer service really made the overall experience so much better.Blue crab sandwich - this was a whole soft shell crab, inside a sandwich. I love crab - but I've never had a whole soft shell crab. This was interesting! It's a pretty big sandwich, and I managed to do some good damage on it, but couldn't finish. I think this was one of the specials - so it might not always be on the menu.It came with a side of parmasean fries - eh. I should of picked another side. These were very thin cut fries (I prefer thick cut fries). I know for next time to try one of the other sides that looked great.Ended the meal with some blackberry cobler - They have a free dessert as the Check In offer on Yelp!

I started with a drink called the \"Best Damn G & T\". \u00a0My preference for a G & T is prepared with Bombay Sapphire Gin. \u00a0This G & T was sweet and refreshing; it was not overly sweet. \u00a0I saw cooper mugs at the bar and knew my next drink would be one of my favorites, the Moscow Mule. The bartender did a good job with the drinks.I like duck and had to try the duck wings. \u00a0The duck wings looked and tasted like they were braised in a citrus glaze. \u00a0Six meaty and tender drummettes, garnished with scallions and an orange slice.

Roumalade sauce served with it is fantastic!"], ["Rachel P.", "This place is straight up fantastic. I've been for lunch, brunch, and dinner several times and have never been anywhere close to disappointed. Everything is masterfully done.Let's start with the atmosphere-- the restaurant is relatively small, but still maintains a spacious and open vibe. There's seating at the bar as well as some high top tables for smaller groups when you first walk in. Then, in the proper dining room, there are both booths as well as tables. This is an excellent location to bring a group, especially if you're celebrating. Situated right in Belhaven between Fondren and downtown, this place is central to all the going's-on's here in Jackson, and is a perfect place to start your evening.But let's talk about the food. I eat out relatively often and can be a bit of a food snob, I'll admit. This place regularly blows me away. Everything I've had has been phenomenal. The first time I ate here, I had the steak and it was by far the best steak I've had in town. Better than any of the restaurants \"known\" for their steak! Since then, I've had a variety of dishes from salads to brunch to pizza and everything has left me raving. The menu changes regularly, and features a bevy of local vegetables and produce which I LOVE. I wish more Jackson restaurants would do that. It shows a certain pride in this city, which goes a long way with me. This is a fantastic date locale. It's classy, not stuffy, and quiet enough that you can hear yourself chat but not so quiet that no one chats.Their bar is fully stocked and their drink menu is extensive. They offer a fantastic variety of wines and beers, but I've always been most impressed by their unique and finely crafted cocktails. Service, for me, has always been great. The only time it's ever been a bit slow was when I stopped in for a late lunch but that's to be expected at any restaurant when the wait staff is switching from lunch to dinner mode. Even when it's a bit slow, the wait staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful-- always ready with a recommendation or a menu suggestion. Overall, I can't say enough good things about the Manship. It's one of the most excellent restaurants we've got in town, and I'm so glad to have it here in the neighborhood. Check it out! You won't regret it!"], ["Amanda W.", "I ordered a to go dinner. I was surprised and disappointed to see that each to go item, they would charge $.50 per item. So my 3 items added an extra $1.50 just for it being a to go order. I ordered the smoked wings appetizer, the shrimp bisque, and the couscous side item. I ordered the shrimp bisque based on the recommendation from the lady taking my order. I was not impressed. There was basically no shrimp and instead of a creamy sauce it was more of a broth. The smoked wings were pretty good though I had expected more from the white barbecue sauce, it was peppery and fairly spicy (and not in the tasty way) in my opinion.The couscous was something to brag about though. This is also a recommendation from the lady who took my to go order. I wanted the Parmesan truffle fries but she said they were a special and they no longer carried them at this moment. She offered the couscous as a substitute, and she actually got this one right. It had small cut mushrooms with some Parmesan and some truffle oil. Recommended! I did enjoy the look of the restaurant, especially the outside patio area."], ["Ryder T.", "Soon after The Manship opened, I had dinner there and was very impressed. Jackson has had a lot of good restaurants (and still does) but this one really took the cake in all ways. The food was amazing, the service top-notch and the atmosphere felt like I was in a much bigger more impressive city. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food!They have an excellent brunch - probably the most creative and tasty brunch in Jackson right now. The happy hour is also not to be missed. Half off cocktails and pizzas is perfect for an after work drink and snack or a full blown early dinner date! The last time I went to the happy hour, the mixologist (I only use the term because he was actually our waiter at the time, not the bartender, though he had come up with many of the cocktails) was happy to hang around and tell us about how the cocktail combinations had come about. The staff is always knowledgable about where the food comes from and how it is prepared.The only issues I have had with them is weekday lunch - but this is a more difficult time for most restaurants. The food was excellent, of course, but the service was a little lacking. That is to be expected at a busy lunch place like this, however.MAC & CHEESE LIST - This Mac & Cheese is different. It is not your standard comfort food style, so if you are looking for Velveeta (no judgement zone - sometimes we are!) this is not your place. Today it was Pancetta Mac & Cheese (see pic) which was awesome, but it has been a different formulation in the past. Definitely good, but lighter on the cheese than most places. Worth getting for sure though.MUST HAVE DISHES IN JACKSON - The Best Damn G&T. Like the name says, it is the best G&T you'll have, at least until you figure out how to make it yourself. They make it with top notch gin and Jack Rudy tonic. I wouldn't advise the new BDG&T version 2.0, the tonic is gross."], ["Blanca V.", "The food was great!

The salad was fresh, presented well and the shrimp were just melt in your mouth good. The pizza was a tad greasy, but it didn't take away from the flavor. We got the free desert for checking in, and ordered the cobbler. It was DELICIOUS. The crust was so light and crumbly I could eat 2 of those by myself. In short no complaints.

Fortunately we aren't that sensitive but we appreciated his thoroughness in verifying the items. \u00a0I ordered the salmon salad but asked for the kale to be changed for the local lettuces, omit onion, and add feta. \u00a0They did this without a charge (although they did leave onions on - no problem as I could easily remove them.) \u00a0My dining partner had the simmons catfish with parmesan fries. \u00a0Our order came quickly given the lunch rush. \u00a0My salad was very good. \u00a0The portion was relatively small, but it ended up being enough. \u00a0It included lettuce, finely diced cucumber, kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and a feta vinaigrette. \u00a0My son had 3 nice sized filets and a cup of fries. \u00a0He liked the fish but really raved about the fries. He said the parmesan permeated the entire dish, not just the fries on top. \u00a0Being yelpers, I pulled the listing up and saw a free dessert with entree offer with check in. \u00a0We had the chocolate mousse. \u00a0It was excellent and a nice sized serving. \u00a0It was a complex dish with several layers and flavor profiles - chocolate, crust, ganache, cream, raspberry drizzle, and mine. \u00a0And it was complimentary, so there's that! \u00a0I will go back and try something else. \u00a0It was above average food and service. \u00a0Prices were a little steep for lunch (2 entrees, no drinks was $35 with tip) but it was very good."], ["Jon D.", "Very good, prices are a little high but you get what you pay for - worth the price.

The shrimp and grits were out of this world, the pimento cheese is a perfect creamy texture with a little heat. My crawfish pizza was amazing. The crust was just crisp enough to hold up to the buttery sauce. They have a great happy hour with half price pizzas. The strawberry tart with ice cream was the perfect compliment to finish the meal. The Manship is one of the very few reasons to visit Jackson again."], ["Ann M.", "The manship is one of my favorite sit down dinner spots in Jackson, and it's my all time favorite happy hour! Half off pizza's and drinks- YES! Every pizza I've eaten so far has been divine, and the porch-swing and heat index always hit the spot. As for dinner, simple sides like their any gratin potatoes or and veggie dish have satisfied my appetite. Personally, I go for the brocollini and some divine crab beignets . The duck and the filet are terrific, as well as the salmon and redfish. We used the Manship for our wedding rehearsal dinner and were so pleased! The services were great, and all of our guests were extremely happy with their food. I recommend them for events, for happy hour, and for a fun date night! Definitely in my top five for favorite Jackson restaurants."], ["Lisa G.", "Food was amazing as well as the staff.

The reduction sauce on the steak is amazing. I had the Prime cut. Best Mac and Cheese I've ever tasted. My wife got the Greek chicken, little dry in the middle but lots of great flavor.

The decor was beautiful and the restaurant very clean underneath a hospital it was apparent that the customer attraction was young professional- the restaurant was very busy- \u00a0we were seated immediately. The waitress introduced herself and said that the restaurant had many different foods but many dishes have a bit of Lebanese twist and spice added., since the chef was Lebanese. We ordered the tuna dip, and duck wings as appetizers. The duck wings were very good and greasy but had barely any meat on them. The tuna was actually a very good dip. For an entree I ordered the Rabbit pasta- to my surprise rabbit was a little salty of a meat- but furthermore the pasta dish was incredibly small- this was unexpected for a 18 dollar dish. My colleague got the strip steak which tasted remarkable but was a very little bit. The third colleague ordered a pork shoulder- which I cannot comment on because I do not knowingly eat pork. The desert was the best thing i got Tiramisu which was free with checkin was absolutely delicious maybe the best thing I got \u00a0Anyway with 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 2 drinks- 62 bucks.

We asked the server tons of questions and he answered all of them patiently and honestly. After thorough discussions with the server, browsing through Yelp photos and some meditation, we ordered: the white bbq wings, marinated crab claws, burrata apps, ribeye deckle, parm reggiano fries, mushroom bacon egg pizza entrees and for dessert the chocolate mousse and tiramisu. If youre having as hard of a time deciding as we did, here's the breakdown:Wings were delicious, nothing out of the ordinary thoughCrab claws are the only thing we wouldnt order again. \u00a0They were tasty but we expected them hot which thru us offThe burrata was the best Ive ever had. Ribeye deckle are medalions that melt in your mouth and is AMAZING. The pizza had generous amounts of exotic mushrooms, nice chunks of meaty bacon and a perfectly cooked poached egg that just made the bite velvety deliciousness. I am a french fry connoisseur and I wouldnt change a thing about these. Perfect size with perfect amount of salty cheese in a perfect portion. I even left a few which is hard for me to rationalize still today. Our desserts were complimentary thanks to our yelp check in! \u00a0The tiramisu is more of a dulce de leche with a slight taste of Bailey's. It was good, just not your typical espresso soaked. The mousse was excellent with a dollop of raspberry that complimented it well. Overall it was an awesome anniversary dinner and we would recommend Manship to everyone in the area.

Our waiter never introduced himself as our waiter (he just appeared and asked for our order) nor told us his name (our receipt says his name was Brandon). In fact, his first few words to us included labeling my friend 'sassy'. We should have known then what would follow...Let's back up...I made a reservation, arrived on time and still had to wait to be seated. Not very long, maybe 10 minutes, but what's the point of a reservation if you have to wait? I wasn't a big deal so I let it go. Anyhow, as I was led to the very back of the restaurant (by the kitchen) I passed by 2 open tables that could have fit our group. \u00a0I let that go too. My friend and I waited at least 20 minutes to place a drink/appetizer order along. Thirty minutes later only \u00a0one of the two appetizers had been received.

Our table was in the back next to the bread station (the worst table possible even though we made reservations and there were other tables open!!!) and ALL of the servers handle it with their bare hands.

Don't forget to check in for the free dessert.We had the red fish, lamb pizza, and rabbit ravioli. Also the Jerusalem artichokes, carrots, and braised greens as sides. All was excellent. Fish was light and flaky. Pizza wasn't too greasy but the lamb is strong just as a warning. Rabbit ravioli was a bit small but again not too greasy and the rabbit isn't too strong. Just slightly chewy and very tasty. Artichokes aren't actually artichokes but actually sun chokes like fingerling potatoes. Carrots great. Greens good but a tad salty.Minus one star bc my parents didn't like the server Patrick and the tirimasu was pretty meh.

So glad we did. First off, the ambiance is wonderful--very laid back but well thought out decor. A huge blackboard is displayed right next to the open air kitchen--listing the locally-sourced ingredients at Manship.I had the Fennel Sausage pizza since they have a wood fired oven. It was delicious as it sounds. The crust was crispy and flavorful just as it should be.My sister got the duck leg, egg, and polenta brunch special--that was out of this world good. And the boys went with the Italian Panini sandwich and Roast Beef sandwich--which they were really pleased with. The waitstaff left something to be desired--didn't refill water until we asked, switched up the order, and almost spilled the sandwich on one of us. That's the only reason I knocked off a star.Otherwise Manship is well worth going to."], ["Luke C.", "Regular spot for me and my wife. Always pleased with the food and service. The local sourcing of ingredients is particularly appealing. You're doing it wrong if you don't order the au gratin potatoes."], ["Brandon M.", "Went in tonight for dinner and the meal was terrific. We started with the pork belly which had a fantastic flavor. Our party had the pepperoni pizza, Amberjack, salad, potatoes au gratin and spinach. Each was perfect.

Happy hour is a great deal... Pizzas for $5 and cheap fancy drinks! The best drink is the Porch Swing. It's a sweet adult lemonade with alcohol. Careful, though, the drinks are strong!

Well lit, clean, excellent atmosphere. The bread brought to the table was fresh and served warm. I ordered the chicken wrap. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy.

On our way to Florida, stopped in Jackson MS. Manship was everything the reviews said; it is so worth the stop!

It is so refreshing when a chef takes passion in the fresh, best ingredients and takes pride in using them in the most creative and delicious way! Spectacular!"], ["Orlean S.", "Visited Manship for the first time early on a Sat evening. Parking is a chore at the Belhaven building. The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern. Even though they weren't yet busy, because I had no reservations we were placed next to the bar. I chose Manship not because of the menu online but because of the outstanding pictures of actual dishes they post on Facebook. There is nothing on their appetizer menu that appealed to me. I heard people mention the tuna dip and the waiter recommended it. It really is tunafish with a smoky taste plus saltine crackers and some fancier bread crisps. It tasted OK but I would not order it again for $13. For a salad we ordered the wedge and Mediterranean. The wedge was standard, but I was not impressed with the Mediterranean. I guess I was expecting a Greek salad but this was very different. It had little dressing and was crunchy due to the chickpeas. I would not order it again.Finally for the main courses we had the duck breast and red snapper special. The duck was tasty yet a little chewy as duck often is. The snapper was outstanding - a light flavored fish over risotto and a few squash slices in a wonderful broth. Both dishes need a side so we shared 3: broccolini, fried okra, and tabbouleh. All 3 were terrific. The broccolini was well seasoned, the tabbouleh was good with a little more tang than is usual, but the standout was the fried okra. This should be on the appetizer menu. They were delicious whole fried okras with a roasted red pepper dipping sauce. They are addictive. Overall the Manship was a nice experience. It's too bad the standard menu isn't more to my liking - lacking in appealing appetizers and a larger selection of seafood entrees. But the main course was outstanding - I definitely would return again. Even though we had 3 different people try to take our drink order, the wait staff was pleasant, friendly and attentive."], ["STEVEN W.", "Great happy hour prices. \u00a0I had the Scallops, they were a little salty and would not recommend.

We ordered the pimento cheese and bread as an appetizer as well as the pork belly over creamy polenta. Both were great and not much was left on our plates. The pork had great flavor and the pimento cheese spread was a great addition to the garlic bread. I ordered the gulf shrimp as my main course. Angel hair pasta with olive oil and Italian spices with lots of shrimp. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the spices on the pasta really topped it off. Our server was outstanding as well.

Staff is friendly and very responsive. The lunch entrees we got were the special of the day of brisket, potatoes, and Brussels Sprouts with bacon. Tasted fresh and a great deal for $11. The steak kabob could use a little more refining. Price of $14 comes with 1 side but no starch (rice pilaf would go great) which can leave you leaving unfulfilled. The meat was cooked very well, but 2 main drawbacks: way too much oil is left in dish intended to be part of the sauce and not enough bell peppers to add some crunch to the dish."], ["Rich R.", "Couldn't believe I found this in Jackson Mississippi - the food was amazing, drinks superb and service to boot. The bacon, mushroom and egg pizza rocks.....what the won't tell you on the menu is the pizza has a nice hint of truffle on it.....excellent....

I was kicking myself wondering why I didn't discover this place EARLIER! We ordered the Pork Belly app, the Caesar, the mushroom risotto, the prosciutto pizza, and the Pannacotta dessert with Red Wine poached pears with a raspberry drizzle with phyllo crisps. Everything was spot on, plenty of flavor, and all the right balance of textures. The pizza comes with four silicone ramekins of condiments - fresh dried fragrant oregano, grated parmigiano, large sea salt flakes (Maldon?), and what every pizza should have sprinkled on it, red chili flakes. Nice touch! The prices are fair, you're getting great quality, delicious food so you should pay accordingly, you get what you pay for.We are here for another week and plan to be there practically every night till we leave!

My only complaint--and the only reason it gets less than 5 stars--is that the hostesses are absolutely abysmal. They're not attentive at all when you walk in. Recently, my friend called to make a reservation, and the hostess told her no reservation was needed that evening because the restaurant wasn't crowded or booked at all. Well, when my friend arrived, despite all but 3 tables being empty, the hostess said they couldn't be seated for 45 minutes b/c all the tables were for reservations. The hostesses really bring down what is otherwise an amazing restaurant and definitely one of the best in Jackson."], ["Christina M.", "Upon entering the restaurant on a Friday early evening we were asked by the hostess if we were there for happy hour. We replied that we were really there for dinner and were seated in the back of the restaurant. The menu stated that happy hour was from 3-6 and included 1/2 price pizza and discounted cocktails. My husband ordered a beer and a pizza and I had the shrimp and grits. Service was ok. Food was good. However when the bill arrived we were charged full price for the beer and pizza. When we mentioned to the waitress that it was still happy hour time and could we get our discount, she replied \"no, that's only for people sitting in the bar or patio\" and would not give us the discount. She said this happens to a lot of her customers and the conversation is always awkward but there wasn't anything she could do about it. Not sure why sitting in one place qualifies for happy hour prices when another location does not, wish this was made clear by the hostess when we were seated."], ["Ryan D.", "I rarely ever write reviews, but the Manship boasts amazing food mixed with great service. I tried the calamari (excellent tomato sauce) had the hanger steak with grits. Everything about this meal was perfect. The chef has opted to avoid superfluous amounts of sauces and veiling ingredients and has chosen to instead perfect the meats with basic seasonings. The entree sizes are perfect and the wide variety of addon side items allow for dozens of combinations. The atmosphere is also excellent and the staff is top notch. This is something Jackson has needed.Update: noticed that I had $20 tacked on to my final bill without any knowledge of why only to realize it was their corking fee.

The dressing (lime vinaigrette) was incredibly tasty. I selected the half portion since I ate an appetizer. I highly recommend getting the house made lemonade. Overall, a wonderful dining experience.

If you want a good hand crafter cocktail, definitely try any on the menu. I havent had a bad one yet. Their made to order to table guag is good, but sometimes shotty and unreliable. Depending on the day, and I'm sure, avacado, it tastes different. Love their chips though.My favorite part of the menu has to be the single tacos. I've traveled all through their options but I love their seafood/south mix with the oysters and others that I continuously order again and again, they taste great every time.I guess my only complaint I've ever had is their lack of consecutive service. Some days, I'll have lunch or dinner and it'll be a fantastic server. Others, we're waiting on our server to even order in, which is a shame, because that's what's limiting them to my 4 stars.

For lunch or dinner, it's such an excellent option and definitely some of the best food in town. As far as atmosphere, it's an incredibly cool place. The restaurant is spacious, with both a large dining area as well as a huge bar as well. They've also got a killer patio, that's sheltered so you can dine out there even when it's raining. The patio area boasts a few comfy sofas in addition to high-top tables. Indoors, a projector plays episodes of \"I Love Lucy\" on a giant wall you see as soon as you walk in. Get it? Because Babalu was the name of Ricky's band on the show?? The food here is really, really fantastic. If you're with a group, always splurge for the guacamole. They make it table-side and it's super delicious. As far as entrees, I typically go for the tacos as you can mix and match. You can't really go wrong with their tacos, I promise. If you're not feeling tacos, definitely go for the BabaBurger. It's, without a doubt, one of the best burgers in town. The chopped salad is another excellent option if you want something lighter, and it comes in two sizes!The cocktails here are excellent. The Baba-rita is delicious. They also always have a seasonal margarita and I have never been let down. The drinks are definitely strong, so watch yourself. They've got a great beer selection too. In warmer months (so, like, most of the time) their sangria is an excellent option. My friends and I love to split some guacamole and a couple pitchers of sangria on the patio. The servers are usually super friendly and knowledgable.

It just lacks that... je ne sai quoi, that puts something to a 5 star rating.The food menu really has three things to touch on: appetizers, small plates and tacos. The small plates are great, I have never been too disappointed with one. The tacos are pretty good, but only four stars at best. The appetizers are tasty, some are like basic versions of the small plates.Your strategy should always be to share food. Each dish is basically equivalent size, so you can sometimes economize by getting cheap tacos and an appetizer instead of all small plates. The portions are reasonably generous too, so you can just get one extra for the table if it is just a quick lunch, or maybe 1.5 dishes per person for dinner.MUST HAVE DISHES IN JACKSON - \u00a0You MUST get the Queso Blanco dip. It is the best queso in Jackson, by far. It is a good size portion, so bring plenty of hungry cheese lovers to the table. As you can see from my picture, it has a salsa roja on it and some pic de gallo. It is served in a hot cast iron dish and the edges get all bubbly and crispy and delightful. You cannot lose.The table side made guacamole is a staple, and if you like guac - this may be the best in town. It is little pricey though.The Margaritas are awesome. We had some seasonal Blood Orange ones and a Champarita (made with champagne, duh). The Blood Orange was very nice and subtlety flavored, the Champarita was delicious but a tad sweet.

As a California native and someone who lived in Mexico for 3 months and 6 months in Chile, I would like to believe that I know my Latin American flavors pretty well. I TRIED: Guacamole: One of the best guacamole I have ever had. The guacamole was creamy with a hint of spicy from the jalapenos and tart from the lime. I thought the sun-dried tomato was a unique twist that added more depth to the guac. The chips were fresh too. Fried Calamari: This was just too salty. The Calamari was crispy yes, but if you don't eat them quickly, it gets very oily. The soy sambal glaze was too thick and salty. This appetizer had more of an Asian flavor and I thought was random on the menu. I had a hard time finishing this because it was overly salted. Pan roasted redfish: Delicious! The potato was perfectly cooked. Definitely my favorite. Tacos (Camarones, Ostra, Atun): The Ostra tacos weren't my favorite. As for the other tacos, I wish there was some salsa on the tacos. It was just too dry. The blue corn tortilla was so fragile. It was good, but when I picked up the taco, the tortilla ripped and most of the filling fell out. I was kind of disappointed because I heard good things about the tacos. I like the shrimp and fish but it really lacked more salsa. If you go to any authentic taco stand, there would be a row of salsa up for grabs. When I went to ask for salsa, I was told I had to order the pico de gallo on the side, which was an additional 5$ when all I wanted was a little for my tacos. I ended up with tons of leftover chips and not enough salsa. Overall:I would come back, but maybe I'll bring my own salsa for the tacos."], ["Kayla C.", "Babalu is located in the Fondren area of Jackson. It has a nice open seating area it's a bar and has covered outside seating available. I Love Lucky is projected onto one of the walls which is fun and adds to the feel of the restaurant. Babalu is great for small or large groups.Every day they have new specials -always so creative. I usually choose their specials. If I want to go another route, I choose three tacos from brisket to vegetarian, I've enjoyed them all. My go-to appetizer is always the guacamole. The server comes and mixes it up at your table which adds a nice perk all touch. It can be very busy on weekend night so make sure you come a little early. I would recommend Babalu to anyone visiting the Fondren area!"], ["Anne-Lauren F.", "I absolutely love their appetizers - best hummus in town!

From a Chicago foodie I highly recommend."], ["Chase W.", "This place was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was quick and very friendly, and the atmosphere was inviting and relaxing. Let me start my breakdown by explaining how this place works. First of all, unless you hate that green goodness, getting the table side guacamole is a MUST! That was probably my favorite part of the whole experience. They just bring a big platter and plop that thing right up next to your table that has all the ingredients for some kick ass guacamole. They ask you if you could do without any of the ingredients, and then they make that green crack right there in front of you. And man is it good! The rest of the menu is made up of tapas, tacos, or other more \"normal\" food items such as burgers, etc. They are definitely known for their tapas so I recommend sticking there, but the tacos are a close second. All the tapas and tacos are very small portioned so you have to order a few items to really get stuffed, so keep that in mind. My wife and I came here for our wedding anniversary and we wanted the full experience. After ordering the guac, I chose the crab cake tapas, shrimp taco, and redfish taco. My wife ordered the muscles tapas and the shrimp taco. We also ordered one of the babarita (fruity margarita) and some specialty pineapple margarita. Everything was delicious. I would recommend the babarita highly, especially since it's their special drink. The food was amazing, and even though each order was a small portion, all the orders combined with the guacamole was more than enough to squash my large appetite and leave me nearly busting at the seams. Overall we had an amazing experience and we will most definitely be coming back soon! Ask for Ryan when you come in, he was hilarious and so nice and helpful. He made our experience special too by giving us one of their table sparklers after our meal in celebration for our anniversary."], ["Emmi S.", "This place use to be always on point. Not sure what has happened lately. \u00a0Service has been down and their guac which usually is amazing has been less than lastly. Lacking in flavor and tasting plain. \u00a0Last time we were in I got the special and was not told it was going to be spicy. \u00a0Have been saddened by the decline in quality. \u00a0Maybe it was just a rough patch. Here's hoping."], ["Liz B.", "Confession: I catch myself daydreaming about Babalu's guacamole on a regular basis. It's a little expensive, so be sure to lick the bowl before you're done.Babalu is a great spot for lunch on a sunny day, happy hour with friends, or a date night with someone special. When I have friends visiting from out of town, I always bring them here. I love to curl up on the comfy patio sofas outside and catch up over delicious snacks and drinks.Despite the name \"Babalu Tacos & Tapas,\" I don't think that the tacos are Babalu's greatest strength (though $2 tacos during happy hour are hard to resist!). My friends rave about the Baba Burger, and the Babalu chop salad (with black beans, grilled corn, pumpkin seeds, and cotija cheese) is my personal go-to order. While I'm not always a fan of ordering salads for my main dish, this one is so tasty and filling! Also, don't you dare miss out on the garlic rosti potatoes. Go get 'em!"], ["Anthony S.", "Babalu was a great experience. I flied solo so I went straight to the bar where I was met with a smile and a pretty decent beer selection. I was especially happy to see Mississippi beer options here! For dinner I got the Scottish salmon that sat on top of a fried cheese grits cake - yea, it's as good as it sounds! The salmon was cooked exactly to medium like I ordered and the sauce complimented a light grilled flavor perfectly. I also had to try the grilled red fish taco which is also worth your time. There are a couple of ways that Babalu would receive a 5-star rating from me.1) Fry your taco shells for your tacos. My shell broke apart on the 2nd bite.2) Beer prices for locally crafted brews are inflated. $7?! Coming from CO - that's a little pricey (and the beer didn't deserve that price to be fair)3) TVs for those sitting at the bar! Other than those things my experience was great! I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Jackson area. Also, get the cheesecake bites for dessert if that's your kinda thing. Your tummy will be at max capacity...but isn't that the American way, especially in the South?!

So not sure it was an off night, but it was by far the worst taco I'd ever had in a long time. \u00a0The house made tortilla just didn't blend with the ingredients and the texture was like biting into the dishtowel the silverware was wrapped in on the table. \u00a0The ingredients had no seasoning, no pop, no wow, no zing. \u00a0Even when I asked for some salsa/ pico de gallo it couldn't help the taco. \u00a0I let my sister try it as well and she didn't like it either. \u00a0So after 2 bites, I was done and asked the waitress to take them away. \u00a0I didn't ask for it to be taken off my bill, but they did anyway so that was cool. \u00a0I can say the fries are tasty, but my love of fries cannot make up for a poorly executed tacos. \u00a0So service was fine. \u00a0But there was just one more thing the waitress did that pushed me into meh territory... We ordered the dessert sampler. \u00a0It was simple with 3 desserts a chocolate truffle, bread pudding, and cheesecake. \u00a0So the desserts were okay... the cheesecake wasn't smooth enough for me, the bread pudding needed some more flavor (the texture was good), and the chocolate truffle was rather tasty. \u00a0So when the waitress came back to the table I asked her what type of cheesecake was it... and she couldn't pronounce it... so after a few de de de's from her I said dulce de leche and she said yes that's it and asked me to pronounce it again.... \u00a0Could this have been a little stranger....No it was strange enough for me... \u00a0I just didn't find it cute or professional that she couldn't pronounce the name of the item.So overall, interesting experience... Not a complete turn off for me, but close enough. \u00a0My sister and friend enjoyed their burger and chicken sandwich, so if that's what you're looking for... seems okay in their book, but this was definitely a meh experience for me..."], ["Annie B.", "This is a review from a vegetarian perspective...Babalu is probably my favorite restaurant in Jackson when I'm craving something fresh and vibrant. I'm a big fan of the vegetal tacos. I saw in a previous review from 2013 that they were poorly executed. I think they must have stepped up their game since then because I've had the vegetal tacos probably five times over the past seven months and have found them delightful each time (the homemade blue corn tortillas are super-tasty). There's also a nice happy hour deal on the tacos on weeknights. I also really like the black bean cake-- it's fried in panko bread crumbs and has a yummy salsa and crema. Like others have mentioned, the guac is really yummy and fresh (although I personally wouldn't pay $7 for it and instead usually snag a little from someone else). The soups change and I really enjoyed a gazpacho I got last fall when it was still tomato season. The vegetable chopped salad is tasty, but the grilled caesar is even better (it might have anchovies in the dressing-- not sure). Something about grilled lettuce is really tasty! All in all, I have always been pretty pleased with what I've gotten at Babalu."], ["s r.", "Great atmosphere, concept and drinks.Have been numerous times and food is always bad.

Similarly, the Queso Blanco appetizer was OK, but the portion was pretty small.2) Tacos were great! I had the combo taco plate for $9 and I selected 3 different types of taco. All were good, particularly the Ostra which was nicely spicy. 3) For dessert, I selected the truffles. EXCELLENT serving of three nicely dense truffles, dusted with powdered sugar and served on top of a small dollop of whipped cream. It was a great way to finish off the meal.4) Several of my friends ordered the Tamarind Margarita and while it was reportedly tasty, at $10, it was probably not worth the price charged.

The ambience, food, and drinks are just fabulous."], ["Scott B.", "Family Tapas second to no other. \u00a0Very tasty fish tacos, steak, burgers, shrimp soup. \u00a0Took four people. \u00a0All enjoyed and want to return. \u00a0Michael was the best waiter I have had in a long time."], ["Augustus A.", "Brought the family to celebrate a new teen. Everyone had great fun with delicious food. Chelsea was friendly and attentive. \u00a0My favorite taco was the oyster taco. Birthday girl enjoyed the Scottish Salmon with the grit cake. Festive atmosphere with fun flavorful food."], ["laura c.", "Farm to table Mexican food that is super yummy! They make the guacamole at your table to your specifications. Killer margaritas!"], ["Brandon T.", "The tapas option is the best! Although they are not extremely large, the flavor and presentation is good. They make the guacamole you order table side and drinks are great. The outside patio is very classy for the Jackson area. Must go!"], ["Rachel D.", "Love the I love Lucy theme! They constantly play reruns from a projector on a wall. Their shrimp and grits are awesome!! \u00a0We ordered the rock of guac and let me tell you.. Best guacamole ever!!! The chips that were served with it hot and were great with the queso dip that we also ordered. Just know that your food will not all come out at once so be prepared. Great service too! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Jackson!"], ["KimAnh P.", "This place has a very nice variety of gourmet food at super reasonable prices. We loved the tacos, which are made with purple corn tortilla, a light sprinkle of feta cheese, light slaw, and meats/fish cooked to perfection. The bacon and lamb barbacoa tacos were superb. You can get full off of one tri order of tacos. Even though it's tapas the portions are very good sized. Next time you're in Jackson and want good modern food eat here!"], ["Richard D.", "Love this place! Been here a few times before but just recently moved to the area, so now it's a regular place of ours. LOVE the menu! \u00a0Perfect for sharing! \u00a0The humus is to die for! Wonderful bartenders and wait staff! We make it on there at least once a week!"], ["Mitch A.", "Babalu has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Jackson. To start, the atmosphere is wonderful. They're always playing \"I Love Lucy\" in black and white silently on the wall via a projector which is a really nice touch. Not to mention the patio, which is a fun and lively atmosphere, as long as the Jackson heat has subsided a bit. The food is delicious. My suggestion is the Baba Burger, which is one of my favorite burgers in town. The regular size is enormous, so opting for the smaller one is better. Best enjoyed with an order of sweet potato fries. They also offer daily specials on tacos, enchiladas, and vegetables. Give it a shot! Babalu is a fun and tasty place to have a meal."], ["Bryan L.", "Such a kick ass place! \u00a0I hate it when I have to come to Jackson, but I love it when I get to go to Babalu. Why can't I quit you, Babalu?!!!I tend to come on taco night. Last time I was in, I ordered 7 tacos, they were all excellent. Hard to find much wrong with any of the tacos. I didn't eat them all, those of you thinking that I must be a world renowned power eater. \u00a0I also tried the Black eyed pea hummus. That was GREAT!!! \u00a0Like Tony the Tiger GREEEEAT!!!!I've also worked my way around the cocktail menu. I think i've had about all of thier menu now. And it's all great. The babarita is the start, and the Mojito finishes me off. There were 5-6 other drinks in between, but who's counting?Can't wait to come back to Babalu!"]]}
