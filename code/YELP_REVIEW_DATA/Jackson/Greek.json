For instance, a while back a little controversy erupted when the owner made some anti-Semitic comments to a local Rabbi. They apparently made up about it and so it is safe to go there again. I was excited, because the food was sloppy delicious the first time I went. My most recent visit involved the owner emerging from the kitchen with a knife and jovially threatening to cut some bits of anatomy from the man working the cash register who cowered in what was probably only mock fear. This sort of banter will probably color your visit too, especially if you come with a group.Price is reasonable. Menu is limited but the quality was not what you can get elsewhere. Wraps is somewhat (or used to be) entertained with another greek restaurant in town, Krilakis, but I am not sure the relationship anymore. You may be better off finding Krilakis (it was in \"downtown\" Ridgeland, last I checked).Quality has definitely declined. The lamb was *ok* but the chicken was tough. Granted they did admit they were scraping the bottom of the barrel on the chicken (end of the lunch time) but still, it was pretty bad.Service was entertaining. While they kept forgetting to bring out fries, the proprietor did come over to regale us with tales of his mother banishing him to Jackson (from NYC) (truly the Rothschilds of dingy Greek diners). He peppered this with a few colorful jokes and free dessert. That Baklava was on point. Probably the best I've had in Jackson. Of course, the unexpectedness, the freeness and the fact that I was almost hand fed it by the owner made it that much better too.However, we go to restaurants to eat primarily and the quality of the food just isn't good enough to make it. Stop by for the experience though!"], ["Duan C.", "Considering the hype behind the Rabbi's experienced at the restaurant - this update is strictly in regards to the service I received from the proprietor.My service wasn't as bad as the Rabbi's - but it wasn't downright welcoming either. I guess I was so excited behind the portions of the food I was not paying that much attention to them, as were they to me either. I'll put it to you like this - when we walked in - I wasn't greeted with an \"Hello, welcome to...........\" When I paid out - I was thanked and that was it. So in regards to the customer service I received, I can honestly say I have received better at other places."], ["Ruhi R.", "Going into the place, it gives off a slightly shady vibe.

Lady at the register didn't have change for a $20 so I had to use a credit card. Most employees were pretty friendly, but it was obvious they were Greek. \u00a0Food was okay. I got a gyro and fries-- fries were good and gyro was a little salty. Sauce was good. The only complaint about food was that it didn't have paper wrapped around it so I felt like I was eating a large taco.

Lots of random pictures and paintings decorate the walls. Girl behind counter was basically it as far as employees.

And the food was good. And it was ready relatively quickly. But my experience was horribly bad, due to the rudeness of the worker behind the counter. She was mean, and angry. She also substantially overcharged us, and acted terribly inconvenienced when she had to issue a refund. I left with a pit in my stomach, the kind that you get after a confrontation with someone, or after you've been bullied. Yes, it was just that bad. If there had been even a hint of a smile, I'd give it 3 or 4. But when I tapped the bell to get her to the front to issue our refund, I saw and heard her yell, \"Jesus!!!\" before she came out. My husband is orthodox Christian, so that made him feel kind of ashamed that an orthodox establishment would have workers that behave that way. The really good food is why I didn't give a 1 rating. :( If mean people don't upset you like they do me, by all means go there. I'll never ever go back. So much negativity! (For reference, our visit was late January 2014, on a Friday night, so no owner seemed to be present.)"], ["Liz C.", "My husband and I are stationed in Meridian and we both had a serious craving for Greek food, gyros in particular. So after reading the amazing reviews for Wraps, we decided to go there. I'm not sure if maybe we just went on a bad day...or have eaten at enough of other good gyro places that we know what a true gyro tastes like and have become a little picky. The bread was covered in butter, making me feel like I was eating a fast food burger. The meat was extremely salty, to the point where I just couldn't eat anymore after 3 bites. Even the feta cheese I got on mine was extremely salty. I couldn't even taste the tzatziki sauce because the salt was so overbearing. There was no taste at all...but salt. I started to pick it apart and eat just lettuce with tzatziki sauce to try and let my mouth take a break from the salt over load...and even then there was no relief! We are pretty healthy eaters so maybe we just aren't used to a salt overload? Either way...we will never eat here again. The fries were not \"fresh cut\" as advertised...they were just like any other fries you can get at any food place. The thing is....the fries had less salt on them than the gyro did! The place had a nice, laid back feel to it. The plastic chairs are actually really comfy! It has a nice \"hole in the wall\" feel that we love. But that's about the only positive thing I can say. With the price of two gyros, fries and drinks at this place we could have gotten a much better meal in a nicer place. Typically the \"hole in the wall\" places have some of the best food I've ever had but this place is an exception to that rule. They have these little quotes all over the walls that I guess employees or guests write and put up, and although some were funny, a lot were not very family friendly. We don't have kids and don't care about it, but if we did have kids, I wouldn't want them reading some of the stuff they have on their walls. So, I guess if you are used to their salty gyros and that's all you know, then that's awesome. But if you've had a truly good gyro before and have a craving for one...don't go here."], ["Baron M.", "As far as the Jackson metro market goes for gyro's, this is as good as I have found. The portions are large, sometimes huge, yet still flavorful. I end up going here about once or twice a month and I always end up with the same thing - the regular gyro. To me, it is good enough that I don't really even feel compelled to try the rest of the menu, though the red snapper (I believe) gyro sounds quite tempting. The fries are generally done right, though sometimes I ask them to make them a little crispy. They come with some sea salt and a nice flavor. The inside is fun, though seating can get a little tight. I wouldn't suggest a group of more than 4. Possibly 5 if you can snag a chair from another table. Some days it can be standing room only, but they are still, generally, quite fast getting your order out. I am marking it as cheap, but it can get pricey, depending on what you get or add (I think feta is $2.50 extra on a gyro that doesn't already have it, dessert is a bit over $4 after tax, etc)."], ["Kristin B.", "This place is awesome.Wraps is a local hole in the wall Mediterranean gyro place with about 6 tables inside and 3 outside. \u00a0You grab your drinks from open coolers located by the door, or the pitcher of iced tea on the main counter.

In fact I was surprised that they even took cards at the register!My brother recommends the veggy wrap - All the regular veggies of a typical gyro, minus the meat, but has fries in it instead. Strangely delicious. I'd recommend the fish gyro though - delicate fish (talapia I think?) seasoned just right and melts when you bite into your gyro. And of course the regular ol' gyro is pretty tasty too - though like Shannon says, the meat is cut kinda chunky.They're \u00a0big too - come hungry.

The salad had two olives, and had thinly sliced soggy tomatoes. And it was saturated in dressing, rather than just drizzled and then tossed to get a good coating.

The one downfall, and this is strictly personal, is that there is SO MUCH FOOD in such a tiny foil package that it's hard to handle the gyro gracefully.

Really, everything I have had is good. The staff is always friendly and the food always comes quickly.

Basically, I found this place via Yelp and it's really good reviews. I went in and ordered the combo that had a Lamb Gyro and a greek salad. The Greek Salad tasted pretty decent and the Lamb Gyro left quite a bit to be desired. The meat tasted almost unseasoned and the sauce they put on it did not have much flavor like I am accustomed to. Also, I asked that they add Feta cheese to the gyro. They charged me $1.50 to do so and put none on there. That really rubbed me the wrong way. I pointed this out to the girl at the front and she got me a small ramekin of it. It was actually some of the strongest feta I had ever tasted. A little too strong actually. Other complaints I had were the fact that there was only 1 other table that had occupants in the place at 7:15 yet the floor was dirty with food and straw wrappers that were on the floor. There is no excuse for that in a slow restaurant. The unsweet tea was also terrible as it tasted like straight up water. They also charged my AMEX for a drink that I never requested as well. The total came to like $16.00. I left very full, but the food was not that great at all. Had the food been priced at about $10.00 I may have felt a little better about it. Sure my company was paying the tab but I spend company money as if it were my own. Another turn off was the place was crawling slow yet my Gyro came out within 1 minute. It was warm which means that everything is precooked and just sitting under a heat lamp or above boiling water or something. Basically it is definitely NOT prepared fresh. Based on my experience, I am giving it 2 stars which is pretty generous. Apparently many folks think they have awesome burgers. The other table that was occupied were eating burgers and they did look pretty good. My advise is to go with one of those because they have to be better than the gyros.

This place is my new go to Greek joint. It's also BYOB which is good for the cost conscious. The gyros are great. I prefer the melted feta from Kiefer's but this is much closer to my house. The parking doesn't result in door dings like the poorly laid out lot at Kiefer's. Also, the bum factor is non-existent at Krilakis. The burger is excellent with great bun but will come after your guests who order gyros. I'd prefer all plates to arrive at the same time, otherwise you watch people eat. They have a gyro combo with fries and soft drink which is very reasonable at around $9 before tip. Speaking of fries... They are worth the trip as well. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with sea salt. My wife doesn't care for their veggie gyro with the fries in it though. Overall worth checking out if you haven't and immensely better than Kristo's which is close to the same area."], ["Mike B.", "My son and I stopped in on the way home from Middle of Nowhere Mississippi to wait out rush hour traffic and to stop the pleas of \"Daddy, I'm hungry\" emanating from the back seat. \u00a0I'd eaten at Krilakis in the past, when it was located in Byrum, so I was confident that it was as good as I remembered. \u00a0While everyone raves about the burgers (and trust me, they are as good as their reputation), I was in the mood for Greek.My son is a huge fan of \"dip\", so I ordered the hummus. And as a cheese lover, I had to order the pita melt. \u00a0Pita bread, mozzarella and feta? Perfection. \u00a0For the entree, we chose the mixed gyro. Given a choice, K would have had just chicken, because that is his default food selection if pizza is not an option. \u00a0The food came out promptly, and the hummus was by far my favorite. It is the perfect consistency, and the seasoning is spot on. Not too salty, with just the right amount of garlicky goodness. \u00a0The gyro came with a mound of hand cut fries, which K promptly dunked in hummus. \u00a0While it is not your typical culinary combination, it seemed to work well for him. In short order, the hummus was decimated, and there was a huge dent in the aforementioned mound of fries. \u00a0The pita melt was hot and cheesy. \u00a0My only complaint is that the feta didn't come through quite as much as I'd hoped. \u00a0Mozzarella is a wonderful cheese, but very bland in comparison, so I'd hoped the feta would provide a little more bite. \u00a0Still, it was good and I would have it again.The gyro was almost an afterthought after making our way through everything else. \u00a0But what a pleasant afterthought. \u00a0The pitas are soft and delicious, and the tzatzki creamy and delicious. \u00a0It's always an added bonus when proportions are done well. \u00a0Often, gyros are drowning in sauce and it becomes a bit of a mess. \u00a0In this case, there was just enough to get the flavor in each bite of the grilled chicken and lamb laden pita. Overall, it was a great meal, and some of the best Greek food I've had in the South. I'm sure there are better places out there, and I know for a fact there are much worse. Two things kept me from giving Krilakis five stars: the lamb and chicken were a little dry for my taste, and the decor was a little lacking.

Don't be bummed though, because Aladdin is nestled right here in the heart of downtown Fondren and it is one of the best dining experiences you can have in town!Let's start with the atmosphere. Walking up to Aladdin's, you'll walk through the front porch sitting area first. If the weather's nice, absolutely grab a seat here! It's such a pleasant place to sit and there are several tables as well as big comfy seating as well. If you choose to sit inside, you'll have your choice between lots of tables as well as some cushy booths as well. It's a small space, but if you've got a group of friends, they're always willing to push some tables together. I've walked in with groups of eight or nine before and had no issue getting seated pretty quickly. The servers are typically really nice. I've been here dozens of times, and I've had maybe one or two dining experiences in which the service was a little lackluster. That's not to say the server wasn't friendly or attentive though! Like I said, they're all usually super nice and the food gets delivered to the tables really quickly.About the food... Omg. So good. This is authentic Mediterranean cuisine, for sure. I love that it stays true to it's Mediterranean/Greek roots while still being a true Jackson, local spot. You can get a sweet tea with your hummus, and you won't be disappointed by either. The homemade falafels are my favorite thing on the menu. The falafel plate is vegetarian and comes with rice and veggies. It's plenty of food for one person and so good! The homemade hummus is reeeeally good and it comes with most dishes. They'll bring you some fresh, warm bread to go with it. YUM. Other excellent dishes: chicken dolmas (served hot!), beef schwarma, gyro, lamb kebab. Everything is so good! And the menu is huge. I could come here every day for a month and not get bored. The desserts are really great too! Get the tiramisu to split with friends. Or get one all for yourself! Oh, and it is super reasonably priced! You can get a gyro for $5. The falafel plate will run you about $9. The most expensive items are the lamb dishes, but even then, nothing goes above $20. NB: This place does NOT serve alcohol, but they do let you brown bag which is so nice! You can grab a bottle of red wine across the street at Fondren Cellars and enjoy it with your meal with some friends.

Most plates comes with rice, hummus, and a side salad. Their meats are always seasoned and cooked perfectly. Now that I've thought about it, I've never had a bad dish here!

The plates arrived timely and were very colorful with a small bowl made of humus containing olive oil. \u00a0The humus was tasty. The Greek salad contained cucumbers, tomatoes, and black olives with a smidgen of tasteless feta and a store bought Italian dressing. Warm pita was provided with the meal. I don't know why but they were cut into strips. I prefer the whole so I can separate the sides and fill it like a pocket. All of this could still make a decent chicken shawarma but the biggest disappointment was the chicken. This was not the stacked, marinated, slow grilled meat you would anticipate but rather pan fried, dry over cooked chopped chicken with a light spice on the outside.

However, this place was open late (until 10 or 11p) and boy, am I glad it was.The location is convenient to access right there on the main strip of the city, adjacent to the government buildings a few blocks down. The decor has your typical, Mediterranean style feel which is always fun, if not in some kitschy way.

I enjoyed a pretty standard dish of lamb gyro meat with rice, Greek-style salad, and hummus + pita bread. Absolutely ate everything- to the last drop.

Since Petra is closed, Aladdin is busier than before. For an appetizer I can recommend the fried Kibby or Spinach Pie. The Kibby has a hard outer shell and filled with ground beef. The Spinach Pie has a soft, fried exterior and filled with spinach and goat cheese. Both come with a dipping sauce, but the thick Lebna sauce (yogurt sauce similar to Tzatziki) for the Spinach Pie is outstanding. You might as well order 2 Spinach Pie's because they are to die for. I would not recommend the Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) as they are too small - the size of cigarillos.For the meal, I've tried the Lamb Kabob Plate, Combination Plate, and roasted leg of lamb. But I think the Gyro Plate tastes better, contains more food, and even is cheaper than the others. The plate is filled with meat, rice, salad and hummus. Pay the extra to upgrade to a Greek salad (with feta and olives) or Tabouli. Nothing has an overpowering taste - the rice, salad and hummus are all mild and delicious. Strangely the Gyro Plate comes with no yogurt sauce, which is a necessity in my book. But ordering extra Lebna was quickly fulfilled - just make sure they don't bring you an entire Lebna appetizer.The tea has a hint of mint which is nice. Make sure to end your meal with a couple of pieces of Baklava."], ["Mallory L.", "We used to go here or get take-out all the time.

The lamb has a mysterious flavor but I do get I believe to be a smoked paprika taste, it was a little spicy but even though I have a mild tolerance could handle it. The basmati rice was light and fluffy and lightly seasoned or flavored with saffron. If I was to criticize anything it would be two things on the lunch plate: the lamb was not drained of grease before it was placed on the hummas so it leached into the rice the second item I would criticize was that I was not asked what dressing for my salad and it arrived with one I will not eat. \u00a0Finally dinner is the house special Big Combo (4 shrimp, 2 lamb chops, and chicken kabob chunks.

Here are the things I tried and my feedback:- Hummus - Very good hummus, doesn't have a strong flavor by itself so it easily pairs with anything else. I got their wheat pita bread and it was fresh and very very good.- Qudsia - Chicken and fava beans on top of hummus, makes the hummus a little more tangible as an appetizer. Had this the second time!- Meat dolmas - These were alright, I wasn't very impressed. I have liked dolmas before when they were seasoned really well but it was bland meat inside bland grape leaves with no flavor to them. Meh.- Spinach pie - VERY yummy. I really liked the filling in this and the pastry was light and really good.- Falafel - AMAZING!! You have to get the falafel here, even if you haven't tried them before. Very flavorful, not greasy, just yummy yummy yummy.- Hummus with lamb - Lamb was very good and tender, came with a small cucumber salad which was pretty good.I added this spicy sauce you can ask for on the side to a lot of what I tried here because their biggest weakness was underseasoning on some dishes that had the potential to be phenomenal. They also didn't have eggplant for baba ganuj which was disappointing.

I believe what I meant is that Keifer's has better Greek food (while \"real\" was not the best word choice as it is definitely Americanized) while this place has better Persian/Turkish, etc. While I still believe Keifer's hummus, gyros, tzatziki and feta dressing slightly edge Aladdin out, the food here has grown on me more and more through the years. They also have good gyros and hummus, but what truly makes the menu is the lamb. Doesn't matter whether you order it in kebab, wrap, chop, or plate form, it's delicious. I usually get the Hummus with Lamb and make sure to ask for labna or tzatziki to go with it (it doesn't come with any yogurt sauce, which I've always thought was strange.) For starters, definitely get the spinach pie and baba ganouj, both are phenomenal. The mint tea is a nice touch and the baklava for desert is better than Keifer's. Overall wonderful Mediterranean food, especially for Jackson, which doesn't always do the best by ethnic food."], ["Justin W.", "Try this place out, you'll definitely enjoy it! \u00a0I met up with some friends there for dinner one night. \u00a0A couple southerners and a couple foreigners, and everybody liked it a lot. \u00a0I would gladly go back if I'm ever in town again. \u00a0It was not busy at all when I went on a Friday night a few days before Christmas."], ["Danna R.", "Best falafel ever! \u00a0Nice atmosphere. \u00a0Another server would have been helpful, our server was great but very busy. \u00a0Everything was very tasty."], ["Roger L.", "Probably the best restaurant in Jackson in terms of food, service, location, atmosphere and value.

We started with the Aladdin Special, a \u00a0sampler platter with hummus, baba ganuj, Lebna, grape leaves, tabouli, falafel and kibby.The hummus was well seasoned, although not a smooth as I would have preferred. The Baba Ganuj was not bad but not memorable either. The Lebna was very good. The grape leaves were a little over cooked but not bad. The kibby was also very good. It was my first time trying it so I don't know what it was supposed to taste like but I liked it. The star of the sampler platter, though, were the falafel! Those were some of the best I have had. Very well seasoned, cooked perfectly.For main courses, my mom had the Lamb Chops and they were perfectly cooked and seasoned! I had the chicken shawarma with a side of hot sauce (can't remember what it was called) but it was VERY spicy and the flavor went well with the chicken. Although the chicken was seasoned well, it was a bit overcooked and somewhat dry.To end it, we tried one of the \"blendies\" drinks made with strawberry on top and avocado?!?! on the bottom. \u00a0It was surprisingly tasty but I would have liked it to be a bit colder as the strawberry section was colder than the avocado. Once I mixed them together, the temperature was more to my preference and I enjoyed it. Overall, a great first experience with Greek food in Jackson. I will definitely be back!"], ["Denise H.", "Very good service. \u00a0Menu had a ton of options- very nice. \u00a0I had the vegetarian plate. \u00a0Falafel was cooked to perfection.

I eat mediterranean food often in Atlanta, where we have Israeli, Lebanese, and Palestinian varieties to choose from. \u00a0Aladdin presents a large menu with many nice touches such as haloumi (they call it \"fried cheese\") and mint-infused tea. I ordered the vegetarian plate (hummus, baba ganouj, and tabouleh). \u00a0My companion had chicken kabobs. \u00a0All the food was fresh and delicious, and was served promptly. The haloumi was sliced a bit thicker than is customary and did not have the traditional slight crustiness on the outside, but it was still delightfully \"squeaky\" and came with a nice garnish of tomato and cucumber slices.The reason for no fifth star is that the restaurant is \"bring your own bottle\" but this fact is not advertised on their website. It would not have deterred us from going if we had known, but was nonetheless disappointing when we arrived to not be able to have a beer or some wine. The second reason is that the waiter didn't seem to be too familiar with the menu - he would have been of no help to someone who was not already familiar with middle eastern food. \u00a0However, if you're looking for solid mediterranean fare in Jackson, you will be happy with Aladdin!"], ["Kashif A.", "Lamb chops!

I love that you can BYOB for no cork fee... have a nice dinner with wine (there's a liquor store literally next door) on the cheap! My only complaint is that once, I ordered that same vegetable dish I always order and it came without the cheese (my favorite part). I asked about it and was told they were out. I was annoyed, because the dish was really bland without it, and they hadn't even told me. I think they took off 50 cents? Gee, thanks. And the staff were clearly talking about me and all staring in my direction and it was just awkward. But next time I came in the same waitress joked with me, \"We have the cheese!\" so whatever...

I usually get Musabaha for an appetizer. It's hummus with whole chickpeas stirred in with their olive oil relish on top. I have literally cleaned out a plate of hummus with their fresh pita bread. They offer either wheat or white pita. I get the white, the texture is better to me, but for die hard wheat fans, the wheat is good. I have had their lentil soup, and most of the time, I've had it, it's been good, flavorful, and comforting. I get the combination plate of chicken kabob, schwarma, and gyro meat. I love the gyro meat, it's soft and spicy a grilled so nicely, and you can eat it with the hummus that comes with your meal. The chicken and beef are marinated in something amazing and grilled. Usually my chicken is juicy and tender and my beef is falvorful. The hummus is very creamy and I wish I could figure out how to get the creamy consistency of Aladdin's hummus at home. The meal comes with a salad with a homemade italian dressing. I usually get an extra side of dressing to dip my meat it, because it is fantastic! I think I could literally drink a cup of their dressing. It's that good. \u00a0I haven't eaten the salads there, but I've seen them, and they look beautiful. I have had the gyro and it's delicious. I have also had the falafel and while I like it very much, Keifer's wins on the falafel, hands down. I usually have great service when I go to Aladdin's. If I could I would eat Aladdin's weekly, that's how much I enjoy it. Portion sizes are reasonable and so is the price of the food. You can also go next door and buy a bottle of wine and bring it in to drink. Fabulous... Again... my favorite place to eat in the city.

Overall, it was a good experience. We ate in. The chicken pita, gyros and falafel were good. The fried potatoes were not. Prices are a bit high for the overall quality."], ["F M.", "Love Them!!!! They give generous amounts of meat!!! Love their Feta sauce too!!!! I'm hungry. Please deliver!!!"]], "Greek Parthenon": [["Remy O.", "Here is another of my favorite spots to hit in the Jackson area. \u00a0Aside from Pho, I love hummus. \u00a0And at Greek Parthenon the hummus (**** stars) is off the chain. \u00a0I also enjoy that they have a Mediterranean store which offers tahini and other delights for you to take home and cook yourself.You will find the owner walking around and he is very approachable and full of dining suggestions. \u00a0I recommend the grilled fish of the day (**** stars) \u00a0and dont forget to grab a snack on your way home from their bakery."]], "Vasilios Greek Cuisine": [["Merritt L.", "Had redfish with scallops. The redfish is much better and much more fresh than seafood r'evolution's. Fresh fish delivered daily. Vasilio's is a lot like Bill's Greek Tavern in Jackson, except a little more consistent. It is a classic and casual institution of Madison. Serving staff is very amicable and personable. The perfect place for a low key, private, \"neighborhood\" atmosphere. Especially for a mid-week dinner after a long day of work."], ["Terri H.", "I don't think I ever have eaten at the same place twice on the same day . Vasilio ' s is the exception. We stopped for a quick lunch I had a gyro lunch special the gyro was fantastic and the fries were had cut from a real potato. .my friend wasn't very hungry and had the Humus appetizer said it was the best she ever had.. so we made plans to have dinner there that night.. I had the black fish , she had the redfish \u00a0both we cooked to perfection..my blackish had a lemon butter sauce that yummy. We had calamari and pita with feta for appetizers \u00a0that were delicious. .and split \u00a0a baklava that was sinfully \u00a0delicious. .. it is our new favorite \u00a0place"], ["Jerry S.", "I don't know what the others are talking about, we are Greek and were traveling to New Orleans and randomly found this amazing place. \u00a0Everything was delicious! The spanakopita, the redfin seafood platter, veggies with feta, keftethes (meatballs)... What a treat! And everyone was very nice. The atmosphere was perfect, lots of flair of Greece, music and paintings. \u00a0That's our new favorite spot on the drive down to New Orleans now!"], ["Matt M.", "Never again! Food is not fresh, it's the nastiest food I have had since moving here. The place is a joke. The staff can not take the order correctly. The chicken in my gyro was paper thin. Frozen chicken strips ! I can cook better than this geeezzzz. Sad just plain disgusting !!!!"], ["Mary D.", "We went here with the kids for dinner. \u00a0Excellent redfish, grilled feta, superb \u00a0spanikopita, great pita and hummus and the best dessert ever: baklava cheesecake . \u00a0Great restaurant. \u00a0Not cheap but worth it."], ["Jessica S.", "Will not be coming back here. Food is not authentic and is the worst Greek food that I have ever had. Food is also over priced. Greek salad is nothing but shredded lettuce with meat over it, had no feta, no Greek olives, and no tomatoes."], ["Harry P.", "As a Greek American, I would stay away. \u00a0a gyro Greek salad which my mother would laugh at the owner. If the owner is Greek, you should be ashamed to call this Greek food because I am embarrassed. \"NA\""], ["Stephen W.", "Wonderful redfish. Perfect example of a quality Greek restaurant. \u00a0So authentic that it closes for a month each summer so the owners can visit Greece."]], "Kristos": [["Dustin C.", "AWESOME FOOD!!! Every Time I go in janelle knows my order and is always smiling!! She cares so much every time!! \u00a0My order is sometimes not correct but the customer service is so awesome I don't even care! Bradley at the front desk might take some skills from janelle on customer service and learn to not tell a guest NO!! Other then that I will keep going 3-4 times a week!!"], ["Matt H.", "I've dined at Kristos several times now both at lunch and dinner. One thing to remember is that, as the sign says, this is AmeriGreek, not traditional Greek food. There are many Americanized Greek items (or is it Greekized American items?) on the menu that would make it a good restaurant for those who aren't sure about eating Greek food. You can get a traditional Lamb Gyro with Tzatziki sauce and find it plentiful and tasty. They also have things like a Ham & Cheese Gyro, which clearly isn't traditional Greek fare! You can also get Redfish, Catfish Tacos, Shrimp Po-Boy, or a Cheeseburger here. There's something for everyone. I've had the Gyro, the Catfish Tacos, the Greek Quesadilla (love this one). They were all great, had good portion sizes, and are reasonably priced for Madison.The atmosphere is interesting. It is an old remodeled house. Some of the tables are pretty close together, but it doesn't seem to crowded. The also have an outdoor patio with a TV that is a GREAT place to dine when the weather is good.The service has improved since the new owners started changing things. The last several times I've been the waitresses have been great."], ["Allen T.", "Good food. The service can sometimes be a little slow. But the food is really good. \u00a0Friendly staff. Good gyros."], ["Jerry S.", "We found this place randomly while following directions to a different Greek restaurant, haha... The building looked so nice and it said Greek Cuisine on the sign so we had to try it! \u00a0Turns out, it's not traditional--mostly your basic pub fare with a Greek twist... I had the red snapper which was a little small and just mediocre, but the feta plate was a nice piece of Greek feta which was great! All in all, the young staff were nice and responsive and I think if I hadn't walked in craving a traditional Greek meal I'd have loved it!"], ["Jenna W.", "The food was really good but the service was terrible!The server took our drink orders and returned 5 minutes later to ask us again what we wanted to drink because she \"got stopped three times!\"I had to ask twice to have my drink refilled (the only time I got a refill was when I asked for it, it was never offered)We had to search for someone to get a to go box ans our check when it became apparent they wouldn't be returning to our table. Our server was actually hanging out at the bar chatting with someone."], ["Rebecca B.", "A few months ago, we had written Kristos off as a viable takeout option. I'm pleased to say that 2 more recent trips have shown a real turn around in service. Quicker and far more pleasant people are manning the front of the restaurant now - it no longer feels like I've imposed upon the employees' good times by going there. Had to update the review - still a little pricey but back in the rotation."], ["Ross C.", "I don't understand how this place isn't given 5 stars by everyone. The staff, the presentations, prices, and the food were amazing!"], ["Jared D.", "My wife, daughter, father-in-law, and myself have eaten there twice in the last week. The food is great, the people are friendly, and not as expensive as it probably should be. We will be back every chance we get."], ["Beth M.", "One word..no...Most awfully set up and serviced restaurant ever...I've experienced better run lemonade stands."], ["Katie A.", "The mozzarella pita appetizer is really good. \u00a0It has a very tasty side sauce. The gyros are amazing. The lamb was cooked just right. \u00a0The baklava is pretty good as well. Kristos is definitely a place we will return to."], ["Coral E.", "We are fairly regular visitors to Kristos. \u00a0While the sweet potato fries are good, the curley fries are our favorite. \u00a0Always had good food and our go-to pitas are the shrimp, the club and the turkey. \u00a0The outdoor patio is always nice to sit at- especially when there's a football or baseball game on and the service is always good."], ["Caroline B.", "The food is sub-par and a bit overpriced. They do have a nice patio and staff but if you want really good Greek food you'd be much better off somewhere else."], ["Brian H.", "The service was friendly and my girlfriend seemed to enjoy her quesadilla, however that's the only positive things I have to say. The menu was juvenile compared to other Greek restaurants. The fajita wrap I got was incredibly dry and bland. They really need to rethink their menu if they want to compete with the other Greek places."], ["Chad S.", "I'm going with A-Ok here because Kiefers is downtown and Kristos is trying to fill the Madison Keifer's void. Pitas are smaller than Keifers and soda/tea are $2.25. Service was good and the paito was great. We didn't try the appetizers but maybe next time. For Gyro action, you might want to dine at Keifers. As my wife said, \"dainty portions\"."], ["Baron M.", "Price ended up being a little higher than I expected (drink prices I think), but the quality of the food was good. The Greek meatball gyro was tasty, the fries were much too soggy. Next time, I'm going to ask them to cook them crispy (maybe this is a Greek thing? I have to ask Wraps, Keifers, and Krilakis to crisp them up, but not Kiefers downtown...). Also, two people could easily split the fries. They were so soggy, I had to knock off a star. We had two orders at the table and they were both the same way. It was a shame too because they had soooo much potential (thin, curly fries with Greek seasoning). Anyway, I will certainly go back next time I am in the area for lunch. Maybe they can get that forth star!"], ["Tam D.", "We visited this place on a suggestion. \u00a0I ordered the Greek burger with sweet potato fries. \u00a0The burger was tasty and fresh, the fries were waffle and large enough for 2 to share. \u00a0It was $10, not a bad deal for dinner. \u00a0My dining companion ordered the chicken gyro but commented that it wasn't great. \u00a0The service was attentive and accommodating. \u00a04 stars for being out of all draft beers at the time! Will give them another shot."], ["Donald S.", "Average food, immature service.My experience. \u00a0Quality of the food: Gyro was average, falafel was average, and pita with feta was good. \u00a0The portion size was small. \u00a0The wait time after our order was placed was very long. \u00a0Service was inflexible to the simplest of request. \u00a0Overall a poor value. \u00a0I won't be back."], ["Michael H.", "Overpriced and was not as good as I was expecting"], ["W E.", "I love this place during lunch. \u00a0I like the pita-moz to start with then I get either the first wrap on the menu or the second one. \u00a0One is a standard gyro the other is a greek meatball gyro. \u00a0I enjoy everytime I go to this place. \u00a0Great food. \u00a0Has a very nice outdoor area."]]}
