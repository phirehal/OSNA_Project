We each ordered a roll (Fusion Po-Boy, and the Yum-yum Roll) then a side of broccoli, fried Rice with chicken, and a bowl of Tempura Udon soup to share. The Po-Boy roll was good, it is served hot, and it tasted much better later when we finished it later on and it was cold. As the flavors blended a little smoother. \u00a0The Yum-yum Roll was exceptional and was the first and only thing we ordered that was finished at the table.

I love Downtown, though the roadwork they've been doing lately makes accessing Wasabi a bit more difficult. As far as the menu, this is your standard sushi restaurant. They've got your basics as well as some specialty rolls. They also offer hibachi and cooked dishes, though I've never given those a shot since I'm pretty much obsessed with sushi. The sushi here is pretty good. It's nothing mind-blowing, but it's definitely good. The drink menu is pretty solid. They've got some great cocktails and a small but decent beer selection. The service is usually pretty slow and the waitstaff always seems a bit understaffed. It's not the most pleasant environment, though it is usually pretty empty and quiet if you're looking for that. The patio is a really nice place to sit on a warm, breezy day so if you want to eat sushi in the shade, I highly suggest Wasabi. Other than that, I usually head elsewhere if I'm craving sushi. Like I said though, I love the location of Wasabi so I'll keep going back occasionally."], ["Cherry D.", "Pretty good, solid place. The shrimp siomai was my favorite. Also ordered the downtown roll, seaweed salad, their version of honey walnut shrimp. The shrimp had too much batter for me and it could have used more sauce.

I immediately called back asking about my order and was told it was sitting on the counter (no apology issued). I asked if they could deliver me the forgotten items and was met with a rude lecture about how they are understaffed and take-out means coming to pick it up. Leaving my meal to get cold at the hotel, I begrudgingly walked back and again, was met with no real apology or offering for a partial refund.

The Hibachi menu was very expensive than the rest I guess because the chef is putting on a show. Our waitress was this ok blond haired girl who seemed polite and throwing huge flirtation to my brother. This other family of a mum and 10 year old girl came in to sit at our booth with us. Everybody ordered meat except for me. I ordered the Vegetarian plate (and I'm not even Vegan or Vegetarian, I was just craving steamed zucchini). It took about 29 mins before our chef came out. The salad was good, but it giggles me that they add the dressing without asking. The miso soup was unpleasant to my taste; the fish broth was too salty. Our chef wasn't Asian nor Japanese, he was Black and that's not a big deal at all. When he came to our table he only acknowledged the 10 yr old girl first and not even my brother even though he was turning 22 he should've been greeted. He got started making all kinds of noises and flipping the fried rice. Burned the eggs a couple of times. When he was done the fried rice was too salty for my taste. Soy sauce and salt/pepper don't mix too well. Next, he started on the meat after he got done flipping and cooking the meat he handed it out to everyone by first to last. But when it came to my vegetables he didn't place them on my plate first before giving it out to everyone else he skipped me. That was so unprofessional! That made me so angry! The waitress handed out warm towels, so we could wipe our hands. When I got done the towel, it was sitting under my arm next to my plate. When she came to get my towel, I was eating. While I was eating she reached over my plate without saying excuse me and took the towel. That was so so very rude!!! No manners whatsoever! When everyone got done eating their meals, the waitress brought the little girl a cake THEN asked my brother did he want one. Of course, he does! It is his birthday too!!! She said she was going to bring him a cake she left and didn't came back. It was 20 mins before she came back with his cake even though we were the first ones there! Overall terrible service, ok food because of the veggies, but too pricey! I will not be back! Should've just went to the Cock on the Walk!

Poor guy), and although it wasn't as great as it was the first time, I know he was tired and it was still good.We had a reservation at 9pm and although construction is crazy downtown, we made it there at 8:55pm. We were told there would be about a 20 minute wait because although the previous party had finished, they were still holding up the tables. No problem....we waited. At about 9:30pm, the hostess comes back and tells us that they have yet to leave. Now, I had just gotten in town off of a 6 hour drive and was STARVING. I asked how much longer it would be and if I could have a glass of water. She brought the water back and said she would go check on the table. She returned close to 10pm!When she came back, she told us that they were leaving shortly but if we wanted to sit on the end of their table we could and they'd clear us off two spots. Before we could answer (we'd resolved to skip hibachi and order from the menu) she was gone! She returned to seat us at 10:30pm. Now, I'm skipping a lot but the waitstaff was awful this entire time. I heard a lot of complaining, cursing, etc. but we won't get into all of that.We were seated and we still waited for quite a while as Chef Drew was starting another table!! I wanted to leave and would have been fine with Taco Bell at this point, but my boyfriend already felt bad enough. The other people at our table told us that they had been waiting 20-30 minutes for sushi and one of the gentlemen reordered it....it came right out meaning it had been sitting somewhere that entire time. Well, at least I'd get soup and sald to appease my stomach......NO! We didnt get that. Instead we got a story about how our waiter needed his smoke break before he went crazy.At 11pm or so, Chef Drew came over to find that no one turned the table on so we waited while it heated up. To wrap this up, he gave a great show and the food was good but not great. All in all, we STILL were given an $85 ticket with nothing taken off for the wait, lack of appetizers, or sketchy service.....and my sweet bf paid it without hesitation.

The rolls we had weren't too expensive, but there are some more luxurious options if you're in the mood (the Filet Mignon roll comes to mind).

I came here with a couple of friends to check this place out. This place was in a nicer area in Flowood with blocks and blocks of shops. Basically, if you wanted to get shopping done, this is the place to be. So the location was convenient.. although it was a ways from school. The place i remember was cheap (compared to prices in CA) i think for dinner it was only $18.. of course for MS prices this is pretty steep (OMG their $5 KFC buffet, but i digress). They had a variety of chinese and japanese food.. along with the MS staple; crawfish and catfish and oysters fried battered or raw. But I didn't come here for all that, i came here for the sashimi and sushi and I was amazed. The salmon was extra fatty and delicious. Although you have to kind of pester the sushi chefs into cutting up pieces for you. I had to let the chef know 3 times that I was waiting on salmon and he must've cut up maybe 4 slices. I had to keep going back and asking for more which was a big ass pain but other than that, the quality of the fish was superb. There was great marbling in the fish with lots of fish oil drizzling down the sushi. They also had raw oysters which I absolutely love. But yeah yadda yadda the food is good... but The best part of this buffet hands down is the ice cream. BLUE BELL BIRTHDAY CAKE ICE CREAM!!!!!!!! OMG where the hell have you been all my life?! Ever since I ate that I been searching far and wide at every Krogers I could to find it but I was never able to see it again... now that im back in CA, i'll never be able to eat you again.. how i long for you... *sniff sniff*I've been here quite a few times and i absolutely love it. It's a little part of CA that I'm able to experience.. and the ice cream! holy bananas on a stick that is ah-may-jing!

In pretty much any city, 5-15 bucks PER ROLL is normal. Say you want 2 rolls and some sashimi and miso soup. Easily a 30 dollar meal. Easily.

I have been here a good 20-30 times. I LOVE it. Every time I visit Jackson, my friends know that we are going here for lunch one day. $11 for all the fresh sushi, sashimi, seaweed salad, miso soup you could possibly eat. There is one roll that has peanut butter that I don't like. But hey, it's a buffet, so I can try them all and see what is my fave and then eat until full without adding the bill in my head, justifying an expensive lunch by taking away drinks at the bar that weekend. Oh yeah, they have good Chinese too, but what can I say I rarely touch it - there is sushi on the other end! Their salmon sashimi is probably my fave, and it has been fresh every time I've gone. They even have an ice cream station. And ice cream happens to be one of my favorite desserts. But I hardly ever get it here. Yup, I am that typical gluttonous buffet goer at this place.

At around $20 per person for the dinner price, Ichiban is also an incredible value. My wife is NOT a raw fish kind of gal, however. The reason for the lack of four or five stars is that $20 per person for basic Chinese-American fare is a little steep (especially for those people who don't actually crave wasabi. Which I do.) The other-than-sushi buffet is incredibly extensive, though, and you're bound to find something you like.

Sorry so critical, but I love Fondren, and I would love to see a better business in place of this one."], ["Rachel P.", "After weeks of waiting, I finally had a chance to grab lunch here and I was DEFINITELY not disappointed! Located centrally in Downtown Fondren, Surin of Thailand is an easy and safe walk to lots of other popular spots-- like the Apothecary, Fondren Public, Fondren Cellars, etc. It's a great place to go for lunch if you want to explore Fondren a bit, or a great place to start your big night out on the town! If you ever had a chance to eat at Nick's, which is the restaurant that occupied the space Surin is now in (and I miss it all the time. they had the BEST brunch. oh, man. okay... back to my Surin review), the atmosphere is similar. At lunch, it's definitely casual. There were folks in everything from businesswear to shorts and tshirts. At dinner, though, it's probably a bit classier. The restaurant is spacious. There is a sheltered patio that faces Old Canton Road that you can sit on, or there is tons of seating inside the restaurant. In the front, there's a bar with a lot of seating and in the back part of the restaurant is the sushi bar as well as many more tables and booths. There are lots of seating options if you come with a large group, as well. (Though, definitely make a reservation.)Onto the food-- our meal started off with the coconut soup they serve before every entree. I really enjoyed it, but it was definitely very heavy on the coconut. I'm a huge coconut fan, but my friend that I went with wasn't and he wasn't too fond of the soup. It's probably hit or miss for most folks. Luckily for my friend, our entrees came out very quickly after the soup was served. I ordered the thai noodles with chicken and shrimp and it was super flavorful and well-executed. With lots of veggies, spices and peanut, it was everything I was looking for a in a thai dish. The portion was HUGE, but I was really, really hungry so... I took care of it. My friend got the masaman chicken and I had a few bites and it was also excellent. The curry sauce, especially, had an incredible flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of tenderness to it. This place would have gotten five-stars no questions asked, but unfortunately, the service left a lot to be desired. Upon arriving, we waited four-five minutes for a hostess to seat us and once seated, waited another four-five minutes before anyone welcomed us or asked for our drink order. Throughout the meal, our waiter seemed bored and distracted, and rarely made eye contact with us while taking our order and rarely checked in to make sure everything was okay. I try to be really forgiving and understanding with servers (I waited tables for six years, so I *get* it), but he was just quite unfriendly. The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded, especially considering we were there during peak business lunch hours and I was a bit disappointed in this aspect of the dining experience.

Service is not the most prompt, but we did come here during mid-afternoon with only one server working with 7 tables to serve.The menu is divided into a Japanese section and a Thai section. Basing on all of the other tables around me, seems like the Thai menu is more of the popular choice. We ordered a Pad Thai and a Red Curry dish. The noodles are sweeter and not as sour as the authentic dish, but I have to admit they are not shy on the sprinkling of peanuts on top (I liked that). The curry was also a little disappointing, it did not have lemongrass to help with the flavours. If you want extra rice, be prepared to be charged for it.Definitely not the true authentic experience, but will settle my stomach of Thai cravings until I get home. More cons: the owners and employees are not Thai so may be the excuse for non-authentic taste, they charge for hot tea, an employee parks near the entrance (leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since I've worked in customer service for years)"], ["Baron M.", "I stopped here to grab some takeout one evening when I was looking for something a bit different.

To start, I'll review one of the places I used to love going to.Sakura Bana (formally Little Tokyo) has always been a great spot for sushi. If you are trying to find hibachi/teppanyaki, then you will need to head over to Little Tokyo II on County Line Rd. This place here has their sights set on sushi!Now on to the food. For years, the sushi here has been consistent. They are not stingy with their slices of fish, the sushi rice is seasoned nicely, and the rolls always taste fresh. I am a bit of a purist when it comes to sushi, so I can't speak for any fried, saucy, or super modern rolls. My favorite item here is the salmon box sushi. I have been eating sushi in Atlanta for some time and I have yet to find a sushi roll that is quite as appealing. It has a great balance of salmon, avocado, and lemon. A must try if you are a fan of those ingredients. You also can't go wrong with your standard nigiri.Based on my somewhat fleeting memories, I never had any issues with service. So, all in all, this is a great place to stop by if you are in the mood for nice, clean sushi."], ["Melissa M.", "We have been Little Tokyo/Sakura Bana customers for years. \u00a0 They have some great sushi and dinners.Tonight we ordered take out and were told to come in 30 minutes. \u00a0 Got there in 30, waited another 30 even though the restaurant only had about 8 tables. \u00a0 \u00a0The food is good, but we are not impressed with the take out service. \u00a0It used to be pretty good but there were 5 of us waiting over an hour for our orders tonight. \u00a0 \u00a0Just be aware."], ["Ryan B.", "I was very surprised how authentic the Japanese cuisine was at this clean, medium-sized restaurant. \u00a0The dishes were very fresh and tasty.Easy to find, this place will impress due to great wait service and a good-sized menu. \u00a0I can verify that the tempura vegetables, sushi rolls, udon noodles, and shrimp dishes are way yummy."], ["Stan A.", "Working in Jackson for 3 weeks and was tired of hanging at the hotel. Been on a diet (sort of) so have been eating lots of sandwiches in my room. Was searching YELP for something good to eat. Found some positive reviews on this site and decided to give it a try. Also, wanted to avoid the usual chain restaurants. Found the place rather easily. A small, but busy place. Very nice interior. I was seated quickly. My waitress took my drink order and I set about the task of reading the menu for something tasty.I am used to sushi joints having written descriptions of the ingredients of their rolls, this place had none. Just names of rolls on the menu, no clue as to what was in them. I asked the waitress about menu descriptions, she offered some photos. Not helpful! I settled on a tuna sashimi appetizer. (Not as good as the one I order at Taste of Tokyo in Destrehan, La), but not bad. My \"Rainbow Roll\" arrived, stuffed full of cucumber. I HATE CUCUMBER! I had specifically asked the waitress if there were crunchy veggies in this roll, no mention of it. Not a fan of crunchy veggies. I told the waitress about this when she refilled my drink. Her response, \"oh yeah, forgot about that one\" and walked away. Not the reaction I hoped for. Instead of fighting with her, I picked at the dish and ate the tuna, salmon, and crab. Disappointing meal. Might give this place another chance. Jackson is severely lacking in quality restaurants. Guess I will be making sandwiches for several weeks."], ["Niki L.", "OK so I'm a little obsessed.... My whole experience at Sakura Bana was ruined because of a phone call I had made 4 hours prior to arriving... I called in at about 3pm to check about what their prices were and what menu items they had different from their sister restaurant Little Tokyo (2)... A man answered the phone and I told him why I was calling... I told him I was trying to decide between the two restaurants and he told me that Sakura Bana was better and cheaper. I asked the man if they had Chawan-mushi or dobin-mushi... Actually I asked him a couple of times. \"Are you sure you have chawan-mushi?\" \"Oh yes, we have chawan-mushi\" \"Really, are you sure you have it?\" \"We have Chawan-mushi\".... Fast forward 4 hours... At the restaurant... I have my niece with me who's never in town and has never had chawan-mushi. I was all excited for bringing her to one of the only sushi bars I've been to in the south so far that has it... I order it and- \"Oh no, we don't have chawan-mushi\". \"Sure you do... Chawan-mushi.\" I say like the Japanese waitress doesn't understand what's coming out of my mouth... \"You know, the soup custard, Chawan-mushi?\" \"No, sorry, we don't have chawan-mushi. Little Tokyo does\" I sit there for a moment getting even more upset. I told the lady I drove all the way over there just because someone told me that they had chawan-mushi there. She told me it wasn't them I called, it was Little Tokyo. I pulled out my phone as evidence. \"That's not your phone number?\" I say to to the lady as she squints to try to make out the tiny little digits on the screen. Anyway to make our confrontation short she finally admitted that I called them but the guy didn't understand what I said... Not that he told me that they had it so I would come to their restaurant instead of the other... I didn't throw a fit but I'm sure the woman next to me was thinking \"What the hell is this bitch's problem, freaking out, making a scene because she can't get some mushy thing here...\" We decided to stay because I was really hungry. We ate. I was stewing in my own frustration. I couldn't enjoy anything because I was still mad. The food was better than many sushi bars I've found around here. They had exceptional sashimi and chirashi. The hamachi-kama was possibly the best I've had. The service was also pretty good. The only bad thing I have to say (besides the chawan-mushi incident) is that they didn't really have a broad range of rolls -or- didn't have other appetizers I would have expected such as green mussels (which I am also equally obsessed with). However, this is pretty much a traditional SUSHI bar (and they are actually Japanese here). It is what you would expect. Ugh. Just go and eat there. It's good. They would have gotten another star if I wasn't so bitchy so just do it. You'll probably really like it.

There are a number of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better \"special\" rolls and really show a flair for creative cuisine, but Nagoya is consistently better on all the \"staples\" of sushi (Americanized sushi I suppose).

Did some quick research on YELP and decided to give Nagoya a try.The prices were VERY reasonable and the service was quite attentive. The decor could use some improvement but I guess it justifies lower prices.I had wanted to start with Hamachi Kama but the waiter misunderstood and brought me an order of Hamachi instead. I thought about sending it back (especially since I had already ordered hamachi sashimi) but it looked darn good so I decided to devour it. \u00a0It was nice and buttery and seemed very fresh.In addition to the hamachi sushi, I sampled:-- Amaebi (The body was very fresh and the heads were fried perfectly. \u00a0It was served with ponzu sauce.)-- Salmon/Hamachi sashimi (4 pieces of each) were generously cut and definitely fresh-- Unagi and Ikura were okay. Ikura seemed a bit bland (not salty enough) and unagi was typical.-- The hamachi kama (I eventually did order it) was bit too salty and the could have been grilled better (the skin was too burnt but the meat part didn't taste smokey enough). They must have grilled it too quickly over fire that was too hot.Overall, it was a pleasant surprise to find a decent sushi joint in Jackson, MS. The total damage (including tea, tax, and tip) came to be $47.77; even better when you get to charge it on Corporate AMEX. \u00a0Now my tummy is full and happy.

When he got to the chicken he did the same...chili paste, a touch of pink sauce, the usual spices & sauces all writhing & bubbling.

The last couple of times I've been, the service was slow although the dining room was only at quarter capacity and the food was reminiscent of left overs.I got fried rice with my lunch and it was super greasy and stale. The server said they brought me rice that had been made earlier that morning ( I doubt it) and left in a rice cooker. I went at lunch right at opening, even if they had made the rice just before lunch, it shouldn't have tasted like it spent the night in my fridge and a minute in the microwave. Additionally they make fresh hibachi fried rice all day long, why can't they take the time to do the same for me on the sushi side? It was inexcusable. On top of that our server was a smart a$$. I asked to sub only cucumber salad instead of the cucumber squid combo in my lunch and he said he can't swap sushi and cooked. Really? They are mutually exclusive? I had no idea the limitations of a stove top chef excused him from being able to cut cucumbers and squeeze Japanese mayo on them. There is no practical reason why that couldn't happen. My brother was trying sushi for the first time and I'm embarrassed I didn't have the best this place has to offer. The sushi was under sauced and this last time our Tornado roll (wrapped in potatoes and deep fried) was burnt. The BBQ squid was overdone and too chewy, service was still slow and I had to yell \"hey\" to get the attention of my waitress (again only 4 tables and 2 servers this should not be an issue). I guess what I'm trying to say is, when it comes to the best sushi in town, this is not the place. Crazy Ninja can offer you better service and food. If you want a unique sushi roll like uni or rainbow trout, it's worth the occasional drop by, but don't expect the best service or food outside of that.

Of course, there are also sushi pieces as well for the ones who would prefer something not in roll form. There are also other menu items for everyone else.The Okinawa roll is possibly their most popular item on the menu. It is arranged quite prettily on the plate. Our favourite was the Tornado roll. It was just a standard roll, but wrapped in potato string, then deep fried, then drizzled with a sweet sauce, and sprinkles with sesame seeds. Oh my, it was so good.There were other rolls as well we did not try, such as the Jazzy roll, New Orleans roll, Red Dragon roll, and the Great Lady roll, as well many others.The only thing we did not enjoy was the yakisoba from all that was ordered. The noodles were not soba noodles, but were the same noodles that are in instant ramen packs. The noodles were cooked too long, so it was too soft, and breaks every time we picked it up with our chopsticks. Unfortunately, this is what brought the 5 stars down to 4.The decor is not pretentious, but clean. The restaurant is a bit dark though, nice ambience for a dinner date, maybe?

The sushi menu covers classics that you will find elsewhere to creative rolls that you might not. The rolls are all flavorful and not too dependent on sauces (nor soaked too deeply in them). I have not ventured too far away from just ordering the rolls, they are so good. To finish your meal off, they often bring by a pre-sliced orange. I don't know how, but it is always one of the sweetest oranges I have ever had.For lunch, they do a two or a three roll special that arrives fairly quickly. Definitely worth the stop in to satisfy a craving!One thing to take note of, prices on the sushi menus are not consistent. They have the paper menu that you make your selection on, a full menu, and a sheet explaining some basic rolls - these all have different prices on them.

My bag weighed at least five pounds when I left there!As for taste: I got the shrimp lo-mein and Mikado has the tastiest noodles and the shrimp actually tasted like shrimp. I grew up on the gulf coast and though it didn't have that \"Gulf\" flavor I love, it was very tasty and the texture was pleasing. I do have to mention the rice that came with the meal. It wasn't very flavorful, or maybe not AS flavorful as the noodles themselves. I loved that it came with bits of scrambled eggs, that's something I enjoy in my hibachi rice. While it tasted like regular white rice with a beef broth flavor, it wasn't off-putting and was still delicious.Overall, I was highly satisfied with the pleasant atmosphere and prompt and accommodating service.

I have NEVER had this policy enforced (or explained anywhere in the restaurant) with a similar sized group in the past. We opted to pay for our drinks (those of us that even got a single glass) and leave at this point. The man at the register was confused on why were were leaving and only had drink tickets to pay, so he seemed to have missed on how long we'd waited without getting to order. The waitress laughed as we cashed out though, the final nail in my group's decision to never return.I will also point out that the table beside us, with three less occupants, did not have this enforced, got their orders taken, and ate before our waitress came back. Perhaps it was a poor decision on our part to let this go on as long as it did before we left.Seeing past reviews, it's happened to others before.I'd leave one star, but they get two for good service in the past.The other place we ate at afterwards gets five stars for prompt, polite service and delicious food."], ["Gary J.", "You are better off with Sushi from a gas-station.Your iPhone's GPS will guide you to a nondescript \"Sushi Village,\" sign on the front of a rather modern shopping center. \u00a0 This may be an ominously accurate name. \u00a0Many of your local sushi joints attempt to evoke feelings and a tone of decadence with nouns such as \"palace.\" \u00a0They inevitably have the gaudy signs and artificial looking side paneling. \u00a0(Author's question: do those banker pricks who finance these expansions go to the place and snicker at the larger-than-life decorations?) \u00a0(Author's answer to his own question: Probably not in view of how these literal and figurative fat cats will finance anything as quick as they will snatch up that last crab claw). \u00a0\"Sushi Village\" is just that. \u00a0It is a mere war-torn and vanquished village--or more historically appropriate--a refugee camp. \u00a0This is especially true in view of its competitors' ostentatious names such as, \u00a0\"Sushi palace, \" \"Sushi Chef,\" \"Sushi Planes,\" \"Sushi Trains,\" and \"Sushi Automobiles.\" \u00a0As Americans, we have the proclivity to pull for the mom and pop underdogs, albeit local diners or Rudy. \u00a0However, this purported \"Sushi Village\" turns that American ideal on its head. \u00a0 The village lost me when they seated 7 and provided one menu. \u00a0Yes, 1 menu. \u00a0Even worse, they carelessly provided an ink pen (a very cheap one) rather than a pencil. \u00a0How did this place not anticipate that parties of 2 or more may be prone to changing their minds? \u00a0After 30 minutes of all 7 people agreeing what we would order, the menu looked like the ledger of a back-alley bookie. \u00a0Besides that, it forced us to all choose a leader who took command of the 1 menu and record all of our wishy-washy requests. \u00a0Part of the wishy-washiness came from the menu's arrogant lack of pictures. \u00a0One would think an under-dog refugee camp wouldn't be so arrogant.Speaking of arrogance, the staff moved like a south Louisiana swamp. \u00a0Slow, sloppy, boggy.

If what you're trying to do is eat a TON of pretty decent sushi for a crazy low price, then Sushi Village is your place. Located in a somewhat random little shopping center up in Ridgeland (right near the county line), this place is nothing special from the outside. From the inside, it doesn't seem incredibly special either, to be honest. It's clean, usually quiet, and I've never seen it even close to crowded. The servers are friendly enough, though not particularly attentive. The sushi itself is pretty decent. It's for sure not the best sushi in Jackson (that goes to Edo, in my opinion) but considering how low their prices are, it's better than you'd expect. I'd say it's better than the sushi you can get at Kroger or Whole Foods. The rolls are small. The non-sushi options are particularly enjoyable, though. They have a large selection of tempura and the seaweed salad is delicious. I always go for some cheese wontons too, but that's because I have an addiction to cheese wontons. Here's why I keep coming back to Sushi Village though-- at lunch, you can eat ALL YOU WANT for $8 and at dinner it's only $13. You heard me right-- all you can eat for less than $15. See what I mean about crazy low prices? Some words of wisdom, though: Know your limits. The first time my friends and I came here, we got a little too hype on the whole \"All You Can Eat\" idea and misinterpreted it as a challenge to \"Eat It All.\" We left with stomach pains, for sure. As long as you respect yourself (which is a lesson often learned the hard way), you'll have a great time at Sushi Village. Get a ton of sushi for a super low price and get some tempura, seaweed salad, miso soup, etc while you're at it. Everything on the menu, besides the sushi rolls, comes in orders of one so if you want multiple cheese wontons, for example, make sure you denote on the menu that you hand to your server how many you'd like. You can keep ordering, though, if you found you haven't had enough after your first round. The food comes out super quick, but this is probably because there's rarely a ton of people in the joint.

We had the typical rolls, dynamite, Philly, California, spicy tuna - it was o.k. - the seafood wasn't as fresh as you would hope, but still edible. But at $8 what can you complain about? We were plenty full. We had the super sushi platter, some chicken teriyaki, fried rice, egg rolls, miso soup, clear soup, and sweet tea all for $20 for two people - that is a good bargain. In total from the waitress taking our order to receiving the order it was probably a 10 minute wait, give or take. So not bad on turnaround time.

The Vegetable Tempura was only sweet potatoes, which were good and broccoli, which as not so good. The Nigiri sushi was good, as were the rolls, especially the Shrimp and Avocado Hand Roll. The Sashimi as also good, as was the chicken terriyaki. One fellow diner ordered Scallops off of the Hibachi menu, which consisted of only 5 small scallops. The rest was vegetables. The Hibachi Salmon was good. The Fried Rice and Miso Soup (especially the latter) were awful. For dessert, I ordered the Fried Banana. Besides the banana not being a variety that I had ever had (not a regular banana, not a plantain), it was served on a bed of whipped cream.

I've been waiting to try it because I have friends who say it's great and go several times a week. It was exactly ass I expected- and OEC type Japanese. Not too Fancy. Styrofoam plates, as expected. However, they had the mother of all sushis- a sushi burrito. I didn't even scan the rest of the menu after that. I knew what my belly was destined for. Mine was tuna. So good. I ate it all. So pleased. Very full. Prices are good."], ["Leslie W.", "I decided to try Red Samurai based on previous Yelp reviews. I had sushi only and ordered the Sushi pizza and salmon lovers roll. So the main thing that jumped out at me was that my avocado pieces were brown. I get that avocados oxidize, but for presentation purposes restaurants can't be dishing out brown avocado. I should also note that I arrived after 8pm, so maybe that's an end of day issue. The sushi pizza is a cool concept and enough food for one. Plus it comes with a California roll. The salmon lovers roll was OK, but I didn't think the mango was balanced well. I am going back. I look forward to trying the hibachi. Oh, and I wish they put chopsticks in my carryout bag!"], ["Katherine B.", "I love this place. There was only 1 guy working on a Friday night, and he was killing it. Answering the phone, bussing tables and taking orders at the counter, and he was still super friendly. The food was also great. 12 bucks all you can eat sushi, and it comes with a soup and salad. I was SO full."], ["Sara C.", "First time eating here. Ordered to go. Very friendly. Best Hibachi \"to go\" I've had yet! Very good! Very clean environment. Even received a free drink for signing up for their club. No complaints this way :-)"], ["Dontae D.", "The food here is awesome. My family loves it. This place is clean, employees are friendly and the service is quick."], ["Max P.", "Sushi burritos. Well priced hibachi. Freaky fast service. It's got everything you need!!"], ["Matt H.", "Good place for a quick hibachi meal.This place falls in between OEC and a Hibachi restaurant that cooks at the table in front of you.The vegetables include broccoli which is a nice touch.The pink sauce is good, but they no longer have the hot pepper paste which is a must have item for me. The closest they have is a bottle of Sriracha.Prices are reasonable."]], "Little Saigon Sandwiches And Sushi": [["Drew H.", "Great Asian food on the spillway. Don't be in a hurry. Greatness takes time and it's only 1 cook in the kitchen. Grab a beer sit back and wait. The best Pho in greater Jackson!"], ["Jim B.", "Try and figure this one out. A sushi restaurant that doesn't have sushi. I've called several times to order sushi which is in the online menu but the lady always says \"we have no sushi\". Go figure. I guess I go to Osaka"], ["Sean H.", "I travel extensively throughout the U.S. And generally eat pho at least once a week. Had the #66 Pho Dac Biet (combination) with no tripe. It was good but the broth was missing the depth of flavor that most pho broths have so that was a bit disappointing. Good value for lunch and hopefully the broth \"issue\" was just a fluke."], ["Jose Reynaldo R.", "This is an amazing place for pho and Vietnamese sandwiches. Genuine, fresh and priced reasonably. A must try!"], ["Angie N.", "It is hard to come by good Pho here in Mississippi. \u00a0I am sure their other dishes like the rice or vermicelli noodle are better but the Pho here is a NO GO! \u00a0I was warned that their Pho is not good here but I had to try for myself just to know. \u00a0I thought well maybe it isn't as bad as what others have said. \u00a0It lacked flavor with a hint of sweetness. \u00a0I had to dose my soup with Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to make it flavorful. \u00a0For those that do not know much about Pho, as a note, the best tasting pho is one where you add little to no extra sauces or flavoring. \u00a0Coming from California I may have had the privilege of really good food. \u00a0Even the $2.99 bowl of pho tastes better in Cali.Service wise was fine, our server was nice."], ["Byron G.", "What a great place, No 67 steak pho was awesome! The sandwiches sounded great, gonna do those next visit, wife had veggi pho, said it was great, it is a hole in the wall and we loved"], ["T L.", "This is a hidden gem! \u00a0The Pho #67, pork vermicelli #80, & combination #91 are the three top items on the menu. I've tried all, \u00a0and they are delicious! \u00a0The house made chili garlic sauce is also a must try. The garlic pepper sauce is even sold in to go containers. It has about the same spice as Sriracha, but much more flavor. If you are having noodles, \u00a0the powdered pepper is also excellent. The son-in-law that runs the front is extremely friendly. This is an unassuming place that has authentic Vietnamese food, \u00a0with some of the recipes dating over 50 years old."], ["Emily S.", "Great Pho, great prices, friendly staff. \u00a0I have gotten it to go a lot and they package everything very well so I can put my Pho together to my liking when I get home."], ["Ruby T.", "pretty good\uff01I love Pho Dac Biet noodle soup so much\uff01\uff01I give it 4 stars because i don't like the sweet tea they gave to me lol"], ["Corey J.", "Great atmosphere , food is excellent , and outstanding staff. \u00a0Great prices and conversation. Highly recommend !!!!!!"], ["Jerry T.", "I picked up some spring rolls and the pork vermicelli, \u00a0and it took me on a ride to Flavortown.The spring rolls have both chicken and shrimp and are satisfyingly girthy. The sauce served with them is traditional and well executed.The pork vermicelli... I just... I just can't even... The pork was cooked perfectly and was seasoned with what seemed to be bits of magic. It balanced very well with the fresh vegetables and broth, to which I pounded with some garlic chili sauce. I was in heaven for about 10 minutes. \u00a0I would have eaten it faster, \u00a0but at several times I was so overcome with joy that I silently wept while cradling my head in my hands.Not only was the food ridiculously good, \u00a0but the staff was super cool and showed their appreciation. Home-girl in the kitchen does it right. She nailed it out the park. Also, \u00a0the appetizer and entree was only $13. I was appalled they would charge me so little, \u00a0so I tipped them heavily in spite. I've only been here once when passing through, \u00a0but the one time experience was great. \u00a0It might not be much to look at, \u00a0yet the food, service, \u00a0and price makes a must."], ["Alison L.", "The sandwiches are still amazing. I got spring rolls this time, and the ingredients were very fresh. I definitely recommend trying the green tea. I'm not really a green tea fan, but it was very light and subtly sweet. Worth checking out if you're in the area."], ["Duan C.", "It's been a while since I went here for lunch, but I am just getting to writing my review. Positives - staff is really nice, helpful and nice clean location. Negatives - I am partial to the portions I receive from Saigon. The food didn't taste bad. I would say their Pho uses a tad bit more fish sauce and other ingredient's - but I just prefer Saigon's Pho better. There are some other things on their menu I would like to try in the future. The only reason why I will return, is due to the A-1 service I received on my first visit. All in all, I am glad that I gave them a try."], ["B P.", "We love Vietnamese food, and we are lucky this one is in the hometown! \u00a0This is our go-to when we want Vietnamese, and this is the only restaurant we recommend. \u00a0The food has been so good! \u00a0Our favorites are the beef pho (different ones--the flank steak, the brisket, etc.), fried rice dishes, spring rolls, pork chop plate, pork vermicelli with and without egg rolls. \u00a0The pork is wonderful---it has a slight sweet and chargrilled taste. \u00a0The spring rolls are made fresh once you order them, and if you're not allergic to peanuts, get the peanut sauce to dip it in. \u00a0The fried rice can come as simple as you want it (with egg) or with meats and/or veggies. \u00a0Some of the dishes like the pork chop plate and pork vermicelli bowls are offered with the fish sauce, which is a nice complimentary sauce. \u00a0With the pork being slightly sweet and chargrilled, the fish sauce is slightly sweet but not so sweet to overwhelm your dish!Service is always good. \u00a0The family works hard, and you can see the older lady running back and forth from the kitchen to the freezers to get out the ingredients to cook with. (which also means fresh!) Cleanliness is big for us, and every time we've gone, it's been clean!!Check it out---take yourself, your friends, your family. \u00a0If you love Vietnamese food, you'll return."], ["Grace P.", "I've visited Little Saigon three times and I'm hooked. Every meal is better than the last. The beef pho is incredibly tasty. The broth is delightful, meat fresh, and the SAUCES. The sauces are so flavorful and have the perfect amount of heat. I even save their sauces to use in homemade dishes. In addition to the beef pho, I've ordered the grilled pork and egg roll vermicelli. This dish is my favorite so far. The egg rolls and grilled pork are so tasty that I'm left wanting more. The fish sauce is the perfect accompaniment. Do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and stop by this hidden gem. The customer service and food make Little Saigon one of my favorite restaurants. You'll be back for more!"], ["Linda N.", "Came with a group, ordered the pork vermicelli. Was so good. The grilled pork with rice is even better! Worth trying and returning to"], ["Kara D.", "This place was delicious!! I have been craving Pho since moving to Jackson and I was not disappointed when I finally found this spot. Also the staff was super nice, the guy waiting on my was so helpful and sweet"], ["Donald S.", "I really enjoy food that is close to being authentic as possible especially when it's a non-American food I find this place to be just that I eat there quite often and I really enjoy what I am served. This is a family owned establishment and the owners are very good people I find them highly friendly. It was possible to give more stars I would."], ["Brandon J.", "I've been frequenting this place for the past few months now, and I have to say... It's the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to!! The older lady who cooks all the meals in the kitchen must use nothing but fresh ingredients, because everything I've ever ordered has been phenomenal. You can tell she puts some love into her cooking and not just cooking to get by. I suggest the number 80, grilled pork vermicelli if you haven't eaten much Vietnamese, or the combination pho. Also, recently they starting serving certain Chinese meals. I had the General Tso's chicken today, and it was better than any Chinese restaurant I've ever been to... The chicken was so tender!!"], ["Kevin A.", "This is an authentic Vietnamese, family owned business. They have added a few Chinese/Japanese items to the menu to accommodate those unfamiliar with Vietnamese. I had the Yakisoba with chicken and it was excellent. My wife had vermicelli noodles with chicken and loved it. The owner also let us try an 18 hour broth that was delicious. I usually skip the soup at most Asian places for lack of taste. Friendly, laid back and quaint. (Note: currently not operation their sushi bar)."], ["Gabe M.", "We have been passing by this place everyday since it opened and boy have we been missing out on this gem minutes from our house. \u00a0 I didn't realize I liked Vietnamese food but this place was fantastic. Our waiter was unbelievably helpful and made it feel as if we were invited into someone's home. We might go back tomorrow we enjoyed it so much. I will gladly give this place my money. #6starsifIcould"], ["John M.", "My new favorite restaurant! The PHO is out of this world good and the service is even better. A great family run restaurant that makes you feel like you are another member \u00a0of their family. \u00a0Can't wait to go back again!"], ["Angela P.", "It was a different flavor in Jackson. \u00a0I really enjoyed myself. \u00a0The crab ragoons were delish, followed by a unique take on General Tso's which I would put right up there with the best I've ever had. \u00a0We had a lovely 12-18 hour broth soup and tried the chicken with vermicelli that popped up in other reviews. \u00a0This was my first introduction to This kind of food, and although the menu was a bit intimidating at first, the food that came to the table highlighted ingredients I (reassuringly) find at home. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0The server appeared to be the owner, and he took pride in explaining the vision and the preparation behind the menu. \u00a0He was quick to provide answers to every question I had in such a friendly manner. \u00a0I felt like a guest in his home, not a stranger off the street. \u00a0All in all, it was a great experience. \u00a0I look forward to my next visit and have already picked out the sandwich I'm going to try."], ["Chad S.", "So far I've had the chicken vermicelli noodle, pork sandwich, & chicken pho soup. The food talks to the soul somehow here. The owners are real folks. Service is with a smile and hustle but it can be slow since it's real food. Prices are not expensive so go out and try some of this great food."], ["Ryno H.", "Very happy to see another vietnamese place. This one offers the infamous banh mi. I had the pho here and it's good. Seems more homemade. As for banh mi, it lacks that punch, but is not bad, will be back"], ["Dee K.", "It's a small restaurant run by a Vietnamese lady and her son in law. Great place- smells a bit too much but the food is great. Dinner and take home for $25 is just great. Chicken vermicelli with pork Egg Rolls was just amazing. I could have given 5 stars but the night we went Sushi bar was closed."], ["Jason B.", "Everything was good everyone was very nice."], ["Lisa S.", "WOOHOOO!! \u00a0A Good addition to Jackson area. \u00a0I have been several times myself and also with 2 friends from LA and another from SC. \u00a0 They both enjoyed as much as I did. \u00a0The Bahn Mi is excellent. \u00a0The roasted pork is most flavorful with a nice dry rub, not unlike the red chinese roasted pork. \u00a0 I prefer the grilled pork and have yet to try the sausage. \u00a0The chicken was thigh meat and pretty boring. Their fried rice is delightful! A milder taste than Thai and Not greasy at all like chinese. \u00a0I drive just to get rice as a take out. \u00a0The sandwich is $5 and is very filling, ~. 8\". I usually eat off the rice 2 or 3 times. I have not tried the sushi, it reads quite interesting and appears to be most popular, i am just more of a purist with sushi. They do close btween meals. \u00a0 \u00a0Great place to grab for a picnic on reservoir. \u00a0Attentive service - great casual or to go place. I hope to see more customers."], ["Shannon N.", "When desperate for a Vietnamese sandwich, this would be a place to go in the Jackson metro area. There is a small variety of Vietnamese sandwiches here which are at an astonishing high price, starts at $4, which is quite high for a sandwich which usually averages $2.75 around the country. The menu, in general, is priced very high for the quality that anyone will receive.There are a few creative sushi rolls (the Brian roll, the Louis roll, etc), but true sushi enthusiasts will find this menu lacking in choices. However, they do have other offerings such as pho, and other varietal Vietnamese options. The quality is enough to offput my pho cravings for a few months, but not enough to make me want to come back on a regular basis for it. My own personal input on the pho is there is a huge lack of spices (cinnamon, cloves, etc), the broth is not clear but quite cloudy, oily on top, \u00a0and very small in portion for the price. I don't believe I should need to season my broth with extra fish sauce.The staff is plenty, but not well run. Our waitres was short and a bit impatient with us, fully letting us know she is not familiar with the menu. Will I be returning here? No, thanksFor a restaurant in Mississippi in the month of June, turning on the air conditioning would be nice too"], ["Dave C.", "Bun bi thit yuong (or something like that- can't remember the spelling) is to die for. Vermicelli noodles with bits of roasted pork, lettuce, cilantro and scallion; my new favorite thing!"], ["D F.", "Try #80! it's Grilled Pork and Egg Rolls on Vermicelli, also chicken available. Big \u00a0menu, lots of variety. Nice family owned restaurant!"], ["Marty S.", "Go!! I had the vermicelli pork bowl with egg roll on top, and my date had the pork sandwich. Both were awesome, and plenty of food. Order the crab rangoons because they're fresh, crispy and lots of flavor. This is a family-owned restaurant, and apparently they cook pretty much everything from scratch--and you can tell, because of how high quality the food is. Very happy with this discovery, and will def be back!"], ["Sonya W.", "Best sandwiches in Mississippi."]]}
