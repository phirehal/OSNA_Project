These have got to be the worst fajitas I've *ever* had. \u00a0This is not a \"I'm from Texas and any Tex Mex food made outside my beloved state is crap\" sort of biased review. \u00a0People from Indiana should be able to recognize the awfulness. \u00a0I checked Yelp before I drove up there from downtown Jackson, and saw a lot of glowing reviews. \u00a0What I didn't do was look at the pictures people had taken of their fajita plates which would have tipped me off sooner, because the meat is not right at all.They clearly do not use skirt or flank steak for their fajita meat, like you're supposed to. \u00a0It chewed more like eye of round. \u00a0If you go look at how the eye of round is packaged in the grocery, you'll see \"medallions\" of meat maybe three to four inches in diameter. 1/4 to 1/2\" thick. \u00a0You're supposed to cook whatever portion of skirt or flank steak (1/2lb, 2lbs, etc.) in one piece, pull it off the grill, let it rest, and then slice it against the grain. \u00a0That gives you a nice medium pink center, with plenty of juices and good tenderness, not chewy at all. El Charro does one of two things with their fajita beef, best I can figure: Option 1: They take thin pieces of something like eye of round and cook the hell out of them, until there is zero chance of juiciness or pinkness, then slice with the grain. \u00a0Option 2: They pre-sliced all the meat, again, with the grain, and threw it on the flattop (clearly not grilled). \u00a0Again, no pink, no juice. \u00a0What either of these cooking methods results in is meat that isn't begging to fall off your fork. \u00a0Instead, it turns the meat springy because it's so overcooked. \u00a0Imagine picking up a piece of steak with your fork. \u00a0Next, imagine flicking it with your finger. \u00a0Imagine it rebounding back at you when you flick it, after moving only so slightly. \u00a0Much of the meat is chopped too small, so that it's difficult to find it in the plate. \u00a0Smaller than the bell peppers and onions, that's for sure. Chewy, chewy, chewy, chewy. \u00a0It's bad. \u00a0If you went to Taco Bell, bought 6 steak soft tacos, pulled the meat out, chopped it up like you were making a cheesesteak, and then cooked it all for another five minutes (which is five minutes and thirty seconds overcooked), you have a rough approximation of what you're dealing with. \u00a0I'd like to apologize to Taco Bell for even associating them with meat this bad. \u00a0Shoe leather. \u00a0A chopped up basketball. \u00a0A run over football. \u00a0Got the point?Onto the salsa and guac, which were merely C-/D+ levels of offense against Mexican/Tex Mex. \u00a0The salsa is made with tomato sauce. \u00a0Not with canned diced tomatoes doctored up to be salsa, and maybe blended a bit long, but straight tomato sauce. \u00a0Very little chunkiness to it, almost no heat. \u00a0I've gotten better salsa in a breakfast bar at the Courtyard Hotel 45 minutes outside of Chicago.Guac: I like it a bit chunky, this was too smooth, and seemed like a cross between guac and guac sauce. \u00a0You make guac-ish sauce by cutting the avocado with something like sour cream, tomatillos, green onions, etc. \u00a0That's not actual guac, it's guac sauce. \u00a0I think it was actually blended tomatillos with some avocado sprinkled in. \u00a0If you want green sauce with your chips, I guess it would be ok, but if you're looking for some good fats to stick to your fajita that actually taste like avocado, this is not it."], ["Kimberly A.", "I travel often to Jackson for work and this is my favorite restaurant for great Mexican food to go.

She seemed very irritated by this request and it turned out the rice and beans are not vegetarian even though its listed as being vegetarian. So we ordered the vegetarian fajitas with no rice and no beans. They gave us a huge plate of grilled veggies and only three very small tortillas. How are we suppose to fit all those veggies into just three tortillas? Plus the tortillas weren't made in house and neither was the salsa.

All in all, it was the standard yellow rice. Minimal seasoning. Both the rice and beans (when ordered separately) were big portions, which I appreciated. Ok. The chips and salsa. The chips were a yellow color, much unlike the previous owner's. At first, the taste kinda threw me off because they weren't what I was used to. However, after eating a couple more I realized they were pretty good. The salsa comes in a small styrofoam coffee cup (meh) with a lid. It was slightly above average, but I've had way better. It had a bit of a tomato paste aftertaste. Not sure how I feel about that.... The total of all my food was a little over four bucks. Not bad I suppose.

But when that store outgrew this space, they moved it to a new building across the parking lot and started the taqueria in its place. During our visit, we tried a chicken empanada, chicken gordita, chicken taco and pastor taco. They were all delicious, but the real star was the empanada, which featured chicken, cheese, tomatoes, and avocado wrapped up in a corn flour pocket and deep fried. The tacos and gordita also included a slice of avocado on top, which was a nice touch. Unlike most empanadas that I've seen elsewhere, this one was huge (as you can see in the photo I posted) and was fried to perfection (not too greasy and with a bit of crunchiness to the outer shell). \u00a0In addition to all this, the prices were excellent (I think the empanada and gordita were about $4 each).

The enchiladas are very good and have a selection of fresh sauces to put on them. The beans and rice are very tasty too! They have a perfectly acceptable beer and margarita selection which is all you need. They are pretty flexible in the kitchen and will let you mix and match your enchiladas or tacos.The main drawback is that some of the menu is a little pricey compared to other tex-mex.

The staff is friendly and super helpful when you're deciding what to order. The beer selection is good and their margaritas are top notch.

The Doritos Locos Tacos brought me in this time and, while I thought they were downright tasty (there are days when you just want a taco with some cheesy Doritos and don't care that the meat isn't all meat, etc), the actual location could use a bit of cleaning. The bathroom was on the verge of flooding, but I will say the floor in the actual dining area was pretty clean (the lady behind the counter came out to clean/sweep in between customers), but it just felt neglected somehow. But, that isn't why I went with 2 vs 3 stars, it was the preparation of my tacos. I don't expect them to be full and brimming or even look like the photos, but I ended up getting an extra taco to go because the first two were so lacking in substance. All this said, I'll go back at some point, probably in another year, and it will be to the same location because it is very convenient to work. I wouldn't tell anyone not to eat here, but I certainly wouldn't suggest that anyone come to this location if it was out of their way."]], "Jose's Tamales": [["Joe H.", "I was a little concerned checking out a Mexican restaurant in Mississippi but traveling in the south as a vegetarian is a challenge and veggie fajitas are always a fantastic option.

We were wobbling throughout our entire dinner.Excellent chips and salsa! We went through three baskets and each time, they came out hot and fresh. I expected the salsa to be a little spicier but it was good nonetheless.Me and my compadre both had the fajita steak quesadillas and although they were excellently cooked and seasoned, there was too much cheese on mine. (I know, is there even such a thing as TOO MUCH cheese?) They also weren't cut, so it was more like a big messy burrito! I will say that the fajita steak was very tender and juicy and I would have been happy with just a huge plate of that.My husband had the #78 which is the pablano chile relleno and his exact words were \"this is the best I've ever had\". The kids choices are very limited and they offer thing like a burrito, taco, nachos and a quesadilla. The kids nachos were fair but she didn't like them because the \"chicken tasted funny\". I wish they would have had a few more American choices such as chicken nuggets or a hamburger.Our food was out super fast, the chips and salsa were fantastic, our waiter was efficient and friendly, there is a ton of dinner and lunch choices and like my husband said, the chile relleno is the best he has ever had.

The price was amazing for a dinner combo of only $7. The taco comes in a hard shell, (I was kind of hoping for a soft corn tortilla) with just meat, cheese, and lettuce. I added some salsa and it worked better. The chili relano had a cheese sauce in it which was not what I was expecting, but not bad. The major turn off though was that the chili relano had a ton of seeds in it toward the end. I expect some but this was a bit much. The enchilada wasn't bad but the \u00a0sauce was a tad salty. You can't beat the price of their combinations for a large variety at $7 each.

If she didn't want to do her job, she should have stayed at home or seek other employment. We asked her could we order our food at the same time as I drinks (to make the wait shorter). She insisted on getting our drink orders first. That was another 30 minute wait. We ordered the 2 for 1 margaritas and waters. (I asked for water 5 times over the course of our time in that establishment and never got it). She brought out our drinks and finally took our food orders (at this point we'd been in this place for an hour and still no food). After another 45 minutes, we see tables that were seated after us receiving their food and we still hadn't received ours. She finally brings out a full tray of plates...only 2 plates came to our table and the rest went to other tables. When one of us asked what seemed to be the problem and why other tables that were just seated receiving their food before ours, she leaves and comes back with a plate and literally slings the plate at her. No exaggeration. What if that plate had been hot? We eventually get the manager to vent our frustration, and he has a horrible attitude as well. After he grabs the 2 plates off the table that we did get, he tells us that we can leave after we pay for half of those 2 for 1 drinks. We wait again another 30 minutes for the receipt to pay that we never got. Finally, we each took out $3 and took it to the hostess and walked out. The reason we did that was so that they couldn't call the police for us leaving without paying. They had no intentions of printing us out a receipt anyway.

As with other Garcia family Mexican restaurants, they served mediocre, over-priced food. I ordered a chicken and steak quesadilia with peppers and onions. The meat was cooked fine, but the peppers and onions had very little flavor and were under-cooked. My husband just got a taco salad, but said the shell was not very good.

Bar tender informed me after he served it that they don't have olive juice, so he muddled the olive instead. What?! A full bar should have olive juice on hand, but you should definitely tell the customer before hand if you don't have it. And why would anyone enjoy a muddled olive? I will say the bar tender asked another staffer oIf they had a new jar of olives and reshook my drink with some juice, but it wasn't tangy enough for my taste.

The rice and beans that come with most dishes are not so tasty.The main menu is pretty good, and there is a decent range of things to try. I love the black bean tamale and the burrito is pretty tasty. I would put this one in the same category as Jaco's Tacos - it is a little creative spin on typical Tex-Mex.

We were put on a 15 minute wait, so I took this time to look at the menu. I was sorely disappointed to see that they did not offer any vegan options and very few vegetarian choices either. My choices included a salad without cheese or nothing. Upon being seated we received chips and salsa as expected, but I could not eat the salsa because it was very spicy. When I asked the waiter, who seemed to be lacking a few brain cells, if he could knew of any vegan options. He had me tell him what vegan is. Ok. So he went to ask someone and then gave me an option of a bean burrito or a salad with no cheese. I ordered the burrito. It was a bean burrito with no sauce and a side of beans. I ate it, but felt deprived. My friend got one of the salads but was disappointed in the contents of the salad. It looked very plain to me. It seemed like it was missing quality and variety. My friend did say the 10 dollar margarita was good. So then the check came. The charge for the bean burrito was 10.50$. I told the waiter I found the charge excessive. To his credit, he changed the charge to a kid's burrito for 5$. I honestly think Taco Bell has a much tastier burrito.

The cheese dip tasted vaguely of velveeta and I could barely taste the Hatch chiles bragged about on the menu; the guacamole was just okay but I suppose October isn't really avocado season. There was no heat in anything. I had cheese and onion enchiladas and the feta on top made them too salty; I didn't even finish my plate.

I thought everything I had, from the chips and salsa to my main dish, was great. The margaritas they make are very good as well. On the negative side, the drafts (for the same 12 ounces, at least that is what they thought each draft was) were more expensive than bottled beer. I also teetered on giving them only 3 stars based on their tortillas. My wife had the enchiladas and they were almost ruined by the tortillas. They are homemade, but they do not represent the nice, thin, delicate nature of a tortilla. I'm not sure if they use the same type of tortilla on tacos, fajita, etc, but they should change it. I wouldn't order anything with that tortilla.

Food was kind of disappointing. Definitely not \"upscale Mexican\". Better described as being a Taqueria. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good, either. I called in a take out order around 7:30 on a Wednesday. Was a little surprised when they said 20-30 minutes, but ok. When I got there 25 min later, I stood at the counter for a few minutes before anyone looked up or offered to help me. Then, all I heard for the next five minutes was 'Just a second'. My ticket got screwed up, but the staff was really apologetic and even discounted my order significantly. So then the food. I ordered the enchiladas; one chicken, one beef, one pork. Came with rice and beans, and I had an order of cheese dip and chips and salsa. Best thing I ate was the chips. The sauce was one the side for the enchiladas, which pretty much just makes it a taco with sauce. The meat fillings were ok; tortillas got cold pretty quickly since they weren't baked in the sauce. The traditional (red) enchilada sauce was really not tasty. The first flavor that hit was very bitter and almost burnt. After that, the other flavors came out and it was pretty good, but that first part just made it not worth it. Rice and beans were super bland. Not worth the calories. Salsa was ok. Seemed fresh made. It was very chunky, which is not my personal preference, but the flavor was good. Cheese dip was identical to what they have at Border Cafe. White and yellow cheeses, with peppers, onions, and cilantro. Very bland and yet salty. The chips were pretty good. They're coated in seasoning, which is a nice change. They're also fresh made from real tortillas, vs. the crappy thin chips that taste like they just came out of a bag.

We order the Friday special which consisted of Catfish (3 very small pieces more like slivers) Jalapeno slaw and french fries. The catfish, though small, tasted good but the jalapeno flavored slaw was horrible, we sat there trying to determine what it taste like as well. The other meal ordered was compared to lighter fluid in taste. As I stated i wanted to be fair with this evaluation, and I will say this; the waitress was very kind, but she talked so soft that I had to translated for the guys at the table.

Or if you turn into pine knoll dr, then la morena is located right behind papa John building with 1 way access on left/right of building. Good luck finding it but it surely serve delicious foods w ok service if you find it. Salut.."]], "Margaritas": [["Jose C.", "I am not a huge fan of Mexican food but my wife is.

The environment is your typical set-up for Americanized Mexican restaurants. The staff are what makes this establishment my \"go-to\" choice when I'm in the mood for Mexican food. The are super friendly and more than willing to accommodate their patrons in any way possible. My food is always delivered to my table quickly and piping hot!If you're a drinker, their Monster Margaritas are HUGE and STRONG! Pair that with their flat screen TVs that are always tuned in to sporting events or the news, and you've got a winning combination (especially during NBA playoffs).Now for my favorite part: THE FOOD! I think I've tried at least half of what's on their menu, I've never had anything that wasn't tasty. The portions are always more than enough (so much so, that I always end up taking a to-go box home). They also have chicken fingers and fries for those of you who have children who are picky eaters like mine."], ["Crystal S.", "Nothing bad to say, food was speedily delivered, and margaritas were 2 for 1 all day. It's your typical tex mex Mexican restaurant! Drinks were pretty good. You could choose what type if margarita you wanted, strawberry, mango, peach and lime, not just limited to you choice. Friendly staff and they had several flat screen TV in view almost anywhere you sit."], ["Latoya S.", "The food is awesome! You walk in, nice environment and the staff are very friendly.

I was in town for a training for my job but I would definitely come back again. Extremely satisfied and full!"], ["Aquarian E.", "This is the Absolute WORST Mexican food I have ever had. We ordered the chile relleno, margarita dip and a chimichanga with steak, chicken and shrimp. Everything was bland and uneventful to say the least. The plates where hot but the food on them was cold. The reasonable prices and the monster margarita were the only good things at this place. There salsa was not impressive at all. It was similar to Pace Picante Sauce, definitely not what you expect in a authentic Mexican restaurant."], ["Kevin S.", "My food was pretty tasty, standard for Dixie Mex. Unfortunately, the queso dip was lukewarm at best and the service was atrocious. After three mediocre experiences over the years I've leavened my lesson and won't be back."], ["Alicia A.", "I love this place! I haven't been in about a year, but it was worth the wait!

It was ever so tough and it took me forever to chew.Its is pure tex-mex, not true authentic mexican - but it will not disappoint if you are hungry."], ["Brian B.", "My family was passing through town and checked out this place. \u00a0We saw that it had favorable reviews and decided to try for ourselves.We were greeted by very friendly staff and had great service. \u00a0The food and drinks were excellent. \u00a0Portions sizes were good.I was expecting a large ticket as we ordered everything under the sun and when the ticket came out, it was 40% under what I had expected.We come through yearly and I do plan to visit here again."], ["Sonia C.", "I absolutely love this place. I lived in Ridgeland for almost ten years, and this was my #1 favorite restaurant. The people are nice, the food is fantastic, the service is good, the prices are reasonable, they have vegetarian options, and it's kid-friendly. I WISH we had a Mexican restaurant this good in Houston. This is not Tex-Mex. I live in Texas, and what we have is MUCH different, and not half as good. I hope you'll love this place as much as I did!The chips are crispy and fresh, and you can tell they make their own the salsa, which is very good. I love the queso dip, so order that for sure. \u00a0To drink, \u00a0I ordered iced tea or a margarita. The iced tea was always fresh, and the margaritas were excellent. For large parties, order margarita pitchers. To eat, I've ordered everything on the vegetarian menu. My favorite items are the cheese enchiladas (white cheese), the bean burrito, and the bean and cheese chalupa. My husband liked the vegetarian fajitas. The refried beans and rice were always good too. I don't have any criticism of Margaritas. Even when I give five stars, I usually leave a suggestion of how to improve, but I can't think of anything that I'd change. If I still lived there, I'd eat there once a week. I miss that place.

I dare you to find another 2 for 1 margarita's this good!"], ["Linell B.", "My wife and I stopped by mid-afternoon on a Sunday, so the place was pretty empty. We were one of two tables when we first arrived.Firstly, the prices were a little high for a Mexican food place. You're looking at $10 for the cheapest entree and around $15 for most of the stuff you'll really want. Whatever, I'm all for paying more for a good food and service.But...Even though we were one of two tables service was _very_ lackluster. The food was slow coming out and we weren't asked how the food was or for drink refills until we were ready to leave. But hey, I can deal with relatively high prices and not so hot service for great food!And...The food was pretty meh. Not bad by any means, but also far from amazing. My wife got a small plate of chicken and rice and I got a combo platter. Mine was definitely more bang for the buck than hers, but I've had as good or better at every other Mexican place in town. The saving grace, and what warranted a third star, was the two for one margaritas. Of course, I didn't get that until I was ready to leave, but oh well.All in all it wasn't absolutely terrible, but I won't be back anytime soon."], ["Jonna B.", "At 3:45 on a Sunday, I expected the business to be slow. Not service, but the business.

The price is high and the portions are tiny and mediocre. I won't be coming back."], ["Dennis T.", "Ordered the mixed fajita grill - shrimp, chicken and beef. I was amazed to received a very large sizzling platter along with a large plate of rice and very delicious retried beans. I thought maybe they'd misunderstood my order and brought food for two! Then I got the bill - $16 for all of that is terrific. The chips and salsa were very good, though I suppose the salsa could have been a little hotter, but it's clearly made there.

My only complaint is with the owner. He is often at the hostess kiosk, and has been quite rude from time to time. For example, my wife and I walked in around 8 one evening, and were ignored for a good 10 min, despite being the only ones walking in to the restaurant. We were eventfully seated, but it was obvious he wasn't happy - despite the restaurant closing at 9:30."], ["Sydney M.", "I've been here so many times, it's crazy. \u00a0First off, the P5 (rice + chicken + melted queso) is muy delicioso. \u00a0One time, my family went for lunch, and we all ordered the P5. I'm sure the server laughed at us, but it's the restaurant's fault for making it so dang tasty! \u00a0One teeny tiny complaint out of the many times I've been there is that one day I didn't finish my P5 and took it home. The next day when reheating it, it smelled fishy/shrimpy. I eventually spit it out and threw it away. \u00a0I haven't ordered the P5 again, out of fear, but I'm hoping it was a one off. \u00a0The bright side is that I have gotten to try a lot of new dishes!Now to the positives: price, margarita happy hours, and salsa. \u00a0The price at this place can't be beat. Most meals are around $10 and the margaritas are flowing every night because they have happy hour every single day. \u00a0Every day is different. I know Thursday is 2/1 margs. and Friday is half-off until 7pm. \u00a0The salsa is also really good. \u00a0It's got a kick to it, and tastes really good (not like it was poured from a spaghetti sauce jar). \u00a0As for the service, some servers are better than others. I've had really great service, and I've had a server who I'm pretty sure hated our guts. But no matter how they look like they're feeling, they've always been extremely professional. \u00a0And I always try to tip well. So check it out! It gets really busy on Friday and Saturday nights as well as Sunday lunch."], ["Chris P.", "Slow service but the food more than made up for it. All Mexican restaurants in the area serve chips and salsa, but there is something different about theirs that makes it especially delicious."], ["Meagan A.", "This is one of my go-to places for lunch with coworkers. When it comes to lunch, this place is a triple threat! Good food, cheap prices, and quick service. It's one of the few places that actually take your order at the table and can deliver your food in a timely manner. This place is consistent, so rightfully, it's always full. Adding to the speedy lunch, I really like how the checks are handled. Each person is issued a separate check and pays individually at the register in the front. No confusion or mixing up of cards."], ["Gene T.", "Not your typical bland Mexican food. \u00a0Very tasty."], ["Mindy R.", "My husband and I come here regularly.

However this 2nd time will me make look else where. To start out server's cologne was pungent, so much it lingered for minutes after he left.

Typical tex-mex and it's served fast, hot, and is not expensive. I've been twice - remembered them from a trip to Jackson a couple of years ago and made a point of returning.
