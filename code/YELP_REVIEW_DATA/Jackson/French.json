{"BRAVO! Italian Restaurant & Bar": [["Rachel P.", "Bravo is definitely one of the nicest restaurants in Jackson, and one of my favorites in the North Jackson area. It's a great spot for a date night if you're looking for dinner, but the lunchtime vibe is much more casual. It's a great spot to grab lunch with a colleague. I've done dinners here with groups before, as well, and it's always worked out really nicely! They do a great job accommodating groups as long as you plan ahead. It's an \"Italian\" restaurant, but definitely a Mississippi take on Italian. The portions are very generous, so be prepared for that. Bring your appetite. Everything I've eaten here has been genuinely super delicious. The pastas and salads are always on point. I'm a huge fan of all their seafood dishes. The desserts here are so good, but HUGE so plan on splitting them! Rather than get dessert, I usually opt for one of their after dinner drinks with kahlua or some other liqueur. They're all really, really well made. Like I said, this is definitely one of the nicer spots in town. Think white tablecloths. Don't show up in your Nike shorts, is what I'm saying. The servers here are super professional and knowledgable. They're always ready with a recommendation for a wine pairing and they know the menu extensively. It might not be the most creative menu in town, but it's a delightful and reliable place. If you're looking for a date night or need to head somewhere nice with out of town guests, Bravo is an excellent choice."], ["Gary J.", "Current title: \"Bravo!\"-- is inaccurate and self-aggrandizing. \u00a0More appropriate title: \"This will do but there is much better elsewhere!\"I ordered the veal parmesan. \u00a0I made better Italian dishes using sub-rate utensils from Family Dollar in my small and low-rent college apartment with McCormick packets.The patrons seem to be of upper middle class origin. \u00a0The kind that likes to feel rich but are not rich. \u00a0Everything is a la carte. \u00a0This business makes representations that it is a classic Italian eatery but fails to deliver. \u00a0The only thing that makes it similar to classic Italian haunts is that everything is a la carte and exceedingly expensive. Now that the rant is out of system, let us coldly and logically examine \"Bravo!\" \u00a0Nestled in a swanky shopping center in north Jackson, Bravo carries the promise of exquisite dining as the wine glasses ring at the counter. \u00a0The restaurant has a rather lengthy and impressive wine menu. \u00a0The bartenders act with expert timing, although they refrain from Kung Fu fighting. The food you might ask? \u00a0I observed 3 dishes and ate one. \u00a0My first observation was a splendid bowl of catfish and andouille in a gumbo (not even remotely Italian, but we will leave this here). \u00a0The next was salmon presented in an organized manner with an excellent looking cream drizzled over it. \u00a0My final observation was the pork chop, served bone-in, over mashed potatoes, and covered in a delightful mushroom gravy. I ate my veal parmesan--begrudgingly. \u00a0A fellow dinner guest allowed me to taste the pork chop. \u00a0This was a very incredible bite. \u00a0A bite for the ages and to be indelibly recorded in the \u00a0annals of yelp. \u00a0However, I did not order the chop because the waiter, in a stroke of fate, failed to suggest it to me. The pork chop quickly stole the limelight of our eyes and our conversation. \u00a0It was plated perfectly, at a healthy 8 oz, and bespoke its imminent greatness. \u00a0Meanwhile, I muscled through my so-called veal parmesan [sic]. \u00a0Allthewhile, I was eyeing the pork chop. \u00a0After time, the artificial candle light reflecting downward brought out the sheer redness of the marinara. \u00a0It was as if the veal was looking to me longingly it kept catching me stare at the pork chop on the other plate. \u00a0When dinner was over, I had only eaten the meat of the veal and allowed the dry pasta and wilted greens served alongside of it to grow cold into the night. \u00a0As the waiter brought the check, I looked over at that young couple by the window and reflected how much in common I had with that veal parmesan."], ["Ryan K.", "Bravo! is a great local stop in north Jackson with an award-winning wine selection. \u00a0While I can't say I was put over the top with all of their dinner entrees, their pizzas, appetizers, and deserts are fantastic. \u00a0Of particular note, the Shrimp Basil Pesto wood-fired pizza: savory, rich, and filling for the price.I'd recommend Bravo on the later side of the evening when you need to cool down with a great glass of wine and a very friendly staff."], ["Ryder T.", "I am having a really hard time deciding if this is a 3 or 4 star place. I'll settle on four stars because the food is good and is genuinely good quality. The service is typically very good too. From time to time they will have a special that truly delights.For a very long time, Bravo! Was basically the only nice restaurant in town, and to some extent, I feel that they have just coasted along on that reputation. I don't really know that much has changed as more restaurants have popped up. That is not a terrible thing, but now we are used to going places where we can try new and exciting things all of the time. Bravo is not *exciting* but it is still very good.This is a lovely white tablecloth sort of place. The waitstaff is typically a cut above other restaurants in Jackson, so this makes it a safe bet for a nice date.One of the cool things about Bravo! is that even if it is not culinarily that cutting edge, Jeff Good keeps the business side interesting with promotions that are appropriate for a nice place. You have to pay attention to their emails or twitter, but one creative promotion they did was a \"cellar clearance auction\" where you could bid on very nice bottles of wine from their cellar. If I recall correctly I got what was probably the best bottle of wine I have ever had for half off.It is worth knowing this restaurant, but there are just much more exciting places in town as well."], ["Kayla C.", "Hiding in the upstairs level of the Highland Village is where you'll find Bravo. They're known for their Italian food, and rightfully so. I've been to Bravo several times and have always had a great service and dinner. I took my parents here for their first time and they fell in love. We had the sampler appetizer plate, which was almost filling enough! It had goat cheese, rosemary mushrooms, eggplant, cooked garlic, and lots of other goodies to stick our forks into. For my dinner I ordered a small tomato basil soup and a half Spinach and goat cheese salad. I always get the salad, it's absolutely wonderful. The dressing is a warm balsamic and ummmmm just yum. I got a half size and I was more than satisfied. They offered us free dessert for asking us to move tables when we first arrived, so why not? The menu had so many options it was definitely had to choose. I saw they had after dinner drinks so I ordered a toasted almond. It was SO good as I love almond flavors. It was a shaken mixture of Khalua, half & half, and amaretto. Some other things probably. The table ordered the brownie with ice cream and I got a bite of that too, so yum. Overall, our waitress was SO sweet and fun. I will bring my family back here."], ["Elizabeth B.", "Came to Bravo! Italian Restaurant & Bar yesterday for my brother's late birthday Lunch. It was good, I had the Tri-Colored Tortellini w/Chicken, it had Artichokes, Mushrooms, Spinach, Red Onion & Roasted Red Peppers in it and it had a Tomato-Cream Sauce on it. The Pasta was good and the cheese inside was good, however I would of liked to have, had a few more mushrooms and artichokes in it. I also had Tomato Basil Soup, it was good but I wanted a little bit more basil flavor in it. Then I had the Tiramisu and a Single shot of Espresso, they were the best thing I had at the restaurant. Can't wait to come back and have more."], ["Dom T.", "I was offered a gift certificate and a chance to make things right from my last visit, but decided to give the place a second chance on my dime with some friends. This wouldn't be a fair rating if it was paid for by Bravo. We had four different appetizers and all were delicious. The staff was courteous and pleasant to deal with. I didn't notice any employees on their phones, which is always nice. Bravo, perhaps my last time there was just a bad night for you. Or perhaps someone decided to tighten things up around there. Either way, good job! I not only recommend Bravo but will return, very hungry."], ["Sam S.", "Bravo is my wife and my absolute favorite restaurant in Jackson. The food is always perfect, service is top notch. If you haven't tried it yet you need to. The restaurant has a fancy feel without being over the top. The atmosphere is great for small groups, families, and especially couples. The servers are at friendly, professional, and efficient. This is one of the few restaurants that can always keep my drink cup full (a true feat since I drink water ridiculously fast) There is a bar area that I've never sat at, as well as traditional seating. The restaurant doesn't take reservations. It can get a little crowded on weekends after six, but it is worth the wait. As far as food there is everything from the ten dollar range up to mid thirties. I'm a bit of a cheapskate, so I've really only tried the sub twenty dollar options. My favorite is the chicken sweet potato Gorgonzola salad. My wife really enjoys the shrimp and pesto pizza. As appetizers go they bring you bread with olive oil for free. My favorite to order are the fried polenta - fantastic if you like mushrooms, and the fried brie. \u00a0They have a really impressive wine selection. I've only tried a few of the cheaper wines - around 24 bucks a bottle, and have been incredibly happy with the taste of them. For desserts you have got to try the peanut butter pie... Simply amazing. They have other options that are great as well, but the pie is crazy good. I have been personally greeted by the owners several times, which is really a nice sign in a restaurant. You can even check out the full menu with prices online, which is great. To conclude, I am sure you will be happy if you choose to eat here."], ["Camille M.", "The grilled chicken salad with Gorgonzola, diced sweet potatoes, dried cranberries, walnuts and vinaigrette rocks! The tomato basil soup is really yummy too- very creamy and rich. I also highly recommend the pizza and the Caesar salad. They have a full gluten free menu for those of you with special dietary needs. Love coming to bravo when I'm in Jackson. Great happy hours too! This is an easy, fun spot.. One of my Jackson stand-bys!"], ["James J.", "View: the view is not spectacular. \u00a0But , I like the atmosphere. \u00a0 It is very upscale but not crazy prices. \u00a0It is right off interstate 55 in North Jackson Mississippi. Prices: prices are not too bad. \u00a0You can get an entree for twenty bucks or less.Waitstaff is good. \u00a0I have never had bad service. \u00a0 I read some of the reviews about the service being bad but that has not been my experience. Food: I like the bruschetta and I have them add cheese to it. \u00a0I also like the paneed redfish. \u00a0it is lightly flowered and is really good.I have eaten here a lot ad if you like wine they have a wide selection. I would recommend this place to eat. \u00a0So if you are coming to Jackson you should try this place."], ["Orlean S.", "Visited Bravo for the first time over Memorial Day holiday. Thankfully it wasn't busy and we were seated fairly quickly. The d\u00e9cor is nice but not fancy. The server was extremely nice and relatively attentive. With many high dollar restaurants you never know how much food will you get - is it enough you don't need to order side items or will you pay a lot and still leave hungry? So each of us ordered an appetizer; me the grilled portobello mushroom and my guest the pecan crusted brie. Both were surprisingly large and enough to share. The Brie was especially tasty. Then we each ordered a half spinach salad which was a nice size and very appetizing with goat cheese, candied nuts, and sweet dressing. The main course for both of us was the specials for the night; Crab crusted amberjack for me and salmon with fried green tomatoes for my guest. For $28 I was underwhelmed at the portion size of my plate. It was a small piece of amberjack with about 3 sliced new potatoes. I was left guessing what \"crab crusted\" meant as I saw no crab. The salmon special was better in both size and presentation. While the size of the fish wasn't notable, there was about 4 fried green tomatoes along with corn and a couple of green beans. But again, not what I was expecting after the large plates of appetizers and salad.For dessert we finished with the flourless chocolate torte and a brandy alexander with ice cream. The torte was very chocolaty with a nice presentation. (If you want the best flourless chocolate cake try the Bonzo at Anchuca, Vicksburg.)Overall it was a nice experience and I will return, even though it was the highest price I've ever paid for a meal in Jackson. But I didn't leave hungry! To do it over again I would share an appetizer and probably order a vegetable side with my main course. I would try the redfish and stay away from the crab crusted special."], ["Brandon T.", "Every time I looked over this restaurant in reviews I was thinking it was Bravo's Italian Cucina, the chain restaurant found in several major cities. But it was definitely not when I checked out the website! The quality of food and calibre was entirely different from what I was expecting! The ambience was one of the classiest I have been to in Jackson with dim candle lit lighting, white table cloths, and huge windows overlooking the highway. The menu was on the pricier side and it may or may not be worth the price. I enjoyed the dining experience, but the meal itself was only average. ."], ["John B.", "The paneed redfish is one of the best meals I've ever had! I get it every time I go there. The tomato-basil soup is so good as well."], ["Bonita M.", "Was disappointed in my penne & blacken Chix dish same for bread which I had to ask forservice was good but a delightful meal would have been better.my 1st trip to Jax MS & had higher hopes for a nice dinner"], ["Sweet O.", "Bravo, I loved you. Notice the past tense. You still have an incredible wine list, but much like your sister restaurants, Broad Street and Sal & Mookie's, you are bordering on being a has been with a tired menu, hit or miss service and are way over priced. Honestly, I have recently (and regrettably) had a better meal at one of the Jackson area chain restaurants. You are slip sliding away and that is sad."], ["Ieisha E.", "The last time I went was a year ago. It was good. I love they presentation of the food. They really make things fancy. Even chicken and mashed potatoes. The servers were very nice and it was a cozy little place"], ["Brandy P.", "My absolute favorite place to eat when I go to Jackson. \u00a0Great location. \u00a0Beautiful establishment. \u00a0Bar area where you can watch the cooks. \u00a0Great Italian chocolate milk and the salads are great!"], ["Leilane V.", "I absolutely love the vibrant professional atmosphere at Bravo's. \u00a0The food and the service is fantastic and great value for money."], ["L T.", "This was a nice place for lunch, but nothing that knocked my socks off, either. Our antipasto plate had some great marinated red bell peppers and garlic, but no olives, which I thought was a little strange. I also had the four seasons pizza, which was nice.If you're not from the Jackson area, the restaurant can be a little hard to see from the interstate -- I recommend finding Julep, which is easy to spot on the corner of Northside & Frontage, and entering the shopping plaza from that entrance."], ["William O.", "A wonderful locally owned restaurant. & Bar. \u00a0I celebrated my Birthday there in 2013. \u00a0It is a great place to take the family. \u00a0Excellent wine selection. Their pizzas are \"to die for.\""], ["Leila F.", "I have to say this is the best place I have been to in Jackson... so far. If that changes I will edit this review. \u00a0The wine list is decent. The food is really good.I found the service quite professional and friendly. The first time I was there, I have to admit I was skeptical. The place was so large....And so many people...how could they keep up such good quality as reputed? Well they do have great food. Why will I not give it five stars? Because of small inconsistencies that may not be readily apparent unless you go here often. Sometimes you order a dish and it is perfection. The next time, it has something missing... the warmth, or the crispiness, or the sauce has slightly changed. I am very sensitive to these things. And I imagine this has to do with the size of the place. Someone different probably cranked out my favorite dish all three times I ate it. Or it sat for a bit longer. Or it was rushed a bit. \u00a0After that I changed dish and the same thing happened all over again. I am not talking about anything major...it was still delicious. \u00a0 Like I said, I will try a few more places to see if I can find something better...that five star place. But I will probabIy keep coming back here as well. This is a delightful place to eat with fairly high standards across the board. I find it justly priced as well. The owners must be very nice people, which to me is important, because the employees seem happy and seem to enjoy their jobs."], ["Lawrence Z.", "The food and service are mediocre, but let's talk about their selling points:1) Wine -- they have the BEST wine selection I've seen in Jackson, MS. \u00a0Kudos to their sommelier.2) Dessert -- they have the BEST tiramisu I've had in Jackson. \u00a0Their cappuccino is great too."], ["Christopher T.", "Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night I believe it was. The bread that came with the meal was really good! We also ordered this deep fried block of Brie cheese crusted in pecans. It was just not for me though it was good - I am just not a big nut fan, especially pecans so I am a bit bias.For main we had this lemon chicken thing wrapped in some kind of fried shell. Sorry that I cannot be more specific. This wasn't really all that good and I wouldn't order it again.The place kind of sits in a mall..kind of hard to explain. The atmosphere is casual with a mixed crowd. The only disconnect on the decor was from the main dining room to where we were sitting, the bar/lounge area. It felt completely different. It had the appearance of a cruise ship - tacky tacky..like maybe something like Carnival. Nothing classy like Norwegian or Celebrity."], ["Jennifer C.", "Ok food, ok atmosphere, pricey.I prefer amerigo's for italian food. i only come here if everyone else in the group wants to go here for lunch."], ["Ashley G.", "I don't know how everyone doesn't give this place 5 stars. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. It's more upscale than most of the other restaurants in Jackson but not super pricey. If you are looking for a place with a decent wine list in Mississippi (which is hard to come by) Bravo is your stop. The food is also amazing. They menu offers a wide range of selection from pizzas to fish to a variety of pasta selection. Everything is delicious. Whenever I go I always get the tomato basil soup as an appetizer and the tiramisu for dessert. I normally switch up the entree because I always want to try something different. The tiramisu is hands down the best tiramisu I have ever had. I love tiramisu and try it often at other place but this has always been my favorite."], ["Jake D.", "i have only been to bravo for brunch, so i can't remark on their dinner menu. HOWEVER, in terms of brunch, they are awesome. Jackson has a dearth of breakfast places (with bars), and Bravo steps up. \u00a0The service is great, the food is creative (for Jackson), and their drink menu is amazing."], ["Kristin H.", "Dining at Bravo was a last minute choice as the day we travelled to Jackson, the whole town seemed to be closed for the Thanksgiving weekend. \u00a0Needing to eat after a 3 hour drive, a friend suggested we meet at Bravo. \u00a0when we walked in, there was no host to greet us, but a woman who I can only guess was a manager who came to seat us. As she took us to her seat, I saw she had been sitting at the bar eating, and when we sat down, I noticed she was still somewhat chewing. OOO-kayyyy...We sat down and ordered mimosas and bellinis, a must if I am out on a weekend and there is a brunch menu. \u00a0Small for 7 bucks, but I still had 2! \u00a0We all ordered our lunch. \u00a0I got an eggplant napoleon with sun-dried tomato pesto and goat cheese. \u00a0The dish tasted like someone had taken a pre-made one out of the walk-in and put in on the plate. \u00a0It was too cold, and difficult to cut into. \u00a0The flavors were good, but I would rather it had been at least room temperature. \u00a0I started with the tomato soup, which was wonderful. I could have had a few bowls of that and been quite happy. \u00a0The hubs had a BLT club. It was a standard sandwich, nothing to write home about. \u00a0My mother had the crabcakes. These were good, but a crabcake lover like myself, a lot of filler went into these. \u00a0A little less cake and a bit more crab would liven them right up!Service was good, not great. \u00a0He was friendly, but his pacing was off. He tried to take my mothers plate away as she was still eating. \u00a0I always appreciate if a server would ask if I was still enjoying my meal. Then it doesn't sound too hurried and we can all finish our lunch at our pace. \u00a0If I go back to Jackson, I most likely will not be dining here. There were many other places I wanted to go but were closed on a Saturday afternoon for Thanksgiving weekend. By far the most bizarre excuse I had ever heard!! \u00a0Jackson as a whole was a disappointment. Maybe it was the food."], ["Baron M.", "Another great place from Mangia Bene. They have three of the tastiest places in town, plus they give back to the community (maybe that is why it costs just a bit more vs the competition ha). Bravo is no exception. Every time we have come, they have had a professional staff with great food. Sometimes they run some neat specials (like the wine bottle special they are running right now, which we are planning on trying out this Friday) from time to time and it seems that you can get an early bird discount (last time I checked) for dinning in early."], ["Beth P.", "When I have folks in from out of town, this is the first place we go! \u00a0Plus excellent Sunday brunch time, try the breakfast pizza."], ["Skip R.", "One of the best restaurants in Jackson. They don't take reservations, so you will have a wait most times you go there. They are busy, so you won't get the fastest service either. But they are busy because it is very good food. I would rather wait for a great meal rather than get a poor meal in record time. Slow down and enjoy the experience. They use super fresh ingredients and that shines in the quality of the food. I can vouch that the sweep potato fries with cinnamon apricot yogurt dipping sauce and the pecan crusted fried brie with dried cherry marmalade are outstanding. My favorite salad resides there in the Bravo field greens salad with citrus dressing. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose off the entree menu. I have had several pastas including the chicken mushroom with penne pasta. It is really outstanding. The best entree I have had at BRAVO is the pork chop zatarainaise. It's a perfectly cooked pork chop with a creole mustard cream sauce that will knock your socks off. \u00a0Be sure to save room for the banana creme brule for dessert. It is unrivaled IMO."], ["S H.", "This place blows. It's hard to serve decent food when the ingredients are of such crap quality- 23 dollars for crab cakes that's not lump crab meat is a scam. Also the servers seem unprofessional. Not going back!"], ["Dee K.", "I have been to this place at least 100 times and am ready to go 1000 more. Food is great, ambiance is classy and romantic. Some tables are a bit too close but then again it's a small place. Appetizers are big to a level where if I am not too hungry I can manage with soup and appetizer and not miss the main course. Keep in mind I am a girl and don't eat too much. Wine list is extensive and bread pudding is out of this world. Cream brulle is another of my favorite here. Cajun pasta with andouille sausage, salmon pizza are some of my favorites there. They have a great pizza oven and most of the pizza choices are great. Love it for food, drinks and classy deserts."], ["Brian K.", "I once loved this place....but that has changed. The service was once A+ but it is no longer that. The last 3 times I visited this place I have had to \u00a0repeat myself over and over because my waiter or waitress can't seem to get it together. The last time I visited after I was seated it took the waitress 20 minutes to come greet my party during brunch. The kitchen is good, the food comes quick, it is usually good, but the service needs to step it up. This was once my favorite place to dine, but its not what it once was."], ["Sonia C.", "Good food, but over-rated. We ate here a few times when my husband was in medical school. It's a nice place with good food and decent service, but it doesn't live up to its reputation. \u00a0They do have some interesting dishes, like fried polenta and they have some nice salads. The pizza Margherita is good, and I'd order it again. They also have a vegetarian plate, which is appreciated. If you decide to go, \u00a0have realistic expectations - good, but not great."], ["Gregory G.", "This is a Jackson Mississippi hidden jewel and I am going to uncover it for you. First let me say this place has a great atmosphere with lots of energy. The servers at Bravo I would have to say are the best. \u00a0And the food is \"A\" rated. I have eaten at some really great italian restaurants in Chicago, this one should be relocated to the \"Windy City\", but then you would miss out on the Mississippi warm and friendly hospitality you receive when entering the door. Their menu is extensive and if you don't find anything mouth watering on their Wine list, you won't find it in Jackson. So if you are visiting Jackson Mississippi and looking for a really great place to eat, Bravo should be on your list. Now it can become crowded during normal dinner times, but wait until 7:30pm and you should be fine. Enjoy!!!!!!!"], ["Tony S.", "Great food, but the service, while adequate, was slow. We tried the glazed chicken, the fried oyster salad, crab cakes, pork chops, and a salad with goat cheese. Everyone was VERY pleased with the meal, but we waited way too long for simple things like a glass of water and some lemon wedges. Also, the host was really unhelpful, unprofessional, and had us wait almost twice as long as his previously estimated wait time (50 minutes). Thankfully, there's a lounge and a bar. So, definitely check it out, but make reservations."], ["Brett S.", "Way over priced for a very mediocre restaurant! The previous night we ate at Amerigo's which had top notch waiters and delicious food.

I should have taken this as foreshadowing, but I was still optimistic.I was really looking forward to it because fungi are the best. The base was garlic and olive oil. I avoided the garlic the first time because it gives me heartburn. Should have listened to myself. Mushrooms and truffles are some of the greatest things in life, but not minced garlic. You know the kind that comes in a jar that your grandma keeps in her fridge for two decades? That stuff. The smell, taste, and texture of pre-minced garlic is death in a jar.Not only that, but I wasn't crazy about the crust. It was so dense and weighted me down. The Daiya cheese didn't do me any favours either. I normally love the stuff and put it on everything, but it became a white goopy mess. Never again.

It was swimming in clarified butter and seasoning and not in the shell. I've had better. My recommendation, ease off on the butter and seasoning. I could barely taste the escargots through the lemon butter flavor. Okay so there's a picture from a while ago on here if the escargot, I'm assuming that is what mine should've looked like, but there was so much fat in the bowl you couldn't see the snails or the holes holding them.The fried oysters on the other hand were light and rich with the cheese, however the spinach needed some salt. For my entree I had the Crawfish crepe with \"vegetables.\" My pet peeve is going to a place and ordering something with \"vegetables\" and they only give me one vegetable. I only had broccoli with my crepe. I recommend changing the description on the menu or actually using more veggies.The crepe was to die for. It was filled with two kinds of cheeses and topped with the sauce and crawfish, tomatoes and sausage and mushrooms. It wasn't the prettiest plate, but the flavor makeup for it.

The atmosphere makes it seem like a much better restaurant than it really is. The tea isn't even that good.The food is nominally French. I have not had anything that stands out, so no need to go over it. Even the dessert is generally flavorless. Their catering is very poor. Do not get too excited about going to an event there. Most recently I had some sort of fried chicken on top of some mediocre mashed potatoes. It was edible, but the catering is definitely 1-2 stars.I notice in the sidebar that one review says that it is in a good location. This is false. It is in ridgeland behind the Township development. This is currently a massive construction site. It is reasonably easy to get to if you are already in Ridgeland on the correct side of the interstate, but otherwise, it is fairly out of the way.

It will not disappoint!"], ["Emily I.", "Great neighborhood place to grab a drink and run into friends. \u00a0Most of the bartenders are longtermers, and can make a perfect cocktail/shot or just pour a nice beer. \u00a0Pretty decent live music on the weekends, and now that its non-smoking, the crowded atmosphere is not nearly as lethal. \u00a0A classic Belhaven establishment that is always a sure thing."], ["Dena S.", "Great little bar/restaurant that is non-smoking (maybe I should give it a 5 just for that!) We had Spicy Drummers, which are spicy battered fried chicken wings. They are listed as an appetizer but came with standard steak fries, carrots, celery and blue cheese. I thought the wings were decent sized and the batter didn't bother me much, as it was very light. They were very flavorful and served very temperature hot - but not all that spicy. We also had Shepards Pie, which was excellent but kind of a small portion. \u00a0It was also served very temperature hot. In any event, we felt the quality of the food was high, and we're looking forward to returning to Fenian's."], ["Joel M.", "Surprise, surprise, Jackson doesn't have a nightlife. But wait, an Irish Pub! That must be good. Nope. If you want to eat low quality food prepared hastily and with 12lbs of salt per serving, this is your place. Gentlemen, Ireland is about 4000 miles northeast. Give it a visit. It will only help us all. If your not hungry and just want a Guinness, stop by the ATM first because they are $6.50. Staff was very nice and plenty of parking."], ["Shawn L.", "Good food. Great atmosphere. Great music. I love the train set!"], ["Jean W.", "Great Food. Cool atmosphere.

The food never disappoints and there is so much variety that you're ought to find something for you!I, personally, get the fish sandwich with blackened salmon. You'd think a place called \"Majestic BURGER\" would only be experts in burgers, but actually they're experts towards EVERYTHING. My salmon is always so moist and full of flavor! Not only do we come for the food, but the lovely atmosphere and staff. The waitors/servers are ALWAYS so kind & welcoming. I want to specifically mention a lovely young man that goes by, CW. He ALWAYS takes us under his wing when we enter, he knows our order by heart, we have lovely conversations, and he calls us \"his two favorite girls.\" (as my mother and I come a lot) We love and adore him so much, and he makes our lunch or dinner much more wonderful!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MAJESTIC BURGER."], ["Emily S.", "Not sure if this place closes at 9:30 like Google says or 10:00 like it has on Yelp... But when we came in there at 8:45 we could tell our business would not be appreciated. Almost all of the workers gave us dirty looks and once we placed our order my friend heard the cook complain about how it was 8:45. So we decided to cancel our order and leave. We have been here plenty of times before and had good experiences until now. Won't be returning for awhileMr. Sandifer,It was Thursday Oct 1 @ 8:35 pm when we came in the restaurant."], ["Jonna B.", "I thought the atmosphere was really cool, but that's not what I came for. I came for a majestic burger, and that is what I did not receive. The waitstaff was a little on the rude side, and I could see them making fun of customers. Their burgers were far past well done and my husband's bun was hard as rock. They did bring him a new bun, but it wasn't much better. The only saving grace was the onion rings. They were delicious. I probably won't return, at least not for quite some time."], ["Hal R.", "My wife and I really enjoyed this place. We essentially got the same thing by building our own. Both of ours consisted of a fried egg, bacon, and a sourdough bun. The buns can be huge so be weary if you don't want a face full of bread. The friend egg and bacon combo is definitely the way to go. We also had an app of fried pickles. Apparently there is a \"half order\" that doesn't show on the menu. If there is less than four of you, go for that. You'll end up with a pound of leftovers. The staff was friendly and helpful. It looked as if they needed some help though. I'll be happy to make a return trip."], ["Philip D.", "Ordered a burger and fries to go. Was staying at Springhill Suites. Hands down the worst prepared French fries. Soggy and limp. I would recommend cooking a little longer. Burger was ok."], ["Leslie W.", "Wow. This experience was so not what I expected to be. What I expected was ordering a delicious burger at a counter and having a seat. First, you are seated. My first question to my friendly waitress was if they make their veggie burgers. Apparently, they don't make any of them. The patties are ordered. Bummer. I decided to go with the turkey mushroom swiss with a side of the Greek seasoned fries. I think the best part was the bun. While I did like the Greek seasoning, the fries weren't great. Both the burger and the fries were underwhelming for $13. My friend got redfish tacos. While the strips of redfish were a nice size, it's unfortunate that even the more entreeish options don't come with a side. I don't feel moved to go back. There are several better burger and casual dining options in the area. The quality of the food is not in line with the price point. I do want to give my waitress credit for being really nice. It's a cool atmosphere."], ["Cris W.", "As a resident of Cordova, TN, we have access to a great many offerings of burger in the Memphis area. That said, we tend to be burger snobs. This is the only reason I'm granting Majestic 3 stars instead of 4.While the meat on Majestic's burger is 'pretty good', it's as good as most places - average. However, the bright spot about their burger is the BREAD. The sweet sourdough is absolutely fantastic! And, IMHO, the bread makes the sandwich. Any ole subpar meat would have been good in Majestic's sourdough. If we were local, I'd be identifying their bread source to buy it myself. If Majestic would invest in top quality beef and charge a bit more for the sandwich, their offerings would be phenomenal.We had the fried portobello and pickles for appetizers. Both were great. Not too salty as is the case with pickles, generally.Service was friendly & prompt.We will return, but not for the meat. It will be for the bread."], ["Elizabeth G.", "Bad service, good food! The food keeps me coming back, but the service disappoints me every time. If they covered their bases, the restaurant would be a knock-out! (Managers, are you listening?)The fried portobello bites are tasty and served with an onion-blossom type sauce to dip them in. The burgers are great, but be careful about the bread. I got the wheat bread and it all fell apart on me. I tried the sweet sourdough and it's similar to Hawaiian bread. This last time I got the new york chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese, bacon, and avocado with a side of sweet potato fries. YUM!"], ["Rabun J.", "I eat here pretty regularly for lunch and it is always good. You have to get the sweet potato fries!"], ["George H W.", "Really disappointed with the fare tonight. Treated guests to a meal and the only thing majestic tonight was the ticket. The fish taco shells were hard and cold. The blackened red fish was hard and dry. Seemed like the ranch dressing was watered down. In summation I was sorely disappointed. Not up to the standards which Majestic Burgers had cultivated on previous trip. Don't know if there has been a change in management or the staff was just tired after a long day, but Majestic will not be on my short list for casual dining anytime soon. Oh and I \u00a0might add that the Burger was considerably less than majestic."], ["Tho,as E.", "Bad experience tonight at a restaurant I usually enjoy. Ordered take out and brought home a burned and inedible mahi sandwich. It's a $12 sandwich so I called and returned for a replacement. There was no apology, no offer of a refund or some other comp that most any restaurant would offer to someone inconvenienced enough to return takeout. I showed it to the manager because it really was ridiculous that the first sandwich was allowed to leave the kitchen. He offered some lame excuse about the seasoning causing it to burn on the outside which doesn't explain why it was over cooked to the point that it was gray and completely dry. And certainly doesn't explain why they went ahead and served it to me anyway. The excuse for the extremely small size of the filet was that their supplier sent it to them that way. Still no word on why they served it. When they get it right the place is good, but consistency is lacking as is the ability to make it right for an unhappy customer. \u00a0A burger place can't get by on a really good bun. It matters what's in the middle."], ["Peter C.", "Very mediocre! Slow service and poor food. Overly battered fried mushrooms. Mini-burgers were covered in a too sweet mayonnaise. I will not go back."], ["Nolen G.", "We have been enjoying Majestic Burger on Sundays for lunch after church. \u00a0We have a pretty large group so I have been able to sample lots of different items on the menu lately.I am putting together at top sammich list in Jackson and the blackened red fish was recommended by a friend who knows their stuff.I grabbed one and wrapped it in the famous Majestic Burger sweet-dough bun and added a side of sweet potato fries. \u00a0I had my Redfish blackened for the sandwich and had it dress like they recommend. \u00a0The fish was perfect and the bread was awesome. \u00a0I really like this bun. \u00a0That said, next time I order it, I am going to get the wheat bun. \u00a0It is the same size and shape with a sweet flavor, but I like the texture better and I think it will compliment the fish better.Other big positives around the table for the Cobb Salad.....my Dad says it is the best in town and he eats a lot of salads. \u00a0My wife loved her burger with Wheat bun and jalapenos. \u00a0I had a 1/4 of it and I agree, it was cooked right and very tasty.Lastly, the location and service are great. I love the small bar and the decor. \u00a0Nicely done."], ["Matthew H.", "My dining companion was extremely happy with the portabello sandwich (on sweet sourdough). I had the blue cheese burger (which was a bit small). Our two sides were the fries (ample portion) and onion rings (stingy portion). Overall, it was a positive experience, and I'd recommend Majestic over your local Five Guys.One note for those who like it bloody, they only serve their burgers one temp, medium well."], ["Kayla R.", "Food is ok. Fried pickles are great. Make sure to get your burger on sweet sourdough. Really good. Only complaint: they need more help. Three times. Slow service (on non peak times) every time. Get it together, guys. Sad because the food isn't bad."], ["Gary S.", "Poor service. Had to ask to get order taken and then had to ask for the drinks we ordered. When we got the drinks at least 2 of them were wrong. Cannot recommend this restaurant"], ["Braxton B.", "Food was good, hot made fresh. Service is quick and attentive. Expo is in the dining area so food is delivered fast and accurate. Business is steady during peak lunch and dinner hours. No Veterans Day Specials of any type, kinda strange for a burgers and bar joint, but c'est la vie. Large TVs give a sports bar feel, but it is more of a grill than bar. Portions are healthly, but not too much. Food tastes fresh. I come here often for lunch during the work day."], ["David B.", "When you're at a place called Majestic Burger, how are you not going to order the Majestic Burger?So that's exactly what I did. Making certain my burger would be as majestic as possible, I took the waitresses's recommendation on their most popular bun, the sweet sourdough.The sweet sourdough bun was soft and tasty with just the right hint of sweetness. The burger pattie tasted like good meat and the comeback sauce did not disappoint. I also enjoyed my side of sweet potato fries, which were sliced long and thin. Solid meal overall."], ["Chris G.", "If you've never been to Majestic Burger, then you don't know what you're missing. Go try the Portobello bites -- they're SO GOOD! Had I known how good they were going to be, I wouldn't have even bothered to order a burger!"], ["Anthony T.", "I'm going to start with how good my burger was and how close it was to my hotel. Those two thing are worth 5 stars but service is worth -5 stars; yes the rating system need to change. The young lady was working really hard but she need help, they had 3 hostess just sitting folks will people are waiting to order is one problem. I ordered ketchup three times before I didn't get it and yes I ate the worst fries on the world without ketchup. Yes, I was tired and hungry and didn't want to go anywhere else except sleep. This place was packed and will continue to do well until they have some competition or until people demand better service and I going to start by not visiting them again. That's really said because the burger was really good and Ashley was really working hard. She needed some help; so I guess management chose $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ over customer service."], ["Kristen M.", "I was very disappointed with the service at majestic burger. The manager (Ashley Lewis) was incredibly rude. We simply asked to change a television channel and were told very aggressively that it was impossible and that's just the way it is.

We both thought our waiter looked like a cool dude and would be good, but after our initial introduction it all went down hill! We both ordered a Make-Your- Own Burger, I ordered mine with avocado and an egg. After a couple of bites I noticed I did not have the egg, so after waiting about 5 minutes for our waiter to come back by I pointed it out to him, he took my whole plate (actually a basket) to the back and a couple of minutes later emerged with the exact same burger (complete with the bites missing) with an egg added to it! \u00a0To me, this was just adding insult to injury! I understand not wasting food, but its kind of disgusting to think what may or may not have been done to that burger in transport, Kind of like watching you food be delivered to the wrong table and then the pick it up and bring it to you! Another thing we noticed was that the Waiters and Waitresses would stand back in the corner, by the drink machine, and just congregate, laughing and messing around! It is just unprofessional to do this out in the open in full view of everyone eating here, not to mention when we needed our waiter, he was hanging out here and not paying an attention to us! I also believe the burgers are slightly over-priced for what you get, they are really good burgers and I'll maybe be back but just a little over what they should be priced at, the additions that you can add to a burger should also be a little less, if I got a burger the way I really wanted it would cost me about $20 for 1 burger!!!"], ["Megs M.", "This food was delicious. But the service was HORRIBLE. We had a few(6 burgers) togo orders from our office. From start to finish the service was rude and offensive. Not only was I told several times over the phone that \"I would just have to hold\" BEFORE even taking my order, but on several occasions I, the co-worker who picked it up, and the co-worker who called regarding the item left off were spoken to as though we were inconveniencing her(Ashley). We later discovered that she is actually the manager. Usually we allow for the fact that we are calling in a LUNCH order. However, when my co-worker arrived the restaurant had barely anyone in it. She then waited on the food for at least ten minutes and the entire time it was sitting behind the counter. When she approached Ashley to get the orders, she was again told that she would \"just have to wait\". When something was left off of our order we were told they don't do refunds. Our Business will NOT be ordering from them again, small or \"large\" orders. They have lost us as customers."], ["Baron M.", "I stopped here to grab some take out on the way back home since the location nearest me is closed on Sundays.

I can't really rate them on their restaurant, but just sitting there for the few minutes I did, I found it to be very clean, with a friendly staff, and it appears to have a full bar!"]]}
