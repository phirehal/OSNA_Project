On the bright side, there was boba milk tea!"], ["Annie B.", "I was so happy to find this place, having just moved to Mississippi from D.C.The store has a fairly extensive selection of Asian veggies (e.g. yagaimo, burdock, greens, daikon, etc.). I haven't purchased any of their produce yet because the main purpose of my trip was stocking up on sauces and condiments. I was particularly excited to buy all of the sauces here because they are certainly cheaper than anything you might attempt at a regular grocery store (although not as cheap as my trusty Asian market in D.C.). I bought:-miso-mirin-soba noodles (they had a very extensive noodle selection)-rice wine (for cooking)-toasted sesame pil-pickled ginger-oyster sauce-hoisin sauce-chili basil sauce (for pad thai and drunken noodles)-black bean chili sauce-nori (they had an extensive selection)-kimchi-toasted black sesame seeds-frozen vegetable gyoza-frozen scallion pancakesAfter making all of my purchases, I got lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered Mapo Tofu and stir fried green beans (I requested no meat on both). They were both delicious and I was thrilled to get authentic tasting Chinese food in MS!"], ["Ieisha E.", "My husband brought me on a mini field trip (as he called it) to this place 2 years ago. I was very shocked at how different it looked inside due to the fact that I had visited numerous times during my childhood when it was chuck e cheeses. First impression when I walked through the door was EW it stinks so bad in here. I looked over and people were sitting and having meals while inhaling the funk, so the food must be really good. But aside from that, this place was beyond interesting. It was like a whole new world inside. It was amazing to see all of those foreign fruits and vegetables that they have as well as everything else. As you can tell I had never set foot in any type of Asian market before. I saw live crabs and fish everywhere. The only purchase that I made was bags of Asian candy. It was delish. I would like to visit again and try new different things."], ["Newly P.", "I was very excited about trying out this grocery store plus restaurant, but I came back with mixed feelings.-First, I don't think the restaurant area stinks, like some reviewers pointed out. -Second, they do offer chopsticks to non-Asians. You just gotta ask for it. If you don't want to ask, you can go pick it up at the entrance of the restaurant. There are plenty of chopsticks stocked there in plain sight.-I ordered the \"crizy\" spicy chicken, which BTW has been spelled correctly in the new versions of the menu, and I thought it was too dry to be eaten with rice. I really wish I had known this before I ordered it. The chicken had been chopped up into tiny peanut sized pieces and I could mostly taste the cornflower on the deep fried chicken bits. It was pretty much like trying to eat fried chicken with rice. Tooo dry! I added some soy sauce, but it didn't help things too much.-The cashew chicken was OK. Though they were really stingy with the cashew. A few more veggies in that chicken dish would have made me happier. And spring onions don't count as veggies in my book!-Overall, we left feeling we had ordered the wrong items. Maybe we should have looked at the pics on the wall and chosen something from there. I did see a couple diners walk with their server to the \"picture wall\" and choose dishes from there, so it's not a completely crazy idea!On an earlier occasion I had bought some items from the grocery area. I found the shelves neatly stacked, the aisles were labeled and numbered, which is a rarity, and all or most items had price tags on them. This last point is also a rarity with several ethnic grocery stores. They are pretty much a one stop shop for all items Asian. About the restaurant though, I maintain my mixed feelings."], ["Duan C.", "First and foremost, you just dont know how amped I am for being the first one to review this place!!!

Lol!!Anyway, its a grocery store/restaurant specializing in ethnic authentic chinese cuisine and by far, its authentic simply by the seasoning and items you see on the menu - seaweed, pork intestine, tripe, lobster, conch, roast duck, salted duck, seafood hot & sour soup, its and expansive list, but guess what my goal is to give dang near everything a try as long as their open for business!The prices are so/so, their not expensive like PF Chang, but their potions are not great on to-go orders, but the people I've seen eat there were loaded down with grub.The ladies that ring you up are pretty nice and real sweet. I've tried the shredded curry chicken, taiwanese rice noodles, beef broccoli, seafood hot & sour soup and their regular egg rolls.Been their two times in the last couple of weeks and I will probably be back in a few days to try something else.

I love the more authentic Asian places and was excited to find this place on Yelp. Unfortunately it didn't deliver. As some other reviews have stated it smelled bad due to the grocery and restaurant being combined. It wasn't a big deal and not that unusual with similar places due to the live crab, lobster tanks. As for the food, what we had wasn't very good. I will skip this place and stay with Keifers,etc. when passing through Jackson.

Aside from this fact, the market is really small. It doesn't seem very clean, and I question how long some products have been stored there (make sure to check expiration dates). I was also shocked by how much they charged! However, I understand that this is because it is the only market carrying Asian food in town. I only go here if I absolutely need a specific ingredient that only they carry.

Luckily, there are places that swim against the current and put out great food at a reasonable price without the need for the \"All you can fit in your belly while wearing sweat pants\" sign out front.Topping this list is Mr. Chen's Oriental Supermarket and Restaurant. Then menu is extensive and authentic. You can stick with basics like spring rolls and lo mein, or you can take a walk on the Zimmer side and try out exotic fare such as Basil Pig's Feet or Crispy Intestine. We usually opt for a little of both.This review is not a recounting of one or two recent meals, but a ringing endorsement from a chef and a food writer who counts this eatery as one of the best in the city. How can I put this more plainly...Put down the shovel, step away from the buffet line and go directly to Mr. Chen's. When you walk in the door, glance to your left and pick one of the specials from the dry erase board and get it alongside whatever your favorite oriental dish may happen to be. You will swear off the gut-busters forever.Bon Appetit! - Tom"], ["PG A.", "Came for the best soup dumplings in Jackson, and they are awesome."], ["Baron M.", "It is great to have a local option for a non buffet, Chinese restaurant! The smell, when you walk in, can be a little over powering (coming from the fish market part of the supermarket, I do believe), but it goes away pretty fast. The food is great and the staff is nice. The lunch menu is filling and well priced, but the regular menu is where you can find some real gems.

Why wasn't this open when I lived in Jackson 3 years ago? My mouth cried tears of joy, I swear. Mom is Taiwanese and was excited to let me try the Taiwanese specialties on offer at Mr. Chen's. We had the fried radish cakes, 3 Cups Chicken (I believe it's \"Taiwanese stewed chicken\" on the menu) and the pork and squid stir-fry with chili black bean paste. All of it was phenomenal, although Mom thought the pork and squid dish was too spicy for her taste. I had to pinch myself a couple of times to make sure I was really in Mississippi. If I still lived in Jackson, I'd be here every week and they'd know me by name. My only gripe is that I asked for kong shin cai (water spinach) in the restaurant and they wouldn't make it for us. It wasn't on the menu, but I saw some on the produce side of the market...sad because I really wanted to eat it that night. The supermarket part is pretty darn impressive too. When I was a kid there was one Asian market in Jackson, a small, dimly lit store in a sketchy location on Terry Road. When I lived in Jackson, I would go to an Asian market in Ridgeland which was better. But this market is definitely a cut above. There are bright lights! Prices are marked! There's produce!

We weren't quite sure what to order because we wanted something different. Our waitress recommended 4 things: the shrimp and pineapple, kung pow combo, black bean combo, and the Chen's crispy chicken. It was all so good. We each had little left over to take home.

A ton of tofu with a very flavorful sauce. Maybe there could have been some more broccoli, but no real complaints otherwise.If you haven't been here before, I recommend checking out China Express.

The chicken was dark meat chicken with some connective tissue which was not to my taste but the potato was so fabulous and the sauce to die for that I will get just the veggies and no meat and dump my rice in it and eat the sauce up!The second dish was supposed to be shared but the garlic sauce was a bit spicier than expected. It was a nice white meat chicken with some bell peppers, mushrooms, carrots & spicy red pepper flakes. You get a free thing of water with your order.As these other guys explained there was a steady crowd of Asian students enjoying the TV in the corner.

I came here with a couple of friends to check this place out. This place was in a nicer area in Flowood with blocks and blocks of shops. Basically, if you wanted to get shopping done, this is the place to be. So the location was convenient.. although it was a ways from school. The place i remember was cheap (compared to prices in CA) i think for dinner it was only $18.. of course for MS prices this is pretty steep (OMG their $5 KFC buffet, but i digress). They had a variety of chinese and japanese food.. along with the MS staple; crawfish and catfish and oysters fried battered or raw. But I didn't come here for all that, i came here for the sashimi and sushi and I was amazed. The salmon was extra fatty and delicious. Although you have to kind of pester the sushi chefs into cutting up pieces for you. I had to let the chef know 3 times that I was waiting on salmon and he must've cut up maybe 4 slices. I had to keep going back and asking for more which was a big ass pain but other than that, the quality of the fish was superb. There was great marbling in the fish with lots of fish oil drizzling down the sushi. They also had raw oysters which I absolutely love. But yeah yadda yadda the food is good... but The best part of this buffet hands down is the ice cream. BLUE BELL BIRTHDAY CAKE ICE CREAM!!!!!!!! OMG where the hell have you been all my life?! Ever since I ate that I been searching far and wide at every Krogers I could to find it but I was never able to see it again... now that im back in CA, i'll never be able to eat you again.. how i long for you... *sniff sniff*I've been here quite a few times and i absolutely love it. It's a little part of CA that I'm able to experience.. and the ice cream! holy bananas on a stick that is ah-may-jing! Definitely a good place to eat, but even more worth it for the ice cream. i miss you my blue bell birthday cake. sniff snifffff**"], ["Psonya H.", "For the first couple times, it's impressive. \u00a0After that, it's kinda just the place you go for variety. \u00a0This is really a mixture of Chinese and American food, but on a \"super\" buffet. \u00a0I don't care for sushi, and they no longer have crab legs on the buffet on weekdays, only Friday - Sunday at dinner. \u00a0If you don't do crab legs or sushi, it's a little pricey. \u00a0However, on week days you can order a \"side\" of crab legs for an additional price.

In pretty much any city, 5-15 bucks PER ROLL is normal. Say you want 2 rolls and some sashimi and miso soup. Easily a 30 dollar meal. Easily.

I have been here a good 20-30 times. I LOVE it. Every time I visit Jackson, my friends know that we are going here for lunch one day. $11 for all the fresh sushi, sashimi, seaweed salad, miso soup you could possibly eat. There is one roll that has peanut butter that I don't like. But hey, it's a buffet, so I can try them all and see what is my fave and then eat until full without adding the bill in my head, justifying an expensive lunch by taking away drinks at the bar that weekend. Oh yeah, they have good Chinese too, but what can I say I rarely touch it - there is sushi on the other end! Their salmon sashimi is probably my fave, and it has been fresh every time I've gone. They even have an ice cream station. And ice cream happens to be one of my favorite desserts. But I hardly ever get it here. Yup, I am that typical gluttonous buffet goer at this place.

The beef was lean and the soup was hot and flavorful. I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come back to try the Basil Tasty. Wish this place would have boba :)"], ["Rose K.", "I absolutely loved the beef and broccoli and sesame chicken. Most Chinese places serve beef like rubber, but it was not the case here. The meat was tender, the broccoli crisp and the sauce savory. The sesame chicken was also tender with little fat. The egg roll was spiced well and tasted pretty good. The only item that lacked was the cream cheese wonton. The cream cheese was a little too sour. Other than that, the food was delectable. I will definitely be back."], ["Joe H.", "Very good food! Friendly and fast service. Simple cafe decor, nothing fancy, but the appetizers, soups, fried rice and main dishes are all good.

I called in my order 3 of those 4 times and everything was perfect. But the last 2 times when I called my order in it was wrong when I got there to pick it up. I had to wait 15 minutes on both of those visits and she was unapologetic. I noticed that the first few times a older gentleman answered the phone, now a younger female answers it.

You can not miss this restaurant with their bright flashy lights lining their windows. With such a grand entrance, we just knew the food had to be majestic.

I will say, their fried rice was a bit questionable and abnormally yellow. Definitely not the best I've had but their food makes up for it.

But they are the same guys that ran Best Wok, so the food is pretty good, because usually Best Wok wins Chinese restaurant of the year award, every year from the Jackson Free Press. But I like the Mongolian Beef, the Singapore Chow Mei Fun and my fiance loves their Buffalo Wings (The lemon pepper). Their Buffalo Wings are breaded, so its whether you like breaded or the original, if you want to be choicy. Albeit they are breaded they usually have a decent sauce and they have 16 different sauces for the chicken wings. They are open late on Fridays and Saturdays, so that is a definite plus to me, because with this being Jackson, most of your mom and pop locations close by 10:30pm even on Friday and Saturday. About a mile and a half from Interstate 55 and a few minutes from downtown Jackson, right off Meadowbrook in the Fondren area, so its a diverse crowd that comes through. Strictly take out, but they do have a couple of tables if you are headed to the bars or clubs downtown and want to coat you stomach with some cheap grub. Give'em a try and see for yourself, really can't go wrong with this place."]], "Fortune Restaurant & Asian Market": [["Dwight K.", "The most delicious pork belly I've ever had.

They wanted to ensure that the dish would be delicious and that the broccoli would not interfere with the flavor of the dish. No problems here, they made sure that this was a wonderful culinary experience."], ["Tiffany N.", "If I did this four months ago it'd be five stars hands down. Warning: LONG but thorough review below!Why three stars? Recently the prices have gone up. Not just a few cents...literally a dollar and up, effective in like March or April. I found this to be a bit random and unappealing to my wallet lol. I think, why would I pay 11 dollars for a meal when I can get the same meal three miles away at Mr. Chen's for 9? The prices are not competitive at all. The food is still good, but some of the dishes like the Kung Pao aren't worth the price. I do absolutely love the General Tso's chicken, curry chicken, the spring rolls, and their hot and sour soup. Very delicious! I'm interested to try more dishes but, once again, those prices thoooo. Also, the service. It all depends on who helps you. There's a nice guy that's there sometimes and then there's other people who are kind of rude. The last time I went to pick up a to-go order, I wasn't greeted by the girl checking me out, she seemed like she didn't want to be bothered, I didn't get a thank you (even though I said thank you) or a you're welcome. Nothing. I just spent $11 on some chicken and rice dude. I'm not a person who feels entitled. I say thank you whenever I go and eat somewhere regardless, but the rudeness did take me back a bit. Not cool. A little kindness and customer service goes a long way. Big turn off. One more thing, I bought some refrigerated jackfruit in a container from here. I was super excited about it since Ive never tried it before and heard great things. I get home and taste it and omg it was crazy crunchy and it smelled like ass. Lol. It doesn't look like it's bad. I'm honestly researching if it's still edible because I hate wasting money. Maybe it can be smoothied? Hmmm lol is it worth it? We'll see! Oh, more bad service from the market cashier. Said nothing the whole time. Except the price; does that count? LolI'm honestly not trying to rag on this place. I'm just saying that, compared to the first few months of it opening (which is still quite recent) everything was much better in terms of prices and service. I will probably be back for the soup and maybe the curry, but everything else is just not worth it to me for the price. Maybe if other aspects were good, I'd overlook the prices like I do other restaurants but nah I'm going to move on. I don't want to discourage you from trying this place out. There are a lot of great things about it. If you can afford to, try it out! Also, I think they have a lunch menu that could accommodate more budgets. I'm not sure TBH. The store inside has many yummy and affordable items from Asia. They have interesting things to buy and fresh seafood. They also have a small selection of produce including big mangoes--YUM. But, if you're getting fruit out of the refrigerator, ask if it's ok to open the container and check it out. If it smells like ass, you must pass. But, yeah, that's why I have it three stars.

Outside of NYC, I've never had chicken feet and duck feet that were better. So put away any preconceived notions you might have arising from the unfortunate name choice and give Ding How a try.

The lunches are smaller portions, but pretty cheap, so it's a good way to try the menu out (order 2 of 'em at a time). On Sat & Sundays native asians come in for the dim sum brunch/lunch (which is always a good sign of authenticity). If you like Dim Sum they are getting pretty nice crowds on the weekends. They roll the carts table to table, show you the dishes and you take it if you want. They have large 7-8 person round tables with lazy suzans to go family style on your dishes, which is like your own family buffet really. Everybody gets a little of each dish they want. \u00a0All the food is very fresh and healthy tasting. No MSG, low oil, not even any Soy Sauce on the table. If you ask for Soy Sauce they'll bring you the low sodium kind. They are aiming for healthier, fresher Chinese.The Bourbon chicken is not bad for dark meat. The Kung Po & Hot Pepper Chicken is decent too. Good tempura. One of the best things I've had is the Lemon Chicken and I don't use the lemon sauce that comes on the side but ask for one of their 58 sauces. They offer an \"8 fruit sauce\" which is a yogurt-ry sauce made from 8 fruits. Your choice of soups are \"Spicy\" or \"Not-Spicy\". Rather than just chinese they have a few dishes from Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Korea & Singapore. It's not a true \"Asian Fusion\" place like Pan Asia tries to be, but they have fresh options worth exploring."], ["Big C.", "The dim sum is exciting, especially the chance to eat chicken feet, which I don't think you can do anywhere else in Jackson.

Since then, it's only improved as inventory has grown and the restaurant has been renovated. First off: I LOVE the lazy susan tables that encourage family style dining for groups. This lets everyone try each dish without being unsanitary, and each diner still has their own plate to eat from.Service: Always great, even during busy hours. I've always been seated promptly (even our large groups at the lazy susan tables) and had our orders taken in a timely manner. Dishes come out hot and drinks get plentiful refills.As to the food - I've tried MANY of their dishes and haven't had a bad pick yet. The seafood is often fresh from their tanks in the back - whole stone fish steamed in aromatic herbs has been hands down one of the best specials I've tried.The sauteed sweetpea leaves are a vegetable side that our table always gets.As to their regular dishes, I'd recommend several. The Crazy Chicken, a house special, is small fried chicken and tofu pieces with a little pepper kick. The Mapo Tofu dish is always well seasoned and warm. And their hot pot plates are all good. I personally love the pork and basil hot pot but continue to try them all.Even their regular items that you'll find at any Chinese takeout in town - sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab rangoon, etc - are on point.Sometimes jellyfish, conch, and other delicacies are available.

I think you are mistaking \"best\" for \"ONLY.\" It was my first Friday here in Jackson after a long time away from home, and I decided to treat myself out to lunch. I wanted Asian food because I missed home (basically, I missed rice). I looked up on Yelp! that Mr. Chen's was good and decide to make the trip up from Downtown.I have been to the grocery store before, but this was my first time noticing that there is a restaurant right next door. The people spoke some sort of Chinese (I believe Taiwanese) so I was getting super excited to be in the same room as people who look like me. They handed me a menu and for lunch it was cheap- an entree with a side and egg roll, so I ordered Sesame Chicken. Yum! I even ordered myself a milk tea while I was at it because I was going to savor all of the Asian as I can possibly get before I leave. The milk tea was the first to arrive and it was... bland. There was an odd powdery texture that I wasn't a fan of and I've had bubble tea from places made of power before so I forgave them for that. But my milk tea was warm and there was no ice in there, and the flavor was awful. Alright- well, not everyone can make milk tea. Then comes the food. The fried rice was alright. The rice was cooked well and at that point I had missed fried rice so much I didn't mind. However, I took a bite of a pea and I was yet again heartbroken. It was probably frozen and it seems as if they left the pea out to thaw and added it into the mixture last minute. The veggies were hard yet falling apart at the same. That wasn't cool. I took a bite out of the egg roll and it was the first and last bite I took of that thing. It was probably another frozen thing, who knows? I don't actually have an excuse for it- the veggies were sour and it tasted like dish soap.The chicken was the only saving part of my meal, but even that wasn't so great. The sauce was basically sweet and sour sauce with sesame on top. There was a good amount of chicken, so I was thankful for that, but there was even a larger amount of sauce on it. Basically with every other bite of chicken I was taking in either the rice (without veggies) or drinking the awful milk tea to balance it out.I brought my milk tea back to the office with me but it sat on my desk for the rest of the day until I threw it out. Thankfully that weekend my roommate and I went to Panda Express in Flowood and my love of Chinese food has been restored. (Edit: This is a joke! Will never hate Chinese food, just the way Mississippi makes it)TL;DR: Go to Panda Express if you want Chinese food (and milk tea)."], ["Jeff B.", "Such a love fest of 4 and 5 star reviews, but I'm going to buck the trend.

The beef is my favorite but shrimp/chicken is good as well. I think this is their best sauce. Tons of fish, duck, and \"funky parts of the animal\" offerings. You've got to try it!Also, this is in the asian supermarket. Take a swing through it when your done! They literally have everything you need to make asian cuisine."], ["Minna Z.", "Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area. My boyfriend and I order take out from here on a weekly basis. We always get the General Tsos Chicken. It is the BEST General Tsos that I have ever had. It's got jusssst the right amount of kick to it without being too overwhelming. Their dinner portion is huge. One order usually feeds both of us, and sometimes, we even have enough for lunch the next day. Also, if you have never tried bubble tea before, I HIGHLY recommend trying their milk bubble tea. Its basically like an iced coffee, but with tea and a unique twist to it. It is delicious and you will not regret it."], ["Cody M.", "Definitely one of the best, if not the best, Chinese restaurants in the Jackson area (and all of MS for that matter). Contrary to a lot of Chinese food in the south, the chicken and food in general is in no way sketchy, and is in fact absolutely delicious. The chicken is very well cooked whether it's with General Tso's, sesame, sweet and sour, or kung pao sauce. It's very well priced, and is an awesome take-out option. Included in the store is the best Chinese grocery in the state that I know of, with everything from fresh produce to all the rice and noodles you can imagine. This is a top spot in Jackson, for sure."], ["Matt H.", "This has a solid shot at being the best Chinese restaurant in the Jackson area. Based on the clientele and some of the other dishes I saw on tables, I expect that this is more \"authentic\" Chinese food than most others.For starters, this is not a buffet. You order from the menu which is quite lengthy. I think anyone should be able to find something to suit their tastes. I've had the Crazy Spicy Chicken, which is good, but not particularly spicy. I've also had the Orange Chicken which is very tasty. My daughter had the Rosemary Chicken, which was an impressive and very good dish served in a small cast iron kettle.The one down side would be the um...aromas that are often present from the seafood section of the \"Oriental Market\" that is in the same building. (By the way, I thought that Asians were offended by the term Oriental. Perhaps that is something created by uptight white people?) At any rate, I have been there once when something had obviously gone bad in the seafood section of the market, not the restaurant. I could barely enter the building and chose not to stay on that trip!If that is not the case when you go (and it has been on only one occasion for me) take the time to stroll through the market. You may find something you have to try!"], ["Chris K.", "By far one of the best Chinese restaurants around. The grocery is super cool too. Authentic and amazing! My kids love the Mango slushes!! \u00a0They do not have a bad thing on the menu, it is all good. My favorites are the basil chicken, kung pao chicken, \u00a0cilantro pork bellies and fried dumplings. My kids always get the sesame chicken and share it; they always have left overs - portions are generous!They also have a location in Little Rock, that is just as good!If you are in jackson or any town with a Mr. Chen's it is a MUST GO!!"], ["Lloyd F.", "Quite pleased w/ my first visit. Arrived and ordered from Lunch Special menu. Prices are reasonable as are portions. Dining room is large and well ventilated. There is also Asian grocery attached in back of store. Staff are attentive and pleasant. I plan on returning."], ["Annie B.", "I was not expecting to be able to get such tasty Chinese food when I moved to Jackson, but I have been very pleasantly surprised by Mr. Chen's. I have eaten here probably five times in the past 11 months, which is a lot of times to go to one restaurant for me!I always get the mapo tofu and the stir fried green beans, which are awesome and Szechuan style. Since I'm a vegetarian, I just ask them to leave out the meat on both entrees. Both are super tasty and comparable to Szechuan style Chinese food I used to get in Washington DC before moving to Jackson.Highly recommended for tasty vegetarian food!"], ["Sam L.", "What happened to their food? It used to be well seasoned, taste fresh, flavorful, and decent portions. Now, the dishes are smaller and too salty. The Sweet Shrimp dish had half the amount of shrimp, the batter was soggy, and the pineapple dry. The eggplant and pork pot dish was overlooked and had too much soy sauce and not enough sugar to cut through salt."], ["Michael D.", "Awesome! Reminds me of authentic Los Angeles asian cuisine. I highly recommend General Tso Chicken it's amazing! Definitely a gem and must see!"], ["Kyrtin K.", "Mr Chen's is probably the single best Chinese restaurant within 100 miles of Jackson, if not more. The food is exceptional, and the price point isn't a dollar higher than any of the barely-edible alternatives, and in fact is slightly cheaper than several local Chinese Buffets. The portions are also quite acceptable, even by my high standards. I am full by the end of a meal, and my wife comes away with enough leftovers to cover a second meal for herself. This is one of only a half dozen restaurants I'd pick to take someone visiting Jackson to eat out at."], ["Grace B.", "Mr. Chen's may be a little sketchy from the outside, but the food is unbeatable. I enjoyed the lunch Moo goo gui pan and it was incredible. Can't wait to eat there again and again."], ["Ian W.", "This is by far the best and most authentic Chinese food in the Jackson area. They are located in an Oriental Market, so they have access to a lot food and drinks that just don't appear at other restaurants. Their Taro milk tea is delicious, well worth checking out if you want something other than the normal fair. When visiting, please don't go with the normal 'Americanized' dishes, try out something that is authentic and not something you can find at a Chinese buffet."], ["Calvin M.", "This is the most authentic Chinese food on Jackson MS. The spicy beef noodle soup is almost as good as those in Los Angeles. They also have dishes that are Americanized. This is the place to be for Chinese food. And some grocery shopping after the meal."], ["Alex Z.", "This place is inside an Asian food market to the left as you walk in. \u00a0The food is super reasonably priced and has been really good every time I've been there. \u00a0The strip-center is sketchy as can be, but the food is always great. Looks can be deceiving and this place is brick and mortar proof of it."], ["Clyde S.", "The food was great I had the general toes chicken it crisp not hard and it had one of the best sauces for general toes chicken I've had in a long time for lunch the price was great I'm going to come eat there soon can't wait to go back I'm getting hungry just writing this"], ["Kayla R.", "Ok. So, yes, once we found a used condom in the parking lot. Yes, it doesn't look like much from the outside. But, guys, this food is great. Once you walk in, on your right you find an Asian market, and on the left is a cozy dining area. They just remodeled and it looks really nice. It's served family style. And the prices are very reasonable. You could easily share one dish between two people. But where's the fun in that? I love going in groups and ordering a bunch of different entrees and sharing. Plus, there's tons of variety. And the food is tasty. Seaweed salad is generous in taste and portion. I you like sweet, the pineapple shrimp is good. Mongolian beef is good, as well. If you like spicy, they got it! And it's marked. Bottom line: best Chinese food in Jackson!"], ["Scott B.", "Driving through from Houston and read the yelp reviews. \u00a0This is a dimond in the rough. dont let the parking lot or first step into the store scare you away. \u00a0the food is amazing, the servers are very nice. \u00a0i'd stop here again without hesitation."], ["Courtney C.", "Favorite place in Jackson so far. Been there twice and looking forward to going back. Spicy fried squid is amazing. The stew-like meals can serve two. The attached supermarket is big and has everything you can imagine. It reminded me of Chinatown in London. They do take out too."], ["Brandon T.", "Great quality of food and taste! I love that they have roast duck constantly! The restaurant is connected to the grocery store and this is the best asian grocery store I've been to in Mississippi!"], ["Heather F.", "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Jackson. One of my friends dubbed it 'Flavor Town' and we try to go as often as we can. Since I moved to ATL that hasn't happened often, but I visit every time I return, both the grocery and the restaurant. It is definitely the best Chinese place in Jackson , hands down. It is not your typical Chinese place. There are no buffets, but each portion is family sized, even their soups. They also have filling lunch specials for a good price. This is a quaint place inside a grocery store. So, don't expect table clothes and a 'fine dining' experience. However, the food is amazing and the place is clean. My favorites are Kung Pao Shrimp, Wonton Soup, and Sweet Pea Leaves. The best thing and what makes it unique is the vast Asian grocery store that the restaurant is in. We eat here all the time when we need to pick up something from the Asian Grocery. They have great prices in the grocery store too. Some things we pick up there regularly are Baby Bok Choy, tofu , gyoza, wonton wrappers, etc."], ["Anna W.", "Truly legit Chinese food. They're attached to a market. The snow pea tips were great. Would not have ever expected this place in Mississippi... Great remodel to the restaurant area."], ["Craig T.", "Mr. Chen's is among the two best Chinese food places that I have found in Jackson (the other being China Express Kitchen in nearby suburb Clinton). \u00a0The level of cuisine is much better than the average strip mall Chinese buffet.When you walk in the front door, you have stepped into a very large Chinese grocery store with all of its inherent smells of fresh fish and mind-boggling assortment of specialty Asian products at rock-bottom prices. \u00a0Need Soba noodles for a recipe? \u00a0Get them here for a third of what you will pay at Kroger. \u00a0My kids love walking around the store and just looking at stuff.Directly to the left as you enter, you will find the dining room. \u00a0Nothing fancy or special here. \u00a0The menu has a lot of dished on it that include lots of things you don't find at other Chinese restaurants. \u00a0You'll could eat here every day for months and not repeat yourself. \u00a0(I don't really recommend that, though.) \u00a0I haven't had a bad dish here yet.The lunch special is especially great. \u00a0For about $7, you get an entree, a couple of dumplings, and a large scoop of fried rice. \u00a0Great deal!As a tip, the dinner entrees are enough for at least three people, maybe four, if you get an extra order of rice. \u00a0A family of four can easily dine on an appetizer of dumplings, an entree, and some extra rice, and all for about $20."], ["Katherine B.", "This was the smelliest most disgusting place and I don't see how anyone can eat here."], ["Jon M.", "Passing through Jackson and popped on Yelp to find a nearby restaurant with good ratings. \u00a0The staff was amazing and on the ball! \u00a0Our toddler age daughter tripped and fell in the parking lot and our server was so kind to try and make her smile and feel better. \u00a0The food was great and plentiful just like so many of the reviews have said. \u00a0Our waitress made sure we were well taken care of and other staff members popped by often to make sure we were taken care of as well. \u00a0Looking around at what others were eating made me wish we were a bit more adventuresome with our food selections because it all looked great! \u00a0We had the pan-fried dumplings, sweet and sour chicken, and sesame chicken. \u00a0Our kids loved the dumplings which were some of the best I have ever had. \u00a0My wife and I could have shared one of the entrees but it was nice to try a few different items. \u00a0Serving sizes are HUGE. \u00a0We also had a mango smoothie and a peach flower smoothie and both were excellent. \u00a0The store makes for a fun after dinner stroll."], ["Zachary B.", "I. Love. Mr. Chen's. It is by far the best authentic Chinese restaurant and grocery store in Jackson. Sure, it's the only one, but that doesn't diminish its quality. The food is excellent, made fresh, and handled by friendly staff. We moved away from Mississippi and miss this place so much."], ["Steve S.", "Some of the best wonton soup I've had. Very authentic food."], ["Count D.", "The reviews of this place told me if I want Chinese food, gotta go to Mr. Chen's. Glad I did, the meal was overall tasty and satisfying.Thankfully the pictures on Yelp were a good guide to what it looks like from the outside. Went in, sat down, started looking at a menu quickly. Staff was friendly, nice, well-dressed and well-mannered. Got my drink order and left me to myself.I desired something with good vegetabls (carrots, sugar peas or snap peas, broccoli, baby corn, etc) and chicken, but when I saw Crazy Spicy chicken and the photo from Yelp, had to go for it. Although tasty, a little underwhelming. The pictures on here definitely are representative, but I would not call it \"crazy spicy\". It was basically small popcorn chicken-like pieces coated with lots of black pepper and tossed with various peppers. No other vegetables! I was tempted to just order a side of vegetables but in the end figured I'd save it for a return trip.Also got a tapioca milk tea on the side. Been a minute since I had a bubble tea :)Overall good place for a Chinese food fix. Kind of far from me so I'm not sure how willing I will be for repeat visits, but worth it nonetheless."], ["Jay L.", "Best chinese in the area. \u00a0Not your typical buffet, but a plate lunch that is satisfying and very good. \u00a0I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef. \u00a0Cooked perfectly and spiced perfectly.The crab wonton appetizer is good, but you get plenty of them to eat!I highly recommend Mr. Chen's. \u00a0Fresh, good, delicious food. \u00a0That's all you need to know."], ["Stephanie B.", "DELICIOUS! Easily the best Chinese food I've ever had. I LOVE this food and the grocery store is fantastic. Very friendly people."], ["Patrick R.", "Best Chinese food in Jackson. \u00a0Saw the reviews on here and thought I would try it. \u00a0 The food was awesome! \u00a0You may not think that when you drive up, but looks can be deceiving."], ["lars h.", "We did not have high expectations. We were on our way home to Florida, and felt like Chinese, and luck and behold for yelp. We were just outside Jackson, and found Mr Chen's.It was were good with very reasonable prices. Service was impeccable, and it was a great experience. We would be back in a heartbeat, if we are around. Loved it."], ["Mayra G.", "This is one of the best Chinese restaurants!! Great food and the employees are very nice."], ["Kennan O.", "I think I'm going to be the only review that doesn't rave about this place. I've lived in a number of cities and know how hard it is to find good food. My mouth salivated at the thought of Mr. Chen's food. I was so disappointed. As I write this review I feel myself getting sick from the pineapple shrimp and shrimp fried rice I ordered. The egg rolls weren't bad. They were a dollar apiece and I saw why. They were small. \u00a0I'm not going back."], ["Luana C.", "Mr. Chen's is the best Chinese restaurant in MS! Whenever my friends bring Mr. Chen's to dinner parties, everyone always enjoys the food! I particularly like their fish with black bean sauce and Taiwanese stir fried rice noodle. My Chinese and Taiwanese friends all agree this is the most authentic Chinese cooking you'll find around the area!"], ["Jason B.", "Excellent Chinese food in the area. \u00a0My kung pao chicken was great fast service."], ["R P.", "Best Chinese for miles around! There is no buffet that attracts the riff-raff. Meals are cooked to order so it will take a little while to prepare, but the food is hot and very good. The service is top-notch as well. In my opinion, there is no need to go anywhere else for Chinese!"], ["Mike K.", "The Crazy Spicy Chicken was very tasty. A dry rub type meal with peppers and other veggies. Will definitely go back again now that i have found a good Chinese restaurant in Jackson."], ["Orlean S.", "A very nice experience. Decent chinese is hard to come by in Jackson. Service was exceptional. Wanton soup was good (enough for 2). Egg rolls were tasty. Triple Delight was nice, but low on sauce and vegetable variety.Fairly large Chinese market is inside with life seafood. The market is larger than the restaurant."], ["Meosha R.", "ok..Yes, Chens have good food. The service is really biased. If you look a certain way then you get excellent service, if not the service sucks. I am an african american lady and each time I go the service for my colleagues and I is horrible:("]]}
