Mainly takeout, but some dine in tables as well. All different kind of folks - from young to elderly, all races, all genders. Pizza Shack's demographics are simple: EVERYONE that loves delicious, affordable grub.I got 6 wings...because I hadn't had wings in a long time. I got the mild sauce. And yes, they were delicious. They didn't ask me what kind of sauce I wanted, and they just brought Ranch. That's cool...I really wanted bleu cheese, but the ranch worked out great.While the wings were great - they weren't TOP 5 of all time worthy. No, no.

Seasoned exceptionally and stacked on there generously. A sweet tomato sauce unlike any I have ever had. Chopped up pickles and onions mixed in with ooey, gooey American cheese. Then the most heavenly thing ever: a top crust of crispy,melty cheddar cheese...all the way to the edge (admit it those little burnt cheese ends are THE BEST). Seriously, this was incredible. Thin crust, but the toppings are so thick this is more like a deep dish pizza. The small was too much for me to eat - I left half of it.

Not only in Jackson, but in the WORLD. Okay, I'm being a little hyperbolic but Pizza Shack is seriously so legit, you guys. I can't imagine getting pizza anywhere else in town. First of all, the pizzas are BIG. They boast that they are \"Mississippi Style,\" rather than New York or Chicago style, and let me tell you-- I think \"Mississippi Style\" must be my favorite style. The toppings and cheese are piled on, so be prepared. When you order, go for one of their specialties rather than a basic cheese or pepperoni and be ready for a very special experience. I have tried all of their pizzas (wow, that's quite a feat to admit to) and I don't have a negative thing to say about any of them. My favorites include the chicken alfredo, the chicken curry delight, the thai chicken, and the cajun joe. Even their \"traditional\" pizzas, like the Hawaiin or the vegetarian, are uniquely and excellently prepared. The ingredients are quality, the crust is thick and flavorful, everything is fantastic. They've also got a small but respectable selection of beers both on tap and by the bottle available for purchase. Their fountain drinks are Pepsi products.The interior of the restaurant is modest at best. I mean, it's called Pizza *Shack*, y'all. There are picnic tables outside, though, and that's a really fun place to sit and enjoy some pizza with pals when the weather's nice. Pizza Shack is located right in between Kat's liquor store and Fenian's pub, so it's the perfect beginning to any fun night you've got planned.Pizza Shack is not your cheapest option, but it's by far the smartest decision you could make this week. It's perfectly reasonably priced-- in fact, it's a downright steal when you realize how MUCH food you're getting for your buck.

They're all really, really well made. Like I said, this is definitely one of the nicer spots in town. Think white tablecloths. Don't show up in your Nike shorts, is what I'm saying. The servers here are super professional and knowledgable. They're always ready with a recommendation for a wine pairing and they know the menu extensively.

The pork chop quickly stole the limelight of our eyes and our conversation. \u00a0It was plated perfectly, at a healthy 8 oz, and bespoke its imminent greatness. \u00a0Meanwhile, I muscled through my so-called veal parmesan [sic]. \u00a0Allthewhile, I was eyeing the pork chop. \u00a0After time, the artificial candle light reflecting downward brought out the sheer redness of the marinara. \u00a0It was as if the veal was looking to me longingly it kept catching me stare at the pork chop on the other plate. \u00a0When dinner was over, I had only eaten the meat of the veal and allowed the dry pasta and wilted greens served alongside of it to grow cold into the night. \u00a0As the waiter brought the check, I looked over at that young couple by the window and reflected how much in common I had with that veal parmesan."], ["Ryan K.", "Bravo! is a great local stop in north Jackson with an award-winning wine selection. \u00a0While I can't say I was put over the top with all of their dinner entrees, their pizzas, appetizers, and deserts are fantastic. \u00a0Of particular note, the Shrimp Basil Pesto wood-fired pizza: savory, rich, and filling for the price.I'd recommend Bravo on the later side of the evening when you need to cool down with a great glass of wine and a very friendly staff."], ["Ryder T.", "I am having a really hard time deciding if this is a 3 or 4 star place. I'll settle on four stars because the food is good and is genuinely good quality. The service is typically very good too. From time to time they will have a special that truly delights.For a very long time, Bravo! Was basically the only nice restaurant in town, and to some extent, I feel that they have just coasted along on that reputation. I don't really know that much has changed as more restaurants have popped up. That is not a terrible thing, but now we are used to going places where we can try new and exciting things all of the time. Bravo is not *exciting* but it is still very good.This is a lovely white tablecloth sort of place. The waitstaff is typically a cut above other restaurants in Jackson, so this makes it a safe bet for a nice date.One of the cool things about Bravo! is that even if it is not culinarily that cutting edge, Jeff Good keeps the business side interesting with promotions that are appropriate for a nice place. You have to pay attention to their emails or twitter, but one creative promotion they did was a \"cellar clearance auction\" where you could bid on very nice bottles of wine from their cellar. If I recall correctly I got what was probably the best bottle of wine I have ever had for half off.It is worth knowing this restaurant, but there are just much more exciting places in town as well."], ["Kayla C.", "Hiding in the upstairs level of the Highland Village is where you'll find Bravo. They're known for their Italian food, and rightfully so. I've been to Bravo several times and have always had a great service and dinner. I took my parents here for their first time and they fell in love. We had the sampler appetizer plate, which was almost filling enough! It had goat cheese, rosemary mushrooms, eggplant, cooked garlic, and lots of other goodies to stick our forks into. For my dinner I ordered a small tomato basil soup and a half Spinach and goat cheese salad. I always get the salad, it's absolutely wonderful. The dressing is a warm balsamic and ummmmm just yum. I got a half size and I was more than satisfied. They offered us free dessert for asking us to move tables when we first arrived, so why not? The menu had so many options it was definitely had to choose. I saw they had after dinner drinks so I ordered a toasted almond. It was SO good as I love almond flavors. It was a shaken mixture of Khalua, half & half, and amaretto. Some other things probably. The table ordered the brownie with ice cream and I got a bite of that too, so yum. Overall, our waitress was SO sweet and fun. I will bring my family back here."], ["Elizabeth B.", "Came to Bravo! Italian Restaurant & Bar yesterday for my brother's late birthday Lunch. It was good, I had the Tri-Colored Tortellini w/Chicken, it had Artichokes, Mushrooms, Spinach, Red Onion & Roasted Red Peppers in it and it had a Tomato-Cream Sauce on it. The Pasta was good and the cheese inside was good, however I would of liked to have, had a few more mushrooms and artichokes in it. I also had Tomato Basil Soup, it was good but I wanted a little bit more basil flavor in it. Then I had the Tiramisu and a Single shot of Espresso, they were the best thing I had at the restaurant. Can't wait to come back and have more."], ["Dom T.", "I was offered a gift certificate and a chance to make things right from my last visit, but decided to give the place a second chance on my dime with some friends. This wouldn't be a fair rating if it was paid for by Bravo. We had four different appetizers and all were delicious. The staff was courteous and pleasant to deal with. I didn't notice any employees on their phones, which is always nice. Bravo, perhaps my last time there was just a bad night for you. Or perhaps someone decided to tighten things up around there. Either way, good job! I not only recommend Bravo but will return, very hungry."], ["Sam S.", "Bravo is my wife and my absolute favorite restaurant in Jackson. The food is always perfect, service is top notch. If you haven't tried it yet you need to. The restaurant has a fancy feel without being over the top. The atmosphere is great for small groups, families, and especially couples. The servers are at friendly, professional, and efficient. This is one of the few restaurants that can always keep my drink cup full (a true feat since I drink water ridiculously fast) There is a bar area that I've never sat at, as well as traditional seating. The restaurant doesn't take reservations. It can get a little crowded on weekends after six, but it is worth the wait. As far as food there is everything from the ten dollar range up to mid thirties. I'm a bit of a cheapskate, so I've really only tried the sub twenty dollar options. My favorite is the chicken sweet potato Gorgonzola salad. My wife really enjoys the shrimp and pesto pizza. As appetizers go they bring you bread with olive oil for free. My favorite to order are the fried polenta - fantastic if you like mushrooms, and the fried brie. \u00a0They have a really impressive wine selection. I've only tried a few of the cheaper wines - around 24 bucks a bottle, and have been incredibly happy with the taste of them. For desserts you have got to try the peanut butter pie... Simply amazing. They have other options that are great as well, but the pie is crazy good. I have been personally greeted by the owners several times, which is really a nice sign in a restaurant. You can even check out the full menu with prices online, which is great. To conclude, I am sure you will be happy if you choose to eat here."], ["Camille M.", "The grilled chicken salad with Gorgonzola, diced sweet potatoes, dried cranberries, walnuts and vinaigrette rocks! The tomato basil soup is really yummy too- very creamy and rich. I also highly recommend the pizza and the Caesar salad. They have a full gluten free menu for those of you with special dietary needs. Love coming to bravo when I'm in Jackson. Great happy hours too! This is an easy, fun spot.. One of my Jackson stand-bys!"], ["James J.", "View: the view is not spectacular. \u00a0But , I like the atmosphere. \u00a0 It is very upscale but not crazy prices. \u00a0It is right off interstate 55 in North Jackson Mississippi.

Food: I like the bruschetta and I have them add cheese to it. \u00a0I also like the paneed redfish. \u00a0it is lightly flowered and is really good.I have eaten here a lot ad if you like wine they have a wide selection. I would recommend this place to eat. \u00a0So if you are coming to Jackson you should try this place."], ["Orlean S.", "Visited Bravo for the first time over Memorial Day holiday. Thankfully it wasn't busy and we were seated fairly quickly. The d\u00e9cor is nice but not fancy. The server was extremely nice and relatively attentive. With many high dollar restaurants you never know how much food will you get - is it enough you don't need to order side items or will you pay a lot and still leave hungry? So each of us ordered an appetizer; me the grilled portobello mushroom and my guest the pecan crusted brie. Both were surprisingly large and enough to share. The Brie was especially tasty. Then we each ordered a half spinach salad which was a nice size and very appetizing with goat cheese, candied nuts, and sweet dressing. The main course for both of us was the specials for the night; Crab crusted amberjack for me and salmon with fried green tomatoes for my guest. For $28 I was underwhelmed at the portion size of my plate. It was a small piece of amberjack with about 3 sliced new potatoes. I was left guessing what \"crab crusted\" meant as I saw no crab. The salmon special was better in both size and presentation. While the size of the fish wasn't notable, there was about 4 fried green tomatoes along with corn and a couple of green beans. But again, not what I was expecting after the large plates of appetizers and salad.For dessert we finished with the flourless chocolate torte and a brandy alexander with ice cream. The torte was very chocolaty with a nice presentation. (If you want the best flourless chocolate cake try the Bonzo at Anchuca, Vicksburg.)Overall it was a nice experience and I will return, even though it was the highest price I've ever paid for a meal in Jackson. But I didn't leave hungry! To do it over again I would share an appetizer and probably order a vegetable side with my main course. I would try the redfish and stay away from the crab crusted special."], ["Brandon T.", "Every time I looked over this restaurant in reviews I was thinking it was Bravo's Italian Cucina, the chain restaurant found in several major cities. But it was definitely not when I checked out the website! The quality of food and calibre was entirely different from what I was expecting! The ambience was one of the classiest I have been to in Jackson with dim candle lit lighting, white table cloths, and huge windows overlooking the highway. The menu was on the pricier side and it may or may not be worth the price. I enjoyed the dining experience, but the meal itself was only average. ."], ["John B.", "The paneed redfish is one of the best meals I've ever had! I get it every time I go there.

I also had the four seasons pizza, which was nice.If you're not from the Jackson area, the restaurant can be a little hard to see from the interstate -- I recommend finding Julep, which is easy to spot on the corner of Northside & Frontage, and entering the shopping plaza from that entrance."], ["William O.", "A wonderful locally owned restaurant. & Bar. \u00a0I celebrated my Birthday there in 2013. \u00a0It is a great place to take the family. \u00a0Excellent wine selection.

The food is really good.I found the service quite professional and friendly. The first time I was there, I have to admit I was skeptical. The place was so large....And so many people...how could they keep up such good quality as reputed? Well they do have great food. Why will I not give it five stars? Because of small inconsistencies that may not be readily apparent unless you go here often. Sometimes you order a dish and it is perfection. The next time, it has something missing... the warmth, or the crispiness, or the sauce has slightly changed. I am very sensitive to these things. And I imagine this has to do with the size of the place. Someone different probably cranked out my favorite dish all three times I ate it. Or it sat for a bit longer. Or it was rushed a bit. \u00a0After that I changed dish and the same thing happened all over again. I am not talking about anything major...it was still delicious. \u00a0 Like I said, I will try a few more places to see if I can find something better...that five star place.

Sorry that I cannot be more specific. This wasn't really all that good and I wouldn't order it again.The place kind of sits in a mall..kind of hard to explain. The atmosphere is casual with a mixed crowd. The only disconnect on the decor was from the main dining room to where we were sitting, the bar/lounge area. It felt completely different. It had the appearance of a cruise ship - tacky tacky..like maybe something like Carnival.

If you are looking for a place with a decent wine list in Mississippi (which is hard to come by) Bravo is your stop. The food is also amazing. They menu offers a wide range of selection from pizzas to fish to a variety of pasta selection. Everything is delicious. Whenever I go I always get the tomato basil soup as an appetizer and the tiramisu for dessert. I normally switch up the entree because I always want to try something different. The tiramisu is hands down the best tiramisu I have ever had.

As she took us to her seat, I saw she had been sitting at the bar eating, and when we sat down, I noticed she was still somewhat chewing. OOO-kayyyy...We sat down and ordered mimosas and bellinis, a must if I am out on a weekend and there is a brunch menu. \u00a0Small for 7 bucks, but I still had 2! \u00a0We all ordered our lunch. \u00a0I got an eggplant napoleon with sun-dried tomato pesto and goat cheese. \u00a0The dish tasted like someone had taken a pre-made one out of the walk-in and put in on the plate. \u00a0It was too cold, and difficult to cut into. \u00a0The flavors were good, but I would rather it had been at least room temperature. \u00a0I started with the tomato soup, which was wonderful. I could have had a few bowls of that and been quite happy. \u00a0The hubs had a BLT club. It was a standard sandwich, nothing to write home about. \u00a0My mother had the crabcakes. These were good, but a crabcake lover like myself, a lot of filler went into these. \u00a0A little less cake and a bit more crab would liven them right up!Service was good, not great. \u00a0He was friendly, but his pacing was off. He tried to take my mothers plate away as she was still eating. \u00a0I always appreciate if a server would ask if I was still enjoying my meal. Then it doesn't sound too hurried and we can all finish our lunch at our pace. \u00a0If I go back to Jackson, I most likely will not be dining here. There were many other places I wanted to go but were closed on a Saturday afternoon for Thanksgiving weekend. By far the most bizarre excuse I had ever heard!! \u00a0Jackson as a whole was a disappointment. Maybe it was the food."], ["Baron M.", "Another great place from Mangia Bene. They have three of the tastiest places in town, plus they give back to the community (maybe that is why it costs just a bit more vs the competition ha). Bravo is no exception. Every time we have come, they have had a professional staff with great food. Sometimes they run some neat specials (like the wine bottle special they are running right now, which we are planning on trying out this Friday) from time to time and it seems that you can get an early bird discount (last time I checked) for dinning in early."], ["Beth P.", "When I have folks in from out of town, this is the first place we go! \u00a0Plus excellent Sunday brunch time, try the breakfast pizza."], ["Skip R.", "One of the best restaurants in Jackson. They don't take reservations, so you will have a wait most times you go there. They are busy, so you won't get the fastest service either. But they are busy because it is very good food. I would rather wait for a great meal rather than get a poor meal in record time. Slow down and enjoy the experience. They use super fresh ingredients and that shines in the quality of the food. I can vouch that the sweep potato fries with cinnamon apricot yogurt dipping sauce and the pecan crusted fried brie with dried cherry marmalade are outstanding. My favorite salad resides there in the Bravo field greens salad with citrus dressing. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose off the entree menu. I have had several pastas including the chicken mushroom with penne pasta. It is really outstanding. The best entree I have had at BRAVO is the pork chop zatarainaise. It's a perfectly cooked pork chop with a creole mustard cream sauce that will knock your socks off. \u00a0Be sure to save room for the banana creme brule for dessert. It is unrivaled IMO."], ["S H.", "This place blows. It's hard to serve decent food when the ingredients are of such crap quality- 23 dollars for crab cakes that's not lump crab meat is a scam.

Keep in mind I am a girl and don't eat too much. Wine list is extensive and bread pudding is out of this world. Cream brulle is another of my favorite here. Cajun pasta with andouille sausage, salmon pizza are some of my favorites there. They have a great pizza oven and most of the pizza choices are great.

I have eaten at some really great italian restaurants in Chicago, this one should be relocated to the \"Windy City\", but then you would miss out on the Mississippi warm and friendly hospitality you receive when entering the door.

Our waitress was very attentive, and the friendly maitre d' stopped by our table as well because we had mentioned this was our first visit. The linguini and meatballs entree was everything we could have hoped for... generous portion, large meatballs that were moist but held together well with a delicious tomato sauce of a just-thick-enough consistency. The eggplant parmesan was the best I've ever had. The slices were consistent in size, about 1/4 inch thick, perfectly breaded, no greasiness, no bitterness, no hint of added sweetness, absolutely delicious. Canoli for dessert.... a perfect Italian meal.

My wife and I went by for dinner on a Friday night. Short version:Overpriced, below average service, food just OK, don't order Shrimp Scampi. The house dressing is the sole standout, but order it on the side!Long version:First of all, parking is not great. When we came in, there was mass confusion amongst the staff regarding who would seat us. Three different people asked how many were in our party. Then they argued about where to seat us.It's dark in here. We saw many patrons using cell phone flashlights to read the menu and their bills.The waitress was very nice, but had no idea what the specials were, did not seem to know the menu, and only made a few infrequent appearances at our table. My iced tea glass suffered long dry spells. The warm bread was very good. The house salad came with a huge amount of minced olives on it, which I don't care for, but to each his own. I have loved Fratesi's house dressing since the first time I had it years ago. It is absolutely fantastic (as long as you like garlic)! However, both salad bowls were literally half full of this dressing. I would suggest you ask for dressing on the side! You will love it!The food was just OK. I ordered the Rigatoni Supreme which was a generous helping of rigatoni topped with a good amount of grilled chicken, grilled shrimp, and grilled sausage. All of the grilled items had good flavor, but the red sauce was a bit bitter and needed salt. Some of the pasta on the edge of the plate that did not get topped with sauce was cold. \u00a0My wife ordered Shrimp Scampi. It consisted of 5 shrimp and a plate of pasta. Most of the pasta had no sauce at all. It had no garlic flavor. It was basically buttered noodles with a few shrimp on top. This dish definitely needed help! With no appetizers, one tea, one water, the two entrees (which include salad) came to a total of $39 and change. I really don't think it was worth that much.

It was a very creamy alfredo sauce and was quite a generous portion. He took the remainder to go for a second meal.The star of the show in my opinion was the tiramisu. I thought it was the best I've had in Jackson and I would prefer it over even Amerigo. It was 100% homemade and reminded me of something my grandma would serve.

The parking lot is always crowded, even on weeknights, which is rather indicative of their popularity amongst locals. Once inside, the bar area is usually flowing nicely with guests grabbing a drink during their wait or with those finishing up their meal and offering seats to those waiting. I've dined at the bar once with my hunny and the service was impeccable. We had the most attentive bar tender who even offered to give us a smaller portion of the carne pizza (I forget the exact name) since we wanted something to snack on with our drinks; for dinner, he had our pasta dish nicely split into two bowls. Absolutely delightful. When a regular guest complained about the pasta, the same bartender had the meal removed from his bill. I have also dined at a table a few times and while the service has been good there, as well, I'd have to say my experience at the bar has been the best one yet at Amerigo.On to food, if you don't like Italian, you're not totally out of luck. The pizzas are delicious and I'm sure you could find a few other appetizers to suit the non-Italian seeking palate. I, for one, love all things carb, and I have yet to be displeased with a dish. I always swap out the marinara sauce for alfredo (hi calories!!) so they can easily handle such substitutions. My hunny enjoys their steak and their soup of the day is always a nice starter, as well. Word of advice: On Valentine's Day, when the whole world wants to eat Italian, Amerigo's gets pretty crowded but you will eventually get a seat-- it's worth the wait in my opinion!"], ["Lei B.", "I had high hopes with this place but I just thought it was ok. I was lucky enough to have one of my coworkers join me for dinner. We ordered a small order fried eggplant appetizer with craw fish. I was so disappointed when they brought I out.

The craw fish was good though but I don't think the sauce combined the two \u00a0items very well. My pasta was just ok. I forgot the name of it but it had peas, ham, mushrooms, and grilled salmon with fettuccine noodles in a cream sauce. The bowl was huge and overflowing! My coworker ordered the pork loin chop and it was served on a piece of smoked cedar wood. His dish was really good. Her cut me a piece and it was soo juicy and full of flavor.Their wine selection by the glass was pretty good. I ordered a Guntrum 2007 riesling, which our waitress recommended. I loved it. I had to remember it so I can find it later. Experience overall was nice. Our waitress was so sweet and very attentive. The only thing I regret was no ordering the tiramisu, since that's all the rave, but I was sooo stuffed!

I had heard so much about how it was the greatest italian restaurant in Jackson and worth the price tag. Some items I tried were spot on: the cheese fritters are AWESOME. Much better than fried mozz sticks. The calamari was good, hard to really screw that up in my opinion. The complimentary bread and olive oil was also pretty tasty. For my meal, I decided to order some pasta since I figured that would probably be an Italian restaurant's specialty. Man, I was disappointed. I got the tortellini with grilled chicken. First of all, the tortellini kind of tasted weird. Secondly, the chicken was about 1/4\" thick. No lie. I've never seen chicken breast that thin and unappealing. And it wasn't just my dish, others in the group that ordered pasta with chicken also had flat, dry, flavorless chicken. The place wasn't all bad - the service was very friendly. The atmosphere is pretty nice but as others have said, a little cramped. This definitely seems like an establishment for old housewives to frequent and be \"seen\" at. Definitely a bit of a snobby vibe but not overwhelmingly so. I would go back , the salads looked really good so I'd probably opt for that next time. I would be hesitant to recommend this place to someone looking for \"great\" Italian since I've had much better meals at even chain restaurants, but I really haven't tried many other Italian restaurants in Jackson so maybe Amerigo's mediocrity is considered good around here."], ["Nicole B.", "Sometimes the one star rating is just too much.

This will be one of Jackson's staples in the upcoming years if it isn't already."], ["Melissa A.", "Great food and service. \u00a0Pretty restaurant with fun patio. \u00a0Nice to grab a quick pizza at the bar or sit down for a slow dinner."], ["Linnea W.", "Oh my gosh j have died and gone to Heaven. Jackson suddenly feels like a soft Chicago . Great environment . Delicious menu."], ["Dana R.", "My favorite restaurant in the Jackson area! My favorite entree so far has been the Tuna filet. The wine and craft beer selection is long and wonderful! Also, the Crawfish bisque they have on the summer menu is delicious. Oh, and for an appetizer- I highly recommend the crab cakes. Roumalade sauce served with it is fantastic!"], ["Rachel P.", "This place is straight up fantastic. I've been for lunch, brunch, and dinner several times and have never been anywhere close to disappointed. Everything is masterfully done.Let's start with the atmosphere-- the restaurant is relatively small, but still maintains a spacious and open vibe. There's seating at the bar as well as some high top tables for smaller groups when you first walk in. Then, in the proper dining room, there are both booths as well as tables. This is an excellent location to bring a group, especially if you're celebrating. Situated right in Belhaven between Fondren and downtown, this place is central to all the going's-on's here in Jackson, and is a perfect place to start your evening.But let's talk about the food. I eat out relatively often and can be a bit of a food snob, I'll admit. This place regularly blows me away. Everything I've had has been phenomenal. The first time I ate here, I had the steak and it was by far the best steak I've had in town. Better than any of the restaurants \"known\" for their steak! Since then, I've had a variety of dishes from salads to brunch to pizza and everything has left me raving. The menu changes regularly, and features a bevy of local vegetables and produce which I LOVE. I wish more Jackson restaurants would do that. It shows a certain pride in this city, which goes a long way with me. This is a fantastic date locale. It's classy, not stuffy, and quiet enough that you can hear yourself chat but not so quiet that no one chats.Their bar is fully stocked and their drink menu is extensive. They offer a fantastic variety of wines and beers, but I've always been most impressed by their unique and finely crafted cocktails. Service, for me, has always been great. The only time it's ever been a bit slow was when I stopped in for a late lunch but that's to be expected at any restaurant when the wait staff is switching from lunch to dinner mode. Even when it's a bit slow, the wait staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful-- always ready with a recommendation or a menu suggestion. Overall, I can't say enough good things about the Manship. It's one of the most excellent restaurants we've got in town, and I'm so glad to have it here in the neighborhood. Check it out! You won't regret it!"], ["Amanda W.", "I ordered a to go dinner. I was surprised and disappointed to see that each to go item, they would charge $.50 per item. So my 3 items added an extra $1.50 just for it being a to go order. I ordered the smoked wings appetizer, the shrimp bisque, and the couscous side item. I ordered the shrimp bisque based on the recommendation from the lady taking my order. I was not impressed. There was basically no shrimp and instead of a creamy sauce it was more of a broth. The smoked wings were pretty good though I had expected more from the white barbecue sauce, it was peppery and fairly spicy (and not in the tasty way) in my opinion.The couscous was something to brag about though. This is also a recommendation from the lady who took my to go order. I wanted the Parmesan truffle fries but she said they were a special and they no longer carried them at this moment. She offered the couscous as a substitute, and she actually got this one right. It had small cut mushrooms with some Parmesan and some truffle oil. Recommended! I did enjoy the look of the restaurant, especially the outside patio area."], ["Ryder T.", "Soon after The Manship opened, I had dinner there and was very impressed. Jackson has had a lot of good restaurants (and still does) but this one really took the cake in all ways. The food was amazing, the service top-notch and the atmosphere felt like I was in a much bigger more impressive city. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food!They have an excellent brunch - probably the most creative and tasty brunch in Jackson right now. The happy hour is also not to be missed. Half off cocktails and pizzas is perfect for an after work drink and snack or a full blown early dinner date! The last time I went to the happy hour, the mixologist (I only use the term because he was actually our waiter at the time, not the bartender, though he had come up with many of the cocktails) was happy to hang around and tell us about how the cocktail combinations had come about. The staff is always knowledgable about where the food comes from and how it is prepared.The only issues I have had with them is weekday lunch - but this is a more difficult time for most restaurants. The food was excellent, of course, but the service was a little lacking. That is to be expected at a busy lunch place like this, however.MAC & CHEESE LIST - This Mac & Cheese is different. It is not your standard comfort food style, so if you are looking for Velveeta (no judgement zone - sometimes we are!) this is not your place. Today it was Pancetta Mac & Cheese (see pic) which was awesome, but it has been a different formulation in the past. Definitely good, but lighter on the cheese than most places. Worth getting for sure though.MUST HAVE DISHES IN JACKSON - The Best Damn G&T. Like the name says, it is the best G&T you'll have, at least until you figure out how to make it yourself. They make it with top notch gin and Jack Rudy tonic. I wouldn't advise the new BDG&T version 2.0, the tonic is gross."], ["Blanca V.", "The food was great! Had the shrimp scampi and angel hair pasta...service was okay just would of liked for our waitress to let us know more about dessert instead of assuming we wouldn't be interested. I heard about the desserts because she was explaining them to the table next to us!"], ["Andrew B.", "LMAO I just looked at the page and the special offer is for a free \"desert\" instead of \"dessert\". That advertising is paying off!Way to go Yelp"], ["Tiffaby H.", "The food is always good! Great lunch specials if you want a gourmet meal on a budget then this is the place! This location has an extensive bar area and hard to find liquors great for happy hour too which is 3-6!"], ["Aminah M.", "We found this place on Yelp and we were not disappointed. The ambiance and decor were great but the knowledgeable waitstaff and Delicious food are what make this place a winner for me. We ordered the Mediterranean shrimp salad and the farmers market pizza and added sausage. We ate at lunch and the portion sizes were great. Everything was super fresh and tasty. The salad was fresh, presented well and the shrimp were just melt in your mouth good. The pizza was a tad greasy, but it didn't take away from the flavor. We got the free desert for checking in, and ordered the cobbler. It was DELICIOUS. The crust was so light and crumbly I could eat 2 of those by myself. In short no complaints. My server Brandon was not only knowledgeable but he was also super friendly and just made our dining experience A1. \u00a0 I'll be back to check out dinner for sure"], ["Kevin W.", "Duck wings and ribeye deckle will absolutely never disappoint. I chose the cowboy special tonight and am overly stuffed and happy. \u00a0Throw in some crab beignets and this place is by FAR the best, freshest and imaginative menu in Jackson. Add the fact that the price point is perfect."], ["Rob J.", "My wife and I love to use yelp to find not so hidden treasures across the country.Today, we found Manship! The Duck wings and greens were excellent. You should share your meal and be wise...and leave room for the cobbler!Nobody does cobbler like Mississippi!"], ["Ryan K.", "The Manship Wood Fired Kitchen was the second restaurant I ever visited in Jackson. \u00a0Over the past year, I've been back more times than I can count, and I always take my friends and family when I have visitors in town. \u00a0The Manship's service, atmosphere, and plate presentation is really great, offering a wide variety of options for different types of eaters without making the menu overwhelming.Hands down, the Manship serves the best pork belly dish I've had in Jackson... and I've had a lot of pork belly. \u00a0The Manship has daily menu rotations and seasonally modifies their dishes with local flare. \u00a0Recommended: \u00a0The pork belly, smoked Caesar salad (with extra anchovies), the Funghi, Farm Egg, and Bacon pizza, and any of half-fish specials."], ["Micah S.", "Every time I come to the Manship, I try something different. And every time I try something different, I love it. This is definitely one of Jackson's best and most creative restaurants. Worth trying!"], ["Melissa M.", "I've wanted to try this for awhile and happened to be nearby today. \u00a0The place is bright, clean, and well appointed. \u00a0Love the abstract art from local artists hanging in their gallery. \u00a0Our server was quick and friendly. \u00a0We'd gotten a gluten-free menu from the host, but our server went the extra mile and took it back to the chef who told him the dish we wanted was not gluten free and also cooked in the same oil as non gluten-free items. Fortunately we aren't that sensitive but we appreciated his thoroughness in verifying the items. \u00a0I ordered the salmon salad but asked for the kale to be changed for the local lettuces, omit onion, and add feta. \u00a0They did this without a charge (although they did leave onions on - no problem as I could easily remove them.) \u00a0My dining partner had the simmons catfish with parmesan fries. \u00a0Our order came quickly given the lunch rush. \u00a0My salad was very good. \u00a0The portion was relatively small, but it ended up being enough. \u00a0It included lettuce, finely diced cucumber, kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and a feta vinaigrette. \u00a0My son had 3 nice sized filets and a cup of fries. \u00a0He liked the fish but really raved about the fries. He said the parmesan permeated the entire dish, not just the fries on top. \u00a0Being yelpers, I pulled the listing up and saw a free dessert with entree offer with check in. \u00a0We had the chocolate mousse. \u00a0It was excellent and a nice sized serving. \u00a0It was a complex dish with several layers and flavor profiles - chocolate, crust, ganache, cream, raspberry drizzle, and mine. \u00a0And it was complimentary, so there's that! \u00a0I will go back and try something else. \u00a0It was above average food and service. \u00a0Prices were a little steep for lunch (2 entrees, no drinks was $35 with tip) but it was very good."], ["Jon D.", "Very good, prices are a little high but you get what you pay for - worth the price. I had a wedge, shrimp and grits, and a baked apple. Would go lighter next time as my meal was a little heavy. Delicious nonetheless. Free Dessert with Yelp check in was a big bonus. I'll be back, no doubt."], ["Jessica S.", "Very nice atmosphere. Wait staff was nice. I ordered the salmon but it was really salty. As were a few other things I ordered. Aside from that it was pretty good."], ["Shane S.", "This place is great! It has only been opened for a year and half, but they have received awards such as Best New Chef, Best Restaurant, even the sous chef has gotten accolades. The Manship is a huge space, but also welcoming with a more than competent wait staff. The drink menu is extensive and eclectic. The shrimp and grits were out of this world, the pimento cheese is a perfect creamy texture with a little heat. My crawfish pizza was amazing. The crust was just crisp enough to hold up to the buttery sauce. They have a great happy hour with half price pizzas. The strawberry tart with ice cream was the perfect compliment to finish the meal. The Manship is one of the very few reasons to visit Jackson again."], ["Ann M.", "The manship is one of my favorite sit down dinner spots in Jackson, and it's my all time favorite happy hour! Half off pizza's and drinks- YES! Every pizza I've eaten so far has been divine, and the porch-swing and heat index always hit the spot. As for dinner, simple sides like their any gratin potatoes or and veggie dish have satisfied my appetite. Personally, I go for the brocollini and some divine crab beignets . The duck and the filet are terrific, as well as the salmon and redfish. We used the Manship for our wedding rehearsal dinner and were so pleased! The services were great, and all of our guests were extremely happy with their food. I recommend them for events, for happy hour, and for a fun date night! Definitely in my top five for favorite Jackson restaurants."], ["Lisa G.", "Food was amazing as well as the staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, from explaining the artist & artwork on the walls to the best recommendations of what to eat. Jake was my server and did not disappoint with the rabbit ravioli with pancetta and chocolate silk tower for dessert! He even brought me a spoon to not miss out on all the goodness of the most flavorful sauce! Telling everyone at the conference to try this place out."], ["Scott A.", "Best steak in Jackson. The reduction sauce on the steak is amazing. I had the Prime cut. Best Mac and Cheese I've ever tasted. My wife got the Greek chicken, little dry in the middle but lots of great flavor. Also had the red shrimp appetizer. Really good but not very many. Only thing missing from the meal was bread to soak up the sauces. The apple dessert was very tasty as well. Great atmosphere."], ["Amin A.", "Actually a 3.5 starWas visiting Jackson because corporate hq is centered here and had to attend training. Prior to arrival I mapped out all the restaurants that I wanted to try and Manship just so happened to be first on the list. \u00a0Day one after training I went to the hotel, changed, and went to manship to check out the Jackson food scene with 2 other colleague . The decor was beautiful and the restaurant very clean underneath a hospital it was apparent that the customer attraction was young professional- the restaurant was very busy- \u00a0we were seated immediately. The waitress introduced herself and said that the restaurant had many different foods but many dishes have a bit of Lebanese twist and spice added., since the chef was Lebanese. We ordered the tuna dip, and duck wings as appetizers. The duck wings were very good and greasy but had barely any meat on them. The tuna was actually a very good dip. For an entree I ordered the Rabbit pasta- to my surprise rabbit was a little salty of a meat- but furthermore the pasta dish was incredibly small- this was unexpected for a 18 dollar dish. My colleague got the strip steak which tasted remarkable but was a very little bit. The third colleague ordered a pork shoulder- which I cannot comment on because I do not knowingly eat pork. The desert was the best thing i got Tiramisu which was free with checkin was absolutely delicious maybe the best thing I got \u00a0Anyway with 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 2 drinks- 62 bucks. Not bad - it just didnt really satisfy portion wise. Regrets: I would get the pizza.I would return."], ["Landon M.", "First time here this evening while visiting Jackson, pleasant experience. The staff adhered to the reservation notes well. Charcuterie and cheese assortment were great. Salad and entr\u00e9es were well but a bit on the large side. Red fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned well. The sirloin was cooked spot on med rare, only complaint is it was over sauced when it could have stood on its own. Very nice wine selection, especially northern Italians. Bar service was top notch cocktails were well, plethora of digestifs and probably the best Scotch whiskey list in town. \u00a0Slides in to one of my top five when in jackson."], ["Shenika C.", "I visited the Manship one afternoon for lunch. I ordered the shrimp po-boy and although it was slightly salty, I enjoyed it. I wasn't impressed with the parmesan fries. Very nice atmosphere and I definitely will eat here again."], ["Cherry D.", "Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon with a couple of friends. We ordered the chicken, pork, and beef entrees, as well as a couple of alcoholic beverages. The pork was a little on the sweet side for my liking, so I ended up not eating my dish. The beef had a good Mediterranean flavor and it was really moist. But the chicken was on point! I would definitely go back for the chicken. My mouth is salivating just thinking about the chicken. Can't wait to go back."], ["Kris A.", "We were in town from New Orleans celebrating our anniversary so the pressure was on to find the perfect restaurant. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The restaurant and bar area were full when we arrived with one party waiting but we were sat right away thanks to the convenient reservation I made on my Yelp app a few hours earlier;)On to the service/food experience...First of all the seasonal menu is amazing and I had a really hard time narrowing down my choices because I wanted one of each! We asked the server tons of questions and he answered all of them patiently and honestly. After thorough discussions with the server, browsing through Yelp photos and some meditation, we ordered: the white bbq wings, marinated crab claws, burrata apps, ribeye deckle, parm reggiano fries, mushroom bacon egg pizza entrees and for dessert the chocolate mousse and tiramisu. If youre having as hard of a time deciding as we did, here's the breakdown:Wings were delicious, nothing out of the ordinary thoughCrab claws are the only thing we wouldnt order again. \u00a0They were tasty but we expected them hot which thru us offThe burrata was the best Ive ever had. Ribeye deckle are medalions that melt in your mouth and is AMAZING. The pizza had generous amounts of exotic mushrooms, nice chunks of meaty bacon and a perfectly cooked poached egg that just made the bite velvety deliciousness. I am a french fry connoisseur and I wouldnt change a thing about these. Perfect size with perfect amount of salty cheese in a perfect portion. I even left a few which is hard for me to rationalize still today. Our desserts were complimentary thanks to our yelp check in! \u00a0The tiramisu is more of a dulce de leche with a slight taste of Bailey's. It was good, just not your typical espresso soaked. The mousse was excellent with a dollop of raspberry that complimented it well. Overall it was an awesome anniversary dinner and we would recommend Manship to everyone in the area. ($160 after tip: 3 andygator draft beers + 1 heavens milk martini not mentioned)"], ["Darren S.", "Now that I have a toddler, we have to make every date night count. The Manship is our most consistent go-to spot for a great experience. You can enjoy The Manship any way you'd like: cocktails and small plates, pizza and beer, or steak and wine. Whichever route you choose, you'll find fresh, local ingredients and the wood-fired grill accentuating everything. We've had excellent service every time, and the decor is bright and clean, contemporary but still comfortable. The open kitchen adds a nice buzz to the room."], ["Claire S.", "Extremely mediocre and pricy not for the portion but because it was kind of gross. Chicken was terribly dry with no flavor whatsoever, yet sitting in fat. Pizza suffered from the same dry chicken and artichokes were incredibly tough. Waitress never did a quality check, which was probably the worst part. She didn't have a full section and never once asked if everything was okay. Mac and cheese was probably the best part and even then - it was 2/10 at best. Won't be back. Won't recommend it to anyone. Best part was the drinks, which were well made."], ["Leon S.", "Food is good....service is slow....shrimp bisque (has \u00a0curry in it)....

The staff was nice and accommodating, always a plus. I got the beef Poboy, absolutely delicious. 2 others got the chicken shwarma and nothing was left. The Spanish fries were amazing. A touch spicy, but that's ok. For the dessert, I got Tiramisu. A little on the creamy side than what I'm used to, but that's ok (others weren't a fan). There was also this lemon tart thing with sherbet which was also delicious. If I ever end up back in Jackson, definitely a place to go!"], ["Brenna M.", "Yelp has not let us down yet! It helped us find this awesome little restaurant, Manship Wood Fired Kitchen. We had Grouper with Polenta & Tomatoes/Veggies, Italian Crab Claws, Parmesan Truffle Fries & their Brisket as well as a Pepperoni Pizza with 2 Fried Eggs. Ridiculous. Food Porn. Oh, and their Bread with Seasoned Olive Oil is fantastic. Our three year old devoured the Italian Crab Claws & Brisket!"], ["Vicky O.", "Our evening at The Manship was not good at all! Our waiter never introduced himself as our waiter (he just appeared and asked for our order) nor told us his name (our receipt says his name was Brandon). In fact, his first few words to us included labeling my friend 'sassy'. We should have known then what would follow...Let's back up...I made a reservation, arrived on time and still had to wait to be seated. Not very long, maybe 10 minutes, but what's the point of a reservation if you have to wait? I wasn't a big deal so I let it go. Anyhow, as I was led to the very back of the restaurant (by the kitchen) I passed by 2 open tables that could have fit our group. \u00a0I let that go too. My friend and I waited at least 20 minutes to place a drink/appetizer order along. Thirty minutes later only \u00a0one of the two appetizers had been received. The other appetizer never appeared and our waiter was so inattentive that we had to flag down another server...whose only response was that he would ask our waiter about the food. \u00a0After an hour of bad service we did not bother ordering entrees and took our business further down State Street to Surin, where the service was EXCELLENT!Also, if you choose to eat at The Manship (which we \u00a0will no longer be doing) \u00a0DO NOT EAT THE BREAD! Our table was in the back next to the bread station (the worst table possible even though we made reservations and there were other tables open!!!) and ALL of the servers handle it with their bare hands. Gross. Gross. GROSS. The funny thing is even though we were so close, our waiter never bothered to provide us with any bread during our one hour stay. And when we asked for our check, instead of asking what the problem was or if we wanted anything else, he handed us our \u00a0checks (the only thing he did promptly) with a vibe of \u00a0'good riddance'. That is not okay.I will say that the pork belly was pretty good (Table 100's is better IMO) but the culture \u00a0of bad service is unforgivable for any dining experience.

Fish was light and flaky. Pizza wasn't too greasy but the lamb is strong just as a warning. Rabbit ravioli was a bit small but again not too greasy and the rabbit isn't too strong. Just slightly chewy and very tasty. Artichokes aren't actually artichokes but actually sun chokes like fingerling potatoes. Carrots great.

So glad we did. First off, the ambiance is wonderful--very laid back but well thought out decor. A huge blackboard is displayed right next to the open air kitchen--listing the locally-sourced ingredients at Manship.I had the Fennel Sausage pizza since they have a wood fired oven. It was delicious as it sounds. The crust was crispy and flavorful just as it should be.My sister got the duck leg, egg, and polenta brunch special--that was out of this world good. And the boys went with the Italian Panini sandwich and Roast Beef sandwich--which they were really pleased with. The waitstaff left something to be desired--didn't refill water until we asked, switched up the order, and almost spilled the sandwich on one of us. That's the only reason I knocked off a star.Otherwise Manship is well worth going to."], ["Luke C.", "Regular spot for me and my wife. Always pleased with the food and service. The local sourcing of ingredients is particularly appealing. You're doing it wrong if you don't order the au gratin potatoes."], ["Brandon M.", "Went in tonight for dinner and the meal was terrific. We started with the pork belly which had a fantastic flavor. Our party had the pepperoni pizza, Amberjack, salad, potatoes au gratin and spinach. Each was perfect.

Happy hour is a great deal... Pizzas for $5 and cheap fancy drinks! The best drink is the Porch Swing. It's a sweet adult lemonade with alcohol. Careful, though, the drinks are strong! I also love the Jerusalem artichokes and the broccolini. The tabbouleh is thick and mushy-- you might want to skip this dish. The bread is to die for."], ["Krystal C.", "This establishment was great. Well lit, clean, excellent atmosphere. The bread brought to the table was fresh and served warm. I ordered the chicken wrap. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy. The pita was fresh and toasted just right. The tzasiki sauce was excellent. The truffle fries were fantastic. I wish I could have snuck an extra order home for later. My husband enjoyed his fried oyster po boy and home fries as well. Highly recommended."], ["Susan L.", "As a foodie, I thoroughly research via yelpRestaurants trying to find a great choice. On our way to Florida, stopped in Jackson MS. Manship was everything the reviews said; it is so worth the stop!

It is so refreshing when a chef takes passion in the fresh, best ingredients and takes pride in using them in the most creative and delicious way! Spectacular!"], ["Orlean S.", "Visited Manship for the first time early on a Sat evening. Parking is a chore at the Belhaven building. The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern. Even though they weren't yet busy, because I had no reservations we were placed next to the bar. I chose Manship not because of the menu online but because of the outstanding pictures of actual dishes they post on Facebook. There is nothing on their appetizer menu that appealed to me. I heard people mention the tuna dip and the waiter recommended it. It really is tunafish with a smoky taste plus saltine crackers and some fancier bread crisps. It tasted OK but I would not order it again for $13. For a salad we ordered the wedge and Mediterranean. The wedge was standard, but I was not impressed with the Mediterranean. I guess I was expecting a Greek salad but this was very different. It had little dressing and was crunchy due to the chickpeas. I would not order it again.Finally for the main courses we had the duck breast and red snapper special. The duck was tasty yet a little chewy as duck often is. The snapper was outstanding - a light flavored fish over risotto and a few squash slices in a wonderful broth. Both dishes need a side so we shared 3: broccolini, fried okra, and tabbouleh. All 3 were terrific. The broccolini was well seasoned, the tabbouleh was good with a little more tang than is usual, but the standout was the fried okra. This should be on the appetizer menu. They were delicious whole fried okras with a roasted red pepper dipping sauce. They are addictive. Overall the Manship was a nice experience. It's too bad the standard menu isn't more to my liking - lacking in appealing appetizers and a larger selection of seafood entrees. But the main course was outstanding - I definitely would return again. Even though we had 3 different people try to take our drink order, the wait staff was pleasant, friendly and attentive."], ["STEVEN W.", "Great happy hour prices. \u00a0I had the Scallops, they were a little salty and would not recommend.

We ordered the pimento cheese and bread as an appetizer as well as the pork belly over creamy polenta. Both were great and not much was left on our plates. The pork had great flavor and the pimento cheese spread was a great addition to the garlic bread. I ordered the gulf shrimp as my main course. Angel hair pasta with olive oil and Italian spices with lots of shrimp. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the spices on the pasta really topped it off. Our server was outstanding as well.

Staff is friendly and very responsive. The lunch entrees we got were the special of the day of brisket, potatoes, and Brussels Sprouts with bacon. Tasted fresh and a great deal for $11. The steak kabob could use a little more refining. Price of $14 comes with 1 side but no starch (rice pilaf would go great) which can leave you leaving unfulfilled. The meat was cooked very well, but 2 main drawbacks: way too much oil is left in dish intended to be part of the sauce and not enough bell peppers to add some crunch to the dish."], ["Rich R.", "Couldn't believe I found this in Jackson Mississippi - the food was amazing, drinks superb and service to boot.

I was kicking myself wondering why I didn't discover this place EARLIER! We ordered the Pork Belly app, the Caesar, the mushroom risotto, the prosciutto pizza, and the Pannacotta dessert with Red Wine poached pears with a raspberry drizzle with phyllo crisps. Everything was spot on, plenty of flavor, and all the right balance of textures. The pizza comes with four silicone ramekins of condiments - fresh dried fragrant oregano, grated parmigiano, large sea salt flakes (Maldon?), and what every pizza should have sprinkled on it, red chili flakes. Nice touch! The prices are fair, you're getting great quality, delicious food so you should pay accordingly, you get what you pay for.We are here for another week and plan to be there practically every night till we leave!

The bartenders are really friendly and great at recommending cocktails to try, and their Best Damn G&T is to die for. My only complaint--and the only reason it gets less than 5 stars--is that the hostesses are absolutely abysmal. They're not attentive at all when you walk in. Recently, my friend called to make a reservation, and the hostess told her no reservation was needed that evening because the restaurant wasn't crowded or booked at all. Well, when my friend arrived, despite all but 3 tables being empty, the hostess said they couldn't be seated for 45 minutes b/c all the tables were for reservations.

We replied that we were really there for dinner and were seated in the back of the restaurant. The menu stated that happy hour was from 3-6 and included 1/2 price pizza and discounted cocktails. My husband ordered a beer and a pizza and I had the shrimp and grits. Service was ok. Food was good. However when the bill arrived we were charged full price for the beer and pizza. When we mentioned to the waitress that it was still happy hour time and could we get our discount, she replied \"no, that's only for people sitting in the bar or patio\" and would not give us the discount. She said this happens to a lot of her customers and the conversation is always awkward but there wasn't anything she could do about it. Not sure why sitting in one place qualifies for happy hour prices when another location does not, wish this was made clear by the hostess when we were seated."], ["Ryan D.", "I rarely ever write reviews, but the Manship boasts amazing food mixed with great service. I tried the calamari (excellent tomato sauce) had the hanger steak with grits. Everything about this meal was perfect.

The entree sizes are perfect and the wide variety of addon side items allow for dozens of combinations. The atmosphere is also excellent and the staff is top notch.

It was chicken, some veggies, and melted mozzarella on top of bread. \u00a0My father ordered the brisket plate with Mac and cheese and coleslaw. His meat looked very dry and his aides a little old.

The service has been...OK, but not good.The atmosphere gives the impression that you will be having a really special dining experience. The price would lead you to expect that you will be having a really special dining experience. Even the way they package left-overs in these fancy little boxes gives the impression that you are at a high-end restaurant.Let me be clear, I don't mind paying a great deal of money for a fabulous dining experience. However, for the prices here (which I consider to be the high side of moderate) I expect food and service that is a bit better. I don't expect 5-star food and service, but better than somewhere like Applebee's. On our latest visit, we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes appetizer. They seemed to be under cooked and the consistency was off. I had the Lobster Fettuccine and as another reviewer posted, \"the sauce was like milk both in consistency and taste. That rich flavorful Alfredo that normally comes with it was watered down or made improperly.\" I can't find it on the menu, so it may have been a special. It was good, not great. There was very little seasoning to it and very little crab. The portion was large though.My wife's dish was so unmemorable that we cannot recall what she ordered. Obviously nothing particularly great or particularly bad. That really sums up our overall dining experiences here, not particularly great, but not particularly bad either. It is perfectly adequate. I probably only go here once every year to year and half and that is just about long enough to forget that I was a bit disappointed last time. \u00a0I think for the prices, it should be a bit better.

It is fine.Some other reviews have noted that sometimes they rely on too much sauce or cheese and too much salt. I'd definitely agree here. One particular instance was a salmon salad, nothing fancy, just a bit of salmon dropped on top of some mixed greens. The salad, however, had way too much olive oil and lemon juice. So much that it really interfered with the salmon.There are definitely some tasty dishes but nothing is going to blow you away here.The food is generally well prepared, however.

He wasn't that busy, but even when he did come to our table he didn't ask or offer anything outside of taking our order. The manager was young, not-confident, lacking genuine concern for customer satisfaction and again didn't ask or offer us anything outside of fixing our problem bass on our suggestion.

The manager brought me my bowl, and it was incredibly obvious as the liquids sauce sloshed around that it wasn't right. He should've never placed it in front of me.My brother's ravioli was over cooked and under salted. The filling was mostly gone and the pasta was a hardened yellow color. The manager did offer to replace my entire, so I ordered the Beet, Goat cheese and Arugula salad. My brother had finished eating by the time they got it to me so it was not comfortable with him having to wait for me. There was some in identified ingredients in the salad and the arugula salad was not only old and rotting but the tough core of the Arugula was not chopped ours.My brother and I were in shock. \u00a0They messed up 3 dishes. They offered free dessert and we turned it down. Free or not we wanted to get out of there first because I was starving a needed to get food somewhere else and 2nd because we couldn't trust them to remake anything.It's clear based on this incredibly horrific experience that the chef and cooks, manager and server cared nothing about the quality of our food or experience.I only hope they can redeem themselves, they'll only get one chance from me if I work up the guts to take the risk.

If I'm not familiar with the menu and I get the feeling that my server has similar tastes, I'll hit them up for suggestions. Everything he recommended was great. First we tried a peach on prosciutto appetizer. Peaches on cured ham sounds crazy, right? It was da BOMB! My girlfriend and I shared an entree: baked ziti. I'm not a big pasta guy, but I enjoyed it.The app and entree were great, but honestly, the real reason I came here was for dessert. So diabetes runs in my family, but YOLO. I love bread pudding. If a restaurant has it on the menu, I'm ordering it. I had it both times I've dined here. The first time, I had their standard white chocolate bread pudding.

It's like jumping off of Mount Everest wearing a wingsuit, while Jimmy Page plays a thirty minute extended version of the Stairway to Heaven guitar solo. IN YOUR MOUTH. Hands down the best I've ever had. The bartender recommended I try the bread pudding bomboloni, which was basically flash fried pieces of bread pudding with rum sauce and vanilla ice cream, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar (if I recall correctly). IT.WAS.AMAZING.. Like Zeus himself came down from Olympus and shot a sugary lightning bolt in my mouth. If i lived near this place, I'd probably dessert here every day.

I went with the half and half lunch special - half of a Caesar salad, half of the chicken piccante pizza. The salad was laughably small, just funny how small it was. The pizza was overwhelmingly large - I eat a lot and I could not finish it. The pizza was amazeballs though.The chicken piccante pizza is spicy grilled chicken, smoked bacon, leeks, Montchevre goat cheese, on Italian cheese. Yummy, delicious, amazing. Everything blended together well and the goat cheese finish was just impressive. Strong, lots of flavor, I can't help but thinking about it and wanting it again.

The wedge was just as I was craving. Pretty standard. The ravioli was not at all what I was expecting. It was in a very light olive oil and butter sauce with large pieces of walnut and small cubes of squash.

They can use some work on the drinks; my advice is not to have a drink containing St. Germaine on the menu if you're unable to get it.

Strike one.To make a long story short, a little before 7 the manager came out and tried to get us to leave, stating the table had been booked for a 7:15 reservation. Two of our party had shown up late (the reservation was for 5:15 but that should not matter - and they would not accommodate them because of the lateness; i.e get them a chair. They then had a audacity to stick a gratuity on the bill (which I can see because of the party) but if you really stick it to your patrons you should remove a gratuity. Strike two.The manager kept saying that, in no way, was he asking us to leave. In my book, if someone tells me that my table has been reserved - and I'm waiting for my dessert - then you are essentially asking me to leave. Strike three.The waitress was apologetic - until the end. She even began crying. When she came back with the receipts, she threw mine down on the table - and I'd been nice and not said a word to her. However, one guy in our party commented that we'd be going somewhere else next time.

The simple table side made condiment of olive oil, pepper, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is so good. \u00a0I can tell you the calamari is always fresh and seasoned nicely. I have had several of the pastas and all were good. However, there is a clear star of the show here. It is the fettuccini with lobster. The pasta is made with squid ink, so it is black. It is tossed with mushrooms, herbs, and huge chunks of lobster meat. It is finished in a delicious cream sauce. Don't forget to get an extra basket of bread. You won't want to leave any of the sauce in the bowl. I get this almost every time I have the pleasure of dining here. I think you will enjoy Biaggi's.

It's a great atmosphere for friends, pizza, and drinks because you can sit outside as well as inside and the service has always been great.

I was expecting it to be more dive-y, so this was a pleasant surprise. - WINE!!!! OMG, WINE. AND COCKTAILS. I'm always super disappointed in many restaurants for only serving beer (boo, MS strict wine/liquor license laws!) and have almost come to expect most places to have just that.- The spinach salad was on point!Cons:- It's pretty loud in this place. Ambiance is fun but nothing special. Great for kids, though.- The pizza we got was pretty bland. It's like they didn't use any spices whatsoever on it. For what hype this place gets, I expected more adventurous flavors.Although Sal and Mookie's won't become \"my\" pizza place, I'll probably be back for a date night with baby in tow.

Perhaps the biggest drawback to this pizza joint is the price. \u00a0I retreated to a sufficiently dark and serene place in order to search my heart before I rendered the final verdict. \u00a0I weighed the pros and cons, the price, the quality, and the service ad nauseam. \u00a0In the final analysis, we are left with a 3-star rating. \u00a0Also note that this is this author's third experience here. First, this place is cool. \u00a0It has all the trappings trendy post-modernist architecture. \u00a0The premises commands this response: wooden faces engraved tall and proud oaks, the slightly retro-hipster dress and appearance of the wait staff, and the quintessentially modern (yet, ethnically suggestive) logo bearing the image of two chefs with a pizza (you'll recognize it immediately, its a cross between the Pringles guy and Mario). \u00a0Ergo, it is a great place to take a first, second, or third date. \u00a0Scratch third--hold at two. \u00a0Second, this place holds itself out as a traditional pizzeria. \u00a0Unfortunately, Sal shows it hand early by exposing the mundane and dehydrated pepperoni pizzas on display in the foyer as your hostess approach your table. \u00a0Granted, its not as unsightly as those spinning under a blatant heat-lamp, but it is offensive enough to discourage you. The initial wave of wait staff, hosts, were generally disorganized and seemed confused. \u00a0A party of less than five should not have proved to be such an insurmountable variable. \u00a0 The server never bothered to refill beverages unless pressed (this sounds petty in the printed word but we all know what this means). \u00a0However, the server was surprisingly adapt at providing answers to questions about the menu. \u00a0I wish he or she could have been more consistent. Thirdly, this place is confusing. \u00a0There is a mysterious tomato image next to almost every other menu item. \u00a0After consulting the Da Vinci Code, the party and I finally concluded that it reflected vegetarian options after losing those precious minutes of dinner discussion. \u00a0This was far too great of a mental exercise than I care for in a purported, \"down-to-earth\" pizzeria menu. However, what this place cannot deliver in pizza, it makes up for it stromboli form (inconsistently). Notice the confusing \"Strom\" next to each entree which means you have have the option of ordering it as a stromboli or pizza. \u00a0I came to eat pizza and not decode menus. Fourthly, where the HELL was the server or the wait staff during this time to provide that essential guidance? \u00a0Whatever he or she was doing, it did not entail providing much needed clarity to the menu. \u00a0I would be willing to bet it violated his employment contract as well. Finally and ultimately, stop here if your in the mid-north eastern quadrant of Jackson. \u00a0At $15 a head, my stromboli was much, much better than the best pepperoni hot pocket i've ever had but less than the best Dominoes i've had recently."], ["Irene R.", "I stopped here with the family because several people suggested it. \u00a0As a Native New Yorker I was not impressed with the pizza. \u00a0The crust was soggy and the pizza overall was bland.

First of all, it's a huge venue which is great because it definitely gets crowded for dinnertime. They offer plenty of large tables, making it an excellent choice if you're heading out with a group of friends. Marketing themselves as an old-fashioned pizza and ice cream joint, Sal and Mookie's has a lot to offer. The pizzas are definitely good, from what I've had. It's sort of a Jackson-Does-New-York-Style-Pizza situation. The ingredients are fresh, the crust is crispy and the sauce is hearty. The other dishes I've tried have all been good. The seafood and pasta dishes are delicious, and the portions are HUGE. You will definitely be asking for a box at the end of your meal, trust me. Sal and Mookies offers a really good variety of quality, local beers, but it's definitely on the pricier side if you're just looking for a place to grab a drink. Splitting a pitcher and pizza with friends is a great deal though. Since they're located right in Fondren, this is a really fun place to grab a good meal with friends before heading out for the night."], ["Ryder T.", "Sal & Mookies is good, but it's popularity has gotten ahead of itself. This is part of the Jeff Good triumvirate - Bravo, Broad Street and Sal & Mookies. Bravo was one of the original high end restaurants in Jackson. Broad Street and Sal & Mookies target a more casual demographic. There are a lot of great things about this restaurant, but I am giving it a 3 star rating because it is usually just slightly disappointing, and slightly overpriced.Sal & Mookies focuses on Pizza and Panini. The pizza is New York style - thin crust, often too thin and soggy. Recently I overheard the selection of toppings described as \"weird\" and I guess that is about right. The selections are not always what you would expect, while quite good, sometimes they just miss the mark. If you order pizza, make sure to eat it all - this pizza does not keep well. The bar side - dubbed The Pie Lounge, is quite good actually. It is a small bar area but has a nice covered patio. While the bar is nothing fancy, it does offer inexpensive beer and a perfectly acceptable range of liquors. It doesn't seem to be a \"regulars\" sort of place, but I feel that it is an often overlooked place for a cheap, quiet drink.One great thing about this restaurant is the ice cream. There aren't a lot of places to go get a scoop of ice cream on a hot day, and this is an excellent choice.Lastly, it is very important to mention that this place is super family friendly.

Overall a very unique and delightful experience!"], ["Nolen G.", "Now that I have been to all of the obvious places on my Jackson Top 10 burger list, I am now running around hitting the outliers that folks tell me about that are \"really great\"This week's stop was Sal and Mookies.....yep, the pizza joint in Fondren. \u00a0The menu has 7 custom burgers on it. \u00a0I has an inside tip that the Satriale's burger was seriously good. \u00a0\"75% ground chuck & 25% hot Italian sausage \u00a0( 1/2 lb total), flat-top grilled and topped with prosciutto,Provolone, and saut\u00e9ed onions & peppers $9.95\"Since it has the pork in it, they will only cook it \"done\" so don't ask.Other than the fact that it was a bit dry from the \"done\" temperature, it was a really good burger. \u00a0The flavor of the patty with the sausage mix is really good. \u00a0The bun was good. \u00a0Not sweet, plenty moist.I liked the fact that I could substitute a Caesar for fries at no extra cost.I have been there quite a few times for Pizza and I always left feeling like I was a bit overcharged for what I got. \u00a0I think the burger and salad are a great value. \u00a0 Good portions of both burger and salad."], ["Ieisha E.", "Pizza wasn't all that. Great atmosphere. I love how there is a IceCream bar. I had Alfredo and it was pretty okay. My hub had some type of sub with fries and he really enjoyed it."], ["Paeton W.", "Cheese pizza was bland, as was pepperoni & sausage. Margaritas were dreadfully off. Lemon icebox cake was plain- not worth the calories. But the people with me made for great company & the waiter was pleasant. Will try something else next time though.:)"], ["Erica J.", "Pizza was great, server was very knowledgeable, quick service.Awesome atmosphere.***LEMON ICE BOX CAKE BROUGHT ME TO LIFE; \u00a0I NEED IT EVERYDAY!!!"], ["Chye M.", "Great NY Style pizza. We love the cheese pizza with half spinach & tomato and the other half Italian sausage & tomato. Really good food, KID FRIENDLY!! It's not cheap but you DO get what you pay for! The food is definitely worth the price. My kids and I absolutely LOVE this place!!"], ["Doug B.", "Great pizza - and this comes from a Chicago-deep-dish pizza fan - and even better service. Chris made the experience for us. He's a great sever and very knowledgable. \u00a0I would recommend everyone five this place a try. Ask for Chris as your server and tip him well."], ["J K.", "Was in Jackson for work and needed a good spot to catch the final half of the Saints game, get a beer and some tasty food...well Sal & Mookies fit the bill! \u00a0They had an excellent selection of beers on tap, I'm a sucker for new local brew...and well, of course the pizza was beyond awesome! \u00a0A great little joint I'll recommend to anyone headed to Jackson for whatever the reason!"], ["Eric G.", "I'd say 3.5 stars is a solid score for here. The service is without a doubt good. I really like New York style pizza and this place is better than most hole in the wall New York style pizza joints. We had garlic breadsticks and pepperoni pizza finished off with Spumoni. The garlic breadsticks were good not over bearing with garlic, however the marinara sauce had great flavor so I was looking forward to the pizza. We got the pizza and the crust was sweet, but I wish I could have tasted more of the sauce. The pizza wasn't too greasy as some New York styles are. The Spumoni ice cream was a nice way to finish off our lunch. This is a kid friendly place as they hand out wiki sticks for children to make designs and stick on the wall, for the adults they have a few draft beers available."], ["Coral E.", "Great place for delicious pizza (haven't found a specialty pizza I didn't like), great salads, pasta & paninis and great dessert. \u00a0My favorite thing to get is the Donald Trump panini with a caesar salad. \u00a0Yum!!! \u00a0Great service as well!"], ["Shakita R.", "Some of the best pizza I've ever had! Sal & Mookies provide a great family friendly atmosphere. The icing on the cake is the complete ice cream bar. Really enjoyed it."], ["Desmi L.", "Found this place on Yelp and by far the best meal I had in Jackson. Our server Chris was friendly and very helpful. I wish I knew I could get half/half pizzas. Oh well next time. Pizza was great, fresh toppings and the crust was awesome. We had the John Bleeker, grilled chicken w/sundried tomatoes and caramelized onions. Yummy! If your passing through don't skip this place."], ["Bob G.", "Enjoyed a nice evening with friends tonight at Sal & Mookie's. After a 20 minute wait for a table, which is pretty normal on a Friday night, we were seated in the side room, in a corner table... honestly, not the best spot for dinner. However, the table wasn't the priority, as a nice dinner with great friends was more important. I ordered my usual Meat Packing District Stromboli, which is great, and always more than I should eat in one seating. The service was great, as usual. Sal & Mookie's is always a great place to go."], ["Andrew K.", "This was my first experience with this place. I am sorry to say that it was a very average experience. I got half one specialty pizza and half other specialty pizza. (Can't remember the unique names) I got carry out and warmed it later. It actually looked better then when I picked it up. Don't even know how to describe the taste other than average - nothing special. I have had much better ny crusts around the country. Maybe I am spoiled because I do get to eat at dozens of restaurants like this one all over our great country. The best part of the experience was the cop out front who helped me park. Employees inside seemed just ok. Toss up if I will give these guys another shot. They do have a unique concept though."], ["Jericho C.", "This place freaking ROCKS! \u00a0Great food; great service; great music. \u00a0I did the ziti Alfredo with chicken and panchetta. \u00a0It was bananas!!!"], ["Eric P.", "Amazing pizza, courteous staff, and awesome ice cream selection are just a few of the things that will keep you coming back to Sal and Mookies!"], ["Stephanie T.", "Went for a special lunch with my daughter as this is one of her favorite places. Things were going well food and service-wise until we got up for ice cream. While we were up (5 minutes tops) an over zealous busboy cleaned off our table and it was given to someone else! We had some boxed up leftovers on the table which were thrown in the bus bin and covered in bus bin water. I caught the busboy (bus man) right before he walked away from our table and he very unapologetically handed them back to me, dripping. Talk about gross. The manager saw it all go down and didn't offer much beyond \"sorry\" and a new bag for my leftovers which I'm not really sure I want anymore since they've been through the nasty bus bin. I had to ask for a replacement drink for me while we finished eating. My daughter wasn't offered one. Thought I would at least get the ice cream comped or something for basically being shoved out and our leftovers ruined. Nope. Go for decent food but be wary of over zealous busboys and ineffective management."], ["Matt W.", "Being from Chicago, I was skeptical at first, but this place has really GOOD pizza. The service was fast and friendly. Josh was very polite, and had good suggestions. The manager was friendly and thankful for the positive comments. I would highly recommend checking out Sal & Mookies! ...Plus they have really fun toys for the kids!Oh, and the home-made mozzarella sticks were GREAT!"], ["Win B.", "In town for a soccer tournament. We had a large group of about 25. Excellent service given our size group. Good food. Great place for kids. Authentic New York style pizza."], ["Jon M.", "Excellent pizza and amazing ice cream."], ["S H.", "Tried this place several times and each time it gave us gas!!!- Must be uncooked dough or something...Skip unless you want your farts to smell like pizza."], ["Austin C.", "Wow, wow, wow. This pizza is amazing, good beer selection, and dessert that cannot be beat. Had a very friendly waitress who was able to help us out with our selections (it was good to know we could do a half and half specialty pizza). Got the meat packing district, and can not say enough good stuff about it. I made sure to leave a slice for the next day, but more so that I had room to try the pecan bar. Talk about amazing. It's like heaven, plain and simple. If only there was a place like this in Dallas, I'd be in trouble. Cannot reiterate enough, amazing pizza, amazing dessert, and a plentiful beer selection (featuring some local Lazy Magnolia!). If you're in the mood for any of the above, Sal and Mookie's is a great place to go."], ["Melia D.", "Hands down, Sal & Mookie's serves up the best pizza in Jackson. The crust is perfect: crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. My husband and I custom order our own pizza: cheese with roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, and goat cheese. We'd really like Sal & Mookie's to put this on the menu and name it after us. :)We're also fans of the CBGB's (Italian plum tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, roasted garlic, and red onions). The menu is so extensive that you're sure to find something you like. It's on the pricey side for casual dining -- around $25 for a large pizza -- but we consider it a worthwhile and regular splurge. Sal & Mookie's is a great place to have a birthday party; I've held one of my own and have attended two friends' parties here. The restaurant has a lively, colorful family atmosphere, and the ice cream bar offers a broad selection. Eating on the patio is pleasant when the weather is nice. You can also have drinks at the adjacent Pi(e) Lounge and order off the menu. This is one of my top five favorite restaurants in town."], ["Crystal H.", "This place was wonderful! \u00a0I will come back here any time I visit Jackson. \u00a0The service is super friendly, the food came out piping hot and really quickly. \u00a0The cocktails were priced just right and not skimpy on the booze. An overall fun place, with good people and great food."], ["S B.", "Good food and atmosphere. \u00a0It doesn't stand out though. \u00a0That's the reason for three stars. \u00a0It is a great restaurant to visit if you are in the Jackson area for a while."], ["Jennifer C.", "Decent NY style pizza, horrible pasta, not sure about the sandwiches, overpricedI agree with the previous poster. Prices are a bit much. They aren't as expensive as I thought they were after visiting NY and going to some pizza places up there, but then again the pizza is amazing up there. This place tries and actually does okay although they are a little sparse with their basil (they should just chop it up and put it on the pizza instead of whole leaves - 1 per slice). Also, the cheese is sparse if you order fresh moz.I'm not a fan of the manager either. The first time I went there he was actually kind of rude. So as much as I'd like to go back (although my husband thinks their pizza sucks) I doubt we'll be going that much. Pizza shak down the street has much better prices although admittedly, the pizzas are quite different. If you are really craving NY style pizza then this place should do the job. but then again, so would sbarro's if you're just looking for pepperoni."], ["Baron M.", "I could have sworn I already wrote something here, but I guess I didn't! Anyway, they have great food. I have not had anything bad here, ever. Maybe one day I had a few ice crystals in my ice cream, but that is as close to \"bad\" as I have seen. The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that the prices are very high for our area. Beer is priced high, pizza is priced high, entrees are priced high! It is all great quality though (well, the beer is beer, they aren't making it any more special) and you can feed two people on one pizza, so I can't complain that much."], ["Joshua S.", "This place has some awesome pizza! \u00a0My personal tastes are a little boring (limited to meat/cheese for the toppings) but friends of mine are more experimental and seem to love nearly every pizza they come up with. \u00a0The ice cream is incredibly good as well. \u00a0The full bar adds a nice touch. \u00a0My wife loves the \"Uptown Barbie.\" \u00a0The only drink I don't recommend ordering from Sal and Mookie's is a mojito. \u00a0I've tried it a few times and it is consistently far too sugary.On every occasion the waiters/waitresses have been very friendly and timely, and the orders have always been correct. \u00a0That always helps."], ["Jeff R.", "Great spot with wonderful outdoor seating. Great menu - pizza are fantastic."], ["Kate W.", "I want to give it a good review because I'm a fan of bravo and broad street... But this pizza is not new York style pizza. I really wish it were, but there is a huge difference in new York and this pizza. The dough is kinda tough. And if they had a brick oven, it would taste so much better."], ["Darci B.", "I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but I can't...their prices are particularly high. Their food is excellent, but I'm not sure $12 for a Stromboli is worth it.I got the chipotle chicken BBQ Stromboli because it was different, and man, was it good!My husband got the Cuban sandwich and has previously had the chicken parmigiana. \u00a0They were both good, but not GREAT. I haven't tried their pizza, because I can't see paying $25 for a large pizza.The atmosphere is good and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.We will probably go back, but not anytime soon."], ["Dawn O.", "One of my common hot spots! Food is great, drinks are pretty good & the atmosphere is laid back & sociable. Great place to meet up with friends. The 4 Train (with chicken) pizza is awesome! Don't be afraid to try it! I also like the Zydeco & the CBGBs pizzas."], ["Annica J.", "I just wish they were open on Mondays. \u00a0Get the chicken wings for sure! \u00a0Everything that we have tasted has been a huge hit and of course the kids love the ice cream bar."], ["Dale J.", "Excellent food & service! Flexible on adding to or taking from their set pizza toppings. Great tastes. A must try if you're in the Jackson, MS area!!! For great service, Ask for Lorianna's area."], ["Herman S.", "The atmosphere of the place is a good vibe. I really dig the Muffaletta Panini (muffaletta on the thin, pressed-grilled, focaccia bread). I wish they offered a cardboard grease catcher like in the bottom of a Pizza Hut box to absorb any grease from their Pizza. Everytime I've ordered any pizza with meat it's served on a metal pizza pan and once cut the grease collects on the pizza pan and thus continually soaks into the crust of the pizza, making the crust saturated with grease. I've much prefer it if they had some sort of grease catcher between pizza and pan. The ice cream is ok, not great. \u00a0The large kitchen windows are great for kids to watch their pizza's being made."], ["Scott M.", "We're visiting from Georgia and visited Sal and Mookies after reading Yelp review. \u00a0All I can say is wow! \u00a0Everything from the salads to the pizza was the best we've had since leaving New England. The service was spot on and the entire staff made us feel welcome. \u00a0Oh and by the way......try their cheese cake too."], ["Alan S.", "I may not be giving Sal and Mookie's the credit they deserve. \u00a0It's got a great atmosphere with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and they serve a good variety of draft beers (yet they were out of 4 or 5 of the 10+ drafts available). \u00a0The service was excellent and the food is great. \u00a0Menu is a bit overwhelming, but it's got plenty of options. The problem with this place is that the prices are ridiculous. \u00a0I mean come on... Six bucks for a pint of beer--yeah right. \u00a0And I don't care what you put on a pizza, if your ingredients cost your customers 20 bucks or more for regular size pie, that's not legit."], ["Mark S.", "I like this place. \u00a0Very kid friendly. \u00a0Great service. \u00a0Pizza was really good. \u00a0Very relevant menu choices. \u00a0Not just the same old topping combos."], ["Amy L.", "Good pizza and great sandwiches, but you can find equally as good in town and not nearly as expensive. \u00a0Wait staff is friendly and attentive."], ["DeTria T.", "If you are craaaaaaaaaving ice cream like I was, this place would not be my first choice, HOWEVER, it is a very nice restaurant with a great vibe. \u00a0I loved the way I felt walking in, the friendly staff and the way that it is decorated. \u00a0I would definitely eat a regular meal there, but I don't plan on going back for the ice cream."], ["Shannon N.", "Great extensive menu, but extremely disappointing.My first visit to Sal & Mookies was not spectacular, but it was not unpleasant altogether, so I thought I wold give it another try just so I could form a more valid opinion on my own experience here.The atmosphere is clean and cozy, not too bright and not dark where I would have to squint to see the menu. \u00a0Always a good sign. \u00a0The menu is great, full of options for choices to choose from.Our server quickly mentioned he is new to the job, so he had to ask his manager a few quick questions about some things on the menu that we asked about. \u00a0He had kept our water glasses filled, and even checked on us often while we had waited our food. \u00a0Great server for someone who is new on the job.However, our pizzas had taken well over 50 minutes to arrive, and were both not hot. \u00a0One was the Riker's Island pizza, turned out to be luke warm, and the other was the Arthur Avenue, not even warm at all. \u00a0The roasted eggplant on the Avenue was not exactly roasted, whereas it was completely burnt. \u00a0The salad, which we had ordered as an appetizer, had come out the same time as the pizzas. \u00a0The first time we had visited this restaurant was not long after they had opened a few years ago. \u00a0The service was quite good then, but the food was mediocre. \u00a0I thought my judgement then was a bit too quick at that time, especially since they had recently opened then and may have needed to so some quick adjustments like all new restaurants.All I can say is kudos to the customer service, but blech on the food."]]}
