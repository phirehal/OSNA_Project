The food is good and there is lots of variety between steak, seafood, and pasta. I can eat a whole basket of the bread and the dipping oil and spices they give you for the bread is excellent.Service is always decent, and sometimes very good. No complaints about that at all.My only complaint is the prices. Even from a year ago prices have drastically increased while the serving sizes have shrunk greatly. My Mom got the lobster tail and steak combo, the lobster must have been a midget because the length of the tail was about the size of the *short* side of a dollar bill. My favorite, the Chicken Trio has shrunk from three whole breasts to three half breasts all while the price increased by about 1/3 from about a year ago. The salads are smaller than they used to be. The side dishes are more limited, you used to get a choice of spaghetti or cavatappi, (wasn't there even a 3rd no-charge pasta choice at one time?) or garlic mash potato. Now you get cavatappi or mashed potatoes. Total was $100 for four people, water to drink, and no appetizers.

At the very least I won't repeat my visit to them often. But here in the world of Lansing, most restaurants are chains and the ones that are not don't always stick around long.This Carrabba's is a different story. I'll head here with the significant other to share a bottle of wine and nice fire grilled pizza on a semi regular basis. The staff/service is always excellent and they are extremely accommodating. My favorite pizza, four cheese, is not on the menu any more but they are always more than happy to make it. The wine list is pretty good and the server always makes a good recommendation.I think eating at Carrabba's is all about know what to order on the menu. If you're not sure what is good, ask the server. They should be able to point you in the right direction.**Try the sausage and lentil soup. It is AMAZING!**"], ["H M.", "Went to this restaurant for a birthday dinner and the service was terrible. Our server spent the entire time complaining about having to serve 18 people, which clearly set a very negative tone for the entire dinner. When a few extra people showed up we placed their names on the waiting list for the next available table, and after being seated, they were promptly harassed by another server. He demanded to know why they had been seated when there were others waiting for seats and when we tried to explain that we had placed our names on the waiting list and had NOT gotten the table ahead of anyone else, he continued arguing with us. We finally spoke to the hostess and cleared up the situation. After waiting 30 minutes for a someone to serve the table, we once again had to speak to the hostess, who assigned us another server.The food was great but the blatantly rude and insulting waiters will keep me from dining at this location ever again."], ["Miss P.", "Although it is a chain, I did expect a little more of an Italian experience than I have received. The ambiance and style is super dull. Not to sound repetitive but the service did exceed my expectations by far. As for the food & drink:- mixed drinks were the weakest i'd probably ever seen. - crab cakes delicious, excellent texture- canneloni's were not fresh and probably microwaved (as another mentioned about the lasagna!). - calamari was frozen too and seasoning was way too overpowering. Rather expensive for not such a great outcome. Only because of others' reviews i just MIGHT give it another shot."], ["Liza P.", "I'm a fan of Carrabba's, but this location is a hot mess.

But that didn't stop me from giving this place a try because I have friends who rave about their pizza and chicken.It was around eight o'clock when we arrived, but still relatively busy. If we didn't have reservations we would have waited about half an hour. The atmosphere is similar to any Italian chain, in fact, I'd put it at the same level as an Olive Garden by strictly aesthetic appeal. However, the food, is much better. At Carrabba's they bring out warm loaves of bread and a plate of garlic to mix with olive oil. Most entrees are served with a soup or salad. I opted for the Italian salad which was topped with the perfect amount of dressing and fresh tasting kalamata olives. My entree, the chicken marsala, comes as either a small or regular. A small is just half a chicken breast, so pay the two extra bucks and get the regular. Considering $16 gets you bread, salad, a side (spaghetti, vegetable, or mashed potatoes) it's an OK price. My marsala was absolutely delicious though. The mushrooms and sauce only complimented the flavor of the grilled chicken breast. The side green beans were cooked in olive oil and had a nice crunch to them, not at all soggy. Plus, our entire party even got free chocolate sundaes because we were celebrating a birthday. The service was excellent and the food was delicious- not bad for a chain."], ["Su S.", "My go-to pasta place. They will mix and match anything bc it's all fresh!

Carrabba's is from the people who bring you Outback Steakhouse and a few other small chains. It's certainly situated a solid rung or two above the Olive Garden on the \"Italian Chain Restaurant\" ladder, and it shows in every dish I've tried. The basics, like manicotti, spaghetti, and ravioli are excellent, and the signature dishes are even better. It's quiet enough to have a good conversation, and you feel relaxed where you do not have to hurry through your meal, unlike in other chains where you sit elbow-to-elbow with other tables, and the emphasis is on turnover, not dining.The only complaint I have is that on one occasion a meal was served too cold to a member of our party, but that was fixed and taken off our bill without any prompting on our part. So this location has great food, and the customer service is excellent as well.If I'm going to spend money on italian food it had better be decent, and Carrabba's does not disappoint.

Also with the purchase of beverage, our table got a monstrous colander of popcorn. \u00a0The local's will rave that the pizza is best in town, but I'd say its the best bar pizza in town. Art's additionally has a full menu comparable with other bars in the area. The curly fires a great, and the potato skins were quite good as well (albeit steak fries made from the skins of potatoes).

She wasn't rude and I really don't have any complaints about her, but I wouldn't say she was cheery or friendly. We each got a pizza and split an onion ring basket. The rings came a short bit later and were pretty good with a nice light tempura like beer batter. Mildly oily, but quite good. \u00a0The pizzas came, and as another reviewer had mentioned it was moist. I wouldn't say soggy, but once you have a slice out you do have to tilt the pan to help it drain a bit. This isn't really an issue in my eyes as it sometimes happens with pizza on a pan. No biggie. I couldn't definitively tell whether the dough was homemade or not, but it was good dough regardless. But the toppings were the money shot. The bacon is the thick cut crispy, crumbly kind (yum!) and the Italian Sausage is real deal sausage links busted up and spread around. The pepperoni and cheese both seem to be of a good quality. A tasty pizza, indeed. \u00a0Not something I'm gonna drive 45 minutes out of my way for, but would definitely order again should the occasion arise.

We found out from a waitress whizzing by. We seated ourselves, and waited 15 minutes to even be noticed by a waitress who'd been in and out of the room several times. She informed us that they were short staffed and took our drink order. I ordered a Merlot and my husband ordered a Bud Light, one of the few beers they had on tap. My wine tasted old. And I immediately noticed the pink lipstick mark on my dirty glass!!! My husbands glass had a never disappearing ring of grime which he kept wiping and making worse. Even after he took a napkin to it, it didn't go away. After cautiously sipping our drinks for another 20 minutes, someone finally came to take our food order, we ordered from the 8.99 lunch menu, I ordered the chicken parmesan, and my husband ordered the veal parmesan. Both came with one side. He ordered the chili, which he said he enjoyed, and I ordered the salad. My salad consisted of iceberg lettuce which was wet, two cherry tomatoes, and a few really hard croutons, the ranch was runny which resulted in a white cloudy puddle in the bottom of the bowl. And there were several large drops of Italian dressing running from the edge to the inside of my salad. I ordered ranch.

Personally I don't have that many special occasions and my going out preference is #2. The first time I went here it was so packed, we sat at a table in the bar.

I'd say this stuff is good. Pastas, pizzas, meatballs etc. You get a lot of food and the meals come with sides. The only minor dislike is the bread basket they bring out. I do like the packaged breadsticks (dipped in butter of course), but there's some kind of weird plain toasted bread in the basket that just seems like its ready to be ground into bread crumbs.

I was very pleasantly surprised and will be back."], ["Jenny C.", "I wanted a burger so stopped in for take out. \u00a0The burger was a bit subpar generally - no real flavor and over cooked. \u00a0I thought since it was takeout and the restaurant more an Italian place, I'd give it another chance. \u00a0I went it with some friends. \u00a0Service was friendly and just fine. I had some sort of dish with white sauce. \u00a0I could barely eat it due to the high salt level. \u00a0wow. \u00a0Took most of it home but it seemed even saltier upon being warmed up. \u00a0Luckily the dog wasn't so picky."], ["Catherine G.", "The food was awful. I can't believe there was a wait to get a table at this place! Service was fine, but fairly slow and certainly not spectacular.My boyfriend ordered the lasagna, which they advertised on their sign outside. It had pepperoni inside, which worried him, but he gave it a try. Not good.I sampled the onion rings, which I do have to give them credit for. They are really thick, beer-battered and really greasy, but good. \u00a0Their ranch is also \"good ranch.\"But my steak was horrible. Completely over-cooked (I asked for medium well and it was dried out and almost impossible to eat.) There was no sauce or juice of any kind. It came with broccoli, which was just boiled and thrown on the plate. No seasoning, they barely bothered to cut it into manageable pieces.They only have three beers on tap - Bud, Bud Light and Labbatt's, I think. \u00a0The place is dark and crowded and not a pleasant dining experience."], ["Steve T.", "In general, I think this place is trying to live on the reputation of what was \"Casa Nova\". \u00a0Years ago, the old Casa Nova had great pizza. \u00a0Lots of high quality cheese, etc. \u00a0The rest of their food was pretty tasty as well. \u00a0The name might be the same. \u00a0The food isn't."], ["Lorraine H.", "I thought the lasagna was Stouffer's frozen microwave. Really lousy. Cold in the middle. The pizza's okay. This place is not recommended by me."], ["Anne H.", "Awful. I guess they don't believe in bussing tables. Slow service and bland pre-packaged microwaved food."], ["Iris S.", "Actually, I don't think of this place as gourmet at all, but I do believe that for the price, you are getting a good deal. \u00a0The bf and I went a couple of times when we still lived in the area and it really isn't that bad. \u00a0The pizza is pretty tasty and he was brave enough to try the steak, but I didn't try it. \u00a0The service has always been friendly and the place crowded with diners. \u00a0It is what it is, as my mom says. \u00a0If you want classy, check out the Knight Cap, otherwise the value here for a light wallet is quite reasonable."]], "Marco's Pizza": []}
