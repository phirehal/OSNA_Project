Not too busy, but just enough to let you know that people like this place. A good sign! Being a first timer, I was a little confused, but a quick assessment of the interior workings identified it as a counter-service restaurant. The counter and ordering area even had a helpful list of definitions used, albeit on the opposite wall from the menu. Luckily, I already knew most of the definitions, and used it more as a self-assessing trivia game. =) I opted for the Shwarma \"box\", the standard of which is chicken. If you're not familiar with \"shwarma\", its a spit-grilled, spiced meat that's either shredded or shaved for serving. It can be just about any kind of meat; goat, lamb, beef, chicken, turkey, veal, etc. This shwarma is spiced, shredded, chicken. If you order this meal, it comes standard with a Mediterranean lettuce salad, the creamiest hummus I've ever had, and tasty rice. No substitutions with this particular order, but that's cool with me. I also ordered a side of falafel; always a good benchmark on which to judge Mediterranean restaurants. Each table gets a basket of taboon/pita/lafah (flat!) bread. The food is brought out to your table quickly, which is great if you're pressed for time on your lunch hour, or half-hour. After diving in, I quickly determined the entire meal, including the falafels, to be excellent. I was going to write, \"for counter service\", but this food is excellent by any standard. I think they would make a killing by opening up a Mediterranean fine dining establishment. Great food, excellent prices, outstanding service, all coupled with a bright, airy atmosphere.

The mujadra, baba ghanouj, tabouli and falafel were amazing. Once you have those donw you can pretty much get away with not great tasting everything else.

They updated the order counter and it looks so nice and much more complete now. The food is still good and service is great. The weather was nice so I sat outside this time and it was great. The only thing I was confused on was I thought the garlic dip was included with the meal but they charged me a quarter a piece this time.

They had chickpeas which was different but not quite great. They lack full robust flavor of brine and lemon. They weren't gross but they weren't anything else either. Also they were half empty. Pack in more rice and add tomatoes please!The second visit I dined in. I ordered a juice and schawarma (sp.). I'm so used to ordering a chicken schawarma (sp.) as a wrap that when served on a platter I almost felt foreign. The chicken was well flavored. Shredded and mixed with what looks like a stew of spices I sat back and enjoyed it. It was a little on the dry side but not lacking in flavor by far. I had the baklava twice and both experiences were insipid. No pistachios. :-/The hummus was also too mild for me. Turn the garlic up a notch.My juice was it. I've had two and both were made fresh, fast and had great flavor. This place should focus on serving these, this is what they do VERY well.I'll be back but mostly for juice."], ["Gary H.", "I came in for lunch and got a shish kafta combo. The hummus was a bit bland, but the shish kafta was absolutely top-notch, very nearly home-cooking-good, and I say this as someone whose had multiple chances to eat with Lebanese families. My only real complaint is that the only bread I got with my meal was one dinner roll and one small pita- come on, for a combo you need a bowl of pita. The authentic way to eat is to pinch the food with scraps of pita, and there wasn't enough pita to even get through my hummus. But that's my only complaint. Lansing is a city rife with good Mediterranean, and Zaytoon is a worthy addition. It's not the cheapest, but some of its food is in the running for the very best, so it's worth a try. Definitely recommended if you like the grilled meats- I can't wait to have that kafta again. If this place keeps refining its food, and if they get some flavor into that hummus, they'll be legendary."], ["Sammi D.", "I can't say enough about this place...the food was amazing and the staff was awesome!

We looked at the menu online and put our order in as soon as we sat down, even before we ordered drinks. This ensured we got our drinks, then appetizer, then pizza all right after one another. Don't get me wrong- the pizza was really good, but the Firey spinach and artichoke dip we had as an appetizer was absolutely amazing- I ended up eating the last bite with a spoon, it was that good! We ate at Pizza House on a Friday night before a huge Big Ten game, and while the atmosphere was fun and there were lots of people there, it was not rowdy. I felt like I could eat my pizza in a fun atmosphere, not an uncomfortable one.

It really depends on how much time I'm willing to dedicate to pizza making and how quickly I want it. Obviously the deep dish will take much longer, usually around 25 minutes just to cook. If you're in a rush, they have other goodies to try, so no need to worry.What I also like is that when ordering for larger groups of people, they have delivery option for almost everything! So if you have someone in your group who doesn't care for pizza, they can order a burger. My final pro? Great food and delivered up to 4am. I used to work on campus in a job that was overnight. I would always get quick and hot service for them ordering up to 4am, it was great.My cons? I recently moved to Columbus, OH and I don't have pizza house here?

After much debate, we decided on a hawaiian thin crust and an italian meats Chicago deep dish. Our bruschetta came out and it was not what we expected. The bread was cut thickly and was buttered and toasted and then the cheese/portobello mixture came out in a dish. We gamely placed some of the mixture on the bread - it tasted good but it was a bit skimpy on the portobellos.So pizza next. Wasn't expecting green olives on the Hawaiian - it added saltiness to the pizza that was okay, but I definitely could have done without it.

I used to love Olga's back in my school days, but this experience was pretty terrible.

Either my tastes are becoming more refined as I age (not likely given how much I enjoy Chinese take-out and Taco Bell) or these places are getting worse.So, let's start off with the good: SNACKERS! The snackers--grilled and seasoned bits of Olga's pita bread--and cheese dip continue to be amazing. Olga's pita bread in any form is good, but snackers alone are reason enough to stop in here, even if you don't order anything else. Now onto the bad...for starters, Olga's kind of seems like what you'd get if Applebee's decided to open a chain of Greek cuisine themed restaurants. It's not authentic and I don't get the sense they are trying to be. But the whole pseudo-Greek vibe comes off as a little contrived/forced. I ordered an Original Olga sandwich, side salad, and of course snackers. The lettuce in the salad was limp and soggy, indicating that at best it had been pre-dressed and left in the fridge, and at worst was full of old lettuce on the verge of rotting. The Olga sandwich (also known as a gyro in any place not Olga's) was lukewarm and the meat seemed like it was frozen. To top it all off I got really sick to my stomach immediately after eating here. For fast food greek-diner type stuff you can do a lot better. I wish their bread sucked so I could fully hate this place and swear it off forever.

She endured gastrointestinal motility problems for many years, eventually coming to the conclusion that all of her problems were due to the food that she was forced to eat every day for nourishment.Finding such hatred for food, Olga sought revenge. She began a line of pseudo-Greek restaurants where the cooks were instructed to cut every corner in the preparation of dishes, and the menu writer was given free reign to price the meals as high as possible. The result is our modern Olga's Kitchen chain. An \"olga,\" made of imitation SPAM, is priced at $7, and comes with nothing. A side of fries are an extra $2, and cola another $2. The food is on par with a poorly run McDonald's, but diners are forced to wait for Waitresses to serve them, making Olga's the most inconvenient restaurant possible.Go there if you must, but you've been warned."], ["Louise W.", "Oh, I wish I'd read James C.'s review ahead of time. I went to the Olga's Kitchen in the Meridian Mall in Okemos. In my defense, I was waiting for a movie, I was hungry, and I didn't really want anything deep fried. Besides, I'd never heard of Olga's Kitchen and I admit I was intrigued. When the food came, I was completely bewildered. My vegetarian sandwich was a kind of pita pocket (sorry, \"Olga bread\") filled with tinned Asian vegetables such as water chestnuts, no sauce, and a side of.... yogurt. Undoubtedly one of the weirdest combinations I've ever had. And no - it wasn't very good."]], "Panera Bread": [], "Zeus Greecian Island": [["Javier C.", "I wish I could give 3.5 stars.I tried the chicken hummus plate.Hummus was creamy and tasty but the chicken was dry. \u00a0The rice pilaf is what you'd expect.The Greek salad and dressing was above average. \u00a0The baklava is pretty good.I was disappointed that they didn't make feta fries but maybe that's a Chicago thing??? \u00a0I was staying in a hotel down the road"], ["Robert K.", "Exactly what you would expect from a Greek diner.Good food at a reasonable price.The banana pancakes are bananas good."], ["Daniell B.", "This is a great little Coney island style diner on the south side of Lansing. \u00a0The food here is yummy. \u00a0I pretty much always get the gyro supreme. It is loaded with gyro meat (cooked perfectly!), lettuce, tomatoes, onion, tons of feta, and my favorite.. the cucumber sauce! \u00a0I just can't get enough of it!! \u00a0I usually hit the drive thru on my lunch break, as I only have 30 minutes, so I cannot really comment on the service inside. \u00a0The people at the window are always pleasant and the food is always fast and fresh. \u00a0I have been coming here for 3 years not and have not been disappointed yet. \u00a0I will continue to eat here as it is one of the best places on the south side in my opnion."], ["Drew P.", "Decent food but it will cost you.

Gyros are also tasty, but \"gyro sauce\" is a disgrace to all Greeks. It tastes very watered down, if you're into that. I used to be a frequent customer, but I have to say I will never go back unless I pick food up to go. The service is horrible, especially the \"host\" that chomped on her gum and didn't say anything to us as she brought us to our table. She then threw our menus down and walked away, saying nothing or even acknowledging that we thanked her for her \"great hospitality\". Last time we were there, about 2 weeks ago, the owner was overheard, in the middle of the restaurant, telling a waitress \"if they don't like it tell them to get the hell out.\" Overall, terrible service."], ["Chelsea M.", "Excellent Gyros and speedy service. \u00a0I can call ahead with my lunch order and pick it up from the drive thru. \u00a0I'm not usually much for drive thru anything but these gyros are worth it.I've also gone in for lunch. \u00a0The service was pleasant, restaurant clean, and the food was tasty.I typically order the Gyro Supreme with out lettuce. \u00a0Only without lettuce because I don't eat lettuce. \u00a0It comes with lamb, beef, tomatoes, onions, feta, and qyro sauce. \u00a0Yum!"], ["Chris B.", "I rated this place based on service.

We ordered a gyro that came with sweet potato fries and the lamb shank meal. Everything tasted great and really well prepared. They were busy, but the service was still fast and friendly.

Plus, it's clean and has quick service."], ["Holly N.", "My dad occasionally likes to take me here for breakfast. It's pretty good for the area and for the other options. Everything is very standard.
