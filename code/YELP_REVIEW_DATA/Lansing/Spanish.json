{"Zarzuela": [], "Logan Restaurant": [["Blair R.", "I just had a delicious dinner at Logan! I heard so many great things about Logan, so I knew I had to go. I think the bar was set too high (I can't give Logan 5 stars) but it was a fantastic dinner and definitely among the best I have had in Ann Arbor. We skipped appetizers tonight and for me personally, none of the apps. are that tempting. However, the chef did bring out an awesome butternut squash soup with truffle oil. It was a great way to start dinner -- thick and rich but not too heavy.For my main I ordered the sustainable seafood selection which was Mahi Mahi over a bed of quinoa, tomato infused with ginger and a grapefruit reduction. Loved the sauce on this dish and it felt light, relatively healthy but satisfying. I would happily order it again. I also sampled the lamb and scallops, which were well done.Dinner is also served with warm biscuits, which are pretty addicting and flaky. The biscuits didn't come until well in the meal but that is probably why they are warm. It was my friend's b-day so Logan offered a complementary dessert which was meh. It was probably our fault since we chose the brownie with bacon and pistachio ice cream. I've never had bacon in my dessert before even though I see it all the time and now I know not to order it again. The bacon pretty much ruined the awesome ice cream. Logan is the kind of place I'll return to for celebrations or if I have special visitors aka my parents."], ["Matt R.", "We tried Logan on a whim, and were not disappointed. \u00a0Our server, Melissa, was very friendly and knowledgable. Her suggestions of the duck breast special, along with the vinsanto were spot on. \u00a0The owner came over several times to check on us, and to talk about the vinsanto.I got the wild boar bolognese, which was right on par with a similar dish I had years ago in Tuscany. \u00a0My girlfriend got the duck breast special, served over a bed of spaetzle, which was delicious. \u00a0The food was a definite 5 out of 5. The atmosphere was relaxed, but it was somewhat loud as other reviewers have said. The service was excellent on all levels. \u00a0I saw multiple reviewers commenting about this place being too expensive - this is an upscale restaurant, comparable to ones in downtown Chicago or New York. \u00a0You pay for what you get, and it was worth every penny. We will be back soon, and cannot wait!"], ["Chad W.", "I was incredibly happy with the food here. My wife and I came here for our anniversary and celebrated with the tasty cheese trio followed by the Perch Tempura for me and the cauliflower with taragon and pea sauce for my wife. The perch was probably the best seafoody entre I've ever had. It was a sweet sauce (maybe tamarind) and absolutely delicious. The service was great. I doc it a star for the in restaurant atmosphere (see other reviews) though if we had eaten outside it may have been a 5."], ["Amy M.", "The food at Logan is good, fine but not exceptional. It's the service that has me not planning to go back.Our party of 6 arrived a few minutes early for our 7:30 reservation. The group dining at our table lingered for a while so we waited at the bar. At 8:00, my friend (who is visibly pregnant, btw) asked about the table and was told they were waiting for the other diners to leave. We saw no attempt on the servers part to move the diners along, nor did they offer us complementary drinks or appetizers. They also didn't move things around and seat us elsewhere. We were finally seated around 8:20 and ordered our dinner at 8:30.I feel like the management at Logan had a great opportunity to provide excellent service by either comping an appetizer while we were waiting or offering one once we were seated. Neither happened. The server was nice enough, staff apologized for the delay but I expect more from a restaurant as expensive as Logan. First time there for most of us, probably the last."], ["Li C.", "The food is deeeee-lish! I had the Wild Boar pasta as an entree. If you double the \"course\" portion, it becomes an entree.

Glad I had it because the prices are pretty expensive, but Logan is a great treat for that special occasion or special someone."], ["Jaye K.", "Went for the first time last night and had a great experience. Walked in too casually dressed for my taste, but we were rained out of our planned event. Still, without a rez, we were taken to the prime window seat and my bf joked wait until they see the coupon!Waitress was really pleasant and the food was delicious. I had the perch and bf had the cauliflower. Enough to eat without feeling stuffed. Pretty spendy, but worth it for a Friday night out. Oh, and the waitress didn't even react when bf pointed out the coupon.Looking forward to another visit to sample different menu/drink items!"], ["Allen L.", "A great little restaurant that pays attention to the details.They have an expertly chosen wine selection and Kevin knows everything he puts on the list. \u00a0I have had some spectacular wines here and always something surprising. \u00a0They also serve well made cocktails with great ingredients that actually make sense.The menu changes just enough seasonally. \u00a0Some of the appetizers are inspired - the gruyere \"custard\", the baked mussels, the crab and avocado come to mind. \u00a0We have leaned more to pastas for entrees. \u00a0The clam linguine and boar bolognese were wonderfully light. \u00a0I'd avoid the gnocchi - way too heavy for me.Service has always been top notch. \u00a0Occasionally the kitchen seems to be slow when it's busy. \u00a0The price of success!Really nice dining room - linen table cloth, etc. \u00a0I do my best to bring down the dress curve."], ["Miri Kwon R.", "Good food, HORRIBLE service, and debatable priceTheir menu (as mentioned by others) is rather limited thought the wine/drink menu was pretty extensive. The space/ambiance is more minimal then romantic or beautiful. WARNING: their pasta portions are really small (almost like tapas dishes). We ordered- Crab & Avocado salad: surprisingly my favorite dish of the day. Refreshing, light, with an interesting mustard-y sauce- Bolognes Pasta: heard great things... but it was just okay. - Goat cheese truffles ravioli: Bit too pungent for me (personally not a huge fan of goat cheese... others may love it)- Thai scallops: Scallops and mashed potato dipped in thai curry sauce! Delish - Lamb dish(forget the name): Good flavor, though the lamb was a bit dryAgain, food was great. Albeit a bit pricy, I thought the dishes were all interesting, creative, and very delicious. Service is where I have real problem with. Our server was incredibly unresponsive, intrusive, and down right RUDE.One of the girls came late. It took him more than 10 minutes to come back to take the order for her after he's given her the menu. He had trouble explaining some of the sides, and tried to take away our dishes before we were done. But the final draw was when we tried to pay. We had a coupon (restaurant.com had a deal), four credit cards, and an opentable check (annoying, I know. But this is a highend restaurant!), and our server gave a loud exasperated sigh that was clearly audible to the entire table. It instantly damped our mood, and what could've been a perfectly lovely evening was ruined. Other people at the restaurant (our hostess, sommelier) were all really helpful and friendly, but the table service was horrible. I don't think we are ever going back to this restaurant again.

The food here is excellent. We had the crab and avocado appetizer, which was really good. We followed the advice of other reviewers and tried the boar pasta and the duck confit entrees which were both very tasty. Some of the dishes are pretty pricey, but that seems to be the norm in Ann Arbor. The decor here is definitely a bit strange. It's kind of cold and outdated. The service was pretty poor. Our server might have said two words to us during our entire meal. She didn't mess anything up, but she definitely didn't make us feel welcome either.

We had a gift certificate to dine here so gift balance was removed from our bill. When we looked at our bill, our sever had drawn a star next to the original total price on the original bill, then she wrote out the original price once again on the signing bill along with a written note of what 18% tip would be calculated down to the penny for us. Do you think we don't know how to tip? And since when do servers dictate how much tip they are entitled to? 18% minimum is required for a party of 6 or more at this restaurant, but there was no minimum requirement for a party of 2. For a restaurant that aims to \"higher end,\" I found this to be snarky, passive aggressive and very NOT classy as well as insulting. So much for enjoying our dinner here with a gift certificate. I'm sure not going to buy anyone else a gift certificate from here and this will probably be my first and last time here.Food wise - it was good. We had the avocado crab salad which was good to share between two people. We also shared the bolognese pasta (which is quite a large portion for an appie) and the duck. The duck was delicious, maybe slightly too salty, and I loved how it was accented by the grapes. We skipped out on sweets as we were already really full. The biscuits that come along with your dinner could be better - it lacked taste and flavor. It was also a bit dry and not buttery enough.But like I said, I go out to eat for an enjoyable and memorable time. With service like that, there are PLENTY of other options in a city like Ann Arbor that's known for it's array of good eats."], ["Kristen C.", "We celebrated our 13th anniversary at Logan. We both give the experience 5 stars. The food and the personal service is what made it truly outstanding. We had a wine pairing with each course and staff took the time to describe and note our taste profiles. The clientele was definitely in the higher incomes, but I am sure there are other people like us who are not of the higher incomes, but do like to spend a pretty penny on special occasions.

First, you do not come here for decor or service. And, as to abolish any preconceived notion, this is not your Americanized spicy \"Mexican\" food. Sabor Latino is DELICIOUSLY mild, yet complex dishes most typical of Venezuela and Cuba. So, if not familiar with this cuisine, what can you expect? Probably the most properly cooked rice that I have eaten since living in Costa Rica, and rich, slowly cooked shredded meats. The garnishes are simple - delicious beans, shredded lettuce, and tomato, usually supplemented with another regional starch. The food is truly a delightful and authentic departure from other restaurants in the area. Attend with an open mind and palate. You will be happily surprised!"], ["Janice L.", "I was hesitant to come here after reading bad reviews. \u00a0However, my friends convinced me to join them for Taco Tuesday.I absolutely LOVED my experience! On Tuesdays the tacos are only $1 each and they tasted pretty good. I would suggest getting hard shell because these come with more toppings. (I love the cilantro!) For choice of meat, i like pastor (marinated pork) and chicken. I didn't like fried pork that much. Overall, I would recommend the $1 tacos.The free chips and salsa was ok... nothing spectacular.I also explored other items in the menu. I tried pabellon criollo ($14). This dish comes with shredded beef, black beans, \u00a0rice, \u00a0and fried plantains with melted cheese. I did not like the beef--it was too salty. On the other hand, \u00a0the fried plaintains with melted cheese was absolutely DELICIOUS! The cheese balanced the sweetness of the plantains perfectly! I ended up ordering more of these. \u00a0The fried plantains with the melted cheese is not listed separately on the menu and is only served in the dish \"pabellon criollo.\" However, if you tell the server that you only want the fried plantains from the dish, they can do that for you. I also tried the plantains they sell on the menu. It was $3.50 and very mediocre. I only recommend the fried plantain with melted cheese from the pabellon criollo dish. The fried icecream and the churro were delicious! The churro was served warm and fresh.

The 10th person cancelled her card before getting a fraudulent charge, to be safe. One person in our party had a card that he only used one time at this place, so there's no doubt in my mind that the cards were stolen here.We went to the management to let them know what was going on and they did not seem to care or take our concerns seriously. Either they don't care or they're in on it.Consider yourself warned.

After five visits ,with three of them being simply atrocious and two visits that bordered on the feeling of blah, I have come to the realization that this place is far better in theory than in practice. Focusing on the last visit of Tuesday, which resulted in a total waste of time and required my lunch-time nourishment to be sought elsewhere, I will never step foot into this place again no matter how many co-workers plead and no matter the price-inducing special they advertise. Lets begin the food review with the very simple, yet seemingly impossible task of ordering a beverage. I asked for a water with lemon and an iced tea. The water arrived with no ice and I was told they were out of lemons. About ten minutes later the iced tea arrived and was pretty much a glass of brown sludge with a sour taste and smell. When the waitress finally came back she stated \"I told them the tea was bad, sorry.\"After ordering the soft tacos with a side of rice and receiving three hard tacos with both rice and beans, I advised the food runner that I must have gotten someone else's order. A small debate ensued that resulted in my being told that I was wrong with what I though I ordered, and that I received the correct order. \u00a0HUH?!?!?!? Well, ok, if you insist.When our original server finally came back to the table she apologized and offered to have the correct order made, by then nearly forty-five minutes had gone by and I was needed in court. When the bills finally came, my bill was for full price. One bill was for the wrong amount, and another bill was oddly divided into three separate bills. Bizarre. When mixed with the other less than pleasing experiecnes I am confident in stating that I will never return here again. Never.

He did, however, do a lot of hanging out by the bar.One basket of chips and salsa is complimentary, regardless of how many people are at the table.

Since that wasn't the case, it wasn't an issue at all.I ordered nachos, which were pretty cold. The beans were not spiced at all, but the temperature was the main issue. The fiance got tostadas. He ordered them with no tomatoes, but of course it came with tomatoes. Since our waiter was completely MIA, he just picked around them. His mom ordered the chorizo and banana/plantain appetizer, which she found extremely spicy (this was the only item that had any spice at all). My brother ordered a burrito, also without tomatoes, but this was also not honored. The meat was completely cold, and the rest of the ingredients were tepid.

He was pretty worthless. He came to our table maybe twice, to take our order and give us our bill. Someone else delivered our food. The complimentary chips and salsa were also hilarious. A huge basket of chips and about 3 tablespoons of salsa and you have to pay $1.50 for more. I ordered the taco salad with steak, yuck. The steak was partially tough and partially mushy and incredibly over salted. And I love salt. I couldn't eat the entire bottom half. When we finished eating what we could of our food, our waiter didn't come for 20 minutes so we had to pull him away from chatting behind the bar to bring the bill. He brought the wrong bill which was double the amount of what we ordered.So once again, we had to go up to the bar to tell him it was the wrong bill.

Tony? Stuart? I don't remember) was extremely attentive and friendly. \u00a0He gave us all the time we needed as we chatted and gave little thought to ordering. \u00a0The absolutely stellar part of the service is how well our server and the kitchen reacted to a sensitive situation. \u00a0One of our coworkers has both a gluten and dairy allergy. \u00a0As such, it's pretty difficult for her to eat anywhere. \u00a0After explaining this to the server, he went back to the kitchen and he explained that the chefs are completely prepared to make her something that would be wonderful and wouldn't make her sick.The rest of our table ordered flatbread pizzas, a blended Italian red wine, and our entrees. \u00a0First off, the flatbread pizzas were actually quite good. \u00a0There were several vegetarian ones (a margherita and actual veggie), and a spicy sausage and something else. \u00a0We had a veggie flatbread and one with pepperoni and sausage. \u00a0Both were very delicious. \u00a0I would happily order those again.The red wine was okay, but I know very little about wine, so my review isn't based on this at all.The \"meh\" part of the review is my entree. \u00a0There was no problem with it. \u00a0I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0I figured it'd be their take on a classic italian dish. \u00a0Sort of. \u00a0The meatballs were lamb in a gravy. \u00a0They were big, they weren't super dry, but they weren't super moist either. \u00a0They were pretty bleh. \u00a0I really didn't understand why they were coated in a brown meat gravy. \u00a0The spaghetti were these little cylinders of spaghetti that seemed to be baked in large cupcake tins and covered with breadcrumbs and cheese. \u00a0While the form was interesting, it made the spaghetti a touch over cooked and dry. \u00a0It had to have extra red sauce around it. \u00a0So there are these lamb meatballs in a gravy, right next to dry spaghetti and sauce. \u00a0It seemed terribly disjointed, like they weren't related. \u00a0Why coat the meatballs in gravy? \u00a0Why not the pasta sauce to link them to the spaghetti? It seemed like two halves of two dishes were on one plate. \u00a0Neither was executed terribly well.My coworker was served a grilled salmon with fingerlings and green beans. \u00a0It looked wonderful and she proclaimed it to be delicious. \u00a0It wasn't on the menu at all, but the kitchen reacted so wonderfully to her allergies and still made her a dish that was superb. \u00a0I was terribly impressed by this and very happy she could enjoy our dinner out.My other coworker's meals looked delicious, and I wished I had ordered something else.As a side note, the entrees have two prices on them in a \"28/42\" format. \u00a0The first number is a half order, good for tapas or for a smaller entree. \u00a0The larger, second number is a full entree. \u00a0Some of our diners ordered a half. \u00a0Some a full. \u00a0The full orders are very generous. \u00a0The halfs are probably the best size after having appetizers. \u00a0This isn't super obvious on the menu unless you read everything."], ["K C T.", "Great place, we came here after a horrible experience at The last Word ( don't go there)The staff was nice our waiter was great.

The food here is absolutely amazing, and so creative with the different blends of taste. The first time we came we had our orders taken care of with Steve. He was very thorough on what each dish was like. We liked him so much that ever since then he's been our waiter every time my boyfriend and I go. Every dish he suggested was delectable. We always order the calamaris as appetizers, it's a must have!!"], ["Tabitha M.", "Restaurant Week lured me back after a 10 year lapse. \u00a0I've got to say, our service was really good! \u00a0Shout out to Scott for reading when my friend and I just wanted to visit and letting us have our space! \u00a0 Food was hit and miss. \u00a0Beet and pistachio salad was GREAT! \u00a0Pork belly taco was alright (would have liked more than 2 pieces of pork belly). \u00a0Entrees (fried chicken and roast lamb) were good, but not great. \u00a0Sticky bun dessert was tough, but the cheesecake was deeeelicious. \u00a0I'd be willing to give it another go and see if we can't get up to four or five stars."], ["Jeffrey A.", "I recently found out that Vinology is discontinuing their lunch service, but they are of course still open for dinner, AND they will be serving brunch on the weekends! \u00a0I've always been happy with their service, food, and wine selection. \u00a0It's a really excellent venue."], ["N G.", "Had an amazing meal and even better service, if possible. I ordered a vegetarian dish and asked it to be topped up with chicken - and it was gorgeous! The mushrooms melt in your mouth and the potatoes were so good. The waiter recommended the wine which was a bit dry for my taste and he offered to replace it - and that's great service."], ["Ann W.", "Vinology is on the list of restaurants that I recommend to friends looking for a unique dining experience. I make this recommendation for a number of reasons:1. The meals complement the vast wine selection and vary from visit to visit. 2. The majority of the meals are different and much more creative than what you would find in other restaurants.3. For dinner, you have the option of selecting the smaller-sized portions, my license to try more creations.For lunch, I started with the Thai Salad (appetizer portion). This dish included large chunks of avocado, wrapped in thinly-sliced cucumbers, shredded cabbage with soy dressing, and fried rice noodles. It was incredibly good and a great start to the meal. For the entr\u00e9e, I selected the Provencal Ahi Tuna, cooked medium rare. The meal included deliciously-roasted potatoes, green beans, and grilled baby romaine. Sherry vinaigrette added one of the dimensions of flavor to the meal. In addition to the tuna, there was egg salad atop a tomato. It was an odd but interesting combination.I enjoyed an incredible dessert - one of the best I had this year. The bougatsa was comprised of two distinct elements: an egg custard baked in phyllo dough and dusted with powder sugar. It tasted very similar to the Greek dessert, galaktoboureko, and was served with caramel sauce. The other element of the dessert was a two-layer coffee pudding served in an espresso cup, topped with whipped cream. This was a 5-star dessert.The restaurant is located in downtown Ann Arbor. On the street-level, the dining room is split in two between the bar and dining area. There are stairs leading to addition seating downstairs. The restaurant featured exposed brick walls and a tin ceiling. The light fixtures are enhanced with seashells. Sheers offer some privacy among diners. \u00a0All of this adds up to a unique but perfect setting for a delicious meal."], ["Jason B.", "Had a great meal here Saturday. Definitely doing some of the best food in town these days (although competition is a bit lackluster). Had a delicious cheese board to start and then shared the Pasticcio and the Scallop ala Nola dish. Both were great, but i think the Pasticcio was better."], ["John K.", "I'm here for a wedding, the bride and groom had their first date here and now got married here. The downstairs can be rented out for large groups and we have about 40 in ours. I can't comment on the upstairs regular bar/dining area but downstairs the waitstaff has been very attentive and the food was excellent. Our group had choices of lake trout, sirloin, gnocchi, and game hen and everyone enjoyed their entree."], ["Nancy K.", "It's official, my on again off again romance with Vinology is officially over. We should have learned a long time ago to stick to the inspired cheese plate and wine. Unfortunately when looking for a place for dinner this past weekend between work and not wanting to eat after 10, Vinology tempted us with a delicious sounding menu and perfect 8:45 time slot. We arrived at 8:41. We like to arrive a little earlier for dinner and have a glass of wine but a few obstacles popped up. We are those people who call if they will be late but were happy to park close enough and with enough time to make sure we could be there on time. Which was 8:45.The hostess working, who I'm sure is a nice enough person, must have been stressed by restaurant week. She asked our name, made a face and said, \"Um, it's going to be closer to 8:45?\" In that annoying voice. First, you are telling me, not asking me, so your inflection should go down. Secondly, I wasn't one of several annoying people who came VERY early for their reservation and asked to be seated early. I arrived on time. The bar was packed, there was no place to stand and the servers were annoyed. I don't blame them. What I do blame them for is the ridiculous amount of attitude they all had. Seriously? Where would you like me to stand when I am four minutes early and there is no place to go? TWO parties who arrived after us, both with 8:45 tables were seated ahead of us. But we stood and smiled and figured it would be worth the wait. We were seated at 9:20. We ordered a bottle of wine. It. Took. Forever. I get that it's Friday night and it's restaurant week and you are packed but considering that there wasn't even a \"wow, sorry about that crazy wait!\" (You know, MANNERS?!) or a, \"hey, we won't be able to seat you until about 9:15,\" my patience was running thin. But it's not the waiter's fault so I didn't say anything. The bottle took forever but it did finally arrive. We ordered an artisanal cheese plate and then I had the salad and steak and Kris got the soup and risotto. When the cheese plate came we couldn't tell if it was the salad or the cheese plate because it was put in front of me but there were no other plates. It's moments like this that I feel awkward and uneducated so I waited and when the waiter passed I asked, \"We're idiots, is this the salad or the cheese plate?\" And he said, \u00a0\"cheese plate\" and walked away. After two more times walking by with us not really caring and happily enjoying a glass of wine he came back and thumped down two small plates. Nice. And necessary because it was a trio of spreadable cheeses and without plates we would have had a hell of a time. It came with crostini spread with pesto which looked good. And then I bit down. Thank god I am terrified of dental mishaps and always take an easy bite at first because this bread was STALE. It was not crostini. It was bread from a few days ago that even though had been sliced thinly (a few days ago) would have served as a decent weapon had you a sock to put it in.We asked for some soft bread much to our waiter's apparent distaste and then I said, \"Well, the bread is stale. Not crostini. It probably shouldn't have left the kitchen,\" and while some people might find this rude I was kind of sick of the attitude and also the nightmare bread. Especially because I was starving and felt like that thirsty dude in hell... The one who leans down to drink and the water retreats but then when he sits back up the water comes back? I felt like him.After a while more the soup and salad came. Kris' soup was piping hot and phenomenal. My salad was delicious and exactly as described on the menu. We are leisurely diners and were happy that the courses were spaced (well! after the initial wait). When our main courses came I was warned that my plate was hot and it was. I was actually surprised at how hot because when I put my hand over my non-steaming food it was not emitting warmth of any sort. Kind of weird. I figured it would be pretty hot judging by the plate. I cut a small piece and no, it was not not. It was barely warm. I'm pretty sure they had put it in the microwave. You know how when you put things in the microwave sometimes the plate is crazy not but the food is not? Yeah... that.The gruyere pasta was tasty even room temperature and, quite honestly, I was at the end of my tether and felt I had used my one request with the bread so I ate about have of my meal and we ordered dessert. Dessert was fantastic. Vinology has beginnings and ends covered. After the bill came a managerial type came by and I bitched about the crostini. And old person or small child would have a lawsuit, I swear. And he comes back to say he comped it. Um, thanks? We weren't trying to get a free appetizer, we were letting you know that your quality control needs some quality control.Done. Never again."], ["Amy G.", "I really wanted to like Vinology, but I honestly did not hugely enjoy my meal there. I made a reservation for me and my friends during Restaurant Week. I had a coconut-based soup, risotto, and a brown sugar cake with a pear topping for dessert. I like the soup, and wished I had more than just a small cup. I couldn't eat much of the risotto dish--it just seemed like bland-ish mushy rice, kind of like the rice I make accidentally make when I put to much water in the cooker. The side of oily greens did not serve to cleanse the palate, and I just didn't understand the grapes component of the entree. I probably just made the wrong menu choices, as I tasted and liked my daring friend's carppacio appetizer. I have long been intrigued by carppacio but not brave enough to order it myself. The meat was cut super thin and seasoned heavily so it basically tasted like eating fancy salami rather than raw beef. Vinology is a dimly lit and dressier place, and accordingly I saw many multiple date nights happening there. I would probably give the restaurant another chance."], ["Ashley C.", "We went to Vinology for my birthday dinner. Loved, loved, loved! The service was fantastic. We were first seated at a high top near the bar, but asked to be moved to a table near the front. No problem at all. There was even a space heater next to the table so we were toasty during the whole meal. I ordered a flight of red wine. Great deal, $14 for three glasses. The boys had local beers. For dinner we had one of the flat bread pizzas, a lamb dish and a pork dish. The food was delicious and came very quickly. For dessert, I was able to choose a comped birthday treat (thanks!). We split the bread pudding with goat cheese ice cream. It was shamefully delicious. I didn't care for the ice cream, but the guys loved it. Overall, we had a wonderful time! There were a few things on the menu we were already eyeing for our next visit. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later!"], ["Colleen H.", "Two words - Roasted Tofu! \u00a0Unbelieveable. \u00a0A group of us from work met for lunch during restarant week. \u00a0I had worked out right before and when I saw the lunch menu I knew I wanted the roasted tofu but I was afraid it wasn't going to be enough food since I was starving. \u00a0I went with it! \u00a0Not only was is amazing, I was full! \u00a0The presentation was beautiful too. \u00a0Two more words - Happy Hour! \u00a0I thought this was just for restaurant week, but, NO! \u00a0Happy Hour everyday is 11 am to 6 pm. \u00a0I got a glass of Smoke Screen Chardonnay for $5.50! \u00a0YUM! \u00a0The lunch was amazing and I encourage you (even if you are not a vegetarian) to try the roasted tofu. \u00a0You will love it!"], ["Varun B.", "Yum. The entire time I was at UofM, I had never gone here, and it's quite unfortunate, but I'm glad I finally got to check it out. \u00a0They have quite a nice selection of wine, and a nice \"featured\" wine section.Decided to go all \"small plates\" for dinner because neither my wife nor I were super hungry to shoot for the entrees (not to say they didn't sound delicious). We got the duck wings, and man oh man, those babies are fantastic. Duck is one of my favorite meats. The wings have a delicious glaze and the meat is super tender. Not to mention, they're quite easy to eat. The saut\u00e9ed calamari with the risotto is also excellent. The melon amoygue adds a nice touch. We did get the Day Boat Samosas with a shrimp/scallop patty on the inside. To be honest, the wrapper was quite greasy and not very crisp. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp/scallop patty on the inside either - a weird little taste. This was probably the low point of the meal. The last thing we got, the caribbean chicken flatbread, was pretty good though. The braised pineapple on it was great and the chicken was tender. \u00a0I would really like to come back at some point and shoot for the entrees."], ["Bridget N.", "I had brunch here with two of my friends on a Sunday morning. Brunch was delicious! I got the shakshuka and I loved it-very different from other brunch offerings. The eggs were cooked well-the tomato sauce was well flavored and the pitas were the right texture of crispy but not too hard. My friend got an omelette (she loved it) and another got shrimp/grits (she liked the flavor, but eggs were cooked soft and she didn't like that). Portions were very generous. We also got the pastry basket. I do wish they offered half a basket (it's ALOT of stuff) but \u00a0it was a great starter. The sangria is also my favorite in Ann Arbor so far-I think it's the brandy they use. It's not too sweet and a bit strong-in a good way. I would definitly come back here for brunch."], ["Erin M.", "Had the most amazing time here last night. Melissa, our server, was knowledgeable and cool. We had a table of people with special dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, etc.). I can't even tell you how incredible it was that I was able to have a three-course vegan meal -- from appetizer to dessert -- at a beautiful restaurant that doesn't even advertise itself as being vegan. Serious hats off to the chef for treating vegans and gluten-free individuals as guests who are just as important as anyone else. I will definitely be back."], ["Kate S.", "Am very conflicted with this review. I've been here a few times now and have had some 5 star experiences. But I've had some average experiences too. I am knocking this down to 3 stars based on the inconsistency.The best experiences I've had here have been at the bar. Order wine by the glass, enjoy the knowledgeable bartenders, and order some small plates. While not as intimate, it has led to a few fantastic evenings this way. When I've had dinner, I've had some amazing dishes (a cucumber gazpacho they served during restaurant week this summer was out of this world), but I've also had under-seasoned meat, waiters who weren't able to answer questions about the wine list, and bar orders that never get filled.

She was super sweet, friendly, and helpful. Wine: I'm NOT an expert in wine but my date was, and he was very satisfied with the wine selection and recommendation. So I vote for him ;)Food: I ordered Chicken under the Brick. It was slow roasted chicken over a bed of mashed potato and roasted veggies. It was very tasty, and beautifully decorated. I ordered half portion and could just finish half of it.Ambience: We checked in, on a Thursday night, snowing and cold outside. It was quiet and relaxing inside. not crowded at all.

We also shared an appetizer of the spinach artichoke dip, which was excellent. \u00a0They had a very extensive wine and beer list. While our waiter was a very nice young man I must say the service of the other staff left something to be desired. \u00a0My friend had to leave early as her son was getting fussy, so I finished my dinner by myself and ordered another glass of wine since I was in no rush to leave. \u00a0The restaurant was not overly busy that evening (I would have hurried to finish if they needed the table) but a woman (who I am going to assume is the owner/manager) took away the chair my friend was sitting at without asking if she could have it or if my friend would be back. \u00a0I found this to be pretty rude.After I paid, two young girls who were standing at the host area muttered under their breath (thanks for coming). \u00a0They looked more like they would be interested in a root canal than return service to this establishment.I wouldn't go back."], ["Tim H.", "I would give 4 and a half stars if I could. We started with the oysters Rockefeller and on the half shell which were both amazing. I had the clam chowder next which was also very good. My entree was the cedar plank salmon. It was good, I have certainly had better though. I probably wouldn't recommend it, but they are a steak house and everyone that ordered beef commented on how amazing it was. They are also a brewery and in my opinion, an excellent one. If you are a fan of craft beer I would recommend a flight.

Food is tasty and they even have sushi and it's not bad at all. I had the pepper crusted steak which is one of their chef's choices and it was delicious, especially the sauce. The bread ain't their speciality nor the clam chowder! Clam chowder has to taste like Barbara's in Half Moon Bay, CA! One thing that made so annoyed is the place is full of fruit flies and they don't let you eat peacefully. Keep flying around into the food! I would go again only if they find a way to get rid of those fruit flies, makes me wonder whether their kitchen is clean or not."], ["Gary D.", "Others reviewing this restaurant are spot on. A really good place that seems to be consistent, but nothing really outstanding. We went for the in house beer, and found that to be more than adequate. The menu is extensive, but then again that sometimes is not a good thing. No one is good at everything. It is also kind of pricy for the area.I had a crab cake \"burger\", glad I asked for the cole slaw on the side. Woulda been a disaster on it! With just red onion and lettuce on a pretzel bun, it was delicious. Why would you bury that good crab cake under a mound of gooey slaw? I also had the chili, and it was worth the $3.99 for a cup.

It looked packed to the gills but shockingly we were seated right away. The downside of this is we were crowded into an awkward area near to the bar where it felt like we were in every member of the staff's way, some of the patrons too. The table set up was definitely a negative.The food here is solid. Really delicious mains and salads are accompanied by mostly forgettable sides though so I cannot declare it totally fabu. I will say it has definite happy highlights. Steaks run a bit spendy but they have some menu items at all price points and the portions are hearty.The house salad was a happy hit with both of us. Gorgonzola, dried cherries, walnuts and onions atop mixed greens. I had mine with delicious balsamic and James went with the nicely thin ranch. The bread came in odd half loaves but was tasty dipped into the olive oil, pepper and seasoning mix the have handily at the table. They also have balsamic for a little jazzing up.I had the bbq half chicken served with a mustard barbecue sauce that can only be described as tangily addictive. Perfectly roasted on the bone and torn off in juicy flavorful strips easily with a fork. The garlic mashers that came with were not my particular thing, next time I will swap out for something more interesting. I also expected something totally different when reading roasted root vegetables, I merely got overcooked, tasteless carrots and celery, ick. My husband went with the Redwood Special Porter fish and chips. Three nice pieces of flaky and perfectly coated fish. It was served with a huge portion of decent, coated type fries and some meh steamed mixed veggies which he immediately put on his bread plate and shoved towards me.They have a variety of house brewed beers. My husband was happy with the selection of pale ales. Beer samplers (minimum order of 3) are 1.25 each, cask conditioned samplers are 2.00. You can get pints for mostly 5 and under. The girly drink menu has some interesting picks on it which always makes me happy. They have wine, scotch and tequila flights available and run very nice happy hour specials in their Sequoia Lounge next door from 3-6 weekdays.Waitstaff was friendly but not always super timely.

My wife's aunt had their macaroni and cheese dish and kept stating how she would have to try to make it at home. My wife had a salad dish that she also said was very good.

Prices were a little high, but the food was very good. We sampled an excellent flatbread appetizer, a little small, but lots of flavor. The husband and I both went for the safe steak, mine was a filet oscar (I'm a sucker for this dish). Both were cooked to a nice medium-rare, perhaps a little closer to the medium side. Portion sizes on the entrees were respectable; I was full but not stuffed (well, until dessert).It was a little odd to me the way they treated their ahi tuna. My father-in-law ordered up the 8oz. herb-crusted ahi on the side but you could barely taste the tuna for all the rosemary they slapped on it. I wouldn't recommend it for big tuna fans.Their microbrews were decent, too. My favorite was the pilsner but I was less than impressed with their amber ale. On the alcohol note; for a nice restaurant, their wine menu was lacking. I ended up having a glass of Ravenswood zin which is kind of a joke at nearly $7 a glass. I didn't check the brand on my mother-in-law's white zinfandel, but I'd be willing to bet money it was the old Beringer fall-back, that's just the kind of selection they had.As for atmosphere, that was where I was tempted to dock a star. It's a lodge, yes; but it's also a bar. The music was a little too loud and a little to eclectic (country, pop, R&B), menus were paper, and there were a lot of ads for gimmicky \"nights.\" I'd also like to agree with another reviewer who mentioned the tables were poorly arranged. They're WAY too close together. There was no one at the table behind us and the staff still had to shimmy uncomfortably close to get between me & the empty chair. And, as is becoming evident in my good 'ol home state: 5-star service is hard to find. Our waiter (Kevin) was very nice and very knowledgeable, but unorganized and trying way too hard. He was by the table every 5 minutes asking if everything was OK, and he repeatedly served the wrong food to the wrong patron. I like to end on a good note, so let me say the dessert was wonderful. Not too fancy, just good quality sweet stuff. Try the peanut butter pie, for sure.

Since as long as I can remember, I've gone here and received excellent service, I've never had a long wait, and the food is just awesome. That being said, the flavors are distinctly from the Mediterranean and you won't find any basic pastas with red sauce or other Olive Garden-style food here, so sometimes people have the exact opposite opinion of the food because they can't just get lasagna or spaghetti. I understand that complaint, but I just don't share it, I love unique restaurants and Mediterrano is very unique. I highly recommend the Chicken Jerusalem (chicken with a tart cream sauce) , the Turkish burec (a philo-dough vegetarian pie), and the butternut squash ravioli (exactly what it sounds like).Pricey? Yes. My wife and I took my parents out to eat just the other night and we went over $100 with a very minimal dinner. However, when you compare that with most of the restaurants on Main Street, Mediterrano is actually a pretty good deal. As a side note, we had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here a few years ago and it was very fairly priced and they did an excellent job with the presentation and timing. The only complaint I'm surprised about from other reviewers is that the staff was pretentious. I find the servers here to be far more down to Earth than just about any other high-end restaurant in Ann Arbor. This restaurant tends to draw a line in the sand between people who like it and people who hate it. The people I know who don't like this place feel passionate about their hatred.

I got a nice glass of red and my husband got a local beer from Dark Horse. We ordered the chicken chopped salad and pot roast (from the aptly-named \"very comforting\" section of the menu). We casually mentioned to our server (who was also serving as the bartender - it was 9:00pm on a Monday) that we would be splitting the food. As I said, we were really hungry, and Gary had promised us hot rolls. Well, they must have baked them especially for us, since the rolls came out nice and hot along with the rest of the food - already split into two beautifully portioned plates, each. And can I just say - daaayyum - the kitchen must be super professionally run, because every mouthful was truly fantastic. The salad was delicious, everything in there perfectly fresh and well-balanced, the dressing homemade. The pot roast was out of this world - moist, tender, and bathed in the most delicious gravy. It came with a side of freshly sauteed veggies and delicious homemade mashed potatoes. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert, because the offerings sounded great. Why can't there be a Brighton Bar and Grill in Ann Arbor????May I suggest to the owners that you open one here right away!My only complaint - the delicious hot rolls came with whipped margarine. I'd take real butter any day.We'll be back!"], ["Ed D.", "This is one of our go to places the food is excellent we especially like the black and blue salad the meat is unbelievable tender and seasoned perfect everything we have tried has been very good even the hamburger the service is always good and the atmosphere friendly and welcoming"], ["S J.", "The decor is nice, service is good, but the food is mediocre and a bit overpriced."], ["Billy M.", "Recently went here on a trip back to Ann Arbor to visit family and absolutely loved it!

There's something for everybody on their menu.I had pretzel nugzz and pizza rolls as an appetizer, and they weren't too bad. Maybe a little expensive for what you get, but that's typical of just about any appetizer. My burger, however, was disappointing. I had a classic with cheese, and it was nothing to write home about. The crack fries are what they really champion here for snacks, and I found those to be no better than fries that I've had at other establishments. Also nothing to write home about.The place is too cramped... if you don't appreciate being right on top of the people at the next table over and having to move every time a waitress comes through, you might want to avoid HopCat, especially at busy times.Another thing I like is that after putting in your name for a table, they'll text you when it's available.

Outside dining area right in front of restaurant. Inside dining area as well. Can't make up your mind? There is a hybrid spot: inside area with ceiling covering (but open on the sides). If you can't find a place to sit down, you are probably too picky!FOOD:Dollar burger Tuesday? Seemed too good to be true, but I'm always game for great deals. I went in with the mindset that I would end up with having spent more than $1. I was correct...and add $14 to it. Not worth the deal in my opinion. The burger was only cooked one way--just like what Mom told me after I got an A on an exam: \"well done\". Because of this, the burger was on the drier side and quite lacking in taste. \u00a0Just to break it down for you all so there are no cost surprises, let's go through my order. First reason why it turned out to be $14 was because you must order a drink for the $1 burger. A beer costs about $7.50. Then, of course, the more \"add-on's\" on the burger the higher the price. Each item is about 50 cents. If you want cheese, grilled onions, tomatoes, a sauce that sets you at $2 more. The burger was the size of your typical McDonald's burger (aka small), so we shared some tots (~$4.25). And just like that, $1 burger no more :(SERVICE:Waiter did come by to check in on us a few times, but he just didn't seem to be having a great time. He didn't smile at all! Maybe he was having a rough day, but I felt it rubbed off, and it just made the service a bit of a debbie downer.IMPRESSIONS:Don't think I will be back. If the burger could be cooked to your liking (ie: medium well), I think that would have made a big difference in taste. Honestly the add-on's aren't expensive, and although I got a beer, I'm sure pop would be cheaper. So, really, there are ways to make it less expensive. Unfortunately, the burger just was not tasty. It was also small in size. This is why I had to get tots--I was still hungry!"], ["Karissa K.", "I've come here a few times, usually when my parents are in town.

In any case, it's a discounted deal! I'm not sure how the seating works regularly, but on Tuesdays it is super casual: just seat yourself and a waitress will come by. In fact, I don't think we were addressed more than once by the same waitress, as different workers will walk by and ask if you've ordered or if you need anything. I got the portobello burger with additional toppings of tomato, grilled onions, and guacamole. Carbs are my favorite and the bun was soft, warm and possibly buttered for bonus tastiness. We also shared a side of fries for $4. I liked their fries a lot, I don't know if they pre-season them, but they seemed to be extra crispy and delicious. I want to try their tater tots in the future. Their drink menu is a bit curious in that there are only names of beers, no prices or descriptions, but we asked and the beers are $4-6 which is kind of pricey so we passed on that.

They have unique, delicious Spanish-style tapas, amazing cocktails and sangria, as well as a great brunch option on weekends. Any of the cheese options makes for a great starter. The patatas (fries with an over easy egg) are perfect if you want some grease. The menu changes a bit, but the various seafood and vegetable tapas are always on point. Servers are adept at giving recommendations should you need them. As for drinks, I would go for their house made tonics with gin, a custom bourbon/whiskey creation, or red sangria. Never had dessert, but they sure look good :)"], ["Kate W.", "THE SERVICE HERE IS AWFUL!! I went to dinner here with my boyfriend tonight and not only were our main dishes extremely late in coming out, mine never came out at all. Had the waiter come to check on us even once he would have known that my meal never made it to the table. Once the waiter became aware of this situation he offered to take my dish off the bill. Like you're doing me a favor by taking the dish off the bill that I NEVER GOT?! Then, we asked to speak to a manager to settle the bill. The manager offered to take off a measly 25% and offered me a gift card to come back and try the dish that I never received. No, we don't want a gift card for $10 to come back, we want you to TRY and salvage our awful experience that we are having NOW. \u00a0To no avail, we ended up having to pay nearly $40 for a meal that was ruined in every way. We even explained to the manager that it would be in good service to settle our bill. \u00a0She would not budge and patronizingly said \"I'm sorry you feel that way\". For a restaurant that offers expensive prices and small plates, service is everything. I would highly recommend staying away from this place. \u00a0You can do better."], ["Kosta S.", "The service here is always pretty good. \u00a0So are the drinks and the churros. \u00a0However, most recently, the rest of the food took a turn for the worse. \u00a0I've been here a few times this past year and always had a great experience. \u00a0The last time I was here a couple weeks ago it was obvious from the get go that the kitchen has stopped paying attention. \u00a0The first indication was the fennel salad, which was made with very old fennel and was inedible. When we sent it back the server let us know that the chef had changed. Everything else we ordered was also prepared weirdly and without finesse. There seemed to be a scoop of flavorless goat cheese on everything, regardless of whether it belonged there. Once a staple restaurant for us, I don't think we will be back any time soon."], ["Kathy P.", "This place is really cool. \u00a0Their fenced in patio in the back (where we sat) is picturesque. \u00a0What I could see of the inside seating of the restaurant is also nice. \u00a0The hostesses were friendly and accommodating, and our server was helpful in explaining the menu. \u00a0My boyfriend still talks about this as being one of his favorite meals. \u00a0I really enjoyed it, too, but as someone who's had great authentic Spanish food, I was a little less sold on the not-so-authentic takes on some of the dishes. \u00a0Good nonetheless!"], ["Duong V.", "I was excited to eat here for Restaurant Week because of the raving reviews, but it fell short of my expectations. First off, the lighting was so dim it was hard to see what was served in front of me. The atmosphere was nice for the bar, but for fine dining it wasn't my cup of tea. To be honest the food was not all that great, I paid $30 for myself and another $40 for my girlfriend with tip. For what I paid, the food was not worth it. I don't know if it's just me, but I just did not like the cold appetizers that were served. The Esqueixada de Bacalao was undercooked cod on a little piece of bread with bell peppers. It was disgusting and very fishy. As for the rest of the course, I was just not satisfied with any of it. Maybe the food at this restaurant is not for my taste, but it was just a bad experience. The only thing that was good was the water I was drinking and the Croqueta de Manchego... The churros were okay, but they were a little too soft for me. I really wished the food tasted better, but maybe the food tastes better tipsy or drunk lol"], ["Alexandra S.", "As someone who eats out nearly every singe meal (guilty as charged, no judgment zone here!) I have to honestly say that Aventura is my favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor. Let me first start out by mentioning the atmosphere. Easily the most beautiful and visually pleasing restaurant in Ann Arbor, every single aspect of the restaurant, architecture wise, is impeccable. You are temporarily taken out of the Midwest and teleported to hip New York City or even maybe the heart of beautiful Barcelona. From the gorgeous tile, to the unique artwork, to the detailed ceilings, to the slick bar, and to the the exposed brick archways that surround the restaurant, this place will have you \"ooh-Ing and ahh-ing\" from the moment you walk through the double doors. Now onto the food. This is one of those restaurants that you could go to 50 times in a row and STILL never have the same meal twice. With a large menu primarily made up of tapas, paella, cheeses, salads, soups, and cocas (Spanish style pizzas.....oh my god), your options are seriously limitless. The best Brussels sprouts I have ever had served warm with Granny Smith apples, pistachios, creme fraiche and drizzled with honey makes me feel like I'm in heaven. Please also try the cannellini beans and of course the bacon wrapped dates!! (A MUST) to name only a few!Onto the bar. The gorgeous and spacious bar makes it comfortable to not only drink and socialize but also have a full on meal in case the restaurant is too busy to get a table and if you are like me many of the times, and are reservation-less., All of the bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable and so very friendly that you could stay there for hours. One of the bartenders last names is SWEETS. Are you kidding me? Too good to be true. (p.s. Please try one of their many popular gin and tonics (raspberry and lime is my go to!) and of course the red sangria.) Safe to say I could easily talk about this place for hours. I love every second of my time there and would recommend Aventura to every single person. Best restaurant in town!"], ["Ana N.", "I've been here at least ten times and aventuras never disappoints - prefer dinner and drinks at the bar to brunch but still delicious and good service.

I was a part of the latter group, enjoying a nice dinner for a friend's birthday. Because there were more than 10 of us, we were seated, along with another group downstairs, by the kitchen and where the wines were kept. I was worried we would be forgotten down there, but Amos, our server who shares the name with one of my fave uncles made sure to NOT allow us the feeling of loneliness. We started with some wine, I had the red because I was feeling brave and knew that THIS time I was going to stay awake, (I did). Shortly after we proceeded to the tapas, which is why I had to give at least 3 stars, because they were delicious. Innovative, great portions of not too much, but definitely not TOO little and priced JUST right. Between the hubs and I, we split Croquetas de pollo, Albondigas, something that resembled Flautas, all equally delicious.The same cannot be said for the Paella del Mar. I had the great fortune of being from a town with a significant Iberian population, and with them came their delicious food and variety of tastes given whatever provinces they were from. So when it comes to paella, I have pretty high standards. Keep in mind there are two other kinds that I am not opposed to trying them either, as I am so homesick and miss this kind of food.Also, I have yet to truly get a feel for the upstairs - I just saw what resembled a restaurant in Midtown with well dressed folks, trendy music, mood lighting - definitely a place where the cool kids play. I am willing to give another go, possibly having more luck with the Paella del Jueves and the upstairs ambiance will give me a more favorable view of this gem with great potential.UPDATE: So I went BACK, on a not so busy night for happy hour and had what seemed to be a never-ending glass of sangria and some croquetas de jamon, delicious AS USUAL - I love their Croquetas. I made the mistake of ordering the Costillas de Res y Papas. It was so salty, I could feel my blood pressure going up, but Sa\u00fal was quick to make it all better. By far my favorite person there, he quickly took it back, cleared it off the bill and offered me other options. I got my old reliable Alb\u00f3ndigas and sat at the bar as happy as a clam. The ambiance upstairs is nice, the decor, GREAT. You had the fresh cut fruit RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, just waiting to soak in the wine and offer its infusion once you are done with the liquid. Needless to say the sangria was DELICIOUS and I like it a little better now."], ["Cristina A.", "My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. The drinks were incredible! Great service and excellent food. Saul was very friendly, knowledgable and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our experience. I would definitely come back again!"], ["Shweta A.", "Great tapas place in Ann Arbor! The staff here are very friendly and great! Try the patatas bravas! Their red sangria is good and they have outdoor seating in the summer. Also if Saul is working, ask for the \"Alexa!\""], ["Jessica R.", "Aventura is beautiful--brick walls, open spaces, immaculate tiling, and warmth (some plush seats, a cheese station, etc.). I could barely recognize the space from its Mahek days.We were seated by the kitchen, which contributed to a flurriness that was both exciting and grating. The staff was constantly going in and out, often stopping to ask how our food/service/evening was. We felt SO well attended to, and everyone seemed genuine. But I've never seen so much back-and-forth. I wonder if the small plates play into that? Perhaps there are more plates going out per table, so there's more back-and-forth. We were also seated next to the eight-person table. One party was finishing their meal during the first half of ours, another party sat down to start their meal as we ate our second half. Groups this larger are very loud, so between the groups and the buzzing kitchen, we had to yell-talk the whole meal. I ended up with a headache, something I get maybe once a year. So sit elsewhere in the restaurant!The menu has lots of sections with prices ranging from $2 for a one-bit snack, to $14 for 3 lamb sliders, to $45 for a huge paella. We got a little of everything.To start, the pintxos. These are the one-bite snacks. More like four or five bites, but definitely meant for one person. We had the short rib (SOLOMILLO Y CREMA), cheese and peppers (PIMIENTOS ROJOS), and cheese and pineapple (ALMENDRAS Y PI\u00d1A). The last was my favorite, and they were all fine. When I think about spending $4 on four bites of pineapple and cheese it doesn't feel great, but when you're there, in the restaurant, I guess it makes sense?Next was the coca, explained on the menu as cake or bread? I'm not sure because while we ordered one (MAH\u00d3N Y MIEL), we realized--upon driving away, of course--that we never got it! And we definitely paid for it.We were surprised to see the tuna salad (ENSALADA RUSA) come out as a creamy salad. Each bite had texture--the chopped pieces were crunchy and the tuna was soft. I was initially put off by this not being a \"salad\" (as in lettuce), but it grew on me.One of my favorite parts of Aventura was the cheese and meat plate! You order per cheese and meat, and they make you a board. We got three cheeses: MAH\u00d3N (very innocuous, served with a thick guava paste), VALDE\u00d3N (absolutely delicious, drizzled with honey), and CABRALES (super strong, served with pickled figs--I loved it, my fiance didn't). We also got the CHORIZO DE ESPA\u00d1A from the charcuterie side, and it was fine. Again, when I think of the prices per portion here, it doesn't feel great, but in the context of the restaurant I guess it made sense. I guess.Finally, we got four tapas: D\u00c1TILES CON CHORIZO (4 dates wrapped in bacon. A bit too cooked to taste much of anything, but a good texture), ALB\u00d3NDIGAS (6 lamb meatballs. Immensely pleasant at first--very soft and creamy--but we later talked about how a browned and crisped outside would have been much better), CANEL\u00d3N DE ESPINACAS (3 cannelloni filled with creamed spinach. These were soft and hot; that was my main impression.), and HAMBURGUESA DE CORDERO (3 little lamb burgers. Pleasant.). Also dessert! We went for the spiced cake. This arrived plated boldly, and was interesting to eat. It's filled with something hard--almonds?--and has this glossy chocolatey outside. There is a little bit of heat to it, but I do mean a LITTLE. The first few bites were fascinating, then I kind of forgot I was eating it! Eek!We did not get drinks. The total (w/ tax and tip) was a little over $100.Going to pay, we used a gift card. There was some confusion--through no fault of the restaurant--and I want to mention this because we thought they handled this well--patiently and compassionately.IN SUM. The food came out one plate after another, and I really liked that aspect of the meal. It felt like a nonstop feast with different tastes. Ultimately, though, the food was low on just that--taste. Leaving, that was our main feeling. The building was nice, the service was sweet, but the food was just okay. We've both said that we don't know if we'll want to come back again. And that seems like a shame!What could solve this? More flavor. The food LOOKS so flavorful, but then doesn't pack much punch. The bacon-wrapped dates, for example, sit in this beautiful orange sauce. We ate the sauce by itself and actually couldn't discern ANY taste. Other dishes had some flavor, but not much... like those lamb meatballs that stood out because of their texture (as I wrote: \"very soft and creamy\"), but didn't taste like much. Having been to Spain and having explored different food scenes there, I was surprised by the dullness. I trust they'll find their groove with the flavor level."], ["Yaakov H.", "The best brunch in town! Get the shrimp and polenta bowl!

The fries were nothing special. The \"famous\" barbecue meatballs are basically meatballs in barbecue sauce. You won't regret trying them but it's not mandatory. I would, however, steer you toward the Swiss onion soup, a flavor powerhouse topped with gruyere and parmesan. The free cheese spread gets a jolt from horseradish. The setting is an early-20th-century knockout and the service was efficient and intuitive."], ["Christina G.", "Wow we really had a nice time. Debated between 4 and 5 stars. \u00a0They get 5 stars. Wonderful service from Dawn. She was very friendly with great suggestions. Prime rib is excellent!! Get it at least once. Ill ask for end cut next time to try some extra seasoning. Horseradish sauce needs a little more zip. Swiss onion soup is very good. \u00a0Thick and rich. It has deep deep flavor probably from long hours cooking with prime rib leftovers. Seafood chowder is good. Flavorful. Shulers salad is pretty good. Shredded cheese, blue cheese, creamy garlic dressing, tomatoes, olives. Baked Alaska desert is excellent.

Way back in December 1969 we dined their with both our parents after our wedding ceremony as we were having the reception a week later. (hubby had been drafted and returned from basic traing....)-anyway it's a major memory and the atmosphere \u00a0and food is a big part of that. Their bar cheese is absolutely fabulous and they utilize a lot of their homemade breads to make their own chip like devices to dip in the spread. \u00a0It's an appetizer that is a must have for us. \u00a0 The other appetizer that we can't do without is their meatballs in their special sauce . The meatballs are comprised of at least a couple different meats and the combination is unique and very tasty, and then there's the sauce, \u00a0i've never been able to replicate it! We always end up taking at least a quart to go as well as devouring a serving ourselves while there.They have a full bar and lots of reasonably priced wine choices.After all those appetizers we usually share an entr\u00e9e and we have tried many of them through the years. We have never had a bad meal. Too many to list since we try to go at least annually all these years but some of the highlights are the whitefish the prime rib the tenderloin the walleye and the lobster mac & cheese. Leave room for dessert and share it as they don't do skimpy servings! One of my favorites is the cherry crumble made with Michigan cherries and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. All those years ago they had an ice cream that they made into a ball and rolled in coconut and my mom took the idea and made that every year for my sisters whose birthday was Christmas Eve as it was festive and \u00a0looked great with the candle inserted in the top. It's still on the menu!I always like to talk about the customer service and it is very good at Win Schuler's. They have had some of the same waitstaff for years and with some it's family \u00a0tradition. \u00a0Our server this year let us know that both her parents had been waitstaff during their college years long ago.

The cheese spread had lite hint of horse radish and was delicious. The platter itself came with bread, crackers, celery, and sweet potatoe slices. A side of ranch dressing and butter also accompanied it.For the entree We both went with the Two napkin beef brisket. The brisket was sliced nice and thin and was topped with a very liberal drenching of barbecue sauce. What initially struck me as odd was the sweet pickle on it, but in contrast with the in house baked jalape\u00f1o bread, it was a perfect blend of flavored.Our server was super nice and quick to refill our drinks.

When people came to visit I knew I had two choices to show them great food: Kalamazoo or Marshall. While Kalamazoo has a few really great options like Rustica and Food Dance, Marshall has one: Schuler's. Now that I live on the east side of the state, I look forward to stopping at Schuler's any time I find myself on 94 headed to/from Chicago or the lakeshore. Here's what I like:Food - always on point, whether eating in the more casual pub or the fancier restaurant. Fresh, tasty and a good variety for any kind of eater. While the pub has good bar food and lighter fare, the restaurant has really interesting and slightly European food. Also: if you have someone in your party who likes prime rib, these folks make a really good one.Wine - the wine list at Schuler's is always strong and interesting. Sometimes they have wine dinners, too. Really enjoyable!Ambiance - I love looking at the pictures from Schuler's past and present. The whole establishment has a family feel. You feel important as a customer and you know they have a long tradition of taking good care of their guests.Impress Mom quotient - high, very high. This is where I brought my mother when she came to visit me from Washington, D.C."], ["Kelly B.", "Been to Schuler's a few times over the years, but have never been blown away. The decor is lovely, very dark and \"pub\"ish. The cheese is of course the highlight - so much better than the processed stuff from the grocery. But the actual food has never left me wanting to head back anytime soon. Most recently we stopped in for lunch on the way back from Chicago, I had thought my mom had never been there, but I was mistaken - it had just been a long time. Honestly, if I had known that we probably would have kept going. I had the prime rib po' boy - it had all the right components to be good, but it was very dry. The meat was very well done and there was not enough moisture from anywhere else in the sandwich to help it out. Mom had the seafood cakes, and never found the \"seafood\" part. Aunt had the fish & chips, which was cooked well but had a LOT of batter.

Word of mouth is that this 100 yr old restaurant is one of the key attractions in Michigan, but I have mixed reviews. Located amongst a nest of nearby beautiful churches, you get the feel of entering the home of a hobbit when you walk into the dining room with its exposed wood beams, Gothic written pearls of wisdom scribed over the walls, and dim light. Atmosphere is that of a loud, rustic, busy, open feel. Service was excellent by the host and our server. The long waits between seating, drinks, appetizers, main course, and dessert was evenly spaced, therefore plenty of time for conversation within our group. We started off with an appetizer of tangy meatballs served in pewter mugs. \u00a0I suppose an attempt to connect to their pub past. I chose a caesar salad which was disappointing. It looked as if the kitchen staff went down to the local grocery produce section, picked out a head of lettuce and chopped it in half and laid it on the plate. I am not a connoisseur of lettuce, but it didn't look at all like romaine. Pretty hard to screw-up a salad, but they did. \u00a0And the house dressing tasted oddly similar to the cheese that we used to dip our crackers in. For the main course I had the pecan crusted stuffed with spinach chicken. Sound good? I thought so. There was so much butter in this dish overpowering the flavor I thought the Land of Lakes butter girl was going to bust through the kitchen door. You have to dig to find the spinach (*please don't be frozen box spinach), but it was there. But as the saying goes, I saved the best for last....dessert. I had the peppermint ribbon pie which every bite tasted like a refreshing cool wind on a wintry day...de-lic-ious! \u00a0Definitely get the peppermint ribbon pie so you can leave Schuler's with a smile and lighter wallet.All in all, the food was lacking for the price and for such an upscale restaurant, but a terrific atmosphere to take a group for a couple hours."], ["Mit O.", "The prices of the menu only match the architecture of the building, and not the quality of their food though it isn't bad, it's just not great. \u00a0Good presentation though."], ["Bill M.", "Quaint, for sure, a bit musty.

I had the French dip, which the waitress raved about. I give it a 4 on a 1-10 scale. Not all that tender. After lunch, they brought a tray of cookies, big-ass cookies full of nuts and regular choc chips, white choc chips. I'm trying to do low carb whenever possible, but the cookie was calling out to me.

I was kind of shocked by that comment because the best thing about an iron skillet steak is that if done right it is so tender. I didnt trust her judgement and still tried the steak and it was very tasty. The waitress said that she was a chicken finger kind of girl and could recommend the chicken fingers as being really good...at that point...I could have went to any fast food joint off of the road.

I asked Susan what type of food they mainly served, and I remember that she mentioned Tunisian a few times, and said that one of their employees is from Morocco. On their website, it lists their food as authentic dishes of \"Maghred, Adalusia, and Sicily\". I'm not an expert in these cuisines, but I can say that their food is delicious and definitely makes me feel like I'm eating someone's \"home cooking\". The gelato is also amazing. So many flavors.

Ample parking. Cafeteria/deli counter ambiance, for casual and quick meals alone or with friends, and great for takeout.

Competitive with the best I've had from shatila and exotic cuisine. Delicate pastry that melts in your mouth is perfectly balanced with the right amount of sweet but not too sweet date filling. The one with almonds on the outside was out favorite. These are bite sized.Lentil soup - 4 stars. Plenty of acid and the right amount of salt. Vegetarian broth.Grape leaves - 4 stars. Subtle and delicate flavors. On the small side. Vegetarian.Hummus - 2.5 stars. Edible for sure, bit not their strong point and no match for Zamaan Cafe in Ann Arbor or any number of places in Dearborn, etc. Don't bother and instead save room for the good stuff.Spinach tagine - 4 stars. Yum. Vegetarian. Full of egg. Lots of vegetables and a perfectly crisp crust on top of a creamy middle.Olives and lemon peel - 5 stars. Never had anything like it. Sweet and tender. Don't know what seasonings were in the rub, but they were magic.Feta with smashed kalamata olives - 3 stars. Good, especially when it comes to room temperature.House ice tea - 5 stars. Unsweetened. Spiced. Refreshing and light.Gelato - 6/5. Amazing.

It's not made-to-order, but the presentation is nice and everything I've had seemed fresh. The North African spin differentiates the food from other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern eateries.

Personally did not like the lavender honey that seems popular with many (not a fan of lavender-flavored stuff in general), but the spiced hazelnut fig, roasted pistacchio, and toasted coconut were fantastic. The staff is very generous in letting you sample flavors before making a purchase, and even for a small (4 oz) they really pack the cup to overflowing.As a couple others have noted, the one aspect I didn't like was the uncertainty in portions/prices for a dine-in meal. It seems you just tell them what you want, and they measure out arbitrary amounts. Although the amount turned out alright, it was a bit unnerving not knowing or having full control over how much I was getting/paying. Would be nice if they could establish a more transparent system."], ["Scott S.", "Wonderful environment, clean, extremely friendly, inviting and most importantly exceptional food.

Jeweled rice was interesting (think rice pilaf with dried fruit instead of pilaf) but one-note and the moroccan olives were underwhelming. for the amount of spice paste on the cured black olives, there wasn't much taste. The Merguez meatballs were soft and accompanied with an orange-red sauce that was tasty, but it didn't have any spiciness at all. The Lentel soup with swiss chard was quite good. The service was great but quite slow. This place is also direly lacking a sandwich option. Where's the schwarma or falafel or any type of sandwich?

Their stuffed grape leaves are also good. For dessert, they sell gelato with some very unique flavors including lavender and Turkish coffee.
