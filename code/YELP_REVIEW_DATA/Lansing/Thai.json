I got the spring rolls and chicken pad ped medium. There was only one waitress which was okay because it wasn't busy at all. She was initially attentive but then it seemed like she no longer cared once she took our order. Usually spring rolls come out quickly because they are flash fried. It took probably 20 minutes for our food to arrive and it arrived one at a time, she didn't bring all of our food out together so it was really awkward. We were also the only patrons in the restaurant at that time, I can't imagine how long it would take to get food if they were actually busy, probably an hour or so. The spring rolls were pretty bad. They were all rice noodles, there was one tiny piece of carrot and that's about it. The sauce wasn't the typical sweet vinegar sauce, it was like an orange duck sauce which wasn't particularly appealing. My curry was decent but they use the cheapest cuts of meat and there was some globs of fat I had to pick out. The flavor was good, I just wish they would have used good meat instead of really crappy stuff. I would not eat the seafood here based on the quality of chicken they gave me. It was super cheap, though. For three entr\u00e9es and an order of spring rolls it was $25."], ["Benjamin C.", "I've been here twice now and the food was incredible both times. I really like this place. I've had the sweet and spicy chicken and the drunken noodles with chicken, both were excellent. My friend got the pepper steak and said that she really enjoyed hers as well. The crab rangoon is some of the best I've ever had, and the plum sauce they give you is perfect for dunking them. Soup came with both my meals. My choices were egg drop or something spicy, I can't recall the name, I went with egg drop and it was phenomenal. Maybe the best I've ever had. I am really picky about my egg drop because more often then not it tastes too strongly of egg. This had a subtle egg flavoring but the soup was more of a broth. It had cabbage and green onion in it which is what really put it over the top for me. Lots of menu options for vegetarians. Both my meals came with lots very well prepared veggies.The service is good. No problems at all. With a place like this you come here to stuff your face with incredible food, not to worry about great customer service. The server was polite, prompt and even cracked a few jokes with me. I'd come get their food even if they insulted me every time I walked in the door.I only wish I lived closer. I would visit this restaurant on a frequent basis."], ["Jessy B.", "Tried this place a few more times and it was just never authentic. \u00a0It's like they use bottled sauce or something. \u00a0Nothing ever seemed fresh and it turned into a congealed glob pretty quickly once it cooled down......I've had my fair share of delicious Thai so maybe I'm just picky.....but yeah this isn't my go-to place...."], ["Samantha S.", "Food came out pretty quick and was delicious!

I did give it one star because the food was very inexpensive, and it was prepared very quickly. PSYCH! I gave it one star because Yelp won't let me give it zero. A couple of points to start off with here:(a) Thai cuisine is one of my favorites, and I eat it often(b) I haven't gotten on to write a review in quite some time, but the horrendous food prepared by this restaurant inspired me to do soIf there was a choice between never eating Thai food again for the rest of my life and eating one more time at Thai village, I'd be willing to completely forego Thai food forever. I ordered the \"Drunken Noodles.\" I'm not sure if the noodles were intoxicated, but they can't have been prepared by a sober person. They were flavorless and overcooked. I don't know this for a fact, but I'm relatively certain that these noodles were cooked in crude oil. (You could get better Thai food from one of those prepared packets in the Asian section of the grocery store. \u00a0If this is the best Thai food in Lansing...wow.)I don't usually like to waste food, but I paid for my meal and left after two bites. I had to go to a freakishly fast sandwich shop nearby so that I could manage to get lunch during my break.On the upside, if Thai Village would consider cutting down their oil consumption, it's entirely possible that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil without having to resort to fracking."], ["Rebecca G.", "Love love love this place. The Siam rolls are simply awesome! The homemade soups are fab especially the Gai Tom Kha. As for entrees, my go to is the P2-Pad Ped Beef (onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and eggplant). So good!!!

Rotten-tasting food. Loud TVs."], ["Amanda D.", "When my husband and I stopped in for a quick dinner, we experienced so-so food with pretty bad service. This was especially surprising considering we were one of two couples in the entire restaurant.It took over 20 minutes for our appetizer to arrive (Siam Rolls...these were actually pretty good). My entree was delivered first with no comment from the waitress about when my husband's would arrive. In fact, she didn't speak much to us at all after she took our orders. When my husband's meal was finally delivered to the table, we were very short on time and he asked for the check and a couple of boxes. The waitress soon returned with both, wordlessly tossing the check at him. Had she been bustling around serving several tables this behavior would have been slightly more understandable, but she was spending her time sitting alone behind the front counter.We didn't eat much of our meals, but what we did eat was just okay. Definitely no where near good enough to overlook the poor customer service. We wound up throwing out our leftovers later that night.If you're looking for good Thai food, I recommend Taste of Thai in EL or Thai Princess in Okemos. We keep hoping to find good Thai food closer to our home on the west side, but so far that just hasn't panned out."], ["Keith L.", "I can't get enough of P18 (Peanut Curry) and P19 (yellow curry)! Its so good. Great location with pretty good service. It gets really busy during lunch but I know when to beat the crowds so I always have a good time.

We went for dinner at 8:00 on a Monday night and got a spot right outside the door.Dinner here includes hot and sour soup which you almost never get anymore. It was very good and definitely had a little kick to it. We ordered the crab rangoons and the veggie spring rolls to start. The rangoons (5) were delicious, fresh with a great flavor and the sauce was extra citrusy. Spring rolls (2) were pretty standard (and very hot). For our entree we got the Pad See Ew which I am always hesitant to do at new places since I'm pretty picky about the dish, but we were very pleased! We ordered it medium with tofu. It was just the right heat, the broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked, and there was lots of gravy which is key! Total bill for two apps, two soups and one entree was $13.50. What?! Awesome. Couldn't even finish all the food between two of us, so looking forward to some very good leftovers later tonight. Between the low prices, nice service, and delicious food, this place was a winner. We'll be back.EDIT: Changed from five to four stars after a couple more visits with friends. We've had two distinct dishes included the Pad Thai here that taste fine but have a VERY strong smell...I won't get into specifics but definitely something you don't want your food smelling like :P \u00a0We've been sticking with the Pad Se-eew since then and still love it."]], "Thai Princess": [], "Thailand": [], "Fortune House": [], "Taste of Thai": [], "New Thai Kitchen": [], "No Thai!": [], "Bangkok House": [["Brad F.", "Easily the best Thai food in the area.

The dining area reminds me of typical economy asian restaurants/diners. A slew of tables with not many people around. The service seemed like family owned. Very casual and heavily accented. Very friendly as well.The menu was grand and someone like me, who wants to try everything, was overwhelmed but I settled on something that my tastebuds could handle. The intro was a broth soup with onions and a dumpling or two. I apologize for not knowing the name. The soup could have been my meal, it was perfect and soothing. I'll be back here mid winter. My main course was medium heat. Of course I don't remember the name of the dish, but I do remember the heat and flavor. Thai food, GOOD thai food has both. I had to take it slow and steady. My friend had the well known pad thai at low heat. The taste was a sweet spice and I spent more time digging my fork into his plate than my own. I used his dish to settle the heat. Servings were plentiful, I took my dish home, this was recommended because my host noted the heat would simmer after reheating and the flavors blending. It did but it was still fire.

One of my favorite things to get here is the spring rolls with this amazing sauce that comes with it. I'm not sure what they put in this sauce but it's A1! \u00a0Also make sure you try the cucumber soup.

They renovated the restaurant a little while back so it is much more aesthetically pleasing. I still get takeout, typically, so the d\u00e9cor didn't matter much to me. Bangkok House is a family business and they typically only have one worker on the floor, she takes orders in the restaurant and via telephone, delivers food to tables, rings people up and even helps in the kitchen at times. They really need to hire more staff.Two months ago, I called ahead for takeout and was told it would be 30 minutes. I arrived on time and there was a line nearly out the door. We were all waiting for our orders and the poor worker was running around like crazy since the dining room was full too. I waited another 30 minutes in the restaurant for my order. An hour for takeout is pretty obscene. Then just this week, I ordered takeout again. I ordered spring rolls and chicken gang ped, hot. The lady repeated the order back to me on the phone and told me it would be 10 minutes. I showed up, she repeated the order to me again, handed me the bag, and I paid. There was no one in the restaurant at the time I picked up my food. I got home and I had an order of spring rolls and beef masaman curry. It was good but it wasn't what I wanted/ordered.
