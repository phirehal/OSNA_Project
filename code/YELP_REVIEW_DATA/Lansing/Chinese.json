I keep giving them a chance but am ready to give up on them with the exception of one dish, the almond boneless chicken. Although this dish is a creation born in Detroit restaurants and not \"Chinese\" except that it's birthplace was in a Chinese restaurant, it's a dish I truly crave a few times a year. Battered boneless chicken breast served with a thick light brown gravy, any transplanted Detroiter that has ever had it knows that outside of Detroit it's next to impossible to find. So for this reason only I will keep Little Panda on my list for a few times a year. We had been eating at Little Panda for many years with no complaint but as I said things changed. The sauce on the table used to be so good and they stopped using it, I suspect kitchen staff changed as some of the other dishes became something very different than they had been. The vegetables are not as fresh or cooked as well, the chicken in dishes that are not battered and fried have sometimes not been completely cooked, or over cooked to dry toughness. Some of the dishes look the same but the seasoning is different; off, not the harmonious flavors of the past. The sweet dishes have gotten too sweet and several occasions the egg rolls tasted old; very cabbagy and tough instead of crisp. This having been our go-to Chinese restaurant for many years, it's disappointing to no longer be able to count it."], ["Natasha R.", "I wish this rating had more stars! I LOVE Little Panda and miss it so much. I have to note, though, that I have only been here for Dim Sum and not for lunch/dinner. So this review will be for Dim Sum.Dim Sum I believe is served on weekends until either 11 or 12pm. My friends from Florida came to visit and we all went there for DS and they were amazed by a) how good the food was and b) how inexpensive it was.Some of our favorites are: Green Onion Cakes, Taro (something purple and friend, cant remember the name), fried dumplings, sesame balls, ribs, spring rolls (my fav!) and shrimp or beef in rice noodle. There are so many things to chose from but I'm not much for seafood, so that might be something you'd like to try! I;ve never had anything I didn't like. The hot tea you are served is also very tasty and great on a cold day.Service is great, atmosphere is nice, sometimes can get pretty full but I don't recall ever having to wait for a table."], ["Nate L.", "This wasn't the first restaurant that came to our minds on Sunday, but was the only restaurant open at the time. Little Panda reminds me of a long-standing Chinese restaurant in my hometown. In fact, it reminds me a several Midwestern Chinese restaurants. I sense a theme.Since it was a Sunday, we were seated promptly and served with tea immediately. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with the tea, but it wasn't anything to crow about either. Since this establishment had a reputation for high food volume with a higher than expected price, a friend and I decided to split a dinner. Apparently, the lunch specials are more reasonable, but we missed it by a few hours. This proved to be a perfect move, as there was even too much for for two people. Our dish, the orange chicken, came out in an acceptable timeframe and was served with steamed rice. The first comment out of my mouth was about the sauce. It looked extremely thick and syrupy. It tasted like it, too. The meal was extremely sweet; it was almost so sweet it wasn't spicy, as the peppers were coated in sauce. Overall, this place is OK, but I can definitely find better Chinese elsewhere."], ["Mr. B.", "Sub-par at best. \u00a0I ordered the sweet and sour chicken dinner & paid the extra $1.75 for fried rice (total was $12.46 with no drink). \u00a0The portion was adequate, although I easily cleaned my plate and had no leftovers to take with me. \u00a0Quality was meh... Maybe I'm spoiled, but in metro Detroit I can easily find twice the quality & twice the quantity for half the price! \u00a0Service was not all that great, it was speedy but I was never even asked if I wanted something to drink other than water ... \u00a0I will not be returning."], ["Lorraine H.", "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Favorite dishes are cashew chicken and garlic chicken. Best eggrolls in the city. Seems to be family-owned. The young man at the desk is quiet and curt, but that's just his nature. Don't take it personal. Become a regular and he's really nice. I go there often with a book for a late lunch. Quick service, and they don't mind if you hang out for a while. Generous portions, tasty food, dinner prices are a little high but lunch is reasonable. I always get a \"doggie-bag.\" On the wheelchair-accessible issue: the restaurant itself is accessible, but getting in is another story. The foyer is extremely small and you have to make a sharp left to get in. If they would remove the potted plants and unused coat rack, there would be more room. The outer door has been repaired or replaced and now it is no longer heavy and difficult to open."], ["Moash S.", "I love this place. My husband and I used to go for lunch almost everyday when we worked together.
