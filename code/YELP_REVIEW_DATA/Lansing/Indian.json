The great thing about this place is it sticks to the true Indian flavors, rather than simply responding to White tastebuds. We were not impressed by their serving dishes. Not congruent to this type of cuisine.

I have taken this bus service several times to Chicago and back when Amtrak is not available. Each time I regret it. On a trip last two years ago the bus was over 3 hours late without any explanation. The bus also was sold out so when we got to Grand Rapids they had to turn away people because there wasn't enough seats. The last trip I took the bus driver left East Lansing early before the scheduled departure time of 3:00pm. I arrived at the station at 2:50pm but as soon as I got there the Greyhound driver told me that the Indian Trail bus had already left. I had to get a ride from my friend to the Lansing station. When we got to the Lansing station and I questioned the driver about leaving early started saying things like I should have arrived early and that I was \u00a0getting \"tissy\"with him. \u00a0He refused to give me his name so that I could complain about him. According to him several buses up north were delayed because of the snow. We ended up going back to East Lansing and the Lansing station in order to look for passengers. \u00a0When my wife was talking to me and was clearly upset \u00a0about the situation the bus driver \u00a0then asked her if she had a question \u00a0when she asked about the reason for the delay he proceeded to verbally challenge her while explaining that he just picked up five passengers. We ended leaving the Lansing area about an hour late. I don't have a problem with riding the bus I just have a problem with Indian Trails lousy customer service. Again only take this if you have no other options."]], "Sindhu Indian Cuisine": [["Tim M.", "Great chicken tikka masala. I have ctm at least once a month and this is the best I've had in a really long time."], ["Ed T.", "I was nervous about Sindhu: \u00a0it's a little Indian joint in a mini mall in a college town. \u00a0The decor is sparse and the service is remarkably bad.(No, really: \u00a0it's horrible. \u00a0A few totally disinterested young ladies, almost certainly the daughters of the owner -- only their parents would have refused to fire them.)But the food is really quite good. \u00a0All the typical fare you'd expect in an Indian restaurant: \u00a0masalas and vindaloos, naan and lassi, all very well made and flavorful. \u00a0Plus several days a week, they offer a Southern Indian menu."], ["David M.", "It was here that I discovered that I love Indian food, so Sindhu has a special place in my heart as well as my tummy. \u00a0Na'an is amazing, as are all of the dishes. \u00a0Anything with lamb in it from here makes me melt, and though it's pricey it's well worth the price. \u00a0And quite conducive to sharing, which is a huge plus in my book."], ["Hannah H.", "Okay, I'm so happy to be able to say that I've found my \"go to\" Indian place since moving from California! \u00a0This place is amazing, my hubby took me for the first time last night and absolutely loved both the chicken korma and lamb vindaloo! \u00a0And when we said we wanted spicy, they truly did bring on the heat.The garlic naan bread was okay (could've used a little more garlic in my opinion) but the basmati was very ample!I felt like the service was fast and attentive. \u00a0More importantly, the place was packed for a Saturday night (which is always a great sign)!"], ["Ed S.", "Sindhu's has great food, but it's not perfect. \u00a0You can order most dishes as mild, medium, or hot - beware that they're serious when they say \"hot.\" \u00a0The lunch buffet is limited, but tasty. \u00a0The dining area is a little claustrophobic, but nice.The prices are a bit much - expect to spend about $20 per person and not to have any leftovers. \u00a0I called once to make a reservation for a large group for a day that I expected to be very busy. \u00a0I called back on the day of to confirm the reservation and was told that, not only do they not have a reservation book, but they weren't even going to be open at the time I made my reservation..."], ["Jason B.", "I must admit, I'm a bit of an Indian food snob. I worked at an amazing Indian restaurant and was spoiled with the absolute best I've ever had. I haven't had Indian food even close to it....until I ate at Sindhu. Their restaurant decor and atmosphere is a little lacking, but the food is solid. I recommend the samosas. The malai kofta was a bit weird (sausage shaped and too doughy, but tasty still). The lamb vindaloo was great, if not a bit too spicy. I'm excited to try the rest of the menu. Reasonably priced....$38 for two with tip (including two appetizers, two entre\u00e9s)."], ["Jenny G.", "This place was awesome! I had one of the lamb dishes (can't remember the name) and it was probably the best I've ever had. My only regret is wasting space on the naan, it was fine but wish I would have waited for the rice and lamb dish."], ["Misi P.", "Punjabi Remix!!!!I love Indian food, and Sindhu has a great daily lunch buffet for about $8. \u00a0All you can eat! \u00a0It's only available M-F, I think, so perfect for that midday-I'm starving-my-arse-off meal. \u00a0The only downside to it is that if you have to go back to work in the afternoon, you had better come prepared with the Febreze in the back seat. \u00a0Like I said, I love Indian, but I swear you will go back to work, fumigating your office with the scent of curry coming from your pores...well worth it though. \u00a0This is.....the remix!"], ["Lyndsay C.", "My first visit to Sindhu's actually began my love of Indian food....and since it is best Indian restaurant around for miles in East Lansing, I would have to say it is my favorite restaurant. HOWEVER, there are some things that should be noted:1) They do not serve dosa or other South Indian dishes from Thursday-Sunday (at least within the past year). I think they do that in order to have more guests during the weeknights, but...it's just not a good idea. If they are the best (and only good) Indian restaurant in town, they should make South Indian dishes everyday. Very sneaky...2) The service is not superb. Don't expect to feel like a welcomed guest most of the time...especially when they are about to close...therefore, don't go late....and that is pretty much the bad news. Good news: fabulous dishes (my favorites: Paneer Makhani, Veg Makhani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mutter Paneer, tomato soup - not sure if you'd consider that rasam) ...I'm sure other restaurants+indian home cooking have more extravagant spices + flavors...but when I just want a tasty, rich dish...Sindhus can do no wrong!!

Take it from someone's who's indian-it's pretty good! The food was fresh and everything tasted great. Since it's a buffet on Sunday, I would suggest getting there early (12pm) if you want \u00a0the fresh dosas."]]}
