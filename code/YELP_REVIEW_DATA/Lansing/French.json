I have lived downtown for 5 years and simply cannot understand how horrible wait service is the standard. And it has never changed. \u00a0If you want lunch at MBC you have to allot at least an hour and a half to get in and out. I'm not joking. But...I always go back. Because the food is so good. It really is. They must have a new-ish chef. Their menu has come a long way.However...what prompted me to write this review is ordering the buffalo chix sandwich and asking for it with no onions. The waiter said \"no mods.\" \"What?\" (I thought he said \"no mas.\") \"No mods.\" He repeated. \"I'm sorry, can you explain?\" \"NO MODIFICATIONS. But, you can pick the onion off.\" I was speechless for a few moments. It is 2015, you are paying $14 for a sandwich, and they refuse to serve it to you without putting onions on it. \u00a0I'm sorry, but no. That is completely unacceptable, in this day and age. Probably will be back, but not often."], ["Annemarie H.", "Dined at Midtown today with a group from work and truly could not wait to get back to the office to write this review - my first on Yelp. Our dining experience began with the waitress coming out and telling us that there were to be absolutely no modifications, per head chef's rules because the chef has put together offerings she believes taste good together and she's not going to have any lowly peasants f-ing up her creations. Oh...KAY! It's a new menu since the time I was there last and not an improvement, if you ask me. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. When our food came out, I found that mine was inedible. Honestly, I think the sauce or the tomato (or something) had gone off. It just did not taste good. And, the fries were limp and luke-warm; same for my co-worker who asked to have hers well done (which they ignored, I guess that's a modification). At any rate, I flagged the waitress after trying a second bite of my sandwich, after scraping as much of the blue cheese sauce off as possible. I told her it did not taste good and that I didn't want to eat or pay for it. Not 2 minutes later, out marches the chef (all 22 years of her) - but she didn't come to apologize. No, no! She came to tell me that the tomatoes they serve are grown hydroponically and they pay almost $2 a piece for them so that can't possibly be the problem. Basically, she came out to tell me that I was wrong about my lunch, despite the fact I was the one trying to eat it. I eat out a fair amount and have been to a wide range of restaurants, and I have never had such an experience in my life. Someone needs to check her ego! Bottom line to me... this is yet another place that's trying too hard to be something it's not. It's a brew pub. It should have interesting, but still pretty middle of the road fare. And, if someone doesn't want a sunny side up egg on top of their crab cakes, that should be their prerogative! I didn't go to Midtown frequently in the past, but considered it a solid option for some types of circumstances. I will not return, under any circumstance. If I were the wait staff, I'd be pissed because there's no way this chef's attitude isn't affecting business and tips."], ["Erica D.", "Very cool surprise. Our bartender was amazing!

It just no longer brews it's own poor quality beer and now they sell other breweries good quality beers; so they changed their name to reflect that; thus dropping the word \"brewing\" from the name.---------------------Midtown Beer Company (MBC) used to be affiliated with MBC (the Michigan Brewing Company) an actual brewery that used to be located in Williamston. MBC's (the brewery) beer wasn't very good and apparently MBC (the brewery) wasn't very good at paying their rent so suffice it say: they folded and the Lansing pub changed its name and started carrying other Michigan crafts (which was a substantial step up in beer quality). MBC (the pub) offers the traditional selection of pub fare (Reuben's, burgers, chicken wings, etc...). None of it is extraordinary, it may in fact be a bit overpriced, but it's not bad by any means. The real issue with MBC is the venue. Located at the far south end of the downtown Lansing-Washington sq businesses, MBC is a large open space with high vaulted ceilings featuring poor acoustics. As a result it requires very few people to be present before the noise gets out of control. Which makes the decision to push the tables to the wall and feature local musicians a confusing one. Don't get me wrong - I love music and want to support local musicians but the acoustics are so shoddy and the lack of any real performing space really kills the experience. MBC would be a significantly better pub if they just installed some noise dampening foam or heavy fabric drapes. Additionally, MBC should consider reorienting it's furniture; as it is the layout is disjointed and doesn't lend itself to the performers well; every time musicians arrive the bar looses effective seating. As it is the noise makes the bar to uncomfortable for me to remain for more than one drink during peak hours. I'm sure I'm not the only one..."], ["Catalin B.", "I like this place. For me it's convenient because I live across the street and it's open late. So if I want a good brew or a nice meal, later in the evening, Midtown is a sure thing. The beer is good. It's a little heavy on the IPAs. They had a phenomenal Carmel Wheat and a great Coconut Stout that I enjoyed. \u00a0When it comes to beer, if you're a hophead this place is for you. The cocktails are still being refined. Of course it's a brewery, so expectation management is key. That being said, they have fresh herbs and the bartenders are smart and open-minded. They can make up just about anything and are always willing to experiment. The food is really creative for pub food. They have the great burgers and assortment of fried food normally found at a bar but they also have lobster grilled cheese sandwiches and a bistro streak salad layered with greens, hash, made to order steak and topped with an egg. The wings are also amazing if you're looking for jumbo sized, smoked wings with a near perfect amount of heat. The service is polite but it is slow. This is especially true around lunch time. This has to do with the volume of costumers. If catching a quick meal when you're on a tight clock is your plan, this isn't the place. This \u00a0is a cool brewery where you go if you have a little time to relax and enjoy the food and company of friends.

The host needs a rain check though. :) \u00a08/26th/15"], ["Ashley S.", "The service has been inconsistent, causing me to have mixed feelings about this place. \u00a0My first experience at HopCat was great. Interesting selection of beer and the buffalo chicken rolls were AMAZING. \u00a0The fish& Chips, and crack fries were also pretty good. Second time around I had tried the pita chips and beerbar cheese. Ehh.. Big mistake. The pita chips tasted stale and the beerbar cheese is cold and chunky. It's like horseradish + cottage cheese. During my third visit is when I experienced the most problems. Our server seemed annoyed and didn't want to be there. She brought our beer in different glasses than listed on the menu. It's not a huge deal but it was a few ounces smaller. When we asked her about it she said sometimes the bartenders get confused but it's still the correct beer. We were still charged full price even though they were smaller. That night I also ordered the \"swiss, cheddar, feta, tomato and onion Grilled Cheese\". Sounds like an awesome grilled cheese! If only if were grilled... The cheese wasn't even melted. \u00a0I took my entire sandwich home and grilled it myself. (fully cooked it was actually really good). A huge sign that a customer isn't enjoying their food is when they don't even eat it. HopCat has the potential to be great but they seem to go downhill once they get busy."], ["Melissa D.", "Beer (even for craft brew) is overly pricey. Bar service was slow. On the plus side they have a large selection of beer and plenty of bar seating."], ["John K.", "I like Hop Cat I Grand Rapids and this one in East Lansing is ok but has a much different \"vibe\" and decor. Convenient from MSUs campus and has a parking garage pretty much next door so you can find a nearby parking spot pretty easily. It was busy on this visit but it was the other time I was here as well. Our waitress isn't that great, taking a LONG time between being seated and taking our drink order and then another long wait just to get the beer each of us ordered. Waiting on food but hasn't been that long...yet. So great place for lots of beer variety and a decent food menu, but today at least, not impressed with attentiveness or speed of service."], ["Tara L.", "3.5 starsWe had gone to the original location in Grand Rapids about a month ago, and had a fun time, so needless to say, we were stoked that they were going to open up a closer location in East Lansing near MSU.On the agenda was to actually eat something, as our first visit to the GRR location was just about trying out some drinks and hanging out. So, we along with two other friends met up at 11am on a Saturday to enjoy some grub.The location is convenient to the stadium at MSU, so if you're looking to tailgate, this is another place to consider. Parking is pretty affordable at the Grove St. parking garage, and right adjacent to the restaurant. Upon entering, you'll see the HopCat restaurant signage along a concrete building. I'm not sure if this is standard protocol, but on the day we went, they checked ID before you could even enter the restaurant. I'm guessing that it was only because there was a football game going on, but be prepared if this happens on a daily basis.Since we arrived earlier in the day, we didn't have to wait to be seated. Once seated, our friendly server came by with menus and we had a look. After much thought, Husband and I went with The Classic burger ($8.95), and the Dam Good Fish sandwich ($9.95). Each came with a side of crack fries, but you could add a cup of soup, side salad, or Mac and cheese for an additional $2.95.While we were waiting, we sampled some of their extensive beer options. I tried the raspberry ale, and Husband had a grapefruit ale. Both were great tasting on its own, but paired even better with the food. Since I'm not a big drinker, I had a half, and it was $3. (Size a little bigger than a shot) Husband had a full and it was $7 for 16 oz.Food came out about 15 minutes after we placed our orders, and it looked great. I loved my fish sandwich because of the spicy and smoky paprika they used to season the tilapia. The breading was super light, and the fish meat was very moist. I loved the housemade tartar sauce, as it provided the perfect pickled undertone needed with the fish. The red onion was crunchy and the lettuce tomato were crisp. The toasted brioche bun was light and fluffy, and slightly crunchy..liked it a lot. Great balance, and definitely worth ordering if you're a fan of fish sandwiches. Husbands burger looked great, and the portion was standard, and the burger patty was cooked perfectly at medium. Once we added some Tabasco to the pepper jack lettuce and tomato combo, the flavor was just right. Crack fries were just that, addicting!!! Salt, pepper, and sugar make it very irresistible. I can't imagine what it's like loaded.We'd come back if we were in the neck of the woods, but don't expect the decor and ambiance to be the same as the Grand Rapids location. This one is definitely tailored to the University crowd. But for bar food? It is pretty good."], ["Megan K.", "I've been to Hopcat twice now but the first time I only ordered an appetizer so I wanted to hold out for the review until I actually ate an entr\u00e9e. Both times there was a short wait but the servers have always been friendly and prompt. The restaurant has a laidback vibe to it, I can't explain. It's not divey, it's not pretentious, but it's not overly rowdy either. Now, I don't even really like beer that much, but I like this place. There are so many beers on tap that even I can find something I like. The wheat beers and fruit beers are my favorite. The first time I went, my boyfriend and I shared the beerbar cheese. Yeah, skip that shit, it sucks. The menu says \"cheese with a zip\", I guess I was expecting a zesty, spicy cheese. Nope, it's horseradish with chunky, cold cheese. Not good. The second time, I got the beef sandwich. The meat is marinated in beer, caramelized, put on a bun with blue cheese peppercorn spread, and fried onions. It's pretty much the best thing ever. The fries were pretty good too."], ["Lindsey A.", "Work out your service kinks and I think we can be 5-star friends, Hop Cat, but yesterday, one of my tacos went ice-cold by the time my extra cheese sauce arrived, and, well, that's just no fun.I graduated from MSU in 2005 and there was nothing near Hop Cat in the city. Maybe Harper's, but that's a stretch as their beer selection pales in comparison to the Cat's. I mean, Short's Soft Parade ALWAYS on tap?! I'm sold.But the two times I've made a stop in EL whilst driving back to Chicago, the service has been lackluster... or just lacking. I know our waiter was SLAMMED yesterday - which, management, why is he busing his own tables? You should have busers just like you have food servers....... but, my food went damn near frozen while waiting for some extra cheese sauce. Then, despite it taking well over 10 minutes to get the sauce, he still charged me a dollar for it. Come on, knock the sauce off and maybe we'd see 4 stars up there.The food is great - fattening, delicious, hangover-sopping-up goodness. The beers are out of this world. The space is 'cool' and huge and the music on Sunday was spot-on.We weren't in a hurry, which I'm glad we weren't, but if you are.... maybe look elsewhere."], ["Tabitha M.", "First, it's a great space located right next to a parking garage. \u00a0I love the decor (think vintage fashion mags in the ladies room and playboy's in the mens). \u00a0Comfy high top seating (and since not all of my party was present when I arrived, the host asked if a high table would be okay). \u00a0We had brunch, which was delicious. 2 apps, 3 entrees and 2 1/2 beers for $65. \u00a0I'd go back again in a heartbeat."], ["Christopher N.", "Stellar selection of beer. \u00a0The menu showcases the local offerings for a traveler like me. \u00a0The olive burger, while not the healthiest fare, was delicious and cooked perfectly. \u00a0It was hard to get a seat as a \"party\" of one."], ["Bee S.", "Soooo jealous this wasn't here when I was at MSU. Went here before a football game recently with some friends and loved it. I had been to the one in Grand Rapids and liked it, but this one definitely has a different feel. More college-y and less hipster I guess. 2-stories, and all the windows on the lower level make it feel really open and spacious. The beer menu is fantastic. I love that it promotes tons of locally brewed beers in Michigan. The food was good too - I got the quesadilla and maybe it's the beer talking, but it was THE BEST QUESADILLA EVER. Seriously. The spicy black beans made it for me. Everyone else got a burger with the crack fries, and although I'm not a huge french fry person, those fries were indeed CRACK FRIES. Really peppery and yummy. The kitchen and waitresses were slammed due to the game, but our waitress was freaking awesome, running around and doing her absolute best. It may have taken a while to get our food, but honestly, it's not like we were in a hurry and I know the staff was all working hard, so gotta give credit where credit is due. Overall, great time. If I still lived in EL, this would be a regular spot for sure. Especially since it's within walking distance to everything and right in the niche of EL nightlife anyway."], ["Jamie P.", "Yes, go. \u00a0I've been twice. \u00a0The Damn Good Fish Sandwich is well...good. \u00a0The second visit I went out on a limb and got the Pork Sandwich that Knocks. \u00a0My waitress advised it was very large so I had it cut in half. \u00a0I'm glad I did. \u00a0I had only eaten 2 small pretzel nuggets and I could barely finish the 1st half. My mouth waters thinking about it.I'm not big on the crack fries, but they are not bad. \u00a0The pretzel bites are wonderful fresh out the oven. \u00a0The holiday beer/shake menu looked amazing. \u00a0Unfortunately I was here during work hours so I couldn't try any. \u00a0They have a special event they advertised for in January where the dessert is bacon wrapped chocolate stuffed dates. \u00a0OMG If you have a problem talk with management politely about it. \u00a0I would also suggest that if you are on a time limit to notify your server as soon as they arrive."], ["Bob J.", "The beer alone is 5-stars. They have lots of hard-to-find brews on tap. For instance, I had Dogfish Head's 120-minute IPA and their Raison d'Extra, both 18% ABV, in the same meal. Their fries and cheese sauce are also great, as is the friendly staff.However, there are many menu errors that make this not a 5-star place. The vegetarian chili came with sour cream (which my girlfriend hates), but that was not listed. The website also said the 120-minute was in a 10-oz snifter, but we were given the tiny 5-oz sampler glasses. Also tonight, my medium rare Cowboy burger was a bit overdone, cooked at a medium, with no detectable BBQ sauce.Overall we'll be returning many times. It's a great place, as long as it's not packed with college kids..."], ["Abigail L.", "I LOVE HopCat. \u00a0This place has only been around for a year, but it's just glorious. So much craft beer. \u00a0So much Michigan craft beer. \u00a0It rotates and they always have a selection of seasonal beers. \u00a0I can't get over how truly amazing this bar is. \u00a0And the food is always A+. \u00a0I recommend the loaded crack fries and the classic burger, but also the cheese ale soup if you're looking for something more to eat.I could talk about the service for ages, the waitstaff is busy but no matter what always manages to serve you in a reasonable amount of time. \u00a0I've always had very friendly service and due to the large (somewhat intimidating) beer menu, the servers are always very good for a recommendation.The music can be pretty loud at night and in the evening, but earlier in the day it's a bit softer. \u00a0The many televisions upstairs are great for watching games and honestly, so is the bar, but the nice thing about the second floor is you can arrange the tables (or have them arranged) to view the TV how you like when your game is on.There isn't very much by way of street parking but there is a parking lot and a parking garage close by, though you have to pay by the half hour to park there - Sunday is free parking though, just like the rest of East Lansing. \u00a0Another good thing to remember is that minors/anyone under the age of 21 needs to be accompanied by someone over the age of 21 before 10 pm and if you look old enough, you'll be carded to enter. \u00a0No cover, just to make things run smoothly."], ["E G.", "Outstanding variety of brews. Great food. Loaded sloppy Crack Fries...need I say more. Tasting dinners are FUN! \u00a0Great service during normal hours. Managers know how to recover from a service oops. We were VERY impressed!"], ["Lylian D.", "Hop Cat has an awesome selection of beers. I have only had the Crack fries here, but if the Crack fries are any indication of how good the food can be, then I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. Hop Cat is a great place to go for a chill night of drinking over a basket of their addicting Crack Fries. My sister let me know that during the weekdays from 4-6 Hop Cat has a burger and beer deal for only $6! She said the burger is pretty good, but I am going to have to try it for myself."], ["Becky F.", "Great beer and food. Service is slow when it's really busy. Love the crack fries and fish tacos."], ["Matt C.", "Best burger deal in town from 4-6 PM M-F. Largest tap selection in town, but you pay the price. Happy hour is limited to the \"standard 20,\" and it has the worst hours (2-4, M-F). Most of the sandwiches are dry, but the stars are for the knowledgeable beer servers and excellent staff: Fast, efficient, and knowledgable. The Bloody Mary bar on Sunday is spectacular, especially with the infused tequilas. I know that sounds wrong, but it's awesome."], ["Josh G.", "This was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the Angry Bird and the chicken was grilled to perfection! The sauce had the perfect hint of spice and tang. The fries were also crispy, which I like and tasted great with the buffalo wing style sauce that came with the sandwich. Overall, a great dive with even greater food and drink. Definitely coming back again!"], ["Ashley Z.", "Absolutely love this place. The burgers and the crack fries are just unreal. So delish and yummy. I would def recommend to a friend"], ["Andy R.", "We're from out of town and looking for a late lunch. Two different people recommend HopCat. So why not? Bonus: M-F 2pm-4pm $3 beers from their top 20 list stocked with great selection of Michigan beer. Crack fries, meh, maybe I'm the only person who doesn't love them? The fries were OK, I must have gotten a soggy batch. The burger was the star attraction: Nach-Yo burger with avocado and pepper jack cheese is a nice pairing. Server was prompt with drinks and taking orders, but two small downers: the food did not all arrive at the same time and the beers were not topped off. Visited again the next night for more beer. Sat near the bar. Great server with good knowledge of the beer. Beer selections alone makes this an easy four stars."]], "Coach's All American Pub & Grill": []}
