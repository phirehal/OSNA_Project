I recommend the Moe's Special with a Greek Salad as a side. The chicken is seasoned perfectly with their blend of spices and the Greek salad tastes crisp and fresh. If you're a vegetarian, no problem! Order the vegi grape leaves and I promise you won't be let down. The grape leaves go perfectly with their homemade hummus! Lastly, if you're looking for a sweet dessert, order their baklava! They make it fresh and its homemade unless you want the prepackaged baklava which isn't! I recommend the homemade baklava. At 75 cents each you can't go wrong with the crunch of the layer upon layers of crust and the sweet crunchy yet tender inside of nuts and sugar!

Just not as bad as the grape leaves.I noticed from other reviews there were bread issues so I prepared myself. Yep, I experienced bread failure. If you have ever had FRESH pita bread you know what I mean. Fresh they're like little warm soft pillows of love. First basket he brought out was cold and tough to chew into. Next basket was piping hot but hard as a brick. But not burnt. That tells me they took some old stale ones and threw them in the microwave or oven.

The decor is plain, no theme or fanciness. There is a pleasant lack of advertising on the walls. One of the owners was very chatty in a friendly way, asked me if this was my first visit. He talked with me and made me feel comfortable. I have to admit, the men who work there are VERY good-looking! Harry's is a great place to relax and get a bite to eat for lunch or dinner without feeling out of place or intimidated. Definitely going back a lot! This will become my home-town bar, I've been looking for one and finally found it!"], ["the t.", "Greek burger w olive sauce is the bomb."], ["Paul T.", "We do take-out pizza from Harry's every other week, which is a lot for us. It definitely beats any delivery you can get in Lansing. Pretty much standard midwest style pizza with medium-thin crust, standard list of toppings. Reasonable prices. The crowd at Harry's Place varies wildly, both in size and in general tenor. Sometimes the place is jammed, noisy and rockin'; other times only a few boozy regulars haunt the bar. People seem to like the fish fry, but I've not tried it. I do order the burgers and largish orders of good but not particularly special fries. Full bar with pretty standard list of choices. All in all the place feels pretty down home. Service is friendly and I like Harry's a lot."], ["Mark W.", "New favorite lunch spot ... laid back atmosphere; outdoors seating; quality food & a great variety. \u00a0Going to have the Half-pound Greek burger on my next visit."], ["Douglas F.", "Reading the last review, I would have to say that that's pretty much accurate. Harry's Place is steeped with GM & Lansing history. I have very fond memories of Harry's place from smelling burning \"weeds\" in the parking lot when I was a snot nosed teenager attending Sexton High School, to being a patron of the bar years later. The business has dwindled a little since the closing of the \"Green Monster\" but the service sure hasn't. Ah, the stories you'll get to hear if you would just buy a regular a drink!! And the drinks are cheap too!! I had to stop drinking or I would still be a patron to this day. Get there in the mid afternoon for lunch and if the day time cook is still there, you'll be hard pressed to find a better dine for your dime. P.S. if you think that this is just a shop bar, well you're half rignt, it used to be, now it's pretty much a neighborhood bar so don't be afraid to poke your head in and check out the action! I give Harry's Place a 5 star rating and wish I could join you. Doug signing out."]], "Tabooli": [["Beau M.", "The food I'd damn good the prices are damn high. Two weeks ago I went here and my bowl was overflowing. Today it's almost empty. 14.00 for a bowl a side and a drink is not a good deal but it tastes nice. If ur trying to be cheap quit bitching and go to a buffet. If your trying to get good food at a fair price then this is your place. Cheap isn't good and good isn't cheap."], ["Chelsea S.", "I lunched at Tabooli while I was back in Michigan for the winter holidays. \u00a0I grew up in MIchigan and think I know good Middleeastern food and now live in Seattle where there is a definite lack of the cuisine. \u00a0Tabooli satisfies the cravings for Middleeastern but I would not frequent here if I lived in the area as there are definitely better Middeeastern restaurants for very similar prices.Pros are that it is fast, cheap, customizable and has food that is probably better suited for those not accustomed to the flavors of the Middle East."], ["Mary K.", "Eat here! Go now! Came here with our family because my husband has been here a few times and loved it. Both the beef and chicken schwarma are great. Beef stew is delicious. Our favorite is the ratatouille! Super friendly staff who offered us free samples of everything and even gave our kids a free dessert. We'll be back for sure!"], ["Jennifer K.", "We stopped by for dinner on the way to Sparrow hospital to visit my grandmother. My daughter was meeting us so we had about 20 minutes to kill. We ordered hummus and bread and drinks while we waited. The owner came to our table and chatted with us almost the whole time. He was very friendly and enthusiastic and brought us two different free samples to try - lentil soup and ratatouille - both were delicious. I tried something new for me - the Mediterranean burger and it was great and very flavorful. My husband and daughter both had bowls. They did both think that the chicken shwarma and tabouli were a little dry. However, the flavors were great and our overall experience was wonderful. We will definitely stop there again."], ["Hash P.", "The quality and the quantity of food has gone down significantly since they've opened last year.I got just a container of hummus today and the attendant gave me just 1 half roll of pita bread...I asked for more..and she gave me 1 more...thanks...The bowls used to be loaded up but now they put just a small scoop of the rice and chicken and you are limited to just 5 toppings. Of which, they are very stingy on.The food isn't terrible by any means but it also isn't a must have anymore..the poor service makes you go to some of the comparable alternatives."], ["James F.", "So, so food. Incompetent staff. Overpriced and not nearly as good as the soup spoon cafe across the street. Would not recommend to a friend nor will I return here again."], ["Cristy C.", "This is a new casual dining Mediterranean restaurant on the east side of Lansing. It has the set up of a Chipotle, with the choice between a wrap or a bowl. I chose the chicken shawarma bowl as my main course. The first person behind the counter scoops in the rice, the shawarma, and \u00a0(if you want) a little bit of potatoes. Then, the next person behind the counter adds toppings to your bowl or wrap. The choices for toppings include feta, onions, olives, pickles, turnips, hummus, tabouli, fattoush, other things that I couldn't identify, plus the amazing Mediterranean salsa. Everything was really great- everyone in my group was pleased. The owner seems to take an active and welcoming approach to running a restaurant, I hope they are around for a long time!A main dish plus a side gets you a free drink as part of the trio promotion. Most of these combos seemed to be right under $10. Dessert options are ladyfingers (rolled phyllo dough with nuts) 1 for .75 or 2 for $1 or some sort of pudding. The lady fingers were good. An interesting and tasty twist on traditional Mediterranean food. \u00a0(4 stars)I had leftover Mediterranean salsa and the owner gave me more chips on the house to eat with my leftovers. And their tip jar says \"for TARDIS repairs. (+ 1 extra star)."], ["McSaddle X.", "The staff here is great, tip them. The food is--let's agree that it is Mediterranean Fast Food and you get what you pay for. This is at least a departure and a healthier option than what you might otherwise consider. It is set-up like Subway, Chipotle, and Tamaki-- you begin with a base meal and add on whatever you want. It feels as though the flavors are slightly toned down to appeal to a broader spectrum of palates, but everything is fresh and the portions are generous. Go here. Try it. Go back, try something else. It's worth more than one visit."], ["Casey B.", "This is a new restaurant to the Lansing area. I decided to give it a try, I love Mediterranean food. I like that it is set up a \"chipotle style.\" You can choose a wrap or a bowl. today I decide to get a bowl, you can pick anywhere from chicken or beef shawarma,chicken kebabs, stew and so on. \u00a0Today I got beef shawarma bowl with tabouli, hummus, Mediterranean salsa and fattoush salad. The beef shawarma was pretty good no complaints. They have really good hummus and pita bread. The fattoush salad was delicious. It's probably my favorite, never had it like that before. This was my first time having mediterranean salsa it was absolutely delicious, I picked the olives out. I love tabouli, it's one of my favorite mediterranean dishes. However at this restaurant they add mint. \u00a0Yuck. I was so disappointed. \u00a0I'm not a fan a mint unless it's in my toothpaste, gum, or mojito. The garlic sauce, yuck!!! \u00a0Their recipe isn't didn't work for me. It's wasn't garlicky enough.Overall it's a pretty good restaurant. It is a little smoky in there because of the grills I wish that they would've opened a window or door and the manager was yelling at his employees in front of the customers I didn't think that was very professional."], ["Iman B.", "Its a very good place to go for Meditranian food. it is like subway style that you create your own bowl. you can eat a lot there and the food is awesome.I got their chicken shawarma and hummus which were great. The guy explained the foods very well."], ["Kimberly C.", "Very delicious and fast middle eastern cuisine. \u00a0I had the chicken schwarma rice bowl with potatoes, tabouli, and hummus. \u00a0Was very pleased with all the favors. \u00a0The schwarma was very tender & flavorful. \u00a0The potatoes were a nice edition to the bowl...added good flavor & hardiness. \u00a0We ordered a falafel to try and thought I was very good too. \u00a0They have a drive they too!"], ["Mallory H.", "I think for the price, variety, and convenience this place is great. I usually get the chicken ($6.99) or beef ($7.49) shawarma bowl and get literally everything on it. You have a choice of: onions, turnips, hummus, pickles cucumbers, tabooli, garlic goodness, tahini, baba ganoush, banana peppers, and olives. It also comes with pita and rice. There's drive thru and every staff member has always been friendly. It's rarely crowded when I go at night and the food has been consistently good."], ["Sammi D.", "I had the chicken kabob wrap and a side of potatoes, delicious!! They have lots of choices and you can choose as many toppings no additional charge...everything looks delish."], ["Lilyan T.", "Meh. Just meh. I had a $1 off coupon so I went to Tabooli for lunch. I have to preface, I am Middle Eastern and have tried some of the best middle eastern around. This place is definitely lower quality. I got there at around noon and the chicken kabobs were sold out. I got the chicken shawarma instead and it was dry. The tabooli I got as a topping was also VERY dry and the fattoush was made with iceberg lettuce and no dressing. It was kinda gross. Anways, for the price, $6.35, I really can't complain but this would never be my first choice and I would probably only go with a coupon. Also, when I was going to leave, the worker said, \"I hate when the pita is stale!\" Oh. Joy. Don't even change it, worker, just serve that stale bread all day."], ["J C.", "I don't regret going here, but it wouldn't have bummed me out to have missed it.I checked out Tabooli after seeing the adverts on the highway. The idea is good- it's set up like a Subway where you slide down the line and ask for exactly what you want.The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great.The service was friendly, but slow.This replaced an old KFC so the interior isn't bad but it's just kind of existing.That combined with the price point, I don't think I'll ever go back.I'd much rather make the drive to Sultan's on the East side or Zaytoon's if you are on the west side."], ["Michael M.", "I ordered a shawarma sandwich and a side of fatoush salad through the drive through. The sandwich is filled with rice and some meat which was disappointing, if I wanted rice in my sandwich I would have gone to a borrito restaurant. The fattoush salad was an even bigger dissapointment with no baked or fried bread in the salad and maybe a dash of oil of some sort with no flavor. These two things with a small coke cost a good $11.11 and I'm still hungry. ...good attempt but horrible food"], ["Nichole R.", "I stop into Tabooli's once a week. The owner is hilarious and so are his employees. The food is amazing for the chipotle style restaurant that it is. It's affordable and the serving sizes are very generous. They even cater for events. We are preordering for our post thanksgiving wine and cheese party. Try this place out. You won't be sorry."], ["Becky S.", "Love the Chipotle-style take on Mediterranean food. Extremely friendly staff and good value for the cost. On my first visit, the owner spoke with my sister and I and asked for our honest feedback about the food and the experience, he even gave us complementary desserts! He seemed really earnest to make this place the best it can be, and it was clear from my interactions with all the employees that they are very customer-focused. A great addition to Lansing. I will definitely be returning in the future!"], ["Robble R.", "Delicious! \u00a0I've ordered the beef shawarma bowl as well as the falafel bowl. \u00a0I love the fact that it's set up as a type of \"cafeteria style\" so you can see all the toppings/sides and watch your meal being built before your eyes. \u00a0The set up is similar to Pancheros or Qdobas. \u00a0Still need to try the chicken and desserts too! \u00a0Thumbs up!"], ["R. L.", "Good quality food, clean restaurant, and fast service. This place is a great addition to the Lansing area. You can load up a wrap or bowl with anything...they operate like a Subway. Great options for vegetarians. I only wish they had some spicy sauce options because although the food is good, it lacks savory flavor... not very authentic. I'm a falafel person and for comparison I say they are better than Aladdin's but not as great as Jerusalem Bakery."], ["Beth B.", "I'm a vegetarian, so I find getting \"fast\" food to be a difficulty. A friend brought me to Tabooli and I was hooked. I get a wrap with falafel and add all of the toppings I want for the same price. (Hint: I am addicted to the garlic sauce... do NOT add that if you are here with a date.) The employees are always friendly and helpful. They'll answer any question about the food. If you want more pickles or olives or sauce, just ask. Also, the baklava lady fingers are delicious. Great, ultra filling meal for an excellent price."], ["John K.", "Another great meal at Tabooli Sat night. \u00a0The chicken wrap.. and those little deep fried patties... whatever they are... great and healthy food!!"], ["Raymond G.", "New \"Subway-style\" Mediterranean spot.

I was always wonder where and when this place would open. Huge billboards in Lansing and kept my eye open.Finally found this place and decided to give it a go. The setup is similar to a Subway and there was a full staff ready to take your order. I would say this felt more like a Qdoba then a Mediterranean establishment. Fast food feel was still there and while the choices sounded good, didn't get that fresh feeling. I decided to go with the stew with eggplant and a side tabouli salad. The stew was good and the side options tasted great. Eggplant was a little oily and just fell apart upon lifting it. The salad was a bit dry and could mostly just make out parsley. I'd probably return and try a different dish, but this is OK For their offering, but still would go to Aladdin's or Sultans as first choices."], ["Will K.", "guess how mush they charge for a little barrel of juice??? the one with the foil on top...that you got from the store as a kid for 25 cents....$.2.00!!!!!! blew my mind after i saw my receipt........will never come back ...food OK at best ....but that juice was the deal breaker believ it or not"], ["Parth G.", "Good food. Good ambience. Since it a new place they make really tasty food and do good service.
