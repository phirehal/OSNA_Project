{"Ukai Hibachi Grill and Sushi Bar": [["Josh S.", "Ukai is my favorite place to eat in Lansing. I have eaten sushi here, lunch and dinner, more times than I can count.My favorite rolls are the Champagne and Salmon. The champagne roll is salmon, tuna, and yellowtail tuna, surrounded by rice, then seaweed, which is then tempura-battered and fried. Sauces are drizzled on it. It comes warm, crispy, and delicious.My favorite way to eat sushi here is with chopsticks, put some wasabi on each roll right before I \u00a0dip them in soy sauce for a second or two. The wasabi is nice and strong. Ginger is good, the miso soup is provided when you eat in and is quite good.Overall, my favorite sushi dining experience anywhere."], ["Rebecca B.", "I hate to redo my prior rating, but I have to...I came twice during my last visit. \u00a0Scott, the bartender, was up to his usual level of multitasking which is an amazing skill to witness. \u00a0If you come here alone, sit at the bar.The food was not as good as I recall. \u00a0The miso soup has dried fish paste in it so that's out (thanks for giving me the heads up, Scott!). \u00a0But the sushi was a bit crumbly - like the rice hung out in the cooker too long. \u00a0Maybe it was my mood after 8 hours in a risk management conference but I went twice and it was just a bit of a bummer.The wine is cheap, so i will be back."], ["Todd C.", "Pleasant surprise !!! As I was leaving the hotel the front desk asked me if this is where I was going and I told her yes and she told me I would LOVE it. Quality was good price was good. Very friendly bartender and service staff - busy for a Thursday night. Yellowtail Hamachi was stupendous, crunch roll was really good - ordered up Drunken Tiger to try it out, I'm sure it will rock. Some fruit flies about the bar area, but I understand that, they are a pain, I will bring my customer back here for lunch when we are in the mood for Sushi Hai !!!"], ["Amber B.", "This is so my favorite place. It's like $25ish a person for dinner and totally worth it.The food is amazing and the experience is almost always awesome (depends on the chef) I always get the hibachi steak and it's always on point"], ["Nancy K.", "Solid sushi joint. Very large rolls. I could stand less rice but that's personal preference. Flavor combinations you won't find elsewhere. Good cocktails and good service."], ["Tyra N.", "Ok the food is good. Really good but...Well most of the rolls are tempura and while I know I'm always eating in an American Sushi restaurant no matter where I go this place verges on appropriation with the menu names and frying everything!Many of the speciality rolls are fried tempura and too heavy for me. They taste ok but some of the rolls I would prefer without the batter, grease and heat. Their Bento boxes while again mostly fried (veggies, rolls, noodles) and heavy with sauce are delicious. The menu is insensitive in my opinion. They have items like the Godzirra roll, the Atomic Bomb, Eating Nemo (cute), Crabby Patty (cute), and Kamikaze roll. I feel like this can be taken offensively.I have not had any sake or drinks but the decor is nice and the service is fast and friendly. I'll be back but that menu has me feelin some type of way."], ["Bruce B.", "Great Sushi bar with Tepanyaki grill. Full assortment of fish and rolls. Close to airport and hotels. \u00a0Friendly chef Jay prepares beautiful sashimi. Nice assortment of sake as well."], ["Rishi R.", "Everything, and I mean everything here is incredible. The prices are unrealistically low and quality is phenomenally good. Had their spicy salmon roll today. It was so good I think I cried."], ["Karen X.", "The hibachi here is very good, but I would not recommend the sushi if you are a sushi lover and like authentic sushi. While I don't have too many complaints about the freshness and quality of the fish, it's really more in the craftsmanship. The sushi has a lot of rice and just doesn't seem to use the freshest and best ingredients.I had the rainbow roll and the spicy tuna roll which are pretty standard at sushi restaurants but this just wasn't the best sushi I've ever had. All in all, if you're going to ukai, go for the hibachi and skip the sushi!"], ["Tara S.", "We had tickets to a show, so my family and I stopped here for a bite to eat and a drink before heading over to the Wharton Center. We opted to sit on the patio, as the weather was beautiful. The waitress took our order and we each got a specialty cocktail, plus 4 sushi rolls to split. We advised her that we were in a bit of a hurry, and she offered to bring the check with the meal. Perfect.The drinks were good. Not too alcoholic, could have probably used a bit more of a punch, it tasted like you were drinking a juice. The sushi was amazing. Fresh, tasty, and it all came out on one tray for us to put in the middle of the table and eat from. Then they have small dishes that you can hold in your hands as you grab sushi and dip in your soy sauce (also on the plate). It's sometimes difficult to eat outside on a patio, but their setup made it very efficient and worth it.The waitress forgot to bring the bill with the meal, but it wasn't too long in coming out and when she did eventually remember, we were still eating and not in such a rush to leave still."], ["John C.", "I had the Spicy Crab Crunch roll & it was amazing!I posted a photo from the menu because I didn't waste any time devouring the Spicy Crab Crunch roll."], ["Andy D.", "I have stopped here a few times since it was very close to the hotel I would stay at. \u00a0I never tried the hibachi - only the sushi. \u00a0Average at best. \u00a0However, I found the staff to be always accommodating."], ["Marie S.", "I actually ate their twice yesterday -- once for lunch/takeout and then hibachi for dinner.Lunch: the kids' meal was fantastic, a lot of chicken. \u00a0The bento box I ordered was HUGE, filling two square takeout containers. \u00a0The meat was dry, soy sauce almost sweet, ginger dressing not very ginger-y and tempura veggies were wet/soggy. \u00a0But a lot of food that was very tasty.Dinner: Maybe the second to worst hibachi I've ever had. \u00a0The fried rice had ZERO flavor, the miso soup was separated, the yum yum sauce tasted metallic and bitter. The meat was tasty but the shrimp appetizer was very fishy tasting. \u00a0We didn't get a single drink refill until after the chef had served all of our food.The chefs were entertaining and the meat portion of my dinner was very tender and flavorful.I also witnessed the server for the grill next to us be very rude and argumentative with a patron, to the point where we nearly left."], ["Erica D.", "Yes, my rating is low, but this restaurant isn't all that bad. In fact, the sushi chefs alone are notably talented and fun, and there are definitely unique sushi options. It's also the only hibachi in Lansing, to my knowledge. Our Ukai experience, however, left my husband feeling ill.When we arrived, the place was virtually empty, but there was a wait. The hostess had a weird thing going on where she would not look us in the eye! It came off as arrogant, like she was annoyed to... I don't know... walk us to a table? We were seated at an empty Hibachi table waiting for a chef. We waited for fifteen minutes, by ourselves, without being acknowledged. The corner we were seated at was by a covered window (I believe) and I'm sure it was a combination of the hibachi grill heat and the temperature outside but we were feeling extremely muggy, stifled, and began feeling under the wather. Another couple celebrating their anniversary was seated next to my husband. After a few minutes, he asked if I would mind just eating in the sushi non-hibachi room instead, and before I could decided, he was insisting we not remain in the hibachi room. It ended up being because he was feeling so warm he was lightheaded and also the lady who sat next to him smelled like \"an old person's house\". I suppose that's the risk you take when you dine with strangers. We never saw a hibachi chef and did not feel invited. It was disappointing.The sushi room had appropriate room temperature, thank goodness, and we were greeted promptly. Our waitress was sweet and helpful with my custom questions. I went with the Tyson roll, which has fried chicken among other things inside! I had it tempura fried. The roll was huge, and very good at first - but after a bite or two I realized how overwhelmingly cream cheesy they were. I had to take half the cream cheese out of each circle. My husband ordered two rolls (names forgotton). He didn't really like either - he said the shredded shrimp topping on one mixed with the spicy mayonnaise tasted way too decadent and the other roll was bland. He ended up having an allergic reaction to the crab, which I think actually is good thing - meaning the crab they use is real and fresh. He said he just felt fluish the entire time we were there, and couldn't wait to go. During our visit, I had asked for a fork for some gyoza we ordered. Since they aren't readily available and the only utensils at the tables are chopsticks, I'm fully aware of the expection to know how to use chopsticks at sushi restaurants. But... I'm American. Sorry. I find a fork easier to use, naturally, since I use one every day. I asked for one, and the reaction I got was the equivalent of an \"you uncultured swine\" joke. Rubbed me the wrong way. Left overs were inedible, so half our meal went wasted. Ukai has a reputation for being a nicer, more expensive Lansing area option, but I honestly thought the prices were very affordable, especially their sushi bar happy hour specials that include rolls and appetizers. You can easily get out of there affordably. Hibachi is more expensive, but you get multiple courses with whatever hibachi item you pick.I think for us, we had a weird experience overall and did not feel like we had a \"nice dinner out\". I'd give them another try but my expectations won't be so high."], ["Ronnie W.", "always wanted to go to a Hibachi Grill, now I have. They didn't dissapoint, so I am told. I couldn't believe how much food they actually cook for you, The chef was entertaining and did a great job cooking for us."], ["Nicole H.", "I love this place! I've eaten sushi all over the country and this is good sushi. The staff is friendly and the sushi chefs are speedy. The bar is excellent with many custom cocktails. \u00a0The hibachi grill is a lot of fun and it is kid friendly. The lunch menu is an excellent value. Definitely check this place out."], ["Claire M.", "Hostess and bar tender were miserable people. We were ready to walk out and should have. But it was raining. When the chef came and we were seated everything changed - very friendly - entertaining - and great food!! \u00a0(Please get happy people in front of the house - that is the only reason for four stars)."], ["Shannon H.", "My favorite place to have sushi with friends!!!

I love the soup and salad you get before you dinner is prepared right in fount of you. The cooks are amazing. Very kind and friendly. And make a good show. The food is amazing and you get what you pay for. Great food, show, and excellent service. One of my favorite restaurants!"], ["Stephen K.", "The food was okay and being there alone didn't bother me as everyone at the grill/table was so nice. The food though... \u00a0It was a great price but I like my fried rice to have a little more grill time and the chef seemed very preoccupied. All in all I'd call it an okay experience."], ["Steve A.", "I've been here several times when I'm in Lansing and the sushi is consistently very good. Sit at the sushi bar and visit with the sushi chefs. One of them is from Korea (sorry can't remember his name). Great guy to talk with. I always learn something and also find out if they have anything special that's not on the menu. You'd be surprised how often I get to try something new or that the chef says is especially good. Only down side is the beer and wine selection is weak but I don't go to sushi restaurants to drink. You need to try this place next time you're in west Lansing."], ["Graydon P.", "Came here tonight for my wifes 50th birthday dinner, I had the shogun special and my wife had the seafood platter, both dishes were cooked to perfection by the hibatchi chef. we will be back next time we are in town."], ["Taryn H.", "Good food, but our chef was terrible.. Dropping his utensils and the eggs. The other waiters seemed entertaining but ours made it an unpleasant experience."], ["Erin K.", "Your average hibachi show, we didn't get the shrimp tossed at us which is the only reason the kids wanted to go. The chef was quite dull, seemed bored and made an onion volcano and that's it. The hibachi food was just ok, the sushi was really good. It's completely random if you are going to get a good server in the sushi bar or not. More likely not. The hibachi servers were friendly though."], ["Kristin C.", "I come to Ukai at least once a month to take advantage of their wonderful happy hour (prices slashed on certain drinks, appetizers, and rolls Sun-Thurs, 4-10 pm). \u00a0I've sat at the sushi bar, at the regular bar, and in the general dining area before. \u00a0Note: I haven't tried the hibachi back room, as I can't tear myself away from the delicious rolls.If you are sitting at the sushi bar or the regular bar, you will likely be waited on by the bartender. \u00a0The two main bartenders at Ukai are Scott and Lisa, and they are both wonderful people. \u00a0They both are warm and talkative, act fast, can remember way too many orders at once, and make a mean cocktail. \u00a0Major thumbs up for them.When I'm by myself, I always get the rainbow roll here (it's one of the things on sale at happy hour, at $7). \u00a0These rolls are no joke. \u00a0They're nice and large, and one rainbow roll plus the complimentary miso soup fills me up for dinner. \u00a0The generosity isn't isolated to that one roll, either. \u00a0Everything is large here, and you get lots of tasty food for your buck.If you're at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs might talk to you a bit, and you might even get a little treat. \u00a0I always tip the sushi chefs in their jar because they do a great job. \u00a0Heck, I just tip well anyway, because I get a delicious sushi dinner for under 9 bucks total. \u00a0You can't go wrong with Ukai."], ["Lorraine H.", "Went here for my 50th birthday with five friends. The reservation was made in advance and they had us listed there. The greeting area is small and there are only two chairs, so it gets congested with people waiting to be seated. We waited about 10 minutes. The restaurant was clean and crowded with happy customers. We sat at a grill table and the service provided was friendly. I would say the entire experience was very good, and the food was certainly delicious. Only three little gripes: the restaurant was very chilly, my daughter was freezing. The noodles and rice were cooked first, so they went cold by the time the rest of the food was prepared. Finally, the first two beers I requested were \"out\" or \"discontinued.\" I ended up with my third choice. The chef was nice, not talkative. It was fun, we had a good time."], ["Jamie T.", "Great hibachi grill. Food is delicious and our service has always been good. I love watching them cook in front of you, it's entertaining. We'll definitely go back."], ["Bradley R.", "This place gets 3 stars primarily for the hibachi experience. Decor, staff and quality of food were good, I can't wrap (pardon the pun) my head around the sushi. I am just not a fan of Americanized sushi, which, is the bulk of what Ukai serves. For families with kids I can see the appeal, but if you want authentic sushi I would go to Sansu or similar places in East Lansing."], ["Miss P.", "Excellent chefs, service great (Jackie is the best waitress if ur bringing kids shes SO sweet). It's very pricey though u get what u pay for. Kids meals are a bargain. Great, clean atmosphere.

I've never done the hibachi side of things, but it looks like fun - someday!"], ["Theresa H.", "I had to go out that way and wanted to get dinner while I was there. I have been to a lot of sushi/hibachi places and this was the least tasty. Their ginger dressing was all wrong, it had too much onion or something. Their soup was SALTY. The specialty roll was delicious and perfect. The hibachi was not what I expected, my shrimp were way over cooked and chewy, my scallops were good but the vegetables were pretty much onions and mushrooms with a sprinkling of bean shoots that tasted like dirt. I was expecting broccoli which is my favorite part of hibachi. \u00a0Their dipping sauces were also weak and their soy sauce was also super salty. My waitress was a rock star so at least that was one plus. My meal also came with an after dinner drink or ice cream and I don't drink so I entertained the idea of ice cream and they had ordinary flavors, no green tea or red bean so I declined. I definitely wouldn't go back and would do somewhere else."], ["Carol S.", "Have never had a meal that caused me this much stress. Too much food too quickly. No time to appreciate any one thing. We made the mistake of ordering appetizer. Then all the rest came immediately. No where for all the plates to go. \u00a0No one to pick them up.

And they had a wide variety of rolls. \u00a0Only thing I didn't like about the roll options is that so many of them were lacking in raw fish. \u00a0Lots of tempura and avocado and sauces, but very little raw fish involved in the rolls.Service was pretty quick and efficient despite the fact that it seemed that our waitress was the only one for a pretty full dining room AND she was also tending bar. \u00a0She was pretty impressive. \u00a0And cost of everything was reasonable. \u00a02 people had a couple beers, edamame and way too many rolls along with some sushi for $70. \u00a0We left at least one full roll on the plate, so could have gotten away with $60.If you are looking for someplace at this exit of the highway that is not a chain, think this is one of your only real options and it works well!"], ["Angela E.", "Ukai is one of my favorite places to go! \u00a0The hibachi is amazing! \u00a0The filet and shrimp are the best. \u00a0Huge portions at the hibachi table. \u00a0Very entertaining! \u00a0We usually just belly up at the bar though for sushi and drinks! \u00a0Scott is a great bartender! \u00a0He sometimes has some interesting concoctions he made that he'll let you try (his cucumber cosmo is great!). \u00a0All the sushi is very good, haven't had anything that was disappointing. \u00a0You can tell it is a well-run business!"], ["Fred K.", "Very nice sushi bar and grill. \u00a0There are two dining areas where one the entrance side you have standard tables with a counter and stools section to watch as the sushi's made. \u00a0On the other side there's hibachi and talented chefs preparing your selection right in front of you.Very entertaining."], ["Stacy L.", "Always a pleasure to come here. \u00a0Always love to get the chicken and scallops. \u00a0It is always more fun the more people you have at the table. \u00a0A favorite for birthdays and anniversary dinners."], ["Lindsey K.", "This is my 3rd time visiting Ukai. I have been to this location once before and the Okemos location once. This location is newer and has a more open, brighter atmosphere. We sat in the Hibachi Grill area, not the Sushi Bar. The hibachi chef is always entertaining, lighting things on fire and flipping eggshells into his hat. The highlight was when he asked if anyone wanted to catch a shrimp in their mouth. Of course my friend volunteered. Although it was a large target, I'm still impressed the chef flipped the shrimp into his mouth. I had the hibachi chicken dinner which comes with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, rice and the chicken. My friend had the Asahi special which was lobster tail, steak and he added shrimp. I felt the amount of food and quality was a very good value for the cost. The waitress was fun and attentive and made some nice recommendations for wine. I will definitely go back. It is a fun place to go as a group, but also fun to go with just 2 people and interact with others at the table you share."], ["Gerrie M.", "This was my second visit here. \u00a0First time was with a group for a birthday celebration. \u00a0We all enjoyed it very much. \u00a0Very entertaining way to have a very nice dinner!Second visit was just last week. \u00a0We stopped in for sushi (which is not my husband's favorite thing). \u00a0The atmosphere was just so-so. \u00a0A combination sports bar/sushi bar filled with a mixed age group. \u00a0We could do without the TV's. \u00a0The sushi was good, but the size of the roll was a little hard to manage with the chop sticks. \u00a0More man sized. Made me feel like I was stuffing my mouth! \u00a0Staff did not offer any explanation of the sushi choices or offer any recommendations. \u00a0Picture menu was helpful and the descriptions were good, so we made some choices and hoped for the best. \u00a0It was nice that they offered the one with the chicken (yes, chicken). \u00a0My husband at least found this one acceptable. \u00a0With one server in the sushi bar area, the service was quite slow. \u00a0We were never offered refills on our beverages either. \u00a0Overall, I have had better experiences and better sushi elsewhere."], ["Rachel P.", "My husband and I had dinner here and it was great.

I don't know the history but it's evident the owner loves and lives here. The crowd is like being in a foreign place and I love it. Unlike being in a small town American diner, I'm not stared at as an outsider. First the eclecticism of the decor, pictures of patrons, the owner and his progression/aging, his wife and family, toilet barseats, a punching dummy, a kissing wall!

I have been here about four times now and it has been consistently delicious. I have to admit that many of the times I was a tad tipsy while eating their food, but it's still good when I'm sober. My dining companions and I have had the following dishes:Potato Salad, Bean Sprouts, & Kimichi: It's all free and in the clear mini fridge for you to take. Everything is wonderfully seasoned. I don't like potato salad, but theirs is wonderful. Spicy wings: So yummy! Flavorful sauce and tender wings! Love them!Beef Noodle Soup: Tasted like Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup and was delicious. Beef is so tender, noodles are soft, sliced glutinous rice balls are chewy, and broth is aromatic. I added a bit more soy sauce and spice in my soup, but I tend to like more saltier and spicier broth.Seafood pancake: This is the BEST thing they have here. I LOVE this dish. It comes with a light soy sauce infused with green onion and it's perfect with the seafood pancake. They do not skimp on the seafood here. Be warned: sometimes they don't de-vein the shrimp, but I don't care. It's still good to me. Some might cringe at the price, $12 for this dish, but I think it's well worth it since it is a huge portion with tons of seafood and most importantly, it's freaking delicious! We've also tried the honeydew and taro bubbleteas, and they were decent. Maybe I'll try other different flavors another day.This place is definitely a bit off-beaten and odd, to say the least.

There's a large selection of noodle and dumpling soups to choose from, my personal favorites are the Chinese Beef Noodle and Seafood Noodle soups. For those not in a soup mood, there are Korean potato pancakes, kalbi (not everyday), teriyaki chicken, dumplings, and generic sushi rolls (California roll, Inari sushi, eel roll).

Sorry!I've been a regular to Udon since I was 8 and I still can't get enough. \u00a0I'm a student in Ann Arbor now and every time I come home, I make sure Udon is a spot I hit up with my friends. \u00a0They are open at weird hours (5 pm - 3 am), but that is because the owners work late every night. \u00a0This works perfectly for students who are looking for a late night place to go after a party or just want to hang out late with friends (aka me).As you walk in, you're greeted with an automated machine that says hello in Japanese. \u00a0Don't be scared by the things that are in this restaurant. \u00a0The walls are surrounded by a bunch of flattering (or not so much) pictures of his customers. \u00a0There is even a wall of people kissing! \u00a0The place recently bought new tables that have cabinet spacing. \u00a0Inside each cabinet you'll find games and toys to play around with while you wait for your food, so feel free to go right on in and play!Also worthy of noting is that if you're expecting up-scale dining, this isn't the place. \u00a0This place is for good eats you can't get anywhere else in the area and having fun. The menu is on the ceiling, so look up! \u00a0You get a free side of potato salad, kimchee and beansprouts with every dish, so definitely eat up. \u00a0I believe the unlimited amount of side dishes you get is a main reason why everything is slightly overpriced. My favorites are hotpot, seafood pancake, spicy oxtail, or spicy tofu soup. \u00a0The seafood pancake is a little overpriced, but well worth the money if you're craving. \u00a0It's basically an oversized pajeon. \u00a0The pancake is about a .5 to a full inch thick in length and fills up a whole plate, so it's definitely filling. The hotpot is also huge! \u00a0It easily can be split between two people. \u00a0However, it is not really a \"hotpot.\" \u00a0It is basically a noodle dish that has been cooked in a hotpot format and then served to you on a plate. \u00a0It is served with ramen, rice cakes, imitation crab, \u00a0and fish strips. \u00a0Udon also has a large selection of bubble tea. \u00a0It's not overly good, but it is SO ADDICTING. \u00a0It's made with powder, but for some reason you won't be able to stop drinking it. \u00a0Add in the fact that it's for a measly 3 dollars while bubble island charges nearly 4, and you'll be coming back every week. \u00a0My favorites are regular, chinese green, TARO (by far the best), yogurt, and melon.It's cash only, so be prepared!"], ["Gabriela G.", "Rice porridge was deliciousSticky riceFree potato salad, soy beans in salt water and kimchi for customers ordering food.

I'd rock that for sure. It may be borderline cheesy, but I doubt the owner (who is Asian, by the way) was trying to offend.The interior is fantastic. I was so happy a place in Lansing actually put some thought and design into their restaurant, rather than sticking a bunch of signed posters and Spartan memorabilia every where. The colors of the restaurant are chic, the dark wood gives the place a more upscale feel, and the giant Buddha is worth a picture. I did not utilize the ladies' room, but I hear it is worth a pee.Our waitress was sweet, efficient, and fairly speedy with her service. She did every thing right, and was happy to help when we changed our minds on two things during our stay (a to-go box on one of our meals and yes to dessert after we said no).The menu is expansive and has a few items I have never seen on an Asian fusion menu before. I love duck, and have no idea how to cook it well myself, so my table started out with the duck sliders as an appetizer. These started off the night right. I recommend this choice as your appetizer, and suggest topping them with plum sauce.The entrees come with a small (perfectly sized!) plain salad, which consist of iceburg-like lettuce and was topped with the chef's pinneapple vinaigrette. The dressing was fantastic and unlike anything I've had before, but there were odd pieces of \"salad\" in the mix (like those twiggy, spiky white pieces you find in bagged salad at the grocery store) that I would never present to a customer if I owned a restaurant.For our entrees (and this is where the restaurant fell short), he ordered the General Tso and I ordered the Mandarin chicken. The General Tso was really, really good. Spicy without regret, crispy and tender, and full of flavor. The Mandarin chicken was seriously terrible. There was absolutely no flavor. The \"brown sauce\" might as well have been liquid air. So basically, I ate luke-warm grilled chicken (which went cold way suspiciously quickly), and corn and pea pods. I didn't even want to take it home for seconds (which is my favorite part about eating chinese food). I was so jealous of my man's dinner. The brown rice was delicious, though... I am thankful it was there. I will not be trying the Mandarin chicken again (salt, pepper, soy sauce - none of these could save the dish) and would come back to try the porkloin or salmon entrees that sound promising.For dessert, we had the chocolate banana cake (known by another name which I forget). It was okay, but fell short again. It kind of tasted like a ho-ho with banana cream instead of white sugar cream.I would come back Xiao in a heartbeat, despite my bad entree. I really do appreciate what this place brings to Lansing, the owner obviously put a lot of thought into it, and the sliders and General Tso were amazing. I think the brown sauce just needs to be considered, improved upon, or nixed. I happened to pick the wrong thing on the menu.Check Xiao out (I think you'll like it), support this new business, and don't order the Mandarin chicken.

The chicken was nicely cooked, but the sauce was not remarkable. He also received a side of the same brown rice, which was bland and under cooked.I ordered the Singapore Chow Mei Fun. The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the dish was seasoned well overall (though I did have to add salt to really bring out the taste of the curry to my liking). The shrimp were cooked correctly, but had absolutely no taste to them (as though they were cooked separately without seasoning, and added to the dish later). The chicken was absolutely inedible. It was unseasoned and significantly overcooked. It tasted as though it was cut into bits, pre-cooked, and then re-heated to be added to my dish.I so wanted this place to be awesome. I wanted it to be as good as the advertising made it seem like it would be. I wanted it to be worth the prices we paid.
