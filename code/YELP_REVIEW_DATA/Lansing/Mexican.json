The \"salsa\" was canned stewed tomatoes, rough chopped, with some fresh onions, rough chopped and added in. I think a little dried oregeno was sprinkled in as well. That's truly it. Not good at all. When we finally got our meals, I wished they would have served it to us 15 minutes earlier, it might have tasted better. My husband got something basic like a taco and a tostada. The refried beans were dried out. I ordered a breakfast omelet with green peppers, cheese, and bacon. What I got was an omelet that was completely brown on the outside from overcooking, with cheese and green peppers - no bacon. In all fairness, we opted to sit down and order based on the quality of the mexican buffet we saw. It looked like it was absolutely better than Taco Bell. Apparently they put all their focus on the buffet, adn the rest of the food suffered. I will never go back."], ["Lindsey K.", "Two words: Mexican. Buffet.

Since they have moved to their new location things have improved. The staff are better and the food is delicious. I really appreciate the lady who keeps the buffet clean. The waitresses/waiter are much more attentive and friendly. We are here often and am pleased with the service and food. Update 11/18/12: The bad waitress worked the cash register the evening of 11/17/12. She had been doing better until last night. There were 6 of us in the party. 4 got there first. She greeted them at the door and tried to take them into the room to the left of the door, and they asked to be seated on the other side. She agreed and walked them over there putting them in the back of the room. They wanted a table closer to the front. 5 of the 6 people were getting the buffet so they wanted to be a bit closer. Besides the room was nearly empty. So it was not an inconvenience except the employee didn't like our group challenging her placement of us. She said that they could put the tables together themselves and stormed off. So she left an older couple to push the two tables together because she was angry. That is very unprofessional behavior. The rest of the staff have been pretty good. All I expect is promptness and professionalism, and the one lady lacks both. I don't want to dread seeing her. Finally, the men's restroom smells terrible. The food is typically pretty good except sometimes it is old on the buffet. This could be a great restaurant with professional staff and clean bathrooms. I have to give service a rating of poor-fair since we seem to get the bad waitress more often than not.Update 10/9/12: We went back again, and this time we got the not-good waitress. We were worried, but she seemed to be on the ball this time. Food came promptly. Yea! I hope we got our good Aldacos back. If someone who works there reads this, please change your sign on your door that says, \"Smile. Your on camera.\" It is you're not your. Thanks.Update 10/5/12: I went back last week hesitantly and only because my dining companion wanted it. The food and service were much better. The food tasted good. The mild salsa had some spice to it. So that did change. I got a bite of it that sent me into a coughing fit. We also got one of the long-time waitresses, and she is much better at her job. I think her name is Jessica. The slow, rude one from last time was there, but thankfully we didn't get her. So I felt it fair to update the review. I guess it depends on the day you go and the waitress you get that can determine the quality of your dining experience. I'm sure we'll go back, and hope for the best.6/28/12I used to love this place. I would go to it at least once a week. My dining partner and I would get the buffet, taco special, and the chips/salsa. We loved it. Until we went at an odd time and had to ask the price of the buffet. They quoted us a price but when the check came, it was more. We asked them about it, and they said they told us wrong and refused to stand by their quoted price. Well they lost regular customers for several years. On 6/22/12 we decided to try it again. It was terrible. The food wasn't good anymore. I don't know what they did to the ground beef but it tasted terrible. I don't know if they dropped the grade/quality or are using \"beef\", but I couldn't eat all of my tacos because it tasted bad. The buffet quality was poor as well. The food seemed to be leftover and old, which didn't help the ground \"beef\" taste. The pico de gallo was old and slimy. None of the food was fresh. Food quality has gone down. The service has also gone way down. We got a waitress that ignored us most of the time. My tacos sat on the counter for awhile with our waitress walking by it multiple times, eating her own food, and chatting with coworkers in the other room before she finally brought it to me. I would have appreciated my food since I was hungry and like it hot. She dropped off the check while we were eating and didn't come back. Before she left she brought some more salsa but no chips. I guess I was supposed to slurp it up with the straw because she didn't refill our drinks and we needed something to drink. When I looked at the check it had an item on there that we didn't order. I had to eventually ask another waitress to send our waitress over. When I told her the problem, she went off in a huff to fix it acting like I had inconvenienced her. I'll never go back. The food and service are terrible. I don't understand why people still eat there."], ["Lisa W.", "I think most people who have commented on this place must not have had good authentic mexican food!

She finally did bring the food, but no silverware or napkins. We had to get up to get both. She was very nice, but after I complained she said they were understaffed. If I ever do go back it will be for takeout only and it will only be for the cheese dip or the salad. I'll never order the old sock cum burrito again."], ["Erin L.", "This might be the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. I'm pretty sure someone just barfed on my plate and served it to me. The \"queso\" was separated and gritty....like barf chunks would be."], ["Adam K.", "I was not very impressed with my meal, but the chips and salsa are very good"], ["M N.", "Love, love, love El Az. \u00a0Best bean and cheese burritos, salsa, and cheese dip anywhere. \u00a0All the negative reviewers need to remember this is a restaurant in a college town, not a Michelin rated restaurant. \u00a0Just have a Margarita and enjoy!"], ["K D.", "People, if your critique of this restaurant is that it isn't authentic enough because your fricking strawberry margarita didn't have enough tequila in it ... you need some help. There's a lot to love at El Az. The topopo salad, the cheese dip, the salsa, the bean burrito. All delicious, all great deal for the money.Seems like hating on El Az is some sort of ridiculous new cool kidz thing for undergrads. [eyeroll]"], ["Damon L.", "It pains me to say the El Azteco may just be an average / below average Mexican eatery as a whole - because they have one of the most unique and tasty dishes in the Topopo salad. I definitely recommend the Topopo - with a base layer of chips, beans, cheese, and the like - then piled high with a lettuce, pea, chicken, scallions, tomato and cheese combination. I recall a hint of something along the lines of a vinegar (very light) to add element to the taste. It is something you can attempt to recreate at home with practice - but it just isn't quite the same as getting it at El Az. This is one of the sole reasons I would still frequent the restaurant - or even recommend the place. I realize why the rest of the experience and menu is not absolutely embraced.The E.L. location has a nice roof bar and seating area that is great for drinks and food in the summertime. Their Saginaw St. location is much more of a dive / lacking standards. But - I would say both locations have never been exactly of high paradigm in environment, appeal, or overall spotlessness. I know I'm breaking rank on what I usually stand for in admitting that - but every once in a while a restaurant will get 1 thing right (the Topopo) that you have a hard time voiding yourself completely or forgetting the place.Over time I have had other dishes: combo's, tacos, etc. - they were neither thrilling - nor was I purging afterwards. More par for the course edible.The service has usually always been below average or bad. Simply because you get college kids running around with their heads off - trying to keep up - a bit haphazardly at times.I think the environment and lack of standards at times is what certainly puts people over the edge on El Az - which is sad because this place might be more if they simply tried a little."], ["Jen T.", "So bad! We waited an over 2 hours for a quesadilla and flauta. It never came! If we waited any longer we were sure it wouldn't taste good! Had to leave and won't be back."], ["Dave V.", "nice little joint. nothing amazing, but pretty good. Not authentic mexican but, again, pretty good. Prices weren't horrible. nice enough staff too. worth checking it out."], ["Douglas M.", "35 years an East Lansing staple. New owners have made some changes. I won't be back. The guac is no longer real. As in some sort of neon green mix. The toppopo which is so vaunted is no longer the same recipe. Different cheese, no dressing and the half order in the round plate is now the full order. No longer feeds 4 people. And it has that awful guac stuff on it. Significant price increases and the chips and salsa are no longer free. NOTHING was good. The food, the service, the cocktails. It took less than two years for them to destroy a place that thrived and was beloved for all those years. The one in downtown Lansing is under different ownership and the difference is night and day. Shame on these people for ruining this East Lansing tradition."], ["Professor C.", "Your typical heavy Mexican food made for American tastes (bland, large portions). Refried beans & rice with most everything, and most food covered with melted cheese. It's a local institution, maybe because there isn't much competition in E. Lansing. The rooftop patio is a pleasant place to have a beer & the food is not terrible. Service can be slow on busy days."], ["Chuck H.", "It got one star because I couldn't give NONE!Matt always loved El Azteco but his brother Chad who was with us tonight, not a fan of Mexican food but he was a good sport and stayed. We should have listened to Chad!I had the Nacho. The \"beef\" was a yellowish color, the jalapenos had no heat or flavor, I asked for onions with mine which also must have been prepped and sat because they too had lost all their heat and flavor.Matt's fajita no longer came with the peanut sauce it always came with and apparently, all the flavor in that dish was in that sauce. It's also the only fajita dish we've ever seen that didn't come with a side of peppers, guacamole, onions, a sizzling plate and some salsa.Lynn and Chad also felt their food was bland and flavorless.We spoke to the manager after the meal, not looking for a handout but after having drove from Detroit to Lansing, we felt she should know how our experience was. She wasn't really interested. Turns out that at El Azteco, salt and pepper with a little cumin is all they feel Mexican food requires as seasoning to be \"Mexican\". She flat out denied the food wasn't prepared fresh to order but Lynn peeked into the kitchen as we were leaving, (they have a wall cutout near the bathrooms that looks into the kitchen) and saw large quantities of foods wrapped in tortillas in plastic bins for the fridge. She also told us nothing was frozen but the sour cream that was brought to the table had ice in it and Lynn's flour tortilla shells were obviously at one time frozen.We will never again go to El Azteco to eat, not even if we are already in Lansing let alone making the longer than an hour drive from the Detroit area."], ["Erica D.", "Yeah, it's not good.The chicken tastes like tuna. The red sauce is not red sauce (it's more like salsa than enchilada sauce). That cheese dip that every one raves about looks and tastes like expired cottage cheese. The chips are hard as hell and super greasy. The location by the hospital in Lansing is even worse, because it's sticky and dirty.The second star I gave is solely because they have roof top dining in the summer! DAMN YOU ROOF TOP DINING IN THE SUMMER!"], ["Mandy T.", "Not really impressed... Guacamole was bland (pretty sure it was just avocado with lime juice), chips were thick and hard, I had the topopo salad since everyone said it was good and it was just nachos with a mountain of shredded lettuce. The cheese dip was just cottage cheese mixed with cream cheese... Not sure if anyone goes to El-az to eat. Think it's just the rooftop. The margaritas were pretty good... And you can get them by the pitcher!"], ["Kyle P.", "Even though I don't like the place too much, I always find myself coming back. The food is, meh, OK. It's better than Taco-Smell but not the best I've had. \u00a0It's priced quite high for my liking (I'm a college student, don't forget), but you at least get a healthy quantity. \u00a0So healthy that it is probably the most unhealthy thing for you. Before you jump to get the pitcher of Margaritas, think hard. \u00a0My friend I split one and had to choke it down, unfortunately not because too much of our friend Jose. \u00a0They were weak and just not good. \u00a0 I am a fan of their house tortilla chips. So the roof is a great place to sit in the sun and enjoy a few brews during the summer time (they can't mess up beer, right?)"], ["J T.", "I've had meals at El Azteco many times over the years...no, make that decades. Maybe my nostalgia glasses have caused me to remember more fondly the experience. Perhaps same glasses cause my expectations to be too high.On this trip, the glasses were off and even rooftop dining in the soft light of a beautiful summer evening was not enough to overcome the complete banality of the food served. Burritos, rice and re-fried beans were below average. Service was ok. The Dos Equis with lime wedge were nice. All in all, there are a lot of better choices for food in East Lansing. However there are probably not lot of better choices for outdoor dining. Drink - go to the rooftop at El Az. Eat - go elsewhere."], ["Ava R.", "EW! yuck gross. i can't believe i used to love this place. i guess that was before i ever had real Mexican food. \u00a0just came here last week with a bunch of friends and everyone agreed that this place is beyond disgusting. i ordered the same thing i always did, the cheese enchiladas in green sauce. the description forgets to mention that it's covered in cream of mushroom soup. in fact, many of their nasty meals are. so gross!. the worst Margarita I've ever had!!! the salsa was so thick like tomato paste and my bf's mole enchiladas were like old 7 eleven toquitos re-deep fried and served. they were gritty and terrible."], ["Bess D.", "Wanted to get a big group together for a dinner before a childhood friend's wedding (it's one of her fave local spots) and while they do not take advance reservations, \u00a0I have to rave about how well Zack, Dani and the rest of the team on the roof accommodated our party of about 50."], ["Vic D.", "A pitiful shadow of what it once was. Food quality has really gone downhill. Service, while never a strong point, has gotten even worse the past couple of years. Chips are usually stale. Salsa is still great, but that's the only thing I can recommend anymore."], ["Surranjan K.", "One of the worst mexican food and service. Zero star is not possible so they get one. Ordered Burrito plate that is supposed to have chili verde and Colorado burrito, what I got was two extremely salted ground beef burrito with cheese. When I asked the waiter to get it right he came back \"manager says this how we make it and it has sauce in it. \" granted that coming from CA I had higher expectation for Mexican food but this place has an inedible food with crappy service. I don't know how anyone could go there twice."], ["Mandy S.", "If I could put zero stars, I would. This place apparently has a new owner who isn't Mexican, but instead is Greek. The selection is not what it was before (I haven't been here in 3+ years). I ordered a strawberry frozen margarita which came in a cocktail glass and I swear it had zero alcohol in it. No taste at all. The waitress said it had Cuervo, yea right. They don't have hot sauce available on the table or by request. They don't allow you to order chicken nachos (apparently the chicken is not nacho worthy). I ordered a side of Guacamole and it cost $3.00!!! Overall the price of the meal was cheap but it wasn't anything to brag about. I wish the old owner would come back. The Azteca we all know and love will not last long under this new ownership - which sucks because I loved it when I was a student at MSU."], ["Adam M.", "While you wouldn't catch me dead eating here over the winter, I'm giving this place 3 stars because it's the coolest place to be during summer nights in EL. \u00a0The roof is straightup the bomb, and the place to get bombed.The food is probably closer to 2 stars. \u00a0East Lansing is known for having bad food, and worse cops. \u00a0SO watch out after you have all those drinks on the roof. \u00a0You just may wind up with the runs in jail."]], "Maria's Cuisine Mexican Food": [], "Famous Taco": [], "La Senorita Mexican Restaurant": []}
