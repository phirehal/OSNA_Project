This is quite possibly the best Chinese food in Little Rock (Fulin is it's only competition), but there is much better Chinese in larger cities. However, when four people can eat their fill for dinner, all the the food is on a continuum from decent to excellent, and the bill comes to $29, I think you have to go 5 stars.The Tofu and Mixed Vegetables stands out, as does the Kung Pao Chicken (unlike any Kung Pao I've ever had in either China and the U.S., but delicious nonetheless). The Lo Mein is a solid choice, and the beef here is not rubbery (or only slightly), as it so often is in American Chinese restaurants.As I understand it, this place is recently under new ownership, and it has made a turn for the better. If you like Chinese food, give China Garden a try."]], "New Funree Chinese Restaurant": [], "Mr. Cheng's": [], "Mike's Cafe": [], "Chi's Asian Caf\u00e9": [], "Pei Wei": [], "Fu Lin Chinese Restaurant": [], "Tokyo House": [], "Three Fold Noodles and Dumpling Co": [], "A.W.

The service is good, the decor is lovely but paying $13 for an entree I could get at my corner chinese food spot for $4 is a little ridiculous. I'm a huge asian food fan but I prefer Thai or Vietnamese cuisine to Chinese really, and if i do need a general tso's fix its going to be take-out. I would reccomend Saigon on Cantrell if you're looking for some authentic asian food, they serve Thai, Vietnamese, & Chinese food. If you're really just a big fan of a nice sit down, chain restaurant Chinese food then PF Changs is your spot!I still give it 3 stars because I've never had a bad time there, I've just never had a great time either. Just so-so."], ["Clem H.", "Nastiest, most expensive food ever. \u00a0Don't even care if YELP moves this to their \"restricted\" views. \u00a0The only thing worth the money was the sesame chicken.

Great wine list..other than that nothing much!!Try the dumplings and the chilean seabass. Small portioned, expensive and overmarinated( too salty) Never try the Chengdu lamb if u don't like five spice. U will be so dissapointed.Best item on the menu All Dumplings, lettuce wrap. Bad items too many too list!!!Great service, well trained waitstaff. Will come back with friends!!"], ["Mark H.", "About six months ago several friends and I were eating here and one of the specials was \u00a0a \"Fresh Seared Ahai Tuna\" entree and when I asked if I could just have it as sashimi instead of seared, the waiter replied. \"It's seared. That's the special.\" I replied. \"Could you please not sear it and bring it out sliced thin with wasabi?\" He replied, \"Sir, it's seared.\" At that point he knew where I was going and I knew that it was a pre seared entree that was going to be heated. Being in the resturant business, there are some things that need to come par boiled, cooked etc but how hard is it to take fresh tuna and sear it for one minute on each side? At that point, I ordered something else off the menu. I didn't say anything I just ate my dinner, which was very tasty, but I refuse to validate the efforts of those who practice this type of \u00a0food service by giving them a perfect rating. \u00a0Even if they were to sear them ahead of time, they still should have some unseared in stock. I am all for prep work but to buy prepped Ahai Tuna or to prep seared Ahai Tuna ahead of time when it takes no time, is not my vision of a culinary experience. So if you want to know if your Ahai Tuna is fresh, then ask if they can serve it as sashimi. If so then, you decide if you want it seared or not. If they would have had uncooked sushi grade tuna, then this place would have been given 5 stars. I vowed to never go back, but I must admit, I have been once since then. It was wonderfulThe decor is very inviting and the wait staff is incredible. It boggles my mind that someone would invest that much time and money into an establishment and not have that option when it is claiming to be a \"Fresh Seared Ahi Tuna.\" entree. The bar has awesome Martinis..

We were more than impressed. Great pricing for huge portions. I would agree with other reviewers that the egg rolls and fried rice had a different taste. It was sort of nutmeg like. Overall I would say we look forward to returning. My husband had the sesame chicken which is not on the menu but man was it good! I had sweet and sour pork. My only suggestion since you ask for the sauce on the side. I don't know if they will do it but it would have made my experience just a little better since it is take out only."], ["Chris T.", "Website pics looked NOTHING like peppered steak I received. Rice tasted funky and so did the soup. It was like a hospital's version of Chinese food. Tossed the food in the dumpster on way to get a frosty from Wendy's for dinner.

Great main entrees!!! Egg rolls were good. The only thing I didn't care for was the Crab Rangoon-it was just a little different from what I typically am accustomed to (it did not have the hint of sweet that I enjoy in mine) some people may like it. Overall excellent idea if you just want to take home a quick meal! \u00a0 Fair warning...There is NO seating! \u00a0This is strictly a TAKE OUT joint!"]]}
