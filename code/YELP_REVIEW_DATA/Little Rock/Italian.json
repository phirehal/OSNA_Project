I don't care to know about back of the house issues while I'm waiting for my food. The value is inflated there. I paid $17 for a non-meat entree that didn't include a side salad. I didn't notice that detail on the menu so when the server prompted me for the salad I responded \"yes,\" not realizing it was a $4 upcharge.The manicotti was reported to be stuffed with a paragraph-length list of vegetables, but the result was less impressive. Nothing stood out but the steaming marinara.I won't return there, though I used to love the old Bruno's. I think it's outlasted its relevance."], ["Cristie T.", "Absolutely the best Italian food in Little Rock. Everything on the menu is delicious.

The Bruno family is always on site, milling around with guests, and making sure their meals are just right. It's fun to see a family establishment that is obviously so cared for by the family. Besides that, the atmosphere is quaint and cozy, and just what you would expect from a little Italian spot. We always sit in the same booth (at first by chance but now by request) that is right in front of the glass window into the kitchen. You can watch the pizza maker throw dough, and it's pretty entertaining. They carry great selection of wine, and we always get a glass with out meal. The BREAD... oh my gosh. Its u real. Absolutely incredible. The meatballs are delicious! Try them for the app. My husband always gets pizza, and I have tried the manicotti, fettuccine, spaghetti, ravioli and lasagna. ALL are amazing. You just can't go wrong!! Try this place out. You won't be disappointed!"], ["Lauren T.", "I loved this place. The food was excellent. The atmosphere just as good or even better.

So I used to be a skeptic and only ate at Brunos one time right before the closure. I wasn't particularly impressed. It seemed tired. Lots of loyal fans but only so-so to me. Then the new opening downtown. Maybe I was there on a bad night way back when but after 4 or 5 visits to the new location I am a believer. Sure it's a red sauce joint but there are some real flavors to enjoy. The house salad dressing is zippy and fresh. The marinara is hearty. The pasta Sol Alman is a savory garlicky indulgence. The peperoni pizza is greasy and delicious with lots of oregano and stiff bones. I am glad they have wait times because that is a sign of success! Keep it up Brunos!!"], ["Will P.", "This place was suggested by the Courtyard hotel. I had Italian sausage and the meatballs for an appetizer. Wonderful, you have to get these.

It was some of the best bread I've ever had!I ordered spaghetti with Italian sausage. They make their own sausage. It was a bit spicy and very tasty.

The price we paid for this was sitting at the smallest table I've ever seen directly next to a bunch of other tiny tables crammed in...that part wasn't as nice as I wish it could be. The last time we were at Brunos the bread portion was almost comical, this time we were served an adequate portion of bread, also on the last visit they were out of Marinara sauce and a bunch of other ESSENTIAL items...this time no issues at all. Looks like Gio and the Brunos team has overcame most of the hurdles, and I'm assured those that remain will be also be resolved. \u00a0They're s always going to be growing pains and I think the Brunos team is doing a great job addressing them.

Bruno's gets two stars solely for helping out Main Street and for a good job on interior decor. Someone had the right eye for what an Italian place should look like: the many photos, the mirrors, the tablecloths, the darkness, etc., perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food is quite bad. I was there with a group and the noodles in the pasta dishes were overcooked, the sauces lacked complexity, the cheese on the pizza was poor quality, the chicken tasted like chicken product, not fresh bird, and the cannoli shells were wrong and filling sparse. The service was pretty weak as well. The wine was good. The real kicker: for all the bad food you have to pay an arm and a leg. Better to stick with the Olive Garden, where you know the food will be bad, but at least at a reasonable price. I hope the food situation improves. It would be nice to have more food options downtown.

We were there mid afternoon for a late lunch, only 2 other tables had people seated. Waiter was quick to take out drink order but service slowed WAY down once we ordered our drinks. Aaron, our first waiter took our appetizer order, when it finally arrived we were informed Peter would continue servicing us. I had to ask for butter twice for the bread since crushed pepper was added to our olive oil without asking us first if we wanted pepper. My sisters salad arrived after yet another long wait. Veggies very fresh and well presented. I had asked for minestrone soup but was told they only have clam chowder or tomato basil. We ordered ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and cannelloni filled with ricotta and spinach. Both main dishes were good size portions with lots of flavor.

I was a little disappointed to be in chain restaurant but it was cool because of the occassion. I gave only 2 stars because there was just over 50 people in our dinner party and they assigned only 2 servers to help all of us. The reservation had been made in advance so there was time for the dining room manager to schedule accordingly.What happened with only 2 servers taking care of over 50 people is that they took only our drink orders first. The order and delivery on just drinks was almost 30 minutes. Then they delivered bread and would not take any dinner orders at all until all the bread was delivered to the tables. That was another 25 minutes.Once the food came out some of our party had to send their food back because the order was the wrong food or a steak had not been prepared properly.I like the mushroom ravioli here, it's my favorite item on their menu.Even if I hadn't been fully satisfied with my food I probably \u00a0would not have let that plate go anywhere. I had already waited a really long time for it.The best part of my experience here was the celebration and the bellini.I really think Macaroni Grill did an especially poor job in customer service.

Last night, he was training a waitress named Christine and she was doing a \u00a0great job too. If you eat at the Macaroni Grill and Michael is working, I highly suggest you ask to sit in his section. Now. Onto the food. I always order the Chicken Carmen. It's roasted chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onions and pasta with a cream sauce. It's wonderful! The portion is huge, so either come really hungry or ask for a to-go box. Romano's provides you with a foil oven reheatable container, so that's nice. The bread and fresh crack pepper with olive oil is also a great appetizer and is free with each meal.

They undercooked my wife's chicken but made it right when we brought it to their attention. No lunch specials."], ["Dan K.", "Romano's Macaroni Grill has been a staple of casual, Italian chain-restaurant dining on the west side of Little Rock for years, and to be honest, I've had some great meals here, but lately things haven't been as good as they used to be.With every meal you're served hot, fresh bread to dip in olive oil and spices, and the bread is fantastic, and is probably one of the only saving highlights of the dining experience.The restaurant itself has a casual atmosphere and is well-appointed, although the floor plan does allow for the noise level to get a bit loud when the restaurant is full. I've dined here twice in the past six months and my entrees were disappointing; my wife insisted that we try it again. This time I decided to go back to the basics and try something as simple as spaghetti and meatballs; for an Italian restaurant, it shouldn't get any simpler than that.First up was my wife's salad; it was probably the sorriest salad I've ever seen in a restaurant. The lettuce was completely wilted, and it looked like someone took a bag of lettuce a week past it's expiration date and threw it in a bowl; every piece was brown, soggy, and wilted. There's absolutely no excuse for this, and the amazing thing is that it made it past three people (two in the kitchen and our server) without anyone taking note of it. This tells me that the kitchen staff, and likely the servers, simply don't care about the quality of the food that's being served. My wife sent the salad back and told them she didn't want it.Next up was my entree. The meatballs were dry and overcooked, the sauce was bland and almost tasteless, and the pasta was undercooked. Undercooked pasta? In an Italian restaurant? Where almost every meal contains pasta? This is your staple, if you can't get pasta cooked right, you're doing something awfully wrong. \u00a0Overall I walked away very disappointed with my dining experience, and that's a shame because I've had some really good food here in the past.

I love that they have many dressing offerings from full fat to fat free and that they ask your preferred dressing quantity. I think the price point is completely justified. The salads are quite large and come with a smorgasbord of delicious toppings. Good food costs money folks...and this isn't your typical Pizza Inn salad bar (although I have a soft spot in my heart for those too:). The pizzas are fresh dough, fresh ingredients, and then finished in the wood fired oven. All these things add up to deliciousness, but a few of our pies got unevenly cooked. We were there on a sunny Saturday afternoon so it was packed and the line chefs were backed up, but I wish they would put a timer on their pies or something. We were stuck anxiously observing while one pizza got unintentionally blackened. Thank goodness we didn't have the terrible service that Meghan C. had, but the service could definitely use some refining.

The problem is that if the restaurant is full or filling, you don't know whether there will be a place to sit and enjoy the food when you get it. This is the case with Za Za's. \u00a0Worse, is the pizza. \u00a0It's soggy and limp (see photo). \u00a0I know the owners to be good pizzamakers, certainly capable of high quality Neopolitano knockoffs; they use Caputo Tipo 000 flour, and bake the pizza in an excellent wood fired oven. I've tried to get the cooks to serve pizza that is still hot and crisp on the bottom, but they seem unable to do so. \u00a0They can do better, and even though locals don't have very high standards in this regard, having been served soggy pizza all their lives, the Za Za's product I was served is a fail. \u00a0The obvious solution to this problem is to monitor the floor temps closely, and serve the pizza on a screen instead of a cold plate, where the moisture from the pizza condenses and soaks into the otherwise excellent crust. \u00a0John and Scott take notice, please.I'll go back, but I'll take my own pizza screen, but I won't accept less than the best quality product possible."], ["Sara B.", "Here's the thing: I love a popular hipster place as well as the next girl.

We got a caesar salad and a pizza with prosciutto and heirloom tomatoes. The salad was delicious and HUGE, definitely enough for two people. The pizza is super thin crust and was okay, but they were very light on the toppings. I'm a firm believer that when I take a bite of pizza it should have each topping on every bite. This was far, far from that and some of the toppings (goat cheese) were undetectable.It was also well over priced. Their wine was $8.50 a glass. I'm okay will paying that at a place that is a nice sit down dinner, but not really a place that I order at like Subway. Our pizza and a salad was over $40 with tip. That's too much for this place. We sat outside and the tables for two are so tiny if I had gotten a water it wouldn't have fit along with out pizza and salad. Finally their ordering is weird. You order salad first at one counter, move down and order your pizza then move to another counter to get your wine. It's weird and there's no flow. Also we got there at 6p on a Wednesday and it was busy, but we got a table. By the time we left it was crazy crowded.

The same principle can be applied for the pizza. ZaZa's is more appealing in other aspects. The variety of alcohol is decent. Outdoor seating can become competitive because ZaZa's does sport a nice outdoor seating area. The menu is ascetically pleasing and designed by a professional, not an amateur using comic sans in microsoft word. To my taste buds the gelto here is good, but I wouldn't go far to say that my palette is very refined in gelto; seeing as ZaZa's is the only place to sell it in the area.Overall, ZaZa stays consistent with good quality food and sports a trendy atmosphere mostly filled with soccer moms looking for a healthy meal and the occasional bored teenager or old couple drinking wine.

It seems to stick out...in a good way. Besides the nostalgia I have for the place, I'll concentrate on the food.My wife and I went to Vino's last Friday for something very, very simple. Pepperoni pizza and root beer. Yes, you may find yourself waiting in between the two doors in a line that seems to go fairly slow. Yes, you may wish the waiters and waitresses checked on you more (this never bothered me, because as a teenager, I never knew they existed in the first place). Yes, you may wait a little while for your food. However, when the hot pizza arrives on your table, all is well in the world.I love how they no longer serve your drink in the small paper cups. That was a pain. It's the little things, guys.Our pizza arrived and every bite reminded me why I love this place. This particular pie had a few too many \"dough bubbles\" on it for my liking, but it didn't take away from the taste. Our root beers tasted a little flat compared to previous times, but the homemade brew was still delicious.I've never eaten food from Vino's that I didn't like. Everyone laughs when I order a Turkey Pizza (yes, I said Turkey), but I highly recommend it alongside the Pizza Margherita.If you like a good hole-in-the-wall pizza place that is more on personality and good taste, go gran some pizza at Vino's."], ["Kelly M.", "So delicious! Great pizza in a casual atmosphere. When the food is this good who needs to fuss about \"atmosphere?\"Pizza has a great topping to crust ratio with delicious tomato sauce. Firehouse beer is yummy and worth a pint or two.Vegetarian and the Vino pizzas are delicious. Pizzas are huge! A large easily fed 4 of us. Try the cheese bread. Delicious!"], ["Jake B.", "Don't bother checking in!!! They don't honor the yelp check in two dollars off any pizza. Claims they didn't put it on there I told them they need to get off yelp them. Other than that the food was good the service was good."], ["Jacob W.", "I wasn't that impressed with this place. We ordered their cream ale - it was flat and honestly not so good. We switched to a regional brand and got a much better product. We went there on a Tuesday night around 6pm, so I didn't expect the food to take that long; we waited around 35-40 minutes for one pizza. The waitress didn't check on us very often, which doesn't make a lot of sense when a bunch of dudes are running through pitchers of beer.Biggest complaint though, has to do with the bathroom. If you're forced to sit at a restaurant for over an hour for a simple pizza meal, there ought to be a serviceable bathroom. It was honestly frightful in there. I know this place is going for \"divey,\" but there's no need to skip on sanitation. Ambience and health codes are not mutually exclusive."], ["Julie R.", "Love their pizza and calzones. Calzones are one of the best deal in town. I love the mix of the ricotta and mozzarella in it!"], ["Harold H.", "Best Calzones on this part of the planet. And the microbrewed beer? YUM.

You won't regret it"], ["Sam L.", "I have to say that if you dine-in at Vino's, you are in for some good eating. However, this is the 2nd time that we have ordered our food to go and the food is absolutely crap. The calzones that we got (the last 2 times) maybe had 6 pepperonis in it and the salad had all iceberg instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 that they give you in house. My only guess is that this is a short cut that the staff is taking. What a shame.The Calzones and salads are awesome every time we dine in, just don't do to-go orders."], ["Elroy W.", "While I've never been here except for lunch, I am a fan. \u00a0I usually get the lunch special which is a slice, small salad, and drink. \u00a0I love their pizza slices as they are huge and have ample toppings. \u00a0I also recommend their calzones as I enjoy them as well. I would highly recommend for lunch!"], ["Daniel H.", "This is a quality spot to grab pizza and and bite to eat. It is a slow process the whole way.. but they do warn you that during busy hours it can take 25-40 minutes to get certain items. The process of ordering took time because the people ahead of use were ordering Beer to go and the person running the register was the one taking food orders and also the one to pour the beer. He did acknowledge us during the long wait and that was a plus. The Pizza was above average but nothing amazing and I did not have any of the brewery beers. IOverall the service was good but not a good system and the food was good. 3.5 stars but not \u00a0good enough to round up to 4"], ["Noah R.", "It's hard to find good pizza in Arkansas but this spot hits the mark.

Mediocre beer but the food is quality."], ["Lisa S.", "Fantastic pizza! I also loved the low-key vibe of this place. We got a medium pepperoni and medium Vino's special...both were awesome, but I was definitely partial to the Vino's special because I'm a big olive person! There were 3 of us and we almost finished both pizza's so definitely enough for some hungry people! We also tried one of their Pinnacle Pale Ale which was pretty tasty...we got it in a pitcher which was nice to share amongst the 3 of us. If I lived in Little Rock I would definitely frequent this place often!"], ["Carrie S.", "we used to love this restaurant but lately whenever we go the food is so so and the wait is FOREVER. tonight we called in an order for pick up and were told it would be 35 minutes. When we got there after waiting the 35 minutes we had to wait an ADDITIONAL 30 minutes before we got our food. once we got home our calzones were extremely salty and undercooked. it's too bad this was a favorite spot- hopefully they'll get their act together!"], ["Aaron P.", "They brew their own beer, support local music, and have really good food.

I think Vino's is it since Bosco's is a chain and so it's just a matter of two places. Vino's also has food so it was a good choice for dinner. The four of us ended up sharing two large pizzas, a Margherita and the house special. For beer we went with the Firehouse and their Imperial stout.The pizza was all right, I have never really liked New York style pizza, I find it too thin and Vino's tries to make it in this style. The Margherita pizza though seemed like a White Pizza with tomatoes which was pretty good. My friends who live here say they always order that and I can see why, it was a good choice. The house special, basically the Supreme was all right, a little on the greasier side. I wouldn't get that again.Beerwise, the Firehouse was a light, easy drinking beer that went down pretty well. A pitcher of it went down very quickly. So quickly, in fact that I wanted their dark beer but they weren't able to sell me a pitcher of it because of the higher alcohol content. Since my friend's wife wasn't interested in a second round 3 did just fine. The stout was smooth with a slight malt nose. I wasn't sure that it's touted alcohol content was very high, it didn't taste very strong but was very drinkable.The beer was good, the pizza was on average, average, but I would come back for their brew work."], ["Sarah W.", "Better hipster hangout/bar than a pizza restaurant. The pizza wasn't terrible just a little too \"doughy\" for my taste. However, it's open late and the service was great."], ["Perry Y.", "While the pizza is pretty good and the beer is great, and the hipster atmosphere gives the place authenticity, really, folks, if you can't get a pizza to a table within 40 minutes of ordering, maybe a different line of work is in order. The place was moderately busy with plenty of staff standing around but that was the problem - that's all they were doing - stop adoring each other's tats, piercings and hair and SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS. Maybe we'll go back, but there are plenty of other pizza joints (Iriana's) with better pizza or (Pizza D'Action) with a similar vibe."], ["Patrick F.", "Loved the pizza, we went back twice during our trip. Beer is made in house and is good, not great. The place is always busy.

You order at the counter (have one of their excellent microbrews with your meal... you know you want to!), and they give you your drinks then and bring your food to you later. I usually have the mushroom and pepperoni calzone, but I've had pizza too. The calzones are huge and delicious! They come with more pizza sauce on the side for dipping. One of my friends usually gets a salad, and it also looks very good. Vino's is friendly and easy going and you can linger over your meal. There are many different seating areas, including outside (and outside upstairs). You can sit and talk and drink and fiddle-faddle, all the while sustained by great pizza and calzones. I love it!"], ["William D.", "Guided by Yelp reviews while driving through Arkansas, my girlfriend and I pit-stopped here on our journey across America.

The Lazy Boy stout is perfect with pizza the huge calzones and a too go must growler beer. Like most places in Little Rock the building is old and has a lot of character.

The micro brewery is tops producing complex full bodied beer."], ["Lance S.", "Last October on my trip to Austin from Pennsylvania, Little Rock was the next place on my journey to hang my hat for the night. After the long day's drive from Louisville, I was in the mood to find a microbrewery that served food. Vino's seemed like the place to go.Indeed, it was! Man I really liked this place! It reminded me of how Austin used to be; full of character \u00a0with no pretentiousness, kinda like if Love Joys served food. In fact, Little Rock in general reminded me of Austin past. Places like Vino's are an endangered species in Austin. Well anyhoo, the clientele was a comfortable mix of boomers, gen-xers, and college age kids. In addition to food, mainly pizzas and calzones, they also brew their own beer. I ordered a calzone and a couple of I.P.A.'s.The calzone was great. It had a crispy crust and the inside was piping hot with an italian tomato sauce, onions, peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, and delicious fennel spiced italian sausage that rocked.The I.P.A was spot on! It was nicely hopped with a smooth body and balanced alcohol kick. One of the best I.P.A's I've had for sure.This place hit the spot and was exactly what I needed after a long day on the road. If I lived in Little Rock, Vino's would surely be a regular place for me to hang out."], ["Noah C.", "Vino's has not changed much over the past ten years and is still a really cool and unique place to go for pizza and sandwiches. \u00a0They are a locally owned hole in the wall that offers some of the best pizza and calzones you'll find anywhere in the \"rock\" ~ Little Rock. Their micro brew's are also very good and their prices are very reasonable. When you go, order their muffeletta pizza or a sausage and spinach calzone along with a cold IPA beer. \u00a0You can't go wrong here!If your into some great local heavy bands, this is a great place to go on Sat nights to get your head banging on!"], ["Amelia R.", "A local fav for handcrafted brew & hand tossed pizza. \u00a0In my opinion, just get pizza with your normal topping choices and they won't disappoint.

Good New Belgium selection."], ["Laine M.", "The best pizza in Little Rock, hands down, in my book. They also have great beer and I really love their salads too. If you've never been before, you order up front and seat yourself, and they give you a quirky little postcard to put on your table so the server knows where your pizza goes. Only negative is that they are not super attentive on refilling non alcoholic beveragesAnd as a side note, I generally only go for lunch or dinner on a week night, so I can't comment on the type of weekend evening crowds they may have."], ["Amber L.", "Call me crazy, but I have never been that impressed with Vino's. It's a typical, local hole in the wall. I have normally gone to Vino's for the bands & entertainment. Tried the pizza- nothing exciting.

Not so sure what all the hype is about."], ["Michelle T.", "The pizza is good, but the staff is so rude!! I watched a waiter yell at a woman for trying to put some tables together because they had a large party. \u00a0Previously she asked him if they could get a table for a party of 8. His response, \"Good luck!\". No offer to help her find a table, no offer to help put one together. \u00a0Once my party got seated, we waited for 20 minutes before our drink orders were taken. When the waiter finally came over my friend asked about what beer he would recommend. The waiter didn't want to take the time to respond so he just said, \"there's a menu up front\". We didn't realize you had to go up front to place your pizza order. We waited for an hour thinking someone would come take our order. Once we finally placed an order it took another 40 minutes before we got the pizza. When they brought forks and plates out, they didn't bring enough so we had to share with the person beside us. The staff is that lazy that they won't take the time to count how many people are at the table so they know \u00a0how many plates and forks to bring??

That's not a complaint, it's their style. If you want linen on the table, this isn't the place for you. Low-key, undemanding, and accepting. The venue and the crowd.The walls are adorned with multiple layers of peeling paint as well as various kinds of art for sale from local hopefuls (some of whom have gone on to success at least locally). the menu is mostly (entirely?) pizza, calzones, sandwiches, and salads. all of them are quite tasty. and the dough is made and hand-spun constantly and visibly in the open--and rather tiny--kitchen.While the pizza is certainly good, you can certainly get better pizza in central arkansas. I'm not aware of anyone making a better calzone though.I helped to start the micro-brewery there many years ago before the current system was put into place...I think in 1994/5 (wow, that made me feel old.) and I'm very happy to see it still going strong and making a respectable product.After all of the dozens of visits over the years, I'm sure there will be many dozens more."], ["Harvey Y.", "this is a straight foward, no nonsense, beer and pizza type of place. If you like IPA, try the pinnacle. It is very hoppy...I can't imagine the Imperial, but I'm dying to try it...The pizza:It isn't exceptional, but it is solid. They have (what I call) the 'good' type of sausage. Its the chunkier, thicker clumps with seasoning laying on the top of it. It isn't New York style, it isn't thin crust and it deep-dish. Think papa johns (style wise) and that is the 'type' of pizza Vino's has...just way better. I would definitely recommend the pizza. A medium is big enough for two people."], ["Mike N.", "The beer is great. \u00a0I think the pizza is in the top 2 or 3 pies that you can get in Central Arkansas. \u00a0Their toppings are solid and the crust is perfectly crunchy. \u00a0I have never been for the live music. \u00a0The place is small and crowded sometimes but worth it."], ["Gina M.", "You gotta Love Vino's. It has been a staple for years, and where else can you get the ambience of graffiti like \"Satan Rules\" as you are washing your hands during your lunch break. Although they have a great local music scene, I usually make the lunch hour. They serve up individual, yet giant slices with your toppings of choice. Although not as good as a made to order complete pie ( I assume they have ready made crusts ready to go for the slices), it is always consistently yummy! The crust is thin to my liking and the toppings always taste fresh. Their Italian sausage is especially good! I am in love with their side salad which consists of dark greens, lots of shredded mozzarella, onion, \u00a0green olives, and a delicious creamy Italian house dressing. The calzones are great too! The service is very casual, you order at the counter and they find you by the cruddy post card table topper handed to you. The place is very rock and roll, grimy, and kind of smelly, with the kind of sellable art on display that makes you comment why someone would pay \"for that\". All this adds to the appeal for me, but the best part about Vinos, which is of course a brew pub, is the BREW! The Six Bridges Cr\u00e8me Ale is my all time favorite beer. It is just too good. The other selections are great too, but this particular one just hits the spot for me! Please do not go here and order a regular bottled beer. The location is super easy to get to, right off 1-30.

If it was simply for presentation, service, atmosphere, and menu offerings; this place deserves five stars-- but the food compared to its price would only warrant 2 stars. Thus, I arrive at my rating of 3 stars. A group of us came and sampled the Mahi Mahi (which was definitely the standout of the bunch), the beef tenderloin, and the strip steak. The two steaks were cooked right but lacked flavor. They seemed to season it simply with butter-- it was a very \"greasy\" steak, which seemed odd.

The waiter offered me free dessert for the wait and I choose creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, 2 vanilla and 1 chocolate (it usually comes as a vanilla, chocolate, and sour apple). One vanilla still had granulated sugar on it. The other had scorched sugar and the custard had not set, was runny. Didn't care for the chocolate one.

There was an occasion where my soup was not very good, but the main course and/or appetizers are superb. \u00a0They have a good wine list and offer approximately 20-reds and 20-whites by the glass. \u00a0Their by-the-bottle selections are more extensive, as one would expect of a restaurant of this caliber. the daily specials are worth trying, as the chef explores his creativity. YaYa's has a Sunday Brunch and it has been voted one of Little Rock's best brunches. I tried it once but did not care for it that much. \u00a0Most of the items are very rich for my taste. \u00a0I do not eat dishes with cream or buttery sauces so it wasn't for me. YaYa's is busy most evenings and especially on the weekends, which is a good sign that a restaurant is good. The down side of this is expect to wait for a table. There is a full-service bar with small bar tables. You might be able to get a seat if you don't want to wait for a table. \u00a0On the up side, you can enjoy one of their many good wines. \u00a0I would suggest the Napa Valley or 14 Hands Merlot. \u00a0This is the one I usually order myself. \u00a0I do branch out into other reds, but usually come back to my favorite. Having moved from Southern California, and growing up near New York City, I truly enjoy eating outside. For me, YaYa's patio is a piece of home in an unfamiliar place. The table has very comfortable chairs and there are several couch areas on the patio. \u00a0In the summer, the couch areas are great for ordering a few drinks and appetizers before your table is ready. The patio area also has something that I love as well, live music. \u00a0I have been at there on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights and experienced simple acoustic to jazz to country performances. I would not expect to see Social Distortion on the patio, but the Orange County natives ever decide, I'll be there for sure! Being is a shopping mall, there is not an issue with parking but I have seen \"traffic jams\" in front of the restaurant waiting for one of few up-front spots. My suggestion is don't waste your time and park in back or in front of the stores. Walking a few minutes will not kill you. Overall, YaYa's is a great restaurant but if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, expect to wait. It is busy for a reason. \u00a0If you are the impatient type, try another restaurant that is not so busy. \u00a0Good things are worth waiting for.

We used to have one in Memphis but it shut down, I had always been a fan so I was excited to be going to Little Rock. I loved YaYas as a place to go wih a group of girls but one can do way better when it comes to a date night. We made a reservation so I'm not sure if there's a wait of not on a Saturday night. We were immeadily taken to this giant booth - which I thought was odd given that we had a reservation for two - did they not need the space for a larger party? A busier brought us water but failed to notice that my glass had a dried piece of lettuce on it -yuck. We ordered two apps to share and they were delicious - the gnocci and \u00a0beef carpaccio. We each had a pasta dish we each picked at - I can't tell you the names because they were not worth rembering. We also ordered a souflee to share, it tasted like a very moist brownie with the top burnt. Our bill was $85 before tip. Service was good but nothing stood out as noteworthy. This is not a contributing factor to my review (if it was, the review would be lower), but a note of their staff:The next morning I discovered I had left my credit card, so back we went after calling to make sure they had it. I was told to see the hostess - she was very rude. When I told her I was there for my card she told me how she couldn't leave the hostess stand and would have to wait for someone on staff to come up there - didn't call the manager. She then had a nerve a few mintues later to walk away from the hostess stand to put tablecloths on tables. I realize this may be part of her duties but DO NOT tell me that you cannot help me becuase you are tied to that location and then leave that location. Since I left my credit card there you'd think it would be obvious that I was someone who had just spent money there- apparently its ok for the staff to display a screw you attitude once you've spent your money. The manager was however very nice and seemed busy so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he's not aware of the rude blonde at the front."], ["Jennifer Z.", "I've been here numerous times and there seems to be consistency issues.

(1-start review for a non-communicative caterer, but I never paid a dime to them.)I took my mother here for brunch on Mother's Day and was extremely disappointed. I made the reservation about a month ahead, and did so based on brunch information on their website. The price for brunch listed on their website (Easter Sunday) was something like $17 or $19 per person. Okay, I can roll with that. The day before Mother's Day, I got a call confirming my reservation and the man told me that it would be $28.95 per head for Mother's Day brunch. WTF??!! In Arkansas?? They apparently waited to fill reservations and then determine the price. I called every other freakin' restaurant in Central Arkansas to get a last minute reservation and couldn't get in anywhere. So, we went to Ya Ya's. For $28.95 per head IN ARKANSAS, I expect excellence. In fact, I lived in DC for a while, where it was common place to pay $30 per head for brunch buffet, but the food was outstanding. And that was DC, not Little Rock, Arkansas. The food was pretty damn mediocre, and the service was just okay. The music was way too loud that my mom and I had to yell in order to have a conversation. I was so incredibly disappointed in this place, and I was even embarrassed that I had 'treated' my mom to such a boring and mediocre experience. I have since learned that this place is a chain. So, I'm not really surprised by the food quality in hindsight, but Ya Ya's, you need a reality check. Unless your food and service are impeccable, charging $28.95 for brunch IN LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, is laughable. I will never spend my money at this place again, and neither will anyone in my family (who live in Arkansas).

I thought their wine selection was nice.This past time, my friend and I were shopping at the Promenade, so we decided to stop in here, and, again, I had the gnocchi and a glass of wine. The pours are generous, and the decor is lovely, especially for a girls' luncheon. Our server was professional and personable.

Service was great as well, we were catching up so we stayed longer than most of the other tables who were in and out - and she never grew impatient with us, keeping our drinks full but not imposing. \u00a0My only complaints about this place were related to the buffet set up- it was in the bar area, and not much room between the 2 \"lines\" - one along the bar and one along the area where they set up the hot food stations. \u00a0People were struggling to get their filled plates through the line to get back to their tables, and I for one hate to walk past a bunch of people with food on my plate - kinda weird about strangers eyeing (and breathing on) what I'm about to devour. \u00a0Also, they had a jazz trio which was really nice, but they were positioned awkwardly in the bar area where the buffet is, so the saxophone man was a little too close for comfort to the buffet plates, and the music was a bit loud for those standing in line waiting. \u00a0Food service and atmosphere, great - execution of buffet, off the mark. \u00a0All in all 4 stars and will definitely visit again."], ["Tim O.", "Being a huge fan of Yayas Denver I was very excited to see a Yayas during my visit to little rock.

My wife's salad was the same, except she was given even less meat than I was served. We ate our meals. We left hungry. We felt as if we had been cheated.

Bravo is known for their bread (rightly so, it's delicious) but the servers didn't bring enough to service a table of 15 and didn't bring more until most of the table was already finished with dinner. Ultimately, if you're going to come here with a large group, don't expect to get really good service or even the best quality food. Do look forward to dessert though, it's a good way to end a dinner here."], ["Amber L.", "So, technically today is Bravo's grand opening. However, my family and I had the honor of enjoying a free meal - appetizer, side dishes, entrees, and dessert- during Bravo's trial run/preview night. We were very impressed.First of all, let me just say that the staff was very attentive and friendly. They were a tad nervous at times, but working hard to follow procedure and give great service. Our glasses were never empty, and we had all the bread we could eat.The restaurant is in the Promenade at Chenal shopping center, and is beautiful. A large facility, well modeled and decorated. The outside seating looked comfy and inviting, and has a huge fireplace to crowd around during winter.On to the food- classic Italian with a twist. The rustica insalada salad is awesome- lettuce, bacon, pears, pecans, cranberries, and balsamic vinegarette. So good! My husband had the Italian wedding soup, which he enjoyed. The bread was light, fluffy, and tasty.I had a cheese ravioli dish with alfredo, tomato, and pesto sauces. My Mother-in-Law had lasagna- a giant portion, also with alfredo and tomato sauces. My husband had a pesto tortellini dish with jalape\u00f1os. And my Father-in-Law had a steak dish. All were excellent! And something different than the norm.If I have any negatives, it would be the dessert. Not bad, just alright. We had the option of choosing NY style cheesecake, chocolate chip bread pudding, or a 3 dessert plate- chocolate cake and ice cream, tiramisu, and a berry cake of sorts. No contest for us- we picked the 3. The chocolate cake was great, the others were alright. Yet, once again, I have no real complaints. We had an excellent experience! Be sure to try it out. You won't be disappointed."], ["Kurt H.", "Went here for brunch on Sunday (2/10/2013) and was not very impressed. Pasta was mediocre at best. The service was good, as my waitress was attentive. The interior is typical of a Italian restaurant chain. There are much better chains options available (e.g., Olive Garden). The lunch specials during the week might be worth it but I would avoid BRAVO! for dinner. Ironically, this probably one of the better Italian restaurants in Little Rock. I would not recommend taking a date unless you did not a second date! \u00a0My take on Italian food is slightly biased as I grew up in New Jersey near NYC with a high density of Italian restaurants."], ["Todd B.", "I generally do not like chain restaurants but Bravo! bucks the trend with very flavorful food (and it is consistent.) \u00a0I really enjoy the braised beef ravioli and the lobster bisque.The flatbreads are a bit dry sometimes but the cheesecake dessert makes up for it if you have an appetite left after finishing the large entrees. \u00a0I have been half a dozen times and they have always delivered. \u00a0Unlike other \"Italian\" chains, Bravo! actually does it right."], ["Jimena A.", "the Bravo's here in Little Rock is perfect..I have been to others,but they weren't as good as here..I really enjoyed the happy hour..the food is amazing.."], ["John C.", "BRAVO! Cucina Italiana is a perfect example of an age-old story. A restaurant opens, and driven by the fanfare and attention, the standards remain high. As time goes by, a routine develops and standards begin to fall. I've been to this restaurant multiple times, ranging from shortly after opening to last weekend (8/20/2011). On the most recent visit to BRAVO! (a group of 4) we were seated promptly since we had actually made a reservation for 6:30. Once seated, we were attended to quickly, however, our waiter encountered something he never expected. Apparently the roof air conditioning unit was draining into the ceiling so a ceiling tile right next to our table became saturated and began crumbling and falling to the floor (in the aisle) before we ordered our appetizers. I recognize that this was a fluke, but the reason it causes the restaurant to lose a star is the way the staff responded. Water poured from the ceiling (onto some guests) but very little concern was shown for the guests. We were moved to a different table, but no attempt was made to clean up the mess, nor did the staff warn people walking under the crumbling ceiling panel of the danger.Once at our new table we ordered our drinks and appetizers. The drinks were more than adequate. A glass of Sam Adams and a Margarita got excellent reviews. The ladies each ordered a glass of Moscato d'Asti. They had mixed feelings about it. It was sweet, but one-dimensionally sweet. Also ordered were an amaretto sour and a glass of the Grayson Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon. Both were excellent. We tried two appetizers, the Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli and the Calamari Fritti. The Mozzarella Ravioli was wonderful--full of flavor and perfectly crispy. The sauces enhanced the already great flavor. The Calamari was a little bit of a let down. It was a little bland and relied on the sauces for all of the flavor--not ideal. Two in our party also ordered the Lobster Bisque and gave it rave reviews. Of course, it goes without saying that the complimentary bread and olive oil were delicious.For the entrees, three of us ordered the Petit Filet & Shrimp, and one person ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. The entrees presented us with further evidence of the falling standards. All three steaks were over cooked. Two were ordered medium-rare. Both were cooked between medium and medium-well. A third was ordered medium. It was cooked well-done. There really is no reason to overcook a filet. The filets were also a little under-seasoned. The shrimp, on the other hand, was excellent. The garnish was delicious as well. The Eggplant Parmesan was very well received.For dessert, everyone enjoyed the New York cheesecake. And, of course, everyone loved it.BRAVO! remains a good restaurant, and we will continue to dine there. Hopefully their standards (both in the kitchen and in the dining room) will not continue in a downward trajectory."]], "Salut Bistro at Prospect Place": [], "Ristorante Capeo": [], "Ciao Italian Restaurant": [], "NYPD Pizza": []}
