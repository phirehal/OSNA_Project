My g/f wanted to have her party catered and the manager came over to discuss options. She was so sweet and knowledgeable. It was then when the service picked up. Everyone was super helpful and friendly thereafter. My g/f mentioned that I was a \"food blogger\" and I'm not sure if that contributed to better service... Anywho... We ordered the following: Calamari: It was good, but wasn't crispy enough for me. I like my calamari with crunch! Crispy Shrimp: This is my fav out of all the appys we had. I would have preferred a bit more batter, but I love my shrimp. Ravioli: Too filling. Came with about 4-5 large pieces and filled with cheese. Too rich for me. Spinach Dip: This was OK to me. My least fav. 2 Cabs: My g/f ordered and she loved it. 2 Muscato D'Astis: I ordered 2 and ended up purchasing a bottle at a nearby wine store to take back home with me. 2 Lemon Drops: We finished our happy hours with a nightcap for the road. It was delish! Personally, I'm not real big in eating out at Italian restaurants; however, this place does have potential in this newer shopping center. This is a great date spot or a place to unwind for happy hour. Apparently, this is a happening place as the outdoor patio got a bit busy for dinner on a weeknight.

A couple of people ordered the Mozzarella Manicotti as an appetizer and i found that it wasn't very delicious but according to a couple of people around the table, the Italian Wedding Soup is to die for. For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Shrimp Diavolo and found it to be pretty good. There was a lot of excess sauce which I prefer when it comes to my pasta but others might not. It cost $18 which I believe to be too much for what it but since it's a fancy restaurant I expected as much. For dessert, my friend and I split a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was absolutely delicious and at $3 a piece it wasn't very expensive for either of us.My biggest complaint would definitely be the service. They were slow to wait on us and even though there were 3 serving our table I had to wait about 30 minutes for a glass of water. Bravo is known for their bread (rightly so, it's delicious) but the servers didn't bring enough to service a table of 15 and didn't bring more until most of the table was already finished with dinner. Ultimately, if you're going to come here with a large group, don't expect to get really good service or even the best quality food. Do look forward to dessert though, it's a good way to end a dinner here."], ["Amber L.", "So, technically today is Bravo's grand opening. However, my family and I had the honor of enjoying a free meal - appetizer, side dishes, entrees, and dessert- during Bravo's trial run/preview night. We were very impressed.First of all, let me just say that the staff was very attentive and friendly. They were a tad nervous at times, but working hard to follow procedure and give great service. Our glasses were never empty, and we had all the bread we could eat.The restaurant is in the Promenade at Chenal shopping center, and is beautiful. A large facility, well modeled and decorated. The outside seating looked comfy and inviting, and has a huge fireplace to crowd around during winter.On to the food- classic Italian with a twist. The rustica insalada salad is awesome- lettuce, bacon, pears, pecans, cranberries, and balsamic vinegarette. So good! My husband had the Italian wedding soup, which he enjoyed. The bread was light, fluffy, and tasty.I had a cheese ravioli dish with alfredo, tomato, and pesto sauces. My Mother-in-Law had lasagna- a giant portion, also with alfredo and tomato sauces. My husband had a pesto tortellini dish with jalape\u00f1os. And my Father-in-Law had a steak dish. All were excellent! And something different than the norm.If I have any negatives, it would be the dessert. Not bad, just alright. We had the option of choosing NY style cheesecake, chocolate chip bread pudding, or a 3 dessert plate- chocolate cake and ice cream, tiramisu, and a berry cake of sorts. No contest for us- we picked the 3. The chocolate cake was great, the others were alright. Yet, once again, I have no real complaints. We had an excellent experience! Be sure to try it out. You won't be disappointed."], ["Kurt H.", "Went here for brunch on Sunday (2/10/2013) and was not very impressed. Pasta was mediocre at best. The service was good, as my waitress was attentive. The interior is typical of a Italian restaurant chain. There are much better chains options available (e.g., Olive Garden). The lunch specials during the week might be worth it but I would avoid BRAVO! for dinner. Ironically, this probably one of the better Italian restaurants in Little Rock. I would not recommend taking a date unless you did not a second date! \u00a0My take on Italian food is slightly biased as I grew up in New Jersey near NYC with a high density of Italian restaurants."], ["Todd B.", "I generally do not like chain restaurants but Bravo! bucks the trend with very flavorful food (and it is consistent.) \u00a0I really enjoy the braised beef ravioli and the lobster bisque.The flatbreads are a bit dry sometimes but the cheesecake dessert makes up for it if you have an appetite left after finishing the large entrees. \u00a0I have been half a dozen times and they have always delivered. \u00a0Unlike other \"Italian\" chains, Bravo! actually does it right."], ["Jimena A.", "the Bravo's here in Little Rock is perfect..I have been to others,but they weren't as good as here..I really enjoyed the happy hour..the food is amazing.."], ["John C.", "BRAVO! Cucina Italiana is a perfect example of an age-old story. A restaurant opens, and driven by the fanfare and attention, the standards remain high. As time goes by, a routine develops and standards begin to fall. I've been to this restaurant multiple times, ranging from shortly after opening to last weekend (8/20/2011). On the most recent visit to BRAVO! (a group of 4) we were seated promptly since we had actually made a reservation for 6:30. Once seated, we were attended to quickly, however, our waiter encountered something he never expected. Apparently the roof air conditioning unit was draining into the ceiling so a ceiling tile right next to our table became saturated and began crumbling and falling to the floor (in the aisle) before we ordered our appetizers. I recognize that this was a fluke, but the reason it causes the restaurant to lose a star is the way the staff responded. Water poured from the ceiling (onto some guests) but very little concern was shown for the guests. We were moved to a different table, but no attempt was made to clean up the mess, nor did the staff warn people walking under the crumbling ceiling panel of the danger.Once at our new table we ordered our drinks and appetizers. The drinks were more than adequate. A glass of Sam Adams and a Margarita got excellent reviews. The ladies each ordered a glass of Moscato d'Asti. They had mixed feelings about it. It was sweet, but one-dimensionally sweet. Also ordered were an amaretto sour and a glass of the Grayson Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon. Both were excellent. We tried two appetizers, the Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli and the Calamari Fritti. The Mozzarella Ravioli was wonderful--full of flavor and perfectly crispy. The sauces enhanced the already great flavor. The Calamari was a little bit of a let down. It was a little bland and relied on the sauces for all of the flavor--not ideal. Two in our party also ordered the Lobster Bisque and gave it rave reviews. Of course, it goes without saying that the complimentary bread and olive oil were delicious.For the entrees, three of us ordered the Petit Filet & Shrimp, and one person ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. The entrees presented us with further evidence of the falling standards. All three steaks were over cooked. Two were ordered medium-rare. Both were cooked between medium and medium-well. A third was ordered medium. It was cooked well-done. There really is no reason to overcook a filet. The filets were also a little under-seasoned. The shrimp, on the other hand, was excellent. The garnish was delicious as well. The Eggplant Parmesan was very well received.For dessert, everyone enjoyed the New York cheesecake. And, of course, everyone loved it.BRAVO! remains a good restaurant, and we will continue to dine there. Hopefully their standards (both in the kitchen and in the dining room) will not continue in a downward trajectory."]], "Zoe's Kitchen": [], "Layla's Market": [], "Ali Baba Mediterranean Restaurant & Market": [], "La Terraza Rum & Lounge": [["Danny W.", "WINNER! \u00a0Fantastic new restaurant in the former Arcadia location! \u00a0Venezuelan fusion restaurant that adds a great Columbian-Spanish-French flair to untraditional beef and chicken dishes.

But then all of the sudden I realized I wasn't at a concert and fell back to reality. It's time like these I feel conflicted. I'm excited about the promise but unfortunately I think the restaurant needs to fix a couple things. Here is my top pro and con, since I hate being a negative Nancy and rarely give bad reviews. Con:1) the price points and dishes don't align. I've eaten similar food in higher cost markets at much lower price points. My pabellon (sp?) \u00a0serving size/quality seemed to be more a $10-12 instead of $16. \u00a0Given how cheap most price points are in Little Rock, I doubt I'm the only one noticing. \u00a0Unless I'm missing something... like I ate Kobe beef marinated in gold \u00a0on accident. \u00a0Pro 1) their patio is a strong asset but they are opening in winter. Hopefully they figure out how to fully utilize the patio as it has a lot of room. I hope that the restaurant figures it out, since I love food diversity.

The red pesto that came with the goat cheese was addictive!For my main course, I ordered the Shrimp Perogue (sp?), which was really good. The eggplant in the dish seemed a bit random - not sure it fit in well with the shrimp and the sauce. Nevertheless, it was very tasty.My colleagues got an assortment of entre's. The rack of lamb was the stand-out from what I heard. My collegue was salivating over his \"tender and juicy\" dish, which I must admit, did look quite appetizing.Overall, I think this is an excellent restaurant, and has popped up on our map just when we had eaten practically everything on the Acadia menu.

We've been coming here for close to eight years and are always pleased with the service, food and experience. I have to disclose that I am kind of a hummus connoisseur, having spent a summer in Detroit (no, listen!), which at the time had the largest Arabic population outside of the Middle East, and I really like hummus to be creamy and subtly flavorful. I think Terrace has some of the best hummus I've ever had, and I think they offer the best hummus in Little Rock. We often order some to go at the end of our meal to have the next day. One of my favorite restaurants in the nation is Jerusalem's in Minneapolis, which has the best shawirma (or gyro meat), and Terrace's is just as good!Last night we visited again, and noticed some changes. The floor plan had been altered to open up the dining room a little, which we thought was attractive. We had a lovely table on the outside wall for two, and I ordered a cosmopolitan (the Yelp page above says beer and wine only, but they have a full bar and mixed a cool, refreshing cosmo for me). I almost always have the same dinner: My husband and I split some hummus to start, then I have the warm goat cheese appetizer. Last night was no exception to this ritual of two appetizers. The warm goat cheese is nut crusted and they serve a healthy portion along with roasted garlic and olives with toast. (Last night, the toast was stale, which shocked me because they never do anything wrong here. I ate the goat cheese and garlic with pita, and when I mentioned it to the server she was horrified, said she was sorry, the manager came over and also apologized. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, because I LOVE this restaurant and just wanted them to know. Later, when the bill came, they did not charge us for this item. I said I hadn't meant for them to do this, and the waitress said she knew that and again, they were sorry that there was a problem.) I love the goat cheese! It's just heavenly. For my entree I almost always ask them to make a special plate for me, gyro meat, tabouli and hummus, and they always do. It's a trio of my favorite Mediterranean flavors! The meat is so delicious and tender, and goes so well with the crisp freshness of the tabouli salad (and I can't go wrong with more hummus, right?). But last night, I was preparing for a long training run, so I wanted more carbs. Looking over the menu made me sad that I couldn't order about five or six different entrees. So many things looked great, plus they had a lot of delicious sounding specials. I asked the waitress if I should get the hamburger with blue cheese and hand-cut fries, which was a special, or the veal and pecan fettucini, which is on the regular menu. She directed my choice toward the veal, and I was so grateful. It was amazing! \u00a0A slim veal cut, lightly breaded and sauteed with pecans and sauce and a delicious side of fettucini and veggies. I brought home about 1/3 of it because it was so delicious, I didn't want to leave it. My husband was going to a poker party, where there would be snacks and pizza, so he didn't want a giant meal, though he also said everything looked so good, as usual. He ordered one of his favorite things to start, the dolmades. He then ordered one of the special appetizers for an entree, the spanakopita. These came in triangles, and I could see they were perfectly brushed with butter; the filo crusts were golden brown, and my husband liked the dill used to flavor them.
