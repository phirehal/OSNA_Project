Oh man, fried zucchini is the best, and Georgia's did not disappoint! I got a vegetarian gyro with tzaziki on it (you have to order tzaziki on the side, it doesn't come with it). It was one of the smallest gyros I've had, but wasn't the cheapest. It was loaded with vege's, and it was yummy! Wish it were a bit less pricey for it's size.The day we were there, the service was fine- but other reviews make it sound like it's typically not that great.

It feels like a bar that serves greek food. \u00a0I guess they tout their 32oz beer, which unless you are serious, is going to get warm, I'm never a fan of those. I was impressed with their on tap beer selection. (fat tire, shocktop, dos equis amber and then the usual american dratfs) The service was ok, a little slow, but friendly. The hummus was good, I recommend they change the presentation, as a cat owner it hit too close to looking like a tin of cat food was dumped on the plate. The bread served with it was also delicious. We both got the gyro (an original and chicken) they were just ok. They needed lettuce and feta. I would definitely not order the chicken again, but the original meat was good. Also I think the prices are a little high for a gyro with no sides.

We had a table of five, and decided to split a \"Sampler Platter\", made up of fries, breaded zucchini sticks, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and black bean quesadillas. Most everything was good, and to be honest, a larger portion than we expected for $9.99 (ordering individual appetizers ranges from $4.29-$6.99). It seemed everyone in our party ordered something different, from burgers, to gyros, to dinner plates. It didn't take long for our meals to arrive, however, my father-in-law was somehow completely left out of the equation (despite him ordering with the rest of us).
