WHY??-There's this sweet soy sauce that tastes like candy and I don't understand it.-The salmon salad was just chopped salmon nigiri in cucumber noodles and a bland sauce.-Sunomono is so bland-That salmon cooked in a pouch is way under portionedYeah. Maybe I'd go there more if they had more authentic dishes worth their price."], ["Alma A.", "We paid $67 for the WORST \"Japanese\" food I have ever had! And that's after the manager comped us 20% off the bill, when I went to the bar to see what could be done. Odd tasting, Herb covered(?!) vegetables in my Chicken Teriyaki and his recommend steak dish. My ckn bowl was not even CLOSE to teriyaki tasting. Their yakisoba is just plain, unseasoned!! spaghetti. He ordered a steak combo plate, came with fried rice and ckn skewer. They forgot both the sides, his meat was cold and also overcooked! It seemed like the kitchen was sporadically put out food for different tables our entire meal. Our nervous waiter was already getting told off by another large table (who seemed to be getting most of THEIR dishes) so we waited patiently for him to come around but he was so hard to catch bc of the large angry party! Get this, we had to ask him for something EVERY SINGLE TIME he brought a plate, THE ENTIRE MEAL and could barely catch him! We were excited to enjoy ourselves eating out but this got to the point of ridiculousness. Dipping bowls for soy sauce when he brought the sushi rolls, (I mean c'mon!) a fork for our kiddo's yakisoba kids meal (first dish out ALL by itself), drink refills in between. Finally the manager came over to check on us in the midst of helping the angry table and got us our \"fried rice\" and ckn skewer (to go) along with the check and....their fried rice was white rice with soy sauce poured over it!! Seriously?! NO veggies and when my bf started eating, the center was pure white! That did it, I got up to find her and ask for a discount. I even called ahead to ask a few questions and picked this place over Hon Machi very close by, could have been our regular spot, but was BAD!! Fellow diners, we are not picky at all, but this was so far the only time I have ever come away RESENTFUL of that $67 charge on my CC, I'm still wishing I had pushed for a bigger discount but that night we were ready to get the hell out of there and take our sh*tty fried rice back to the hotel."], ["Michelle A.", "My husband and I stopped in for lunch today...

Great flavor, lots of scallions but zero tofu pieces. Vegetable Tempura gets 5Stars. Generous portions. More than the two of us could finish. Loved that they included Cauliflower. Spicy Tuna Roll earns 3Stars only because the Spicy Mayo was too hot for my liking. The Skinny Roll earns 5Stars. At least a 10 piece roll. It was huge! Rolls are served with 3 Dipping Sauces. We had to ask for lower sodium soy sauce as they only keep regular on the table. The one thing this place does not offer is a house salad."], ["Donna H.", "So-so. The food, the service, the menu, the pricing. The portions are huge but when the food is mediocre, who cares. $60 for 2 people. Sheesh! We found the cheapest sushi roll ($8.50 ... All others started at $14), my husband ordered a beer and I got apple saki. Usually that saki comes in a regular wine glass but this was served in a double shot glass. I had to take the smallest sips to ensure I didn't down it in 1 gulp. And at $4.50 it was a rip off. Main entrees - my husband got a steak, veggies, and some other sides ... His steak was cooked to medium well when he asked for medium rare. He said it was almost shoe leather. He enjoyed the other parts of his dish - flavor were okay. \u00a0I asked the waiter for a \"comfort food\" kind of meal, I mentioned something like a soup and noodle bowl - he suggested their curry chicken or pork. I went for it (nothing even close to what I asked for but whatever, lol).I got the fried pork that had curry sauce poured over it and white rice was under everything. \u00a0The pork had zero flavor (the breading needed something - maybe salt but not table salt, the batter needed to be seasoned properly) but it was cooked right. The rice was blah/chewy and the curry was really spicy. I told the waiter that black pepper is spicy to me and he assured me this curry was very mild. My mouth was on fire! My husband took a few bites and even he thought it was pretty spicy and he loves spicy food. Anyway, I picked a few bites of my meal and pushed it away. My husband said we could take it home & he'd eat it for lunch the next day. \u00a0Oh, this bowl of rice and thin pork chop was 14 freaking dollars! I could have fed a family of 4 this same meal for that price. Geeze! There were some dipping sauces dropped off at our table but the waiter didn't bother to describe them even though he asked if we'd ever been there before (we said \"no\") ... I believe that's your cue to explain things!The waiter wasn't observant at all. If I saw someone only take 2 bites of a dish and push it away, I'd certainly ask if anything was wrong. He came by when my husband was nearly done with his food and said to us \"I'll get your check ... And a to-go box?\" \u00a0He (waiter) ragged on the place too - making fun of the menu... Claiming some word meant soup but the restaurant was using it wrong and the owner is dumb. What the what?! I'm bummed because I was excited when this place was under construction, hoping for a decent Asian place in Alamo Ranch. Such a disappointment. The interior is trendy... the decor is a welcome change from fast food chains in the area, but at $60 for 2 people I think I won't be coming back."], ["Bee B.", "Great service & great food!The staff was very helpful in helping me make my decision on what to select.

We moved to another table and she still made no attempt to clean the floor."], ["Charena C.", "My parents & I came here while out of town for an interview I had. The inside is fairly small, but our wait wasn't long. We were seated fairly quickly, but our waitress did not come by until maybe 5 minutes after due to how busy the restaurant was (or so it seems). Every person receives a free miso soup & an array of 3 dipping sauces that include spicy mayo, unagi sauce, & a spicy, sour (thai-inspired?) sauce. We ordered quite a bit, so I'll just go ahead and get into those details. Spicy Calamari: 2/5. The batter was not crispy at all. It was soggy. Definitely would not order again.New Style Tempura: 3/5. The tempura was lightly battered. They do not joke around with you when they say sweet spicy mayo. It was very sweet, and I thought they put a little too much sauce on top. Try ordering this with the sauce on the side.Kumori Rice: 4/5. I'm not really a fan of fried rice. I don't understand why people order it at restaurants at an entree (but that's just me). My mom ordered it, and said it was good. It was decent at best.Mixed Sashimi: 4/5, half order. The three fish came styled as roses. The tuna was extremely darker than I'm used to. The salmon & tuna were great. The hamachi was a bit chewy. Mixed Tempura: 5/5. This included shrimp, squid, white fish, and various vegetables including carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, onion, and zucchini. Again, very hard to mess up tempura.Charlie Roll: 5/5. I thought this was great. It's a riceless roll. It has salmon, tuna, escolar, shrimp, and crab wrapped in cucumber.The ikura & yuzu sauce was subtle, but I enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy raw fish, cucumber, and a slight sour kick.Overall impressed with this restaurant."], ["Tracy S.", "Great atmosphere. We were seated quickly and offered complimentary Miso soup...it was delicious.Food. I thought the selection was great. I'm not a sushi person but my kids and husband loves it. They all found something they liked ( kids are 7 & 9).

We will return."], ["Desirae F.", "Service: greatDrinks: caipirinha is not that great here.Appetizers: delicious (hand grenade, jalape\u00f1o firecracker, and gyoza)Teppanyaki: not so great. Over-seasoned veggies. The meat is tough. And it is way overpriced for the amount of food you get (see pics).Sushi rolls: nice presentation, \u00a0but the taste is not up to par. And they put cream cheese in almost every single roll. Not very authentic or flavorful. Also over-priced. (See pics)"], ["Emma R.", "Great first impression! Started off with Spicy edamame, Jalape\u00f1o Firecracker, and the Tuna Jalape\u00f1ito as appetizers. The Firecracker was our favorite. The perfect spicy - jalape\u00f1o stuffed with crab cream cheese, tempura fried and covered with a spicy mayo and sweet soy sauce. The tuna Jalape\u00f1ito was a cocktail glass with sashimi grade tuna and a mix of marinated cilantro and cucumber. All were tasty. I got an Angel Roll for my meal which was very flavorful! My fianc\u00e9 got the Picasso which was pretty good but not as flavorful. All dishes have excellent presentations!

Price is higher than most places, server was friendly, but the service was bad. Waited a while to be greeted, had to wait a while for drinks, and food was cooked terribly when the place had two other tables ordering food so it's not like they were rushed. Person who I assumed was the manager was conversing by the bar with other employees. Even if it's business related don't seat customers near where you huddle your employees. Some of the noodles that were ordered were a lot spicer than advertised on the menu. Try take out if you really wanna try it first I'd say."], ["Nahum L.", "This place was great.

With a soon to open In n' Out Burger a couple months away, this area will probably be a madhouse until the stupidity subsides.Kumori is a nice place, new of course, and offering a nice variety of rolls. Like all Americanized sushi rolls, you'll find avocado and cream cheese on many of their rolls. Personally, I'm not a fan. I liked the tightness of the roll here. Too many sushi roll makers don't make their rolls tight enough. Additionally, the rice was cooked just about perfectly. We only had some rolls so I can't really comment on the other food items. What I can say is that as far as rolls go in San Antonio, these were decent is taste and preparation.In my \"Tip\" I wrote that no Happy Hour menu was posted or otherwise advertised. Another tipster stated that they do have a Happy Hour with 50% off house rolls. Maybe worth a look. Anyway, in Alamo Ranch, it's either Kumori or Hon Machi for your Japanese inspired food so take your pick."], ["Lauren M.", "I'm not a big fan of sushi, but I do like the other foods that sushi places have to offer. \u00a0This place just isn't great. \u00a0The miso soup was blah and there was a really, really long hair stuck to the bottom of the bowl (on the outside). \u00a0I ordered the beef teriyaki udon and it was way too sweet and the beef had a poor texture even though it was supposedly medium rare. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered a jupiter roll, and it was over-fried. \u00a0The place is nice inside, and our male server was great, but overall I will not be coming back."], ["Janice H.", "Not many good sushi places in San antonio!!Kumori did well..loved their skinny roll!!

The sauces that came with it were great, a hot sauce, a chili mayo and an eel sauce. You also get a bowl of miso soup which I think needed some tofu but it was still good.

The spicy calamari is amazing! \u00a0 I usually get a double order because it's so good. \u00a0Only thing I would not recommend is carry out during times when they are busy."], ["Joyce I.", "I'm sure some of the drawbacks of this place can be chalked out to it being new. But there's a lot that just goes poorly with the food as well.Let's start with the BAD SERVICE. There only seemed to be one waitress that seemed to know what she was doing. She was my waiter and 8 other tables' waiter. Around there were guys bussing, seating people and filling drinks. But they didn't know any of the tables orders, or could helped with checks. Get your act together, guys. When I ask to rush a check, it shouldn't be delivered 10 mins past when I'm done eating. Even when I asked for it before I got my food.I used to work at a sushi restaurant, and we would have just as many tables filled but only 3 servers working as bussers/hostesses too. And we still would do a better job than the 6 or so employees they had running their front. We also had 2 sushi chefs (same amount as Kumori) and got better food out faster. So this was hard to put up with, and was inexcusable. Lastly, my waitress never asked if we were happy with our food. Since my whole table were thoroughly disappointed in all our food, it would've been nice to be asked to see if she would even do anything about it. Yet we could see she was the only waitress really working so I didn't see the point of bringing it to her attention, when she was too busy to do anything about it.So now, the food. I love sushi, I love the freshness it can bring to my palette. So I got a salmon salad to start. This was okay, hard to screw up. Then, I made the mistake of ordering a fried roll. It was called the Kumori Special Roll, so you think it'd be good. I wanted it so that it could fill me up, but it was so meagerly filled with fish. I ordered it for the eel and it had the tiniest sliver in it. The salmon on top was such a bare minimum, I couldn't even notice it with the katsu-like breading on the roll. Entirely way too much rice to sushi ratio! My cousin got a tuna roll and was just as disappointed. She also got an Omega roll (also fried) and it had a stingy oil taste, with the coating looking poorly done. I don't think anyone that knows decent sushi would be impressed with their rolls. Wasabi and ginger wasn't given automatically with any of the rolls, we had to ask for them. Ridiculous. And the waiter told me she didn't have wasabi mayo, when I saw it as an ingredient to a roll. So they should probably learn their menu better....We went during lunch so there was the option of lunch specials. THE LUNCH SPECIALS SUCK. The roll options are all really basic, you can't choose any special rolls. The most nigiri you can get is 3 pieces for the special.Again, I've seen much better options at other sushi places. My other cousin ordered the chicken teppanyaki with fried rice option. Her chicken was noticeably dry and flavorless unless you dipped it in the accompanied hot mustard sauce. Didn't help with the dry, chalky consistency of the chicken though.Overall, it was a crap experienced that led to an even crappier one. Apparently, the sushi/food gave both my cousins food poisoning. So I hope you're happy, Kumori."], ["Heather J.", "I went today for lunch and have to say that I was pleased by the experience.Kumori is located on a corner spot inside the Alamo Ranch shopping complex, right next to Yum Thai. \u00a0The interior is very nice, and while it is a bit dark due to the window tinting, I prefer the shade to baking away in Texas heat blasting through all those windows. \u00a0They have a pretty extensive menu, which includes a small but very nice set of lunch specials. \u00a0I got the sunomono (listed as mixed on the menu, but they had no issues with swapping in the octopus only version) and one roll combo (salmon, off the small list of options for that deal). \u00a0They give you a complimentary bowl of miso when you first sit down and a plethora of sauces: besides the soy sauce already on the table, they have a house citrus-soy ponzu type sauce that comes in a little kettle, and three dipping sauces (spicy mayo, eel sauce, chili sauce). \u00a0Everything came out quickly and was delicious! \u00a0I have been looking for a place with a good sunomono and this place has it. \u00a0For just around $10 I got a huge lunch and the quality was great. \u00a0They also apparently do take out orders over the phone/in person, which I am sure is a bonus for local workers.There are two small reasons I can't really give place 5 stars. \u00a0First, they were playing this weird, trance-jazz music that made me feel like I was sitting in a pretentious NYC club. \u00a0It wasn't overly loud, but the club vibe was not something I found very conducive to having a lunch or dinner with friends, had I been there with a group - it was also weirdly jarring against the golf playing on the TVs behind the bar. \u00a0The second reason was customer service related. \u00a0My waiter was great, but the hostess actually stood and stared at me when I first came in and said I was by myself. \u00a0I had to actually prompt her for \"can I sit at a table, or the bar?\" before she took me to sit somewhere. \u00a0Apparently eating solo confuses some people. \u00a0Second, a manager/owner of some sort was in the back area where they sat me, on his iPhone lounging at a nearby table. \u00a0I *think* he was talking business, but doing it loudly, splayed out in front of the customers as you watch Golf on the bar TV doesn't give off a very professional vibe. \u00a0He cleared out as soon as anyone besides me was seated in the back area, but he was there for a good 15 minutes before that happened. Those two little things aren't enough to make me avoid the place - looking forward to coming back and trying out the tempura/Teppanyaki in the future. \u00a0But if you are looking for a reasonably priced sushi place, I would definitely recommend Kumori."], ["Jae R.", "Tried this place for lunch today for the first time.

The rice wasn't really sushi type rice either, was weird- or just cooked weird, so for $9.99 I got a roll of rice with krab stick and cream cheese, which was tempura fried, w/ shredded krab on top...

I decided to take my family, my father spent 10 years in Japan and my step mother is Japanese. I have worked as a sushi chef here in San Antonio and in College Station while in college. I went in open minded expecting good food but my parents are usually a bit more critical. The ambiance was very nice and seemed clean. Service was good, server had recommendations, menu knowledge, and kept our drinks full. Miso soup was average. Seaweed salad was good but gyoza was straight from the frozen section. Then came entrees... Yakisoba was absolutely terrible it was far below instant tasting and, I hate to say this, but I nearly spit it out. Odd that yakisoba was served in a domburi as well. Tempura batter had little flavor and could have used more time in the fryer. The part of the meal that needed the absolute most attention was the rice. It was a bit dry and did not taste like Japanese rice nor like much effort was put into cooking the rice. Rice at a Japanese restaurant should be prepared impeccably and with pride. The presentation of the nigiri could use work but on a brighter note the McAllen roll was good. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I expect better from Japanese restaurants. I hope this review only serves to highlight some areas that could use improvement, I plan on returning to give Kumori another chance."], ["Matt Z.", "Came to Kumori for my moms birthday and was so impressed.

Half was a booth, half was chairs and the wait staff order input area was right by our table, it made it very awkward. Service was terrible. I can't remember having that bad of service in a long, long time. Our server was slow, would disappear and when we were trying to get our check to get the heck out, my husband and I shouted to him as he walked right by our table, and he made a strange motion to us to keep waiting. I can't describe it. He was the strangest waiter I've ever had. The food was only ok that night. Since the service was so awful, which made our experience awful, we are not going back.

The San Antonio roll was surprisingly refreshing and had a nice bite to it, the thin cucumber outer layer was way better than the normal rice coatings. The chicken yakimeshi and miso soup have no wow factor and I feel I could whip up something tastier at home.

That's what I told myself yesterday at Sushi Zushi's happy hour, when confronted by a vast host of sushi with dwindling hopes of victory. Why did I order so many? Call it hunger, call it desire, call it economics; I later called it stupid. There were four rolls altogether, some sushi laid flat, some standing, all of them appearing delicious. I ordered a Philadelphia roll, Key West roll, Spicy Tuna roll, and also the Spicy Salmon roll. Enshadowing my many sushi loomed a 22 oz draft Sapporo, the glass beaded with condensation and its rim crowned in foam. How did I proceed, you ask? One piece at a time. That, my Yelp friends, is how a foodie must proceed in such circumstances. Ok, enough with the story-telling and onto the review. The rolls were good, good enough to order again and at full price! This was not my first Sushi Zushi experience either, for even last week I tried a new roll there--the Dallas Roll. Not bad, though too radishy for my tastes, and it didn't leave me with the sense that I got a lot for the money. The way I see it, I much prefer to pay $7 more and get 4x the food plus a huge Japanese beer. If you haven't read between the lines on that, here it is. I don't think the specialty rolls at Sushi Zushi are a good value (despite the rolls being market price), but the happy hour is a real bargain and extremely tasty. Sushi lovers, if you want fresh, abundant sushi without breaking the bank, go to Sushi Zushi's happy hour and indulge! No fan of sushi would regret it."], ["Christina C.", "They make pretty good sushi, but don't make the mistake of ordering carryout or delivery. There's a huge difference between quality and quantity you receive when they don't expect you to see it until it's home and too late. I enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner, this is where I first discovered Zing Zang bloody mary mix (the world's best) and they make a pretty fantastic seared beef tenderloin appetizer. My to-go order today, however, isn't the quality I've come to know them by, the beef sashimi is half the size as it would have been plated in restaurant, the seared tuna appetizer was not seared but fully cooked through and basically tasted like the canned lunch meat version with far less pepper crusting than anything with the title \"seared pepper- crusted tuna\" should be allowed to boast. Their Sushi Zushi roll was alright, but they've done better in the past. I'm thinking of starting a list of \"Places That Should Not Offer Take Out But Do\" and Sushi Zushi, you'd be the frontrunner. Now if you are planning an actual sit- down trip, by all means, I would recommend it.

I had a cucumber saketini and a Yuzu-basil martini. The cucumber was a very interesting, decent drink that just made my mouth salivate in an uncomfortable way. The \"spicy salt rim\" is likely to blame. The Yuzu-basil was delicious. Almost lemon dropy but with a warmer fruit flavor.Even the $4 generic salmon roll was very fresh and tasty. We had: BoraBora, Cosimo, Janie & Strawberry rolls as well. I wish I could recall notes or nuances of each roll but they were so good! The Cosimo roll definitely tastes a little like a baked potato, and the Strawberry roll was a lot like the Frushi roll from Yellowfish. Our server was very attentive and we definitely tipped 20%.

I'm a fan of authentic Japanese food and this does tend to lean more toward the American palate. But I've always been happy with the sushi rolls, the teppanyaki, and the chicken katsu.

It was way too salty and seafood was waaaay overcooked and dry and rubbery. An overall disappointing dish."], ["Allison T.", "I ordered delivery from here and it took over an hour and a half. I wasn't too upset about that, though; I understand restaurants can get busy during certain times, but when my boyfriend and I received the food, the sushi was warm and the hot food was room temperature. It was probably sitting in the delivery guy's car for a while.What added to our distaste for this establishment is the quality of food.. The sushi did not taste fresh at all. My boyfriend ordered the chirashi bowl, and he ate no more than 3 bites. It was disgusting. The spicy scallop handroll that I ordered was okay; not great. I also ordered the pickle musubi and the salmon musubi. I've had spam musubi before and was expecting something like that, but this was a ball of rice with little specks of pickles and salmon. I paid $3-$4 for a ball or rice.

PLOT TWIST: I actually did. I tried and liked it all, from the tame miso soup and edamame to the crazy selection of rolls and a dessert of fried ice cream. I was hooked.This is where my relationship with sushi began.I still come here to get my fix of their soft shell crab appetizer- I've yet to find anyone who does it as well, and the joy sauce it's paired with goes with everything you'll find on the table.Some people think the prices are a bit too high, or that the rolls are too Americanized, but that's their specialty, take it or leave it. Their nigiri is still solid, but this is not a \"traditional\" sushi experience, and it's not trying to be.Great place to take sushi noobs but sushi snobs will probably find something to whine about- so keep this place your own go-to spot after a hard day.

I have had 13 minutes to look at the menu, I might be ready bud. Anyway the management goes to the table next to us to help clean it instead of to inquire whether or not we have even been helped yet (this was before we even had drinks) good to know they're focused on turning a table so they can make more money for the company.

I recommend getting uni nigiri and ikura and asked for them to be topped with a quail egg. Soo good! Also the yamagoba roll and onigiri with smoked salmon. Also you need to try out their egg shooters. Just had a hint of joy sauce or soy sauce and toss that sucker back!

Noodles had a nice bite, noodles were separated well and perfectly chilled.Overall not super impressive and can hit the spot if you are dying for sushi, but there are other places I would explore first. \u00a0Oh..they do have a good wine list though, which does tilt half a star in their favor."], ["Erica S.", "Delivery order got here a lot faster today. This time I got the river walk roll, some eel sashimi, &miso soup. I wish the soup would've had more tofu but it was yummy. Deeeeelicious eel.

We got three rolls one of them tempura style FYI it was cold and I was told it just came out of the kitchen it was a bit underdone kind of pasty inside. The rice was mush as well. I wasn't a fan the other rolls were just ok not awful but edible. \u00a0I also got the seafood soup all the fish was over cooked and almost dry in a soup it might not make sense but that's the best way to describe it.

Most sushi lovers in San Antonio know of Sushi Zushi. Not that long ago they had a huge issue and the food & service suffered... HOWEVER, I think they are back on track and my experience today was a great indication of that. I chose the Colonnade location (warzbach/i10).I entered into a beautiful, yet simple \u00a0decor and elegant atmosphere. Creams and rich browns, very warm and inviting. \u00a0The kitchen and prep area was open and very entertaining to watch. I immediately ordered hot tea and was happy to get a huge iron pot within minutes. Yum! Next I ordered the SUSHI PLATTER LUNCH A ($14). 1) \u00a04x Nigiri Zushi- 1 each of Tuna, Salmon, Octopus and Tamago. \u00a0The tuna and salmon were very cold and fresh. Generous sizes. The Tamago was also generous sized, light fluffy, folded perfectly and nice flavors. The octopus was a little tough for my taste and had no flavor. \u00a0Would prob substitute or leave out next time. 2) Chicken Yakitori Skewer was delicious and warm, the sauce was not to sweet and had a smoky taste. I would def order this again. It was on the small side (5 inch skewer) and It did have green pepper and onion but easy to pick off if you don't like. I wanted more! 3) Yakinieski Rice w/ Veggies was very nice. However it did have fried egg and should be disclosed on the menu. Nice change from plain rice. I wish it was sticker, but it was tasty.4) Tuna Roll and 5) Cucumber Roll were great, but a little too much rice. 6) Spicy California Roll- it was PERFECT!!! \u00a0Not too saucy and perfectly balanced. 7) Futomaki Roll (shiitake mushroom, cucumber, Tamago, kampyo, and Sakura dembu). Again PERFECT . It was rich and delicious! Balanced and would def order again. Overall a great plate. That plate could be shareable with those big portions. The manager, \u00a0Malon was amazing. He was buzzing around the totally full house (packed by 12:25) and was filling drinks, greeting people and checking in on people. He was hustling and you can tell he was enjoying his job! \u00a0I assume the success of this busy location would be greatly due to his care and attention. \u00a0The staff all were attentive and worked together. I had more than one checking in on me. Great job!"], ["Chris Y.", "Really awesome place for some great and different ideas! \u00a0I had 3-4 different roles.

I was surprised at how big this place was when I first walked in. Lunch is super busy, but the waitress was still very attentive. I ordered the Katsu Don. It's very different than the katsu don I've tried in Houston, but it's not bad. The pork they give was reasonably sized. The shiitake mushrooms were different than mushrooms I've had before as well. They give you a lot of food. I had to take my food home because I had leftovers!"], ["Meg H.", "Their sushi is amazing--I've never had a roll I didn't like! I suggest anything with Crawfish--my favorites are the Cajun and Godzilla rolls. The Godzilla is great if you like spicy food. I also recommend the spicy Edamame as an appetizer. It has a barbecue/teriyaki flavor with a little kick. Be sure to check out their happy hour specials too. They have drink, appetizer and rolls for less, depending on the day and week.The downtown location is tiny, not my favorite. The Colonnade and Lincoln Heights locations are bigger and offer a more comfortable atmosphere."], ["Allison Y.", "A chain sushi restaurant...what do you expect? Pretty average sushi with average prices, decent prices during happy hour. Not the best stuff, not the worst. The decor is clean, modern, and hip. There is plenty of room for groups but would also be a nice place for a date. My visit to Sushi Zushi was made memorable by our (endearingly) awkward waiter who would sheepishly stand off to the side with the water until I noticed him and gestured for him to come fill up our glasses. He would join our table conversations with happy, possibly unwelcome, interjections throughout the night. Waiter boy also told me that he had a reputation for dropping plates. To clear our plates, he made multiple trips back and forth from our table, leaving each time with only one plate in each hand. The poor kid. I don't know if the rest of our party found him as amusing as I did, but I found him funny because he reminded me a little of my awkward self.So if you're planning on heading over to Sushi Zushi, keep an eye out for my poor waiter friend.

I could have gotten a grande drink from Starbucks for less. \u00a0The tea was very bitter. The sushi selections were extensive but the sushi themselves were not that great. Small portions and not as fresh as I would have liked. They appeared to have been frozen and then thawed out. Gave the restaurant two stars, because it wasn't the worst I've ate at, but definitely nowhere near the caliber of New York or San Francisco. \u00a0Pricing is somewhat high for mediocre food. \u00a0If you are desperate for sushi, this may be the only place in town.

I went here with my sister a few years ago and we ended up getting A LOT more food then what we really needed. We didn't realize how big the portions were so just ask your server for advice about how much is too much, that way you're not paying for wasted or unnecessary food.Enjoy! ;)"], ["Sarah J.", "If you are looking for traditional sushi, this probably isn't the place to go, but just because it isn't traditional doesn't mean it isn't good!

It is from 4-7 on M-F and the specials apply to drinks and select rolls. I am addicted to their cucumber saketinis. All of their rolls are delicious.

As for the sushi side, I've only had their tamago sashimi/sushi, which is grilled egg. It's actually quite hard to find at cookie-cutter Americanized sushi joints, and when done well is a fluffy, sweet but savory dream. Theirs was quite good.Now, the Korean food! After ordering you'll be brought a \"Banchan\", kind of like appetizers in the states but meant more as a accompaniments for your meal & a crucial part of authentic Korean dining. It varies but you'll usually always get kimchi, fish cakes, vegetables & pickle assortments. All tasty & a great way to get just a tiny bit adventurous without being out any money.As for the mains, my FAVE is the Bulgogi. I've tried a few others but none sticks out in my mind like this one. Spicy but a hint of almost sweet barbecue. You can get beef or pork, both great & super filling!I hope more people order Korean items so they never take them off the menu!"], ["Hannah W.", "I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy my experience today at all.

We walked in at 12:20 on a Tuesday and there were only two other filled tables... Not a great sign. We sat down and asked for water. I ordered the roll combo #4, and he got the express sushi deluxe lunch. Our miso came out promptly but everything was disappointing after that. The miso was too salty for my taste. My rolls came out fairly quickly and were fine. The spicy tuna was just not good. The different sauces on top of my stone oak roll were also just kind of bad... The wrong flavor entirely and overpowered all the elements of the roll. My bf unfortunately didn't receive his lunch for another 15 minutes. Not my idea of express... The waitress realized he hadn't received food and went to speak to the chef. They both laughed at his mistake, in front of us, then she came over to apologize for the wait, neglecting to fill our empty glasses.

The seaweed salad was very warm and slathered in TONS of oil. \u00a0Completely limp and inedible. \u00a0The edemame was not salted at all. \u00a0The gyoza was bland (but at least cooked well). \u00a0The house salad was even weird--the dressing was too much oil and again really warm. \u00a0I don't know if this was intentional but it threw it off. \u00a0Lastly, the chicken teriyaki. \u00a0The choice of chicken had a lot of gristly, fatty pieces. \u00a0It was cooked properly but a poor choice of meat. \u00a0The worst was the noodles. \u00a0Straight up $1.00 Ramen noodles. \u00a0Super salty, limp, starchy, college student ramen. \u00a0I wound up throwing most of it out. \u00a0Ate some of the gyoza, miso, and House salad. \u00a0The rest was a waste. \u00a0Never choosing this place again, especially when Li's is right down the street and the food is better prepared with better ingredients."], ["Jinny H.", "I absolutely love the atmosphere of Sushishima. Their food decorations were wonderful, and the taste was alright. My friend took me out for a birthday lunch, and we were very happy with the overall experience. Let's start with the food. Make sure to check-in with Yelp, because you get a free plate of gyoza. Also, the salad that came with the order of the sushi special was pretty good. The sushi for the lunch special was interesting; the California rolls tasted mediocre but the spicy tuna wrapped in rice paper was definitely good. I never had sushi wrapped in that manner before, and it wasn't a let-down; I might try making some of my own that way. I also tried a bite of my friend's teriyaki chicken bento, and it was pretty good, though I'd say that was more on the normal side.As for the service, the waitress took good care of us. We went during lunch, and although it wasn't packed, the restaurant had many customers. Nevertheless, the waitress never neglected to refill the water (and I was drinking A LOT of water since I was dehydrated), and checked in frequently to see if we needed anything. When we asked for the free gyoza, on top of the birthday deals, she didn't seem unenthused at all, which might have occurred at other restaurants; rather, she was very kind. Also, the birthday display truly made me feel special, and I had a great time. Honestly, it's been rough being away from home and celebrating away from family, but little things like these made my day so much better.Overall, with the great atmosphere, pretty food decorations, and nice service, I had no complaints. No wonder there were many people even though it was raining outside; I would come here again."], ["Linda H.", "Well, each Sunday we stop by Whole Foods so we can grocery shop. With that, we've decided to try all the places in the area. So, we decided to have sushi this past Sunday.We walked in and we were delighted to see such a pretty large space. I was preparing myself for a very small space. The decor was rather nice and plenty of room where all the tables were crammed together.We were promptly seated and orders our drinks right away. I had green tea and the little cup that I was given was so cute!!!!We proceeded to order our food and I was happy to see that they had a lunch menu that was available 7 days a weeks. I ordered the lunch sushi b plate. Please be advised that there is one regular roll (CA roll)and two hand rolls (Dynamite hand roll and tuna hand roll). Just FYI. \u00a0CA roll was just a regular CA roll. The tuna roll was kind of bland, but the dynamite roll was well, dynamite!!!! I would definitely order again. My hubby had the lunch Chicken Katsu Don. I was surprised to see that it was served in a clay pot ( it was not cooked in the pot) and initially he enjoyed it. However, there was too much sauce in the rice pot that it became a little overwhelming where he couldn't finish it.We decided to keep lunch light and ended there.

A coworker and I were here after work for the happy hour, and I was thinking about swing by Whataburger first, but I was running late (Happy Hour ends at 6PM), so I decided to forgo the pre-dinner and went straight to the restaurant.

Dragon Roll is very good, Yellow Tail is just ok. The best part is the bill, I paid for my coworker (he ordered 3 more rolls and two soups), the bill is only about $60ish together.

We didn't get the sauce on the side so all the tofu at the bottom were drenched in sauce. Nothing impressive or notable about any of the rolls...What saved this restaurant is the hamachi Kama.

Im not a big roll guy but some of their rolls are actually pretty good. Dont miss their happy hour where things on the menu are up to 50% off.

After looking at the prices on the menu I would never come here after 6 PM the prices are just right during happy hour when a majority of the menu is half off to include alcohol and food. Matt was our server. He was very friendly and welcoming but I feel as though he could've been more attentive but overall the service was good. The four-star rating this place has currently is about accurate. I'm rating it at a three because I was not wowed by the service.

Oh, Happy Hour runs from 3-6PM.We started with their tempura appetizer and were left wanting... It consisted of 2 shrimp and an onion ring. Even for 1/2 off, it was small and uneventful. I ate 2 sushi rolls and I was pleased with both. They appeared to be full-sized rolls not watered-down Happy Hour rolls. The taste was pretty good and the presentation was very niceMy wife ate their Hamachi-kama with vegetables. This dish takes longer to prepare so expect to wait. When the dish arrived it was massive. The waitress told us that the chef said to not expect such a large piece in the future because this was not typical. Well thank you so much Mr. Chef, my wife, who is Japanese, LOVED it. The vegetables were just ordinary which was fine with her but, as with most Asians, she did not care for the steamed rice.If you're in the neighborhood, I would definitely recommend Sushishima's Happy Hour Monday through Wednesday.

HORRIBLE!I'm sorry, but my family and I are from San Francisco and have had sushi from all over. From HI to SF to NY, from Japan to Korea and we have to say, this was the MOST disappointing and disgusting sushi we've ever had. We've have always tried \"little holes\" in the wall all the way to the infamous Nobu (Dallas, Waikiki, Las Vegas & New York). All of which we fortunate enough to enjoy one of the bests. Not saying that every restaurant that we frequent are up to this caliber, but we do have standards. \u00a0We ordered over $120 worth of food and it couldn't have been more disappointed. This place got 4 stars! How does this happen??? This is NOT a 4 star sushi restaurant by any means. \u00a0Where do I start? First, \u00a0sushi rice was hard, stale and not seasoned correctly. Second, the oil they used to fry/tempera with, had a stale and very recycled smell to it. For example, the Hura Maki (fried spring rolls) are none that I've ever had and resembled something I've seen in a bag at Costco. Same with the Gyoza. \u00a0Third, steak was completely overdone and had a refrigerated odor, and was sitting on a bed of oily, greasy saturated bed of ramen noodles.Fourth, the Crown Ika BBQ (squid) \u00a0was so bad my husband spat out the food as soon as he took a bite. It was utterly disgusting and tasted rancid.Fifth, some of the nigiri we ordered: monk fish liver, beyond old! 2 week old pate sitting in the sun, this would be it. Salmon, dry, smelling of a dirty dock, which any sushi aficionado would know, fish should smell of the ocean and not a rotten can of tuna. Unagi (eel) went in the trash, with pretty much everything else. We called the restaurant several times and spoke with a person there and we were hung up on several times. Finally they took our call and asked us if we've ever had monk fish liver and sushi before, because \"it can taste a bit fishy\". \u00a0REALLY? I don't think so. We could go on and on, but my husband is too busy throwing up and chasing off feral cats.

I wouldn't say it's the best of sushi but for San Antonio it's pretty good. This place is more your contemporary, fusion sushi restaurant.

I'm not big on sushi rolls but decided to give them a try that day as well as my usual order of ikura (salmon roe).

I knocked down a star due to inconsistency. For some reason some selections that I ordered were one day allow to have 50% off for happy hour and then the next day 24hrs later it was not allowed. What the hell is up with that? And it was determined by the manager. But seriously that's poorly managed.I dined here twice with my family two evenings back to back. Because the first day's experience really left such a great impression on us we craved for the same food the following day. But the dining experience was like night and day in a matter of 24hours. Yesterday Came here for the happy hour as it was raved about on yelp. Tried it and was not disappointed by yelpers review. Ordered an assortment of sushi, an off menu item call seared scallop, was allow to get a free gyoza appetizer courtesy of yelp check in and also ordered their tempura item. All were delicious and priced just right due to the happy hour deal. Fast forward 24 hours, the second day we tried to order a gyoza with the check in and immediately our waiter said \"oh because of the 50% off happy hour they will not honor the free appetizer.\" \u00a0What!? It was allowed yesterday why can't it be allowed today? So then I asked ok do you have the off item menu Seared scallops and the waiter said yes let me check, he came back and said we have but that is not allow the 50% off for happy hour. I ask ok why is that allowed yesterday and not today and the waiter shrugged and said the manager is here and said its not an item for happy hour. I scratched my head and said well I have a receipt from yesterday's happy hour and it was allowed on our bill. So he said you can talk to the manager. That's proof enough for me that waiters are not train well here at Sushishima or that management cannot make up their minds on what items is allow for happy hour or not.Don't get me wrong I love the happy hour deal it's awesome but the inconsistency to the entrees and food allow are so up in the air and base on each dinning experience is a No No and that is where customer satisfaction and star ratings factors in as well so therefore the lower star ratings.Here's what I ordered the second time see photos and they all taste great I would have the items from the first dining experience but since I could not order them for happy hour I didn't get them the second time we dine there. In addition to the difference in pricing between the two dinning experience we also order the Shrimp and Scallop tempura entree where the first dining we got 2 tempura scallops but unfortunately the second time we order on day 2 we only got 1 scallop.

I love their gyoza and sauce here. 1 per table though.SKIP the chicken yakisoba. The sauce is kind of strange and there is too much chicken vs. noodles.Service has been better lately, but we get different waiters now. -----Sushishima is pretty solid for sushi in San Antonio. I've been here with my fianc\u00e9 several times and with a large group of friends during dinnertime and happy hour. When they first opened they used to give complimentary fried shrimp appetizers which weren't what I was expecting, but they were tasty and I thought it was a nice gesture. I've been satisfied with most of the rolls I've tried here, but I haven't found a favorite yet. I've tried the Rock and Roll, the Dynamite Roll, Sushishima Roll, Phoenix Roll, Crazy Couple Roll, and Summer Roll. The fish tasted fresh, but I can't remember any that I liked more than the other. The rolls here are cut properly and are not too large to put in your mouth like some places. I've also tried the Sushi Special A which was a lot plainer than I was expecting and not worth the price. We've had the chicken teriyaki with fried noodles during happy hour. The portion was large and worth the happy hour price. We've also had the fried ice cream dessert which was good, but I've had better elsewhere. The happy hour here is definitely amazing. It's half off the entire menu usually during 3-6 M-W and it's a big draw for me. They used to give off 30% off coupons during dinnertime to use on your next visit, but I'm not sure they do that anymore. I thought that was very reasonable also. I'm not sure I'd pay full price for some of the menu items.The only reason I didn't give Sushishima 4 stars is because of the attitude the waiter/manager gave us one time I came with a big group during happy hour. They/he acted like they didn't really want to give the happy hour specials and he gave my friend some attitude when she ordered a lot off the menu. I think because he may have been annoyed by our large group coming to happy hour, our food took an extremely long time to come out. I think it took over an hour for the food to come out even though the restaurant wasn't packed. It just really ANNOYS me when restaurants have happy hour and give you attitude about it or act like they don't really want to have it. I've also been here with my fianc\u00e9 once during happy hour and the waiter was really wishy washy about what was included in the happy hour like he didn't want to tell us exactly was included. Either have happy hour and treat the customers with the same respect you'd give them during dinnertime or don't have it at all and charge full price (or limit the hours/change the percent off)."], ["Angela F. W.", "I must say the happy hour at sushishima was excellent. I came in for the first time today and enjoyed my visit very much. The ambience was great and our server was very knowledgeable and attentive. I ordered an appetizer called crown ika and texas roll. Both were delicious. I especially liked the octopus that came with this special sauce, very fresh and chewy. Great choice!The price was shockingly cheap with everything half off the regular price. I am sure my wallet was just as happy as my stomach. I wonder why we didn't get any complimentary items as so many reviewers mentioned though. Maybe they don't offer that during happy hours? I don't know. \u00a0I have to admit this place is probably equally good as sushihana which is my favorite sushi place in SA. Nevertheless, the best sushi I've ever had is still in San Francisco.

We asked for the traditional seating, where you must remove your shoes and sit on cushions. It's fairly comfortable for anyone who is tall or unable to sit cross legged on the floor or with their feet under them. I didn't have a problem, but then I am not a tall person.The place is very easy to pass up, so ask a friend to help you look for something akin to an old, abandoned looking building next to a small Japanese grocey store that looks like a portable. I asked for the Ocha, the hot tea. It was a mix of green and barley tea, very good and reminded me of meals in Japan. It was refilled quickly and with great service. I just went to Japan a few months ago, so the memory of food is fairly fresh. The first item you are given are the pickles. Oh, how I miss Japanese pickles. Radish, cucumbers, and other mystery vegetables. In Japan, they are much smaller in size and quantity. Definitely, more authentic than any other place in San Antonio.And, fresh is definitely how I would describe the sushi. I ordered the special Niki's meal which consisted of sashimi, tempura, and a grilled mackerel or yellow tail. I chose the mackerel because I particularly did not get a chance to eat it in Japan. The sushi itself is fairly fresh and has uncommon items. There is no salmon here, so don't come looking for it. The tempura is good, somewhat above average for San Antonio, but I am used to a different type of breading that is crispier and \"melt in your mouth\"or even panko. Of course, the meal came with so much food that it is possible it got a little cold by the time I made it to the dish.I really recommend this restaurant for people who are adventurous and not afraid of trying true Japanese cuisine. Also, make sure you aren't in a hurry because service is pretty slow. It took about 2 hours to eat our meal. I think there's a lot of customers, plus they really want you to enjoy the experience and relax. Maybe eat at a regular table if you need faster service."], ["Jade M.", "I ate dinner here with my dad yesterday and our experience was just okay. We arrived a little after 8pm and the restaurant was pretty crowded so we had to wait for a table. While we were waiting we got to watch the sushi chef which was cool but I'm sad to report that there were flies crawling in the area where they kept the fish :(. I know that you can't control flies coming in but it just didn't seem very clean. As soon as I saw this I made a mental note to just order hot food. I felt bad for our server (who was also the hostess) because she seemed to be constantly running back and forth to the kitchen running food orders while also acting as the cashier. Interesting I saw two guys walking around in aprons who didn't seem to be doing anything. Perhaps they could have helped her out. My dad and I ordered green tea and the ten course meal. We received cucumber salad, soup with fried wontons, fried chicken, fried oyster, fish tempura, yakitori, sukiyaki and vegetable tempura for $18 a person (not sure if that adds up to ten courses though haha). I really enjoyed the vegetable tempura and yakitori the best. Unfortunately the sukiyaki was cold and chewy :(. I think it was definitely a good deal for the price and the amount/variety of food we got but I don't think we'll be returning."], ["Noah M.", "Another one of San Antonio's hidden gems. Don't let their appearance fool you! This is one of my favorite restaurants in SA, and one of the best places to get sushi! They have a great sushi bar and Japanese seating in the back. Service is great!"], ["Angela F. W.", "4.5 star. This place is really kool! I had heard of Niki's numerous times but never dined in here. I wasn't so sure b/c it looks so ghetto from the outside. But don't let that fool ya! I finally decided to come for dinner a couple of weeks ago and wasn't disappointed at all. I actually LOVED the ambience! It made me feel like I entered Doraemon's \"anywhere door\" in his pocket. When I entered the door of Niki's, I was instantly transported from San Antonio to somewhere in Japan! This place felt so intimate and sentimental. And for some reason it also reminded me of underground secret dinning.I loved the sushi bar! It has a very traditional look with Japanese flower arrangements. I was brought hot towel to clean my hands and a small plate of cucumber salad when I sat down. Nice! After studying the menu, I was going to order the temaki sushi mix which comes with 6 rolls. But my server told me that they were big hand rolls which would be a lot. She suggested ordering the Chirashi instead which is a scattered sushi bowl. I had never had Chirashi before so I gladly took her advice. It is basically a bowl of sushi rice topped with sashimi and garnishes. I got the small which was actually decent sized. The bowl was very good, super fresh and delicious! I had to add another order of eel roll though b/c I was very hungry. I was curious about the plum wine. My server was so friendly to offer me some to sample. I really liked it so I got a glass for only $4! I saw two Japanese guys sitting next to me eating some dish with rice. It looked so good! I'd love to try more traditional Japanese items on the menu next time! After dining here, I can attest that Niki's is deff a very traditional Japanese establishment. Ppl who run this place are Japanese and you see many Japanese immigrants eat here so it is deff legit. For all the sushi places I've tried in SA so far, this is the most authentic for sure. But you might not enjoy it as much as I do if you like the Americanized rolls with cream cheese, avocado, etc. b/c you won't find them here. The best part to me is the price! It's very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting and is a tad cheaper than other sushi places in my opinion. My tab was only $21 plus tips! I think I've found the spot for sushi. Can't wait to go back for some sushi gluttony!!"], ["Chris A.", "Ding - Ding - Ding, we have a winner.It seems you can't go 2 weeks without some new Japanese restaurant opening up here in the River City. Wait, shouldn't the city have a river if it claims to be \"River City?\" But I digress...For the sake of full disclosure, I will inform you that I lived in Japan for just shy of a decade and am happily married to a Japanese woman. That being said, we've been to more than a few Japanese restaurants in San Antonio as well as ever place we have travelled. While I tend to be satisfied with any food that is tasty, even if it isn't \"authentic,\" but my wife, well, she's a bit more of a hard ass when it comes to those restaurants claiming authenticity.As you might presume from my opening line, the fight is over and Tokyo Inn is the winner in the authentic Japanese restaurant category. I do not mean to imply that there aren't any Americanized dishes, there are, but that if you order proper Japanese items from the menu, you will get authentic Japanese food - or at least as close as we've ever come here in San Antonio.OK, so yeah, the place looks dumpy on the outside and the inside is only marginally better. If this scares you away, that's too bad because you're going to miss a great meal. The d\u00e9cor is like something you would find in a lounge at a Holiday Inn just off the interstate in 1974. A bit tacky with some fabric missing, or more likely just worn through, on the chairs but again, you're there for the food.Upon being seated, we were offered a hot, rolled towel known as oshibori in Japan. The towel of course is to clean your hands. No other Japanese restaurant we have been to offers oshibori. After that we were given otoshi (aka kobachi) which is basically an appetizer for every customer. Our otoshi was sunomono which is thinly sliced baby cucumbers marinated with vinegar and sugar. So simple, yet so easy to screw up. We also ate their karage (fried chicken). Now they do theirs on the bone which is a little different from the style where I lived in Japan but not uncommon in other regions. Both the dishes were done very well.I ordered the Tempura Dinner which consisted of jumbo shrimps, kabocha (pumpkin), onion (like onion ring), shungiku (small green leaf), green bell peppers, green beans, eggplant, and kakiage (think shoestring French fries but made from carrots. I was impressed with not only the taste and authenticity but also the volume of the dish. Great stuff.My wife ordered the churashi-zushi and loved it. Unlike the other guys, Tokyo Inn doesn't give you 2 inches of rice on the bottom in order to make the bowl look full of fish. The dish was very artfully prepared and even had real crab in it. All the fish, shrimp, eka (squid), tako (octopus), ikura (fish eggs) were very tasty. She ordered the small size and for her that was enough. She's a bit of a light eater so you might want the larger size.So if you're looking for a more authentic Japanese dining experience, Tokyo Inn should be your first choice. Whether you sit at the sushi bar, table, or zashiki (on the floor with tatami mats), you'll get some good Japanese eats here. My Japanese wife highly recommends it, as do I."], ["Vanessa O.", "Was taken here for my birthday last year and it was one my most memorable birthday dinners yet! We decided to sit in the dining room with traditional Japanese dining, shoes removed and sat on the floor. Turns out our waiter was the owner! He was so amazing with giving us the most detailed answers to all our questions. Even though SATX is no where near the coast this was by far some of the freshest sushi I have had by far. The outside of the establishment does not even compare to the experience you get inside.

Feeling quite the contrary after this place.Food: Listen, those of you who want that wide selection of crazy combinations of rolls, proceed elsewhere. Niki's isn't that sushi place. They serve raw fish, if you want it and only it rolled in seaweed or sticky rice, go ahead, that's your prerogative. If you want to eat delicious, authentic Japanese and sit traditionally, that's also an option here. So freakin' cool. I loved every piece of raw fish, even the ones I knew not what they were. Miso soup? BEST damn miso ever. I eat miso soup everywhere...it's like my pho/mushroom fetish...if they've got it I'm eating it. Veggie tempura? HUGE. Delicious. They even fried up some chrysanthemum from the garden...wow!!!Experience: Niki's seems a bit sketchy on the outside. When I figured out where the front door was and walked in, place was packed. Everyone having a great time. You know why? The service here is awesome. Girls at the sushi bar were smiling and laughing, our waiter, Niki's son by the way, served the entire restaurant with ease.

If you want the authentic feel of a Japanese restaurant as well as good prices, I advise you stop by."], ["V T.", "Absolutely fantastic! \u00a0We were a party of three and shared two 10-course dinners and a sashimi dinner. The portions were a great size and I even took some sukiyaki home.The service was a little slow, but the food was worth the wait. The tempura was fresh as was the sashimi. I will definitely be back for Japanese food at such affordable prices and quality."], ["Alex H.", "Amazing! As other reviewers mention do not be discouraged by the exterior appearance. The staff is welcoming and helpful. The food is simply awesome. Definitely going to head back soon."], ["Christina B.", "Normally, I wouldn't give a 5-star review for such a shady-looking restaurant, but I will allow it for its \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel. And, once inside, I did not feel as apprehensive about the quality of the fish I would be eating.The owner is silly, and will probably joke around with you a bit.The menu is mostly straight up sashimi, soups, bento, yakisoba, and tempura (I went with a group and tried it all; it was all fantastic).If you are looking for a bunch of different house sushi rolls, this isn't the place for you... try Sushihana.The sake was also delicious. ;)"], ["Brenna M.", "From the outside, this didn't look like a place I wanted to get sushi from. But I decided to be adventurous and go ahead. Inside is much more charming. It's very cozy and lovely. First you're given the option to dine \"western style\" or Japanese style. We sat at the bar on the \"western\" side but we'll try the Japanese section next time, you have to take off your shoes to go on that side of the restaurant. The sushi here is very traditional Japanese sushi, so don't come here thinking you're gonna get a modern westernized roll like you would at most popular sushi joints. That being said, the fish is delicious and very fresh. The ramen is really tasty, best I've found in San Antonio.The menu is full of traditional Japanese dishes, sushi is a mere fraction of it all, so we look forward to coming here again and trying more!"], ["Dakota S.", "Let me start by saying that sushi is my favorite food. It ranges from beautifully simple to excitingly creative, and it is a food where quality is of the utmost importance. With that said, I can claim with no doubt that Niki's has not only proven itself the best sushi place I've had in Texas, but my all-time favorite place to go for sushi. While they don't have the excitingly creative side of rolls (those crazy combinations of sauces and bright colors you see at more non-traditional places), they take beautifully simple to a whole new level. We went later at night on a recommendation from a friend, and were told it didn't quite look safe from the outside. The white wall and permanent marker hours sign were completely the opposite in atmosphere to the inside of the establishment. We went with the traditional seating, which had a warm and relaxing feeling to it. Perusing through the menu, we picked out a sushi dinner special, Anago (sea eel), and Uni (sea urchin). Additionally I ordered a pint of Asahi, which seemed excellently priced.The dinner was a lot more good than we were expecting, and the quality was out of this world. The rice and meat were perfectly balanced, and there was good variety too. The salmon roe was delicious, and the tuna was some of the best I've had.The Anago was incredible itself: perfectly seasoned and the sauce had to be made from scratch it was so good. But what really blew me away was the Uni. Sea urchin is one of those things that can be really good, or really really bad. At the last place I tried it, I got the latter. But never one to be discouraged, I ordered it and will never regret it. It was sweet, full of flavor, and practically melts in your mouth. If you like to try new things, the Uni here is a must.Finally we eded our meal with green tea mochi ice cream balls. The doughy coating was perfect in consistency and the ice cream itself was wonderful.I really cannot say enough good things about this place. I may live an hour and a half away, but Niki's has won itself a lifetime customer with that meal."], ["Angela W.", "This place is definitely the real deal. As a sushi fanatic from Houston, I always raise an eyebrow when I walk into sushi restaurants in san antonio. I've had my fair share of sushi in Austin, Houston and San Antonio. And I can honestly say this is probably the best traditional japanese sushi restaurant i've ever had. This family owned restaurant might seem quite shafty on the outside, but I find that's what makes it so intimate when I walk in. I always sit at the sushi bar when I come eat at Niki's. The owner crafts each of the sushi plate with so much grace, it almost makes me feel like I'm eating at a friend's mom's house.We always get the sashimi dinner (5/5), the portion is so generous (we usually split it between the two of us) and the price is great for what you get. If you try asking what's in the sashimi platter, your waiter might tell you that they don't know. This is because the owner creates the plate as they go, and every time you come in it could be very different. A must-have is definitely their chopped scallop handroll (5/5). There is no way I can describe how good it is, you just have to try it for yourself. This is definitely by far the best sushi restaurant in San Antonio, and probably even one of the top sushi restaurants in Texas."], ["Larry T.", "Best Sushi and Japanese food in San Antonio. Pricey but worth it in portion size and food quality."], ["Kelsey L.", "This is the BEST Japanese food I've found in San Antonio. It goes beyond sushi - although the sushi is also excellent. The seafood is fresh and expertly prepared. The tempura is crispy and delicious. The miso is real miso, not something out of a box. It looks super sketchy from the outside, but trust me, this place is absolutely fantastic. Great customer service as well, very friendly and welcoming atmosphere."], ["Kristina C.", "If you want deliciously fresh and authentic Japanese food, this is definitely the place to go. This is my first yelp review because this place is worth the applause. The outside looks pretty shady but the restaurant is nicely decorated inside. One of the many highlights is their traditional Japanese seating. So far everything I've tried including the ramen + broth, vegetable tempura, and chirashi bowl have been superb. The employees are extremely friendly. If you have a party of 6 or more, I recommend making a reservation so you won't have to wait long, but mostly for courtesy sake. Enjoy!"], ["Aly K.", "Me and my mother decided we wanted to try a nice Japanese style dinner it look great on the inside, but the service was horrible right when we walked in we were interrogated by the manager. He was rude, and very sarcastic. I don't like eating at places where they make me feel like an idiot! No one would. I will never eat there nor will I waste my money. Service is what brings the customers back! I'd rather eat at subway than dealing with a crappy sarcastic manager acting as if I know nothing about the Japanese culture!"], ["Brett O.", "When my wife and I drove up to the restaurant we though\"what have we got ourselves into\" this place is a HOLE IN THE WALL. \u00a0But YOLO a we went in anyways and oh boy was it worth it. The staff was very friendly and informative. The found was delicious. We will definitely be coming back regularly!"], ["Janet L.", "Out of all of the Japanese restaurants that I've tried in San Antonio, this probably leans towards the more traditional style of sushi, as in they do not make \"Spider Rolls\" or \"Shaggy Dog\" or whatever.When you are looking for this restaurant, be careful because there isn't a huge sign out front telling you that you're there. It's a small restaurant with Japanese style seating, regular table and chairs, as well as seating by the sushi bar. They also offer these foldable seats that you can sit on with a back to it, so if you aren't comfortable sitting on the floor with no back support, you can request for one of those foldable seats.The food is really good and really fresh in my opinion. There's a wide variety of food to choose from. I don't really recall the name of the dish that I got, but it was a mix of different nigiri, a few sashimi pieces, and a few rolls. Some friends of mine ordered the chirashi bowl, the yakisoba, and some other rolls. We were all pleased with what we ordered.Definitely give Niki's a try!"], ["Jes\u00fas L.", "The food was delicious from appetizer to dessert. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great. Love this place"], ["D W.", "I would l love to give this place a five star review but the ambience is sorely lacking. This place looks like it hasn't been renovated since the 1980s if not 1970s.That said, the sushi was quite good. This place is pretty authentic. You won't find a whole lot of rolls. \u00a0You won't find cream cheese or shrimp tempura as an ingredient in what rolls they do have. They don't serve sake (raw salmon) because none of their fish is frozen and is really fresh."], ["Derek S.", "We came here in hope of some good sushi and were pleased. We ordered from their miso soup, which had more tofu than normal and was tasty to the scallop, spicy scallop, tako, eel and yellowtail with chive makis. All were delicious and fresh which is the most important thing and the menu reflecting no tempura was a nice reprieve from the norm as well. The only down side was the lack of specialty rolls but it seems that the goal of the place is to keep it traditional. Floor seating is available and the atmosphere is quaint. It gets a little loud but the service is fantastic. You get green tea with the meal and the waiter was extremely helpful. Would like to go again and try the other few rolls we didn't get."], ["Joanne T.", "I have been going to Niki's since I was in high school in the early 1970s. \u00a0Not much has changed in all that time; it's been good every time I go. \u00a0Although I'm half Japanese, I'm not a fan of sushi, so I know nothing of it. \u00a0We usually get the Family Dinner, and it's reliably tasty. \u00a0My Japanese mother prefers Niki's over any other Japanese restaurant in San Anotnio!"], ["Daniel K.", "The old classic. Doesn't get any better than this for authentic Japanese food and killer cold fish. These days we simply sit at the bar --my body can't handle sitting on the floor anymore. The food is always delightful. Lots of personality behind the sushi bar as well as from the wait staff. If you're lucky, Pat may share some of his unique humor with you."], ["Angel A.", "Great authentic food. the ONLY place in SA where eating lots of sashimi didn't start to trigger my gag reflex. I'm very sensitive to the freshness of seafood and theirs is top notch. The Japanese dinner is huge and delicious with soup, Japanese pickles, sashimi, rice, shrimp and veggie tempura, and yakitori."], ["Jhun B.", "I was impressed! At first sight of the place from the outside, you wonder if you want to continue to walk in but luckily when I got there, there were Asians walking in and out...when you see that...it's a good sign!The place is old but once you walk in, it's an entirely different story. You have the option to eat Japanese style (no shoes and sitting on the floor) or American (at a table or bar sitting on a chair). The ambience has a really good and authentic feel, nothing modern or complex...Just simple.The food was amazing! If not better than other places in town...the food was fresh and none of the fish dish we got had a scent of fish (you know what I mean!). My wife and I got the ten course ($18/person) and added the chirashi bowl. Other reviews I read spoke highly of the chirashi bowl and I was tempted to try it.... My God I was not disappointed! The bowl I'd different cuts of sushi /sashimi but not rolled into a roll..Instead they are on top of a bed of sushi rice. It was fresh and very good. The ten course is more than worth the $18/person. Only thing I didn't like was the chicken katsu...or at least that's what I think it was. Other wise...the fried fish, fried oyster, fried chicken drummet, sukiyaki, big plate of tempura veggies and prawns were good.In summary...I am going back!"], ["Jessica N.", "This place is great! I didn't really believe everyone's comment about it being a shack in the middle of the road, but it's literally a poorly labeled run down looking shack on an eclectic little street. HOWEVER it's awesome on the inside! I loved walking through the door to see a beautifully decorated (albeit homey) Japanese restaurant. \u00a0The sushi bar looked amazing and the place had the option of sitting Western (at a table or at the sushi bar) or Eastern style (sitting on pillows in a back room).My boyfriend and I wanted to try the Eastern style sitting and we loved it! There were lots of people there and many of them were Japanese, which is always a good sign. Our waitress was extremely polite and attentive as well.We ordered warm sake with our meal which involved splitting a bit warm bowl of ramen and a family dinner sampler which came with lovely miso soup, a variety of tempura vegetables and tempura shrimp, fried fish, and a rice dish. \u00a0This turned out to be more than enough food for us! I really liked the presentation of everything and the flavors were great. \u00a0Some of the dishes were a little on the salty side, though, and I felt like the dipping sauce for the tempura was a little different than I had imagined (this may be because I'd never had authentic dipping sauce! - who knows!).I would definitely recommend this place who wants a unique experience and some great Japanese food. \u00a0They also have some awesome looking sushi - perhaps next time around we'll try that!"], ["Joe R.", "Ramen was so-so.

So here are the pros:Once inside you are basically in the most authentic Japanese restaurant in San Antonio. Fujia comes to a close second. The sushi menu is straight forward sushi. No laundry list rolls with 8 ingredient \u00a0that may or may not be deep fried. Just straight forward sushi. Portions on the dinners are huge.Descent prices compared to local Japanese restaurants.Cons: Good luck finding the restaurant. There is no real signage saying \"hey...we are here\" Little parking. Have fun parking at the laundry mat in the strip mall next door.Sushi was served warm. \u00a0I have never had a slightly warm California roll ( I don't roll hard core, my seafood issues limit my sushiness. I go for my sushi devouring husband) the unagi was warm too. Again, in my experience not typical.The sushi rice is heavy on the vinegar.Dishes may not be what you are use to when they arrive. I ordered the kataksu and rice. It was in some kind of egg batter. It literally looked like they cooked the pork in scrambled egg. My husband got yakisoba. I ended up with his because I was not willing to try the moist egg pork. Sorry it looked wet and having texture issues it would have ended bad. Back to to yakisoba... It wasn't horrible. It was extremely salty. Like I ate about a third and my body said no more. We will not be returning for a round two. I'll head over to med center for my Japanese fix."], ["Stephen O.", "Hands down this is my favorite Japanese/sushi spot in all of San Antonio. We have been coming here for a few years and it is a hidden gem. We love sending people here because it never disappoints (unless you want cheesy cream cheese stuffed sushi rolls).

Be patient and eat traditional Japanese sashimi that is prepared fresh and presented beautiful."], ["Sunay P.", "You like sushi and you have not been to Niki's?? You must go! This was our admonishment by a few folks standing in line with us at the local dimsum joint. \u00a0We had been talking about food and the dearth of good sushi in San Antonio, and Niki's was proffered as the place to go for good sushi.So after many many moons we finally landed up in Niki's for an early dinner. This is a very divey looking place without any signage that I could see on Hildebrand and Blanco. \u00a0The entrance to this place is to the rear off the building and the inside is a very old fashioned but cozy. They interestingly have armchairs at the sushi bar and they also offer Japanese style seating. \u00a0We were seated at the L shaped bar by a very friendly waitress, and we right away noticed that the sushi chef was a woman. \u00a0This was a very interesting surprise to both of us. \u00a0One this we noticed is that all the staff are just super nice and absolutely pleasant.We were given hot towels to clean our hands and to refresh ourselves and a small bowl of tsunomono with bits of octopus. \u00a0This was definitely a nice touch to start the evening. \u00a0I personally found the salad a bit too sweet for my liking but I think most people in the city do prefer dressings to be on the sweet side since I have noticed this trend in most sushi places in town. \u00a0We ordered a spicy tuna handroll, Unagi, Saba, Giant clam, and Octopus for me, and the assorted vegetable hand roll plate with a side of kani for the wife. \u00a0The sushi took a little while in coming but then everything showed up in rapid succession. \u00a0The handrolls were a bit messy and a bit too big in my opinion and overall the nori was quite chewy but the spicy tuna tasted pretty good. \u00a0The vegetable handrolls were also a problem. \u00a0Chewy, too much rice which really smothered the veggies in the center. \u00a0The rice was a bit over seasoned for me. \u00a0It was a bit too sweet and sour for my taste and really masked the taste of the fish, with the exception of the mackerel which tasted great. \u00a0The sushi is rather large and is definitely a two bite piece. \u00a0The octopus was a bit chewy (and no that is not the texture always) and not very flavorful but the Giant clam was excellent. \u00a0This is all about texture, and the clam was served two ways and seasoned perfectly. \u00a0I also appreciated the honesty when I asked them for Toro. The chef told me that they only had kamatoro and not the prized otoro, so did not think that's what I wanted. \u00a0She also recommended the Uni, which was fabulous. \u00a0Fresh and sweet and worked well with the rice.Overall, not my the best in my rating, but pretty darn good compared to a few of the chains floating out there. \u00a0What I love about this place is the supreme friendliness of the family that runs the place and the staff. \u00a0The give you excellent service and that accounts for a lot more than people imagine. \u00a0I did make a second trip to confirm my sushi rating. \u00a0As in the first case, left feeling happy with the service and the smiles!"], ["H. Y.", "I would like to give it 4.5 even I am very satisfied with their food. I like their sashimi and handroll. The fishes are always fresh.

The building's sun-battered facade is a testament to the restaurant's status as the oldest and most beloved sushi bar in San Antonio. The energy here is focused on serving high-quality Japanese cuisine at a reasonable price, rather than on creating an atmosphere that would attract an image-conscious crowd less appreciative of the authenticity that sets Niki's apart from other, trendier sushi bars in town. *cough*Piranha Killer*cough, cough* Inside, the atmosphere resembles that of an unassuming and well-worn neighborhood sushi bar on the outskirts of Tokyo. The staff has an attitude to match: attentive and friendly, but not overbearing. In true Japanese style, you'll likely be brought a few extra delicious treats at the chef's discretion. The sushi is excellent, but don't overlook the other Japanese dishes. In particular, try the shoyu ramen. Many Americans think of ramen as \"college student food,\" but If you've never had authentic Japanese ramen, you are missing out. Niki's is a good place to try it."], ["Lovely R.", "Mixed feelings about this restaurant. At first service was horrible, as in let's leave because we haven't got our miso soup after 40 minutes!

This place seems to be as authentic as its gonna get in San Antonio. The environment is a very dimly lit house feel with private eating areas that require shoes off and sitting on the floor.

The establishment is in an inconspicuous building that we actually drove past. \u00a0We parked in the back lot and were greeted immediately. \u00a0I was impressed that we were seated so quickly at 8pm on a Friday night. \u00a0Despite being seated so quickly, service was otherwise very slow. \u00a0Our food was not served until 9:15pm. \u00a0The wait staff was very kind just so slow.Because the Japanese style dining is broken up into many rooms it was conducive to conversation. \u00a0We dined on the floor sans shoes. \u00a0I wasn't expecting this, but if you plan on going wear socks and remember this if you plan on wearing a dress or skirt."], ["Jennifer F.", "I've been looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant in San Antonio, and apparently not very hard since it took me WAY too long to find this place! I mean, as soon as I walked inside, my immediate reaction was \"where has this restaurant been all my life?!\" Whenever I rave about this place to my friends, the first thing I say to describe this place is that it feels like I'm stepping into a restaurant on some back alley in Japan. Just like what everyone else has said: the outside of the restaurant is very drab and nothing notable. There's pretty much nothing on the outside of the place to let you know that it's Niki's except for the sign. I personally, passed it twice. Once going down Hildebrand from I-10, then again when I turned around after my car icon on my GPS passed the location.... I literally stopped in a gas station to LOOK AROUND for the place -- lolThey have traditional style table settings where you sit down on a cushion on the floor, tables where you sit on the floor and the feet area is a hole below the table, and then western style tables and chairs. Not to mention the fantastic sushi bar right in the middle of the restaurant! I will definitely come with friends and enjoy our food on one of the tables with the \"foot hole\" (sorry, I don't know how else to call it) because they have these tables separated from the rest of the restaurant so it's very intimate! Now... on to the REAL reason why you're reading this... \"How's the food??\" The number one reason we were there: The Ramen! First reaction: wow that looks greasy... The broth was greasy -- you could tell because you can see it on the surface. It also came in a smaller bowl than I was hoping for. (I'm spoiled by my favorite Japanese restaurant in Houston, Nippon) The noodles were also disappointing: very mushy. My sister would've liked that but I do not. By the time I finished it, I was satisfied but I think it could have been MUCH better. I will not let this discourage me though! I plan on having another bowl the next time I go =) I'm optimistic like that. My boyfriend ordered the katsudon -- a favorite dish of ours. First reaction: man, I should've ordered that instead! It was really tasty! Honestly, it's been a while since we actually went there so I'm a little fuzzy on the presentation, but it was definitely delicious and you got a good-sized portion! They made it very well -- just how you'd expect the katsudon to be prepared. We also ended up getting an order of the shrimp tempura (the actual entree cuz we're pigs like that =P) It came with shrimp and vegetable tempura. We loved it! I devoured most of it, I'm not ashamed to admit it.I'm sorry other Yelpers weren't as taken with this place as I was, but I hope they'll come give this place a second chance!"], ["Michael C.", "It would be very much of an understatement to say that I am very very disappointed in this Japanese owned establishment. Started off with appetizer of vegetable tempura and I am already thinking what a ripoff this place must be. You would think vegetable prices should not be very high but $4.50 for a half-order, the portion is rediculosly small. For someone who came from Houston, I know quality sushi when I see, smell and taste it. This place isn't it. I don't care what the other review says. When compared to any sushi restaurants in Houston, this place just doesn't cut it. You can really tell from the Chirashi that not all the fish in this place is the freshest. To me, the basic 3 fishes of sushi can set apart the difference. The Salmon, Tuna, and Yellow-tail. Salmon is not fresh and it almost looks like smoked salmon. The Tuna and Yellow-tail were both average at best.Service was extremely slow and very lacking with no refill of the pot of hot green tea that was ordered. It took them nearly half an hour to bring out two unagi hand-rolls that are $5.00 each! Uhh can you say expensive?! The quality and quantity of the food just doesn't add up.On to the decor in this place. I understand that the mood is nice but Japanese styled sitting arrangement simply doesn't work. The floor reeks of dirty socks and atheletes foot. My girlfriend even told me how nasty the restroom is. Can someone call the health inspector on this place?If you're in San Antonio, do yourself a favor and visit Sapporo for sushi. You can be damn sure, I will not be back here again."], ["Taj C.", "WOW!! What an unexpected treat! This is definitely the kind of place only the locals know about. I am a Sushi fanatic & I fell in love. Honestly, I never would have stopped here, maybe even if a local had told me to go. The exterior is not appealing in any way, I probably wouldn't have even been able to find it as I wouldn't have recognized it. But, as the saying goes, it's what's on the inside that counts! First of all, shoes of as you come through the door. I didn't mind honoring the custom, although the floor was kind of icky on my bare feet. Solution: Bring Socks! I overlook this in my rating because the food & service more than made up for it.The a la carte sushi menu is priced about average for most places I've been, yet the pieces are 3 times as big as what you normally get! And it's so good! They don't have a long list of fancy rolls, only a few of the more traditional ones. And that is how I would best describe this place, traditional. Shoes off, sit on the floor, focus where it should be...on the FISH!!The service is great as well.

However, due to the glowing Yelp reviews, my friend and I gave it a try. Boy am I glad we did! After entering, the waitress asked for our seating preference (table, bar or Japanese style) and quickly sat us in the Japanese-style area of the restaurant: shoeless, with pillows on the floor around a candle-lit table. As far as the food goes, I had the chirashi ($16), which is essentially a bowl of sweet vinegar rice covered with various cuts of sushi-grade fish. I had no idea what it was when I ordered it, but now I may never try anything else! The fish was a little difficult to eat because it was cut in very large sections, but delicious nonetheless.Service was amazing. The young waitress was attentive and helpful with the menu (it isn't your typical American sushi restaurant menu, it's helpful to know your Japanese culinary terms!).

My friend also loves the grilled fish here. Aside from the food, the staff is also good, though I'll admit I had to get used to one of the cashier's straightforward personality. It's a family-run place so it's cozy, not too fancy, and the service reflects that style.

Some of the options arent for me, but what i did have was worthy of praise. The yakisoba was $9 for a huge portion of amazing noodles. Unlike most \"japanese\" food places that smother boiled noodles in a heavy sauce, these were light and flavorful with an amazing texture to them. No sauce floating on the plate, just perfectly seasoned noodles. Ive started having cravings for it whenever i look at another japanese menu my mind wonders to here.The tea is interesting, i think they put seaseme seeds in it? (according to my friends i shared with). I wasnt overly fond of the green tea ice cream as it was very strongly flavored (like matcha powder aftertaste), though this probably proves how use to sushi zushi ive become. I had the wonton puff appetizer but i wasnt overly fond of it as im sensitive to deep fried foods- my companions enjoyed it however and the sauce was a liquid kick of wasabi (& unknown flavor) goodness that made my mouth water for some sushi rolls to dip in it.

It opens at 5:30 PM on week days & longer hours on weekends. I am not sure if it's safe to walk in that area at night because it's a little bit rundown. 2) The place really needs some updates (The decor is fine but everything looks so worn out/old/rusty). 3) I've been there at least twice and the sushi chief didn't look very friendly.

The sushi was excellent as it was quite fresh and simple in its ingredients (no mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce, etc.). Being with native Japanese speakers, we tried some familiar items not exactly on the menu but worth asking about like nanbanzuke (fried whole fish with a vinegar and soy dressing topped with finely shredded carrots and daikon). Other items that were very authentic and not usually familiar to most included the yosenabe (seafood soup, large enough to feed four), sunomono (octopus and cucumber served with vinegar dressing), and horenso (spinach with bonito flakes and ginger).

Others slowly trickled in through the hour. I was worried if there would be enough time to order sushi, eat, and order seconds if needed. Much to our surprise, Godai was really quiet with maybe four tables through the whole happy hour. The wait staff were notified at opening we would have a large group, they all split the responsibilities of bringing us refills, sushi, and our orders. No one's glass was empty and they even made an awesome wine recommendation. The sushi itself was really great.

The miso soup was delicious and a perfect start to my meal. I was incredibly surprised with how fresh their tuna was. Everything was fresh and I definitely felt like I came out on top having only paid $11 for a sushi meal. My only issue, and it's a very minor one, is their eel sauce was more tangy than sweet.

Yes the neighborhood is sketchy but do you see the cars filled in the parking lot of this stand alone restaurant? Yes, people make there way to this establishment because its a fantastic place.

I went to Godai tonight with some friends for a birthday dinner, and had a great time there. The restaurant is in a kind of divey area, but is nice on the outside and warm and inviting on the inside. It was also packed at 8pm on the Friday after Thanksgiving, which is a good sign.The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and made us all feel very welcome. I started out with some edamame, which was cooked perfectly and well salted. That along with a Kirin black (yum!) and some sake helped my hunger while perusing the menu.The menu is mostly sushi and sashimi, with about a page of other dishes such as yakisoba, udon, and katsudon. I wanted to try the ramen, but was put off a bit by the description on the menu of the ingredients which were not authentic. So, I split the difference and ordered the tempura udon. The tempura was pretty good, nicely fried and a generous serving - the udon was served piping hot in a tasty broth. It also had some strange ingredients in it such as snow peas and mushrooms, which you would not find in authentic Japanese udon soup. The udon tasted good though, the noodles were a bit overcooked, but not in a way that spoiled the dish. \u00a0My dining companions had sushi and sashimi, and the fish looked fresh and is apparently sourced from Groomers, the only place to get fish in San Antonio. All in all, I think that Godai is a solid restaurant, about as good as it gets in San Antonio. Still searching for the perfect ramen though."], ["Ivanna H.", "I usually look for new sushi places on yelp and am generally happy with the turnout. This visit however left me disappointed. The food itself wasn't bad, but nothing memorable either. I've had better sushi from HEB tho -_-My biggest issue was the service. There were only about four other tables yet they couldn't have been any slower. Everything was just drawn out, even ordering water took several minutes.

Personally, out of the few rolls I tried, I really only enjoyed one of them. But I must say, the service is great and the ambiance is perfect for a casual night out with a few friends. I might also mention that their complimentary salad is delicious and that's mainly due to the dressing that they put on it. Lousiana roll - 3/5Cajun roll - 3/5Salmon roll w/ avocado - 4.5/5Asparagus roll - 2.5/5Beef Yakisoba - 3.5/5I found the Lousiana roll had too much sauce on top and the fried oyster was lost. As for the Asparagus roll and Cajun roll, it was just a bit on the bland side for me and the flavors didn't pull through. But thank you for the Salmon roll w/ avocado -- it's simple, traditional, and a delight to eat, my favorite. The beef Yakisoba had potential but the noodles fell on the dry side, but that's an easy fix and if corrected, can be a great dish."], ["Hannah K.", "Cute space. Easy parking.

I looked directly in front of them at their refrigerated cases and noticed the succulent fillets, what stood out most was the deep red of the tuna sitting next to a rosy-orange salmon. My wife opted for the sushi lunch and i chose a bento. that included tempura, sushi, a tuna roll a small sliced pork katsu and rice and stir fry veg. Everything was delicious.. We also had an order of gyoza which were ok,our son sure did like them.Our service was also impeccable, and the atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting.

(I am a food snob and super grateful to have found a grate place in San Antonio...but) the sushi rice here could be better. The flavor is great; no issues there. But I think the quality of rice could be better. I think they're using medium grain rice instead of short grain premium sushi rice. The difference is medium is a longer grain and better for cooking for items for hot foods, not tor sushi. The short grain, the rice is shorter and fatter and has a slightly fuller feel? I don't know how to describe it... My words are failing me. I only say this bc my parents own a sushi restaurant back home and we went thru a rice phase trying to find the cheapest but best quality rice. \u00a0But I get it, here, most people don't eat rice so they could care less and can't even tell the difference. :/ But even with not the best sushi rice, this place is by far...

We figured it was worth dealing with the heat and to be honest, it was not that bad at all.Soon we were ordering our food and the service was fantastic. Attentive and excellent attitude by our server. My wife even found some items that were not sushi. The three of us that loved sushi ordered four sushi rolls (different ones) and shared them. Delicious! Probably the best sushi I have had since leaving California. My wife got the Airline Chicken (Named that way because the chef said that bone-in chicken breast was a cut first developed for airline food though the dish tasted MUCH better than airline food).

The bam bam roll was $14 and the crazy mike was $16. I'm definitely not used to paying that much for special rolls- more like $10-12 usually for good quality ones in California. The rolls were nice and compact like they should be. Probably in my top two for sushi taste in San Antonio along with Yellowfish. The swirling shrimp appetizer was pretty delicious as well, but anything fried with spicy mayo and eel sauce I'm probably going to eat it. The restaurant is pretty clean, parking is convenient, and the ambiance is relatively nice. The service was pretty slow and it's pricey for what you get so that's why I have to dock a few stars.

Then the chef started his artistry there, on top of keeping a clean work station he was talented at creating his roll.The roll does not have a name nor is it on the menu. The chef was proud and rightfully so, his presentation and explanation showed is knowledge and passion for the profession.Now the roll, a thin sliced cucumber wrap, with crab meat and Escolar fish topped which was lightly cooked to keep juices in.

We didn't see much of him though which is my first complaint. Servers didn't stop by enough to check on our table. I ordered the moscato which was delicious. We also got lemonade and sake. Miso and edamame was ordered. Miso was definitely not the worst I've had but also far from the best. Flavor was lacking. Edamame was standard. We ordered egg fried rice. Literally all that was in there was egg. No carrot, no onion, no scallion. I make better fried rice at home (but I am pretty good at it to be fair). We ordered 5 rolls total but 4 different kinds. We had a fair variety of fish and styles. Everything was so bland! Rolls were lacking flavor and were extremely dry. Absolutely none of the rolls had any sauce. They might have been decent had there been moisture or flavor from a sauce. We walked away leaving over half of our rolls untouched.

Was it worth paying for lunch for leaving his ass in the car for an extra few minute unattended?

There is absolutely no excuse for that. I was a server for 2 years at a MUCH busier place and never took that long. Okay so then I made sure to order the Jalapenos Toreados BEFORE my food came out (which takes 30 minutes to come out) as I know it takes a while for them to grill jalapenos somehow. The server says okay sure it'll take about 5 minutes (well yeah, duh, that's why I'm ordering it WITH NO FOOD ON MY TABLE cause I want it when I get my food). So 10 minutes later our food comes out....no Jalapenos Toreados....10 minutes more we finally catch our waiter, who's too busy sucking up to the table next to us, and he just says well it takes a while to come out. And we said we asked about 15-20 mins ago and he literally says \"yeah boss, sorry, it takes about 5 minutes\"...um does he not know math? All he had to say was \"I'm so sorry about that, it should have only taken 5 minutes so let me go check on that for you since it's been a while\". But nope!Now I know this server had awesome potential. He was VERY friendly and he was even better to the table next to us. He literally stood and talked to them about the menu and refilled their waters with in seconds. He was so attentive to them but hardly even addressed us.

We got several rolls including an umai, which our waiter recommended after we ordered something similar. The spicy salmon was really good, and the shrimp, fatty salmon, and sea bass were all so fresh. The fatty salmon was like butter. What I have stuck in my mind the most I can't remember the name of. It had fried rice and crawfish and had batter on it. Yeah, cooked, but I'm not a sushi snob. Good is good, and that was DAMN GOOD.

Yes, the basic rolls are authentic but these suchi rolls on steroids, certainly are not. No avacado every made it's way into a real makizushi roll in Japan. And, all those toppings are an American bastardization of what a suchi roll actually is.OK, so now that that's done, let me say that I enjoyed my non-authentic makizushi at Sushihana. In particular, the New Orleans roll was quite tasty. We had them substitute and use the chopped crab (mixed with mayo) on top which I liked but my Japanese wife did not. The spicy tuna roll was not quite up to par, though. The tuna was absolutely mushy. The Salmon Avacado roll was pretty tasty despite, as previously mentioned, it not being authentic.We also had the edamame. My only complaint about the edamame was that the coarse sea salt they used was not evenly distributed to all layers of the edamame... Pity.We did not eat anything else so if we go there again, I'll definitely update my review. As for sushi in San Antonio, most places do a decent enought job at it.

It has big crispy tempura shrimp in it and I highly recommend it. \u00a0The place is very clean and even though people don't normally want to see staff cleaning while they're eating it was close to closing time.

Subsequent visits have been a letdown. Service and quality have deteriorated a little. There is really only one thing I absolutely love on the menu - mussels and salmon. Everything else is just ok and can be found cheaper elsewhere. Still, I would come here for the mussels and salmon. This is easily my favorite dish on the menu. The broth is creamy and rich. The mussels (when in season) are plump and swimming in the saffron broth. Once you finish the mussels, pour the sauce over the rice that comes with the dish. It's spectacular. My other favorite thing on the menu is the boat for 2. Everyone around he restaurant is impressed whenever someone orders a boat. It comes with plenty of food and is worth it. I would avoid the steaks. They are not that flavorful. Hand rolls are pretty boring and expensive. Ambience is pretty nice. It's in the quarry area so there is a lot to do after you eat."], ["Kristen C.", "The food was great! The sushi was exceptionally fresh tasting.

Each time I visit I always ask my husband to remind me what it was that we didn't like last time & we just shrug our shoulders.... I remember now after tonight's visit. First let me say the service was good. Our server was friendly & polite. It's the food. It's just ok. I inquired with our server today about this red sauce that each of our sushi rolls were topped with. Seemed like it was tomato based.... She said it was a KETCHUP based chili sauce. Ah yes... Ketchup on sushi. Not a fan. I like ketchup on fries... but not so much on sushi. It overpowered the roll. And the rolls didn't seem doused in it. But it was so strong & just didn't fit. Anyway.... Try the sushi...ask them to hold the ketchup."], ["Christine W.", "Service was a 3.. The server was spotty with checking on us and he gave us a dirty Togo box.Reviewing the Restaurant Week Dinner.. First... It was $35 for a 3 course meal. Including a light appetizer, an entree and dessert. Honestly, even though it was all delicious.. Most items we had were found on the menu.. So I could've had essentially a comparable dinner experience for less than $70 ( for 2 people) Now, for the food...for appetizers we had the Salmon Tar Tar and the Seared Peppered Tuna. The salmon Tartar was HUGE! It was kinda too big for an appetizer? Or maybe it had too much rice so it was FILLING, especially if it was an individual appetizer. The peppered tuna was the right portion and it was delicious! Cooked perfectly and full of flavor! Would order that off the regular menu any time. Dinner choices were saffron yellow curry muscles and salmon.. Which I barely touched from being full off the salmon tartar. This was one thing that was on the regular menu (minus the salmon.) from what I had it was super flavorful and rich and the salmon was cooked perfectly as well. Also had the Chefs creation, again... Could've come from the menu, it was still delicious. And the dessert... We got fried vanilla icecream which was wrapped in a cake-y thing. It was GOOD! Also the chocolate mousse, I would come back for it .Overall, good food, average service! Would still come back."], ["Inez G.", "It's my first time here and I got the chicken yaki udon.

Service came quickly for water and our order. I tried the crab cakes, that was tasty and fresh. It included some mangos, pineapples, which a splash of wasabi and possibly sirarcha or spicy ketchup. It was a good portion to be shared among three. The sushi came out fairly decently sized and with great presentation. I ordered off the happy hour menu, that was $2 per sushi and about $9 rolls. My only complaint was that the rice is slightly overly chewy and seemed a bit undercooked. Therefore, I would not give it a four star review. The flavor was on target and fresh. This place is definitely fusion food and I wouldn't recommend it to someone seeking authentic, simple sushi. It was pretty quiet when we came in around 5:30pm, but was bustling by 6:30pm. A great place for a couple or a group. Reminded me a lot of Kona Grill."], ["Kelsee M.", "Disclaimer: I was here a little under a year ago so it might have improved since then.I went here with my boyfriend for lunch once and haven't been back since. I didn't have a \"bad\" experience per se, but there was nothing about it that made me want to return. As someone else mentioned, a lot of the food is fried which is disappointing as I think a lot of people who are coming in for sushi want something light and refreshing. The food portions are small and pricey for what is average quality. H-E-B sushi is seriously just as good.On the plus side, it has a great atmosphere and vibe inside. It feels hip and like a pretty neat place to be. If you're more interested in being at a place with a cool environment and less worried about food, then you would probably find this place just fine."], ["Marisol S.", "The bento boxes are less than appealing.

I would've rated this 3 to 3.5 stars, but the management went the extra mile to reach out to me and offer another chance to change my experience. That deserves at least a 1/2 star upgrade.We had the shrimp tempura with vegetables, shrimp tempura maki, chicken teriyaki bento (for my non-sushi loving friend), and a chirashi for me. Everything was great until we got to the chirashi. Why ruin a chirashi's mound of rice with a brush of sour \"strawberry\" (??) jam? Each bite of rice was detestable. With the chirashi, I received farmed salmon, dyed and anemic-looking tuna, and some average-looking escolar...three each to be exact. I also got a limp piece of shrimp and a \"deconstructed\" piece of kani (fake crab). Maybe it's the sushi purist in me? Maybe it's the fact that I've been spoiled in the best sushi destinations around the world. Or maybe I just know when restaurants are being pretentious. I will never know. I'll leave the 4 stars up for my fellow Yelpers to judge for themselves. I'm sorry if it misleads you."], ["Chris A.", "Had it not had a Groupon I would have rated these guys just 1 star.Not much of anything was right with this meal. From the selection to the taste, it was just wrong. For starters, literally as I'm referring to the appetizer, you can't sell \"tempura\" shrimp that isn't tempura shrimp. It's just flat out false advertising. What you served is called fried shrimp (ebi fry - as the Japanese would say). As far as fried shrimp goes, it was ok. The highlight of the entire meal was the tempura asparagus. These little things were tasty but I'd have preferred larger pieces as these were tiny. The honey wasabi dipping sauce was good but could have used more wasabi.OK, so now we get to the meat of the issue and the reason for my displeasure. Piranha Killer Sushi has an entire page of \"specialty\" rolls but don't be fooled; all of these special rolls are basically the exact same roll with a very slight variation. I'd say 2/3s of the rolls are \"shrimp tempura\" rolls which really means they're fried shrimp rolls. Then, roll 1 has avocado AND cream cheese but roll 2 has just avocado. OK, so I'm oversimplifying things a bit to help you understand the point. Virtually all of their specialty rolls are the same thing with either X or Y added or subtracted. Not a lot of creativity.As for taste, the rice is supposed to have vinegar in it. Now many of you may not know that but it's true. The amount of vinegar isn't sufficient to impact the taste but it helps with the taste and texture of the rice. Speaking of rice, the nigiri sushi rice pieces were huge. My Japanese wife ended up throwing nearly half of each piece of rice away. The taste and texture was just not good. In addition, she stated that the fish itself was bland - no taste really, to use her words. Not sure this is typical as this was my first time here.In all, this place is a whole lot of sizzle and very little steak. It the presentation is nice, psychologically that could influence their judgment of the food. This food is worth a miss. So, if you're looking for sushi and you're nearby and it's rush hour and you just want to get home, kick off your shoes, open a beer or a bottle of wine and eat some sushi... well, I'd recommend extending your misery and going somewhere else. At Piranha Killer Sushi, you're paying a premium price for a lot of nothing."], ["Ryan B.", "This was my first time here and I had an awesome experience. We had a huge group of about 17, and even without a reservation, the staff easily and courteously accommodated us. The service was prompt and friendly throughout the evening.I ordered the pork and vegetable dumplings, a spicy tuna roll, and the Bullet speciality sushi roll. I'd highly recommend the Bullet, which had a great mix of flavor and spiciness without being overwhelming. The dumplings were pretty standard but the orange sauce was different and tasty. The spicy tuna roll left more to be desired, but it was still fine. They put a lot of sriracha sauce on top of it for the \"spicy\" which I think isn't as good as when they mix the tuna itself with spices. I didn't get any other sushi, so I can't really comment on it. However the fish I did have tasted very fresh.We just barely missed their happy hour specials, but even so, the prices were very fair. This place is also conveniently located next to a big movie theater (which is where my group was going), so you can just walk there after you eat. I'll definitely come back here when I'm craving Japanese food in San Antonio!"], ["Amber D.", "This place is really good.

Loved the vegetable tempura app"], ["Melissa M.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I were hanging around the quarry before taking him to the airport. I've seen Pirahna Killer Sushi around the area and had wanted to try it since the quarry generally has pretty good food. The interior was hip and contemporary in decoration. Our server was pretty attentive and came back on a regular basis.However, the rolls missed it for me and were pretty pricy even for happy hour. We ordered a lobster roll($15) and a forget me not roll ($9 happy hour price). They were essentially pretty similar and nothing awed me about either of them. For $15 you'd think the roll would be at least above average (although the lobster roll was slightly better than the forget me not). The fish on top of the forget me not didn't taste very fresh. They slather the bottom of both rolls with spicy mayo and a wasabi/mayo cream sauce. Both rolls didn't have much filling and were mostly rice. Honestly, I think sushi from HEB tastes slightly better and fresher. The only thing that was pretty good was the seared sesame ahi tuna appetizer. The price was reasonable/standard at $7 for happy hour. Not many of the sushi rolls appealed to me on the menu either. They had a few rolls incorporating fruit and I was looking for more savory and better options for a reasonable price. I looked for items that are pretty standard at other sushi restaurants on the West coast and couldn't find them. I was almost tempted to order the fried spicy tuna roll, but it was $14. I didn't get it though because I wasn't going to pay $14 for something that should be priced at most $7. Overall I give Pirahna Killer Sushi a two because I don't plan on going back. It's too pricy for the quality you get and there are a few other sushi places that are cheaper, more convenient, offer higher quality rolls, and have better menu options."], ["Wes F.", "I used to really like this place, but it keeps getting worse and worse. My last trip was a travesty, they couldn't get anything right. It was a Saturday night and even though it want busy, our appetizers were undercooked and the miso soup came out cold.

I've been lucky enough to experience the real deal in Japan several times. So, let's just say this... This place is hip. It's more your contemporary/fushion sushi. Most their rolls contain fried shrimp tempura. If you're looking for authentic Japanese food then this is definitely not the place for you. I did enjoy their dumplings though not served with your traditional dumpling sauce. They're good about presentation though, everything came out looking lovely. Now the Vietnamese summer roll was not very good. Maybe I'll try something different next time. I was just wanting a roll with more fish in it and thought the Vietnamese roll was a good choice. \u00a0Oh well. Service was decent. We sat in the bar area and though they weren't busy sometimes it was hard to get a hold of our waitress but when she did come by she was very nice.

We ordered the Wandering Poets sake, but neither of us had ever tried sake. The waiter said it was a nice choice and he was right. We were also brought water and our glasses were never more than half empty. All through the dinner we were asked if we needed anything. We had the dumpling appetizer, pan seared with sauce drizzled underneath, and they were delicious and perfectly cooked. After, we ordered a Dancing Eel roll, a Philadelphia roll and the salmon razor sashimi with jalape\u00f1os, cilantro and lime.

The Dancing Eel was also good with eel sauce on top.Overall a wonderful experience and we will be sure to return soon."], ["Andrew M.", "First time eating here and probably wouldn't come back. Mediocre food. Mediocre service. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. Sat outside to enjoy the weather but was disappointed at how somber the patio is. Not very clean or well kept. Tables were not wiped, floor was not swept, and tables were unsteady and wobbly. Seems the staff neglects this part of the restaurant. I tried the crab cakes, very bland and dense. Seemed like they were frozen. Wouldn't recommend. Ordered a miso soup but the waitress forgot it so we had to remind her. Then she told us they were making more so we canceled. Next we had the Spider, Lobster and Bullet rolls. None stood out, Bullet was the best one but that might be because of the ponzu and other sauces drizzled on it masking the actual flavor of the sushi. Again, nothing was terrible, and our server was nice but lacking in helping foster an enjoyable experience. Where's the \"Hi, have you been here before...let me tell you about our restaurant\" attitude. I don't blame the staff though, what's the incentive to aid your guests and make an experience top notch if no one provides one. Step it up management. To spend $60 on dinner for two, I'd much rather go someplace like Yellowfish. I wanted to like it here more because it's in a much nicer location and I could sit outside.

For a better sushi experience you should try HEB Central Market on Broadway.

The Marry Me Roll was great, I would go back just for the, but topped with crawfish. The crab cakes were ok, until I accidentally put wasabi on a bite. I hate too much wasabi on my food.

We had some jalape\u00f1o poppers and dumplings to start off and they were deliciously flavorful! I was indecisive when trying to choose the right sushi so my waitress had recommended the Chef's Creative special (something like that). When it came to me, I was in awe; it was a beautifully decorative and put together plate. It consisted of various fruits such as mango and strawberry inside the rolls, which created a perfect combo. In what looked like a martini glass, was crab and lettuce drenched in a delicious sauce topped with avocados. They had 3 pairs of different sashimi fish and many rolls topped with pico. \u00a0 I had never had such an extravagant sushi plate before, but I must say I was impressed. I will definitely come back, I am even planning to go for my birthday coming up. The back patio is the perfect spot, especially with amazing weather.

We ordered the potstickers with orange marmalade. They were delicious. I could have eaten those for the meal. For the entrees, my boyfriend got a lobster roll an was very happy with his choice. I am not the biggest fan of raw fish, but they were very accommodating and were fine substituting parts of the roll. Not all sushi places do that. The roll I ended up getting was fantastic. Would definitely come back to this restaurant"], ["Sandra T.", "4 stars because I ordered the seaweed salad and was not that excited about the strong balsamic vinegar smell (and I usually love balsamic), but it was just TOO strong. The Mauro and The Latino rolls were great. I would definitely come back :) the prices were ok for the quality of sushi :)"], ["Dianna N.", "I went here last year and it was the best chain of Piranha that I've been to. I'm surprised by the reviews on here, but maybe they switched chefs or something. The sushi melted in my mouth and everything was wonderful.

The drinks are just okay and the artwork/presentation of the food is amazing."], ["Austin C.", "Convenient location Piranha's strongest asset. Besides that, the food is average and the waitstaff/barstaff can be pretty apathetic. \u00a0The menu is ambitious but pretty bland.I tend to like more traditional interpretations of regional foods, however, so this might be just the place for you. I love sushi but Piranha seems to be more focused on creating a \"feel\" than on offering the customer a great meal. I would go back but mainly because of the location."], ["Michelle H.", "Created a Yelp profile just so I could share our dismal experience at Pirahana tonight. We walked in to find 4 people waiting and no hostess at the hostess stand. Tiny, cramped waiting area. We were seated after a 15 minute wait and were disappointed to see dirty floor - gobs of wet napkins, straw wrappers, crumbs. Our menus were dirty and had pen stains on the covers. The waitress serving us forgot that she had taken our order and came over to take it again. !?! The fried rice ($15.95) tasted like it was Hamburger Helper. The rolls were good, the best part of the experience. We were never offered drink refills or asked if we wanted or needed anything. The restaurant was out of forks.

Excellent food."], ["Bob N.", "What happened?! went to this place last night, the waitress had about 3 working brain cells and was straight out of the movie clueless. she had no idea what a \"draft beer\" was and struggled with the concept of bringing us a tall white ramekin of warm sake that any jerk off the street knows about from literally every other sushi place in existence. the edamame had no seasoning, the razor tuna had no sear, the rice was at least a week old and the cherry on the cake was the rainbow roll. everyone outside of a 3rd world hell hole knows what a GD rainbow roll is; tuna, avocado, salmon, shrimp. simple, elegant, delicious. the neck tattooed Mexican sushi chef (very authentic) tried to put some kind of weird grilled fish resembling chicken on top of my rainbow roll! WTF? we complained to the mindless waitress who got the very professional looking manager...NOT! that being said, I WILL NEVER RETURN! i asked if we could at least get one more sake and the waitress said that their sake machine was broken?!?! OK.... never mind then."], ["Anastasia U.", "WORST SUSHI I HAVE EVER EATEN, and I have been to over 35 states \u00a0in the US and had sushi in most of them. . I went b/c it was easy and we were in a hurry and people said they offered gluten free.Our waitress had no idea about the gluten free or what was gluten free or what had gluten in it, the list goes on. It was embarassing really. Service was horrible, I ended up asking the bar tender for more water b/c our waitress was no where to be found. Way to pricey for the food. I won't be back."], ["Stephen C.", "Yum-dilly-isious!I have been wanting to try this place since they first put up their sign a few months before they opened. Love the Piranha logo. After they opened I decided to wait \u00a0a bit and let the place settle ion and the newness to wear off. I went last night and am so glad I did. I sat at the sushi bar and my eye was immediately drawn to all the beautiful fresh product on display. It is fun watching the sushi chefs create works of art. Since this was my first visit I wanted to try some old familiars so as to be able to better judge the freshness and deliciousness of their offerings. I started with 6 simple pieces of sushi (fish and rice); albacore, salmon, squid, conch, octopus and tuna. All flavorful and fresh. The rice to fish ratio was amazing. The fish dominated and that is the way it should be. I then went on to round two; The Dancing Eel Roll and The Rainbow Roll. Both absolutely fantastic. The eel was cooked perfectly and rainbow rolls have always been a favorite of mine. A lot of the rolls have cream cheese as an ingredient, but if you request the rolls can be made without, thus making for a healthier option.They have two ceviches on the menu that the waiter highly recommended. Being a ceviche fan, I'll have to try one next time. (One is salmon and the other is escolar, and there are websites that say consuming 6 ounces or more of escolar fish can cause nasty tummy troubles). Very happy with my experience. Look forward to trying other things. San Antonio the Piranha is a keeper."], ["Sophie C.", "This is the most delicious sushi I have ever had. But then again, I have yet to try more sushi. But so far, this is my favorite sushi place. I tried some of their signature rolls... the bullet roll, lobster roll, chaca roll, dr. fran roll, and wasabi-crusted salmon roll. THEY WERE ALL DELICIOUS! I liked how they combined the different ingredients and flavors. I also like how they don't pack on the rice, but there's just a thin layer of rice, so i don't have to dip my roll in soy sauce and it's still a savory and tasteful bite. It is on the pricey side though. I'd say the average is about $11 per roll...but they give you 8-10 pieces per roll. You can just visit their website as they have their menu and prices listed there. I also got the fried banana rolls and ice cream for dessert. It was yummy, but not anything extraordinary unless you really really really like green tea ice cream. Theirs was pretty good. Our waitress was delightful as well! She was very friendly and attentive."], ["Elyse M.", "I went there with neutral expectations. I had seen the menu and knew that it was mostly a \"fusion\" type of place but decided to give it a try. Even though I had viewed the menu before, it took me a good 20 minutes to decide on something to eat. I was too fascinated(and horrified) by the many rolls that included cream cheese, mayonnaise, avaocado chipotle aiolis, serrano peppers, blah blah blah. I'm sorry but that is not sushi. That is BS. I finally settled on ordering the Sashimi appetizers and an eel roll. The sashimi was 9 pieces of tuna, salmon, and escolar. This is the only good thing I have to say about Piranha: the escolar was wonderful. It was fresh, the right cut, right temperature, and melted in your mouth. Additionally, it's not something you find on menus in San Antonio so that was a plus. The salmon and tuna were decent.The eel roll was laughable. I love unagi and this ranks as one of the easiest rolls to make (literally rice, unagi, and nori. Done.) And yet, they decided, for some unknown and baffling reason, to absolutely DRENCH it in eel sauce. I couldn't even pick up a piece without it collapsing into a mushy blob.When I went, the place was packed. The waitstaff held their own, making sure that dishes were getting run to tables. The hostess looked bored and sat us near the bar, kind of apathetically. Also, there was one Asian girl with kinda orange hair wandering around (maybe a floor manager? She was behind the bar at one point) who just gave off this really hostile vibe and loudly snapped at a server who was getting their drink order then proceeded to lecture them. As someone who used to serve, that set off alarms in my head because it was SO unprofessional and potentially humiliating for the server, since it was in plain sight/hearing of customers. Pull them aside and do that it the back, away from the customers. It was uncomfortable.All in all, I don't plan on eating there again. If you want REAL sushi, go to Tokyo Inn on Hildebrand. It's where people who really appreciate sushi go."], ["Fawn G.", "My coworker and I have been stalking Piranha Sushi for months. He rant and raved about this \"Marry Me Roll\" he had in Dallas. After months of anticipation, we decided to treat ourselves to lunch when it finally opened. Turns out they were only doing a soft opening in the evenings. So we went to Sushi Zushi and tried their strawberry roll which my coworker said was comparable to this dreamy \"marry me roll\".So now, Piranha is open for lunch and finally we get to taste the greatly anticipated best new sushi in town. Right away we C-line to wash our hands and was not greeted, barely noticed, could hardly make our way through the 5 employees blocking our path. That was odd. The one stall bathrooms were odd too. \u00a0Moving on, we had a delightful waitress, who was trying really hard to make our experience a pleasant one. We make our order. Naturally we had the Marry Me Roll, also tried the Sexy Roll and the Crunchy Tuna Roll popped out as a good selection. Right away I notice sushi chef Ariel of the \"Ariel's Special-Tongs Thai\" fame behind the bar and I get antsy. The rolls did not disappoint me. My coworker on the other hand was let down by the presentation of his sweet Marry Me Roll. The strawberries were strangely sliced, definitely NOT fresh and nothing like the photos or his previous experience. Our waitress kindly let us know the new sushi chefs were in training, naturally. I was still surprised such a well known chef would let something be such poorly presented. It tasted good and that's really all the mattered to me.We had another run in with some rude staff, guess they didn't have their happy juice that day. Although it was a major turn off, I won't let newby amateurs keep me from trying other items in the future. Happy hour, see you next week!"], ["Christa L.", "I love sushi!!!! But I go to HEB for it. Which begs the question, how in the world can someone who says \" I LOVE SUSHI.\" go to HEB for it. Well let me tell you why....None of my friends like it, I think the despise it to be exact. So lonely little me has not gone to a \"real\" sushi establishment ever. Hence, HEB.Well that time has come and gone, because I found a lunch friend at school who equally likes sushi. YAYYY!!! So why 4 stars, it's more of a somewhat one-sided opinion... this is the only sushi place I've been to. Now for the actual review.I got there around 11:30am and thought is this place even opened? Apparently it was, and judging from the servers standing around they were like, are we even opened yet?Our server was very attentive, having never experienced this before, it took forever for me to order. Then our server asked, are you really hungry? I figured sure we have 4 hours to kill before class. We got something called the \"the boat.\" Downside, you couldn't exchange the rolls for a signature daily roll. Upside, our server slipped the chef a couple of bills and had him add extra spice to it. It came with a whole \"boat\" of tantalizing options of raw protein. It was on the high side for lunch but it covered all the bases. I can't really give an opinion on the actual food, it was fresh and I didn't die. I wasn't fond of the cooked salmon on the Love Roll or something like that. I think next time I'll stroll in by myself and just sit at the bar or sushi counter and get a couple of personal rolls. One more thing,... WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE AVOCADO? \u00a0(sigh)"], ["America X.", "I'm defiantly going back! It was very good."], ["Stefany V.", "Restaurant itself is well-decorated, elegant and vaguely minimalist. I like the glass enclosure between the booths that is filled with sand- almost like a built-in terrarium. The glass and wood combo of furniture and windows is also pleasing.Service was awkward: came for an early lunch time and the hostess was on a personal call the whole time, sushi chefs were staring out the windows they were so bored yet my rolls were not rolled tightly and fell apart as I ate. Props for presentation though. The Dancing Eel roll was the favorite- I'm a huge eel fan, and this roll was tasty and savory, while the Marry Me roll, uniquely topped with strawberry slices, is more of a light, tropical flavor. I didn't care for the sweet green kiwi sauce. That being said, the sushi was good. The fish was fresh, which I was apprehensive about given their lack of traffic and the fact that most of their rolls seemed to have tempura-fried fish as a primary ingredient."], ["Dee R.", "Love, love this place.

Friendly environment"], ["Brett Z.", "First impression from the outside is good as the restaurant is in a trendy are. \u00a0Unfortunately, the experience went down from there. \u00a0The inside is a little too noisy even though there were not that many people there. \u00a0The music was way too loud. The wood floor was sticky and the tables, flooring and seating all looked worn. \u00a0The place had that smell that poorly cleaned American Chinese food places have. \u00a0The smell and the sticky floor are from rancid cooking oil that has volatilized while cooking and coated everything. This place needs a deep cleaning. \u00a0Now, as to the food. I'm not a fan of ruining classic pan fried dumplings with orange marmalade. They were also out of all but two of the dozen sakes listed on the menu. That seems like another sign of a poorly managed place. The Dr. Fran roll was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the individual pots of green tea. \u00a0The hamachi ceviche was spicy and tasty, and I enjoyed my miso soup, eel sashimi and albacore sashimi. \u00a0Overall, the run down feel really ruins an otherwise solid sushi place. I would give 2-1/2 stars but cannot bring myself to give three; sadly then only 2 stars for this diamond in the dirt. A little cleaning and polish could really bring this place back."], ["Jess G.", "Over-priced. There are better places around here with reasonable prices."], ["Michelle L.", "Take my review as is but I probably have a higher expectation of sushi and still haven't found a place in San Antonio I like. Happy hour prices are pretty good. Jalape\u00f1o popper appetizer was pretty tasty. I didn't really care for the roll options and most are pretty basic and have cream cheese which I think should be an option such as the Philadelphia roll but shouldn't be with everything. They have the basics like dragon and rainbow. Would like to have more like Godzilla or caterpillar which isn't that difficult to make.

I haven't got anything from here that I haven't liked yet. They have a good happy hour here from 4-7 and on certain weekdays it's until 10pm (I think Tuesday). The warm food I've tried here is pretty good though. I've tried: monkey balls- fried and slathered in spicy mayo. pretty good, but not my favorite thing here. Nabeyaki udon- \u00a0Best Japanese udon I've had in San Antonio and way better than the pho in SA. The broth is very flavorful and isn't too salty. The soup comes with plenty of veggies, chicken, and some tempura shrimp. The \u00a0portion is large and enough for two meals.bugolgi bibimbap- Best bibimbap I've had in San Antonio. Although, the meat isn't the most tender, it's very flavorful compared to other bugolgi I've had in SA. The portion of meat is just right for me and not too skimpy. The hot sauce it comes with is also very flavorful and I like to put quite a bit on. I don't think the bibimbap is the most authentic. The rice isn't crispy and it comes on the side, but that's not a high priority for me. They also mix in some seaweed salad which I don't think is standard, but I love seaweed salad. calamari- I thought it would be all calamari, but it's not. This dish is a mixture of calamari and veggie tempura. The calamari comes in thick big pieces. I still like this dish though: tasty fried goodness. Bang Bang roll- enjoyed it. pretty simple with tuna on top and eel sauce and some other stuff inside. Tuna tasted pretty fresh for San Antonio standards. (top 3 in town probably)Yakisoba beef noodles- 3/5. pretty standard. Good, but not amazing. A good variety of veggies and a lot of noodles. Beef could be more flavorful though.Service is usually pretty decent here and the food comes out in a reasonable time.

We sat at the bar and got to watch them make all the sushi rolls and sashimi. It was my first time eating sashimi, so I can't really rank flavor well, but it was good. I even tried octopus for the first time and it wasn't as bad as I thought! Sure, I made a face as if I just ate a rancid lemon but it was more because I kept thinking, \"I'm eating octopus!\" The bellagio roll was amazing! It had a mix of spice, sweet, and tang, mmm!

I had a male waiter who introduced himself to my family and I as, \"Abe.\" He had God awful service. My family and I had absolutely no knowledge of their sushi and he was the worst possible person to explain all the different options and choices that were presented in the menu. He literally sounded like a robot, as if programmed to repeat this non exhaustive list and then he would take a long deep breath after explaining a different section of the menu. Mind you he did this right in front of my family! \u00a0It was completely rude and uncalled for. To make matters worse, Abe forgot three different dishes I had ordered and we had canceled one, but he brought it out anyways (he said one of them was on the house because he never forgets to these kinds of things) But then there was a short Asian man who's name was, \"Billy\" this individual made my families experience a lot better. He saw me looking at him from a distance and immediately said, \"you need something sir? Talk to me, what can I get for you.\" This formed an instant pleasant feeling because my previous waiter was just that bad. Billy began to stay at our table and he even introduced himself to my family and we all began talking with him. As far as the sushi. Everything was downright amazing. I highly recommend the baked mussels and the jumbo volcano roll. Seaweed salad is also very tasty but the portion is rather small. Nonetheless, the quality of the food was great and Billy saved the day with his passionate service. He was so good I ended up leaving both of these gentlemen a tip."], ["Kelly W.", "Has a nice happy hour.

But it is absolutely delicious. For dessert I love the mochi balls. They're so yummy! Especially in mango and strawberry! Overall, delicious. I love it here"], ["Tommie B.", "Best sushi I've had!!!

I also love the complimentary miso soup and mini seaweed, cucumber and squid salad they give you upon arriving....My spicy crab was perfect. Spicy, sweet, with the crab perfectly coated in the tiny masago to give it that perfect crunch/pop texture with each mouthful of crab. What a perfect combination!After I was finished with my meal, they brought me two small scoops of a very delicious looking ice cream! Earl Grey maybe?

They were more than friendly the first night, but tonight felt like family. I saw this amazing dish on the counter and said, \"I don't know what that is, but I would like that\" and the chef smiled and went to work. Apparently it was one of his chef specials and so as he was making mine, showed the rest of the chefs how to make it. Then he set it on FI-ARE! and presented it to me. After a couple delish bites, he made some crazy sauce and suggested I dip my roll in it - yum!!! I had ordered the spicy crab salad as well so all together with the miso soup and seaweed salad (did I mention earlier they were complementary with the meal?!) I was too stuffed to finish so I asked for a box. The chef added more lettuce to my half eaten salad and prepared it all to go. \u00a0I am in love with this place! Queen for a night - I'll take it!!!

They have lunch specials which, on the menu says Mondays thru Fridays, but they tell you they changed it to everyday. So, woohoo! We had the red dragon roll which was just perfect in flavor. Even without dipping it in soy sauce, which in my opinion doesn't need it, the taste is fresh and just wonderful. I had the spicy chicken lunch which comes in a bento box, and it was a sight to behold. For less than $10, it was a huge portion! It had 4 crab rolls, salad, 4 pieces of tempura, then steamed rice and the spicy chicken. Wow! My honey had the chicken katsu which came in a bento box too and the same \u00a0sides as mine. With all that food, you don't need to have an appetizer but you should at least try it cause you won't regret it.

The sushi chefs are really nice and you get a free cucumber salad (sunomono) to start. I really like how many spicy options are on the menu.

The wine was reasonably priced and overall a decent list. The escolar, one of the BEST I have ever had...full of heavenly butterness; my house spicy tuna roll (think was $3.50-$4) was great. What made this experience extra special for me is the day before was my birthday, and was not treated well at another sushi restaurant. Actually treated rudely at the other restaurant. At Wasabi, I didn't mention my birthday and the owner poured (along with other ladies at the sushi bar) a comp glass of wine. And they ended our meal with \u00a0a lovely Dreamsicle type of dessert.

I ordered the caterpillar roll as a starter, so I was already nearly full by the time the bento came out. Still delicious as leftovers anyway. Now about the sushi: portion size was the proper diameter to fit my mouth. The rice was still warm (correct!) and the flavor was subtly sweet (also correct). The fish was not really present, but I blame that on the avocado and eel sauce that comes with a caterpillar roll. I'll have to choose something else next time to better judge the fish quality.

Your meal first begins with complementary soup and squid/seaweed salad; this is such a delight since one is \u00a0bound to spend a pretty buck when eating sushi.

Just a heads up, the fried calamari here is different than Kona Grill or Yardhouse. Great place to take your romantic partner!"], ["Luigi C.", "The Sides that Stole the ShowLets get straight to the point - I think this place has a lot of potential. The lunch specials are a great deal and comes with an unselfish amount of food. I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki and it came with a soup, rice, salad, and fried goodness. The tempura batter at Wasabi used to deep fry the shrimp and vegetables was definitely the highlight of my meal. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly. The batter retained its crunch and it was cooked to the right golden brown color. The flavor of the batter complimented the shrimp and the flavor of the shrimp was not lost. \u00a0Another highlight was the tempura fried Sweet potato. This is perfect balance and combination of salty and sweet! It was PERFECT. It was crunchy and tasted great. The tempura fried taro root/yam was also satisfying. Pretty much, anything that the Wasabi batter touches will be a delight to eat.As for my main entr\u00e9e, the Salmon Teriyaki - it was average. The salmon was a little on the dry side and a tougher than usual. Regardless, the flavor was there. I loved how they left the skin on the salmon which added salty-ness and texture to the dish. The teriyaki sauce on top was just the right amount and did not coat the salmon. The sauce definitely helped in adding moisture back to the salmon.I also tried the Bulgogi at Wasabi. Now, that was an utter disappointment. The texture was terrible. The pieces of meat were shredded too finely and looked more like a ground beef dish mixed with tiny pieces of veggies. As for the flavor, the ginger in the bulgogi was completely overwhelming. On top of that, the meat was dry and it lacked the proper amount green onions, white onions and \u00a0marinade sauce like in traditional bulgogi. Lastly, the color of the bulgogi was off-putting! It had a very light brown color and you could tell from a mile away it was going to be dry. Overall, I was a satisfied diner. I think if I had ordered the bulgogi, I would have been angry. As for the sushi, I did not get to try it. Definitely a reason for me to come back. I have tried the sushi before and from what I remember, it was enjoyable."], ["Zachary S.", "Sushi is very good, pleasant dining experience, generous sake pours, and the one caucasian employee makes a stellar pallet cleanser. \u00a0I give it a three due to them giving me the wrong carry out order. \u00a0How do you give me someone else's order? \u00a0Come on Wasabi."], ["David W.", "Very nice!

Wasabi always has fresh fish and good service. We love to sit at the bar, food comes quick and always tastes good."], ["Andrya S.", "Amazing!!! We are stuffed (with a to-go box to boot) and everything was phenomenal. First of all, they brought complimentary miso soup out, before we even ordered. The service was prompt, friendly and thorough. We ordered a combination meal to split that included salad (which they brought each of us, and had the best dressing I have ever had,) 7 pieces sushi (standard,) 7 pieces sashimi (really thick-cut, fresh, fantastic,) and two rolls of our choice from any of the chef's selections. I could not believe how huge the rolls were, and they were also fresh and perfect. One of them was the 'whatever' roll which the chef just makes you whatever he feels like, and it was spectacular... beautiful presentation too. Considering that we paid the same price for this meal, (with twice as much food and twice as much flavor,) as we did at the incredibly disappointing Sushi Zushi the other day (we left there hungry!) I would say the prices are extremely reasonable. I haven't had sushi like this since we lived in Alaska, and we will definitely be going out of our way to come back!!! Highly, highly recommended if you are looking for authentic amazing sushi at a great price with great service!"], ["Andi D.", "I've been to Wasabi several times for lunch.. and whenever I need some good sushi.. this plabce is top of mind. I went earlier this week and they recently changed their menu, so you can't get the bento box anymore, but that's the negative, but the positive is that you have a lot more options of sushi that you can get with the lunch deals. They have a great selection and the roles always taste good and fresh. The restaurant is always clean and quiet ... a great place to go and get away from the hustle in bustle if you're wanting to take 60 minutes for yourself over the lunch hour."], ["Katie S.", "HUGE portions of sushi...

You can definitely have dinner from the leftovers!I've also had a few other rolls, including the \"Sunset Roll\" and each item has fresh seafood!On my most recent visit I had the \"Vegan Roll\" which consisted of vegetables wrapped in cucumber.

It was average and I'm not sure I would be returning due to the quality and the prices.The store itself is not very big but when I visited on a Saturday night, it was pretty empty... You seat yourself and order at the desk once you're ready. I asked for tap water and the lady said that I had to buy bottle water and in an disapproving tone, said that \"it's only one dollar\". (WTF???) I asked for free water one more time and she hesitantly went to the back and got some. The workers were speaking in Chinese so I assume they are from Asia. You don't really get free water in Asia and I get that you wanna make profit... but this isn't Asia!!!!!!! And I'm not rich!!!!!!!! Ask for free water in a glass if you don't want to pay for the bottle water.My friend ordered the unagi (eel bowl) and I ordered some combo with 3 rolls. Nothing really impressed us, but like I mentioned earlier, the food did not make us frown in disgust. The fish didn't taste super fresh. The miso soup was bland.

For my meal:You get this lovely cucumber salad with your meal- that was a nice touch, but it turned out to be the most flavor that I got in their dishes :( The california roll was made with the shredded \"crab\" - hmmm. The crab was in a mayo sauce but the sauce was underwhelming & there was no flavor. The roll was also loosely rolled so it made using chopsticks a little difficulty. The spicy tuna was also lacking flavor- there was some heat but without the flavor it didn't really come together for me."], ["Asti H.", "I have been to sushiholic several times and been pleased every time. \u00a0Usually pick up though, so the lack of fountain drinks, as others have mentioned, I didn't notice. \u00a0Tasty food and generous portions for a reasonable price"], ["Drew C.", "I had shrimp tempura had it was okay.

We came on a Sunday afternoon and the service was so so so slow and it wasn't busy. We were like one of two tables. The cucumber salad they give you was really tasty and I appreciated the $2 Sapporo. The sushi was 2 rolls for $10 but they just weren't that good and the salmon they used tasted like smoked salmon not like sushi salmon which was weird and they used such small pieces of avocado in the rolls it just seemed like they were being cheap. Come on, avocados are under 50 cents at heb so I know you get them cheaper whole sale no need to be stingy. The miso was nice and had lots of seaweed and tofu. I'd have to really, really be craving sushi to bother coming here again. Especially since it was like $30 for lunch for 2 and didn't leave us feeling like our money was well spent."], ["Ashley J.", "This place has some of the best sushi I have ever had!

I ordered sushi combo A which had a super california roll with 5 pieces of sushi. The rice tasted dry, the fish was chewy, lacked flavor, and was an odd warm temperature.

My son remembered seeing this place so we decided to try it. My son is a genius! We walked in and saw the giant menu on the wall and noticed the tables each had menus as well. There were big letters at the counter that said \"order here\". We sat down at a table to give ourselves time to look at the menu. We then went to the counter and ordered. We ordered the FRY SHUMAI for an appetizer and the Roll Combo, which the menu stated was \"good for two\". The only drinks available were in an ice bin at the counter. There was bottled water, glass coke bottles, and green tea. We seated ourselves and it was not too long before our appetizer and sushi came out together. The FRY SHUMAI was really good but the wasabi in it was a surprise. It was not spicy to eat but the wasabi went straight to our sinuses....it was weird but we could not stop eating them!The Roll Combo was a Super Cali Roll, Special Salmon Roll, and Shrimp Tempura Roll. All of which were so good. The only sauce on the table was soy sauce but I didn't need any sauces because that fresh sushi was so very yummy all by itself.We will be sure to go back and we will even bring Dad next time. :)"], ["Brian G.", "1st visit and restaurant is very laid back and priced well. Staff is attentive and friendly.This time I had:Miso Soup - Good and flavorfulCucumber Salad - Great starter with a fresh taste. Not too sweet either.Las Vegas Roll - All cooked and crunchy texture. Sauce was food but didn't have too much flavor. Side salad the dish came with was good and had a tasty peanut dressing.Voodoo Roll - Paste like texture so its different. Dish is raw and labeled as \"spicy\" due to habanero tuna and spicy caviar. I didn't find any heat in mine which was disappointing.Bottom line so far? Sushi isn't anything special flavor wise but the fish is fresh. I will be coming back to try more items on and off the menu."], ["ContraBandit S.", "Not the best sushi I have ever had, but good for San Antonio. The menu is extensive, \u00a0and they have way more than what is posted. The employees are super nice. The rice seems to be regular rice (not sushi rice), so the texture is off on the sashimi a little. This place is a Texanized version of sushi, so you typically won't get the strong seaweed/fish taste. I think the rolls are overly sweet and would ask for no extra sauce/fanciness on them. I will try again and try a bunch more with a few requests. They seem happy to make whatever you want so long as they have the fish/eel/squid...whatever. I was a little upset about my unagi being a bit over warmed, didn't ruin the taste, but it may also be because it is hard to get really fresh fish inland. Prices are fair, maybe a little high. They are typical Asian with no soda fountain and do cans only. They do have an intensive selection of booze from Sapporo to hot sake(hopefully to be served in a square bowl)-gonna give it a try next timeMiso soup is seriously on point though. Go for \"happy hour\" when stuff in on sale and try it out."], ["Mindy L.", "I've been here twice now. It's pretty decent for sushi in this area of San Antonio.

We came around 2pm, and we were the only ones in there. It's small restaurant with about 7 tables plus the sushi bar. You order at the front where the menu is displayed on the wall.The food, DELISH! Everything looked and tasted very fresh. I had the Las Vegas Roll and my friend had the Shrimp Tempura Roll. All of the specials come with a salad which is also good. My only complaint is that the Shrimp Tempura Rolls cut was a little too large to handle with chopsticks, but nevertheless, it was delicious.Staff is friendly and thanked us for visiting. I'll be returning soon :)"], ["Ryan W.", "Reading the negative reviews might sway you from trying this place. Please don't let it. Go in knowing that your sushi experience is going to differ from that of a upscale eatery. This joint ain't that, and isn't isn't trying to be. Excellent roll options at an affordable price is what they offer and they are doing a mighty job of it. We had the Spicy Tuna, Crab and Spider rolls and all where great. Give it a try I'm sure you'll love it. Plus who can say no to free crab and cucumber salad. (That stuff is nice!)"], ["Melissa M.", "I frequent bandera pointe often, so I noticed that a new sushi joint was being built by panda express. There aren't many sushi options in the Helotes area, so I was eager to try this place as it's fairly close to where I live. I tried Sushiholic this week. I entered the restaurant and it had a nice, clean, modern and crisp look inside. The restaurant is small, just a few tables that can seat 2-4 people and the bar. The menu is up on the wall. I thought it was a bit awkward because the lady had to tell the guests to look at the menu and then order at the counter. It was a bit confusing for me as a new guest. You pay up at the front before you get your food, so you either have to leave a tip before you get your food or leave cash on the table. I came before 2pm and was hoping for some lunch specials. Unfortunately they don't really have any special deals for lunch. Most restaurants do. I ordered the tempura shrimp crunch roll. With your roll you get a cucumber and imitation crab salad. I didn't care for the cucumber salad, it was too sweet. You also get another salad on the plate with your roll which is more a traditional lettuce salad with some kind of Asian dressing. I thought that the salad on the plate tasted good. I wish they had an option of replacing the cucumber salad with miso soup instead of having two salads. The roll itself was pretty yummy and the ingredients tasted fresh. The concept was there and I'm so glad they don't stuff cream cheese inside every roll. However, like someone else said the tempura roll is cut way too big (as in the circular part is large). It is very hard to stuff the whole thing in your mouth without it getting messy. You get 5 pieces, which is a smaller portion than I've gotten at most sushi restaurants. So I'd say the food here is a little pricey for what you get. My food cost almost 9 bucks with tax, not including tip. I'd rather them serve a more compact roll and 8 pieces of sushi. The price for a california roll or a basic spicy tuna roll is 6.50. Most places charge 4-5 bucks for that. Not sure how many pieces you get for those rolls, but if it's only 5, it doesn't seem worth it. Finally the menu is pretty limited here. They mostly serve sushi. I wish they had bento boxes here. They don't even serve teriyaki here. They do serve pork katsu. It would be nice to have chicken katsu as well. The food came out pretty fast even though the restaurant seemed understaffed. There was only one waitress (probably the owner). I'm going to go back to try the sunshine roll. Hopefully the cuts aren't so big. Overall, I'll probably be back if I'm craving sushi and I happen to be in the area, but I don't think Sushiholic will be my top choice in San Antonio for Japanese. There are other restaurants with a much larger selection, better prices, and more for your \u00a0money. Sushiholic probably will have to tweak a few things since it's a new restaurant, so if it can make improvements it can easily become a 4 star sushi place. I think this place is worth a try, so I recommend you try it out for yourself."], ["Allie T.", "Great Mom & Pop sushi place. Its better than most of the sushi places we've been to in San Antonio. The fish is fresh & presentation is also great. My husband and I have eaten here three times already and would definitely recommend it for casual low key dining experience."], ["Billy C.", "Pretty darn good. I was a little leery because I'm usually not a huge sushi fan, and the prices seemed a little bit higher that I expected. However, my wife and I tried the Las Vegas roll and the Sunshine roll and both were delicious. Service was fast and very friendly."], ["Zabi H.", "I came here and it was a horrible experience. This place has the worst customer service. We asked for water, they said we only have bottled water and charged us for that. Any place that charges for water is a shady business to begin with. This wasn't a big deal but just think people should know. We sat down and looked at the menu, I was with my gf and ordered the Las Vegas roll and the house special roll. They brought out the house special roll first, the roll was pretty bland nothing that would make you go wow this is great. I finished that roll and they brought out the Vegas roll, this is where things went horribly wrong. As they brought out the Vegas roll, I thought I noticed the roll had cooked salmon in it and asked the elderly waitress that if the salmon in this roll was cooked because it clearly states on the menu it's fresh salmon not cooked. She replied yes, it's fresh salmon. So I took a bite of the first piece and I tasted the baked/cooked salmon which I found disgusting. I called the waitress over again and said, the roll said it was fresh salmon not cooked, she said no its fresh salmon that we cook. I said that's not what I wanted. \u00a0She then said maybe you wanted the sunshine roll, which had fresh salmon not cooked. I said yes, let me get that instead. She said you'll now have to pay for that as well as the Vegas roll. This is where I got upset. I told her that it clearly said fresh salmon on the menu for the Vegas roll but instead got baked salmon, and told her I spit out the one piece that tried of the Vegas roll that it was obviously not what I wanted. She said she needed to go talk to the owner (who looked to be her husband) to see if they can do anything. She came back a few minutes later and said that the part that said it came with fried tempura on the menu ment they were baking the salmon. I said this is horrible customer service, we are arguing over 7 dollars, clearly what I thought I ordered vs what I got was a disconnect and I told her this is one of the worst experiences I've had in customer service and I'll be sure to yelp about it and give you one star so people can see how shady this place is. The waitress said hold on let me get the owner. The owner comes out and starts yelling at me saying don't try to bribe us by giving us 1 star in front of everyone in the restuarant. It was very embarrassing and uncalled for. I told him, I'm not bribing you. I said, clearly this is horrible customer service that you aren't making any better by yelling at me so I'll be sure to yelp about this. Too often owners of restaurants think that they can act like a holes and that their actions won't go unnoticed. This forum (yelp) keeps them honest at times.FYI - the sushi roll that I did have (house special roll) was sub par. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!! Of this establishment. If I can give them 0 stars I would."], ["Elaine N.", "I did a great review based on taste but now after going several times it seems to me like pulling teeth when asking for free spicy mayo and sliced lemons. \u00a0Also I had placed a take out order and had 2 rolls which came with 2 cucumber salads. The 2nd time I had take out ordering the special 2 rolls for $10 they only gave me one cucumber salad. I went back in and asked why and she said thats the special and I said no because when we eat the special in the restaurant you give us 2 cucumber salads. \u00a0OMG!!! And you have to pay for water.

I guess it may be because they are just starting out that they may not have a good connect for there fish vendor. The fish is not bad nor is anything wrong with it except that it is not the high quality stuff. It is a little awkward that you have to order at the counter and then seat your self but that was not the deal breaker for me. Just as one of the other reviews points out, you get a little salad with each maki roll that you order; the problem is that it resembles a plain old house salad that you might get at an American restaurant (dry, limp iceberg lettuce and a squishy tomato) but its topped with some pseudo-Asian salad dressing. The wait is also very long and to sum it all up the sushi rolls taste just like the ones you get at HEB."], ["Roxy R.", "I was very disappointed.

We'll be back because the food was incredibly delicious! Definitely glad to find a solid Japanese place here in San Antonio.

I really appreciate that when I said \"blood sugar dropping\" he turned and ran to get some rice for my kid! It was awesome and made my heart melt!Tip: if you have precocious kids, ask to be seated by the grill. We did not, and my daughter spent the whole time sneaking over to check out the entertainment. (It can get a bit rowdy! Be prepared for a show!)Even with all of our personal distractions, the sushi took center stage! The menu is varied and the flavors were fantastic. This is one of those fun locals spots that tourists would enjoy! Great for the whole family; even better for a date!Again, a big THANK YOU to our awesome server, who never once got annoyed with my hyperactive child. He kept his calm through all the tough menu questions and childish demands (from Grandma). ;) We'll be back--but don't worry--we'll come alone!

The tea became bitter very quickly!"], ["Meg H.", "While it's not one of my favorite sushi places in town, I know I can count on a decent meal every time I come.The sushi rolls are good, with a decent variety of seafood and toppings. One of my favorites is the Godzilla roll. Deep fried crawfish, cream cheese and a bit of heat from jalapenos and hot sauce make this roll a treat.The lunch specials are a bargain. For $12 you can get a Bento box which includes two rolls from a designated list, a small salad, your choice of Miso or Osaka soup, two Gyoza, and an orange.

Eat their sushi, eat any of their food, but do not do their hibachi thing. We did it once before, about 4 years ago and it was good, the same old thing that you get at any hibachi grill. BUT, the other day we went in for Valentine's Day. We decided to eat at the grill because we knew it would entertain our toddler long enough to really enjoy our meal. We sat with two other families, both with single parents and a kid. Our chef was a total dick. Not only did he ask where the little girl's dad was (which was super awkward for EVERYONE at the table, not just the little girl and her wonderful mother), but he purposefully hit the lady in the face with egg multiple times. The other little girl at the table asked politely if he wouldn't put any rice on her plate but he did it anyway. Twice. And then he called her a crybaby and said she was picky. He kept saying, \"If you don't like me, I don't care,\" he was so rude, I can't imagine why they keep him around. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to drop $100 on a meal (which is what you do if you eat at the grill), then I don't need the chef questioning my life choices and being hateful to my kids. I'm giving this place 4 stars because we love it there. The other staff have always been super nice, giving great service, very sweet and knowledgable about the menu.

They recently revamped the menu and took off all but one veggi choice, which was sad to hear about. However, the waitress asked the sushi chefs to recreate the old dish for me to my surprise. I ordered the magic mountain which is the only veggi one left, and the spicy Hawaii roll which they had to recreate. Both were pretty excellent, although the siracha on the second blew my mind. It was pretty f'ing hot.. Haha.

We both thought that the rice was at least a day old it was so dry that none of the rice grains actually clumped together. \u00a0The entrees themselves were just okay at best. \u00a0Definitely lacking in flavor. \u00a0I would have much rather saved ourselves $60+ and eaten at home.Do yourself a favor and seriously just head across the street to Central Market HEB where they have way better sushi for half the price!"], ["Steve A.", "I'm not a big fan of Osaka's schtick, but my mother loves this place so we go there on occasion.

Looking around, and at my family, plenty of other folks seemed to enjoy it although the routine, as far as I can tell, hasn't changed much from this type of Benihana hibachi-styled restaurant. The food was decent. I always just get sushi rolls and they are better than average. My family seemed to enjoy the meal the chef prepared in front of them. I think they have pretty good lunch specials if you can make it in the day. \u00a0The service is what one would expect with a large party with gratuity already added: decent, but nothing to write home about.

And even those cost $6 or $8. I recommend going during Happy Hour, in order to get the bang for your buck. I enjoyed their sashimi salad appetizer best. Great mix of fish, octopus and seaweed salad with some vinaigrette mixed in. \u00a0If you don't feel like spending too much, it'd be a good option to get your seafood fix. I also ordered a chirashi bowl, and it had a great array of fish but they didn't taste particularly fresh. Unlike the sashimi salad, there was no sauce to hid the flavor. The rest of my party ordered rolls, and they were all pretty satisfied. None of them hit it out of the park for me though. NothSo the service was mediocre since our guy server that lacked enthusiasm. He seemed stressed the whole time, and hardly interacted with us as customers. The place wasn't even busy, so I can't really forgive his lack of hospitality.I'm just not a big fan of Osaka. Maybe people that go for the Hibachi service like it better. But if you know sushi like I do, it shouldn't be on anyone's hot spot lists."], ["Chelsea M.", "This review is only for the sushi in the restaurant. I really wanted to love Osaka because it seemed pretty popular, but it didn't impress me. The sushi was okay, prices are a little high, and service at our table was harder to handle. I'm going to try other sushi restaurants before returning.Many of the rolls were pretty basic, nothing outside my comfort zone. I get disappointed when I see California rolls and lots of spicy tuna, so I was craving other combinations. My friend ordered one roll that I really liked, Cowboy or Tiger something, but that was all. Our waitress was pushy for us to decide. I could only snag one water/wine refill when she returned food, at one point someone in my party got up to ask for service.

The miso soup was well done and had good balance and flavor. The tempura shrimp was a bit below expectations. \u00a0The shrimp was not cleaned and the coating was closer to KFC than a light and delicate tempura crust.Tried the \"midori\" cucumber wrapped roll. \u00a0The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was good. \u00a0The rolls could have been made better so that they did not fall appart when picking up with chopsticks.The steak was well cooked, but was not cut fully. \u00a0 Overall not a big deal, \u00a0just details.

We sat for nearly ten minutes as waiter after waiter walked right past us; a few of them would make eye contact with us and keep walking.We finally nabbed a waiter, got our drinks, and ordered our sushi. This was to include Miso soup which we had to ask for, and the waiter's response was, \"Oh, you want that?\" Yes, we want the soup we ordered and paid for.We ended up tipping the sushi chefs and not our waiter.

The major bummer was finding out that all the rolls we normally would get (dragon, rainbow, caterpillar, etc.) ended up being an extra $2.50 per roll. They've still got the 3 for $20, but now there's the option of 2 for $15, so we each did that. The sushi is still as good as ever; it just sucked going in there anticipating one thing and then being let down. It's totally understandable why they changed it though.Also, I wouldn't come here if you're on a time crunch or anything. It tends to be a little busy during happy hour.

Upon walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the seating variety, though it is importan to note that no one was utilizing the hibachi area while I was there- other reviewers have said it gets too loud/distracting for the open floor plan and disturbs other patrons, and I can see how that oculd be the case but didn't experience it myself. Took advantage of the 3/$20 happy hour and ordered the dragon, caterpillar, and rainbow rolls. My date is also a huge sushi fan, so he ordered three different rolls and we planned to stuff our faces. I think he ordered the spider, tiger, and eel rolls, and we had the monkey brain appetizer per everyone's reviws.Overall the food was tasty and I liked the pricing, but the downside to my experience was the timing- see below. We walked in at 5:46 and were seated and brought drinks, lingered over menu til about 6:05 but didn't even receive the monkey brain appetizer until 6:45, at which point I assumed it was being brought with out rolls. No such luck.Rolls were brought out around 7:05 making for nearly an hour wait. For the price and the fact that I was engaged in conversation the whole time, I didn't mind too much, but the restaurant itself wasn't particularly busy (2 couples at bar, two tables, two booths of couples) and there were at least two chefs working behind the counter at all times, possibly three at one point. In any case, the monkey brain was tasty but not as amazing as the reviews had led me to believe. I probably wouldn't spend the $7 on it again, and try the gyoza next time instead. I tried at least one piece of every roll, and we cleaned our plates, and I have ot say that everything tasted just right nad above all, fresh! I think I may have consumed over an entire avocado given the rolls we selected, but I liked what I ordered and the presentation was nice, too.

Just a little too inattentive for me to rave about it. Had to ask for wasabi & ginger; for me, these things are customary accompaniments. Also, ordered a pot of green tea.

This cunning little place is definitely a hole in the wall & I am HOOKED. The \"japamex\" concept is very different, but it works! This may be a silly little thing, but the littlest things make me happy - I love when sushi places have only \"low sodium\" soy sauce :)- Mexican tartare!! (5/5): It is so fresh & you get to decide between tuna and salmon. I ordered my favorite - salmon! I LOVE the tangy salsa roja sauce that it's married in. I only wish they served it with won ton chips rather than saltine crackers.- Mussel TNT (5/5): Sooo creamy & it doesn't have that fishy smell. Its twist is the picante mayo. The mussels aren't chopped finely but in 3-4 pieces. It's plump & tastier that way!- Urbano Roll (4/5): Fried & saucyyy. Such a yummy roll - tempura shrimp, avocado, & cream cheese with their picante mayo. Everything just melts so perfectly.- Chirashi Bowl (4/5): An assortment of fish that are all amazingly fresh. Our waitress was attentive & friendly. It's cute how the \"sushiologists\" greet you once you walk in. Check in & you get free miso soup! This place is a MUST GO every time I visit San Antonio & I'm so excited for my next trip."], ["Sandra R.", "Encouraged by the reviews, I went today for an early lunch. I had the Shirashi, miso soup and the eel taco. Pros: food is good, the location is fine, it is clean and welcoming, \u00a0very good service. Cons: they do not have brown rice as an option."], ["Casey L.", "Service so far is really good and the food has been even better. Haven't had sushi in a while glad we tried this place out today."], ["Jay B.", "The nigiri slices are generous. They have great nigiri combos that allow you to get a variety at a reasonable price. My only complaint is the up charge for exchanging out fish. If you sub salmon for tilapia or tilapia for salmon, for example, it's $2 either way.Prices are very average. Not the cheapest, but pretty close and great quality.The roll selection could be much better though."], ["Monica M.", "First off, I'm a sushi snob. \u00a0Not even going to deny that I am. I'm a nigiri and sashimi kind of girl. \u00a0I'm not big on rolls and I think that's what this place is all about. \u00a0Their nigiri and sashimi were very fresh though the selection of items on that part of the menu were very limited. We got the sashimi probadita which had salmon, yellowtail, tuna and octopus. \u00a0All items were very fresh. Their roll selection was very extensive. \u00a0We tried the baked crawfish and scallop rolls which were flavorful but a little too spicy for my taste.This is a tiny little restaurant. \u00a0The service was good, the atmosphere was very contemporary, and the fish was fresh. I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups though because I doubt they would fit but if you're looking for a quick sushi fix then why not check out this place. \u00a0If you're looking for a fancy sushi restaurant then... perhaps you should look elsewhere."], ["Kim T.", "When I first heard the term japamex I thought it was a little weird but this is one of favorite sushi restaurants in the city. It's closeby and quick. Order the marmol roll for a little spice and volcano scallops. I've also tried the salsa roja taco which is basically a spicy salmon handroll."], ["Diana R.", "I love love love yellowfish sushi. I can't believe I haven't already written a review. The staff is always super friendly, and they're a lot more efficient than when the place first opened. The food is amazing and tastes really fresh. A Couple of my fav rolls are the C roll and urbano roll, but I honestly haven't tried one I didn't like. Also, the japamex miso is one of the best things I've ever tasted idk how no one came up with a dish like that sooner."], ["Alysse S.", "I am extremely happy for Yellow Fish. Their awkward location has sustained and their service and quality is constant. Setting this sushi restaurant away from the others is that they embrace San Antonio with their Japamex options! They introduce flavors of picante, verde salsa, and \"tacos\". It's fun, creative, and a comfortable environment to try something different. Their miso soup is HEARTY, loads of tofu and seaweed, plus with a different robust flavor. You will love the enhanced taste which makes them different from the other places. You also should follow them on Instagram, they're always posting cool new options, and since I'm a visual kinda gal, I like to learn and make choices by pictures. Sometimes you have to ask twice for things; water refill, menu for to go order, wasabi. But despite those blips, I travel i10 again and again for the quality AND to enjoy my own wine. Yes, delicious food that allows you to bring your own beverage. It's hard to find gems like this."], ["Arren W.", "Great addition to the sushi choices in SA! It's a tex mex take on sushi which right away had me leery. I tried the Los Volcanos roll and haven't looked back. \u00a0Now I get it every time I go there. It's super tasty but my only feedback is that it's placing warm scallops, etc topping on a cold roll. I think it would be better to bake it all together. I normally go for lunch but if you would like wine or beer with dinner it's BYOB. Just bring some from home or swing in to the HEB at 10 & wurzbach to grab something. They always have soccer playing on the TVs and art from local artists on the walls which gives the place a more casual feel. Jeans and flip flops are ok here and I love that especially during the week when dressing up isn't on my priority list."], ["Rafa P.", "This place looks unattractive outside, but Please take the extra step inside, is worth it!! We take the sushi rolls suggestions from the Yelpers ( San Antonio, El Dorado, Volcano Crawfish) the 3 Rolls were well presented and deliciuos!.

I got the yellowtail roll and my gf got the dragon roll. Both fantastic! Service was great too."], ["Bridget W.", "Still love eating here. I've recently tried the chirashi bowls. SO GOOD & so much sushi-- only $14. This place is my go-to in the medical center. I decided to add a star just because it really is the best for sushi in this area. And it's always consistent. Friendly service. There are two small dining areas inside and a patio outside. If you're in a large group, there's limited options for seating especially if it gets busy.Drive thru is more recently active. So if you are picking up, you can just go through there. I've had delivery since too and it's still all delicious!"], ["Thao N.", "Honestly, I'm not a big sushi-fan. I've been to Tokyo and still did not become a sushi convert. When the boyfriend wants sushi (which is all the time), I would rather go to Yellowfish because the quality and freshness of the seafood is hard to beat. I really like the marisco soup and most of their sushi-taco hybrids. If you're super health conscious or just really like cucumbers, order the taco wraps and request cucumber wrap and not seafood. The place is a little on the pricier side but the quality is there. Cute atmosphere, a little cold so bring a sweater."], ["Mariana P.", "Do you want some amazing sushi and dont want to leave home??? No worries, Yellow Fish is here and will hand deliver to your door!! Today i ordered the urbani roll which is tempura heaven in your mouth! Want some soup and like spice, try the japamex miso soup!

Usually the servers are prompt and courteous, with one exception. I think the girl was new and hopefully was fired because she was terrible!

I would definitely recommend this place!"], ["Nikki S.", "We went here to celebrate my birthday and it was every bit as delicious as I had hoped. \u00a0Service was quick, helpful, and friendly. \u00a0The free miso with check in was really nice and it was tasty! \u00a0We ordered a couple rolls, the marmol and the C roll, and had a taco plate and picked philly, picante tuna, and salsa Roja Salmon. \u00a0The tacos (hand rolls) were really stuffed. \u00a0The filling was evenly distributed so there was no being left with just rice at the end. \u00a0Super yummy as well! \u00a0The marmol was a great example of the fusion. \u00a0I love spicy food, but if you can't handle spice I wouldn't recommend it. \u00a0It wasn't overpowering but it definitely had a kick. \u00a0The C roll was more what you might find at any sushi place but it was super tasty and flavorful. \u00a0We finished the meal with the platano tempura which was super yummy as well.Non food notes:Not a ton of parking but I would say adequate for the size of the place.It's bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. \u00a0We were a bit surprised.The menu is pretty sizable, it was hard to decide what get.In my opinion the prices were great for what we got.Really look forward to going again and trying more things off the menu."], ["Yuesheng L.", "I tried this place out by ordering on Yelp and picking up myself. Took about 20 minutes, which is not bad.I got the Chirashi bowl as recommended by most people, the San Antonio Roll and the Picante Salmon Taco. Portions are pretty good for the price and presentation was good too, even for togo. The Chirashi bowl was indeed good value and the San Antonio roll was pretty creative. We really enjoyed the meal.The only reason I am not giving a 5 star is that the sushi still taste a bit generic like those in other sushi restaurant in San Antonio and maybe the sushi togo place at HEB. It does not make us jump out the chair and think this is really great authentic sushi. But we will definitely come back for more."], ["Lyn F.", "Tried Yellow fish by the recommendation of other yelpers.

So where do I begin?Oh, the miso soup (yummy and free with Yelp check-in). Then my boyfriend and I ordered the seaweed salad (generous and sesame flavored), the Marmol roll (nice kick of heat, but definitely not too spicy) and the Chirashi bowl (the freshest ocean upon amazing sticky sushi rice).

The roll had a lot of potential. It's a pretty typical roll but with cilantro jalape\u00f1o and salsa to add a Mexican kick. I loved flavor profile but found that the salsa and jalape\u00f1o over powered the flavor of the sashimi. If the Mexican toppings were toned down a bit this roll would be a winner! Until then... I may try to order something different at my next visit. Sushi is supposed to be simple and delicate but these were far from it. They're bursting with flavor... A little too much flavor."], ["Bella-mous B.", "Found 2 bugs. The first one I tried to play it off and sent the plate back. The 2nd one was in the hot green tea... So gross .

It's very subtle. Glancing over the menu, nothing is overpriced for what it is. However, I didn't even bother looking at the cooked rolls because I ain't 'bout that. If it's cooked, it's not truly sushi!!! :)First off, service is amazing. When my boyfriend and I walked in we were happily greeted, and our server was really attentive and pleasant!I decided to get the taco plate which is basically your choice of 3 handrolls among a list of about 4-5 pre-picked handrolls, with no substitutions. I chose one picante salmon and two salsa roja salmon. My boyfriend ordered the chirashi which came with A LOT of fish. Both totally worth the money! I can't believe the prices! $10 for the taco plate (3 handrolls), and $14 for the chirashi. I loved my handrolls. The picante sauce is like a spicy mayo, while the salsa roja is like a spicy ponzu, and obviously not as creamy. But equally delicious. My boyfriend ate every bit of fish, crab, shrimp, all that was in that chirashi. And he doesn't even like shrimp haha! It also came with a little bit of seaweed salad in there and some avocado slices. Everything was fresh and tasted so, so, so, so, good. I'm definitely getting that chirashi next time.

This is sushi, good sushi (great sushi for Texas), with a Mexican cuisine twist. When you pull up you can see it is a converted fast food restaurant.

The Cow Boy roll is so good and it is so creatively put together! The last roll was the San Antonio roll and it too was very good. But didn't compare to the previous two I stated.

But some of my favorites here are the 1204 roll and the juma. Their chirashi bowl is such a great deal, especially with the amount of fresh fish they give you. The tuna here is just fantastic.

She wouldn't let me know where she was taking me because looks really can be deceiving. I'm from Houston too, where sushi is amazing already so I was very skeptical.

I loved them all to be honest. Especially the spicy mayo sauced ones. I DO NOT recommend the shrimp and crab Kani taco rolls. They are a rip off because the salmon and tuna ones are decked out with fish while the shrimp Kani roll had HALF a slice of shrimp and the crab one had HALF a piece of artificial crab.

I was inspired to go after a fellow social media person from another state had ramen. It looked so good that I got on Yelp and looked for a restaurant that served ramen. Kimura was the first choice on Yelp and after reading the latest reviews, I was convinced to try out Kimura. So on Friday I went to Kimura for my lunch break. First, I knew the place is a small location and probably seating was limited. When I arrived it took about 5 minutes or so to be seated. I sat right at the counter where the cooks were cook at. Then it took a 5 minutes or so to get a menu and get my order taken. The place was busy, so I knew I had to be patient. Everyone staff member was hustling and doing their best to take care of everyone. Being my first time there, I heard newbies would get the Miso Ramen. So, that's what I got. I wanted beef in my Miso but they had ran out. No biggie for me, I just asked for extra ramen. With that, I even ordered a bowl of Gohan aka Rice and a Orange Soda. While waiting for my Miso, I was brought my Orange Soda and it was awesome. It was homemade from what I believe yet it kind of tasted like Lemonade. The soda was really refreshing. After a while my Miso was brought to me and it smelled wonderful. I first tasted the soup and it has such a wonderful flavor. Next, I was mixing everything around the bowl and I dug right in. After my first taste, I can't believe how good my Miso was. I also mixed in some of the rice into the Miso. I was just amazed on how big the bowl was and the serving portion. While continuing to eat, I was enjoying the soda as well. The flavor and sweetness of the Orange Soda was just right to have with my meal. Overall, my first time experience eating at Kimura was excellent. Now, here are some observations or things you should know if you are a first timer to Kimura. 1st, expect to take more than an hour lunch break if you go during the lunch hour rush and if you work near by (I took an 1 1 1/2 for lunch). I walked from the Central Library area to the restaurant. 2nd, patience will have to be your friend if the place is packed. 3rd, the place is good for a single person going or a group of 3 people the most if you want to eat comfortably. 4th, it will take a few minutes for your waiter or waitress to get to you to get your drink order or food order because the place is busy. So, you must understand that. 5th, it takes time for your meal to be prepared and served to you but it's worth the wait. 6th, the Chef is good at telling his cooking staff what needs to be done or what plates need to be plated/prepared in the ordered that they were received. The Chef was also good at talking to customers and of he thinks that they have been waiting a while for either their order needs to be taken or talking with them while there meal is being prepared. 7th, my only concern was that the restaurant was a little warm inside, even when I was standing by the door to be seated but after seating at the counter next to the cooks, it got a little more warmer for me but I had to understand I was basically next to the kitchen area. 8th, my waitress Kelly \u00a0(I believe was her name) was nice and attended to me very well. Even when Kelly was attending to others next to me, she was very kind to them as well. Now, I'm not sure if things are different during the evening hours but that's something I will have to see for myself one evening. Thanks Kimura for a great first time experience. I'll be back soon."], ["Christina H.", "I wasn't sure what to expect from the ramen here based on many of the so-so reviews. I am in San Antonio on business, and wanted to find some food outside of the Tex-Mex genre. I love ramen, and have had it in Japan, LA, and NYC, so I consider my standards pretty high.Upon walking in, it smelled fantastic already. My boyfriend and I sat down and we decided to start with the baby bok choy with black garlic dipping sauce. It was pretty good, the sauce too salty for me and a little went a long way. Oh! Also, upon being seated, we were given some complimentary miso soup. It was a chilly day, and it was much appreciated! Very solid, standard miso soup.I had the Tonkotsu ramen with chashu, and my boyfriend had the miso ramen. It came out relatively quickly, and it was super creamy. I have had much porkier Tonkotsu broths before, and this one wasn't overwhelming in the pork flavor but was very rich and creamy. The BBQ chashu was delicious and flavorful, and I wish I had ordered extra shiitake mushrooms because they must be marinated in crack. My boyfriend's miso ramen was pretty tasty, but the broth did not really have any depth of flavor. This wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but it was pretty good and tasty, and I am surprised people do not rate this spot higher. I also am very surprised that more people do not take the initiative to speak to a manager if they are unhappy with their meal. It looks to me that their service is good enough to comp unhappy diners, and it is better to speak up and be satisfied with a meal you are paying for.This place was super busy for the lunchtime rush. I was disappointed they haven't updated their dessert menu yet, because I was hoping for some black sesame ice cream! Still, this is a solid option for satisfactory ramen in San Antonio."], ["Miriam B.", "I don't know what authentic ramen is supposed to taste like. All you ramen purists can scroll on to the next review if you got a problem with that. Anyway, I dig the ramen at Kimura and almost every other thing on the menu because it's freakin good and hits the salty spot (yeah it's salty sometimes). Recently I needed a tummy warming cure and the hot bowl of ramen that was made right before me hit the spot. I prefer the miso ramen because seeing the chunk of pork makes me feel like I've shamed my non-pork eating family. Having eaten all of the ramen options, even the porky ones (sorry mum), I have zero complaints. Prices are reasonable for downtown dining ranging from $8-$17ish. I also have to give a shout out to the super informed waitstaff. I appreciate how much they know about the dishes and their cultural awareness in explaining things. Cool points! Another positive is their use of local eggs and meats - conscious eating. I like that. I'm weird. Drawbacks include having to pay for parking if you go any day except during downtown Tuesday. Drinks from the bar are ok, never been really impressed by them so I stopped ordering booze and choose to put my dollars into the bangin' gyoza."], ["Chris O.", "Kimura is an affordable ramen shop near downtown San Antonio that offers a decent vegetarian ramen. It had this Afro Samurai feel - hip hop music when entering, an open kitchen so patrons could see food cooking, and hip staff that seemed to enjoy Japanese culture. I ordered the wakame and miso ramen. The wakame was this seaweed with wasabi paste. It had too much wasabi, but I really enjoyed the seaweed. It was seasoned with sesame oil and sesame seeds, which were nice touches. The miso ramen was great: I added tofu, a second soft boiled egg, and more shiitake mushrooms. The broth was excellent. The tofu had a great texture, but didn't absorb the flavor of the broth. Maybe it needed to be seasoned more heavily? The soft boiled eggs were amazing. A part of me wished it were a sunny side up egg. I was meticulously portioning out the eggs to last the whole meal; each bite with egg was better than each bite without. The dried seaweed, or nori, was a great addition. It added saltiness and a texture change that were fantastic. Vegetarians, remember to order this dish without the fish cake!This is a restaurant I'd return to if I were looking for affordable, tasty ramen in San Antonio."], ["Reilly E.", "Best goddamn ramen I have ever had. My mouth literally salivates when I think about Kimura!!! Literally EVERYTHING is good. Charred Edamame, Charred Shishito Peppers, dude, everything is freaking delicious here. I have traveled to South Korea, Japan, etc. and Kimura tops them all. It's a small, quaint location but the staff know their stuff and who ever is cooking is killing it in the kitchen. They even have punch cards for your ramen visits. I cannot recommend this place enough, prepare to make your stomach happy and warm inside."], ["Kelly T.", "Would come back to try another food since their service is nice. I order tonkatsu and tatanmen and both are great. Love the noodle and pork belly. However, my tatanmen soup tastes little salty.

This was the worst ramen I've ever had. Broth was weak and the noodles were soggy. Bean sprouts seemed to be old and the pork was meh. My boyfriend tried one of their \"sodas\" and that was horrible as well. It tasted like someone put a couple of drops of orange in stale water.I definitely would never go back here again. It's not worth the time or the money."], ["Caitlyn S.", "After a fun day touring the wine country, my husband and I had paid for parking downtown and wanted to take full advantage of it. Kimura has been on my bookmarks for awhile, so we trekked on over! The restaurant itself is super small and intimate, and it has a NYC vibe (NYCers would probably disagree with me - but for SATX, this place felt distinctly different). After seeing on Yelp that drinks were pretty expensive, we chose to stick to water and ramen. We kept it simple. I chose the vegetarian miso soup, and my husband got one with chicken. We both LOVED our soups, and scarfed them down. I'm sure I looked super crazy with ramen all over my face, but whatever. It was delicious.This time around, I was super happy with my choice and it was only $8 or $9. I think if I make it out to Kimura again, I'd love to do something different. I'll have to rely on the add-ins though, as there is only one veggie option. Anyway, it's worth a stop if you're downtown and want to feel transported to a big city and out of SATX. You can get away from the tourist traps that engulf parts of downtown SA and just enjoy the experience."], ["David C.", "My experience at Kimura cannot get any worse. If i could give it negative stars, i would. I went with a group of 4 people during happy hour. Once i saw the ramen, i knew it was going to a butchered broth of cream with some chewy noodles (for those of you from dallas, think Tanoshii but worse). The noodle was done correctly, but the broth was cream with no flavor of pork in sight (tonkotsu ramen). In an attempt to be classy, i just sat there quitely noting never to come back (if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing at all)My counter parts wasn't so tactiful, one of them complained that the broth was bland (understatement of the century). The other one had some chashu with STRINGS. Yes, the pieces of meat he got looked like a candle with wicks. See pics. The WORST part is when they said something, the manager came out and gave them their bowls for free WITHOUT even asking me if i had anything to say (although i probably hated it more than both of them combined). So my 2 friends got their bowls for free while i just sat there and paid $17 for probably the WORST BOWL of ramen that i've had in my life. SERIOUSLY? $17 for a bowl of ramen when i could have gone to HEB and got a bag of SHIN ramen ($.70) and had it way better? NEVER AGAIN. So the lesson learned here is to never come to this place for ramen, unless you want to eat strings in your meat. Also complain loudly, cause that will get you places in life."], ["Y G B.", "I really want to like this place a lot. But too may things reduce my level of excitement to A-OK. I've been here several times. I dined here before Tan Tan Men was available on the menu (my conversation at that time, with the owner, was boggling regarding the lack of a staple noodle dish in Japan left off the menu).But regarding the noodles. Always inconsistent. First visit had good noodle texture, but clumped together. Noodles are for slurping. Couldn't slurp without a workout from the chopsticks to break up the lump of noodles. Oh, and a whole soft boiled egg. Whole. Soft. Boiled. Egg. WTH?Second visit found seriously overcooked noodles. At least the egg was sliced in half. I never wanted to return. But my daughter called me and was hungry. She interns downtown, and wanted to grab a bite. So I grudgingly agreed to Kimura.Knowing that noodles were not the strong suit of Kimura, I ordered the whole broiled Saba.. We started with the grilled baby bok choy. Really f n good. The gyoza were really good, too. But seven bucks for four? They're not that good.My daughter ordered the miso noodle bowl, and she enjoyed it (she doesn't eat mammal, so I couldn't do an apples to apples noodle dish comparison). I enjoyed the Saba. It was moist from gill to tail and presented with wakame and sunomono.Service has always been attentive, so I won't delist Kimura. But I would never order noodles from here. Great sides, good fish and a super izakaya feel. Like so many izakaya in Japan, this gets a star for being in the neighborhood. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother making time. YMMV."], ["Gloria S.", "The restaurant does not feel like it's properly ventilated. \u00a0Expect to walkout smelling like smoke. We sat at the bar area and the music was loud making it a bit difficult to talk with your party. \u00a0The staff was friendly and served us fairly quickly. \u00a0I ordered the Gyu Don (beef, onions, shoyu (aka. soy sauce), mirin, green onions, with rice. The sauce was good, however, I felt there was to much. The beef was chewy instead of tender. \u00a0Making it difficult to swallows. However, the food presentation was nice."], ["Kyra T.", "As a Japanese, I have to say that this is the worst ramen I've ever had.................................................................................................."], ["Tia C.", "Being a Houstonian (where in my humble opinion houses some of the best ramen I've had), Kimura is a good find for San Antonio but still not to the same level as some of the ramen houses in Houston. Located off the riverwalk, the restaurant is small but cozy. There is seating at the bar, at the kitchen area and then the tables as well. The wait has never been more than 10-15 minutes even in the rush hour place.Their bar is nicely stocked with Japanese whiskey and sake. We had a clean filtered sake (cannot remember it off the top of my head but it had 3 words in its name) which complemented our dish well. In my opinion, their appetizers are actually better than their ramen. Everyone NEEDS to try the grilled bok choy and charred edamame. The grilled bok choy comes with an amazing garlic-soy sauce dip which only accents the grilled flavor. The charred edamame have the perfect smoky taste which accents the otherwise tame flavor.I have had 3 of their entrees: Miso Ramen, Shoyu Ramen and Yaki Soba noodles. My favorite was the udon noodles. Mainly because I wasn't a huge fan of the miso and shoyu broth. The shoyu broth is light but salty. The miso is also the same. Both broth still had a underlying seafood taste which could be from the seaweed and fish cakes. Honestly, it was quite overpowering. A MUST is adding shitake mushrooms. They are sweet and juicy and truly what is the best part of the ramen.Overall, the food is decent and the ambiance is lovely. I really enjoy the appetizers and the mushrooms but in terms of the main course, it works only because there are not as many options here in SAtown"], ["Kat U.", "The food was not good, and the service was terrible. They were out of a lot of things, which is understandable. However, our waitress (Madison, I believe) didn't tell us until after we had spent time with the menus and ordered what they didn't have. (And that's after waiting 45 minutes for a table.)They didn't have enough water glasses for all 4 of us, but instead of getting a different kind of glass, she just shrugged and said I guess we keep breaking them. Only after waiting until after our food came and me asking several times for water did she bring me a pint glass (why not do that from the get go?)They messed up our order and didn't make my boyfriend's food. They gave him miso soup since he had to wait longer, but the soup was bad. Just broth. No tofu, no nori, no onion. When we finally got to eat, the food was bleh. We couldn't even taste what looked like well-marinated chicken. It just tasted like fish paste. Madison never came back to our table though, so she never asked if everything was good. She went to the tables around ours, but not ours. She only came back to drop off the check, and my boyfriend very politely asked if our dish was supposed to taste like fish. She said there was no fish paste or fish in it and said we were probably tasting the nori (which was just a few flakes on the top, not mixed into the rice of anything). I said that I doubted that because I could taste the nori separately from everything else (and I like nori). Finally I just told her that our food was kind of terrible, and she just shrugged and walked away. Absolutely no attempt to talk to the manager and at least discount the food we weren't able to stomach. (I really hate pulling this kind of snobbery, but I've spent a good amount of time in Japan eating at ramen houses, and this definitely was not authentic Japanese food. The ramen was OK, not great, and not authentic.)Needless to say, we won't be going back. That was literally one of my worst dining experiences."], ["BJ L.", "Had the tongue ramen. With a group of friends, we sat at the bar. Was great. Very trendy, and busy on weekends. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEIR GYOZA. I'm serious. It's almost as good as the ramen.

In the 3 hours I spent needing to kill time for my Greyhound bus ride to Laredo, I was looking for a place to chow down at for the time being. I looked across the street and saw a place, in which seems like a hole-in-the-wall kind of establishment. I decided to look up the place, Kimura, on Yelp and discovered that it is a Ramen restaurant, a huge bonus since I love ramen.I entered the hole, and to my eyes, I am presented with a nice little atmosphere, a mix of Japanese and a relaxing, yet, welcoming vibe.Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by a really cute girl by the name of Alexis. Her smile complimented the restaurant. She presented herself in such a charming way, and sat me down at the area where the ramen is made.I was given the menu, and decided to go with their Shoyu ramen.Sitting at the kitchen table was definitely worth it, as I got to see the creation of my ramen in action. The two chefs - who I never got the names of - worked in perfect sync and harmony; one cooked the mushroom, chicken and noodles, while the other made the egg, prepped the bowl with greens and broth. Both chefs timed everything perfectly and brought all the ingredients together from the kitchen to the table.As I received my bowl, I instantly smelled heaven within the second. So the first thing I took a bite of, was the chicken. Normally, chicken that I consume is usually tasty on the outside, and plain on the inside; however, their chicken pieces was just a perfect taste in and outside. Maybe it has to do with the chicken being free-range. I proceeded to chowing down the rest of my bowl of ramen without further delay, and noticed how tasty the broth was, along with the perfectly cooked mushroom, egg and noodles, topped with seaweed pieces and bean sprouts.After finishing the heaven-on-earth bowl of ramen, I had realized that I spent too much time at Kimura, and was almost late for my bus to Laredo. The Shoyu Ramen definitely gave me something to be happy about while in transit to my next destination.Overall, the experience was amazing, and finding a hidden gem in San Antonio was well worth my time there. Alexis, who said \"come by again whenever you visit from Cali!\", is definitely the reason I'll stop by San Antonio the next time I'm in Texas. No doubt, the ramen places near me, Ramen Hiroshi and I Love Ramen (which are great places too), can't top Kimura's awesome quality ramen."], ["Miriam S.", "First off \u00a0- we went for lunch on a Saturday, on which, for whatever reason, both yelp and the kimura website said they were closed. Luckily I called and found out they were actually open. Unfortunately Kimura doesn't seem to carry shrimp anymore. The ramen we ordered was still good enough... But just wasn't as special without the shrimp. We also ordered the chicken skewers appetizer this time, which was ok. I'd be willing to give it another try but really hope they'll have more ramen options (at least with shrimp etc), because I wasn't too crazy about the pork meat in mine. Is it worth the pain of driving downtown and the hassle of parking? Time will tell...I'm keeping the 4 stars because I don't have a different place I prefer to get ramen at in San Antonio yet."], ["Tina N.", "I am so glad I found this ramen place.

Pork belly was good. Noodles were confusing. There was a lot more than average, which is nice, but they were really tangled and wouldn't stir very well.

Chashu is typically cut into thin slices, but here its much more thick and marinated more heavily. Mom had the Tantanmen. Just as bad in the reverse way. Soup was overly salty and she couldn't drink any of it. She just picked out the noodles and left the rest. The chili powder they use to make the soup spicy had such an artificial aftertaste to it, you can tell it was added after the fact.

We got our loyalty punch cards and I can say with certainty that we'll be back to fill these up. Highly recommend this restaurant for a fun, quaint date night or a quick bite. Very reasonable prices as well."], ["Hoa L.", "The restaurant is right across the street from a city parking garage, so keep that in mind for free Tuesday garage parking! The ambience of the restaurant is between modern, elegant, and semi-casual. You can feel comfortable wearing jeans or even a casual suit jacket. There's about six tables and a bar area for seating, so expect to wait if it's a busy evening. The water offered includes a large piece of \"purifying\" coal and the candle on the table and table setting is Asian and modern. I would say they do a pretty good job making the inside feel comfortable. The outside, on the other hand looks unremarkable. I ordered the pork tonkatsu ramen, but was offered a sample of both shoyu and tonkatsu broth samples. The tonkatsu won due to the overwhelmingly delicious pork flavoring. At $14, it seemed rather pricey, but downtown Japanese is rare so worth the extra dollars for the experience. The ramen included mushrooms (deliciously flavored and perfect amount of soy sauce-like flavoring), nori (typical fried seaweed), two slices of pork, half an egg, onion, and two slices of fish cake. The pork was really amazing and melts in your mouth with the perfect amount of grilled-tasting crispness. The broth is a bit on the saltier side, which I think takes away from the natural pork bone flavors. I really enjoyed the meal and service was great. The server was attentive and helpful in describing the food. On the other hand, it was a little odd being charged $1-2 extra dollars for additional items such as extra green onion, spice, or other small items. I can understand adding extra meat, but I felt that made the restaurant seem like a formal dining location as opposed to a ramen stop."], ["Jessica L.", "This is an authentic Japanese Ramen noodle house. Everything about it is amazing. Their miso Ramen with pork belly is absolutely to die for. If you are unsure about which brought to order, just ask them for a sampler and they will bring it out for free.

I ordered the house white and it was the biggest glass of wine I have ever been served. No lie, I bet it was almost half a bottle. For appetizers we ordered Nasu- grilled eggplant wit garlic and caramelized onions, Cucumber sunomono and Gyozo-pork dumpling with ginger- fantastic!For our entrees we had Shoyu with chicken- chicken broth with nori, boiled egg, fishcake, marinated shiritake, spring onions and bean sprouts. I thought it was great but my partner thought it was just ok. \u00a0I also ordered the Otaku don-seared chicken breast with ginger, egg, onions served over steamed rice. Funny thing is that my partner loved it and I thought it was just ok. Overall, we really liked Kimura. It's where the locals eat and there were no river walk tourists."], ["Gary C.", "Let's jump into this review cause no matter how awesome the atmosphere is or jamming the grooves are its a restaurant and you came to eat.Presentation of the food was good and pleasing to the eye. The lacking element was flavor in the soup. I ordered the miso ramen and the broth was lacking in any depth and flavor. Sadly it seems that the hot water and miso is mixed together in the bowl and sparingly seasoned. The tepid temperature of the soup has been noted in other reviews also. Making this miso ramen more of a miso soup with noodles.The high note of the meal was the noodles. \u00a0I've consumed more than my fair share of noodles in Asia and this is exactly how the noodles are meant to be.Overall if your looking for ramen in San Antonio you'll sadly still have to go to Austin for a decent bowl. \u00a0Price, short cuts for preparation, and lack of flavor will keep me away. Can't recommend this place."], ["Hanky P.", "This is a hip, sophisticated ramen spot. I'm used to ramen spots being little hole in the wall restaurants but this place is quite the cool spot to eat noodles. Service was great. We got there at happy hour so we tried one of their specialty cocktails. I wish I could remember the name of it but it had fig and vanilla bean. It was actually a manly drink even though it looked pretty and had vanilla bean in it. The ramen is very good. In the ramen bowl, each ingredient by itself was delicious. All of them together made the ramen bowl amazing! The oyako don was yummy. It was a seared chicken bowl with eggs, onion and ginger. It was the best kind of asian comfort food. The gyoza was great and it came with a good salty sauce with green onion. The only thing that sucked was finding parking :( There are two places you can park if you go here. The building right next to Kimura has a paid parking garage. We ended up spending $7 on parking, which is really pricey. Next time we will try the metered parking located near the Bill Millers BBQ that is also located right next to Kimura."], ["DirKandCy G.", "4/5*PARKING - Since their location is on Downtown San Antonio, be ready to pay for parking unless you plan to go after 6 pm, luckily it is free in Laz Public parking.*PRICE - Price is correlative to its taste and presentation. Check my photos.*STAFF - Great service! Staff are doing the \"Irashaimase\" greeting, feels like you're in Japan. Ambiance was classy yet simple. I've heard that the chef is a perfectionist so he really puts his heart on his cooking. The servers were professional and terrific at their jobs. You will really feel that they love what they do! Their faces tells it all. *FOOD - Great food! The gyoza has a unique presentation and great taste. Tonkatsu pork shoulder ramen was delish~! And their tantanmen ramen has spicy goodness. The only thing I can think of that was off was their entry/exit door - the spring mechanism might be broken since every time a customer comes in, the door also comes in \"banging\"."], ["Douglas S.", "Had a craving for some ramen and this place blew my mind.

The fried dumplings are obviously very fresh."], ["Didier C.", "I was initially going to give this place 4 stars after being twice in the past year. I thought the food was quite nice but the service was just ok. I went back for a third time last week and was very satisfied. We noticed they were a lot more welcoming and the service was actually great this time. We both had the Shoyu ramen, I had the chicken and my partner had the one with no meat in it. The ramen was fantastic! This has become our go-to place for Ramen because it offers great quality for good value!"], ["Matthew L.", "Starting this review off with a confession: I watch television shows about food. Not necessarily cooking shows, but just shows about people eating food. After watching shows where Chefs David Chang, Anthony Bourdain, and Ivan Orkin describe Ramen like it was the best most complex dish in the world, and that Chefs in Japan can study for up to ten years to make the perfect Bowl of Ramen, I was like I'm going to Japan and I'm eating Ramen for lunch and dinner. Needless to say I was super excited to learn that there is a Ramen Restaurant right here in San Antonio.Before coming here, I was enjoying a conversation with some of the kitchen staff from Cured, and one of the best bartenders in San Antonio who asked me if I had been to Kimura, and after saying no I was told that the Chef Michael Sohocki is an artist and his attention to detail is unmatched by the other places around town serving up bowls of Ramen. After that conversation I made an excuse to leave and headed over Kimura. I was greeted by my waiter, and brought a bottle of tap water with a piece of burnt wood in it. I tasted the water and didn't notice any certain flavor, so I asked whats the deal with the burnt wood in the water, and it was explained to me that burnt wood can be used to filter water, so I essentially had a Britta filter without the big jug at my table. After doing a little googling I found that yes its true burnt wood can be used to filter water, but not by simply placing it in the water. So I guess its just there to look cool. All my questions about the menu were answered to great detail, everything from the source of the fish, to the off menu special. I felt confident ordering my first bowl of Ramen and was ready to have the experience.I started off with Unagi Nigiri, because I couldn't resist. It was served as an order of two pieces on a little plank of wood, (I guess they like to serve things with wood here) and was paired with a dipping sauce that the Chef made for me it was soy sauce and a mixture of other spices, the sauce itself was wonderful. It was two intense bites of an exciting explosion of flavors, I was actually taken aback and said, \"What just happened?\" \"Should I order more?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ordered the Miso Ramen with Pork. My server used a laser pointer to show me every component of my dish there were quite a few. As described on the TV shows I watched about Ramen, the noodles and the broth are the stars of the dish, and the rest are just the to compliment them. The Broth was great the noodles where the same texture that Ivan Orkin told me they had to be, I slurped them up, not caring who saw! Man it was good. What I really liked though were the little prizes in the bowl you get to enjoy along the way, the pork melted in my mouth and tasted amazing. A-MAZ-ING! The soft boiled egg was such a treat. The Miso broth really gave it a little something extra. And the slices of Shiitake Mushrooms... Oh Lawd another explosion of flavor that really turned up the rest of the dish. Picked the bowl up and drank the broth and everything. All said and done it was too much food to finish, I left some noodles and a little bit of the seaweed garnish behind.On the way out Chef Michael Sohocki asked me how everything was, I explained that it was great, but my only previous Ramen experience involved a package of instant noodles. He laughed and went on to explain, the different broths that he uses. I'm excited to try the one he described as advanced with pork bone. I think I'll just ask him to cook me what he would like next time. I'm sure it will be great.This is a small place that would be great for a date. You may want to call ahead though, being that there is limited seating. Go give this place a try, I'm happy I did."], ["Kim N.", "Delicious ramen and great atmosphere. It certainly isn't the \"real\" ramen like people in California like to point out, but it is the best San Antonio offers. Wait staff and chefs are very nice. There's no free parking, you have to park in the parking garage if you don't want to walk too far."], ["Danielle G.", "I loved the vibes in this place. \u00a0It was really neat and the crane mural was beautiful. \u00a0The staff was wonderful and friendly. \u00a0We had a new guy, and he tried so hard. \u00a0Props to you dude, you did great!!! \u00a0His mentor was very excited and knowledgeable about Kimura and the way the restaurant is run. \u00a0You could tell that the staff really loved their workplace. \u00a0The music was also great. \u00a0There is a small downside, however. \u00a0I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. \u00a0I ordered the pork dumpling appetizer, it was fantastic. \u00a0The Sonomono was delicious. \u00a0The ginger green tea soda was wonderful. However, the ramen bowl was a bit bland. \u00a0I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. \u00a0I thought that the broth would have more flavor, similar to pho (in that I can taste different seasonings used in the broth). \u00a0Additionally, I thought the pork belly was a little overdone, at least for my tastes. \u00a0I am used to pork belly being a melt in your mouth kind of meat. \u00a0This is my first time tasting ramen, so take my review with a grain of salt. \u00a0I will go back again, but try the shiyo next time since soy sauce is my favorite ingredient next to garlic. \u00a0Perhaps I just picked the wrong thing for me.The boyfriend ordered Oyako Don. \u00a0The flavoring was good, the ginger delicious but not overwhelming. \u00a0However, the dish still felt like it was missing something. \u00a0It lacked a savory flavor. \u00a0I felt that the meat was, also in this dish, a little overdone. \u00a0Since I want to end on a good note, I love that all the ingredients are local, at least for the most part. \u00a0It also made me happy to see a restaurant in SA that you would normally see in Austin. \u00a0I think SA gets a bad rap sometimes, but I am rather partial to it because it lacks the snobby feel of Dallas and the hipster feeling of Austin. \u00a0I really like both Dallas and Austin, but SA is just unique. \u00a0Places like this just make SA a little better and a little different."], ["Michael V.", "This place is delicious. Have to get he Gyoza. The unique atmosphere definitely adds to the greatness that is Kimura."], ["Chris A.", "I've hesitated to write this review as I feel my experience with Japanese food and in particular Kimura's namesake ramen, Tonkotsu ramen, will deter others from going and trying the food here. However, I have decided to give my honest opinion for one reason - when you advertise yourself as \"authentic\" and say things like, \"we don't change the taste for American palates,\" you open yourself up to criticism if you fall short. Having spent nearly a decade in Fukuoka, Japan where Tonkotsu ramen originates, and having eaten the real deal literally hundreds of times in various stages of sobriety, I can say unequivocally that this is not proper Tonkotsu ramen. Notice I didn't say that it was bad ramen because it isn't as I enjoyed my bowl of ramen greatly. But when you go around claiming authenticity, you're eventually going to have someone call your bluff. The one defining factor that virtually every traveler has of authentic Tonkotsu ramen is the smell. When prepared properly, it smells... Bad. Like boiling the basketball team's socks after a double over-time. In fact, often you can smell Tonkotsu ramen blocks away. But this revulsion soon turns into a method of discerning the potential tastiness of the ramen. Prior to our ramen arriving we ate the cucumber sunomono. This wasn't bad. It looked the part and tasted fairly accurate to the real deal. We both remarked that it was a bit on the sweet side but this is within the scope of a chef's artistic license. In Japan I have had slightly sweet sunomomo but ordinarily it is not.The ramen at Kimura is the best bowl of ramen I have had in San Antonio. You can tell that the chef and staff put a lot of time and effort into their product. The broth was rich and rather deep in texture although on our visit a number of patrons were complaining that the broth was too salty, for which the server apologized. The noodles were probably the most authentic part of this dish. They were spot on in size and shape although they were a tad tough probably from the broth not being hot enough. Additionally, they were a tad sticky. This, in my expert opinion, is more than likely due to dropping in the ball of noodles without fanning them out. Also, the cooks need to make sure to use their saibashi (long cooking chopsticks) to separate the noodles as they cook. Oh, I forgot to mention that serving miso soup with ramen is a bit redundant and very uncommon in Japan. That being said, my wife and I enjoyed the miso soup very much.The ramen was esthetically pleasing. The various elements were there such as the chashu (pork), scallions, and nori (seaweed). In Japan, nori is never shredded in ramen but it is when put on top of zaru (cold) soba. Often the chef will just put a big old sheet of nori along the side of the bowl and extending out and up. Also, the fish cake, kamaboko, is never eaten in ramen in Japan but is eaten hot soba and udon. My Japanese wife said that while the kamaboko tasted good, presenting it in ramen is strange. Lastly, with regards to the Tonkotsu ramen I ate, the broth had a very strong bacon taste which seems to have come from the chashu which was not prepared in the traditional Japanese chashu method. It sure tasted good but authentic it was not.My wife, who is 100% Japanese, ate the miso ramen. She enjoyed the noodles, although they were a bit sticky like mine, but was taken aback by the shredded nori and komoboko in her ramen. Additionally, she stated that she could hardly taste any miso in her miso ramen. One other thing that we both agreed was not authentic is the boiled egg (ajitama). The egg in our ramen was just a plain old boiled egg with just a slightly cooked inner yoke, the way it should be. However, proper ajitama is prepared in the normal manner of boiling, but is then taken from its shell and placed in a bath of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin where it soaks up flavor for at least 24 hours. This also colors the outside and some of the inside a caramel color.Honestly, I'm split. On one hand, with no prior knowledge of ramen, I'd say this ramen was great. On the other hand, having eaten ramen multiple times each week for nearly a decade, I must address the claims of authenticity and say that it isn't authentic. As I've stated, I enjoyed the ramen personally and I think most others will as well; but when you get a Japanese customer in your shop you might not want to brag about authenticity. The Japanese are very proud of their food culture and have a difficult time acknowledging, for example, that a bowl of ramen is delicious if it isn't authentically Japanese. Another thought is that this ramen is over-engineered. Ramen is a simple food not meant to be froo-frooed too much. Great chefs seem compelled to mess with what is tried and true. This so often leads to a lack of authenticity and higher prices, the latter being one of the biggest complaints of Kimura. So, if you want a great bowl of noodles and do not care about au"], ["Tricia C.", "I thought the ramen at Kimura was great. \u00a0I agree that it's probably one of very few options in SA (although I don't live there anymore so I'm not positive), but it's still very deserving on it's own merit. \u00a0I must admit I'm pretty jealous that San Antonio has better ramen than Dallas--honestly I enjoyed Kimura more than Tatsu-ya in Austin even (which some people may disagree with, oh well).Service is a little slow and the place is tiny, but the atmosphere and food are worth a visit."], ["Mark B.", "Great experience at a reasonable price. \u00a0Wifey and I enjoyed our meal and drinks. \u00a0Started with the shishito peppers and moved on to tonkatsu w/ pork belly, extra meat (marinated in ginger - can't remember name but ask... it was worth adding), and extra nori. \u00a0Broth was rich, developed flavors, nice oil content. \u00a0Meat was amazing. We have been to Nama several times and have also enjoyed that, but the meats here were much better. The pork belly had a char on it!!! Lastly, our server, Samantha, was a joy. \u00a0On the mission statement on display in the restaurant, the last line item was to BE HAPPY. \u00a0She was definitely happy, but also answered all our questions with real knowledge and understanding of the ingredients and culture. \u00a0Thanks and we will be frequent noodlers."], ["Lauren B.", "So happy to find a ramen place in town! And even happier that it was delicious. I got the shoyu bowl with pork belly and Bok choy. I added the house spice sauce which brought it to a nice spice level- but definitely try it before adding it all in! The pork medallions where perfectly done and made the whole bowl. I'll absolutely be going back soon!"], ["Lindsay R.", "I love Kimura for so many reasons. Let's list them, shall we?1) This Happy Hour, y'all! Their amazing specialty cocktails are half off from 3-6pm, and $6 for these beautifully crafted bevs is a steal. They take a little while to make (they're quality!) so make sure you get your last round in before that cut off. They also have $3 beer drafts during happy hour. Plus small plates!2) Speaking of small plates, the gyoza are fantastic. They are freshly made and still have a crispy skin on them, contrasting the tender and herby filling. They come 4 to an order. The charred edamame is great for sharing with the table, and the coarse sea salt they're rolled combined with the charred skins make for a flavor intense version of a happy hour classic.3) Sushi and Sashimi: This is not your deep fried, covered in mayo, Americanized sushi. The rolls and individual pieces are very simply prepared, using only high quality cuts of fish, which allows the real flavor to shine through. It makes you remember that sushi is supposed to be a spotlight for fish and not breading. 4) The Ramen: I'm a sucker for slurping ramen. I love these bowls, and I always add an egg. Despite some reviews that talk skimpy portion size, I found the ramen bowl to be even more than I could finish, especially with the deep, rich flavors of the broth. Sign me up a regular. No, it's not the cheapest place in town, but I'm proud to eat somewhere with a focus on quality and not quantity. If you know Chef Michael Sohocki, you know this is his biggest priority. This is such a cool date night or friend group spot. Everyone I've brought here has raved."], ["Michaela G.", "Must try !!

I was so underwhelmed with the service we had received from the minute we walked through the front door. We stood un-greeted by the door for a few minutes only to be greeted by not a waitress but one of the cooks. The waitresses continued standing in the back talking amongst each other. We were then seated given two menus and were not even asked if we wanted to start off with any drinks or appetizers; no suggestions (since we were new we thought we would be introduced to the foods) . It took another 6 minutes for the waitress to arrive with another waitress with cups in hand to arrive but before giving the cups,the second waitress holding the the cups drops it onto the floor. These cups were glass and thankfully it didn't shatter but she exclaims \"oh it didn't break! It didn't break\" she continues to laugh and this glass was given to me after it had fallen on the floor. The waitress realizing it but still pours the complimentary water into this cup. The waitress stood there still not asking if we wanted something to drink or any kind of appetizer but rudely stands there in silence so I had to start off for what I wanted to order. And once we placed our order \u00a0the miso with pork belly, She quickly left. Here we are dirty glass that fell, no type of recommendations to what I should order and lack of service. The air was awkward and stale still trying to stay positive. I order the drink I've been trying to order since the first meeting with the waitress after 30 minutes of finally getting her attention while 3 of the waitresses attend to the 20 something year old guy. Serving him at every whim and communicating with him perfectly; we still sat there. As I got my drink I began to drink my ginger lemon soda I notice something floating at the top, and it was a fruit fly. Oh yes a fruit fly. I pulled the fruit fly out of my drink and just drank the \"complimentary water\". \u00a0My boyfriend asked for a for before the meal and I received the fork throughly dirty covered in food and food debris. We finally get our miso around 45 minutes in and we noticed some ingredients missing. Bean sprouts and other vegetables that were suppose to be included on the ramen. 12$ for a ramen with jipped ingredients, fruit fly soda and bad service. After the meal we tried finding our waitress after she left to the back after 30 minutes of trying to find her I was tired of how rudely we were being treated. I flagged down another waitress which abruptly asked \"what?!\" \u00a0I responded \"we are ready for the payment\" she took the credit card with disgust and attitude. I was I was deeply upset how this establishment treats its customers and how unsanitary this place is. Again I just wanted to point out how rude these girls with no eye contact and Lack of engagement with the customer. \u00a0Never again at \u00a0Kimura. *Aftermath* I had used the cup and unsanitary fork (wiped away the food) but gotten very ill afterwords. Please if you don't want to get sick do not eat at this establishment. I should've left."], ["Amanda N.", "This was my first ramen experience in San Antonio, and Kimura did not disappoint.

My friends (who got the miso ramen and the tonkotsu ramen) were also really pleased with their meals. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice and detailed the chefs were. My friends' to-go ramens were also packed so neatly (with the noodles in a separate container from the soup).

Sesame, nori, shitake, pork, fish, egg, onion, bean sprout. These were just some of the flavors that danced on my tongue as I dove into my Tonkatsu ramen. The warm and creamy broth gently permeated the incredients soaking in it. \u00a0I loved how the thick cuts of Shitake exploded with broth as my molars squeezed through its succulent flesh. The pork was sweet, soft, and buttery.

I would recommend it based on the quality of the food. I was looking for something in San Antonio that was on par with the infamous ramen restaurants in Austin: Michi & Tatsuya, and I found it here. I got tonkatsu ramen with chashu on both of my trips, and loveeeeed it. I went for happy hour on my first trip and was really pleased with the price and taste of my signature cocktail. The waits to sit and get our food weren't too long, however, the staff was a little lackadaisical.

Upon walking in I noticed a gorgeous bar and open kitchen which I always like to see. The place is small but that's what helps it to keep it's appeal. We were greeted simultaneously by all those on staff which was lovely. I really enjoyed the stained wood on black throughout the restaurant. It gave it a simple and sleek rustic/modern element. The menu is simple. Miso, ramen, etc. I tend to order the same thing at every ramen house since everyone tends to make it a bit different. I grabbed a Green Lady as a cocktail which I will say was the best part of my meal. The drink itself is an art piece. The hints of jasmine with fresh lime floated on the palate and were delicate and not overpowering, very well balanced. Our waiter wasn't fully knowledgable but he made up for it in attentiveness and patience. We traveled with a 2 yr old which always proves challenging and he was very warm and calm toward us. Next, the ramen. My husband ordered tonkatsu with chashu and I the same with pork belly. Plentiful amount of noodles but the broth was lacking in both flavor and depth, so I was a little disappointed. The broth tends to be my favorite part. The noodles were firm and fresh which made up for it slightly. The downfall of my dish was the pork belly. Pork belly should be rich and tender. My small two pieces were tough all the way through. I will give this spot another try in hopes next time I will get a better bowl."], ["Chris R.", "Before taking my review into consideration please note that I am from California and I have been to Japan several times.

I would place their Shoyu broth in my top 15 SHOYU broths I ever had.THE REST OF MY SOUP: Sadly the rest of my ramen was just ok. I was told that the egg noodles are fat.... nope! I was tricked! Though perfectly cooked, they are normal sized ramen egg noodles. But then again it's not hard to over cook or undercook ramen egg noodles. My chicken was a bit over cooked and it tasted as if they just marinated it in soy sauce then pan fried it, nothing more! The ajitsuke tamago or ramen egg was far from a ramen egg! It was your ordinary soft boiled egg! It was not seasoned at all!"], ["Eric P.", "I really wanted to like this, but this was not an enjoyable experience.

We really enjoyed dining here and will definitely be coming back again."], ["Mom T.", "No more Sushi (: That was the reason we chose this place since booth Google and Zagat still list Sushi. We got a few free appetizers to make up for that. The Edamame were good but a little too 'charred'.

The place needs better venting since the kitchen makes up 1/4 of the restaurant and you can smell everything that's being cooked."], ["Alexis H.", "Went to Kimura today and had the Ramen, it was absolutely delicious! The service was A+!! I dropped my chop sticks and one of the chefs was handing me a new pair in seconds! It was a wonderful experience for a quiet dinner one on one, highly suggest for a date night or even sitting and just enjoying a bowl of ramen on a cold rainy day! 10/10 would eat here again"]], "Li's Restaurant and Sushi Bar": [["Nicole F.", "My fiance and have become regulars here over the past year. We found this place by searching for a new \"sushi\" place, but have found so much more. Li's is great at service, sushi, infused sake, and mostly... Chinese food. Over the past year, we've sampled a bit of everything, or so it seems. Starting with sushi... Danny is the sushi-mastermind behind the bar, and he's wonderful at creating unique flavors with the fish and fixings. A few of my favorites include: the sushi tower (with Spicy Salmon), the Mexican roll, and the albacore tuna nigiri (which Danny puts crunchy garlic on top that brings out the flavor of the fish immensely). Once Danny gets to know your likes/dislikes, though, he's able to make some incredible \"special\" rolls that are really great and unique. If you want sushi, you should try here!The next great thing about this place is the infused sake. They have flavors ranging from lychee to pineapple. Recently, though, Danny's taken my fiance and I's suggestion and has started making pomegranate sake. The infused sakes are served hot or cold, and if you're really wanting to taste the flavor, the servers and/or Danny will be able to help you pick the best way it should be served. Definitely try it out next time you go... the infused sake is less bitter and strong than normal sake, which makes it extremely pleasant for folks who are just not traditional sake-lovers.However, all this pails in comparison to the true treasure of this place... the Chinese food. Sichuan-style is the go-to style here, but they'll Americanize it up for you, if you must. My fiance and I usually start with the hot and sour soup, and it's no short of incredible. The flavors are full, ranging from spicy to sour and in-between. It's our go-to starter course. One of my favorite appetizers is the Chengdu Style Dumplings. They are dumplings pan-fried in Li's special Chinese hot-oil and it's nothing short of heavenly. Just be careful and don't bite directly into the dumpling without cutting it first... or you'll likely get burned by the hot oil inside! Now, I'm a chicken person mostly, and Li's does chicken right. They have an incredible Chicken Hot Pot (which can be made to your spicy-level), that includes many vegetables ranging from tree mushrooms, carrots, celery, and baby corn all cooked in the house hot-oil. The Hot Pot is good to serve two, and tends to be our go-to when we want Chinese. The newest thing we tried last night was the Spicy Crispy Chicken... and we ate the whole thing! The chicken is lightly breaded, fried to perfection, and then tossed in the hot-oil; however, the breading remains crispy, the meat remains juicy, and the flavor is just immense. Every time we've come here, we've been no-less than impressed. One of my favorite things about Li's is the service. Everyone is very kind and willing to make sure your experience is no less than perfect. Danny and his wife Amy really do make sure their customer base is happy (even going as far as to read/watch their Yelp reviews to see what needs adjusting). Li's will remain one of our go-to spots for many years to come."], ["Jennifer S.", "Went on a Sunday night... Was a little worried because there was NO ONE there. We are glad we stayed though. We had great service. We ordered the dumplings. They were awesome!!!! Then we ordered sushi. Also awesome and fresh! The decor and ambiance is...slacking, but with great food it didn't matter.We will be back:) and we will recommend."], ["Lindsey B.", "Very solid Chinese! So much better than the average strip mall place. There seems to be some authentic things on the menu. We had the egg rolls, crab rangoons, general tsaos, and chicken lo mein along with some Thai tea. The Li's seems to use very fresh ingredients which is refreshing. The only thing we did not care for was the sauce that came with the eggrolls and crab rangoon. \u00a0What we really liked was the service. The waitstaff seemed to really WANT your business, which is refreshing. Everyone was very kind and service oriented and thanked up profusely for dining with them. We also loved the decor and ambience. Very tastefully decorated!$26+a great tip for amazing service"], ["Irma I.", "I guess I expected something just out of this world based on the reviews. Our experience was much more down to earth. Had the spicy edemame- if you can look at the picture you can actually see the amount of salt on those suckers. It was almost inedible. You had to pop out the seeds and try not to taste the pod it was so overly salted. Next come my entree - it was veggie & rice noodles. I don't know now the plate was under seasoned - like way, way under seasoned. It was a lot to the plate but if it doesn't taste like much then you can't really enjoy it. My husband had ordered a hot & spicy soup that never arrived. So after my plate arrived, his finally shows up. It was the chicken and veggie pot. It looks amaxing1 check out the pic so we are excited then the taste test....The plate now is OVER salted- and it was like whut? First over salted then undersalted and now oversalted again? Not sure what was going on there in the kitchen but something was not right. Again- It was a huge amount of food but we could not eat it because of the salt. Finally he sends the dish back and settles for the hot & sour soup - I think he just gave up trying. I don't know what happened with our experience here maybe it was an unusual anomaly but that salt left an impression that we will not soon forget- unfortunately. This was our experience."], ["Angela F. W.", "Gotta write a review for Li's before I leave this town! Before I review, you should probably know some background info. Northern China and southern China have very district cultures and food. First of all, most early Chinese immigrants are from southern China and they usually open up restaurants. Northern Chinese didn't immigrant to the US until recent years so they are new immigrants. They usually work in higher education, tech field, and other professional field and are rarely in the restaurant business. Because of the above reasons sadly you rarely see northern Chinese cuisine which I prefer at Chinese restaurants. So your typical \"Chinese\" food is first of all southern Chinese for the most part and secondly far from authentic. Another thing is Chinese restaurants are never consistent. The owner and cooks change so quickly and they usually operate under the same name after they change ownership. So just be aware of that. I could rate a Chinese restaurant 5 star today but I really would not be able to say anything about it 6 months from now. Ok so now you have some knowledge about Chinese restaurants in the US in general, let's begin. This place is probably not much in Cali or NYC but authentic Chinese is so hard to come by in this land of tacos. So for that, it deserves a 5 star. When my friend told me about Li's, I wasn't too enthusiastic b/c I never trust asian establishment that combines several cuisines such as Chinese and Japanese. But it turns out the chef at Li's does both well! I chatted with him who is incredibly nice. He is originally from northeastern China and I'm so glad to see new immigrants such as himself doing so well. The ambiance is nice and classy. It's not your typical greasy low end Chinese restaurant I seem to have a problem with. Chinese cuisine has so much to offer but in this country you don't see many Chinese fine dining places at all. Most of them provide cheap food to feed the masses which is fine. But that's certainly not what Chinese cuisine is about and the imagine it should project. Li's deff sets a good example for modern Chinese restaurants. Good work. Now let's talk about the food here. I've tried the sushi tower which is super delicious. For Chinese offerings, I've only had the seafood hot spicy pot (not to be confused with hot pot) and fish fillet and sour cabbage. I have to say the food is very decent. It's not on par with the ones I've had in Cali and NYC but it's still one of the best and most authentic in this town for sure! I wish I could try more offerings on the menu, but I'm moving to another state. Before I leave though, I want more ppl to know about this new Chinese establishment and have the opportunity to sample good Chinese food. I certainly hope Li's continues to do well!"], ["Dean H.", "Another authentic Chinese place to add to (growing) list of authentic Chinese places in SATX. \u00a0It is probably more of a 4.5 star place, but we round up here in my Yelp-ville.Menu is kind of weird, as the Americanized Chinese food is smattered in with the more authentic (mainly Sichuanese) stuff. \u00a0In other words, you don't have a separate authentic menu. \u00a0From what I can see from the other reviewers, it is probably best to steer clear of the more typical, Americanized stuff and go more authentic, which is what we did. Everything we had was good and I am looking forward to going back and trying more dishes, as when we went it was just my wife and our two small children.My one negative comment was that a couple of the dishes were a tad over salted, but it was not glaring enough to dock the place too much. Added pluses are a clean, pleasant environment and an extremely friendly and attentive staff.Now, I just wish SATX would consolidate all its Asian offerings into some sort of Asia-town somewhere! We have enough of a critical mass of places now that it would be totally doable, but I digress..."], ["John B.", "Oh yeah I can almost taste that spicy Edamame. Sooo....good. Thanks to our great waitress who highly recommended it. We have started becoming regulars because of good quality Chinese food and also good sushi. Of course close to home so that is a really nice thing when you want a quick bite. Pricing is very fair and portions are large. My kiddos say they have the best Lo Mein anywhere. Service is great, seems like (not sure) but seems like a family affair and there is an emphasis on customer service and attentiveness. They do have alcohol and again the waitress made a great recommendation on sakeThe place is clean and well kept. Lighting is just about right. Not too fancy-schmancy.

Very disappointing for sure. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and all I got were onions, very little beef. My kids got sweet and sour chicken and sweet and sour pork.

I watched as the gentleman that was about to prepare our raw fish hammer no less than 5 car bombs with customers in the bar area... it reminded me of Bar Rescue when you see the owners/employees getting hammered with the customers and buying them drinks... I looked at the chef's glassy eyes and heard his slurred speech and me and my girlfriend decided we would rather pay for the sake and leave without eating than run the risk of getting food poisoning from sushi... again.

I could polish off a plate of these for lunch and be pretty satisfied. Also tried their crispy spicy chicken and it was (as expected) excellent. Spicy and full of chunks of garlic and ginger with a ton of dried red peppers. Again the serving was massive and could have easily been shared by two.

The rice was good, the side of broccoli other than being covered in sauce was a nice excursion from the chicken and gooey sauce. I have eaten sesame chicken before and the sauce wasn't that prolific and thick. \u00a0The chicken was nicely cooked and juicy, but alas did I mention it was covered in sauce so thick and dense....My friend had Kung pao shrimp, he said the sauce was a bit off, maybe more vinegar than usual.

Everything was as good (and I'd like to say better than) anything I could find in San Francisco! The sushi was on the okay side, but why go to an Chinese restaurant for sushi anyway?

For vegetarians, though, Koi Kawa left a bit to be desired.I went with a colleague after work; we were both craving sushi. Koi Kawa is not easy to find. It's in a small strip mall / office park area, next to shops and professional practices. After sitting down at a pretty wobbly table, I mentioned to my colleague that Koi Kawa felt like a hole in the wall, which perhaps meant good food. I ordered the tofu steak, the vegetable roll, and the cucumber roll. The vegetable roll and the cucumber roll tasted good - exactly in line with my own expectations, but the food wasn't really top rated Zagat. This place was very traditional, and for vegetarians, that can mean trouble. The tofu steak was okay. I found myself pouring soy sauce on it. It was essentially a large piece of tofu topped with a grilled mushroom and butter mix. I think if the tofu steak would have had tempura batter or some different texture (soft squishy mushrooms and soft tofu are okay, not great), the dish would have been much better. It came with a miso tofu soup, which was nice.Overall, I'd probably come again with friends, but would try other San Antonio sushi first."], ["James S.", "Sushi variety and quality are superb at Koi Kawa; consistently excellent preparation/presentation are the restaurant's major draw. Not to mention waitstaff service! Fast and friendly. Also... the all-too-common \"cheap fix\" of drenching inferior sushi with overwhelming sauce(s) is not practiced here. More respect in my book. Recommending specific rolls proves difficult because each and every one offered on the menu is nothing short of outstanding. Alamo Heights and Midtown are lucky to have this place within a 5-minute drive. So why no 5th star? A handful of relatively basic food items are priced unreasonably steep."], ["S P.", "This place is tucked away in the back of a strip mall- a little hard to find but just follow the signs. First thing I noticed was the people working here are actually Japanese. For some people, this is a big deal and speaks for their authenticity, so I thought I would mention it. After being seated, we started out with the miso soup and gyoza appetizer. The soup was fine, but the gyoza was slightly over-fried. Despite that, it still tasted okay. We also ordered two of their specialty rolls. The rolls were well-prepared and more importantly, tasted great.

I had water to go with my sushi roll, as I do with most of my foreign meals. The place and staff were very welcoming, friendly, and enjoyable. The price was nice for the atmosphere, location, service, and products produced. I also had the Spider roll to go, wish they had given me chopsticks, or sauce to go with it, but I didn't ask for any, and it was fine on it's own."], ["Lisa H.", "Been here twice now and feel like I can write an objective review.

Not good enough to make up for the poor sushi craftsmanship.I would not recommend this place to anyone. I cannot even recommend that you go try this place and formulate your own opinion.

At the time of my visit, the restaurant staff were very rude, incompetent, and racist. (I am half-Japanese/White, and my fiancee is white) Our dinner party was comprised of my fiancee, three Indians, and me. One of my Indian friends is Sikh and was wearing his turban. Essentially, we just had a motley crew - no big deal, right? Wrong! Our server blatantly ignored our party and was very late getting food to us. We noticed that people who had arrived later than we had were receiving their food in a much more timely manner. One of the Indians did not receive his food until an hour after we had received ours, which is outrageous! He's a vegetarian and had ordered a tofu steak - not a difficult, time-consuming dish at all. The server said multiple times that it would be arriving shortly. They were clearly ignoring us and had the discourtesy to lie straight to our faces.But the discrimination doesn't stop there :DWhen we received our checks, the waitress had the audacity to add an 18% gratuity to the bill. Normally, I tip 20% for good service. But the service was terrible, and we had a party of 5, so I wasn't sure how this woman thought she was entitled to an 18% tip. It was pretty offensive. I disputed this with the manager and ended up paying no tip at all. I've been eating sushi since I was six years old, and I know good sushi (and so does my Japanese family); trust me, this place's sushi is only mediocre. Spend your money elsewhere at Niki's Tokyo Inn on Hildebrand. They have the best, authentic, well-priced product in town.

Absolutely horrible. Today is the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. There is no organization. Orders are slow. They have customers doing the bussing and helping out the wait staff. Wrong orders, empty glasses, dirty dishes and and complete chaos. We will start frequenting other places. The management needs to invest in better trained staff.

Keep in mind, I'm the only person in the restaurant and they were aware of my presence. The guy keeps going on and on about this woman and that she \"has a real nice body\". It was disgusting to hear him babble on and on about this woman and his two coworkers just laugh and provoke him more."], ["Rebecca L.", "This place is amazing."], ["Justine J.", "I went here on my birthday while I was sick and had noodle with fried shrimp and vegetables and it was really good.

The menu boasted a large variety of raw and cooked fish as well as red-blooded, land stomping mammals. They offered the usual fare when it comes to alcohol - the 16 oz Asahi being my favorite.In short, this was neither the best nor worst sushi place I've visited.

The kitchen food is also great. Try their shrimp Tempura, Nabayeki Udon, Beef Yakiniku, The rice bowl with the deep fried pork with some kind of eggs sauce on top (forgot the name) is AWESOME.

Slow service from a waiter that was either new and clueless or just didn't care. Food came out slow from a kitchen serving three tables. The lunch bento boxes are a great deal. Sushi didn't have any wasabi. Just rice and fish. It's a small detail but overlooking it made sense for this place. Bathroom was a bit sketchy looking. Maybe our experience can be chalked up to going early on a Sunday? If you'relooking for a cheap sushi lunch, have some time to kill and, can tolerate \"meh\" service; this might be your place."], ["Bettina R.", "I'm conflicted with my three-star rating for Koi Kawa. My experiences here have been mixed, but this seems right for now. Koi Kawa is tucked in the very back of the same shopping center as Tre Trattoria on Broadway in Alamo Heights. It was a little hard for me to find, as I'm not super familiar with the area, so be aware of that if it's your first visit. Inside, the main dining area is cozy, but not particularly upscale in any way. I actually favor these kinds of places over over-the-top, tacky ambiance, so this wasn't a red flag for me in any way, but I wouldn't call this spot glamourous or romantic either.I came for lunch on my first visit, and I had one of the bento box lunch specials. I don't recall specifically what sushi rolls it included, but I do remember that it had some crispy salmon skin, a green salad, a few pieces of salmon and tuna nigiri, and a basic roll (probably spicy tuna or something similar). I was pleased overall with the amount, quality, and price of my lunch entree.I had a craving for sushi again last night, so I went for dinner to sample a few more items. MySA did a review recently that praised the Sara roll, so I ordered that alongside a sashimi sampler and an avocado cup with spicy tuna. The avocado cup was delicious: what a genius idea! I think every sushi joint should offer it. There is something about the cool, creamy avocado combined with the spicy tuna that just hits the spot. The Sara roll, like most sushi offerings in San Antonio, is not traditional. I know it's not appropriate to lament this fact in a review for a particular establishment when I find it to be true for most places in town, but I just don't understand why every freaking roll in SA must be battered in tempura and slathered in spicy mayo. But for such a roll, the Sara roll was good. I particularly liked the slivers of green onion and red tobiko that topped it-- they provided a nice flavor counterpoint to the crunchy tempura exterior, as well as adding to its visual appeal factor. Sashimi is my favorite sushi item, and as much as I found it to have a clean, fresh flavor, there was something in the knife work that is lacking. The fish pieces were uneven, and some had jagged edges. This can, and did, affect the rich and velvety texture that should accompany sashimi, and it made me a sad, sad panda.The other reason for the three-star rating at Koi Kawa is just small issues with the restaurant itself. The service was spotty, the menu layout is awkward, and the sushiya behind the counter was slow. All of these things are usually non-issues to me, but each affected my dining experience last night. Our server wasn't obnoxious or anything, but our food came out one item at a time. Since I was with a friend and we ordered our own items separately, this made for some awkward moments. Also, she never brought us small plates that usually accompany sushi rolls, and couldn't immediately answer the questions we had about the menu. The menu at Koi Kawa has photos of their specialty rolls, with no accompanying description of what exactly comprises each roll. This made ordering a bit clumsier than it should have been, especially since our server couldn't answer any of our questions offhand. I don't know, maybe I'm being a little too hard on Koi Kawa, but I expected more. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but for me, any dining experience is about the details as much as the food, and that's what this particular place lacked, making my dining experience here a little less smooth than it could have been."], ["April R.", "i love their quiet location and casual dining experience. My favorite item besides the amazing rolls they offer was the avocado tuna stuffed appetizer. This is a must try if you live in San Antonio, even if you're not from the broadway area!"], ["Nick C.", "(June 23, 2011)Tucked into the back of the business/retail complex whose buildings are connected by quaint wooden walkways reminiscent of an old-world boardwalk found on the east coast, Koi Kawa Japanese Restaurant houses an unassumingly small dining room, full sushi bar, and private back room.When we arrived, we perused the ample menu, replete with nigiri sushi (two pieces per order), specialty sushi rolls, appetizers, and full menu of Japanese entrees including favorites like chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and donburi (bowls of sweet seasoned white rice topped with your choice of meats, tofu, and/or vegetables). Prices for nigiri sushi ranged from $3-$4; entr\u00e9e prices from $8 to around $12.We found a suitable station at the sushi bar, and immediately struck up a conversation with sushi chef Thomas, who admitted to working at the establishment on a part-time basis. His deft skills with the chef's knife, preparation and presentation of sushi however, hinted at years of formal training and experience.The dining room soon filled to capacity. Even the back room, which was host to a group of executives from Toyota Motor Company, was overflowing. For a Thursday night, the restaurant appeared to be packed. Always a good sign in the personal opinion of this humble reviewer. Further evidence of this restaurant's notoriety was the recent restaurant review and Zagat rating posted prominently on the front door.I started off with a bowl of miso soup, and an order of fried gyoza (deep-fried pork dumplings, 6 per order). The pairing was a wonderful way to start what would prove to be a great meal. Being a veteran of many sushi restaurants, I took charge and described in detail to Carlos the various offerings on the menu, including Japanese translations of some of my favorites.Thomas then passed both Carlos and I a small bowl each of seasoned jellyfish. I consider myself pretty adventurous when it comes to food, but I have to admit I've never tried jellyfish. The consistency and base flavor reminded me of cuttlefish. The seasoning was slightly on the spicy side, but didn't overwhelm the flavor of the jellyfish itself. I found it tender and delicious, nicely paired with the hot green tea I had ordered. I admitted to both Carlos and Thomas I was able to finally exact revenge on these animals, who had stung me all those years growing up surfing in Hawaii.I ended up getting two orders (four pieces) of bigeye tuna nigiri, done in traditional style (with wasabi already inside the sushi), one order of ebi (sweet shrimp), and one order of unagi (fresh water eel). The tuna was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, with just enough wasabi to compliment but not overwhelm the subtle flavor of the fish. The ebi was as fresh, with a wonderful sweet flavor, and the unagi had a light flavor, enhanced with the Japanese sauce drizzled onto each piece.Knowing I'd still be hungry, I ordered from the restaurant's special sushi roll menu. Taking Thomas' advice, I ordered a Chronic Roll, ($10 for 8 slices), which consisted of tempura shrimp rolled inside the rice alongside avocado, topped with slices of unagi and spicy tuna, and garnished with eel roe (raw eel eggs). The entire roll was drizzled with ponzu sauce (sweet vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and lemon juice). Presentation as always was top-notch, lending itself more to art than food.The various ingredients in the roll combined to create an initial blast of flavor, which started with the tempura shrimp, then replaced with the subtle flavors of the unagi and saltiness of the eel roe, then finished off with the spicy tuna and zing of the ponzu sauce.I realized why they named this roll \"Chronic\". Like its sticky green grass namesake, this roll is utterly addicting.Carlos, who is what I call a \"sushi virgin\", had made faces at the various sushi I had ordered and consumed. But I was determined to have him try one slice of the Chronic for himself. I convinced him to take one piece, which he reluctantly placed on his plate (he had ordered the \"safe\" California Roll, which consists of crab, avocado, and rice. Real risky stuff there Carlos!By this time he had consumed half of his second beer, so he may have built up some \"liquid\" courage. Or perhaps it was the jellyfish that had spurned him on to try something outside his comfort zone. In any case, he ate the slice of the Chronic. While I expected him to grimace or even spit out the sushi, the look of surprise on his face was worth all the trouble.We spent a few minutes comparing the joyous and subtle flavors in the roll, and the freshness of all the fish at the restaurant. In fact, Carlos would spend most of our drive back to Fort Sam Houston raving about his first foray into \"real\" sushi.Even now, as I write this, I realize and linger on the delight of the offerings at this restaurant. If you happen to visit Koi Kawa Restaurant, try the sushi, but certainly the Chronic Rol"], ["Nicole B.", "I love this place...great gem hidden behind Tre' on Broadway.

I love their tempura and miso soup as well, and though they are often out of stock, try the mochi ice cream if they have it!Overall, this is a great place to eat no matter how many people you're coming with. It's very modestly-priced for the quality of food you're getting and the ambiance is very relaxed.

They came without the shell, and the dipping sauce was heavy, but I liked it :) Then I ordered the Tekka Don, in hopes that it would have been like the one I had downtown at another restaurant. I thought it was a little pricey at $16 because I thought I would be getting more sushi, but the amount ended up being enough.

The sushi chef knows what he's doing. The fish was fresh, sliced elegantly, and the fish to rice ratio was perfect. I usually find that some chefs serve their nigiri with a pillow of rice that is just too thick and masks the fish, but the Kiku Garden chef does just what I wish more sushi chefs did: He rests a long slice of fish atop a small bed of rice. Perfect. One more thing: THE SERVICE HERE IS SOO NICE. We conversed SO much with the sushi chef. My boyfriend and I felt like we walked out of Kiku Garden with a new friend! Seriously.

The inside is mostly wood, which gave the restaurant a nice asian look. Anyways, they had a big seating area and long tables for our group of 10 people.

I got the Gal bee (cut marinated pork with rice), which had a small salad and some small sides that came with it. It was pretty delicious, although nothing that totally blew me out of the water.

The restaurant doesn't look too pleasant from the outside, but it is actually well decorated and quite nice inside. Of course I ordered the Jah-jahng-myun. My server was very nice and attentive. I asked if the dish would be enough for one person and she said yes. To be honest, I didn't expect to taste my hometown flavor in a Korean restaurant in SA so my expectations were low. But when I got my noodles, I was pleasantly surprised b/c it was reminiscent to Peking zhajiangmian. The black bean paste/sauce was well made and the noodles were very chewy and seemed hand made. Great flavor! For dummies who are reading this review, you mix the black bean paste with your noodles and that's how you eat it, lol. It came with chopped cucumbers and several small kimchi plates which were nice too. I guess everything would come with kimchi in a Korean restaurant, that's just the way it is. My only complaint is that the noodle serving was too small, I still felt hungry after finishing the whole thing. My dish actually came in a giant bowl but the noodles barely covered the bottom of the bowl (see photo). So I had to order some fried dumplings to fill up my stomach. My server said she didn't think I could eat that much b/c I look very tiny. Shrugs. This petite young lady has a big stomach, ya know! Anywho, the dumplings were pretty tasty too. And I had the black bean paste left over to take home.Overall, I was satisfied with my experience at Kiku garden. I'd come again if i am in the area. I think they have KBBQ here too.

Bugolgi was one of the cheaper things on the menu and it was $18 or $20 bucks. That's outrageous for marinated sirloin! Should be more like $7. $20 dollars is what I pay in San Diego for all you can eat korean barbecue with a variety of meats and side dishes. The sauce didn't even taste right. There was something missing in the sauce. It just wasn't flavorful. The korean barbecue I buy from the korean market in California that I cook in a pan at home tastes better than this. The sides that came with the meats were average and came on super tiny plates for our large group. \u00a0I also ordered tempura shrimp and miso soup which tasted standard. The service here also wasn't that great and a few people have to want to cook for themselves in order to use the grill.Overall, I don't think I'll be back here.

The ghot-gae-jhi-gae is fantastic. If you are new to the Korean BBQ experience order the MO-DUM-GU-EE for a taste of many treats.

In addition to Korean dishes Japanese dishes including sushi are available."], ["Hope B.", "We went to Kiku last night and sat at the sushi bar- it was a great experience! The sushi chef gave us an appetizer to try while we were deciding on rolls, and they were delicious! We had the spicy tuna, bulgogi, volcano, and Marylyn Monroe rolls. It was way too much sushi but all of it was delish! The chef was very nice and attentive- always making sure we had drink refills and asking if we liked the good.

What I love about Kiku is how the service was always good and the food consistently delicious no matter what I tried, that is until I went last week. Ugh. I really don't want to not like this place because it's usually so GOOD which is why I only have the balls to dock one star lol. I've only ever gone to Kiku's during off-peak days, but it was post Christmas this time and everyone and their Moms were out eating, so it was only right for this place to be uber busy. We weren't attended to for so much time that when our waiter finally got to us, even he was surprised no one had taken our order. It took quite a while to get our banchan and even when we got it, they forgot to leave behind utensils and only a couple of napkins for a group of six, forcing us to flag them down more times than we would care to. The service wasn't the biggest problem though, it was the ridiculously bland, water-like soondubu jjigae that three of us were stuck with. The other two of us got lucky and got our safe order of bulgogi and the surprisingly delicious order of a spicy beef and root stew, yukgaetang. Soondubu jjigae should always be a safe order. WHAT HAPPENED!? The three of us got resourceful and dumped kimchi and bulgogi and a boat load of salt into our bowls to make it more palatable. The bowl of jjigae definitely looked different from the other times I've had it here. It was topped with a slice of fishcake and had clam shells in it with varying amounts of clams, one bowl was seriously lacking clams. I was disappointed and so was my other sister visiting from California who got the bowl with no clams :P I swear it tasted way better the last time I came by! Way to make me look bad Kiku, but I still can't turn my back on you! I have to go back, preferably during non-peak hours and see if this is a permanent change to their soondubu jjigae soup base because I just can't not like you, Kiku!"], ["Elizabeth R.", "The sushi chef seems like a nice guy, but the sushi was awful.

I need to drag this joint down because the 4 star rating for this place is downright misleading.Didn't really feel like writing a review for this place but after eating the 'dinner menu' I feel strongly about writing a truthful review for this place.First of all, you must be like some sorta of millionaire if you can afford to come here frequently because the prices are outrageous. $10.99 for combo fried rice. The quality doesn't even add up. The rice is burned, the chicken is dry and they use the smallest shrimp you can possibly find on earth.Let this be a warning to fellow yelpers that they don't serve lunch on Sundays which basically means they have a license to rip you off merciless. Everything on the menu for dinner is like $9.99 and above. Who do they think they are anyways? Kiku is definitely not a fine dining restaurant. I don't understand the prices here at all.When other yelper's say this is in a shady/ghetto part of town, they were not lying. This place is stuck in the corner of nowhere with some sort of drug rehab apartments in the vicinity. If seeing the dude with the crack pipe in the parking lot didn't scare you off yet, the prices and the bad attitudes of the servers will definitely keep you far away from this place for good.Please do yourself a humongous favor and just go straight to Maggiano's. That is exactly what I did after visiting Kiku for dinner."], ["Heather B.", "Great food, horrible service! The lady tossed our menu on the table..we just assumed that's where we was supposed to sit. Then after ten min..no joke ten min I had to go get the waitress to order. Then after she brought the food and never returned to check on us or refill drinks. This could have gotten 4.5 stars !"], ["Nina N.", "First Impression:On the outside, this place looks like a lighthouse in the middle of fifth ward, the area was real shady. I'm originally from Inwood so I know ghetto when I see it. However, the inside surprised me, it was nicely decorated, but it don't matter how upscale you try to make it cuz as soon as I step out BAM BAM! There's a thrift store to my left, a Goodwill to my right, and crack pipes all over the parking lot. I gave 1 star for the effort, they almost had me.Food and Service:This place had a lot of overpriced Korean dishes and a sushi bar at one end of the restaurant. As much as I love sushi, I hate when they try to do different cuisines and then charge $7 for a California roll with imitation crab meat and cheap filler ingredients.My group ordered the Kalbi and spicy pork to start with. The waitress kept forcing us to order another meat but we wanted to continue looking at the menu and order again later. She tapped her pen on the table, rolled her eyes, and would not take NO for an answer. She finally gave up and when the food came out the meat was okay, they barely gave us any sides (two pieces of broccoli, two pieces of kimchi), you get the idea? Later, we asked another girl for garlic and jalape\u00f1os and she gave us the Korean stink face and told our waitress who also made a Korean stink face. If you don't know what the Korean stink face looks like then watch the movie, Pitch Perfect, the Asian girl does it. Anyways, when we asked for more sides the waitress said \"okay\". Several minutes passed and we asked again, this time though she told us no more sides unless you order another meat. Really? Thanks for making us wait and then giving a bs response. We were so upset we ate the rest and left nothing behind.Final thoughts:We debated if we should tip little or tip nothing. The service was so slow, rude, and terrible that we gave her no tip. We left the establishment and while we sat in the car we were suddenly startled by a BANG BANG BANG on our window. We looked over and there was a dark figure hovering over us. It wasn't a homeless man or crackhead at the window but it was our crazy azz waitress. WTF?! We burned rubber out the parking lot without talking to her because we didn't know what her intentions were and we sure as hell didn't want to find out. She could've spit on us, damaged the car, or pulled out nunchucks? Kind of like the crazy Asian lady in the movie, Kung Fu Hustle. She may look harmless but you never know.... or maybe she just wanted to question us about her lack of tip? Regardless, you just don't go out to a customer's car and creep them out like that. You got $0 tip, it wasn't a mistake, you just suck at your job and I never want to see you again. Sayonara!"], ["Jung H.", "To my taste, Food was 8/10 but everything else brought it down to 4/10.

The service was good when waitresses came around, but they're so short staffed that they almost never came back to the table voluntarily. 4 of us only had 5-6 banchan to share among us even when we all ordered very expensive dishes costing around $20-25 each. Sadly, the most memorable moment that I remember at Kiku is seeing numerous customers just like me with grim faces waiting on services. And the menu pricing for sizzling dishes found at the EXPLORE THE MENU at yelp is outdated. Real prices were at least 5-7 buck more expensive than what was listed on yelp.

I liked the kimchi but it was a bit too spicy for me.The service is really slow, as other people have pointed out. We were there probably around 3. Never had either of our glasses refilled. We came in when there were probably 7-8 other tables. Even after most of the guests left, it took a long time before they started to clear any of the tables down.

The box was nice and overflowing with food. The complementary salad and miso soup they serve you in the beginning was a plus. However for a box filled with primary pan fried/deep fried food it's best to eat it immediately after being prepared so everything is still crunchy and warm. However, when I got my box EVERYTHING was cold. So therefore I got a box with rubbery gyoza, soggy tempura with the batter slipping off the vegetable, and rock hard chicken. The only thing warm on my plate was my rice.

It is a seat yourself establishment (which normally makes me wary) but literally the moment we sat down, he was ready to take drink orders and answer questions. Food was served quickly, and the hot foods were actually very hot! The only problem with service throughout all of it was towards the end, when our waiter accidently gave us someone else's credit card! For food, my husband ordered the Oyakudon and I ordered a variety of happy hour sushi including the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Crab, Tai, Hokkigai, Unagi, and Hamachi. Highlights are that the Unagi and Hamachi were perfect and beautifully presented. The Spicy Tuna was also actually spicy, and the Miso that came with the Oyakudon was quite good. Downsides are numerous though. The Tai (whitefish) was hard and very warm. There was no taste to it, so much so that I could only taste the sushi vinegar in the rice as I ate it. The Spicy Tuna and Crab rolls, while utterly delicious, were improperly shaped - very messy, and square! Half of the Happy Hour Sushi plate looked sloppily thrown together. As well as the Oyakudon being over seasoned to the point that my husband could not even tell that the chicken was breaded; it was just a soggy mess.

Only wish they were open 7 days a week. A+!"], ["April-Denise H.", "Great sushi, great atmosphere, and the wait staff is great as we'll. I've tried so many rolls. I always try to get a different one everytime I visit. Great salad and miso soup. :) Try the \u00a0edemame was yummy!! And i can't remember the roll in the pics name. I think it is the San Antonio I'm not sure, but ask your waiter and I'm sure they will know. :)"], ["Claudia P.", "Hubby really dislike eating asian food, (he was stationed in Korea and climes to know the real deal) but he liked Goros over all. \u00a0I loved it, (I'm a sucker for Asian food) staff was nice, price is reasonable, food was yummy, although it was kinda of a buzz kill to see one of the staff members eating behind the sushi bar ."], ["Katie H.", "Best sushi in town! Free salad with yummy peanut dressing and miso soup when you done in.The rolls are a decent size, they used to be a lot bigger but I guess things can't stay perfect forever."], ["Noe DelaGarza N.", "Been here many times and the sushi is good. But I am dissapointed that even though I got there 15 minutes before closing they said I could not eat there because they were closing. \u00a0Restaurants should respect the times they have set, not a couple minutes before. 20 minute drive and my lunch time gone to waste because someone was lazy ."], ["E B.", "Had sushi from several places and.in some cases, I'll leave those places and go back here ;)Texas roll is one of my favorites, but they are all great. It takes a little while to get your food, but it's well worth the wait."], ["Ashley B.", "I've been here countless times now and I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet. We usually go during happy hour which ends up being a pretty great deal since the sushi pieces are priced pretty low. The service is always really good and we usually end up with the same waiter. He's super attentive and I never have had an empty cup! Definitely loses a star for the parking situation because the lot is small and the place is usually pretty busy. Doesn't matter though because the sushi is really good and I'll fight for a parking spot just to eat there."], ["A. G.", "This place was Packed!! Was greeted nicely. Ordered what I thought would be a great meal. Got something completely different. So sad. This place used to be so good when there were Japanese people making the food. I had never tasted something so good. That was too long ago though. Don't get me wrong I was still hopeful with a bunch of Hispanic guys behind the counter pushing out dishes that looked really amazing. Unfortunately they had NO IDEA how to make mine even though it was on the menu. I might go back when I want a more general public kind of sushi. But if your looking for authentic this might not be the place for you."], ["Jessica M.", "The sushi was at most par standards. Wasn't bad but also wasn't amazing by any means. If you come in with a group of more then 5 be prepared to be cramped and crammed somewhere. Service is slow, or non-existent. \u00a0I went with my family for my aunts birthday because she had been raving about how great this place is then that same night I get food poisoning. Another friend who went with us also got food poisoning. I do not recommend.I know this is San Antonio, but there's so many better sushi places you just have to look and certainly don't settle for Gorros!"], ["Trace B.", "Fantastic fresh handmade sushi! So many options, along with several Japanese options for appetizers, salads, soups, lunch specials, drinks, etc. along with some Korean and Chinese options. I don't know about you, but one order of a sushi roll (about 8 pieces) was more than enough, because they're so large! The fact that they were larger/thicker than expected (I'd say a bit smaller than the circumference of a 1/4th measuring cup) and had more cream cheese and tempura crunchies on top was because, in my opinion, caters to the Americanized (Texanized?) palettes of San Antonio. Anyway, the roll itself is huge and is even more filling when you order the free miso soup and peanut-dressing salad along with it. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered the tempura (battered and fried veggies and shrimp) appetizer beforehand, but I was piping hot and delicious anyway. I ended up taking two tempura pieces and one single sushi in a small box.Staff (servers and sushi chefs) was very friendly; the waiter even asked if manpanion and I were there for a special occasion (it wasn't, but I will infer that we might have been treated to something? I don't know, no guarantees but it was nice of them to ask). Sushi chefs take pride in their work and ask how your food tastes. Bathroom was clean, although probably no AC in their because it was rather warm. You seat yourselves when you walk in so we sat at the \"counter\" where the sushi is made. Although it's fairly casual, it is a nice place to bring a date. Indeed the tiny parking lot was PACKED on a Friday night. I wouldn't have noticed this tiny little place with thin red lettering \"GORO'S\" tucked away among an L shaped group of stores without my uncle, a San Antonio native, had told me about it. But I'm glad I found it. Definitely will return!"], ["Erika M.", "Delicious sushi, presentation is really nice too! Every roll and appetizer I've had here has been delightful. And it's a nice atmosphere when it's not uber crowded(but it always is cus it's delicious) My sister claimed the smoked salmon on her roll was raw and Made her sick, but I had some of her roll and it was good and I didnt get sick at all. Parking here is awful"], ["Estevan L.", "They have awesome Sashimi. They were able to slide it thin for me. It was very fresh and tasty. Not many places can do it this way! I was very impressed at the freshness."], ["Shanna S.", "Caterpillar roll is wonderful! Udon is good too. Staff is always very friendly. My friends like the UT roll and while I haven't tried it, it looks pretty impressive!!"], ["Angela B.", "WARNING: The sushi is GIGANTIC ! but amazing ! We'll defiantly be back. My boyfriend and I can usually murder 4 rolls plus a beer or two and be fine. We ordered 4 rolls here and are basically taking 2 1/2 home ! Taste is great, service is great, we love it and will order less next time ! Lol"], ["Wally M.", "Great sushi! We have yet to try a roll we do not like. The San Antonio roll is my favorite! Lots of jalape\u00f1os on it I ask them to put the on the side it's a bit much for me.The service is the only thing that has not been consistent. We've had excellent service most of the time, but also some petty bad one. Try it out I'm sure you'll like it!"], ["James S.", "If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. It's good and the prices are reasonable. There's nothing spectacular about the sushi but it is good. I don't frequent this part of town often but it's a good option if in the area. I had a cucumber salad, spicy tuna roll and sunset roll (salmon, avocado, cucumber and crab) all were good but it was too much food. A complimentary miso soup and salad are included in your order. Also, parking is limited for this restaurant, don't park next door or you may get towed."], ["Desire'e P.", "Great rolls, best Ive had in a long time."], ["Enrique G.", "This is one of my favorite sushi places in SA! I brought my girlfriend tonight and she loved it, of course. I had the O-Roll, can't go wrong with that one and my lady had the Rainbow Roll which was also very delicious.

I've recommended it to several friends and now it has become one of their favorites too. \u00a0The amount of food for your dollar is great!"], ["Sheena G.", "Awesome sushi! I had the Bobby roll which was super tasty. The beef soup is just ok but the salad and dressing was good. Prices are avgerage..definitely will be back."], ["Sarah J.", "I love me some sushi! Especially the rolls with an abundance of raw fish. If you do too, I highly recommend the samurai special roll. It is raw fish inside and out. Yum! The x-mas roll was also pretty good. The service was good and quick, the restaurant was decently decorated and the staff was nice. I'd probably go back just to have the samurai special again."], ["Brittany R.", "UT Roll is my fave- super filling even though it's sushi!"], ["Eduardo M.", "I found this little place by accident one afternoon last September, while running errands in San Antonio. I was hungry and pulled up Yelp on my phone for recomendations. To my surprise I was parked right in front of Goro's which had excellent reviews.

I will be back for sure"], ["Kelly W.", "This is my first time at Goro's. \u00a0I've known of this place for forever. \u00a0However, I've never tried it. \u00a0I do, however, know of Goro, the former owner and I love \u00a0sushi at his newer place. \u00a0We arrived around 4:30 for an early dinner, and sat at the bar to watch our food being made. \u00a0The staff \u00a0was \u00a0awesome. \u00a0The guy making our sushi was very friendly. \u00a0No one was there, so we had a good chat with him and the staff. Now onto the sushi. \u00a0We had a total of 5 rolls between the 2 of us. \u00a0The rolls were nothing to write home about. \u00a0The fish was never the highlight of some of them and not as fresh. \u00a0I've had the same rolls, better elsewhere. \u00a0However, this is a good place if you need a quick sushi fix. \u00a0Another downfall, is that they don't have what is offered on the menu. \u00a0I was really looking forward to some Uni. \u00a0Overall this is a 2-3."], ["Fawn G.", "Oh Goro's you have so much potential! I'll be honest, the only reason I come here is for my obsessed friends birthdays every year. It's not the best sushi in San Antonio. It's tasty. The fish is pretty fishy. The rice is even fishy on veggie items. If you're hungry, you'll eat it. If you plan on trying Goro's I'd suggest going during happy hour. You can buy several pieces for less than $10, then I would getting one specialty roll (Three Amiga's, Texan or Eva Roll) just for giggles. It's not fine dining. Most times you are questioning the music selection. One night it was J-Lo. Another was Kanye West. I mean.... seriously, what do you expect on the back of a business strip warehouse district?"], ["Ashley T.", "This place is good if you want good cheap sushi. I usually get the UT roll or the whatever roll and it always comes out delish.

If I could give them NO stars I would. I walked in, sat at the bar: no service. The chiefs looked at me and completely ignored me. So I then moved to a table expecting a waiter to come: NOPE!

I recommend not going at all!"], ["Michael A.", "Went there last night. Terrible service.

Great quality fish, large portions.

I am not sure if he sold Goro's sushi or if he still owns that one as well but I believe he has sold it."], ["Josh L.", "I stopped in here because these guys had a happy hour on a Saturday and I thought it was very happy with what I got. Happy hour runs M-S (5-7P). The menu is limited, but awesomely priced. Practically every piece of the nigiri sushi I ordered was awesome, and the spicy tuna roll was good too.

I will NOT go anywhere else for Sushi! Order the marianita roll its the best!!! The only downfall is, the place is a little over crowded and small for the amount of business it gets.

The staff was NOT knowledgeable about any of their ingredients used in their sauces, or dressings, but they also spoke so little english they could not even understand the question I was asking.
