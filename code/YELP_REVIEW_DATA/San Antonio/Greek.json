Best Greek food in SA. I buy bottles of their salad dressing (which are sold in-store and at some HEB locations) Excellent spanakopitas and eggplant appetizer. Tzatziki appetizer is also great. Although some of their entrees and gyros are wonderful, I am a sucker for their Greek salads and always get a big one for my meal.Also recently tried some red wine (they have several Greek wines) and loved it. The restaurant let me sample a couple of wines so I could pick one and both of the ones I tried were great, so I'll add a glass of wine to my next dinner here.I understand that the food is prepared by a group led by John's parents, who sometimes pop out of the kitchen to say hello.

Interior d\u00e9cor is nice, service makes the extra effort, but I vaguely recall a situation \u00a0where they don't really do substitutions.I recommend this place nonetheless- not many Greek options in the area, but also doesn't get too busy and service/food quality has been consistent across several visits."], ["Troy K.", "Good food, great service.

I love Greek food, and while I am no expert, \u00a0the food and atmosphere was pretty authentic in my opinion. They have a variety of dishes, and I love that, for the most part, you can modify any dish to get just the right combination of food that you want to try. They have amazing kabobs and a serious slice of baklava (seriously it's huge). I am pretty positive they make all the pastries there at the restaurant as well. Also, the owners are typically there serving and making sure everyone is happy. I was tired after work when I ate here once. I think probably for a few minutes while eating I had a look of blankness on my face, and the owner quickly came out to make sure that everything was okay and that I was happy with my food, haha. Very sweet people. \u00a0We sat on the patio which has a ton of greenery and is just really pretty. The actual restaurant is decked out with Greek paintings and a very beautiful mural on one of the center walls. I saw some flyers for a belly dancing night, so I bet that would be a lot fun. Otherwise, if you are in the mood for great Greek, this is the spot."], ["Nathan W.", "A must try Greek place! I don't see how some people complained about this place!

Saganaki! Spanakopita! Mousaka! Hello old friends, I've been searching San Antonio for so long! The gyros were really good as well.

John the Greek's homemade cucumber tzatsiki is the most amazing thing ever to happen to a gyro. Seriously a traditional gyro with perfect pita bread then with the tzatsiki equals amazing!!! They also make homemade Greek salad dressing that is just as amazing. Compliments the fresh veggies perfectly. The hummus and pita bread is wonderful and delectable. Prices on the lunch menu are way reasonable for what you recieve.The service is always warm, fast, and amazingly courteous.Notice all the amazing. Yeah, totally deserved because the food and service is just plain amazing :0)Side note don't forget about dessert.

I really like their lunch/dinner combos, as they have put together combinations of almost anything you could want at a very reasonable price. The atmosphere is very casual, and tables for two up to tables for 10 are all equally well served. The decorations include a lot of travel posters and a nicely painted sky line, but it's not kitschy.

Belly dancing on Friday and Saturday nights."], ["Marie S.", "After driving past this place for three years now, we finally stopped in to give it a try - and we were glad we did!

The pricing was pretty great too!We don't usually get dessert, but the management was so nice and attentive that we sampled their baklava.

I went on a Friday night and they had a live belly dancer, which was pretty cool and created a fun atmosphere. My only compliant is that the music was a bit too loud and I found myself raising my voice to talk to my boyfriend despite us sitting in a small two seater table. Other than that, I think the service was great as was the food. I had the traditional gyro platter, which came with fries and soup. We also had the Saganaki as an appetizer with warm fresh pita bread, which was scrumptious. Prices are pretty reasonable which is also a plus.

Saturday nights they have a belly dancer so that's interesting to watch....we had to ask they turn the music down cause we could hear our own table and our server had to do the mad lean in to hear our order. It's funny to watch the men in the restaurant sneak looks at the belly dancer and quickly dart their eyes away! HehThe hummus is very tasty. They also gave us complimentary baklava, which was delicious! All of their desserts are Greek, of course, and homemade.

I tried the chicken kebabs, gyro meat, lamb shank, and lamb kebabs. The meat was moist and flavorful. The spices uses were evident in the taste, unlike other places that don't have a similar full bodied flavor. The lamb shank was \"fall off the bone\" soft, juicy, and perfect in temperature. The food took about 10 min and you just pick it up when they ring a bell. You order food at the front, like a cafeteria. The meal comes with pita bread and yogurt/garlic/cucumber dip. The bread tastes fresh and soft, while the dip has a creamy fresh flavor, a hint of garlic and cucumber. Not as strong as the Greek tzatziki. \u00a0A small side salad and choice of three rices are available. I chose the green lentil one, which was a punch of delicious flavor. The black eyed peas one was also very delicious, though more hearty. The only sadness I experienced was the baklava, which did not taste homemade. I would not recommend ordering it. An assortment of pickled garlic and drinks were available. I tried the regular yogurt drink and its taste was similar to a liquid, salted cottage cheese.

I had one of the daily specials, a beef and eggplant stew called gheimeh bademjan. I'm a sucker for eggplant, so I figured I'd like it. But it was absolutely outstanding! Our plates also included a creamy salad, lots of pita and a bowl of yogurt dip with tons of garlic and dill.The guys behind the counter were friendly and happy to explain the various menu items.

I am not a big fan of these because they typically have a lot of food laying around (I've worked in restaurants before, so I know). Our hunger supplanted the decision to switch - which ultimately turned out to be a mistake.First: The owner is somewhat abrupt and blunt. Kind of like the soup-nazi. Second: The food is sub-par. I'm sorry, but you can get a much better quality gyro for the same amount of money. I think my opinion is biased because I live in Vancouver where the choices for these restaurants are bountiful. What makes this restaurant popular is the portion size to the amount of money you pay. The water also tastes funny (beware).Pros: Good wedge fries.

They have four or five different styles of rice, which range from green lima bean rice to basmati, jasmine, or other flavors. I got the combo plate, which had lamb and beef gyro slices with a yogurt cucumber sauce that was delicious! (They make their own yogurt) It was tangy and paired quite well with the gyro. It came with pita bread side, and a salad made mainly of onions and tomatoes. In all, the food was fantastic! I was quite impressed by the varied menu, they've got over 30 dishes. The dining room is painted up to look like you're lounging in the Italian or Turkish coast. Interesting pictures of random Middle Easterners set the tone for a vary cultured meal. The staff was very nice, and let us sample the pickled garlic, which was quite good. I had never had pickled garlic before this, but was quite glad I tried it. It wasn't as overpowering as fresh garlic, it had a more subtle taste. They had multiple sauces to take out to the table, so keep an eye for that if you dine in.

Though the name is \"mediterranean\" grill, it seems a bit more Israeli.As we walked in, we were offered samples of the falafel- it's not the best but it was okay. Boyfriend, who has much higher standards, said it was awful, but I think he was overstating things. In any case, I ordered more as a side and though he didn't eat them, I did.Bf ordered the laffa with chicken schwarma- it basically looks like a giant burrito, and is warmed in a giant tortilla press, not unlike Chipotle. In fact, the entire set up reminds me of a slightly ethnic Chipotle, but I digress.Laffa was filled with hummus, tabbouli, lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad, the chicken, cabbage, and a few other tasty goodies, then he was offered sauces- and went with the tatziki. Said his food was delish, and consumed it all, complete with a soda and an apple (one of their sides).I went a bit more all-out and got the chicken kabobs (originally wanted half and half, which I was told was okay, but then the guy manning the grill said it would be 20 minutes and he didn't seem thrilled about it, so I let it go) with sides of hummus and the cucumber-tomato salad, then subbed tabbouli for the rice and added the aforementioned falafel. This all came with a pita bread, which neither of us ate but it smelled good. The chicken was a little dry but the grilled veggies were amazing and had a great char on them. Other sides were fresh and flavorful, as mentioned before.The only downside to our visit was that customer service was a little lacking- as I referenced above, the guy working the grill seemed put off that I wanted to order an item that wasn't ready yet. Nevermind the fact that we walked in at 6:30, which should be right in the middle of a dinner rush at any dining establishment. The other two employees were young girls, and while they didn't actually do anything wrong, they were a little immature and I was frankly surprised not to see anyone older- if anything, the surly male appeared to potentially be the closest thing to a manager, which does not at all reflect well.

The food is reasonably healthy and there are a decent amount of choices.

The customers also get a huge portion for the amount that they pay. Also, they honored a yelp certificate on spot. Picked up five delightful little morsels as well as a drink for free!!!"], ["Andrew P.", "This is a long-ass review. If you don't want to read the whole thing, here is what you need to know:1. Basically a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. This is not a bad thing.2. Food is very tasty. DO get the dolmas. DO put hummus on your pita or wrap. DON'T get the kalamata olives.3. Reason it didn't get more than 3 stars is because a lot of the menu items were not ready to be served, including their prominently featured soup. I attribute this to the fact that I came here on New Year's day at 9pm. I will be back, because I expect the negative things to improve if I visit on a normal day.4. One steak pita + one steak pita combo which came with dolmas and a fountain drink = $19. Probably a bit steep, but not horrible.Full review below:Came here at 9pm on New Year's Day. Probably not the best timing, but I wanted to try something new.Immediately upon walking through the door, I got the impression that this was simply a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. Turns out that was a pretty accurate guess.First, you choose how you want your Mediterranean food to be prepared. You get the choice of a Pita (like a hollowed out tortilla), a wrap or a plate There is also a skewer plate, but it felt like \u00a0a secondary menu item and I didn't even factor it into my decision. The guy behind the counter suggested that my girlfriend and I get the plate since we were first-timers, but we both got the Pita because WDGAF. The menu tells you the calorie count of each item, which I thought was nifty.The bread for the wrap and the pita can be either white or wheat. They were out of white, so we had to go with wheat. I would have ordered the wheat anyway, but it really irked me that they could be out of white pita bread at all.Next you choose your protein. If memory serves you have the choice of chicken, steak, either one of those with falafel, just falafel, portobello mushroom or hummus. Being the adventurous diners that we are, we both picked steak. At this point, the employee peered into the ingredient trays and realized they were out of steak. One of the employees scurried into the back room to grab two delicious-looking slices of steak and toss them on the grill. We were told it would be about 5 additional minutes for the steak to cook. This was fine, and I chalked it up to the fact that it was New Year's day.After this, you select your ingredients just like you would at Chipotle. Lettuce, vegetable mix, hummus (definitely get the hummus), and so on and so forth. There are some ingredients that cost extra. I opted for the kalamata olives and the feta cheese. I do recommend getting the cheese, but I will avoid the olives next time. They were very salty and each bite with an olive was completely and totally overwhelmed by salty olive flavor. On their menu was a huge ad for some tomato/feta soup. It sounded pretty tasty and it was a chilly night, so we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, they were out of the soup, too. The employee said \"I can give you some but it will be cold.\" which was kind of a poor effort in my opinion. I opted not to get it, and was feeling increasingly annoyed by the lack of preparation despite the fact that it was a holiday.I got the combo, which comes with a fountain drink (Pepsi products...WHY does any restaurant do this?) and a side of your choice. I picked the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).We sat down and waited for a while since our steak was still cooking. We took this moment to discuss how doofus-y the staff was, but that we ought to cut them some slack since it is New Year's day. They brought us our food, but failed to bring the dolmas, which I pointed out and they promptly corrected. The pitas were excellent, but I would have been more content if the ingredients were more evenly distributed throughout the pita. All of the steak and tzatziki sauce was stacked right at the opening of the pita. After that came the rice, then the vegetable mix, olives and lettuce. The hummus was spread throughout, which helped make up for the distribution problem because it was delicious. The dolmas were top-notch. I could have eaten ten.Overall, our experience here was positive. Far from perfect, but definitely not bad. Had we visited on a busy day, my guess is that our food would have been ready about as quickly as I could order it. Flavor-wise, the pita's were very satisfying, except for the preposterously salty olives, and like I said, the dolmas were very, very good. The $19 price point was a bit high, but not enough to turn me off. We will be coming back with higher expectations."], ["Timothy H.", "First went to one in Colorado Springs, CO and didn't realize it was a chain until hearing about one in San Antonio. SO glad we have one now! I love this place...super reasonable (less than $20 for 2 kids and 2 adults).

The food isn't screaming with flavor, but it does have the sounds of great flavor. Thankfully there many options of sauces and extras make everything just right.

The flavors were alright and the pita was cold, hard, and dry. I also tried falafel when I walked in and it was mediocre. At least now I know.

Upon entering we had already lowered our expectations a little, to be honest. This was not due to the place being dirty or anything, we just had expected a full service sit down joint, since we had not bothered to read the reviews completely before showing up. \u00a0;-POkay, this place way exceeded our expectations! Just like in Joey's review, the employees were very helpful and friendly. \u00a0They made suggestions and advised us on how to get the most bang for our buck. My wife and I both got a plate dinner and made it a combo, which allowed us to also get a drink and an additional side item. The plates came with the protein of our choice, rice, hummus, vegetable salad, pita bread, numerous add ons, and for our side items we both chose Dolmas. Every part of the meal had amazing flavor and freshness!!! I kept looking at my wife and commenting on how good everything was, and how surprised I was! \u00a0Both of our meals came out to $20.55 w/tax, drinks included! \u00a0This just became one of our top new \"go to\" places! \u00a0They are open till 10pm nightly, so we can even go late if we need to!"], ["Trevor B.", "Terrible.

However, there has been a couple of times that they ran out of rice and the next batch wouldn't be ready for at least 35min. Same with pittas and falafels but those don't take all that long to make but it's still annoying. All the times that they have been short have been during non peak ours where there is no more than 3 people in the restaurant. It's a little ridiculous that they would be short on these items when those are the things that are highest in demand, they should pay better attention to when those things are running low since that's what everyone is there for!

I had heard from friends that this was a seriously delicious place and I was curious to see if the hype was true, but not so curious as to go out of my way to investigate. So one day after getting some shopping done at Trader Joe's across the way, and making the mistake of shopping while ravenously hungry, I decided I needed food and FAST. Hello, Zoes.First of all, when I walk into a new restaurant/eatery, I must apologize for doing the \"stare at the menu for ages\" thing, but when I have no idea what's on a menu, it's going to take some time. When the guy behind the counter asked what I wanted right off the bat, my response of \"I've never been here, so I don't know\" was met with excitement and so much helpfulness that I almost wept in appreciation. (Almost, I'm not that weepy.) He patiently waited while I looked at that menu for what seemed like ages and he did not dispute my choice of the Steak Strip sandwich with mushrooms, feta, and sauteed onions, served with a side of roasted vegetables.I went to sit down and wait on my food, which was delivered so quickly I must not have been paying attention (thanks, iPhone), and he courteously brought me napkins with a fork wrapped up. I shoved half of that delicious sandwich in my mouth in no time at all and the roasted vegetables were delish! I am fully impressed. Not only that, he was prompt in grabbing my a to-go box for the rest, and was super sweet in trying to stop me from bussing my own table (oops, I guess they do that for you?). In other words, just in case you haven't figured it out, this was an amazing visit.

I wanted to get the 6.99 Pick Two, but of course the fine print prohibited picking any sandwiches except from the two Classic choices...which were not appealing. So I settled having to pick the Grilled Chicken Mediterranean Pita with a rice pilaf as a side because the best side option (a side salad) raised the price even higher by a $1.60.

We were not acknowledged until they guy who was counting money nudged the other cashier. She did not greet us, she just morosely asked us what we wanted. She seemed incredibly bored and as if we were troubling her by giving her our order. Once again, we have been in this type of role with waiting and customer service, and we were both very disappointed.All but one of the staff seemed very bored, lackadaisical, and unhappy to be there. Our food took a long time, and we weren't impressed.The falafel tasted like it had been frozen. It was also in little cookie-cutter shapes. Definitely frozen. Definitely the worst falafel I've ever had. It wasn't BAD, but it was not good. It was like the White Castle of falafel. The fries were soggy, though we did enjoy the fact that they seemed to be fresh cut. The fruit was fresh and juicy. My husband and I both ordered the falafel, so that's all we can comment on and it was a disappointment.On a positive note, one employee was smiling and we noticed him asking other tables how they were doing towards the end of our visit. He thanked us as we left. If all of the employees had been like him, our experience (besides the food) would have been better. We didn't catch his name, but he was tall and had long black hair tied in a ponytail.

It's a chain, and I don't often have good feelings about chains, but I opted to stop here anyway. I'm glad I did.I ordered the falafel pita which is huge, and very delicious! The pita is scrumptious, and the falafel is nice and crispy on the outside yet still moist on the inside (yuck, I hate the word moist but my vocabulary is seriously lacking at the moment!). What I loved about Papouli's pita is that they put tzatziki and hummus in there ... I often have to request it or don't have the option at all. Both were very rich and creamy. The plates come with a side option, and I was super excited to see tabouli offered as a free side. The best part? It was divine! Fresh parsley, a good amount of lemon juice and a perfect ratio of tomato, bulgar, and parsley.

Another customer took our burger so they had to remake it. While we were waiting they sent out pita, hummus, and basil feta spread.

When I asked the cashier about this she was very rude and stated that 18.99 was the cost after tax (17.70 would be mathematically accurate) but I also noted that the subtotal was taxed again.

It's a localized chain and obviously everyone's go-to Greek place. Best gyro I've ever had? Not really... the best is back in Utah, but this is good enough. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. I'm still on my quest for the best gyro in San Antonio, my next attempt will be Jerusalem Grill... they aren't quite on the same playing field as Papouli's (business-wise), but they're a good mediterranean restaurant.Papouli's has some really good hummus, there's a variety of flavors (I like the jalapeno). The dessert is kind of disappointing, I haven't yet tried the baklava so I can't comment there but the custard thing with a very long Greek sounding name was a complete waste of money. My main criticism is it wasn't sweet and hardly had any flavor at all. It would probably have been better with honey drizzled over it. Another big criticism, they are a Pepsi restaurant."], ["Dee R.", "For a fast Greek place it's pretty awesome. Everything is cooked to order. And fresh very tasty and really fast .

This was served with Greek salad, tatziki, and I subbed hummus for potatoes. All three meats were nicely seasoned and still very moist.

He recommended the rolled grape leaves (Dolmades) for an appetizer and the Hercules platter for two. We were amazed with the flavor and freshness of both plates. The grapes were tasty and stuffed to perfection. The Hercules platter it's like a sampler for two. It includes gyro meat and two types of shishkabobs (beef and chicken) along with potatoes, two salads and pita bread. It was delicious and just enough for two! Don't forget to leave room for dessert.

All the other food is overpriced (compared to other places you can find now, aka darna down the street) and the meat is dry. Their garlic sauce is no good either.

I finally made it over there tonight when I was craving some Greek food. I ordered the gyro platter that comes with gyro meat, hummus, salad and bread. I also ordered an appetizer of the baba ghanouj. I ordered a few extra pita bread and I was shocked that they were going to charge me a 1.99 per pita. Little did I know that when I got home I opened the bag of bread and they have gigantic pita bread so good thing I told him to just give me the bread that comes with my meal!!! I was very surprised and very happy with the amount of food that my order came with! I couldn't even finish my whole entire meal! The food is also very delicious and I cannot wait to go back and order something different!!"], ["Sherry Y.", "The absolute perfect combination of professional, efficient service and delicious, rich food with just the right amount of nutrition to prevent you from feeling too guilty. I was a bit skeptical to find authentic, affordable Mediterranean food in San Antonio, but Pasha put my wariness at ease immediately upon entering the spacious, elegant restaurant. With several seating arrangements in an alcove inner area to two-person window seats and generous family seating, Pasha has something for everyone desiring a festive, easygoing ambience. Our server gave us just the right amount of wait time before taking our order, and served us in less than 10 minutes flat. It was the most carefree dining experience I have had in a long time. She made us feel cared for, but not sheltered like some looming waiters often do.Food-wise, we were enticed by the free bread laid out in all its toasted glory with a generous dose of olive oil and herbs on the side. My date and I finished the generous loaf in less than a few minutes, reveling in its light yet crunchy texture. Steam rippled into the air as we scrambled to tear off pieces without looking like ravenous animals. (I say we semi-succeeded). It was just the right amount of cushioning in our stomachs before our delectable main courses. I had the chicken shawarma lunch wrap with a Greek salad on the side. The orange-tinged dressing on the salad gave just the right amount of acidity to the side greens, rendering them gone on my plate in a matter of milliseconds. The chicken in my wrap was juicy and smoky, just the right amount of heat added by a chili sauce lovingly wrapped by the warm embrace of the bread. Absolute perfection. My date had the equally tasty gyro wrap with tzatziki. I must say, it was a conflicting moment with so many amazing options on the menu.With great deals and moderate pricing, there is no way you can pass on such a warm establishment with friendly staff and killer food. I recommend this for anyone in San Antonio longing for a Mediterranean bite to eat."], ["Matt M.", "Pasha first and foremost has wonderful wait staff and incredible bread. The bread dipped in the oil and herbs dipping sauces or chili and oil sauce is enough to make a meal. You might as well order your kabob to go because once you taste this bread you are not likely to stop short of maximum stomach capacity. The kabobs are delicious, the vegetables fresh. The teas are especially good, with the rosewater tea being the best we tasted. We'll be back again soon."], ["Lady R.", "For all the folks who have been in SA for a while, this is the old Taco Cabana and old SombreroRosa restaurant. It looks kind of eh from the outside but inside is a nice restaurant. You get seated by a host and waiter comes to your table. We weren't expecting that. This place has to go too where you just pay when you enter. We got the trio and the number 1. I think one of their most popular plates is the number 1. We got a huge pita that was piping hot. Tip: mix your mound of spices In with the olive oil. Those spices are amazing! Great for snacking and great with the meal. I really liked their hummus and Greek salad. The chicken was very dry and the beef was just ok. I did like their lamb sausage. I love seeing a Mediterranean place close by so keep up the good work Pasha!"], ["Alisha M.", "\"Is there anything else I can get you; because you're done eating and people are waiting...\"If you enjoy being insulted during your dining experience then head on over to Pasha off of Wurzbach road! You can suck on ice when your beverage runs out and be shooed out the door once you're done with your meal. Truth be told, the food is good. I've been a regular customer for the past five years but after today's service I will NEVER return. The service has been on steady decline for the past year and a half and today my friend and I were literally asked to leave because we were done eating. If you want to try this place, go for it but order it to go and save yourself the metaphorical kick in the ass. You'll probably do a better job refilling your drink, anyway."], ["Jenny V.", "Delicious. Tzaziki sauce was to die for! Staff was friendly and offered several recommendations and samples. Very timely despite it being the lunch rush. Great atmosphere."], ["Eliseo R.", "Visiting from Laredo. Food was good. My food unlike my gf's, was a little cold. Besides good experience. Ok price."], ["Majed A.", "This restaurant gave me one of the worst customer service experience ever ! I made a to go order and I went home with my order not knowing that my order is missing the rice and bread and that they gave the wrong salad. Came back thinking that they will meet me with a sincere apology. Instead, the server denied giving me the wrong salad even though I was holding the wrong one in my hand when I entered. I have to ask her to apologize at least for the trouble. She did with a clear heisted way. I wish I brought the food with me then I would have returned it and took my money back. I am feeling bad to even give them 1 star! \u00a0The food was ok and does not worth the trouble. I don't recommend it."], ["Brian F.", "Stopped by here on 06DEC14 and had a great time. \u00a0The waitress we had I don't think could've been nicer, more attentive or knowledgable of the menu. \u00a0She was solid at her job. \u00a0My family of 5 ordered all different things, some at the suggestion of the waitress. \u00a0We had hot bread and oils brought to the table to start with and the size of the bread was enormous. \u00a0Everyone enjoyed their meals and the hummus was probably the best I've had. \u00a0We stopped by Pasha between hospital visits and fortunately were able to relax a bit and take our minds off of my uncle in ICU. \u00a0I'm definitely going to revisit Pasha again."], ["LariZa S.", "I am about 6 and 1/2 months pregnant and Mediterranean food is all I've been craving. \u00a0My friend took me here for lunch once and now I have to have Pashas at least 2x/a month! \u00a0I order the Gyro lunch plate... it's a perfect size and the Rose Tea is a nice compliment."], ["Tina R.", "Don't be fooled by the cover. This place is really good. A well maintained interior that's nicely appointed, with friendly & efficient service we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The braised lamb shack is served in an stewed okra, tomato, onion mixture loaded with Mediterranean spice-wonderful! The shawarma trio was just that, each meat perfectly prepared. The hummus was perfection. Greek salad also very tasty. And the naan...oh, the naan! Served with spice & olive oil, it's truly the best complement to the meal. Step outside your comfort zone & give this place a go!"], ["Ivy T.", "Loved their huge fresh naan they brought out. \u00a0They continued to bring out fresh naan especially when you out. \u00a0I ordered the shawarma combo platter which included salad, hummus, gyro/chicken shawarma/beef shawarma, and three different sauces. \u00a0I preferred the gyro meat overall. \u00a0I wanted to try their cardamom ice cream but they ran out. \u00a0Next time! \u00a0Excellent service and to top it all off, the waitress gave us fresh naan when we took our left overs home (which was delicious the next day)."], ["Marissa T.", "I love this place. The food is always good and the servers are always nice. Meals are served quickly if you are in a hurry but you don't feel rushed if you are trying to enjoy a nice dinner. I love the huge naan with oil that is served before the meals. It is always very fresh and delicious. It does get a little crowded/noisy here in the evening and on weekends but it isn't too bad."], ["S S.", "Wow this place is great we prefer the chicken and beef swama ? But the service is the key to 5 stars ! The food humus , naan bread um um"]]}
