The window clearly says Mon-Sun 11am-10pm. Yet as I got out of my vehicle, Another gentleman about to enter the restaurant and myself were greeted by a woman with a 'Sorry, we're closed'. She quickly recoiled into the door to lock it, and the man with her was reaching up to turn off the light. \u00a0 \u00a020 minutes prior to close, for an order they typically complete in under 10 minutes. It wouldn't have taken them past their 10pm closing time, nor should that matter. \u00a0This seems to fall in line with some of the other reviews about poor customer service. I really hope they get their customer service issues in check. I dont know if I will be returning as this is definitely a pet peeve of mine."], ["David C.", "5 stars means \"as good as it gets\".

She continued grumbling and told us to do her a favor.. Do not ever come again..Fine, but my message to her, if you want your tip, you better work for it. And to the owner, beware of who you employ and the attitude of your employees.. Your food may be good, but don't let your service ruin your reputation.

I'd say the intestine was my favorite, it had a nice flavor and lots of spice. The lamb was good but the cumin was a little overpowering.

Where do I even begin with this review...Let me start by saying that we literally left them a $1 tip. Never in my life have I left that little of a tip for a bill over $50, but before you put your judging hat on, keep reading.List of complaints in order of occurrence:1) Waitress was telling us about the other location they just opened and when we asked where it was, she had no idea...awks.2) We begin ordering and almost every response from her was, \"Oh sorry, we're out of that.\" Out of the 5 dishes we initially order, they didn't have 3 of them... The waitress's response was that it was New Year's and there were a lot of people. Then she said \"You guys should have come earlier\" ?!?!?!?! I'm sorry, but did you just ask the customer to adjust to you? Also, if you are a restaurant that is open until 10 pm, you should have at the minimum, most (if not all) of your ingredients in stock at 8:30 pm or at least have the decency to tell your customers about your shortage before they start ordering. 3) When we asked for a rice refill, there was a little bit of rice still left in our container, and the waitress asks \"What did you want to do with the little bit that's left?\", implying to my dad that he should scoop out whatever was left. Normal people would have just gotten the refill. But then again, normal people would know where your only other location is or not blame it on the customer for being out of ingredients. 4) One of the dishes we got had more soup than actual solid food. It seemed like that was something else they ran out of and just dumped whatever was left. Did I mention it was our 2nd most expensive dish? 5) They put MSG in EVERYTHING, as if MSG was a garnish like parsley. Only good thing? They are authentic, not your Americanized Chinese restaurant.

The only thing is the tofu was a bit overcooked, but it was still good enough for me to eat it all!My boyfriend had the sesame chicken, which he orders at every Chinese/Asian fusion restaurant we go to, and he really enjoyed his dish as well. I asked him what he thought of it compared to the sesame chicken he gets as his most favorite place and he said it compared pretty well! Which means it must have been pretty good.

Bring an open mind, set aside any expectations you have about \"Chinese food\" and order something interesting!Please note that this is spicy food, but not in the immediate way that fresh chilis can make Tex-Mex hot, nor with the sweet-searing intensity of Thai food. Sichuan food seems to showcase the smoky, winey complexity of dried chilis against a complex and fragrant backdrop of other spices (star anis and Sichuan peppercorn at least, but other stuff I can't quite figure out). \u00a0This food unabashedly places savory and salty flavors front and center.In no particular order, I'd recommend dan dan noodles, bang-bang chicken, sesame balls, Chengdu style dumplings, Sichuan style wontons, crispy chicken with three chili, smoked pork with garlic leek, crispy pork intestine with three chili, stir-fried lamb with spicy sauce and cumin, and ma po tofu. \u00a0My absolute favorite is the smoked duck with ginger. \u00a0It's a bit of an outlier, featuring neither heaps of dried chilis nor the soulful, funky chili-oil-sauce-magic that lights up many other dishes on the menu. \u00a0In fact, there's not much to it at all: smoked duck sliced thin and stir-fried with leeks and lots of finely julienned fresh ginger. \u00a0Of course, I'd probably eat smoked duck directly out of a dumpster -- it's basically duck bacon, people! But this combination is a little bit magical. \u00a0The leeks bring a bright and crispy note to a dish that might otherwise be monochrome and monotextural, but the ginger is what really makes it pop. \u00a0That fresh, hot ginger flavor contrasts so perfectly with the deep, fatty smokiness of the duck...I don't know what else to say about this except \"total mouth party\".It falls short of five stars because the service is spotty. \u00a0I've never had rude or unpleasant service, but sometimes it's a bit perfunctory, which is odd considering that it's never very busy. \u00a0I see a lot of reviews here that have made a huge deal about listed dishes not being available. \u00a0I've run into that myself a few times, but I honestly don't think it's that big of a deal. \u00a0It happens occasionally at any non-McDonalds restaurant.So try Sichuan Cuisine! \u00a0They have plenty of recognizable Chinese-American standards on the menu, so the less-adventuresome among your party won't feel too lost, but this is heaven for adventurers looking to try something off the beaten path."], ["Chris B.", "I REALLY hate giving any place a 1star but this place needs to close down and clean the place up.

It was a good dish, just not quite as expected. \u00a0The green beans were well prepared, and my 20 month old couldn't get enough of them. \u00a0The same with the tea smoked duck. \u00a0It was very smoky, and almost bbq like. \u00a0When we told him it was duck, he grinned, kept gobbling it down and responded \"QUACK QUACK!\" \u00a0The dan dan noodles were nice, but again, not hot enough for my liking. \u00a0If you are in SA, this is probably one of the best chinese options out there. \u00a0If you are a fan of Sichuan cooking, this may leave you wanting.

Twice cooked pork intestine! damn right it was good.The pork intestine was beautifully cooked with a nice crispy outside and with the filing shining through quite well with a perfect sauce that hinted of hoisin, Xiaoxing, the tang of vinegar and bits of garlic and ginger. \u00a0The fish in hot sauce was a delight! One of the very few times that I have seen people take tilapia and elevate it to eatability. \u00a0This was big chunks of fish that had been dusted with cornstarch and deep fried and then added to a simple \"sauce\" that consisted of almost a milky broth probably thickened with mountain root starch, aged vinegar, ginger, leeks and what tasted like pea shoot leaves with cellophane noodles. \u00a0This dish had a nice warming heat and the fish just adding almost a silky bite. \u00a0The last dish was noodles with egg and tomato, which was literally noodles in a simple broth with eggs and tomatoes. \u00a0This sounded really simple but the combination of the slightly chewy noodle, soft egg and the almost sweet-sour tomato was quite good!Who would have thunk it that we would find close to authentic food in a random strip mall! \u00a0This place has been added to our Chinese rotation with Phoenix Cafe!"], ["Jerry R.", "Most of what I know of Chinese food is this Americanized version you see everywhere. \u00a0A friend has been telling me about this place for a while and I finally decided to give it a look. \u00a0The menu had all the usuals, beef broccoli, sweet and sour, etc. \u00a0There was another section of the menu called Sichuan Adventures that I found quite intriguing. \u00a0It had many dishes that I had never seen before. \u00a0I decided to be adventurous today, and go with something that I don't normally have at a chinese restaurant. \u00a0So I chose the special which was sliced beef in a spicy and sour broth. \u00a0The food was very good and seemed authentic to me. \u00a0It's definitely a departure from the chinese food I'm used to. \u00a0Whatever they're doing, I say keep it up. \u00a0I definitely plan on coming back to this place. \u00a0If you come here, you owe it to yourself to pick from the Sichuan Adventures menu."], ["Lisabeth G.", "First time to sichuan cuisine and I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0First off, very large portions. 2 to go boxes for me.

The only reason why I mentioned this was because the entire restaurant was dark. There were very few lights on and those that were on we're not very bright. The decorations were nice but there's just something very unappealable about eating lunch in a dark room.I'm not one to complain when it comes to service at an Asian restaurant, however, during my visit I think there definitely could have been more attention given to the guests. The 2 servers were sitting at a table talking while all their other guests had their food, which I honestly don't mind. But I had ordered some steamed dumplings that took a questionably long time to come out. When the waitresses finally did get up and go to the kitchen, I can only imagine they had just remembered my order and brought them out without any explanation or apology for the long wait.As for the food goes, I got the Kung Pao chicken and an order of the steamed pork buns, as previously stated. The Kung Pao chicken was good. I found 2 pieces of shrimp in my dish, which was okay for me but could have been potentially problematic for someone with a seafood allergy. The dumplings turned out to be much smaller than I expected but were also good. Only 2/8 of them had \"soup\" inside of them, another reason why I am led to believe they were a bit overcooked.All in all, this place is good for some decent Chinese food.

They were nice enough to change it to something else for me without a charge but the other dish was equally flavorless. So I drank my water which was the only thing that tasted good then left.

Turns out, after more visits and more exploration of the menu, it's really hard to order *wrong* here - zero misses so far.Spicy rice noodle soup with beef intestine has chewy, delicious intestine the texture of pressed tofu with rich, beefy, spicy broth that soaks into the rice noodles. Sauteed pea leaves are fresh, bright green to balance your meal. Eggplant in garlic sauce might be the best version I've had - even at my favorite places in LA, the frying was inconsistent and a few pieces would be undercooked; here, every piece is perfectly fried and flavored and my husband and I each had 4 helpings last time we ordered it (and still had leftovers - portions are HUGE). Tea smoked duck has crispy skin, intense flavor, and is pretty much one giant, pink smoke ring - some of the best \"barbecue\" I've had in Texas.I expected to find great food in San Antonio, but I did not even dare to hope for Sichuan food this good.

Personally, I don't think it's too different from the other restaurants in town, with the major exception of the Kung Pao Chicken. Since Kung Pao is the Szecuan region's biggest claim to fame anyway, it's only fitting this restaurant would do it perfectly. They actually make it spicy! Seems like it should a given, but all too many times I've been let down in SA, where I have essentially just ordered General Tso chicken under a different name.My usual order here is the Kung Pao, Dan Dan noodles, and pork buns, all of which are amazing. When I do feel like venturing out of the usual, I always turn to the \"Sichuan menu\" because they have the most authentic (and often spiciest) dishes in the restaurant. The Spicy Crab is my personal favorite on this menu, but I haven't tried anything I don't like yet!Bottom line: This is as authentic as you will get in San Antonio. This honestly ranks with some of the best Chinese I've eaten anywhere, and there is definitely a reason this restaurant has been held to such high acclaim by SA critics.

I feel like it was a little steep...especially considering the 3 items were pretty much desserts. \u00a0I thought it was weird that they used fillers like bits of broccoli, carrots, or even peas inside of their shrimp items. \u00a0That's not how it should be!!! \u00a0The sticky rice was a little dry. \u00a0They didn't have any steamed shrimp rolls...and I really wanted my turnip cake but it finally came out when I was already sick of eating. \u00a0I guess it is a good option here in SA, especially when dim sum is limited in the area. \u00a0It's decent if you're having a craving here, but not outstanding."], ["Ruben B.", "I love this place.

The wait staff is incredibly attentive and swift in meeting your every need. However, in the past couple of months I feel the quality of food has dwindled down a bit.

At least advertise it as calamari with spicy sauce. We used to get it all the time and the spiciness was actually in the batter, now they're just using plain batter. Also, my egg drop soup is a hit or miss, sometimes it has way too much msg or maybe its too much sesame oil. The egg and spring rolls are fantastic but beware they pretty greasy ;/ Catherine was a fantastic waitress! The dim sum is out of this world! So much to choose from! Make sure to get there early on Saturday or Sunday because there will be people already forming a line at 10:30am! What's awesome about this location is that they have a create your own stir-fry bar filled with beautiful items to choose from. Fill up your bowl and your waitress will take it to the cooks and bring you back something magical! I've had a tipping issue in the past where a waiter purposely or accidentally added a couple more dollars to his tip. On this specific occasion we did not get great service and had to correct many things. I called and spoke to a manager who was not very professional in handling my issue and offered to deduct the overage from my bill the next time I came in, I didn't care for this suggestion because why make all the fuss about a couple of dollars to not get the solution resolved in the end. Finally, he offered a free appetizer but was not apologetic about the incident and he did not say that he would speak to the staff about adding additional tips, which I wanted. They're music selections are always fantastic! Madonna, New Edition, NSYNC, and much more old school tunes play while you devour your meal. Despite issues in the past we still always give Golden wok many chances! We have too much history to give up on it ;)OMG THE FISH! They have these gargantuan fish in their wishing well!

We cannot have peanuts!!! The Curry chicken, which I ordered with no fruit, was loaded with raisins, pineapple, and, wait for it, peanuts. The chicken lo-mein had odd bits of beef and pork in it! One of our guests is Muslim and its freakin' Ramadan! The pepper beef was like eating a shoe, and yes, had peanuts in it! It all went in the trash! We went out for other food!I called back the restaurant and spoke to Charlie the manager who agreed the dishes were incorrectly prepared and apologized. I was satisfied with his input, then he said, 'next time you come in let us know and we will give you a few dishes on the house'. Really? You think I am falling for that? I asked for a credit for two dishes, sure he said, I'll take your credit card number and make its done. He took my card number but I know he will not fulfill his promise of a partial credit.Personally I am sick and tired of restaurants fleecing hard working patrons with sloppy work and food.

This place is not the best place I've ever eaten at, not by far! However, just like a man who's wandered the desert without a well from which to draw water, even the most luke-warm tap water is a welcome sight. It's always busy, but don't worry, they seat you and feed you fast. The shrimp dumplings are excellent, as are both the steamed and baked pork.

Great herbal aroma, silky eggplant, beautifully plated. Could have used more pork, but other than that, a stellar dish.The Tang Street Homestyle Clay Pot was a little less impressive: generous mix of pork, shrimp, and tofu, with veggies, in a savory sauce, but lacked any sort of wow factor. My sister is significantly less adventurous and opted for the kung pao chicken. Generous portion of lightly-breaded white meat, with few peppers and onions. Basic, well executed, good option for kids.Got the steamed dumplings as an app and should have forgone them- we had more than enough food as it was, and the dumplings were unremarkable. For a place that offers soup dumplings, I figured these would be well done but they were very average.All of the dishes we had came with choice of steamed or fried rice- both were fine. Would appreciate the option for brown rice in the future. Found it odd that none of the dishes were spicy at all, despite the pork/eggplant dish having a chili pepper next to it on the menu.

It's tucked back in a shopping complex which makes it a little difficult to find. The decor is plain and simple, certainly not high end Chinese, but maybe that's why it's affordable. My first taste is a hot and sour soup, served with crispy wonton. The crisps are a nice touch. The soup isn't the spiciest or sourest I have had, but the broth is a balance of savory and robust. My main dish arrives, and the lunch portion is abundant. I ordered General Tso's chicken, steamed rice and a Rangoon. It's piping hot, so you know it didn't sit around long. I sink in the first bite, and there are a lot of flavors pleasing the tongue. The chicken is fried well.. Not too crisp, not too soft. Veggies add color, but who are we kidding.. This isn't time for healthy garnishes. The rice sticks together nicely making it perfect for chopsticks eating... And it's quite soft. Rangoon is typical, but has enough cream cheese to compliment, instead of overpowering the crispy outside. You can tell they love the Fry Cook. He is the backbone of these dishes.

However, I do want to thank them for offering complimentary hot tea and two 10% dining gift certificates. As the organizer of the event, I felt I did a lot more than I should have done which was supposed to be the restaurant's responsibility. The restaurant miscalculated the bill b/c they said I gave them incorrect headcount (we had two vegetarians who shouldn't have been counted towards the bill). I don't think it is solely my responsbility to count how many are eating. Perhaps they should do that too as a business? They also said I should have been the one to collect money and ensure everyone pays. Really? As a result, there were two tabs short due to their fault when half of our party already left. One person in our party generously gave $20 when the rest of us were going to chip in. The restaurant said $20 was fine and we didn't have to worry about the remaining $12. We should thank you for that or for miscalculating the bill? I still think the eggplant dish is my favorite. It is very authentic and delicious. But I wasn't too crazy about the rest of the dishes. Wait, maybe that was b/c I didn't actually have time to eat. I was running around to request hot tea/water for our group, get chopsticks for everyone, etc. I was quite the \"waitress\" of the night. Shouldn't the restaurant have provided better service? Or perhaps I am too picky about my Chinese food. I can make my own so I certainly expect more when I eat out. The Peking duck was in no way to represent the real thing and I honestly didn't expect it to be.The restaurant recently changed ownership which might have affected their operations and the authenticity of the dishes. I'd say I can still find several dishes that are authentic but the rest were more of hit or miss.

I am not suggesting that the food isn't good as it was certainly very passable Chinese food. The claims that it is \"the most\" authentic in San Antonio seem to be unfounded, at least in this reviewers opinion. Tang Street offers up daily specials EVERY day of the week. This is always a bonus.

We actually only had to ask once for every item, before it was brought to us. As far as our check was concerned, we had no issues.

It was so bad that I didn't put any rice on the plate, or it would have been so oil-soaked it would have been inedible.

Reminded me of a place in Wuhan. Next we ordered the tofu boiled with sea cucumbers and the stir fried pork intestines with pickled cabbage. A true delight! Tasted dead on and like they do it in Shenzhen. Next up was mustard with pork tripe, Marco Polo soup, and steam pork buns. For those accustomed to Americanized fake Chinese food like Chop Suey, Lemon Chicken, and fortune cookies, they serve that as well.

I wouldn't say Phoenix's Chinese offerings are very authentic but I was certainly very satisfied on my second visit today. I first came to Phoenix at the beginning of 2013 before I relocated to SA. I ordered a noodle soup off the Chinese menu. It was OK, more like a 3 star. The portion was small for the price I paid. Also Phoenix is Cantonese style Chinese which is very different from what I am accustomed to eating growing up aka Beijing or northern style Chinese. Since I moved to SA, I have been reluctant to return to Phoenix. However because of a recent disappointing visit to Tang St, I decided to give Phoenix a second chance. I recommended this place to our Chinese professors' lunch club get together at work. Yea it is called the Joy Luck lunch club, J/K. Upon arrival, we got two pot of complimentary hot tea which is a plus. The owner/server only speaks Cantonese so I basically communicated with her in English. But I think she can understand mandarin. Three of us ordered the beef stew on rice and the other two ppl ordered beef stew noodle soup, all from the Chinese menu. My expectations were low but when I got my plate I was deff pleasantly surprised. First of all, the portion was big! I didn't even finish. Secondly, it was actually quite tasty! The beef was flavorful and very tender. They used Chinese broccoli instead of the American kind for this dish which is awesome in my book. I will take Chinese broccoli over the American one any day! The rice was decent too. Three of our group are originally from northern China and two are from southern China. Everyone all said their dishes were decent.

I come here often because it's relatively inexpensive and it's every close to my house, but I've had much better Chinese food in the San Antonio area. I usually get either the sesame chick or the sweet and sour chicken. They're both decent, if not a little bland. I prefer steamed rice to fried, and the steamed rice here is delicious if you add their hot oil to it. Their chicken egg rolls are also excellent, as are their cream cheese rangoons."], ["Davian A.", "This place is fairly good I recommend it if you'd like cheap Chinese food and moderate quality it's not that bad I recommend the lemon chicken"], ["CrystalMarie C.", "Honestly I really don't like a lot of Chinese restaurants in San Antonio but if I want Chinese food \u00a0I come to Phoenix Chinese.

Placed our order for cheese rangoons and enjoyed the quietness. Looking over the menu they have a great lunch and dinner special that comes with your choice of soup, egg roll, cheese Rangoon and rice. We ordered sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken from the dinner special. Our appetizer was great everything I was craving. Next we get to our meals; sweet and sour chicken was great nothing extra special, orange chicken on the other hand was a complete let down, it wasn't spice or sweet and tasted like soy sauce. I'm not much for complaining cuz we were making the best of our meal. Long story short I will not be eating there again.

The thing that keyed me to thinking that Phoenix is misunderstood is what I saw people eating as my family was leaving. Instead of ordering traditional Chinese cuisine, I saw people eating egg drop soup, egg rolls, lo mein, Sweet & Sour Chicken, amongst others. That is NOT what Phoenix specializes in, so don't judge them by that.Instead, my family enjoys the Duck, any of the veggies, stinky fish fried rice, walnut shrimp, and many other dishes at Phoenix.Additionally, who goes to a CHINESE restaurant and expects 5 star bathrooms or other amenities? I'm always surprised that they have cable TV there, much less bathrooms that are stellar.

He said ok- & even repeated back my order correctly. However, when I arrived to pick it up, it had no tofu. The woman at the front told me they don't do that. Um... I ordered what I ordered! I was on my way to work and had no time to correct the issue, not that I'm even confident they would, since they have a sign displayed \"no refunds on food.\" \u00a0Never go for Chinese if you want good customer service!

It may have something to do with my order being 45 minutes late. The staff only apologized and kept telling me it would be out soon. Never offering a discount or a reason for the delay. But it is a Chinese business. Besides the duck not being crispy, it had a bad after taste of freezer burn.Aside from the long delay and the duck, the rest of our order was very good, some of the best I've had in San Antonio.A word to the owners if their reading this, defrost the duck early and slowly, I'm sure you would have a better dish.

I also tried their Dim Sum and they were ok. Nothing great, the filling tasted pretty bad as well... I've had good Dim Sum at other places but this wasn't it. The Wonton soup was quite bland too and just didn't taste good. I probably wouldn't even call it Wonton soup, because my nearest cheap pickup Chinese place has better Wonton soup.The service was probably the worst service I ever had.

My faves included the congees, and some of the beef and rib dishes from the Chinese menu.Then they started overcharging, and when I asked to see the receipt, it was just some Chinese scribbles, and a shrug from the driver. Then the delivery times kept getting longer, then the portions smaller. Now I'm down to once a month, when I feel like actually picking up, or really slumming it and dining in.Seems they've tried a few changes over the past year, none of which are for the better except maybe for the new sign inside, surrounded by notices that a thimble of hot oil is now $0.50 and that if you get it in your head to take a drink home, they'll charge you for the cup.

I called back and spoke to the young man who had written down my order. He apologized, took down my name and said that he would include eggrolls and wontons the next time I ordered take out. No problem. Wrong. The next time I called to place an order and \"redeem\" my forgotten eggrolls, the woman was rude, dismissive, and said she could not honor it because she couldn't see my name written down anywhere (she said this BEFORE even asking what my name was.) She had no intention of honoring their previous blunder. Being that that the food isn't that great anyway, I cancelled my order and will NOT be ordering from Phoenix cafe again. This place has bad business practice and does not honor their word. The food here is just okay. It is your typical greasy chinese joint. I have picked up food from the restaurant once and vowed to never actually dine-in because the place looked dingy, dirty, and run-down.

The second best thing to do is check Yelp. :-)Some personal advice from the limited menu online:- Order a mix of meats, veggies, soups and other dishes to share. One dish per person is about right (leaning towards the generous side), but this stuff heats up pretty well.- I'm a big fan of the Chicken Corn Soup to start; it's like a hug in a bowl. Congee with Pork and Preserved Egg is a classic but a little less approachable.- The Salt Toasted Beef Ribs and Szechuan Beef Steak was great beef orders; both spicy. - Don't be afraid of the tofu dishes; they've been some of the best I've had.- White rice is served but consider rounding out your dishes with a carb, like a tossed noodle or fried rice.- Tell your waiter what you want and ask!

And as most holes in the wall go, what may be lacking in ambiance is usually made up for in quality and value. Hsiu Yu Chinese Restaurant delivers on both levels.Tucked away behind a gas station just off Hwy 410 in San Antonio, Hsiu Yu's ornately decorated fa\u00e7ade hints at the treats inside. With limited parking (unless you park next door in the deserted insurance company parking lot), and only enough room to seat around 50 patrons, Hsiu Yu definitely falls into the \"mom & pop hole in the wall\" category.While my dinner partner and classmate ordered a Tsing Tao beer, I settled on strawberry lemonade, which was advertised as \"using fresh strawberries\". At only $2.50 each, and with free refills, it was the best bargain on the drink menu. And yes, it was fresh, and very delicious.The menu at Hsiu Yu is its best asset. Four full pages boasting traditional and contemporary Chinese fare, ranging from a list of 10 appetizers of potstickers and fried wonton, to crab dumplings. Soups include egg-drop, sweet and sour, and a few others.Dinner entrees include various dishes of pork, chicken, beef, seafood and noodle dishes. The entire menu is color-coded, with red text indicating spicy, and black text meaning normal.Under the list of chicken items is a welcomed surprise: duck! Because duck tends to be quite pricey, most restaurants opt to keep it off their menus entirely. Hsiu Yu offers it in three different ways. I chose a half order of the crispy version (half-order, $12.00; full order, $32.00), which included white rice. My dinner partner opted for the shrimp and vegetable stir-fry ($12.50).The crispy duck was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of breading, and done so the meat held in all its natural juices. Diners can also order it Peking style, but make sure to call ahead to give the restaurant 30 minutes notice.Since the dinners were delivered to the table \"family style\", I was also able to try the shrimp-vegetable stir-fry. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, as were the vegetables, with the correct ratio of crispness to tenderness.Total bill for the duck, shrimp stir-fry, strawberry lemonade and two Tsing Tao beers was just under $40 without tip. Great food at a good price... something increasingly rare in the bleak, chain-restaurant landscape. Hsiu Yu has figured out a way to offer quality, great-tasting food at reasonable prices.

The meals are served with: a main dish, rice, and an egg roll that ranged from 7-8 bucks. I selected the garlic chicken and before I could even unroll the fork from my napkin the waitress returned and plopped down the dish in front of me. It was reminiscent of those \"Chinese\" places in any local shopping mall, you know; a ton of food that has been sitting until someone orders the mish mash. The chicken was really mushy and had no harmony of the cuts; it was quite apparent this creation was prepared in a batch type of process and then shoveled out when ordered. The garlic sauce was the basic mixture of corn starch and chicken broth that tasted like corn starch and chicken broth. The rice was stone cold with a mysterious funky yellow tinge to it. Last and yes least the egg roll tasted like a deep fried brown paper bag would with the innards comprised of stringy strands of limp cabbage. \u00a0When I went to pay Mama San she was busy yapping with someone, eventually she did grant me the honor to pay her.

That pretty much quantifies this joint; gross food with less than grateful service. Bottom line: if you have the urge to try this establishment think twice.

For those of you who are arguing that this place serves authentic Chinese food, you would only need to look outside on the window and see a tourist map of Taiwan posted from the inside to clear all doubts about the presumed \"authenticity\" of this place, unless you're one of those baseheads who've been otherwise brainwashed into believing nonsensical claims such as Taiwan being a \"special administrative region of China,\" in which case you should:1. get off my internetsand/or 2. not be eating out at Hsiu Yu because chances are your house plates the most authentic Chinese food in the whole city of San Alamo Antonio Heights.Okay, okay, no more academic/political tangents, I promise. The first thing you notice when you step inside the restaurant is its tightly shut blinds and the semi-romantic interior decor; of course neither of those touches had any effects on yours truly since I came here with two other males, (no offense guys, I just don't find men very attractive unless they're post-op or electing to become post-op) but the environment seemed very conducive to dining foods of sinitic origin. As I mentioned to one of my fellow diners as I was ordering, it's always a good sign when one can observe a plethora of spelling errors/deviations from accepted romanizations in the menu at a Chinese restaurant, (see: \"Engrish.com\") and I assume that would have been the case had I had ordered the \"Mooshee Pork.\" But since I didn't, it kind of renders my point moot, but despite having all the indications of an overly-Americanized Chinese restaurant, this place was refreshingly fresh off the boat, even to the kitchen workers who were speaking Taiwanese Mandarin instead of the usual Mainland Cantonese or Mexican Spanish that one would expect to hear in these establishments.Now on to the actual food.By this point, my smuggish expectations of being entertained with good Chinese food was infinitely close to nil, seeing as how one of my compatriots had ordered \"Curry Chicken\" and we were going splitsies on the entr\u00e9es. But this all changed the moment our orders were plated on our non-Lazy Susans and the food was laid in front of us like lambs to the slaughter; Hsiu Yu surprisingly did my favorite dish (Yu Xiang Qie Zi - Sichuan Spicy Garlic Eggplant) justice after miscategorizing it under the \"Pork\" section by making it surprisingly moist but not mushy, and adding a nice tangy zest to its usual spicy yuxiang flavor. Although the Asian in me would have rather preferred it be spicy as opposed to sweet/tangy, after being let down by countless Americanized restaurants on a dish so simple and ubiquitous (and perhaps the lowering of my own standards as a result), Hsiu Yu's rendition was a pleasant surprise.Although I did rag on my friend for ordering Curry Chicken in a Chinese restaurant, it was actually pretty well done -- the chicken, bell peppers, and onions were all adequately curry flavored, (which I should mention, isn't very hard to do) \u00a0unlike most Americanized restaurants that fail to achieve even this simple standard.We also ordered the (Yangzhou/Yang Chow-style) chicken fried rice, which I was about 80% sure that it was cooked in pork lard/some sort of shortening unbeknownst to one of my fellow kosher diners, and some fish dish which came with tangy orange sauce and sliced bamboo shoots and watercrest, all of which were delicious in their own right. All in all, this restaurant puts a great Taiwanese touch on American cuisine.PS. the reason why I couldn't name the fish dish we ordered was because my friend was flirting with the Tia Carrere look-alike that works here, who comped the dish into our order after he entrusted her to provide us with a \"good fish dish\""], ["John-Raymond B.", "Love this place!

Friends joke that I only leave my bubble for booze and cute boys. They might be right. So sue me.Anyhow, when deciding where to go for lunch today, I knew I wanted to stay in the bubble, but I also wanted to try a restaurant I'd never been to before. The first person that popped into my head was my friend, Michael. I know Michael through Twitter (@foodandhowtoeat) and I remembered one of his blog posts: Tour de Broadway. He listed many (if not all) the restaurants along Broadway in an attempt to visit every one of them. I have a similar, unofficial list going on in my head; I mentally note restaurants that SA Express-News Taste writer/reviewer/foodie extraordinaire Ed Tijerina writes/tweets about. While perusing through Michael's list of restaurants, I noticed Hsiu Yu and immediately starting craving Chinese food. Funny how that works, no? The prices seemed reasonable and the Yelp reviews were mostly positive, so off I went. I walked in and waited about 2 minutes before being acknowledged. In all fairness, there were several people crowded up front, so they may have been confused as to who was waiting to be seated, who was waiting for a to-go order, who was waiting to pay, etc. Once I was acknowledged, though, I was promptly seated. The waitress was efficient and when I couldn't decide between the sweet and sour pork or lemon chicken, she recommended the latter. Good choice. My food arrived quickly and hot. The lemon sauce also came on the side - bonus points! The chicken was tender and crispy and the rice was great and not overly-greasy. The eggroll was above average; I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. Even better - all this came out to less than $10 with tip included. I even took about half of it to-go, so the portions are definitely generous.When I went up to the front counter to pay, the lady behind the desk didn't look at me once and practically threw the pen and receipt for me to sign. As I was headed out the door, there was a female employee chatting with a guest picking up a to-go order, who seemed genuinely friendly, so I won't write them off completely.

Chang's and Mi Tierra's, where you have to know which is your soup spoon and which one is you salad one, it's nice to find places hidden on the beaten path. It most cases this is where the true flavor of our city resides. The Golden Kirin, a little gem hidden in a strip mall in Balcones Heights is such a place. \u00a0It's tucked away around by Planet Fitness and a Rent A Center. If you are not careful you will miss it. When you get there you can smell the sweet scent of Chinese Food cooking. Mind you this is not some place where there is some stuffy maitre'd. It is as basic and bare bones as a spot that you will find. It is small and quaint, but still there is room to sit comfortably without helping a patron with their Won Ton Soup. The decor of the place is pretty outdated and they were playing soft rock over the restaurant, but not annoyingly loud. It does seem a bit beat down, like this place has seen better days. Our server came and brought me a menu. The menu itself is pretty simple and basic: veggie delight, pork, orange chicken among some other items. I noticed that the prices for plates and everything else was cheap and affordable. So I ordered the Lemon Chicken( Que typical!)And the service? Well, it was excellent! The server was very attentive and never rushed you to make your order. The food came out nice and hot and more importantly it was Fresh! What makes it so awesome was that I saw the same server a few minutes later taking care of a table with a party of twenty people and did not even flinch. And two seconds later he had a pitcher ready to refill my cup with water. And yes, the food was pretty darn good!  My only critique is that you have to pay extra if you want fried rice in lieu of the steamed one that comes with your plate, other than that there were no other complaints I had.So if you want to go to place where the chef throws a knife up high in the air, then catches it and cuts your shrimp. Or you expect to see the same pan your desert will be served in to be torched into a thousand fiery flames by a cook, this might not be the place for you.

The server took a few minutes to come with drinks, we were ready to order but she had to go deal with other times too, so she came back again a few minutes later. The food came out in a quick and timely manor, however it was sub par. The sweet and sour pork came to me cold, the breading on the meat was soggy and lacked depth of flavor, the sauce drenched everything and was too sweet in my opinion.

They were too busy to come back for refills on drinks until we were basically finished eating which didn't sit well with me either.I'd say overall for getting a lunch special with fried rice, an eggroll, and a tea for $5.30 is a great deal, but for the hassle of waiting in a busy line and the unsatisfying meal I will not be back again."], ["Mark F.", "Typical Chinese fare.

I'm not sure if Joe still owns the place, but I've known him since I was little and he is a great guy. My all time favorite is the sweet and sour pork. It's not that typical style that has more batter than pork, but tasty, lean pieces of pork in a great sweet and sour sauce. Great egg drop soup too.

I don't need to add any extra seasoning to the dish. Not even soy sauce. Ok, hot sauce, but that's a condiment. Kristine is very polite on the phone. I've never dined in. Just buy their friggin lo mein already. I'm from metro NYC, grew up on ethnic Chinese, and Southeast Asian food, and I vouch for it.

Because this place is seriously LEGIT.GENEROUS PORTIONS OF TASTY FOOD * * * * * I wasn't mad at the prices upon first glance at the menu, just hopeful that the dishes would actually live up to my hyped up expectations, and taste good. Dinner entrees & Sichuan tapas range between $4 and $18 so there is a wide variety of delicious dishes to choose from.I didn't know what I was in for. WE didn't know what we were in for. But when those dishes started hitting the table one by one, we were seriously blown away. Just look at my pics if you don't believe me. Every dish that we savored (hot & sour soup, lo mein, tea-smoked duck, Sichuan braised pork, etc.) were ALL totally shareable among at least 3 or 4 people. Family style is always the best since you get to sample (or in this case, INDULGE) in everyone's dish. For the die-hard \"Americanized Chinese\" fans, they do have a couple of dishes that may appeal to your fancy. Thankfully for us though, they didn't have any of those dishes available on that Sunday afternoon that we first encountered Sichuan House, so that totally allowed us to go out of our comfort zones and sample things we probably normally wouldn't have ordered.ATTENTIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE * * * * *Probably some of the best, most attentive customer service we have received in a long while. We counted at least 3 people around at all times to fulfill requests including our waitress, Kristina, who was just absolutely amazing. She is so passionate about the food and very focused on providing an exceptional experience for all of her guests. As you can see from my pic, they do have an aerator for wine accommodations. Now what could be better than some tasty, authentic Chinese dishes with a side of some BYOB?EXTREMELY REASONABLE PRICING * * * * *As you can see in my receipt pic, you will not break the bank eating here. As a matter of fact, you will more than likely have lunch for the following day if you over-order food, like we very gladly did. Bring your friends and family here and prepare to be amazed at the dishes that are about to make your taste buds sing!I can't stress enough how much of a 5-star experience Sichuan House is, and I am pretty ungenerous with my 5-star reviews. If you go expecting fine dining, you will be disappointed, but if you go expecting some of the tastiest dishes you have eaten before, coupled with fantastic service, you will leave very pleasantly surprised!"], ["Susan C.", "YES!!!! None of the Yelpers exaggerated. Sunay- let's invest in those stretchy pants. Who cares when you're eating food this good. Of course we ordered too much food. Appetizers: crispy pork dumplings and the cold noodles. No one told us the bowl of noodles feeds a small army. I went with the dongpo braised pork belly everyone seems to describe as an out of body experience. Kristina described the cooking process to me. Why isn't this dish more expensive? \u00a0Wait, don't give them any ideas. The current prices are so very reasonable. The reviews are correct, but don't do the dish total justice. You have to taste this to believe it. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. The husband went with the lamb dish. Bits of garlic and onion and all-around great flavor. We took some of that home as well. I've said this before, but when I see Asian folks in an Asian restaurant, I know it will be good. This place should make your list of top Asian restaurants in San Antonio.

This place is just that good!It is an extremely rare event in my life when I go to the same restaurant more than once in the same week, much less more than once on the same day. I like a lot of variety in what I eat and so does my wife...Well, last Friday, I ate at Sichuan House for both lunch and dinner. My team at work, completely on their own, and with no suggestions from me, chose to have lunch at Sichuan House again (our second time here as a team). I did not want to even influence the food choices and let the team choose what sounded good to them. I'm so glad I did! They ordered a few things that I had not yet tried at Sichuan House, like the eggplant and the Spicy Tangy Fish Soup. We had quite a few other dishes which I was already familiar with, but the two that pretty much everyone on our team of 11 people liked was the eggplant and the fish soup. Unfortunately, we ordered only one order of the eggplant, and that disappeared quickly! The fish soup was a very large bowl and people were already getting full, so 4 of us just kept eating that at the end of the meal because it was so awesome.And when I got home after work I was telling my wife how fantastic the eggplant was, so yep... we headed there for dinner! At dinner, since it was only two of us, I got plenty of eggplant and we even had some left over. My wife commented more than once that the eggplant was her new favorite dish at this restaurant! I just can't say enough good things about how much we both love the food at Sichuan House and Kristina! No matter how busy the place is, she always finds time to come around and check on us and ensures everything is to our liking. My biggest fear now is that Sichuan House is going to become so popular that it will be hard to get a table sometimes! I'm glad they are being so successful, but I also don't want them to become inaccessible due to mad popularity! I guess that's a good problem for them to have though."], ["Bill N.", "This place once again delivers. Lunch today was a sensory overload of umani. \u00a0A group of four ordered Water boiled beef - omg don't let the name deceive you. The best stuff we ordered. Pea sprouts - \u00a0seasonal - light and garlic blast on the tongue. Sichuan house tofu - \u00a0awesome I would not miss eating meat. Sichuan bacon- delicious as well, did I mention the boiled beef broth was amazing. As long as they deliver authentic I will be there with all my friends and colleagues.Of all the three times I've been here I have yet to get a bad heartburn, apparently they are really good at keeping their oil fresh, definitely a plus with any Chinese restaurant."], ["Nancy N.", "I consider myself pretty healthy - consuming only calories I deem worth it. So when everyone raved about the pork belly at Sichuan House - I was dubious. It's pieces of fat. Pure jiggly fat. But that didn't stop me from ordering the dongpo braised pork belly. I prodded the jiggly cubes with my chopsticks and picked one up. The fat was so pillowy, any additional pressure with my chopstick grip would have punctured the little cubes. So after some maneuvering I put one in my mouth and closed my eyes. You guys... This was life altering. It melted in my mouth and the only flavor left was the richness of the fat and sweet sauce. The sauce! It was sweet and complex. So much flavor in every bite. I savored the pork belly alone and finally I had it with rice. My friend mashed hers up in rice and poured the sweet sauce over. Any way you eat it, it still tastes awesome. Like a fine piece of foie gras... Only better. This dish alone merits the praise this restaurant is getting. We also got the combo chilled tapas (beef, sesame beef and pork ears... Thanks for the coupon yelp!). The flavors were really intense. It was not too spicy (despite all the peppers covering each morsel of meat). It was just extremely flavorful. Weirdly enough, the pigs ears were my favorite. They had an awesome flavor. I also got the crispy and spicy chicken. There was an equal amount of chicken and dried peppers. The chicken was cut pretty small and fried. I wish there was more chicken but it still tasted great. I loved the little peanuts in all the dishes. They were flavorful and fun to bite into. My friend ordered the garlic pork. This dish was our least favorite. It was incredibly funky. Way too much vinegar for our tastes. But we know this is authentic (one of our friends who comes from this region of China swears this is the most authentic Sichuan cuisine in San Antonio). I ordered a hot tea - they served loose leaf jasmine, which is a huge bonus in my book. I hate going to chinese restaurants and getting bagged teas. The waitstaff was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. We were lucky to come during non peak hours so we got seated right away. The restaurant just opened so it's very clean. The food is good (pork belly!!) and the ambience is great."], ["Melissa M.", "Update:Came with a group of friends last time and they agreed this place is a lot better than the other Chinese options in San Antonio. I'm glad we came early because this place was significantly busier than the last time we came. By the time we left the restaurant on a Friday night, it looked like there was a wait. I ordered the water boiled beef last time and although I still prefer the dongpo pork belly, this dish was still pretty tasty. I don't think I can recommend it if you can't handle spicy though. This dish had a slight numbing feeling that wasn't too overwhelming for me, but moderate and tolerable. Apparently this is very typical of Sichuan cuisine and at some restaurants the numbing is even more prominent, so I'm glad it was more toned down here according to my friends. The dish was very flavorful and there was a good amount of veggies. If you want to try something uniquely Sichuan, this is a good dish to start with. My friends seemed to enjoy this dish more than me though, but I'm not Chinese and they are. The fianc\u00e9 ordered the salt and pepper shrimp and it was also flavorful and executed well. Another crowd pleaser. My friends ordered the mouth watering chicken as an appetizer. It was entree size HUGE. Again, if your not a huge fan of spicy I wouldn't order this. This was the spiciest thing I had so far and it was a bit over my edge with the all the spicy pepper. The chicken was very flavorful though, but had a lot of bone. On another occasion I tried the SPICY WONTONS! So far it's my FAVORITE appetizer on the menu. PROTIP: If you are craving a veggie side try the SEASONAL VEGGIES on the menu! They have a variety of vegetables, but I recommend ordering the chinese PEA SPROUTS!! It's garlicky goodness and tastes delicious for vegetables. I don't think many Chinese restaurants offer it in San Antonio. I plan to try some of the less adventurous dishes when I come back like the kung pao chicken. ---I'd have to say this is the most authentic and tastiest Chinese restaurant in San Antonio by far. It's on par with some of the Chinese places I've tried in the Los Angeles / San Gabriel valley area in California, which such a big step up from what the Chinese restaurants we currently have in San Antonio, so it definitely deserves 5 stars. The ingredients are fresher and lighter than most of the Chinese restaurants in town. I ordered the Dongpo pork belly and it was TO DIE FOR! My fianc\u00e9 was raving about it the whole time as well. The sauce was really tasty and the pork belly was melt in my mouth good. It was VERY TENDER. I'm a tough critic for pork. In general I don't like to eat pork unless It's from my favorite bbq rib place in San Diego, so the fact that I enjoyed this dish so much means that the pork was prepared really well for me. The sauce compliments the pork really well. I liked how they paired the dish with bok choy, which was also cooked well. I like that they gave me some veggies to go with my big slab of pork. The dish is huge and there is enough to share for at least 2-3 people. It's a great value for the price. Our waitress Kristina was great and you can tell she is passionate and knowledgeable about the food they serve. We finished off with a complimentary tofu type dessert. The desert was very interesting in a good way. The tofu is made fresh in house from soybeans. Very unique. I think that's really going the extra mile and I appreciate the pride they take in their ingredients here. The prices are very fair for the portion size you get here. The dishes are about $9-13 and can easily feed 2-3 people. The location of the restaurant is near Ingram mall is a non-impressive strip mall and parking can get a little cramped, but it wasn't a big deal to me.Overall, I can't wait to go back and try more things off the menu and will be updating my review as I try more things. Anyways if you want the tastiest and most authentic Chinese food in San Antonio COME HERE! You won't regret it!"], ["Sunay P.", "I cannot wax rhapsodic any more than the other Yelpers have already.

This place elevates this humble entrail to realms of deliciousness that you cannot imagine. \u00a0The pieces retain the slight funkiness so you know what you are eating, but yet are transformed into delicious morsels in every dish that you can get them in. They show spectacularly well in the dry Mongolian hot pot which is a bursting amalgamation of flavors that range from slightly funky sour to the tingly heat that is typical of sichuan peppercorns. \u00a0To top this all, they are also expert at prepping vegetables. All the vegetable dishes are excellent (thought the eggplant does tend to be greasy...but then eggplant is just a sponge for oil anyway) and well made and the are shows through very well.Go with a large group and order the entire menu!

Everything was still really tasty (see below), and the service was really wonderful. After sitting down and ordering, our food came out in under 10 minutes! Our waitress was also great! She really knew the menu backwards and forwards and had a lot of knowledge about the cuisine. She also went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and to accommodate our needs. As for the \"atmosphere\", this is a very casual restaurant, much like the Chinese restaurants in Houston Chinatown. Food:Twice-boiled pork: AMAZING! I highly recommend this dish to everyone. The pork belly was cooked to a really tender texture that melts in your mouth, and the taste is really fragrant and wonderful.Spicy wontons \u00a0(appetizer): In the usual Sichuan restaurants, these \"wontons\" would be a cross between a wonton and dumpling. However, at Sichuan House, wontons really do mean wontons. They were still really good, but not what one would normally expect.Boiled Spicy Fish Filet: Again, compared to normal Sichuan restaurants, this dish wasn't made in a way you would expect. However, the fish was still cooked really well, and the vegetables were all very tasty. The sauce itself was a bit thicker than what I would like, but still very tasty.Eggplant: Fantastic! I really enjoyed this dish a lot. If you haven't had eggplant, then beware of the texture. Otherwise, I would highly recommend veggie lovers to get this.Spicy stir-fried lamb: A bit on the dry side, but very flavorful and well-seasoned. You get a HUGE proportion of food with this dish, but most of it is bell peppers etc. so don't expect a whole chunk of lamb.Tl;dr: Wonderful service! Very affordable and tasty food that is very authentic for SA, but not necessarily Sichuan authentic by Houston/China standards."], ["Gina J.", "Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise.

Although we were \"educated\" on Americanized Chinese food when wanting to order Orange Chicken and the Curry Chicken... \u00a0(FYI - don't have it on the menu if you would prefer it not be ordered), we chose those dishes originally because since being in San Antonio, other \"authentic\" dishes have been disappointing and expensive. I've dined at amazing restaurants in LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Portland. San Antonio's Chinese Eateries have been disappointing. But I digress... Im in the land of BBQ, Chamoy, and Tex-Mex. The Orange Chicken was very much enjoyed. Especially since I have picky boys and if I want to return with my family - at least I know they will have something that will keep them happy while My hubs and I enjoy more authentic eats. It was refreshing compared to many of the other orange chicken dishes we have tried (Not swimming in grease, frozen chicken or swimming in \u00a0marmalade). The dumplings and egg rolls were tasty as well. Not greasy and kept their crisp bite throughout the meal. Nothing is worse then greasy soft dumplings. The Bamboo Shoots with Peanuts were good. On par with some of our favorite restaurants in LA. The Peppered Beef (it's served cold) was tasty. Different but tasty. It actually reminded me more of something I've had at one of my favorite Portland Korean BBQ's. It wasn't noteworthy, but it wasn't bad. It would be a good starter for a less adventurous eater. The loose leaf Jasmine Tea was nice (glad it wasn't in a tea bag) and the service was prompt. I think it would have been a 5 star experience if I hadn't felt put on the spot for wanting more Americanized dishes. I've already eaten at plenty of duds and honestly if a place can't do that right - why would I even want to bother ordering anything else? Be passionate about EVERY item on your menu or don't have it on your menu. It also helps to stay humble as a business. My kids help make my decisions about where we dine. If I can't find an item that I think they will like - I won't be back. It's that simple. Food was 5 star for San Antonio. Service was a 5 until Kristine helped us - 3 after that.

FOOD:The Dong Po pork belly brought me right back to my childhood when my grandma and dad would make this dish that would take a couple hours to perfect. Except. Sichuan house does pork belly even better than my Shanghainese ancestors. I couldn't stop shoving pieces of meat down my throat with rice and the savory, sweet sauce and pieces of bokchoy. While eating, I was overcome by emotions of my childhood and miles and miles away since it really felt like I was eating at a restaurant back in China. Spicy Calamari: Although I personally felt like this may have been a better appetizer and not a whole dish, my friend thoroughly enjoyed it! I'm not a huge calamari fan, so this dish was mainly for her. I was perfectly fine feasting on my pork belly and chilled spicy peanut tapa all night. Kristina's father (aka the owner) came by and even offered a plate of spicier chiles that resulted in tears in my eyes.He was such a sweetheart and we conversed in Chinese while he brought out more rice and water to sooth my burning tongue. To top it all off, we were given a tofu desert that was a perfect balance of sweet, gingery, and cooling for the spicy food.I definitely left that night crying for two reasons:1. SPICY CHILES2.

What they ordered was not a disappointment. I enjoyed the peppered Calamari, twiced cooked pork, five spiced tofu, and stir fried veggies. I had spoons of chili peppers, but was not spicy. I think my taste buds has been destroyed from eating anything spicy over the years so I didn't feel any burn. They also have boba here aka bubble tea, the tapioca was very chewy and fragrant. Best boba I had in a long time in San Antonio. I tried boba at three different locations and it was just sad so sad I never wrote a review on them LOL.Great customer service and our host took good care of us!"], ["Laura Lee S.", "Believe the reviews. We had lamb with cumin, savory shrimp (or something like that) & green beans. Yum. So thankful for Yelp. To top it off, you can BYOB. Need I say more?"], ["Corey B.", "Damn, just sweet freakin Lord. Eat here, simple as that."], ["Paul P.", "Came based on awesome reviews. Unfortunately my expectations were so high that I'm disappointed. OMG the food was so salty, in the fried rice I bit into what tasted like a granulated cube of salt. I really liked the demeanor of the servers. They definitely care about their customers. The beef was so overwhelmed by taste of salt that I didn't enjoy it at all. It looks so great and I love the assembly but sorry, just wasn't good enough to come back to. However I will come back to try something else based on the great service."], ["Kristi A.", "Amazing food!! Service was quick and pleasant. Not as spicy as I expected with the amount of chili oil in a few dishes we had but my husband is convinced I have singed off all of my taste buds because I eat such spicy food. We had a cold plate with the garlic cucumber, bamboo shoots and the beef with tendon. \u00a0Also ordered the spring rolls. \u00a0Although fries they were light and flavorful. We then shared the wild mushroom with shredded pork soup and combination Lo mein. \u00a0All fabulous. \u00a0The only negative for me is that I didn't expect it to be in a strip center that is somewhat run down. The interior of restaurant leaves a lot to be desired and the women's bathroom served as a storage room. \u00a0Bathroom wasn't the cleanest which unsettles me a bit (mostly a dirty white door). \u00a0Had it been a tad nicer and cleaner it would easily be five star."], ["James P.", "soho great place and great food love itmy 1st time and i recommend all my friends to try it out5 stars all"], ["Keith G.", "Came for dinner and it is a nice place, great service and large portions. Too bad i did not understand their heat meter because it was sometimes difficult to enjoy. Next time I will come back but it will be with dialed down heat."], ["James G.", "So I would venture to say that I am a regular, I have eaten here numerous times each time I do my best to try something new. I have eaten just about half of the menu. If I had to recommend an item I would say to start the garlic cucumbers are so refreshing and delicious, the pork belly is a favorite amongst my friends and I, it is just so tasty you don't want to stop. \u00a0The crispy and spicy fish is the perfect blend of spicy and crunch. Don't forget the Tea smoked duck which is full of flavor and very tender. The tangy and spicy beef is one I am going to have to order more of I tried this dish last week and was blown away. It is so full of flavor. Since I have been pleased with just about everything on the menu I even decide to try the eggplant which awesome the garlic and eggplant compliment each other nicely and since I love green beans I had to try the saut\u00e9ed green beans, no I maybe bias here because I love green beans but if I could eat that everyday I would. I am also a fan of soups and the wild mushroom and shredded pork soup is my favorite! The last item I tried was the lo mein, this is my go to dish at any Asian restaurant cause it's safe. Well if you haven't noticed that the Sichuan House doesn't disappoint then I don't know why you are still reading this needless to say it's great end of story there. So with every meal there is usually steamed or fried rice, I like steamed rice, however the fried rice is so fresh I highly recommend it. I asked why it tastes so fresh, it's made to order. Go figure right, this place is always a nice treat for my friends and I. The staff is great and food is always delicious. I can't say it's the most authentic Chinese food I have ever had, mainly because I am not Chinese or ever been to China but I do know it taste awesome. The only ONE thing that I have tried that I didn't like was the fried chicken feet but hey I didn't like them before I tried it so couldn't expect a whole lot from that one. \u00a0I highly recommend the Sichuan House it's a nice place to go and eat by yourself, friends or causal business dinner."], ["Joseph E.", "I dropped in for lunch and tried the garlic pork and fried pork dumplings.The dumplings were crisp and hot. The garlic pork was hot, delicious and plenty of it. I look forward to further exploring the menu as I will be back."], ["Carl S.", "I first came here a month ago, and we're up to 5 visits. I may need a 12 step intervention soon. I dream of dongpo pork belly and baby bok choy. Ive since tried most of the cold appetizers and the hot & sour, which is hands down the best h&s Ive ever had. I bring my family members and have become a bit of a Sichuan House missionary. Every visit has been top notch and the staff are excellent."], ["Jessica S.", "We'v been several times, and the food is always great. Believe everyone else's reviews that it's the best Chinese in town.However, it's annoying that literally EVERY time we've gone, half of the restaurant's tables have been taken up by large parties.

Calamari is delicious, lo mein mixed. \u00a0It's BYOB too. \u00a0My first five star restaurant."], ["Joseph S.", "There are two Chinese Restaurants in SA that I consider upper tier if authentic is the criteria, Sichuan Cuisine (Military Hwy) and Tang Street.Now I can add Sichuan House to that list.I came here on Sunday after been sick for few days, and hoping to eat some spicy food to sweat it out, so I ordered the Water-Boiled Beef and Fire-roasted Wild mushrooms. I love the flavor of the Water-boiled beef, although personally I think the fillet would've tasted better. The wild mushroom dish is bit disappointing, I was hoping for something exotic like the straw mushroom, wood ear or Enoki mushroom, but it is shiitake mushrooms, king mushroom and the button mushroom*. I don't blame them though, it is not everyday someone that craves for those types of mushrooms, might not be cost efficient. Service is great.Overall, love this place and highly recommending to anyone that wants authentic Chinese food. \u00a0Looking forward to try other dishes on my next visit*Updated to the correct mushroom type"], ["Chris B.", "Wow!!!!' Now I know why they are a 5 star restaurant with over 60 reviews cause the food is the bomb. The eggplant dish is awesome and the cold tofu is really good too. A great find. The people that sat behind us were also vegetarian and let us know what they ordered and how much they love their dishes so we order the same thing. The flavor of the food is out of this world. The lady that waited on us was also the owners daughter so she informed us on what to expect."], ["Princess R.", "Love it! Not many authentic Chinese restaurants in San Antonio but if you're really craving for authentic, then this is the place! I ordered the Spicy and Savory Fish Filet ($13) and it's just perfect with some soy sauce. Prices are in the $9+ range but the portions are very large (even the soups)! Will come back here again. Service was alright, they only have two servers."], ["Martin M.", "The food here was amazing! \u00a0Some of the best Sichuan Chinese food I've ever had! \u00a0All the food we ordered was delicious and excellent! \u00a0The pork belly was amazingly addictive in a good way!! \u00a0The staff was also friendly and attentive. \u00a0I can't wait to come back and try more of the entrees on their menu!"], ["Kathryn P.", "The first and most important thing to note here is service. The waitress and staff went out of their way to accommodate our larger than expected party. She also went over the history of the restaurant and explained the ordering process many times to make sure we understood how to order. Drinks were always filled and done quickly and quietly...we never even noticed. The restaurant is BYOB. We tried several dishes in our party and every single one did not disappoint. Among the dishes ordered were the spring rolls, regular and spicy dumplings, pot stickers, pork belly (STELLAR), beef and broccoli, combo fried rice, generals chicken, hot pot, spicy beef, and curry chicken. Every single thing we ate was absolutely delicious! A must try and set the bar high for all other Chinese restaurants we go to in the future."], ["Rob C.", "There is nothing I can write here that willl do this place any justice. This is the first time I've ever wondered if Yelpers could give an establishment 6 stars. Our great experience started with the owner's daughter, Christine, giving a thorough rundown of Sichuan cuisine and the meticulous way the restaurant intends to control the growth of their establishment as to not lose that personal touch with customers, nor their ability to deliver the best possible Sichuan dining experience possible. Christine's dad ran a succesul grocery store down the street from the restaurant and she seems intent on helping him establish one of the finest eateries in the San Antonio food scene. We had the wontons in clear broth, orange chicken, combination fried rice, green beans and lamb with cumin. Every dish was outstanding and they brought us a free side of tofu pudding with ginger to close out the meal. I paid my bill and revealed to Christine that we were celebrating my mom's birthday. She came out of the restaurant to give a hug to my mom and wish her a happy birthday. Such genuinely good folks who have stumbled upon something phenomenal in San Antonio."], ["Eric B.", "Just had Sichuan House for lunch. The location is in a stripmall behind Ingram Park mall. The service was friendly and helpful. The young woman who took our order asked us a few questions about what we like and how adventurous we are... And recommended the dry roasted green beans and cumin lamb. Both dishes were delicious. At some point I will have to try their american-style Chinese dishes but that will have to wait because the menu had a ton of amazing sounding Sichuan dishes. Plan to be back tomorrow already.EDIT: Went back for dinner and included some pictures of the beef/tripe in chili oil dish that is served cold, dongpo pork belly and the dry pot. Everything was great."], ["Gracie G.", "The place was clean, food and service was good. We had the duck. It was exactly what I was wanting. I have tried duck many place look for the right flavor and this place has it."], ["Fernando R.", "2 dishes: Sesame chicken and Sichuan pepper boiled fish. They were as far apart in style as the regions they come from. \u00a0Both were well prepared, tasty, and true to their origin. A true diamond in the rough of San Antonio's West Side food desert."], ["Amie C.", "I was skeptical coming here since I had a bad experience with my first Sichuan dining. We ordered dongpo braised pork belly (so delicious, sweet and melts in your mouth!), fish fillet braised in chili bean (not spicy at all!), ma po tofu and beef with Chinese broccoli. The service was excellent. Food was awesome and tasty and it came out really fast. After 7, a lot of guests just poured in and so we were happy we were there at a right time. Overall excellent experience!"], ["Munchy M.", "Went here with the wife for an early dinner. We were seated right away, and Kristina took the time to give us the scoop on the restaurant and address any questions we had about the menu. Great end-to-end customer service at Sichuan House. Anyway, I ordered hot and sour soup and the tea-smoked duck. My wife ordered the braised pork belly, though not the Dongpo one everyone raves about on Yelp. We also got crispy dumplings of the pork variety. In a short amount of time, food started appearing at our table. First was the soup, and its size had me convinced that the server brought us the wrong soup \u00a0or something. It was literally a trough of soup, facilitating a communal dining experience for even the Duggar's! Despite the sheer quantity of soup, it was the best hot and sour soup I've ever had--exceptionally fresh, exceptionally spicy. My wife couldn't handle the heat, so she didn't enjoy it that much. More for me, I guess ;). The crispy dumplings came next, and we both liked them; I was really fond of the spicy sauce they came with. So far, so good. When the entrees arrived, they were very well presented. But while I found the duck very tasty, it really put a damper on my dining experience. I usually wield chopsticks during my meal, and enjoy a good noodle or steamed rice with my protein. The duck, however, was difficult to eat with chopsticks or knife/fork! And to make matters worse, eating the duck became so involved that it distracted from the white rice to the point where I didn't eat much! So here I am, riceless and reduced to eating like some savage, with my bare hands. My sex appeal with the wife dropped precipitously too, given I was covered in duck fat. The experience was taxing and somewhat harrowing, but I digress. Moving on, the wife thought her pork belly was ok, but not life-altering. In the end, maybe we were just too mismatched with our entrees to enjoy them fully. But there's a lot of other menu options at Sichuan House, so I'm confident we'll be back to try more. If you've been curious if this place lives up to the many positive Yelp reviews, I'd say there's a mix of hype and what not. Best way to verify is to go and see for yourself!"], ["Max W.", "After reading all the ranting, raving and 5 stars reviews, my expectations were set high. Maybe, they were set too high because I was disappointed after eating there. But, please read on.... \u00a0I did find that it is on par with some Chinese Restaurants in Houston, but not all; certainly not on par with many Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles. \u00a0I also want to point out that it is the best we have here but that isn't a very hard mark to exceed. \u00a0In my opinion, it does not warrant a 5 star rating. \u00a0With five stars, the taste of your food better make me feel like I am sitting in Sichuan providence which is known for its red peppers and spicy unique flavor! \u00a0I did not find the food as spicy as other Sichuan restaurants I have visited. The service was very good and the staff is very pleasant. \u00a0The atmosphere was comfortable - like you were guest at a friends house. \u00a0Their restaurant was very clean during my visit. \u00a0I did find the menu was somewhat narrow but had the staples. \u00a0Oddly, the white rice was noticeably good and a must with the Cumin Lamb. \u00a0The lamb dish was mostly onion and red bell pepper but was skimpy on lamb.Their food has the unique flavor that I search for but could of been a little spicier. \u00a0Maybe they toned it down as a curiosity to us like some Thai restaurants do. \u00a0I will investigate on my next visit.I did have issue with the pricing. \u00a0We ate Chinese style where we all share each of our dishes in the center of the table. \u00a0It averaged out to $23 bucks person which I felt was very high. The cumin lamb was 15 dollars and the portion was small. Cumin lamb is a staple for me and order it often. \u00a0At 15 dollars, it is the most expensive ever.I wish I could rate it higher than a 3 star but there is no option for that. \u00a0It is closer to four than three but their prices really hurt their rating.

For instance, Kungfu Noodle on Bandera has a very low-key, utilitarian atmosphere, and that sort of unified style could work easily here too. \u00a0The food is much too good to be served with what looks like defunct-Indian-restaurant decor. And crossing out numerous items with a black marker on the menu can't possibly be the most attractive way to present food choices."], ["Janey W.", "Me and my hubby came because of the excellent yelp review.

Although it was a bit of a drive, we decided to head on over there.Kristina took care of us. She is the daughter the family who owns the restaurant and also a nearby Asian grocery. She explained Sichuan cuisine to us in great detail. We were so fascinated we brought up maps of China on our iPhones and figured out exactly where the provence was. We had a great geography lesson. :-)Then we decided to order her recommendations. My son ordered Orange Chicken that was delicious and crispy with a perfect sauce. Not too sweet...perfect. I ordered Water-Boiled Spicy Fish Filets. It was simply amazing. I had never had anything like it, and it was so delicate and delicious. I felt like I was overflowing with healthy deliciousness. \u00a0And the serving was huge! My husband had Dongpo Braised Pork Belly. He loved it. The presentations were so beautiful. The family who owns it is so nice. Are we not lucky that they have opened a restaurant in San Antonio? YES! By far the best Chinese restaurant in town!!!

So last night, when trying to figure out where we were going to eat, I remembered I had bookmarked this place, and I'm so glad we decided to try it!Our waitress, Kristina, was incredibly sweet and took the time to explain the menu and Sichuan cuisine, and even offered us to try some Sichuan peppercorns and some of their new cold appetizers. The peppercorns were certainly interesting as they numb your tongue, and almost feel like Poprocks!We started with the Crispy Pork Dumplings, which were very tasty, and they came with an unusual (for us) but tasty sauce, that I assume had some of the Sichuan peppercorns in it. Kristina suggested the Dongpo Braised Pork Belly for my wife, saying that it was slightly sweet and not chewy but melts in your mouth, and holy cow she was right! The Pork Belly was incredibly tender, juicy and delicious! Kristina suggested the Water-boiled Spicy Beef for me, mentioning that it was one of the spicier items on the menu. It had a thick broth, almost like a stew, with beef, cabbage, celery and some other veggies, along with a TON of seasoning, including garlic and those Sichuan peppercorns. This dish has layers of flavor, and they're all delicious! I added some of the hot green peppers that Kristina brought to us, as I thought it could use a little more heat, but that's just me. We ended with some soft tofu with ginger sauce, which was a delightful ending to a wonderful meal.I'm sure we'll be back here again and again!"], ["Maria S.", "Finally had the highly recommended highly rated \u00a0dongpo pork. \u00a0 OMG!!! totally melts in your mouth. \u00a0 The dish was plenty for two but i don't doubt i could've finished it myself. \u00a0 Also ordered the lo-mein noodles, not to soggy, \u00a0perfect texture and flavorful. \u00a0 Recently had the twice cooked pork, tender slivers of pork, not the heavy thick squares of pork found in other restaurants. \u00a0 Kungpao chicken was interesting but i loved it. \u00a0 Again, \u00a0new flavors, very different to what we are used to eating. \u00a0I'm really loving these sichuan flavors. \u00a0 Thank you for waking my taste buds!!!"], ["Camille H.", "PEOPLE OF SAN ANTONIO STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND RUSH DOWN HERE!!! This place is down right amazing, and if you know from my reviews I have high expectations for Chinese food and well just food in general. The service is impeccable. Kristina ( I believe she is the owner) is extremely friendly and will take the time to explain the menu items and even their cooking process if asked. I had been conversating with her on their FB page before I went to eat there for the first time. One of the items I wanted to try was no longer on their menu (Frog fiery dry pot) but she told me if I want it to call an hour ahead and they will send someone to their family store (Asia Market also on Wuzbach) to get items needed to prepare the dish. Who does that?? That speaks a lot about how much they care about making their costumers happy. Our table ordered Sichuan pork belly, sliced pig ear in chili oil, and pork intestine fiery dry pot. Everything was on point. I am so ecstatic that I finally found a place that is fairy nearby that has amazing pig ears. The pork belly was extremely tender and savory. It was served on a bed of minced (wood ear??) mushrooms. The fiery dry pot was extremely large and had a great balance of savory and spicy flavors. I do not have a bad thing to say about this place except that they are not open 24 hours! It is a must try for any foodie. I plan to become a regular face around there and I'm sure you will too once you taste what they have to offer. :D"], ["Xia Y.", "Wanted to try everything on the menu.

It strives to be true to Sichuan custom and integrates ingredients that are not found in most American restaurants. Do not expect to come here and get your buffet classics but know that they do have a killer Beef and Broccoli that utilizes Chinese broccoli instead that is worth trying. You're probably better off for the most part asking the waitress whats good but you are missing out if you don't get the green beans. \u00a0 When coming as a group, go family style and order dishes to share with everyone.

My coworkers and I got our order to go so this review is only about the food.The crab Rangoon is alright, though lacking in the sweetness one might expect.The egg rolls are fantastic. Judging by the slightly uneven shape of some of them, I have the feeling they are actually made in-house. Packed with just the right ratio of veggies and meat, and not a total grease ball like many I've had at similar establishments. I had the sesame chicken, which came with aforementioned egg roll and fried rice. The portion sizes of all our orders were huge, I couldn't even finish half of mine in one sitting. The orders were all accurate and the food arrived piping hot. The flavor was about average, nothing special. I suppose I'll try something different next time, because my friends who got the house Lo Mein and lemon chicken were pretty happy with their food. Bottom line: No major complaints, but nothing to write home about.EDIT: Ok so I know this sounds unusual, but I felt I had to share. As I mentioned before, I could barely finish half of my order in the first sitting. Then, after finishing the rest of my 12 hour shift, I decided to reheat the leftovers for dinner. I don't know why or how, but the leftovers tasted way better than the food did fresh. That sounds backasswards, I know.

The rice is full of veggies including onions, sprouts and scallions as opposed to the handful of peas you get at most other places. The seasoning is like nothing else. My very favorite item on the menu is #1A...the special eggrolls! They have always been outstanding! They're all meat and all delicious. I'd compare them to a super sized lumpia. I've always said that I could find out there was mystery meat in them and it wouldn't stop me from eating them. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Antonio.

Turns out the waitress had forgotten to put in my order so I had to wait even more.Once I received my food, I immediately noticed the enormous amount of food. I'd normally be happy about this, but it was extremely bland so I was disappointed at the amount of food to be wasted. My chicken chow mein tasted as bad as it looked. The fried rice was over cooked and lacked vegetables. The giant egg roll was too sweet (tasted frozen) so I couldn't even finish that.

The food is what matters! And at least a B on the front window. Wait, I forgot to check for that.

We started with soup wonton and hot and sour. The wonton had a really good chicken flavor like the kind of cook all day to make some awesome chicken stock. They use white pepper and give you wonton crisps. The hot and sour was sweet vs sour but I knew that since I asked our server before ordering. I added some of the hot oil and some extra white pepper to kill some of the sweet and it was really good. I'm kinda eh when it comes to hot oil because I prefer to make my own because it tends to be spicier and toasted tasting. That said I seriously loved the hot oil here. Clean tasting with heat but not too much heat. Yum! We also got egg rolls with our soup and how can you go wrong with 2 for $2. The meal started of great with the food super hot and fresh.We decided to order pork fried rice combination pan fried noodles and sesame chicken. The pork fried rice was yum! You can tell they roast their own pork there. It was juicy and had great BBQ flavor. One thing that makes me crave Chinese is the taste of the wok. That smokey occasionally crispy pieces full of fire taste. They did not disappoint both the rice and the noodles had that signature flavor. I can say I am a huge fan of pan fried noodles and have ordered it plenty of places. This place rivals some of my fav places in Houston's china town. We also ordered the sesame chicken which was lightly battered fluffy white chicken meat in a light sweet but not too sweet sauce. The service was great from our server to the owner at the door.

I can't believe the price of the meal for the quality and quantity of the food and service. The only negative thing I have to say is that the interior of the restaurant is somewhat dirty; our tablecloth had stains on it and there were crumbs all over the floor. I was able to overlook it though in light of everything else. I ordered the Lemon Pepper & Kung Po Shrimp with fried rice, egg roll, and hot & sour soup - all for 8$!

My husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch plate that included egg drop soup and cream cheese crab Rangoon. He was surprised the chicken wasn't in the nuggets he's used to, instead it was like boneless chicken breast- but regardless he liked it.

The service isn't bad, but I can imagine people just like to eat Chinese food in the comfort of their homes instead. Staff is friendly and like to get their job done quickly and efficiently. They won't badger to be your friend the first time you walk in there which is exactly what I personally like. But once you become a regular, they become friendlier. The woman at the front desk even let us take home some calendars for Chinese New Year.

I had sweet and sour pork which was nice and chunky. Good portion. My rice tasted like it was cooked inside of a pot that had burnt rice on the bottom. I ordered the barbeque pork and pan fried dumplings. They sucked. I rarely dislike potstickers...you can't really go wrong with them. But these were so wrong. And the sauce tasted like soy sauce with sugar. We didn't know what kind of meat was inside the potstickers either. I saw a guy order the house noodle soup and I would definitely go back to try that. The tea was bad too. The tea tasted like it had ice that was scraped from the top of the freezer (if you couldn't afford a real raspa growing up...you know this taste). I might actually go back only to try the soup."], ["Amber W.", "We came here based on the Yelp rating. It was good food but nothing special. The waitress was amazing.

I've now been to Happy Guy over a dozen times over the last year, have ordered different dishes and have sampled others' plates as well.Overall, the food is way oversalted-even the wonton soup, sadly. The meat is low quality or maybe just cooked badly. The texture is chewy and very salty, chicken and beef alike.

The neon yellow goo (imagine thick Mountain Dew) drowning a thin, fried chicken breast wasn't even appetizing to look at. The color of it alone was enough to be off-putting, because it was so unnatural. This sauce somehow managed to be watery and flavorless, having only a trace amount of lemon to the taste. We also tried the sweet and sour pork, and it was a similar story. The dish consisted of fried pork chunks covered in an unnaturally orange syrup. It's also the syrup they have sitting on the table as a condiment, so if you try that and love it, maybe the pork will be a good dish for you.On our last visit, we were impressed by the skillfully cooked meat and judicious application of delicately flavored sauce. This time, both of our meals were just not good and very disappointing.Additionally, the crab rangoon we received as an appetizer seemed old, as if they were made an hour or two beforehand and reheated.

So I ordered that, AND the sesame chicken.The pad thai was, unique. None of the usual mildly-sweet, mildly-spicy flavor, and it was covered with cilantro (or some other green stuff that usually turns up in my pho). Surprisingly, it was quite yummy, and I like how they diced the meat and eggs so that there was some in every bite. Not sure I'll order it for my next pad thai craving, but worthy of ordering for whatever it actually is.On to the sesame chicken. Hopes were high based on reviews, but upon opening the take-out container, they dropped. The chicken was grayish-brown, cut into small pieces, and generally appeared uninspired. Somehow, instead of chewy tasteless chicken bits, it was just the right combination of crispy and soft, with great flavor! Probably ranks in my top five for this dish.Overall, happy to admit that there's finally a Chinese place in the neighborhood that will occassionally steal my tastebuds from Phoenix Cafe.

Taiwan Restaurant (downtown's only Chinese diner... or Chiner, as it were) is Chinese food by way of former retail store/greasy spoon that time forgot... and possibly most of San Antonio, too.

The menu is excellently priced, the portions are abundant, and the food is quite flavorful. I ordered Kung Pao chicken and was pleased with the flavor. The waitress warned me about the spice, which ended up being mild overall; yet, it still had a way of sneaking up on me three forkfuls after the fact. It is true that the fried rice had none of the usual color and flair of other restaurants (peas, eggs), but it was still pretty tasty without a soy sauce shower.I was a bit disappointed that the lunch special didn't come with a soup AND eggroll/rangoon (you have to choose either/or), but at least the prices are low enough to make you slap grandma. Oh, and they charge for fortune cookies, too... who the hell does that?At any rate, Taiwan Restaurant is a short walk from work and from most places downtown.

It isn't that expensive and they have a wonderful staff."], ["Chris A.", "It's always great to be surprised and Gin's really surprised me tonight. I've read the reviews, the good, the bad, and the ugly. The reviews all run the gamut from \"Man, this is fantastic - how come I didn't now about this place?\" to \"Eww - there's a short and curly in my beef and broccoli!\" My wife heard about this place from her friends and they said it was great and I, never needing more persuasion that that, agreed to come here for dinner. Glad I did. This place is old school in that it's big, it's old, and totally unpretentious. I mean, the frickin' chair cushions are covered in plastic! The staff all seem to be from the same family - all Chinese by my guesstimation, and happy with their restaurant, their product, and their customer service.We started off with their dumplings. You can definitely tell these are homemade. By that I mean, not uniform. The dough is thicker than most places but that just tells me they are making it from scratch. The minced pork and vegetables on the inside, pan fried, and dipped in their sauce, make for some good eating.We ordered 3 entrees. We had the \"salty shrimp\" that wasn't salty at all, the eggplant with beef, and the Kung Pao chicken. With those 3 entrees we received 2 servings of fried rice and one of steamed rice (fried or steamed is your choice).The salty shrimp are shell on (no heads) shrimp, lightly battered, and fried to a crisp. You are supposed to eat the entire thing and we did. The shell becomes so crisp that it just crunches in your mouth. I didn't find them salty at all so I used some of the remaining dumpling sauce - great! The eggplant was spectacular! Yum! The eggplant comes sliced into some rather large chucks, covered in the same slightly sweet with heat mapo-tofu sauce (no tofu in this dish), and in our case, some small pieces of sliced been. This dish alone was worth the price of admission. The eggplant dish comes either plain (just eggplant with sauce) for $7, or with your choice of chicken, pork, or beef for $8. Lastly, the Kung pao chicken. It wasn't quite a homerun but it was at least a triple - maybe a walk-off bottom of the ninth base hit. The chicken is not battered but it is cut into smaller pieces and covered in a very slightly sweet sauce with just a hint of heat. I was expecting more heat from my king pao but sadly, it didn't have it. The dish is cooked up with some green bell peppers. Great dish.Along with an iced tea, the entire meal with plenty to take home came out to around $34 with tax. Well worth it in my opinion. I don't know exactly how authentic the food was but it's certainly not what you get from Americanized Chinese places.

Our server couldn't understand what I was telling her. So I just let it go. Next the lemon chicken. It looked great! \u00a0So juicy and tender looking. I couldn't wait to try it.

All three plates we got were horrible, rice sucked and smelled like old oil, egg drop soup was flavorless and the eggs were green looking.. Yuck. The crispy things for the soup were dark brown and only tasted like burnt oil. The so called egg roles were so stinky and had no filling, they were oily and rubbery. They didn't give us our dipping sauce for lemon chicken and it sure needed it because it was so dry. Def. will never go back here again."], ["Ron H.", "Great food. \u00a0The dumplings are quite good.

My family and I have been eating here for years (kindergarten?). This place was THE ASIAN PLACE IN SA TX before Panda Express and Chinese food at the deli in Wal-mart. Before they even had an Asian isle in HEB/Your grocery store! We believed Gin rivaled with Golden Wok before they renovated and modernized. \u00a0Well enough with the history lesson.The owner was a caring father and I believed passed this restaurant down to his son or daughter. Very big family restaurant. Over the years we can tell the food went a bit downhill as we saw the Owner less and less. He was there ALL THE TIME helping in the kitchen. I liked that a lot.Place: Old school, early-90's, Hollywood Chinese wall-paper get up. They have not really modernized but you know it could be their theme. I think it could help them greatly since its 2014, however, I can respect the originality.[Food]-The Pan Fried Dumplings are the best in town. Very crisp and lots of filling. We always have them as appetizers. -Beef noodle stir fry- the bomb.com. Great marinated beef and thick egg noodle. -Beef fried rice was top-notch. Not sure how it is now. We kept coming back and it was inconsistent with what we were used too.*Whether: rain, snow, birthdays, out-of-town relatives; the Fried Rice here was usually ordered with an extra order for to-go.

Since I was back in San Antonio for the holidays, I wanted to grab some food that would bring back feelings of nostalgia from my childhood. Welp, here goes: I ordered the pan fried dumplings (15) for like $7.50 which isn't a bad deal since they taste decent and 6 dumplings easily goes for like $5 +/- $1 in Houston at any Chinese restaurant. I wanted to also try something I've been eating since I was in middle school/high school - chicken with black bean sauce. \u00a0The lunch special has gone up since the good ole days I think it was 5.50 (used to be 4.25) but for an entree, 2 scoops of rice, and 2 crab rangoons, you can't really complain. \u00a0I will say I could taste the MSG in the food (and my tongue is usually immune since Chinese joints in Houston load their food up with MSG) so it was kind of prominent in the fried rice and I think it could be toned down a bit.Service was everything you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant. \u00a0While the manners aren't always there, the efficiency is so don't expect a Michelin restaurant experience and you'll be A-OK.All in all, prices are reasonable and the food matches the price point."], ["Wanting H.", "I like their beef noodle soup which is very authentic with intense flavor.

W.", "Saw some good reviews about the authentic beef noodle soup here so I had to come for lunch to try it out.Basically, this restaurant serves Americanized Chinese food which I don't care about. All I wanted to order was the beef noodle soup and i was hoping it'd be authentic. To my surprise, It really was! The noodle is the same kind they use for the lo mien so it is not so great. But the broth and beef are very flavorful and legit. My companion reported that her shrimp with veggies were Americanized Chinese which didn't seem a surprise to me. Overall, I enjoyed my soup a lot. Service was prompt and ambience was bearable. But I am not sure if I will come again just to get the soup.

Anyway, oh god, I wish I could have some Gin's right now so bad. My family would always order combination fried noodles, almond chicken, smoked chicken, and maybe some eggrolls.

I was NOT disappointed! I knew this place would be a bit of a hole in the wall/dive, but hey, sometimes those are the best places, right?The Atmosphere: This isn't the place you want to go for a nice date. The upstairs dining room may have been nicer, but overall the place is kind of cluttered with too much stuff on the walls that doesn't all go together. It's that look of \"we've been here forever, and just keep adding.\" The downstairs dining area has a TV, with a chair in front of it, and a whole bunch of VHS tapes and DVDs stacked up around it. Despite the clutter it did seem clean. Any of the staff that wasn't busy was also sitting down in this area, hanging out at one large table, and it was a little disconcerting to see that many staff with nothing to do.The Service: Maybe it was because we were right there with the non-busy staff sitting two tables over, but the waitstaff was super attentive. Maybe a little too attentive. Our appetizers came out about a minute or two before our meal, but given that we'd only gotten some eggrolls that's OK.The Food: OOOOOOOh my goodness! I got the beef noodle soup. The bowl is HUGE. There's got to be at least a quart and a half of soup. The broth was rich and unctuous with a mild anise/5-spice flavor and just a kiss of heat despite the 'hot and spicy' warning. The chunks of meat were so tender that they practically melted in my mouth, and there was a fairly good serving size. The bowl was rounded out with lo-mein style noodles, cabbage, bean sprouts and scallions. The only downside to this soup was trying to figure out how to eat it. The noodles are a bit long for eating it with a spoon, but the bowl is too big for picking up and eating with it close to your chin. Trust me though, figuring out a method (or even just ruining a shirt) is totally worth it. I haven't had soup like this since I was in Seattle's Chinatown.My husband had the sweet and sour shrimp with fried rice. It was a pretty good serving size with your typical hot pink sweet and sour sauce. Nothing special here to make it stand out from any other restaurant.The egg rolls are made with light, crispy rice-paper style wrappers instead of the thicker, chewier egg rolls. The inside was all vegetable from what I could tell. The crab rangoon were super creamy inside and nice and crisp on the outside.They have several dishes, like the soup, that I haven't seen on most Chinese restaurants like Kung Pao Squid, the beef noodle soup, and the Ma Po Tofu."], ["Alice F.", "Location - Came here at night, was a little scared of the run-down plaza. Maybe not the place to take a first date. Cliche Chinese decor of course. Walked in and saw a completely Asian staff and thought to myself 'well this can't be too bad.' Service - Had to seat ourselves. Unwittingly picked a dirty table which they came by later to clean with a dirty rag. Waitress had the cold and kept coughing in her hands. Ah, the lack of hygiene reminded me of Chinatown. Scary, but felt strangely authentic lol. One crazy negative point - we were at the restaurant for TWO hours. Took about 35 minutes before the appetizer came out and another hour before the rest of the dishes came out. Waitress was crazy forgetful about bringing extra plates and refilling our waters. She was very nice and apologetic however.Food - Ordered the pan fried dumpling appetizer. Was pretty legit! Skin was crispy and the pork was flavorful. Entrees were the ma po tofu, moo goo gai pan, and Chinese broccoli. Thought the ma po was too salty, but was tasty overall. \u00a0Just had to eat double the rice to even it out. Moo goo gain pan was not as great - it was in a weird bland sauce. The moo goo gai pan leftovers are still waiting in the fridge and I have no desire to eat it again. Chinese broccoli was decent - came sitting in soy sauce.Price - Can't remember the exact price on the bill, but it was somewhere in the mid-$20's to low $30's. I put two dollar signs because it was technically over $11 per person. But for the amount and quality of the food, I thought it was reasonable. Overall, this joint definitely hit some notes of authenticity. Decent for San Antonio Chinese food. I recommend the pan fried dumpling appetizer (I want to say it came with 6-8 dumplings?). Also recommending the ma po tofu."], ["Ann H.", "i heard great things about this restaurant as far as it having authentic chinese food, so i thought i'd check it out. definitely disappointed me both times i went. i've tried the beef noodle soup, which was close to flavorless and had really bad quality meat in it. i've also had their lunch specials which were just.. greasy/overly salted/small-portioned/bad. bei fang, kim wah, and phoenix cafe are much better. the waitress we had both times seemed friendly, but she didn't speak english. we tried to speak to her in chinese but she has a really strong accent of some sort, making it almost impossible to understand her. our order was messed up a few times because of this, so it was a little frustrating. oh, and if you decide to check this place out, make note of their hours -- they're closed for a few hours between lunch and dinner."], ["Ruth N.", "This is the most authentic \"Taiwanese\" Chinese home-cooking style restaurant in San Antonio. \u00a0A mom and pop shop - pop runs the kitchen, mom and two kids do anything required throughout the restaurant. \u00a0Super friendly, humble and generous people, even though English may not be spoken fluently ... \u00a0As I have become a regular, I'm discovering this large group of followings who have been going for 15-20 years -- Chinese, \"gringo\" or Mexican ethnicity. \u00a0The owners, though not your traditional philanthropists, have quietly fed many new immigrants or Chinese visitors.If you are the adventurous type, go for the authentic menu or ask the kitchen to cook up however by designating your meats and vegetables. \u00a0Be prepared for the true authentic experience though -- example is the beef in the noodle soup. \u00a0The meat choice is not your prime cut tenderloin. \u00a0It's marbled with gristle and some fat, cooked ever so tender -- just how the Chinese like it. \u00a0If you are lucky enough that the kitchen has fresh fish, expect the whole thing -- head to tail.Smoked chicken, green beans and pot stickers are must-haves when we go. \u00a0I have ordered these dishes and fried noodles several times for large casual parties at home -- always very pleasing and economical. \u00a0We are bringing a group of epicurean friends there for a special treat.Their Americanized dishes are what lunch crowds go for -- standard and a good deal. \u00a0I grew up in Taiwan, so would never order these, but they are still good (compared to Americanized Chinese dishes elsewhere.)The interior is OK - not fancy, but you are not paying for it either. \u00a0All in all, they are my good fallback comfort food restaurant."], ["Amy R.", "Gin's is yummy.

The beef definitely was well braised and fell apart in your mouth.I also had broccoli rabe (chinese: jie lan) with sliced pork. I thought that was pretty well done. paired with rice, it makes for a very simple, easy meal.I ordered out some fried dumplings and they weren't great because once they packed in the dumplings the steam kind of made them soggy again, so you should order them and eat them as you get them!I didn't even look at the menu--just ask the waiter for some authentic items."], ["Quimbero G.", "Ah Gin's... what can I say, we grew up together. \u00a0Ever since I was young, my family would take me to Gin's, and then hop over to the dollar theatre to soak the heels of our shoes in sticky soda residue, gum and year old popcorn... but I digress.Gin's is really good, but you have to know what to order. \u00a0NEVER order the orange chicken, it's absolutely disgusting.

Yes, the food is Americanized, but it is better the majority of the other Chinese restaurants in San Antonio. Since I no longer live in Southern California, you must have different expectations. The neighborhood surrounding the restaurant is not great, but it is not scary. My husband and I had the Kung Pao Chicken, Beef with Chinese Broccoli (Gai Lan) and a thin rice noodle with beef dish which were all okay. A Chinese acupuncturist in town had recommended this place and states that the beef noodle soup and the dishes with bamboo shoots were good, but we did not try them this visit.

That said, I've had Formosa Garden several times over the years. It's never been my choice as a dining establishment, but a friend showed me the wonders of their Triple Delight, which manages to satisfy me quite nicely when I'm playing along. Recently I dined here with some friends and I was struck with a familiar feeling: what IS it about this place that so many people love? What am I missing? I wasn't particularly hungry, so I decided to snack on some pan-fried dumplings, which usually tickle my fancy every time. I tasted all the other dishes at the table, though, since the portions are abundant: Again, the Triple Delight is satisfying. The General Tso's is pretty good, if that's what you're into. The Pad Thai was a sad, bland, pile of gray. An egg roll was disappointingly not crispy or flavorful. And my dumplings? A miss. Too much meat with too little flavor, and the dumplings were all fused together by pan detritus from the frying, which our server endorsed, with an air of you-don't-know-how-they're-SUPPOSED-to-be-served?, which I found even more off-putting. The dumpling sauce managed to somewhat mask the blah after I tugged the dumplings out of the pan-crust.Aside from the food: in my opinion, the place is looking old and rundown - and not in a charming way. My silverware and wine glass weren't completely clean. I didn't complain (had somewhere to be after, and chopsticks and the other side of the glass worked just fine); I only mention these details to share the things I'm seeing as I'm struggling to find what I'm missing.To each his own, right? I've only taken the time to write a review since I feel like the rating is bloated.

The General Tso chicken was very good--not perfect--but very good. \u00a0There are three aspects of a good General Tso. 1.) It MUST be slightly crispy. \u00a0I have no doubt that when these succulent little chunks of fried chicken escape the Wok that they are extremely crispy; but then once the sauce hits the breading, it gets soggy. \u00a0A true test of the skill and culinary ability of an Asian restaurant is their ability to keep the chicken slightly crispy--despite the sauce. \u00a0This General did that!2.) The sauce must be sweet, sour, and spicy. \u00a0That is the killer combination of any General Tso sauce. \u00a0I have been to many, many restaurants in San Antonio, and elsewhere in the U.S. that claim to have General Tso chicken. \u00a0Then, when the food arrives I get a giant pile of fried chicken in a watery, gloopy very dark sauce that tastes like soy sauce and garlic. \u00a0That is NOT GENERAL TSO!!! \u00a0Formosa Garden's sauce was translucent and sweet, sour with specks of Thai chilies, and perfectly spicy. \u00a0This was a genuinely delicious General sauce.3.) General Tso chicken uses THIGH MEAT!! \u00a0Again, what is the deal with wannabe Asian restaurants serving me General with chicken breast? No, no, no! \u00a0It is thigh meat--everyone knows this. \u00a0Anybody who protests that they want chicken breast meat in their General has no idea what they are talking about and should just go to KFC or McDonalds and get some chicken with a side of Sweet & Sour. \u00a0Chicken Breast in General only reveals that a particular restaurant has no idea what they are doing.Ok, onto the egg roll. It was below average. \u00a0I don't understand what the deal is with San Antonio and their egg rolls. \u00a0They are all the same! \u00a0Bland and soggy--bland and soggy. \u00a0This frustrates me because everything else at Formosa Garden was great. \u00a0Even the fried rice was much better than the average fried rice down here; but the damn egg rolls was sub-par. Errr...it makes me waaay angrier than it should. \u00a0When I lived in Plattsburgh, NY, I had a place I would go to JUST for 2-4 egg rolls as a late afternoon lunch or snack. \u00a0In San Antonio, it is like the egg roll is an afterthought.Food: 4 / 5 (5/5 for General, 5 / 5 fried rice, 2 /5 egg roll) Atmosphere: I got a to-go order so I can't fully comment on the entire atmosphere experience, but these are the things I did notice. \u00a0No strange and revolting smell coming from anywhere (yay!), extremely busy (like line out the door for to-go order pick-up, 'busy'), a wide variety of diversity among patrons. \u00a0Why does that last part matter? \u00a0Any establishment that caters to more than one demographic is culturally transcendent. Bet you didn't think this review would go there did you?Seriously though, when you go into a restaurant and you see many different types of people--Hispanic, African American, Caucasian, Asian, male, female, old, young, etc.--it says something about that restaurant. \u00a0It shows that their food is somehow delicious enough to speak to everyone's stomachs.Atmosphere: 3 / 5 (waaaay to crowded, loud, and busy for me to every eat there--but good for them, that means they do good business)Price: This is my major point of contention, and the reason I did not give Formosa Garden 5 stars. \u00a0Now, this is surprising because generally speaking, I usually get much more than my money's worth at Asian restaurants. \u00a0Usually I get a heaping pile of rice and more chicken than I know what to do with. \u00a0At Formosa Garden, I got 4 pieces (albeit large pieces) of General Chicken and a half cup of rice for 7.95. \u00a0That is very expensive for what I got. \u00a0A more appropriate price would have been $5.95.Price: 3 / 5Final Thoughts: I highly recommend Formosa Garden on the principle that its food is very good. \u00a0I will definitely come here again, and even recommend it to family and friends."], ["Nicole J.", "VERY disappointing!

I used to order 2 extra pancakes- now there is not enough for the 4 provided.I resent being lied about to my husband.Shame on you - Formosa \u00a0Garden!"], ["Dolph M.", "Formosa is certainly above average, at least when it comes to standard fare for Chinese restaurants in SA.The lunch menu is reasonably priced, service & ticket times are exceptionally fast, and the food is prepared very consistently. Certainly recommended for lunch / take out.My one venture onto the sushi menu resulted in some noticeably fishy-smelling tuna. The presentation wasn't much better than a grocery store either. Look elsewhere for sushi."], ["Luigi C.", "I consider the quality of the food at Formosa Garden to be a tad bit better than your typical fast-food, Americanized Chinese restaurants, but when it came to taste, its about the same - pseudo Asian cuisine. The food here is average and I felt that it lacked the authentic flavors and quality I look for in traditional Chinese food. I decided to order the special fried rice and the spicy tuna roll. The special fried rice was satisfying and appetizing but lacked the flavors that fried rice usually delivers. For some reason, the fried rice had a subtle sweetness, I guess from the soy sauce (or maybe brown sugar), that I found appealing. But overall, I have had better fried rice and was a bit disappointed with the outcome.As for the spicy tuna roll -- what a bummer. I always enjoy spicy tuna because I love the simplicity of this roll and the flavors you get with every bite. The roll here fell flat - although I do appreciate the chef's integrity by keeping the roll simple, as it should be. As a personal preference, I prefer each roll to be filled with more spicy tuna to guarantee that the great texture and flavor from the fish are more prominent. Also, I got to try their Fermosa Shrimp. I thought it was deep fried perfectly and had a great texture and crunch. But the sauce -- it was a little weird for me. I was taken aback because of the sweet flavor paired with a shrimp dish. It was good but I thought it was so heavy and creamy that it felt like mayonnaise was slathered all over the shrimp. Luckily, pairing the shrimp with the fried rice helped cut down on the thickness.Overall, I give this restaurant an A-OK or average rating. I plan on going back because they have a lot to offer on their menu that sound appetizing."], ["Ricky B.", "I had miso soup, salad and sashimi combo! It was great, nice size portions and extremely fast service!!! I had everything in front of me within 5 minutes for lunch.

The last time I went was during lunch and they had great specials, the food was good and I had no complaints. Today was a different story. We got there around 4 pm and the place was completely empty (now I know why). Even though the place was empty we still had I wait 10 minutes to be seated. The guy seating us tells us that the sushi bar is closed which was disappointing because I was planning on ordering the Las Vegas roll. We order our drinks and start looking at the menu. I was going to order the teriyaki chicken because I've had it before and enjoyed it. Well since there wasn't any specials, it was $8.95 and came with white rice. I don't like white rice so I asked if i could substitute fried and the waitress said it would be $1.50 more. I think that is outrageous! Paying close to $11 for some teriyaki chicken and rice. It doesn't even include soup or an eggroll. I just couldn't bring myself to eat there so we decided to just leave. But not before paying $6.33 for one adult and 2 kids drinks!! I may just sound like I'm being cheap but I think you get what you pay for. I could understand if the restaurant was NICE but its not. There's nothing special about it. The food may be decent but they are way over priced when comes to the dining experience as a whole. My advice? Do not eat here unless it's lunch time!! Even then, you'll end up paying around $10 per person but at least you get a full meal AND a drink."], ["Sofia R.", "Chinese food is delicous as well as the sushi!

This is a place I would probably deem a safe bet for a quick and cheap lunch/dinner.The entire party I was with is some form of vegetarian, so it was very important that the food be free of any kind of animal product. Luckily they are very accommodating with dietary needs and made sure the dishes that needed to be vegetarian did not have fish sauce, eggs, or meat. The waiter was very informative and attentive to these details and gave good suggestions. They ending up getting tofu and veggies in their pad thai, fried rice and papaya salad. Also an order of vegetable spring rolls (which were awesome, even for a carnivorous fiend like me). No complaints from their end of the table, except that the tofu could've been fresher. I had a thai tea, which was good not the best I've ever had but good. And an order of chicken pad see ew, which was also pretty standard. It didn't blow my socks off but it was flavorful and filling. I could barely eat half the plate, this would've definitely been better split family style had my party not been vegetarian -- but since they were -- I was stuck with the one meaty dish by myself lol. I guess that's my fault for not conforming. For every entree they have spicy levels from level 2-10. The friend who had been here before insisted that level 6 spicy was spicy enough for me. And although the rest of the party agreed with her when the dishes came out. Level 6 was definitely not spicy enough for me, but nothing a little chili oil couldn't fix. As a true Asian that loves her sriracha, sambal oelek and chili oil on ERRTHANG, I could've easily enjoyed level 7 or 8, possibly level 9 if I'm feeling adventurous. Always next time!

Maybe the formula is only for lunch, but it was awful.

Before Mom passed away, they were going there to eat about twice a week. Now, Dad eats there almost every day but Sundays, since it is closed Sundays, much to his chagrin. All the people there call him by name. They know that he wants unsweetened tea with no ice. They know what dishes he will usually order and how he likes them prepared. Every time we get back in the car, Dad says, \"Those ladies take really good care of me.\" I have to agree with him. The staff at Asia Kitchen is, and has always been, wonderful.The food is very good. I have tried many items and have yet to be dissapointed. I can vouch for all of the soups and most of the curries. My favorite soup is the beef noodle soup with its rich dark broth. My favorite curry is the catfish with coconut milk in the sauce. The catfish nuggets are fried so delicately, I couldn't believe it. They were crispy, but you could barely even see or taste the coating that was used. The sauce they were in was awesome. I asked for medium spice, which was enough for me most of the time and too much on a few bites.Dad is a fan of several things including the pad thai, vegetable fried rice, pineapple fried rice, and king sod he calls ginger chicken. Mom's favorite was the Yum Gai (chicken salad). It is a lettuce based salad topped with small chicken pieces. The dressing on it is a chile/lime type of thing. It comes with white rice, which I use to soak up the extra dressing. It is so good. You can have almost the same salad with squid or beef.Anyway, go and give it a try for yourself. I think you will like it. Just don't go on any weekday for lunch unless you like crowds! It is packed for lunch.Update 6/5/10-- Now that Dad is not driving, I take him to Asia Kitchen every day. I have tried some more things that I have to spread the word on. First, the pad woonsen is a great dish of glass noodles stir fried with bean spounts, onion, mushrooms, broccoli and your choice of chicken, beef, pork, or vegetables. It is amazing!!!!!! \u00a0Also, the papaya salad is really great. It is made from shredded green papaya that is mixed with garlic, dried shrimp, and a limechili sauce."], ["Street K.", "Oh, yeah... I'm all thumbs for Asia Kitchen!!! This place is fantastic, the curry puffs are out of this world.

This is the first Thai place I ever ate with my family. My parents were friends with the owner, Patrick, because he also had a freight service where we could send packages to our family back in the mother country. When the owner would come to pick up our packages, we would place soup orders with him and it was like home delivery. As a matter of fact, we never even called this place \"Asia Kitchen.\" We called it Sally's (the name of the chef). Lots of things have changed over time. They no longer have the freight service. They expanded the restaurant and closed down the market because it wasn't as profitable as the restaurant. That kind of sucked because I remember getting yan yans and doing some grocery shopping with my mom after we ate.For one thing, hands down, best pineapple fried rice (sweet variety). You get a good portion for a low price and you don't have to pick your meat - it comes with chicken, ham, and shrimp. If anything, you request what you don't want in it. Every time my family would come down with a collective case of the cold - we would go here to eat their Poh-Taek, perhaps the most awesome seafood soup ever made. Yes, this kicks the ass of the Tom Yum. This would always clear our sinuses and stuffy noses. In addition to the tons of seafood added into the soup, you can really taste all the herbs and spices added to the broth. From what I remember, galanga, lemon grass, and, I think, kefir lime leaves.

I got the pad thai since that's supposed to be their specialty but it was waaaaay sweet. Only ate a couple of bites.

For example whenever my cup was three ~ fourths empty someone would come to the table and fill up my glass. But mainly they just check up on you and ask if you needed anything.

I can finally call off the hunt for a go-to Chinese place. I have tried other local places before, many of which I like, but none compare to this. The moment I walk in there were wonderful aromas emanating from the kitchen. The front of house staff was very cordial, and they answered all my questions. My wife is a mushu fan so naturally I got her the mushu chicken, and for me I chose the General Tso's. My Tso's was in a combo that came with rice, choice of soup and either eggroll or rangoon. I went with hot and sour and the egg roll. While I waited the hostess got me some water. She also saw to it that I got the hot mustard that they serve in the dining area since it is better than the prepacked stuff. She also suggested that a few of the menu items are better if they are enjoyed dining in rather than as takeout. I told her that I would definitely be dining in the next time. So I got our goodies home and we were very impressed. The portions are very generous so you definitely get your money's worth. My Gen. Tso's was excellent. Hands down the best in San Antonio and in the running for the best I've ever had. The eggroll was also quite good. They make all of the wrappers for their wontons, dumplings, eggrolls in such in house. So many other places by the premade ones, and the difference it makes is profound. Truly a wonderful take-out experience, and I look forward to eating there next time!UPDATE: We decided to go there for dinner tonight and we are still really impressed. I had the Sizzling Garlic Shrimp and let me tell ya, it is worth dining in for it. Their shrimp are incredibly fresh and very tasty.

The Hot and Sour soup is among the best I've had, the Moo Shu Pork was spectacular!

Less than $7 - $8 for entree, soup, egg roll or rangoon, and fried or steamed rice.I got the Twice Cooked Pork. It was very good. Shredded pork with cabbage, onions, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. Awesome sauce! I asked for steamed rice, but they gave me fried rice. Oh well.My daughter got the General Tso's chicken. She didn't like it, but I thought it was pretty good. I think it was a little too tough. We microwaved it the next day, and she gobbled it all up.Other than that, everything was great. Service was good too. We got our drinks right away. They don't have sweet tea, so you can't ask for that. But they kept our drinks refilled and for a party of 15 that was quite a feat.We got our food pretty quick as well.

I visited yesterday for the first time accompanied by another obvious Anglo-Saxon and received delightful service and food. People are so crazy.To the eye, China Inn appears to be just another strip-mall Chinese restaurant. It turns out that the food is fantastic. I had lunch, and the lunch menu is not a comprehensive as the full menu, I suspect. It was long, with lots of choices, but mostly familiar American-Chinese plates. A few surprises. But, hey, it's the lunch menu.I kept it simple, sticking with an old standard to see how they did with it. Sesame Chicken. They knocked it out of the park. Large, succulent pieces of chicken, very lightly battered, fried perfectly, tossed in a spicy, garlicky sauce that was not the sweet goop many places serve. A light sprinkle of sesame seeds.Another standard, won-ton soup, was excellent. The broth was clear and light, the won-ton was tender without being soggy. Just the right dash of chopped scallions.I plan to return and get more adventurous. It's clear that the kitchen knows what it's doing.Soup, egg roll, sesame chicken, rice, and the unavoidable fortune cookie, plus a complimentary plate of fried won-ton skins, about six bucks. Two of us, with beverages, spent $16. A total bargain for first-rate Chinese food.Service was attentive and friendly. The kitchen knocked out the food quickly, which is important for a lot of people at lunch. The crowd was a mixed bunch, sort of working-class San Antonio.You can get a beer or a glass of wine.

General Tso's comes in BIG pieces of meat that you will have to use a fork and knife to cut, but the sauce is so delicious and the chicken isn't dry.

I recommend that you venture outside of the typical American Chinese fare and try some of the Chinese Style offerings on the menu. They're delicious! I love the Mapo Tofu - it tastes just like the one I had while I lived in Singapore.

You can have either duck bone soup (which I loved while in China) or have them stir fried. I recently tried the latter and loved them!

I heard this was the best authentic chinese place in SA - guess it makes sense given the lack of chinese population. Wasn't planning on eating chinese in SA but in laws demanded rice, so gotta \u00a0find the best I could.Boba here is overpriced and ultra sweet - so I don't recommend it. Thai tea tastes a bit funky and honeydew is just over the top toothachingly sweet...The food though isn't bad at all. Peking duck is where its at: tender duck, mantou that definitely serves a large party so either come hungry or bring a lot of people to share this. It's kinda hard to eat a lot of this since duck is rich and mantou is pretty filling. Skin could be crisper but that's nagging. I would recommend the soup to go with it - its rich and palate cleansing at the same time. As for the other stuff, we got beef flat noodle, steamed fish, cashew shrimp, snow pea leaves and mapo tofu. Beef flat noodle is good - had better elsewhere, but it had all the essential components that make it good. Steamed fish is really good if the eating a head on fish doesn't freak you out. Snow pea leaves are tender and garlicky, though could have been cooked a tad longer. Avoid the cashew shrimp - tastes like tea for some reason and the sauce just doesn't really work. Same with the mapo tofu - too watery and is oddly overly sweet yet spicy.Service is really really slow. Think it took us almost an hour to get our food.

There are several items that are on both menus, but the Authentic one seems to go a bit further in depth than the American one. Fried intestines, anyone? The place is relatively clean, and has ample seating. The dishes are fairly good sized, when it comes to the entrees. But the amount of rice was pretty stingy. They gave us about an ice cream scoop's worth of rice. When you consider the amount of entree, it's not much rice. Frankly, I'd rather they gave out a bit less of the dish, and a bit more rice. The service was friendly, but the food took a long time. The chicken curry was a sweet curry, which was alright. I was hoping for something spicier, and it wasn't spicy at all. The Kung Pao Chicken was not nearly as spicy as I'd like it, and it lacked whole peppers that you normally see. It did have about half a green bell pepper in it, a handful of celery, and a generous amount of peanuts. None of the food was overly memorable. Generally bland. The eggroll tasted as if it was frozen and deep fried on site. They have a long wall covered by awards that Kim Wah has won, like Reader's Choice Award (several years ago), and other articles written about this place, which all have generally good reviews. All the entrees were $9+ A bit overpriced for what there is..."], ["Cathy S.", "i've been in San Antonio for a year now, and every Chinese restaurant I've been to taste like crap.

Got the BBQ pork, bokchoy, and the sweet and sour shrimp? BBQ was the most on point thing I've tried. Taste exactly like BBQ pork we have back in Dallas. Bokchoy was a little oily, but that's how most asian places make it anyways, and the sweet and shrimp was freaking amazing! They didn't cheap out on the shrimp either! Huge shrimp!!

What we ate: general tso chicken lunch special with fried rice. Mongolian beef lunch with steamed rice. Small plain lo mein. \u00a0One order of fried dumpling. Verdicts: chicken was pretty flavorless and not very saucey. \u00a0Fried rice looked boring with no random veggies like peas or cabbage like I'm used to. \u00a0Mongolian beef was kind of tough and a bit dry despite the abundance of gravy. The lo mein was also devoid of any color. I like me some lo mein but now I've found one I don't like. My wife said I make better lo mein and that's really saying something. \u00a0The rangoons included with the lunch specials were ok, but weren't filled much. The egg rolls (also included in the lunch special) were pretty good. I quite enjoyed the dumplings as they actually had some flavor.

My \"last\" hope for authentic Chinese food in San Antonio is severely dampened by this restaurant. There's nothing to rave about, everything was below mediocrity at best. Biggest gripe about the food is the freshness of the ingredients and the portion size. On taste, my family ordered 4 dishes: Kim Wah special chicken, sizzling tofu w/ minced pork, beef brisket w/ daikon radish pot, and saut\u00e9ed flat rice noodle w/ beef. The problem with the chicken dish originates from the concept of the dish. It consisted of fried pieces of chicken (bone in) topped w/ tiny morsels of carrots and green onion. The chicken itself was absolutely bland, while the toppings were used to \"season\" the chicken, but it just didn't work. I mean you'd have to eat every single bite of chicken w/ some tiny carrots/green onion (that falls off every time you tip the chicken) for flavor. The tofu and beef pot dishes had good flavors, but the tofu wasn't fresh b/c it had a hint of sour aftertaste and the daikon used in the beef pot was \"old\" as well, in the sense that it's over ripened (when daikons get old, they become very fibrous) and hard to eat. on portions, the noodle dish had hardly any, I mean perhaps one single serving of rice flat noodles. I even contemplated on driving across the street, grab a bag of noodles from Tim's and have the chef throw it into the dish. A rip off for something that cost $10. In Cali, a dish like that alone can easily satiate a family of 4. This review has been sitting in the draft box for over a month; it disappoints me greatly to deliver such low reviews for what may be the last hope for Chinese cuisine in SA.

Sichuan Cuisine, to be continued..."], ["Angela W.", "I'm Chinese, and this is not exactly the typical chinese food places I would normally go to. One thing that I do really like about this place is that they do offer a different menu for the native chinese diners so i'm not stuck with sweet and sour chicken and fried rice and hot and sour soup or something. The dish we did order, which was a house special tofu dish, was indeed pleasant, but I think that was about the highlight of my dinner. We also got half of a roasted duck. I've for sure had better duck than this, overly salted and not much meat. On top of all that the dipping sauce is horrible, straight up just a jelly like yellow sweet sauce. I was expecting a soysauce based dipping sauce. But that's not why I gave it 2 stars (I'm thinking 2.5 stars) is because it's way to expensive for what you get. for two people we got 2 things and bubble tea for about 30+ dollars.

I thought that Phoenix was perhaps the only authentic restaurant in town, until I learned of Kim Wah. Like Phoenix, the name is a bit misleading, the former is nothing like a cafe, and the latter, upon investigation, did not offer many barbecue dishes. What both DO offer, however, is a variety of authentic Chinese foods by way of their secret menus. Kim Wah has two menus - one for whitey, and another for people that look like they know what they're talking about. They provide either upon request, and both are in English, so I implore everyone to order from the Chinese menu.The table shared their meals - I had the Hai Nan style flat noodle, while a friend ordered the Singapore style Rice noodle. While both were good, they seemed to be of similar construction, sharing a sauce and the same cuts of pork. The Singapore had shrimp, though, and obviously the types of noodle were different. Another meal shared was the authentic Kung Pao chicken, and I guarantee it's not what most people have in mind when they think of the dish. The sauce which was used for the dish was good, but considerably thick.One of the reasons I eat is to explore other cultures, and eating at the majority of Chinese restaurants is like me going to Taco Bell to experience authentic Mexican food. Places like Kim Wah appeal to those who want to experience what Chinese people eat, not what Chinese people are making to satisfy American palettes."], ["Amy Y.", "Given that San Antonio does not have many authentic options for Chinese food, Kim Wah is a hidden gem for those seeking dishes more akin to what your mom would make. \u00a0Granted, they do cater to the Americanized Chinese Food crowd, but they have a section in their menu for the real stuff.Food: \u00a0I've always found the menu to be robust (for San Antonio) with lots of various options. \u00a0The plates are usually well seasoned and flavorful, although the portion size can sometimes be a little small depending on what you get. \u00a0The soups generally are well-portioned and dry noodle dishes a little less so. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised to find a place that has a good beef noodle soup! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Service: The wait-staff has always been kind and prompt when we were ordering (although the wait to order can be a little longer than I'd like). \u00a0They are generally helpful, especially if I have a question about a dish since I can't read Chinese, and they humor me when I ask them to tell me what the dish is in Mandarin. \u00a0Getting the check can be slow, so I recommend that you go up to the cashier in the back and pay when you're ready. \u00a0Ambiance: \u00a0Kim Wah's unassuming location is hidden in a large strip mall next to a Hobby Lobby and a Cici's Pizza - very easy to miss. \u00a0The space inside is spacious, never crowded (which is a shame considering the authenticity of the food), and clean. \u00a0They have TV's up on the wall in case you go to grab a meal on your own and want to watch the tube.Pricing: Reasonable pricing. \u00a0For a decent Chinese meal, I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, and that's what I get at Kim Wah. \u00a0Kim Wah is one of the three authentic Chinese food places I frequent (well, not as much as I should). \u00a0The other two are Phoenix Chinese Cafe and Sichuan Cusinie."], ["Queenie D.", "It's an average chinese restaurant.

None of my family, except number two son, will even go back. They were bothered by, of all things, ducks hanging in the restaurant. Funny how I see the ducks and think, \"Yum!\", while others in my clan see them and think, \"Yuck!\" Oh well. Some of my friends feel the same way about the cabrito hanging in my favorite Nuevo Laredo restaurant.I always order off the Chinese menu. Yes, it is now in the regular menu, but you still have to ask for it during lunch. Otherwise you get a little card menu with daily specials, etc. While we're on the subject of Chinese menu vs. non-Chinese menu, let me throw out a request. Somebody PLEASE invent a name like \"Tex-Mex\" to describe that not so Chinese food served at most San Antonio Chinese restaurants. You know- chicken nuggets with slimy lemon sauce, etc. (When I lived in Taiwan, I ate lemon chicken. The lemon was in the taste. There was no slimy yellow lemon syrup on it.) But, I digress. I nominate the term Ais-Tex. It would be pronounced something like \"AGE-TEX\" with a little softness on the G part. Anyway, my favorites at this restaurant all involve intestines. Yes, I said intestines. I don't know why that causes so many people to shudder uncontrollably. After all, many groups of Americans eat intestines all the time. You've got your chitlins, your tripas, and your American hot dogs. Get over it. My favorite favorite is the intestines with preserved vegetables. Now don't go thinking of mummified vegies. That just means they are pickled Chinese style. Trust me on this, if I put it in your mouth without your seeing it or hearing what it was, you would love it. I also like the plain old crispy intestines and the braised intestines. The braised come with lots of green onion stirred into the mix. Now, I have to talk about the restaurant itself. Some of the people who have gone with me have found it to be less than optimal for their dining comfort. It does have sort of a messy look to it in areas. But it is clean, unlike some other favorite restaurants I won't mention here. Just don't go expecting some high falutin fancy place. It is more of a local dive. One last comment. Almost every time I have gone there, it has had many tables filled with people speaking Chinese. You know that a Chinese restaurant with a healthy Chinese clientele has to be good."], ["Linda P.", "Kim Wah first caught my eye with it's colorful bubble tea menu posted in the front window. I later took my family to eat there, and I was exposed to a completely different San Antonio Chinese cuisine experience.There are two menus: \"Americanized\" and \"authentic.\" I have to admit that the authentic menu was a bit overwhelming with its numerous selections. The waitress recommended the tofu clay pot which was outstanding. A nice accompaniment was the steamed buns and avocado bubble tea. We dined on a Sunday night, and there were many Asian families there. I paid close attention to the way they used the lazy Susan found on the larger tables to share several dishes. They are advertising an awesome Chinese New Year celebration complete with dancers and an enticing authentic menu. Unfortunately, it falls on Superbowl Sunday. If you ever have occasion to try Kim Wah, please forego the Americanized version of Chinese food and take a chance on something authentic and new. You won't be sorry :)"], ["Aria M.", "No Chinese restaurant has ever made me have cravings during the week!Friendly service, great food, and yummy boba drinks! (I recommend the taro milk mmm!)Also, the peking duck and walnut shrimp are a home run. Just try it- you will never be disappointed!"], ["Jack W.", "A bit off the beaten track but worth the drive. Located in a strip mall with the door sporting Zagat \u00a0rated and Yelp stickers. \u00a0The wall held a collection of reviews. So far so good.  \u00a0 We were provided with the white bread menu. A plastic card with a limited number of choices. Confusion I see a picture of a roasted duck but none offered on the menu. Our waitress quickly produced the Chinese menu in english which offered duck and a nice selection of Chinese dishes. We went with roast duck and walnut shrimp. Sharing the dishes we were impressed with both. The steamed rice was perfect. Dessert was green tea ice cream. Again another great item. \u00a0 If you are looking for good Chinese in SA Kim Wah hits the spot."], ["Matthew K.", "For a city that has very little selection in traditional style Chinese food, this is a place that brings me some nostalgic feelings of being back in my hometown. The only major disappointment for me was that they didn't have the roast pork (siu yok). I actually went here a couple of times before posting this review, so I think I can now place this at the top of my list for Chinese food in San Antonio. They had some very traditional style dishes in addition to dishes for those uninitiated in the true arts of Chinese cooking =) **Disclaimer: I haven't really bothered to try the americanized food on the menu so if you read this review and expect the orange chicken and broccoli beef is going to be awesome and it's not, please try not to bash my review.The Spicy Beef Noodle Soup is great. Soft chunks of beef and a little bit of chewy and gelatinous connective tissues (trust me it's good) in a rich, dark, spicy beef broth. The BBQ plate comes with your choice of two meats I had the steamed chicken (chik gai) and BBQ pork (char siu). It's definitely not Sam Woo BBQ. But it does satisfy the urge for some Chinese BBQ. I also tried the Eggplant with Minced Pork and Spicy Bean Sauce and the Kim Wah Tofu. Both of these are must try dishes.For those of you who want to try something a little more traditional, flip towards the back pages of the menu, try something new. Your sense of adventure will be rewarded."], ["elsa f.", "This is the best Chinese food in San Antonio with great service to boot. I brought my mom here during her visit, and she still speaks of how much she liked the order of pan fried snow pea leaves. I like to order from their specials menu most of the time. My husband likes their beef fried noodles, which is his usual whenever we're at a Chinese restaurant. The Singapore noodles are pretty tasty, but not always consistent. When it's good, IT IS GOOD. I like it when Singapore Noodles are full of curry with extra hot chili sauce...but not suicidal hot. The staff is always sweet. And from what we can see on Kim Wah's wall of recognition, they've been highly regarded by plenty of other clients as well."], ["Lin C.", "I've always been weary of the Chinese restaurants here in San Antonio and never had the guts to try to eat at any of the nearby Chinese restaurants here. Let me tell ya, I am Chinese/Taiwanese and lived in Taiwan over the summer so I can assure you that Kim Wah serves very authentic Chinese and Taiwanese cuisine. The people here are very nice too. The menu is divided into 2 sections: American Chinese food and authentic Chinese food [the pages with Chinese characters]. I went with a group of 8 other friends, and I told them to only order from the authentic Chinese food menu. Among 3 of my friends, we shared seven dishes which was more than enough. One of my friends who is also Chinese/Taiwanese (but born and raised in Asia) agreed that Kim Wah serves very delicious and authentic Chinese cuisine. I strongly recommend:-congee with preserved egg ~ Congee, or porridge, has something I've eaten my entire life for breakfast--my mom frequently cooks this so I can say that this was pretty satisfying. Sharing one bowl among 4 people is good enough.-black pepper beef ~ Mmm the beef was so tender. -sauteed hollow veggies with garlic ~ This is a hugely popular veggie in Taiwan and sooo yummy-Kim Wah tofuThey also have bubble tea for $2.50 each, $2.95 if it's a slushie. I didn't order one, but the rest of my friends did and seemed to really like it. The prices here are moderate, actually cheaper than other Chinese restaurants in SoCal. I would definitely come here again. The food is not very greasy, and it seems like they don't use MSG in their food. I normally get stomach aches from eating Chinese food, but I had no side effects from eating at Kim Wah!"], ["Angela T.", "A definite solid 4 stars!! YAY, I found good Chinese food in San Antonio!! WOOT WOOT! This is the place I go to when I'm sick as a dog and craving some Chinese porridge (our version of chicken noodle soup!). They have good roast duck and pretty delicious wet beef chow fun. The hubby is a huge fan of the Kim Wah special clay pot that has a sizzling, gravy filled mixed bowl of tofu, shrimp and veggies. Kim Wah is definitely as close to authentic Chinese food as I've gotten during my time here in San Antonio. And to top it off, the ladies who work there are super nice and are always accommodating."], ["Sergey F.", "Thank you, Yelp, for showing me this one! I decided that I was missing good Chinese food. So I opened Yelp and read recommendations. Found this place, visited it twice since and was very happy about everything both times. Tasty food, friendly service. And the best bubble drinks I ever tried.Can't recommend any food yet as I just ate only the tip of this cool iceberg."], ["Kira T.", "Good chinese food in San Antonio is a scarce commodity, but this place delivers. As first timers, we had to try the Peking duck, which comes with soup and buns. However, they only had 1/2 a duck and no soup, but it was delicious nonetheless. The duck was crispy and moist, and the steamed buns were light and fluffy.I also tried the Kim Wah tofu, which was equally delicious, although I \u00a0added a little bit of the homemade chili oil to give it some kick.I definitely recommend Kim Wah if you are in the mood for good authentic chinese."], ["Spartacus L.", "This is how I would rate each category:Food: \u00a04Service: 2Price in relation to serving size: 2The regular fried rice is awful awful, but their authentic style Chinese meals are delicious. \u00a0The problem is that the servings are quite small for the price. \u00a0I don't mind paying , but I'd like to leave full if I'm going to pay that much. \u00a0Don't expect any kind of friendly service. \u00a0It's not that their rude, but it certainly makes it painful to leave a tip for the poor service."], ["Tofu N.", "If you wish to have authentic Chinese foods and ready to pay more for it, go to Kim Wah.

First time I walked in the door the place was filled with Chinese families (note: this is a good thing). Their menu is many many pages long, with your standard white-washed \"Chinese\" food in the front, and more authentic stuff in the back. The staff is nice enough, but sometimes there's only 1 or 2 ladies on hand, and they can forget about you and neglect to look your direction. Their Cantonese beef chow fun is delish and a personal fave of mine since I was a kid so perhaps I'm biased. Prices are decent, it really depends on what you order. It's set up in a big strip mall, with plenty of parking. Their bubble tea is O-K, a tad too sweet but they know how to make the tapioca balls chewy."], ["Babul M.", "Skip Cici's next door.

And it comes on special every Monday 11-4 (for $5.29) and comes with a soup and side. Portions and prices are more than reasonable for a nice sit down quiet place to have lunch.My only concern was the \"sea food\" in particular the calamari which was absolutely terrible. I wasn't sure if it was chicken or some sort of tainted fish, but we told an employee and it was taken off our tab:) (other sea food items look questionable;wouldn't recommend it).But overall south garden is an above average place to eat."], ["Adrian P.", "This is my second attempt after my first attempt months ago was disappointing. The egg drop soup tasted fresh and flavorful. Lemon chicken dish was better than average. Moist chicken and the batter wasn't overwhelming . I chose steam rice just as a preference but it does comes with pork fried rice at no extra cost. Wife got the combination lo mein and OMG is was so flavorful and tasty and a great smelling meal. The only criticism is that the noodles were amazing but the chicken in the lo mein was flavorless and brought he dish down. If it was only noodles and vegetables it would be perfect. I'd suggest no chicken cuz it tastes like it was frozen then refrozen 20 times. There were only a few pieces of chicken so it was easy to remove. Just put the chicken pieces to the side and enjoy the noodles. The pork slices in the lo mein had flavor and was a touch chewy for my taste but they were thin slices so it was ok. The shrimp in the lo mein was certainly overcooked but the sauce kept the shrimp moist enough and the flavor in the shrimp holds up great during the cooking process. The egg roll in the meal had a good balance and taste of flavor inside but the wrapping on the outside was cooked softer then id prefer. I'd hope for more of a crunch when I eat an egg roll but the flavor was on point. Service was consistently good and I have no complaints on the level of attention my table got. Overall a good experience and I would return again."], ["Jennifer L.", "I wasn't impressed I ordered shrimp fried rice and egg rolls.
