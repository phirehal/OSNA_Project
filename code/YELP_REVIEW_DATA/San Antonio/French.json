I had seen great reviews about Frederick's a few times before but always managed to forget about it until now. The restaurant itself is VERY tiny and a bit cramped with odd hand painted stenciling on the walls, but the space somehow works well. We were seated for about 5 minutes prior to anyone getting our drink order and then wating 10 more minutes to see if we'd be getting any menus (apparently you have to ask to get a menu). After that mild irritation everything went off spotlessly. We ordered clams casino and the escargot as appetizers which were both excellent. The lobster bisque and ceaser salad with anchovy dressing were too tempting to pass up and they were both very tasty. Ah the mains. I ordered the truffled sea bass with artichokes and veggies and it was by far the favorite at the table. The fish was cook and seasoned perfectly, and so delicate it could be cut with a butter knife. \u00a0The sauteed shrimp and herb crusted lamb chops were ordered by the other people in my party and both were enjoyed. The lamb is a close second to my sea bass. They were perfectly cooked without overdoing it on the herbs so that the true flavor of the meat shone through. Everything was devine. How often can you order a desert called the \"Floating Island?\" As it goes with most of my decisions, it lean towards the more off-beat option and boy am I glad this one totally panned out. A light meringue covered in almond slivers and powdered sugar floating in a sea of the most decadent creme you've ever tasted. This is a must try item."], ["Cleo M.", "The only reason I went to Frederick's is because a (quite wealthy) friend was visiting and wanted to try some of the more upscale restaurants in San Antonio, and this is one of the places she was set on eating at. We came on a double date and after seeing the interior decor and the prices on the menu, I expected MUCH more out of this restaurant than what we actually got.The food isn't bad, by any means; I had a breaded seafood dish and it was quite tasty. My problem with it is that the portions are so incredibly stingy! My fish ended up being mostly dry because of how little sauce they put on it (and, yes, it needed the sauce), and there was such a small quantity of anything else on the plate that I actually finished my entire meal. That NEVER happens. But, I digress: after the relatively underwhelming main course, my boyfriend and I decided to share the opera cake dessert and that's where I got really peeved. It was $12, if I remember correctly, for the tiniest sliver of cake that was just longer than the length of my longest finger and maybe 1.5 inches thick. That was NOT okay with me.Also worth mentioning is that we waited an excruciatingly long amount of time for both our main courses and our desserts, despite the fact that the restaurant only had two other tables at the moment. I don't know if that is something that usually happens or not, but that is another reason it isn't getting more than two stars. The ambiance was also incredibly drab and I never really felt comfortable at any point during our meal.I understand that some of my complaints are so-called \"nuances\" of fine dining, if it can be called such, but I just don't think it's right to charge so much for a significantly smaller portion of \"higher-quality\" food.

When grilled, I like to have them with double boned. But when sauteed as they were, I prefer them to be cut. They were a little too pink for medium in the middle. Also, and this goes for all the potatoes, just not really that tasty. Sea bass was terrific. The sauce and the crispyness from the pan searing was just right. Again the vegetables, particularly the potatoes were hard and dry.Service was OK.

The food here was pretty awful for the price. I ordered the goat cheese with bio-grapes tart, the veal scallopini, and turtle cake. Our waiter was relatively friendly and helped explained what things were on the menu. The food however was bad and the portions were kind of small for the 40-ish dollars I paid. I was definitely hungry later, so it was not satisfying or filling.Food:Goat Cheese with biogrape tart: 5/5 This was the only thing I had that I enjoyed. I thought the appetizer was unique. It tasted kind of Mediterranean because of how they prepared the grapes. It tasted like dolma but with a pastry and greens on the side. The pastry tart was prepared well; nice and fluffy. Veal Scallopini: 2/5. Veal was really tough. The mushroom sauce was okay/average. The noodles that came with it were just seasoned with salt and pepper I think. It was pretty bland. The veggies were cooked well. The meat portion was pretty tiny for an entree. It was just one skinny piece of veal about the size of chicken strip. I still can't believe I paid $40 bucks for this. Turtle Tart: 1/5 Difficult to eat if you don't like 90% dark chocolate. It was really really really bitter and couldn't finish it. I wasn't aware it was dark chocolate either. There wasn't a description on the menu. I also took a look at what some of my other friends got and tasted a few things: Fries: 1/5. Pretty bad. Overcooked and brown. Crispy because they were kind of burnt. Melon carpaccio: 1/5. Bad concept. Ham and thinly sliced melon don't go together. My friend was super unsatisfied with the appetizer. My friend got the pork butt curry which she said was good, but still I wouldn't pay $40 for pork. The portion was also small. Another friend got the skate with fries. The fish looked tiny and sad and in my opinion not worth $40. Price: Not worth it. Small portions and low quality of food. I'd rather get a nice steak.

The other appetizers that we tried were the foie gras (which was a smaller portion than we expected even by foie gras standards), the escargot (quite tasty) and the lentil soup (quite thin/brothy for lentil soup). \u00a0Overall, it was a good start to the meal.For entrees, we had the grilled quail with proscuitto risotto, beef tenderloin, and two cassoulets, one of their specials that day. \u00a0One of our friends asked the waiter to surprise him with his entree and the waiter ended up choosing the same entree as my husband, hence two cassoulets. \u00a0I found this a bit odd but I suppose the waiter didn't realize we would share and give each other tastes of our entrees. \u00a0The quail had good flavor, which can be hard to accomplish, the tenderloin was cooked appropriately and the cassoulet was good but had more tomatoes than expected. \u00a0Rounded out by good beer & wine and some adequate desserts, all around this meal was a success.As a side note: Our friend has a severe mushroom allergy and did have trouble finding an entree that did not include mushrooms in some way, as an FYI to other mushroom-allergy, EpiPen-carrying diners."], ["RT S.", "We had steak and duck confit.

They also have an excellent selection of wines which can be matched by the wait staff if you don't feel too confident in this area.The only caution I have is not to waste too much time before you go. \u00a0You'll have absolutely no regrets."], ["Alberto L.", "Fantastic place to take your special someone or a small group for some superb French fare. \u00a0Prices are along the lines of a higher end restaurant however it is absolutely worth it. \u00a0The atmosphere and attitude of the staff does not reflect the attitude often encountered on those small high end restaurants. \u00a0 Both my wife and I loved it. \u00a0 Can't wait to go again."], ["Mat M.", "delicious lunch with superlative service. I had excellent pheasant aux champignons, the special. started with the escargot, which were superb, although I would have liked more butter sauce"], ["Chris L.", "My wife and I went out for our 1st anniversary dinner. The food was great. She had the Lobster Bisque and Veal Chop, I had the Bouillabaisse and Sole. We had a bottle of French Chardonnay and a Chocolate Truffle Tart. The wine list is extensive, and varies in price from in the 30's up to triple digits. The menu has plenty to chose from and the deserts were hard to choose also. It all looked so good The food was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent. The meal itself would have made the evening, but when it came time to pay the bill something great happened... Our check got picked up by a couple at an adjacent table that was there for their 53rd anniversary. Holy cow, that was like a 150ish tab that they picked up. Nice people, every once in while I am really surprised at the generosity of some people. THANK YOU."], ["Bronwyn W.", "This is my first \"not paying attention to the bf's comments\" review. We made a reservation on Saturday night for some app sharing (obviously not something they are not used to here by our waitress's reaction). We are seated and greeted promptly, given the list of specials for the evening, and told we'd be given a few minutes to look over our options and make decisions. This is where our experiences diverge, and I'll be giving mine only for the most part... Water and bread stayed full the entire evening. Never even had to think about that. The bread was great, too, so I was glad it kept coming. We ordered escargots, which were really well prepared, just lacking a bit of salt. We also have tempura lobster tail, which also was well prepared. The breading was a little greasy, which is actually a plus when talking lobster because without fat, it can be pretty boring for a luxury meat. The lightly-dressed side salad served with it was perfect for cutting the grease of the breading. We also go the onion tart with Brie, which was exactly that, a custard-y onion tart with a slice of Brie on top drizzled with a balsamic vinegar or reduction of some kind. Super simple, super tasty. Texture was very creamy and custard-like when it first arrived, then more quiche-like as it cooled, and was very enjoyable both ways. We selected wines by the glass to go with our apps, and both were quite good. The full list was rather extensive and very well selected from what I saw. We passed on dessert (my choosing because of way less chi-chi things I craved at the time like a beer float and some French fries). People watching and listening here was kinda fun. We dubbed the place \u00dcby's during our visit--\u00fcber-Luby's. I had to be the youngest person in the dining area by at least a decade. I'd give the average age of the dining room as 55. It really felt like a neighborhood place--a lot of old Olmos Park money dining out that evening. If this is the usual clientele, not bad for making money, but not pushing it to be cutting edge or innovative either. And also makes chefs hesitant to use salt. We ask for our check and inform the waitress that we have a groupon. Trouble begins... let's just say a ton of excuses were given, and I got my discount. I understood, but the excuses all added up to the Vatel Group being remiss in getting the numbers of the coupons they sold and tracking them. I was actually a bit upset by that part, and it was more because I'd have rather gone to the restaurant they'd initially sold the groupon for (Ciel off Stone Oak which has since closed) and not Bistro Vatel. I thought our server was great until this issue arose. The bf was already displeased with the service (not the water and bread kids--they rocked), so this argument did nothing to help out her tip, as he was covering any groupon overage. All-in-all, I'd totally come back for the French fare and especially for the $42 prix fixe, but I'd just have a hard time convincing the bf."], ["Bettina R.", "I'm a lucky girl-- I have lots of family in San Antonio who spoil me with lovely birthday meals at awesome local places, one of which was Bistro Vatel. I'm so glad my sister directed me to this place, because I can already tell it's the kind of place I'll visit again. The interior is cozy and intimate, if a little strangely decorated. The restaurant sign outside could be considered an indicator of this. It's more like a banner--white with black font--that boldly announces the name of the restaurant in VERY large and not so attractive typeface. The floor inside is tiled with a kind of plain-jane commercial looking tile. So, okay, the place could maybe use a little face lift. But guess what? I love it anyway. I haven't been in San Antonio long, but it doesn't seem like the kind of place that's bursting at the seams with authentic European fare. This place really shines with this exact quality. \u00a0Our server was French, and I had the added benefit of dining with a Frenchman as well (my sister's boyfriend), so the two of them were able to zero in on some outstanding French wines to complement our meal, which, by the way, was outstanding. We started with an order of escargot, which may have been the best I've had yet. Not overly dressed in butter, and the texture was perfect--not at all rubbery. I had a salade lyonnaise (frisee with bacon lardons and a poached egg) that was executed well. The egg wasn't overcooked in the least, the greens weren't overly dressed, and the lardons added the perfect amount of smoky salty pork flavor. I had the grilled seafood entree (I *always* end up ordering seafood-- I just love it), which was a generous bounty of grilled fishes, shrimp, and scallops, and it was awesome, awesome, awesome. My dad had the bouillabaisse, a tomato broth-based fish stew. It was out of this world good, and the coq au vin-- a tender chicken braised in red wine and served with hearty raosted vegetables--was appropriately rich and comforting. Maybe not seasonally appropriate, but hey, it wasn't my oven cranked on high for hours, so no bother. We ended (yes, we're little gluttons sometimes) our meal with the decadent and very rich chocolate tart. Oh. My. God. Seriously, there's nothing that I sampled that I didn't love. I wish I had made it out again for Restaurant Week, but no matter--I'll go again, reduced prix fixe menu or not."], ["Jill L.", "Traditional French favorites (if you are looking for French fusion, this is not the place), ample array of solid wines, tired and rather depressing atmosphere, adequate but not exceptional service. Best dish on the menu is the coq au vin."], ["Sam W.", "I went to Bistro Vatel for the first time during restaurant week where I ate one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. It was tender, juicy, and excellently seasoned. I love how they stick to the French classics without introducing some sort of fusion aspect. Sometimes you just want to east some escargot, ya know? I'm looking forward to returning and having another steak frites!"], ["Natalia C.", "SA Restaurant Week splurge! $15 for lunch, plus a few dollars for a cafe au lait with dessert. I was definitely impressed with the whole experience, especially the discreet and courteous staff, but I found some of the art on the walls less than equal to the general ambiance and food. The quality of the ingredients really shines here, as does the presentation. I'm definitely happy and I would come here again, especially because studying the menu, I realized the prices aren't bad at all, even if it's not restaurant week!"], ["Sophie D.", "I like this little place. The service is great and they treat you like part of the family.

Be prepared when you go because the restaurant is expensive. \u00a0My only issue is the actual building, which was clearly a strip mall at one time, does not create an ambiance that is on par with the food. \u00a0Of course, the owners of this restaurant also own bistro bakery which is directly across the street so it makes logistical sense that they have bistro vatel there. I would definetely recommend this place to anyone."], ["Johnny O.", "I think expectations are high for (fairly expensive) French food (I spent about $200 for two on Valentines day), and I have to say I was a little disappointed in some ways with my first experience at Bistro Vatel, though it had a couple of highlights.The location is nice and quaint - on the round-a-bout in Olmos Park. \u00a0I found the interior to be not as upscale as I was expecting but nice. \u00a0We may have to re-visit, as the Valentines prix fixe menu was the only thing available and left a little to be desired on selection.First the Highlights...The best thing about the whole evening was the Filet Mignon. \u00a0It was PERFECTLY seasoned and cooked - one of the best steaks I've ever had in fact.The other highlight was the butter - It was perfectly salted and served at just the right temperature - with some very nice crusty bread. \u00a0It tasted very fresh and homemade.Other than that, everything else was good... but didn't really stand out. \u00a0The shrimp bisque tasted sort of watered down - it didn't really cut the mustard for a rich bisque. \u00a0But, the little croquette served with it almost redeemed it - it was very good.We had some problems with service as well. \u00a0At one point while we were ordering, our waiter seemed to get impatient with us and had to leave for a while. \u00a0We got the bread and butter almost at the end of the first course. \u00a0I asked the waiter to recommend some wine pairings for our courses and he did so before he knew what we were ordering, and seemed to just pick a couple - maybe they were his favorites. \u00a0They ended up being good, but I was hoping for a more engaging experience - perhaps with a sommelier - for the wine recommendation. \u00a0The experience also felt a bit rushed - something that would never happen in France - it wasn't the slow food 'gastronomie' I was hoping for.We'll probably be back to try again - Valentines is a hard night. \u00a0The $34 Prix Fixe the other reviewer mentions seems to be more in line price-wise with our experience. \u00a0I probably would do 3.5 if I could, but I just couldn't go all the way to 'Yay! I'm a fan.'.. but, maybe next time."], ["Chandra G.", "A beacon of lovely French light in the land of cheese enchilada darkness. \u00a0A great selection of French classics on the menu, extensive wine list, surprising specials, and reasonable prices.

I came with a group this evening and I'll start off by saying the service was great. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Where everything fell short was in the food. I started with a mixed salad that felt a bit underdressed and just bland. For the entree, I ordered the rib eye. I asked for it to be cooked medium and it was a solid medium rare. In addition, the meat itself was extremely fatty. I know a rib eye should be marbled with fat but this one had huge chunks of grizzle to the point that about 40% was left sitting on the plate. The dessert I ordered was a chocolate spiced cake. The cake was dry and crumbly and had clearly been overcooked.I'm not sure if the group (there were about 15 of us) was a bit overwhelming for the restaurant or if this is normal, but for an acclaimed chef, I truly expected more from this restaurant."], ["Camille C.", "The best happy hour in San Antonio.

There is a happy hour with half priced drinks and appetizers. The dining area is crowded, actually the day I ate there an elderly person fell and had to be taken away by ambulance. The dress code is casual but can be dressy. There is an entry from the Embassy Suites (no connection so food can't be charged to the room) so many people are in lounge around clothes. It's a French themed restaurant so lots of seafood options. I will definitely eat here again and try another dish."], ["Jacqueline J.", "As I was browsing YELP last week in the events calendar, I discovered a link that displayed the many restaurants in the San Antonio area that were participating in Restaurant Week. I bookmarked nearly 50 for future tasting engagements and decided on Sunday to dine at Luke on the River walk, within the Embassy Suites Hotel. \u00a0I consider myself a Foodie/ Southern Belle and found some of the Southern items a bit pricey for the portions offered. I also found it hard to pay $27 for a bowl of Shrimp and Grits but did see some HH menu items i.e. oysters and empanadas I'd like to return and try. After browsing YELP photos I ultimately went with the menu items for restaurant week. The Meal~Appetizer: Grilled Watermelon - The helpful hostess offered this over the other item (can't remember what it was) but this was an EPIC Fail. The watermelon was slightly burnt and served alongside some brown sauce that did not taste edible. The plate arrangement was beautiful but the food looked better than it tasted. \u00a0I believe the fruit of peaches and watermelon were served atop a bed of feta (putrid) smelling cheese.. No bueno~Entr\u00e9e: Blue Crabmeat Cavatelli /gnocchi - This dish righted the wrong of the first selection and was an elegant arrangement of lump blue crab meat, heirloom baby tomatoes and gnocchi mixed in a light tomato sauce. It was seasoned to perfection and the gnocchi was prepared in house and was a perfect al dente. I wanted to savor every bite and could not believe how well the flavors and spices married together to complete this amazing dish.Desert: Peach upside down cake with Vanilla Ice Cream - this was yet another amazing selection that was recommended as a favorite by the manager who made rounds in the dining area. The desert hit the spot and was the perfect curtain call to this Restaurant Week meal. Not to sweet but just enough sugar to get the glucose up and flowing in the arteries. \u00a0I savored every bite and was glad it was offered in the $35 round up of their three course meal.All in all a great meal minus the app. \u00a0The hotel offers valet parking and if you get your ticket validated parking is only $7.00.

All their southern/texas food had a French twist to it... You have no idea what you're getting into until it lands on your plate. We really liked the Oysters, Hush puppies and crab tartins.

It seem unlikely to mess up raw oysters at a Cajun/creole restaurant but half of them were sliding into the ice which ruins them. The crab risotto was just gross I would be ashamed to serve that at my house they must have dumped a cup of heavy cream in it and just about zero crab. The baked oysters were bland.

Came here last Friday for dinner, before the martin show. Eagerly anticipated this place for quiet some time now and finally made it out here and to the illustrious happy hour! Alcohol, oysters, duck sliders, a peach tartatain, I believe I spelled that incorrectly. The alcoholic drinks are 50% off and incredible French 75 is something you need to be acquainted with! Cognac, although not cognac by definition they use brandy, champagne, lemon juice, and a egg white foam. Easily best thing I tried, they also have wine by the glass, half, and whole bottle on sale as well as local craft beers. So with all this in mind we were seated promptly in front of the kitchen upstairs about 10 min before hh ended and I ordered several of each, a dz oyster, the peach app, and the duck slider. A bottle of a rose, some French 75 to start as well. The server we had was very young, seemed a bit nervous, and wss not as knowledgeable as I would have liked but he was friendly. He brought out the drinks and the sliders and peach app first, and my gf and I started our dining experience. The duck slider was cold and had not a lot going on for it while the \u00a0peach \u00a0appwas delicious seasonal peaches that were grilled nicely served on a crustini served with goat cheese. It was refreshing but very small for 2$ same with the slider for 3$, the oysters are definitely the route to go. After not seeing our waiter for about 15 min, my gf and I got up went downstairs and went to the bar, and proceeded are culinary and drinking adventure. We ordered hush puppies, fries, more drinks and more oysters, this time east coast cold waters, a lil smaller but so much cleaner imo in taste. Got to interact nicely with the bartenders and more importantly a young gentleman who shucked the oysters that evening, and learned a few things from him as well in regards to his craft. All the while the manager, checking on us making sure everything was going smoothly after the upstairs experience we received. This alone will bring me back to luke, they even offered the dessert menu to us but the show was calling, so we politely had to decline.

I got up three times to closer the door myself and even asked the wait staff to remember to close it to no avail.While waiting for our drinks and a manager named Diedra came over to share what she referred to as a \"funny story\" about how she googled my name after seeing my reservation on open table. I told her that we'd just gotten married earlier in the day and she then proceeded to tell us how marriage changes things and can cause a relationship not to work along with some other inappropriate remarks. We were all dumbfounded by her weirdness. \u00a0She then came back a few minutes later to show me a picture of gay couple she knew that recently married. Her blatantly rude behavior upset my wife so much that she began to cry. \u00a0Two burgers that we ordered medium were overcooked and one of the buns fell on the floor shortly after the waitress set the plate down and were sent back. \u00a0At this point the flies were becoming such a nuisance we finally asked to be moved to another table. \u00a0By this time the two other dishes that were served were cold as it took them a bit to move everything. \u00a0Finally, one of our friends spoke to one of the managers about the situation and they comped some items and brought us a champagne toast. \u00a0Your inappropriate \"manager\" finally came over and apologized for the inconvenience.To make matters worse a fraudulent charge was made on our credit card for $403.97 at 10:30pm the same evening. This charge was made by phone and your restaurant was the ONLY place we used this card that day. \u00a0I suspect the credit card information was stolen at your restaurant but have no way of knowing for sure. \u00a0 Horrible service and now having to deal with a credit card fraud is an outrage to say the least. \u00a0The whole experience ruined what should have otherwise been a joyous evening. \u00a0I can't find words to express my disappointment and disbelief. \u00a0Needless to say, we won't be dining there again."], ["Natty P.", "Great restaurant in San Antonio!

Just saying that with the excellent selection of regional and truly local beers, a little training would go a long way towards the whole high-end experience you're going for. Food. Had the (peeled!) cherry tomato, grilled corn salad and it was SO good and refreshing - tasted right off the vine and perfectly dressed.

It was delicious. It is slightly on the sweet side but my boyfriend loved it. For our entrees, I ordered the grilled snapper off the special for the evening with a side of fries and added four grilled shrimp to mine and my boyfriend ordered the mussels and fries. Trey said the mussels are very good so that definitely made him lean towards that decision. Our food came out and I was very disappointed with mine. The highlight was the fries. The snapper was cold and the shrimp was small and overcooked giving it a very rubbery texture. My boyfriend like the mussels except for the fact that they were all so tiny. That's something that our server should have told us before ordering. Maybe something between the lines like \"since it is the start of the season, the mussels are smaller but they are worth it.\" All in all, the food and drinks were overpriced but we did have a good meal.

This was served with some over salted french fries that did not get much attention from any of us (In & Out can deliver fries, but Luke's can not, go figure).For dessert my kids took great delight in the Gateau Basque (vanilla cake, Pear William sabayon, seasonal jam). It was a truly fantastic dessert, but could not save this review.Unfortunately later in the evening my entire meal came back up. I suspect it was bad seafood.

The expectation was high. It did not live up to it.I hate to sound like an elitist yuppie here, but I have to mention this: Upon walking in, I noticed that the waitstaff was in faux white dinner jackets. It looked cheap--the jackets were wrinkled and covered in food stains. Gross. It felt unclean and unkempt. The hostess was wearing a too-tight tunic and skintight yoga pants--unprofessional and unappetizing. We asked to sit on the patio (on the Riverwalk) and right away noticed about four tables that were abandoned and dirty--and they remained this way throughout the meal. Can you imagine no one bussing a table for over an hour? There was also a large table nearby that decided to feed a gaggle of pigeons and sparrows that were swarming the patio. More than once a bird nearly flew into us because they were tossing bread on the patio. I mentioned this was annoying to our server and he shrugged. This table also had a dog with them that was roaming the patio off-leash. Now, I don't know the San Antonio laws on pets, but this chihuahua was not a service dog, and an upscale restaurant didn't seem the place for it.We ordered the bam bam shrimp, which was fine. I had the etouffee. The rice was dry and clumpy and the shrimp was overcooked (tough, hard to get the tail off). The flavors were OK, but overall it seemed too sweet. The food was really no better than what you'd receive at any casual restaurant outside a suburban mall. And the cost was $25-30 per plate? I'm sorry. I'm fine with spending good money on good food (that's what I came here to do!). But the ambiance and quality of food here was such a letdown.

Our server Matthew was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable of the menu, attentive, cheerfully answered our bizarre questions about the kitchen, and mindful of both our and other patrons' schedules as many of us were there before a Majestic Theater performance and therefore on a schedule. I observed at least four front of the house managers of some variety watching over service, and we were checked on twice during the meal to ensure things were good (in addition to the expected \"How is your appetizer / entree / dessert?\" from Matthew). When one server was going downstairs or to the kitchen and needed something quickly for a table, another server or busser was asked to get it for the diner ASAP.Now on to the food. It was absolutely delicious and in my opinion, perfectly portioned. I had the beet salad, blue crab cavatelli, and shared the gateau blanc for dessert. Everything was fresh, presented beautifully, prepared perfectly, and absolutely delicious. My companion had the crab & avocado salad and entrecote & frites, and she was also extremely pleased. Although it wasn't listed on the cocktail menu, Matthew also was able to get me a Moscow Mule.The restaurant had opened the upstairs dining area that evening and was seating diners going to the theater or wanting a quieter, cozier experience in that area. They even asked what we thought of that, which I will reiterate was wonderful. The views up there are very nice, and it is definitely much quieter than downstairs.

He explained he was new and would have to find the answer to our questions from someone else, which was disappointing.The mimosas and Bloody Mary did not let down and were very tasty. We ordered numerous carafes. The nice thing about the mimosas was that it wasn't just orange juice, we had options of mixing other juices such as: strawberry, cranberry, pineapple, and raspberry. The food while good was not something I'd necessarily brag about. My chicken and waffles were a little dry for my taste and the pancake plate looked very sad. My favorite thing we tried was the crab beignets. They were absolutely delicious but very very tiny and overpriced for their size. Major brownie points for having a coupon if you check in.

We sat in the bar/lounge on a beautiful French styled settee/ love seat with lots of pillows. We got comfy and ordered the house Cabernet, which was a decent one for sure. $6 a glass. Not bad at all. The happy hour menu looked great, but I was looking for a lower carb choice. My friend ordered the potatoes gratin. The potatoes were slightly undercooked. I would've sent back for a few more mins, but she did not. The flavor though was great. The lounge server recommended the Brussels sprout salad to me. Oh wow! It was to DIE for! We met the owner and he told us about the special Persian style lamb he prepares only on Saturdays. \u00a0We got into a long conversation with him, as my friend was practicing her French with the French speaking part of the staff. The owner Raymond insisted I try his shirazi salad that he makes on Saturdays and had his chef whip up a sample for me! Oh my gosh! It was amazing. Raymond, the owner was very friendly and invited us back for Saturday's lamb. I haven't had the chance to get their on a Saturday yet, but am looking forward to trying it soon.

For $15 you get bottom-less mimosas, which isn't an amazing bargain, but for how much our table drank it was pretty great. We had our choice of pineapple, cranberry, orange and grapefruit juice to choose with our champagne carafe. Upon request they can mix the juices for you, but we chose to do it ourselves to see what kind of magical concoctions we could create. I ordered the Short Rib Burger and it was good, I think I was more jealous of my friends who ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict, which were delicious! Only issue with my burger was that on the menu it says there is Bacon on it, and the actual order had no Bacon. The server was also confused when I asked where the Bacon was...now I'm pretty serious about my Bacon so I had to order some on the side to place on my burger. Besides that one issue I had nothing else to complain about the service or the food/beverages. One more thing...don't order the Creme Brulee...it was the worst tasting one I've ever had...ever! \u00a0One thing...Tost has a DJ that comes in around noon-ish and it becomes almost like a clubby vibe in the bar area, but we were sitting in the dining area which drowns out some of the music. Our server explained that the music would get louder once the DJ \u00a0started playing, but that didn't quite happen.

If you are coming to enjoy some good conversation then I suggest the dining area."], ["Sarah F.", "To keep it short and to the point....this place is no longer what it used to be.

After seeing that area, we would still be able to hear the music but not to the blasting levels that I just experienced in the Lounge.The managers/owners were extremely friendly and service was great. I had the Traditional Egg Benedict which was delicious. My friend had the French toast and portion looked small, so she added two eggs which seemed like a must to be full afterwards. Another friend offered the Ribeye and Eggs which was a very large portion.Everyone finished their food and had an excellent time. We stayed for a total of 2 hours and had the unlimited mimosas.

(Let it be known that I have been to Tost multiple times throughout the years and have always been very impressed with whatever meal I had. For this reason exactly is why I chose to make reservations at Tost on Valentines day! Me and my boyfriend have both worked in the service industry and we knew that because it was Valentine's night there would probably be a prix-fixe menu and it probably wouldn't be as good as the regular fare, but we were excited anyway! )First of all, the Valentine's prix-fixe dinner was $85 a pop. Which is fine on a special occasion, if you're getting your moneys worth! The menu itself LOOKED promising, but a little plain. The courses and our experiences with them were as followsLobster Bisque - literally tasted and looked like lobster bisque from a can, with lots of heavy cream added. Don't get me wrong: it was delicious, but it was too simple of a dish to be impressive. I could have made this at home easily.Apple Salad - Literally two slices of apple on a small handful of lettuce with a vinaigrette so light that you couldn't taste it. Blue cheese and bacon bits on top. AGAIN: Could have made this at home EASILY. And cheaply. Oysters Rockefeller - This one I am conflicted about how to explain. My boyfriend best described it when he said, \"This tastes like Hamburger Helper.\" The oysters were freshly pulled out of the oven and HOT, and appeared to simply be covered in cheese. Baffling.Steak and Shrimp - This is the course that made us realize we had been truly taken advantage of at 85 american dollars per person, and it was at this point in the meal that i genuinely apologized to my boyfriend for taking us here. Nothing on this dish was seasoned well. The potatoes on the side looked and tasted as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long period of time: greasy on the outside, dry and chalky on the inside. The sprig of broccoli was almost raw, and had absolutely no seasoning, save a tiny pool of some flavorless yellow sauce on top. The \"Coconut-pineapple shrimp\" were devoid of any coconut at a ratio of 70% breading to 30% shrimp and were seated on a tiny sliver of pine apple that only succeeded in making the breading soggy. The steak was alright. It was medium rare, which is what we asked for, but not much else. Any seasoning or marinating was not detectable. Bananas Foster - This one was (just like the Lobster Bisque) good tasting but incredibly simple. The Bananas had just been saut\u00e9ed until they caramelized with brown sugar, and then served with vanilla ice cream. It was also a very, very small serving. And then we paid $200 and went home unsatisfied! Also: There was a pleasant and romantic live acoustic set playing until around 9, when a DJ took over and played 5 Katy Perry songs in a row. We heard \"Fireworks\" twice in a 20 minute time period. Katy Perry is cool and all, but that kind of clubby music playing only added to the cheapness of our meal."], ["A K.", "OK, so I have a friend who is always raving about how much she loves Tost, so I finally went to try it out and I wasn't impressed. Let's start with the positives: the servers are great; they are very attentive and multiple people checked on us to make sure everything was alright. This is not one of those places where your waiter drops off the drinks and disappears. The place was packed, but we still got individual attention. Now (drumroll) onto the food...after looking over the Sunday Funday menu, both my friend and I decided to get the fried chicken on a biscuit with country gravy. There were other things on the menu that sounded good, but both of us were drawn to this dish. When our plates arrived, it looked good enough, but once we started eating, both of us had the same issue...the gravy. The gravy was the thickest gravy I have ever had and quickly congealed into a gelatinous texture that was just gross. I was hungry and didn't wanna make a big fuss, so I just peeled as much of the gravy off as I could and ate the chicken and biscuit. The chicken was well done and the biscuit was...a biscuit so u can't really screw that up. The potatoes were sparse (6 pieces on my plate) and really bland, but who am I kidding, I love potatoes so I ate the few that were on my plate. Overall, I was very underwhelmed by the food (waste of calories!) but appreciated the attention to customer service."], ["Andrya S.", "I was so pleasantly surprised by Tost. We almost didn't go in, as it's in a strip center with neon blue lighting, and the facade seems a bit divey. BUT, the inside is elegant and charming, and the service was fantastic... \u00a0Sean was our server, although he is usually the bar tender, and despite taking care of practically the entire restaurant, he was extremely thorough and took the time to be genuinely interested. He explained everything, brought us a sample of the daily soup (delicious!!) and was light-hearted and conversational, while professional. We were having trouble deciding on what to eat as the menu was varied and everything sounded good. We wound up ordering several appetizers (calamari, ceviche, chicken bites, buffalo sliders) and ordering a Ribeye for the entree. All are home-made, perfectly cooked, and quite delectable. \u00a0The steak was SO amazing. The cook came out personally to check on the food, and was very friendly. The manager then checked on us at the end of the meal and opened the door for us to leave. All in all a lovely experience. As far as I know, they have transformed it from it's previous owner and are doing a wonderful job creating a cozy, unique restaurant perfect for date night or a relaxed but classy outing with friends. Apparently Tost has a brunch and transforms into a lounge on occasion as well, both of which we plan to return to try."], ["Pikki Nikki D.", "I was shocked and disappointed with this facility. Everyone boast that it's the best place for brunch in San Antonio and I find it hard to believe. We arrived right after it opened (no crowd at all) for the day and the host stated that they lost the reservation book, We had a group of 8, so he sat us at a group of couches around a coffee table and we stated that we wanted a table. There was a table with no one sitting at it with 10 chairs and the host walked off. When the waitress arrived we asked to me moved and it was no problem at all. We did not want to be sitting and eating with out plates in out laps. Everything took an extremely long time to get. We received the muffins but no silverware, plates, napkins. The music was extremely loud. People were yelling at each other just to be heard. The waitress misspoke and told everyone the bottomless mimosas were $5 so 4 of the ladies ordered them and were shocked later when they found out they were $15. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and it was \u00a0lacking in everything to be desired. It was room temperature. I asked if anyone's meal was not and not one person's food was even WARM. Runny room temperature eggs...not a great texture. The crispy potatoes were not as they name suggested but soggy. The crab cakes were half dollar sized. I moved from the Maryland area and anyone who's had a real crab cake would be as pissed as I was about the meager portions size. I have no idea how this establishment received it's title but from my experience it did not deserve it. The plus is that the decor was gorgeous and you forget that you were in San Antonio. Great feel.

So bad I could smell it before I mistakenly took a drink to confirm what my brain was telling me. So I ran in and told the bartender who quickly replaced our waters. Good thing to because I waited 23 minutes for my mimosa carafe. As did a few others. The owner was present but not fully engaged with the fiasco going on around him. Meanwhile we waited for service....any service.....but did watch his wife try and put up xmas decorations on the front door for 35min....i'm so glad that was a high prioity on a Sunday when you've got a crowd that cant get bread on there tables like you provide to the tables around us....really. A third person came and took our orders all 20 of us without writing anything down. We prayed she would get it right. I'm a purest write things down. The orders came out at a steady pace but then 3 orders failed to appear. \u00a0Endlessly with no reason no staff apology no stopping by to say Oops we screwed up...everyone is almost done eating when their food arrives with a quick sorry someone grabbed your order by mistake. The eggs Benny were almost hard boiled eggs on one plate. Eventhough the food was good, the painful waiting and confused staff won't help this rating. There were two staff members that were so grossly curt and disrespectful we all almost left. Note to wait staff, your in the Service business provide it or find another line of work. Customers don't require much. Get them started on drinks quickly and the rest is up to the kitchen to fulfill. But ignoring 20 people who I can truthfully say we're Very kind Considering the climate was out of bounds.

I don't come here often, but I always enjoy it.It doesn't look like much from the outside-it's wedged in to a strip mall center and looks tiny from the outside. Inside, it's rather large with a covered patio. They seem to do a great bar business.The atmosphere is definitely striving for a bistro feel, but it comes off more La Madelaine than actual bistro. But too kitschy. The food itself is great. I went on a recent Saturday night and they didn't have any specials, which I found odd. Luckily, the roast chicken and shrimp and grist were great, as were the french fries and brussel sprouts. I love sprouts, and these come with bacon, blue cheese, and a balsamic reduction.One note-they have a number of two tops along the wall with mesh screens separating them. We initially sat at one of these, but it became awkward as we realized that the couple sitting on the other side of the screen was close enough to see and hear. We listened to their first date. Awkward! We changed tables.If you're looking for good standard fare and pretty good prices that's not crowded, try Tost."]], "Bite": [["Daniel W.", "Mmmm bite!

But enough about the decor, my gf and I proceeded to look at the brunch and normal menu as well as their daily specials which all sounded amazing.. Saw several items leaving the kitchen that looked super delish as well as the crazy drinks coming from the bar, but no alcohol for this morning. We settled on an asparagus tomato omlette and a spanish chorizo frittata. And also a cup of coffee. While we waited the brought out an amuse bouche of bacon wrapped brussel sprouts which were good, hard to have something not good when bacon is involved. After scarfing it down, and enjoying the coffee our food arrived, the omlette was delicious, moist, not overcooked and well seasoned. My frittata was amazing, the spanish chorizo was nicely salty, the hollandaise was nicely made, and the cheese was melted which to me as a big deal.

Nestled on S. Presa and Eager street, this place is super quaint, nicely decorated and crisp clean. If you're looking for scrumptious food, designed perfectly and a mouth full of flavor this is the place for you. The service was spectacular, we were seated immediately and served water and mimosas (free of charge for their three year anniversary). We absolutely loved our plates and had some left to take home. We were walked through their specials in detail and decided to go with the Spanish Frittata and the Bite Burger, great choices. When in San Antonio I will be returning! Best experience I could've asked for, thank you Bite!"], ["Brianna P.", "Seriously cannot say enough good things about this place! Right when you walk in the place is adorable! Themed from the seventies with a few up grades and some sex appeal, the over all atmosphere comes off very modern! The bartender and the server that helped us were so knowledgeable and friendly! They recommended the duck, and let me tell you it was amazing! Melt in your mouth kind of amazing! Angels came down from heaven to sing to my taste buds kind of amazing. AMAZING!

It's very neat and hipster inside, which is cool, but it also smells musty... The cocktails were amazing - everyone I went with agreed on that. The mains were quite large portions, which was good. But there wasn't anything spectacular about the flavours, which is what I'd been hoping for. Presentation of dishes was interesting....

The decor was so fun and fresh and the owner stopped by our table to greet us, who by the way is gorgeous! The manager, who's name I can't remember :( , was nothing but kind, courteous, and just plain adorable! Right down to his matching apron and crocs he was detail oriented and aimed not only to please but to exceed any expectations we may have had. The Bloody Mary was absolutely divine! I mean it had a pizza roll and a cheeto on it, among many other treasures, what more could you ask for?! There was a slight mixup when ordering the food but we were taken care of with no further questions.

Portions here are small, but what the plates lacked in size they made up for with respectable flavor. We ordered the duck and salmon entrees with spinach risotto, the goat cheese ravioli as an appetizer, and I tried a clementine wheat brew. The entrees themselves were tasty, my one criticism of the risotto being its texture: globby versus pasty (the wife does not agree). The goat cheese ravioli seemed a waste of money, and my beer was warm but nonetheless a regional goody that I never tried while living near Boston. We left hungry (I repeat) and dropped about $60 but you know what? We will go back. This seems like a place worth revisiting. The pyromaniac inside of me wants to pay $8 for that flambe dessert, just to see the banana go aflame."], ["Lenny T.", "My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Bite while visiting SA for our anniversary. Wow! \u00a0What an experience!I called ahead to reserve a table, which they had ready and waiting. The place has some great decor, big fans of the boldly colored TP. \u00a0We started with cocktails which were handcrafted within eyesight. \u00a0Really good booze content unlike the tourist traps at the river walk. \u00a0The only slight issue was a bit of plastic from a broken ingredients container ended up in my wife's glass. No big deal, we let them know and they comped her beverage. \u00a0We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and later split an entree. \u00a0We had the escargot, the lobster spring roll, and the mussels. \u00a0Oh my God!The spring roll, while small in portion size, had so much flavor. \u00a0The lobster was cooked perfectly, it was not rubbery. \u00a0The \"earth clams\" were equally perfectly prepared. \u00a0Nice and garlicky. \u00a0The star of our night was definitely the mussels. They must be using steroids because the were huge! \u00a0Nice and plump and cooked in that addictively rich broth. I am not embarrassed to admit we asked for an extra serving of bread so we could mop up as much of it as we could. They should bottle that stuff!After a second round of drinks, which included a specialty made with fresh juice and pop rocks, we split the ropa. \u00a0The bag came pinched close with a tiny clothes hanger and we proceeded to rip it open and devour it's delicious contents. \u00a0White beans, sausage, fish, plump shrimp and even more mussels. \u00a0Delicious!Sadly we had no room for desert. \u00a0Service was excellent without being overly intrusive. This place is a great find and a hidden gem. \u00a0We will be back."], ["Andrea G.", "Highly recommend.

Food was overall very good but highlights were clam chowder that was off the normal beaten path 'trying to be Durgin Park' sort of potato chunk creamy thing and actually tasted like clam and good soup. I wasn't the one at my table who ordered it and that was a regret. Paella was a generous delight, and creme brulee was surprisingly good, from someone who tends to think this dessert menu staple doesn't offer many ways to stand out. It stood out.Price was very reasonable. It was the r.w. deal but the rest of the menu was priced similarly."], ["Ryu C.", "I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time. \u00a0The waiter was not rude, but not very pleasant. \u00a0He said for me to seat myself. \u00a0OK. \u00a0Not a big deal. \u00a0I smiled but kept a Mental note. As I walked in there were exactly 8 people in there. \u00a0Two couples and a party of four. \u00a0As we sat ourselves, \u00a0we did not get a menu or water for \u00a0about 5 minutes. \u00a0He chatted with the party of four and another couple. \u00a0The busser gave our waters and I proceeded to get the menu myself.Again our waiter was laughing and talking to the other tables. \u00a0We ordered the lobster roll, churrasco, and salmon. \u00a0Our waiter never came back, only after our food was delivered by the busser. \u00a0The lobster roll came first as an appetizer. \u00a0About 10 to 15 minutes. \u00a0The churrasco and salmon hit the 45 minute mark. \u00a0Did everyone order at the same time? Not likely.I so wanted to give place a good review."], ["John C.", "Stopped by when I was searching for some food next to J&O's Cantina right next door. \u00a0It's a trendy place with friendly service and a inviting menu and drink selection. \u00a0I had the salmon and risotto w/spinach and really enjoyed the meal along with a nice glass of wine. \u00a0Definitely a place I'd come back to and a nice place to bring a date, it's one nice to see local chefs opening new places that offer up new menu choices in a town heavy w/ chain restaurants."], ["Vanessa P.", "This place is now my favorite spot.

The ambiance in the bathroom alone was amazing. \u00a0They had black toilet paper that I now would love to import from England like they do, and Adel on a little 19 inch tv singing a cure cover....mind blown! Okay, okay so on to the actual bar. The drinks are super \u00a0freaking cute and elaborate in looks and the best thing in the world when it hits your lips.

Conceptually, all dishes made sense, but executed poorly. Lobster roll was okay, but void of any flavor. No comment on the lamb cigar. We also ordered Penne Pasta with mushrooms and sausage. So many things to say here: the dish was accompanied with hangar steak and potatoes. Yes, inside the dish with the pasta. The sausage consisted of chopped up sausage links, and tasted as if it had been frozen. Split pea soup was the highlight of the night. As far as the experience, the staff were not attentive, and we struggled to enjoy our night. Too bad, we wanted to enjoy."], ["Ash M.", "I've always thought Bloody Mary's were totes gross. \u00a0A mix of campbells tomato soup and vodka? \u00a0Nasty. \u00a0BITE has converted me. \u00a0Their bloody mary bar during Sunday brunch is incredible! \u00a0First, you pick your poison (Stoli for me) and then you're lead to the bar to make magic happen. \u00a0Spicy tomato juice, regular V8, Tabasco, cajun seasoning, pickles, sausages, pretzels, the list of trimmings goes on and on. \u00a0After spending a good 10 minutes building my drink (and maybe snacking..) I spent the rest of brunch sipping on my tasty concoction.In fact, I paid so much attention to my drink, I don't really remember what I ordered to eat... \u00a0Eggs benedict maybe? \u00a0I think there was a tart involved somewhere? \u00a0All perfectly good, I assure you but not \"blow my mind\" amazing. \u00a0I much preferred my dinner experience at BITE. \u00a0The food was more memorable (order the mussels!) and the atmosphere was tres romantique. \u00a0Ladies, be sure to stop by the bathroom here on your visit. \u00a0Adele FTW!"], ["Liz B.", "I'm so glad I visited Bite for dinner during a recent trip to San Antonio. The space offers a small, intimate environment. The staff treated us like royalty. The roasted duck with Parmesan risotto was to die for. The duck was roasted to perfection, accompanied with a dark mushroom sauce. The risotto was perfectly cooked. Karl expertly paired a glass of Spanish red wine with the dish. Definitely a memorable meal."], ["Lindsay R.", "BITE is full of little touches I didn't know were missing from my life until I came here. How can I ever go back to white toilet paper now that I know blue and red are possibilities? I came home so full of disdain for my uninspiring bathroom. I also came home full of boozy brunch goodness. The decor in here is gorgeous, bright, and playful. It's modern, but doesn't take itself too seriously. It's small and intimate. I got there right as they opened on a Sunday for brunch and scored a table easily, but it's in your best interest to reservation up here, as they get packed shortly thereafter. It's worth it. It's French cuisine, well executed and whimsical. Think escargot and mussels. I went with the Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar because if you give me a customizable option, I'm going to take it. The strapping fellas at the bar gave me a choice of vodkas, recommending the Reyka. I may like to customize, but I don't usually question the experts. They poured me my vodka, and I went to town adding a classic mix of spicy Bloody Mary mix, celery salt, worcestershire sauce, green olives, and a big fat fresh mushroom. Around a nice green stalk of celery, of course. I went tame, but they have all kinds of options like meats and cheese, peppers, other veggies, pretzels, and for the truly daring, some puffed cheese balls (like cheetos) I'm still kicking myself for not adding. I thought I'd go back for another one! Instead, I ended up with the truly intriguing and dessert-worthy chocolate covered banana martini. But I'll be back for you cheese balls! Food wise, we got a refreshing and light amuse bouche of melon and prosciutto to start our meal while we looked over the menu. It was the perfect juicy, salty start when it was already hot as blazes outside. A good San Antonio restaurant knows how to cool you down when the temperatures are raging outside. They had a special of crab topped eggs benedict that I went for with gusto. I feel obligated to try the eggs benedict at any new brunch stop before I branch out. It comes with veggies like carrots, potatoes, and green beans that are toasty, roasty, and tasty. Unfortunately, they forgot the crab on my bennies, but it was quickly rectified when I brought it to their attention. The spanish fritatta also comes smothered in hollandaise, so if you're not feeling the english muffin action, go for that. We stayed and chatted for a couple of hours, and the service was impeccable. The servers were really charming and attentive. I can't wait to come back here and bring friends. The dinner menu looks incredible, so I'll be back for that as well. I feel like I've earned a butter poached lobster tail, right?"], ["Brian S.", "4 stars for the Bloody Mary. Negative stars for everything else. Went there for brunch and were able to completely finish a drink (which is no small feat given the small salad bar that comes with it) and close our check (with a different waiter) before ours even came by to take our order. I worked in the service industry for 12 years and there is no way I'd ever be as oblivious as their waiter. Dude took 10 minutes to close out checks of a table that already left instead of getting our orders then looked shocked when we got up and left, and he still hasn't come by."], ["Amber M.", "Love this place. The food was delicious. I was here for restaurant week for dinner on Friday night.Their menu was really good.The Clam Chowder was really good, just right not creamy or heavy and was so tasty, the Seafood Paella was awesome but what really made my day was their Cr\u00e8me brulee, it was the BEST!I will definitely be back for more."], ["Angie H.", "Maybe it \u00a0was because we went on a Tuesday night, maybe it was because we were really hungry, or maybe because this place is just awesome . . .

Carl/Karl from Colorado was our server and was supported by Gina(?). They were super friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beverage selections. We opened our meal with a Carl/Karl recommended wine and a handmade in the realest way cocktail. Both were amazing. \u00a0The steak tartare was tender, melt in your mouth . . . the lamb \"cigar\" was crisp, perfectly seasoned, and not a hint of \"mutton-iness\" to it. (The sauces that accompanied were delicious, too.)The beef tenderloin I had was amazing: again perfectly seasoned, cooked just the way I asked (medium rare to medium), and oh-so-tender. The wine Carl/Karl suggested was perfectly paired. \u00a0I would tell you more about what my husband had, but he didn't share but ONE forkful with me. \u00a0=( \u00a0But his duck was sooooo good. Flavorful and balanced: the herbs didn't overcome the flavor of the duck but was enough to gently cut through the duck's natural \"fattiness.\"I'm not going to lie: when I saw the portions, I was like \"mannnnnn, I'm gonna have to eat like another half of the menu...\" but the portions ended up being just right (and I have a HUGE appetite) and well timed to maximize enjoyment."], ["Meg H.", "Severely disappointed by this place. We made a reservation and were seated immediately, but were forgotten about after that. We waited nearly 10 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and he didn't bring water. He said they 'were busy' and were working on it. Not sure if they pump the water from a well in the back, but that's basic costumer service. We had to ask to order drinks, which then took another 10 minutes to arrive. My friend ordered a coffee and it didn't come out for 45 minutes! When we inquired, the waiter repeated how busy they were.The Bloody Mary was fancifully dressed but lacked the bite of hot sauce or horseradish. I also question if the bartender remembered the vodka.When our food finally arrived, it was nothing to write home about. The stuffed French toast was a little dry and the frittata was underwhelming in flavor, size and aesthetic.The best thing about this place was the decor and the restroom. It has a hip, artsy vibe and the bathrooms have colored toilet paper and Adele live performances playing.I highly doubt I'll return here."], ["Vivian L.", "My sister took me to this little hole in the wall during restaurant week and it was absolute heaven! Once you walk in you're just wowed by the detailed decor, especially the large soup cans hanging overhead making you feel like you just walked into Andy Warhol's mind. The place is small, but perfect nonetheless. My sister and I ordered a variety of things, including the escargot which was pretty amazing, along with the lobster spring roll, the lamb chops, octopus, and I'm pretty sure there were more dishes but thats all I remember. The desserts were excellent, especially the churros! Was not disappointed at all :)"], ["Jessica S.", "We were pretty underwhelmed at our Sunday brunch.First, the decor - we see what they're trying to do, but it feels a bit amateur and poorly executed.Service was fine enough.The food was okay, but overpriced. The lamb cigar was good, but small and not a meal. It had no sides, just the \"cigar\" (ground lamb wrapped in phyllo, deep fried) with dipping sauces.The eggs benedict were average, on par with a decent hotel breakfast.The \"Belgian\" waffle was a disappointment. It wasn't Belgian, first off, being thin and flat. Second, it had a rubbery, chewy texture, which isn't how a good waffle should be. It was also bland.The two of us shared three dishes and we left hungry, and paid too much. We wouldn't go back for brunch."], ["Frannie M.", "Trendy atmosphere and from what we tried off the menu we loved! And the manager is quite friendly! :)"], ["Luke D.", "After reading all these reviews, even the bad, I had to come see for myself what this place was all about. Walking in to the booming, busy, cool restaurant, I was greeted nicely by the very professional bartender. I was lucky to get a seat and knew I should have probably made a reservation, but it didn't matter. The food and service were impeccable. I would have asked for better service, but i was being picky. This place is amazing and always booming, so I couldn't expect more than the great service I was already receiving. I hate to be crude, but it is worth adding... After my appetizer(the amazing puerto banus crostini plate), I had to take a break to the men's room. I was in shock from how amazing a restroom experience could be. Runway models walking on a tv, the coolest colored toilet paper I've ever seen, and a nice sink to wash my hands and mirror to make sure I didn't have food in my teeth. As I made it back to my table, my food was awaiting me. Butter poached lobster cooked to PERFECTION! I ate it way too quickly, but I was so satisfied. The great waiter that served me, Julien, gave a mix of charming humor and professionalism giving me the information I needed and trusting homey feel I needed to trust his judgement. It's a good thing I did, because he insisted I finish my meal off with the churros with vanilla bean Ice cream. After polishing off that plate, I couldn't move for a few moments. That's when the chef walked out, Lisa. As beautiful as could be, she greeted me with a smile and I thanked her for everything. In short, from the food, to the service, to the hospitality, to the bathrooms, I felt like I was in a home I never thought I wanted. I love this place and I can promise all of you here that I will be back. Plan on seeing me there.P.S. Tell Karl I say hi."], ["Vanessa M.", "My husband surprised on Valentine's Day with a dinner here - first time for both of us, but we had heard great things and couldn't wait to try them ourselves. Though every other place was packed, Bite was smart and took reservations only for Valentine's Day, which made it exceptionally easy to get in and seated quickly. Our table had cool, modern photos facing up that we had to turn over to get the menu. I would have liked the pictures more if one of them wasn't a girl with the nicest bottom ever on full display. I guess my husband needed his own Valentine's Day gift, eh, Bite? I digress. From here on out, it was pure bliss at Bite. Our waiter provided our drinks in a flash - I had a Bite-tini and the esposo had a beer. The menu for the evening was a choice of three prix-fixe menus - everything on it was amazing. From the salmon crostini to the lobster bisque to the steak to the bananas flambee to the raspberry lemon cheesecake we shared, nothing was awful. Great ambience - not too pretentious and not too shabby. Great staff. Great food. The prices weren't outrageous, either. We had a blast and enjoy this spot as often as we can now.

They have a build your own Bloody Mary bar. Now pay close attention boys and girls, you choose your vodka (Grey Goose for me please!) and then add a whole assortment of different options to make your Bloody Mary exactly to your liking. If you don't want to the bartender will make it for you, and boy does he do a great job. My blood mary had spicy tomato sauce, chalua, cherry tomato, bbq potato chip, banana pepper, jalapeno slice, celery, pretzel stick and lil smokie sausage. Yeah, you're reading that correctly. Needless to say the drink was amazing and I had two.We ordered the lamb cigar which is a mixture of lamb wrapped in an almost philo like dough and fried. Served with a chimichuri and aoli it was very good. My eggs benedict came with potatoes and veggies and all was great.

I ordered a special they had for the evening - chicken piccata, and it was incredibly disappointing. \u00a0I saw it sitting in the window (that lacks a heat lamp to keep food warm) for a bit while my husband's dish was being prepared, so it arrived cold. \u00a0Not only that, but it was just a grilled chicken breast sliced up and sat atop some sauce. \u00a0The chicken was dry and had no flavor nor was there enough sauce on the plate to fix it. \u00a0The pappardelle it was served with was also cold, overcooked, and under sauced. \u00a0I'm sure you're asking why I didn't send it back. \u00a0We already waited 45 minutes for the entree in the first place, I wasn't willing to wait again when the technique was flawed - a warm dish would not fix dry and flavorless chicken nor overcooked pasta.... \u00a0Maybe we'll try the acclaimed brunch, but I'm not too keen on returning at this point."], ["N D.", "Interesting blend of interior art and fixtures, but sorely lacking in the good food department.

That's when we met their manager/bartender who made us some great mary's but assured us we were missing out by not coming on Sunday's when they brought out all the stops in their make your own bloody mary bar. Wait...whaaaaat? My S/O and I looked wide-eyed at each other. We'd run across this once before in Austin at the now destroyed, yet to be all new Highball and thought it was a brilliant idea and wondered why no one in San Antonio had done this yet. Well, here we are and here it is!! Wednesday, I tried their steak tartare because since Luke, there hasn't been a place yet to rival the steak tartare from there or Comme Ca in Vegas and no I am not a fan of Liberty Bar's. \u00a0Well...once again...broke through to the other side! All I can say is wow! Flavor, oh sweet, scrumptious flavor! You just have to try it. Sunday comes around and we headed back to BITE to try this make your own bloody mary bar and sure enough, the manager remembered us and greeted us with a warm \"hello/welcome back\" when we walked in. After picking our poison (Grey Goose) the BM bar contained all the usual chomps you've come to expect but then, there they were...the other bites of awesome you could add such as little smokies, cherry peppers, chipotle soaked pickles, even long pretzel sticks, popcorn, Funyuns, and corn nuts! How fun!! We decided to share the lamb cigar but then as we looked on the board the crab benedict sounded way yummy and I figured this was as good a time as any to try any sort of eggs benedict (1st timer) so we got that as well. Once again...amazing flavor, amazing food and most importantly amazing and very friendly service, which is sometimes rare to find for a high-end restaurant. Best thing: Unpretentious and cozy, amazing service, amazing food and awesome bloody mary's. Side note: The ladies bathroom is also awesome with crazy colored toilet paper! Hey...it's the little things! hahaWorst thing: Not much other than it being a small space and the regular menu that contains the steak tartare is NOT, I repeat NOT available during brunch. They have a special brunch menu to chose from with lots of great eats."], ["Jasmin D.", "Small plates, big taste. Try the steak tartare, lobster spring roll, and the goat cheese and olives. Big tip - if you have your heart set on coming here during the weekend, make reservations! The place is way smaller than it appears. Try to get here by 7 and enjoy their cocktail happy hour ;) we will definitely be back. Also, I would recommend 1.5 plates a person. So for 2 people order 3 items."], ["Emily R.", "Had dinner on a Wednesday night so it was not packed. Nice lil place with great decor n ambiance. Our service was great, food was delicious, and even had the chef/ owner chat with us for a bit. Started w tasty drinks, a perro saldo for my husband \u00a0n pisco puch for me. Yum! For apps we tried the lobster eggroll n got cheese filled ravioli, both were delicious! Husband had the duck olivo n risotto, delicious. I could've had that risotto for dessert it was so good. I had a special, the seafood cazuela. Omg, tasty goodness that was fuul of flavor n just melted in my mouth. We were too stuffed for dessert but had some pistachio gelato that was super delicious. Will definitely be back!"], ["Dan L.", "Tried Bite for Restaurant week. Great experience. I had the mushroom basket, the seafood in a bag (can't remember cool french name) and a citrus tart. So good. Staff was attentive but not smarmy. Great place and I can't wait to go back."], ["Mel Z.", "Nice decor. Some dishes are good such as the lamb cigar. Most are pretty average in my opinion. We had the eggplant waffle which was very heavily seasoned and we couldn't finish. Escargot was so so. The entres were disappointing. My fish was dry and overcooked, the lamb chops also on the dry side and a very small portion for the price."], ["Paul V.", "I go here at least once a week that's how much I love this place! The bartender, Carl, is great at making a concoction to your liking. I always order one of the specials for my entree and that has always worked out each time. The ambience is eclectic and intimate. A must stop-by place when one is in Southtown!"], ["William P.", "My wife and I and another couple went for brunch; there were only four people in the restaurant when we arrived. One of us ordered eggplant soup, which came fairly quickly. It was more like gravy than soup and decidedly not hot. A bad start. Then we drank and waited at least half an hour for the rest of the service. I had a mushroom omelet that was horribly overcooked, with mushrooms that were tough and occasionally sandy. My wife had a chicken in a crepe, or something like that. Three times more chicken than needed; sometimes less is really more. One of our companions and the \"lamb cigar\" which was just as gimmicky as you would think, but at least he ate all of it.So none of the food was worth a hoot. It cost a lot of money. It was terribly slow even though the place certainly wasn't packed. Obviously the bulk of the other reviewers went to a different restaurant."], ["Nency S.", "Went on a Sunday for brunch, took my pet for a walk. Love the fact that I can take her on the outside part of the place and no one minds her being loud. Had a waffle, not so bad. Not a sweets person but the waffle was just right. Had a bloody mary, I must say the way it was presented was amazing!!! The drink was just right, not so spicy or strong. I have yet to find the best bloody mary but this came close. Looking forward to try their lunch menu soon."], ["Maegan B.", "brunch! \u00a0The menu is always changing but I loved the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus a few weeks back. Also enjoyed the mimosas and Bloody Mary bar, which was great, but the bartender made it even better than I did! Definitely will return."], ["Marisa P.", "Wanting to have a quiet dinner it was the perfect opportunity to try Bite. \u00a0Located on the edge of King William, Bite is in a very small space. \u00a0They have maximized the space by including a large wrap around bar. \u00a0The concept is to offer entree style plates, but in smaller portions. \u00a0This makes it much easier to try all different items, instead of committing to one plate for the meal. For two people plan on ordering 3 to 4 items to share. \u00a0This is the first place outside of Europe that I have enjoyed escargot served in hot bubbling butter. \u00a0The lamb did not have any type of aftertaste and was seasoned nicely. \u00a0A flattened duck wrapped in bacon disappeared off the table in a matter of seconds. \u00a0The drink menu offers a full bar and a small wine by the glass selection. \u00a0The bottles of wine were very reasonable. \u00a0The only fail in my eyes would be the dessert. \u00a0It was advertised as a \"chocolate blob.\" \u00a0Now, when I hear that I think of chocolate mousse, cream, maybe some cake pieces thrown in or ice cream. \u00a0Not so, it was basically just a brownie with homemade whip cream on it. \u00a0Disappointing. \u00a0The small tables and cushy chairs add to the Euro flair, and the waitstaff are super friendly and will explain anything on the menu. \u00a0Ah, the menu--just a laminated piece of paper---for such a cool environment maybe the menu could be on a small chalkboard or something quirky. \u00a0I look forward to dining at Bite again, this place has some really solid food choices and is overall just a fun place to hang out."], ["Sarah F.", "The waiter was friendly and engaging. \u00a0We had an overpriced bowl of gazpacho that was tasty but small , and had a huge blob of whipped cream in it that was bigger than the amount of soup. \u00a0No crackers or bread. Iced tea was $4 for a small glass. I was still hungry but didn't want to spend more money."], ["Tina K.", "Best food in San Antonio!!!!! Great ambiance. Great selection! Awesome bartender/waiter. Can't wait to go for brunch! Try the duck or the beef churrasco. (That's what I've had and they were AMAZING)Also, awesome dessert. ChocolateBlob cake is hard to pass up! So... So... So hard."], ["Zain R.", "Upon arrival we had to wait to be seated. Nobody approached us as we waited at the entrance. We came here for Sunday brunch and so during the Texas heat it's kind if hard to see what's inside. After my eyes finally acclimated to the inside I was able to enjoy the subpar modern feel with bright orange and metallic grey inside with ikea furniture. I had the chicken porcini crepe which was the redeeming quality of the brunch. The Bloody Mary looked like it was made for Barnum & Bailey's. It came with an assortment of things ranging from cheese and sausage to a cheese puff and a funyon. Redemption: it somehow worked and tasted amazing. The coffee was probably the best I have ever had on all my trips to San Antonio. Unfortunately, the service was not. Maybe it would have been better if we would have been greeted and gotten a table but we were bound to the confines of the bar and to the devices of the bartender. In his defense, he was overworked and had to bus tables but I just think that no one should ever have to ask for water when dining in, it should be something that should be served - no questions asked. All in all the food was good. The pricing and the ambience was probably appropriate for the 'real housewives of San Antonio.' My friend used the ladies restroom and she said the toilet paper smelled like cheap potpourri. For her sake, we hope she doesn't get a yeast infection. This place could be described as affectatious, unoriginal, and basic at best."], ["Mark H.", "A new restaurant in South Town? \u00a0Let's give it a shot. \u00a0Bite purports to offer an experience where patrons get to enjoy a variety of dishes without having to endure the 'tapas' or 'small plate' style of dining. \u00a0They also strive for high food quality with a menu that doesn't necessarily intimidate guests. \u00a0When we visited a few weeks after Bite officially opened its doors, my wife and I enjoyed our experience. \u00a0The interior setting was cozy. \u00a0The table tops wrap around the space along the windows with the bar top separating the main dining areas from the kitchen. \u00a0There are a few tables outside. \u00a0Management is still working on what their finished feel will be but this is probably due to being new.We enjoyed the menu design such that there are a number of standards and an equal number of daily/weekend specials. \u00a0From the regular menu, we were told to try the lobster spring roll. \u00a0It consisted of four pieces of roll which was prepared with a crispy fried wrapper you'd come to expect and the interior wrapped in bacon. \u00a0But the lobster was cooked just right and had good flavor even though it was somewhat unusual.Our entrees consisted of the steak tartare (standard menu) and the paella (special). \u00a0Again, the tartare didn't compare to that of our baseline, Gilt Bar in Chicago, but it was still damn good. \u00a0The paella was not traditional, having white fish, salmon, mussels, shrimp, and chorizo all in a 'longer-than-traditional-paella'-grain rice. \u00a0It was imparted with more of a seafood flavor and we didn't detect much saffron but it stood up. \u00a0That said we would order it again if it was still on the menu. \u00a0Variety is the spice of life anyway, right?The wine list was short but sufficient and the bartender (Connor?) delivered a few solid cocktails. \u00a0Lisa was attentive and very nice. \u00a0It's so great to have someone like her open a restaurant in South Town and we can't wait to visit again! \u00a0If you are looking for the perfectly polished place for a special night out, you may give Bite a few more weeks to get its feet under it. \u00a0If you want to really enjoy a great scene, attentive service, and some fun food, make your reservations now! \u00a0We will see you there!"], ["Danielle P.", "Upon my first time dining here, I ordered a Bloody Mary (though you can build your own at the bar) and a burger from the specials listed on the chalkboard. My server was the bartender though I wasn't seated at the bar. Her service was mediocre at best. The true personal service I received was from the owner. He was attentive, knowledgeable, provided recommendations of the menu, politely engaged in conversation and was kind enough to bring me a bite size sample of an appetizer. If it wasn't for his recommendation of the burger, I would have never known there was specials listed on the chalkboard located near the bar since it's not advertised anywhere on the menu and my server failed to mention nor ask if it was my first time visiting. Regardless, I can truly say this burger is unparalleled. The Bloody Mary was equally as impressive. Only fault is the service of my original server/bartender."], ["Gloria C.", "If acoustic Adele in a swanky bathroom (with multi-colored paper towels) doesn't get you excited, you can't sit with us. Bathroom jokes aside, I was overall impressed with my experience at Bite. \u00a0I ventured over during Restaurant Week (the best opportunity to try a little bit of everything), and was glad I made a reservation. This spot is teeny tiny, so I'd bet that reservations are probably a good idea on any night, unless there's just one or two folks in your group, then a spot at the bar will suit you just fine. It's pretty close quarters, so if you and yours tend to be a lively bunch, you might have to tone it down. They have legit cocktails! A short list, but the three out of four that we sipped were spot-on and refreshing. Think St. Germaine, Lillet, Chartreuse - things like that. Same situation with the wine list, it's not expansive, but offers plenty of variety without being overwhelming. With multiple $30 bottle offerings, it's a steal. We had a nice Tempranillo. Eating is an adventure here, and not for the close-minded. Mussels and escargot are not things I typically crave, but I was feeling frisky, and was sold after one bite of these buttery, savory dishes. I kind of forgot everything else we ate. Except the lobster spring roll, which should be a precursor to any meal. The entrees listed online for RW ended up not being the same once we got there, but no biggie, the offerings were plentiful. Lastly, the churros were cinnamon clouds of deliciousness. It's a spendy place, but worth it for memorable get-togethers or romantic evenings!"], ["Ashley C.", "I hate to say it but we were so disappointed in this place. Just had brunch there, our first (and likely only) visit. The place is tiny and fun and hip and the staff is great. The mimosas and Bloody Marys are works of art to look at and they taste great. But the food was not impressive. Hubby had the Croque Madame and it was dry and not much above something I could make at home. The salad that came with it was yummy but salty. I don't need my salads to be salty. I ordered the Belgian waffle and was so disappointed when it came covered in chocolate sauce, berries and whipped cream. Perhaps they should put a description on the menu, unless that's the way most people expect them to be. For me, that's dessert, not breakfast. And either way, it wasn't that good. It sucks to pay $45 + tip for a meal you didn't enjoy. :("], ["Chavah A.", "I have heard of the new eateries in Southtown but didn't think they were worth rushing down to check 'em out. Boy, was I wrong! Bite is small but totally worth making the trip out.

Food was fantastic and staff was quick and seemed to be knowledgeable. That's the best combination. Wish I would have come sooner!"], ["Jeanie E.", "This is my first review I've ever written on Yelp, but I've never felt so compelled. Some of the reviews on here are ridiculous--people complaining that the plates aren't big enough. With all that chatter, I expected to go in and get a slice of tomato and a slice of mozzarella... Are they giant Mexican food platter? No, but they are perfect portions. Let it be known that I am a French Culinary Institute trained chef. The food was PHENOMENAL. Everything was cooked perfectly and beautifully plated. The only \"meh\" aspect were the desserts we tried. They weren't bad, but definitely not the same \"wow\" factor as the rest of the food. The crab croquettes, lobster roll, escargot, and paella were fantastic, and I highly recommend them all. The restaurant is very small and quiet, but not in a pretentious way. I'd recommend making a reservation on a weekend, to be safe. The women's bathroom was really fun. Take a look ;-) I recommend this place with flying colors. I'll be going again."], ["Mike S.", "The Sunday Brunch is to die for! \u00a0Make your own Bloody Mary's and enjoy the best brunch"], ["Rita E.", "Eat out much of time ( often disappointed).

The atmosphere is wonderful, I spent most of my life in Europe and it reminded me of my gastronomical outings there. The staff was courteous, charismatic and knowledgable. I especially enjoyed the lobster tail, the duck and the anchovies. Prices are reasonable and the quality of the food is pretty high. Presentation was fantastic and timeliness was on par.

Awesome service. I wasn't aware of this part of south town which was quiet and peaceful during sunday brunch service. We happened upon this little gem accidentally and I am so glad! Mimosas and bloody Marys were perfect. Great waffle with seasonal fruit and bacon/shrimp plate. Absolute fave was the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It isn't often I get plate envy but I sure did over this one. Last, we had 3 desserts...bananas flambe, chocolate torte, and lemon basil gelato. Flambe was solid, torte was outstanding. Skip the gelato unless you are a big basil fan. A little goes a long way....overall great meal!

Then again, the food is so good, you'll stop noticing the noise."], ["Sofia K.", "First Visit...we loved the feel and the posted specials looked GREAT...and you could smell one of them, the roasted leg of lamb, as soon as you walked in the door. Sadly, it was a slow down hill ride from there. We had the special soup...oyster and asparagus , and the unusual and well-executed eggplant waffle; they were the highlights of the evening. The lobster roll tasted totally like a tough hot dog! OK we weren't too discouraged, we had two pretty darn good apps. Our entrees...the aforementioned lamb... we were assured the chef cooked it med. rare and I'm sure it was MR at some point in the evening, but certainly not once it was re-heated and plated and served to us, grey and tough. The soft shell crab tempura...one medium crab for $21, overcooked and barely discernible crab flavor. The pork confit...simple braised pork butt...hard to mess up. So of 6 dishes two were really good. There are about 10 tables including outdoor patio; there were two staff members acting as host, server, bartender, busser, food runner. Our water was rarely re-filled, one of our dishes fell through the cracks and was served 10 minutes after the others and drink rounds arrived late. We wanted to love this place, we were excited at the thought of another innovative spot in SA, but the execution just wasn't there. Oh, and they need a serious exhaust fan in the kitchen...that delicious lamb smell when we entered was a lot less enticing after permeating our hair and clothes."], ["Eva R.", "If it were a snake, it would've bit me. Bite is the closest restaurant to my house - 5 blocks - and insanely good and reasonably priced. Salmon and risotto, artichoke, lamb shank and potatoes au grautin, Belgian waffle, lamb cigar with chimichurri sauce, chocolate \"blob\" - it's all soooo delicious.

Daily specials and savory staples, only complaint was noisy bass from bar next door and that I didn't visit sooner."], ["Chad M.", "Recently went for the first time and have to say I wish I would have gone sooner. At the time there were doing a special on different gin cocktails. The cocktails were spot on and went down smooth with the food. We got a couple different plates to sample. We had the Puerto Banus Crostini which was a great way to start. We also had the goat cheese which was very tasty. Then we got into the really good stuff. The lamb cigar, which was on the daily board, and was definitely a highlight. We also had grilled steak skewers that were flavorful and tender. Finally we had the bananas flambees which was awesome.

Ppl were waiting at the door without a reservation. It felt stuffed with so many ppl in a confined space and I deff thought it needed some air freshener. Off to a great start! I ordered the lamb and my friend got a pasta. The lamb wasn't bad but I didn't think it was worth the price tag. I should have ordered a few appetizers instead. Heard the eggplant appetizer was great. Based on my one time visit, it was deff underwhelming and below my expectations. Maybe I'll give it another shot if I visit San Antonio again.

We were the first people to enter, first seated and first to order. After we got our appetizer we waited 20 minutes for the main course. The main course was a chicken breast or fish. Neither which are served on their regular menu, and you can tell why. The chicken was almost over cooked and the fish with not much flavor. When I think of a French restaurant I don't think either of these dishes. Certainly wasn't worth the fixed price of $35 per dish.

We recommend Subway over this place, customer service is better!!"], ["Rod K.", "I rarely give a one-star review, but one thing that really makes me upset is when a restarurant blatantly, knowingly and INTENTIONALLY lies to me. \u00a0But before I get to that part, I'll give the surrounding details.My wife and I are here on business in San Antonio. \u00a0We searched for some great restaurants, and we found The Fig Tree Restaurant has Baked Alaska flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0I won't go into the background, but my wife and I have some great memories of Baked Alaska flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0Right on their website it says that it is flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0Lots of photos on the internet of the flaming Baked Alaska at this restaurant. \u00a0So THAT is why we decided to go to this restaurant.We liked the look and feel of the restaurant and everyone is very friendly. \u00a0We had a couple appetizers (crab cake and roasted beets) that were excellent. \u00a0My wife ordered the Beef Wellington (always one of her favorites). \u00a0When discussing how she wanted her steak cooked, instead of saying medium or medium rare, she said, \"I want it very, very pink, but not red\". \u00a0We do this because different restaurants have different ideas of what medium or medium rare is. \u00a0Her steak came out nearly well done. \u00a0Only just the slightest trace of pink if you used your imagination. \u00a0They apologized and re-cooked another steak. \u00a0The next steak came out bloody. \u00a0But by then I'd already finished my entr\u00e9e, so she just cut around and ate just the very outside that wasn't bloody. \u00a0I had the duck special, and it was good - not at all great...but good.My wife had a bottle of sparkling water that was in an ice bucket behind her. \u00a0And we ordered a bottle of wine. \u00a0Not once did anyone refill my wife's water or our wine. \u00a0She poured her own water and we poured our own wine. \u00a0We really don't mind doing that, but I thought I should mention it.So now to the reason I gave a one-star review. \u00a0The Baked Alaska was dropped off at our table and the waiter started to walk away. \u00a0So I said, \"I thought this was presented flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0He then said that they were no longer allowed to do flamb\u00e9 in the restaurant. \u00a0My wife and I just looked at each other.The Baked Alaska was just OK. \u00a0When it's not flamb\u00e9ed, it just isn't the same. \u00a0I would think they could at least still flamb\u00e9 it in the kitchen. \u00a0We each took one bite and didn't care for more.When the waiter came back, I further questioned about not doing the flamb\u00e9. \u00a0He said that they haven't been allowed to flamb\u00e9 for at least a couple years. \u00a0So I showed him on my phone, on their own website, where it says it's flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0He said that A LOT of people complain about this, and he said that the owners are well aware of this problem, but they will not change what it says on their website. \u00a0So what he fully admitted is that the owners, who are fully aware of the misleading statement on their website, intentionally mislead potential customers. \u00a0Obviously, just to get them in the door.I didn't want to put the waiter on the spot, but I assume that they have been instructed not to tell the customers when they order the Baked Alaska.I didn't ask to speak to the manager, but she came over to apologize anyway. \u00a0And she too admitted that the owners are fully aware of this situation. \u00a0She said that she will again tell them, but that they've been told over and over already. \u00a0She made it very clear to me that the owners don't care that they are misleading people.So that's it. \u00a0That's why they deserve a one-star review. \u00a0Maybe it's just me. \u00a0But being lied to at a restaurant is my pet peeve."], ["Wendy D.", "The food was well prepared, the service was attentive. Overall, it was a very nice meal. I think sitting outside would have been nicer"], ["Jim M.", "Excellent steaks and nice ambience but very expensive.

Free live music from the nearby amphitheater."], ["Angel Of Agon Y.", "Set in an historic building, the Fig Tree is an attractive space with two dining rooms and a patio overlooking the famed Riverwalk. Service is excellent as is the French-inspired food. I recommend the escargots and the beef wellington, two traditional dishes prepared in untraditional ways. The trout almandine comes with an exquisite brown butter sauce but was also lightly breaded which I didn't especially care for. The rib eye steak was all it should be. Kudos to our waiter, Adam, whose service was efficient, courteous, and suave. Adam also showed his tact when my guests and I were saying grace as dinner was served. He was bringing two dishes to our table, saw what we were doing, paused, and waited politely until we were finished. Not every waiter would have had the perspicacity to do that."], ["Emily B.", "The outdoor seating was so pretty over Christmas week, the ambiance was perfect for our rare-date night. I ordered the steak with fragra on top and potatoes with asparagus. It was delicious. I did have to have the steak sent back to cook a minute or two longer but the waiter was totally fine with it. In fact, he asked me to cut into it before he left our table to make sure it was to my satisfaction which then made me comfortable sending it back, as I usually don't do that. My husband ordered the duck breast, which was cold. Had I known that at the time, I would have suggested he send it back as well, but I didn't until the evening was over. \u00a0Overall, we enjoyed the meal. There was a little bit of confusion from the staff as to who would seat us, which was odd. Our waiter was new, but did a great job."], ["Jeff S.", "My wife brought me here for a birthday weekend in San Antonio. We were seated right away and the view to the Riverwalk is very nice, there is indoor and outdoor seating. Not crowded at all so it was a nice quiet dinner for the two of us. I had the spinach salad and the duck and it was great. Our meals together came to about $100, so it's not on the cheap, but I don't think outrageous for the atmosphere they have and the location. The one negative was our waiter, he was obviously not very familiar with the menu and options, he seemed nervous too. We could tell a huge difference between him and the seasoned waitress handling the other tables."], ["Nathan L.", "It was ok. The beef Wellington was not close to Gordon Ramsay's recipe which I've made at home several times. Even though it was deconstructed, which is kind of cheating, it came out very medium vs medium rare. The mashed potatoes lacked flavor. $12 simple salad (literally just lettuce) to accompany the meal...I'd rather have dessert. The service and Malbec were great."], ["Tj R.", "Food was truly amazing. The portions are a little smaller than other place which makes them about the right size. Presentation is pretty stunning too; seemed almost custom for our visit. I was able to order some things that I don't normally get to order, though, it's very expensive. It wasn't terribly quick either. But, not as ridiculously slow as say, La Marginal. The server was very attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our meal. He seemed to have an almost personal interest in our well-being and I liked that. We ate outside so, it was as clean as it can be when in the elements. The tablecloth was still clean and white, of course, and all the place setting was g2g.It's pretty busy on the Riverwalk on the weekends and that can be simultaneously frustrating while working through a crowd and also makes for interesting people-watching. Being outside, it was nice to hear the sounds of the city and smell the scents of nearby BBQ. It was a little windy that day and that messed-up my hair. :/ There were a few other patrons there, generally older (presumably with more money). Everyone had a bit of space around them and it all seemed private and intimate.Overall, the food is great and the experience is distinct but it's very expensive. I feel that you can probably get nearly the same quality food from some of the higher-end trucks in Austin and for much less moola. I'd say it's worth a one-time go, maybe with your mom or fianc\u00e9; it's a special occasion kinda place. Now that I've gone, while I will recommend that place, I probably won't go back since I don't have any special occasions anymore. :)"], ["Julie S.", "I wish I could say I had an amazing dinner experience and \u00a0was expecting to have awesome service when I was here last for the Elite event. But I am a bit disappointed with my experience here outside of yelp to enjoy a nice dinner. Asked to sit outside, so the hostess guided us out, wait pause, the table is not set up! So, where do we wait till it is done? Idk just stand around in the aisle and steps watching everybody? LOL we walked down to the bottom of the river and waited for over 5 minutes, maybe that is enough time for the table to be set. Walked back up and it is not done yet, stood around near the table \u00a0for what seemed like another 5 minutes until the busboy finished setting up the table. They were probably waiting for the table cloth to finish drying in the dryer? Maybe there should be better communication with hostess and servers, or the hostess go over and check to see what tables are open to have it ready, that way we can just wait in the lobby, instead of standing around watching people eat and be in the way of everybody. Also we shouldn't be the ones to ask for a menu. Doopty doo... still waiting for the menu. So, I called on someone overseeing the restaurant for a menu. She brought it to us. Later on the server came over to ask what we wanted to drink, prickly pear margarita... he comes back later we had some reviews saying it tastes better on the rocks do you want to try that instead? Oh god just give me a drink, yeah sure let's do on the rocks. Finally, we got to order and server failed to tell us about any dinner specials until after we had finished with our meal, since I was curious to know if there was one. The food was good by the way I had the seared maple leaf Duck breast and brussel sprouts on the side The duck was tender and \u00a0flavorful. The friend ordered the scallops and I thought it was cooked perfectly."], ["John C.", "San Antonio is not a locale you would expect fine French dining, but here it is, white tablecloths and all.Fig Tree has a real French chef, who is young and talented. He leans towards Bechamel-type sauces. I had the apple and onion soup which was very interesting and creative. The trout was a tad overdone, but the sauce was nice and the vegetable medley beneath was successful. The wine list is quite good, although I did not see any Chablis or Reislings. Portions are good sized, which is half the battle for fine dining. Nothing is worse than those New York art houses that serve up scanty scraps that look like they escaped from a Kafka novel. None of that here--you will be taking food home with you. Service was very good.The location is in La Vallita, which sits on a small ridge above the riverwalk, close enough to be nearby, but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. Bon apetite."], ["M C.", "We came here for Post-Valentine's day celebration. The little lights, small cozy house converted into a restaurant, the warm customer service added into an elegant romantic evening to remember.

I had the lobster bisque, the duck breast , and the banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Even the bread they served was tasty. All adding to a divine evening. Thank you for a wonderful evening .

Not at all gracious. The restaurant was empty on this Tuesday (I think) evening. \u00a0I see that another diner ordered multiple appetizers and uploaded the photographs to Yelp, so I guess it's just luck of the draw as to whether this lady is acting as the bouncer.

Even without a reservation, we were seated immediately at a fantastic patio table overlooking the river and the ampitheatre where a flamenco show was performing.In addition to detailing the menu items, our waiter spent time explaining San Antonio history and landmarks to us inquisitive tourists. We never felt rushed even though it was a busy holiday weekend.The food was outstanding!! I had the special which was duck orange. I have eaten all over the world and this was quite possibly the best duck I have ever had! My wife and daughter had the chicken and were equally impressed.

The location is cozy within La Villita (although the outside of the restaurant does lack some illumination, and its not immediately obvious that it's a restaurant). The restaurant itself has a nice view of the riverwalk and we were seated by the window on the second floor. The waiter was quite attentive throughout the meal. I started off with the p\u00e2t\u00e9, which was quite nice. My partner had the bisque which tasted very nice as well, but was very poorly presented in a clear bowl. Our mains consisted of the beef stroganoff for her and the blackened drum for me. I actually enjoyed the drum, it was nicely seasoned and topped with some avocado (the rice was slightly too al dente and they could've benefited from using basmati rice instead). My partner found the beef to be mediocre. The deserts were ok, we sampled the poire au vin and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. If I could give half stars this experience would've been a 3.5 star one. I cant say I didn't enjoy the food, I just don't think I would pay full menu prices for it (since its not restaurant week every week). The atmosphere was a little awkward, at times it was loud then it suddenly got awful quiet. Overall it was a decent experience and I'm glad I got to try it, but I likely would not return right away."], ["Leigh P.", "This place was unbelievably good. I was so glad to have found it. The manager was really friendly and attentive and the server we had knew her menu well. We all had different items off the menu and not one person could complain. I had the beet and goat cheese salad to start. Their goat cheese is encrusted in pistachios and the flavor is amazing. For my entree I had the ribeye and brussels sprouts. Cooked to perfect, the ribeye could be cut with a butter knife. And the sprouts were seasoned so well, I had to have them removed so I would stop eating them.

Then I had their scallops, came with three scallops over a squid ink risotto in a creamy brandy like sauce, wow, so tasty! I finished off my meal with a banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, very tasty.

We sat outside on the patio at the same level as the restaurant, but there were several tiers of patios down to the Riverwalk. There were white Christmas lights strung through the trees.

It was close to impossible to find this place and La Villita isn't even a through street. I suppose this prologue adds to the tree's overall allure. Because, behind its modest store front lies a secret garden waiting to entranced weary travelers with wondrous flavors and lingering aromas. Some friends and I came here for restaurant week. On the menu was capreses salad (Burrata/baby tomatoes/arugula/ balsalmic reduction), braised veal short ribs (polenta/wild mushrooms/ braising jus), and chocolate macaron (w/ chocolate gelato). Having eaten here, one will begin to appreciate and justify the existence for fine dinning. This isn't a place that many can just afford to eat every month or even every year. But, it's existence allows for true culinary creativity and evolution to take place. And, it's also what makes eating exciting. The star of the meal was the veal short ribs. Never have I been so enamored with such a complete dish that every component's flavor and texture existed in perfect harmony. In each bite you will feel as though everything in life is exactly the way it should be. The attention to details really set the dinning experience above anything else. Appetizer and dessert tasters compliment of the chef and a personal greeting from him at the end of our meal were special touches that made this a lovely summer's night."], ["Al S.", "Mike my waiter was awesome! The food was good but overpriced. I ordered the scallops for $38 and it was served on a small rectangular appetizer plate with 3 scallops, 3 small pieces of trumpet mushrooms and squid ink risotto that was a bit pasty.

I'm bewildered that it took me this long to make it in. Setting the scene for a memorable evening, we took a picturesque walk through a twilit and eerily peaceful La Villita before arriving at the teeny tiny home that is the Fig Tree. Inside is pleasant, like a formal dining room in your fanciest friend's house. But the patio, oh the patio, is what river walk dining dreams are made of. Twinkle lights line the balcony railings and various tiers of patio seating unravel all the way to the banks of the river. People once lived here, and I'll be forever jealous that I wasn't one of them. We dined during Restaurant Week, but we still sampled a few items from the regular menu, so I'd call our experience \"well-rounded.\" Proceeded by an excellently crisp New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, there was a twist on a caprese salad - thick chunks of colorful tomatoes drizzled in balsamic and sprinkled with seasoned goat cheese, escargot that melts in your mouth (I didn't even want the toast that came with it), and the most memorable small plate, a crab cake that was 100% crab meat and so fresh. For the main course, the duck confit with Gouda \"Bread pudding\" stole the show, and I don't even like duck. I'll be honest, the bread pudding bit made me choose it, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the duck - crispy on the outside, but juicy, tender, and buttery on the inside. I will say, the wonderfully capery sauce that came with the swordfish deserves to be bottled and available for purchase. Adding to the charm of the quaint historical eatery, the manager, Steve, is a Southern gentlemen. He shares stories of fine-dining in New Orleans, and you can tell that's where he learned to perfect the combination of hospitality, five star service, and unpretentious charm. \u00a0With a team like him and Chef Laurent (and our perfect server, Edwin), I can't imagine a less than idyllic dining experience at Fig Tree."], ["Ingrid D.", "Really great restaurant! And luckily sound proof! Some rock band was playing as loud as they could in the outdoor theater next door but you could only hear it if someone opened the door. The food was lovely! Granted rather pricey for a beef Wellington at $46 but very tasty and cooked to perfection. We ordered the flamed Alaska and it was delicious! We were torn between the bananas foster as we had seen a few tables get that and it was quite a show to watch them make it. Our waiter seemed a bit nervous and we briefly thought we had been forgotten when he emerged with our appetizers. The French lady seemed to be the manager and she was really on point.

We opted for the full dinner from soups to dessert. Throughout the service was wonderful and the staff attentive. The food was amazing - perfectly prepared and fresh.The only problem came with the wine. We ordered a bottle of Alsatian Pinot Blanc listed as a 2007 vintage.

No congratulations, nothing. \u00a0She was angry that we did not order any alcohol and practically rolled her eyes anytime we asked for anything--a water refill in particular sent her over the edge. \u00a0As we were walking out I had to use the ladies room and my husband was waiting in the entrance of the restaurant for me to come down the stairs. \u00a0As he stood there he heard our server complaining to the manager about the tip she received from us. \u00a0We didn't feel she deserved a tip at all considering how unpleasant she was but we did leave her 15% as a minimum. I normally tip 20% but she just ruined our entire experience. \u00a0We've been back to San Antonio several times since then for long weekend getaways but we will probably never be back to the Fig Tree. \u00a0It's such a shame that they cant hire quality servers.

We had a reservation and were greeted warmly and seated. Service was very good. I had the crab cakes and the Beef Wellington. Their preparation of the Wellington is a bit different, with the filet served between two pastries, and not cooked in the pastry. This keeps the pastry from getting mushy. The steak was prepared perfectly and tasted excellent. The crab cakes were fantastic.My wife had the avocado stuffed with Shrimp Louis and the Tournedos Rossini. Both were excellent as well. Truth is, we got dessert, but were full and I do not remember what it was. What I will remember is an excellent meal that I hope to have again in a future visit to San Antonio."], ["Todd S.", "Here for business and was looking for a good place to eat on the river that was not trashy and cheesy.

I ordered the Tournedos Rossini and my honey ordered the roasted duck. Mine came with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. His came with Thai basil glass noodles and duck confeit. Every bite was the best food we have ever tasted....it was soooo good.

Started w crab cake- best I ever had- not mushed crab, but lumps caked together w a perfect thin crust- green sauce to compliment. I ordered the beef Wellington medium rare- I guess my palate is not refined enough because it literally tasted like a wet dog smells-maybe it was the bordelaise sauce I could not handle. My fianc\u00e9 decided to tell the waiter my descriptive taste of the Wellington and he was offended & not too nice, but either the owner or manager was informed and he was so gracious & offered me his Chilean sea bass which was just made for him!

The bass was \u00a0sitting in a little pool of yummy butter sauce, swimming in it were tiny potatoes- not so special, but the soaking artichokes were amazing \u00a0my honey ordered the rib eye- it was good as well, topped w maitre d butter.

Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, incredible service."], ["Grace W.", "This restaurant is aweful. Its food is creatively cooked. The taste is not bad. But it's definitely over priced. But the one star is for its service. It is a discrimination place. Its service cannot be called professional. I went there twice, and both experiences were the worst restaurant experience I ever had in San Antonio. The first time, I waited for 20 minutes after making my order (only appetizer and soup at the time) and had nothing. I softly asked the old lady who is supposed to be the manager if I can get my food. Her response was \"No, you have not been waiting for 20 minutes???!!!!\" Still, no food came... I have been many types of nice restaurants around the world, pricy or not pricy. This is my first time to get this kind of treatment...Then, for some unknown psychological reason, I dropped Fig Tree the second time two weeks later. I probably just wanted to check if my last experience was random. Unfortuantely, similar thing. I waited for 10 minutes, and nobody came to talk to me for order. It was not a busy day. Over half of the tables were empty. For these two times, I figured it's because I went there by myself and dressed like a normal work labor, instead of being a rich lady or someone with rich husband who wears rings, necklaces and fancy dresses. I observed the old lady (the manager)'s behavior and some waiters. They are definitely discriminating. I think the manager causes serious service problem for this restaurant. For the purpose of work, I have visited all the top-ranked restaurants in San Antonio downtown. All of them have great service. If I give them 100 score, Fig Tree could be 0-10.

Our waitress (Lisa) was skillful and accommodating throughout our two-hour dinner, and every course was pronounced delicious by all four of us.Our window table overlooked the Riverwalk, so my guests had a dual treat: splendid dining and a unique view.

There was an appreciable wait between the main course and dessert, but that was to allow one of our party who had arrived late time to get his meal. Amazingly, even though he was over an hour late (plane problems) they were able to get him an excellent meal with little fuss. The atmosphere is lovely. This is the sister restaurant to the Little Rhein Steakhouse. It was actually the residence of the lady who started the Little Rhein, and it still has the feel of a comfortable home.

But the true test came with the quality of the food and drinks.We were not disappointed in the slightest. From the drinks, appetizer, entrees, all the way to the dessert, were all delicious. Since Ocho is a Cuban restaurant we had to order mojito for drinks and sandwiches for our entrees. If you are thinking about ordering a sandwich, I would recommend the Hamburguesa. The El Cubano is good as well, but the Hamburguesa had so much more flavor. Get the papas bravas as a side instead of the fries or potato chips. You will not regret it!

The Fruit Mixta is sized for a meal with a nice assortment of fresh fruits. The Traditional Pork Pozole Rojo is very good. I like a good soup for lunch. The Shrimp and Crab Campachena is delicious and filling without being heavy. The Ocho Chopped Salad also makes a good filling light lunch (if you want you can add chicken or crab).

There was also I nice crisp/crunchy outer later. \u00a0The risotto also had a rich flavor and was not overcooked nor undercooked. \u00a0Also a plus - I do not like peas because of their texture. \u00a0There were a lot of peas in this dish and I hardly even noticed them.Banana Bread French Toast - I'm not a total sweets fan so this was a little too sweet for me. \u00a0All I needed was a bite or two and I was good. \u00a0The ice cream was homemade and perfectly soft. \u00a0The bread was moist and the sauce was good.Fresh Fried Churros - \u00a0man, is it sad to say I think I've only had churros at costco? \u00a0This was delicious. \u00a0I was kind of curious at what it would taste like as the outside was pretty dark brown. I tore a piece off and the inside was...I don't know how to explain it...It almost looked as if it would be undercooked but when you take a bite, it was a perfect texture. \u00a0I was going to shy away from the lemon curd sauce as the two don't quite sound like they go well together but man it was delicious. \u00a0It was perfect lemon tang and a perfect hint of curd."], ["Samantha M.", "This is my first review. I felt compelled to write it after we read such high reviews on Yelp only to be disappointed with the restaurant. The location is great. The restaurant is small and intimate, which I appreciated. However, our table experienced poor service and low quality food. The butternut squash soup was served cold and tasted like canned pumpkin from a Thanksgiving potluck. The rice and vegetables looked like a frozen TV dinner. And the salmon was dry and over powered by garlic. In my opinion the menu items have a very high price for low quality food. In the end we decided we had paid for the great location and the chance to catch up with friends, which we couldn't complain about."], ["Tony H.", "Last day in town and stopped by this place for breakfast.

Stopped with my sister who's visiting from Hawai'i. We shared botanas y bebidas. Their tostones were really maduros, but I'm not going to argue with them...either way, loaded with flavor!

Although I was not in the mood for Cuban food it was delicious and we will definitely add this to our list of restaurants. Being DT, you would expect to pay for parking even on a Friday night, prime time, 7:30pm. Nope! Luckily there were a few spots open and it was free! The parking lot is very compact and close together so don't bring your truck. We were expecting at least an hour wait as well, but nope! We were able to get a table immediately and the outside sitting was still available for those who came after. Beer doesn't get any cheaper than this DT. They had shiner specials for $2 and a glass of Chardonnay for $4 as their drink specials. I wasn't expecting those prices at all. Food: we spilt the chorizo queso (not your typical queso dip, more meaty!) and the shrimp and crab seafood mix (forgot the name). Both were delicious and quite filling. The seafood did have a bit of a kick to it, so our waitress recommend adding avocado to it, which I'm glad she mentioned. They came in pretty large portions. If you tend to eat more, I would say 3 appetizers would be perfect and some drinks.Next time we come back we'll definitely try the main dishes!"], ["Miriam B.", "It's more South Beach than San Antonio yet somehow it fits perfectly.

It was still about a 15-20 min walk from the Navarro St exit of the river walk. I would suggest driving here to avoid the sketchy walking route. There is a parking lot outside, but I think you have to pay for it. This restaurant is attached from the outside to Hotel Havana. The decor is calm with blue and white hues. Two large dated chandeliers hung above us, and added charm to the small space. Beautiful natural light poured in from the glass windows as well. The coffee here tasted better than Starbucks and was refillable. We ordered the avocado and bacon omelette with arugula side salad. The salad could've used more dressing on top. The omelette itself was flooded with bacon in every bite. The avocado in the middle of the omelette added a nice light creaminess to the dish. I didn't care for the queso blanco sauce, which I felt was quite bland in flavor. \u00a0My brother ordered the Cubano Con Huevo, and it was delicious. The fried egg was cooked beautifully, and was still runny on the inside. The pulled pork sandwich paired well with the pickles. The potatoes were cooked and seasoned well. The thing I didn't appreciate here was the 20% gratuity slapped involuntarily on us (we came in as a party of 5 for brunch). The service wasn't stupendous enough to warrant such a tip. We weren't exactly a huge party either. Also, the prices for brunch are a bit steep, especially for a restaurant away from the river walk. So, while I think the food and coffee were good, it was not worth it enough for me to come back again given the expense."], ["Andrew \u00df.", "Love Ocho. By far one of my first hidden gems I found living on the museum stretch of the Riverwalk.

The decor was perfect. Vintage chandeliers, a huge espresso machine, art decor couches and tables, and it was on the side of a hotel overlooking the river walk, which was beautiful at night. I got the Cuban torta for dinner and loved it!

Perhaps a white plate and garnish would have altered my perception of takeout orders the \"Havana Hippie\" and Cuban Sandwich, but food should stand on its own whether dining in or carrying out. The Havana Hippie is a small stale piece of hoagie bread (likely pulled from a discarded box of Subway sandwiches), housing a glob of avocado and a dollop of mysterious purple stuff that is supposed to pass for black bean hummus. The Cuban Sandwich is not Cuban and it's Not a Sandwich. This tasteless, warped, inverted pile of pork is what I imagine a sandwich looks like after traveling through transport pods in The Fly (Google \"Baboon Scene The Fly\"). Do it now.

They were sitting in the most delicious sauce and dusted with queso fresco. It doesn't deliver all my Caribbean or Cuban food needs, but it doesn't claim to. Ocho is an adorable, small place to grab delicious bites and great drinks. (Go on a Tuesday!) I'll definitely be back."], ["M B.", "I have been a HUGE fan of Ocho's throughout the years. A weekend night is incomplete without having a drink at Ocho. Their drinks are delicious; while more pricey than the average bar, you definitely get what you pay for. The evening bar menu is great. The pozole is filling and perfectly spiced. However, my last experience there left a sour taste in my mouth. My friend and I went there for brunch one weekend. We actually first heard about Ocho from a Texas Monthly writeup about their brunch. First the food, I ordered the omlette and was extremely underwhelmed. It was $14 and bland as a bowl of steamed white rice. For Cuban fusion I was expecting a little more. It fell short of our expectations and didn't compare to their evening menu. The service: it was decent, but a little inattentive. The waiter also shortchanged me. I paid in cash and he rounded up to keep the change because he didn't prepare his \"bank\" for the shift. It was a small amount but nonetheless perturbed me since it inflated his tip from 15% (which he deserved) to 20%. It's just the principle of it that put me off. It shouldn't be my fault he didn't being change. I've worked in the service industry before and so I feel justified in my complaint. That being said, I usually go all the time on the weekends and this is really the only bad experience there"], ["Brian M.", "My wife and I love Ocho when we're in San Antonio.Good food, great drinks, and even better staff.

The restaurant could be a set on a Wes Anderson film -- impeccably stylish and a bit arcane. The food was incredible. I was there early in the day and was impressed by the brunch menu's choices.I went with the Breakfast Americano; two eggs scrambled with chorizo -- a spicy Mexican sausage -- savory home fried potatoes, two tortillas, and a small bowl of fresh melon and pineapples. I enjoyed a really well-made cup of black coffee with the meal. The price is a little high but the ambiance, helpful staff, delicious meal and riverwalk view made this feel like a value. Check in on yelp for breakfast and get a 20% discount. I plan to return, soon -- Highly recommended."], ["Maria W.", "Checked out this place for my birthday with my husband around 7:30pm. My biased-- I'm 100% Cuban.. Born there & everything! Let's start with the good: - the service was incredible; our waiter was so attentive and super nice! - the decor is so fun and definitely that Cuban flavor! - there is parking for the hotel/restaurant which is nice to have!- it's on a quiet side of the river walk which I enjoyed- they have those bikes that are throughout the city at the hotel/restaurant if u wanted to ride here. - the mojito was delicious! & this is where the good ends for me... Like I said I am biased because I know what Cuban food is suppose to taste like. I didn't expect to be spot on with the dishes being authentic Cuban food... But I also didn't expect them to sprinkle CHILI POWDER on everything... In case you are wondering Cubans don't like spicy food. Nor does it say on the menu you are going to sprinkle a good amount of chili powder. We ordered... - tostones: they were pretty good minus the chili powder sprinkles on top. Real Cuban tostones however are crispier, larger (these were tiny), and sprinkled with just salt on top. - papas (something else in the name I forget): nothing special just fried potatoes with again chili powder sprinkled on top and some melted cheese at the bottom of the plate.. Oh and two slices of grilled onions. - $20 flank steak: it was tender and juicy. But Idk the flavor was just bland nothing popping at me. Even with the cilantro relish on top. So there you have it-- If you are looking for authentic Cuban food this is NOT the place for you. If you love chili powder and Mexican flare this is definitely a spot for you."], ["Mariana B.", "My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place to eat downtown! I've seen beautiful pictures of OCHO so I was extremely excited to go and it definitely met my expectations! It's was calm and peaceful, we walked in and sat where we wanted and the waiter immediately came to us and brought us water in less than a minute. He's name was Shahrokh and he was very attentive and with a very professional and welcoming attitude. The food, I'm a picky eater and I was very please with the menu. We ate chorizo con queso, which they only part I didn't like was the onions and tomatoes because I don't eat that but it had a great flavor, it came with tortilla and they were good!

OCHOThis is the place to go to for an all around experience of literally having Dinner by Day and Drinks at Night.This place has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde vibe and I absolutely love it.When you enter you have this fresh restaurant that has an amazing Cuban/Latin infusion twist to their food and drink menu.The chandelier and piano inside the restaurant gives it such a fun feel and the views of downtown are super sweet when dining inside or on their patio. Make sure to take a look around and notice the details. One of the more intricate restaurants with their decor.The patio is perfect for dining during those lovely Texan nights I must say. My favorite is the Cuban Style Burger and their desserts. You can't come to Ocho and not have dessert that would be nonsense! My personal fave is their twist on the iconic Churro with the dipping sauces they serve to compliment them. Trust me you won't find me sharing my dessert. I just can't rave enough about their dishes altogether.What's great about Ocho is the speakeasy bar located right underneath the restaurant. There isn't a major sign or anything but a small staircase to your right as you are heading towards their bathrooms (bathrooms are located outside).Take the plunge and your senses are immersed in this dark intimate setting. The vibe of the bar is so cool and once your eyes adjust to the low lit bar you'll be glad you stayed for a drink or two after your dinner. It was a complete different feel than the Ocho restaurant but thats what makes it great. Two atmospheres under one roof- I'm not complaining."], ["Rob And Lisa R.", "Place is romantic at night. It's small but intimate. Mojito was good. My husband & I are Cuban & Puertorican so I'm trying not to be too judgmental. Tostones appetizer was different & amazing.

Great dish but a little too much sweetness going on. Between the green bean glaze and sweet potato pur\u00e9e, it tasted almost TOO sweet. -salmon and risotto: a light and well balanced dish.

What was supposed to be a quick lunch became a 2-hour meal that we didn't want to end. Our server was attentive and accommodating, especially to our young kids whom she introduced to \"Fidel\", the goldfish who had the best spot in the room. We enjoyed quite a few things on the menu along with mojitos and margaritas, particularly the Havana Cubano, chorizo con queso and pork pozole rojo. We wanted to extend our delightful experience, so we ended up ordering espresso and all their desserts (they had 3) -- and the clear winner is the banana bread french toast with vanilla ice cream, cajeta and candied walnuts.

Ocho offers gorgeous outdoor seating by the San Antonio river and indoor seating as well. No fun sitting outdoors when the weather is blistering hot, so we got seated indoors. After perusing the menu, we started the meal with Chorizo Con Queso and Chicken Quesadilla. Minced meat baked with cheese bubbling on top and served with tortillas, Chorizo Con Queso was certainly our favorite! Our entr\u00e9e choices were Salmon Con Arroz Gandules and Pollo Envuelto. Al though the wait time was long, the meal turned out to be absolutely worth the wait. Salmon was perfectly cooked and the chicken was juicy and tender.Walked away, with our stomachs filled with lip-smacking food!"], ["John F.", "Nice place, decent food, great atmosphere.

I am not sure they did this on an artsy purpose or they were in a hurry to shut the kitchen. I mean there isn't much work in making a salad, how much of a hurry u need to be in to give the whole leaves. Might as well give me a chopping board!Also, the bill came but my mojito still hasn't.

This is one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever been to, thanks to the architecture, location (on the quiet end of the Riverwalk), and the interior design. Their brunch was phenomenally good, but their coffee and drinks are the standouts. My latte came with adorable and delicious little cookies. The avocado, bacon, and queso omelette with the side salad of arugula with lemon vinaigrette was enough to put me in a happy food coma for the full day... I'll definitely be coming back to visit."], ["Brittany G.", "So good! Had the queso w chorizo and a cubano w/ fries. Loved all of it. The atmosphere is nice and authentic.

I had the chicken mushrooms with polenta and it was delicious. The only reason i'm not giving them 5 stars is because even though it's been described as Cuban Food it's not. Not that there is anything wrong with the food. They do have a couple of cuban dishes, but it's more a \u00a0cuban/mexican fusion (delicious, but fusion nonetheless !)"], ["Arin S.", "This place was good, but not that exciting. It's beautiful, as others' pictures show, and they have some good happy hour specials (ending at 6 pm). My meal was quite delicious (the salmon!! oh, the salmon)-- though to be fair, I was just glad to eat something that wasn't an enchilada in this city. I just didn't quite feel like I got my money's worth. I think I was in and out in 20 minutes."], ["Steve W.", "Best Mojitos on the planet! Very cool eclectic space. \u00a0Pan roasted Red Snapper Pico de Paloma was yummy, as was the Salmon Con Arroz Gandules. \u00a0Well worth a visit or 2! \u00a0We made a 2nd trip just for happy hour mojitos!"], ["Blair P.", "The reason I'm giving Ocho two stars is because of the food quality. The atmosphere is gorgeous and romantic. It has an indoor/outdoor boutique vibe with a river view. Good luck on reading the menu. You better bring a flashlight if you don't have one on your phone.The service was decent, but I was not at all impressed with the food. And trust me, it takes a lot for me to dislike any type of food. I ordered the quesadillas because they weren't too overpriced... And who could go wrong with ordering quesadillas? Well it was like a big bite of flour tortilla. Hardly any cheese. Needless to say, I ate them all because I was starving, and left hungry. It's definitely a mediocre appetizer. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries. They were undercooked and hard to chew. The sandwich was average. Overall this place was overpriced for the food; maybe we will go back for brunch when it's cheaper and they have a different menu!"], ["Dylan E.", "This was one of our better finds on a trip down to San Antonio. It is a pan-Latin influenced restaurant and bar that has the whole package going as far as the food, drink, and ambiance it offers. I was here during a colder weekend, so the indoor area of this restaurant had the large glass garage doors closed that appear to be able to open if they wanted. It was a single room with a dozen or so tables that overlooked the water. It was a bright place with large chandeliers, open ductwork, one brick wall, and a ton of glass. It has a smaller bar, and a very cozy atmosphere. I think a trip in the summer would be great because they also have both a large outside seating area. They did have heaters going outside to keep the area warm, but we decided to pass on that anyway.We had our choice of seats inside, and were served quickly. They have a respectable list of cocktails ranging from $8-$12, and a mediocre selection of bottled beers in the $4-$6 range. The beer offerings weren't great, but you'll find a few Texas offerings as well as the most popular Mexican imports. They also have a good selection of spirits and wines. The food menu isn't huge, but it is not at all easy to narrow down what you want. Everything looked amazing, and we finally settled on the Ocho Salsa Platter and a Havana Cubano Torta to split between two people. The salsa platter was delicious and the $10 offering would have been enough to fill 2 of us up. It had a couple different salsas, some guacamole, and some escabeche pickled vegetables. The veggies and one of the salsas was plenty spicy enough to get your mouth tingling, the guacamole was fresh and delicious, and the other salsa was milder but very flavorful. It came with plenty of chips that tasted fresh and made in house. The $14 torta was very good. It had thick French style bread, and a generous portion of tasty ingredients inside. The only thing missing was more mustard, as it went kind of undiscovered in the sandwich. The seasoned house made chips as the side were also good, although not as fresh tasting as the tortilla chips with the salsas. Two of us ended up leaving food on the table as it was more food than we could finish.Overall, this was a great meal in a great atmosphere. Our server kept us happy, and we never felt like we had to get his attention for anything. It got a little loud inside as the entire place is basically a greenhouse so all the sound echoed, but it wasn't too bad. The table we sat at for 2 people was too small to hold our one appetizer and one entr\u00e9e, so it made eating and especially sharing dishes a little difficult. I would go back here if I was in the area again."], ["Iliana R.", "Me and my husband were in town for a day and we were looking for w place to have some late dinner and drinks.. We were staying right by the riverwalk, and we seen the Ocho sign and we yelped and seen the reviews and pictures.. The food and drinks look delish so we gave it a try and it was AMAZING. The main room for the restaurant was closed due to a private event going on, but they had the bar open which was located in the basement of the hotel. (Hotel Havana) the ambience was super chill.. Felt like we were somewhere in Cuba.. Not much lighting each table had a candle which made it a bit romantic. I loved it. I ordered a mojito, the best one I've had. My husband ordered a paloma verde, it was so tasty! We ordered la fruta mixta for an appetizer. Fred's cut fruit with lemon and powdered chili. It was great! My husband ordered the red snaper with a mango and black bean slaw. It was the best fish I've ever had. Fish is not deep fried, it's pan grilled. And last we ordered shrimp and crab campachena, spicy but super tasty. Overall, the food and drinks were amazing.

The French onion soup is a favorite winter meal, and they have some cheap lunch specials.The line gets backed up easily during lunch, so it may not be a great option if you're in a hurry.

I ordered the Country French Breakfast & it was everything I love about breakfast- eggs, potatoes and sausage! The potatoes were a \"potato galette\" and I loved it!

Finding a place to catch up with an old friend? Forget Starbucks, go to La Madeleine! Looking for breakfast after church? Go to La Madeleine! The old man who takes your order is super duper nice. He'll humor you and recommend the right items off the menu to fit your wants. I always look for him; so does the rest of my family.They serve mainly breakfast and lunch items. I have ordered many different items off the menu and honestly recommend all of them. My favorite for something light would be the Salade Sampler. With the Salade Sampler, you can choose three out of several great options. I usually order their signature cup of Tomato Basil soup (you can get that reduced-fat, same taste), Spinach Salade, and Pasta Salade. Going their for breakfast? Try their omelettes! If you're looking for a lunch entree, try their Chicken Ceasar or French Dip sandwich. You could simply order a Chicken Ceasar Salade and have it with the free bread that they offer. If you are dying for a snack, order one of their quiches or the spinach pochette. They also have American or French coffee if you've had a late night/early morning or decaf if you just want the taste of fresh coffee. You can even have as many cups as you like free of charge. Of course, they have whatever drink options you want except for alcohol. haha.Did you feel guilty yesterday? La Madeleine has Smart Choices! You're bound to be full and feel guilt-free by making the smart choice. Want dessert? I am a sucker for their cheesecake and their fruit tarts. I say they are a little pricey if you don't have a sweet-tooth, but their desserts are so incredible. Never go light on dessert. Plus, the desserts can be shared by two people since their pretty heavy. There is more I can say about La Madeleine, but experience it yourself, please!"], ["Mike F.", "The manager here is passionate, always on the ball & happily intoxicating. Highly recommend their hot sandwiches. The staff is always attentive and professional. We like the fact you can get Sweet Leaf Organic Mint Tea here. AWESOME desserts, all of them! Their double cappuccino is well worth it. \u00a0On the rare days its chilly in San Antonio there's a fire that people love to sit by. And, of course, the Tomato Basil soup is the best. Tough to decide between their French Onion with extra cheese and Tomato Basil - so just alternate each visit."], ["Rob K.", "I would not have hesitated to give this place negative stars. I have never had a worse experience in a food environment except perhaps from a rundown hole-in-a-wall in downtown serving old burritos. *The Service*Was perhaps one of the worst I've seen a quite a while. The three employees who took absolutely no time to actually give me ATTITUDE for waiting in the wrong line, then kept me and my family waiting for another five minutes to get someone to the cashier for takeout is absurd. Had these three been working at a McDonald's, they would have been fired in under a week. I would have left if my daughter wasn't so hungry. And don't think we don't notice the slights we receive from a particular employee who ignores people of color and serves everyone else, while conveniently slipping into the background when we walk up to order. The first time I thought nothing of it. The second time was rather irksome. The third, and there you have it, I've confirmed it for myself. If the manager of this establishment reads this, please reevaluate your hiring practices and take a look at your employees. It's truly a shame that a good franchise has to be marred by sub-par employees at this location."], ["Paul O.", "A nice surprise as I stopped there for breakfast on a whim. \u00a0Ordered a spinach, pepper and ham omelet with a croissant. \u00a0Perfectly buttery both the omelet and croissant. \u00a0If you are in north San Antonio area definitely stop by."], ["Thomas U.", "Great place to meet for coffee & pastry.

Take a date, perhaps? Never bothered, myself."], ["Katherine E.", "This is a chain restaurant, so I should be guaranteed constancy right? WRONG. Last week I brought my mother in for lunch, we grabbed the half sandwich/petite salad/soup combo. The best thing was the potato soup and I don't feel thats much of a compliment since its possibly pre-made, frozen, de-thawed, and reheated. The caesar salad was sad and soggy, minus the parmesan and croutons that we had to ask for. I got the only veggie sandwich offered on the menu which came with pesto, tomato, and cheese. I LOVE pesto, but the pesto tasted strange. Following this pitiful meal, I approached the desert counter to buy a fruit tart however the girl at the counter was having a conversation on the business phone and although I stood right in front and stared at her, paid no mind to me, in fact she ignored me and continued her conversation. Other employees saw me waiting \u00a0WITH EYE CONTACT and made no attempt to approach me and grant customer service. I walked out sans dessert and annoyed by the experience. This location is a disaster, the food is plated sloppily and distastefully, the customer service is bland, and I will not be returning."]], "Chez Vatel & Bistro": [["Howard H.", "Wonderful spot.

Two of us ordered the beef tenderloin which was less than OK as there was nothing special about it. Our expectations were high as we knew the establishment was high priced. It was really sad and disappointing that every one of the courses was not impressive or even good. For dessert I ordered the chocolate mousse and instead I got chocolate cookie dough ... it was not light and foamy but thick and so rich I could not do more than 3 spoons.

We were quickly (and cheerfully) greeted and sat in a window booth.The brunch menu came off as slightly confusing so the waitress had to explain it to us. It was set up as a set price (somewhere between $15-20- I can't remember exactly) and you got to chose items from each section. So for that price each, we got a bottomless supply of mimosas, french pressed coffee, a Charcuterie plate (tiered appetizer consisting of meats, vegetables, cheese, and pastries), and each got an entree. I got the french toast and it was amazing and I think my friend got the chilaquilles which I got to taste. Both were good but we both agreed the french toast was better.

Good, speedy service. We were there for Sunday brunch and were the only patrons there for over an hour. Not sure why the place was so dead. Delicious food. I had the egg panini, which was not a traditional panini. It was basically an egg sandwich on thick (cold) sourdough. Despite it not being what I expected, it was very tasty.

My fish was extremely overcooked (to the point of burnt, so rough) and it was paired with some veggies and roasted potatoes. I'm not sure why but there was only 3 people in our party and all of our food was cold by the time it came to our table. Definitely not something you want when you're at an expensive restaurant.Not worth ever coming for dinner. The prices are jacked up by 2 or 3 times. If you're going to try this place, go for lunch and pay the cheaper prices. Even then, it's not worth it."], ["Raquel A.", "It was okay hardly any selection what I picked was good the stuffed chicken and the salad but too expensive"], ["Stephen C.", "The patio area is fantastic.

The dishes were something a kid could make amd only cafteria quality at best. Not what I expected from a place advertised as European cuisine. The bread was grossly overbuttered and cheap and in no way homemade or high quality. \u00a0The lemon butter sauce was instead a thick yellowish cream that tasted acidic and was neither lemony or buttery. The vegetables we were told come with the seafood plates we ordered were not the same as we received. The service was terrible...owner and waitstaff were rude and acted like we were bugging them.

Alan and I had read the Yelp reviews, so we knew the ratings weren't good. \u00a0We read over the menu and decided independently that salads would probably be the best bet.The setting is lovely, w/ large windows looking out onto the gardens and the always magnificent oaks. \u00a0There were attractive landscape photographs on the walls. \u00a0I didn't see the Alaskan hunting lodge decor that Josh K. referred to. Maybe it was in a different room. \u00a0We were seated at a quiet table and given menus. \u00a0The waitress took our drink orders and brought our drinks. She told us the specials and then left us to talk. \u00a0Eventually we looked at the menus and made our decisions. Alan and Kay both chose the Crumpets' Special Salad, which contained sliced charbroiled chicken breast, Canadian shrimp and Texas pecans on a bed of lettuce w/ a non dairy dressing of some sort. \u00a0I appreciated that our waitress specified that the dressing was non dairy. \u00a0I chose the Mediterranean Salad, which consisted of three types of lettuce w/ artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, sliced red onions, kalamata olives, pepperoncini and feta cheese w/ a vinaigrette dressing. \u00a0It seemed to me that our salads took a long time to arrive, although Alan doesn't think so. \u00a0Our waitress didn't bring us bread until Alan requested it after the salads had arrived. It would have been better had she brought it while we were waiting. \u00a0Oddly, she asked us how everything was when we'd had nothing but our drinks. \u00a0I had iced tea, Alan had iced coffee and Kay had water. \u00a0When the salads arrived they were generously proportioned w/ the dressings on the side. \u00a0Mine was good, the tomatoes tasty, the feta assertive and the onions not overly pungent. \u00a0The ingredients blended well. \u00a0Alan thought his was good as well. \u00a0Neither was great, but they were good. \u00a0The most important thing was the company and being able to catch up, which we did."], ["Betsy K.", "Stay away!

I got the Sunday Brunch it came with a starter of cream cheese with salmon and capers and crostinis, the salmon was a little fishier than I would have liked. The salad with the house dressing was very good, like a tangy blue cheese. I chose the beef tenderloin for the main course, the beef was excellent, cooked medium rare and tender. The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery, the green beans and carrots were bland and unimpressive.For every meh dish they had a pretty good one so I would round this place out to a solid three stars.

The food was overpriced and underwhelming. \u00a0Our appetizer--we ordered the smoked salmon--was depressing at best; two small pieces of salmon, a glob of cream cheese and some toast, garnished with capers. \u00a0Although the meats were adequately cooked (I had salmon and my wife had the rack of lamb), the accompanying sides and salads could just as well be served in a Luby's cafeteria (and on the same dishes no less). \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the food's shortcomings, you will pay fine dining prices. Finally, the service. \u00a0Despite having only 3-4 tables (it wasn't busy ... it was a wednesday evening!), our waiter lumbered around the place as if he was deep in the weeds; speaking loudly to other waitstaff, dropping dishes to the floor, and leaving dirty plates on virtually everyone's table for extended periods of time. \u00a0After asking for the check, I had to wait another 10 minutes before I finally had to get up and ask the host to track down our waiter for us. \u00a0We were there for almost 2 hours, only 30 minutes of which we had food on our table.Maybe we just had a bad experience--I have heard good things about their brunch--but I wouldn't waste my time and money at this place again."], ["Mark T.", "Went last SaturdayVery reasonably priced special.

I originally wanted the artichoke ravioli but was informed they were out of it, which was a surprise since there was no one there. They should probably just take it off the menu. Anyway, I decided to settle for the cheese ravioli and it was terrible! I have had better frozen food than that. When I told the waitress she didn't seem surprised; instead, she offered to exchange my plate and suggested the spinach pasta made in house. (Another sign the ravioli was frozen!) That was a little better but the sauce had a strange taste and smell. I ended up not eating anything basically. Horrible, overpriced food.

While the restaurant is attractive, the service and the cuisine left a lot to be desired.  \u00a0 Slightly stale bread was brought to the table, and I had to request butter. I opted to begin with a truffled duck liver pate. (I've purchased the same damn type of pate at HEB, and this version was not an improvement) For my main course, I stuck with a very simple dish to prepare, Breast of Chicken Chasseur. The chicken breast was tough and undercooked, plus the sauce ladled over it was remarkably like Swanson's chicken gravy out of a can.

He did bring out a sample of all the sauces for the beef, none of which resembled the one I was given.

Super small size!My husband had the beef tenderloin - the beef itself was tender, but the sauce they put on it was nasty, tasted like the kind of gravy you buy from a jar and it was doused with it.Also, the bathroom is gross - only one stall for females and one for males. There was a piece of duct tape holding up the baby changing station so that it doesn't fall on you while you sit on the toilet...Speaking of the bathroom, my husband actually threw up in there because the clam chowder was soo salty and so was the artichoke appetizer that it made his stomach uneasy - he only ate it because he was starving and hadn't eaten anything earlier because we thought we would have a nice dinner...but that clearly wasn't the case!Oh and I saw some of their pastries ---They looked like they were the prepackaged ones you can buy at a grocery store!

This was quite a contrast to our present experience at the Crumpets on Harry Wurzbach. \u00a0When we saw a Groupon for Crumpets with previous experience in mind , we were anticpating an excellent meal. The Groupon stated that a reservation was required. When we arrived on a Saturday night we were the only patrons in the restaurant.

As we entered the restaurant- the owner whom we had remembered as enthusiastic and passionate, now sat at the entrance , sloppily dressed , surfing the internet and oblivious to customers entering the establishment. \u00a0Our waiter was less than impressive as well. He seemed apathetic and bored. \u00a0Our drinks were delivered and placed on the corner of the table- as if to say- get them yourselves. \u00a0We continued to wait for our appetizer as the patrons that had come in after us, already had bread , appetizer and had moved on to the salad. We had nothing... We had ordered the stuffed mushrooms- priced at $6.50. \u00a0We laughed as 3 extremely small bite sized mushrooms were delivered. Granted they were delicious however the portion was skimpy. The bread was placed on our table at that time- stale and crunchy barely edible.

We ordered a bottle of Pino Nior and relaxed for only about 15-20 mintues before ordering as we were super hungry. \u00a0I was a bit put off that the wine was served with short, thick, cheap wine glasses. \u00a0I expected to be served our bottle with proper glasses.The house salads which came with our meals were excellent, a crisp array of greens topped with a home made creamy dressing and sided with a healthy serving of tomatoes. The bread served was fantastic - baked in house and served with a garlicky butter spread complimented with chopped parsley.I ordered the vegetarian plate - steamed veggies, baked brie, goat cheese stuffed artichoke and house made spinach fettucine with pine nuts, sun dried tomatoes and olive oil.Hubby had the primavera, house made spinach pasta, fresh steamed veggies (carrots, zucchini, squash, cauliflower) and a very light but creamy pasta sauce.Other posters have mentioned that they consider the price to be high - I cannot comment on the price of the entrees we did not order BUT for what we did order, I consider the prices to be fair.Special touches like house made pasta, sauces, dressings, fresh vegetables etc. really mean quality to me. \u00a0Personally, I would not want a less expensive choice of dry pasta, frozen veggies and jarred sauces. \u00a0I'll choose house made any day and I am willing to pay for that quality.Entrees were not finished of course and we had food to take home.Being that Crumpets has an attached bakery we could not pass up a slice of the amaretto cheese cake.All in all, we had a really nice night, had the patio to ourselves, had a great server, saw a skunk, had delish wine and ate well."], ["Donna H.", "I was invited for \u00a0lunch with a friend and her father.

The rest of the interior feels like someones living room, I didn't like it. Outside looks very nice though. The owner was incredibly unfriendly. The worst was the way he treated his employees right in front of his patrons. Treated them just like 5 year olds, very awkward.

Nicest guy in the world then took care of us, but he was the exception. Wish I could remember his name dangit, but he was a short hispanic guy amongst a bunch of older white ladies if that helps. Overall, I think it is overpriced. The only thing I liked was the rack of lamb, but it was awesome."], ["Cassandra S.", "Crumpetts is one of my top favorites!! The Sunday brunch is amazing! Great atmosphere both outside and in. You can dine outside on the nice patio on a beautiful day and enjoy the weather or try indoors one evening in which the restaurant usually has a piano.I have not had one bad bite at this restaurant...wait, I will \u00a0take that back, I was not particularly fond of their salmon cakes :( But that's really about it, everything else was scrumptious. Their pate is reeeeeeally good!! I could eat it all day. If you're hungry, this restaurant does not keep you waiting for food. You have your appetizers, your bread, then your salad, and your meal......and all without feeling over-stuffed at the end of it all. Oh, and I've only tried one of Crumpetts' desserts, but that's because the one I have tried (the strawberry chantilly cake) is so amazing that I will not try anything else!! One the most moist cakes I have ever had, and with little slivers of strawberries inside the creamy icing of the cake. I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place!! A really great restaurant!"], ["Melody L.", "Meh. I hate to rate it at such a low rating because the people who worked there were nice, but...So you know what's awesome? When your fridge breaks down just before Thanksgiving. Awesome. I frantically called all over SA to make reservations to dine out. I chose Crumpets. Wah wah wahhhhhh. Located just off Harry Wurzbach outside of Alamo Heights, this cutesy looking restaurant sits among large trees. Take a seat in the good sized dining room or opt to sit on the large patio outside. We chose the latter, and though it was really pretty outside sitting among the trees... I kind of felt like we were in one. It sort of felt like I had invited my fam up to my tree house for lunch. Huh.The menu offered three appetizers--Mousse Truffle Pat\u00e9, Smoked Salmon with Cream Cheese and Artichoke stuffed with Goat Cheese and almonds. Choices of entrees included Tenderloin of Beef, Veal and Fresh Rainbow Trout. They also offered traditional roasted turkey, baked ham with stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, fresh green beans and cranberry sauce. For dessert we chose between pumpkin and pecan pie. The salmon appetizer wasn't bad, the pate was alright considering where we were and the trout looked pretty good. My dad said the trout tasted really good and my brother made a fool out of his plate full of turkey. I didn't really like it because it all tasted a bit canned. My step mom and I were both a little bleh with the food, but we were satisfied with mimosas and Pinot Grigio. The pie wasn't that great either.So I won't be coming back. If you have to go, eat before or save your appetite. Go by and have a drink outside if anything.

One of our salads had no dressing, the beef wellington was drenched in a gravy so the pastry was soggy and the potatoes had sort of a freezer burn taste to them like they were frozen and not fresh.

This wasn't a simple check in to see how we were doing but instead a genuine appreciation for our visit. The owner shared a personal story that left me thinking into the night, it was a very unique experience. Beyond that tidbit, I came here with a colleague of mine and we both enjoyed the steak with French fries. My favorite dish however was the foie gras they had as an appetizer. This was no patte or paste, but the actual duck liver seared and cooked to perfection. The steak was also cooked just as we ordered, you could have cut through the meat with a butter knife. Quite frankly, I was leaning towards a 4 star experience because of the location, ambiance and overall setting. I incorporate this as a big component of my dining experience. There's nothing truly special about the actual restaurant itself in terms of its architecture or design, but the food and the service could not have possibly been better.

Both times we have been here, the place has been packed. Be prepared for some screaming competition. 2 for 2 now that we left with our ears ringing from our \"neighbors' conversation\".Their food is well prepared and executed, but the flavor is not exactly my cup of tea.

Everything was super delicious as expected. I'm excited to find a restaurant in the SA area that knows how to make good escargots! I love escargot,but unfortunately not every restaurant prepares it properly.My husband opted for the Prix Fixe menu which is a 3-course meal for $39. This menu changes nightly. He had a savory tart for an appetizer, lamp chops with au gratin potatoes for an entree, and chocolate mousse for dessert. I tasted everything he had and they were all amazing as well.

You can choose any type you'd like and I had Bavarian (beer, bacon, whole grain mustard)...WOW! Better than any mussels I actually ate in Belgium, seriously. Delicious and worth a trip alone. I had a taste of Sarah J's mussels with Spanish chorizo...equal wow factor. Order mussels, NO DOUBT.For lunch, I enjoyed the savory leek tart with a simple mixed green salad. Superb. The coq au vin was also tasty, but the chicken was too dry. I'm more of a thigh person than breast...with my chicken anyway...The chocolate mousse was good, not great, but a good end cap to the meal. I was so excited about the mussels that I just had to cram in the Belgium waffle, too.

But it was deff packed by 7:30ish. Also parking is very limited so prepare to spend some time finding a spot. Upon entering, I thought the restaurant was a lot smaller than I expected. Note they also have a few tables outside. Ambiance was nice but it wasn't upscale or anything like that, pretty casual I'd say. I studied the menu beforehand so I already knew I wanted to try their mussels with frites which is a signature dish in Belgium. Our waiter recommended the pesto mussels which turned out to be pretty satisfying and delicious. It also came with a huge side of frites (French fries) and I thought it was OK. I have never been a fan of French fries. They aren't healthy, ppl! Our meal also came with complimentary bread which I thought was also just OK. Overall I thought the experience was on par but it wasn't phenomenal. Maybe I should come back to try more things on the menu. My dining companion seemed to be satisfied with her meal but wasn't super impressed either. Regardless I was happy with my mussels so I'll give them a 4 star.

My wife had been told about the place and since she's a huge seafood fan we knew we just had to try it.Make reservations! They open at 6PM for dinner and we were some of their first customers of the evening. In about 30 minutes the place was absolutely hopping with couples and groups coming through the door. Everyone was asked if they had a reservation... Anyway, it's a very good idea to get one.As you may well know, this place is a Belgian Bistro specializing in frites (Belgian-style fries) and mussels. If you've never had the pleasure of eating frites, that's reason enough to come here even if that's the only thing you order. La Frite has a good selection of Belgian beers both bottled and on tap. The bottled beers, as you can imagine, are more expensive on average. It's hard to go wrong with a Belgian beer selection so simply point at something and enjoy. However, the waiter did offer us a sample of any of the on-tap beers to assist us in making our decisions. I really enjoyed my Karmeliet but at $9 for a small glass, it's pricey.La Frite starts you off with complimentary bread which I always appreciate. It's a simple white bread with a crispy crust and soft bread inside. Our second bread was not crunchy on the outside so that was a bit of a disappointment. We started by splitting a Salade de Fruit et Fromage (mixed green salad with roasted pear, gorgonzola cheese, and a balsamic reduction). The salad was very tasty and the slightly heated pear was enhanced with the balsamic reduction. The waiter offered to have the salad split in the kitchen rather than have us do it at the table.My wife ordered the large Moules Frites. All their mussels are prepared in your choice of 7 styles. My wife chose Marinieres which is white wine, cream, shallots, and garlic. The mussels have a luxurious, velvety texture that is complemented by the garlic cream sauce. The only downer was their size. These mussels have the large shell but the mussels themselves are the size of a dime. Very tasty, very small.I ordered the Onglet avec Frites. What's that? It's a hanger steak from the bottom (flank) of the cow. I read that it was once called the butcher's cut because butchers would save it for themselves. It was served with mixed vegetables and frites. The steak was obviously from the flank as seen in the long muscle fibers. The steak comes precut with what I think is caramelized onions. It's a very delicious and tender steak. The mixed vegetables consisted of squash, carrots, and broccoli. They were seasoned with just the right amount of salt and came out tender and tasty. Now we come to the namesake of the restaurant, the frites. If you've never had frites, you might just think that they're the exact same things as French fries. While the two are shaped the same, that's where the comparison ends. Frites are made by frying them twice. After the initial frying, they are allowed to rest for several hours at room temperature. Then they are fried again in small batches for just a couple of minutes. This creates a very crispy, crunchy exterior with a soft center. They are then seasoned to taste. La Frite's frites are very crunchy with a soft center and seasoned delightfully. A must try, obviously.We finished our meal with a slice of cranberry cheesecake. This is not a dense NY cheesecake. This cheesecake is a light and airy cheesecake with a tart taste to it. For those who avoid desserts because they're too sweet, like me, this is your dessert. It came with a dollop of whipped cream and a drizzle of unknown provenance - possible a cranberry reduction.Our waiter was very attentive without being intruding. He was able to recommend beers for certain foods as well as wines to complement the different sauces for the mussels. The restaurant itself is located in an older building on Alamo Street. Seating is limited and since this is a popular place you should make reservations. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at La Frite Belgian Bistro and will return, if only for the frites..."], ["Jules K.", "Best mussels I ever had! I live in Houston, and drove there just to eat here - that says it all!You must make a reservation, otherwise be prepared to leave hungry or wait for an hour."], ["Ted O.", "I snuck in here just before they closed for lunch, and I'm happy I made it in time.This is an adorable little bistro and - like any self-respecting Belgian establishment - \u00a0they have a delightful selection of high quality Belgian beers. \u00a0I had the hanger steak and frites, and it was very good. \u00a0It was a mite cold, which helped bring the review down to four stars, but the flavor was spot on. The frites were also great, and the aioli that they came with was also great.Not a cheap place, but well worth the money."], ["Katie W.", "Yes yes I know. Another 5 star review, but what can I say? If a place deserves it, I gotta write it and La Frite most definitely deserves 5 stars.My fiance took me here for my early 30th b-day celebration dinner and the experience was everything one could ask for.Our server was absolutely superb. I wish I knew his name so I could give him some credit, but I never got it. I was having a dilemma choosing between the hanger steak and the duck breast. I asked our server what he thought and he recommended the duck. I'm so glad he did. The duck was AMAZING! It was juicy and full of flavor. There was light char on the outside which made the skin crisp and the berries paired perfectly with the flavor of the duck. I didn't even know duck could be cooked medium rare, but it can and it was wonderful. The vegetables it came with were surprisingly delicious as well. They were tender and very very well seasoned. No bland steamed veggies on this plate. The grits were fine. The texture was nice and creamy and the flavor was okay, but I'm just not a grits kind of girl so to me, they were just okay. The fries or frites were very good. Crisp and fresh.I tried my fiances chicken dish and it was mouth watering. The creamy sauce it came with was outstanding. Both our dishes were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. One of the best parts of the night was my beer order. Our server told us about 2 rotating seasonal beers. I ordered one and he brings me beer topped with a lot of foam. Too much. He said they just tapped out and that he will not charge us for the beer since it's technically not a full pour. Even though it wasn't a full glass, there was an adequate amount and once the foam settled, there was plenty, but we still weren't charged for an expensive beer. That's REAL customer service. I would definitely return to La Frite. They gave me an excellent big 3 0 birthday dinner."], ["Jeff F.", "My wife and I have been here a few times, never had mussels until I ate here and they are AWESOME, also like the Kwak belgian beers they have, great fries, just about everything is good, casual but classy environment, good restaurant to put in your rotation or bring out of town guests"], ["Joseph S.", "I took my friend here for dinner Saturday night since I wanted to come here for a long time. We ordered three dishes (Saumon Dijonaise, Steak Tartare, \u00a0and Marini\u00e8res Mussels) with two glasses of wine. The Marini\u00e8res mussels weren't that good, it has no flavor and we just didn't like it that much. Steak Tartare is delicious, It is raw and tasty, very good. Saumon Dijonaise is very tender and delicious as well. Service is great, loved our waiter. Great place for a dinner date.The only downer was I was sitting infront of, I guess picture art?, 3 guys in their underwear standing in a fountain pool. I didn't want to look at it, but it kept drawing my attention. I think the guy infront looks like Hugh Jackman, maybe that's why I was looking at it? I don't know. Also, if you can, get a table inside, if you sat next to the door, the sun can be in your eyes."], ["Curt C.", "Le Frite! Tres Chic! Belgian food! This place is amazing. Simply amazing. I really enjoy the whole premise of this place, it's all based on Belgian cuisine. So they have a lot of seafood, and wonderful beers. We got the mussels, which this place is known for. We opted for the Marinieres, and the Thai mussels. The Marinieres was creamy, garlicy, and beyond fantastic. The rich creamy consistency goes so well with the mussels, and the bread that they serve up. I was pleasantly surprised about their Thai mussels- it's coconut milk, lemongrass and spice. It's got a nice punch to the flavor with the spicy undertones. They serve up a wide variety of Belgian beers. I always recommend the Marisdous, which is super strong and flavorful. We got the wine that's recommended to go with the mussels, which was a great pairing. It was a sweet and dry kind of white wine that went really well with the meal. The service was great, and they did a great job of taking care of us, and making sure that we had a great dining experience. The restaurant is clean, and well lit, with interesting Belgian decor. It really does feel like a little Belgian Bistro that could just as easily be in Brussels! Check this place out, especially on First Friday when you can see all the art aficionados walking by on S Alamo!"], ["Daniel K.", "Extremely well prepared with attentive service. It's a small place so you'll need a reservation but the staff is extremely accommodating.

Although, I prefer the pesto over the Spanish mussels, but I still enjoyed them! Had the steak au poivre again, and it was as amazing as last time. I wish I tried something different, but I trust the rest of the menu is just as superb! I can't wait to come again, this place is amazing."], ["Tony D.", "I stopped by here for lunch, and I was very impressed with how attentive and helpful my server was throughout the process.

The fries had the right amount of crisp and salt, and paired with the ketchup they were awesome. The steak itself was already cut into pieces, and it was dripping with flavor. Finally, even the vegetables had some zest to them, and there was plenty of it to go with the meal.

The wine selection by the glass was fair, but quite tasty. Our service was efficient, knowledgeable, and non-invasive. Great dessert variety!"], ["Sarah J.", "I made the novice mistake of visiting La Frite on a Saturday night without a reservation! It was around 7pm when we arrived and were told that the next opening would be at 8:30. Yikes! We were lucky though, someone canceled (or maybe missed?) their reservation, allowing us to be seated not too long after arrival. About 20 minutes later, a huge crowd arrived, most mulling about the bar area where we were seated until tables opened up for them.The crowd was generally split into two categories: affluent older people and a hip younger crowd. There weren't many children in the restaurant at all, which was nice. Because the place was so busy though, it took a long time ordering/getting our order. They do give you bread to hold you over, but a girl can only eat so much bread! We enjoyed a few beers and a very random violin solo in the interim. When our food finally arrived, it was amazing! We ordered the salade de fruit et fromage, which is a mixed green salad with the most wonderful roasted pear stuffed with gorganzola cheese and a balsamic dressing. The pear was nice and warm when it came out, it blended incredibly well with the cheese. Our next course, which arrived maybe 15 minutes later, was the steak tartare. I'm always slightly nervous about eating raw meat, so I wanted to wait at least a day to write this review, just in case I got food poisoning (I didn't!). Although it doesn't say in on the menu, the steak tartare comes with a salad and frites (fries). Pretty much everything on the menu comes with frites, ask for extra aioli for dipping! The tartare itself was delicious. It tasted like it had horseradish in it (I love horseradish), but it doesn't. Instead, it comes with capers, mustard, cornichon pickles and shallots mixed in with the raw beef and shaped like a giant uncooked hamburger patty. It is absolutely delicious, though after seeing all of the mussels being brought out (we were seated between the bar and the kitchen, so we got to see everything that came out of the kitchen), we will definitely have to go back for those!Despite the long waits and the overcrowded bar area, we had a great time and had some delicious food. I would recommend going at lunch or an off time, because clearly Saturday dinnertime is very busy!"], ["Mark W.", "This is a great place for regional French and Belgian \u00a0dishes outside of what is otherwise offered in San Antonio. \u00a0This is a place to go for something different. \u00a0Oysters were excellent, and being sourced from the Canadian Maritime Provinces , something different than the a Gulf a Coast oysters usually found in the Texas region. \u00a0Diverse, mainly French wine choices. \u00a0The wine list sorts wines by taste, but was inconsistent with my experience. \u00a0I'd just order what you know, and worry about listing. \u00a0Waiter had a cursory knowledge of wine, so this place might benefit from a sommelier circulating, especially as La Frite has a selection outside the norm. \u00a0Salads and enters were fresh and well prepared. \u00a0The crab crepe was of the rich, creamy French style. \u00a0Atmosphere is on genial and not too far from tourist central. \u00a0Recommended for those looking for something different"], ["Rebecca M.", "Food was great, and our server was awesome.

Waiter could not read his own handwriting and kept verifying our orders. Orders still came out wrong, and one diner at our table waited an extra hour for his meal, which was forgotten. Disaster ensued when trying to get the final bill for everyone! Food: La frite really shouldn't capitalize on their mussels since they are not the star of the show to be honest. Their other dishes, such as the duck breast and steak are much better than their mussels. The side of polenta and mixed veg were good as well. I ordered proven\u00e7ale style, but they gave me marini\u00e8re , but I had been waiting too long to complain and switch it. The soup base wasn't anything extraordinary, and most sadly, the mussels were shriveled up meat pieces. They were each the size of my pinky nail! I have never seen such small mussels. The fries were hit or miss with some being nice and crunchy while others were mushed and soggy. However, they had good flavor. The \u00eele flottante for dessert felt unpolished as the meringue still had granules of sugar in \u00a0each bite, which meant they did not incorporate it well. The cr\u00eame anglaise was just too sweet. Small portion too. The cr\u00eame br\u00fbl\u00e9e was worth it though! Advise getting that. Overall, it is ok to try for the experience, since this is sadly the only one of its kind in San Antonio. Try the other main plates that are not the mussels, and get the cr\u00eame br\u00fbl\u00e9e.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making for a nice date night, or girl's night out.I had the crab crepe, and we shared a bowl of mussels and frites. The crepe was delicious, but after awhile I got tired of the cheesy, creamy mixture with the crab and crepe. The mussels were wonderful. There is a wide selection of sauces to choose from, and we decided on the basque style. The spiciness of the chorizo with the wine flavored broth meshed well with the flavor of the mussels, and there was a generous portion of them in the bowl. The frites were outstanding, some of the best fries I've had in a while! They were perfectly crispy, with a lovely contrasting softness on the inside when you bit into them.Overall, a great restaurant in the San Antonio area.

The food was just amazing. We started off with mussels and there were many sauces you could choose from; we had the one with garlic and cream. It was divine and not too heavy. It came with a side of frites. The frites were just the perfect texture; crispy on the top and tender on the inside and it was over-salty. For our entrees we ordered a petite plate; crab crepes which came with a side of salad. The crab was cooked in a mushroom sauce and who would have thought crab meat and mushrooms go well together! The salad dressing was pretty good too. We ordered duck which was really tender, it literally came off the bone. It came with the side of steamed veges and a mashed corn bread something.

I could haved picked up the bowl and poured the broth down my throat. Ridiculously delicious. They are served with crispy hand cut fries. Two dipping sauces...herbed aioli and ketchup. The aioli was great, but the ketchup was just the basic Heinz variety. They could easily up the ante by making their own ketchup.The one and only shortcoming of this entire experience was the bread they served. It was cold, soft, store bought french loaf. It really did nothing to accent or elevate the meal. A meal this great deserves a bread equal in quality.

It was delicious. I had the puff pastry with seafood and a cream sauce, and was very impressed. The mussels that came with this dish were great. I enjoyed the ambiance as well. It was small, with paper over the tables, and seemed liked a nice place to have wine around dinner. The server was very nice and helped me decide on my meal.

S.", "#AllergenInfo - Soy, Corn: Their fry oil contains soy, and while their crepes don't contain soy ingredients, the non-stick spray they use on the crepe pan does. Their puff pastry contains a mix of soy and cottonseed oils. The bread they serve comes from an outside vendor, so they don't know the ingredients of that. However, the veggies, polenta, and demi-glace are all soy free. Of course, the polenta is made from corn.After a couple of rounds of our waiter checking with the kitchen, they found out that I could safely have the Duck Breast, with a berry demi-glace, veggies, and polenta.The veggies were wonderfully al dente, and for the first time ever, I thought that there wasn't enough broccoli on my plate.The polenta had an amazing almost liquid corn bread flavor to it. It was so good that I saved the rest of it to finish last.The duck had a good distinct flavor, with a noticeably seared top.My wife had a special that night: pan-seared striped bass with buerre blanc on a bed of couscous, with the same seasonal vegetables as I had. She said that the couscous, which looked like miniature pearls, was excellent, and she shared my opinion that the veggies were first-rate. The fish had a nice crunch on the seared side, but it was still moist and flaky on the inside. The standout of my meal were the veggies and especially the polenta. Even though I couldn't have their signature frites, I can see myself coming back for the wonderful side that I did have.BTW - A minor word of warning: On their website they say that dinner parking is available at Goodyear Tire on S. Presa and Alamo St. We asked about this at the Goodyear location, and they said it was not true. However, there are a few specially marked parking places at the corner of Alamo and Barreta Streets."], ["steve y.", "Great little bistro, had the provencial moules frites, & hanger steak with wine.

If in doubt- make reservations; Saturday night seemed very busy with larger parties so some of the patrons left hungry.  \u00a0We sat in the dining room with the bar so our setting was much more romantic. Our waiter, Patrick, was very knowledgeable about the beer, wine, and food menu and had several recommendations for us first-timers. We started off with the small portion of mussels with the marinieres sauce. It was to die for! We ended up ordering extra bread to soup up the sauce. Patrick kept an eye on our progression of the meal and didn't order our entrees until we were about halfway done with our mussels. Perfect timing considering that our food was hot and fresh when it arrived at our table.  \u00a0As an entree, we ordered the battered lobster tail and the hangar steak. Each had a heaping serving of piping hot frites and perfectly seasoned vegetables. The hangar steak was served medium rare and was so tender, I didn't even require my steak knife. The lobster tail was also very good, well seasoned, and very moist.  We finished our meal with the chocolate mousse and some Tawny Port. Such a great combination. Can't wait to go back- everything was superb!"], ["lu l.", "Warning: \u00a0TLDR.. but worth reading if you plan on eating here...Four of us went to this restaurant after the DTech show for dinner. \u00a0Came here because of the 4.5 star reviews. \u00a0Plus we never tried a French/Belgium type of restaurant so figure it'd be fun and we'd give it a try. \u00a0OH man.. would never go there again even if they paid me!We ordered the Vol-Au-Vent Fruits De Men, Vol-Au-Vent De Poulet, and Magret De Sanard and Frites (French Fries) as appetizer. Before diving into the review, I grew up in Houston, so I know how Texans like their food a bit on the salty side; which I'm ok with. \u00a0BUT DAMN! all the Vol-Au-Vent dishes tasted like someone just poured a whole box of Morton Salt on there!At first I thought it was only my Vol-Au-Vent Fruits De Men was salty, but when my coworkers were all trying to wash it down with the ice water they served.. I knew it was salty for them as well.It was so salty it made my upper and lower lip shrink like no tomorrow and that usually happens when it's too salty or too much MSG.For me besides the dish being salty, the Vol-Au-Vent Fruits De Men didn't carry any flavor. \u00a0There were 3 shrimps, all OVER cooked and tasted dry and rubbery; even I can take any Kirkland frozen shrimp and make it succulent, juicier and tastier than that! \u00a0The salmon, there were about 5 small bites chunk of it, which would have tasted better if it was grilled first before drenched and lathered in the cream sauce. \u00a0The mushroom was spongy didn't carry any texture. \u00a0The puff pasty I enjoyed, as long as it didn't touch the salty cream sauce. \u00a0The mussel was overcooked as well and tasted just like frozen dried mussel. \u00a0The steamed veggie was bland, but at that point, i'm happy to eat! \u00a0The salad, they should have of served separately, because it too was swimming in the salty cream sauce.I almost wanted to go in to the kitchen and recook the dish myself! \u00a0I'm sure mine will taste way better than what was served. \u00a0The sauce was what killed the dish. \u00a0Had I know I would have requested they put the sauce on the side.. or better yet.. \"FTS\"... forget the sauce!The only dish that was good.. was the Magret De Sanard. \u00a0This is probably the only plate that tasted like French style of cooking. The duck was succulent and taste was well balanced with the sauce. \u00a0The only thing I wished they had done was make the skin a bit more crispy to balance with the tenderness of the duck. \u00a0For $24, it's a bit steep, but compared to everything else we had that night.. it's well worth it!The Frites (belgium french fries) was ok, nothing unique of special about it besides the dipping sauce they provided which made it taste ok.Bottom line, this was the worst $19 I spent on the Vol-Au-Vent Fruits De Men, which almost felt like a tourist trap.So if you like eating a sub-par French/ Belgium food from the Dead Sea, this is the spot! \u00a0But at $19 a plate... you will get better value at Olive Garden ordering their Seafood Alfredo or any seafood dish."], ["Matt F.", "Nothing terribly disappointing, but nothing extraordinary- a solid 3-star. \u00a0I would disagree with some of the other reviewers on the mussels... While good (they usually are), nothing set these apart except the choices. \u00a0They have about 7 different styles, which would be fun to try. \u00a0If anything, our mussels were smaller than average. \u00a0The fries were good. \u00a0 And the onion & Brie tart was a bit underwhelming. Mostly just an egg tart, not so much onions or Brie. \u00a0Very small to boot."], ["Cindy L.", "The food is very good, and the server is very nice. \u00a0The atmosphere is very European, which means leisurely. \u00a0People come to eat and read a book, literally. \u00a0We were lucky to get a table without a reservation, but I think a making a reservation is usually the norm. \u00a0The food comes out hot and cooked to order, but it took its time coming. \u00a0We were there for 2 hours! \u00a0The food was worth the wait though; it's definitely a one of a kind place with a French flair. \u00a0The escargot was okay, a bit too much spice. \u00a0The mussels... Now this is what they are known for! \u00a0The lamb was good, and they do dessert well. \u00a0Definitely a cool spot to take a date or have some good conversation with friends. We had plenty of time to just chill, enjoy our food and conversation."], ["Michael R.", "We went here last Friday night as we had some friends in from out of town. I wanted to showcase how good restaurants are in San Antonio and had heard wonderful things about La Frite from my mother. I wasn't disappointed. La Frite gets the concept of what a bistro is and really reminded me of streetside cafes that were my favorite dining options during my travels in both Belgium and France. Since our sitter had to cancel on us at the last minute we brought our 3 year old son along. No problem with that! He immediately charmed both our waiter and the front-of-house manager. We immediately got him an order of pomme frites, which of course originated in Belgium. Theirs really reminded me of one's that I had in the Old country too, thicker cut and perfectly crispy outside and tender inside and served with a lovely aioli and ketchup. I ordered the carrot soup for my appetizer and I opted for the steak au pouvre. Theirs is a lovely rendition of a pepper-crusted beef tenderloin with that wonderful peppercorn sauce and it was served with sauteed seasonal vegetables and frites along with more aioli. However my favorite frite sauce remains the mixture of steak juices and the peppercorn sauce. My wife ordered the mussels prepared in the very traditional Northern French and Belgian way, steamed in \u00a0heavy cream white wine and shallots. Tasting them transported me to the very first time that I had tried moules in Normandy. I even taught her how to eat them as I had learned in country by using one shell to free the mussel from the other shell and then shoveling it into your mouth, c'est bon! We shared both of our meals with the little man and he seemed to like dad's steak a little better than mom's moules. As it would be expected in a proper bistro they have a great wine list; however, the Belgians' beer is world renowned, and is just beginning to gain popularity here in the states. Of course they have known that across the pond for centuries. I opted for a Hoegaarden on tap, which was a beer I and first tried at the Brussels Midi train station during a train switch on my way to Amsterdam. Just like at that trackside bar they poured it into a proper Hoegaarden glass, yet another thing that transported me to my time in Europe. For desert my wife wanted creme brule\u00e9. We shared one and it was a perfect example of this delicacy. Other items which stood out in our dining party was the duck breast served with a berry sauce. I will definitely try that next time I go. The homemade chocolate ice cream and the chocolate mousse also looked divine. Everything all on this was a wonderful evening of dining out in which I very much look forward to repeating in the not-so-distant future."], ["Angie F.", "This Belgium Bistro is lovely.

When they arrived, they were ALL ice and tasted like pure lemonade/limeade. There was barely at mint and it was about five sips through the straw and the drink was finished! And they were $10 each. The bartender came to take our check and we mentioned to him that he should add less ice next time, he rudely looked at us and said \"that's the way I was told to make them here\".

I tried the lam burger with sweet potato fries with the other two in my party has the crab cakes and lamb pasta. Each had their own distinct flavor, which was a surprise and delight. The lamb burger was a bit overly gamey, but since it was my first lamb burger, I cannot compare it to any other that I have eaten. It was on a soft bread and came with a side of sweet potato fries and BBQ dip. The fries definitely had a spivey kick. The burger also had chopped spring mix. The crab cakes were melt in your mouth delicious and came with a small side of chopped spring mix. The pasta was in a red wine sauce and very tasty. The lamb looked to be from the same ground meat as my lamb burger. However, there was no gamey flavor at all. Service was not as quick as expected since there were only a few tables full. However, we were outside so it is understandably slower at times to get prompt service on refills. Overall, it was to be expected so I don't expect that to deter me from returning to Zinc. For anyone wanting a meal to enliven your palate, I would suggest you stop at Zinc."], ["Aziz M.", "Calling all meat heads out there, not you buff dudes, you can leave. Yes, you meat loving veggie avoiding so much Whataburger in your small intestines that you're about to explode people. You will want to come here for the burger alone and then come back to try everything else. My first experience with this place was a quick dinner before getting lost in some downtown bars. I shared the tableside guac with my date and it was fun to watch, apparently super fresh since saw all ingredients were added in front of us and dang delicious. Still my favorite guac in all of SA.Moving onto some of the other things I've tried include the \"Crack Burger\" as so many yelpers have named it. This one lived up to the hype and was not only unique in texture (firmness of beef), but more importantly the often overlooked accompaniments made a world of a difference. The cheese has a distinct delicious modest flavor that compliments the beefy command of the meat flavor. The spicy tomato aioli is delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I ever ate here that was not worth the money were the crab cakes. The amount of crab in them was laughable and the price did not reflect this miniscule amount.Service is usually great but I have had my fair share of hiccups, such as one waiter forgetting about one of our entrees, lying about forgetting to put in that order which we know he did, then having the nerve to deliver it still AFTER we had finished everything else and we no longer wanted it. But I digress. The courtyard is beautiful especially in the fall and I'd highly recommend it for date night. The ambience is very nice and gives you the chance to get cozy with your main squeeze. The wine selection is very good as expected and presentation of all dishes is among some of my favorite places in town.In other words, this is NOT a place you come just for the grub, you'd want to drop in for the entire experience.

I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Salad in general was fairly standard but the chicken is what really made it stand out. Was very flavorful and tender.

The orange vinaigrette was decent; I only used half of what they gave to me on the side. I was pretty happy with the salad. I found myself trying to avoid eating the onions out of fear of what fried onions could do to my health, but I ended up eating every last bite of the salad. I also ordered the portobello patty melt (which is misspelled portabello on Zinc's menu, though portobello comes up as a misspelled word in Word because Word wants me to capitalize it...), which came grilled, topped with swiss cheese, sitting on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach. It's kind of a misnomer, or I'm kind of dense: I imagined this dish served on bread, but when it wasn't, I didn't mind. The plate also came with sweet potato fries. The portobello and swiss was very tasty. The spinach was kind of bitter, and there was actually supposed to be asparagus underneath the portobello, but pieces were few and far between. Also, there were some olives on this plate that were super strong in flavor, and their juices flowed to the rest of my plate, making some bits very surprising. I definitely got to the part of the meal where I was forcing myself to eat the spinach out of fear of what not eating the spinach would do to my health. The sweet potato fries were the best sweet potato fries I've had in a long time. They were crispy, but soft inside. I didn't need ketchup, or any kind of dipping sauce. They were that good.The service was slow. I found myself toasting with my colleagues with an empty glass of water. The food also came out very slowly. I think the entire meal took two hours, which is fine, but most of us had more things to do later that night and were somewhat waiting on the staff. They actually offer \"Boudro's\" table side guac. Boudro is a nearby \"Texan\" restaurant that apparently pioneered making guacamole on demand, with a hint of citrus. Our table ordered a big bowl to share.I'd return if I were in the area and wanted something reliable, like those sweet potato fries, to munch on. I'd probably go to Boudro's for the guac.

Second night we asked to sit on the patio, and had a short wait at an inside table, no drinks offered while waiting. Once seated outside, which is the place to be, it sprinkled a little, which sent another table running inside for cover. They were seated in a back room, where the man repeatedly hit the too-low chandelier over the table with his head whenever he got up. Service was much slower this night. Dirty martinis were very good. Got the escargot appetizer, which was solid. Waiter recommended the short-rib ciabatta sandwich with warm potato salad over the lamb pappardelle, and she was spot-on.

I find that it leans on the heavier side in terms of flavor, but still delicious!This will be my go to spot if I want a solid meal in downtown SA!"], ["Tyrell E.", "To start off I was surprised to have found a place like this in Texas. With the secluded patio area that had tall brick buildings surrounding you, it felt as though we were dinning back at a fine ding restaurant in Philadelphia. Very urban chique.As for the service, we were very well taken care of by a young man who was an obvious professional and knew everything their was to know about the menu. In general all the members seemed to be respectable. Now for the food. We started off burdening the table side guacamole. It was by far top 5 worthy int the dip category although I have had better elsewhere. Next was the main course in which I had a ancho chile encrusted short rib sandwich with warm potato salad while my wife had a shrimp po boy. All I can say about my main dish was that it was the second best sandwich I have ever had and by far the best warm potato salad I ever had. The sandwich had the perfect merry of sweet, savory, and bitter favors that came together to provide a disgustingly amazing flavor!!! Also the the bread held the drippings from the cloud like meat and proved to complete \u00a0the complete the sandwich as a whole. The salad was very lite for being made with potatoes , yet savory enough to remind you of the salad your mother made on forth of July when you were a kid. Up to that point the experience was amazing.Here's were the food experience went down hill. We decided to go with our favorite desert which is creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and ordered the pumpkin version that was offered. While the desert wasn't particularly bad, it was not on the same level as the rest of the meal. It felt like on Christmas when your parents got you all the gifts you wanted but did get you batteries:( \u00a0Lastly the price was very reasonable for the food you receive. Altogether this place was awesome and deserves five stars but gets one markdown because of the dessert."], ["Ines M.", "I came here one night I was hungry, dining alone and looking forward to the light and music show at San Fernando's Cathedral so I came here for take-out and it was AMAZING!! I loved their sweet potato fries and their lamb burger with carmelized onions. I ate it in front of the cathedral while waiting for the show to start and it was perfect. The ambience inside the restaurant while I waited for my order was loud and busy. I was glad to be just picking up and going. It was pretty tight getting in and out. I would definitely come back and recommend it though."], ["Morgan R.", "This gastropub is popular with locals, and is both informal and sophisticated. \u00a0The night I was there there were people in tuxedos and evening gowns, and others in jeans, and it all worked well together.The food is really good. \u00a0While it is associated with Boudro's on the Riverwalk, it is just far enough removed from the riverwalk to avoid being a tourist destination. \u00a0The night I was there, I was one of the few tourists among a throng of locals.I started with a bloody Mary, which came loaded with veggies (pepperoncini, pickled onions, pickled green beans, lime and olive), and it was very tasty and had the right amount of spice. \u00a0I followed the drink with the Gulf Blue Crabcakes, identified as a big plate. \u00a0The crab cakes were absolutely delicious, but to me it was more like a large appetizer (or a tapas) portion, than a main course. \u00a0Next the Texas lamb pappardelle - essentially wide noodles (like spaghetti in flavor) with meat sauce based using ground lamb (essentially a sophisticated spaghetti Bolognese). \u00a0It was tasty, though not as exotic as expected - the lamb really didn't shine through - but that was OK, the dish was still very good. \u00a0The garlic bread that accompanied it was really good. \u00a0Finally, the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e had a nice crust to it, though the custard inside was a little more runny than I would like.But I'm picking nits with my observations. \u00a0The food was really good. \u00a0The atmosphere was pleasant. \u00a0For a place located so close to a tourist trap (the Riverwalk), it was an excellent non-touristy restaurant. \u00a0And the prices were pretty reasonable for the quality.One comment to management: Over the course of the 90-minutes I was there, I was waited on by 5 or 6 different wait people, and while there was some loose coordination, this structure led to discontinuities in service ... they did OK, but the left hand didn't always know what the right was up to. \u00a0Again, a minor complaint at a good restaurant."], ["Lisa D.", "The menu is mouth watering!

Jessica made an excellent recommendation as an alternative to the steak which was the lamb and pasta. \u00a0It was delicious by the way.

It's located just around the corner from The Westin, not overly crowded (granted it's a Monday night) with indoor and outdoor seating options. I guess they're known for the prickly pear but I'm not a big fan of blended alcohol drinks so I opted for the partida (sp?)it was just a typical margarita, nothing special. I ordered the zinc salad which was only $3 but a pretty large portion...great value for your money and it was good too. I liked the cheese and nuts in the salad. The crab cakes are a must. There were clumps of real crab meat and it was perfectly crusted plated in this really rich sauce. There was also this small mound of micro greens that had a citrusy dressing. I topped the cake with the micro greens, swirled it in the sauce and it was amazing!! This plate was a bit on the smaller side and so if you're hungry, this would not be enough! Service was pretty good. Our server even split out check five ways for us and didn't make a stink about it, which I thought was cool (just as a general comment, many servers usually give you the stink eye when you want to split a check). Several others at our table ordered dessert, but I didn't indulge so can't review the sweet treats but they did look very tempting!"], ["Deniz V.", "On a recent visit to San Antonio we were looking for a place to eat near the Alamo and Riverwalk that wasn't so touristy and that had decent food. \u00a0This place had promising reviews and it definitely didn't let me down.I ordered a prickly pear margarita which looked and tasted great with a chili salt rim. \u00a0We shared the table side guacamole which was also delicious, and fresh, and for my meal I got the lamb burger with serrano fig jam, brie, rocket, grilled onions and sambal mayo with some deliciously seasoned and crispy sweet potato fries. \u00a0The burger was incredibly juicy, a bit greasy and messy, but most importantly it was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Very tasty soft, and buttery bun with great flavor. \u00a0Definitely highly recommended.The setting on the back patio is also quite nice and peaceful and its located just a couple minutes from the Riverwalk.Worth a visit!"], ["Connor M.", "I grew up in SA and was in town for my birthday. I was looking for three things: a good downtown location somewhat near the riverwalk, good food, and even better drinks. This place had two of the three. While the service was spectacular and the drink selection/quality left nothing to be desired, the food was nothing more than alright. I started out with a mojito, which was great. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer hoping they would taste anything like the ones at Hopdoddy in Austin, and they definitely didn't. My entree was probably the best on the table, and while I didn't mind it, there really wasn't anything too exciting about some grilled shrimp with mushrooms on a couple skewers over rice. This restaurant is the place to go if you're looking for drinks at an upscale American atmosphere in downtown SA. The two glasses of wine and the mojito I had were outstanding and the outdoor patio in the back was nice. That said, my parents and I joked that we'd hit Whataburger across the street right before we came back here the next time."], ["Jonathan L.", "Walking distance from the River Walk, this is definitely a chill place to hangout with friends. We opted to dine in their cozy courtyard--the weather was particularly nice that day. They lived up to their name on the \"wine bar\" front. There were several pages of wines and cocktails they offered. Our server seemed unprepared when we asked him for his opinion on what would match with the faux gras and spicy spinach artichoke au gratin order we made. I was hesitant at first in agreeing with his recommendation but after the first sip, I was glad we made that order as the pairing was superb--you can't go wrong with the 2013 Nora Albarino--a little fruitier and lighter than typical white wines I've tried in the past. We particularly enjoyed their faux grax--although the pistachios didn't give any additional depth in flavor for the pate, it did give it a nice consistency. As for our main entrees, we thoroughly enjoyed our Texas Lamb Pappardelle and Churrascos of Grilled Shrimp plate. We also heard that their burgers were good choices as well. Their Brioche Apple Bread Pudding Souffle ended our experience on a near perfect note. Prices were reasonable for the quality--around 35 dollars per person for wine, two appetizers, three entrees, and desert (3 people total)."], ["Chris S.", "A nice place for a glass of wine and light meal. The selection by the glass is large and covers a wide range at reasonable prices. The salad was excellent and the pizza was outstanding. \u00a0Really, really good! Service was friendly and attentive.

I'm not a \"foodie\" (I like a good meal as much as the next person, but in the end I'm an \"eat to live person\") but when I took the first bite of the short rib, I said to my husband, \"This short rib is better than sex.\" Yes, it was THAT good so if you eat meat, definitely get the short rib sandwich. I almost ordered it without the bread but I'm glad I didn't because it was so warm and soft, like fresh bread. I also liked the potato salad because of the twist to a familiar favorite - it's slightly warm. My only criticism is that the sandwich's sauce (aioli?) had a little too much salt. My husband thought his sausage pizza was a little too salty, too. \u00a0I tried the bread pudding and although not as amazing as the short rib, it was really, really good.

I ordered a salad, which was not only delicious, but presented beautifully. The outside area also has blanket/poncho things that guests can wear if it gets cold.

Tequila-cured salmon, pepitas, arugula, dried corn and cheese were outstanding, fresh and tasty, only topped by the mouthwatering basil-pesto dressing.The portion is a good size, but it left me a little hungry, so I ordered another salad for $3 (I asked if that was a typo, it is not!). The zinc salad had mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and fried onions and was also very good. Did I mention it's only $3???

I ordered the Italian sausage pizza and the only thing I loved were the kalamata olives, the rest was bland and boring. The dough, sauce, and choice of cheese used lacked flare and didn't travel well, no one at home touched those leftovers. The calamari was tacky and became soggy fast, this was sent back. The truffle fries had a great flavor but pretty greasy. I liked their spicy spinach artichoke dip more than anything, try it! Finally, the Gulf Blue crabcake tasted on the frozen side, nothing special there. Service was lovely and our glasses were never empty.

I've tried the Zinc Burger, Portabello Mushroom Melt, Devil's River Lamb Burger, and Shrimp and Crawfish beignets. They were all delicious! The Sangria and Prickly Pear Margaritas were also good and complemented the meals well. My absolute favorite dish was the Shrimp and Crawfish Beignets that were served during Restaurant Week.

But I know deep down you are a solid five for what you are! First time I came here with two companions for a drink at the bar. We sat there for more than 10 mins but nobody bothered to greet us and bring us a menu. And no it wasn't packed at all. So without being acknowledged, we left unhappily and went to another martini bar downtown. We sworn that we'd all rate Zinc a one star. I'm glad I didn't and gave this place a second chance. A friend of mine and I decided to go all out for 4th of July. So we were gonna do a nice dinner then go watch the fireworks. After calling around, we decided to come to Zinc because of its proximity to Hemisphere park. Reservation was easy to make. The lady on the phone seemed nice and accommodating when I called to tell her that we were going to be late for our dinner. We came at 6:30pm and were sited at the main dining room promptly. I didn't know they had this big dining area at the back b/c I had only seen the bar before. Decors were modern and easy on the eyes, nice! I ordered a glass of Moscato as always, then started off with escargot for appetizer and lamb pappardelle for entree. I have to say the escargot was absolutely delicious! The lamb pappardelle was divine! It was slow cooked in red wine with onions, garlic, mushrooms and zucchini, hmmm! My meal was everything I was looking for at that moment if not more. I was deff happy! It seemed like my friend quite enjoyed her meal as well. The best part is? The price! The lamb is only $14! Unbelievable! My total bill was a little over $30 plus tips! Seriously? Usually an entree would cost this much at a quality restaurant. For the stellar food, ambiance and dining experience, Zinc is certainly a steal! After the meal, we went outside and sat at their courtyard. It was such a romanic little outdoor space with water fountain, trees, lush plants, etc. I totally dig it! I'd sit here all night with a glass of moscato or champion if I could. What a pleasant surprise! I heard they are sister restaurant of Boudro's which is another fine establishment on the River. But Zinc deff offers much better prices AND I heard they have happy hours for even better deals! Now I'm so intrigued. MUST. VISIT. SOON!!!"], ["Charles G.", "Rarely do I find a restaurant that justifies the inevitably parking fiasco and expense associated with dining downtown on a Saturday evening; Zinc, however, is the exception. Pitched as a bistro and wine bar with a patio seating that reminds of an old Spanish neighborhood's shared courtyard, the brilliance of Zinc's dining experience is quite simply quality ingredients masterfully blended into a successfully creative plate that doesn't bust the budget. \u00a0The atmosphere is a sleekly blended pairing of upscale and relax while undoubtedly hip; kind of like that uncle who is older than your parents but has the latest gadgets, knows all the cool places and somehow still dresses better than you. As if one were hanging out with that uncle, with the first step into the narrow but surprisingly open entryway lined with magnum wine bottles, you know this is going to be great experience. \u00a0Entr\u00e9e prices are mostly under $15 and we're not talking about the chicken breast and rice pilaf; these were main dishes. We enjoyed the beautifully crafted Texas Chopped Salad that turned out to be so much more than expected (don't have them toss your salad- the presentation is a thing of beauty). A hint of tequila lingered on the sushi-grade salmon's marvelously cured salty flesh, each bite encored with a delayed release from the succulent mix of basil pesto dressing and dill fragrance. It was an extraordinarily balanced bite touched with an exciting, yes exciting, sweet crunch added from the dried corn. The Devil's River Lamb Burger is a small but weighty round packed with more tasty sensations than its size should permit. The onion's sweetness added a slightly grilled crispness to the already perfected match of imbedded apricot and brie. The resulting blend was exceptionally flavorsome. The accompanying sweet potato fries were nearly as thin as string fries but hidden among the salty crunch, I was pleasantly surprised to feel the mouth watering spice of a chili-lime flavoring.A diverse wine lists provided a number of quality options at varying price points. To match the salad and burger we chose an Australian Chook Shiraz-Viognier; which brought together a deep earthy blend from the red grapes and a faint touch of crispness from the white; an excellent pairing if one will tolerate a moment to gloat. Zinc's chef Manny, (also of the joint restaurant, Boudro's) has excelled my appreciation for downtown dining and convinced me that some places are certainly well worth the effort."], ["Amanda A.", "They were ok.

What I mean is, you take 5 steps down the Riverwalk and you realize that 99% of those places are tourist traps with crappy food, overpriced drinks, and trinkets that only your grandmother could appreciate. Take 5 steps off of the Riverwalk, though, and you can be pleasantly surprised if you know where you're going. Zinc Bistro is one of those restaurants that proves to be a surprise. The food is outstanding, the atmosphere is very \"old world\" almost European (especially on the patio), the drinks are strong and the service is excellent. They have cigars here that you can smoke on their patio. Prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food and the location.

We even had to ask her for the desert menu, she wanted to give us the bill before we were even done with our entrees (which was met with a heavy sigh).

Tables are straight down the wall, so you end up sitting cheek-to-jowl with your neighbor, which makes for a somewhat stilted atmosphere. I kept worrying that the gentleman at the next table could hear every word I was saying and it made me self-conscious.The owner is friendly, however, and let us try a wine she had recommended before we ordered a bottle. Her husband and daughter are the chef and sous chef. They have been in San Antonio for about three years. We asked why there was no beef on the menu and she explained that they were trying to set themselves apart from every other French restaurant. I could tell my husband was disappointed as he adores steak frites!My husband's escargots arrived on tiny spoonfuls of mashed potato and there was no sauce, little garlic and no shells. In one regard that is great, as you can fully taste the escargots as they are meant to be savored, but on the other hand he was not quite expecting such a minimal presentation. I had a very good foie gras terrine but the quince paste was flavorless. Typical French cuisine of the past has included heavy sauces and extravagant garnishes. Saveurs 209 has scaled this back drastically but in my opinion they have taken it too far. Our entrees, coquilles St. Jacques and monkfish, were, quite simply, boring. There was not a scintilla of sauce on my scallops. They had been cooked with beets (delicious) but a little sauce - any sauce! - would have been welcome. When I go out for French cuisine I do expect a little more than naked scallops.My tarte au pommes was quite good but not great. All in all, we will probably not go back. Quel dommage! There are many other fabulous restaurants in San Antonio that are way more exciting and convivial.

The decor and atmosphere is modern and fun. There were some issues with the price of our dinner--they gave us the wrong menu so they charged us $34 for the hanger steak when our menu said $17. They were apologetic about it and corrected our bill.

Great, now I get to eat my lunch in a rush before class starts. \u00a0 Thanks la Madeline!"], ["Duncan M.", "Love the Soups and love the grilled sandwiches......and of course the Sacher Torte.....not as good as the original but then again who would be?......some would call it over priced for what it is....but not too bad and sometimes it does surpass itself...."], ["Michelle H.", "I love La Madeleine, but not this particular location. \u00a0I always order the Duet Magnifique (your choice of a hot/cold sandwich, chips, pasta, or salad...with soup). \u00a0My regular would be the chicken salad croissant, but today decided to try something new and ordered the french dip. \u00a0Let's just say I like the Arby's french dip better. \u00a0 The pasta was old and mushy. \u00a0I normally finish it, but only took a few bites of it today. \u00a0The potato soup (with shredded cheese & bacon) is normally pretty good. \u00a0Before leaving, I got a mini fruit tart for dessert. \u00a0It was old and shriveled---if you can picture that. \u00a0The egg part of tasted dried up---don't know how long it's been sitting out. \u00a0Strange, it was lunch time...shouldn't things be fresher?????"], ["Delia M.", "Food is great. One star is for service. Took twenty minutes to pour soup into a bowl for a take out order. \u00a0They somehow lost my order. Girl was nice, but I left very aggravated."], ["Justin C.", "Good soups and great environment to eat in when its cold you can sit by the fire place"], ["Nasreen L.", "I come to this location because of its close proximity to my apartment, only a minute or so drive. Not the best location, but not the worst. I almost always just get the petite caeser salad (the dressing is FANTASTIC, and they sell it in stores too!) and a cup of one of their soups, all which are delicious. My fave is the tomato basil. The last time I went in, though, they barely gave me anything on the salad plate. The amount of salad barely covered the bottom of the plate. For 3.99 I expected a little bit more than just a bunny salad! So that was disappointing - but otherwise, I like this location. Try the tomato basil pasta! Very tasty!"], ["Josh N.", "A very pleasant staff, a cozy dining area, excellent food. \u00a0I had their quiche which was amazing. \u00a0A chocolate tort afterwards that was out of this world. \u00a0The french onion soup was quite good as well. \u00a0That being said, I'm happy with any place that has that lightly carbonated orange juice called Orangina(sic)."], ["Bethany R.", "Excellent service for a baby shower!! The manager John was incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond."], ["Donna V.", "I really don't know what to say..I wanted to like it here. There was a long line so many seemed to enjoy it. Went here today around noon after my massage at the local massage school. I asked for recommendations since it was my first time there, and they me they are known for their tomato basil soup, mocha frappe, a monte cristo-type sammich and their mango tea. Well, ok...When in Rome...I got the duet selection which included a cup of soup, a half sandwich, chips. I also went for both drinks. The soup was ok, but tasted, I dunno, \"off\" or something. Chips? Pass on them. Totally forgettable. Sandwich was ok. Mango tea? Bland, tasteless, gross. I tried the Frappe but I guess it just didn't mesh well with my lunch because about halfway thru, I started to feel really sick to my stomach and decided to leave. Luckily I live about 10 min away cuz as soon as I saw the Nacogdoches exit, I pulled over and got ill. Now I'm laying in bed miserable on my day off. Lots of ppl seemed to enjoy it. But alas, I was not one of them today."], ["Fawn G.", "This is a chain around town, but that's OK. It's FRENCH! OK, not a great reason. For the record I don't know how the I-10 Huebner location stays open. That place is a dump and has dumpy ugly decayed plants in their patio. Get rid of them! With that being said, I-10 Huebner can learn a lot from 410 Blanco. This is by far one of my favorite places in the area to come for breakfast. It's affordable (without the bells and whistles) and its delicious. Their French roast coffee is like dessert! My daughter loves their egg croissant sandwich. When most places are jam packed with hungry breakfast patrons, this place is empty. I guess no one has caught on to it's deliciousness yet. This is a big win for me. A lot of people don't like the \"tray, pay, receive food once seated\" thing. I don't mind it. I like getting unlimited coffee and tea and water and bread and jam and stuff.... It's good times."], ["Kane T.", "French architecture in a shopping center?! Oh dear. Ceasar salad is eatable, tomato soup is sippable, and the sandwiches are all right."], ["Michael R.", "This Dallas-based French bakery and cafe has been providing me with fresh bread and tasty lunches ever since the early 90's when I first discovered them. My decade in LA left me Madeleine-less while I was there, but I was glad to see that they were also in San Antonio when I moved here back in the winter. My daughter and I decided to lunch there this afternoon, and it was as good as I remeber it being. We both had the sandwich combo special, except I got the croque monsiuer and she the chicken Parisianne. We both opted for the Caesar salad and their wonderful tomato basil soup. Everything was wondeful! La Madeleine has always come the closest to the croque monsuirs that I had in France. and though the combo gives you a half of one it's a substantial half. Flanked with the other two offerings it becomes a very satisfying meal. This location had a wonderful pasty display featuring all of their wonderful pastries and fresh breads. when i came in I considered ordering a dessert, but after I ate I realized that I didn't have the room for it. I can't wait to take my wife here, she'll love it!"], ["Hernan R.", "This place's great food, staff friendliness, and wonderful atmosphere, makes it a perfect experience."], ["Elisabel B.", "We got a to go order around lunch time, the croutons on the salad were soggy the bread on the sandwich was soggy.

The staff was friendly but I'm not there to make friends. :o"], ["Alazia P.", "Had lunch here today for a baby shower and was amazed by the staff. They were so helpful and even offered to help carry items out to vehicles. The food was fresh and delicious. The guests couldn't stop raving about the pasta salad! \u00a0I will now pass my usual la Madeleine and drive to this location simply because of the staff!!! \u00a0I will most definitely use them again as a venue for a meeting or event!!!"], ["Marisa P.", "The other day I was sick and just wanted a soup and salad to take home. \u00a0When I walked in the line for to-go was really long, but I figured they would keep it moving. \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0Two ladies in front of me had been waiting for 15 minutes, but then a woman with a large to-go order walked in and just stepped right up to the front. \u00a0They started helping her, so people in the to-go line started to leave. \u00a0The manager came over and tried to start helping the situation, but by then it was a clustercuss. \u00a0I should have just left, but by this point I had invested too much time and just wanted food. \u00a0When I got home my salad was a miniscule portion that I finished in about three bites(not anywhere near the dine-in portion), the potato soup had no cheese or bacon sides, and the dessert I ordered was wrong. \u00a0I will stick with the La Mad in Huebner Oaks."], ["Hope C.", "I am a pretty big fan of La Madeleine...from Fort Worth to San Antonio and every one in between. \u00a0However, this particular location left a bad taste in my mouth. \u00a0Stopped by to grab a Take-Out breakfast on my way to work. \u00a0Strawberries Romaloff...yummers! \u00a0Well, got to the office, opened the container, and was totally dissappointed. \u00a0The strawberries were old and slimey and the sauce had a \"spoiled\" smell to it. \u00a0Immediately called the bakery and spoke to the manager. \u00a0Was told to bring it back and he would replace it. \u00a0Well, couldnt leave the office right then, so took it back during my lunch hour. \u00a0Received a replacement and an apology from the manager. \u00a0I suggested that perhaps they should check their \"pre-made\" and \"ready-to-go\" items more frequently to prevent this type of experience happening to anyone else."], ["Erica M.", "I didn't expect a greeting when I walked in, so I wasn't surprised that I didn't get one.I cleary told the server behind the counter I wanted 2 plates of chicken bowties, one for me and the other for my son. So we go sit down and I was brought only 1 bowl. Confused, I asked the waitress what happened to my other bowl and she told me I only paid for 1 bowl. Wow, I did? I clearly remember telling the server 2 bowls. So after 2 minutes she kindly sends over the 2nd bowl, I paid for it only half price, she told me she was going to just charge me half for it, aw how nice...so lemme get this strait, I have to pay for your employees mistake......really? \u00a0*gag*.After sitting for a few minutes and eating, I started to wonder if the entire restaurant crew and everyone had left since it was so quiet and we were never approached if we needed anything...The serving size of the bowties was skimpy and my potato galette was a bit over-cooked.I will never go there again."], ["Priscilla R.", "Coming back from a trip out of town, I expect a sweet treat and good food at La Madeleine, having wonderful experiences at separate locations of the chain. Such luck was not found.We park, come in, and were not greeted at all. No one showed us a seat or told us how to order. So we sat down, got our own menus, and waited for service. None arrived, save part of the cleaning staff, who gave great advice and mentioned a server would arrive shortly. No one ever did.Five minutes pass and, fed up, one of our party goes to ask the cashier directly if we order straight from there, only to be told curtly to wait and a server would be right with us. Two more couples come into the restaurant, are all greeted warmly, sent to their seats and served. We wait.Five more minutes pass and we go up again to ask, seeing as there are two other servers talking to one another next to the cashier. Again, we're told to wait. As of now, three dining parties are eating and we still haven't been served.We waited fifteen minutes and decided to leave. Come only if you expect to be served after a good long while: bad service."], ["G P.", "Fabulous soy latte served in a giant cup. I also love the tomatio bisque soup.....muy delicioso!"], ["Hecate F.", "My conversation with this restaurant goes a little like this:La Madeleine:\u00eates vous affam\u00e9?Hecate:\"J'ais faim\"!!!3 years of French in HS has it's advantages :) I love this little bakery. What I love most about it is that this location has popped up near my job. Every location I've gone to not only offers a friendly staff across the board but food quality that other chain restaurants lack! I start my voyage through France with their Mushroom Soup or Tomato Basil Soup. Cup? Bowl - s'il vous pla\u00eet! As for entrees there are two French Specialties that keep me coming back: Chicken Friand (Puff pastry filled with chicken, mushrooms and B\u00e9chamel sauce, topped with mushroom sauce.-$5.99 (seriously!) \u00a0Or I go with Croque Monsieur (Baked French Ham Sandwich with garlic cream sauce \u00a0and Swiss)-$7.99. Order a side of their Pesto Pasta and you will wish it was endless. Wash it down with their refreshing Mango Tea.Leave some room for dessert, any tart is creamy and delish. Try their mini-size if you feel guilty after splurging on lunch. Pair it with a Doppio or just plain Coffee. Be sure to take a loaf of fresh baked bread with you."], ["Roxanne F.", "Let's start with the ghetto bitch in her escalade in the parking lot staring me down as I arrived and then entered the establishment, not entirely the restaurants fault but who knows how long she's been there staring at people.Secondly, they've apparently taken the chicken cordon bleu off the menu. Add to this that every time I come to a location of this restaurant something goes wrong. The cook in the kitchen was about 12.I ordered chicken de madeline. Chicken was dry but there was enough mushroom sauce to make it more edible. Te potato gallette was burned on the underside and the steamed broccoli was completely unseasoned.Then there was the small gnat all over our table and a discarded mushroom that had been on the floor for who knows how long. The french onion soup was very good, of course. As was the caesar salad. I shoulda gone to chili's."], ["Blaine J.", "Sometimes this location is really nice, sometimes the employees are strange. This time, the employees were wonderful and very helpful. Restaurant was clean and pleasant. I got Chicken La Madeleine and it was good, the rice on the side was a little under done."], ["Linda L.", "What has happened to the croissants at La Madeleine! \u00a0They are like Wonder bread in the shape of a croissant! Real French croissants are buttery, flakey, crisp, melt-in-your mouth delights. \u00a0We'll be going to the CIA bakery for our croissants from now on when we are in San Antonio."]]}
