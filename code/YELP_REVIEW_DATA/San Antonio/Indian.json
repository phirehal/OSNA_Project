Bawarchi is chain of restaurants and i always go to Bawarchi in Houston which is really good place. But this Bawarchi ... needs a COOK to COOK real indian stuff. I had ordered Chicken 65 and it was just chicken nuggets ... i could have got those in McDonalds as well. One thing was good that when we complained the staff took my complaint positively and tried to make other one which could satisfy me. Appreciate the staff's effort. But what they need is real good cook .Also, This place needs cleanliness ... there where flies bugs flying around ... that was big step down for me to again visit the same place."], ["Jeremy G.", "I love Indian food! In my opinion, the typical Indian buffets get old after awhile. I was very glad to find an a la carte place like this. I've been here several times and have had the Chicken Biryani, dosas, shrimp curry, and chole bhature. Everything is spicy and flavorful. Chole bhature is one of my all time favorites. I typically frown upon dishes that are vegetarian, but I make exceptions for this dish. Fried bread dipped in spicy garbanzo bean curry...mmmmm. The next time I come back I want to try the Goat Biryani!"], ["K B.", "This is my favorite place for Indian food in San Antonio. I know it's a chain, but it's level of spices and flavor far surpass any other Indian joint around (and I have tried A LOT of Indian restaurants). I was amazed at how good biryani rice could taste and after trying theirs the buffets in town do not compare. The food is excellent. The service is rather poor. Literally have to seat yourself, about 1/2 of the time I have to grab my own menu and go up to the cash register to order. I also have to frequently flag the waiter down for more water. But the flavor of the food totally makes up for the sucky service.Give it a try. You won't regret it! And will probably be hooked..."], ["Christine T.", "This was my first time eating at bawarchi and the food was very flavorful. I ordered the palak paneer and tried some of my friend's shrimp masala (btw spicy is verryy spicy.. I might go with mild if I ever ordered it). I thought the paneer was great, not spicy at all, and the spinach sauce was tasty. The garlic naan was perfect, portions were decent and overall very affordable plates. I thought it was a little strange that water jugs were left out at each table, not sure how long it has been sitting out. The place is a little hard to find, in a corner of a shopping center, but there is plenty of seating inside the restaurant. I would be back again, would like to try their Gobi manchurian and biryani."], ["H B.", "bummed they fell into the same routine as so many other desi-restaurants in town.. Quality and cleanliness have gone way way down. \u00a0Cant justify my original ratings anymore."], ["Melissa M.", "The flavors here more authentic than other Indian places in San Antonio. I enjoyed the pungent flavors and the bold use of indian spices here. The food is actually spicy here unlike some places in San Antonio. However some things still need to be fixed here. My fianc\u00e9 and I order the the chicken mahkani (butter chicken) and chicken dum biriyani and the chicken in both dishes weren't the best. The chicken in the curry was a little rubbery and the the chicken in the biriyani had an unproportional amount of spice infused into it compared to the rice. The chicken in the biriyani could have also been cooked better as it was a bit dry. The bone was a bit of a pain, so I may try either one of the biriyani dishes without meat or one with boneless chicken. The biriyani rice itself is very good and is nothing like I've ever tasted. It's very flavorful and the yogurt sauce and chutney that comes with it is great compliment to put on top of the rice if you want to cool it down a bit. The naan here is also pretty solid. The prices are pretty standard for what I've paid for Indian food. The ambiance here is a negative. The place seems kind of dirty and the lights are dim. The service isn't that great either. Overall, I'll probably be back for take out to pick up some biriyani rice. The portion is pretty huge and I can make at least 3 meals out of it."], ["Marissa G.", "This place is pretty hidden but worth finding.

Now I have no problem with heat, actually prefer it. But it was over bearing and oily. The samosas were decent. Also ordered the dosa that was burnt. Raita was too watery. The desert was good though."], ["Praveen S.", "Very bad experience. What ever we ordered were not at all tasty and good. They are cheating customers.Will not recommend to any one."], ["Nik D.", "Stay away if you want to avoid oily food. Otherwise an average food experience.

When I first ate here I was blown away by the flavors. It reminded me of the month I spent in India. This place can easily have the best tasting Indian food in town. I give it three stars because of their consistency. There have been times when I ordered their briyani and it was flavorless or a masala dosa and they bring out the massive crepe with only a spoonful of filling (wtf is up with that?). I also don't understand why they serve samosa and certain foods after 4pm only. Even then there has been about 4-5 times I've tried to order an appetizer (like a samosa) and am told they don't have any. At one point I told the waiter that they should remove pungulu from the menu since they never seen to have it. They have improved a lot on their customer service since I first stated eating here. Before you had to get your own menus and order at the counter. Now they bring the menus when you sit down and come to you to take your order, but still you need to go to the counter to get your check and pay. I will say this, they have the most amazing coconut chutney ever!!!! I recommend if you're a beginner to Indian food to try the masala dosa. If you're feeling feisty go for the keema aloo mutter. Their ground goat is just so good!"], ["Akshay S.", "Typical Indian restaurant with overrated charges.Rather visit nearby McDonald."], ["Joseph S.", "I was here twice with friends and coworkers. This place is probably the closest authentic Indian restaurant that is non-buffet I have been to. Their Biryani are just delicious, both the Chicken and Kheema, they are full of flavor.

Being from Chennai, I love their food. I have never eaten a better Egg Dosa anywhere in Chennai. They even ask you if you want your dosas soft and crunchy, which I really appreciate (since I like my dosa soft). My parents visiting us from Chennai also were in love with this restaurant, though my mom didn't care too much for the curd rice she ate here. My dad loves their Mysore Masala Dosa and their egg dosa. Their vegetable biryani (I'm a vegetarian) was also great and plentiful. I love their sambhar that is an accompaniment to their dosas and idlis. I do join some of the other yelpers on their gripe that some items are not available most of the time and are not clearly indicated in their menu.

Food is authentic and good in general. Service is late, when you order 2 or more dishes they don't bring them all at once, there is a 5 min gap in between dishes."], ["Ubaid U.", "Went here on a Saturday night and saw that there was a lot of activity - always a good sign. Noticed too that most, if not all, of the clientele were South Asian. I generally figure that that's a testimony to a restaurant's authenticity. In any event, the ambience was definitely casual. No problems parking, so solid there. Walk in, go to the counter and order your food, pretty simple. There are two menu viewing options - they have the paper carryout menus just as you walk in, or you can view the big menu above the counter. Order, pay, take a number, have a seat. Seat options are limited to several tables and only a few booths. There are three large TVs parked in the corners of the restaurant that play some variation of Bollywood or other Indian cinema (probably would have preferred a cricket game, but regardless ...) Lighting is kind of random, darker in some spots and brighter in others. The d\u00e9cor is what you'd expect in a casual, cheap Indian/Pakistani place - couple of frames hanging above the booths, and orange and green wall paint (perhaps as a shout-out to the Indian flag, who knows). The one somewhat significant complaint is the bathroom - not terribly clean (at least the male restroom) and the soap dispenser ... whew. My advice - don't press too hard on the soap pump, or you'll get a gallon of pink liquid soap dropped into your hands. Menu options are quite extensive - they have appetizers, South Indian options, vegetarian and non-vegetarian entrees, Chinese options, and of course a diverse biryani menu. They also have a pretty good bread menu and some dessert options. Definitely something for everyone here. The service is good - our food came super fast. Honestly, it was the fastest I've ever gotten my food at any Indian or Pakistani restaurant. Otherwise, they leave you alone and don't check up on you. In fact, after ordering our food and taking our number to our table, we had to get up and grab our own water jugs and bring them to our table. They did bring cups and plates/silverware. Not complaining for the lack of service - the one visit for the plates and food reduces the need to leave any tip. Which brings us to price - everything was decently priced. The biryani we ordered was $9.99, the chana masala (chick peas) were $5.99, and they came with one naan. Price matched our expectations. The food itself was pretty good. The chana masala was not amazing, to be sure. It's a relatively simple dish, and I expect it to be executed almost flawlessly. The chick peas themselves were a little undercooked and over-seasoned with garam masala. They were still pretty good, and the naan that came with it was delicious - warm, fresh and soft. The biryani was quite good. It was a decent enough portion for two average people. The one complaint I have was the lack of chicken. We ordered the Hyderabadi dum chicken biryani, but there were like two pieces of chicken and one egg. I wanted more chicken, because the chicken itself was quite good. It was really tender and fell off the bone with the touch of your fork. The rice was cooked appropriately, and the restaurant appears to use good-quality basmati (long grain) rice. My concern is the spiciness factor - my wife and I eat really spicy food. Had we not read some of the reviews prior to coming to the restaurant, we probably would have ordered \"hot,\" which I believe would have been too much even for my wife to handle. Luckily, we ordered medium, and although it was quite spicy and tasty, it leaves one wondering what happens to the poor souls that wander in thinking they can handle the \"hot\" spicy level. I suppose that could be a point for authenticity. Overall, I'd say the food was quite good for the price, and I definitely see myself becoming a regular here, especially on weeknights. Unfortunately, their hours are kind of early on Mondays through Thursdays, so get there before 9:00 PM, or you'll be out of luck. I recommend trying this place because of its price and expansive menu options. It's probably the only place in town you'll get a decent variety of well-cooked biryani choices."]], "Tarka Indian Kitchen": [["Desiguy D.", "I recently moved from northeast to san antonio, tx.

Why is that? Is there a high concentration of Indian folk in this area? I notice some of the best pho restaurants are in the Northwest area also.Coming from Live Oak, I just won't drive 40 miles to try something new, and that's why I was happy to see this place in Stone Oak, a quick jaunt for me on the 1604. As I entered this large dining room, smells of curry came wafting at me, especially since it was not too cold in there. It was 12:30, and there were only 3 other couples in there, a bit odd in this huge restaurant. In comparison, any large Chinese buffet at 12:30 would have at least 50 people eating. \u00a0 \u00a0The buffet was pretty expansive with many curries (chicken, goat, vegetable), dal soup, chick pea curry, tandoori chicken, a paper thin cracker bread for dipping those curries, and mixed vegetables. I understand what others had said about the lukewarm curries, and I feel it is hard to keep the consistency of curry pipping hot in a steam tray. The dal soup was very hot because its consistency is thinnerI found most of this food to be bland and was not spicy at all, none of it. The dal soup was outstanding, as was the chicken and goat curries and the chicken tikka Marsala. The basmati rice and yellow rice were fresh and perfectly prepared. It made a perfect nest for those curries. \u00a0I feel they dumb down the buffet for us gringos because they think we are afraid of spice. I don't know how representative this place is for Indian food. I hear of places like Briani Pot, where you may have no gringos in there. There were 4 couples in here in Stone Oak, all gringosAs far as the 5 stars, I do not know Indian food-- all I know is this food is tasty, every curry has tons of meat, if you get here right at opening the samosas and egg rolls are excellent, and I like the cold salad bar with the kimchi or Indian kimchi, love the naan, the milk balls, and the free drink with Yelp check in. Yes the dishes could use more spice and only one of the curry sauces is very flavorful. I can't remember which one and I like the chicken tikka Marsala, and the people are super nice, so far me it's a 5.Eats:- tandoori chicken: smoky, flavorful, but dry- goat curry: excellent (goat tastes like the dark meat on turkey)- chicken curry, dal soup (outstanding), naan bread: excellent- mint chutney and tamarind dipping sauce: put this mint on anything- sweetened fried milk balls for desert- samosas were soggy, not crispy. Get there right at opening.Crumbs:- free canned soft drink with Yelp checkin- one dollar off coupon on their webpage- most of the curries were bland and not spicy but tasty- there are a couple of small salads, but this needs to be expanded"], ["Van T.", "Love the buffet options during dinner.

There are lots of options, both vegetarian and non. Everything is pretty good, though not as flavorful as one might expect. That's not to say that it was bland, just not as heavily spiced as I am accustomed. The warm naan they brought to the table was my absolute favorite part of the meal. It was buttered and rubbed with garlic. It was a great touch and elevates something simple into something transcendent. I came at an non-meal time and though there were only 3 or 4 other tables occupied, the buffet was being consistently replenished with fresh food. Service is attentive. My iced tea glass never got below half full. My total for buffet and a drink was a little over $15. This is a little higher than the norm, but I think it was probably because I was eating closer to dinner than to lunch."], ["Meg H.", "What can I say...... On point every time we stop in.

The flavor was very good either way. Also the service was exceptional, although that could have been due to the small crowd. Definitely would go back, maybe to order off the full menu instead.

It was more bone than meat and each entree was a total of one cup of food at best. They didn't even bother to fill their Tupperware bowls. It was no kidding all bone, sauce to fill the gaps, and a couple pieces of meat and the rest was oil. The best kicker was that two entrees (remember the serving size), two pieces of naan paid separately because rice is not included, an order of samosas so greasy the bin it came in had a quarter inch of oil at the bottom, and their spring rolls of which we couldn't even figure out what it was (reminded us of a crepe gone wrong and folded into a burrito to hold in whatever the insides were), all cost 42 bucks and change. The meal might have been worth twenty at best, so suffice to say we feel we got ripped off.

And I mean a knuckle sized piece...I can't say what it's like to eat in, but if you are thinking of the delivery option, don't, at least not until these issues get addressed..however based on other reviews, it does seem the bone to meat ratio complaint is a common denominator regardless of eating in or taking out.

Simply put, Ali Baba's minimalistic, both in food variety and waitstaff service. Naturally this renders the restaurant several aspects shy of a 4-star rating by my standards; however, food quality -- considering the seemingly standard $9.99 lunch buffet price [note that there is NO DINNER BUFFET here!] -- isn't too shabby. Ultimately, India Palace on Fredericksburg Rd offers slightly better dishes (i.e. preparation & presentation)... and Bombay Hall on Wurzbach Rd, still my go-to hands down, offers the best AND the most at THE best price, whether lunch or dinner.Random highlights -- (1) Ali Baba's TANDOORI CHICKEN is notably flavorful among an otherwise pizzazz-less and somewhat unrefined buffet spread; (2) management's happy and personable, checking often on your plate count to gauge your overall satisfaction; (3) Arabic TV is at your disposal... extra points in my book; and (4) the restaurant's Indian music is loud yet relaxing, and once the lights dim at 2 PM, it's easy to fall asleep on an imaginary pillow of buttery naan.Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...- Overall recommendation = 3.25- Food taste and quality = 3 (lacks refinement...)- Portion size = 4.5- Price = 2.5 (Bombay Hall's a FAR better value!)- Atmosphere = 3.25- General service = 3- Waitstaff = 2.75- Location = 4.25"], ["Zohair C.", "Great place for casual lunch :) great chef :) run by a small great family will be here every time we come to San antonio by the way it's 3 hours away from us :) cheers to this family for bringing out fantastic pakistani cuisine :) I tried goat curry , suji halwa , chicken Tikka , and much more"], ["Mrs Nola F.", "Like that this place does delivery (there is a $10 fee attached) and very tasty faire I must say!

I'm just not sure if we had a bad batch of food that day or if everyone else just hasn't experienced really good Indian food before. This stuff was all spice and no flavor. Some of the meat was very rubbery (I'm looking at you, Chicken Curry) and the Beef Haleem was burnt tasting with very bitter notes; also it was not so appetizing to look at, and I know that's nitpicking, but it really did resemble something most foul, though. The Goat Biryani had entirely too many bones. I mean, I would remove the big bones, find some meat, bite it, and spit out three or four little bone shards. It was way too much work for not enough flavor. The side salad they served us was limp and wilted beyond anything I have experienced in the salad department. It looked like it had been sitting out all day in the hot sun. Overall, all of of the entrees were extremely over-salted (and I like me some salt!) and we ended up throwing away most of everything.The absolute biggest letdown, though, had to be the naan. I was craving some seriously yummy naan, and we ordered up for the garlic naan. It was dry and hard as a rock, burnt blackened to the point of being inedible. We were more than disappointed in this place, but burnt naan? Who sends food like this home with people on their first visit?

I told the lady with the gorgeous voice that I can't eat anything too spicy, then after consulting with her I ordered the veg samosa, too. I've had samosas homemade by Pakistanis before, so I wasn't concerned with this order. The samosas were unbearably hot in my mouth. I had to pick out the copious chili seeds. One was so full of seeds that it went to waste. Throwing away otherwise good, savory pastries that someone else told me was safe to order makes me very unhappy. I could've bought something else instead, and the business would've still gotten my money.

I'd bet that 60-70% of my \"meat\" was actually bone! The dinner entrees also don't come with rice which is ridiculous! It'll end up costing you almost $15 for a dinner entree including rice.

There were a lot of bones to work around... and harder to find in the goat curry. I felt like every bite had to be very careful.I'm sure this is probably super authentic.

We asked for the chicken biryani and were promptly informed that it was not available and he can have the goat biryani instead. The food arrived and it was so bland that I couldn't get through half of it. On being asked for extra raita(the yogurt-condiment blend), he pointed to the bit that was left in our bowl. I am not sure if he did not understand the question (I asked repeatedly and was very clear) or he denied us seconds. Anyways, the overall experience was totally contradictory to the previous reviews of the place. My friend s did point out that it was a Monday night and kinda close to their closing time but I refuse to accept that this absolves them.

The naans were a big disappointment. They were in-house (made in their kitchen and not from a mass producing bakery), but dry and crispy. Definitely not freshly made and moist out of the tandoor. Without good naan it was hard to enjoy any of the karahi or nihari. The chicken karahi had way too much whole spices (cloves, bay leaves...) in it. Almost as if someone accidentally dropped half a bottle into it. The beauty of south asian food is in the subtle combination of spices. Overdoing it doesn't help.

Lunch standouts for me are the chicken vindaloo (on the spicy side), chicken curry, saag paneer (love this version), dal (all the varieties) and the naan. The creamy chicken tikka masala is also a favorite of some of my friends. I do wish they used dark meat chicken instead of chicken breasts as occasionally the meat can be a little on the dry side.

He thinks the naan here is too dry, thin and crispy. \u00a0As for the spice level, \u00a0I'm Asian so the spice level is ok but I'll be ok if it was spicier. Everything is a la carte so no rice or roti/naan comes with the curry dishes. In my opinion, I think the dishes should be served with at least a regular serving of steamed plain basmati rice. Also, if you don't like cilantro then make sure you let them know early because there is cilantro in everything. Lastly, the price it average...over price in some and reasonable in others.

This ish was goooood though. The potato filling was green, interestingly enough--not sure what it was cooked with--and the fried outer layer was perfectly crispy and delicious. We were pretty full at this point when they brought out the chole bhatura and the dosa---hooooooooly shit. Two gigantic puffs of fried bread bigger than our heads and the most majestic dosa.... I can't even. The dosa was filled with perfectly golden brown, garlicky potato, peas, and spices and served with sambar, coconut chutney and tomato chutney. The chickpea curry that was served with the bhatura was rich and spicy. It was so much food, and all for a total of about $21.50.

This place has fantastic food! I got the curry chicken, which was promised to be spicy. It was hooot! Loved it! The lunch specials here are quite the deal! It was $6 for a entree, a side, and dessert! Loved it! The side I got was a spicy lentil soup, which was fantastic! For dessert, a yogurt dish to calm the screaming taste buds. The interior of the place is sparsely decorated, but authentic nonetheless. They showed news coming in from Delhi on the TV. Posters of famous cricket players, and Bollywood stars. Swanky! The service was quite friendly. The cashier said that they were filling in for the owner, who was out, and still managed to answer all my numerous questions about the types of food, what spices when into it, etc. The parking here leaves some to be desired. I had to park on the street, as it seems that there are more places where parking is forbidden than places where you can park. I will certainly return. It was fast, delicious, and spicy, just how I like it!"], ["Stefany V.", "I guess I'm the only one here who didn't pay attention to the obvious, but so far no one has mentioned how freaking hot the food here is! I drive past this place a couple of times a week, and decided to pick up some takeout for dinner while watching the game, instead of pizza. Lot has very few spaces and there really isn't anywhere else to park nearby as the streets are busy and narrow. Interior is fairly plain, but there's a tv broadcasting Indian music videos for entertainment, which I liked. There were only a couple of guys there when I went, and from what I've seen they don't seem to get much business anyway. Ordered at the counter with a polite guy then sat to wait for its arrival. Was quoted about 10min, but seemed to come faster than that, and bag included forks and napkins, which I seem obvious but I've had many places forget that stuff before. Downside to this place was how I noticed that even the one customer dining in for his meal was served all of his food in separate styrofoam containers, which is both wasteful and harmful to the environment. In any case, I ordered the samosas chaat, based on reviews I'd read here, and the chicken tikka masala, which I've happily had elsewhere without having issues with the spice level. The appetizer was a little perplexing, topped as it was in heaps of chickpeas (which I enjoy) and a combination of tomatoes, red onion, and cilantro (which was reminiscent of pico de gallo, and totally threw me off), as well as a light sprinkling of what looked like cheese? It wasn't bad, per se, but the crunch of the samosa got soggy quickly and there seemed to be tiny bits of super hot spice (maybe pieces of jalape\u00f1o, in keeping with the pico comparison?) but I could not seem to find what was causing the problem. The chicken tikka, oddly, was served to me cold, which I have never seen before. Cold, cold, like out of a refrigerator because we made it the other day and don't get any orders for it, cold, not like it had sat out... Which may be preferable, but not all who order take out have access to a microwave. Anyway, I ordered the dish with rice and appreciated that it was packed separately so that I could mix the proportions I like and it didn't get soggy. Unfortunately, just a bite or two in, I could tell this dish was simply not going to work for me. It was so far beyond a comfortable spice level, or anything comparable to what I've experienced with this dish elsewhere, that it was difficult to eat and intended up drinking half a glass of milk to dull the throbbing pain in my mouth. Needless to say, the leftovers are in the refrigerator for any of my boyfriend's roommates brave or hungry enough to try it.I am genuinely perplexed by how spicy my food was, even given expectations set by the name of the business, and the lack of commentary about it in other reviews. Maybe someone new was cooking, or the guy who packed up the takeout order added a few shakes of something to my box, but this was borderline in edible despite having good underlying favors.I may try this place again another time, but given the other Indian places in a 2 mile radius, this place need to advertise, come up with a parking solution, and tone down the spice if they want to stick around, IMO."], ["Selena Z.", "This place is not what it used to be.

I visited on a weekday for lunch, and didn't have to wait long for a table for one, even though the restaurant was at capacity.I actually tried almost every vegetarian entree, but won't take the time to review each one. My favorites were definitely the black and yellow lentils and the boiled egg curry. The lentils had this excellent savory flavor, and the boiled egg curry was possibly the best way I've had eggs in the last month. The chana masala was lacking in many ways - too plain, a bit watery, etc. - but I ate a healthy portion anyway. The saag paneer didn't actually have any chunks of paneer in it, but was very creamy. I would actively avoid the broccoli and green bean entrees - they didn't taste good. In the middle of the spectrum - from broccoli to lentils - were the veggie dumplings and the veggie samosas.One of my biggest gripes was that even at 12:45 PM, the middle of the lunch hour, the food was a bit cold, as if there wasn't enough water in the buffet station or something.There was a really diverse crowd there for lunch - all different races, kinds of clothes, etc. There was even a group of 8 white women sitting next to me speaking a European language (I don't know my European languages, so I'm just making an assumption based on skin color, which I do feel bad about).The service was uncoordinated, but nice. For example, because there was no designated host, I was asked by three different employees if I was by myself. Odd, awkward, but not a negative because everyone seemed so eager to seat me as soon as possible. I'd return if I were in the area looking for a solid Indian lunch spot."], ["Mark M.", "Came here for the lunch buffet. The restaurant was clean and fairly spacious. Staff was also very friendly and I was seated right away. They really pay attention to you and fill your water often. Tried just about everything, and for a buffet it was better than expected. The only downside is I felt some plates were less flavorful compared to other restaurants I've been to. However I usually don't mind lighter flavors either. I'm a huge fan of spicy foods, and while all the selections were very mild there was also pretty good vindaloo sauce to add on as needed. Naan was also offered as a buffet item, but once again it didn't have the garlic flavor I usually see on naan. The samosas and dessert were on point though!Overall solid meal, Id definitely come back. 3.5/5"], ["Miriam S.", "Simi's is an old favorite. \u00a0My husband and I visited last week for the first time in a couple of years probably. \u00a0The saag paneer was way better than I remembered - probably the yummiest I have had in town. \u00a0The garlic naan and vegetable pakora were also excellent.

Be it the naan ( Indian bread ), curries or the kheer (deserts), everything was fingerlicking good! Might even consider driving down to San Antonio from Houston for this. ;)Hats off!!"], ["Melissa M.", "I went here for dinner with a few friends recently. I'm not Indian, but I've had some really good Indian food on the west coast and unfortunately I have to compare Simi to that. The Indian food was definitely on the better end of San Antonio Indian food and I would definitely come back here if I'm craving Indian. However there are several things that could be improved on. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, the beef curry, and chicken biyrani. A couple of my friends ordered Mango Lassi's and we also ordered some naan and samosas. Here's the lowdown on the food: Mango Lassi's: pretty tasty, tasted like real mango, good textureBeef curry: meat was really tender, sauce was a little sweet/decent average. Spice/heat was nonexistent, which I'm not used when it comes to good indian food.Chicken Tikka Masala- average. The flavor of the sauce was pretty good, but there was no heat. Chicken was average. Not the most tender, but still decent/edible. Samosas: mostly potatoes. Fried well. Not as flavorful and spicy as I'm used to but still pretty good. Chicken Biyrani rice: wish there was more rice compared to the chicken. The dish itself was pretty good though. This dish wasn't spicy, but I didn't expect it to be. The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the raisins in the dish.As for ambiance, it's cozy and I like the decor. I think it's appropriate for date night. Prices: The dinner prices are a bit high for the entrees in my opinion. You have to order everything separately and the curry dishes DO NOT come with rice, which I'm not used to. The dishes also do not come with naan which is also a bit disappointing. Overall, I would recommend Simi if you are looking for relatively good Indian food in the San Antonio area, but don't except it to be on par with Indian restaurant in the bigger foodie cities. The lunch buffet is probably a better option if you want more for your money and I would definitely like to go back and try that."], ["Matthew L.", "I've been to Simi's a couple of times now, I've experienced both lunch and dinner and this is my take. I feel I should inform you that my knowledge of Indian Food is almost nothing. I know that I like Naan. and I know how to spell Naan, thats pretty much the extent of it. The only other thing I can tell you about it is that I always love it. Every Indian dining experience is a treat, and I always say I should do this more often, yet I rarely do.Simi's for lunch is a Buffet and thats what I would recommend. You get to try a lot of different stuff and all the Naan you can eat. I tried several different dishes, and I enjoyed them all. I came back recently for Dinner and I got a Rice and Vegetable Dish, it too was amazingly tasty.Here's what I noticed the most, when I had the lunch buffet I got all I could eat and a Chai Tea for around $13. For dinner, I got a couple scoops of rice with vegetables mixed in, one order of Naan, and Chai Tea for about the same price. Even though the rice was great I felt like a fool while paying my bill. I understand that great food will cost you some cash, but I just was like $9 for rice...... Again, had I known more about Indian Food, I may have choose a dish that had more bang for my buck, but in my current stage of enlightenment, I felt like I got hosed. I don't like that feeling.

The chicken tikka masala had this odd sweetness to it. Also I thought that they were a bit proud of it. $20 for both my son and I. I had tea and he water. If my son weren't a toddler who ate a little bit, I would've thought that was a fair price. .I might be willing to check out their dinner menu, but there is a wonderful Indian place just around the way from me that is amazing so I'd probably just go there instead."], ["Richard B.", "Love the place, \u00a0the lady who owns it is lovely, the food is amazing.

Not much filling or flavor inside though the fried crunchy pillows were done perfectly.The aloo gobi was good but not great.

Moving from Atlanta, my bar is set very high, as they have a large Indian population, and several delicious restaurants. My first stop was Simi's. I ordered the vegetarian thali combo and the butter chicken. The menu did concern me when I saw the beef options. I had never seen beef on an Indian menu, but I figured it was just because we are in Texas. I only ever eat vegetarian or chicken, which is what first drew me to Indian food in the first place.I have to say, the portions are huge! Though I was surprised that only the combination meals include rice and naan. The first thing I tried was the mixed vegetable curry. It was also, by far, the best part of the meal. The flavors were rich but not overwhelming, and the vegetable combination was delicious. It truly made me regret not having just ordered that, instead of the thali. I didn't like the Saag Paneer or the Daal as much as the mixed vegetable. The veggie samosa was okay, but not as crispy as I prefer.I then moved on to try the Butter Chicken, which I had ordered as medium spicy. The chicken was oddly sweet, but also very spicy. But though that would normally make for an interesting concept, it felt more like the flavors were competing. The chicken was cooked well but I wouldn't order it again. The service over the phone and when I picked up my order, was good. Very quick and polite. Overall, it wasn't my favorite Indian food, so I'll have to try some more in the area before I decide if I'll be back!"], ["Shaz M.", "Been here a few times over the years and it is never a wow experience. \u00a0Now I am not saying that it is horrible either.

Now the dinner dine in experience was better. The food was fresh and tasted better. The chicken biryani was flavorful but very mild. So was the karahi and everything else we ordered. \u00a0Seems like they don't take chances with spicing it up and we didn't think to ask ahead of time.

For the first time in my life. Yes, Simi's was my first. Ah, first love, why don't we talk about that. I had no idea what to expect- no idea what to order. My friend (who was also in the same boat) and I decided to order.. umm, you know, just 4 full dishes. YOLO, right? Don't ask me to recall what exactly we ordered- it was 3 years ago. All I remember is it was freaking ahhhhhhh-mazing! Dude, we pretty much killed most of the dishes (not my proudest moments). I also remember saying over and over again, \"omg I'm so full but, holy crap, I freaking LOVE Indian food\". Sadly, entering San Antonio was work-related and my visit abruptly ended after 2 months. Fast forward to now--- Once again, I am back in SA and I absolutely had to make a visit to my first love.

It's like when you mastered that perfect hairstyle yesterday, and today you try to create that same do', but your hair just doesn't want to cooperate. Well, that's kind of what I expected (what can I say, that cup's half full). I figured, my fond memory of Simi's could be skewed due to many other Indian restaurants I've had since then, so it can't be as good! To dodge any disappointments, I lowered my standards and walked into the restaurant. My friend and I ordered two dishes (I'm too old for YOLO now): Simi Fish and Chana Masala. Um, disappointment out the window and OH MY FLAVOR. First of all, you should just drop what you're doing and go eat Simi Fish. This fish will change your life. That's all I'm gonna say about that. The Chana Masala, if you're not familiar with Indian cuisine, is chickpeas simmered in delicious sauce. It went really well with the Garlic Naan, basil rice and the Fish. Yup, highly recommended. With the friendly staff, comfortable seating, and awesome Indian traditional d\u00e9cor, the restaurant is warmly inviting.

The chicken Tikka Masala is always tender and delicious. It's a very mild flavor, but it complements everything else on the plate so well. When I'm feeling virtuous or need to keep vegetarian because it's Lent and it's Friday, you know exactly what to do. You provide me with plenty of veggie curries, yummy channa masala, saag paneer and perfectly cooked and spiced lentils. Your naan is always, hot and fresh. It's soft with the slightest crispy char for textural contrast. Your greatness isn't limited to your lunch buffet. Your servers are always friendly and professional and never let me see the bottom of my glass. Your iced tea has a delicate spice of cinnamon and cardamon. You are always prompt and accommodating to my annoying take out orders. Even the way you package your take out orders is perfect. Overall, Simi's, you're my favorite Indian restaurant in town.

It is perfectly spiced with a nice hit of chillies, curry leaves and coriander which makes for fabulous eating. \u00a0The vegetarian selection is also quite good and standouts to me are the green bean and cabbage dishes which are simply made but bursting with flavor and fresh coconut that adds a certain amusing freshness to the dishes.The pakoras (fritters) are always excellent and lately the chicken pakoras have been making my palate sing!

Out of the three Indian restaurants I've eaten at in SA, Maharaja is my least favorite. Yes, the lunch buffet is only $6.99 and the owners/workers are very friendly...but I have to admit that my experience here was not all that great. First, I am eating a samosa, and a piece of hair [that is definitely NOT mine] made its way into my mouth. If this were at the restaurant I would absolutely make sure the manager knew, but unfortunately I was eating this at home. Secondly, the saag paneer is pretty good, but I've had better. It was a bit too spicy and salty too. The basmati rice was undercooked. After eating what my stomach could handle, I put the box in the back of my fridge, hoping that it would disappear. I asked a few of my friends who love Indian-cuisine if they wanted to try some because maybe it was just me...but I suppose the food didn't look too appealing to them. Oh well. I am sitting here as I write this, trying to finish my leftover that will have to be thrown in the trash after I eat the last meatball--which is the best things from the buffet. On a positive note, the manager gave us fresh naan straight out of the oven. But alas, the naan was just okay. It was doughy and crunchy at the edges, yet a little too greasy for my taste. I will dine at India Oven to satisfy my Indian food cravings from now on."]]}
