{"Beto's Comida Latina": [["Linh N.", "Thanks Triple D for another great suggestion!The wait on Friday night was about 20 minutes for a table inside but no wait outside. We decided to sit outside and though it was humid there were fans blowing. We weren't helped for at least 10 minutes until the hostess sent us a waitress. They have a great combo you can customize with 1, 2, or 3 items with empanadas and tacos. The meal comes includes a drink and comes with rice and beans. Though if you order a la carte you will save a few cents but since it comes with a drink it's the best deal since the drinks are at least $2. I ordered the chicken poblano, brazillena, and beef and red chile empanadas with double rice. My favorite was the beef and red chile... great flavor and the crust was so perfectly flaky. The waitress warned me that the brazilena was really spicy... but unfortunately I was underwhelmed. I thought it could have been spicier. My least favorite but apparently is the most popular is the chicken poblano. It wasn't very flavorful and the middle of the empanada was a little underdone. Skip the rice because it was bland and not necessary. BF had the pazole and also some tacos which he enjoyed. His only complaint was that he wanted flour tortillas and they only serve corn. For dessert we tried the guava and cheese empanada which is a MUST! Since it was our first time, the waitress let us have these for free! Will most likely come back for the hibiscus tea, beef & red chile and guava and cheese empanadas!"], ["Donna H.", "I don't know what happened this time but our food was not good at all. Lacking flavor and it was greasy. I was really embarrassed because we took friends there as a good bye dinner before they moved. Even their kids didn't like the cheese quesadillas - they said it was too slimy and they were playing with the grease on their plates. Our friends were polite and asked for to go boxes since they hardly touched their food but I have a feeling it was tossed when they got home. Ugh."], ["Sean M.", "Watermelon margarita with chilli-lime salt is a must do. \u00a0Sit outside and enjoy live music(when available).Al Pastor was good but for those of you who don't care for onions, choose something else.Fish tacos were fresh and light. \u00a0Definitely coming back next trip to San Antonio."], ["D O G.", "Great food and prices. \u00a0Service was great and friendly- very family friendly too. \u00a0Will be back soon!"], ["Katya C.", "First time here and the service was good for the lunch hour crowd.

Overall good place! Recommend it for lunch and will come back."], ["Tomas S.", "4.8 STARS! The chipotle based salsa is fuming with flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. It comes out warm like it should. The chips are crisp and flakey and queso comes with the chips and salsa order. The queso has fresh veggies in it and boy does it have some heat. Mix the salsa with it to create a cool chile con queso feel. They offer only one matgarita on the rocks option and its $6.95. Thats a little more than it should be based on the flavor. Its moderate on kick but does have a smooth tasting mix that doesnt come off too sour. A little more kick would suffice at that price. I ordered the black bean soup. Packed packed packed with awesome spicy flavor but not too much allowing the beans to take hold. The texture is smooth and thick. The side salad ais basic but just enough to pull the heat off ypur palette for a quick second. They even drop a little avacado sauce in it.Main course: I had the chicken pablano empanada and damn its good. Super flaky and the chicken is all pure white meat and has a smooth pablano taste. Its like pot pie but so much better! Yum and as always Enjoy!"], ["Paul E.", "When you go to Beto's, you're going for the delicious food! \u00a0Was recommended this spot by family and as I approached, the building gave me doubts. \u00a0That all changed when I took a bite out of their monster fish tacos!Tuesday is Fish Taco day, getting 2 fish tacos, which is more like 4 tacos, a salad and drink for $7.99! \u00a0The tacos are brilliantly put together and are topped with what tastes and appears to be a cream sauce that really make this dish pop! \u00a0I've been going back every Tuesday just for the tacos! \u00a0Then there is that added benefit of getting a free empanada on your first visit! \u00a0I've taken bites of the meat empanada and it's delicious as well!Overall, the building leaves something to be desired but if you can get past the looks of the place, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the food!"], ["Joseph F.", "Fantastic Place!Great service, excellent food.

Chips queso and hot sauce- were good. Queso had a good taste! I ordered the chicken poblano empanada and carne asada quesadilla.Carne asada quesadilla had more cheese than carne. :(Empanada had more chile poblano than chicken. Crust was not crispy like the reviews said. It was more undercooked and soggy :( :("], ["Karen C.", "The food was amazing, service was great and what was even better is that there was a special on Yelp for two mini margaritas and once I showed it to my waitress, she went to the kitchen and arrive at my table with two drinks!

Good selection of options, but not the best I've tasted. The salsa and guac was quite good though.Best tip about this place: EXTREMELY SMALL Portions.

I decided to call in a to-go order as I was pressed for time. This is where the problems began. I placed my order & the young woman taking my order hung up before I could provide her with Mr name & number and she failed to give me the total - thankfully I already knew. I arrived and entered through the patio area. Servers were scurrying about, as expected during lunchtime, but I literally had to grab someone myself before I was even acknowledged ... That was after about 2m of me standing there. If you're familiar with the layout of Beto's understand I was standing between the drink station and counter where completed dishes are staged. No one noticed me. I finally got my food, paid, and left. I returned to my office and proceeded to see what I paid almost $13 for (I ordered the Combo #2, grilled fish taco and guava & cream cheese empanada). \u00a0To say I was disappointed in the serving sizes of the rice & beans and the \"side salad\" is an understatement ... My fish taco was OK - there was almost enough fish and my empanada was more like a cream cheese & guava versus guava & cream cheese. I'll post pictures. Ultimately, I overpaid terribly ... Something tells me if I had dined in my experience would be much different. Overall, Beto's is still OK ... Just don't order to-go."], ["Rob B.", "We sat at our table for over 10 minutes before we were waited on. Ordered margaritas which were awful. Beef nachos and taco were not good. Service sucked.

A little chatty about other coworkers, really should've taking that outside and not in the dining area. Dining room: It was cool, nothing exciting. Took a seat by the window to have a street view.. Food: I ordered the Chicken and Chilies Empanada, Pozole, and All Pastor Taco. \u00a0Empanada: Tasted mostly of lemon or lime, way overpowered the other flavors. Crust was the best part about it, it was delicious, too bad the filling was blah.. I really had high hopes, HAD.. \u00a0 \u00a0Pozole: It was Ok, the meat was rubbery like it was old and overcooked. I make Pozole several times a year and can tell old over done Pozole, but the broth was good. \u00a0Al Pastor: Yes, I would like some Pastor with my Pineapples. Basically a Pineapple taco in chili sauce. Luckily I was hungry and really love pineapples, but seriously. Prices were cool and they have lunch deals. I would go back later in the day to see if they might just had a bad day. I can't pass up I chance to try the other Empanadas even at $4.00 per.."], ["Allisen H.", "Came here for an early dinner with my dad today. We had planned it beforehand and when arriving around 5:30 pm, it wasn't too packed and we were seated immediately. There was a man playing piano in the corner, which was soothing and interesting. We ordered ceviche as an appetizer, which took a little long, but was delicious. I ordered two fish tacos; they are huge! I took a few bites and it wasn't warm enough to my liking so the waitress was kind enough to bring me back two, hot, and new fish tacos (very nice). I could only scarf down one, but the fish tasted fresh and the sauce on top combined perfectly with it. They could have been a bit more seasoned, but they were very filling. Will probably be back to try different plates; overall, it's affordable and good."], ["Sean T.", "How do you judge a place in its chips n salsa is beyond me. The food was great and prices fair. The service was quick and attentive. The only thing that threw me was the steel smell from the stainless steel tables, overlooked quickly with the quality and quantity of food.I bookmarked this place because it hit the spot. The empanadas are worth every penny. The grilled fish taco... Eh... The al pastor taco was great but again the presentation on the plate, nice choice of south American beer and great service will. Bring me back...Not to mention Betos was featured on food network! For a reason."], ["Jake P.", "Not impressed. Service sucked. Had a rude white girl server that could care less to answer questions.

I love to take people who are visiting or new in town to eat here. It's always delicious, but don't come here expecting a quick lunch... The empanadas tend to take quite a while to bake and service, while always attentive, seems to be lacking any sense of urgency.

The service is friendly, and the vibe is relaxed. A great casual place to dine with friends."], ["Dorie B.", "Wow! This is one of those places I am upset that I didn't know about sooner. I have been looking for a great empanada and this place delivers! I discovered this place as a result of a TPR event where they provided the food... they now have a regular. The crust on the empanadas is so flaky and crispy and the meat is seasoned perfectly. Great rice and beans as well. The drinks were perfect, out of the 4 of us no one was disappointed. They have great vegetarian options as well. I can't wait to go back!

Wasn't world class, but did the job of satisfying our hunger. The chicken fajita meat was under seasoned and carried little flavor. The beef fajita meat, I would get again in a heart beat.

Read reviews about how their fish tacos were delish so i thought I'd try. Ordered one which looked delish overall the fish and toppings on the taco were great the only reason for a 3 star was the homemade corn tortilla was thick and hard...like if it was a day old :( My gf's \u00a0chicken empanada looked delish and she also stated it was.

The margaritas were slightly on the too sweet side for me. We ordered the chicken mole empanada and the grilled fish taco (which they claim is the best in the world). Beto's fries their empanada, which makes the dough flaky and crisp. The outside was really good--flaky and hot, but there was just too much in proportion to the insides. Speaking of the innerds, we thought the chicken was dry and stringy, and the mole was ok, but on the dry, pasty side. The fish taco was a fail also. The taco was drenched in the ranch sauce and the fish was overcooked and rubbery. We suspect both items had been sitting out for a while. We came around 9:30pm, and the restaurant was pretty dark and hard to tell if it was still open. We also had the waitress turn on one of the ceiling fan lights because otherwise we would have been eating in the dark. The staff was friendly and helpful even though it was close to closing time.

The poblano chicken empanada was frozen chicken mixed with Campbell's roasted pablano soup. The el Argentino was okay but not anything to leave your house for.

The only downfall was the roasted corn was frozen but what can you expect in middle of winter. Finally we got to desert was a banana empanada with a leche quemada on top. So many flavors mixed together made for a wonderful party that danced on my taste buds. So thank you Beto for laying it down for us!"], ["Aillet M.", "Don't understand what the hype is. The chips were straight out of tostitos. The cheese was rotelle with regular american cheese.

We ended up with mostly fried food that appeared and tasted the same: \u00a0plantains (good), calamari (very good), yucca frita (not much flavor) and bacalaitos (greasy fried cod patties).

When we got there, a little after 5, the place was practically empty. Oh, how I wish it would have stayed that way. Around 5:30, several families with small children came in, and by 5:45, it was like a zoo. Children were running around tables and screaming -- they appeared to all be wearing the same school uniforms? -- while parents talked to one another as though they were oblivious to the children's behavior. I understand we went at dinner time, and I understand that people have kids, but I wish the staff had said something about the kids running around -- one almost ran into the waitress. At the very least, it can't be safe, and it was definitely disturbing those without children or with well behaved children. That being said, the beer selection was good, could have been a little colder though. The bruschetta was fantastic and the margherita pizza was phenomenal. The mozzarella was the best part. I only wish we hadn't rushed through the end of our meal in an attempt to get out of there as quickly as possible due to the chaos.

Their happy hour is a pretty good deal. $4 wines and beer, along with the flatbreads at a good price. We tried 2 flatbreads (see picture I posted), and the clear winner was the pesto and sausage. The sobro pepperoni was eh, and definitely needed some dipping sauce for the loads of crust. \u00a0The happy hour chianti is fine for $4. What made me add a star was the service we received this time. The gentleman behind the bar was attentive, and he took the time to chat with us. \u00a0He told us about how the gelato is handmade by one of the owners, and he even brought us out a sample of the butterfinger flavor they were creating in the back at that moment.

We started off with the Garlic Bread which was superb! Rich in flavor this garlic bread was amazing. It's even paired with a humus they make themselves! Our waitress told us the owner is a huge humus fan so you know your in for a home run. They have a lovely wine selection and feature craft beers. Score! The wine selection is pretty superb and Wine & Pizza is a formula I'm not complaining about. They were out of a wine we requested but had some great recommendations and even gave us a free glass.

You smelled good and were well built. It seemed like both sexes were enjoying you. I couldn't wait to for you to get in me(Blushing)Your first offering was great, you fed me the meats and cheeses plate. It was lovely: good quality meats and cheeses that were served with some nice, warm toasty bread; a nice prescursor to the marvelous things to come.Following this dish, you fed me the meat pizza. \u00a0Normally, with all these cured meats, the pies are typically salty. Not the case here. For starters, you had me at pizza crust-so masterfully made, I shed a tear. Or two. Just the right thickness with the right amount of crunch. I love you - and I don't say that often. Then the sauce, which was good too; just enough so that as you bite into it-boom-you taste crust, sauce and meats!You were very good to me.

Arrived about 11:30 on a Saturday morning and was the first of many customers to arrive for a wonderful lunch. I had the margherita pizza and a side salad. Not being a fan of ranch, I requested the Caesar dressing. Fresh spring greens torn into manageable bite-sized pieces, crisp and crunchy, heirloom cherry tomatoes, and a dressing that was phenomenal. Obviously house made, the Caesar was flavorful, a perfect blend of mayonnaise, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper. The creamy texture included a hint of Dijon and fresh delicate garlic. The margherita pizza crust was crispy without being brittle, layered with a delectable fresh tomato sauce, mounds of fresh mozzarella and fresh torn basil. The individual sized pie was generous enough to share but I really was glad to have it all to myself. The server was attentive without being intrusive and very knowledgeable about the menu. When she suggested dessert, after recommending the stellar lunch I had just finished, I of course said \"yes!\". The cinnamon gelato was the perfect finish to the meal - in spite of its rich ingredients, the creamy deliciousness lacked the feeling of being too heavy. Reminding me of the winter holidays, I began to imagine the cinnamon gelato in a mug of steaming hot chocolate in spite of the 98 degree weather outdoors.

The restaurant itself was beautiful & the staff was decent (it was dead inside). Asked a few questions to the waiter about the food, being it was our first time, only to have him vaguely answer them. I had seen pictures of the food so once my tiny \"regular\" pizZa came out I was shocked. Everything I saw, yes even on their instagram, seemed to be thick crust. We ordered the margarita pizza. Had I known how small and thin it would be I would have ordered more than one for the two of us. The dough was bland. The sauce tasted generic. Come on at least add some garlic to it. The cheese was decent. If you want a decent pizza somewhere other than a typical pizza joint, I'd recommend you hit up zinc. Once again SA, just because a place is new in town doesn't mean it's the best there is."], ["Brian M.", "What we ordered:- Meatballs and the Caprese Salad- Italian Sausage and Fontina (white cheese) pizza- Meat Calzone- Water, Tea- Gelato (Mexican Chocolate and Amaretti)I'll start by confirming that it is difficult to get a jive out of this place since it is a very modernly decorated restaurant that is boasting of how similar the pizza is when compared to the \"old school real italian\" versions while at the same time talking about the American ingredients. I've had quite a bit of pizza in Italy and that shouldn't be what they tell customers. They need to focus on developing their own style and story. They offer a range of appetizers many of which looked interesting. The meatballs had a peppery overtone which was offset by the red sauce. The caprese was nice with a good balsamic dressing on the salad. My only complaint about the meatballs was that some were cold in the middle while some were quite hot. I was concerned that a microwave was used. That said, it isn't bad pizza. The prices are what you'd expect in this area - about 30% higher than you'd find elsewhere but that's ok. The crust for the pizza is a bit tough but the ingredients are very fresh. I'm not sure I'd agree with some of the combinations and flavor profiles but that is more of a personal taste issue than a critique. The sausage has a tang to it and the balsamic glaze was very well done. The red peppers should be avoided if you don't like spicy items. The Calzone should be tried. They offer several versions and the crust is well made and not over cooked like the pizza. It's probably the same dough but just not overcooked. Again, good quality ingredients. It was the table favorite. We finished by trying two small gelato cups. Both flavors are made on site but another 10 or so are offered and vary based on ingredients available at the time. The chocolate sample was good but the Mexican Chocolate was more interesting so I got that. After about 10 bites, the added cinnamon and pepper became a bit overwhelming. A bit less of each would be better. \u00a0The Ameretti tasted a bit old and was sticky but had good flavor. I believe that they are still working on the place and that the waitstaff need a bit more education and coaching. Refills took forever and another waiter would have helped to ease the service concerns. There were only about 15 people on a Wednesday night and one waiter but several people cooking. \u00a0They have potential but are not as good as Grimmaldi's and way below Dough. \u00a0There isn't much pizza in the area so it is filling a void."], ["Michael S.", "First off I will start by saying that I'm not a big fan of how pretentious the Pearl Brewery area has gotten. With that in mind Sobros is a nice change of pace from the pretentiousness of some of the surrounding business. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed, and their beer selection is adequate. The food is not your typical pizza joint style pizza which is good, the food is not to heavy, and you can tell that the person who designed the menu knew what they we doing.. The staff is knowledge me and attentive. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in San Antonio who is looking for a different and awesome place to eat."], ["Georgina M.", "Full on Monet. Seems great from far away, but up close is a big old mess. \u00a0I will preface this but saying that I love pizza. I believe there is always room for a new pizza place in this great city and will try it as soon as I find out about it. Or at least I thought there was. SoBro was a HUGE disappointment and it seriously makes me rethink that position. It looks adorable when you walk in. It had a very chic modern aesthetic. The hostess had a bit of a put upon air when she sat us in a near empty restaurant on an early Tuesday evening. I get it. I was having a rough day and didn't look my best, but my friend and I thought pizza and wine were just what the doctor ordered to chase away the blues. We were woefully mistaken. I didn't think it was possible, but this pizza experience actually made me more sad. We were greeted by our server shortly after being seated. He was the most neutral person I have ever encountered in my life. He was not friendly, but not rude either. He was coldly professional. We asked about pizza sizes and he indicated that most people order a salad or appetizer and one pizza to share. \u00a0We ordered a couple of glasses of cold Pinot Grigio and started with the spinach and artichoke spread. It was pretty good. It was not the goopy, creamy kind that we're used to, but rather very vegetable heavy and \u00a0lightly bound with creamy cheese. It was, however, a fairly small serving. It was a little ramekin of the spread and a tiny basket of flatbread. It was like toy food. I'm a small girl and this was definitely not enough. I'd feel bad for a family with a teen boy being convinced that was enough food. For our pizza, we ordered the classic margherita. I always feel that it is a great way to gauge the quality of a pizza place. It gives you a sense of technique and ingredient quality without any of the hype of fancy toppings. The pizza was small, but I could overlook that if it was delicious. We could always order a second one if it was good. It wasn't. The top of the pizza was dried out and the bottom was not crisp or charred. The sauce not covered in cheese was hardened to the crust. It was almost like the pizza was cooked in an oven that was not hot enough so had to be left in there too long in order for the crust to cook all the way. The basil they chose use was of an extremely fragrant variety which would've worked really well had they left the leaves intact. The giant blackened, wilted chiffonade of basil that topped each slice was not only sad, but also overpowering. The tomato sauce itself was bland. The cheese was unremarkable. At this point were were in about $60 and decided to accept defeat. Ironically, we had joked when we arrived \u00a0that we could always get a burger at Sam's if we weren't happy. It was really tempting to stop in when we walked back to the car. We were still hungry so we ended up getting TCBY."], ["Karen N.", "Long sigh out. I was so excited about this place!A pizza joint in my hood? \u00a0And walking in, such a nice aesthetic. And unique flavor profiles too. Pepperoni, cashew and kale on thin crust? \u00a0Ok you're kinda pricey for about $13 for essentially a glorified smallish wanting to be medium but if you taste good, I'm game to pay that.But yo, bro, despite everything above... you basic. Hashtag that. #basic.There was absolutely no wow factor. When I'm paying designer prices for designer pizza you better design it. The crust was boring, and flavors not brought together well with a dull sauce. And I'm still hungry... Papa John's may not have kale toppings but they deliver."], ["Manuel H.", "Pizza was great but service was lousy only because it probably a family owned business they can't afford to have more than two waiters... Which was the case with our visit"], ["Andrea Collette P.", "Just okay pizza. \u00a0Its all about the crust and this one just didn't do it for me. \u00a0Although, perhaps I should have gone for one of their interresting looking signature pizzas, but I was craving a simple margherita. \u00a0The atmosphere is average: modern but not cozy. \u00a0Probably a good workday lunch spot but I'll keep searching for a better crust elsewhere."], ["Laura W.", "Great pizza and great service! I love the Margarita pizza. The gelato is to die for. I always look forward to seeing what new flavor they have"], ["Marissa M.", "Put simply, SoBro is not good. My co worker recommended this little spot and I was excited to try some of their sandwiches. To my surprise when my bf and I arrived-- the sandwiches had been completely removed from the menu. Salads, pizza, and a few appetizers are all that remains. The pizza was bland and boring- we ordered a margarita and a chicken/kale option. Both were underwhelming and overpriced (small portions). Don't waste your money-- I mean it... the food is poor. Frattellos Deli blows this place out of the water. Side note: the restaurant has a bit of an industrial (lots of metal/aluminum) feel to it-- looks great, but not functional. The restaurant was almost empty-- except for a party of five seated six tables away. There was a huge echo-- every time a member of their party would laugh it would LOUDLY echo throughout the entire restaurant. It was distracting and completely drowned out our convos. It must be terribly loud when the restaurant is full."], ["Laura R.", "This place was awesome. First off there is covered free parking nearby. Next the wait staff and host was very courteous. The building is new and industrial looking. I loved the clean decor and elevated ceilings. The huge glass windows gave the place a welcome and bright view. Now the menu shows how gourmet the food is. The personal pizza is about 8 slices and big enough for 2 ladies to share. Alot of love goes into the pizza, tasted in the flavors. My pizza had a thin but sturdy cripsy crust. I loved it. The salad was good and made of a variety of greens, not just yellow head lettuce. The dressings are homemade. Overall awesome for lunch."], ["Carlos C.", "Great new place ! Had a great first visit !

He was kind of channeling Ben stein.We ordered the San Antonio caesar salad because I had read good things about it but on the second attempt at bringing it out it seemed no more than a regular Caesar with avocado on top (the first time they forgot the avocado). Also got the cheese and meat plate which was slapped on our table and left to explain itself. Maybe I've gotten spoiled by places like Cured or, well, any other decent food spot I've been to but normally these types of plates come with at least a finger point to each item and the name. Nope, monotone server man set it down and walked away. We ordered the classic margherita pizza and by this time I shouldn't have had high hopes but it is a pizza place so.... Nope.

The menu was full of rather exotic pizzas with all kinds of toppings, no of which really sounded good to me. So I ordered a four cheese calzone. The waiter asked if I'd like a house salad with their vinaigrette and then returned with a plate of mostly lettuce and some kale (or spinach). It was hardly appetizing. Then the calzone showed up. It seemed to be cooked okay, but there was a lot of bread and a mediocre marinara (if that's what it was) to dip in. There was way too much garlic in the calzone. And with 4 or 5 tables, there were only two wait staff servicing the room. I didn't see my waiter but twice, maybe three times. The food wasn't horrible, but the experience was.

My husband hated this pizza. I had to take some of the Gorgonzola from our charcuterie plate and add it to my pizza to give it that salty balance which was suppose to be on my pizza in the 1st place. On a good note my husband enjoyed their charcuterie mix of meets, cheeses, nuts, etc.... We just happened to hit the happy hr.

The owner or possibly manager kept looking annoyed that our group (of about 10) was there. We were there to watch the game, so we were loudly cheering, and since our group was big, we had to put tables together, but I didn't think either act deserved the air of hostility put off by the manager. They also kept turning off the sound to the TV during breaks (like halftime) and for the post-game, and kept playing some awful 70s or 80s sounding music.For food, I had the happy hour manchega pizza, which kind of reminded me of those frozen Totino's pizzas you can buy, but with a few olives and some Spanish chorizo added on top. \u00a0Wasn't blown away by it, but for $5, I couldn't really complain. \u00a0I definitely would NOT buy it for full price though.I had the Abita Rita for $5 for happy hour as well.

More flavor that is! 1- Pizza- I've had Totino's frozen pizzas that were better.2- Paella- It was bland and the texture was strange for Paella. It reminded me of Spanish rice you'd get out of a package/box at the local grocery store. 3- Ensalada Deluxe- there's nothing deluxe about shredded iceberg lettuce with little pieces of chicken sprinkled on top.

They said they had asked us to leave before which one we weren't asked to leave ever and two there was no reason. We paid our drinks and tips like everyone else and were leaving home early since we're not the type of people to be out often. The Bouncers kicked my boyfriend in the face with their boots and messed up his face. they detained him, our friend and some random guy. They let the random guy leave and then the police came but didn't make any arrests because we all have clean records this is something we've never experienced. The owners were outside laughing at us. One of the bouncers pushed me to the ground outside and if it went for my elbows I would've hit my head. I have bruises and my back is hurt. The charges have been pressed and I really hope someone does something. the owners are the most shadiest people ever saying I attacked a bouncer. A 25 yr old girl who weighs 140 pounds really?

For that reason, I always get a good vibe when going out with my friends to this place.

Oh and the prices were very very reasonable.The only constructive criticism is that the parking lot was very packed and we had to park in the back and had to walk along a grassy hill in the dark.

We lived in Madrid for three years and felt like we were back there. This is the REAL DEAL. Much of the crowd were Spanish.The food was authentic and very tasty. We tried the tortilla Espa\u00f1ola (potato & egg tort), fried calamar, champi\u00f1\u00f3n a la plancha (stuffed saut\u00e9ed mushrooms), paella, peloncitos (toasted bread topped with mushrooms and manchego cheese), and patatas a la brava (saut\u00e9ed potatoes topped with spicy tomato sauce). TOO DIE FOR! The red-wine sangria was superb: a nice full-bodied red wine lurked behind a fresh bouquet of fruit flavors and a hint of sweetness. Most folks enjoy over-sweetened sangria--this is not what we had here. Each tapa ranged from $4 to $6, and the paella entree was $12. Pitcher of sangria was $30 and more than enough for 3 adults.The least impressive part of the night was the flamenco dancing, but it was still quite good.

We were then served.We ordered a couple of waters, a glass of sangria wine, and a variety of tapas, including the hot tapas sampler that had paella, albondigas, and a spanish omelet, as well as a couple of bruschetta type appetizers that featured serrano ham on one and tuna salad on another, and some chicken wings. Everything was pretty damn good and reasonably priced. The sangria was $1 for ladies, so my girl ordered them and I drank them (winning!). And our bill was like $3 after the groupon. Not sure if I would go back without a groupon, but I do think that $1 sangria and pretty good food quality makes this place deserve more than the two star rating it currently holds.

We went for a happy hour and boy do I regret it. Maybe if I thought of it as going to a regular bar and not a wine and tapas place, I'd have liked it more. We sat at a table for 10 minutes or so before anyone even came over to give us menus and ask us for drink orders. I knew it was happy hour, but the specials were not posted anywhere, the menu didn't talk about it, nor did our waitress mention it. I always dislike that about a place. Would have been a nice surprise had I been expecting a bill based on the tapas prices. So I order a white sangria, which I do have to say wasn't bad. But it wasn't good... it tasted like extra fruity white wine, which I know I can get without having to infuse it with anything if I choose the right varietal and label. So yeah, no plus on that one. Bf got a bottled beer... you can't mess that up. It was totally sad that our waitress didn't know which beers were domestic and which were imports, nor did she know the price difference between the two. Wow... just wow. You can't upsell or suggest anything if you don't know your menu. Lose-lose for the both of us, lady.We still go on and order several tapas, and none of them turn out to be hits. The el pelon was the most palatable, but really, it's hard to mess up mushroom and onion cheese toast. Gambas al ajillo were once again not bad in favor, but a bit overcooked and rubbery. I liked the garlic more than the shrimp--not a good thing. We got some empandillas that were still frozen in the middle, calamares fritos swimming in grease, and at this point we give up on finding anything that is tasty.Will I be back on my own accord? Not if I can help it. Will I go if a friend asks? Probably not--and that's saying a lot for me because I'm pretty accommodating. What if it were free?

I have often read things about it and I am, of course, well acquainted with the concept of Tapas bars so I thought this would be a good time to check it out. Upon entering, a very dour elderly hostess standing amidst a sea of unseated guests gathering near the door, asked us from afar, \"Do you have reservations?\" \"Only about the quality of the service\" I replied. \"I'm sorry?\" she asked, straining to hear above the conversations from the crowd gathered around her. All at once understanding that she could not hear us and that this was a private party gathered waiting to be seated for a night of Flamenco dancing we afforded her with the same multifunctional, simultaneous response/gesture we provide almost every restaurant hostess we encounter when we are out sans the kids. \"We're gonna sit at the bar.\" Once seated we ordered a few drafts of Dos XX's and a cold Tapas plate which had about as much imagination as a Hollywood reality TV script. Tuna salad stuffed in a cold red pepper skin, a few thin slices of prosciutto and a couple of sticks of Monterrey Jack were but a few of the low-lights. The only thing remotely Spanish about this plate was that the cured meats smelled a little like Rafy Nadal's fingers...and that can't be a good thing. Espana has plenty of Spanish memorabilia and banners hanging from the rafters that help to set the European mood even if the strip center location is about as far removed from Catalonia as you can get.

In the late afternoon the atmosphere is wonderful, they play Spanish guitar and on certain nights of the week they have flamenco dancers.We had like four different Tapas (small plates) from the menu and they were all great.Why do you ask, that I give this seemingly wonderful establishment only three stars? Begin ranting now...The service sucked. We ordered at 8 P.M. and a tapas with only 4 meatballs in it came out at 9:05. I was pissed. The managers paid no attention and I had to seek them out. They have only been open for two months so maybe this will be remedied.I don't have a problem waiting for food, especially when it is good food or served in designated courses like Tapas sometimes are (not here). But an hour for meatballs turned me into a pissed off Eric Bana with green hair.Try the Paella, but keep an open schedule, as I guarantee you might be sitting there for a bit... order more Sangria! oh and avoid the Pan Tomaca con Jamon, it was like ham and spaghetti sauce on bread... choke._______UPDATESo I went back and the food came out in a respectable amount of time, an overall good experience. It took a while to drink the $30 pitcher of Sangria though!

I had just moved back from living in Barcelona, and was curious to see how Texas fairs in preparing Tapas.I was disappointed. It's a regular sports bar with Spanish pictures on the walls and a Spanish flamenco CD popped into the speakers. The ambience wasn't there at all, and the waitress wasn't very informative (she might have been pretty new). The Tapa selection is not terrible, and aren't priced that bad ($5 from what I can recall). However, they weren't good at all. The Patatas Bravas were simply french fires covered in Tabasco sauce. A trick to good Spanish food is to cook in OLIVE oil, something this bar did not due. All the food tasted greasy and bland, the Spanish Tortilla tasted like a fried oily egg, rather than a thick cake of potato and sweet eggs (which is not hard to do). This place had potential, but lack in Attention to the food and ambience kills it for me. So far this is the worst representation of Spanish food I've had so far, so any recommendations, please let me know!"], ["Felix R.", "I almost didn't get in this bar because I wasn't sexy enough for this establishment.

Got there a little later, but luckily the kitchen hadn't closed yet (they close at 11pm btw). Ordered the meat and cheese plate. It was okay. Now I like tapas, I've been to excellent tapas restaurants and I understand they aren't dinner, but exactly what they are called, tapas. The meat quality was good and the cheese was good, but the plate felt like it had been pre-packaged and kept in the fridge until someone ordered it. We were \u00a0a large group but they were able to accommodate us, very nice for a Saturday night and our waitress was EXCELLENT. The whole vibe was more \"american bar close to a university\" than an \"authentic spanish bar\" like it was advertised. Yes there is spanish stuff on the wall, but the vibe still wasn't there. We had a good night and a great time and again, service was really on target for our visit. Drinks were good and not badly priced either. $6.50 for a martini to me is an average rate.I am interested in going back which I feel says something about the place, especially as I live downtown and do most of my hanging out DT as well and this is out near 1604."], ["lauren m.", "I went here about 3 days after it opened, and I was really not impressed. Even for tapas, this was pretty expensive and each dish doesn't come with much food.But the real kicker for me was the paella. I've made paella before, and this was not paella. It was saffron-flavored rice with some meat and peas and carrots thrown in. Not good. The sangria was too sweet, the wine wasn't served in red wine glasses, everything was just very amateur. Disappointing, because I thought this would be our new local restaurant. I'd have to go back to see if they're improved the food, but as it is right now, I'd wouldn't recommend this place."], ["M.

I've had lots of of paella over the years and this was on point! However, I'm giving four stars instead of five because, \"the new batch\" took about 15 minutes to come out. The waitress told me this would be the case, but it felt like longer. Halfway through my meal I asked for a diet coke, and when the waitress brought it back she told me not to worry about it, I presume, because of the wait. After chatting with the waitress about the upcoming events, (flamenco night on Saturdays and Ladies Night on Fridays,) the waitress brought the owner to our table, a very intelligent, cultured woman from Madrid named Mari Paz. We talked with her for about an hour about Spain, Cuba, and other miscellaneous subjects. We were introduced to the DJ of the night, a very explosive, friendly, and charming Cuban guy from Miami.

We went there for a Friday happy hour/celebration and I have to say it is one of the worst restaurants/bars I have ever been too. The service was terrible, food very plain and to top it off the waitress tried to overcharge everyone in our group for their drinks and tapas. This is something which appears to be common place at Espana as I have heard from many different people that they have had the same experience with the overcharging.

So amazing and cooked exactly the way I ordered it (sad how uncommon this is even at fine dining establishments).For dessert we had coffee and a bowl of masserated berries served with mascarpone gelato. The dessert was tasty and of a good size. \u00a0We liked that generally the desserts seemed a bit on the lighter side.The wine list at Citrus was minimalistic, but had some very good wines on it. \u00a0We found an amazing bottle of 2009 Palmaz for $10 more than you could buy it at the winery (if the winery weren't sold out of this library selection, which it is!) \u00a0We ended up buying their 2008 bottle of the same to take to our room because it was such a good deal! \u00a0Generally it appeared that there wines were priced at less than 2x retail which is very reasonable for a fine dining establishment.The restaurant is located in the Valencia Hotel overlooking the San Antonio Riverwalk...it has a minimalist interior with lots of mirrors and candlelight. \u00a0The music could have been better (christmas tunes while we were there), but was not played at a distracting volume). \u00a0The hotel (review to follow) and the restaurant were very romantic.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a very wonderful dinner in a lovely setting. \u00a0We will absolutely return on a future trip to San Antonio."], ["Kelly S.", "Citrus!

That is, until I got the check and saw that the tiny cup was $4 - should've had 2 1/2 more cups to breakeven with Starbucks. Overall, I'm not a fan of the slow service.

For starters I had the shrimp and chorizo iberico, my wife had the bibb lettuce salad. The shrimp looked small in its ramekin but was a decent portion - five or six shrimp with disks of sausage in a dark sauce that tasted of a wine or vinegar reduction and onions. The salad was light and well balanced between the nuts and cabrales cheese and was a good portion for a fine dining restaurant.Lamb shank seemed pricey at $38 until it arrived. It was one of the largest I have seen and perfectly cooked - tender but not quite falling off the bone. Accompanying it was another deep ragout with might have been cabbage or frisee on the top. It went so well with the Meiomi pinot noir.

I had settled between the foie gras and tuna tartare and asked which he suggested, instantly he said foie gras without a doubt, \"best in the city!\" Hell ya, I thought when it came out, the foie gras portion is large and deserving of the $20 tag associated with it and was very beautifully presented with house made brioche toast. Sadly the flavors were bland, and almost uninteresting aside from the foie, it didnt live up to the artistic expression on the plate and failed to impress my girlfriend and I.

We were greeted promptly, the hostess and restaurant manager up front were friendly and welcoming. Logan came in just a few minutes to get our drink orders, and the courses were well-time. We weren't hurried but they were also mindful of our theater start time, since they asked us, and I heard them asking most other diners, if we were going to the show. The manager did come by to check on us as well.I had the three course tasting menu they'd put together for the show, and my mother had the spinach salad and the veal. My black bean & crab soup was delicious - rich and creamy and full of flavor. I wish I could buy it to make at home. The portion was pretty big for an appetizer, though. Offering a cup in addition to a bowl would be great. I also could have used more creme fraiche, but I'm a creme fraiche fanatic. My crispy skin red snapper was cooked well and flavorful, but the skin wasn't as crispy as advertised. However, the accompanying sofrito was to die for! For dessert, we shared the lemon curd, which was tart and fantastic! My mother loved both her salad and her veal chop, which was thick but cooked medium rare to her liking. (And she's picky.)The atmosphere in the restaurant is trendy but comfortable, just like V Bar, and it would be good for a romantic dinner, for dining with friends / family, or for a small group.

Paella/Pasta bar for $12.95 is good but I am not really a fan of pasta bars in general and $12.95 is a little more than I want to spend on lunch. The bar comes with soup, other small apps. and fresh agua frescas so if you know how to \"buffet\" that it works.I had their carrot soup that they should rename to \"Explosion of Autumn Flavors\" maybe not those words exactly but it is really good and carrot soup sounds boring and something your mom would make you eat while you cry because it is so gross. \u00a0You can tell by the presentation that they really take pride in their food and your overall experience.You must have the Hazelnut Cheesecake.

Great food, great wine, and great service shared with great friends.... \u00a0 Outside on the balcony overlooking the famous Riverwalk, we sat comfortably around a candlelit table and soaked in the ambience. \u00a0Lulling murmurs from the Riverwalk carried by the night air and cooled by the gentle breeze from the river swept the hotel balcony and brought with it the occasional aroma of the touristy restaurants and bars below. \u00a0After perusing the promising ala carte menus, we ordered the four course tasting to insure we had a bite of it all! Three different appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert orders, among which there were several standouts!! There is a saying in Arabic \" al a3yn ta'kool \" or \"the eye eats\". I found it especially applicable to the visual feast created by the chef at Citrus. Each bite was fresh, well prepared, and thoughtfully plated enough to grace the finest table in DC, and was a pleasant surprise to find in the heart of the touristy San Antonio Riverwalk!!!---who knew?! \u00a0 Appetizers we shared included diver scallops, the famous crab cake, and seared wagyu carpaccio. Each morsel was delectable and we gobbled up every bite. \u00a0This place is supposedly famous for crab cake and, although they were quite nice--especially with citrus hollandaise, the biggest surprise came in the amazingly flavorful scallops seared to perfection and served in a rich carrot broth. Six very energetic thumbs up for the appetizers.  \u00a0 We all ordered the heirloom tomato salad and although beautifully plated, three wedges of each dish were not quite as succulent as the others and weren't eaten (it IS a little late in the season for heirlooms, but they WERE on the menu), so eeehhhhh for the second course--not terrible, but not worthy of sharing the table with the other beautiful dishes! \u00a0 Entrees varied from seasoned pork loin to filet mignon to antelope, and each palate-pleasing bite was beautifully plated with local garnishes and sides--chipotle mashed potato, asparagus, roasted root vegetables--yummy! \u00a0 Perhaps the best part of the night was dessert!

My husband had the burger, an item they were obviously proud of. The manager stopped by and asked him how he liked the burger and he responded that he was pleased. That burger apparently was rated among the top 4 in Texas, or something like that. It was good. The manager, however, did not inquire about my Reuben sandwich, which was the worst I've ever had. Two (yes, 2) very thin slices of pastrami, mounded with sauerkraut, and served on marble rye that was served with the burned side down. It tasted like a burned sauerkraut sandwich and I had to actually search to see whether they'd forgotten the meat. For $15, the sandwich should have had a more generous portion of pastrami. The soggy waffle fries made the entire plate inedible. I shared my culinary misfortune with my husband who had a hard time getting the burned taste off his palate. I complained and they comped my sandwich but didn't offer me or my tummy a replacement. A hungry, disappointing way to start 2015."], ["Jasmin D.", "A few coworkers and I partook in Citrus' lunchtime paella bar. This review is solely on the paella bar setup, and not for their traditional dining menu, which from what I can remember is phenomenal. The paella bar reminded me of a pasta station that they offered in my college cafeteria. Pick your protein(s), pick your veggies, add some Spanish rice, white wine, butter and voila, you've got your self some custom paella. Great idea, but it isn't executed very well. There is about a 10 minute line to even look at what's going on as far as ingredients. A line running throughout a small restaurant can be a little awkward. You wait about another 10 minutes for your paella to cook, during which you can get something from the soup and salad bar. The soup I had was a tomato basil, and was honestly my favorite thing I \u00a0had here. Afterwards, you head back to your table to wait for your paella. The only problem being that if you aren't back up at the cooking line to claim your dish it could very well be taken by mistake by another hungry patron. Paella looks like paella. Other complaints - the service was lagging. No clean spoons available at the time I went, and had to wait quite a while for that. Spoons? If you're serving soup, spoons should be something to have ready during a lunch rush. Also, the staff were repeatedly picking up plates that people were still eating off of without asking first. Eh just small things but in a restaurant like this they shouldn't be making such rookie mistakes."], ["Washington T.", "Food is great."], ["Chavah A.", "Citrus is ok.

I would gladly make Citrus a return destination on my next visit to the boy's family in San Antonio.Also, wonderful service. Before we even ordered, we had requested to enjoy our coffee & desserts on the patio outside for a view of the Riverwalk & cigarettes, and they did it automatically as soon as they saw we were ready. Also, we didn't have as much of an appetite since we'd just eaten a lot 4 hours earlier, so we decided to share our meal and pay the splitting fee - they informed us that the chef would rather give us an extra crab cake instead.."], ["Mark G.", "Visited Citrus before a San Antonio Symphony show at the Majestic Theatre.

Scallops followed for my main course. 2 large scallops perfectly cooked and seasoned. Would recommend them. Wife had the crab cake.

And I absolutely love coriander (i.e., cilantro)! The spinach salad had too much horseradish; it had an overwhelming finish. \u00a0Otherwise it had potential, and the candied bacon was fresh with just the right crunch. \u00a0The red snapper was fresh and cooked well, but the olive garnished sauce was quite bad, think meatless ragout. \u00a0I got the sauce on the side because I was unsure it would be to my liking and I was right. \u00a0My wife's bacon wrapped chicken was a relatively small piece of chicken in a similar sauce (in a bowl!?) with some bean puree of sorts. \u00a0The sauce was also not a good match for the chicken in our taste. \u00a0For unknown reasons, they served the chicken in a bowl with very high sides. \u00a0This is chicken that requires cutting to eat so the downward approach angle was probably 60 degrees to stick a knife into the bowl. \u00a0The base was very narrow so the presentation here was poorly thought out. \u00a0Both main dishes lacked substantial complimentary sides and there were no additional side dishes available on the menu, which I found odd. \u00a0As a consolation, the manager offered us their specialty dessert which was a ganache, sprinkled with butterscotch flavored rice crispy treats, and a topping of vanilla bean flavored whipped topping, which tasted quite sour. \u00a0I love chocolate desserts so I was excited to taste it, but disappointed to find that there was nothing underneath the ganache but more ganache. \u00a0It was basically a small bowl of ganache with a small sprinkle of the rice crispy streets and a large tablespoon of whipped topping. \u00a0It was far too imbalanced, with an overwhelming amount of ganache, even for those who love ganache. \u00a0The ganache itself was fairly good but lacked an intensity of cocoa flavor I would normally expect, perhaps because there was too much cream. \u00a0The manager understandably didn't appreciate my comment that the dessert looked like a bowl of microwaved chocolate (because the current chef threw out the microwaves in the kitchen), but the fact is the presentation was poor and the dessert itself was imbalanced. \u00a0More could've been done by employing the rice crispies to a greater degree, in a form, to balance out the overwhelming ganache. \u00a0It would have been appropriate for the manager to describe the dessert as he served it to our table. \u00a0All he mentioned was the rice crispies. \u00a0Overall, it felt like an experiment that didn't quite hit the mark. \u00a0I'll keep checking the menu and my wife and I will probably try again. \u00a0We loved the previous Citrus menu but we'll try to keep an open mind."], ["Stori Z.", "My bestie and fellow yelp\"er\" came into town with her hubbie so we could celebrate our 40th birthdays together.

The place is great, I like the minimal decoration and I like the setup where you can get the salad bar and the fresh daily juice included with lunch. The paella itself is allright; it's worth the $12.50 you pay for it but not anything much higher than that.

When the hostess was walking me to my table, she asked me if I was going to want to order from their menu or the paella or pasta buffet. It was my first time there so she had me go over to see what was available on the buffet. Well first off, I always think of a buffet as all you can eat but this is not all you can eat. I wasn't that hungry anyway and the only reason I passed on the buffet was because it was a lot of food and I didn't think I would get my $11 worth of food. I see some reviews on here state that the buffet is around $9 or $10 but I guess it's changed because I'm pretty sure the hostess told me it was $11 or $11.99. Either way, although everything looked really good, I decided to pass on it. I also think that maybe during the summer, maybe the buffet could be moved a little further away from their patio door. The patio overlooks the river (or riverwalk or whatever) and everytime someone opened the door, flies would come in fly around the buffet. I don't blame the restaurant for the flies of course, I mean it is summer in Texas and they're right on the riverwalk for goodness sakes so flies are going to get in no matter what. I'm just thinking maybe the buffet should be further away from the door during that time. Anyway, I wasn't sure what to order from the menu and there weren't many options but everything they did have sounded really good. I wasn't super hungry so I decided to try the avocado bacon chopped salad. I saw that they had soup on the menu and I asked the waitress if getting a cup of soup was an option but she said they only had the soups available in a bowl. So I told her I was thinking of getting the salad but I wasn't too sure of the size of the salad and I was debating on trying a soup with it. She said the salad that I wanted was huge and it was her favorite as well and that it would definitely be filling. So I went ahead and went with that. When the salad came, I was shocked at how big it was! I was also grateful that the waitress was honest with me and talked me out of ordering anything extra. The salad consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, bacon pieces, I think it had some cheese (I don't remember), and tortilla strips. I also had added some chicken which she had suggested and it was a great suggestion. I was really happy with all the flavors in the salad and I have to say that my first experience here was a great one. The service was superior and friendly and I can't wait to become a regular there.The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the buffet issue. I didn't want to try it at that time but I do want to try it some day but having too may flies around it makes it really unappetizing looking. Other than that, I really enjoyed my first visit."], ["Angela F.", "3.5 starsHit up Citrus on a Friday night with some friends...the place was quite deserted. I think there were about 3 other small tables. I LOVED the modern design of the restaurant (and Hotel Valencia, in general). Our server was wonderful. Can't remember her name. She was attentive but not overbearing. She offered suggestions and our wine/water glasses were always full. I laughed to myself when they brought out the bread basket: I quickly recognized it as the Rosemary Bread that my friend and I buy/eat on the regular from Central Market! I asked the server, she laughed and said yes. It's so delicious! The chef was kind enough to send out some complimentary \"spoons\" that had an oyster and some kind of tasty cheese/cream of something blend. Good, fun surprise!I ordered the crab cake for dinner. Good size, definitely generous with the crab [not much filler], an interesting medley of greens on top that flavored well together. It was ok. The one at Ounce is the best I've had...that one knocked my panties clean off! Back to Citrus' crab cake: it was good, but not great. For better, Ounce it.My friend ordered the tomato risotto: it was terrible! It tasted like spaghetti/marinara sauced rice and had three small round cherry tomatoes on top. It was a super small portion, too, for $14?! I'd guess that probably cost about $1 to buy for the portion. We'd happily pay that if the flavors were acceptable. She nicely returned it and requested the crab cake, which our server graciously accepted.Tasted the eggplant mousakka...pretty good stuff!Here's what I'd go back to Citrus for: the cinnamon croissant bread pudding with bourbon glaze, OMG!

The quail with the corn waffle and maple glace was a cool take on chicken and waffles. The nutella cheesecake and bread pudding were to die for. The blackberry bramble is probably one of the best, if not the best, cocktails I've ever had. It was delicious AND strong. I got my $10 worth out of it. The complementary bread was soft and chewy on the inside and had that perfect crispy crust on the outside (yes, I'm commenting on the free bread too). Something is off about the ambiance and the fact that the restaurant is called \"citrus\". The only thing citrus about the restaurant was the display of oranges signed by celebrities outside the restaurant. Aside from that, the interior was red and black and had bamboo, which seems more appropriate for an Asian restaurant. Anyone else think it's ridiculous that from the time we sat down to the time we signed the check, it took a total of 3 hours? The waiter was nice when he actually came to our table. It took at least 30 min to get our appetizer and at least an hour to get our entree. The restaurant wasn't even packed. That's unacceptable.

It was tender and very well seasoned.The portions at Citrus are very generous. We did not take part in the pre fixe option only because we weren't planning on getting dessert, and I wasn't disappointed in our choice since the two courses we did have were so large.

It had a lemon sauce on the bottom that was very bitter and left a \u00a0strange after taste. The chef sent out a small sample of ahi tuna on top of watermelon. It was the best part of the meal. We should have gone on the Riverwalk to search for better food! Sorta ruined my birthday."], ["Hannah A.", "The ambiance is pretty sad and outdated.

We were staying at the hotel and went one day for lunch and the other day for breakfast. When we went for lunch, we did the pasta bar. We had to literally walk around the restaurant to find someone to get the chef at the pasta bar. When we got to our table, we noticed we were the only table without bread. We asked for some and it didn't come until we had paid! The server explained that it was because it was in the oven however the few tables seated after us were all given bread. It also took about 20 minutes to get water and an entirely too long wait to get the check. We were hoping it was just our particular server that was bad so we returned the following morning but experienced the same horrible service with someone else. We sat at our table for about 20 minutes before finally being greeted and once again had a very long wait to order drinks and food. As soon as we began regretting our decision to give this place a second try, the table next to us was complaining about how two of their orders, for their children, never came and the 30-minute wait for their check. To prevent this and so we could get on with our day, we literally asked for the check the minute our food came out. The pasta deal is good but the service here just is not worth it."], ["Phil L.", "Just reviewing lunch.

The soup of the day was coconut based with shitake mushrooms, bok choy, chicken and carrots. Excellent. Salad choices included spinach salad w/cranberries or a seaweed noodle salad. The paella bar is amazing! You can combine anything which included Shrimp/Mussels/Crab/Pork/Sauasae/Artichokes/Asparagus/Mushrooms. For what you're paying its an incredible lunch deal. \u00a0The atmosphere was a little quiet and maybe Citrus doesn't look so nice in the day time. \u00a0Overall you can't be the value at one of the nicer restaurants in town. \u00a0A must try!"], ["Grady B.", "Fantastic meal in beautiful surroundings, great service."], ["Stasa C.", "I can only speak to breakfast... but it was amazing.

(even though the lighting is dark in here)This is a tapas style place. People complain that the food \"comes out so random\" but it doesnt. You get one plate at a time because its Tapas. You share. We liked not getting all the food at once. It made you appreciate each plate individually. We had the Corn Fritters, I didnt think they were anything special, but they were good. Just Corn Fritters is all. Shashito Peppers - for being a big bowl of peppers, these things were my favorite! Sauteed in Feta and Chorizo after being grilled (Im guessing here, Im not sure the steps) these little suckers were good. No they arent hot either. Lamb Kabobs - the waiter said these were the top seller so we ordered them. We arent big lamb lovers but these were very good. 4 kabobs to a plate. Pork Lettuce Wraps - these were ok. The pork was watery which made these little wraps kind of messy to eat. We used a fork instead. They were good, but nothing special really. All in all, the 4 items we purchased was just the right amount of food for 2 people. We had 1 glass of wine and 2 beers and our bill was around $68.00.

I sampled the sausage wrapped in pancakes and served with blueberry syrup, the French toast, the fried egg sandwich, the potatoes, the grand mimosa, eggs in hell and a few other things I can't remember the names. Honestly everything was great. Very surprising and very filling. The night time cocktails are amazing and the atmosphere is super cool. I'd recommend anytime.

After 45 minutes of watching people leave but seeing tables remain uncleared or unused (I counted 8 just from my view on the patio), I asked the hostess for an update on our table and we were seated five minutes later-- at the empty table right by the front door, that had been empty since we first put our name down. Strike one.Our server came by and greeted us with, \"You guys had a chance to look at the menu while you waited, right? Are you ready to order?\" LOL wut. You can't do your job efficiently but I better be ready to be your easiest customer ever, huh? My sister asked for a minute to decide between two choices, and our server didn't come back for ten minutes. Strike two.Food came out quickly. The Eggs in Hell ($12) was a bland take on shakshuka, with a spicy tomato sauce being the only flavor on the plate. I enjoyed the polenta but wished it wasn't flavorless. The accompanying bread was burned. Sister's Truffled Egg Sandwich ($13) had a tasty truffle-mayo sauce, but the house potatoes were not seasoned at all. The pancake-wrapped sausages ($6) were okay: flavorful sausages tasted like they'd been dipped in funnel cake batter and were served with a blueberry sauce. Overall the food was lackluster. Strike three.Throughout our meal, the music in the dining room was so loud that we could not carry on conversation and we were not checked on by our server until we were over halfway done. The menu, d\u00e9cor, and location set an expectation for quality and service that the employees don't even bother to try to meet."], ["Mia C.", "So much hype about this place, especially for brunch. Needless to say, I think it was overrated. There were several reviews about bad service, but I found everyone to be friendly.

I get there within 15 minutes and all of a sudden it's a 30 minute wait. Oddly enough, there were about 7 tables available and only 3 people ahead of me. She was friendly but it was annoying. Went and sat at the little waiting area by the bar where the other 3 groups of people were hanging out. Sure enough, 4 minutes later she came back and said oh I have a table for u now. Because i scoped out the menu beforehand, I new I wanted the almond pistachio french toast. It was abit underwhelming. The pistachio pieces tasted great. Couldn't take the almond anywhere. The French toast batter is meh. Maybe I'm spoiled by LA brunches, but it was a one time time visit for me. Also, just i town for work."], ["Stephen T.", "Tapas Style.

Who needs a guy when you can have a prince, right?! Since they do tapa style dinning, my friend and I shared 4-5 plates. They were either hit or miss. I really liked maybe one or two.

FYI if you make a reservation they get your credit card number and say they will charge you $100 if you don't show up. Fortunately, right when we showed up our table was ready for us. On Sundays they have a DJ which is kind of nice, and contrary to what others have written the music isn't that loud. We were able to carry on normal conversations without the music being a distraction. I had a mimosa for $7 (I watched the bartender make it and it was definitely 1/10 orange juice and 9/10 champagne haha). Many of the people in my group ordered the WT (cornbread with cream gravy, two fried eggs and bacon) and said it was really god. Others ordered the chorizo sandwich (also good), the mini churros, maple glazed bacon (I tried a piece and it is like candy bacon. AMAZING), and the almond pistachio french toast (not very good ... there is something weird about the batter or bread they use that could be better). I ordered the blueberry pancakes and they were definitely on point. In fact I would say that they give Magnolia a run for their money. You get three large pancakes for $11 (easily shareable!) and they are topped with powdered sugar, butter and fresh blueberries. Overall the service was great and the food was delicious.

Thanks, Feast!"], ["Christina L.", "Before you read my take on how my first visit to Feast went down, I want to preface that the food is outstanding; however, due to the lackluster service I am not sure I would ever go back. \u00a0That is why I gave it an overall rating of 3 stars. \u00a0Without further ado, my experience at Feast:First off, I drove all the way from Austin to San Antonio at 4:00 on a Tuesday afternoon to pick up my good friend which I had not seen in some time. \u00a0She had been hearing rave reviews of this place from her friends and so we decided to try it out.Walking in the front door was a bit of a mystery as the two dark haired hostesses gave me a look as to say \"Do you have a reservation?\" \u00a0After being bewilderedly welcomed, we were sat in the far right corner of the main restaurant near all the Z Gallery accessories on the wall. \u00a0After some time we were welcomed by our server, who did inquire if it was our first time dining with them. In answering \"Yes\", we were provided a brief overview of how their dinner menu worked. \u00a0We dined on their Shishito Peppers, Sweet Corn Fritters and Thai Butter Lettuce Wraps. \u00a0Shortly after receiving our dishes it seemed that our server lost interest in providing us with excellent customer service as we had to ask for refills of water and even though the tea was excellent, he brought me a spoon that had dried coffee stains on it. And anyone who knows me, knows I find coffee to taste gross!You ask why I didn't order a cocktail, well I would have but their bar was lacking some main ingredients. \u00a0As we continued our dining experience it became overwhelmingly apparent that the acoustics in this establishment were underdeveloped as it became increasingly difficult to have a conversation at a normal volume level.As we were winding down, we noticed that the table to our left was being approached with a sculpture of sugary sweetness. \u00a0We would have probably enjoyed their dessert menu; however, remember earlier when I stated how awesomely not interested our server was. \u00a0So after flagging down another dark haired woman to pay our bill I asked in passing if they served dessert. \u00a0Her reply \"Yes we do\", my reply, \"Interesting\".So my friend and I concluded our night getting a delectable treat at Lick!I sincerely hope that the care, attention to detail and thought that Chef Stefan Bowers puts into each and everyone of his dishes carries from the back of the house to the front of the house. \u00a0It is just a shame to see someone who has invested so much time in perfecting their craft to have undisciplined staff ruin the overall experience."], ["Andrew \u00df.", "Stopped back by on first Friday and really enjoyed one of the small plates, wasn't good enough for me to remember but it wasn't as bad as my first visit.

Both were good. We started off with the skirt steak tostadas and the grilled beets. Both were excellent. We then had the cornmeal battered, deep fried oysters and finished with the falafel. Each one was unique, flavorful and fresh. Overall, there wasn't an item on the menu I wouldn't order. Our server was a lovely young gentleman and was attentive, but not over bearing.

The only complaint was that the DJ was so loud that it was difficult to hear the server or anyone else at the table. I'm not sure why they chose to play techno-club music on a Sunday morning but I guess that is their crowd. The food was good but a bit on the expensive side for the quality and the overall service provided. The blueberry pancakes are very large and wonderful - certainly the choice for someone wanting breakfast even later in the day. The egg dishes are prepared well but even though they are advertised to be 4-egg, they aren't very large. The hamburger was good but consider having the \"special sauce\" on the side and adding it after you taste the burger. Mine was cooked to order and very tasty. An artisan bun would have made it perfect. This is a loud restaurant so be aware of that when you go. Consider the age of your party members and if anyone has a hearing issue, consider another venue as this one is VERY lively acoustically. I suspect if the DJ had been set up on the left side of the venue it would have been a better experience but he was right by the door blasting away at diners.

More particularly for the terrible management and owner of this restaurant... who I see is arguing with customers via Yelp. HA what a joke.Rewinding back to 2014... We had high hopes for our NYE reservations but were very disappointed. We made the reservation because we love the spunky atmosphere and eclectic menu. However, at the time of making the reservation no one mentioned that there was a $95 minimum a person. When we arrived we were treated very rudely and didn't receive cocktails for 30 minutes. For $95 a person I should be greeted at the door with a drink. After asking if it would be permissible to share the 5 course meals between 2 people, we were told that would be ok and we proceeded with ordering despite feeling deceived. About 20 minutes later we were told that we would be charged nearly $800 if we chose to leave without eating any food. EXCUSE ME? At this point we were speaking to the manager who was being EXTREMELY rude and demeaning. We were trying to calmly explain the situation while constantly being interrupted with him saying that they were \"booked\" when the room immediately to my left was empty. I don't tolerate liars, horrible service, or rude waitstaff and bartenders; especially when I'm paying $180 per couple. AND ALSO, what kind of manager ARGUES WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS?After going back and forth, we ended up screaming, at the top of our lungs, how ridiculous this entire situation was. I could easily have gone to Bob's, Perry's, Paesano's or any other comparable restaurant for a similar price and received exemplary service expected of a 5 star restaurant. My holiday with my friends was ruined due to the stupidity of a terrible businessman and restaurant owner. I hope no one EVER goes to this restaurant again.

After glancing at their menu, I was impressed with their offerings as well as the layout of the menu. Lots of veggie friendly options! We ordered the corn fritters, thanks to the advice of many yelpers, and we both enjoyed them as our appetizer. Nice sweet flavor, and the spicy creamy dip was a good addition. Next, we received our calamari dish and our thyme chanterelles. The calamari was just okay, but the mushrooms were delish. Nice and meaty, paired with a white asparagus puree. Yum. I'm giving Feast three stars because I wanted to be super wowed, especially with the prices and size of the dishes. I know it's a tapas restaurant, so I expect there to be smaller plates, but none of the dishes had me shouting from the rooftops. They were all good, yes, but not \"the best thing I ever ate\" worthy. I'm glad we tried Feast, but I doubt we'll make it back."], ["Christine J.", "I went here for brunch.

The DJ playing outside as we walked up made me hesitant, but when the creamy mac and cheese with chorizo bread crumbs hit the table, we were back on track. When asked what made the bacon burger so juicy and flavorful, the waiter informed us that it was 100% Angus beef and locally sourced without sounding pretentious! The almond-pistachio French Toast with the dollop of what I'd guess was a sweet cream cheese icing was fluffy and divine--no syrup necessary. I wouldn't order the blintzes again and the chorizo egg sandwich wasn't special. Definitely almost knocked it down a couple of stars but the semi-swanky decor distracted me. They had run out of a house made tomato mix for bloody mary's so we had mimosas, which were pretty average aside from a candied strawberry garnish; I'd try the guava version next time. My brother who is a fan of craft beer was pleased with their selection, which had seasonal options.

The decor is eclectic and interesting without being overpowering, and Chef's willingness to experiment and rotate the menu is clearly apparent. Must Order - Shishito Peppers with ChorizoDon't Order - Marinated Calamari Food (5): I went with three other individuals, and we took advantage of our body count to order as many of Feast's dishes as possible. While everything we ordered was pretty good, the Shishito peppers and the mac and cheese really stole the night. The peppers had been cooked with chorizo (after being blackened) and the mac and cheese had a bread crumb topping that was just amazing. Drink (4.5):On this occasion I was drinking beer and was very pleasantly surprised (for San Antonio) at their Craft beer selection. Another member of our party had a martini and then transitioned to Pinot Grigio by the glass, which he thought was pretty good for the price. Service (4.5):We had a brief wait while the table was being setup and we used the opportunity to get a drink at the bar. Unfortunately (fortunately?), our table became available about midway through our drinks being made. I asked if the drinks could be brought to our table and the affable bartender was happy to comply. It ended up taking about 10 mins for our drinks (slightly warmed at this point) to get from the bar over to our table, but after this slight service snafu everything was peachy. Our waitress was knowledgable, passionate and happy to answer any and all questions we had about the food. \u00a0Notes:The temperature inside was a little warm and the air seemed kind of stagnated. Neither of these characteristics was negative enough to impact our overall experience, but all our party members would have been more comfortable if either the AC was turned up, or there was a fan keeping air moving throughout."], ["Mo M.", "I love this place! I highly recommend the tostadas! The only downfall is the service. both times I went, the plates come out randomly. both times, at least one plate came a long time after the rest of the food. this last time, we had to cancel the last plate. but with times we went on a busy night so maybe it's not a regular thing."], ["Mandy S.", "I would have given this restaurant a 4 stars had it not been for the terribly slow service. \u00a0I came here for a late dinner on a Tuesday night. \u00a0The place was decently busy, but not so busy that I should have to wait 30 minutes for the waiter to come by the table and take our order. \u00a0(I have other friends that have had to same slow service so it was not unique to the day/night I was there for dinner.) \u00a0The poor service is the only problem with this place.The ambiance and the food were modern and chic.The food our table ordered were all excellent and I would order each dish again (corn fitters, tilapia curry, watermelon salad, okra). \u00a0If you want a good, quick meal this is not the place to go. \u00a0Please be ready to be patiently waiting......."], ["Dan M.", "On the expensive sideDelicious tapasGreat special - Thai sausage lettuce wraps with pickled veggiesGreat heart of bibb saladGood mac and cheeseNice serviceTrendy party of town"], ["Noneya L.", "NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE STAR!!!!!I don't know wth is wrong with the yelpers.

If our dinner party was smaller I don't think it would've been an issue. It was just bad style that the birthday girl was waiting the longest for her food to come out.

A mild Texas evening prompted us to choose an outside table. We decided to share the 9 different menu items we selected. None of them disappointed. In fact most were a pleasant surprise. The broth that comes with the mussels is like nothing we've experienced here and in Europe. The lamb kabobs were everything we were hoping they would be plus a fantastic feta sauce. The service only added to the experience. Logan did a great job explaining the menu items as well as making some spot on suggestions.

Only about 6 other tables were populated, service was friendly but not overbearing, the atmosphere is kitschy, modern, & sooooo MiSAmi! 4 Princesses (check the drink menu) later, I can say I liked most of the food except the pea salad (as in black eyed peas, not green) & the mac & cheese (thin, watery, flavorless...I've tried it twice, same thing). We went for brunch this past Sunday & I wasn't as pleased as my dinner experience. We made 1030 reservations for a party of 9. ALL of us are Yelpers. We weren't seated til our entire party arrived (what's the point of a reservation?). And, they held $100 on one of our credit cards in case of no show. Understandable, but, the gall! Reminder: we're in SA not LA, mkay? Anyway, the pancake covered sausages dipped in blueberry sauce were mighty tasty. My fried egg sammich was good. The fingerling potatoes? Pass. I tasted the fries & they're much better so request that sub. I tasted the blueberry pancakes...dry cardboard without flavor. Mimosas...they'll do but the juice was too sweet & the champagne too brut. The flavors battled each other.The people watching? Mother trucking classic!

Every guest I've dragged here also enjoys these sweet, savory morsels. The corn fritters are oh-so-delish! I won't eat corn fritters anywhere else, but after trying these...I'll have seconds. Jalape\u00f1o cream cheese is a brilliant touch. It wasn't on the menu recently, but the Thai curry noodles were very good a few months back.

Do yourself a favor and save room for dessert: chocolate chip bread pudding w/ ice cream made in house. Better than sex.This place is decorated to my liking, swanky and eye-catching.

Some people think they're dining in LA or South Beach; Feast brings it out in them I suppose! I must admit, it gets quite crammed in here on weekend nights that I've been, arrive with patience.

Both are nice and a must for visitors, but Southtown has a lot going on...Which brings me to Feast. I came across this restaurant/bar by coincidence. The inviting patio and modern storefront demanded me to pull over and grab a seat. It wasn't only until I checked-in on Yelp's app that I realized I previously bookmarked this location. I sat at the bar and was attended by Natelie, who proved to be a great barkeep and excellent company. If dining inside Feast, the feel and decor is modern. Lighting is dim, perhaps an indigo if looking at the color spectrum. Outside, the patio is perfect for a warm summer's night. My order included:Goat Shoulder ($13)- braised goat shoulder served as a tapas. It lacked flavor, but had nice texture. Rating: 3/5.Libations:Lawnmower by Saint Arnold Brewing Co. ($5)- decent, but I wouldn't order this beer again only because I like my beers hoppy and bitter. Rating: 3/5.King Cocktail ($9)- Maker's Mark, Vermouth, Orange bitters, Amarena cherry served up. Excellent drink and a great job by Natelie. Rating: 4/5. Although my ratings for the food and drinks don't equate to a 4/5, the service and ambiance of Feast warrants a 4.

Bloody Marie's we had while we waited were good but the Duke & Duchess cocktails were basically tall glasses so juice. All around, not the best drinks.

It was served in a stainless steel martini glass, which was a nice touch. After my cab, I decided to have the same drink and it was amazing with a dried strawberry at the bottom to finish it off with a little sweetness.

Like picking my favorite child, I feel a little guilty, but other SA restaurants, I love you, too! The PEI Harissa mussels are my favorite thing to eat. They come swimming in a green Harissa broth that's a little spicy, but mostly herby and flavorful. There's also toasted slices of bread, and frankly, I could make a meal out of just sopping the broth up with the bread and it still might be one of my favorite meals ever. This is a definite small plates place, and one of the reasons I love it is that I'm a social eater. I want to order enough for the table to have a bite of everything on the menu. Feast is the best place in San Antonio for that. Everyone at the table always orders the mac and cheese and it's ok because you'll have multiple orders and it's so good that no one regrets it. The lamb kebabs are spicy and meaty, and an excellent way to balance the extreme creaminess of the mac and cheese. Order them as a pair. The sweet corn fritters are indeed sweet, like little fried cornbreads. Make sure to order the chickpea salad for something lighter and brighter to go with your meal to balance it out. It's easy to get into the decadence of Feast and overlook their excellent vegetable options, but worry not. The veggies are also worth your attention. Brussel sprouts are everywhere now, but don't lose out on the crispy, broiled, caramelized flavor of these. This is one of the first places I realized that they could also be worth writing home about. You get a lot of bang for your buck at Feast. The spare but welcoming motif doesn't detract from the culinary delights and it's a great way to impress an out of towner or a picky foodie. But the food isn't obscurely trendy; it's all very, very good, well composed, and exceptionally delicious."], ["Catherine Z.", "Corn fritters and oysters rock! That's all I had but would come back for round two. Don't be turned off by cheesy Sex and the City decor."], ["Mrs. G.", "We went for the Sunday brunch. This restaurant takes reservations only for parties of 6 and up, and they require a credit card for the reservation because they will charge $100 for no shows.On Friday, I called Feast to make a reservation for Sunday at 12 noon for a party of six. I requested a table outside and I spoke to Leia. She happily confirmed the reservation with me.On Sunday, we arrived at 11:50am, and they seated us at a table inside. I approached the hostess and told her I reserved a table outside. She told me to wait a little bit for a party that had already paid and they were getting ready to leave. After 15 minutes, no one came to follow up. Needless to say, we sat at the table indoors for 45 minutes, ordered mimosas, and even ordered brunch before they moved us to the table outside. We had to approach the hostess 5 times in order to get someone to finally seat us outside as we originally requested. I asked for Leia, and she pretty much blew me off. We requested to speak with the owner, but he was a NO SHOW. Apparently, Feast asks the customer to be accountable for their reservation by providing a credit card, yet they do not hold up their end of the bargain.Once we sat outside, service deteriorated even more. There is no question this place is very poorly managed. There is no communication among the staff, and they are all running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. We asked to speak to the owner a second time. We never met him...We arrived at 11:50am and we left at 2:30pm and we had reservations.It's a shame this place is so poorly ran because the food is pretty good, and SA is definitely lacking good brunch places. We will not return to this restaurant ever again, and I am pretty sure it will go out of business if it does not change management. It's too bad because all these new restaurants in SA have been impressive until we went to Feast. Bliss is incredible and consistent, and La Frite is also a great place to enjoy.Major disappointment.

I had a hard time choosing what to order, but I'm not sure if that is because the descriptions of the items were a little vague or if it was because of the menu's unconventional layout (pretty but just slightly awkward due to its unfamiliar nature). Ultimately, I went with the corn fritters as recommended by previous reviewers and the mac and cheese, 'cause it is always a classic. My wife ordered fried oysters and a butter lettuce salad. The salad, oysters and fritters were great but the mac and cheese fell short! Oh, well. Sometimes the classics are better done simply at home rather than done up at a restaurant. The service was friendly and attentive though slightly scattered between a few different employees. And I enjoyed the somewhat cheesy decor, though the clear plastic chairs were one step too far down that road. You'll enjoy this place. Check it out."], ["Trevor L.", "Food was really good. Small portions, but everything was great. Ate everything on the plate. Tuna poke was great. One change I would make, music was really loud.

I am not in love with the look...but it is fun...the outside is nice. We spent Easter Sunday there and enjoyed a yummy brunch. A Fried Egg Sandwich sans chorizo for our vegetarian, The Omelet with Brussels Sprouts and Swiss Chard, and the SA Breakfast for the husband. Feast is always a good bet. Other brunches we've had the Blueberry pancakes. OMG!!!! that is a treat you will not want to miss. And their toast is yummy.For dinner in the past we have had cocktails...YUM! The King is my favorite....or is my favorite the the Jester...or maybe the Queen...no...I am not an alcoholic...I just love a beautifully made cocktail! We have also enjoyed the Prince Edward Island Mussels, The Cornmeal Fried Oysters, The Brussels Sprouts, the Sweet Corn Fritters, Jack Cheese Mac, and more. It is always good. Our foodie friends know we will always be rewarded there, with consistently great food."], ["Monique M.", "Great food, wonderful atmosphere, and a really enjoyable meal with friends. We were recommended by waitress to order 2-3 plates each person. Almost ordered the whole menu. Plates I really liked: goat shoulder!, lamb kabobs, grilled endive, pork lettuce wraps, and mussels. Food slowly comes out when ready so you eat for a long time, which makes you full before all of the food has arrived. Only downfalls, slower food than I would like and EVERYTHING is spicy not just the spicy column on the menu. A tad unnecessary. Must order a Moscow mule from the bar. Yummy."], ["Mike W.", "This was my first time at a tapas style restaurant and it was awesome! Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite was Shishito peppers with chorizo. Some of our dishes included the mussels, lamb kebabs, lettuce wraps, bibb lettuces, and pork belly. We even had the waiter pick out some random mystery dishes and they were all great. It's actually making me hungry just thinking about them! They change items on the menu periodically. The restaurant itself has a very modern chic decor done well and was about half full with customers so we didn't need a reservation. It has some tables out on the sidewalk, but it was too humid when we were there to eat outside. It's a place I highly recommend to stop in and try some of the dishes, you won't be disappointed. It can great a little pricey if you have a group like we did and had about 12 dishes or so plus wine and drinks."]], "Bite": [["Daniel W.", "Mmmm bite! I like I like, first visit today and I think you've gained a customer for a long while.. Arrived a, little before 12 and was greeted immediately by whom I presume is the manager in a warm, friendly manner as if I was a lifetime patron. House music/ electronic filled the air and the somewhat eclectic ambiance of the place that is no particular style of its own but rather a vast assortment of different tastes. But enough about the decor, my gf and I proceeded to look at the brunch and normal menu as well as their daily specials which all sounded amazing.. Saw several items leaving the kitchen that looked super delish as well as the crazy drinks coming from the bar, but no alcohol for this morning. We settled on an asparagus tomato omlette and a spanish chorizo frittata. And also a cup of coffee. While we waited the brought out an amuse bouche of bacon wrapped brussel sprouts which were good, hard to have something not good when bacon is involved. After scarfing it down, and enjoying the coffee our food arrived, the omlette was delicious, moist, not overcooked and well seasoned. My frittata was amazing, the spanish chorizo was nicely salty, the hollandaise was nicely made, and the cheese was melted which to me as a big deal. All in all a fabulous meal, with no complaints from me. Only positives today, thank you Bite.Yours truly, A future regular"], ["Shawna S.", "We went to this swanky little place for Brunch on a Sunday. Normally you would think \"eggs are eggs, breakfast is breakfast. Nothing special about Brunch\" but NO!! My husband and I both ordered specials not on the brunch menu, a sandwich and pan seared salmon. That breakfast sandwich was one of the best things to ever enter my mouth! Steak so tender it melted, bread (with the crust cut off) smeared in a delicious butter and herb sauce, bacon, fluffy eggs, tomato - it was to DIE for! My husbands salmon with roasted veggies and I think Polenta (sorry I dont remember...) he said was absolutely divine! \u00a0The mimosa was fun ($8.00). Came with some goofy snacks on it, a mini doughnut, a black raspberry, a sucker in the straw, a cookie (that was stale), fruit loops and I think a cinnamon gummy (I didnt eat it). This tiny little, somewhat crowded, place it so fun and bright. Make sure you check out the bathrooms also :p The only reason I didnt give a full five stars was service. Though the gentleman was nice, we had one guy for the food and another for the drinks (at least I think, thats all the second guy asked about). The first guy spent all his time talking to the \"valued customers\", as he referred to them, next to us, making us wait for a pretty excessive amount of time after we were done eating to be able to ask for our bill.

The manager, who's name I can't remember :( , was nothing but kind, courteous, and just plain adorable! Right down to his matching apron and crocs he was detail oriented and aimed not only to please but to exceed any expectations we may have had. The Bloody Mary was absolutely divine! I mean it had a pizza roll and a cheeto on it, among many other treasures, what more could you ask for?!

Portions here are small, but what the plates lacked in size they made up for with respectable flavor. We ordered the duck and salmon entrees with spinach risotto, the goat cheese ravioli as an appetizer, and I tried a clementine wheat brew. The entrees themselves were tasty, my one criticism of the risotto being its texture: globby versus pasty (the wife does not agree). The goat cheese ravioli seemed a waste of money, and my beer was warm but nonetheless a regional goody that I never tried while living near Boston. We left hungry (I repeat) and dropped about $60 but you know what? We will go back. This seems like a place worth revisiting. The pyromaniac inside of me wants to pay $8 for that flambe dessert, just to see the banana go aflame."], ["Lenny T.", "My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Bite while visiting SA for our anniversary. Wow! \u00a0What an experience!I called ahead to reserve a table, which they had ready and waiting. The place has some great decor, big fans of the boldly colored TP. \u00a0We started with cocktails which were handcrafted within eyesight. \u00a0Really good booze content unlike the tourist traps at the river walk. \u00a0The only slight issue was a bit of plastic from a broken ingredients container ended up in my wife's glass. No big deal, we let them know and they comped her beverage. \u00a0We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and later split an entree. \u00a0We had the escargot, the lobster spring roll, and the mussels. \u00a0Oh my God!The spring roll, while small in portion size, had so much flavor. \u00a0The lobster was cooked perfectly, it was not rubbery. \u00a0The \"earth clams\" were equally perfectly prepared. \u00a0Nice and garlicky. \u00a0The star of our night was definitely the mussels. They must be using steroids because the were huge! \u00a0Nice and plump and cooked in that addictively rich broth. I am not embarrassed to admit we asked for an extra serving of bread so we could mop up as much of it as we could. They should bottle that stuff!After a second round of drinks, which included a specialty made with fresh juice and pop rocks, we split the ropa. \u00a0The bag came pinched close with a tiny clothes hanger and we proceeded to rip it open and devour it's delicious contents. \u00a0White beans, sausage, fish, plump shrimp and even more mussels. \u00a0Delicious!Sadly we had no room for desert. \u00a0Service was excellent without being overly intrusive.

Paella was a generous delight, and creme brulee was surprisingly good, from someone who tends to think this dessert menu staple doesn't offer many ways to stand out.

Conceptually, all dishes made sense, but executed poorly. Lobster roll was okay, but void of any flavor. No comment on the lamb cigar. We also ordered Penne Pasta with mushrooms and sausage. So many things to say here: the dish was accompanied with hangar steak and potatoes. Yes, inside the dish with the pasta. The sausage consisted of chopped up sausage links, and tasted as if it had been frozen. Split pea soup was the highlight of the night.

Definitely a memorable meal."], ["Lindsay R.", "BITE is full of little touches I didn't know were missing from my life until I came here. How can I ever go back to white toilet paper now that I know blue and red are possibilities? I came home so full of disdain for my uninspiring bathroom. I also came home full of boozy brunch goodness. The decor in here is gorgeous, bright, and playful. It's modern, but doesn't take itself too seriously. It's small and intimate. I got there right as they opened on a Sunday for brunch and scored a table easily, but it's in your best interest to reservation up here, as they get packed shortly thereafter. It's worth it. It's French cuisine, well executed and whimsical. Think escargot and mussels. I went with the Build Your Own Bloody Mary bar because if you give me a customizable option, I'm going to take it. The strapping fellas at the bar gave me a choice of vodkas, recommending the Reyka. I may like to customize, but I don't usually question the experts. They poured me my vodka, and I went to town adding a classic mix of spicy Bloody Mary mix, celery salt, worcestershire sauce, green olives, and a big fat fresh mushroom. Around a nice green stalk of celery, of course. I went tame, but they have all kinds of options like meats and cheese, peppers, other veggies, pretzels, and for the truly daring, some puffed cheese balls (like cheetos) I'm still kicking myself for not adding. I thought I'd go back for another one! Instead, I ended up with the truly intriguing and dessert-worthy chocolate covered banana martini. But I'll be back for you cheese balls! Food wise, we got a refreshing and light amuse bouche of melon and prosciutto to start our meal while we looked over the menu. It was the perfect juicy, salty start when it was already hot as blazes outside. A good San Antonio restaurant knows how to cool you down when the temperatures are raging outside. They had a special of crab topped eggs benedict that I went for with gusto. I feel obligated to try the eggs benedict at any new brunch stop before I branch out. It comes with veggies like carrots, potatoes, and green beans that are toasty, roasty, and tasty. Unfortunately, they forgot the crab on my bennies, but it was quickly rectified when I brought it to their attention. The spanish fritatta also comes smothered in hollandaise, so if you're not feeling the english muffin action, go for that. We stayed and chatted for a couple of hours, and the service was impeccable. The servers were really charming and attentive. I can't wait to come back here and bring friends. The dinner menu looks incredible, so I'll be back for that as well.

I worked in the service industry for 12 years and there is no way I'd ever be as oblivious as their waiter.

We had to ask to order drinks, which then took another 10 minutes to arrive. My friend ordered a coffee and it didn't come out for 45 minutes! When we inquired, the waiter repeated how busy they were.The Bloody Mary was fancifully dressed but lacked the bite of hot sauce or horseradish. I also question if the bartender remembered the vodka.When our food finally arrived, it was nothing to write home about. The stuffed French toast was a little dry and the frittata was underwhelming in flavor, size and aesthetic.The best thing about this place was the decor and the restroom.

It had no sides, just the \"cigar\" (ground lamb wrapped in phyllo, deep fried) with dipping sauces.The eggs benedict were average, on par with a decent hotel breakfast.The \"Belgian\" waffle was a disappointment. It wasn't Belgian, first off, being thin and flat. Second, it had a rubbery, chewy texture, which isn't how a good waffle should be. It was also bland.The two of us shared three dishes and we left hungry, and paid too much.

And the manager is quite friendly! :)"], ["Luke D.", "After reading all these reviews, even the bad, I had to come see for myself what this place was all about. Walking in to the booming, busy, cool restaurant, I was greeted nicely by the very professional bartender. I was lucky to get a seat and knew I should have probably made a reservation, but it didn't matter. The food and service were impeccable. I would have asked for better service, but i was being picky. This place is amazing and always booming, so I couldn't expect more than the great service I was already receiving. I hate to be crude, but it is worth adding... After my appetizer(the amazing puerto banus crostini plate), I had to take a break to the men's room. I was in shock from how amazing a restroom experience could be. Runway models walking on a tv, the coolest colored toilet paper I've ever seen, and a nice sink to wash my hands and mirror to make sure I didn't have food in my teeth. As I made it back to my table, my food was awaiting me. Butter poached lobster cooked to PERFECTION! I ate it way too quickly, but I was so satisfied. The great waiter that served me, Julien, gave a mix of charming humor and professionalism giving me the information I needed and trusting homey feel I needed to trust his judgement. It's a good thing I did, because he insisted I finish my meal off with the churros with vanilla bean Ice cream. After polishing off that plate, I couldn't move for a few moments. That's when the chef walked out, Lisa. As beautiful as could be, she greeted me with a smile and I thanked her for everything. In short, from the food, to the service, to the hospitality, to the bathrooms, I felt like I was in a home I never thought I wanted.

Though every other place was packed, Bite was smart and took reservations only for Valentine's Day, which made it exceptionally easy to get in and seated quickly. Our table had cool, modern photos facing up that we had to turn over to get the menu. I would have liked the pictures more if one of them wasn't a girl with the nicest bottom ever on full display. I guess my husband needed his own Valentine's Day gift, eh, Bite? I digress. From here on out, it was pure bliss at Bite. Our waiter provided our drinks in a flash - I had a Bite-tini and the esposo had a beer. The menu for the evening was a choice of three prix-fixe menus - everything on it was amazing. From the salmon crostini to the lobster bisque to the steak to the bananas flambee to the raspberry lemon cheesecake we shared, nothing was awful. Great ambience - not too pretentious and not too shabby. Great staff. Great food. The prices weren't outrageous, either. We had a blast and enjoy this spot as often as we can now.

They have a build your own Bloody Mary bar. Now pay close attention boys and girls, you choose your vodka (Grey Goose for me please!) and then add a whole assortment of different options to make your Bloody Mary exactly to your liking. If you don't want to the bartender will make it for you, and boy does he do a great job. My blood mary had spicy tomato sauce, chalua, cherry tomato, bbq potato chip, banana pepper, jalapeno slice, celery, pretzel stick and lil smokie sausage. Yeah, you're reading that correctly. Needless to say the drink was amazing and I had two.We ordered the lamb cigar which is a mixture of lamb wrapped in an almost philo like dough and fried. Served with a chimichuri and aoli it was very good. My eggs benedict came with potatoes and veggies and all was great. I can't wait to see how this brunch evolves or the different things they'll add to the Bloody Mary Bar.

I ordered a special they had for the evening - chicken piccata, and it was incredibly disappointing. \u00a0I saw it sitting in the window (that lacks a heat lamp to keep food warm) for a bit while my husband's dish was being prepared, so it arrived cold. \u00a0Not only that, but it was just a grilled chicken breast sliced up and sat atop some sauce. \u00a0The chicken was dry and had no flavor nor was there enough sauce on the plate to fix it. \u00a0The pappardelle it was served with was also cold, overcooked, and under sauced. \u00a0I'm sure you're asking why I didn't send it back. \u00a0We already waited 45 minutes for the entree in the first place, I wasn't willing to wait again when the technique was flawed - a warm dish would not fix dry and flavorless chicken nor overcooked pasta.... \u00a0Maybe we'll try the acclaimed brunch, but I'm not too keen on returning at this point."], ["N D.", "Interesting blend of interior art and fixtures, but sorely lacking in the good food department.

That's when we met their manager/bartender who made us some great mary's but assured us we were missing out by not coming on Sunday's when they brought out all the stops in their make your own bloody mary bar. Wait...whaaaaat? My S/O and I looked wide-eyed at each other. We'd run across this once before in Austin at the now destroyed, yet to be all new Highball and thought it was a brilliant idea and wondered why no one in San Antonio had done this yet. Well, here we are and here it is!! Wednesday, I tried their steak tartare because since Luke, there hasn't been a place yet to rival the steak tartare from there or Comme Ca in Vegas and no I am not a fan of Liberty Bar's. \u00a0Well...once again...broke through to the other side! All I can say is wow! Flavor, oh sweet, scrumptious flavor! You just have to try it. Sunday comes around and we headed back to BITE to try this make your own bloody mary bar and sure enough, the manager remembered us and greeted us with a warm \"hello/welcome back\" when we walked in. After picking our poison (Grey Goose) the BM bar contained all the usual chomps you've come to expect but then, there they were...the other bites of awesome you could add such as little smokies, cherry peppers, chipotle soaked pickles, even long pretzel sticks, popcorn, Funyuns, and corn nuts! How fun!! We decided to share the lamb cigar but then as we looked on the board the crab benedict sounded way yummy and I figured this was as good a time as any to try any sort of eggs benedict (1st timer) so we got that as well. Once again...amazing flavor, amazing food and most importantly amazing and very friendly service, which is sometimes rare to find for a high-end restaurant. Best thing: Unpretentious and cozy, amazing service, amazing food and awesome bloody mary's. Side note: The ladies bathroom is also awesome with crazy colored toilet paper! Hey...it's the little things! hahaWorst thing: Not much other than it being a small space and the regular menu that contains the steak tartare is NOT, I repeat NOT available during brunch. They have a special brunch menu to chose from with lots of great eats."], ["Jasmin D.", "Small plates, big taste. Try the steak tartare, lobster spring roll, and the goat cheese and olives.

One of us ordered eggplant soup, which came fairly quickly. It was more like gravy than soup and decidedly not hot. A bad start. Then we drank and waited at least half an hour for the rest of the service. I had a mushroom omelet that was horribly overcooked, with mushrooms that were tough and occasionally sandy. My wife had a chicken in a crepe, or something like that. Three times more chicken than needed; sometimes less is really more. One of our companions and the \"lamb cigar\" which was just as gimmicky as you would think, but at least he ate all of it.So none of the food was worth a hoot. It cost a lot of money. It was terribly slow even though the place certainly wasn't packed.

Definitely will return."], ["Marisa P.", "Wanting to have a quiet dinner it was the perfect opportunity to try Bite. \u00a0Located on the edge of King William, Bite is in a very small space. \u00a0They have maximized the space by including a large wrap around bar. \u00a0The concept is to offer entree style plates, but in smaller portions. \u00a0This makes it much easier to try all different items, instead of committing to one plate for the meal. For two people plan on ordering 3 to 4 items to share. \u00a0This is the first place outside of Europe that I have enjoyed escargot served in hot bubbling butter. \u00a0The lamb did not have any type of aftertaste and was seasoned nicely. \u00a0A flattened duck wrapped in bacon disappeared off the table in a matter of seconds. \u00a0The drink menu offers a full bar and a small wine by the glass selection. \u00a0The bottles of wine were very reasonable. \u00a0The only fail in my eyes would be the dessert. \u00a0It was advertised as a \"chocolate blob.\" \u00a0Now, when I hear that I think of chocolate mousse, cream, maybe some cake pieces thrown in or ice cream. \u00a0Not so, it was basically just a brownie with homemade whip cream on it. \u00a0Disappointing. \u00a0The small tables and cushy chairs add to the Euro flair, and the waitstaff are super friendly and will explain anything on the menu. \u00a0Ah, the menu--just a laminated piece of paper---for such a cool environment maybe the menu could be on a small chalkboard or something quirky. \u00a0I look forward to dining at Bite again, this place has some really solid food choices and is overall just a fun place to hang out."], ["Sarah F.", "The waiter was friendly and engaging. \u00a0We had an overpriced bowl of gazpacho that was tasty but small , and had a huge blob of whipped cream in it that was bigger than the amount of soup. \u00a0No crackers or bread.

So hard."], ["Zain R.", "Upon arrival we had to wait to be seated. Nobody approached us as we waited at the entrance. We came here for Sunday brunch and so during the Texas heat it's kind if hard to see what's inside. After my eyes finally acclimated to the inside I was able to enjoy the subpar modern feel with bright orange and metallic grey inside with ikea furniture. I had the chicken porcini crepe which was the redeeming quality of the brunch. The Bloody Mary looked like it was made for Barnum & Bailey's. It came with an assortment of things ranging from cheese and sausage to a cheese puff and a funyon. Redemption: it somehow worked and tasted amazing. The coffee was probably the best I have ever had on all my trips to San Antonio. Unfortunately, the service was not. Maybe it would have been better if we would have been greeted and gotten a table but we were bound to the confines of the bar and to the devices of the bartender. In his defense, he was overworked and had to bus tables but I just think that no one should ever have to ask for water when dining in, it should be something that should be served - no questions asked. All in all the food was good. The pricing and the ambience was probably appropriate for the 'real housewives of San Antonio.' My friend used the ladies restroom and she said the toilet paper smelled like cheap potpourri. For her sake, we hope she doesn't get a yeast infection. This place could be described as affectatious, unoriginal, and basic at best."], ["Mark H.", "A new restaurant in South Town? \u00a0Let's give it a shot. \u00a0Bite purports to offer an experience where patrons get to enjoy a variety of dishes without having to endure the 'tapas' or 'small plate' style of dining. \u00a0They also strive for high food quality with a menu that doesn't necessarily intimidate guests. \u00a0When we visited a few weeks after Bite officially opened its doors, my wife and I enjoyed our experience. \u00a0The interior setting was cozy. \u00a0The table tops wrap around the space along the windows with the bar top separating the main dining areas from the kitchen. \u00a0There are a few tables outside. \u00a0Management is still working on what their finished feel will be but this is probably due to being new.We enjoyed the menu design such that there are a number of standards and an equal number of daily/weekend specials. \u00a0From the regular menu, we were told to try the lobster spring roll. \u00a0It consisted of four pieces of roll which was prepared with a crispy fried wrapper you'd come to expect and the interior wrapped in bacon. \u00a0But the lobster was cooked just right and had good flavor even though it was somewhat unusual.Our entrees consisted of the steak tartare (standard menu) and the paella (special). \u00a0Again, the tartare didn't compare to that of our baseline, Gilt Bar in Chicago, but it was still damn good. \u00a0The paella was not traditional, having white fish, salmon, mussels, shrimp, and chorizo all in a 'longer-than-traditional-paella'-grain rice. \u00a0It was imparted with more of a seafood flavor and we didn't detect much saffron but it stood up. \u00a0That said we would order it again if it was still on the menu. \u00a0Variety is the spice of life anyway, right?The wine list was short but sufficient and the bartender (Connor?) delivered a few solid cocktails. \u00a0Lisa was attentive and very nice. \u00a0It's so great to have someone like her open a restaurant in South Town and we can't wait to visit again! \u00a0If you are looking for the perfectly polished place for a special night out, you may give Bite a few more weeks to get its feet under it. \u00a0If you want to really enjoy a great scene, attentive service, and some fun food, make your reservations now! \u00a0We will see you there!"], ["Danielle P.", "Upon my first time dining here, I ordered a Bloody Mary (though you can build your own at the bar) and a burger from the specials listed on the chalkboard. My server was the bartender though I wasn't seated at the bar. Her service was mediocre at best. The true personal service I received was from the owner. He was attentive, knowledgeable, provided recommendations of the menu, politely engaged in conversation and was kind enough to bring me a bite size sample of an appetizer. If it wasn't for his recommendation of the burger, I would have never known there was specials listed on the chalkboard located near the bar since it's not advertised anywhere on the menu and my server failed to mention nor ask if it was my first time visiting. Regardless, I can truly say this burger is unparalleled. The Bloody Mary was equally as impressive. Only fault is the service of my original server/bartender."], ["Gloria C.", "If acoustic Adele in a swanky bathroom (with multi-colored paper towels) doesn't get you excited, you can't sit with us. Bathroom jokes aside, I was overall impressed with my experience at Bite. \u00a0I ventured over during Restaurant Week (the best opportunity to try a little bit of everything), and was glad I made a reservation. This spot is teeny tiny, so I'd bet that reservations are probably a good idea on any night, unless there's just one or two folks in your group, then a spot at the bar will suit you just fine. It's pretty close quarters, so if you and yours tend to be a lively bunch, you might have to tone it down. They have legit cocktails! A short list, but the three out of four that we sipped were spot-on and refreshing. Think St. Germaine, Lillet, Chartreuse - things like that. Same situation with the wine list, it's not expansive, but offers plenty of variety without being overwhelming. With multiple $30 bottle offerings, it's a steal. We had a nice Tempranillo. Eating is an adventure here, and not for the close-minded. Mussels and escargot are not things I typically crave, but I was feeling frisky, and was sold after one bite of these buttery, savory dishes. I kind of forgot everything else we ate. Except the lobster spring roll, which should be a precursor to any meal. The entrees listed online for RW ended up not being the same once we got there, but no biggie, the offerings were plentiful. Lastly, the churros were cinnamon clouds of deliciousness. It's a spendy place, but worth it for memorable get-togethers or romantic evenings!"], ["Ashley C.", "I hate to say it but we were so disappointed in this place. Just had brunch there, our first (and likely only) visit. The place is tiny and fun and hip and the staff is great. The mimosas and Bloody Marys are works of art to look at and they taste great. But the food was not impressive. Hubby had the Croque Madame and it was dry and not much above something I could make at home. The salad that came with it was yummy but salty. I don't need my salads to be salty. I ordered the Belgian waffle and was so disappointed when it came covered in chocolate sauce, berries and whipped cream. Perhaps they should put a description on the menu, unless that's the way most people expect them to be. For me, that's dessert, not breakfast. And either way, it wasn't that good. It sucks to pay $45 + tip for a meal you didn't enjoy. :("], ["Chavah A.", "I have heard of the new eateries in Southtown but didn't think they were worth rushing down to check 'em out.

Are they giant Mexican food platter? No, but they are perfect portions. Let it be known that I am a French Culinary Institute trained chef. The food was PHENOMENAL. Everything was cooked perfectly and beautifully plated. The only \"meh\" aspect were the desserts we tried. They weren't bad, but definitely not the same \"wow\" factor as the rest of the food. The crab croquettes, lobster roll, escargot, and paella were fantastic, and I highly recommend them all. The restaurant is very small and quiet, but not in a pretentious way. I'd recommend making a reservation on a weekend, to be safe. The women's bathroom was really fun. Take a look ;-) I recommend this place with flying colors.

Sadly, it was a slow down hill ride from there. We had the special soup...oyster and asparagus , and the unusual and well-executed eggplant waffle; they were the highlights of the evening. The lobster roll tasted totally like a tough hot dog! OK we weren't too discouraged, we had two pretty darn good apps. Our entrees...the aforementioned lamb... we were assured the chef cooked it med. rare and I'm sure it was MR at some point in the evening, but certainly not once it was re-heated and plated and served to us, grey and tough. The soft shell crab tempura...one medium crab for $21, overcooked and barely discernible crab flavor. The pork confit...simple braised pork butt...hard to mess up. So of 6 dishes two were really good. There are about 10 tables including outdoor patio; there were two staff members acting as host, server, bartender, busser, food runner. Our water was rarely re-filled, one of our dishes fell through the cracks and was served 10 minutes after the others and drink rounds arrived late. We wanted to love this place, we were excited at the thought of another innovative spot in SA, but the execution just wasn't there.

I'm kinda sad we live so far away! All the more reason to visit San Antonio, right? We came for our first visit during brunch and then returned later in the week for dinner. For brunch we shared the Tiritas de Atn first. Oh my. Yellow fin tuna marinated in lime juice and roasted habaneros, shredded vegetables, olive oil, cilantro. It was so delicious. I loved every bite and I was sad when it was gone. Then I had the Huevos Motuleos. \u00a0A quesadilla de queso and ham, topped with a fried egg, salsa de tomate, black beans, queso fresco. All the flavors worked well together and the runny eggs were perfect. Hubby got the sincronizada- Scrambled eggs, ham, Oaxaca cheese, avocado, crema on a mexican birote roll. He didn't talk at all through the first half of his sandwich, it was that good. We ended up swapping half way through so we could try each others food. I also had the Marquitos to drink - Tamarind, pineapple & lime juice shaken together with Monte Alb\u00e1n Blanco tequila finished with a splash of grapefruit soda which was light and refreshing. He had the El Sano -Strawberries, fresh ginger, carrot & orange Juice extraction shaken with Chef's Casa Noble Single Barrel Blanco Tequila. They were out of carrot juice so they subbed strawberry lime aquas for the carrot juice. We also got tamarind and strawberry aquas to go. The service was outstanding. The food was amazing. We started looking at the other yelp photos and decided we needed to try dinner here. Since we ordered margaritas off the happy hour menu we had some complimentary chips covered in hot sauce and salty white cheese- perfect with my mango and cantaloupe rita. Then we shared the Tiritas de atn - Tuna, marinated in sour orange, roasted habaneros. I could have eaten this alone for dinner. It's amazing. The flavors are beautiful and fresh. I loved this dish. We also shared the Quesadilla - Huitlacoche, Pollo o Puerquito, pico de gallo, crema. This was good but the cheese really over powered the truffled corn and it was lost. I wouldn't order it again. I had the Huitlacoche con rajas y salsa de elote - Corn truffles with roasted poblanos, sweet corn cream, queso fresco, crema. This dish is small but packs some serious flavor. If you love corn this is for you! I would order this again. Hubby ordered Puerco en mole blancoPork Belly with aromatic spices in a chile and white chocolate sauce with pine nuts and almonds. He loved this dish. I was barely able to get a bite before he inhaled it. Then he proceeded to wipe the bowl clean with the corn tortillas they provided and looked sad when it was all gone. We shared the chocolate chile cake for dessert with fresh whipped cream and berries. It was the perfect ending to the meal. The service was lovely for dinner as well. I had made a reservation through open table but actually didn't really need one because it wasn't too crazy on a Monday night. I will be back the next time I am in town. I loved everything, especially the tuna dishes and the beautiful cocktails. I can't wait to dine here again!"], ["Caitlyn S.", "The Fruteria - Botanero isn't lying when they say they have small plates.

Our server was friendly, attentive, and made conversation with us throughout our time here. She was helpful and offered suggestions of what to order as well.Our table of three shared a few of the dishes, although since the plates are small, it's not an ideal way of ordering. The guacamole was yummy, the Huitlacoche con rajas y salsa de elote were delicious, and my husband's Puerco en mole blanco was interesting and flavorful as well. The white chocolate addition was intriguing to me, so I had to try a bite! Our drinks were fabulous as well. The pi\u00f1acate is SO GOOD. You must order this drink. It's creamy and refreshing and perfect.Overall, this is a great place to sit and enjoy a few bites with friends.

We were not crazy about this; it was raw tuna, which isn't my jam. \u00a0 Drinks: \u00a0Pi\u00f1acate - This is the most delicious unique mixed drink I have had in quite some time. \u00a0 This included citrus fruit, pineapple and avocado with Herradura Single Barrel. \u00a0SO GOOD!

My favorite dish is the tuna tostadas (sashimi-quality lime-marinated tuna with avocado cream, pickled vegetables, cilantro and olive oil)- it's super fresh and light for a great lunch!Service is reliably quick and friendly.

We ordered the pork belly with white mole which was honestly awesome, although it was the tiniest little portion (of course no one needs much pork belly, but it was a truly tiny portion). \u00a0We also had the beet salad which was fun, with shaved beets. \u00a0Lastly we tried the chicken tinga gordita which honestly wasn't very good - the chicken was fine but there was something off about the gordita, it possibly was fried in not very clean oil. \u00a0All-in-all our meal was pretty good, but not too mind-blowing."], ["Deborah M.", "Brunch menu is limited, but you don't need much else but the chilaquiles (ask for the extra egg on top).

I've heard bits and pieces about her from ppl I know and trust but I never quite got the chance to meet her. As of just the other day, that ALL changed. This place is a cool ethnic little spot that both uppeties and regulars common in Southtown. It has a colorful vibrant decor and the staff all seem open and willing to meet any reasonable requests. I came with a work buddy for lunch and we split everything. I began with a \"Que Fresa\" drink since I LOVE strawberries, \u00a0pineapple and OJ and it did not disappoint. My first gulp had me wide eyed with delightful surprise making my buddy try it to confirm its level of deliciousity. (I know I made up that word.) He obliged me and agreed enthusiastically. I tried his \"Buenos Dias\" drink and his was a different kind of good. His was like the equivalent of a tasty yet healthy breakfast like oatmeal but in liquid form. The almonds and honey dominate the palate but it is still a very light and not overly sweet beverage. So far so good.We ordered some appetizers, the Tiritas de Atun Tostada and the chips n guac. The former is tuna marinated in lime juice with avocado cream and shredded vegetables. \u00a0Everything was very fresh and the tuna was especially good. The guac for me was not nearly what I'd hoped for based on all the reviews but it was satisfactory. I enjoyed that they put some queso fresco atop the guac.By the time our Tortas came to the table we had already downed quite a bit so we paced ourselves for the remainder of our meal. I ordered the Roasted Chicken en Adobo which was phenomenal. I mainly say this because it tasted just like my Mom made it. The crema they use here is top notch stuff. Its not that cheap crap at HEB that I've tried. The chicken was so so tender and the spices with Adobo were very flavorful. My buddy ordered the Carne de res but we both agreed while it was alright, it was nowhere as good as my Torta.

Fruit infused into anything and everything. I'm down.Maybe I liked it so much because I'm from out of town, caught up in the majestic haze of the exotic. And by exotic, I mean somewhere in the middle of San Antonio during a trip for work. But the Fruteria was different than anything we have in Orlando. The restaurants menu, dare I say it, is playful. But at the same time, warm and familiar. Many of the items are things you'd traditionally find at a Mexican or Tex-Mex place, but somehow made more interesting or flavorful by the Power of Fruit. And their drinks... their fruit-infused, alcoholic wonderfulnessiocity or some other word that doesn't exist yet. Those are worth going for alone, I think. Definitely treat this like a tapas place and split small plates with a friend or two, because you'll want to try a little of everything. Plus you might need someone to drive you home... because their drinks are awesome, did I mention that?"], ["Ohmela S.", "The drinks are so good! The atmosphere is really relaxing for a date.

Now it is not your usual fruteria by any means and since it is a johnny Hernandez establishment, \u00a0it shouldn't be expected at all. The decor is very rustic mexican fusion. Consider El machito meets la gloria but with a Southtown twist. The menu is pretty simple yet eclectic ingredients. We started off with la mula. This is a mezcal based drink with blueberry and lime juice. Comes with a blueberry flavored Chile on the glass rim. Yummy is an understatement since the smoked oaky flavor of mezcal is goes great with blueberries while adding some acidity with lime. \u00a0Must try it out. The Agua Fresca selection was the same from la gloria so we skipped it. Ordered a chicken tinga tostada for appetizer which had a great balance of flavor with refreshing Fresca cheese on top. For the main course, I ordered the roasted chicken en adobo torta which was definitely good. The only thing off balance was the meat to veggie. It actually had more meat which I guess is a good thing. It was toasted and definitely balanced the crunch with sauce and ingredients. My advice is to let it sit for a few seconds for the bread to soak up the flavor. My friend tried the vegetarian tostada and praised it for the flavor too. She said the black beans were right on.We ended with a mandatory fruit cup. Fresh cut fruit with their own Chile and lime made it a perfect yet not too heavy meal.

For a place calling itself \"The Fruteria\" they only had four fruits available for a fruit cocktail out of all the fruits listed on their menu. The waitress simply stated that they don't have all the items that are listed on the menu. I chose the fruit cocktail made with fresh fruit and your choice of yogurt or sweet cream, I chose sweet cream. It came with yogurt, it had a definite aftertaste, similar to yogurt made with artificial sweeteners, something I always avoid. When I brought this to the waitress' attention she shrugged it off and said the kitchen staff must have made it really fast since I they close in 10 min. This was at 2:50 pm on a Saturday. \u00a0 I paid $9 for something that was made half-a**ed for lack of a better term. Perhaps they should rename their restaurant to something without fruit in the title since it seems to be an afterthought."], ["Aide M.", "The food was good, the waitress was nice, however, I found the prices to be high for the amount of food. \u00a0We went there for dinner, and I guess it is supposed to be an appetizer kind of place, which I didn't know before.

It is located in a part of town that in earlier days, I would have avoided at all costs, but has dramatically improved in recent years. The decor of the restaurant is pretty hip too. We were seated under a giant metal fruit tree. The concept of the restaurant is pretty neat: by day, it is a fruteria, and by night, a botanero. I haven't been for the daytime portion, but I really love the botanero part: goodbye gigantic portioned entrees, hello small plates! All of the options on the menu are small portions and perfect for sharing. An individual can maybe eat one or two, but it is definitely more fun to bring a group and order several! There were so many tasty options too. My favorites are the tiritas de atun, which is similar to tuna sashimi with a citrusy sauce and little tortilla chip cups, the huitlacoche con rajas y salsa de elote, which were like little tamales stuffed with rajas, and the beef tenderloin. We ordered more options, but everything was delicious! Well, all of the savory entrees. I wasn't too in love with the dessert options, though of the three, the bread pudding was the best.

The salads are delicious, and a good size. But for lunch I tend to order a torta. I have had both the vegetarian and the tuna one. They are both really good. I really like the bread that they use and the potato chips are really good, too. My favorite items on the \"botana\" menu at night is the beet salad and ceviche. I have never been a big fan of ceviche but this one is so good! A friend of mine ordered it and I loved it. I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinks. I do not like strong drinks.

The Escabeche de verduras (pickled vegetables) and the Tiritas de at\u00fan (tuna in sour orange and habanero) were tasty. The Chiles anchos con pollo (ancho pepper with shredded chicken) looked impressive but tasted strongly of jarred tomato sauce and (I'm sorry to say this) made me think of cafeteria food. The Puerco en mole blanco (pork belly in white chocolate sauce) was just plain bad. The pork belly was tough and the sauce was horrible. My boyfriend compared it to white chocolate protein powder. I seriously wanted to love this place because I live so close and I'll probably go back to see if they do better at lunch but the dinner was seriously disappointing."], ["Julio G.", "Fruteria is the best of these Johnny H restaurants, I think. The ceviche was good. The camaron cocktail was good except there were like 3 shrimp. The corn chips for the tapas are a little intense.

Not only did I get exactly what I wanted, Cantaloupe Agua Fresca, with unlimited refills, but I also had a delicious crab filled chile Relleno! First, fell in love with the decor, beautiful, bright & artsy. They had these decorative humming birds hanging from the ceiling I so wanted to snag. Nice patio on a warm day, unfortunately, it was a little chilly for the patio. Sat down by a gentleman who delivered a warm smile & a neat little wrought iron \"tree\" to hang my purse on. Loved that! Our waiter was great! Friendly & attentive, steady refilling my Agua Fresca :D The chile Relleno was delicious! It was filled with just the right amount of crab, and cooked to perfection, not overly breaded. The perfect size, delicious smokey flavor & the price was right! Absolutely hit the spot! And the best was when it was time to go, I was so ready to buy a pitcher of the Agua Fresca, asked the waiter if we could get some to go & he brought out to large to go glasses without an additional charge!

While the entrance is actually by the lofts entrance, the staff can see you coming in the wrong way and greet you accordingly.The establishment is beautifully decorated with lots if fruitful colors, with amazing steel cabinets fully stocked with extravagant Tequilas, Rums and other bottles. There is a cool Spanish style back room decorated with barrels which adds a nice rustic feel.Now to the food. Its labeled a Bontana, \u00a0which means small dishes or appetizers. You'll want to order at least something from every section in the menu (5 or more items). Guacamole with jicama and pineapple was served with chef made potato and tortilla chips. We had the shrimp cocktail with mango or pineapple, which lacked a little heat but was still packed with flavor. We also had a chicken tinga inside a red pepper which was drizzled with some amazing red sauce and a line of sour cream maybe. \u00a0Then we had a pork tomatillo sauce with potatoes and corn casserole. \u00a0My momma never made a casserole like that before but it was AMAZING! For drinks we had a nice and spicy michelada. \u00a0I had the aqua frescas. Now they change the beverage all the time, but the strawberry watermelon was well worth the $3 with free refills.

It would be a great starter place to grab some amazingly special drinks some light botanas and continue with a great adventure.Come here often!"], ["Chloe C.", "Really delicious! The servers are always there when you need them and pay attention to their tables. You can't find fresh Mexican street food anywhere else this good. Lunch is probably your best bet with great sandwiches, salads, and small plates. Dinner is a bit more expensive and the portions are small, as it is small plates, not large plates of food typical of Mexican restaurants in SA. A few other reviews stated it's in a \"rundown industrial area,\" which is not true. Tell that to the condos going for $250/sq ft or more upstairs! It's located in the real San Antonio, surrounded by small businesses without any strip malls or chains. The decor, tables, art, furniture, glassware, and plates are all handmade in Mexico. Wonderful drinks, both alcoholic and not. You can sit outdoors if the weather cooperates - the area is covered and has ceiling fans but it is on S. Flores, a busy street, where buses and loud vehicles often pass.

The wait staff is exceptional, and professional.Oh my! The drinks are second to none. I plan on returning and trying everything on the menu."], ["Sandra M.", "Meh is the perfect description.It's a cool, trendy place to be. The drinks are good but nothing amazing. The food is ok, nothing to rave about. All in all, it's ok but not for the price tag. I would recommend instituting a happy hour special of some kind to make the prices worth the food and drinks. I'm sure many will disagree.The location - love the patio and the ability to people watch but parking is a b*tch. I've been here several times and I have to drive up and down the street several times to find an open spot. I recommend eating outside, if given the choice. I recommend going to La Gloria instead. Food:Guacamole - Boo. I heart guacamole and this one didn't cut it. It needed flavor (lime juice, salt or something). It has pieces of mango, pineapple, and grapes. It's exactly as it sounds. Mushed guacamole with chunks of the fruit in it. I had to doctor it up with flavor (and I removed the fruit chunks, ate them separately)Tequila Fundido con Frutas - meh. It was ok. I took a few bites and it was decent but nothing noteworthy. We only ate half of it. Drinks:Tropidulce - (strawberry fruity tequila drink) it was surprisingly dull tasting, I expected an explosion of fruit flavors and a tangy or zesty flavor. Tasted more like a rum based drink. It was ok. Sounded better than it tasted. Fruteria Infusion Margarita - Pretty good. I'd recommend this one. Good balance on the flavors, citrus, and tequila. Jarrito - meh. wasn't a huge fan maybe because of the way it was made. Was missing an ingredient or \"kick\" to the flavor.Los Pepinos - not bad if you like cucumber muddled infusions. Overall, the drinks are decent but would be a better deal if they did a happy hour or cut down the prices. Their infusions are unique and have a lot of potential to be amazing, there just seems to be something missing from several of the drinks.

You could still taste the lime juice squeezed on top, and the avocados were in season. Sometimes you forget how great something can taste when it's at the height of flavor, because guacamole is ubiquitous. But this reminded me of why I fell in love it in the first place. It reignited my affair with guac after maybe I'd taken it for granted. I'm sorry, guacamole. As long as I keep coming to Fruteria, we can keep the romance sparked. I love the ambiance and idea. Summers in San Antonio mean fruit cups and aqua frescas, and this gives me that warm, nostalgic summer feeling in an upscale, adult way. The building is bright and inviting, and full of color, which also reads \"San Anto\" to me. One of my favorite things about this city is we do a candy colored building like no one else. This takes the heritage of San Antonio and shows people that there such a thing as approachable, fresh, upscale Mexican food. Not everything lived up to my expectations after that first glorious encounter with the fresh guacamole, though. My chicken tinga gordita was dry, though, and there were bones in the chicken that I didn't expect when I crunched down. I would try again, but this wasn't a great experience. This spot is much better for late night drinks and small plates with friends than dinner. The dishes are mostly small plates, and the drinks are where Fruteria shines. Lots of cocktails channeling those aqua fresca flavors, like watermelon and lime. The drinks are refreshing and light, so watch out, because you can put away quite a few without realizing it."], ["Carrie W.", "What a cute place, a little hard to find even with GPS but worth the search!The waitress was friendly, informative, and patient as she walked us through the menu.

In that regard, I'd say that Fruteria is good--you won't go wrong, but it doesn't 'wow'.On the very good side, the sangria I had was the most authentic anywhere outside of living in Spain. It's not that hard to do wrong, but somewhere everywhere I've tried it manages to get it wrong. But it's right here. And I'd go back for it. Flipping over to my wife's Bloody Mary, I'd say she felt it was just good. As a Bloody Mary snob, she's certainly had her fair share of great ones, and this one fell smack dab in the middle. On the food side, I'd put Fruteria right down the middle. A nice twist on south-of-the-border bar food that has been elevated. The ceviche tostada was average, and I quite enjoyed the chicken tinga. Overall, not sure I'd go out of my way to go back. But if I'm in Southtown with a hankering to try out an innovative Latin-inspired bar menu and snacks, I'll know where to look."], ["Lorena O.", "This is a sister restaurant to La Gloria in San Antonio. \u00a0I really love La Gloria, but I do not love their wait. \u00a0Luckily when I called The Fruteria they said there was no wait for brunch (at 11am). \u00a0The place was easy to find and there was ample parking on the street.

The flavors/ingredients are perfectly balanced. The best part? The prices. \u00a0A meal here is so affordable, so go ahead, order a little extra something :)After my fabulous lunch experience, I went for dinner. There is a more robust menu, offering dishes 'tapa' style. They have some off menu items, so be sure to inquire with your server. I had queso with fruit on top with corn tortillas. The gorditas and chalupitas (shrimp & fruit) were excellent. The best part? The cocktails. I had a cocktail with avocado shaken in it. I was skeptical, but the drink was SO good.

I get what Hernandez is trying to do here--and it's executed well--but I would expect a slightly lower price point for both the mixed drinks and the brunch fare. So that knocks this place down 3/4 star. The other 1/4 star is lost for the slow service. HOWEVER, there were a TON of things I liked about this spot. The vibe of a place carries a lot of weight with me, and Fruiteria does it up nicely in this department. Relaxed, airy and sunny. In addition, the drinks were superb. I had one of the better micheladas of my life with brunch and came back later that night for a fantastic pineapple/caipirina drink called \"The Caipiripi\u00f1a.\" My friends' drinks tasted great, too...All the food was fresh and well-prepared. My date rocked a couple of the tostadas, the highlight being the tuna ceviche. I had one of the tortas, and it was great. Also of note in this area is the bottomless and very tasty Aguas Frescas. Anyway, I'd blow this kind of money at the Monterey or Hot Joy for the truly awe-inspiring and creative dishes served there. But Fruiteria's offerings, while not completely uninspired, aren't quiiiiite worth what they're charging. Check it out anyway, though!

In stock with fresh fruit cups, granola bowels filled with seasonal fruit, scrumptious tortas, fresh pressed juices and a number of yummy treats. The salads are now one of my favorite things. I seriously crave the Manzana salad. Who craves salad? Not this girl. \u00a0It is defiantly a must try. Alcohol is served during brunch hours. I highly recommend the mango mimosa. \u00a0By night the tequila gets to pouring with their yummy fruit infused drinks and scrumptious botanas (snacks) for dining.

We were the first people to enter, first seated and first to order. After we got our appetizer we waited 20 minutes for the main course. The main course was a chicken breast or fish. Neither which are served on their regular menu, and you can tell why. The chicken was almost over cooked and the fish with not much flavor.

We recommend Subway over this place, customer service is better!!"], ["Rod K.", "I rarely give a one-star review, but one thing that really makes me upset is when a restarurant blatantly, knowingly and INTENTIONALLY lies to me. \u00a0But before I get to that part, I'll give the surrounding details.My wife and I are here on business in San Antonio. \u00a0We searched for some great restaurants, and we found The Fig Tree Restaurant has Baked Alaska flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0I won't go into the background, but my wife and I have some great memories of Baked Alaska flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0Right on their website it says that it is flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0Lots of photos on the internet of the flaming Baked Alaska at this restaurant. \u00a0So THAT is why we decided to go to this restaurant.We liked the look and feel of the restaurant and everyone is very friendly. \u00a0We had a couple appetizers (crab cake and roasted beets) that were excellent. \u00a0My wife ordered the Beef Wellington (always one of her favorites). \u00a0When discussing how she wanted her steak cooked, instead of saying medium or medium rare, she said, \"I want it very, very pink, but not red\". \u00a0We do this because different restaurants have different ideas of what medium or medium rare is. \u00a0Her steak came out nearly well done. \u00a0Only just the slightest trace of pink if you used your imagination. \u00a0They apologized and re-cooked another steak. \u00a0The next steak came out bloody. \u00a0But by then I'd already finished my entr\u00e9e, so she just cut around and ate just the very outside that wasn't bloody. \u00a0I had the duck special, and it was good - not at all great...but good.My wife had a bottle of sparkling water that was in an ice bucket behind her. \u00a0And we ordered a bottle of wine. \u00a0Not once did anyone refill my wife's water or our wine. \u00a0She poured her own water and we poured our own wine. \u00a0We really don't mind doing that, but I thought I should mention it.So now to the reason I gave a one-star review. \u00a0The Baked Alaska was dropped off at our table and the waiter started to walk away. \u00a0So I said, \"I thought this was presented flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0He then said that they were no longer allowed to do flamb\u00e9 in the restaurant. \u00a0My wife and I just looked at each other.The Baked Alaska was just OK. \u00a0When it's not flamb\u00e9ed, it just isn't the same. \u00a0I would think they could at least still flamb\u00e9 it in the kitchen. \u00a0We each took one bite and didn't care for more.When the waiter came back, I further questioned about not doing the flamb\u00e9. \u00a0He said that they haven't been allowed to flamb\u00e9 for at least a couple years. \u00a0So I showed him on my phone, on their own website, where it says it's flamb\u00e9ed tableside. \u00a0He said that A LOT of people complain about this, and he said that the owners are well aware of this problem, but they will not change what it says on their website. \u00a0So what he fully admitted is that the owners, who are fully aware of the misleading statement on their website, intentionally mislead potential customers. \u00a0Obviously, just to get them in the door.I didn't want to put the waiter on the spot, but I assume that they have been instructed not to tell the customers when they order the Baked Alaska.I didn't ask to speak to the manager, but she came over to apologize anyway. \u00a0And she too admitted that the owners are fully aware of this situation. \u00a0She said that she will again tell them, but that they've been told over and over already. \u00a0She made it very clear to me that the owners don't care that they are misleading people.So that's it. \u00a0That's why they deserve a one-star review. \u00a0Maybe it's just me. \u00a0But being lied to at a restaurant is my pet peeve."], ["Wendy D.", "The food was well prepared, the service was attentive. Overall, it was a very nice meal. I think sitting outside would have been nicer"], ["Jim M.", "Excellent steaks and nice ambience but very expensive.

Free live music from the nearby amphitheater."], ["Angel Of Agon Y.", "Set in an historic building, the Fig Tree is an attractive space with two dining rooms and a patio overlooking the famed Riverwalk. Service is excellent as is the French-inspired food. I recommend the escargots and the beef wellington, two traditional dishes prepared in untraditional ways. The trout almandine comes with an exquisite brown butter sauce but was also lightly breaded which I didn't especially care for. The rib eye steak was all it should be. Kudos to our waiter, Adam, whose service was efficient, courteous, and suave. Adam also showed his tact when my guests and I were saying grace as dinner was served. He was bringing two dishes to our table, saw what we were doing, paused, and waited politely until we were finished. Not every waiter would have had the perspicacity to do that."], ["Emily B.", "The outdoor seating was so pretty over Christmas week, the ambiance was perfect for our rare-date night. I ordered the steak with fragra on top and potatoes with asparagus. It was delicious. I did have to have the steak sent back to cook a minute or two longer but the waiter was totally fine with it. In fact, he asked me to cut into it before he left our table to make sure it was to my satisfaction which then made me comfortable sending it back, as I usually don't do that. My husband ordered the duck breast, which was cold. Had I known that at the time, I would have suggested he send it back as well, but I didn't until the evening was over. \u00a0Overall, we enjoyed the meal. There was a little bit of confusion from the staff as to who would seat us, which was odd. Our waiter was new, but did a great job."], ["Jeff S.", "My wife brought me here for a birthday weekend in San Antonio. We were seated right away and the view to the Riverwalk is very nice, there is indoor and outdoor seating. Not crowded at all so it was a nice quiet dinner for the two of us. I had the spinach salad and the duck and it was great. Our meals together came to about $100, so it's not on the cheap, but I don't think outrageous for the atmosphere they have and the location. The one negative was our waiter, he was obviously not very familiar with the menu and options, he seemed nervous too. We could tell a huge difference between him and the seasoned waitress handling the other tables."], ["Nathan L.", "It was ok. The beef Wellington was not close to Gordon Ramsay's recipe which I've made at home several times. Even though it was deconstructed, which is kind of cheating, it came out very medium vs medium rare. The mashed potatoes lacked flavor. $12 simple salad (literally just lettuce) to accompany the meal...I'd rather have dessert. The service and Malbec were great."], ["Tj R.", "Food was truly amazing. The portions are a little smaller than other place which makes them about the right size. Presentation is pretty stunning too; seemed almost custom for our visit. I was able to order some things that I don't normally get to order, though, it's very expensive. It wasn't terribly quick either. But, not as ridiculously slow as say, La Marginal. The server was very attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our meal. He seemed to have an almost personal interest in our well-being and I liked that. We ate outside so, it was as clean as it can be when in the elements. The tablecloth was still clean and white, of course, and all the place setting was g2g.It's pretty busy on the Riverwalk on the weekends and that can be simultaneously frustrating while working through a crowd and also makes for interesting people-watching. Being outside, it was nice to hear the sounds of the city and smell the scents of nearby BBQ. It was a little windy that day and that messed-up my hair. :/ There were a few other patrons there, generally older (presumably with more money). Everyone had a bit of space around them and it all seemed private and intimate.Overall, the food is great and the experience is distinct but it's very expensive. I feel that you can probably get nearly the same quality food from some of the higher-end trucks in Austin and for much less moola. I'd say it's worth a one-time go, maybe with your mom or fianc\u00e9; it's a special occasion kinda place. Now that I've gone, while I will recommend that place, I probably won't go back since I don't have any special occasions anymore. :)"], ["Julie S.", "I wish I could say I had an amazing dinner experience and \u00a0was expecting to have awesome service when I was here last for the Elite event. But I am a bit disappointed with my experience here outside of yelp to enjoy a nice dinner. Asked to sit outside, so the hostess guided us out, wait pause, the table is not set up! So, where do we wait till it is done? Idk just stand around in the aisle and steps watching everybody? LOL we walked down to the bottom of the river and waited for over 5 minutes, maybe that is enough time for the table to be set. Walked back up and it is not done yet, stood around near the table \u00a0for what seemed like another 5 minutes until the busboy finished setting up the table. They were probably waiting for the table cloth to finish drying in the dryer? Maybe there should be better communication with hostess and servers, or the hostess go over and check to see what tables are open to have it ready, that way we can just wait in the lobby, instead of standing around watching people eat and be in the way of everybody. Also we shouldn't be the ones to ask for a menu. Doopty doo... still waiting for the menu. So, I called on someone overseeing the restaurant for a menu. She brought it to us. Later on the server came over to ask what we wanted to drink, prickly pear margarita... he comes back later we had some reviews saying it tastes better on the rocks do you want to try that instead? Oh god just give me a drink, yeah sure let's do on the rocks. Finally, we got to order and server failed to tell us about any dinner specials until after we had finished with our meal, since I was curious to know if there was one. The food was good by the way I had the seared maple leaf Duck breast and brussel sprouts on the side The duck was tender and \u00a0flavorful. The friend ordered the scallops and I thought it was cooked perfectly."], ["John C.", "San Antonio is not a locale you would expect fine French dining, but here it is, white tablecloths and all.Fig Tree has a real French chef, who is young and talented. He leans towards Bechamel-type sauces. I had the apple and onion soup which was very interesting and creative. The trout was a tad overdone, but the sauce was nice and the vegetable medley beneath was successful. The wine list is quite good, although I did not see any Chablis or Reislings. Portions are good sized, which is half the battle for fine dining. Nothing is worse than those New York art houses that serve up scanty scraps that look like they escaped from a Kafka novel. None of that here--you will be taking food home with you. Service was very good.The location is in La Vallita, which sits on a small ridge above the riverwalk, close enough to be nearby, but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. Bon apetite."], ["M C.", "We came here for Post-Valentine's day celebration. The little lights, small cozy house converted into a restaurant, the warm customer service added into an elegant romantic evening to remember.

I had the lobster bisque, the duck breast , and the banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Even the bread they served was tasty. All adding to a divine evening. Thank you for a wonderful evening .

Not at all gracious. The restaurant was empty on this Tuesday (I think) evening. \u00a0I see that another diner ordered multiple appetizers and uploaded the photographs to Yelp, so I guess it's just luck of the draw as to whether this lady is acting as the bouncer.

Even without a reservation, we were seated immediately at a fantastic patio table overlooking the river and the ampitheatre where a flamenco show was performing.In addition to detailing the menu items, our waiter spent time explaining San Antonio history and landmarks to us inquisitive tourists. We never felt rushed even though it was a busy holiday weekend.The food was outstanding!! I had the special which was duck orange. I have eaten all over the world and this was quite possibly the best duck I have ever had! My wife and daughter had the chicken and were equally impressed.

The location is cozy within La Villita (although the outside of the restaurant does lack some illumination, and its not immediately obvious that it's a restaurant). The restaurant itself has a nice view of the riverwalk and we were seated by the window on the second floor. The waiter was quite attentive throughout the meal. I started off with the p\u00e2t\u00e9, which was quite nice. My partner had the bisque which tasted very nice as well, but was very poorly presented in a clear bowl. Our mains consisted of the beef stroganoff for her and the blackened drum for me. I actually enjoyed the drum, it was nicely seasoned and topped with some avocado (the rice was slightly too al dente and they could've benefited from using basmati rice instead). My partner found the beef to be mediocre. The deserts were ok, we sampled the poire au vin and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. If I could give half stars this experience would've been a 3.5 star one. I cant say I didn't enjoy the food, I just don't think I would pay full menu prices for it (since its not restaurant week every week). The atmosphere was a little awkward, at times it was loud then it suddenly got awful quiet. Overall it was a decent experience and I'm glad I got to try it, but I likely would not return right away."], ["Leigh P.", "This place was unbelievably good. I was so glad to have found it. The manager was really friendly and attentive and the server we had knew her menu well. We all had different items off the menu and not one person could complain. I had the beet and goat cheese salad to start. Their goat cheese is encrusted in pistachios and the flavor is amazing. For my entree I had the ribeye and brussels sprouts. Cooked to perfect, the ribeye could be cut with a butter knife. And the sprouts were seasoned so well, I had to have them removed so I would stop eating them.

Then I had their scallops, came with three scallops over a squid ink risotto in a creamy brandy like sauce, wow, so tasty! I finished off my meal with a banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, very tasty.

We sat outside on the patio at the same level as the restaurant, but there were several tiers of patios down to the Riverwalk. There were white Christmas lights strung through the trees.

It was close to impossible to find this place and La Villita isn't even a through street. I suppose this prologue adds to the tree's overall allure. Because, behind its modest store front lies a secret garden waiting to entranced weary travelers with wondrous flavors and lingering aromas. Some friends and I came here for restaurant week. On the menu was capreses salad (Burrata/baby tomatoes/arugula/ balsalmic reduction), braised veal short ribs (polenta/wild mushrooms/ braising jus), and chocolate macaron (w/ chocolate gelato). Having eaten here, one will begin to appreciate and justify the existence for fine dinning. This isn't a place that many can just afford to eat every month or even every year. But, it's existence allows for true culinary creativity and evolution to take place. And, it's also what makes eating exciting. The star of the meal was the veal short ribs. Never have I been so enamored with such a complete dish that every component's flavor and texture existed in perfect harmony. In each bite you will feel as though everything in life is exactly the way it should be. The attention to details really set the dinning experience above anything else. Appetizer and dessert tasters compliment of the chef and a personal greeting from him at the end of our meal were special touches that made this a lovely summer's night."], ["Al S.", "Mike my waiter was awesome! The food was good but overpriced. I ordered the scallops for $38 and it was served on a small rectangular appetizer plate with 3 scallops, 3 small pieces of trumpet mushrooms and squid ink risotto that was a bit pasty.

I'm bewildered that it took me this long to make it in. Setting the scene for a memorable evening, we took a picturesque walk through a twilit and eerily peaceful La Villita before arriving at the teeny tiny home that is the Fig Tree. Inside is pleasant, like a formal dining room in your fanciest friend's house. But the patio, oh the patio, is what river walk dining dreams are made of. Twinkle lights line the balcony railings and various tiers of patio seating unravel all the way to the banks of the river. People once lived here, and I'll be forever jealous that I wasn't one of them. We dined during Restaurant Week, but we still sampled a few items from the regular menu, so I'd call our experience \"well-rounded.\" Proceeded by an excellently crisp New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, there was a twist on a caprese salad - thick chunks of colorful tomatoes drizzled in balsamic and sprinkled with seasoned goat cheese, escargot that melts in your mouth (I didn't even want the toast that came with it), and the most memorable small plate, a crab cake that was 100% crab meat and so fresh. For the main course, the duck confit with Gouda \"Bread pudding\" stole the show, and I don't even like duck. I'll be honest, the bread pudding bit made me choose it, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the duck - crispy on the outside, but juicy, tender, and buttery on the inside. I will say, the wonderfully capery sauce that came with the swordfish deserves to be bottled and available for purchase. Adding to the charm of the quaint historical eatery, the manager, Steve, is a Southern gentlemen. He shares stories of fine-dining in New Orleans, and you can tell that's where he learned to perfect the combination of hospitality, five star service, and unpretentious charm. \u00a0With a team like him and Chef Laurent (and our perfect server, Edwin), I can't imagine a less than idyllic dining experience at Fig Tree."], ["Ingrid D.", "Really great restaurant! And luckily sound proof! Some rock band was playing as loud as they could in the outdoor theater next door but you could only hear it if someone opened the door. The food was lovely! Granted rather pricey for a beef Wellington at $46 but very tasty and cooked to perfection. We ordered the flamed Alaska and it was delicious! We were torn between the bananas foster as we had seen a few tables get that and it was quite a show to watch them make it. Our waiter seemed a bit nervous and we briefly thought we had been forgotten when he emerged with our appetizers. The French lady seemed to be the manager and she was really on point.

We opted for the full dinner from soups to dessert. Throughout the service was wonderful and the staff attentive. The food was amazing - perfectly prepared and fresh.The only problem came with the wine. We ordered a bottle of Alsatian Pinot Blanc listed as a 2007 vintage.

No congratulations, nothing. \u00a0She was angry that we did not order any alcohol and practically rolled her eyes anytime we asked for anything--a water refill in particular sent her over the edge. \u00a0As we were walking out I had to use the ladies room and my husband was waiting in the entrance of the restaurant for me to come down the stairs. \u00a0As he stood there he heard our server complaining to the manager about the tip she received from us. \u00a0We didn't feel she deserved a tip at all considering how unpleasant she was but we did leave her 15% as a minimum. I normally tip 20% but she just ruined our entire experience. \u00a0We've been back to San Antonio several times since then for long weekend getaways but we will probably never be back to the Fig Tree. \u00a0It's such a shame that they cant hire quality servers.

We had a reservation and were greeted warmly and seated. Service was very good. I had the crab cakes and the Beef Wellington. Their preparation of the Wellington is a bit different, with the filet served between two pastries, and not cooked in the pastry. This keeps the pastry from getting mushy. The steak was prepared perfectly and tasted excellent. The crab cakes were fantastic.My wife had the avocado stuffed with Shrimp Louis and the Tournedos Rossini. Both were excellent as well. Truth is, we got dessert, but were full and I do not remember what it was. What I will remember is an excellent meal that I hope to have again in a future visit to San Antonio."], ["Todd S.", "Here for business and was looking for a good place to eat on the river that was not trashy and cheesy.

I ordered the Tournedos Rossini and my honey ordered the roasted duck. Mine came with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. His came with Thai basil glass noodles and duck confeit. Every bite was the best food we have ever tasted....it was soooo good.

Started w crab cake- best I ever had- not mushed crab, but lumps caked together w a perfect thin crust- green sauce to compliment. I ordered the beef Wellington medium rare- I guess my palate is not refined enough because it literally tasted like a wet dog smells-maybe it was the bordelaise sauce I could not handle. My fianc\u00e9 decided to tell the waiter my descriptive taste of the Wellington and he was offended & not too nice, but either the owner or manager was informed and he was so gracious & offered me his Chilean sea bass which was just made for him!

The bass was \u00a0sitting in a little pool of yummy butter sauce, swimming in it were tiny potatoes- not so special, but the soaking artichokes were amazing \u00a0my honey ordered the rib eye- it was good as well, topped w maitre d butter.

Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, incredible service."], ["Grace W.", "This restaurant is aweful. Its food is creatively cooked. The taste is not bad. But it's definitely over priced. But the one star is for its service. It is a discrimination place. Its service cannot be called professional. I went there twice, and both experiences were the worst restaurant experience I ever had in San Antonio. The first time, I waited for 20 minutes after making my order (only appetizer and soup at the time) and had nothing. I softly asked the old lady who is supposed to be the manager if I can get my food. Her response was \"No, you have not been waiting for 20 minutes???!!!!\" Still, no food came... I have been many types of nice restaurants around the world, pricy or not pricy. This is my first time to get this kind of treatment...Then, for some unknown psychological reason, I dropped Fig Tree the second time two weeks later. I probably just wanted to check if my last experience was random. Unfortuantely, similar thing. I waited for 10 minutes, and nobody came to talk to me for order. It was not a busy day. Over half of the tables were empty. For these two times, I figured it's because I went there by myself and dressed like a normal work labor, instead of being a rich lady or someone with rich husband who wears rings, necklaces and fancy dresses. I observed the old lady (the manager)'s behavior and some waiters. They are definitely discriminating. I think the manager causes serious service problem for this restaurant. For the purpose of work, I have visited all the top-ranked restaurants in San Antonio downtown. All of them have great service. If I give them 100 score, Fig Tree could be 0-10.

Our waitress (Lisa) was skillful and accommodating throughout our two-hour dinner, and every course was pronounced delicious by all four of us.Our window table overlooked the Riverwalk, so my guests had a dual treat: splendid dining and a unique view.

There was an appreciable wait between the main course and dessert, but that was to allow one of our party who had arrived late time to get his meal. Amazingly, even though he was over an hour late (plane problems) they were able to get him an excellent meal with little fuss. The atmosphere is lovely. This is the sister restaurant to the Little Rhein Steakhouse. It was actually the residence of the lady who started the Little Rhein, and it still has the feel of a comfortable home.

But the true test came with the quality of the food and drinks.We were not disappointed in the slightest. From the drinks, appetizer, entrees, all the way to the dessert, were all delicious. Since Ocho is a Cuban restaurant we had to order mojito for drinks and sandwiches for our entrees. If you are thinking about ordering a sandwich, I would recommend the Hamburguesa. The El Cubano is good as well, but the Hamburguesa had so much more flavor. Get the papas bravas as a side instead of the fries or potato chips. You will not regret it!

The Fruit Mixta is sized for a meal with a nice assortment of fresh fruits. The Traditional Pork Pozole Rojo is very good. I like a good soup for lunch. The Shrimp and Crab Campachena is delicious and filling without being heavy. The Ocho Chopped Salad also makes a good filling light lunch (if you want you can add chicken or crab).

There was also I nice crisp/crunchy outer later. \u00a0The risotto also had a rich flavor and was not overcooked nor undercooked. \u00a0Also a plus - I do not like peas because of their texture. \u00a0There were a lot of peas in this dish and I hardly even noticed them.Banana Bread French Toast - I'm not a total sweets fan so this was a little too sweet for me. \u00a0All I needed was a bite or two and I was good. \u00a0The ice cream was homemade and perfectly soft. \u00a0The bread was moist and the sauce was good.Fresh Fried Churros - \u00a0man, is it sad to say I think I've only had churros at costco? \u00a0This was delicious. \u00a0I was kind of curious at what it would taste like as the outside was pretty dark brown. I tore a piece off and the inside was...I don't know how to explain it...It almost looked as if it would be undercooked but when you take a bite, it was a perfect texture. \u00a0I was going to shy away from the lemon curd sauce as the two don't quite sound like they go well together but man it was delicious. \u00a0It was perfect lemon tang and a perfect hint of curd."], ["Samantha M.", "This is my first review. I felt compelled to write it after we read such high reviews on Yelp only to be disappointed with the restaurant. The location is great. The restaurant is small and intimate, which I appreciated. However, our table experienced poor service and low quality food. The butternut squash soup was served cold and tasted like canned pumpkin from a Thanksgiving potluck. The rice and vegetables looked like a frozen TV dinner. And the salmon was dry and over powered by garlic. In my opinion the menu items have a very high price for low quality food. In the end we decided we had paid for the great location and the chance to catch up with friends, which we couldn't complain about."], ["Tony H.", "Last day in town and stopped by this place for breakfast.

Stopped with my sister who's visiting from Hawai'i. We shared botanas y bebidas. Their tostones were really maduros, but I'm not going to argue with them...either way, loaded with flavor!

Although I was not in the mood for Cuban food it was delicious and we will definitely add this to our list of restaurants. Being DT, you would expect to pay for parking even on a Friday night, prime time, 7:30pm. Nope! Luckily there were a few spots open and it was free! The parking lot is very compact and close together so don't bring your truck. We were expecting at least an hour wait as well, but nope! We were able to get a table immediately and the outside sitting was still available for those who came after. Beer doesn't get any cheaper than this DT. They had shiner specials for $2 and a glass of Chardonnay for $4 as their drink specials. I wasn't expecting those prices at all. Food: we spilt the chorizo queso (not your typical queso dip, more meaty!) and the shrimp and crab seafood mix (forgot the name). Both were delicious and quite filling. The seafood did have a bit of a kick to it, so our waitress recommend adding avocado to it, which I'm glad she mentioned. They came in pretty large portions. If you tend to eat more, I would say 3 appetizers would be perfect and some drinks.Next time we come back we'll definitely try the main dishes!"], ["Miriam B.", "It's more South Beach than San Antonio yet somehow it fits perfectly.

It was still about a 15-20 min walk from the Navarro St exit of the river walk. I would suggest driving here to avoid the sketchy walking route. There is a parking lot outside, but I think you have to pay for it. This restaurant is attached from the outside to Hotel Havana. The decor is calm with blue and white hues. Two large dated chandeliers hung above us, and added charm to the small space. Beautiful natural light poured in from the glass windows as well. The coffee here tasted better than Starbucks and was refillable. We ordered the avocado and bacon omelette with arugula side salad. The salad could've used more dressing on top. The omelette itself was flooded with bacon in every bite. The avocado in the middle of the omelette added a nice light creaminess to the dish. I didn't care for the queso blanco sauce, which I felt was quite bland in flavor. \u00a0My brother ordered the Cubano Con Huevo, and it was delicious. The fried egg was cooked beautifully, and was still runny on the inside. The pulled pork sandwich paired well with the pickles. The potatoes were cooked and seasoned well. The thing I didn't appreciate here was the 20% gratuity slapped involuntarily on us (we came in as a party of 5 for brunch). The service wasn't stupendous enough to warrant such a tip. We weren't exactly a huge party either. Also, the prices for brunch are a bit steep, especially for a restaurant away from the river walk. So, while I think the food and coffee were good, it was not worth it enough for me to come back again given the expense."], ["Andrew \u00df.", "Love Ocho. By far one of my first hidden gems I found living on the museum stretch of the Riverwalk.

The decor was perfect. Vintage chandeliers, a huge espresso machine, art decor couches and tables, and it was on the side of a hotel overlooking the river walk, which was beautiful at night. I got the Cuban torta for dinner and loved it!

Perhaps a white plate and garnish would have altered my perception of takeout orders the \"Havana Hippie\" and Cuban Sandwich, but food should stand on its own whether dining in or carrying out. The Havana Hippie is a small stale piece of hoagie bread (likely pulled from a discarded box of Subway sandwiches), housing a glob of avocado and a dollop of mysterious purple stuff that is supposed to pass for black bean hummus. The Cuban Sandwich is not Cuban and it's Not a Sandwich. This tasteless, warped, inverted pile of pork is what I imagine a sandwich looks like after traveling through transport pods in The Fly (Google \"Baboon Scene The Fly\"). Do it now.

They were sitting in the most delicious sauce and dusted with queso fresco. It doesn't deliver all my Caribbean or Cuban food needs, but it doesn't claim to. Ocho is an adorable, small place to grab delicious bites and great drinks. (Go on a Tuesday!) I'll definitely be back."], ["M B.", "I have been a HUGE fan of Ocho's throughout the years. A weekend night is incomplete without having a drink at Ocho. Their drinks are delicious; while more pricey than the average bar, you definitely get what you pay for. The evening bar menu is great. The pozole is filling and perfectly spiced. However, my last experience there left a sour taste in my mouth. My friend and I went there for brunch one weekend. We actually first heard about Ocho from a Texas Monthly writeup about their brunch. First the food, I ordered the omlette and was extremely underwhelmed. It was $14 and bland as a bowl of steamed white rice. For Cuban fusion I was expecting a little more. It fell short of our expectations and didn't compare to their evening menu. The service: it was decent, but a little inattentive. The waiter also shortchanged me. I paid in cash and he rounded up to keep the change because he didn't prepare his \"bank\" for the shift. It was a small amount but nonetheless perturbed me since it inflated his tip from 15% (which he deserved) to 20%. It's just the principle of it that put me off. It shouldn't be my fault he didn't being change. I've worked in the service industry before and so I feel justified in my complaint. That being said, I usually go all the time on the weekends and this is really the only bad experience there"], ["Brian M.", "My wife and I love Ocho when we're in San Antonio.Good food, great drinks, and even better staff.

The restaurant could be a set on a Wes Anderson film -- impeccably stylish and a bit arcane. The food was incredible. I was there early in the day and was impressed by the brunch menu's choices.I went with the Breakfast Americano; two eggs scrambled with chorizo -- a spicy Mexican sausage -- savory home fried potatoes, two tortillas, and a small bowl of fresh melon and pineapples. I enjoyed a really well-made cup of black coffee with the meal. The price is a little high but the ambiance, helpful staff, delicious meal and riverwalk view made this feel like a value. Check in on yelp for breakfast and get a 20% discount. I plan to return, soon -- Highly recommended."], ["Maria W.", "Checked out this place for my birthday with my husband around 7:30pm. My biased-- I'm 100% Cuban.. Born there & everything! Let's start with the good: - the service was incredible; our waiter was so attentive and super nice! - the decor is so fun and definitely that Cuban flavor! - there is parking for the hotel/restaurant which is nice to have!- it's on a quiet side of the river walk which I enjoyed- they have those bikes that are throughout the city at the hotel/restaurant if u wanted to ride here. - the mojito was delicious! & this is where the good ends for me... Like I said I am biased because I know what Cuban food is suppose to taste like. I didn't expect to be spot on with the dishes being authentic Cuban food... But I also didn't expect them to sprinkle CHILI POWDER on everything... In case you are wondering Cubans don't like spicy food. Nor does it say on the menu you are going to sprinkle a good amount of chili powder. We ordered... - tostones: they were pretty good minus the chili powder sprinkles on top. Real Cuban tostones however are crispier, larger (these were tiny), and sprinkled with just salt on top. - papas (something else in the name I forget): nothing special just fried potatoes with again chili powder sprinkled on top and some melted cheese at the bottom of the plate.. Oh and two slices of grilled onions. - $20 flank steak: it was tender and juicy. But Idk the flavor was just bland nothing popping at me. Even with the cilantro relish on top. So there you have it-- If you are looking for authentic Cuban food this is NOT the place for you. If you love chili powder and Mexican flare this is definitely a spot for you."], ["Mariana B.", "My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place to eat downtown! I've seen beautiful pictures of OCHO so I was extremely excited to go and it definitely met my expectations! It's was calm and peaceful, we walked in and sat where we wanted and the waiter immediately came to us and brought us water in less than a minute. He's name was Shahrokh and he was very attentive and with a very professional and welcoming attitude. The food, I'm a picky eater and I was very please with the menu. We ate chorizo con queso, which they only part I didn't like was the onions and tomatoes because I don't eat that but it had a great flavor, it came with tortilla and they were good!

OCHOThis is the place to go to for an all around experience of literally having Dinner by Day and Drinks at Night.This place has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde vibe and I absolutely love it.When you enter you have this fresh restaurant that has an amazing Cuban/Latin infusion twist to their food and drink menu.The chandelier and piano inside the restaurant gives it such a fun feel and the views of downtown are super sweet when dining inside or on their patio. Make sure to take a look around and notice the details. One of the more intricate restaurants with their decor.The patio is perfect for dining during those lovely Texan nights I must say. My favorite is the Cuban Style Burger and their desserts. You can't come to Ocho and not have dessert that would be nonsense! My personal fave is their twist on the iconic Churro with the dipping sauces they serve to compliment them. Trust me you won't find me sharing my dessert. I just can't rave enough about their dishes altogether.What's great about Ocho is the speakeasy bar located right underneath the restaurant. There isn't a major sign or anything but a small staircase to your right as you are heading towards their bathrooms (bathrooms are located outside).Take the plunge and your senses are immersed in this dark intimate setting. The vibe of the bar is so cool and once your eyes adjust to the low lit bar you'll be glad you stayed for a drink or two after your dinner. It was a complete different feel than the Ocho restaurant but thats what makes it great. Two atmospheres under one roof- I'm not complaining."], ["Rob And Lisa R.", "Place is romantic at night. It's small but intimate. Mojito was good. My husband & I are Cuban & Puertorican so I'm trying not to be too judgmental. Tostones appetizer was different & amazing.

Great dish but a little too much sweetness going on. Between the green bean glaze and sweet potato pur\u00e9e, it tasted almost TOO sweet. -salmon and risotto: a light and well balanced dish.

What was supposed to be a quick lunch became a 2-hour meal that we didn't want to end. Our server was attentive and accommodating, especially to our young kids whom she introduced to \"Fidel\", the goldfish who had the best spot in the room. We enjoyed quite a few things on the menu along with mojitos and margaritas, particularly the Havana Cubano, chorizo con queso and pork pozole rojo. We wanted to extend our delightful experience, so we ended up ordering espresso and all their desserts (they had 3) -- and the clear winner is the banana bread french toast with vanilla ice cream, cajeta and candied walnuts. Heavenly!I can't recommend this place enough -- Ocho is a unique and intimate experience that fits right in a city full of character and history."], ["Geoff S.", "First off I ordered an espresso. \u00a0Cuban's know coffee. \u00a0This was sad. \u00a0Zero crema and bitter. \u00a0No mofongo, no ropa vieja. \u00a0The waitress said it was Cuban \"inspired\" not really Cuban food. \u00a0Cuban sandwich was not good. \u00a0Did not use a French roll, used some thin bread. \u00a0Dripping huge amounts of orange grease. \u00a0Normally I love grease, but this was overkill. \u00a0 Will not be back."], ["Anu M.", "Tuckered out and hungry, we scrambled through Yelp to find a good restaurant for a late lunch and ended up having Cuban food at Ocho. Ocho offers gorgeous outdoor seating by the San Antonio river and indoor seating as well. No fun sitting outdoors when the weather is blistering hot, so we got seated indoors. After perusing the menu, we started the meal with Chorizo Con Queso and Chicken Quesadilla. Minced meat baked with cheese bubbling on top and served with tortillas, Chorizo Con Queso was certainly our favorite! Our entr\u00e9e choices were Salmon Con Arroz Gandules and Pollo Envuelto. Al though the wait time was long, the meal turned out to be absolutely worth the wait. Salmon was perfectly cooked and the chicken was juicy and tender.Walked away, with our stomachs filled with lip-smacking food!"], ["John F.", "Nice place, decent food, great atmosphere.

I am not sure they did this on an artsy purpose or they were in a hurry to shut the kitchen. I mean there isn't much work in making a salad, how much of a hurry u need to be in to give the whole leaves. Might as well give me a chopping board!Also, the bill came but my mojito still hasn't. So much for a dining experience. The only aspect I liked were their turquoise interiors and pretty courteous staff."], ["Thea H.", "What a wonderful little place. Overlook the water and riverwalk. Wonderful Cuban atmosphere and great good. Breakfast look fabulous will have to make trip to try the Plantian Griddle Cakes."], ["Clara M.", "A must try in San Antonio. This is one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever been to, thanks to the architecture, location (on the quiet end of the Riverwalk), and the interior design. Their brunch was phenomenally good, but their coffee and drinks are the standouts. My latte came with adorable and delicious little cookies. The avocado, bacon, and queso omelette with the side salad of arugula with lemon vinaigrette was enough to put me in a happy food coma for the full day... I'll definitely be coming back to visit."], ["Brittany G.", "So good! Had the queso w chorizo and a cubano w/ fries. Loved all of it. The atmosphere is nice and authentic.

I had the chicken mushrooms with polenta and it was delicious. The only reason i'm not giving them 5 stars is because even though it's been described as Cuban Food it's not. Not that there is anything wrong with the food. They do have a couple of cuban dishes, but it's more a \u00a0cuban/mexican fusion (delicious, but fusion nonetheless !)"], ["Arin S.", "This place was good, but not that exciting. It's beautiful, as others' pictures show, and they have some good happy hour specials (ending at 6 pm). My meal was quite delicious (the salmon!! oh, the salmon)-- though to be fair, I was just glad to eat something that wasn't an enchilada in this city. I just didn't quite feel like I got my money's worth. I think I was in and out in 20 minutes."], ["Steve W.", "Best Mojitos on the planet! Very cool eclectic space. \u00a0Pan roasted Red Snapper Pico de Paloma was yummy, as was the Salmon Con Arroz Gandules. \u00a0Well worth a visit or 2! \u00a0We made a 2nd trip just for happy hour mojitos!"], ["Blair P.", "The reason I'm giving Ocho two stars is because of the food quality. The atmosphere is gorgeous and romantic. It has an indoor/outdoor boutique vibe with a river view. Good luck on reading the menu. You better bring a flashlight if you don't have one on your phone.The service was decent, but I was not at all impressed with the food. And trust me, it takes a lot for me to dislike any type of food. I ordered the quesadillas because they weren't too overpriced... And who could go wrong with ordering quesadillas? Well it was like a big bite of flour tortilla. Hardly any cheese. Needless to say, I ate them all because I was starving, and left hungry. It's definitely a mediocre appetizer. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich with sweet potato fries. They were undercooked and hard to chew. The sandwich was average. Overall this place was overpriced for the food; maybe we will go back for brunch when it's cheaper and they have a different menu!"], ["Dylan E.", "This was one of our better finds on a trip down to San Antonio. It is a pan-Latin influenced restaurant and bar that has the whole package going as far as the food, drink, and ambiance it offers. I was here during a colder weekend, so the indoor area of this restaurant had the large glass garage doors closed that appear to be able to open if they wanted. It was a single room with a dozen or so tables that overlooked the water. It was a bright place with large chandeliers, open ductwork, one brick wall, and a ton of glass. It has a smaller bar, and a very cozy atmosphere. I think a trip in the summer would be great because they also have both a large outside seating area. They did have heaters going outside to keep the area warm, but we decided to pass on that anyway.We had our choice of seats inside, and were served quickly. They have a respectable list of cocktails ranging from $8-$12, and a mediocre selection of bottled beers in the $4-$6 range. The beer offerings weren't great, but you'll find a few Texas offerings as well as the most popular Mexican imports. They also have a good selection of spirits and wines. The food menu isn't huge, but it is not at all easy to narrow down what you want. Everything looked amazing, and we finally settled on the Ocho Salsa Platter and a Havana Cubano Torta to split between two people. The salsa platter was delicious and the $10 offering would have been enough to fill 2 of us up. It had a couple different salsas, some guacamole, and some escabeche pickled vegetables. The veggies and one of the salsas was plenty spicy enough to get your mouth tingling, the guacamole was fresh and delicious, and the other salsa was milder but very flavorful. It came with plenty of chips that tasted fresh and made in house. The $14 torta was very good. It had thick French style bread, and a generous portion of tasty ingredients inside. The only thing missing was more mustard, as it went kind of undiscovered in the sandwich. The seasoned house made chips as the side were also good, although not as fresh tasting as the tortilla chips with the salsas. Two of us ended up leaving food on the table as it was more food than we could finish.Overall, this was a great meal in a great atmosphere. Our server kept us happy, and we never felt like we had to get his attention for anything. It got a little loud inside as the entire place is basically a greenhouse so all the sound echoed, but it wasn't too bad. The table we sat at for 2 people was too small to hold our one appetizer and one entr\u00e9e, so it made eating and especially sharing dishes a little difficult. I would go back here if I was in the area again."], ["Iliana R.", "Me and my husband were in town for a day and we were looking for w place to have some late dinner and drinks.. We were staying right by the riverwalk, and we seen the Ocho sign and we yelped and seen the reviews and pictures.. The food and drinks look delish so we gave it a try and it was AMAZING. The main room for the restaurant was closed due to a private event going on, but they had the bar open which was located in the basement of the hotel. (Hotel Havana) the ambience was super chill.. Felt like we were somewhere in Cuba.. Not much lighting each table had a candle which made it a bit romantic. I loved it. I ordered a mojito, the best one I've had. My husband ordered a paloma verde, it was so tasty! We ordered la fruta mixta for an appetizer. Fred's cut fruit with lemon and powdered chili. It was great! My husband ordered the red snaper with a mango and black bean slaw. It was the best fish I've ever had. Fish is not deep fried, it's pan grilled. And last we ordered shrimp and crab campachena, spicy but super tasty. Overall, the food and drinks were amazing. The waiter that took care of us was super friendly and made us feel really comfortable. We will for sure be coming here again when we are in SA. Super satisfied!"], ["Kearstin C.", "I had the red snapper and like 3 mojitos.I LOVE mojitos; they were STRONG, I almost needed a cane to walk back to my hotel so I didn't fall over.Def should give this place a try.Cute atmosphere as well."]], "Canyon Cafe": [["Cathy L.", "What a great restaurant!

My first clue this place was different were their chips! They looked like actual tortillas and were seasoned with some kind of addictive spice! Hubby ordered the street tacos which were pretty fresh and tasty. I had the stuffed poblano pepper. I really enjoyed the meat to rice to pepper ratio. Everything was minced so it had a nice flavor! The waitress even brought us some free dessert tamales.Great service , unique twist on Tex mex in a repurposed factory! Another gem in San Antonio you must try! Plus if you want to go shopping there are like a dozen shops in the same plaza for easy access."], ["Linh N.", "BF and I were in the area shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. I really love their chips and salsa here based on the fact you don't just get tortilla chips but a variety of sweet potato and wonton chips sprinkled with some zesty seasoning on it! Salsa is flavorful but on the mild side. The menu is a fusion of american and southwestern. Someone can get tacos or a burger since the menu is pretty diverse. The BF ordered tacos while I tried the chicken fried steak. Tacos were tasty and he had no complaints. Chicken fried steak was smothered in gravy so it kind of lost some of that crispness. But the breading was already falling off the steak though. I wouldn't recommend this since it was just okay. A good place to go to if you're in the area but not something to go out of the way for."], ["J'me W.", "Solid food and nice ambiance.First I must say our server Amy was amazing!!!!! What I loved is that she was so attentive to our daughter whom is 3.We ordered table side guacamole and Amy let my daughter pour the ingredients in the guac herself.

My Favorite is the Won ton chips, I couldn't get enough.My husband ordered the street tacos-they are small and OK very sweet. He had the crispy shrimp, carnitas, and crispy chat chicken.I ordered the Black and bleu Quesadilla's they were good but once again sweet of believe it was from the onion jam.Chocolate tamale at the end was a nice treat but overall I felt everything had such a sweet flavor profile even the chips are sprinkled with blackened seasoning and sugar.If they would add some savory or salty components to the dishes it would get another star from me."], ["Tom G.", "Glad I stopped here for lunch. \u00a0First time back to San Antonio in 20+ years. \u00a0I had the\"naked\" Chile Rellenos.

I just say Awesome!! \u00a0Very tasty with just a bit of spice from the poblano seeds left behind. It seemed a little more healthy than the typical fried pepper dish. \u00a0 The chips and salsa were the best I've had in a long time. \u00a0Great location for nearby shopping and golf at the Quarry golf club. \u00a0 Nice to be back in Texas!Enjoy."], ["Natasha D.", "Omg this place was absolutely amazing, from the chips, salsa to the pasta. Service was outstanding I highly recommend this to all plus if you are a first timer they give you a free desert"], ["Sarah J.", "I had heard good things about this restaurant, but now that I think about WHO said those things, I should've known better! I was entirely underwhelmed. The atmosphere is busy and seating is tight, so it's hard to relax. Service was decent; they must have been rushed though because employees were polite but moving quickly from table to table. There was an hour wait for Mother's Day, but we sat down right away in a bar booth. Once we sat I realized why no one had been seated there; it was a tight fit. I ordered the Poblano Chicken Soup, which was decent enough to order again should I be stuck here for another meal. My S/O ordered the grilled tuna, which was yummy on the blackened edges but lacked any flavoring. The rice was plain and a little hard, and there was a weird sweet sauce on all the food. Literally - ALL the food. Even the chips tasted the same. My mother-in-law left her Enchiladas untouched; I didn't try them to check out the issue.A positive: at the end of our meal the server dropped off a plate of white chocolate pecan tamales for a special Mother's Day dessert. That was a sweet-and yummy-final touch!Overall, just not our cup of tea, or bowl of soup, or plate of tuna!5 stars= Driving across town just for this!4 stars= I would recommend visiting.3 stars= Average, acceptable, positive.2 stars= You might be able to drag me in. 1 star= I will definitely not be returning."], ["Yvonne P.", "I under estimated this restaurant...I went to this place expecting the regular tex-mex restaurant but it turned out pleasantly original with its flavorful combinations. Starting with the chips: some tasted sweet like sopapillas and others were seasoned with salty adobo. The salsa was garlicky but delicious. For the main course I ordered a seafood special with fish and shrimp that was to die for! With paella rice and fruit kabobs that made the plate super special. Loved the combination of sweet grilled strawberry, pineapple and oranges meeting with the subtly salty rice, shrimp and fish! Wow, each meal had something to shine with!Last but not least I ordered the Banana burrito, two half bananas wrapped in a cinnamon flavored thin tortilla with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate syrup, yum!

The inside has both booth and table seating and it's mostly an open dining area. The waitstaff was quick and attentive and refilling drinks, chips, and salsa. The chips are really delicious because there's a blend of corn, sweet potato, and flavored puffy corn chips. The salsa isn't very spicy, but is flavorful and fresh. I ordered the enchiladas, filled with chicken is a cheesy sauce. The sides are interesting because instead of beans and rice, it is rice and a salad. Interesting and different, and makes the meal a little lighter. The serving sizes are huge so you can definitely get full in chips and your entree. After dinner, they offer a cold, white chocolate with nuts wrapped tortilla as a snack. Pretty nice touch also. I recommend this place for TexMex and some interesting Mexican cushion food like crab cakes, meatloaf, and country fried steak. The TexMex is pretty good, but make a note that this place is pricey due to it's location and food choices. Easily $15 per person."], ["Chad B.", "Amazing food! \u00a0I came here last night and was not disappointed. \u00a0the chips and salsa are amazing. \u00a0I had to stop myself from eating too many so I could have room for my dinner. \u00a0I got the chef's special which was grilled pork chops and roasted squash. \u00a0I wish I had ordered 2 because it was so good!"], ["Darren V.", "My wife came in around 4:45 and it was dead.

I had previously heard about the \"Quarry Market\" and was intrigued when I saw that we were at the exit for it (Basse). We took a small detour and decided to eat at the first place we saw because like I said....we were starving. The place is charming. I loved the decor and the way it was laid out. What made me the happiest was that there was a good amount of space in between the tables which meant that my vulgar conversation wouldn't be overheard by families. I've had enough stern looks on my language to last me a lifetime. My husband started off with a Dos Equis amber and I, a tea. We were then greeted by a odd looking basket of chips and salsa. I didn't particularly love the chips. They were way over-seasoned for my taste and the salsa was a bit too spicy, even for me. Before my meal, I had a Caesar salad and that was the worst part of my meal. The Southwest Caesar dressing was almost flavorless and the thin strip of tortilla chips were stale. I ordered the \"pork carnitas\" which although it tasted like I was eating pot roast tacos was still very good. It came with black beans, a small amount of guacamole, and warm tortillas wrapped in corn husks. My husband had the \"Naked Chile Rellenos\" and thought they were \"okay\". His words.We had a problem with our waiter throughout our meal. At one point, he completely disappeared and we had to flag down another waiter for refills who seemed annoyed at our request. Also, the hostess was kind of rude and kept giving me the stink eye. So, service left a lot to be desired.All in all, the meal was relatively cheap for lunch and we left with full bellies, but I hate having to sip on my husband's beer because I am THAT desperate for something to drink because our waiter decided to rob a bank or something. I probably won't be back."], ["Sandy U.", "Omigosh, where to begin? \u00a0This was the most phenomenal dining experience. Staff was incredible (Amy was our server and manager Quincy came by and chatted. I loved watching the food parade by to the tables, presentation was extraordinary. You start with chips....tortilla chips in white, blue and red. And sweet potato chips. And the most incredible wonton chips sprinkled with blackened seasoning and powdered sugar. All served with a thick salsa yet not salsa. Thick, with bite and a smokiness. Wonderful. I had the Santa Fe stuffed Chicken Breast that Amy said was her favorite. All I had to do was look at the description and knew it was my kind of food. . Huge chicken breast stuffed with an herb goat cheese, on a Santa Fe pilaf in a red pepper sauce with asparagus, pine nuts and a pesto of sorts. HUGE enough for two meals and I probably drove my husband crazy moaning over how phenomenal every bite was. Husband had the canyon burger. Great presentation on a cheddar jalape\u00f1o bun. He said was very tasty. He took home half his as well as we filled up a bit much on the chips (had a second basket of those!). In visiting with Amy and complimenting them, she said they'd like to buy us dessert as it was our first visit. We chose the flourless chocolate truffle cake. Decadent and rich and delicious, the manager, Quincy, delivered it and chatted a bit. Then, Amy came by with their white chocolate peppermint tamales, their complimentary finish to the meal. Apparently these were a touch different than normal as it's the winter holidays. I can't remember what she said their \"normal\" is but I know it wasn't peppermint.

The endless chips and dip are amazing. Had such a bad experience that I told all my coworkers about it and they all agreed that this place is no good. The yelp reviews do not match the experience that I had. There was a point where our waiter disappeared for like 5 to 10 minutes and we didn't even have our drinks yet. The service was so bad that I finished my water and had to drink my girlfriends because the waiter never came to check on us. I have no problem paying for a good time or for good food but the prices were through the roof at this restaurant and the food wasn't even that good. I will never return to this place."], ["Fawn G.", "Canyon Caf\u00e9 is one of the oldest restaurants in the Quarry that I feel has been consistently tasty and has stayed true to it's Southwestern Tex-Mex flavor! First of all, they have some of the best chips ever. The basket is an assortment of regular tortilla, blue tortilla, sweet potato and some other chip that probably has crack on it. It's probably sugar but whatever, that basket of chips is the best in town as far as I'm concerned.You can't go wrong with the fajitas. Shrimp, beef, chicken, veggie, all options are pretty awesome. My main complaint is you only get two tortillas with an order and it's a very large portion of fajitas. It just doesn't make sense. However, the food is delicious. Another favorite option at Canyon, is the black beans. Love the black beans. They have street tacos now. No taco is more than $5. I've tried maybe 3 out of 6 of them and each one has been stuff and enjoyable. Fried shrimp? Yes please! Bison picadillo, whodathunkit?! I'll take two!There is also the awesome bar. I like their phrase \"two drink max-because we really have the best margaritas in town\". That's a bold statement. We've had a pitcher of these best margaritas and I gotta tell you, it's tough going back to work after just one of those pink cactus concoctions. Devine! Service can be great! Service can be slow,,, Service is not very consistent as long as I've been coming here, but the chips and the rest of the entrees are pretty much my main squeeze. Summer is over, which means that patio seems very tempting for happy hour or date nights.Order some tacos, share a pitcher and have fun!"], ["Mia G.", "Very decent dining experience. We went on a Friday night around 9pm and there was plenty of seating. The interior is very reminiscent of Santa Fe, NM. I loved the design. The bathrooms were in good working order and very clean. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. They serve complimentary chips and salsa which is a nice touch. The salsa tasted a lot like marinara sauce though. I had the house margarita with blue cura\u00e7ao (I forgot what they called it). It was very good, a little on the strong side. The server was very attentive. I had a water refill within a minute of finishing it. Also the corn calamari was excellent. On the whole a very pleasant experience.

I used to love the salad that came with the quesadilla dish, but I took one bite this time and was done. \u00a0They have definitely made some changes... and not for the better (and no they were NOT busy). \u00a0They also serve white chocolate/nut frozen desert thing (with every meal to every customer) which is DELICIOUS -historically. \u00a0Still delicious this time, AFTER you spent 5min trying to get the corn husk out of the middle of it. \u00a0Previosuly these were rolled less haphazardly, easy to consume, and absolutely delicious.Presentation: (1star) see aboveDrinks: (5stars) I didnt have any adult beverages this time, but historically, \u00a0fantastic and well priced.Service: (3stars) I had to ask for a highchair 4 times, yes 4. \u00a0Drinks were only refilled for 2 guests out of 10 of us. \u00a0My glass was empty for at least 20min at which time we were leaving. \u00a0I will say our orders were correct and the waitor was very pleasant. \u00a0Again the place wasnt busy, but we did have a big table (mostly kids).Attire: casual, but would not be out of place in business casual.Cost: ($) \u00a0$ 10-25 per plate on avg. \u00a0They have increased their prices since the last time I visited (not worth it based on my experience this visit)Overall rating: \u00a03 stars this visit, but historically would have rated a 4.5. \u00a0This restaurant has a tex mex original menu and historically has had good service, good food, and good prices. \u00a0The prices are going up while the other components are going down. \u00a0Not a good combo for a place wanting to stay in business.I would definitely give this place another try or a first try for those that have never been. \u00a0Im hoping they were just having a bad day and short on staff."], ["Melody F.", "Not good for a gluten free person.

I'm not to much for blackened salads. My kid ordered the cheese quesadilla which was basic, but then again it's off the kids menu so enough said. What I found being different were the chips and salsa. The salsa was excellent, but the chips were coated with paprika/chili powder/sugar.

They also have a delicious seared tuna salad with a refreshing zesty homemade dressing that makes for a pleasant light lunch. I don't know that I'd call this place a chain, after all, there are only three other locations in the country, and one's in Houston. So, let's be real, it's not exactly Chili's, y'all.

As my boyfriend and I looked for a good place to eat we found ourselves at the Quarry where surprisingly there aren't as many food options as I would like. I've been to PF Changs, and while I love Freddy's, I go to the Quarry for a more upscale experience. Not a big fan of CPK and the sushi place looks really small in there to try just yet. So we ventured to Canyon Cafe. The Kokopelli figures at the entrance called to us so we gave it a shot. The decor is beautifully Southwestern (my favorite) with original art on the walls and rusted lampshades embossed in Southwestern patterns. I ordered the carnitas and enchiladas verdes.When the plate came out it was huge. The enchiladas were packed with juicy chunks of chicken and the green salsa was incredibly flavorful. It wasn't smothered with cheese which was awesome. The carnitas had plenty of flavor as well. It came with a side of what I thought was a tamal but ended up being warm tortillas wrapped in corn husk. Got me there! But so creative! My boyfriend had the fajitas which were sizzling hot on the cast iron plate. Exactly the way he'd been wanting for a while now. We were stuffed and very impressed with the food. The service was fine and the cafe itself set the tone for the food.

Entrees were pretty bland and strange... I went with the enchilada combo, my husband had the fish tacos- think of a friend you just met, they invite you over, make you standard drinks and then cook you food. It's cool because you get some drinks and your friend is nice and you get food that you don't have to spend hours making it nor deal with the dishes later. That's how the six of us felt about the experience there. The food was rudimentary; it could have easily been put together by someone with no thumbs. The ingredient quality was alright, it was just a very simple meal. Not quite tex- mex, not quite anything that should deserve its own food genre name.Wait! There was chocolate at the end!

And a cup of their poblano chicken chowder. The carnitas were spot on. The enchies had a good flavor but were rolled with flour instead of corn tortillas.

The place was perfect for us. The place allowed us to just hang-out for awhile after dinner as we enjoyed our company. \u00a0They had a Chilean themed menu which everyone seemed to enjoy. \u00a0I had the scallops and my wife had the Chilean bass which we both loved. We had their Tres Leches for dessert which thought was a bit dry, but we still enjoyed. They have a decent wine list and a well stocked bar.What really mattered was the service. The staff were great. \u00a0They were very accommodating and treated us as true guests to their place. Being a big group we were probably a bit noisy. A few of us had some quirky requests and they had to go back and split the bill among the 11 of us who were there going Dutch. Our server handled it graciously and took care of it. \u00a0We really had a wonderful evening. \u00a0Great food with great company makes for a wonderful evening."], ["David K.", "My experience at Las Canarias' Sunday brunch made me truly question my loyalty to the Omni brand. \u00a0Having had excellent experiences at Ostra, the sister restaurant on the Riverwalk, I decided to try the much talked-about Sunday Champagne Brunch. \u00a0The experience was most likely one of my top five worst experiences I've had dining at any hotel restaurant.Table Management - 1 Star - I arrived roughly two minutes early for my reservation and i was told that the table was not ready at the time. \u00a012 minutes later, I approached the hostess stand and spoke with a manager and he assured me a table was being prepared. \u00a0He pointed to a two-top being prepared directly adjacent to another two-top that was already prepared.Service - 1 Star - I hoped the service and food would make up for this minor shortcoming in table management, but I was wrong. \u00a0The server was friendly but the least bit attentive. \u00a0She was trying to manage a 14-top and we were delegated to a table visit every ten minutes or so - usually when our dirty plates were waiting on the side of the table for a few minutes. \u00a0The service did not improve through the hour and a half we were seated, and only got worse when trying to pay our bill. \u00a0That 14-top decided to pay all separate, which occupied the server for another ten minutes while we waited to pay.Food - 3 Stars - The quality of the food was average for what would be expected for a buffet-style brunch. \u00a0Nothing close to spectacular as I would have expected from a 4.5 star average yelp reviewed establishment. \u00a0We were about halfway into the brunch service, but there were several dishes left near empty - the meat and cheese bar and parts of the dessert bar. \u00a0I was hoping the raved-about bananas foster station would make up for some of it, but I was equally disappointed. \u00a0The server making the bananas foster either was not trained properly or didn't really care as the bananas foster was poorly prepared with clumps of brown sugar uncooked in the dish.I know most people reading this will say, \"what do you expect from a buffet?\", but if I am paying close to $50 per person with tip, I would expect good quality of service and food. \u00a0 \u00a0Neither of which I received from this establishment. \u00a0On my way out, I tried to speak with a manager, but he was off handling other customer complaints and I did not want to wait around even longer to speak with him."], ["Bill A.", "A group of work colleagues went there for dinner during a convention in town. \u00a0This is a fine, fine restaurant. \u00a0Service was excellent. \u00a0Wine list is very nice. \u00a0The margaritas are indeed some of the best in town. \u00a0I ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the paella. \u00a0Both were very good, although the drizzle of a shiracha based sauce on the tomatoes was a little disservice to the quality of the tomatoes themselves. \u00a0I also had a bite of squab starter that someone else had, and that was very good. \u00a0Creme brulee for dessert was perfect. \u00a0Had the starter and entree both been as excellent as the service, margarita and wine list, this would have been a 5 star review. \u00a0As it is, it's a solid 4 and well worth a visit."], ["Ericka C.", "We went on a Friday night and got seated right away, outdoors with a view of the river. It was very nice, waitstaff was excellent. They were out of the NY strip steak which was a little disappointing. My husband got the organic chicken instead which was quite moist and well cooked. He cleaned his plate so he must have liked it! I got the chicken tortilla soup which was made differently than I'm used to, but it was still pretty good. The dish I liked the most was dessert! Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with 2 lavender cookies and half a strawberry! Hit the spot! Prices were about what is expect, definitely not cheap but at least the food was good for what it was. I understand most of the reviews are for their breakfast/brunch, so hopefully this helps folks that are there for dinner."], ["Vivian W.", "The quick 30 minute brunch we had here was as good as it gets. We were running short on time so this was the first place we ran into after arrivin at the River Walk! The view outside of the restaurant was amazing, even in this heat wave, it felt really nice sitting outside under the tree and feeling the river breeze.The service was very quick. We ordered some orange juice, the brunch beef tacos and a sun dried tomato pasta. My tacos were fabulous! The beef was so juicy and tender. There were also jelepanos, pickled onions, cheese, and a giant piece of fresh avocado! There were three decent sized tacos which was enough to fill me up. My friend also really enjoyed her pasta! Even though the price here is a little high, the experience was very well worth it. Everything was great, especially the food! Definitely recommend everyone to stop by if they get a chance!"], ["Lily M.", "I had an early dinner reservation at Las Canarias and was nicely greeted upon walking in by who looked to have been the manager. \u00a0I knew I was off to a great start for the evening after seeing so many smiling faces on the workers. \u00a0The restaurant itself is very romantic looking and has a great view of the riverwalk if you're lucky enough to score a table by the window.My waiter was very nice and attentive. \u00a0He started me off with an amazing Artisan Greens salad (without the cheese). \u00a0The salad was divine. \u00a0I would order this again and again if ever in the area due to the exquisite sherry vinaigrette, the thinly sliced pears, and the fresh greens that all mixed so well together.For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Pan-Seared Salmon, and it was to die for! \u00a0The salmon was cooked perfectly, at medium. \u00a0It was one of the best pieces of salmon I've had. \u00a0The mojo verde sauce was so delicious and paired all too good with the potatoes and green beans. \u00a0I can't say enough about how much I liked this dish.The only things I didn't like about this restaurant were the old smell that the place had, as well as the knats that were flying around my food at my table. \u00a0Other than that, I liked Las Canarias and I will most likely visit it again if in town."], ["Jonah K.", "Came by for breakfast, odd location (somewhat of a maze to get in here), but a cool view of the river walk.

We decided to have brunch here based on the fab reviews while on a girls trip during fiesta. We were promptly seated since we had a reservation and offered coffee and juice to start- we only wanted coffee, but both servers that were at our table kept asking about juice- no thanks, \u00a0like I said, just coffee. Do they have a juice quota to meet everyday? So we jumped up and bypassed the omelette station since there was a line. I never saw the bananas foster station all the reviews raved about- super let down. We stopped at the berries and noticed the blackberries were moldy- so they don't wash the berries. Ew.So we started down the line, cold cereal, scrambled egg/cheesy/hot sauce casserole stuff, cold potato, pre made pancakes, and mini pastries. We got to the cute little mason jars of fresh sweet cream butter and almond butter and there is hair in the butter, all around the knife and with little chunks of butter dangling. \u00a0*gag*So we had the knife to the manager along with our plates and say no thanks. \u00a0This is in an Omni hotel- I expected more."], ["Cortnee C.", "Such a great experience here from start to finish.

My significant other has a friend that worked there many years ago and always raved about the food. We ordered the chef's special of the day, recommended by our waiter, which was a delicious paella with different fish and mussels and shrimp tossed together with a yummy risotto. The best part of the dish was the scallops on top, seasoned beautiful although I'd say a little rubbery. I also ordered the shrimp and grits, since we had just been talking about a similar fish the evening before. The grits were purred and topped with an oily, spicy chorizo and some large gulf shrimp. I wasn't so sure about the oil, but my dinner partner enjoyed it, and I loved the paella, so all worked out in the end!The wait staff was very knowledgable and quick, making for an all around positive fine dining experience. The waiter even remembered us mentioning our show and made sure we had time to wait on the special, which was very thoughtful!We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the cooler of late summer evenings and had a beautiful view of the Spanish architecture on the Riverwalk. We had plenty of time afterwards to walk over to the Majestic and finish off our night!

Truly delicious food, and great service. Although the restaurant is a bit too pricey, it is worth picking this place for the one special night of your visit to San Antonio.Ambience could be a little nicer (and less chilly) indoors, but the outdoor seating is really pleasant, and a little bit hidden from the pedestrian traffic of the River Walk. However, bugs do like the plants around the outdoor seating, and I had one fly right into my expensive glass of wine.

Since I was hungry, it seemed like the better deal. The selection at the brunch buffet was OK... I had some chilaquiles, but they were just OK (probably the lowest quality I've had anywhere). I went back and had a made-to-order omlette instead (BTW, the chef cooking the omlettes was such a delight... I had a really nice convo with her).The pre made options included chilaquiles (see above), french toast, a few different breakfast meats, and potatoes.There was also a pastry table and several types of fresh bread. I gotta say, they had several kinds of butter (and not the cheap kind), as well as honey, nutella and some other spreads.There was also granola, yogurt and fresh fruit.Chris and I are big brunch people and we often go indulge after a big run. Of the places we've tried (in LA and elsewhere), this was one of the lesser places we've been to."], ["Benjamin T.", "This is the best restaurant in San Antonio. I will return here every trip, and here's why: it has everything going for it. Beautiful location right on the River Walk, inspired ethnic dishes prepared at an expert level, great drinks for relaxing with guests, and exceptional service, with a staff that is clearly passionate about their food.Don't order the obligatory fine dishes you can get at any great restaurant. Those are there for the locals to have a fancy date. Instead, have the local specialties that you can only get the best of in San Antonio.

To start, we ordered crab fritters, calamari and a cheese appetizer for the table. Not too large of portions, but enough to go around---and very tasty. They were a bit light on craft beers. You probably need to stick to wine here. For the main course, I ordered the scallops. There were 4 large diver scallops with a very savory umami type flavor. Two of my customers ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. My colleague ordered the Gnocchi while my other customer ordered the shrimp grits. All were very satisfied and left room for dessert.

The photos for this place looked great and there was a bananas foster station. So we made a reservation and showed up ready to grub!The buffet was very small. They did have an omelette station, but that's it. Previous reviews for brunch spoke of prime rib stations, shrimp, several types of eggs and meats etc. That was NOT AT ALL what we saw. Everything else was made ahead and set out. Further more it looked as if what had been made ahead of time had been sitting out for a long time. The first table was yogurt and berries. Too bad there was a huge clump of moldy blackberries in the middle of the bowl. I pointed it out to the staff and they brought back a bowl of blueberries- but still. For that to make it out, they couldn't have been washing the berries. No thanks. I should have left then, but I opted for pancakes because I figured you can't screw those up. I picked up a mason jar of sweet cream butter and when I pulled out the knife to get some there was a long hair wrapped around the knife and in the butter. Gag.I showed the same attendant the nasty butter and gave him my plate.

The pricing is pretty decent as well and no-where near the price gouge that Yelp seems to indicate it is. Sure, it's a premium, but it seems to be well deserved. It really looks like most reviews on Yelp are negative simply because of the sticker shock. Regarding the buffet, we looked, it was decent, but the buffet I would say is more for the hotel guests that have breakfast included in their room. If you're not staying at this hotel and you want a buffet, stay in your own hotel. If you're the type of person that believes breakfast is best served as a buffet, you'll be unhappy and unfulfilled. If you're looking for a relaxed dining experience on the riverwalk, then eat off the breakfast menu and things change phenomenally. This is what this restaurant is good at and this is the only breakfast you should consider here. The portion sizes are surprisingly big given the style of place, however there was no compromise on quality. The Eggs Benedict was rich but flavorful, and the 'Classsic San Antonio Breakfast' was abundant in flavor and variety. It's very easy to forget that this is a hotel owned restaurant once you start eating what's on the menu. Even the coffee was decent, and despite how busy the riverwalk can get, at no point were we rushed. Both the 'Classic San Antonio Breakfast' and the Poached Eggs Benedict came in at $15 each and their size and quality reflected it very well. For a couple on a romantic breakfast, you and your wallet will be happy. For a family of four with two young kids? Math would indicate the answer is no."], ["Faye D.", "The location is great, right on the river walk. We got lucky and there was sunshine and a breeze which made the outdoor seating so much nicer.

These were full of flavor from the added peppers and onions and they were absolutely delicious. It's a bit expensive, $15 for an omelet. Service was attentive and the ambiance was upscale.

Definitely a must in San Antonio."], ["Ann H.", "my first time at las canarias was during san antonio restaurant wk 2013. the lunch seemed like a good deal at $15 for 3 courses but the food was pretty disappointing. the first course was a soup that was nothing special or memorable. second course was beef short rib tacos which were sparsely garnished and had tough/chewy/overcooked meat. finally, the only dessert option was the caramel popcorn creameux, which wasn't something i would typically order and ended up being just okay. i didn't think i would ever be back but then i kept seeing rave reviews about the sunday brunch. since my husband and i were staying on the riverwalk for the weekend and were already nearby, we decided to check it out. at over $100 for 2, this was definitely a splurge, but what you get doesn't match up with what you pay at all. the food spread is actually pretty disappointing and there are just tons of carbs to fill you up. omelet station | omelets worse than what i would make at home. flavorless, with more cheese than egg itselfeggs benedict | also bland, with soggy english muffin that could not be cut with butter knifegrilled cauliflower/peppers | nothing specialpan fried fish of some sort | the only thing that was good! i had a tinyyy piece but by the time i finished my first plate i was too full to go back for moremac & cheese | okay, but the cheese was burnt and turning into oil since it was in a cast iron skillet that just kept cooking the food as it sat therefrench toast/sausage/meatballs/bacon/potatoes | nothing special, but also not badcarving station | i skipped it but the hubs said the meat wasn't greatselection of 2 cheeses | no signs so i didn't know what they were, and no crackers to accompany themspread of bagels, sliced bread, and muffins | the bagels and bread here looked almost like the kind you get a a 3-star hotel's free breakfast... why would anyone eat it at a $50 buffet? also, there were signs with all the different honeys and jams they offered, clotted cream, cream cheese, and nutella. i did see the jams but no nutella was to be found. also, the clotted cream vs. cream cheese weren't labeled (nothing was labeled clearly) so it was hard to tell the which was which. oh, and muffins were akin to the free ones at holiday inns. not bad, but not what you'd expect at an 'upscale' buffet. yogurts | the stonyfield farms yogurt and plain oikos greek yogurt weren't worth getting. i grabbed a lucky layla banana yogurt since i had seen them at whole foods and wanted to try one. it was decent, but the whole time i was at the buffet i only saw 2 and they never replenished them. rare find? haha. cereal and granola | like literally fruit loops.sliced fruit | the typical/boring honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, and grapes. no berries, which are my fave! some of the honeydew was perfectly ripe though, so yay for that. they also had a couple selections of dried fruit. cocktail shrimp | pretty succulent/fat shrimp, but i'm not a huge fan of cocktail shrimp. these were higher quality than the regular grocery store ones though. some smoked salmon/cream cheese thing on some hard wheat toast | not bad, but there wasn't enough salmon to balance out the ratio of bread and cream cheesescrambled eggs and scrambled eggs+tomato mixed together | both were terrible, overcooked, and reminded me of middle school cafeteria foodbiscuits+gravy | biscuits were overly dry and not buttery or flaky, gravy was cold and too saltybananas foster | looked cool when they were making it but it was no bueno. there was no caramelization on the bananas and the ice cream melted onto the bananas instantly (literally before you could even get back to your table) so you were just left with an ugly soup. they should have done crepes! rest of the dessert spread was really disappointing, especially since i love love love desserts. they had a good number of options, but everything was just blah. the macarons were especially bad. idk if they were going for halloween themed or what but they were orange with a black filling, but horrendously chewy. i barely ate 1/3 of one and macarons are my favorite thing ever. the only dessert worth eating was the cheesecake and maybeee pumpkin cupcake. but honestly even those weren't that great. i was so excited for the nutella brownie but it turned out to taste dark chocolate-y.drinks options are decent | iced tea, juices (i think? but we didn't get any so not sure if they were included), hot tea selection (tea forte -- my fave), latte, and mimosas. i guess if we were really into drinking we could have gotten more of our money's worth with the mimosas, but we only drank like 1/5 of a glass each.overall, this buffet was a pretty big disappointment for the price we paid. and if this is the 'best' brunch in san antonio, that's pretty sad... this was basically a dressed up 3-star hotel continental breakfast. i probably ate $20 worth at most but paid $50+. & service wasn't great. won't be back. :/"], ["S W.", "Superb serviceSuperb gluten-free optionsSuperb coffeeSuperb locationWe really lucked out with superb weather, got a great table overlooking the riverwalk.

Las Canarias is definitely the exception, as it is clearly chef-driven. The dining room is very formal looking with white table cloths, but the outdoor area along the river is comfortably casual and very relaxing. Kudos to the staff and restaurant policy for graciously seating us very close to the posted closing time despite a slow night (our flight into town was late arriving).The food is definitely the focal point and the execution is every bit as good as the menu describes. The heirloom tomato salad is one of the more unique tomato salads with the inclusion of fried capers and Siracha, as well as fresh Parmesan. The Texas fried quail and waffles is among the more unique options among the appetizers. The Atlantic sea scallops were terrific as was the house-made parmesan gnocchi with Tuscan kale, pine nuts, butternut squash and golden raisins -- the only fault that I found with it was that they overdid the amount of squash. The wine list is large and interesting.The bread served (several types to choose from) is beyond delicious. Service is knowledgeable and professional, even if it wasn't terribly personable.Finding the place is tricky. It's in the Omni Hotel and there's a sign for the restaurant outside the hotel's front entrance, but once inside, there's no signs or directional signs, but after we asked, we knew to take a series of long odd hallways.

Since it was midday and I had my kiddo with me, we opted to sit on the non-entertainment side. The inside of the restaurant is adorably decorated with fun, Latin colors. Our server (I forget her name, but she was phenomenal), greeted us promptly and explained some of the menu choices. This lady was seriously the sweetest server! We opted for the sampler platter to start. I got the pumpkin seed-encrusted goat cheese salad (sans meat), my mom got the strawberry spinach salad with chicken, sis got the chicken dish (from the grill) and my kiddo got chicken tenders. They start you out with this delicious cornbread and butter, which was perfectly flavored. The sampler platter was so full of flavor, I did not want it to end! Everything was so fresh and authentic. And my salad? Hands down the best salad I have ever tasted. My kid's chicken tenders were HUGE, real chicken tenders, not some little sh*t McDonalds fake mess. They were legit. My sister let me try some of her grilled chicken (in a pesto-like sauce) and mashed potatoes, and I was even more impressed.

This was our first time dining at Azuca and we left hungry. The interior is nicely decorated with bold colors and lively music is played(which I loved). Most items I sampled lacked a \"wow\" factor and flavor. The ceviche was bland and tasted fishy, the flat bread chips did not pair well. Their tortilla soup was too thick for my liking and reminded me of familiar canned tomato products. Our entrees failed to impress with a small portioned Mahi-Mahi and the sides were generic(didn't match the menu). However, my pork shank pibil was quite tasty and tender. When dessert arrived we both had a little chuckle, the tres leches cake was incredibly small but the BEST thing we had. Everything in that tiny little sliver of cake was perfection, I would definitely return to have another slice but not a tiny teaser. Service was alright but nothing personable.

Loved the starter cornbread--so yummy that a little bird even picked at my sister's crumbs when she stepped out to the bathroom. I had the ahi tuna, which was very nicely plated and very generous! Loved everything together--the fish was tender (even though I had accidentally ordered medium instead of rare--my stupid mistake). I really liked the flavor by itself, as well as with the dijon mustard and balsamic! The potatoes looked plain but were very tasty. I had more than enough pickled onions, but they were really yummy so it was good that I had some to share!My parents had the 12 oz steak, which looked delicious. Especially with the chimichurri sauce and roasted veggies! My sister had paella, which she really liked and came with a generous amount of seafood. For dessert, we had the tropical creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which came in a HUGE dish, but was very shallow. However, I really liked that because it allowed for more crispy parts and was well balanced with the caramelized fruit. Such a lovely and delicious meal--everybody left full and satisfied!

Capirihnas, margaritas, mojitos $5 for happy hour were pretty good. \u00a0We also tried the guacamole and chicken quesadillas which were skimpy but ok. \u00a0The chips were a little overdone, but ok. \u00a0Our bartender Adrian wad friendly and helpful. \u00a0Not sure if this warrants a return trip, but i would like to try on a weekend or first Friday when there might be a little more action. \u00a0They had a really cute looking patio area in the back that might be nice with some music and a crowd!"], ["Briana S.", "Came here for some guac and cocktails to catch up with a college friend of my friend Chris.

We shared an order of freshly made guac, which was amaze balls. I love avocado, but this was especially good, and was served with fresh tortilla crisps.Even though it was not prime time, our server was great about checking in with us to make sure we had what we needed.Again, we stopped in for a quick cocktail, but if this was any indication, I'd love to come back and explore their menu further...

We had the same experience as the first time and to make matters worse they take 25% out of groupon for tip. I felt like the waitress didn't care how she treated us because she was getting her tip anyway.

This place has both indoors and outdoors dining areas. The indoors area divide in to two physical locations: Dining and bar.

They didn't skimp on their air conditioning.We came during their happy hour. $3.50 for domestic beers and their appetizers. Beers are served ice cold, no qualms about that. Appetizers were decent. I had their sausage and quesadilla. The sausage was exactly as expected, greasy, salty, meaty, and totally delicious. The quesadilla was served with some guacamole and sour cream. Given that they're appetizers, naturally they're quite small. I was just a bit disappointed over the lack of corn tortilla option for the quesadilla, but that's quite common among tex-mex places. Service could be faster, too. My appetizers came about 30 minutes after I ordered.All in all, I'd probably go back on my next trip to try out their other dishes."], ["Jane A.", "I Visited Azuca for the second time ever, yesterday. There were 7 of us, all ladies, in the party. We ordered the very berry mojito pitcher, as this was suggested to us by the server (he said it was a popular flavor).

There were no mint leaves (at all), and no mint flavor. This was very disappointing. Otherwise, The service was great, Food was delicious, And the original Mojito was much much better."], ["Eddie V.", "This is great Latin-American food, non-Mexican just so that you have the right expectations set. \u00a0The Fireballs were a delicious appetizer and the Ropa Vieja & Paella were both extremely good with their own twist on the classic dishes.

That brings me to my next review, my first meal at Azuca. Things started off well with a close location, their own parking lot, and nice atmosphere. We were quickly seated and welcomed by our waitress, we ordered and were then brought a nice serving of cornbread. Unfortunately things went downhill from there. I ordered their 12oz NY steak medium rare, this came out closer to medium well.My girlfriend ordered their tuna steak medium, this came out rare. I believe our server must have given our table to her co-worker b/c she never came back to our table but when a different waiter asked about our food I reluctantly mentioned that my steak had been over cooked. He apologized and took it back to the kitchen. About ten minutes later he returned with another steak, this one was cooked correctly but somehow was cold, I don't know if it had originally been frozen or what. The waiter came and asked if there was something wrong with this steak since I'm sure he noticed that I had only eaten a bite of it so I confessed that for some reason it was really cold, he kind of shrugged so I asked for a box so I could heat it up at home. He left and came back with a box and our bill for $50 and that was that. No manager and no apology. The mash potatoes that came with the steak were good and the steak looked good so maybe I'll update my review after I heat it up now that I'm home.Update-Went back on 08/09 and had a much better experience. The sea bass was top notch as was the ceviche we got as an appetizer!"], ["Mathivadhanan M.", "Great lunch place. Good food, everything on the lunch menu is finely prepared and plating is great.

I agree with other reviews here. Guacamole was awesome. \u00a0Parillada Mixta was good, the seasoning perfect, but the pork and especially the chicken were over cooked. Great selection of rum here.

Loved the ambience and decor. \u00a0As recently relocated Cuban-Americans we have been searching for authentic Latin flavors here in San Antonio. \u00a0Azuca gave us a taste of Caribbean Latin fusion - a little bit Cuban, a little Puerto Rican, some Dominican along with a splash of south American. \u00a0 The mofongo was great, as were the tostones! \u00a0Ropa vieja was good although the Moros were not authentic - more like black bean soup with white rice.Husband loved the mojitos, and felt the parillada was good.

My friend and I came here expecting traditional latin food (I'm from NYC and she's from Miami so we know our way around latin food) but instead the menu presents a twist. I ordered the fireballs, fried balls of potato, bacon and jalapeno bites with crema and pesto. They were delicious and filling. Definitely recommend!My friend ordered the shredded pork arepa and mofongo. She did not like either dishes. The arepa was not a traditional fried tortilla with cheese. It was more of a sandwich with corn bread as buns. The mofongo tasted different and after a few bites, my friend pushed it aside.SERVICE: Our waiter was inattentive and rude. We were there around 4pm so it was NOT rush hour. Yet, we had to wait to have our order taken and drinks to be served. When we asked for the check, my friend mentioned that the dishes were not to her liking. Our waiter did not respond and instead quickly cleared the table. He then gave us our check but did not come back for it. We waited a good 10 minutes before asking another waiter to clear the check.PRICE: Appetizers are decently priced. Entrees are $20+.LAST WORD: Would not recommend unless there's a tried and true dish you like."], ["David M.", "Great place! Stumbled onto it when La Frite nearby was closed. Top shelf, Texan & Aguave mojitos were excellent. Started with the guacamole and the tostones, both very tasty. Cuban Ropa Vieja was outstanding, with wonderful flavors.

Our appetizers were then served AFTER our dinner. \u00a0David, our server, would disappear for long stretches of time and for some reason added an automatic gratuity of 20% to our bill.

Reminiscent of a Moscow Mule minus the ginger beer, these go down far too easily. Be careful, lest you find yourself dancing to the outstanding live music like a poorly-coordinated middle-aged white guy who has forgotten that perhaps his hips *do* have the ability to lie.So for appetizers, the Ceviche trio is amazing. A scallop, shrimp, and fish version make up a delicate and fresh sampler on delicious chips. For dinner, team up with someone else and order the Espada Rodizio. Seriously. It's a sword's (not a skewer) worth of various meats and vegetables over some sort of rice. By the time we got to the main course, I was throwing back the drinks like the first night of a three-day bender, so while I remember that it was amazing, the details have become a bit cloudy.I wasn't so drunk that I don't remember the bread pudding however; this is a must-have. It's gooey and soft, with ice cream, and it melts in your mouth, which sounds like a cliche, but is literally true in this case.The service was AMAZING, our wait staff and manager stayed table side the entire night to make sure that we felt welcome and well-served, and it was a great experience.

We were approaching an hour since entrees ordered with no adult beverages. You only saw one server attending his tables frequently and two assistants. I had to approach the other server to ask for our server as the assistants couldn't do drinks. I guess his solution is avoidance with good delays. Once food arrived it seemed to improve.

Great place to bring a group of people for a special event. I came here with my family for a graduation and the restaurant did a great job accommodating a big party.

It is a great little hidden spot that not many locals seem to know about, but definitely should. There is salsa dancing on Saturday night with an excellent live music from Orquesta Tropicante. The dance floor is small and becomes crowded, and the \"drinkers\" and \"watchers\" tend to stand and take up space but I have noticed that if you get really close to them and shake your hips a little they either decide to dance along with you, or get nervous and move out of the way!! I have also dined here on multiple occasions and even hosted a surprise birthday dinner here for my best friend a few years back. The waitstaff is always attentive , Arturo is my favorite, and they go out of their way to make sure you are accommodated. It is also nice to see that they all work together. The owner comes by to say Hi and check on your table if he is there..,,,Nice touch.The food is really tasty and fresh and you can even make a meal by ordering several appetizers. Portion sizes are generous - and I can put away some food! Try the Plantains Amarillos, Ceviche Trio ( fish, shrimp, scallops ) and the Chilean Sea Bass is always a safe bet! I have never had any of the drinks but all of my friends rave about their mojitos. So, what the heck, try one of those too!!P.S. If you want a romantic dinner, earlier is better. A lot of tourist and business groups come in the later part of the evening. And they are LOUD! :)"], ["Sean A.", "Going to this restaurant was an extreme disappointment; I would never go here again. We went for Happy Hour. Something that other customers had been raving about on this site. Arrival:We arrived a little after 4 and upon entering the court yard found ourselves lost. It wasn't until a few minutes had passed that we were greeted by Ruiz the Owner. There was a lost look on the owners face as if he wasn't expecting any customers. I instructing him that we were here for Happy Hour. There were at most 2 tables occupied upon our arrival. The owner asked if we preferred to be seating outside or inside. I said outside and no other communication was given. No one lead us to a table. Instead we found ourselves a table. The table had not been cleaned it had leaves and water on it. A server from the Bar came and cleaned the table. So far not so bad. Order:He brought us 2 menus neither of which were the Happy Hour Menus. I asked him for the happy hour menu; it took 5 minutes or more for him to bring us the happy hour menu. Along with the menu he brought us Ice water. At that time he asked us for our drink order. We ordered 1 drink. The order was delivered quickly by the server. At that point we ordered off the Happy Hour Menu. Fish Tacos, Chicken Negro, and Guacamole. They all sounded good. Up to this point I would set our service level at about average. It was upon receiving our drink and making the food order that our experience went from average to highly negative.Drink:The drink was a Guava Frozen Margarita. The only thing you could taste in it was watered down Guava juice. Food:It took approximately 45 minutes to get our food. Yes, I said 45 MINUTES to get Bar food (Happy Hour Remember?). During these 45 minutes nobody came to see how we were doing: No one came to give us silver wear, No one asked if we wanted additional drinks, or if we had enjoyed our drink or even to refresh/refill our waters. \u00a0And upon receiving the food that we long waited for we were even more disappointed. No silver wear was delivered with the meal, and the proportions were miserable. \u00a0Let's take it 1 item at a time:Fish Tacos: Two small tortillas with a few strips of fish, lettuce, Tarter sauce, and Pico. The fish tasted fresh but the food had absolutely no flavor.Chicken Negro: 4 extremely small chicken strips that would not even feed a gold fish. smothered in BBQ sauce.Guacamole: Is supposed to come with Pico. No Pico came with the order. The guacamole was a good proportion but with just 4 chips.Since no one delivered us any silver wear we had to resort to eating with our hands. Final a Bus Boy had came to clean other tables and I told him that we were missing the Pico on our Guacamole order and we didn't receive any silver wear. He said ok and came back after about 2 minutes with the Pico. No silver wear. Complaint to Manager:I had it at this point, and I asked another bus boy to get us the manager. It took approximately 10 minutes for the Manager to come and visit us. It took another bad look by me at the bus boy and 2 tries by the bus boy to get the manager to come to our table. When the manager came I explained as outlined above. How miserable our experience had been. And she asked what she could do to improve our experience. I asked her \"You tell us?\". After receiving no answer to my query. I asked her to comp our meal. She was surprised, and said that she would find out what she could do. She came back after 5 minutes and on her way to our table met with the owner and pointed at us and said something to the owner and waived her had down as if we were just being a nuisance. Manager's Response:She came to our table and told us that the most she could do was to give us a 50% discount. The whole ticket was for $14. Are you kidding me? Even the statement of 50% of was not accurate. She only took off $6.00 on a $14 ticket. \u00a0I didn't want to argue any more, I gave her my card. She asked us to come again. And I told that wasn't going to happened. Owners Response:Then after about 5 minutes the owner Ruis came with the check in hand. He told us that he was sorry with the level of service that was delivered to us. And to give him another chance. And I again repeated the reasons why we wouldn't be coming back. He gave me the ticket to sign, and I did just that and told him that I would give my feedback to future customers. He was disappointed to hear that. I feel sorry for the guy but that doesn't mean that other people should have to be disappointed, and then pay for bad behavior."], ["Ricky R.", "I love this place. I ordered the mofongo and Chicka Mix Grill, the Chicka Mix was one of the best dishes I've had in a while. The Chimichurri on the chicken and churrasco was crazy good and for $10.50 for that huge plate at lunch was crazy too.. The mofongo was ok, it needed more sweetness from the plantains, the Mix made up for it tho. We had the sangria and you should too. It was strong and had muddled fruit, happy hour prices are insane, $3.50 drinks, had to drink half because I had to drive. (sob) Wait staff was on point as well.

I love ceviche and this appetizer was the BEST I've had in Texas since I moved here from Chicago 2 years ago, whew- finally! Then the very friendly waitress came out and introduced the menu and explained that we could help a local student pay for cooking classes, if we chose from a special menu. How sweet and amazing. My sisters and I all work in non-profit, so we were all over it. I had the beef chimichurri /sausage plate with potatoes. It had a great kick, steak was so tender and flavorful.

I would've rated this place four stars if not for the dismissive waiter . . .

I've dined and lunched at Azuca a few times and have been delighted every. single. time. I like it so much that I even reserved a table to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday this past weekend. All of our friends, even the pickiest eaters among them, were satisfied and impressed. My own boyfriend, a super geeky guero prone to a boring palette, found their menu irresistible. I was able to reserve a table for 15 people on a Saturday night without any fuss or drama. Our waitress was outstanding and made the dining experience a breeze. She also made some spot-on menu recommendations, including their Puddin Criollo, which could very well be the best dessert I have ever had in my entire life. All the dishes I've tried have been incredible, including the Tuna Negro (my favorite) and their Ropa Vieja. If you are feeling ambitious and/or want to share something with a hot date, try their Espada Rodizio. I repeat, you must be feeling ambitious and/or share this dish with someone, as its generous portion and theatrical presentation is only matched by its amazing and memorable taste. What's that? You on a diet? Azuca also has some of the best tiradito and ceviche around. I would skip the mojitos and try something more adventurous from their drink menu. The Caipirinha and the Pizco Sour will make you wish you had brushed on your Rosetta Stone or at least have memorized a Julio Iglesias song. Seriously, people. I'm not Cuban or Puerto Rican, but in my opinion Azuca pays a great tribute to all Caribbean-infused and spanish cousine. \u00a0 And for those fellow yelpers out there complaining about Azuca's prices, there are PLENTY of cheap choices out there for your cheap dates.

Apparently if someone reserves the bar area ahead of time the staff will only tell you 15 minutes prior after you have been there an hour. And then there is nowhere else to sit so it basically is an invitation to leave. Would have been nice to know when your group sits down. Every party sitting at that portion of the bar was basically given an invitation to leave because someone had that area reserved. Gosh that sure makes me want to come back and spend my money. If you are a risk taker then please enjoy their excellent drinks and food. Just keep in the back of your mind they don't care about the customer. They care more about a group that brings in more revenue. Besides you already spent your money.

The pasta was nothing special and the oysters, according to my husband who ordered the dish said they tasted as though they had been deep fried from frozen (sorry). I liked them just fine.

And left knowing a couple things. 1) The service was excellent, Josh our waiter was informative, tentative, but not pushy and hovering. 2) The cooks can really cook great food, but maybe got distracted on a few dishes. 3) The manager, Joseph last night, strived hard to achieve customer satisfaction, and in my eyes it was well appreciated. So for last night we wanted to try soooo many things that we just kinda ordered tapas style, 1 entree split, and some dessert. First up we had the duck rolls and chicken fried oysters. The duck rolls were light and crispy with a magnificent sweet sour glaze that accompanies it. Would strongly suggest them as well as the chicken fried oysters which were breaded nicely with sauteed spinach underneath and a mustard hollandaise above. Both were excellent. Next we got the bacon scallion mac n cheese, but the waiter informed us it was now green chili orzo, which was ok with me as long as it had bacon and scallions. I don't understand why the menu hadn't changed. We also ordered they're garlic mashed potatoes. The green chili orzo was amazing and the added bacon and scallions provided a great texture as well. The mash they sent out arrived lukeworm at best, and was replaced with a hotter version of such. The potatoes were creamy and garlicky and really good. Oysters in the half shell was up next and it came with cocktail sauce, fresh horseradish and a mignette sauce which was really vinegary and tangy but went well with the oysters. We finally decided on the pan seared redfish and sweet potatoes yukon potatoes hash with asparagus and bbq style shrimp. Not gonna lie, I was very very excited by this dish when I read it. But the execution and performance did not meet mine. The asparagus was greatly overcooked, as was the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and the shrimp. The redfish was not \"seared\" at all and had no texture whatsoever. Joseph, the manager, however made the effort to make it right, and I appreciate that. We were then offered dessert menu and wine, I eagerly jumped for the coconut cream pie, while my gf got the cheesecake. The presentation on both was the exact same! Seems lazy to me and highly uncreative. For 10$ slice dessert you should step your game up. The coconut pie was extremely lackluster and highly lacking the coconut flavor described as toasted. The cheesecake however was amazing, light and airy, not as dense as others that I have had. Yes there were mistakes and ya some flavors weren't present that were described but the service and manager made it a great night and made me want to go back.

Wonderful service and cuisine. Never realized they did brunch, it was absolutely fantastic! Omlettes, eggs Benedict, try the pork dish for brunch.

The waitstaff is great; they really seem to know how to gauge the table for when we want to sit and talk, and they know how to magically appear out of thin air whenever we want their attention. That skill is all too rare these days, and that alone made me want to like this restaurant so much more than I did. The food, however, is mediocre, and no amount of quality service can offset that.For appetizers, we started off with crab cakes and seared foie gras. The crab cakes were very good: inch-thick chunks of crab meat just barely held together with breadcrumbs and egg, and very lightly seasoned, so the flavour of the crab really came through. The foie gras was tasteless and bland-- a feat I did not even know was possible. I mean, when you start with MEAT BUTTER, you'd have to try pretty hard to make it NOT delicious. I don't know if they buy from a low-quality distributor or if the preparation was just uninspired, or both; in any case, avoid this dish. Our server graciously replaced it with the carpaccio, which was much better. The carpaccio was a bit thickly sliced, though the texture did not suffer for it; the arugula was perfectly dressed, and this dish was totally solid.Our entrees were the fried oysters and the chicken breast. I'm allergic to oysters so I can't comment on my date's dish, but he seemed to like it well enough; the chicken breast was tasty. I had a side of mac and cheese which was really disappointing... it would have been better named \"mac and cream.\" If there was any cheese at all in that ramekin (which I'm not convinced of), it was fontina. The bacon and scallions were nice and prevented this from being completely tasteless, but mac and cheese that fails to be CHEESY is a crime and a sin. Give me sharp cheddar or gruyere or parmigiano reggiano or even pecorino romano; I should be able to taste CHEESE in the mac and cheese.We had the cheesecake and the bread pudding for dessert. The bread pudding was tasty but rather dry; the cheesecake was light and fluffy rather than heavy and rich.There's a certain level of quality I expect for $60 per person, and Silo did not meet it. The service was wonderful and the ambience is nice, but unless their menu finds some inspiration, I won't be back."], ["Hope S.", "Hands down, most uncomfortable bar stools \u00a0in San Antonio! \u00a0Play it safe with wine/beer--anything not prepared by bartenders GREAT food"], ["Raven Z.", "Great happy hour....Moses is a good person is kind of slow in the head but he's a good guy.

He is unprofessional and literally drank all night long while supposedly being on the clock. I ended up with a $60Bar tab but yet I only ordered two appetizers at the $5 happy hour pricing and one cocktail at the happy hour pricing $5. Apparently he was offering \"free samples\" and \"free shots\" to a groupOf select patrons who I happened to be sitting and chatting with (great people who I met at the bar). Mind you, he also charged me for his round of shots he had while on the clock. I abruptly closed out my tab and went to leave as he was offering another round of \"free shots\". He got mad at me and told the other patrons that I didn't tip him on the lady's round. He also showed them my receipt from my bill. How embarrassing? I didn't tip him because he charged me for his drink (while on duty) and for three samples of fireball whiskey. He literally poured two tablespoons in each shot glass and charged me for it. It wasn't even the equivalent of a real shot. Plus I had tipped him when I had closed out my tab after my one drink and appetizer. Harold is rude, ignorant, offensive and a major slacker. He really should be fired for insulting paying customers. The food was cold and had been sitting around. Save yourself from going to a sub standard bar and go somewhere else. I won't visit ever again and will be calling management in the morning. Why would a bar tender show other people someone else's bill? I believe my credit card information was on there.

I will absolutely be returning and will change my review to five stars if they keep impressing me. My first experience was on Valentine's Day so I'm assuming they brought out their A game...we shall see.It's hard to say what my favorite part of the meal was, because each course was really wonderful. Personally, I wasn't super crazy about the chicken fried oysters. They are very good, but maybe I just prefer my oysters from the raw bar. Side note: the sauteed garlicky spinach bed the oysters sit on is oh-so-scrumptious. I really loved their Texas heirloom tomato salad. I'm a pesto fanatic and theirs was a great compliment to the tomato and mozzarella. The quail is tasty, I've never had quail so the small, bony bird was a pain to eat, but tasty nonetheless! Seafood paella was most memorable I suppose. The rice was cooked to perfection and WOW they provided a large, succulent helping of lobster tail and claw, in addition to the clams and mussels. I was impressed, as I'm used to many other restaurants being stingy with the lobster and overcooking it. We also enjoyed the wine pairings with the meal, my favorite ended up being their pinot noir from Meiomi...fantastic. I rarely drink reds.Like I said, maybe the A team was working but our server was the best. Food was quick, server was inquisitive and friendly. Silo is very swank...taking the elevator up adds to the ambiance. The bar downstairs was not packed, but sitting against the window you can feel the thumping base and people watch. If you're coming to Silo for a quiet, romantic meal request to sit opposite the window side. I barely noticed it, but I could see how pickier patrons might find it bothersome."], ["Carly P.", "Love this place. Always great food and service. Perfect for date night.

Like another viewer suggested, the service was impeccable. Our server perfectly timed everything, was attentive, and was just the right amount of friendly. I wish he could be cloned as a server everywhere I go. Other readily servers assisted us when ours was occupied. We brought our three year old because we were celebrating a birthday, and she was treated like a little queen. I didn't expect that, but immensely appreciated it.We started with the chicken fried oysters. We could tell right away that they weren't fresh. The batter was great, but they weren't anything more than mediocre, and I wouldn't order them again. The spinach salad was also just okay. Not anything memorable about it at all. I ordered the vegetable risotto and it was good, but not great. I don't ordinarily order risotto so I couldn't compare it to much else. My husband ordered the salmon and it was perfectly cooked, but I honestly make a more flavorful one at home. My dad's potatoes were cold when he was served them (the timing seemed to be off in the kitchen) and we told our waiter. He offered us dessert, which was nice, but still frustrating since it was my dad's birthday. I tried my moms chicken and this was the highlight of the dishes; hands down one of the best roasted chickens I've ever had. The skin was crispy and flavorful, the breast was juicy and tasty and I regretted not ordering this instead! We tried two of the desserts, and the coconut pie stood out. It was very rich, but perfect to share with a few at the table. Very good flavors and lots of cream, but not too sweet. I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.

Expectations were high given the price tag, but delivery was almost as low as the room temperature (seriously, I would love to see their cooling bill).My wife and I started with the famous chicken fried oysters. I found them to be inconsistent--some were nicely done while some where chewy and overcooked. The green veggie they sit atop as a complement was also well done and watery, which is hardly a good textural complement to oysters when you're trying to retain the crispy chicken fried goodness on the outside. Strike one. Next up was the crab cake appetizer that is described in a mouthwateringly southwest way on the menu. I was expecting a nice complement of explosive flavors--from sweet to spicy to rich. \u00a0Instead I got a de-seeded bland jalape\u00f1o and a relatively pedestrian profile that didn't live up to the description. Strike two. The third appetizer we shared was the tuna, which was by far the best dish of the evening. The tuna was cooked perfectly, and the seaweed salad, avocado and sriracha were great complements of pickled, briny and spicy. As our final dish, we shared the weathervane scallops. They went the extra mile to pre-split the dish, which was a really great service touch. The scallops were also cooked to perfection. However, I found the overall dish to be pretty bland. This was served with wilted garlic spinach and a roasted tomato. As you might expect, the result of these two executions was water--just want I don't want running into my saffron buerre blanc and wonderfully-crusty scallops.

We first learned about Silo after visiting Nosh, which is located downstairs in the same building (and happens to be great as well).My wife and I are in our early twenties, and every time we come here we are always the youngest people in the place by around 5 years or so. That should tell you something about the atmosphere - it's upscale, but we are never made to feel out of place.The food is consistently very good. It is solid \"new American\" cuisine. The signature chicken-fried oysters are my favorite pick; they combine the nice saltiness of the oysters with that wonderful comfort flavor and mouthfeel of the deep fryer. My wife loves when they have the lamb special, and I don't blame her - it's always cooked perfectly and served on a yummy bed of garlic mashed potatoes and cooked veggies.The waitstaff is pleasant and attentive. Some waiters are a little more knowledgeable about the dishes and available wines than others, but overall they are very helpful.I am giving three stars because the food - while good - does not quite match the pricing. I only come here when a Groupon is available because I feel like the price for the meal after the discount is applied is what the price should normally be. Maybe that is why we are always the youngest couple in the restaurant!"], ["John H.", "About as good as it gets. Awesome food, great service and that special something that pulls the place together... and in this case that something is an elevator. To get the big rock out of the way, I love love love how the dining area is separated from the lounge and bar. It's a little bit of anticipation, wow factor and giddiness on the ride up. Almost like Willy Wonka... what's behind the doors when the elevator stops? Teehee!A couple standouts were the duck spring rolls, both tenderloins (pork & beef) and the bread pudding. Everything was above average, but those kept conversation going in the car on the way back.

The kitchen was able to change the sauce that accompanied the mussels (from red to a buttery garlic; much better). My salmon was delicious.When we arrived we told the hostess that we would need a high chair for the baby. She called upstairs to let our server know. However, when we got upstairs we still had to wait (good thing he's a good baby!). Our server took our drink order; vodka martini was terrific; however, bottled beer was not icy cold. Wine selection was substantial. My husband was pretty miffed, however, that our server didn't tell us it was half-price wine night until we paid the check! A MAJOR faux pas in my book. And I didn't see that our server had more than his share of tables, but our service was pretty slow. Who wants to fill up on bread??Although it was good, I agree with another reviewer: I won't go back unless someone else is paying.

Before heading up to the dinner area we hung out at the bar downstairs with the personable and friendly bartender, and was expecting good service after that. My guy asked her if she had hair gel (omg embarrassing) and she found it for him at the bar to fix his pretty hair. It was a Monday evening and super slow, and that was good since we needed to catch the Spurs game. I don't see why we couldn't get excellent service. Our waitress never asked us what we were celebrating and was all over the place with our orders, she even wrote them down, how can you mess up Caesar salad and give us spinach. I ordered a side dish to go with my entree and I asked if that was coming out and she said yes, but then went to punch in the order! So, I said never mind on that and was given to me anyway no charge. By this time fiance was wondering if she was high... this was the first birthday dinner I ever had without dessert! Pretty sad birthday and sad service, with every thing sad, food wouldn't be as good cause we are complaining about the service =P On to the grub this is what we ordered and shared.

My only complaint was that the salad was a bit light on bleu cheese (but I'm bleu cheese fan, so the more the better.)Dinners were very good. My wife enjoyed her Jumbo Lump Crabcake. I was slightly less thrilled with the salmon and crab. The salmon seemed a bit unevenly cooked--parts were a bit overcooked while other parts were excellent.

My husband had the pork shank and his just fell off the bone. So tender and a taste experience you must try. I never imagined pork tasting so good. Let's just say we cleaned our plates. To finish - bourbon bread pudding. I can't say enough about how great everything was. Well worth every penny and more. We will be back when we come in town again.

Went with 2 others who agreed. Started with the oysters sliders. Biscuit was light and delicious, but oyster flavor was completely absent. Taste of blind and you'd have no idea there were oysters. Snapper was extremely overcooked and overseasoned. Risotto was flavorless. Lamb was outstanding, best of the bunch, but again weird components. Fresno chiles were out if place. The duck was confounding. Each component was good, but didn't go together at all. The salad and Brussels sprouts were totally out of place. And, even more upsetting, was that I'm eating here in August and they're serving sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Dessert, on the other hand, was outstanding. Pot de creme and key lime pie were both great. But, again, composure issues. Why was there vanilla bean ice cream with pot de creme? Most things were prepared well but the integration of ingredients and the ingenuity were completely lacking."], ["Jeremy G.", "Yup BLISS lives up to the hype!

Luckily because of a cancelation we got a table for 10.Once we arrived at the restaurant we were given two seating options, dining room or the chef's table. Wait, what?! Chef's table please! I highly highly recommend the chef's table. It's an awesome experience to be in the kitchen to see and smell everything behind the scenes. It's also more private so you can be as loud as you want!For my meal I ordered the red snapper and shrimp risotto. The fish was cooked perfectly. But that risotto was so creamy and delicious with lovely pieces of shrimp mixed in. Next time I definitely want to get the rack of lamb or bronzino. The bronzino is served whole and carved table side!I also brought a birthday cake and our server informed me that there would be a ~$4 charge per person. What!? That's almost more than the cake cost! We agreed on just blowing out the candles and saving the cake for later. Luckily at the end of our meal they decided to waive the cake cutting fee! Cake for everyone!Overall awesome experience.

A large serving of grilled foie gras was a surprise and, of course the duck was magnificent! So rich and so delicious. And, yes, we did have room for dessert.

The layout of the restaurant is very modern and chic and I love that if you have a large enough party, that they have private rooms available to accommodate your. The noise level was very minimal which was appreciated because we did not feel as if we needed to shout across the table. The clientele is definitely the who's who in San Antonio, as I quietly spotted the Mayor seated at a table to the left of ours.The food was nothing short of amazing as was the service, provided by Rudy. I had a hard time choosing between the scallops and the duck. Someone else in my group ordered the duck so that I could be free to enjoy both entrees...yeah! The scallops and duck were both to die for. What I loved most about the duck was that it was very tender and did not taste gamey at all. Most of the restaurants that I frequent, usually only have Stag's Leap Chardonnay by the bottle and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Bliss offers it by the glass...score!!To finish off an amazing experience, I opted for the pecan pie...delish!"], ["G B.", "Quaint place with scrumptious food!

I wonder if they always charge that, tho? Hmm.Anyway, I started with the Caesar arugula salad...our server exclaimed it \"one of the top 10 best salads in San Antonio\". It was a deconstructed Caesar: an anchovy on a lemon slice topped with fried capers, bruschetta, and lastly a pile of arugula topped only with an oil and lemon dressing. The anchovy and bruschetta were good; the salad was WAY to citrus-y and overwhelming. I really tried to choke it down cause arugula is one of my favs. I was defeated. I def wouldn't order this again.For the main course, I had the scallops...AMAZING!! 2 big scallops wedged in some cheese grits, sauteed spinach, and topped with a ridiculously good avocado mousse. SO GOOD. My only regret was the \"doll portion\" as Sarah J said. I could've easily stuffed myself with those scallops all day and would return in a heartbeat to eat them again. 5 stars alone!For dessert, I had the chocolate cake...good way to end the meal, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Our server was excellent, funny, and clever. The ambiance is very clean, modern, and somewhat romantic. They have a great patio.

My waiter was actually nice and efficient which made me feel much better. That and two glasses of moscato! My friend and I ordered from the restaurant week menu. I got the pork belly app, lamb chop entree and chocolate dessert. She got the fried oyster app, sea scallops entree and cheese cake. The food was absolutely phenomenal, not gonna lie!

The roasted bone marrow was to die for. You must get it if you have dinner here one night. I had the beef tenderloin, but was able to try the duck and a fish dish (salmon? snapper?) and they were all very good. Above all, our waitress was so attending and kind to us. I didn't feel weird asking for something and she gave us her best suggestions (which all turned out to be amazing)."], ["Stephanie V.", "Went for my birthday last year.Brought new tastes and textures to familiar items like scallops and lamb.Really enjoyed our appetizers: Fried Oyster Sliders and Goat Cheese Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Seemed like our entrees were on the small side so I'm glad we ordered two appetizers.As compared to some of our favorite/similar-priced restaurants, it felt slightly overpriced for what we got.Good service. Good date night ambience. Just didn't wow me."], ["Bridget W.", "Came here during Restaurant Week with my SO and then again on an anniversary. Amazing foodie experience.Food is SO DAMN DELICIOUS. I dream about those oyster sliders. I've had the snapper and shrimp risotto. The skin on that snapper is crisp, the fish and shrimp are cooked perfectly, and the risotto creamy. I had it both times I went because it was that good. My husband tried the rack of lamb the first time and the pork and beans the second time. He absolutely loved both of them. We finished both times sharing the chocolate bar dessert. It is so amazing with all of the components. I love the popcorn and the almond along with it. The salt really contrasts the sweet, sweet richness of the chocolate. I would very much recommend doing a drink pairing. Absolutely perfect.The atmosphere is very chill, laid-back, and romantic. The service is great. The restaurant is clean and has decor that matches its atmosphere. It's a great dining experience. This is my absolute favorite restaurant in San Antonio."], ["Debbie P.", "Described as the best restaurant in San Antonio by my very sophisticated wine & food connoisseur brother. Husband & I dined here 11/14/15. A crisp, light excellent Pinot Gris. Lush beet salad & baby wedge salad-- don't be deterred by the online photo-- the best wedge salad I've had & it's my always go to salad when offered. We shared the red snapper with shrimp risotto-- perfect portion for two-- excellent flavors with mild jalape\u00f1o bite. Our table was perfectly situated to view the outdoor patio & flaming fire pit. Outdoor seating has significantly unobtrusive heaters & sarape blankets over chair backs-- how cool is that?! \u00a0I will look for those heaters for my Southern California patio. The hostess was charming & welcoming. Sam our waiter was exceptional in terms of grace, charm & knowledge. Meeting Mark Bliss was humbling--a wonderful restaurant experience-- most likely the best ever. I go to San Antonio once a year for a ballgame & will always come back & bring my Air Force friends.

My family knows a lot about high quality cuisine, and this is our favorite restaurant in San Antonio . Bliss uses high quality ingredients and blends them WELL. Real butter, good flour, wild fish... I have gotten the vegan platter every time and it NEVER disappoints, an array of legumes and beans whose flavor explodes in your mouth. Even my super carnivorous boyfriend raves about it! The wine is average and the desserts are subpar, floating in sauce and shoved under whippef cream. Nonetheless the food is good enough to give the restaurant a glowing five stars.Keep it up!"], ["Karina F.", "Where do we start? When my co worker told me about this place and made a reservation in San Antonio we fell in love!

The menu changes appropriately and stays new. I recommend the duck (no financial statements required) yet the branzino and scallops get high marks just the same. Sliders are fun to type about I see but go for the proper half shell with their incredible mignonette if you need an oyster boost. On that note, you simply cannot beat it for date night and that includes the married. Go for it twice."], ["John H.", "Damn this place is awesome. \u00a0Thanks Yelpers! \u00a0Came here with some work colleagues, we were tired and needed something special, and Bliss delivered. \u00a0It's off the tourist track, which for me is a big plus. \u00a0The ambiance is perfect for chatting with friends, laughing, and sampling amazing foods. \u00a0The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. \u00a0I'd say this is a perfect place to bring a bunch of colleagues after a long day at a boring conference. \u00a0Or a date. \u00a0Now for the best part: the food. \u00a0WOW. \u00a0Everything we tasted was phenomenal. \u00a0The fried oyster app was orgasmic. \u00a0Entrees were just great. \u00a0Everyone in our group was blown away by the creativity and quality of the food. \u00a0While our colleagues from the conference who didn't want to go \"all the way\" to Bliss stood in line at crowded restaurants on the Riverwalk, we had the best meal of our trip at Bliss. \u00a0I can't wait to go back."], ["SRinTX S.", "One of my favorite places to dine in SA. \u00a0Chef and his team do an amazing job.

Bliss is just simply one of the best restaurants I've been to EVER.Try the vegan platter, with about 14 million different creatively-prepared veggies and grains. On the other extreme from vegan, I also had the bone marrow, which was gorgeous and rich and served in way more generous portions than other places I've been. My dining partner had the duck with foie gras which was so good I had to shut my eyes to enjoy a taste of it. To top it off, the outside deck area is absolutely gorgeous. Ummmm....I already want to go back. Like tonight."], ["Lindsay R.", "Yes, the oyster sliders are just as good as everyone says they are, but don't sleep on the charcuterie plate. Always go for dessert.Date night favorite. I got reservations, but I'm not sure I really needed them for a random Wednesday night. I'd recommend them if you think about it in advance, and definitely still on a weekend, but if you get a hankering for upscale, creative food, don't let a lack of reservation keep you from trying. The service is wonderful here, and one of the reasons I recommend it to people looking for a romantic evening. They take care of you without being intrusive, and the dim, modern dining area is a nice place for intimate conversations with a date or a small group.The oyster sliders are a great starter. They come four to an order, and are arranged beautifully. Even if you're not a huge oyster fan, these are fried, but still incredibly tender. The bun they come on tastes fresh; it has an aioli, and the combination of the fried crunch, the savory creaminess, and the sweet bread makes for a rich flavor experience. There's a reason these little wonders are mentioned in so many reviews. I went with the charcuterie plate for my entree, because I was feeling carnivorous. The local chorizo and soppressata was pleasantly spiced, and balanced with the creamy white cheddar and ch\u00e8vre I ordered. The \"pork and beans\" was fall-off-the-bone tender and the cannellini beans absorbed the meaty gravy from the pork. The chocolate bar had a hint of coffee. It's super decadent if you like a flourless, dense chocolate cake.My partner's dessert might have been the only misstep. Because I'm both a pistachio and brittle fan, I saved that bite for last, but it was so chewy, it was more like super adhesive taffy. I chewed it for a good 10 minutes as it stuck to my teeth and made me fret for my dental work. It's a great idea, but just not well done."], ["Sarah J.", "Bliss is one of the most aptly named restaurants in San Antonio: the dining experience is definitely pure bliss! I was a bit nervous before dinner since I was organizing a dinner for a group of 10. To make reservations, you need to have a credit card number on file and sign a waiver stating that you are liable for $45 per person for last minute cancellations. Needless to say, I was pretty neurotic in making sure everyone was going to show up. Luckily, everyone did.We dined at Bliss for the very first time for Restaurant Week and were not disappointed! Bliss is pretty pricey in general, so the portions for the $35 RW dinner were smaller than usual to reflect the reduced price. That being said, it was still amazing! To start off, I tried the oyster sliders. They were super tiny and cute, like the size of a silver dollar. I wonder if the regular portion has larger sliders or just more tiny ones. I like the small size. They make it easy to share! The biscuits were soft and buttery, the oysters were nicely fried and topped with a creamy hollandaise sauce. Next up was the unequivocal star of the night: the sea scallops. The scallops themselves were seared to perfection: a nice buttery sear on the outside and a soft and not too chewy center. The scallops were resting on a bed of sauteed spinach a top a dollop of grits. I'm usually not a fan on grits but I think the mix of cheese and spinach on the grits makes them extra palatable. The dish also comes with an avocado mousse and a cilantro lime beurre blanc. The avocado mousse wasn't bad, but a little to citrus-y for me, but the beurre blanc was amazing! Of course, it literally translates to \"white butter\" and you can't go wrong with a big dollop of butter sauce paired with scallops. I could have licked the plate clean with that deliciousness! I finished the night off with the chocolate cake. I'm not much of a dessert person, so I wouldn't normally order dessert and this didn't blow me away enough to want to ever order it again apart from these prix fixe type menus. It was very cute plating, it came with ice cream, a caramel drizzle and a really cute caramel and sea salt popcorn garnish, but desserts just aren't my jam. The restaurant is cute and modern, our waitress was super nice and they even have a patio for al fresco dining when its not a million degrees outside. Perfect for date night!"], ["Dawn B.", "Bone marrow bone marrow bone marrow.. Is all I have to say.The outside patio is very nice but you will be eaten alive by Mosquitos.

Great ambiance and a really beautifully decorated restaurant. Our reservation wasn't ready when we arrived and so we were seated outside for drinks on a very nice patio. The service was great once seated but our waitress was a bit annoying. I'm not sure that every dish on the menu needs to be explained. We got some oyster sliders and sashimi tostadas to start which were both very good, as were the iceberg wedge and caesar salad. For mains we had a vegan platter, the veal chops, and the lamb and while they were good, there were aspects of the dishes that just didn't make sense. The lamb chops were cooked well, very tasty, with a very tasty sauce. However, they were served with a ratatouille and trio of meatballs in a tomato sauce which just didn't make sense to me as an accompaniment. There was just too much going on in the dish and I would have rather done without a few of the distractions and had a 3rd lamb chop or some simple vegetables.As for the veal, it was flavorful but a bit too soggy and a tad too rich. It was served with a nice arugala salad which cut the richness a bit but overall it was just ok.In short, I think that it's a nice restaurant with a great ambiance and very good food, but for the price I would expect it to be excellent and it simply wasn't."], ["H Y.", "Bliss is my favorite restaurant in Texas.good experience for me.taste is good and staff is great.I wanna go to here when anniversary."], ["Josh J.", "This is one of those places that may be expensive, but is more than worth it. \u00a0The fried oyster sliders were really good, considered ordering several more plates of it instead of an entree. \u00a0I tried the pork and beans entree for the traditional slab of meat with hearty side style dinner. \u00a0Nutritional balance that also tastes good. \u00a0Next, I wrecked that balance by getting the goat cheese cake with pistachio brittle. \u00a0The brittle was my favorite part of the meal. \u00a0Its thick brittle, crunchy yet gummy and full of flavor. \u00a0It will get stuck in your teeth in that pleasant way that requires you to work for your flavor experience. \u00a0Definitely try the goat cheese cake and brittle."], ["Kristin C.", "Wow! Absolutely amazing! I can't sing their praises enough. From the exquisite food to the exceptional service, our entire evening was a delight. We were there for a dinner party and had the best time.

This place is fantastic!My wife and I left Starfish after a few appetizers, cocktails and salad that were overall sub-par. We wanted to finish the night with a great meal, and of course, we headed straight for BLISS. Mark Bliss. (Yes, 007 reference included)We were greeted by a kind and lovely young woman who made us feel welcomed and important. She sat us right away and we were immediately served water and menus. Mind you, this was 10:30 at night, and the service was perfecto.Sam, our waiter, was attentive and had a great demeanor. We ordered two of the best appetizers I've had in awhile, here are the descriptions (which were described perfectly)Oyster sliders; crispy fried gulf oysters, candied bacon, buttermilk chive biscuits, spinach, brown butter hollandaise, chives.+Japanese Hamachi sashimi tostadas, roasted jalape\u00f1o avocado pico de gallo,ponzu, ginger slaw, aji amarillo yuzu vinaigrette. The Oyster sliders were AWESOME! Best eaten right away. They were very hot, the buttermilk biscuits were sooooo good, and the applewood bacon pieces were filled with great flavor. I ate 3/4 of them while my wife had the 4th. I would have ordered another plate of them but the rest of the food was just as good. The Japanese Hamachi Sashimi Tostadas might just be the best cold dish ever created. I could order three plates of these alone and be satisfied. Not to say one dish wasn't enough, as 3 pieces were served and they were quite sizable and filling. But I could binge eat on these, seriously. They were extremely refreshing, cool, tasty, yummy, and PERFECT. I'm dreaming of them right now.The main course we ordered ( and split ) was the -SNAPPER/SHRIMP RISOTTOPan roasted snapper, cilantro & shrimp risotto, tomatillos, jalapenos, saffron beurre blanc, Calabrian chili pepper oil, crispy lollipop kaleThis meal was the amazing finale to our amazing night! It was piping hot, cooked perfectly, served quickly, tasted unreal, and had some amazing crispy lollipop kale, which was charred perfectly and tasted spectacular! The risotto was simply incredible. The mix of the fish and risotto with the bits of shrimp guaranteed a slam dunk course. Would order again (even though there is SO many other options that I'm sure are just as supreme).We also had two great wines, a great Sauvignon Blanc a Cab. They were both spectacular. On the pricey side, but completely worth it.WILL go back in the next month or two to try some more dishes, and to re-order the Japanese Hamachi Sashimi by the dozen. If only they delivered... all the way across town... to my mouth.5/5 Stars. Bravissimo. GO HERE."], ["Chris E.", "Went here for my wife's birthday. Food was so, so good. Great menu! We were so tired of going to the same old steakhouses for our special occasions and this was a breath of fresh air! Amazing food and the best atmosphere. Make reservations and make them in advance. Was pricey but to be expected and frankly still probably less than the steakhouses because meals come w sides. So wife had the tenderloin and came with asparagus and potatoes. It was awesome. My only reason for not giving five-stars is that you can bring your own wine which is great BUT Bliss charges a $25 corkage fee per bottle. I thought this was high. We will be going back and this time I want to try a dessert!!"], ["Teri B.", "One of San Antonio's finest.

Having an ample parking lot attached is a definite plus and added to the ease and enjoyment of the evening.The food from the dinner menu was mostly amazing, with the exception of a foie gras pate which tasted more like butter than the earthy/animal richness of foie gras. Oyster sliders were super happy comfort food on little buttermilk & herb biscuits with mini cubes of bacon to contribute smokiness. Particularly notable were the Duck/Duck/Foie & Texas Red Snapper/Shrimp Risotto main dishes, great attention to flavour and texture contrasts. The Beef Tenderloin main was a well prepared restaurant staple & the George's Bank Sea Scallops are probably as good of a scallop dish as you can find away from a coastline. The two items we ordered from the dessert menu, Key Lime Pie & Watermelon Sorbet, were good but not on par with the food from the dinner menu. The cheese course might be a more fitting end to an otherwise flawless meal. Thoughtfully planned one page wine menu made pairing with dishes a simple choice. I enjoyed not being handed a wine \"book\", the one page menu was intuitive and allowed us more time to enjoy the meal and the company.Service was off the charts from the hostess to the server to the bus boys, everyone seemed happy to be working there. So refreshing to encounter informed and well treated staff. The owner and his wife came by the table at the end of the meal & it was nice to hear the story of the restaurant which is only in its third year of business.I recently transplanted to San Antonio from San Diego and was really hoping to be able to find an independently owned gem of a restaurant like this. My last couple of meals in San Diego were at Mille Fleurs & Market, I would say that Bliss is equal to either one of those restaurants in food quality and better than either one of them in location and design, I will be gladly returning to try the rest of their menu."], ["Venice P.", "This place! Coming from SF I have high standards for dining, both in ambiance and quality. This place did not disappoint!! Lovely brick walls and exposed beam ceilings. Very reasonably priced wines. I ordered the vegan plate. I am not a vegan, but I am a lover of all vegetables and DAMN. This. Was. Incredible. I can only imagine how amazing the other items on the menu must be. Do yourself a favor if you're in town visiting and treat yourself to an amazing meal at Bliss. The river walk is annoying and touristy. If you're a foodie this is only a mile away and you will enjoy.

His favorite was Wink, and he was sure we'd never find a similar concept. Well, I searched the internet and found Bliss. Their emphasis on local farming and vegetarian options caught my eye. I made a reservation for the weekend my mom and stepdad would be in town. We took them to Bliss for their Christmas present.Our server was friendly, approachable, and quite knowledgeable of the menu. All of the restaurant staff members were very polite, friendly, and down-to-earth. It was what we were used to in Austin. Now for the food. \u00a0I can only comment on the vegetarian food because my fiance and I are vegetarians. We started with the potato leek soup and the fall squash salad. The potato leek soup was so delicious, I wanted to lick the plate clean. The fall salad had tender squash, crisp kale, and delicious pomegranate seeds. The portion was quite hearty, too. It was scrumptious. \u00a0My mom and stepdad said they thoroughly enjoyed their oyster sliders.For our entree, my fiance and I both ordered the mushroom risotto, as it was the only vegetarian option. I dislike mushrooms unless they're very high quality. That is, if they taste like button mushrooms or something similar, I do not like them. Well, this risotto was AMAZING. It was so rich, complex, and flavorful. I ate the whole huge portion and I was stuffed. I even ate some of my fiance's, even though I was so full. It was just so delicious. It was also packed full of other vegetables. My mom had the red snapper and my stepdad had the scallops. They enjoyed their entrees as well. For dessert we had the chocolate bar. It was rich, decadent, and perfect. The service was perfect, the prices were far better than Austin, and we thoroughly enjoyed our night. My fiance, who was so sad that we had to leave Wink in Austin, wanted to go back again tonight!! We will definitely be back."], ["Victoria J.", "I was in San Antonio for a conference, and I decided to try out restaurants that have been recommended as the best in SA. \u00a0For me, the food at Bliss competes with what I've experience at top restaurants in major cities. \u00a0Service too.I started with the oyster sliders; I inhaled most of them and then slowed down to savor the last one. \u00a0The arugula and radicchio salad was wonderful. \u00a0A great mix of citrus and salt with the anchovies (or boquerones) and the crispy capers. \u00a0After these two dishes, I should have called it a night, but I went in for the duck/duck/foie gras, which was . . .

The fried oyster bits were tiny though. \u00a0For the entr\u00e9e I went with the duck three ways (5 spice, foie gras and confit). \u00a0The 5 spice wasn't anything to write home about but the confit and foie gras were delightful. \u00a0Everything was tasty.

I called Bliss within a few days of the big event and managed to get a reservation no problem with a party of 4 at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Good start! The service was impeccable from start to finish and the food was to die for. We started with some salads and soup and I had the mussels as my entree. I couldn't stop eating the thai curry broth... I practically slurped it up! Portions were appropriate for the price which is a pleasant surprise. Desserts were just as fab! At the table we had the goat cheese cheesecake, the pot de creme, key lime pie, and chocolate bar. Our server was very attentive without being overbearing and I'm pleased with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.

I'll take SA any day."], ["Daniel W.", "Bliss... what to say about a restaurant with a name as encompassing as such. To be short and to the point, the food is amazing, presentation is clean and crisp while the flavors are delightful. The low point of.the evening was the service from waitress of the table.

The website address foodisbliss.com is not lying and Chef Mark Bliss does a wonderful job with the menu. Seared foie gras is always a must and the last time I was there Chef Bliss accommodated requests for a foie gras entr\u00e9e that more than delivered. And you always want more than one fries oyster slider, so if you go with a group order at least two of those as starters. Not to be missed are the desserts- the key lime pie and goat cheese cheesecake are awesome and I'm a chocolate lover. If you ever have enough friends willing to drop a decent amount on a more than decent dinner I highly recommend the chef's table which is an experience culled by the chef with his selected offerings.

The wait staff was extremely knowledgable in the food and wine and they were very friendly."], ["Jamie H.", "my colleagues had highly recommended bliss, and it had been on my list of places to try. everything on the menu is intriguing and appealing, and it exceeded my expectations. i would recommend it as one of the top restaurants in the area. i also really appreciated the appropriate portion sizes, which is a bit rare around here.we started our dinner with the oyster sliders, sashimi tostadas, and a bone marrow tartare. the bite-size sliders came with little fried oysters, bacon, and a homemade buttermilk biscuit. i really enjoyed the sashimi tostados, which were perfectly balanced with a crisp tortilla, avocado, and spice from the jalapeno. my favorite was actually the bone marrow tartare, which was presented beautifully with a little spoon to scoop out the marrow and topped tartare to be placed on a parmesan crisp. so rich, but perfectly balanced and a wonderful amuse-bouche.following the appetizers, we split the fall salad. while simple, this was one of my favorite dishes. there were three types of roasted squash, served along side pomegranate seeds, toasted pepitas, and crispy kale.the entr\u00e9e list is smaller but bountiful, with options featuring every type of meat (lamb, duck, fish, beef, etc.) and an appealing vegetarian option. i selected the texas snapper with squid ink risotto. the skin was perfectly crispy, and the fish was moist and flaky. the risotto was light, savory, and balanced, and i enjoyed the tiny shrimp that were dispersed throughout. i also sampled the pork, which literally fell off the bone and melted in my mouth.we finished with the pot de cr\u00e8me and the key lime pie. the pot de cr\u00e8me had a light, oatmeal custard and wafer cookie crisp, served with some fresh berries and a touch of ice cream. the key lime pie was lightly tart and not too sweet, served over a chewy graham cracker crust.overall, the meal was excellent and i wish that i had been able to try even more dishes. i am already looking forward to my next visit."], ["Olya C.", "Fantastic food, beautiful building, attentive service. We had duck, pork and beans , bone marrow, pate. All dishes were excellent, prepared with love. Coming back tonight!"], ["Donna H.", "Great food, wine list and atmosphere! Oyster sliders were my favorite...I like anything with Hollandaise sauce! The Mediterranean Branzino was excellent with olives and fennel. The service is excellent. if you don't know what to order, leave it to them!"], ["Nicole F.", "After reading several reviews here on Yelp, we decided this would be an excellent place to go and spend my bonus check/our anniversary. Overall, it was good, but was it worth the price and the five-star rating... not in my opinion.However, before I really get into this review, let me just tell you all that I'm highly critical and having eaten at mind-blowing restaurants before, this just didn't really elevate cuisine in my humble opinion. For our appetizers, we had a charcutterie plate with prosciutto and two cheeses. This was a fantastic start! We then ordered the oyster sliders (a hit here on Yelp, so it seems) and pork belly. Overall these two dishes just lacked. They didn't have anything special or really any original flavors, and the oyster sliders were far too greasy for my liking. For our main meals, my fiance had the branzino of which I tasted and it was far overcooked for the fish flavor to really shine, but the de-boning at the side of the table added a certain table-side service element that was fun. I ordered the duck three ways and it was really the star of the evening! The waitress paired it with a fantastic red wine (which did lose it's sense of self within the meal), but that's OK with me considering the real hero was the protein. I enjoyed the duck three ways, but the best one was duck con-fit... it was succulent and flavorful. To finish our meal we had the brownie... I found it delicious but kind of dry. As for the service, it was excellent! I don't think I have a complaint. Our waitress would clear our empty plates in a timely manner, she had some great drinks recommendations, and really catered to our needs. She even showed us the chef's table in the back and introduced us to the kitchen staff. Even though there were no wow-factors in the food, I can definitely see us going back to try other items on the menu due to the service alone."], ["Denise P.", "What a great restaurant. \u00a0Made a last minute reservation while in San Antonio on a business trip. \u00a0I was pleased that we were not shoved in a corner despite making a reservation at 6:30 on a Friday night and even though the restaurant filled up quickly. \u00a0The service was fantastic and the food was so good. \u00a0I loved the choices on the menu - there was such variety and some of the options were really very different. \u00a0I was there with a co-worker who has some food allergies . \u00a0He wanted the scallops but could not eat the cheesy grits they came with. The server was so accommodating and offered several other options for a base so that he could have what he really wanted. \u00a0We started with a watercress pasta with various clams - unusual and delicious. \u00a0I had the duck with fois gras which could not have been more tender. \u00a0I will make Bliss the first place I go next time I am in San Antonio instead of the last!"], ["Jen B.", "Came here with my husband for a special meal.

The service was good."], ["Nick A.", "**** 1/2My girlfriend took me here for a birthday dinner last night. This is now by far the best meal we have had in San Antonio. The restaurant has a rustic modern ambiance with a hint of luxury. Fine dining without being stuffy. \u00a0A restaurant that doesn't come across as requiring a dinner jacket but is definitely worth dressing up for. Basically, there is a well deserved sense of occasion to the place. Moving on to the food, we started with the oyster sliders. Crispy oysters with the crunch of good fried chicken withholding all their briny goodness, dressed with some luxurious hollandaise and enveloped by teeny buttery biscuits. The candied bacon garnish is a nice touch. \u00a0Two bites and they are gone. Leaving you with a mouthful of flavor and sticking true to the law of diminishing returns. I had the pork belly and veal sweetbreads for my entree. The belly was smoky and sweet and was accompanied by a nice crunchy slaw. The sweetbreads were crunchy and creamy in their innards with a nice spicy sauce that the green ends of the gai lon nicely sopped up. I personally am a sucker for Kurobuta Pork and this dish payed a good homage to this special swine. My girlfriend had the scallops that were perfectly seared and served with some seriously rich cheesy grits with a hint of spice from the jalape\u00f1o beurre blanc. The chocolate bread pudding with dulce de leche sauce and caramelized bananas were a nice end to a perfect meal. The restaurant suggested wines by the glass that paired with each course upon our request and gave us two glasses of champagne with homemade strawberry sorbet for my birthday. We cannot wait to return. In fact we made reservations for another visit on our way out. I can definitely get used to eating here."], ["Brannon S.", "Just excellent all around.

The seared NY strip crostini with roasted Calabrese peppers and aioli was definitely one of the highlights. The pecorino with prosciutto and micro salad was up there as well.One of the star entrees would be there would have to be the marrow crusted filet. Melts in your mouth, and the richness from the marrow can't even be described.The wine selection is diverse, and you can simply ask a waiter if you are not sure what to pick out. The Manos Negros Carmenere is never a bad choice.My fiance and I both are 6'1\" or better, so the seating can feel a bit too cozy at times. Just a warning if you tower over that. I wouldn't say it detracts a star from the rating, though. You will be close to other people, but will most likely not even notice once food hits the table. If you need an intimate setting to celebrate or just have a date night out on the town, this is it. It feels like you're in a European bistro, right off the Riverwalk."], ["Marta H.", "Amazing.....

On the tab, antipasto platter with prosciutto, salami and buffalo mozzarella, seafood paella, filet mignon, roasted red potatoes, Bellini and some Shiners. The food was delicious except the filet. To be honest, we had to send one back because it was over but even the perfectly cooked steak was a tad bland. The meat itself though was a quality piece and it melted in your mouth. Everything else was absolutely mouth watering. The seafood paella's seafood was fresh. The shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The clams and mussels were not rubbery at all and the saffron chorizo chicken broth was absolutely coming through with the bright pop of peas. My hubs and I loved it!! The antipasto platter was such a great way to start the meal. The salami had a great fat to meat ratio. The buffalo mozzarella had a creamy Brie like finish and the prosciutto had a great salt content that create a great mouth feel. (Sometimes prosciutto can be slimy!) The service was great! Will was kind and since they felt so terrible that the first filet was over, we got so much extra stuff including the salted caramel ice cream and some bruschetta which btw is seriously the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had!!The Bellini was good. Solid and shiner is from the bottle so again something familiar.

The resto itself is not really have the view of the river walk directly unless you eat outside but majority of the resto is in the room, well this is kind of a fine dining resto and quite a romantic one..

I had made a reservation online for a Saturday night at 7:30. When we arrive, there was a long line leading up the staircase with no explanation of what to do. So we walked to the top of the staircase thinking there would be a hostess stand to check in up top. When we got to the top, we were told to go back downstairs and get in line. I mentioned having reservations which was disregarded without even asking my name, party size or reservation time. We then waited in line for about 15 minutes while they seated all the people in the line who did not have reservations. I watched this scenario repeated over and over with people who arrived after us who also DID have reservations and I tried to explain to them they didn't care. So what is the point of a reservation here if you are just seating first come first serve? Once we were seated, our service was fine and the food outstanding so I got over the bad entry, but just be warned that your reservation does not mean much here."], ["Rashi J.", "Phenomenal service and delicious food!

Brilliant cooking in a tourist area.Straight to the food:Texas Quail: intensely flavored wild mushrooms in the stuffing; marsala sauce was creamy, rich,subtle; substantial portion.

Matched with the Barahonda \"Barrica\" 2011, a Monastrell/Syrah blend from Spain, as recommended by our server. Great pairing-this dark-red, nearly opaque wine was low in acidity with well-resolved tannins, but big in smoky/berry flavors to stand up to the rich quail dish,Paella: fresh lightly cooked peas, fresh and tender (i.e., not overcooked) shrimp, soft rice without the traditional \"soccarat\" at the bottom of the pan; strong saffron flavors (some skimp on this); perhaps the rice could have cooked a bit more, as grains were a bit firm in the center; Very tasty- perhaps 3 1/2 to 4 stars for the traditionalist.Polenta: Wow! Best ever. Well, I've never had it in Italy, but for me this was over the top. Not at all grainy, complexity from the broth used in preparation. Another 5!Olive oil/roasted garlic: yes, this is worth talking about. We ate all the roasted garlic in the oil, and there were plenty of big cloves floating around in there. I mean, we ate them by themselves, not just on the bread (which, by the way, was also superb).Staff: Steven took our reservation, greeted us at the door, checked on us throughout the meal, told us details about the dishes.

The food was amazing (maybe since it was my first meal of the day at 5 had something to do with it) but it was still magical. I usually don't ever get this impressed. I started with a Bella Blush, soft red moscato and prosecco. Went very well with my seafood and salad. First course was the mussels in a herbed butter wine sauce, very good and was recommended by the waitress. Good portion. Second course was the heirloom tomato salad served on a baguette with what seemed to me freshly made mozzarella balls. Light, naturally sweet... I wanted to stop myself from eating because I had a third course coming.... I finished it. Third course was the Special Bella Pasta, clams,jumbo shrimp, mussels, artichoke hearts, asparagus, mushrooms with handmade pasta. Wonderful.

Start with the wine list - thoughtful and deliberate. The waitstaff knew the wines well. They have a $15 wine flight option which was useful in helping us choose a bottle. The food is intentional, perfectly cooked, dressed and prepared. I couldn't have hoped for better flavors! I had the quail, my husband had the Paella and we were both ecstatic. I was grateful for the gluten free menu, which wasn't an alternative to any of the main menu items, just simply a list of main menu items that were already GF - and many were!I rarely spend that much time in a restaurant - we sat there for 3 hours and it didn't feel that long at all. No one rushed us. The waiter didn't stop by every 10 minutes to pour us more wine - they let us pour our own bottle at our own pace. The atmosphere was so relaxing and pleasant.

I was pleasantly surprised upon entering- the staircase that greeted me opened up into a small, intimate dining room that was both unassuming yet sophisticated. I had not made a reservation, which it was apparent was necessary in most instances, but the host graciously asked me to wait a few moments and was able to squeeze me in. What followed was the most amazing meal. My server recommended the pork belly to start and it was a surprisingly large portion accompanied by crispy kale & chickpeas and hummus spread that was lovely. The pork belly was rich- as pork belly is- but the other favors complimented it nicely. I followed that with the panzanella salad- heirloom tomato and mozzarella atop a toasted baguette with a vinaigrette dressing. Also good, but a typical salad that can be had elsewhere. What followed topped all. A medium rare filet mignon, encrusted with bone marrow with a yummy sauce and peppers that looked spicy hit were the perfect amount of heat!

Normally that kind of cramping would bug me, but here it doesn't. The ambience is great. The service is amazing. Everyone is working hard and happy to be doing it. We ordered the red fish, which was pretty good but not my favorite. I got the quail, which was absolutely amazing. It's wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with Italian sausage and cooked just perfectly. We also got their bruschetta, which changes frequently. Ours was a salmon with a tzatziki \u00a0sauce which was different and really pleasant. We got pistachio cake and lemon tart for dessert because although we were full, we wanted to try them.

He kept me busy with yummy nibbles - roasted garlic, marcona almonds, warm olives - while I waited for my main, the duck. I hate to say anything negative because the overall experience was so wonderful, but the duck was a little cold when it came. It wasn't my favorite, but I did however order a side of the seasonal vegetable, the broccoli, and could have eaten that 10 times over! As far as ambiance goes, this place is super romantic and feels very authentic European. It feels like a hole in the wall place. Seats are close together and intimate. Low ceilings and exposed brick.

We happened to be here for restaurant week in San Antonio so there was a good 3 course prix fixe menu, which was great with great wines to order to accompany the dinner. Two of our party ordered this special menu. Three people ordered off the menu and loved every dish.

The mussels were perfect in the mustard tarragon sauce. I had to keep myself from licking the bowl. The scallops were cooked to perfection. All had a nice sear while remaining translucent enough to melt in the mouth. It truly was the the entire team which will now prompt my status as a regular.

They made a great decision to serve me the duck breast. The duck was cooked perfect and not overdone. Fresh greens under the duck. The meal came with the BEST polenta ever!! The servings were not TEXAS sized. But with the walking you are gonna do in SA, you don't want that heavy feeling.Over all outstanding and a hidden gem to escape for a romantic and quiet dinner.

Mains focus on proteins mostly except for the pasta dish obviously, hence were light and not overloaded with starches.The effect was a balanced meal where you feel satisfied but not overloaded with spectacular flavor pairings. Lots of thought and talent went into the menu. Wait staff was versed in the menu and able to make good suggestions.On the outside seating, we were inside which is really nice, but took note that outside is on one of the narrow stretches of river walk and in the not so nice end, with not so nice people loitering around smoking, my recommendation although sounds romantic give that idea a second thought."], ["Howard K.", "Arrogant & terrible service., Made us wait 10 minute and then told us that we needed a reservation after seating the couple in front of us without a reservation .

We ordered the eggplant Josephine-very bland and underwhelming, it just tasted like fried batter and canned tomato sauce. For entrees we got the paella and the lamb. The paella was decent (I've had better) while the lamb was served rare and still cool to touch! They were nice enough to take it back, but overall the food was very bland and nothing special.

The staff are some of the most helpful and friendly faces on the Riverwalk. We ordered the Bruchetta for an app. It was tasty and appropriate in size right before we hit the main course. I had the 6oz filet with fois gras. There's nothing artificial about this, it was divine from start to finish. She had the Scallops which were seered on the outside, but soft on the inside. The two work well with each bite. We finished off with a chocolate tart and dessert wine. It was a pricey visit but much enjoyed. Please make reservations for this place.

There's a reason this place has all the great reviews it does! It can be easy to just pass by but it's a hidden gem that you have to try! The place is not that big so there's not much space to stand while you wait, but it's worth the wait! It's a great spot for a date night with dim lights and cozy yet elegatn decor. Plus the owner is really friendly to greet you and later make sure you enjoyed your night.For the food: They bring you fresh bread, a homemade mini baguette with their version of garlic bread-- olive oil with rosemary and whole roasted garlic mixture to dip the bread in. Yummy~ I always love fresh baked bread.For the appetizer we ordered the brushetta. That day the brushetta was a warm brushetta of mushrooms and a feta cheese spread i believe--it was creamy and decadent in your mouth!As for the main meal, we ordered the paella (which is their signature dish) and the pasta bella. Paella was really flavorful with good portions of seafood! The pasta bella was amazing as well. I usually don't like fetticini because it can be heavy but this is not that kind of pasta. With generous portions of seafood, asparagus, and other yummy vegetables this pasta was creamy and light at the same time. It was quite addicting!!! I highly recommend both the dishes! Their menu isn't multiple pages like some restaurant, but the items that they have are executed to delicious perfection!TIP: make reservations!!! Also, after dinner, walk down the riverwalk to digest and enjoy the view!

We went there on a Tuesday night and it was very busy, yet we were seated right away and our waitress was very attentive. The menu was very different than what I was expecting for a Mediterranean place- not your typical couscous and kebab joint, but it was a nice surprise & change of pace. The biggest surprise of the night was their duck dish - hands down, the best duck I've ever had and believe me I've had my share - I sure did not expect this from a Mediterranean place! We also had their paella and that was on par with some of the better I've had. OK, so the food was delicious, but what made the best impression on me was the great atmosphere, as everyone seemed to be in good spirits and having a good time, customers and staff alike - it was not unlike a wedding reception dinner, very festive and jovial."], ["Henry J.", "I love Mediterranean food. They're healthy and tasty.Bella On the River is one of the few Mediterranean places in San Antonio in the midst of an abundance of barbecue and tex-mex restaurants. It's located on the Riverwalk. This place is very, very busy so reservations are definitely recommended or else you'll need to be ready for an hour wait even on a week night.The food is quite pricey. The typical entree is about $35. Most everything is ordered a la carte. For the value-conscious diners, Bella also has prix fixe three-course options that change once every few weeks. They include an appetizer, entree, and dessert.I had their pan-seared halibut while my dinner companion had a seasonal spicy shrimp dish. The halibut was impeccably prepared and had perhaps one of the best pan-seared jobs I've ever seen in a restaurant. One side was very crispy. The fish was not overcooked either, which is difficult to do given that halibut is a white fish. The shrimp was succulent, flavorful, and presented both flavors of the ocean and a masterful blend of paprika, tomato-based sauce, and heat. The shrimps were served on a bed of grilled eggplant slices.All in all, no complaints. Loved everything that was served."], ["Lynn O.", "Awesome little place right by the river.

I needed a glass of wine & they had 1 option for sauv blanc by the glass - joel gott from Napa valley so that made things easy & I went with that. Since I'm traveling solo I got a seat at the bar ... Always more pleasant than a table alone. They helped me instantly and made some appetizer recommendations since I said I wasn't too hungry. Their signature appetizer is the eggplant Josephine so I went with that and the panzanella salad. I was almost able to finish these both, but the Eggplant Josephine is a bit on the heavy side .. fried eggplant topped with shrimp, sauce, cheese & hollandaise sauce ... i think i could have done without so much hollandaise but it was still delicious.

The bread they bring is also delicious and the presentation with the garlic EPIC! I was craving pasta so I ordered the Pasta a la Norma YUMMMM the sausage was just the right amount of flavor.

The chicken itself was perfectly roasted. It had the ideal crisp skin that any good rotisserie chicken should have, along with its juicy and flavorful meat. Considering the quality of this chicken, this was such a steal! LOMO SALTADO ($10.99) -- \u00a0It's essentially saut\u00e9ed angus tenderloin strips w/ onions, tomatoes, and fries. I requested for no onions, which in turn meant more tomatoes. Yum! The meat was lean yet succulent and went very well with the cilantro-lime rice. There was a good balance of saltiness with a subtle acidity given from the vinegar. This dish was equally as amazing as the first.Overall, Rocoto's did not disappoint. Everything we had was satisfying and prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend visiting for a solid Peruvian/Latino meal."], ["Naomi H.", "We had the Seco De Res and the \"customer favorite\" Lomo Saltado. Both were very good but the Lomo Saltado was a lot more flavorful so I was more drawn to that. They were out of chicken which was a bummer because that's why we came (ordered at 6:45ish) but that's just okay because it's an excuse for us to come back. For dessert, we had the alfajores (shortbread cookies with caramel filling) and the sweet potato cheesecake. Again, both were delicious but the cheesecake stood out as better for my palate. The service was very good. I really enjoyed our server, Celeste. I would have given one more star if the environment and plating were a bit better. We are excited to come back!"], ["Joshua C.", "I went here on my lunch break because I'm always up for trying new types of food. I ordered a fried plantain appetizer, and lunch special portion of Aji de Gallina for the meal. The fried plantains were quite tasty and had a good texture to them. The Aji de Gallina (shredded chicken in a slightly spicy pepper & peanut sauce) was quite tasty as well. I personally would have preferred more spice, but the menu did say it was \"mild\", so I certainly can't complain in this regard. Still, it had a good flavor and I definitely took my leftovers home (which was decent amount given the large portion). So in regards to the food quality, I would definitely eat here again.What makes me reluctant to come back, however, is the service. I wouldn't say the service was bad, but it wasn't very good either. The waitress didn't come around much and when she did, she wasn't very friendly or personable. The folks who came in groups of 3 or more seemed to receive much better service, so maybe she was worried about not getting much of a tip or something. I don't know. Regardless, the poor service will definitely make me think twice about coming back.So in a nutshell: I'd score the food at a \"4\", and the service at a \"2\" (out of 5)."], ["Elvis M.", "I had the rotisserie chicken with green rice, tostones and yuca frita.

W.", "4.5 star. GREEN RICE GREEN RICE GREEN RICE!! Second time trying Peruvian food. I had it a couple of years ago at somewhere else and wasn't impressed. But my recent visit at this particular establishment certainly changed my mind on Peruvian dishes. I had this restaurant bookmarked for a long time but I rarely come to this side of town. Since we are having a staff retreat at the hilton resort for work I figured I'd get dinner take-out here because it's close by. I ordered 1/4 chicken with green rice and fried plantains and an order of the lomo Saltado. The chicken tasted pretty good with the two types of sauce it came with. It was a bit dry tho so it wasn't my favorite. I've always liked fried plantains therefore that's a given. My favorite, however, is the green rice!! It tasted so unique, fresh, and delicious! I got hooked on it instantly. Nom nom nom! Lomo Saltado is a stir fry dish of beef sirloin, onions, and potatoes. Did you know it was actually a Chinese-Peruvian dish? I didn't either! They call all Chinese influenced Peruvian dishes \"chifa\". How interesting. No wonder I thought the flavor profile seemed familiar. I'm a fan. Now I might have to make effort to drive here to get the green rice and lomo Saltado. Actually the green rice alone would already make me happy! GREEN RICE GREEN RICE GRREEN RICE. Wait, did I mention green rice?!"], ["Robert B.", "Plus a half a star. Really good place. Not very busy for such a large dining areaOrdered the half of chicken with lime cilantro rice. Tasty dish decent sized portions. Really quick service. The extra sauces were all really tasty. I preferred the green sauce. Little zip with a plantain after taste. Chicken was very moist and easy to peel from the bone. Only reason for less than 4 star. First time I went in they ran out of their chicken. Points may go up after a couple visits. I need to try more than just a chicken dish."], ["Kimberly M.", "First time at this place! I went during lunch and the prices were very reasonable!

And it's both affordable and completely delicious. I have many favorites on the menu -- the lomo saltado (with beef), the ceviche, the roast chicken -- and everyone I've brought here has really enjoyed it too. The cilantro rice is wonderful also. I always substitute that for the white rice if I can. They also have food to go, and delicious juice drinks. Really, a fantastic value and super nice staff. Best is the food, though."], ["P Luly W.", "My husband and I are huge fans of their lomo saltado. \u00a0My husband's best friend, Manuel, is Peruvian and this lomo saltado reminds us of Manny's version. \u00a0If my husband had a Yelp account, he would definitely be the reigning Duke of this place. \u00a0He works nearby on Thursdays and a whole month here and there. \u00a0 So once a week, he would be in here with his lunch crew for their fix.As for me, I only get to come out this way on the weekends because we live on the NE side of town. \u00a0Too far and too much of a headache to venture across town on a weekday. \u00a0So, I'm very jealous of my husband and his lunch crew.Our other favorite thing to get here is the rotisserie chicken, fries, and cilantro rice. \u00a0The flavorful chicken is always moist with crispy, tasty brown skin - best part! \u00a0The fries have this fantastic seasoned coating that keeps it crispy for hours. \u00a0And by adding the cilantro rice to it all, I'm overdosing on salt :( \u00a0But man, it is worth it! \u00a0Great combo. \u00a0We also liked the alfajore - although not as much as the version CIA Bakery used to make before they closed up shop (that was a sad day for my husband *sniff*). \u00a0Fried plantains are always a hit as well.My husband has had other chicken and seafood dishes. \u00a0But he didn't like them as much as the lomo saltado. \u00a0One day I'll eventually try other things on the menu. \u00a0But for right now, I'm happy to give 5 stars based on our 2 favorite dishes alone and recommend this restaurant."], ["Abe R.", "My friend and I are always looking for new places to grub so our next stop was rocoto's. Nice and clean restaurant. Seems like a family business because there was barely anyone working there. Service was slow. We were barely attended. The price is affordable and good portion sizes.

The fries are something special. The homemade sauces are extraordinary, especially the mayo. This is a great place for the family.

You know, the chicken. Anyway, it's the bombdiggity! If you love rotisserie chicken and you're in the neighborhood, Rocoto's will hook you up! I stopped in on Friday and ordered from a list of their lunch specials. The 1/4 chicken with 2 sides and a drink, was only $6.49. I got the side salad and fries, as my two sides.It's a good thing the yard bird was so good because the salad left a lot to be desired as did the insipid fries. Come on guys, I mean, no salt or seasoning of any kind... Just a squeeze bottle of catsup and another filled with runny tartar sauce?! This is basically the difference between 3 and 4 stars in my book. If I had just eaten the chicken, only reviewed the chicken, 4 stars all day and night. If you go during lunch rush, be prepared to wait for your order to be taken. There were two young customers sitting at the table near the door holding menus and looking toward the kitchen. After seating ourselves and waiting for about 8 minutes, we noticed the young couple get up and walk out. This is how my wife and I ended up with menus... It would take another 5 minutes for the waitress, a very friendly waitress to her credit, to take our order. Once the orders were in, the salads were out. Five minutes later, our food was in front of us.So much of the food in this place looks great. They have a TV monitor showing a variety of dishes and it all looked good.

The lady who sat us went over the different dishes, informing us which was spicy or not at all, ones you can request to add spice, etc. They were out of the whole chicken which affected 2 dishes; no biggie - we didn't plan on ordering them. \u00a0Considering we came in 45 min before they closed, I can't be angry they were out of something. So it was only $24 for 2 people. I got the sweet fried plantains and shredded chicken salad in the ground potato mixture. Both were really good. The plantains came with a cream-like dipping sauce, it off-set the sweetness (of the plantains). The shredded chicken salad had a small hint of spice. I liked the different textures of the mashed potatoes (it was more like a polenta but the description says mashed) and the creamy shredded chicken. Both dishes were perfect sizes for me (really 2 appetizers). My husband got a cheesy chicken spicy thing (his words! lol; I forgot the name of his dish!!!). Anyway, the lady pointed out the spiciest item and that's what he got. She even brought a red hot sauce in case he wanted more spice. \u00a0No one was in this place ... What a relief from those big chain places that have 30+ min waits on weekends. I'd absolutely go back! They have a $6 lunch special ...

I was excited to discover this restaurant here, and was sure to stop off while driving between dog-sitting across town, and going back home, to treat myself to the starchy goodness that is Lomo Saltado. I asked a woman who worked there if they could cook my french fries in separate oil from the fish due to my severe seafood allergy. The woman, who may have been the owner (I regret that I don't remember, as she was so sweet), started up a new fryer, and told me to always let her know that I needed this to be done. You guys, that's kind of a big deal. I've had managers at Mexican joints around town pretty much tell me to screw off when I've asked about their food segregation, requested something as simple as my fajitas cooked in a pan. This woman was almost happy about making me some mariscos-free french fries! Dinner without death, or scratching my skin off, tends to be a great start to an evening. Once home, I did a small dance of joy (with only my arms, a la Britney Spears), to rejoice over my meal. My first experience of Lomo Saltado had been homemade, estilo de madre, and damn good. The Rocoto's version was excellent. The seasoning was perfect, the ingredients all in proper proportion, with the exception of the missing bell peppers. I happen to enjoy vegetables, so that was unfortunate. The texture wasn't thrown off by the lack of peppers, though. My take home serving was big enough for dinner that evening, and a big lunch the next afternoon. I can recall all of this distinctly, even though I went there over two years ago. I apologize to the owners for taking so long to write this review. I'll try not to wait a whole decade before eating more Lomo Saltado, so I'll be back again when I'm on that side of town. I just don't go out very much. I remember the restaurant being very disabled-folk accessible, with fairly low counters at the front, and only tables instead of booths. I can't recall the location of the curb cut, but Rocoto's is in a newer strip mall, so it's all good."], ["Houston B.", "Absolutely awesome restaurant. \u00a0A gem. \u00a0San Antonio, you are sooooo lucky.The owners and wait staff are very cordial. \u00a0You are welcomed and seated promptly. \u00a0If you are not, chill. \u00a0It is not a chain, or a huge place. \u00a0They will be there quickly.There are a real variety of things to drink here, including some really great fruit juices. \u00a0I'm at home in Houston, just thinking of driving back for another. \u00a0Don't let your \"I don't like apple (fill in the blank) juice\" get the better of you. \u00a0Try something new. \u00a0They are all made fresh. \u00a0I can't remember what I had (ok, I can - It was cherimoya - does that help you???). \u00a0Try it.

The food here is really as good as it gets for Peruvian food."], ["Allegra R.", "Sometimes strip malls contain pure gold, or in other words, some of the best organically raised and fire roasted chicken you can get at a great price. No, it isn't just chicken. This place is a not well-known jewel in San Antonio. A friend recommended this place, and we finally went yesterday for lunch. We will go back.The menu is a little hard to understand if you are a first-timer, but the waitress was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about where the chickens come from (organically raised and all from the same farm), how the food is prepared, and what sauces are good, and other details of their Peruvian specialties. The chicken with red sauce was on special, and it tasted so homemade that I got flashes of memory of my mom's dinners at home as a child. The classic rotisserie chicken had such incredible rotisserie flavor and meat that falls off the bone. The dishes are served with rice, black beans, salad, and/or fries. There are other dishes that we want to try in the future. I talked to the waitress after we ate, and she highly recommends their ceviche. It is prepared the moment it is ordered of fresh Mahi, and she said it is amazing. Another dish she recommended was the Lomo Saltado; strips of beef tenderloin that melt in your mouth so much you don't even need to bite.Don't be fooled by the location or the interior because you may get the impression that nothing spectacular comes out of there, but oh my word, the food is incredibly spectacular! I normally do not eat meat (I do eat some seafood), but I make an exception for this place. When we go next it will be for dinner because they also serve Sangria, so we want to try that out. Best chicken I've had in San Antonio. PLEASE GO!"], ["Brian B.", "I am from Peru and I was excited to take my family to this restaurant. The atmosphere was humble and accommodating. The prices were quite a bit more than other Peruvian restaurants I've been to but we were hopeful that the pricier dishes would translate into a memorable experience.We were disappointed at the size of the pollo a la brasa (specialty rotisserie chicken) and at the frozen pre-seasoned fries that came with it. The salad and the house dressing were good.The chicha morada was ok. The service was nothing especial. Sadly, we won't be coming back again. We hope to find a good Peruvian restaurant in our next visit to San Antonio."], ["Kim H.", "Amazing seasoning. I can only order the half chicken meal- I'm hooked!

Both were from the lunch menu and came with drinks. \u00a0The chicken tamal was moist and flavorful.

Our server educated us on Peruvian food and was very kind and helpful.

The entrees faired much better though. \u00a0My husband got the fish sweat stew. \u00a0Gross name, delicious soup! \u00a0I got the fried fish and rice and the breading on the fish was awesome! \u00a0It was crispy without being greasy, such a rarity. \u00a0Entrees run in the 12 - 16 buck category which I find to be a bit pricey for what it is. \u00a0 I noticed they had lunch specials for only 6 bucks but the choices (picadillo, chile relleno) seemed a bit outta place in this restaurant."], ["Cassie H.", "Really delicious!

Came for a 6pm dinner on a Monday, only a few other parties in the restaurant. Service was quick and courteous. The waitress patiently explained the menu to us since it was our first visit here. I ordered the half chicken with green rice instead of French fries (it also came with a house salad). The food came out very quickly and was delicious! The chicken was a little salty but otherwise well seasoned. The green rice was good as well. The waitress gave us the house mayo and the garlic sauce. The garlic sauce is delicious with a nice slow burn, and the house mayo was tasty as well. No complaints- I will definitely be back!"], ["Sarah F.", "The decor isn't very nice and it's kinda small. I got the aji chicken, which is in a creamy sauce and it is delicious! The loma saltado is also very good. The beef is very tender and flavorful. The arroz con pollo is ok. The cilantro rice is different, it's ok. Their chicken special is good also. Chicken is tender and the rice an beans are good. Also tried the mango drink which was refreshing.

I got an Aji chicken dish, which was stellar. I've been to Peru, and can tell you with some authority that this is as real as it gets. Aji peppers aren't easy to find in San Antonio, but this place has got them, and is showing them off! Yum! The spices are exotic, and the tastes ares are exciting to my Western palate. The decor is authentic, with llama pictures, Andean tapestries, and all kinds of Peruvian stuff. The floor has this linoleum print that makes it look like you're in a grassy field. I was disappointed to find that they didn't serve \"Cuey,\" or guinea pig. It can be argued that Cuey is the national dish of Peru! I asked, and they laughed, and said that they thought nobody would eat it if they served it. Perhaps they're right, and San Antonio isn't ready for full-blown Peruvian cuisine. Additionally, the chips and salsa were subpar for a Latino grill. The salsa was Pace Picante, and the chips seemed to be Mission chips. Nothing bad, but they could really make the dining experience better if they featured some of those delicious Peruvian peppers in the salsa, and some homemade chips. I love the fact that the beverages were even authentic! They serve Inca Cola, which is Peru's favorite beverage, it's pretty similar to Mountain Dew. It actually is a great pairing with their cuisine, so I recommend getting a bottle with your dinner. In all, I'll certainly be back."], ["Melanie M.", "Just ate here for the first time and was very pleased with the authenticity of the food. I haven't been to Peru in almost 10 years but eating the food here reminded me very much of Peru. Was very pleased with the results.

All of it was delicious!"], ["Carl B.", "One of our favorite restaurants, it can be hard to find authentic Peruvian cuisine in San Antonio, Rocoto's knocks it out of the park everytime!

This is some amazingly good food!!I was in an unfamiliar area today and, as always, used the YELP app to find something great to eat. This is how I found this little jewel.

My waitress asked if this was my first time here. When I answered yes, she walked me through the menu and described the dishes. I chose the half chicken with fries and salad.The salad came first and had an awesome dressing that was made in house. The flavors of the dressing were good... I couldn't explain them if I tried.Then I received my chicken. It looked and smelled delicious!! I tried to be civil and eat it with my fork, but after I tasted it, all civility was out the window!! It was perfectly cooked and so very tender. The meat fell off the bone.My waitress brought me two sauces that are made there. One was hot... and I mean \u00a0HOT... and the other she called their ketchup, even though I don't think there were tomatoes in it.

His breakfast came with some excellent orange marmalade and the waiter graciously brought some local strawberry and lingonberry preserves after I asked...I was expecting Bonne Maman so it was a nice surprise! I enjoyed my migas, especially the beans that came with it, but the cured salmon I had the next day was even better! Our service was a bit off. Our waiter forgot the milk I asked for with my tea and also my orange juice. We kept noticing other guests that arrived after us getting their food before us, which wasn't a huge deal, just strange.

I had the paella which was flavorful and loaded with seafood. Others in the group had the salmon as well as the redfish. Everyone thought the food was exceptional. Our service was not as good as in the past. I recall it being more 5 star than 4 star. An considering we came on a Saturday, it was somewhat quiet.

So we didn't get our calamari until we were almost done with our entrees. The food wasn't the greatest either. I had the fish sandwich, and chewed on a bone.

We'd all had a late and heavy lunch, so we really just wanted a good bottle of wine & something light while the kids had dinner. However, someone should memo some of the waitstaff here that no matter what restaurant you have, if it's dead center of a huge tourist destination, you must accommodate children with a much higher sense of urgency than adults and at least pretend to enjoy it.Our server was just slow, despite the restaurant being almost empty. He was friendly enough, but didn't turn on the charm until he realized we were there to spend money, not just mess up a table and have apps. Which is always disappointing, and when I say he turned on the charm, I mean he smiled a few times and spoke a few sentences. It was lackluster at a minimum. The host and other servers/food runners seemed much happier to accommodate my family.The food though. The food was DEFINITELY something to write home about. It was phenomenal!!! The flavors, presentation & the speed at which it arrived were all impressive. We only had 3 apps & desserts, but I left dreaming of when I can return and enjoy a full meal!!

But third coast oysters?? I wanted to try them. And only a buck a piece? I needed to try them! Unfortunately, they were out...We settled for a dozen of the bluepoints from Connecticut and a bottle of Albarinos wine. It was a great pairing, and the oysters were very nice. Creamy and sweet, these large oysters were accompanied by a chimichurri, traditional red wine vinegar and chopped onions, and the staple cocktail sauce with mini tabasco bottles and saltine crackers. The chimichurri was excellent, and I always enjoy the vinegar and onion bit, though I wish they used shallots instead.

A menu was dropped off and about five minutes or more later, waitstaff came by to get our drink order. I tried the lam burger with sweet potato fries with the other two in my party has the crab cakes and lamb pasta. Each had their own distinct flavor, which was a surprise and delight. The lamb burger was a bit overly gamey, but since it was my first lamb burger, I cannot compare it to any other that I have eaten. It was on a soft bread and came with a side of sweet potato fries and BBQ dip. The fries definitely had a spivey kick. The burger also had chopped spring mix. The crab cakes were melt in your mouth delicious and came with a small side of chopped spring mix. The pasta was in a red wine sauce and very tasty. The lamb looked to be from the same ground meat as my lamb burger. However, there was no gamey flavor at all. Service was not as quick as expected since there were only a few tables full. However, we were outside so it is understandably slower at times to get prompt service on refills. Overall, it was to be expected so I don't expect that to deter me from returning to Zinc. For anyone wanting a meal to enliven your palate, I would suggest you stop at Zinc."], ["Aziz M.", "Calling all meat heads out there, not you buff dudes, you can leave. Yes, you meat loving veggie avoiding so much Whataburger in your small intestines that you're about to explode people. You will want to come here for the burger alone and then come back to try everything else. My first experience with this place was a quick dinner before getting lost in some downtown bars. I shared the tableside guac with my date and it was fun to watch, apparently super fresh since saw all ingredients were added in front of us and dang delicious. Still my favorite guac in all of SA.Moving onto some of the other things I've tried include the \"Crack Burger\" as so many yelpers have named it. This one lived up to the hype and was not only unique in texture (firmness of beef), but more importantly the often overlooked accompaniments made a world of a difference. The cheese has a distinct delicious modest flavor that compliments the beefy command of the meat flavor. The spicy tomato aioli is delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I ever ate here that was not worth the money were the crab cakes. The amount of crab in them was laughable and the price did not reflect this miniscule amount.Service is usually great but I have had my fair share of hiccups, such as one waiter forgetting about one of our entrees, lying about forgetting to put in that order which we know he did, then having the nerve to deliver it still AFTER we had finished everything else and we no longer wanted it. But I digress. The courtyard is beautiful especially in the fall and I'd highly recommend it for date night. The ambience is very nice and gives you the chance to get cozy with your main squeeze. The wine selection is very good as expected and presentation of all dishes is among some of my favorite places in town.In other words, this is NOT a place you come just for the grub, you'd want to drop in for the entire experience. I once had the pleasure of being served by one of the bartenders/waiters who is a burly Russian man and he was personable, made great recommendations and overall made me feel at home. He's the kind of person I'd want working in my restaurant if I ever owned one and is an asset to this place.

Great wine selection, whiskey and cigars also. Prices I thought were Very fair. Martinis were 10-14 each (again, half off during happy hour) food was priced fair as well. Best Burger EVER. No joke. I had the calamari, which was awful actually, but hubby had the Zinc Burger and wanted to go back the next day to get it again. I had a bite and about took his plate away from him.

I do wish they used a little less salt and oil because the spinach tasted like there was a lot of flavoring on it. Also, I felt like my dish only had one Portobello mushroom that was maybe 3'-4' in diameter. \u00a0The sweet potato fries tasted good initially, but became soggy towards the end of our meal.I give this place 4/5 star during happy hour because it's a good place to go to and my friends said their food was really good."], ["Jordan E.", "Found this place using Yelp and selecting the highest rated restaurant that was within walking distance from my hotel.

I ordered a Prickly Pear Margarita to drink, a Zinc salad and shared the Gulf Blue Crabcakes with my friend. The prickly pear comes frozen and while it was good, I would have like it better on the rocks (I'm not typically a fan of frozen drinks and only got it because we were told we HAD to have a prickly pear margarita).

You will not regret the trip!"], ["Emily T.", "Was in town for business and came with some locals. I really like the atmosphere and from what little I know about San Antonio, seemed to have a great location. We started with the hummus and chips and guacamole. Hummus and pita was great, and the guacamole was incredibly flavorful. From what I was told, they normally make this table side, but we were in a time crunch so they brought it out already made. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. Salad in general was fairly standard but the chicken is what really made it stand out. Was very flavorful and tender. Others in the group had some different salads and the crab cakes, which I heard great things about as well. For dessert, we got the bread pudding souffle which was very, very good. Would have enjoyed some more ice cream with it, but overall was very good."], ["Chris O.", "Zinc feels like a mid-tier drink-then-dine restaurant, and offers a few vegetarian options, like a margharita pizza, salads, and a Portobello patty melt.I ordered an entr\u00e9e size Zinc salad, which came with mixed greens, pear, goat cheese, grape tomatoes and really delicious fried onions. The orange vinaigrette was decent; I only used half of what they gave to me on the side. I was pretty happy with the salad. I found myself trying to avoid eating the onions out of fear of what fried onions could do to my health, but I ended up eating every last bite of the salad. I also ordered the portobello patty melt (which is misspelled portabello on Zinc's menu, though portobello comes up as a misspelled word in Word because Word wants me to capitalize it...), which came grilled, topped with swiss cheese, sitting on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach. It's kind of a misnomer, or I'm kind of dense: I imagined this dish served on bread, but when it wasn't, I didn't mind. The plate also came with sweet potato fries. The portobello and swiss was very tasty. The spinach was kind of bitter, and there was actually supposed to be asparagus underneath the portobello, but pieces were few and far between. Also, there were some olives on this plate that were super strong in flavor, and their juices flowed to the rest of my plate, making some bits very surprising. I definitely got to the part of the meal where I was forcing myself to eat the spinach out of fear of what not eating the spinach would do to my health. The sweet potato fries were the best sweet potato fries I've had in a long time. They were crispy, but soft inside. I didn't need ketchup, or any kind of dipping sauce. They were that good.The service was slow. I found myself toasting with my colleagues with an empty glass of water. The food also came out very slowly. I think the entire meal took two hours, which is fine, but most of us had more things to do later that night and were somewhat waiting on the staff. They actually offer \"Boudro's\" table side guac. Boudro is a nearby \"Texan\" restaurant that apparently pioneered making guacamole on demand, with a hint of citrus. Our table ordered a big bowl to share.I'd return if I were in the area and wanted something reliable, like those sweet potato fries, to munch on. I'd probably go to Boudro's for the guac. I didn't try the drinks here, which is a shame because the drinks appear to be an important part of the restaurant's offerings."], ["Rocktopolis ..", "The best restaurant I found during a week stay in San Antonio. Went twice. The first night we sat inside at a 2-top. Nice atmosphere, and servers were very attentive. \u00a0I got the tableside guacamole, which was heavy on the onions and salt, light on the avocado (only 1 used), but was tasty. Got the Zinc Burger, which was good. It has a Parmesan crisp on it. Fries were ok. Frozen margaritas aren't my thing, but that's the way the prickly pear cactus margarita came, and others recommended it, so I gave it a try. It was fine, but I was a little underwhelmed after the hype. Wine list is substantial. Tried the Malbec the waiter recommended, which was nice. Second night we asked to sit on the patio, and had a short wait at an inside table, no drinks offered while waiting. Once seated outside, which is the place to be, it sprinkled a little, which sent another table running inside for cover. They were seated in a back room, where the man repeatedly hit the too-low chandelier over the table with his head whenever he got up. Service was much slower this night. Dirty martinis were very good. Got the escargot appetizer, which was solid. Waiter recommended the short-rib ciabatta sandwich with warm potato salad over the lamb pappardelle, and she was spot-on.

In general all the members seemed to be respectable. Now for the food. We started off burdening the table side guacamole. It was by far top 5 worthy int the dip category although I have had better elsewhere. Next was the main course in which I had a ancho chile encrusted short rib sandwich with warm potato salad while my wife had a shrimp po boy. All I can say about my main dish was that it was the second best sandwich I have ever had and by far the best warm potato salad I ever had. The sandwich had the perfect merry of sweet, savory, and bitter favors that came together to provide a disgustingly amazing flavor!!! Also the the bread held the drippings from the cloud like meat and proved to complete \u00a0the complete the sandwich as a whole. The salad was very lite for being made with potatoes , yet savory enough to remind you of the salad your mother made on forth of July when you were a kid. Up to that point the experience was amazing.Here's were the food experience went down hill. We decided to go with our favorite desert which is creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and ordered the pumpkin version that was offered. While the desert wasn't particularly bad, it was not on the same level as the rest of the meal.

I was not disappointed!Superb friendly and prompt service from all staff, and I ordered a great glass of wine for $7, as well as the Texas Chopped Salad for $12, which might as well be my favorite salad in the world. Tequila-cured salmon, pepitas, arugula, dried corn and cheese were outstanding, fresh and tasty, only topped by the mouthwatering basil-pesto dressing.The portion is a good size, but it left me a little hungry, so I ordered another salad for $3 (I asked if that was a typo, it is not!). The zinc salad had mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and fried onions and was also very good. Did I mention it's only $3??? Amazing value for this side salad.Seating is great, I was outside on the quiet patio, very chill and relaxed. The inside area looked fun as well.I will definitely be back for other dishes, desserts and other treats. Zinc truly deserved their high rating!"], ["Julie G.", "I decided to check out Zinc after all of the great reviews but I'm sad to report that my experience was just OK. The bar area is a real treat with a nice layout to chat up the bartenders and friends. I went in with some buds and the food did not impress, perhaps an off night. I ordered the Italian sausage pizza and the only thing I loved were the kalamata olives, the rest was bland and boring. The dough, sauce, and choice of cheese used lacked flare and didn't travel well, no one at home touched those leftovers. The calamari was tacky and became soggy fast, this was sent back. The truffle fries had a great flavor but pretty greasy. I liked their spicy spinach artichoke dip more than anything, try it! Finally, the Gulf Blue crabcake tasted on the frozen side, nothing special there. Service was lovely and our glasses were never empty. I'll definitely return to give the Zinc burger a shot!"], ["Naveen N.", "Food was good but took quite a long time to prepare. Staff is friendly and seating is ample. Nice location in downtown San Antonio."], ["Mandy S.", "Zinc is one of my favorite places to eat in San Antonio! The resturant is split up into two sides: one side consists of a bar area that is more casual and fine dining area that is more intimate. I've tried the Zinc Burger, Portabello Mushroom Melt, Devil's River Lamb Burger, and Shrimp and Crawfish beignets. They were all delicious! The Sangria and Prickly Pear Margaritas were also good and complemented the meals well. My absolute favorite dish was the Shrimp and Crawfish Beignets that were served during Restaurant Week. These beignets were amazing as they had great cajun flavor and were more savory than other crawfish beignets that I've had. Too bad they don't serve those on a regular basis! Otherwise I'd be eating at Zincs every week!"], ["Jen H.", "I came here with 8-10 colleagues and we filled up a long table at 7pm on a Tuesday. \u00a0We made reservations maybe an hour before and got in with no problem. \u00a0Our waiter was great with such a large table. \u00a0I split the escargot with my seat neighbor. \u00a0Very good. \u00a0Then ordered the crab cakes for dinner. \u00a0They were smaller than I expected but I was looking for a light dinner anyway. \u00a0They were excellent- aside from being small. \u00a0Lots of crab, just the right amount of breading and the sauce on the plate was a perfect blend. \u00a0We all left happy with our experience and our food."], ["Martin B.", "May be just not my night for having dinner tonight.

But I know deep down you are a solid five for what you are! First time I came here with two companions for a drink at the bar. We sat there for more than 10 mins but nobody bothered to greet us and bring us a menu. And no it wasn't packed at all. So without being acknowledged, we left unhappily and went to another martini bar downtown. We sworn that we'd all rate Zinc a one star. I'm glad I didn't and gave this place a second chance. A friend of mine and I decided to go all out for 4th of July. So we were gonna do a nice dinner then go watch the fireworks. After calling around, we decided to come to Zinc because of its proximity to Hemisphere park. Reservation was easy to make. The lady on the phone seemed nice and accommodating when I called to tell her that we were going to be late for our dinner. We came at 6:30pm and were sited at the main dining room promptly. I didn't know they had this big dining area at the back b/c I had only seen the bar before. Decors were modern and easy on the eyes, nice! I ordered a glass of Moscato as always, then started off with escargot for appetizer and lamb pappardelle for entree. I have to say the escargot was absolutely delicious! The lamb pappardelle was divine! It was slow cooked in red wine with onions, garlic, mushrooms and zucchini, hmmm! My meal was everything I was looking for at that moment if not more. I was deff happy! It seemed like my friend quite enjoyed her meal as well. The best part is? The price! The lamb is only $14! Unbelievable! My total bill was a little over $30 plus tips! Seriously? Usually an entree would cost this much at a quality restaurant. For the stellar food, ambiance and dining experience, Zinc is certainly a steal! After the meal, we went outside and sat at their courtyard. It was such a romanic little outdoor space with water fountain, trees, lush plants, etc. I totally dig it! I'd sit here all night with a glass of moscato or champion if I could. What a pleasant surprise! I heard they are sister restaurant of Boudro's which is another fine establishment on the River. But Zinc deff offers much better prices AND I heard they have happy hours for even better deals! Now I'm so intrigued. MUST. VISIT. SOON!!!"], ["Charles G.", "Rarely do I find a restaurant that justifies the inevitably parking fiasco and expense associated with dining downtown on a Saturday evening; Zinc, however, is the exception. Pitched as a bistro and wine bar with a patio seating that reminds of an old Spanish neighborhood's shared courtyard, the brilliance of Zinc's dining experience is quite simply quality ingredients masterfully blended into a successfully creative plate that doesn't bust the budget. \u00a0The atmosphere is a sleekly blended pairing of upscale and relax while undoubtedly hip; kind of like that uncle who is older than your parents but has the latest gadgets, knows all the cool places and somehow still dresses better than you. As if one were hanging out with that uncle, with the first step into the narrow but surprisingly open entryway lined with magnum wine bottles, you know this is going to be great experience. \u00a0Entr\u00e9e prices are mostly under $15 and we're not talking about the chicken breast and rice pilaf; these were main dishes. We enjoyed the beautifully crafted Texas Chopped Salad that turned out to be so much more than expected (don't have them toss your salad- the presentation is a thing of beauty). A hint of tequila lingered on the sushi-grade salmon's marvelously cured salty flesh, each bite encored with a delayed release from the succulent mix of basil pesto dressing and dill fragrance. It was an extraordinarily balanced bite touched with an exciting, yes exciting, sweet crunch added from the dried corn. The Devil's River Lamb Burger is a small but weighty round packed with more tasty sensations than its size should permit. The onion's sweetness added a slightly grilled crispness to the already perfected match of imbedded apricot and brie. The resulting blend was exceptionally flavorsome. The accompanying sweet potato fries were nearly as thin as string fries but hidden among the salty crunch, I was pleasantly surprised to feel the mouth watering spice of a chili-lime flavoring.A diverse wine lists provided a number of quality options at varying price points. To match the salad and burger we chose an Australian Chook Shiraz-Viognier; which brought together a deep earthy blend from the red grapes and a faint touch of crispness from the white; an excellent pairing if one will tolerate a moment to gloat. Zinc's chef Manny, (also of the joint restaurant, Boudro's) has excelled my appreciation for downtown dining and convinced me that some places are certainly well worth the effort."], ["Amanda A.", "They were ok.

The Lamb Burger absolutely hands down was delicious and a huge recommendation to anyone (not gamey tasting at all). Ask questions and take the advice of the server. The one that helped us definitely steered us in the right direction based on hunger level and taste desire. I take caution when servers point out the highest priced items on the menu in a way to increase their tip payout, but the server we had did not. She provided items that felt as though she new exactly what we were looking for. That in itself will drive a higher tip in my opinion."], ["Rob J.", "We visited Zinc on a Sunday night...so the head chefs were off.

Take 5 steps off of the Riverwalk, though, and you can be pleasantly surprised if you know where you're going. Zinc Bistro is one of those restaurants that proves to be a surprise. The food is outstanding, the atmosphere is very \"old world\" almost European (especially on the patio), the drinks are strong and the service is excellent. They have cigars here that you can smoke on their patio. Prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food and the location.

In doing so, she reminded me how we were able to sustain our friendship despite the distance and the years.Boiler House is located at the Pearl District, which is the trendy spot in San Antonio from what I gather. The building itself is quite trendy, preserving the original building with just a few stylish touches here and there.For a group of ten, I called to make a reservation and they were very personable on the phone. When I explained that we were coming from Dallas, the lady said that it would be alright if we ran late as long as we call them to let them know. And when the other members of our party arrived a little late, they allowed us to order while we were waiting for the others. It was really appreciated as a five-hour drive could make people very hungry and cranky.Before this visit, I checked their website for the menu and was looking forward to the la parka porko. Unfortunately, the waitress told me that they do not offer it anymore. They were also out of the green chili pulled pork, but they allowed us to order a side of popcorn grits. The popcorn grits were great on its own, so I was really disappointed to have ran out of the green chili pulled pork. The food we ordered were varying. We ordered the hangover hash, the creme brulee french toast, the bacon Benedict, the grilled fresh mozzarella pine nut salsa verde, pancakes, steak and the David Lee Roth burger. Everyone was pleased with the food. My initial disappointment about not being able to try the menu items, which I was eyeing for the past few weeks prior to this visit, dissipated with every delicious bite.The hangover hash was addictive and easily the favorite of everyone. It was spicy, flavorful, and hit all the right spots and left us wanting for some more. The french toast was decadent and felt like such an indulgence. It was perfectly made, neither too sweet nor soggy and the maple ice cream was just a great finish to every bite: it was consumed way too fast. The bacon Benedict was scrumptious and the bacon was not of the cheap, flimsy variety. The pancakes were finished by my friend's picky son. On the other hand, the David Lee Roth burger satisfied a pregnant woman, which is always a good thing. The steak was delicious also, if my friend's quiet while eating was any indication. The only disappointment was the grilled mozzarella. I am not sure what we were expecting. Although it was delicious, the cheese was difficult to eat as it solidified quite fast. The service was just alright. Our waitress was hardly around when we needed refill or when we wanted to order other items. She showed up once, said \"are you guys doing ok?\" in a singsong voice, and pirouetted out of our table without really giving us a chance to answer. Lady, that was cute, but we were not looking for cute, we were looking for good service and more coffee. Thankfully, another waiter actually competently filled our absent waitress' shoes. If not for him, the good food alone would not have been able to make our visit a great one, especially since when our waitress actually gave us her full attention, it was to imply that our dawdling was no longer welcome.Despite the none-too-pleasing service, I would like to go back to Boiler House when I am in San Antonio. The ambience and the food are something that would make a regular of me."], ["Faith S.", "Arriving at the boiler house, we were happy for a San Antonio novelty experience.

It includes a pretty extensive wine list and liquor choices. The craft beer selection is better than most, but could still use a few more imo. But there are a lot of places to go if you want a great beer selection, I think this is just a courtesy :)Our waitress was terrific and very patient with our rowdy, picky, somewhat high maintenence group! I started with a Paloma, my new favorite drink and this one was STOUT! They also have one of my fav sauvignon blancs, Snowqualme so I had a glass of that as well. It's Chart week in SA, so we decided to do the special charcuterie board for this week and it was YUMMY!!I also had the cabrito small plate, it was very tasty too.

Honestly, the bar area was barely filling up by the time we left around noon! I like the restaurant...very modern, roomy & industrial. VERY chilly, though, so bring a sweater! I notice the staff rolls around in parkas as well, ha. Good service. I LOVED what I ordered - the green chile pulled pork with popcorn grits. Very tasty...great combination of flavors & textures between the pork, grits, pickled red onions, crema, etc. Our server - thoughtful, genius girl! - brought some grilled bread along with it cause the dish is saucy & she loves incorporating the bread. She was right! Def ask for grilled bread alongside it. I thought the portions were very hearty, but I'd have liked a bit less pork and more grits/other stuff to make it more balanced. My friend ordered the Krispy Kreme burger...what a clever dish! I had a bite...it was good, but that's all I could personally eat: a bite or two. Extremely messy, more sweet than savory flavors. The burger patty was very thick & not seasoned at all. My friend commented that she didn't feel stuffed after eating it because the donut is so much lighter than a bun. The potatoes that come on the side are meh - pretty bland & need more spices/salty to balance the sweet of the burger. Our other brunch companion ordered the \"cracked out\" French toast, I'll call it...it had chocolate syrup, chocolate chips, Nutella ice cream, amongst other sweet stuff that I can't recall, sorry! The only savory part of the dish was supposed to be gouda cheese baked in between the bread...I couldn't taste it....I had a bite & that's all I could handle. It was dessert x 100! Too much for me, personally. But if sweet is your thing - order it!I want to return eventually to try the hangover hash....and of course the green chile pork!"], ["Rachel M.", "Great food, just a little on the pricey side.

If you're a hipster and into paying WAY too much for what you get, then this may be the place for you. (No offense if your a hipster)Here's kind of how our visit went after being seated. Keep in mind, our waitress had this pretentious and annoying Kim Kardashian voice.Waitress: \"What can I get ya'll to drink?\"The Mrs: \"Can I have a Bombay Saphire and Tonic, please?\"Waitress: \"We don't serve Bombay, we have a Texas Gin.\"The Mrs.: \"OK, I'll have that.\"The Waitress: \"And for you Sir?\"Me: \"I'll have a Miller Lite, please.\"The Waitress: \"We don't serve Miller Lite, we only carry Texas craft brews, like Lone Star and Lone Star Lite.\"----WTF?----- I grew up in Texas and have NEVER heard of Lone Star or Lone Star Lite being called a \"Texas Craft Brew\". Apparently when I was young and drank really cheap beer, I was really on the cutting edge since I was really drinking, hand made Texas craft beer. Who knew?!?This is probably when we should have left and saved ALOT of money, but we were with another couple and decided to stick it out. While the food was ok, the service lacked the rest of the evening. We must not have been dressed \"trendy\" enough as we watched our waitress pass us by repeatedly to wait on other tables with the more young and trendy patrons.To top of the evening, after paying $58 for a Bison Ribeye, they packed the leftovers by only wrapping it in aluminum foil. Really? sixty bucks for a steak in the most pretentious place I've been in in years and the best you can do is send me home with the rest of my steak wrapped in foil? \u00a0Never again."], ["Russ F.", "Typically priced Pearl establishment, which is whatever but it was a nice treat. Food was pretty good, but the brunch menu seemed almost over the top. I had the bacon benedict which was pretty good, could have been better if it was hot when it came out. My fiancee had the hangover hash, and it was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and added richness to the potato/onion/pepper. She opted to get the sriracha creme & roasted tomatillo salsa on the side, so I got to fully enjoy it as well w/ my side of potatoes. The salsa was red but I thought tomatillo salsa was green, but it was still very tasty. The only downside was probably the service. Maybe our waiter had a lot of tables, but he seemed to disappear after dropping the menus for 10 minutes, then 10 more minutes after our order to bring drinks, then food was another 15 minutes. How long did the check take? 10 more minutes. The place was probably at 80% capacity but I do understand that the guy probably had been running non stop since 9am slanging brunches. Pretty cool atmosphere inside, but the service combined with the inflated Pearl prices led to the 3 star."], ["Gerry D.", "Talk about underwhelming - the three stars is actually adding 1/2 - we had a margarita (basic) and a martini (mediocre) to start and while the place was not very crowded (early Monday evening), it still took 15 minutes to get the drinks. Waitstaff hanging around, kitchen apparently busy, but not producing much, and the bartenders like molasses.Appetizers: \"housemade\" chicharrones were horrible, about the same as what you get from a Valero station on the highway wrapped in plastic with a salsa that I think was just Cholula hot sauce. An avocado and bacon spread was \"eh\" basically mediocre guacamole topped with bacon crisps - thank God for the bacon!Dinner: bacon-wrapped tuna was supposed to be medium rare, but ranged from well done on the outside edge to medium in the middle. Basically tasteless, but again thank God for the bacon. Me, I got the 14 oz ribeye with uni sauce - again was supposed to be medium rare but was medium TO rare, depending on which part you ate.

The building is really cool! I have a thing for big ceilings and barn doors. The waitress was very friendly. The menu is kind of unique - you'll want to order a few items and share. There are a lot of gluten friendly items on the menu. I got the mixed Texas salads because I can't resist goat cheese. It was a good sized portion. The chicken skewers were seasoned very well, but I don't think it was white meat - and I'm kind of a breast girl when it comes to chicken. I can be a picky eater. The grilled mozzarella with pine nuts on bread was absolutely delicious - but you'll never find me complaining about cheese and bread - ever. \u00a0Overall a good special meal, but not somewhere I would go too often - mainly because my picky-ness only leaves a few items to choose from."], ["Stephanie J.", "I had a wonderful guilty experience at Boiler House. Their menu is just filled with temptation. After taking 30 minutes to decide what I wanted, because everything looked so delicious, I decided on the Krispy Kreme Burger and my friend ordered the creme brulee french toast. The burger was great. I had mine prepared medium and it came out right. However, the meat was a little thick for my preference, likely because it didn't have much flavor. The thickness of the patty kind of took away for the flavorful burger. The potatoes on the side were presented well, but didn't have much flavor. However, I was too excited and hungry to add salt or anything else. Overall, it was delicious and I recommend it.The French toast that my friend had was basically dessert for breakfast and she loved it!I will be back and I hope to try a relatively healthier option next time."], ["Carrie V.", "I did not like this place at all. Foie gras peanut butter sounds like one of the most evil things I've ever heard of - this was on the specials list. Beer and cider list was fine. If you are a vegetarian, or even someone who does not want a giant plate of meat at every meal, don't go here. My son and I each had the shrimp and bacon skewers. This should be called pork belly or something - this could not have legitimately been called bacon. So fatty. My husband had a quinoa and veggie dish and did not feel well afterward.

We were there for a bachelorette party and not a single staff member congratulated my friend on her upcoming nuptials, despite being decked out in a giant illuminated \"bachelorette\" sash- we ended up leaving and going to Iron Cactus on the River Walk where at least 10 staff members stopped by to congratulate Rachel- which made her night, so it must not be that hard!

We are (were) regulars here for weekend brunch and have had great food on many occasions. However, this past weekend pretty much ruined all of that for us.We had friends in town and wanted to show this place off to them. I made reservations for 12:30 brunch on Saturday, and specified patio seating since we would have our dog in tow. Upon arrival, we were told that the patio was seated on a first come, first serve basis, and that our reservations were pretty much worthless. Since we've had great experiences before, I decided to swallow that one and wait patiently for a table. Roughly 15 minutes pass and there are now 3 open tables on the patio, yet nobody has come outside to seat us yet. After some prodding, we finally get seated and place our order.This is where I hesitate putting The Boiler House on blast, but I have to do it. My wife orders the David Lee Roth burger, and my buddy orders the Bacon Benedict. My buddy's wife and I both order the Hangover Hash. We all eat and agree the food was pretty decent. Fast forward to a little past midnight that evening, and I am rocked out of bed by severe stomach cramps. Within an hour of waking up, I've got it coming out of both ends, and it doesn't stop for 6 hours. It turns out that my buddy's wife, who is staying the weekend with us, is in the bathroom on the opposite side of our house enduring the same roller coaster ride as mine. It was a classic case of food poisoning, and it's the ONLY common thread amongst the four of us over the entire weekend. Flash forward two days, and I'm still trying to recover. I am beyond bummed that this happened, but this will probably be the last time I go there for brunch again. I know accidents happen, but it seems like service has been steadily declining there over the past couple of months, and the wait staff just seem overwhelmed at times. My fear is that this has spilled over into the kitchen resulting in mistakes that led to our night from hell. This place had great potential, but it's going to be tough to overcome this experience for my wife and friends. Proceed with caution.UPDATE: Got a text from my friends after they returned to Dallas on Sunday. In the midst of myself and my buddy's wife falling ill with food poisoning, it slipped all of our minds that my buddy actually ate half of his wife's Hangover Hash that day. The portion was too big, so he offered to polish it off for her. Turns out he's battling food poisoning now, as well. Just took slightly longer to percolate in his system than the rest of us. Again, this was the only meal that we could all connect the dots to that weekend, so my money is on the Hangover Hash."], ["Erika M.", "Came by for dinner and was very pleasantly pleased.

When we asked the waitress for vegetarian options she responded with, \"there is basically nothing.\" Her assistance ended there. My bf settled for a grilled cheese from the kids menu (which he said wasn't very good). One person specifically asked for no cheese on her food and she received cheese all over her potatoes. There were several other issues that occurred as well, but overall, the service just sucked. Some people enjoyed their food. For instance, the ricotta lemon pancakes were a hit, although everyone wished they would have had more lemon topping on them.

The special menu offerings sounded delicious and so many of our friends love it, so we decided to give it a second chance. They gave a choice of upstairs or downstairs for seating, and we chose downstairs since our service last time was awful upstairs. Service was great this time! I wish I could remember our waitress' name at this point because she was fantastic. This time, it was the food. Well, mostly my food. The special menu consisted of an appetizer course, wedge salad, main course. The starters were OK. I had the figs/prosciutto, DH had the hog jowl mole. DH had the better appetizer by far. We both agreed it was the best mole sauce we'd ever had. For the main course, I opted for the prime rib with popcorn grits, bearnaise and shredded horseradish. DH selected the braised pork shank with goat cheese and country ham risotto. Again, he won. My dish was an absolute mess!! (I'll include the photo I took) Somewhere on bottom were grits. You couldn't see them as they were covered by the prime rib, but you couldn't see the prime rib because it was SLATHERED in sauce... Bearnaise I assume, but it was almost gravy-thick and wasn't very appealing to the eye or tastebuds. There were also blobs of horseradish here and there. I love bearnaise with beef, and horseradish is ok, but I've always had it served on the side as something to compliment the dip. Never in my life have I had or seen it served like this. I don't know who would have plated it this way and who would have allowed it to leave the kitchen like that?!? \u00a0It actually made me wonder if there was something they were trying to cover up or hide? \u00a0I had a few bites but it wasn't good, \u00a0and the cover-up thing made me skeptical, so I left it. \u00a0DH's pork shank? Beautifully presented and tasted amazing. It was like the two dishes came from different restaurants! Oddly, as we were leaving, I saw someone eating the same meal with the sauces on the side in small condiment pots. Why me? We decided to go for the olive oil lemon cake for dessert since I was still hungry and also curious to see if the olive oil was detectable. Plus, we're adventurous and like trying unique and eclectic things. \u00a0The cake was delicious but it was tiny for the price. Literally just 2 tiny bites each.So there it is.

Overall great experience!"], ["Kevin K.", "Place looks amazing, great atmosphere, and the wildest thing...it appears as though all the employees are on their game and HAPPY!Great menu, wine list is good and beer and spirits abound. \u00a0Place is definitely worth a visit."], ["Cathy S.", "I love dressing up and going out for dinner, so during my birthday weekend I invited some of my friends to go out for a \"let's dress up cause I like getting fancy and it's my birthday\" type of occasion. Decided on this place because of the location and the food selection. For a $$$ type of establishment, the dress, while formal, was not as intense as I expected. Still a romantic atmosphere though! We got seated towards the back and our waitress was so accommodating! I ordered the oysters and the meatballs and believe me, it was enough to satisfy my hunger. Yes, the plates are very small for the amount you're paying, but the quality of food, I think, compensates for the price."], ["Tracy C.", "The service was slow and food not that incredible. Found it too expensive for what we actually ordered."], ["Susan B.", "I've come to Boiler House on many occasions but today's experience made me write this review. I've always had OK service here...it usually takes a while for the food and the service was never attentive. BUT today it was the worst ever!! My co-worker and I went for lunch for Restaurant Week. We placed our orders and waited about 10 minutes for our salads, no big deal. Then we waited roughly 45-50 minutes for our entrees...this is a big deal during lunch time. It took so long our server came by and asked us how our food was and if we were ready for our checks....it took so long he even forgot that we never go our food! That's ridiculous!! The manager came by apologized for the wait and then our food came out and it was cold. We never saw the manager again. After this experience I don't think I'll ever go back. Besides being cold the food wasn't that great...basically paid $15 for a decent salad and cake and wasted about 1hr 30mins of my life."], ["Rhea B.", "I was there recently and tastes quite a few items. My favorite was the Puppet Master cocktail and the hog jowls on Indian fry bread! \u00a0Great experience. Thanks."], ["Perla B.", "We went here to celebrate my brother's birthday. We were a group of 8 adults and 2 kids. The place is nice, but nothing too fancy. We had the bread with avocado which was just ok. It was like a different version of a Guacamole. There was also another spread we ordered but can't remember the name, it was also ok. Mind you these \"spreads\" are $9 each, seems a bit too much for just bread and some spread. I had for dinner the Beef Tenderloin Skewer, the size was like an appetizer, the marmalade was good, but other than that nothing to wow me. My mom ordered the $40 Fish. Honestly, I think that price is Outrageously Expensive, not even in New York have I had fish that expensive, and this is San Antonio.... I tried her fish and it was ok, nothing to make the 40 bucks worth it. Everyone else ordered the lamb hamburger, and they all said it wasn't that good. Most ended up leaving more than half of the hamburger. I didn't order anything for the kids, they had dinner beforehand. For drinks I had a glass of white wine, the house one, it was fine, the others ordered some beer, and some more wine. Everything was fine with drinks. For dessert we had some type of Smores dessert and it was good. The bill though was around $430 which is a lot of money for mediocre hamburgers, an overly expensive fish and appetizers. We had a nice time, but the food was definitely not great, and not for those prices. If you are going for drinks I assume is ok, and maybe if you are not hungry you can have some appetizers, but to have dinner, it is way over priced for the food you get."], ["Sonia T.", "Brunch at Boiler House is spectacular! I love that the restaurant owners kept most of the building from the stages of the Pearl Brewery time all in tact and minimally made changes to allow for this fabulous restaurant. A + in my book! Our server was helpful and took wonderful care of us on a late Fall Sunday morning. Fresh orange juice is hard to find but they have it here and I highly recommend it to compliment your brunch plates - add some bubbly if you feel like a kick too! I ordered the Green Chili Pulled Pork with Poached eggs atop Popcorn Grits and would have it for brunch every weekend if I still lived in San Antonio!!! My fianc\u00e9 ordered the Hangover Hash which was super tasty but had way too many potatoes. Look forward to coming back for a fun cocktail hour with friends!"], ["Jennafer C.", "Okay, so. Where do I begin... The service is AWFUL. I mean, really awful. We came in a group of 12 for a birthday, and it took an hour for our waitress (her name was Tyler) to take our drink order and get them out here. Not only was she extremely slow, but she was very rude when handing us our drinks. Another waitress had to take our food order because our waitress was so sloppy and all over the place. The other waitress was extremely polite, helpful, and quick and she will definitely be getting my tip. If you are going to eat here, I recommend planning on being here for a while. I should also note that no one has bused our table so the flies are flocking to us."], ["Jill C.", "We weren't overwhelmed, especially for the price. The menu seems to have such potential, sadly the dishes we tried were bland and yet ironically such a complicated mix of flavors that nothing stood out. Spaetzle risotto - love the concept, but beyond the obvious dijon mustard I couldn't pick out the mint. Also, it lacked the cheesy creaminess of a traditional risotto.Dove poppers - the bacon was so thick that it was all you could taste.Pan Seared Salmon with tomato consum\u00e9 and spring veg - the salmon was good, but the veggies and broth were boring and lacked flavor.NY Strip - came out charred on the outside, medium rare to rare on the inside (ordered medium) and far too chewy for an Allen Bros cut.Whipped potatoes with bacon and gyuere - the best part of the meal, although it was one hell of a volcano in your mouth. Heed this warning... Service was excellent, and we may try it again, but for just those five dishes and two beer we felt that $140 (before tip) was a bit much. When you've had more tender steaks at Outback, well... yeah."], ["Vivian Q.", "Just so disappointed don't know where to begin.....for starts not easy to find, 12 noon and we were the 2nd customer (what does \u00a0that tell you) then server had no suggestions. When asked the most popular item her response there were 20 items, 20 be serious just say you have no idea. Lastly the food OMG never to return. Come on the sauce was swimming, overbearing and SALTY. Whoever else wants to eat there be my guest!!"], ["Sandra M.", "Great food!I come here a lot for hh, I usually have the cheese plate and several glasses of wine. The food has always been good but there are a few stand out dishes. \u00a0Cheese plate: \u00a0You can't go wrong with their cheese plate $15. They offer several variety of cheeses along with fresh honeycomb and a fruit compote (fig?). Tasty and great for 2 people to share as an appetizer. One of their most popular dishes is their bubbling swiss bread with roasted garlic and sweet onion. It's pretty good but could use some truffle salt (or regular salt for that matter). Another great dish to share with 2 people as an appetizer. Their brunch is probably one of the best tasting ones in town. I have had their Hangover Hash (braised \u00a0pig, chichirones, potato-peppers-onion hash, two fried eggs, charred tomatillo salsa and sriracha cr\u00e8me) this was very tasty but too spicy for me. My friend got the Eggs Benedict and she absolutely loved it (see picture),My favorite brunch item is the BLT Mac & Egg (macaroni shells, bacon lardons, vine tomatoes, local spinach and white truffle mozzarella fondue, topped with soft poached farm eggs and hollandaise). This was insanely delicious, the truffle mac n cheese with ooey gooeyness of the eggs and hollandaise sauce was ridiculous. I haven't had a dish this tasty in long time - so many delicious flavors and it was surprisingly filling for what looked like a small portion. This is way better than the Hangover Hash!"], ["Christine H.", "My review stems from someone with dairy and gluten allergies, so if you don't have those problems then this review might not be for you!I went for brunch today:-Great outside tables for groups-Nice that gluten free menu items are notated on the menu, much appreciated!-Brussel sprouts were amazing and reasonably priced for the quantity. It comes with cheese even though the menu doesn't say it comes w cheese. Fortunately my waiter warned me!-The Hangover Hash looked amazing, good quantity of food for the price, but they \"couldn't remove\" the creme, so I presume it is pre-made. Not impressed with that.-Coffee was just ok. I would've preferred coffee from Local or one of the farmers markets vendors-Other than that, the experience was good. I'd go back."], ["John Y.", "I noticed that almost every dish has beacon in it. The quail skewer was wrapped in beacon, the quail pizza also had beacon and some other things I could not make out without the menu.I've had better from the other restaurants in the Pearl Brewery area. They have high bar stools at the tables, which are not the most comfortable. \u00a0You can ask for a table with the normal chairs, which I think would be more comfortable. Our waitress was nice, but the food was just ok nothing special."], ["ISAAC J.", "I'm a big fan of trying different burgers. This place has a couple that I would recommend. Anytime you can throw an egg on a burger you know it is going to be good. \u00a0I have been putting eggs on sandwiches including burgers for years even before they were even popular. There is \u00a0nothing like an over easy egg oozing all of that yolk goodness all over a burgers. Simply put it was delicious. I never tried \u00a0peanut butter on a burger so I was excited and curious about how this would taste. My first bite was very delicious. The texture and flavors were what I was looking for. \u00a0I was impressed by this burger and would order it again. \u00a0The decor was very cool and comfortable. I would recommend this place \u00a0to everyone."], ["Rick F.", "Not sure why this place has 3.5 stars, because that is definitely deceiving. \u00a0All of our food was great! \u00a0The kobe beef burger with foie gras was AH-MAZING. \u00a0We also had a couple of appetizers, one of which was the tuna ceviche; it was great but not especially memorable. \u00a0What was memorable was the dessert. \u00a0I can't remember what it was called, but it tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup on steroids. \u00a0Probably one of the top 3 desserts I've had in my life! \u00a0That's saying a lot considering the size of my sweet tooth. \u00a0The only foul was the service was very fast. \u00a0We had our food before we finished appetizers and the wine wasn't even poured yet. \u00a0However, the very nice server didn't charge us for the dessert as compensation. \u00a0Not a big deal in my book. \u00a0Highly recommend a meal here!"], ["Aman S.", "I was very unimpressed with this place. \u00a0The food was all pretty greasy. \u00a0The meatballs were cold. \u00a0The guac dip was overly smoky and overly salty. \u00a0I probably will not return here."], ["Reilly E.", "Had brunch with the hubby today. $5 mimosas were delish.

The lamb skewer & the bison meatballs were soooo good but the bread pudding has made a dessert addict of me.Its as perfect as can be! I literally have to call it in every Saturday after a long day to ease my mind after a long day!"], ["Abby M.", "The Boiler House is my new favorite location. It checks all of the boxes for ambiance, location, service and presentation. However it goes ABOVE AND BEYOND in food quality and gluten free options. It calls the gluten free menu items 'gluten friendly' which is slightly confusing and should probably be changed as it sounds as if the food is full of gluten which is awkward and funny. I personally recommend the roasted, spicy cardamom cashews and the jumbo shrimp skewer. I had dreams about that skewer and had to go back for lunch again the next day. The meat quality is superb, the herbs are impeccably fresh and the Serrano, avocado sauce was loaded with flavor. It was also a ton of food and easy to share. As a person who observes a paleo lifestyle, this restaurant is now permanently in my repertoire. I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to satisfy a paleo palate with delectable meats and savory spices."], ["Catherine Z.", "Delicious food. Quail poppers, buffalo meatballs, shrimp skewers, all so good! The room is ok, it's kind of sterile, but the food is so good who cares."], ["Stephanie W.", "We stopped because we craved beer and liquor. Immediately, I was turned off because she asked if we had reservations, which we didn't. She said all her tables were full and they had a large party coming in. We were fine sitting at the bar, which she offered. Conclusion, we stayed over an hour, all the tables weren't full and they weren't full with a party. Maybe we left before their arrival, but we certainly felt brushed off. Decent selections of beer, I had two and might have had another, but the bartenders were pushy. I've worked in hospitality as the service and management,15 years; it's good to be knowledgable, but quite another to hover. She asked the right questions, but I felt rushed and she was always around. Not to mention, I watched another bartender butcher a wine cork. It was aggravating to watch and witness; I wanted to jump in. Is this something which is taught properly or assumed? Wanted a glass even though this is a brewery, but no options for glasses, everything is bottle. Yes, offered by the glass, but no true options. Might try again, but not soon."], ["Yvonne B.", "Fabulous menu! Choices! Unique ingredients and combinations! Oysters, filet, salads, sides!!!

Eclectic food served up in grand fashion with a twist of Texas old school brewery ambiance. One of the best things I've enjoyed here has been the Hanover Hash! Braised pork belly, chicharrones, potato-pepper-onion hash, two fried eggs, charred tomatillo salsa and sriracha creme! Wow. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth. The only thing I can say that's negative about this place is that they seem a little disorganized when it comes to staff and they don't seem to greet customers immediately especially at the bar. But I've had great service here regardless of this shortcoming. Come try it out and I would also recommend the Oysters Rockafeller! **pictured**"], ["Daniel W.", "Everything that I had tonight was delicious. I came with my gf for her bday dinner and service was very prompt. A huge, huge list of adult beverages; ranging from wines, to spirits, to brews, to craft brew. Everything moderately and reasonably priced, imo. The setting and ambiance is spectacular, very open and well lit. Could either be romantic or a nice meet up spot for friends. Anyway, back to the food, we both had the restaurant week specials with a carafe of a white wine. The courses we had were the pork paite and crustinis. Beautifully presented, \u00a0the pork was nicely salted as was the bread, which was a bit to crunchy for the gfs liking, props to the service for rectifying it immediately. Everything was splendid with this dish. Next courses were a caprese salad and.a pork sausage and chicaronnes. The pork this time.was heavily spiced and peppered, some might find overpowering but I enjoyed as did she. She.had.the caprese salad which was small but refreshing, the seasoning could have been upped but it was still good. Next came the entrees, she had the pork chop, with a creamy cous cous, pomadora sauce, and a pickled corn relish. Everything played with the dish, presentation wasnt as clean as it could be, but the flavors were on point. Only negatives towards.the dish were the pork was a little over done, and a little bit cool, maybe luke warm. But it didn't affect or detract from the dish. I had the salmon, creamy grits, shiitake mushroom, some sort of reduction, and a sprig of arugula. Some of the components of this dish were cool as well, meaning not hot, but they were easy to dismiss because the grits were soo damn good! I want these great grits featured as a whole tasting, I'm being serious, they're that good. Those grits could be first, second, third course, dessert good. They saved the dish for me. The salmon was a very good well done, meaning it was well done but still moist and flavorful. My fault for not stating the temperature. Last, but not least was a very heavenly almond tart I believe, complete with frozen almonds and some almonds like frosting, all in all it worked well. I give boiler house a solid b+, there's some improvement areas, such as maybe portion to pricing, but thats just me having wishful thinking, as price would be the only thing from holding me back from eating here as a regular"], ["Mary V.", "This was a restaurant that was just OK but cost as much as a really high-end restaurant.
