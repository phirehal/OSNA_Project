{"Mon Thai Bistro and Sushi Bar": [["Dale M.", "I very much like Mon Thai. I have lunch here most Saturdays. I think the appetizers, which aren't just Thai, are quite good. I especially like the simple \"Thai butterflies\", a riff on crab Rangoon (though if they have any crab, I don't taste it, which makes me happy), crispy and creamy from the cream cheese melted in them. But truly all the appetizers are tasty.Oh, I guess it would be only fair to note that you get a complimentary cup of soup when you come in. If you're really hungry, it's quite welcome. But even if you aren't, it's a nice touch. I often get the Chinese or Chinese-inspired entrees. Each is good, though none are quite what I've had in any other restaurant. But I quite enjoy that. Some of the Thai dishes are delicious. All are served in generous portions. I'm not a fan of the pad Thai, but on the other hand, I truly love the pineapple fried rice. I miss some of the kinds of dishes that are served at Thai restaurants that serve mostly Thai customers, but in fact, most of the customers are from San Antonio, so that wouldn't really make sense.The sushi looks great and people seem very happy when they're eating it (I just don't like seafood, which leaves out most sushi.)"], ["Maria W.", "Great hidden gem. If it was cooler we definitely would of sat outside in the beautiful patio. We had the pad Thai & sushi. Both were delicious! Service was great too!"], ["Liz S.", "Good Thai food, and good sushi? \u00a0Yes.While on the hunt for good sushi my partners and I found this place. \u00a0It was absolute love. \u00a0I'm a vegetarian, and sometimes it's difficult to find a good vegetarian roll. \u00a0Odd, I know, but it's a constant problem for me.Anyway, the sushi is great, and so is the Thai food. \u00a0I appreciate any place that is flexible with the meat options. \u00a0There's so much for me to try. \u00a0I'm still experimenting with the menu, but I really enjoyed the sesame noodles and the lo mein. \u00a0Also, their crispy spring rolls are divine. \u00a0They've got a crunch, and are always hot. \u00a0Whatever dipping sauce they come with is glorious. \u00a0I can inhale these things."], ["Trey E.", "So many Asian places have their core competencies and then go \"hey ... sushi's a great way to make some extra money,\" so they tack on a sushi bar but really half-ass the attempt. \u00a0Mon has done a great job of excelling on the Thai side, and she leaves the sushi bar up to consummate professionals. \u00a0You want to start with a cup of Thai noodle soup, then have some woonsen and a couple pieces of tuna nigiri? \u00a0No problem. \u00a0Edamame to pick at while waiting for your pla mauk prik ... great idea. \u00a0Sake to accompany the tom kha, obviously. \u00a0Mon Thai's setting is unique, set way off busy Broadway, you'd hardly even know you were right in the heart of town. \u00a0The staff is always friendly, but quick, and the prices are spot on for the quantity and quality."], ["Michael M.", "I don't know what to say. This place makes some mean food! An easy 5 stars. I'll be back soon"], ["Ariel M.", "Mon's never fails to exceed my expectations! Recently I went here with my family for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious. We all shared family style: I got my usual pad Thai (spice level 3), my mom got pad wen sen (level 3 spicy), and both of my sisters got the same dishes as us but with no spice, and my little brother got their fried rice that came with fried butterflies. As a starter we got a few sushi rolls; we got the Dragon roll which had crab, avocado and cucumber topped with avocado and eel sauce (I loveeee eel sauce), and we also got the San Antonio roll which had crab, cucumber & avocado, topped withtempura Flakes, white tuna, shrimp and avocado, served with spicy mayo sauce. The waiter was phenomenal, he was very attentive and made sure to everything was to our satisfaction. What made me like him even more was when he noticed my brother (who is very picky like any child) picking at his pad Thai and offered to switch it out for some fried rice (which he and i both loved). When we were finished eating the waiter kindly brought out complimentary coconut ice cream with a birthday candle. The ice cream was very refreshing, it had a very rich creamy flavor. It was also probably so yummy because they make it fresh there."], ["Matthew L.", "TUNA BOMB! TUNA BOMB! TUNA BOMB! If you check in on your yelp app you get $5 off your bill if you spend $40. They have a sushi happy hour from 3-5pm. The service is always great and the food is amazing every time.The TUNA BOMB is literally the best thing I've ever eaten in my life! MY ENTIRE LIFE! It taste like an Angel and a Demon are having a dance battle on your tongue. It's bursting with fresh delightful flavors and at the same time spicy as hell. The fried Ice Cream is a great treat as well.I can't think of a better place for a date if you're both sushi lovers. It's a very intimate setting. Seriously, everyone go order the TUNA BOMB! It will change your life!"], ["Dennis Q.", "Just came home with a take out order from Mon's Thai Bistro.We ordered salmon sushi, Vietnamese Rolls and General Tso Chicken.The sushi and Vietnamese rolls were OK, but the General Tso Chicken (the main dish) was inedible.The chicken was chewy and tasteless. After the third bite my wife and I couldn't eat any more and had to throw it in the garbage. Very disappointed. Start with inferior product (chicken) it can't be disguised with sauce and rice. Just sayin."], ["Andrea Collette P.", "Great little hidden gem of an atmosphere with tranquil outdoor seating and a nice interior. \u00a0Sadly, the quality of our dishes was not up to par with our surroundings. \u00a0My drunken noodle looked dry (and it was) and the spice level was inbelievably overwhelming. \u00a0My counterpart's sesame chicken was crispy and tasted fair although he complained of too much garlic. \u00a0We're willing to come back despite this however and try their sushi, which looked appetizing from afar and was reasonably priced for lunch."], ["Laura T.", "This place is always good. It has become our only choice for Thai food and sushi. Great ambiance."], ["Julia S.", "The Mon special roll was really good and super filling. The soft shell crab roll (spider roll) was a little bland in my opinion, but that might be because the Mon roll has SO MUCH flavor and sauce. Panang curry was good, spicy but good. And pad Thai was good! Service was attentive and very friendly.Only complaint is the tapioca balls in the boba was undercooked. Very hard."], ["Clara N.", "The food is great. All the employees have a great attitude. The atmosphere is nice and peaceful. I would most definitely be coming here more often!!!"], ["Beth K.", "Enjoyed the rice soup - good ginger flavor; would prefer less rice and more broth. Soup was hot and stayed hot!

I could see the tension and stress on her face as she carried loads of dishes in and out to the folks eating outside.And, with this kind of mis-management, mistakes will happen...In our case, she didn't put our order in for a long time.It cracks me up how a business, so successful, is willing to take advantage of their employees...This young person was working herself to death...and was solo.With that being said, there is too much competition in town with Thai restaurants for me to mess with this place.Once again, the food was good, what we received, and they got 3 stars for the food only.Thanks, Joe Gray"], ["Linda G.", "I visit here several times a week, as my firm is located just upstairs. \u00a0The quality and freshness of the food has always been excellent. \u00a0The staff is super friendly, and know me by name, which always makes you feel welcome. \u00a0I love their Pad Gra Paw, Thai Butterflies, Tuna Bomb, Spicy Dragon Roll and Bubble Tea. \u00a0The Chinese specialties are mediocre, but c'mon....it's a Thai restaurant. \u00a0I would definitely recommend."], ["Jade M.", "YUM!!! I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this restaurant yet. I've been coming to Mon Thai for the past eight years and it's always delicious and the servers are always on point. My favorites are the Panang Curry, Thai Fried Rice, Pad See Ew and the Thai Butterflies appetizer. I've also had the sticky rice with mango and fried banana dessert - both are bomb. Just order them. I wish that I lived closer to this restaurant so that I could eat here more often. They have a great patio overlooking Broadway and the menu has Thai, Chinese and Sushi - a little something for everyone. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant and they even have a back room that you can reserve for parties (I once attended a birthday dinner here with 20 people and it was awesome!). Tonight I grabbed a quick dinner with my boyfriend. He ordered combo Pad Thai and I had the pork dumplings and miso soup. Everything was very flavorful and our server was great.

Thank you Yelp for the check-in, $5 off when you spend $40 wasn't hard to make this happen :) yummy food but a little on the costly side. Started with fried tofu, and it was awwwwesome!

Almost didn't have room for the fried ice cream but was able to make it happen. This girl loves food :) The atmosphere was great, very relaxing, enjoyed the art decor, especially the 3D wall hanging of the man groping the woman's \u00a0boob. However, if I had small kids with me THAT might get some conversation going better suited at another time :-) All in all enjoyed myself and will probably come back again!"], ["j h.", "Both their Thai food and sushi are awesome. \u00a0I can never decide which one I want. \u00a0The pad Thai is out of this world and the spring rolls are always fresh and crispy. \u00a0Love, love this place."], ["Derek S.", "Mon Thai is the one sushi joint in San Antonio I have returned to many times. What originally started as a pre marathon tradition has now become a normal for my sushi needs.Two words, \"Tuna Bomb\"! Fresh and wonderful after any of their soups as an appetizer.

The staff is friendly and service although can be a little quick if slow, never unsatisfactory."], ["Zach Y.", "Here in San Antonio from California and wanted to find some good sushi. This place definitely delivered, awesome sushi and really friendly staff. I highly reccomend the \"Tuna Bomb\" roll & the Thai tea."], ["Angie J.", "Not impressed.

Fried Rice is too sweet, sushi rolls all tasted the same in part due to them putting way too much eel sauce in everything.

I had the fried rice with shrimp and loved how it was both sweet and salty. After seeing their \"WE HAVE BUBBLE TEA\" sign, I just had to try it. It's almost like a smoothie but with dark tapioca balls and I liked my taro flavored one.

I love their Texan roll. Sesame noodles are great . Seaweed salad with squid is excellent as are their summer rolls. I love the atmosphere this is the best Thai restaurant in my book. Clean, restaurant staff always polite. Their bathroomIs ALWAYS clean. Sitting outside is great. I've tried almost all the dishes except for their Ghan Curry ( spelled) ?

They have an array of Asian dishes so I decided to go Chinese instead and try their sesame chicken (I figured this dish is fairly safe wherever you go!). I was not overly impressed actually.

I'm Thai and grew up in my grandmothers restaurant, so I'm not too easy to impress.Our waitress, Fatima, greeted us in between tables, since it was a lunch rush, and started off ok. We had their chicken satay and papaya salad to start off with ( satay was ok, like every other place; papaya was good, better than most ) while we waited for our food. I had a noodle stirfry while my gf and friend both had curries.Fatima brought us these pre-soup cups that mostly looked like the dollar ramens heated up quick and then dumped into cups.

Fatima instantly became rude and told us that since she \"heard\" red curry and \"wrote\" down red curry, we must have ordered the dish. We were shocked and didn't know how to really respond, she didn't offer to take it back and bring out the right dish until my gf started giving her attitude right back. My friend just told her it was cool and we let it go.

Absolutely I'll get it for you!\" in a sarcastic manner. I got dessert for my girlfriend to make her feel better but the complete rude service that our waitress gave pretty much is stopping us from going back. Mon Thai gets two stars for food attempt and nothing else, because a girl wearing black VS legging/yoga pants with 'pink' spelled across her ass, pretty much ruined the rest of our experience.PS. The same waitress proceeded to ignore us and spent 15min talking with a guest outside, leaving her tea pitcher on his table and leaning on the outside table.

The sauce was a little watery for the spring rolls, but still had an okay flavor. My date hated his meal, and he has never ever complained or not eaten anything he's ordered in a restaurant before.

They can make it varying degrees of spicy. The lunch portions are always small with the noodle dishes; don't expect to get a ton of food.I ordered a California Roll to finish off my meal and it was REALLY good. Fresh, crisp veggies, moist sticky rice and a good amount of wasabi and ginger.My server was a really nice friendly Hispanic girl. She has been the only friendly server I've ever seen there. Most of the time the servers are scowling and unfriendly.My issues: they are beyond inconsistent. As you can see from the mixed reviews sometimes they are spot on, other times they fail miserably and give you a soupy mess. Also I ordered a side of peanut sauce and was charged a dollar. Really?!?! Happy hour has changed since the last time I went i.e. they no longer include appetizers; they do a dollar off select sushi rolls ranging $3.95-8.95 and a dollar off beers and Saki bombs.If you catch them on a good day awesome...good luck, because when they're good they're good but when they're not....well you see all the negative reviews!!!"], ["Julie S.", "Stopped by for lunch after the lunch hour rush. There was a few people dining in. Service was rushed, our server seem liked he needed to be some where which was obvious, and lunch was not over till 3... and it was 2 pm. Got our food in less than 15 minutes, my sister didn't care for the green curry, and my pad vun sen was pretty good, but eating in an atmosphere like that was not desirable. We ate quickly even though I had no rush to be any where and left the place by 2:30 lol"], ["Honest R.", "I am really excited that my friend suggested this Thai food restaurant. Since we ordered for take out I can not contribute to an environment or service review, but i can say that I am extremely impressed with their food. I ordered the chicken pad thai, Thai hot (Thai hot is a level 5 on a spice scale from 1-5 at this certain restaurant). There are very few Thai restaurants that understand the level of spiciness I am requesting, but this one nailed it! It was the perfect level of spice for me. The dish appeared deceiving because it did not present any signs of being spicy (no pepper flakes..nothing but whitish noodles and chicken..no red/brown hue coloring..nothing) I assume that they add some type of clear chili oil for the spice. I can only hope that this restaurant will be consistent the next time around related to their level of spiciness (another fault I have experienced with Thai restaurants). Overall, it was delicious and I will be returning."], ["Who M.", "Great food. Pretty incredible sushi menu although I stuck to the Thai food this time. Gotta say it was quite tasty:-).

He is truly knowledgeable and makes the most delicious cocktails with the finest ingredients. It is like having a drink chef at your disposal - just tell Olaf what you like and he will create a drink just for you (if its not too crowded with Trinity students).Someday I will tear myself away from Olaf and try the food up front.

I love their Tom Yum soup. Good selection of sushi. Nice atmosphere."], ["Theresa H.", "I hit up Mon Thai with a couple of friends. For apps we ordered the calamari and the dumplings. Neither one of them were exceptional. The dumplings were very ginger heavy and the calamari had a ton of tempura batter on a small ring of calamari. My entree was good-drunken noodles with beef. I ordered a level 4 spice on the 1-5 scale and didn't find it to be terribly spicy but it was flavorful with lots of basil. The drink menu is limited to beer, wine and sake. They do not serve any liquor so I was kind of bummed about that. I made a sad face. The atmosphere is nice. It's dark and there is a large piece of artwork with one carved figure grabbing the lady bits on another carved figure. So, I guess the place is sexy?The service was good but overall I consider the place pretty average."], ["Selia S.", "Good Thai in San Antonio. The curries follow through and I'm told the sushi is good though I don't eat it. Service is nice and the drinks are delicious. I'm not giving five stars because I have had a couple of non-amazing experiences so I don't think it'd be fair to ignore that. One of those experiences was with the lo mein--good, not great. The Chinese food is also good, not great, but then, it's not really what brings you in the door, is it? I suggest the Masaman curry if you're on a first visit and aren't sure what to try."], ["Kay T.", "I had the most delicious vodka martini here the other day.I also had heaping amounts of sushi, seaweed salad, and other delectable delights.

MMMMM. I just can't get enough of it!Now the food is great here. I've had both the sushi and several Thai choices. I've never ordered anything that I wouldn't recommend. That said, I've been at tables where other people have ordered fish and they come out whole, eyes and all, which I understand is the traditional method of serving these fishes, but I just never like my food to look like the animal from which it came.

Early on my initial choices were, Thai Dee, Thai Cafe, Thai Chili, and Lemon grass. All of which I have been to on many occasions. That said, I finally have decided this place beats then all. First, for me Curry dishes are the only way to judge good Thai food, just as Brisket is the only way to judge a good bbq place. Their curry dishes, which I have tried almost all are seemingly a mile ahead of competition, I can't explain why since I just love them all, but when my wife even enjoys the curry here, as someone who ordinarily doesn't that's when I know there is a hands down winner. My wife as well definitely thinks they too make the best noodles in town. As family run business I almost always have had the same young waitress to whom I believe to be the daughter, she is really awesome and patient and does a phenomenal job at walking you through the menu. When mom is not in the back cooking she is tending to the register and is always so super sweet and genuine in asking if you enjoyed your food. The last point I will make is that, up until recently which they must have had to increase their prices on menu I would have said the value here is what was the trump card in securing my decision, they seemed to have been forced to raise the prices which now make them on par with every other place mentioned, so now I am truly weighing my decision solely based on quality of food, and quality of service and delivery. Fyi, this place also always has buffet option, which I personally have only done just once. I do see most people choosing the buffet which does include a ice cream bar, but for me I need my specific curry dishes. Keep up the great work."], ["Linda A.", "I have gone to Thai Cafe several times in the past year in different group combinations, from dinner for 2 and 8 people family dining. In every instance we were able to find comfortable seating and our meals were serve in a timely manner. This is a mom and pop operation. I mention this because of the decor and atmosphere. There are other Thai restaurants that are prettier and maybe more appropriate for a first date occasion. The Thai Cafe building use to be a long john silver's back when I was a kid so it possesses an older, lived in feel. The interior dining area is aesthetically practical and no frills.Food wise I really enjoy their pad thai and spring rolls. My kids love the cream cheese spring rolls (all cheese with none of that imitation crab meat) and the bubble teas. I've had both the buffet and off menu and have been pleased every time I have gone. In terms of the buffet it's vegetarian options are limited but the food is fresh and attended to. My only one criticism and I fully admit that this is probably a judgement call but at times the food really favours the oily and fried. Personally I like a clean steamed taste to my veggies but in terms of sauteed and fried foods, the dishes are still tasty.The staff is friendly and is helpful in answering questions about their dishes, including differences between curries, sauces and ingredients."], ["Steve O.", "I love this place but too bad they are closed on Sunday. \u00a0For around $10 you can explore a lot of thai dishes. \u00a0The quality of the food is good, not great but you can't really complain since it's a buffet. \u00a0Service is good and there is an old Thai lady there that doesn't seem to smile but that is ok with me. \u00a0I'm just there for the food."], ["Pooline N.", "On a regular business trip to San Antonio, I decided to try some place different. \u00a0Read the first couple reviews on Yelp and decided on this place. \u00a0What a mistake. \u00a0The first clue should have been that I was the only person there at 6.30 pm. \u00a0Ordered Phad Thai and spring rolls. \u00a0The spring rolls were oily and average at best. \u00a0The Phad Thai was the worst I have ever had, it was excessively sweet (talking desert sweet here) and very strong on the fish sauce - no heat or sour at all! \u00a0When I asked if it was supposed to be that sweet - they said that they would fix it, only to bring it back after adding a whole lot more fish sauce, making it wholly inedible. \u00a0There must have been some change at this place to turn a place that was getting such great reviews into the place I walked into today. Eventually ended up paying a bill of $20 for Phad Thai, Spring rolls and an iced tea - all I had was the ice tea and 2 spring rolls, very expensive indeed"], ["Jacqueline M.", "My father and I were in the neighborhood and craving Thai food so we decided to stop here and give it a shot. The restaurant was completely empty which made us somewhat weary. They have a tv playing YouTube videos of travelers enjoying Asian food in various Asian cities. I ordered a Thai tea and yellow curry. My dad got combination fried rice and asked for it to be slightly spicy. Together we shared an order of cheese rolls. The tea was fantastic and the food was quickly brought out to us. Everything was delicious and fresh! Our waitress was also very sweet and patient. We are definitely returning to try their buffet :-)"], ["Amy M.", "For close to 20 years, I have regarded this as the BEST Thai food ever. The standard by which all other Thai food is measured. I don't get there often, as I live out of town and it's far off my beaten path. I got to stop in today. I was so excited! Until I sat down to eat it. It was supposed to be Pad Prig Khing Nua ---Red curry, beef, green beans. It was bland, flavorless, and blah. It was.... shudder, gasp......Chinese food. If I wanted Chinese, I would have gone elsewhere and paid far less. If there was ANY curry at all in that flavorless brown gravy, I couldn't detect it. I am so crushed by this. So very, very crushed. I guess I will keep the happy memories, but I won't ever be back.  \u00a0Let's put it this way, I didn't pay 17 dollars for Panda Express, but I got Panda Express. \u00a0So sad!"], ["Phi T.", "I like going during lunch since there's a buffet, good variety and cheap.

What a great experience, the food was hot, tasty and delicious on the buffet. I tried the Thai beef salad (outstanding), pad thai, yum na, and the red curry.The yum na and laab lai are beef or chicken pieces stir fried with vegetables and spices in a beautiful medley of flavor and heat. These dishes as others can be eaten alone or placed over the white jasmine steamed rice by the start of the buffet line.There were a lot of fresh, sauteed vegetables this time--one stand out being the sauteed baby bok choi, or it might be Hmon gai choy, a Thai cabbage. The red curry with pork was flavor central, outstanding. Imagine tomatoes, stewed pork, and a number of green root vegetables in a savory, sour, and salty thin soup in a coconut milk base. This dish can be placed over rice or eaten like a soup. I ate 3 bowls of it like a soup. \u00a0Another thing: what makes all these dishes come together is the 5 or six sauces by the eggrolls. Two are sweet with maybe coconut or papaya in them, but the other 4 are Thai fish sauces, which are salty, fermented, umami-tasting, and crisp. That fish sauce is a must to be poured on all your dishes. You could even dip your eggrolls or your sticky rice in that fish sauce. That Thai fish sauce will change your life.I will never go to a Chinese buffet again (with the exception of my standby) after eating this food."], ["Tasha G.", "This place was great!

I was pleasantly surprised to find a respectable Thai place via Yelp. It is kinda in the middle of no where, and I had to go 20 minutes out of the way to get here, but it was so worth it. When you go to any Thai place and the people working there are actually Thai, from the waitstaff to the cooks, that's a HUGE sign that it will be a good meal. We talked with the owners and they are family owned and operated for the last 17 years now and after eating the food, I know why. The food is not fancy, just really good home cooking. The flavors were slightly tweaked, but the flavors were very close to what you get back in Thailand. And for all you can eat for $10 bucks at lunch is amazing!The food:I really liked their fried spare ribs, their saut\u00e9ed eggplant, their stir fried mushrooms, their string beans, and their beef salad. I didn't get a chance to try everything since there is a lot to choose from."], ["Connors S.", "For a night that we sat down and ordered, the entrees are decent in taste, but with minor mismatched ingredient sizes. An example would be the chicken ginger having big pepper quarters in contrast with ground up pieces of chicken. It's confusing whether to eat with a spoon or fork throughout, but more frustrating when the protein is hard to get at. Avoid the extras with the soup and rolls. Our soup was like old salt water with cilantro all over the top. The two rolls you get are indistinguishable from each other until you bite into them, where the spring roll was okay, but the cream cheese roll was like biting into a stick of butter. Enjoy that game of Russian Rollette.The buffets are many times over more populated, but the food temperatures in the warming trays are a bit cold. If the food is inconsistent or one dish is poor quality, at least you can just choose something else during those times.

Everything was very good especially considering it was buffet food. One thing i really like about the place is the sauces. They have maybe 6 different sauces that I've never had at any other thai restaurant in san Antonio. Each one was unique and had complex flavors. The same could said for the curry dishes. My favorite was the green curry which had jalape\u00f1os and a large pea looking veggie i don't even know the name of. Sometimes curries can end up tasting very similar at other restaurants but here each one had a distinct flavor. And just spicy enough. They had a green a red and a yellow curry dish. My other favorite was a dish that had noodles, chicken and lots of ginger. Some might be turned off by the strong ginger flavor but i love ginger and i love that it was so strong without being overpowering in this dish. Every other dish was amazing and i will definitely be back to try some of the things i missed this time. Another plus about this place: they have an ice cream bar. I know it sounds silly but its a nice touch. Oh and they have these desert dishes: tapioca with corn served warm and a banana tapioca? also served warm. Which is different but good and feels like its something ng somebody's Thai grandmother would make. Oh and theres the sticky rice... Look this place is great and its the only Thai place in town that I've seen thai people eating at so you know it's authentic. There was a big Thai family eating there when we went and every other person there was Thai so there's that. The buffet is $9 something but i think its definitely worth it."], ["Mike K.", "I came in between lunch and dinner so it's not a fair time to judge a buffet, but....

Somehow the \"a la cart\" portion doesn't come with a spring roll, or so I was told since my order didn't come with one.

The place still has an unmistakable mom & pop vibe, but at $9.96 for all you can eat, amazingly good Thai food, you can deal with it. Plus it is kind of nice.They have a policy that I have never run into before, but that I appreciate. \"Take what you eat and eat what you take.\" From my understanding, if you leave food on your plate then you will pay an extra charge. This I imagine is to discourage people from taking things they will not eat, keep costs down, which is probably how they are able to pull this off. I appreciate it because I am appalled at how much food is wasted at most buffets.

The Chinese parsley made it taste bright and clean.My main course was Kra Prao Gai (chicken with basil and hot pepper) . The dish had the same simple, boiled chicken as my soup.

Purely aesthetically, not the most impressive first date place.

But I guess I should have known better, because central Texas is not exactly known for authentic or great Thai food. And the \"buffet\" concept means it all slops together anyway, in a pretty unappetizing way on your plate. (Given that most of the dishes are moist to start with.) Even from the outside I knew to be wary: there's basically no feng shui at all, except the excellent bougainvillea vines. Inside, the sticky rice was great, and the chicken coconut/galangal soup was really decent, but the food was blah. I couldn't finish my plate -- didn't want to -- and the fact that the buffet had not one but two signs scolding patrons if they took more than they ate was pretty significant. I know that wasting food cuts into the restaurant's profit -- but remember what your mom had to warn you to finish on YOUR plate growing up? The stuff you didn't want to eat. Same thing here. I'm sorry because this is the first time Yelp's let me down; but I think it has more to do with central Texas diners not having much sophistication in what good Thai food is like. I've been eating it in urban centers since 1984, and cooking it since then, too. And this was pretty yuck. Basically seemed more Polynesian than Thai. Things were salty, sticky and mushy -- like yesterday's leftovers. No likey."], ["elsa f.", "Blink, and you will miss it!

One magical day of indulgent reckoning, I decided I needed to eat as much delicious food as possible. After some searching, I found out Thai Cafe has a lunch buffet. Upon experiencing this veritable orgy of food, I learned that every item offered is indeed delicious.The selections range from the obvious appetizers--spring rolls and cream cheese rolls [the cheese rolls not exactly floating my boat, but they might get yours sailing...] with an impressive array of sauces, to curries and vegetarian dishes with an alarmingly savory quality. Pad Thai and Pad Wun Sen both hit the spot, and several soothing soups and fruit options, along with sticky rice, soothe my overfull tummy effectively. Unexpectedly, a decent selection of standard ice creams are also offered, but after gorging on the other buffet items, I have never made it to that impressive echelon of gluttony.

Baby Friendly: Yes Last time I was here my husband and I were on our babymoon and my baby girl was in my belly for 6 months and now I returned w baby 8 months old and it was just mommy and baby this time and I ...ordered the whole menu. Literally, almost. There was this yelp promo of $40 voucher for only $30 so of course I buy it. And seeing as how I was traveling to SA with just me and baby (husband was in Cali attending another wedding) meals had to be easy, real easy. Mama ain't got time to drive out for every meal. So I wanted leftovers anyways to eat for lunches the next 2 days in our hotel room. And Thai food make the best leftover meals - 3 dimensional flavors well absorbed into the noodles, curry, papaya, yummy galore! \u00a0And may I add - I drove 15 miles from our hotel with baby in tow for this meal. Worth it. So what did I order? \u00a0Pretty the same exact thing except: 1. Full order of cheese sticks rather than just half2. Red curry instead of yellow simply bc I just wanted to try something new - if you do not like eggplant but potatoes more - stick to the yellow curry. Red was good but I am big the hugest fan of eggplant. Not Thai Hut's fault, just mine for being overly adventurous for my own taste. 3. Papaya Salad with salted crab. It was yum but I felt like something was missing! \u00a0It was the crunchy peanuts! \u00a0And you have the option to choose bw peanuts, salted crab and something else - choose peanuts bc it just so belongs in the dish! Salted crab was still good though. 4. Mango and sticky rice was sold out. \u00a0:( that's what I get for coming to late, close to closing time. I shouldn't be surprised; last time we had it it seemed like it prepared daily and once it's gone that day it's gone. 5. Extra Tom yum small to go to get me right over the $40 voucher mark Total order: 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 1 Thai teaOnce I walked in I was warmly greeted by a lady and the entire staff was all smiles and very hospitable. They were all sweet to my baby too. The restaurant was full which I was so happy to see and when it was time to pay, I went up to the counter to do so and told them I have a yelp voucher. They kindly welcomed it (have y'all ever experienced using a promo coupon/voucher and the staff grumbles while receiving it? \u00a0Whatevs- no comment there, SMH - anyways) and bill came out to be $41.15 - score! \u00a0Yup, I did all that math in my head while ordering. Used $40 voucher that I only paid $30 for and balance came down to $1.15. Then I tipped 20% bc of their excellent service (should have seen how many Togo boxes the nice lady packed for me - she even asked me if I wanted more limes to take home with me! Totally unheard of btw - Asian restaurants I have been to are super sheisty on their limes!) total bill = $39.15. Divide that out to 3 glorious meals =$13/meal.

This last time, though, was sorry. I've had better frozen Thai meals. The chicken was rubbery. They skimped on the vegetables. The sauce was not the same, or authentic, and not entirely pleasant. The man who took my order over the phone said it was sugar, and soy sauce based, which concerned me for a moment, but it didn't have any allergy triggers, and I was starving. The noodles were over cooked! Getting a little queasy just recalling. They've also changed the menu, and it's far less veg friendly, more fish sauce laden which is deadly for me. I pretend like they've closed. RIP Thai Taste."], ["Cesar M.", "Thai Taste is all about the taste, lovely food, lovely service. Both the Green Curry and the Pad Thai were excellent.

Dinner only.The lunch menu is smaller and limited, which I completely understand during a busy lunch hour. It's just not my thing. There weren't many vegetarian options, and unfortunately I reluctantly ordered Pad Thai. Allow me to preface with the fact that I dislike Pad Thai, and don't order it very often, if ever. I know, I know, how could I hate such an infamous dish? Well, it smells like wet dog. Perhaps now that I've put the idea in your mind, you'll notice it next time. The hot and sour soup was delicious. I think it's hot and sour, but they call it \"house soup\". I devoured that bowl along with the egg roll. The Pad Thai was edible, and the tea was good. I may give this place another shot during dinner.The service here is pretty good. Drinks were refilled promptly and the food came quickly. The booth I sat at wasn't cleaned very well.

The lunch special comes with a soup and an egg roll which are certainly good value for the price you pay. Lunch is also pretty quick. Servers are always friendly.

So many delicious choices made my head spin, and I settled on my usual favorite at Thai places: green curry with tofu and veggies. I ordered it a seven on the spicy scale, and it was hot enough to make me sweat while keeping the other flavors intact. Huge portions mean I have plenty of curry for lunch the next day!

We were seated very quickly by a man who seemed less than interested in us being there. The friendly waitress quickly took our order and the food was out in no time.Two of us had the Pad Thai and the other two ate the Panang Nui. Preceding the entr\u00e9e (if ordering the lunch special) is a nice and rather large cabbage soup with some tofu. It's a slightly thickened soup with plenty of salt and pepper but not overwhelmingly so. After the soup, the entrees were delivered and that's kind of where things took a bit of a turn. The Pad Thai and the Panang Nui lunch specials are quite small. Considering the specials come with a nice bowl of soup, an egg roll, and tea (no sweet tea, FYI, but they do have sugar and sugar substitute on the table), I guess I can't complain too much. Anyway, everyone enjoyed the taste and heat of their respective dishes although one in our party did complain about the Pad Thai noodles being on the mushy side. The Panang Nui's beef was obviously simmered in the curry long enough to make it quite tender and it boasted a nice south east Asian flavor. It's served with your choice of white or fried rice. The egg roll was amazingly unspectacular.All the lunch specials are $6.95 with a few exceptions. I think the combination Pad Thai (shrimp AND chicken) is $7.95. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but were not blown away. The service, other than the man at the register, was quite nice. The quantity of the entr\u00e9e could have been more substantial but when served with the sizeable bowl of soup, egg roll, and tea, you walk out feeling satisfied.If you're in the neighborhood, Thai Taste will sufficiently give you your Thai fix.

Their curry dishes are on point too. \u00a0As might be expected, lunch portions are, well, lunch portions. \u00a0If you want a buffet go to a buffet. \u00a0The dinner portions are larger and more family style as one entr\u00e9e can feed two people if you order some appetizers or whatever. \u00a0You'll definitely take home leftovers with the dinner portion. As I'm sure other people have mentioned on this site, Thai Taste has a spiciness numerical system on their dishes with 10 being the hottest. \u00a0I love my food spicy but rarely get above a 4 here because I like to also enjoy my food. \u00a0I love when people come here order 8s & 9s then complain it's way too spicy, or that they need many many refills on their drinks. \u00a0It's hilarious. \u00a0I think some dishes are generally more spicy than others, or the chef prepares things differently, because a spicy 4 on one dish may not be the same on another. \u00a0The ambiance is casual. \u00a0Since I've been away they've redone their interior so it's a bit more nice looking. \u00a0It's rarely super packed except on the occasional lunch rush from medical. \u00a0But normally you can get in and get seated very quickly. \u00a0For me, this is a huge plus because I can come here on a Saturday night with a date, have a decent meal, without waiting for a table. \u00a0There's nothing I hate more than waiting for a table at a restaurant: \u00a0the Olive Garden and Texas Road House are not that good San Antonio! \u00a0lols.You also have to try their spring rolls if you're not going for lunch (soup & an egg roll is included during lunch hours). \u00a0They are almost as good as my mother's and that is saying a lot. \u00a0The chicken satay is good too. \u00a0Finally, I'm in love with their hot and sour soup. \u00a0It's simply the best, ever. \u00a0Yea, I said it: E-V-E-R.I have a Thai friend who brought her mom here. \u00a0While she enjoyed her meal, my friend's mom said this wasn't authentic Thai cuisine. Fair enough. \u00a0Since I'm not Thai, have never been to Bangkok, and live in South Texas, I say Thai Taste is succeeding in what it set out to do: giving people a fair interpretation of Thai dishes that are enjoyable to the majority its clientele: hoity-toity reviewers on Yelp notwithstanding (you know who you are). \u00a0I think I'm gonna have lunch there today.

Sometimes you'll realize that the scale of 1-10 for how spicy can fluctuate. That a 5 you had last time wasn't hot but then the next time the 5 is on fire!!! From what I heard from a worker was that it depends on when they get the peppers. Super fresh peppers = more spicy than somewhat not so great peppers = less spicy.

I'll be honest - the burglar bars in the nearby shops made me question our safety but hey, sometimes these sketchy places have the best food. Service was prompt. We ordered crispy fried tofu. It came with a sweet sauce. I prefer my fried tofu dipped in soy sauce but the sweet and spicy sauce was not too bad. The tofu was boring though... I'm pretty sure they just cut up big blocks of tofu and fry them. It is an easy appetizer. I like tofu stuffed with mushrooms or lemongrass to jazz them up a little. For our entrees we got the 3 flavor fish and pumpkin curry with chicken. The pumpkin curry was delicious! If not for that curry I would have given this place 3 stars. I loved the sweetness of the squash and the flavorful and spicy curry broth. It paired incredibly well with the steamed rice that came with the dish. The chicken was plain and nothing to write home about but I didn't have high expectations for it to begin with. But, after reheating the leftovers at home, the chicken soaked in more curry flavor and transformed into tender and flavorful morsels. So good. The 3 flavor fish was good but a little too sweet and not spicy enough. After the pumpkin curry the fried fish paled in comparison. I loved the onions and tomatoes in the dish though.

I went with a few friends on a Friday night; we didn't have to wait, but the place was PACKED. There were so many people fit into this tiny restaurant, and it really gave the whole place a lively and bustling atmosphere. As for the staff, they seem to be a little bit shorthanded because there was a bit of a wait between each activity (drink order, food order, food arrival, checks etc.). However, the staff are really nice and you can tell that they do care.As for the food, we split a chicken satay appetizer, and I ordered a chicken pad thai. It was a lot of food! The chicken satay was pretty good; I loved their peanut sauce, but I felt that the chicken ended up being a bit dry. On the other hand, I really enjoyed their pad thai. The noodles were chewy, and it came with plenty of toppings. My only negative would be that it seems like they make their pad thai very, very, very mild compared to how it actually is in Thailand."], ["Patrick G.", "Some of the best food I have had in my life has come from some of the most unassuming locations I have seen. \u00a0Thai Dee continues this trend and offers diners great Thai food in a location that would scare off most people.The first things that caught my attention were the three cop cars in the parking lot surrounding the corner store with bars on the windows. \u00a0They were taking up most of the room in the small parking lot so I had to wait for them to move so I could park. \u00a0Once out of my car, I was very excited for the food when I saw the sign on the door that talked about the dress code. \u00a0No sleeveless shirts and must wear shoes please. \u00a0Just like great art coming from quirky artists, great food normally comes from quirky chefs and cooks and this sign seemed extremely quirky when you comprehend the idea of a dress code surrounded by the corner store/cops/barred windows/graffiti.Once inside, I was not disappointed. \u00a0I went with the pumpkin red curry ($12) and spring rolls ($4). \u00a0My partner went with the panang curry ($11). \u00a0She is very picky when it comes to chicken quality and this place passed her test with flying colors. \u00a0They used quality ingredients that melded together perfectly in the bowl. \u00a0There was heat but it wasn't overpowering. \u00a0The vegetables were fresh and the addition of pumpkin instead of potato or sweet potato was a great idea. \u00a0The quantity was also very large as we both took home leftovers.Overall, Thai Dee was exactly what I wanted to find in this city. \u00a0I great Thai food restaurant that is unassuming yet charming. \u00a0The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. \u00a0They were interacting with their regulars in a way that you would with family members. \u00a0They served great food in a great little Thai oasis that I would recommend to anyone. \u00a0I look forward to returning and trying some other meals."], ["Gen M.", "They served me bad/spoiled rice.

Everything I tasted was pleasant but not amazing."], ["Nicole D.", "Food was delicious, well spiced, fresh and big portion.

I had stopped at 3 other restaurants before finding this one and this was the only one open 11am on a Saturday. Pad Thai didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping, a little bland. A little soy sauce added did the trick. \u00a0Their veggie spring rolls were yummy. \u00a0A little greasy from the frying, but their sauce to dip them in was fantastic! I'd love a bottle of that stuff!! Atmosphere is nice and the waiter/waitress that I saw were super friendly and didn't let my water get more than half empty."], ["Victoria B.", "I love this place!

The food is wonderful my partner got the three flavor fish dish and it was wonderful! He let me taste a bite.Mine was wonderful too,I got the green curry one time and the Penang curry with pumpkin another time, but both very delicious but a little on the spicy side even at a number two spice level.

I got the Khee Mao (Spicy Noodles) with beef, and it was a spicy and very flavorful, very delicious dishHe got the Chicken Pai Thai, I only had a bite and it is is a bit just too sweat and sour for me. He liked it though.The free soup with lunch is just ok, soy sauce based chicken soup. The service is excellent, their refilled our ice tea and lemonade without us asking for it.

The place is nothing to brag about from the outside. If you didn't know better, from the outside you think it's a condemned restaurant waiting for the health inspector to post a closed sign on the door.

Great Thai food, great staff!"], ["Melissa M.", "Craved thai on the way home from the airport and stopped here for food after dropping off a friend. We got pick up. This is only the second place in San Antonio I've found authentic pad kee mao (drunken noodles), so I approve! It had a good amount of spice and was soy sauce based like it should be. There was also a good amount of basil. My friend got the pad see ew and it was pretty good also, but not as flavorful as the pad kee mao. The beef was also tender in both dishes and there was a good amount, although I would have preferred to have more noodles rather than beef. Overall, if I'm in the area with friends I would like to try more things on the menu. One con is the restaurant is located in a pretty sketch part of town and is pretty sketch looking on the outside. The inside is pretty cozy though. I don't think I'd feel safe coming here at night without friends. Overall, pretty solid thai food though."], ["Cecilia G.", "The food is delicious and very fresh!!

I'll be back here for sure."], ["Jin M.", "Let me just preface this review by saying the neighborhood is a tiiiiiiiiiny bit sketchy, but don't let that deter you from this awesome Thai restaurant. Don't look around, don't worry about what that guy's doing over there in the street, don't slow down to see how long that building has been abandoned, just find Thai Dee, find parking, lock your door (twice), and walk in the restaurant. Speaking of parking--- there's a small parking lot in front of the restaurant, but it's usually full, especially on busy days (weekends, dinners, busy lunch), but there's always street parking available near the restaurant. Small restaurant, but because the service is super fast, you won't wait too long. Unless you have an unusually large group- then you might want to call ahead. They'll clean those tables so fast & efficiently, you won't even remember the people that just sat there. And the service! So prompt, so friendly, -- I mean, as soon as one of my friends dropped a fork, one of the servers handed her a new fork right away (SECONDS). It's like she knew that fork was going to fall on the floor at that second. I know. So! Things we ordered: Spring Rolls, Crab Ragoons, Red Curry (with tofu), Pad Thai (with chicken), Massaman Curry (with beef), and Spicy Noodles (with chicken). Spring Rolls are a little different from what you would get at a Vietnamese/Pho restaurant- the paper wrapping was thicker/not clear, but nevertheless, delicious and fresh! Crab Ragoons were nice & big, fried perfectly. Red Curry--- ohhhh my- let me tell you about my Red Curry. Full of flavor, perfectly spicy, LOTS of contents (lack of a better word, sorry): Lots of tofu, lots of bamboo shoots (LOVE bamboo shoots), lots of other veggies. My friends thoroughly enjoyed their dish as well. One of my friends even commented this Pad Thai was the best she's ever had. Sweet/quaint family owned business tucked away on Blanco Rd- it's definitely worth trying. Hopefully they will expand!"], ["Abigail P.", "Everything about this place is wonderful. The service is great. On a weekend evening, expect a crowd. The place is small, so arrive early if you are bringing a big group along. The place is also BYOB.

We actually celebrated our 5th year anniversary here & brought a bottle of champagne!My favorite is the combination fried rice (with huge pieces of shrimp!), red curry with chicken, pad thai, spring rolls, ....

The FOOD is amazing."], ["Cord L.", "The outside does not do justice to the quality of the food inside. Don't let the appearance keep you from enjoying such good food.

Definitely will be back!"], ["Nancy M.", "First my complaints, It might not be so bad during the week, but parking here on a Friday night at 6:30 was a nightmare! \u00a0 At least one of my friends parked across the street. \u00a0Service was just OK, what I didn't like is that our food came out at different times, one or two people would get their meal, then a bit later another meal would come out and then a bit later, another. \u00a0The interior is small and was crowded and very loud, making it hard to converse. They automatically added an 18% tip to the bill. \u00a0The food? \u00a0Ehh! \u00a0Nothing special to be honest. \u00a0Not in a huge hurry to get to my leftovers. \u00a0I prefer Sawasdee, but as I live on the NE side, will look for a Thai restaurant a bit closer to home."], ["J B.", "Finally tried this place. Ordered egg rolls, Tom yum and pad Thai. Egg rolls were amazing. Pad Thai was good, sweeter than I would have liked but good. Service was top notch and place was clean."], ["Jackee M.", "I like that this place is B.Y.O.W. (Bring your own bottle of Wine) for no extra charge. Not only that but I brought my Grandparents here who are usually picky eaters & they LOVED it. Portions are more than enough & the menu has A LOT to chose from for any picky eater.

Def. recommend trying this restaurant out at least once.... Lunch or dinner!"], ["S S.", "Thairrific! This place is a win. We ordered Thai coffees and waters. The coffees were made perfectly and taste amazing; not too bitter and not too sweet, it's just right. For our appetizer we had Tom Kha soup and Pork Spring rolls. The Tom Kha was delicious. Hint of lemon grass, great coconut flavor and just the right amount of sweetness to counter the rest of the flavors. Spring rolls were good. They were accompanied by a tamarind sauce sprinkled with peanuts. Different, but good! For our entrees we ordered the Panang Curry (Thai hot) and Pad Thai (medium spicy). Both came out with correct spicy level and tasted great! However, the Pad Thai does not have the original peanutty taste that you would expect. Instead, they use a house sauce that gives the dish a tangy taste. If I could recommend something else, it'd be the Green Curry with beef. Oh my goodness, is that good. No. Not good. Perfect! Dessert was Sticky rice topped with coconut ice cream. Sweet and simple! All in all a 10 out of 10. Thai Dee will never disappoint. Great ambiance, food, and service!"], ["Robert C.", "Thai is sensational here. Don't be fooled by the appearance outside. It might look like whole in the wall, but pleasant inside. We try the usual pad Thai with chicken. It was sweet, sour but needed more salt. The basil fish took the show. Immense flavor and abundance in fish. Next time we come we can bring our own beer or wine. Nice surprise for SA."], ["Ryan R.", "If a 4.5 were available this would be it... I am torn between 4 and 5 but the atmosphere and the people pushed it over for me.If you want very good Thai in a cool little location look here. The inside feels a bit like a little slice of Thailand and doesn't feel like San Antonio in a good way. The location is easy to get to from most parts of town and I have found a ton of good food in this area despite it being a bit \"off the beaten path\".Food was really good! I tried the Moo Ping which is a delicious pork dish served with an amazing an spicy lime sauce and sticky rice. I would eat this for all 3 meals a day the guy at the front told me this is a traditional Thai street food eaten in the mornings. I tried the vegetable egg rolls as well as a starter and they were good. Nothing life changing but a nice roll with great sauce.Overall the staff was really friendly and helpful. The guy at the front asked about my experience and then chatted with me about where the food was from and how it is usually eaten which I thought was cool. He told me more about the amazing lime sauce and really seemed to know his stuff.This is my Thai place for San Antonio trips!"], ["April-Denise H.", "Amazing great food!!! Spicy noodles, is no joke! It's spicy! i got it with shrimp (huge) & chicken \u00a0:) the wait staff is phenomenal! My drink was never empty, everyone is super nice and smiling!

My boyfriend got the pad Thai it was yum! We will go back soon.BYOB! So I admit I came back again the next day, with my mother and brother, my mother got the basil noodles, she absolutely loved it, as I knew she would. My brother got, the lemon grass, with tofu instead of chicken. It looked delious and tasted delicious. The soup of the day today was pretty much the same brother as the mushroom one, but only with cabbage this time. I order the pad see eew, it was just perfect, especially for a beginner, with thick noodles, and broccoli, eggs and shrimp and chicken. Was so tasty and yumm. And I got it mild. Even ordered a plate for my father Togo. :) Love this place and so close to where I live."], ["Bridget W.", "Absolutely delicious. Excellent service. Will be coming back again.Appetizers: We tried golden shrimp, which was not what I was expecting. It was unique, delicious. Calamari was solid but nothing special.Entrees: Moo Ping-- so, so, so delicious. The meat is perfectly marinaded, the sauce is bright and pairs well, and the sticky rice is good. This was the highlight for everyone at our table. Pad see ewe is also solid. My father enjoyed his ginger fish. I think my sister ordered the bamee soba; whatever her dish was, she enjoyed it. My husband ordered a panang curry-- he asked for the spiciest they could deliver and was disappointed in the level of spicy. He still enjoyed the curry but not the best he's ever had.Service: Great service!Environment: The tables feel a little crowded together, but overall, it's clean.

Parking is not a big issue here either and they get the food out to you rather quickly. Give it a try during the week or weekend because they are open during both! I tend to stick with vegetable and chicken dishes in Asian places and so far this place hits both on the mark. Everything tastes fresh and not out of a can like some places.

I recently had gone just as a normal dinner for my dad had suggested when I mentioned I wanted thai. Usually I would get a broccoli and chicken or chicken pad Thai, but due to a change in diet (pescitarian), I ordered the \"Golden Sea\" it was a beautiful medley of their thick noodles, vegetables, shrimp, squid, and muscles all in a delicious brown type of sauce. I was very impressed and plan to explore their seafood side of their menu more often. Service is always amazing and kind; it's not complicated to grab your waiter's attention due to the small space.  \u00a0 I only have one complaint and it's about the noise. When we arrived, we chose the worst table. The people next to us were young kids constantly cussing, one guy was hacking, and laughing ever so obnoxiously. It is not the restaurants' fault of course, but the limited space and the boxy type shape of this restaurant, makes it impossible to have a low conversation when busy. Sound bounces of the walls onto your plates and it gets quite annoying especially when the loud people next to you have finished eating and don't leave for another 30 minutes.  \u00a0I recommend the restaurant buy out the store that shut down right next to it and expand!

The tea is delicious and i have to agree with a previous review when they said they think it has honey. The service was quick and polite. I ordered to go but i could tell from the two tables being served it would be a good experience. The dishes of the other customers looked delicious but i ordered the pad thai. Not the best pad thai ive had, but probably the second best. Fresh flavor, not dry or over cooked. Not overly saturated in sauce. My only complaint there is i would have liked more green onions and maybe some chopped peanuts to sprinkle on top. But the onions are an easy fix. As i was waiting for my food they were preparing something with fresh bunches of leaves.

That's not bad, and it's definitely cheaper than what the aloft hotel down the street would've charged! Portions were appropriate, and here are my thoughts on each of the items:Egg rolls: Bigger than most places, or I am getting too used to Vietnamese-style egg rolls LOL. They were probably about half the width of my palm and about 6in long, which is not bad at all. I got the pork egg rolls (also have a choice of veggies only), and they were good.Tom Yum soup: At first glance, I was a bit wary. Normally when I get Tom Yum soup, it has a reddish tint, but there was no red tint. In fact, because the soup was so brown, I thought they may have given the wrong soup (the coconut milk based soup). But after that first delicious sip, I thought, \"Nope, it's the right soup!\" The soup had the right amount of spice and lemongrass. Sometimes I wonder if I should just order the broth since I never eat all the veggies anyway. :-) I am glad though that this place has a side portion, as there are many Thai restaurants out there that do not.Pad Thai: This had the right amount of spice, even though it's interesting I was not asked to specify the amount. The noodles were cooked appropriately and unlike a Thai restaurant in Evansville, IN, did not make a squishy sound as you ate (a definite plus). My only concern about the entree is that there were a LOT of eggshells - so many I did not eat half of the dish. For this, I dock a star from 4 stars. Rice pudding: DELICIOUS and hit the spot after the last three items. The sweetness was just right - not too much but not too little. I finished all of this!I called ahead for pickup (prior to going to HEB nearby), the order was promised as ready within 15-20 minutes, and upon arrival, the order was waiting for me. Had there not been so many eggshells in my Pad Thai (probably a fluke), I would've given four stars. The ambience of the restaurant seemed homey with Thai decorations, and I loved the wood paneling. If I ever stay near the airport again, this is the place to eat!"], ["Kearstin C.", "I was in San Antonio for three months for some training and I went to Thai Dee.I LOVE Thai food and I am very picky about it; I was staying downtown and tried other thai places but they were not as good (see review on Orchid Lao Thai).This place was the best in the SA area in my option.It looks clean inside and always has a full house.Mango and Sticky rice is AMAZING; Pad se ew, Pad Thai were some of my favorites.Price is a little expensive."], ["James T.", "The food was great.

I won't comment on the area because that's already extreeemely played out, but what I will say is that once you enter the door and have a seat amongst their hodgepodge mix of d\u00e9cor, you will be greeted with a smile and a warm cup of soup. Usually, the soups that are included with a lunch special at Thai/Asian places consist of a couple of pieces of cabbage and a whole lot of broth, or something equally lacking in consistency. Not here! It was the most delicious Tom Yum Gai I have had in a long while! Our order was taken promptly and all 3 servers seemed to work in sync to take care of the entire restaurant and not just their \"assigned areas.\" For $7.99 you will be amazed at the huge portions they give you! I didn't think that my green curry with chicken and crunchy noodles was sweet, on the contrary, it was nice and spicy! My mouth was slightly on fire but that didn't stop me from eating more and more. The 2 spring rolls that come alongside the lunch specials were amazingly crunchy and tasty, and they hit it right on the mark with their egg roll dipping sauce. Once I swapped plates with my other half, I didn't wanna give it back! He ordered the pad woon sen, but with stir fried rice noodles instead of glass noodles. That dish, I will admit, was sweet. But nothing a little chili-garlic couldn't fix :) The noodles were not too greasy, the chicken was cooked to perfection, and the veggies still had a nice crunch. The food was so great that I would love to try out everything on their menu, something I am not always willing to do since I am quite comfortable with my comfort zone. As for the Thai coffee, the coffee was pretty strong, but not a problem since we just added a little bit of water. Perhaps a little extra cream would have been just as good? Quick tips: this restaurant is BYOB and if paying with plastic, they have a minimum of $10. You can also call ahead if you are in need of some tasty to-go food.

W.", "3.5 star. I came to this restaurant once when I flew to SA for my apartment hunting trip before I relocated here. I read some of the reviews before my trip so I knew it is in a sketchy neighborhood. When I pulled up my rental car here, I was like \"wow this is indeed a sketchy area\". I made sure to click my remote 3 times to ensure I locked my car and also parked my car right in front of the restaurant so I could keep an eye on it. It is probably not that bad. But since I was visiting from out of town, I wanted to be extra careful. \u00a0The inside was actually not sketchy at all! It was very nice and cozy. My server was super friendly and we had a nice little conversation. I was impressed that she was wearing a very pretty Thai outfit, that's cute! I couldn't afford food coma b/c I needed to look at more apartments so I only ordered Pad Thai. I got my food quickly, it was good but very greasy for some reason. The portion was big so i only finished half of it. I feel I should give Thai Dee another chance. Maybe I will come back one of these days and update my review.

You will not be able to find better fried tofu and fresh, creamy curries anywhere else. (If you do let me know).

If the cook of the restaurant knows how to fry some tofu then I usually expect a high quality meal right after. \u00a0This time around we had the fried tofu as appetizer. The tofu was crispy and it fully absorbed the flavors of the sweet and tangy sauce that accompanied it. It s an explosion of flavors in your mouth.I had the red pumpkin curry and my friend had the Musaman curry. I like to taste my curry sauces before I jump into the meal to truly appreciate the effort that was put into making the curry (most important part of the dish) and my God, \u00a0I could have just have had that curry as a soup. The red pumpkin curry sauce was spicy, creamy, and perfect. I had a combination of vegetables and chicken. All vegetables tossed in my curry were fresh and delicious. The chicken truly absorbed all of the veggie and red curry flavors and it tasted amazing. I like to toss in some rice into my curry at a steady rate so that the rice does not absorb all the curry and the rice that was provided was just the right amount for my curry.My friend had the Musaman curry and this one is something else too. The mix of potatoes, avocado, and other fresh veggies + deliciously cooked tofu made a perfect combination with the coconut milk for an overall outstanding flavor and creamy consistency.

I could see the stir-fried fresh Thai chiles in the mix along with the basil, sweet red peppers and onion. My wife had her old standby of shrimp pad thai. A first for me on this visit were the potstickers I haven't ever had theirs before and I was impressed. It was as if they were deep fried on the outside and the filling in them was rich and meaty.

My family was in the mood for Thai and so, it being later in the evening, say 8 PM, settled on a place closest to where we were driving through. Upon walking in, the restaurant was oddly lit with numerous wobbly ceiling fans and -- perhaps to class the atmosphere up a bit -- nightlights plugged into high-positioned outlets, acting as faux miniature wall sconces. (Also, let's not forget the aquarium with its flickering lightbulb!) To top things off, instead of utilizing their wall-mounted TV for something useful (e.g. Game 6 of the NBA Finals, etc.), they found it fitting to blast piano-laden, karaoke-quality classical music through its speakers. Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' is always beautiful, except when played dizzyingly fast via some automated keyboard robot. Fcuk.Nearly half of the dining booths still had dirty tableware -- and each of the four small tables appeared off-balance -- so we were placed at the booth directly beneath the Beethoven TV. So fun. Much music. Wow. [Catching the sarcasm?] Fortunately everything improved, more or less, moving forward...Service was friendly, accommodating, quick. The menu was straightforward; prices agreeable. The food itself, not a hit by any stretch of the imagination, was thus a miss... presentation, overall taste/quality, temperature... all barely acceptable at best. Lackluster is the most appropriate word.Ultimately, I would pass on this place in the future.

I've been twice now to Thai Hot and have had the spring rolls, curry puff pastry, cheese sticks, dumplings, pad woon sen and garlic chicken. I have tasted a tofu curry dish and the vermicelli rice with chicken. Everything I have tasted is great! I recommend starting with either the cheese sticks or the curry puff pastries, and then dive right in to one of their noodle dishes. For dessert, you must have the sweet sticky rice with mango!

THey claimed it was their first day of business so we weren't expecting utter delight. The menu though was pretty good in the sense that they offered several options of plates that sounded delicious and with your choice of meat, veggies, or tofu. I'm a fan of hot and sour soup and their's did not disappoint. I could say \"yeah, it could be better\" but I don't want to be that guy, so it was pretty good. My wife went with a dish that had flat noodles and tofu with snap peas and a delicious spicy sauce. The name of the dish doesn't come to mind but it was pretty good. I went with the garlic chicken dish and was very satisfied. While our meal was just over $30 there was enough food for us to eat and a couple days worth of leftovers, if you're into that sort of thing.

The waitress checked in frequently, filling the waters often and checking to see if we needed anything else, even after we had ordered. At the end, when we asked for the boxes, it took her no time at all to provide us what we asked for. There were lots of options, including vegetarian and gluten free foods for those with restrictions. The spring rolls that I had, made with rice wrapping, had so much flavor - I think I would go back just for the rolls. The appearance of the food added onto the experience - the food was, well , pretty. My friends were very satisfied with their orders as well.

They were excellent and tasty. I was expecting them to come out in rice paper, unfried. They were fried but I wouldn't have it any other way. The Pad Thai was also a large, large portion. I've never had Pad Thai before (yes I know, I'm a few years behind!) but this was good. The cook came out a few seconds after my dish and let me know she forgot my spice. No biggie, I thought this was better because I was able to regulate the temperature.

The amount of meat was fair and the portion was large. I can't say for sure what was happening, but the aesthetics of the food was severely lacking. It looked absolutely disgusting, and I found myself having to look away so I could finish my meal. It was so odd to have my mouth and my eyes in complete disagreement.

My wife's allergic to MSG, so we are very careful about where we eat Asian food. Never once has Thai House slipped us some secret sauce, and I can't say that about every Thai place we've visited here. No names, but you can't always trust them to exclude it. But never a problem at Thai House. And the food is as good as I've had anywhere. Spicy (I like), but not too spicy. You can ask for it to be spicier, but I've learned never to challenge the staff when they tell you it's spicy.We order the Pad Thai with chicken (you can get it with beef, shrimp or tofu), the Beef Panang curry, and the Prawns in Chili Sauce. I would punch a nun for those prawns, so zesty, so crunchy... they're perfect. And we'll usually get the Thai iced tea with it, too -- that will keep you going for the rest of the day, no doubt about it.We've been going here for years, since before the fire, and they've come back better than ever.

Spicy 5 or 6?It came back to me looking like garlic & pepper, chicken. I know what ginger looks like and tastes like. I am even familiar with gingers other cousins and smells. I sure did not taste ginger in my dish. So, it def was not what I ordered. But I was already eating it so, I was like whatever, I told the waiter it was wrong. But I says it's fine I can eat this. I must say I never seen so much chopped up garlic in this type of dish before, thinly sliced chicken pieces, lots of sliced bell peppers & onions, and very saucy.

And this is no small feat, considering the number of Thai restaurants we have in San Antonio per capita. It almost seems like a new Thai restaurant is popping up every other day.My girlfriend and I, who are big Thai food fans, were tipped off about this place by a couple of friends. Our friends told us the food was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. So, we decided to try it. Once we did, we decided that we'd be back over and over.Thai House is nestled on Rittiman Road between IH-35 and Harry Wurzbach. Don't let the unassuming building fool you, this place has offerings good enough to make it worth your stop. Don't feel like stopping in to eat? Call ahead and they do takeout well.If you are a beginner to Thai food, I recommend trying the signature Thai dish: Pad Thai. It is a rice noodle-based dish with bean sprouts, green onion, garlic, fried eggs, lime, cabbage, and crushed peanuts in a thick fish sauce. There are many variations to this and sometimes just an ingredient or two can make a big difference. I would get the Pad Thai with chicken, or tofu if you are vegetarian. The Pad Thai here is quite good, though the last time we took food out, the noodles were kind of clumped together signifying the fact that the noodles probably sat around for a while after cooking, but before being mixed in with all the other savory ingredients.Though I am not vegetarian, I tend to control my intake of meat. When I do not feel like eating meat and crave something healthier than Pad Thai, I go for the Thai basil eggplant with tofu. Few places in town have a better Thai basil eggplant than here at Thai House. The sauce is delectable, the amount of basil is just right, and you actually get a good amount of eggplant (some places tend to skimp on the eggplant).The Pad Woon Sen is similarly delicious, though it's different from the Pad Thai in that it's made with glass noodles and tends to have basil, more veggies, and no peanuts.Give this place a try. It will be worth it. Given their location and proximity to Fort Sam Houston and several businesses along Rittiman Road and IH-35, they are a good place for lunch."], ["Jon F.", "We tried the green curry based of our servers recommendation. \u00a0We don't take thai heat well so we asked if they could tame it down a bit. \u00a0She said they could add some coconut milk. \u00a0It was perfect. \u00a0The curry was very tasty.

The plate also comes with a fried roll. \u00a0You also get a soup with your meal - veggie \u00a0or hot & sour (depends on the day. \u00a0Their pad Thai is really very good as is their panang.

Contrary to the consensus, their dining area is actually not very small at all. I've come across much, much smaller restaurants in SA that keep pretty busy (e.g., Dough on Blanco and Burger Boy on N St. Mary's st). What makes it seem so cramped is the dim lighting, low ceiling and lack of windows. When I say lack of windows, I mean there are absolutely no windows to this place whatsoever. The only natural light (if any) comes from the entrance door which is tinted. All factors combined kind of make you feel like you're in a cave. So if you or anyone in your party are claustrophobic, you might want to take note of all this. Oh, but the food! It more than makes up for it. They have some of the best Pad Woon Sen and Pad Thai I've ever had. Meat is always tender, flavorful, and never drowning in sprouts. Good thing too because it'd be kind of funny if their food sucked, given their name. Their spicy level ranges from 1 to 10 and I usually get a 2. I'm a wuss, I know! Service is excellent, quick to refill your drinks. The ladies that work here always seem to be in a pretty good mood.4 and 1/2 stars.

At each one we try, he always orders the same items to ensure that he is comparing them fairly: Tom kha gai soup, beef pad woon sen, Thai tea, and of it's available, a sticky rice dessert. After reading the reviews here before we left, my entree of choice was the chicken pad Thai. Somehow, prior to all that, we tried the fish cakes as our appetizer- they were great. Just the right amount of crispness, and the accompanying salad/sauce was amazing. I wouldn't mind having this as an entree in the future. According to bf, theyre not found too many places either.The Tom kha was new for me, and I ordered it based on the reviews here. I tried it and loved it, and it was so rich that I believed it to be cream based rather than coconut milk. Oddly though, I have tried it other places since and it tastes quite different elsewhere. Then again, at other places, there has been way too much ginger for my liking, so I think I'll just say that I prefer the version this restaurant puts out.By the time my pad Thai arrived. I really wasn't very hungry. It I will say that it is an enormous portion (but, as others have said, served with way too many bean sprouts) and it was quite tasty. The leftovers the next day were good, too.Bf's beef pad woon sen wasn't particularly remarkable. He ordered a high spice level, of 7 or 8, but even I found it downright bland- there was absolutely no spice whatsoever. I could tell he was quite disappointed. The dessert was a new thing for me to try. The sticky rice and coconut ice cream was tastier than I expected, but I don't know if I would have it again necessarily. In short, tasty place to go and we will be back."], ["Beth F.", "Oh my dear Thai Restaurant. I will always come back to you...I keep searching all over Austin and San Antonio for the best Pad Thai, and you just may be it.

I noticed as I was eating a few things have changed...back in 2008 they upped their lunch special price from $5.50 (entree, soup and ice tea) to $6 and no ice tea. I see now, after being gone for awhile that the lunch special is now $7.50 with no ice tea. Another change I noticed was they have now started cooking the bean sprouts in with the noodles as well as putting them on the side with crushed peanuts. I'm not sure if this in efforts to save money or to have the beans act as a filler but they hadn't done that before.My favorite part of the meal is the spring roll that comes with the meal. It is always super crispy, delicious, a little sweet and savory all at the same time.

This was my very first visit here. I had high hopes for this place as I've been to several other Thai restaurants in town.First ImpressionI was surprised when I first walked in that I was not greeted with the traditional Thai welcome, or at all for that matter. After standing awhile at the counter located in the back of the establishment, did I realize that you could seat-yourself. And after finding a table, it took ten minutes until I was approached. The woman who served me and my friend was very nice. The FoodI ordered #50, a clear noodle dish while my friend ordered a beef broccoli entree and shrimp spring rolls for an appetizer. When the \"spring rolls\" were brought to our table, we were quite surprised. They did not resemble the well-known egg roll-type of finger food we assumed this dish was. Instead, it was an ill-fated wonton wrapper folded in a triangle deeply saturated in frying oil. It looked like there was nothing inside. (See photo) After inspection, these \"spring rolls\" did have a small tiny shrimp inside, not even half an inch - that was it; no veggies or cream cheese to accompany the lonesome shrimp. \u00a0Both entrees were bland to taste, not full of flavor Thai cuisine is known for. My food was dominated by cabbage and lacked the clear noodles I was looking forward to. I had asked for mild-hot spiciness but there was no kick to the dish at all. There we pockets of saltiness indicating that the food was not blended well.ServiceOur food came out promptly. However, after we were served, we saw very little of our waitress. We were never approached for refills or anything else for that matter except to clear plates.AmbianceThe place was clean and roomy with traditional Thai decor. There was a small television in the corner with restaurant family members watching a golf tournament. I recall hearing nice traditional Asian music playing in the background. However, at a certain point the music from the cocktail bar next door became quite loud preventing making it difficult to carry on a conversation. And later on, the Asian music switched to music box-sounding horror.Last ImpressionOn the way out, I had overheard a man tell his company, \"If we don't get service in two minutes, we're leaving.\" I'm sure I most likely will not return to this restaurant."], ["Jeffrey G.", "If you can get past the fact that whomever named this restaurant displayed a total lack of imagination in choosing a name, you are in for a treat.

Plenty of food for the price. Servers were very sweet and attentive. Dinner menu is a bit pricey, but large portions make up for the increase in price. If you're a Thai food lover like myself then I highly recommend this place."], ["Kim W.", "I came here with a cold and my waitress immediately brought me soup, tea with honey and lemon, and is totally pampering me.

The service was excellent and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I started with the Thai tea, which was pure heaven, the eggrolls, which were crispy, fresh and full of goodness. I'm picky about my pad Thai because I've had it at so many different places across the US and most times it's been mediocre. Thai Basil's pad Thai was great! I loved it. It had the right flavor and the right look. Sometimes at other places it comes looking light brown and tasting like soy sauce. Just fyi it's not supposed to taste like that. I liked Thai Basil. I'll definitely go back. You must check it out!"], ["Haley K.", "This place is amazing!!! Quick service with friendly staff. The prices are awesome! Especially the lunch specials.

I figured for nearly $13 it should be pretty spectacular. Well, it certainly had volume on its side but I found the lack of SE Asian flavor lacking. Additionally, the entire dish only had 2 shrimp... The dish also contained some chicken and beef.The lady in charge when I went in was very courteous - after ordering she offered me water in a to-go cup.

I had Sushi Zushi first, then Jasmine Thai, then Sichuan House. Of the three meals, I enjoyed Jasmine Thai the most. I ordered Pad Ka Tiem off the dinner menu. Though I wanted it as spicy as the restaurant offered it, the restaurant staff advised me to try one level below the spiciest available, claiming the food would be really hot otherwise. As an alternative, they offered to include extra chili flakes on the side, so I could make it more spicy. That seemed like a swell idea, though before even tasting my food I instinctively threw all the chili flakes atop, knowing disappointment in previous instances with other restaurants. Call it courageous or what you will, but I'll call it instinct and good instinct at that. Turns out I was right on, as those chili flakes brought the spice-level to what I wanted: tolerable heat with a kick to the senses. To top off my happiness from getting the desired level of spice, the food itself was great. Prepared fresh with quality ingredients, both veggies and chicken. The spring rolls that came with the meal were tasty with the spicy dipping sauce versus the traditional sweet and sour. In the end, I found myself thinking about my meal after it was over, literally trying to make plans with a friend the very next day just to try more off the menu. It's rare when a restaurant gets in my head like that, and if anything, let that be your cue to check this place out if you haven't yet!

It was okay. Not the best, but okay. It had chicken, rice, bits of garlic, and basil. Good appetizer. I think it would be better if they brought out the egg rolls with the soup.I ordered the Ka Pow beef. (See picture) it came out very quickly. The presentation was great. It literally made me say, \"Wow!\" The beef was a little tough. You might want to get the chicken if you order this.It was very spicy which is perfect for me. And the sauce is to die for! I ate all of it with my steamed rice. It also had onions, bamboo shoots, and basil. YUM!They don't come over too much to bother you. Again, perfect for me. But my water glass was never empty. I wasn't sure if I needed to get up and pay or if they come to your table, so I went up to the counter to pay.Overall, great restaurant. If you're looking for atmosphere, this is NOT the place.

I ordered the Pad Thai lunch special, which actually doesn't come with the fried rice. You'll learn that when you order (doesn't state on the menu). However, it's nothing to cry about because the fried rice is terrible (co-worker's dish came with it). Flavor and more soy sauce is definitely needed. The Pad Thai is pretty good though. It's not overly greasy and is the right portion for lunch.I ordered the Tom Yum soup for an upcharge, although the hot and sour soup (soup of the day on the Tuesday we went) was pretty good. The Tom Yum soup was disappointing. There was lots of lemongrass flavor but no spice. I also would've preferred more broth (as opposed to lots of vegetables), but maybe that's just me. I also ordered an avocado smoothie with tapioca balls. Skip this. The smoothie was a light gray color, and I didn't taste any avocado, just the ice cream. In Houston at the bubble tea shops, you can usually watch the staff scoop fresh avocado right into the blender, but obviously the smoothie at this place was not the case. The smoothie, soup, Pad Thai, 15% tip, and tax was about $15.Service was good, which is why I gave three stars. A lady a couple of tables over left the table with her purse and walked out with a friend. The staff immediately began cleaning.

I have been trying like mad to find a decent Tom Yum in Texas (my meal of choice for hangovers, sinus infections and general winter malaise) and this is my favorite so far!They also have a very yummy iced jasmine tea that you'll either love or hate--it definitely has a heavier floral taste compared to most jasmine tea.

This was truly 5-star Thai food in a 2-star looking place! The restaurant itself didn't look bad, but the strip shopping center looked suspect!The restaurant was clean and the staff/owners were friendly. I was the only customer when I arrived (it was a weekday around 3pm) but over time a few other tables arrived too... including at least one regular. I liked to see the staff/owners greet everyone sincerely and really appreciate everyone's business. The lunch menu and specials are a fantastic price!

I got it with shrimp and squid, which wasn't even an option but I know they had both shrimp and squid so why not? I think it ended up being a ~$2 up charge which is reasonable, but I honestly didn't feel the effects of the price increase given the overall inexpensive cost. The soup was chicken and rice in a rather clear broth. It didn't sound or look very interesting but I tried it anyway. It was a tad over-salted but it still tasted pretty good. The egg rolls were mini sized and tasty as well. The entree portion wasn't a smaller lunch sized amount either... they gave a full sized plate of food. The sauce was different from what I expected but when I tasted it, man, I was pleasantly surprised. It was really, really good. The only thing I would ding them on food-wise is the slight saltiness of the soup and the sweetness of the Thai tea. Don't get me wrong I still ate all of my food and drank all of my tea, but the Thai tea especially was WAY too sweet. I almost asked them to water it down somehow but instead I just took small sips in between delicious bites of food and I got over it. LOL.

The sauce tasted off. It was more of a pad see ew sauce, but I'm not sure I could even call it that. It tasted more chinese with added MSG. It was similar to the sauce you'd use for moo goo gai pan, basically chicken broth based. Usually authentic drunken noodles are deeper brown in color because a black soy sauce is what should be used. This was not the case here. The proportions were also off. Too much veggies and chicken, not enough noodles. It was also not spicy at all even though I asked for hot. The chicken wasn't the greatest either. A little bit of gristle and a bit rubbery.Tofu Fresh Spring rolls: 2.5/5. I'm sure it's pretty hard to mess this up anyways. The spring rolls were overstuffed and the ingredients just broke through the rice cellophane, so half of the ingredients just fell out the wrapper. The peanut sauce wasn't that great either, below average. They didn't put any peanuts in the sauce (maybe because it was takeout??). It didn't taste very peanuty and it looked like they maybe put ketchup in it. However, the tofu was cooked well and the ingredients seemed fresh.Prices: On the higher end for thai food.

We ordered fried tofu as an appetizer. The fried tofu fell short of my expectations. The tofu was crisp on the outside but mushy and watery on the inside. Another down side, the tofu wasn't absorbing the flavors of the sweet and tangy sauce that accompanied the dish. Tofu tends to borrow it's flavor from its companions. I ordered the Masaman curry with vegetables and my friend ordered the Green curry with vegetables and tofu. I had a first taste of the curry sauce. The predominant flavor on the curry was it's coconut milk, I could barely taste the curry spices. The curry sauce was bland. The vegetable mix was lacking with only some cauliflower, carrots, other greens and NO AVOCADO. Who makes Masaman curry with NO AVOCADO? My least favorite ingredient in the curry, the cauliflower. Justdidnt seemed or taste fresh. My curry was so bland I had to add some chilli paste to give it a little flavor. I tasted the green curry sauce from my friends dish. It was better than the Masaman curry sauce but he also had \u00a0to add some chilli paste for flavor. We frequent a lot of Thai restaurants in San Antonio and we had never had to put in chilli paste in our curries for flavor.The ambience was Thai typical. Random tunes playing in the background and charming Thai atmosphere. The place has a good vibe on the inside and it is aesthetically pleasing. The service was unmemorable, \u00a0but not bad.

The veggies in the dish were mouth watering too. I think you have the option to choose curry for your duck as well but I love my Thai sauce. The duck does have bones in it so they give you a knife to cut the meat. The portion is on the small side but for the price I can't complain. The lunch special also comes with a tiny soup and an eggroll. Overall my experience at Yaya's was excellent. I really didn't expect it to be that good.

Of course, the restaurant was nearly empty but the server lady was on top of her charge of tables, however few.Here's my reasoning for the 3 stars - the flavor of the sauce was good but there simply was too much soupy sauce nearly floating an entire plate of vegetables and shrimp. The shrimp were small and reasonably tasty but not that fresh. I asked for medium and it was definitely very medium - perhaps it could be a bit spicier. I get the sense that the Thai food here is \"gringo\" style meaning tuned to the typical American palate. The amount of rice served in a side bowl was pretty small even though the server said they provide all the sauce for the rice. The vegetables were also a bit overcooked.I don't come often enough to San Antonio so I probably won't be back to this place anytime soon but as the server mentioned to me at the end, don't be afraid to ask them to dial back the quantity of sauce and make it a drier style if that's your thing and dial up the flavor a bit."], ["Sam C.", "Business trip here and spotted this place in Yelp. \u00a0Had Thai Ice Tea, soup of the day: hot and sour soup, and Crispy Duck Special. \u00a0All are excellent. \u00a0Will come again next time I am in town."], ["Kim C.", "I should have just gone with the Tom Kha Soup wjocj was delicious.

One day, the bf and his friends got a thai craving so we met up at this place for an early dinner.

But hey, it's a restaurant, not a design studio. But on that note, considering it was dinner time, there were hardly any customers. On a positive note, this meant our orders came out quick. But on a more realistic note, this place is no longer new and yet they still keep putting up new banners to attract in customers. The medical center folk love their thai, so if this place is still struggling to get people in, it's probably a food issue. I kept this in mind while hoping I was wrong as we placed our order.As I suspected, the food was our issue.We shared an order of the Tom Kha soup- two pieces of chicken in our undersized and overpriced \"shareable bowl\". The pad see ew was tasty, and the plate was cleaned, but that's because the three of us were eating my boyfriend's order. His friend ordered some kind of chicken breast dish that was overpriced, small, and bland. It seemed to be the smallest chicken breast in a value pack, covered with a sparse sprinkling of plain breadcrumbs, and plated with a side of undercooked veggies. This was as unappealing as diet food can possibly get. And it didn't seem to be intentional. I don't know if the chef fell asleep, or if the server prepared it herself and doesn't have tastebuds, but this dish should be removed from the menu completely due to is lack of noteworthiness.I ordered a vermicelli bowl- \u00a0the flavor was bland, accompanying spring roll was a puny, dismal undercooked veggies-not at all comparable to the other location!Other than the pad see ew and tom kah, the dishes we ordered appeared to be haphazardly thrown together and had virtually no flavor. And again, it's important to note that this place seemed way overpriced- granted I used a Groupon at the other location, but given the portion sizes, crappy food, and lack of ambiance in this restaurant, I can't imagine how this place is still open. It's overpriced for thai to start with, but I could overlook it for quality- which I failed to find here. \u00a0Stick to the other location!"], ["Aja V.", "Good food. Nice atmosphere. Decent service.

A wet, saucy pad thai is a sign that it was cooked too fast. A dry pad thai is good because it means that the sauce was cooked into the noodles, but then you don't want it too dry. \u00a0This is tough to balance, even for a gymnast, but Yaya's delivers and even McKayla Maroney would be impressed.The owner and staff are very friendly and considerate. They'll make boba for you if it's not too busy, otherwise they won't have it available. \u00a0My fiance is a boba snob being from California and she actually said the Taro Boba was great.A couple other dishes I've tried:- Red Curry: perfect thickness and rich flavor.

You were better this time after I specified I really want it spicy and you did a good job. But then with more friends I came back singing your praises only to be let down. The thai tea and jasmine tea were horrible and had a weird taste and the pad thai was flavorless. But you are so close to whereI live, so one last time I tried because I remembered when you were good and I know you can be good...but this was the worst of them all. Instead of a beef fried rice I received combination, instead of tender juicy beef it all tasted of slimy fat and the chicken was just rubbery. And another bland pad thai with no spice like I asked for. I think I've given Yayas enough times to wow me. The only dish that has been consistently good is the Basil fried rice and the pad thai, green curry, spicy pepper, miso, are poor excuses for restaurant quality thai.

I was hoping the Chiangmai noodles would be similar to Khao Soi, which is from that region. No such luck. Sue waited on us and she didn't recognize the name. When I said it's supposed to be from Chiang Mai, she said, \"Supposedly\" in a light sarcastic tone. Not offensive but I've done my homework and khao Soi does come from that area. Maybe I'm reading them wrong. ::shrug::The beers were excellent! Chang & Singha were lagers with a hint of tartness, which I loved but the wife did not. Don't get me wrong! She drank hers and ordered a second but she wasn't a fan of the tart hint. :OThe hot & sour soup ... Not a fan. It was spicy hot but no sour to be found. I took 2 sips and wife took 1 sip. We pushed it aside. Sue was waiting on us and she inquired about the soup. I explained I didn't care for it and she took it away. The chicken satay was excellent! Great flavor and the chicken was tender & moist. The wife loved it!Now for the entrees:Their Padd Thai comes with chicken, fried tofu, and shrimp with bean sprouts and crushed peanuts on the side of the plate. Wife ordered it medium spicy and it was. Enough to get her sniffles. Taste lacked something to me but she enjoyed it. The Chiang Mai noodles were received with mixed reviews. Wife loved them; I was underwhelmed. I ordered medium heat with chicken as protein. The chicken was good. The spice was zero. The dish had a variety of greens on the side of the bowl, topped with crispy noodles. I had to dig to find the other noodles that were in the very bottom. 1) Not sure what the greens were but is a yelper recognizes then please feel free to message me. I liked them. 2) I liked the chicken. 3) It needed A LOT more noodles to be a noodle dish. My bowl was swimming in the saucy gravy. Description didn't read like a soup, although my khow soy/khao soi is a soup. 4) It was not spicy AT ALL. Zero. Nada. Zilch. 5) \u00a0The sauce was much too sweet and plentiful. I tried to make it less sweet and more enjoyable by adding soy sauce, fish sauce, and a scoop from 2 different chili pots on the table. Only helped a little. After each addition I would stir it and taste and then add something else. By now the wife was getting worried that I was going to make it inedible and she wanted the leftovers, so I stopped experimenting. 6) I will make a small batch of noodles at home to add to this sauce. Maybe add a few items from my pantry. Or maybe I'll just give to the wife. She liked it. :/Overall, nice older restaurant & nice older Asian lady waiting in us. Very nice and attentive. Owner? Manager? Not sure. The koi pond out front is empty. Drained with caution tape surrounding it. Large aquarium inside is empty except rocks & gravel. Some nice first ions and umbrellas under lights to dim the brightness. Poor sushi chef had no orders and nothing to do. He stood to side to watch FIFA series.

I always get mango but if you don't like fruity, the chai tea is delicious as well! If you have a large party, call ahead. It can get busy here so it's a wise choice so you won't be waiting long. :)"], ["Reilly E.", "The food was excellent here tonight.

Is suppose to have a strong basil flavor with mild heat and hint of lime? Either way, I cleaned my plate. We also got the spring rolls, where were nice a crunchy. I love spring rolls, they have secured the number one spot in appetizers for me. My friend got the Chicken Pa-Nang.

I've also been quite impressed with the service. I haven't gotten around to trying their sushi and bubble tea, but it all has to be good if THIS many people are talking about it, right?We've usually come here on weekends; even though the parking lot usually seems full, we're always able to find a couple of spots open. The restaurant has never been full enough to where we have to wait for a table, but it's usually always a good amount of packed. There are two rooms in which you can be seated, though the back room seems like more of an extension to the restaurant and you're seated there when the main room is packed.

It's not one of those places where you're like, \"Oh yeah, I like spicy food,\" and you get a dish that's not spicy. You definitely get the right amount of spicy and I love that!We've always had wonderful service here, as well. I even remember speaking with one of the servers to get Zain B. one of their authentic Thai shirts and even when they didn't have one around at the time, our server, Boom, gave me a call a few days later saying they were able to find what I wanted.

First impression - finally, an Asian place with decor from a decade later than the 70s! It did have that sushi bar smell when you walk in, which I never find pleasant, but that was only at the entry. At our table, you could only smell the kitchen which was pleasant. We ended up with a table next to the window and could see the pretty garden and pond outside, complete - unfortunately - with to-go cups littering the ground. But overall, the dining room was nice.Our server was not the greatest. He rushed us on our drink order, never told us the specials (I saw them on the board on the way in, but my wife didn't), and just rubbed me the wrong way. Observing other servers, we evidently drew the short straw.The menu is smaller than some of the Thai places we've tried. We appreciated that, as reading through 40 types of curry is tedious, especially when the only difference is this one has palm hearts and this one has bell peppers. Most of the dishes on Tong's menu are very distinct.We settled on the white spring rolls - a little chewy but fresh and light; the kang ped - delicious with the right amount of heat; and the grilled combo - perfectly cooked shrimp and chicken with a lightly sweet sauce. Dinner was excellent. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh.Back to the service - food was delivered very quickly. We had our spring rolls before we decided on the rest of the meal. But then after we were done eating, we had to wait longer for the check than we did for any portion of the meal. Some of the reviews are complaining about the price. We thought it was reasonably priced, less than some places we tried and didn't like as much.

They do well with the space they have. Not great, but it works. Ambiance? It's cute and definitely themed. The menu is an eclectic Asian tour. I went with a group of 12 guys and everyone said every dish they'd had before was delicious. I quite enjoyed my food. The tea tasted fresh, and strong. The service from the back waiter was excellent. After our waiter had mixed up and had to get us fresh teas (my neighbor unsweet to my sweet), the back waiter kept our glasses full. A gentleman I presume to be the chef by his double-breasted jacket also assisted in keeping us well hydrated. The main server left a lot to be desired. Our group was missing one individual and several of us made it clear we weren't wanting to wait to order, as #12 was delayed and would order upon unknown arrival time. But we were made to wait by the server for both our appetizer round and our entree round. I'm of the industry and have waited my share of tables both fine and casual, and even trained others. I am more than understanding when a place is slammed and often encourage my fellow patrons to exercise patience if they get feisty. But it was a slow Thursday night by my measure (less than \u00a0of the restaurant full at any time) and by my count he had our 12-top and 2 smaller tables total. Our dining experience should not have lasted more than an hour and change. We were there nearly two. Thank goodness for good company. I am fully aware that tips are what servers live on, and that tipping out back-waiters, bartenders, and hosts/hostesses are necessary. I appreciate that the POS system is set up to show the gratuity percentages based upon my exact bill, on my printed bill. I also understand the tax laws have changed regarding auto gratuity for tables. I appreciate and understand when Aloha, Micros (yes, I intimately understand both POS systems from a kitchen, server, and programming stance). \u00a0CLEARLY it was not an auto gratuity, as the tip and total was filled out for me by the waiter in pen for every check brought to our table on both the bill AND the credit card receipts. I don't recall seeing that parties of x or more with split checks will have an auto ***20%*** added to their bill in pen by the waiter. I understand 15%-18% (industry standard). That's an aggressive, ballsy move for a job half-assed done. I often tip 25%+ for average service. It used to be my livelihood, so I get it. I'd probably have rounded up from the 20% to make it a clean number even with lousy service. But with that sort of a move? If I'd not been with friends and attempting to have a great time, I'd probably have made a scene. I don't know if the managers/owners are aware that this low level of customer service is occurring in their restaurant. Back waiters and chefs should never outshine a server. Servers are the customers' liaison to the restaurant for a stellar experience. Ambiance, food, and everyone else there? Great. But the waiter? Cost you 2 stars on this review.

It was my first time and did not know what flavors they had. When I asked for the menu, she tells me that the menu is 'outside' and they have 40+ kinds. So if I want to see the menu, she told me to go outside to look. I would think about it during day time, but it was really cold outside and dark. How rude is that? Can't she even tell me several kinds for me to get an idea or give me recommendations!? Since I did not want to ruin my day, I ordered same flavor as my accompany did. But starting from the entrance to paying, she did not smile or being polite all the way through.

We clarified to her two times - when we ordered/paid and when she came to clarify the order. I still do not know if she did not know for real or she did it intentionally. Who knows, but only she does. If that elder lady reads this, I want to you realize. Think about it the other way around. If you were treated how I was treated, would you go back to that restaurant? \u00a0Going to restaurants are not all about FOOD or TASTE. Cleanness, Service, Time, and other related elements also matters. Even though food is good, but eating/getting food there with uncomfortableness...is that a good restaurant?

It can get pretty steep without you realizing.I usually get the pad thai, but it isn't my favorite, so I tried to get sweet and sour tofu. They couldn't do that. Orange tofu, nope. Has to be chicken. This was very frustrating because I can pay half the price and order from a delivery service and get tofu with anything on the menu. I had to order the fried tofu wedge appetizer dish and then add a bowl of rice. So much food and you can see where the price gets steep.Love the atmosphere, and if you sit outside, it is very nice.

The fried egg rolls were good but our main dishes were worse than what you could find at an airport. The fried rice tasted as if the oil they used was old. The pad Thai wasn't spicy and came with one, cold shrimp, two green onion pieces, and chicken knuckles. The sweet and sour chicken is laughable with its horrible chicken parts and few pieces of pineapple and onion all served with a cup of sweet and sour sauce that came straight from the can. You're better served going to Panda Express and paying half what you'd spend here and get better food.

The sushi and sashimi are always fresh and delicious. Not all of their specialty rolls are listed on the menu so talk with the sushi chief and you'll be stirred in the right direction. Right now they have a Christmas roll. Fantastic! Worth a try before the holiday season ends. They offer nice sushi and sashimi plates with good variety and sizes for any size appetite. The white spring rolls are fantastic, great peanut dipping sauce. The Tom Kha Kai is a consistent winner, is served in a flaming hot pot and plenty to share. The Yam Wun Sen is a fantastic rice noodle based salad with chicken and shrimp and all brought together with fresh lime juice. Everything I have tried has been fantastic. They have an affordable lunch menu. A nice variety of bubble teas (I love the mango). They do take reservations from their website. A great place to Thai on on."], ["Katie C.", "This seems like it could become my go-to thai place, if only they had more gluten-free options.

When I first had pad thai here, it was more flavorful and potent in that Thai fish sauce way. I think they Americanized the recipe as it is not as flavorful anymore. Tastes more like the pad thai at thai topaz now which isn't authentic tasting. On top of that ordering on the phone was bit chaotic and the lady seemed frazzled.

It kind of hurts me a bit to know that the San Antonio suburban food landscape doesn't merit separate sushi and Thai restaurants. I visited for lunch and ordered the vegetable roll, the fried tofu appetizer, and the red curry with tofu off the lunch menu. The vegetable roll was just not very good. If you look at the photo, you can see steamed broccoli as a filling. The red curry was pretty disappointing. It was kind of watery..maybe more curry paste would have helped? The curry comes with red and green bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and green beans. Green beans just don't absorb the curry - It would probably taste better if it were carrots or broccoli. I also ordered it spicy, and it was quite mild. The lone bright spot here was the fried tofu. The fried tofu had an excellent, crispy texture, and came with a savory peanut sauce. The fried tofu appetizer was better than the tofu in the red curry. The service here was very kind. The lady seating folks was very quick, and accommodating. She and another server sounded a bit sick, which made me feel strange. On one hand, she has to work through being sick, which always sucks. On the other hand, coughing while serving food doesn't look good to patrons!If I return, I'll definitely try an noodle dish."], ["Krysta G.", "Why is this place so delicious? It had been way too long since we had last visited so we stopped by this past weekend to get my Pad Thai (and his Fried Rice) fix.

Not ONCE has my water glass ever emptied completely, and my food always comes out steaming hot-hot-hot. My only complaint (which I hate to even say since I love this place oh-so-much) was the bubble tea. I just can't recommend it. It looks delicious (pictures attached), and it tastes like they use fresh fruit, but they just don't have the consistency down. It reminded me a bit like a slushy when bubble tea's are usually more of a smoothie consistency. However, I feel that everything else makes up for the sadly disappointing bubble tea.

I didn't particularly like their drunken noodles (the noodles were overcooked and cut into little tiny pieces) and I do not care for iceberg lettuce with my lettuce wraps. While the chicken and sauce were very tasty, I would have preferred Bibb lettuce like when I prepare lettuce wraps at home. All in all, I would say that we will be back to try a few more dishes.

So, if I eat there, I have all the sauces at my disposal, yet when I get takeout, I'm supposed to pay for these sauces? That, too, 50 cents? No. We stopped asking for the sauces, and literally went out to HEB and bought our own.Then, there's the service. I don't like the attitude I receive when I ask for hot sauce. Tonight, we ordered 3 dishes - once we took the food home, we saw that one of the dishes were wrong and I gave them a call. Oh, and the sauce from the dish was literally all over the plastic bag (and we had held the bag in the upright position the entire time). I called, explained to the lady on the phone exactly what had happened. She paused, then asked me what I had ordered and asked if I wanted to bring it by so they could correct it - yes, of course I want to bring it by. Once we took it back, the manager and the girl were discussing back-and-forth whose mistake if was. It's fine if they'd like to get to the bottom of that, but I don't think it's necessary to do that in front of their customer. So, no.Then, the food. The taste has definitely changed. Our fried rice tonight was full of oil, and though we asked for a level 4 spiciness level, the food tasted oily and bland. The pad thai was literally plain noodles with some vegetables - not good.I don't think we'll return on our own will, at least for a while.

But Thai Bistro & Sushi sure does know both Thai and Sushi. I ordered my favorite eel roll and pad see ew with pork. I really enjoyed my eel roll, it was delicious. I liked the fact that they made their pad see ew with Chinese broccoli instead of the American kind. Chinese broccolis are more expensive and taste so much better!! The sauce they used was spot on. I did, however, have problems with the pork. It was for whatever reason hard to chew and tasteless. So I talked to my server about it and she gladly took it back and changed it to tofu. This time was so much better and just what I was looking for. My dishes also came with complimentary hot and sour soup which was a plus. The price is on the higher side though. I am not sure why but they seem to like having Thai grandmas as their servers. I do like Asian grandmas as long as they are nice and don't stab me with chopsticks. Also ambiance wasn't too shabby and it is right across the street from my dry cleaner. I am pretty sure this won't be my last visit!

I think it was $8.95 for the dinner menu price - so not too bad for Thai food. I think I would have given this place 4 stars if it weren't for my ordering their strawberry boba. That's where the disappointment began: it was clearly a powdered mix. Since I normally get my boba in Houston, I was expecting fresh fruit to be blended in. At $4.95+tax a cup, it really should be real fruit, considering I can get a bigger, fruitier version in Houston for 3.25 after taxes. \u00a0It's highway robbery here for what you pay and what you get.It was because of the drink that I'm knocking off a star for Thai Bistro. \u00a0So I guess the moral of the story here is to stick to the food and stay away from the boba."], ["Joe A.", "This place is really really great.

Their golden puffs are filled to the brim with that delicious creamy filling. Our server has been the same gentleman both times and he is truly a delight. Always courteous, fast, polite, and attentive. My glass of ice water never went below the half-way mark. Oh and who could forget, BUBBLE TEA!!! I like to mix it up and get pineapple/mango.

I think I am ready now to warn you that this place is quite possibly the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in and also experienced the absolute worst service in my life.I ordered my usual benchmark Thai dish: beef with green curry. It was barely edible. There were frozen peas and carrots on it. I don't know if the vegetable combo was on sale, but the various had no place in this dish and have the food a really of putting aroma. To make matters worse the rice had the consistency of mashed potatoes. I've eaten at countless Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, etc etc restaurants where PLAIN white rice is served, and in no way had it ever been in this state. How do you mess up rice? I sent it back not one, not twice, but THREE times only to be informed by a KOREAN lady that the rice spoon wad on hot water and caused the rice to turn into putty. They did not offer to make another meal or comp me a drink, nothing. Maybe the pad Thai is decent, but I think all the other reviews must either be shills or they just don't know good Thai food. There was no way I was going to eat that nasty food. So I paid and left."], ["Jessica C.", "The food was cold, our appetizer never came. And \u00a0I asked for my food spicy and it wasn't.

The smoked flavor & Thai spices enhanced the flavors of my dish. The lunch portion includes a small bowl of soup, rice & fried spring roll. I ordered the coconut ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was good, but I expected a larger scoop for $2.99. The \"pay at the front counter\" concept, takes away from the better dining feel.

It's edible but not savory like I expected. 1/4 remains in my bowl.My main dish of red curry arrives and it seems to be as it should. Nothing looks disconcerting as the presentation is clean. Surprisingly this dish is much more appetizing. The spice is not overwhelming and the chicken is tender. I am used to curry being a slightly thinner sauce and must admit I like this thicker version.

As usual the food did not disappoint. My mother and I both got the Pad Woonsen she got a spicy level #3 and I got a spicy level #4. The highest spice they go up to is 5. I love their version of this dish because it is so colorful and full of veggies, such as: baby corn, cabbage, mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, and lotsss of onion. We also got the fried cheese rolls as an appetizer (which I had never had) and absolutely loved them. They were very tiny but the dish came with quite a few (enough to share between two) and the plum sauce it came with perfectly complimented it.What prevents me from giving this place 4 stars is the customer service.

I would have probably eaten more of my meals at Sawasdee, but I had to also check-out what else San Antonio had to offer in terms of amazing food. I was in San Antonio only for a week, but I tried to order a variety of dishes. On the whole, most of the dishes were flavorful and made to order, spice-wise. The Bangkok Wings were good (as an appetizer); the Tom Kha Talay (seafood in coconut milk) was really good- and because I asked for it that way, very spicy! I also had the Sawasdee BBQ Chicken, which I thought was on the sweet side, but still tasty. The Hoy Malang Phu Oph (mussels in a clay pot) was deee-li-cious, and the crab fried rice - for crab fried rice in a Thai restaurant - was memorable. The menu listed Pad Gratiem Prik Thai (garlic and black pepper stir fry) for anyone who loves garlic - and I do! -- but I didn't think it was as \"garlicky\" as advertised. The only dessert I ordered during my multiple visits was the mango with sticky rice, which I found only so-so. Mango with sticky rice was never a favorite for me, and Sawasdee's version did not change my mind (and heart) on the dish. I did very much enjoy the Thai iced coffee (after my meals).The service was always friendly and helpful; I dined alone for the most part, but I was never made to feel awkward or rushed. The restaurant is situated in a small mini-mall, and parking is available in the lot. The restaurant decor is clean and tastefully done -- and although it never seemed to be very busy or full during the hours I was there (for both lunches and dinners), there appeared to be a lot of a take-out/carry-out activity."], ["Andrea G.", "Let me start by saying this place was not that bad. Like my husband said, \"it's edible, but not again\" .. For our appetizer, we had the fresh rolls. They were cut into four, wrapped in saran, and served with their version of peanut sauce. The rolls themselves were good. Very fresh. The sauce on the other hand, not so much. It was watery and had only a hint of peanut taste . I like my sauce with a thicker consistency, one that holds onto the roll for dear life, not just a dip and drip.I had the pad Thai and my husband had the basil beef. I like my pad Thai with some juice in it so that the noodles don't stick together and there is still some flavor. Definitely the opposite. Noodles were dry, and there was NO leftover juice. Mayybe it's a matter a preference, but I like some juice dammit! Any who, the hubby said his dish was OK, but definitely not better than some other Thai places we've tried. It was bland and not much flavor. Very watery. \u00a0Can't say to much about the inside, we had it to go. Looks nice from the outside."], ["Laura D.", "Absolutely my favorite thai place in San Antonio. I come here almost every week! I am obsessed with their Tom Kha Gai (coconut chicken soup) with a side of rice mixed in. My girl friends and I get it every time. It is a tradition!

Everything came out too sweet, and not enough flavoring. Their spice levels are 1-5 and when I ordered a 3-4 on the spicy level, it came out non spicy...like it was not spicy at all, none of the dishes were close.

It's a little outdated but service was greaaaat! Our waitress was very helpful & friendly. Although they were near kitchen closing time, we were still able to squeeze in a some orders. - Thai Tea (3/5): Thai Tea is always good. This one doesn't really blow me away, but it was good. The best thing about this one is that they serve it in a HUGE glass cup. - Beef Pad Thai (3/5): Hm, pretty decent. The beef was tender. The noodles were a bit sweet/sour & slightly dry. I didn't really find myself coming back to this dish as often as their Pad See Ew. Another drawback was the portion size - they don't give you a lot. - Shrimp Pineapple Curry (4/5): One of the best curries I've ever had. It was sweet & creamy with a ton of spice to it. It's served in a pineapple, which added more flavor to it. I kept wanting more but without appearing greedy.. Sigh, the pineapple just wasn't big enough!!- Beef Pad See Ew (3/5): I always prefer this dish over Pad Thai. Maybe because I'm more into savory noodles than sweet/sour. The beef was just as tender, the veggies were cooked perfectly & so were the noodles. Everything was seasoned nicely. One drawback - portion size.- Sawasdee Fried Tilapia (2/5): My boyfriend's favorite dish at any Thai restaurant. I would normally dive in with him, but it wasn't all that here. A couple of dry bites & I was through. I did like the crispiness though!- Red Curry (4/5): Given that it does contain the same curry paste as the Shrimp Pineapple Curry, it isn't as sweet, of course, but it was just as flavorful. We chose chicken & that, too, was tender. After our dinner, my friend would not stop talking about it. Overall, it's a decent place. We would probably return again on our next trip to SA - most likely, it'll be for the curries :)"], ["Mark D.", "Passed this place so many times and never stopped..... sure glad we finally stopped.

We had the green curry with pork, sticky rice and the pad woonsen with shrimp. When we ordered the curry, the server asked, on a scale of one to five, how spicy we would you like it prepared. I said I would like it the way it is served in Thailand as we have no idea how that translates to on their \"heat\" scale. In a somewhat condescending manner, she inferred that Thai spicy was not meant to be served to mere Americans and said that we most likely only merited a three. After our assurance that we did indeed prefer our Thai food to be served as it would be in its country of origin, she agreed to allow us into the coveted circle of those allowed to indulge in Thai food prepared in the manner that it was meant to be.It's not that I want my Thai food stupid hot for the sake of being hot, but I feel that ethnic cuisine is best when prepared in a traditional manner. \u00a0I mean, if I didn't like spice, why would I be ordering curry in a Thai restaurant to begin with.The funny thing is, this \"Number Five\" curry was not that spicy. Certainly not to the point that customers need to be warned. \u00a0In fact, the curry was, oddly, very sweet. \u00a0I am not sure why there was such a hesitation to serve it Thai hot. \u00a0When I asked about the sweetness of the curry and if it was perhaps a regional style, our server told us that, no, that's just the way Americans like it. Apparently, the business model here is not to serve genuine Thai food, but to serve their version of \"Americanized\" Thai food.The pad woonsen was also good, but not great and a bit on the bland side. Sticky rice was par for the course.The place has a nice ambiance and, other than the \"curry\" comments, service was prompt and courteous."], ["Ashery G.", "Went here for lunch to kill some time before flying.

I ordered Pad kra pow and loved it. Came with rice and just enough for myself. I fell in love with their leaf style serving plates too. 3 style spice level was perfect for me.

About five minutes later my dish comes out. I've had this issue before normally and has several bite sized chunks of broccoli in it. Not this one and had four large florets that needed to be broken down to about three to five small pieces. Ridiculous. The broccoli was not cooked through and was still wrong. The noodles were warm...not nearly hot as they should be.

Again I ask for iced tea.One of the two waitresses walks by several times and then again I ask her for ice tea ( are we seeing a pattern here?)

It took the waitress about 10 minutes to finally come over to our table just to get our drink order and then another 10 minutes to bring the water. I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken as I usually do when visiting a Thai restaurant for the first time. The plate came with a thick, gelatinous vegetable soup. It was so think it was hard to swallow. When the meal finally came, the noodles were over cooked and had a very bland taste. There was also hardly any chicken in it. I usually always look forward to the spring roll, but when I bit into it, it was soggy rather than crispy. There was also nothing in it, but breading. The lunch portion also comes with a salad that consisted of a few pieces of iceberg lettuce and cut up carrots with green goddess dressing. It tasted as dull as it sounds. When we told the waitress about our experience, she apologized and said she would tell the manager. We never heard from anyone. \u00a0All in all, it was a major disappointment as I was really looking forward to satisfying my craving."], ["Martin G.", "Without fail, the food is delicious every time we eat here. \u00a0I've had various entr\u00e9es and appetizers, and the freshness of the food stays true to the authenticity of Thai food. The staff however should model their demeanor over the quality of their food. \u00a0Although you may experience the standard service requirements, it sometimes feel like your dealing more with staff at the DMV. The vibe does not feel very welcoming or personable. You may even get an irritated look of expression from the main server just short of an eye roll when inquiring about menu items."], ["Andy M.", "Mmmm so nice. Very good food. Extensive menu.

Definitely a must for all new to thai n veterans"], ["Lesley D.", "Really disappointed. I had the lunch special. Bland soup with a few vegetable chunks. Iceberg lettuce salad with carrots and honey mustard bottled dressing. The coconut curry had no heat to it and not very flavorful. The chicken tasted funny, sort of old or a bit off? Had onions a few potato and carrot chunks, very few peanuts, and canned pineapple chunks. \u00a0Definitely not the best in San Antonio. Try Asia Kitchen and Thai Chili. The food at both places is exponentially better."], ["Ruth W.", "Got takeout because we stopped in relatively close to closing time. Called ahead and they had it ready SUPER fast. Tried a bunch of their curries: red curry w beef, massaman curry w chicken, and yellow curry with chicken. The red curry was ok, not my favorite, but it was still quite good. I'm just not crazy about green peppers and this had quite a lot of those in there....however, the beef was really yummy and tender. Now! MASSAMAN & YELLOW CURRY. You can't go wrong with either of these. They were both REALLY yummy! I love massaman curry so much, and theirs was unique for me. It had pineapples in it which sounds a little strange, but it was SO good. I didn't expect them but they made the dish. My only \"complaint\" is that they put some peanuts in it, and for me I prefer cashews in my massaman (and i don't really like peanuts). The yellow curry was SO good and I would highly recommend their curries to anyone! They only have steamed white rice for the curries, and I really like to have brown rice, but whatever. Try them out!"], ["Nicolas G.", "went to this terrible place despite the abundance of negative reviews about service and lukewarm reviews about food quality. what was i greeted with? terrible service and mediocre food. sometimes i wonder what the people on yelp are willing to eat when i see glowing reviews for restaurants that are seriously lacking...walked in at 9:25 pm on a night when the restaurant closed at 10. now i admit, that's cutting it close. but for a two-top, that's plenty of time to get in a quick meal without overstepping boundaries. besides, the restaurant doesn't know my life. i'm not a camper who orders a meal and sticks around to see where the night will take me. i get in, i order, i get out; end of story.the girl at the front seats us without incident, but when the boy comes to take our order, he's impatient with my companion for needing another minute to decide.'the location is closing soon,' he says, looking at me petulantly while twirling his pen, implying that the ordering process here is as critical as the scene in raiders of the lost ark where indie must grab his hat quickly before the big gate closes upon his arm.so we order. promptly. as ordered by the rude boy's demeanor. the dishes come out quickly enough, but not the quality flavor. the pad se ewe i ordered may as well have been a dessert dish, as sweet as it was. i even asked for it to be a 4 out of 5 on the spice; it wasn't spicy at all. the flavor was probably attributed to whatever they may have put in my dish to 'punish' me for walking into a restaurant during its business hours, but not during a time its staff would have liked (let's just say i visited the bathroom way too many times after eating here).finished our uninspired meal and left by -- wouldn't you know? -- 10:05pm. my advice: try any other thai place in the city and be treated much better, pay a little less, get tastier dishes, and use less toilet paper."], ["John W.", "This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant, and I don't even live in San Antonio!

For entrees, our table ordered the roasted duck curry, crab fried rice, chicken pad thai and beef pad see ew! All very good, but the best entree hands down was the roasted duck curry, which came in a pineapple! BEST curry I've ever had! VERY delicious!

For $6 i expected the usual 4-6 thin rolls most places give you to taste good but lack when it comes to overall value. They do half size rolls that arestuffed with onion, cheese and crab to make every small bite amazing and flavorful. Best part is they give you like 20 of them totaling about 10 regular size rolls of what you get from other places. My companion and i agreed we would come back just for this appetizer alone.But no need to fear, the food was amazing as well! My yellow curry ($10) was mildly sweet with a large amount of all the promised ingredients. Im use to most places that give you more curry sauce than veggies so it was pleasant surprise and oh my did they hit the spot. I would recommend this place to go since the curry is so good you actually wait to eat so your ingredients can soak up the flavor a bit more!The rice was good plain white rice as expected so nothing amazing but it wasnt overly oiled and i appreciated the freshness it had. The service was okay but i was so impressed by the food and flavor i had almost not time for let downs until the end of our meal when we waited for someone to notice us again. Seems once they give you to go boxes and a check they dont expect you might want dessert.

I usually get a 4, but a 4 is not always the same level (sometimes it's crazy hot, other times I can barely feel any fire). 2 - they close mid-day, and we have been rushed out a few times during late lunches, or been made to feel like we were holding them up (sorry!!).Overall, I love it.

Their spice levels are a bit spicier than the other Thai restaurants around town, so I would recommend ordering 1 level down from what you would usually order."], ["Jessica L.", "This is one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Definitely worth a stop and absolutely delicious. You will not regret anything on the menu"], ["Kay M.", "If you love Thai food as much as I do, come to Bangkok 54. \u00a0I ordered the Pad Won Sen with tofu and it was just great!It started with small cup of very flavorful soup and then they brought the entree along with a delicious springroll. \u00a0I couldn't believe how much food was on the plate and every bite was delicious! \u00a0My friend had the chicken pad thai and she really enjoyed it.We will definitely come again."], ["Travis S.", "This is Thai Food! LOVE this place. Always consistent, fresh ingredients, home grown herbs, family run. Prices are reasonable for the quality and better than some of the competition. Tom Yum soup is my favorite item followed by Pad Thai and Pad Wun Sen. Sweet and sour pork is very good as well. Support this amazing small business!"], ["Desirae M.", "Absolutely delicious food however, it takes a while to get to you. We had 8 in out party, every single bite of each other's food was fantastic but two friends didn't receive their meals until at least thirty minutes after everybody else. The wait staff was reminded three times and one even received her to go order in under three minutes, but she still didn't have her dinner entree. I would definitely go back and give them another chance because that food was amazing!!"], ["Ken S.", "A hidden gem. \u00a0This is real Thai on a level that most San Antonio Thai restaurants cannot come close to. The panang curry is out of this world. Lad Nar is transcendent. I can't speak highly enough for this fantastic cuisine."], ["Kathy S.", "I belive this is the best Thai food place I've been to so far and I'm from flushing, NY a predominantly Asian area ...I had the basil beef and the chicken tom Yom Soup! Everything was so flavorful and delicious! The staff is great! I love how they accommodate your spice level! I love spicy and I wouldn't dare to go past 4! very clean !

Also had the lovers appetizer. They were delicious."], ["Arlene G.", "Went here with my mother while we were in town visiting. The food was solid; it was tasty, hot and fresh.

Service was great! And overall reasonably priced! I ordered the chicken pad tai! -two thumbs up, it was jammin on the 10( really good)!"], ["Ann J.", "Really disappointed-the chicken pad Thai tasted like old peanut oil. \u00a0Chicken Tom Yum soup was mostly broth and did not have the fresh flavors or spice that I've had in other Thai restaurants. \u00a0Not sure why they're getting such stellar reviews."], ["Ava B.", "BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN SAN ANTONIO, and maybe anywhere else in Texas too. Everything is amazing. The service is always great; the people are nice and the food comes out quick and fresh. The Pad See Eew or the Thai Fried Rice are my favorite. All of their curries are great as well. MUST GO. You'll be addicted."], ["Erin B.", "This was my second visit to Bangkok 57 for lunch this time and the place was packed!!! I had the red curry last time and it was great. Tried the chicken green curry with a 3-spice level \"the American hot\" the waiter said :-). It was so good I couldn't stop eating it! The spice level was just right. It came with a little Thai egg roll that was cooked perfectly. Also a nice Thai cabbage soup. If you are looking for authentic Thai at good prices - this is the place!"], ["Jessica R.", "I ordered to go here. This is an awesome restaurant with amazing customer service. The food was absolutely remarkable. They put quality over quantity. \u00a0I couldn't be more happy. I look forward to being able to sit and enjoy the dining experience.

Yummy yummy!!!"], ["Theresa J.", "Exquisite. \u00a0Everything I have tried has been impeccable. \u00a0I am especially fond of the Tom Yum soup and the curries. \u00a0Pad Thai is straightforward. \u00a0My sister had the jumbo shrimp and scallop curry and thoroughly enjoyed it. \u00a0The service is very accommodating and friendly."], ["Nadeen L.", "Very friendly people and the food is authentic. \u00a0Be careful how spicy you order. \u00a0I ordered #4 level of spice and it was REALLY spicy!

They welcomed and made us fresh food still. Now the tast...so very flavorful...it was soooo delicious. Service was excellent. I will for sure return."], ["Michael C.", "I don't think there is a better Thai restaurant in town! Luckily it's about 2 miles north from my house which is near N. New Braunfels and the McNay. They make the best Phat si-io (Pad see ew). The vegetables are cooked to putrefaction and still have a good crunch, the noodles and beef are very fresh and the spice level is just right. Service at this restaurant is top notch, you are promptly greeted and seated. My only gripe is that sodas come in cans and not fountains, but that's ok. The atmosphere is also great, low lighting, TV's in the background, and overall pretty mellow. They have an excellent thing going here and I hope they're there for years to come."], ["Samara B.", "So happy to find delicious, \u00a0fresh, authentic Thai cuisine again in San Antonio! \u00a0Having suffered a Tong's Thai meal a week previously I was afraid I'd find oversalted, overcooked \"Thai\" food again but what a happy surprise! \u00a0I started getting excited just walking through the door, the restaurant was clean and pretty and we were greeted warmly.

Garlic chicken is good too. Never had anything that wasn't amazing. One of my fav places. \u00a0Good lunch specials."], ["Abigail M.", "I have had a lot of Thai food and this is easily in the top 3.

I usually come here alone for lunch just to get out of the office for a while. Plus, I am always craving their Eggplant dish. I read a review where someone thought the dish wasn't healthy and that wasn't mentioned. Hello?! It's battered eggplant. What else could it be? On top of that; it's amazing. It has tofu, basil, veggies. Oh, and this killer brown sauce it's sitting in. It's also served with rice and a spring roll.Seriously one of the best dishes I've had. If you want healthy; get grilled chicken. I just have to defend my most favorite sinful dish. The servers are all amazing and so friendly. They have never been too busy to get what I need and always treat me well. Love them all. Money well spent, friends. Money well spent.Because battered eggplant. All day long."], ["Heidi F.", "I had the lunch special #13. Mixed vegetables in house sauce. The dish was accompanied by a spring roll with sweet and sour dipping sauce. While waiting on my dish, I was given the complimentary soup of the day, which was coconut chicken I believe. The soup was delicious with chicken breast pieces, clear noodles, fresh scallions and cilantro leaves in a clear broth. The spring roll was hot and crispy without being greasy. The fresh vegetables were cooked to perfection (tender with a slight crunch) and served with steaming fragrant rice. The staff was friendly and courteous. The restaurant was clean and calm. I truly appreciate that my drink came in a glass cup, my food was served on ceramic dishes, and the silverware was stainless steel. (I'm not a fan of the paper and plastic products used in many restaurants these days.) I will certainly be back!"], ["Antoinette G.", "I went here based on the great Yelp reviews, but I was not a fan. \u00a0The good: Good service, nice atmosphere, clean restrooms.The not so good: My entree. \u00a0I ordered the tofu, eggplant with basil dish. I really prefer my tofu stir fried, and did not know it would not be served otherwise. \u00a0Also, my eggplant was breaded and fried. If I want breaded and fried food, I'd rather go eat Mexican! The description did not indicate it would be breaded and fried, and I felt pretty unhealthy afterwards. My lunch companions enjoyed their entrees, however (pad Thai)."], ["Justin W.", "OMG, coming here for all of my Thai cravings and telling all of my friends. Management, keep doing what you're doing and you'll keep me a loyal customer. So delicious!"], ["Chelsea M.", "Delicious! I wish I lived closer to this restaurant! Let me begin by saying the service is wonderful and this restaurant is very clean. The exterior of the building is misleading, don't be deterred. It's a wonderful experience! I ordered spring rolls, always do. They were pretty good. I tried the coconut soup with mushrooms... Tom Yum? Tom Kha? Damn, I can never remember. Anyway it's awesome. I was drinking out of the bowl. I ordered drunken noodles for the first time because I couldn't decide. Wow! Really great! Flavorful sauce and a good balance of noodles/veggies. The menu is big and they have an awesome selection. I'm looking forward to coming back. I'm really happy that SA has a Thai restaurant like this...I was truly suffering in Las Vegas!"], ["Grant H.", "Excellent food and service.The interior is very nice and comfortable, well maintained and clean, with plenty of room between tables. \u00a0I would guess this is a family operation, as we were served by many different members. \u00a0 Service was fast and friendly. It got very busy after noon so I would get there early to avoid some of the lunch rush. \u00a0I noticed a two different groups come in who were obviously regulars as they exchanged greetings with the staff. \u00a0That's always a good sign to know people are repeat customers, as with my friends. \u00a0We started with the vegetarian fresh rolls wrapped in rice paper with peanut sauce. \u00a0 Very fresh and well prepared. \u00a0I had Pad Thai Chicken, comes with soup of the day and a veggie spring roll. \u00a0Again, the freshness and kitchen skills were apparent, from the presentation to the taste. \u00a0 When you place your order you specify how spicy (hot) you want, from 0-6. \u00a0I ordered a 3 and thought that was just a bit too hot, and I enjoy some heat. \u00a0So you might want to start with a 2 and work your way up. \u00a0All in all, a very enjoyable dining experience and I have been back a few times and always very good. \u00a0I just wish they were closer to work (downtown) and home so they were more convenient."], ["Courtney T.", "First time to try this place and one thing noticed right away was how professional our server Christopher was.

I seriously can't say one bad thing about this place."], ["Katie V.", "Bangkok 54 has tasty food. While Pad Thai is not the most imaginative Thai dish to rate a restaurant on it was by far the most flavorful Pad Thai I've experienced both in Virginia and Texas. I love it.

The Fresh Rolls are fantastic. The peanut sauce is absolutely fantastic. So fresh and so packed with flavor. \u00a0The presentation sure did not hurt either. The I had the Pad Thai with chicken. This could possibly be the absolute bestest that I have ever had the experience of devouring. The duck curry and the crispy duck are both great duck dishes. As a duck fan my only trouble is deciding which one i want when I need a duck fix.All of the curries are fantastic. I always go with 6 on the spice scale. As meal starters the tom gai khai, the tom yum and the cheese rolls are most excellentest."], ["Anju D.", "Came here for lunch today. Understand they are busy during lunchtime but several things about my experience were terrible - they made me move tables TWICE, the glass was dirty, the food was terrible (I had drunken noodles) no flavor and very oily/greasy!

Our server was friends and fast."], ["Marianne R.", "Loved my lunch here, and will come back!! My only small complaint being that I ordered my chicken Rama without broccoli and it came without any veggies at all.

If I had ordered higher than 3 it would have been too spicy."], ["Sarah C.", "One word: Amazing. \u00a0We are originally from NYC and Thai is our favorite. \u00a0This place serves high quality Thai food with fresh ingredients.

Just awesome."], ["Taylor G.", "Impeccable service and delicious food. The selection is great for all tastebuds there are even vegetarian options including veggie duck! I had their market whole fried fish #33 so amazing! Best fish I've ever had, although steeply priced ($35) fed four girls after having dessert first. We shared fresh spring rolls, taro pudding, jackfruit and sweet rice and fried banana egg rolls.

Need I say more?"], ["Caroline S.", "My favorite Thai place in the city! The service is always great for eating in and if you order ahead, they have it ready at the promised time, and it is always delicious. They make some of the best pad Thai I have had.

You can customize your dish to the level of spice that you like."], ["Carlos E.", "This is becoming one of my favorite lunch haunts. \u00a0I'm not going to lie, when it comes to Thai food I am a creature of habit. \u00a0I found my dish the first time I came here and I order it every time. \u00a0Pad woon sen add chicken medium spicy, all day long. \u00a0The quality is consistent however the spice level tends to vary (even though I always order medium spicy). \u00a0One minor annoyance is they have a soup of the day, as opposed to a small selection for you to choose from (during lunch). \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the lunch soups are great and I have yet to try one that I don not like. \u00a0That being said, if it were up to me I would probably order tom kha 90% of the time as it is my favorite.If you like Thai food and are looking to branch out I highly recommend this spot."], ["Elizabeth R.", "This is, hands down, my go-to place for Thai food. I'm not going to claim to be a Thai food connoisseur, but I've had my share of good quality Thai in the multiple cities I've lived in. No I haven't lived in Chiang Mai. If you are new to Thai food, Bangkok 54's Pad Thai Chicken is a good dish to start with. Great Pad Thai, in my opinion, needs to be dry and light bodied, with a fresh, complex balanced flavor. When prepared properly, the way Bangkok does, this rice noodle concoction needs to balance salty, sour, and sweet flavors. Please order it, it is outstanding here.

The ambience was nice. Had the duck curry with 911 hotness- flavorful. Take the time and enjoy the food slowly. You will appreciate it more.

The mango with sweet coconut rice for desert was heavenly!"], ["Caitlin S.", "I came here with a friend a few months back, I can't remember the date. \u00a0But wowza I was impressed! \u00a0I had been hesitant to try thai food in S.A. because there are so many different places, but I had looked up the reviews, and my friend lives right down the street from here, so we went. \u00a0And it was delicious!!I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, and it came out piping hot. \u00a0I asked for it level 3 spicy, and I have a pretty strong heat tolerance, but my nose was running, my eyes were watering, and I was loving it. \u00a0All of the veggies were fresh and plentiful, the sauce had a wonderful flavor but didn't overwhelm all the other ingredients, and the noodles were cooked to perfection.I also ordered a glass of thai tea, because, well, I don't think it's right to go to a thai restaurant and not get thai tea. \u00a0The tea was great too, just like my favorite place in California, Thai Thani in Redondo Beach. \u00a0My friend got the crying tiger steak lover's chef special, and he gave me a bite. \u00a0That was pretty impressive too! \u00a0The steak with thin sliced and perfectly tender, cooked just right, the dipping sauce was tasty, and so were the vegetables. \u00a0We ordered a pot of jasmine tea, also a personal favorite of mine, and it was hot and flavorful, as it should be.The food here is not \"cheap,\" nor is it high-end steakhouse price. \u00a0It is well worth it for the quality and the portion size, along with the excellent service and friendly atmosphere. \u00a0On a side note, they have some very interesting decor, it is pleasing to the eye to look around the restaurant while you're eating your delicious food. \u00a0Two thumbs up for sure!"], ["Justin H.", "Best Pad Thai in San Antonio! The place is very quiet in the evenings but gets pretty crowded for lunch rush during the week.If you are really hungry, order the lovers appetizer platter before the initial meal.Another good thing is that they can lower or raise the spiciness of the entrees. \u00a0Enjoy!"], ["Kendra B.", "There's a lot of Thai places in San Antonio. And this one is my absolute favorite. The best Thai I've had yet."], ["Jen J.", "I went to this place based on the reviews and I was not disappointed! Small place on the street side. We had just landed in San Antonio and wanted a quick bite after we got the rental car. Place is spacious, parking available, great service and fabulous food. The server asks for your spice rating 1-6 (that was a first for me) We had the chicken and veggies and the red curry chicken. and thai iced tea. Fabulous. Their lunch portions were smaller than what I have seen at other places and I thought everything would be big in Texas!"], ["David H.", "Food and service were excellent. The waitress was actually a good salesperson as well and talked us into trying the dumpling appetizers as well as the calamari. I had the shrimp & scallops with #4 Thai spice which was just right. Nice size shrimp and scallops as well. My colleague had the Pad Thai which he said was very good. Another colleague had the spicy calamari dinner which he said was excellent. My colleagues also had dessert while I had another Thai beer (Chang). They had the mango with sticky rice and said it was fantastic.

The eats here a top notch but the service is horrible. \u00a0I can't relay just HOW BAD the service is, but to get around it just do a call-in. \u00a0Apparently plenty of people know this because any time I go in to get an order there's maybe three tables with people but the take-out is going strong. \u00a0The spicy calamari dish is plenty spicy when ordered at a three, but the basil and peppers taste so good with the squid that you just keep eating to your stomach's detriment. \u00a0For entrees, all the staples are here. \u00a0Pad thai is good, kee mao is great, and all the sauces are fresh."], ["Sherraine E.", "Delicious Thai food! Thai tea was smooth and not too sweet, some of the best I've had here in Texas. Had the cheese rolls, which you just can't go wrong with, and chicken satay for appetizers. Chicken satay was decent, nothing special. My entree was the chicken with Thai chili paste, spicy level 4. Perfect. Just the right amount of spice to clear up your sinuses while still being able to enjoy all the flavors. We didn't have to wait very long for our food either. Place was very clean and the waiters/waitresses attentive.

That being said, at the end of our meal he ultimately said this was one of his favorite places. Service keeps me from giving a full four stars though.However, we were the only people in this restaurant and they still somehow managed to mess up my chicken pad thai order as fried rice. They fixed it quickly, and I appreciate it. Other than that, and the fact that as the only customers it took them a little long to cash us out due to chatting with one another, the experience was fine.Started with a shared bowl of the tom kha soup which was delicious, though could use more chicken and mushrooms. After our initial bowls, there was minimal left for subsequent bowls to finish the order. Super creamy, though.Bf had the beef pad see ew, which I usually don't like but while waiting on my entree I found that it was quite good. His explanation was that it was the closest to \"correct\" pad see ew he's found so far in our city, as it is usually prepared quite tough. He was quite happy with our dining find.My chicken pad thai, when it arrived, was a large portion and the flavor was spot on. Pad thai is hard to get wrong, IMO, but somehow people still manage it at times- this place did not have that problem.There were quite a few tasty things on the menu, so we may be back, but quite honestly it was one of the more expensive thai places in SA so we may not. Surprised the costly dishes have not been mentioned much elsewhere in the reviews."], ["Levi K.", "Very kind staff, awesome noodles. But when I went there they had no Thai tea, what kind if Thai restaurant is that lol. Other than that the food was amazing and pretty fast."]]}
