{"Tito's Mexican Restaurant": [["Matthew B.", "Ali and I went for lunch on Friday, Sept 25th. Service was quick but not rushed. The dining room stayed half full for the time we were there. I have the Friday special, which is the tilapia tacos. Two tacos and they were excellent. There were shreds of jalape\u00f1os and some awesome sauce mixed in there as well. It also came with rice and beans that I was too full to even touch. Free chips and salsa for an appetizer. The salsa tasted homemade but had the consistency of something bottled. Either way it was good. I only give four stars because the dining room is very loud. Concrete walls so there is a lot of echo and it can make it hard to hear your conversation. Otherwise a very good lunch. We will return"], ["Blake K.", "I, along with many others here, can't for the life of me figure out why this place continues to get good reviews. Avoid Tito's unless you are into subjecting yourself to truly horrible service and below average food for the price. The service here is worse than terrible. After finding your own table (no greeters and no sign saying seat yourself) you will be subjected to the first of many long waits. Ours happened to be about 10 mins before one of the three servers hanging out in the kitchen area chatting it up came out with a bowl of chips. Food was just OK. Service is HORRIBLE. Will not be returning. There's great places in Southtown though. Try the Filling Station or Liberty Bar!"], ["Shelly E.", "Food, atmosphere, location is great and comes with a cheap $ and kids dogs can run around.Location is all about the locals and having a good time.Might want to walk there since there is no parking, but oh well-it's San Antonio and that's what you do, walk."], ["Lauren S.", "The food here was good. It was practically empty when we came on a Sunday night. Luckily they had a huge flat screen playing SNF so we could get our football fix. The mango ritas with chamoy had no mango flavor and tasted like a crappy frozen mix. My cilantro cream enchiladas were a little to dry for my liking. Hubby's mixed plate also had one of the same enchiladas as well as a steak - which was full of flavor and tender. The service was good from our waitress but the other two guys working just looked pissed. Angry when we walked in, angry when we walked over to the specials board by the door to read them and got in one servers way, angry when I asked where the restroom was. I wanted to eat somewhere away from the river walk and that's why we chose this place but I don't know if I'd return- I would have hated to be served by those 2 grumpy guys. It killed my vibe!"], ["Kevin H.", "Things have gone downhill here in the last few months. Water glass was dirty, waitress got order wrong, food came cold and had a totally bland taste. Waitress was not friendly at all. I may have to rethink my Sunday breakfast choice. Too bad since it's so close to my bicycle riding route. Used tone lots of cyclists here but not so many and more."], ["Jonathan R.", "Service has gone down hill. Food's good but the wait staff is horrible. 90% of the staff won't help you out. They only acknowledge you when you're upset. Only the same 2 people there are willing to help customers who aren't there's.Definitely won't be going back."], ["Jeremy M.", "It's a very basic restaurant that is, in my opinion, trying to be hip. \u00a0They are located in what appears to be an old automotive repair garage. \u00a0The food was a average at best and the visit left me disappointed as i was looking for a memorable dining experience to finish my vacation. \u00a0My advice would be to try another of the many restaurants in the area."], ["Sarah F.", "Small little place and the staff is friendly. We sat by the bar for happy hour. I got a margarita which was good. I ordered a burrito which was big and delicious! It was pretty quite and not busy."], ["Gina J.", "Great food, but the service is always hit or miss. I really like the shrimp in chipotle cream sauce served over rice with avocado. I think that is my favorite dish. I also enjoy the ceviche tostadas, shrimp nachos, and shrimp enchiladas. \u00a0The breakfast here is also really good. But like I mentioned before, don't count on attentive wait staff. Once I had to wait 20 minutes after I finished my meal to get the waitress to bring me my ticket. Very few times have I been able to get a refill on drinks...all while not busy. The reason I come back is because of the food."], ["Paco N.", "Great place for some almost authentic Mexican food. I'm not sure why people were dogging on the customer service cause the staff that was here was adequate. Mostly friendly and the food was tasty. I recommend it for sure and I'm from AZ and usually search for the legit Mexican food spots just check my previous reviews."], ["Nikki M.", "These guys gave me awesome service and they kept my MacBook there after I forgot it. So in my opinion they are the ultimate because they are honest too. Maybe that's just Texas or just San Antonio, but they surprised me with their honesty. Get the crispy tacos! And the guacamole is just like my wife makes at home. Totally delicious."], ["Tony G.", "I come here every time I come into town. Food is always great and service is attentive, but not intrusive. I recommend the cilantro creme enchiladas. Outstanding."], ["Mark C.", "I will compose this while fresh on my mind. My wife and i were walking down Alamo and we saw the happy hour sign and ventured in here. Great atmosphere and decor. Reminds me of being in another country. Drinks were great. Ceviche wAs first and it was a healthy helping and a meal in itself. Very flavorful, and the best i have ever had. My main course was the fajita spinach salad and had great presentation. Very fresh and pollo was tender. My wife had the shrimp enchaladas. They were spot on! She is from Laredo and complimented everything. Her standards are much higher than inlanders like myself and she gave it a \"5\". I agree."], ["Nhung M.", "Although my meal was pretty limited here, it was still a great experience. Ordered a breakfast taco to go and it was perfect. Fresh warm hand made tortilla filled with eggs and cheese. Btw-they are very generous with the cheese, I had to remove half of it and there was still plenty. Friendly staff, plenty of seating too."], ["Nate C.", "Best Mexican food, especially for breakfast, in San Antonio. Stopped in to my old neighborhood for a bite this morning and just as good as always. A must try for anyone looking for great homemade food."], ["Marc A.", "Well, I was a bit disappointed. The food took longer to get out than it should have, the ishrimp in the enchilada were not fresh. The whole plate wasn't especially hot and only mediocre. The place had a lively feel, and wait staff was attentive and polite, but it wasn't on the same level as Rosario's across the street. They have better ceveche."], ["Joseph H.", "They have a large interor, and the decor is very partan. They have stone floors, square tables with no table cloths, hardwood kitchen chairs, and no booths. \u00a0For a pop in type lunch it felt more than adiquate. They had good menu, \u00a0and super fast super friendly service. \u00a0The complimentary chips and salsa were spicy and delicious. I asked my server for a recommendation and she decisively recommended the enchiladas. \u00a0 I got the shrimp enchiladas and was not disapointed. \u00a0They were not the best I ever had, but for the price they were good. \u00a0The real high lite was the hommade tortillas. They came free with my meal and were fluffy and delicious. \u00a0All in all Tito's is a good little lunch spot."], ["Melissa C.", "Breakfast tacos on the cheap!!!! Been going to this great little place for over ten years. \u00a0Started with 3 tacos for 99 cents,then I started trying other things. \u00a0Everything I have ever had there is great. \u00a0Tacos are 3 for $3, now I think. (inflation) \u00a0Salsa is fresh and very flavorful. \u00a0They have both green and red. \u00a0Chips are just ok. \u00a0Fresh Limeades and Aqua Frescas are really good. \u00a0 Been mostly for breakfast and happy hour, but the King William District is becoming more and more popular so it is a busy place."], ["Hart P.", "Awesome Mexican food in San Antonio."], ["Arvis M.", "Food was fair. \u00a0A little bland for my taste. \u00a0Little heat in salsa. \u00a0Customer service good. \u00a0Probably won't return."], ["Shaz B.", "So, I assume this place only has a 4-star rating, because there aren't very many Mexican restaurants in the area. Naturally, I didn't think like this when I decided to head there on a Friday afternoon - I figured it would be some good homestyle food with nice people. WRONG.Let's just say I can't even talk about the food, because I didn't get to try it. Zain B. was on his hour lunch break, and it looked like the patrons were as well, so we went in, found ourselves a table and waited for a server. And waited. Waited. And waited. Oh, and waited some more. No server - and I can't say there wasn't one in sight, because there was, he just happened to attend to two out of the four tables in that room, passed by us numerous times and did not even give us a glance. A lady, who we assume was the manager, was at the bar and on the phone. She smiled at us, saw us sitting there at our empty table with not even something as simple as water, yet did not bother to say or do anything.About 25 minutes passed (at this point, Zain B. had to be back at work in 35 minutes!), so we gave the waiter a couple of more chances, and walked right out. No one said a word. We did see the manager outside, however, and she thanked us. Thank you? For what?So, rest assured, we will not be returning here. The service sucks, so I can only imagine how the food must be. No, thank you, Tito's. Oh, and we took ourselves to Liberty Bar right after - as always, the service rocked and the food was solid."], ["Alex C.", "If you want some good TeX Mex, this is the place to go. Topped with the fast service, there is a reason why they have as many good reviews as they do. First time in San Antonio and Tito's has not disappointed."], ["Mo M.", "Great food, great service and no waiting. I've been here twice. I recommend the Habanero nachos and Cilantro cream enchiladas for sure!!!"], ["Regina D.", "Pleasant service! Great drinks! Consistently good food! Definitely will return for their Micheladas with dos Equis and Pollo Poblano yummy! \u00a0 Hubby like any of their combo plates!"], ["Judy C.", "The food is ok, just not very good. The service has always been ok, but I feel like the food always has a weird flavor, kind of like cleaner or fabuloso. I have tried different things but it all has this flavor, I am just never fully satisfied with the food and always leave wondering why I keep giving it a chance."], ["Wendy L.", "I've eaten here twice in the last few months. The food has been really good and the service very friendly. I've had the enchiladas both times. The salsa is good and a bit spicy. I'll definitely be back."], ["Michael W.", "Jalape\u00f1o creamy chicken enchiladas are the bomb on a cold day. Hot sauce is consistent. Great homemade flour tortillas!!Service is great!! Ask forJessica. I sat in bar area which had the playoffs going on two TV's. Go Cowboys!!! Bar is well stocked and the bartender is very accommodating!"], ["Melissa R.", "place was amazing, waiter was a bit distracted but the food and ambiance was incredible. ..I love this place and the food was reasonably priced."], ["Floyd A.", "If you're visiting downtown San Antonio, take the 3 minute drive to Tito's and get some real Mexican food. Much better than the tourist-trap joints that serve bland, cheesy dishes - they know your taste buds are numb from the 5 pound margaritas you're throwing down your throat and use that to their advantage.My family and I hit Tito's for breakfast, and it was the best food we ate all weekend. The coffee was decent, the Desayuno Mexicano was great and the breakfast tacos were excellent. Tried my wife's chorizo egg torta and started second guessing my order. My sons mowed down on the Huevos Rancheros - and my daughter went all-American with pancakes, eggs and bacon. A little something for everyone.The staff was exceptional, fast and friendly.The restaurant is located in a historic-looking neighborhood and appeared to be a local favorite. Also looked to be a go-to restaurant for law enforcement. Parking is on the street and in the back, and there was plenty of bicycle parking as well."], ["Ben K.", "Enchiladas!!! \u00a0Crispy tacos!!! Chalupa!! All were great!! \u00a0Service was awesome.A little expensive, but worth the money.Will come again and try their breakfast menu"], ["Karina C.", "Good service and food. I had a mango chamoy margarita and started off with the ceviche. Then I had the shrimp enchiladas with a side of guac. I would have put more mango in the margarita but it hit the spot just fine. The ceviche was perfect with thin slices of onion and avocado. The enchiladas were creamier than I expected but still enjoyable. I love that it was white cheese instead of the usual cheddar. I always passed by this place and never thought to check it out. Thanks Yelp. The pictures really pulled my stomach to this place."], ["j L.", "Tried for the first time, creme sauce and shrimp was excellent. Another plate was enchilada, Taco and Chalupa...great taste...this is pretty common plate in SA...but this had tons of taste without adding a bunch of sauce. Good service...we were there on Monday night so I\"m sure that was helpful compared to weekends. \u00a0Next visit will be for brunch."], ["Danny B.", "We came here after the opera at the Tobin. We actually got here about 8 min before the kitchen was closing and the hostess/waitress was still very accommodating. Huge points! And if she or the kitchen reads this - sorry for coming there so late. That's not something we like doing but you all were the only ones open this late at night. :)My fiance ordered a margarita to start, while the other couple ordered a michelada and a margarita as well. All on the rocks of course! Quick tip which I'll also add to the tips for this restaurant: get a house margarita and ask for a shot of Jornitos as well. When you get your shot and your marg, dump the shot in the marg, and enjoy. We learned this night from the other couple this is the only way to go, the house margs, are lacking in taste AND strength without that extra shot.Before I get to the meals, I have to say, their chips and salsa were the BOMB. Each of us at the table have to have eaten at half the mex restaurants in San Antonio. The salsa is chunky, fresh, flavorful, and HOT. Maybe a little too hot for some, but it's damn good. The chips are crispy, not old, not greasy, not stuck together, hold salsa well, and are salted just right! Now for the entrees! We had enchiladas-each of us. On the table were: enchiladas with poblano cream sauce, enchiladas with jalape\u00f1os cream sauce, enchiladas with chipotle cream sauce, and I don't remember the last one. It doesn't matter, because the poblano and the jalepenos enchiladas were the best! I want to try the cilantro cream next time but these two plates hit the spot. The only thing I'll say, that wasn't on point, was the chicken in the enchiladas. It was a littttttle dry. That and having to boost the margs to make them good are why I'm giving it a 4. Great place to visit if your in San Antonio looking for a cheap mex restaurant that is GOOOOD! Stay away from the touristy mex restaurants closer to center of downtown...P.S. The tortillas are home made!"], ["Lisa M.", "Stopped in to this quaint restaurant after another place we were going to dine at had a super long wait. Lunch specials were decent pricing and were pretty darn delicious!! We had the tacos and cream enchiladas. I recommend those. Finished off lunch with the homemade flan cake and it was SO good. It was a layer of cake of cake topped off with flan and drizzled with caramel. I will definitely have to learn how to make this! Will come back when we are in San Antonio again!"], ["Klarissa R.", "I come here all the time. \u00a0The food is Good, \u00a0reasonably priced, and drinks are awesome!"], ["Steve D.", "I came to Tito's twice over a weekend visit after doing some yoga down the street at Southtown Yoga Loft, and loved it both times. \u00a0On each occasion, I ate at the bar and chatted with some customers and staff. \u00a0The breakfast tacos (day 1) and carne asade (day 2) were incredibly delicious. \u00a0I was treated very well by the staff. \u00a0I'll definitely return on my next trip to SAT."], ["Michael Djapsynse S.", "Mediocre Mexican...run of the mill...only reason to go here would be to sober up after The Friendly Spot..we were charged extra for salsa and overcharged for a plate...when we explained the 89 cent discepency they sent a young assistant manger of some sort to convince us we were wrong...We werent. I was astounded that they would go to such lengths to save 90 cents..Just because the place is in Southtown they felt some kind of superiority ..im sorry but for that your food has to be extraordinary which it was not..if you're looking for authentic creative Mexican cuisine don't go to his place..for a few bucks more you could have real creative cuisine at Hot Joy or Feast...that is unless you're just trying to sober up on starchy Tex Mex..or you could just go to Taco Cabana"], ["Jorge R.", "OMG........ I'm so mad I just now tried this place. Everthing was great. The service was great, the food was amazing and so afforaable. \u00a0My Bill was $25 for two and I had the most expensive thing. And that includes tips. Just made this place our new Saturday breakfast place."], ["Mary V.", "My fiance and I stopped in here for breakfast, and we were pleasantly surprised at the menu and prices. I had three tacos (with delicious homemade salsa) and coffee, which ended up costing me less than $10. All were very good, the portions were generous and the service great. This isn't a high-end restaurant, but it's great place to stop for some home-cooked food."], ["N.L. S.", "Tito's is in south town, but manages without the south town prices. That area I'd say is characterized by good- but way overpriced and overrated food, not Tito's. It was my third time going and so far ive eaten their beef fajita, their carne gasada, and their sopapillas. GREAT SOPAPILLAS- only criticism I have is that they pour a large amount of caramel over it, but for 80 cents more you can substitute it for honey, so no big problem there. Suprisingly, I find their salsa to be the most impressive, it's \u00a0very spicy. One problem though, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the men's \u00a0bathroom. Otherwise a great little place \u00a0that adds character to an already colorful community."], ["Jesus M.", "This was our first visit and we were pretty impressed!! The atmosphere was awesome, this is truly a beautiful restaurant. I am big on customer service and from the moment we walked in the door every person was very friendly and inviting. I loved the fact that our waiter actually knew his menu. He was familiar with what was most popular and was also able to make his own personal suggestions. \u00a0The food was high quality, beautifully presented on the plate, and absolutely delicious!! If I were going to complain, I would say the drinks are over priced. The drinks were ok but the taste and alcohol content was definitely not worth the $16 for one drink."], ["Brande M.", "Aye aye aye aye...do do-do do do-do do do-do! \u00a0Titos makes me wanna speaka de Spanish, or suck down a cocktail. \u00a0Get it? \u00a0Vodka? \u00a0Ahem.So, when I worked downtown at the ITC, we would hit up Tito's for lunch, and I loved it. \u00a0The price is right, Bob Barker...c'mon down! \u00a0The food is wonderfully authentic Tex-Mex, without trying too hard. \u00a0Don't overthink this. \u00a0Use the lunch menu (or dinner) and choose a historically fabulous South of the Border staple. \u00a0I've heard about their marqs, but I was always good at lunch time - YOU'RE WELCOME UTSA.TIP: \u00a0Parking can be a biz, so shoot down a side street and park residential. \u00a0It's an easy walk."], ["Melissa H.", "There was a long wait at Rosario's so we ended up down the street at Titos for a great lunch! Service was excellent and food even better. \u00a0I recommend it! Super casual Tex-Mex."], ["J J.", "I used to eat here all the time when I lived down the street and the service was always so so, but since we moved further away it's always been to go orders and the food 100% of the time is excellent and orders are always correct. Which is hard to get in a to go order 100% of the time. The point of this review is to say we went in tonight with our baby and my wife and I were petrified we would be those people w/ the crying baby that annoys everyone!!! \u00a0Not sure if titos was worried too , but regardless our waiter was excellent!! He attended to us quickly and even placed put our food through first! We enjoyed our food and were In and out within 40 minutes!! It went very smooth and he was very attentive.

I had messaged with a Yelp user from San Antonio asking her for a downtown Mexican restaurant that all the locals know about and she recommended Titos.

Felt like she was ignoring us. Treating us like we were chump high school kids or something.. Decided to order some margaritas to show the ID still nothing changed.

But the salsa was perfecto."], ["Roxy R.", "The food was delicious, I had the marquis plate. It was the on the First Friday menu so I don't know if it's served all the time. It had a cilantro enchilada, another type of enchilada, and a hard taco stuffed with ground beef/potatoe. They were stingy with the rice and beans and I didn't like that the silverware was just a fork. I like to use a knife to cut my food not the side of a fork. The service was good the waitress kept rushing us and there were tables available so that was unnecessary."], ["Wendy N.", "Tito's is a little placed of San Antonio nostalgia nestled in beautiful King William district. Delicious homade salsa and 1 of the best Michalada's in the city."], ["Alex L.", "If you love Mexican food but live in an area of the country where good Mexican is hard to find (like me) - and you find yourself in San Antonio, Texas - this is the spot for you.

Breakfast is tasty. If you can handle the spice, make sure you have the habanero nachos.But please, don't everyone go there or you'll ruin our new favorite joint."], ["Nick A.", "** 1/2Walked by this place a dozen times & always wanted to give it a shot so we did. I had the tacos al carbon which were decent. The meat was tender & tortillas good. However, the dish could have used some seasoning or acid. It tasted better with some of the salsa from the chips. My girlfriend has the chicken mole enchiladas. Good but nothing to rave about either. Average margaritas. So, the verdict. Average Mexican food at a low price on S Alamo in southtown. If you have to drive down here & are looking for Mexican food try Rosario's."], ["Joseph H.", "Tito's is great for what it is - a neighborhood Tex Mex place situated among the now burgeoning South Alamo Street strip. There are newer and more trendy places as well as established restaurants that are local traditions. Tito's is both. Unlike fancier and more expensive places in the vicinity, Tito's is not upscale. They focus on the food, which long ago was noticed by Texas Monthly for the still outstanding shrimp enchiladas. But, they also have a great bar, including premium tequilas and Mexican beer on tap. The lunch crowd is mostly professional, but not the see and be seen crowd from El Mirador (which has great food) and Rosario's (which is not as good as Chipotle). The daily lunch specials are a great value and very tasty. For dinner, you get a mix of folks from the neighborhood and younger folks who will take advantage of the bar and the air conditioning. There is rarely a wait as the staff have been there a long time and know how to turn the tables. The dishes to try first are the enchiladas and they have a sampler plate. Often overlooked are the tortas but they're amazing. The fajitas are average but generous. A house cocktail to try is the Michelada. If beer isn't your style, the margaritas are great. One warning, if you go on the first Friday of the month, the Southtown area holds a festival and you will have to wait to get seated. Also, parking will be a special kind of torture. It's bad at lunch, too."], ["Ashley P.", "food was very delicious. reminded me of my mother in laws cooking. the service was great.they acknowledge everyone. and would help anyone."], ["Diana W.", "Tito's Mexican Restaurant switched to the new fixed pricing menu. I rather enjoyed that approach as I could order 5 items, my wife ordered 3, and then we could split all of the items and have the exact amount of food we wanted. I would go back, but only for less gimicky months. The food itself was of superior quality."], ["Jes\u00fas L.", "This is my second visit to Tito's and it was once again delicious. I am an enchilada fan and the two variations I have tried I have enjoyed. I like that they have over five different flavored which I am eager to try."], ["Greg S.", "Food was amazing..Coming in from a long drive from Houston and this place was a nice surprise. I am so glad we stopped here..The food was amazing."], ["Loran D.", "Reminds me of Julio's in Austin, which I love and miss dearly. Salsa is spicy and flavorful, check. Tacos are delicious and the enchilada I had was perfect, check check. Will definitely be back for more! Good beans."], ["Aaron S.", "When I think about their flour tortillas, I start hearing Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away\" in my head. They're that good, seriously. We were in town last week for a family event, and went here every morning for breakfast. Great tacos, great coffee, and friendly service. Definitely recommend anything with the barbacoa in it, and recommend that anyone staying near the Riverwalk, who wants to see non-touristy San Antonio, take the time to head down South St. Mary's to Alamo St. and check this place out."], ["Jessica A.", "I really don't understand why Tito's gets so much slack. The food is repeatedly good. They always serve huge piping hot portions. For the area the prices are great and you can usually get a seat without too long of a wait. \u00a0Most importantly, Stingy with cheese, they are not! This automatically puts them high in my book of Mexican restaurants around. Their margaritas are strong and may I recommend the Chamoy Mango Margarita. It's one of those drinks that completes me! The service is actually way better when they are busy. When we are in need of food during First Friday Tito's is usually our stop. Recently we went late on a normal Friday night and our waitress disappeared after our food was served. Whatever, the more than accommodating bartender got my tip!"], ["Dino F.", "Tito's Mexican Restaurant is my favorite spot in King William. I have been eating here for years, and we usually have dinner here more than twice a week. The prices are fair, the food is amazing and the servers know us, so they really take care of us. This is a great place to bring out of town guests, it isn't quite as greasy as a hole-in-the wall taqueria, and they have a full bar. This was always my first date place of choice because it is easy to find, always features art on the walls, is locally owned and operated and also really yummy. The last first date I had there was over a year and a half ago, and we now live together, so I'd like to say it works. Breakfast is really great. You can't go wrong with breakfast tacos, and if they haven't run out of the bread, the breakfast tortas are really good. I had never experienced a dish like their Desayuno Mexicano, but it is two eggs, over easy on a bed of mexican rice topped with sliced avocados and pico de gallo. They also have a killer breakfast BLT.For lunch or dinner, the San Antonio Favorites allow you to sample up to three different items, so you can get a taste of what they have to offer. The enchiladas can be creamy and heavy, but if you aren't on a diet, go for it girl. The chipotle or jalape\u00f1o cream enchiladas are amazing. Mole is great, tortilla soup can be overly salty, but my mom would say that was because the person making it is jealous of someone in the kitchen. If you need some comfort, the fideo casero is just like mama used to make. They have homemade (not in house) corn and flower tortillas and they have some great different salsas if you ask. Do you have a love for really spicy food? Order Chela's favorite for breakfast or order the Chela sauce with your dinner. There is bike parking up front so take a ride through downtown and have your meal on the patio. I close with a very bold statement. Feel free to disagree or take the challenge yourself, but I would have to say that the carne guisada, both as a taco or as a plate, is the best in town.

I mean I liked my meal but it was nothing special......in a state where there is incredible Mexican food there is no reason to got to a place that is ok (average).

The chips were not that great to me but my friends said they liked them. I had an enchilada and a beef taco....both were good.I wouldn't tell you never to go here, but if you have a choice look for somewhere that is \"to die for\" great Mexican food."], ["Veronica C.", "My boyfriend, his parents and I went here for sunday brunch a few weeks ago. I'm not sure if they were under staffed, too busy or what, but the service was absolutely terrible. As soon as we walked in there was a big sign that says \"Please seat yourself\", but the few tables that were open had not been cleaned off yet so we just stood around for about 10 minutes while the few wait staff that were working just walked by without any acknowledgement. Finally we decided to pick a table and just sit down even though the table still needed to be cleaned. After sitting down at the table for what seemed like another 10 minutes, someone came and took some of the dishes away but not all. We sat there for what seemed like ANOTHER 10 to 12 minutes before I ended up flagging someone down and asking for a waiter, some waters and that our table please be cleaned up. The waiter was apologetic and nice, but we had already been there for 30 minutes without really speaking to someone and were getting ansy for food.THE FOOD, however, was AWESOME! Really great food, all of us were super happy with everything we ordered. Meanwhile our waiter, although nice, never got us refills on water, only refilled one coffee cup when he was asked to refill 2 cups..... it was just a mess. Even though I'm writing a negative review, I'm really not the type of person to totally blame the establishment...... So maybe they lost some wait staff or people called in sick? Maybe they were all hungover? I don't know....."], ["Claudia Z.", "I had been wanting to try Tito's for some time now and i'm happy I finally got to visit tonight!

It was not a busy night at Tito's when we were there (from 7-9ish), but the ambience was perfect! It's a small, cozy little restaurant. Our server was excellent - very quick, courteous, and handsome! We both were in the mood for enchiladas, so I got the Vegetable Enchiladas & my friend got the Enchiladas Verdes. My Vegetable Enchilada plate was beautiful! Haha, I'm a sucker for pretty looking dishes and it came out looking delicious & waiting to be instagrammed. Check out my picture! The cream sauce was rich and delicious, but I'm trying to eat healthier, so it was a little too heavy for me. I only ate one of the two enchiladas, but accompanied my rice and beans with a flour tortilla & some sliced avocado. Yum!!!! Their flour tortillas are soo goood!!!!

The sauces they leave on the table are very flavorful but neither was over-the-top spicy. The little bowl of soup they give you at the beginning of the meal was a nice surprise, but we had no idea what it was. We were also given 3 tortillas (home made and delicious), but between all of us we had no idea whose meal they belonged to. Parking was difficult to find and we had to walk a bit. Food was the perfect amount that left me full but not stuffed. And prices are very reasonable. I had the squash blossom app and felt the filling was lacking in amount compared to the dough, and the other food had more flavor. That was the one item that was maybe too pricey for what it was ($2 for basicially a 4 bite app)."], ["Chris L.", "Authentic and delicious.

City magazines usually steer me in the wrong direction and usually sucker me into super touristy restaurants. If you can, and this has always been my word of advice. If you don't work Monday-Friday, try going during 1-3 pm, or on a weekend, 1:30-3pm. I've been trying this method for a few years, and it's great. Avoid the business crowd, and get great service.  I just don't understand how anyone could rate this place 1 star.This place, is definitely a hole in the wall. There's writing on the wall, from what seems like a sharpie. It's plenty colorful, with reds, greens and all sorts of color. They have some tables outside, if you want to sit outside on a much cooler day. They had air conditioning inside, so I opted for inside.I didn't know what to get. I was pretty unfamiliar with the menu, besides the straight forward items like enchiladas verde, tacos etc. I asked the waitress what to get, and she said a lot of people like The Puerco ala Casabel or the Cochinita pibil, and lastly she described the huaraches.I said \"huaraches, por favor\"I am glad I did. This was one, of the best things I've ever eaten in San Antonio. Hands down. It was worth the mile and some change walk to get there. This huaraches was an oblong shaped corn tortilla with black beans. I chose the Bistec. On top of it, came salsa verde, onions, cilantro and queso blanco. WowIt was truly amaaaazzing! Love this place.I will go back, whenever I am in town."], ["H. H.", "THAT Mole! So rich, so chocolatey, and so nuanced. Simply the best mole I've had in a very long time and even better with their red sauce mixed in for a little punch of spice.The food was really solid and delicious, the patio area was charming and breezy, and the service was attentive. The fresh tortillas were smoky and super nice. I would definitely return to try the famous pozole and birria that everyone seems to love here.The only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the portion sizes. I'm a pretty small lady and I was able to clean my plate. At $8.50, that seems just slightly high for rational serving sizes. I think adding a third enchilada or just lowing the price a smidge would bring it more into line with competitors."], ["Reyz A.", "Great authentic mexican food - not the Tex Mex variety here.Fideo noodle was nice... green and/or red sauce to your preference of sour, smoky, spicy. \u00a0They torillas tasted really good, the Pipi\u00e1n sauce \u00a0or the piquant Mexican sauce often served over roast chicken or enchiladas, was great with the pork.

Yet another place in Southtown to indulge my taste buds!I can't believe it took me this long to go to Cascabel. I walked over a few months ago, excited to finally sample their interior Mexican menu, but it was closed. Imagine my sadness! Womp, womp. Alas, it is only open for lunch now, but please, don't let that deter you from going. The interior of Cascabel is tiny. There are probably ten (or fewer) tables in the small space, which is cooled only by one window AC unit. Graffiti adorns the walls. To call Cascabel no-frills is putting it lightly. I was warmly greeted by my server, who promptly took my order and gave me a cup of savory fideo noodles within a few minutes of being seated. The broth was flavorful and delicious. I ate every last spoonful! \u00a0I ordered a huarache for lunch, which is sort of a hybrid between a chalupa and a gordita. The masa base is oblong-shaped, and mine was topped with black beans, queso fresco, cabbage slaw, and shredded stewed chicken. ZOMG. So freaking good. They served both a salsa verde and a red smoky (chipotle?) salsa alongside the huarache. I tried both, and was hard-pressed to pick a favorite. I'm dying to go back to try some of their other specialties. In particular, I've heard good things about the mole. When it comes to interior Mexican, It takes a lot to impress me, and Cascabel definitely did on first impression. Major kudos to this place."], ["Simon M.", "Yes! Cascabel is the best!

I didn't come here for the free chips and salsa. I came for the breakfast tacos! I got the chilaqules taco and machacado taco, and had a bite of a couple other ones. The machacado was alright. Good, but not too memorable. The papas con chorizo taco was delicious too. I love potatoes, and these ones were well-soaked in chorizo flavor. Even the simple bean and cheese taco was well made. The beans were smooth and slow-cooked to perfection. Throw some cheese on there, and you just can't go wrong. I save my favorite for last.. The chilaquiles was absolutely delicious!

I ask my waiter to help me with something that's Good and Different he suggested this dish that was excellent, this particular dish was Hand rolled Meatballs filled with eggs and rice that sat in a Chipotle style sauce along with Mexican style rice and beans it seems as if their was a party going on in my mouth after ever Bit.

The salsa was spicy, my michelada was cold and tangy, and the cochinita pibil was great. The service was good and the price was very reasonable. Only a couple of minor criticisms would be the corn torillas are store bought and there needed to be more pickled onions with my dinner.

Guajillada. \u00a0It's nothing fancy, basically a quesadilla but using pita bread instead of a tortilla and steak with actual flavor instead of bland beef fajitas. \u00a0Simple but oh-so addictive. \u00a0I'd recommend one (or two) to soak up all that booze.Only negative about Guajillo's is the ceviche. \u00a0I've tried the fish and shrimp ceviche, shrimp cocktail and the campechano. \u00a0While all came with a healthy serving, they tasted kinda store-bought for the most part. \u00a0The serrano in the campechano was the only saving grace so if you have a craving, it's the best option."], ["Carmen P.", "OMG !!!

Next time. Had the alambre tacos and a side of guacamole. Both were fresh and very good. But their salsa is out of this world good. Only shame was, it was so flavorful that it over powered my other food. It's a salty, sweet, habanero kick that I lapped up all I could with every crumb of chips I had, even after finishing my meal. Parking is a little tight and grungy, don't come here for the scenery folks. But I think I'll make this a normal consideration when in San Antonio."], ["John Paul H.", "I love this place. \u00a0 The fideo soup, conchinita pibil, and tamarindo hit the spot. \u00a0The service and prices are good too."], ["Son T.", "\"Literally\" a shortcut to Mexico, even if I've never been to Mexico.

I've seen many comments about the chips and salsa and I will tell you that it is not the traditional American old El Paso style salsa. It is a genuine tomato paste salsa with a great amount of heat. The chips are very thin and crispy. I happen to love that kind of chips so I was quite pleased. Our appetizers were the the Fideo soup and the tortilla soup. As has been mentioned before they are both outstanding. The tortilla soup can best be described as a spicy broth with beautifully Fried potatoes in there. It was delicious. The Fideo soup is more of a chicken broth-based soup with vermicelli in it. Also excellent.The pibil was tender pork with amazing refried beans and rice. Again, as has been mentioned before, the pickled onions are outstanding. They are very spicy, so beware! The beef tacos were also very good. For dessert we had the rice pudding, arroz con Leche.

They recently also opened Speisen, which is European cuisine but heavily Austrian influenced for their mother/her heritage. Cool! Anyway, Guajillo's is not Tex Mex...it's more like what I found on the street corners in Mexico, authentic. Being from San Antonio, I'm obviously partial to Tex Mex....it's my comfort food. But I like good food in general & Guajillo's is pretty good...We went for 2nd lunch (Luly & Pete...y'all crazy!) so my appetite wasn't up to snuff, I admit. The salsa is superb: pica, smoky yet kinda vinegary, complex. The chips aren't bad, but they're not good. We ordered an agua fresca...it's not homemade but from concentrate. It really had no flavor whatsoever but a fake sweet. It was sent back in exchange for another beverage. To eat, we ordered tacos de alambre, frijoladas (think I messed this up), and cochinita pibil. The tacos de alambre were good: small pieces of pork with bacon (sold!) & chargrilled peppers atop corn tortillas. It is crucial that you squeeze lime juice & put fresh cilantro & onion on top! The cochinita pibil was just ok....salty, not much flavor, kind of dry. I think it needed time to sit in the pot & the flavors shake up cause when I ate it the following day, it was much tastier! The pickled red onions that come with it are a must! I also generously topped it with fresh cilantro & onions. The beans are good. The rice is terrible: overly salty, not much flavor, mushy. The frijoladas were my favorite! If you don't like beans or refried beans, you're out of luck on this dish. It's a giant plate of refried beans atop a thick masa tortilla then topped with raw chopped onions & a dollop of sour cream. My first few bites were curious/unsure, but then I really started getting into it. Service was attentive & nice. The crowd was filling in when we left about 1pm. Most everything was good, not great. This was my second time at Guajillo's and, just like I felt years ago, I'll go back but not rush back...."], ["Aubrey B.", "Love this place! Yes, I would say this place is authentic mexican.

The star of the show was the little tub of onions- Yummy! Mild and added much needed flavor to the tacos. Oh and if you are expecting guacamole- forget it. Ours did not include quacamole.Mole Poblano: Mole is all about the sauce and Guajillo's was decent. I liked the sesame seed toppings. The chicken (breast) was overcooked and obviously not marinated in the mole. Why do people use chicken breast instead of thighs for mole?!?!?I ended up sopping up the mole with the tortillas.

The star of the show are the fresh homemade tortillas and obviously the reason people keep coming back because to be honest the menu is limited and the food is a 3 star plate until u get the tortillas, \u00a0then its a 4 star plate. A respectable 4 star plate.

We ate there for brunch (11am) this past weekend, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. My wife ordered two pork chops, rice and beans. She loved everything! She really loved the coffee too! I ordered a carne guisada with cheese taco and a taco with bean, cheese, potato, bacon and egg (waitress said it's a taco loco, I usually call it a suicide taco). They were awesome, but a little light on the cheese. The tortillas are probably the best I've had in recent years. Grilled to perfection, don't fall apart too easily, and delicious. Btw, the cheese seemed to be shredded velveeta, but tastes great! When I worked close to Mendez, I would go there at least once a week. Just be sure to be patient, as it's a VERY small restaurant with limited seating, limited parking and cash only."], ["Mary Alice M.", "I love this place...

Good customer service and scrumptious food. This is perhaps the best top notch \"mom and pop\" eatery in San Antonio. Someone once said, \"a restaurant merely attempts to do home cooking\" and if that is the case, Mendez Cafe has surpassed my expectations. Not once in my 20+ year of going have I had a bad experience. My favorite things are the coffee, tortillas, carne guisada, and last but not least THE WORLDS BEST ENCHILADAS! The Mendez Special is constructed with meaty gravy and chessy queso cooked up with love.

After reading all the glowing 5 star reports on a restaurant that was described structurally as more of a dump than as a place we would like to visit, my wife and I decided to see for ourselves how the Mendez family managed to \u00a0please virtually everyone who ate there.We made it for breakfast on a Thursday morning. \u00a0As we entered the restaurant, I noticed a section of tables to my left that was closed off. \u00a0This surprised me since I had read on so many reviews about how crowded the restaurant was. For such a small restaurant, I expected a lot of odors...sort of like in all the Pancake House restaurants I've visited in East Texas. \u00a0This was not the case; at least not on this visit.We were seated in the main area of the restaurant and ordered coffee and two potato, egg and bacon tacos each. \u00a0Service was prompt, and the young lady who served us, with a constant smile on her face, was very pleasant. \u00a0I wish I had asked her name so I could \u00a0have included it in my report. \u00a0First impression of the food: I consider myself a connoisseur of coffee. \u00a0At home, I clean my pot daily, use bottled water, and freshly ground beans. \u00a0The coffee at Mendez Cafe was very fresh, had a nice aroma, and the medium strength blend was way above the quality of what I expected. \u00a0Our tacos arrived within minutes after we ordered. \u00a0I was a little apprehensive when I saw the thickness of the tortillas, expecting them to be stiff and hard to chew. \u00a0This was not the case. \u00a0I won't say they were the best I've had in San Antonio, but they were way above average. \u00a0I would rate the tortillas at Taco Taco just a bit higher, but I want to go back to the Mendez establishment one more time before making a final judgment. \u00a0The bacon was crisp, but firm, as it should be on breakfast tacos. The eggs were soft and flavorful, and the potatoes were cooked perfectly, not mushy as they are in so many other restaurants in San Antonio.Our next visit will probably be for lunch. \u00a0I expect the restaurant will be more crowded, which might put a different slant on my opinion, but it won't alter my overall rating if the food is as good as others have reported."], ["Paige C.", "A great little mom & pop restaurant! \u00a0They have the BEST CHILEQUILES on the planet. \u00a0They aren't on the menu but you can ask for them.CASH ONLY ~ The parking lot is ALWAYS full."], ["David E.", "Great Tex-Mex near the old Kelly AFB. Their flour tortillas are homemade and made fresh all day long; I have actually seen them making these jewels. You can always tell a good Mexican restaurant by their re-fried beans, and their re-fried beans are the best. I love their bean and cheese tacos. My favorite thing to eat at Mendez is the Mendez Special - WOW! It consists of 2 beef enchiladas, one crispy tacos, beans, rice and two flour tortillas; it is absolutely delicious. The enchilada sauce that they make is absolutely delectable. Everything is very good at Mendez Cafe, so you can't go wrong. I've known the owner and his wife, and they are first class people; they aim to please their customers. Hours are from 7:20am to 1:30pm; open every day but closed on Tuesdays.

The Gua Bao is to die for good. The caprese salad was so good that we had to order a second one. I wish the ambience was a little better (it does look and feel like a former gas station) but the excellent food made up for that and was quickly forgotten. The place also shares a parking lot with a gay bar which is not an issue but be prepared for questions when you ask your 16 year old to meet you there in his own car for dinner.

I am so excited that a great restaurant that focuses on locally sourced, well tended ingredients has made its way to our city and right into my mouth. It's easy to pass this hole-in-the-wall looking joint at the intersection of Main and Lexington...and some other streets that all kind of come together in a triangle shaped cluster, but don't sleep on this one. It's a great lunch spot. I came in about 11:30 and there was no wait. The waiter was totally charming and the service was great. I like the fresh and clean atmosphere. It's a small place that somehow manages to not feel crowded. I ordered the grass-fed beef soft tacos. They came out lighting quick, but definitely fresh. The beef had a hell of a spicy kick, which I loved. There was shredded jack cheese lining the tortilla and a beautiful multi-colored lettuce mix and diced tomatoes on each taco. The cilantro-lime basmati rice was tender and light. The refried black beans were super flavorful; often places trying to be \"healthy\" tend to skimp on their bean seasonings, when good spicing will take you farther than fats anyway. These were delicious. Every bite was wonderful. I left feeling full, but refreshed and not weighed down. This is definitely going to make it into my regular lunch rotation because there's a lot of menu items that look particularly impressive, and because I think it's really important to support local businesses going out of their way to take such pride in their food.The Clean Plate is also open at dinner now, and it's BYOB with a $7 corking fee. Not too bad! I'll see you again soon, Clean Plate! And next time, I'm ordering dessert!

Come here and try everything on their menu, you won't be disappointed.The coolest part was when I ordered food to take home for my brother, I ordered some panko breaded lamb chops but the chef came out to tell us that with the breading it would be soggy once they put it in the to go box and would not taste as good.

Just like she doesn't want to pay 7 dollars for a beer at a neighborhood pub (see picture below), I don't want to pay 16 dollars for chicken in a KFC environment.

The menu looked very interesting but as soon as I saw the quail, I knew what I was going to have. My friend ordered the red snapper fish special and we split the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer.The tomatoes were delicious: tangy, lightly coated and fried perfectly. They were accompanied with a freshly made tarragon sauce that enhanced the oh, so flavorful tomato.The quail was accompanied by mashed potatoes and roasted green beans with sun dried tomatoes. The mashed potatoes had caramelized onions incorporated, which gave them a sweet wonderful taste. The quail was very savory, though a bit over salted.My friend's fish was cooked and seasoned well. Both dishes came with the roasted green beans.

I have had really bad luck every time I run through this state and dread driving through it. Enough of that, the real review begins with the little slice of paradise I found during my trip.This place had really good reviews and after driving almost 11 hours straight I wanted something fresh and quaint. This cute cozy restaurant satisfied that and much much more. My boyfriend and I tried the stuffed pepper with the ground beef and two side salads. The side salads had light balsamic vinagerette with a variety of lettuces and small cherry tomatoes with a burst of flavor. My taste buds were enlightened as soon as I tasted it. The next meal that came out was the main course: stuffed pepper with squash, zucchini, corn, ground beef, and light cheese with a dash of cilantro. The dish was pretty spicy but all the merrier to brighten up my taste palette ;). Everything felt so light we had to go ahead and try the brownie with Mexican vanilla ice cream. I can't say enough how sultry this brownie was. I believe it just came out if the oven and it had three distinct flavors: caramel fudge and Amarillo. The Mexican vanilla ice cream with the texture of walnuts just was the best way to end the night. I definitely recommend this quaint little restaurant to anyone who appreciates a variety of flavors.

They have Maine Root fountain sodas, which our server managed to tell us all about, so I ended up ordering the lemonade (which was hot pink, yum!). Also, they don't actually serve alcohol; they're BYOB with a $7 uncorking fee, so there's also that option.For our entrees, I decided to order the stuffed poblano pepper dish, which was served with rice and refried beans on the side. It was both spicy and delectable; the flavors all meshed well together and though a typical Mexican-like presentation, the pepper tasted very differential from a typical Mexican restaurant taste. I think I could do without the refried beans next time, but again, it was a good addition to the main dish.Zain B. got the beef sliders - my oh my! They were delicious. I honestly... just... have no words. The patties had such intense flavor and the fries were awesome!

Small kitchen and dining area with a banging flavorful meal. They source locally, cool. They carry unique Mexican sodas, cool. The food is soooo clean that it's all that matters!!!. Googled clean eating and found this place. Now every time I visit from ATL I have lunch here. I sit & eat by myself and religiously have the Mac n cheese every damn time. Last time I visited I brought my new boss, he gobbled all of it. We shared a burger & fish tacos starting with Mac n cheese as an app. He is a blabber mouth and although I've never made my appreciation or patronage from Atl known...he spoke to the owner. A young female in cut off jean shorts and a flannel cream top. She's calm, confident and relaxed. Not my type of 5\" heel and designer bag girl but I could totally chill with her. Made me like the place even more. I read some of the nasty reviews and I personally liked her \"rude owner\" comments back to the unpleased diners. Screw in girl. Keep the clean plates coming."], ["K L.", "The food here is very good but outrageously expensive. I understand that there is a high ingredient cost for local seasonal produce but even factoring that in its over priced. I've eaten here a couple times and all my food was fine and the servers are fantastic but you can hear the chef berating her kitchen staff which is very off-putting. You expect the menu to be more casual from the look of the place and its just not the kind of place you really want to spend $25+ a person for dinner."], ["Bryan H.", "Stopped here based on Yelp! review...and so glad I did! \u00a0The waiter immediately recommended the Gua Bao for me as a first-timer. \u00a0O M G. \u00a0Yes, I would be happy to have this several times a week. \u00a0Need to come back for the rest of the menu, but likely I'll just keep ordering the Gua Bao. \u00a0:)"], ["Sunay P.", "A funky little place on Main that you have to watch out for otherwise you breeze right past it. \u00a0This was obviously a taco shack or something that closed down and while the place has a rundown look outside, it has loads of lets say rustic charm inside. \u00a0Very attentive and friendly greeters and wait staff greeted us quickly and sat us down. \u00a0This is a F2T place and boasts that all the food is locally sourced. A small menu that has food ranging from meaty to completely non-meaty entices you to order a few samplers. \u00a0The wife very quickly ordered the fish tacos and I was in a bit of a quandry and ended up ordering the Pasta Bolognese at the behest of the waiter who extolled the virtues of the dish. \u00a0The waiter also very smoothly upped our bill by asking us if we wanted chips and salsa, and of course we said yes, very foolishly assuming that they were complimentary : they were not! \u00a0But other than that smooth touch, he was quite good. \u00a0The chips were light albeit quite greasy and served with a nice warm salsa with the mildly sweet-bitter flavors of roasted tomatoes, onions and garlic and was very well flavored. \u00a0The food came out after a short wait and was quite well presented.The fish tacos were made with grilled mahi-mahi which was cooked perfectly, but needed a bit of oomph in the seasoning. \u00a0The tortillas were no big shakes, but overall the dish was lets say very healthy tasting. The green cilantro basmati rice that accompanied the tacos was more garlicky than cilantroey (not complaining, since we like garlic) and was cooked perfectly. Fluffy, yet with a slight bite. \u00a0My pasta Bolognese was a nice serving of pasta with the sauce decoratively loaded on top with small but adequate squares of focaccia. \u00a0I do have a pet peeve about pasta. I like it tossed with sauce in the kitchen before being served, but then each person varies. The sauce itself was quite thick and tasty and redolent of a touch of cinnamon, thyme and oregano (the nice thing was the sauce was unusual, but very well made) with tender meat all enveloped in a thick sweet tangy tomato base. \u00a0The pasta was a bit overcooked for my liking, but overall the dish came together quite nicely. \u00a0The focaccia was quite good with a nice bubbly top, but alas was not made by them.Overall a place worth visiting again. Some of the sandwiches and fries looked crazy good, so will give those a shot again. \u00a0Give them a shot: nice vibe, decent food and smiling faces are always good for lunch, and dinner!"], ["Cameron M.", "Hands down, the best meal I have ever had in San Antonio, Texas.I am a foodie from out of town, and I am spoiled by great farm-to-table dining.

I don't know. Maybe both. All I care is that it's \u00a0great. Few basics: 1. Cost $2-3 more per plate because it's organic and stuff. It's worth it 2. Helpings are the right size for one person. You will be full but eat your whole plate with no leftovers. 3 . Byob with $10 cork fee. Bring a $20 bottle and it will equate to something that would have cost $100 at a \"fancy\" place 4. Someone at the table must get the gua bou (pork dish...not sure of spelling) it will blow your mind. 5. We spend about $120-150 for 4 at dinner inclining cork fee. Totally worth it. Lunch is cheaper.

Do enjoy the art on the wall too-it's available for purchase. The Mac and cheese was good- I prefer mine with more salt (but that's personal taste- my dining companion thought it was fine). The salad basically comes in a thong- that's how lightly dressed it is. Just a hint of enhancement to really let the mix of bitter, sweet, crunchy, leafy, and buttery greens shine. Best bolognese I've had in a long time. The locally sourced meat was almost creamy from the milk and red wine reduction it's supposed to endure. It was served on properly cooked pasta also.

The establishment is easy to miss, signage is not obvious and it's located in a spot where parking can be crazy depending on traffic. Still, despite all of this, I'm happy that I was able to eat here.Don't take anything for granted here. This place is working hard to be farm to fresh and really has quality ingredients, great tasting food, and amazing staff. Let's start with the food. Their menu is seasonal, so depending on what's in season at the time you will see it vary. That's fine by me because it forces me to try something new. So next time I go, it may vary from what I had yesterday.The menu offers a variety of options and there is sure to be something of interest to just about anyone. Some menu items I recall are pork belly between two amazing looking steamed buns, their ham sandwich (not ordinary by any stretch of the imagination), their bison burger, their organic beef burger, and their fries. I ordered their organic beef burger with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and a pepper garlic aioli sauce with sliced cheddar. It was heavily, hands down one of the better burgers I've had in a very long time. I had a root beer to wash this amazing meal down, and much like The Cove, they a special soda maker that I had never heard of, but the root beer was to die for. It was ice cold and really made you pucker with the first sip. Talk about flavor explosion.All together the meal was great, but the service was better. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made sure everything came out on time. Considering we were a party of 12, it was surprising to see how on top of things they were. The cook herself came out to speak to our table, ask how the food was, and was just generally gracious about everything.One thing to note, this place probably gets packed quickly during peak lunch hours. There is not a lot of space. About ten tables inside, and two picnic tables outside. Don't be discouraged if you can't make it in, come back, because the food is totally worth it."], ["Stephanie M.", "FARM TO TABLE!! When I first heard of this restaurant through an email from TidBits San Antonio, I was completely hyped up for our first experience.The Clean Plate fully lived up to the hype!! I was so happy that the flavors of what we ordered matched our enthusiasm in finding a place in San Antonio that is farm to table.I ordered the burger with grilled onions... It is now one of my favorite burgers in all of San Antonio! I am not sure what all they put in there, but it has a wow-factor that cannot be beat! \u00a0From what I could tell, they had a wonderful amount of whole-grain mustard on a wonderful brioche bun and fresh greens. \u00a0I didn't even feel compelled to reach for the ketchup. \u00a0The burger was served with great shoe-lace style fries that were perfectly crispy.My boyfriend enjoyed the tacos... although they were a bit too spicy for me to sample, I'll believe him when he says they are great!Even though I give up soda drinks from time to time, I am still enamored by the restaurants that have a small refrigerator of Mexican Cokes made with real sugar. \u00a0Try one! It tastes great with the burger.I cannot wait to try the rest of the menu. \u00a0The restaurant has a great casual atmosphere. \u00a0Perhaps the good karma of this place just comforts the entire eating establishment?I wish I could eat here everyday! And perhaps with consistent patronage more \"clean plates\" or similarly minded restaurants can spring up all over San Antonio.I meant to ask the wait-staff too, but one of the challenges is parking. I believe The Clean Plate has about 5 parking spaces for the restaurant itself, but it is unclear where everyone else can park without being ticketed or towed.... and the restaurant can fit way more people! Also, I believe the Clean Plate is only open for breakfast and lunch during the week.... makes it a little difficult for my boyfriend and I to eat here all the time, but we will make the effort to be here!!"], ["Sherrill O.", "The fish tacos plate is excellent.

On our first visit (just because), we tried Ceasar's Queso with our chips (a mix of cheese, beef, tomatoes, guacamole) and very tasty! For my main, my go-to dish is always enchiladas verdes at Mexican restaurants, but I had to try something different here! I ordered the Chile Relleno (my husband recommended it from when he ate there for a work meeting), and I trusted his choice (especially because he is slightly picky!). It was a hearty dish, slightly sweet from the raisin and pecans in the stuffing mixture, and I think a tad of cumin - \"unique\" and tasty. Lastly, the Tres Leches cake was the perfect ending to this meal!Tonight we celebrated our 1st year wedding anniversary here, and first ordered the Specialty Salsas with our chips, which was a trio of a smoky red, fruity jalape\u00f1o, and verde (lime, cilantro, avocado); so good! \u00a0The Sopes appetizer, 4 small corn medallions topped with meat atop of a bit of spicy red sauce was delicious and highly recommended! I went out of my box again and was going to order the Enchiladas de Mole, but some of the reviews mentioned the mole is on the sweeter side. The server offered me a taste of the sauce, and even though it was very good, it was a tad too sweet for what I wanted tonight. So, instead I chose the Enchiladas de Camote (sweet potato) which was a harder tortilla wrapped around a sweet potato mixture, served with (I think) green beans and/or cactus). This dish was very good, and on the lighter side so I had room for dessert - the tasty Chocolate Cake :)With ALL that said, you have to be open to different flavors at La Fonda on Main, not the \"standard\" Mexican that you may be \u00a0used to, because this is not just another neighborhood Mexican restaurant!

The fresh chips and salsa were also good - the chips thicker and better than the salsa, which i found overly tomato-y & missing spice for my taste. We chose to both have the enchiladas of the day, Pato (Duck), which were served covered in a sweet & thick sauce incredibly similar to a mole but with a hint of tomato. Honestly, I only ordered this because I had no idea when the next chance I would have to ever eat a Duck enchilada would be and am I so glad I did. The duck was so tender & not at all dry. The cilantro rice & raw veggie garnish accented the sweet thickness of the enchilada perfectly. I was so excited I forgot to take a picture, so please just close your eyes and hum something sultry. that is what they looked like. We were full and happy when it was over.

Next we moved on to the delicious chips and mild salsa. I liked the mild stuff so I will admit we had to order a refill. The service was great and the staff was really friendly. I know this because I could not stop eating the chips. They were quick to refill and made us feel at home.

Both were very flavorful, and would order again. The Enchiladas Camaron were stuffed to the max with first rate shrimp unlike other places that are skimpy on the shrimpy. Cheesecake was top rate, totally divine. Queso as well...loved the guac in the queso. I had a white russian and it was very good. We'll be back! It was a busy Saturday evening."], ["Kate S.", "Went here for a business lunch and definitely plan to return for pleasure.

W.", "Had heard of La Fonda on Main but never stopped in probably b/c i don't eat Mexican food much. So a few weeks ago I had a meeting in the area and decided to try this place out for lunch. Apparently it's some sort of lunch hot spot b/c the restaurant was a full house when I arrived. I only had about 40 minutes so I told the hostess that I just needed a quick lunch. I was seated quickly and my waiter was super polite and efficient. I really have to comment on the service b/c they deff took their customer's needs seriously. My waiter acknowledged the fact that I was pressed for time and took great care of me. He acted quickly on all my requests so I was able to be in and out in under 40 minutes. Big tips for ya! The food wasn't too shabby either. I certainly enjoyed my duck tacos with a side of mango salad. The duck was tender though I wish it was more seasoned but the mango salad was absolutely great. And the food was plenty! Overall a solid place: decent food and FIVE STAR SERVICE!! I'd totally recommend it to anyone!"], ["Christina B.", "La Fonda on Main is 1.4 miles away from my most favorite group of antique and thrift stores and after asking fellow Yelpers on the Talk forum where I should take my Houstonian parents for Mexican food, this seemed to win the vote and I am so glad we went. I LOVE this place.I absolutely loved the decor. It was so bright, colorful and cheerful and the outside patio with the standing heaters is gorgeous. It is the perfect place to eat some tacos and drink a few margaritas. It was a tad bit cramped with a larger party so I'd definitely suggest sitting outside if it isn't too hot.I had the \"Fajita Plate\" which was phenomenal. My steak was cooked exactly the way I asked (medium rare) and the cut was grade A. I've never had steak like this before. I'd come back JUST for this. I would have liked some more toppings (grilled onions, cilantro, etc but it just came bare with the meat and the flour tortillas). I was a little upset to find out that on the website the \"Fajita Plate\" comes with the following; \"Two USDA prime beef or chicken fajita tacos, grilled onions, peppers, pico de gallo, guacamole, ancho spinach salad\". I did not receive onions, peppers, pico de gallo or guacamole. Bummer. My husband had the best Chile De Poblano that he has ever had and he has been insistent that we come back solely so he can make me try this. He said that even without it being stuffed with some sort of meat, it was perfect. Perfect atmosphere for Saturday brunch after a morning of thrift shopping and even though the service was a little shoddy and my fajita plate was missing some toppings, I will definitely be back to try the other options on the menu."], ["M S.", "Awesome food with perfect ambience. The drinks are different from what I have had at other other places. Each one looks like a must try. Service is as expected and loved the patio setting."], ["Jin M.", "A Mexican restaurant that serves vegetarian options in Texas?! I'm in love already. You can have the option of sitting inside or outside. I know, in this Texas heat?! Well, don't you fret, there are LARGE fans all over this spacious patio and trees that hover to give you the nice, cool shade you need. Also, the patio is pet friendly! There are lots of delicious margaritas and other drinks available (mojito, bloody mary, sangria, etc.). The food.. YUM. I had the Chile Rellenos which was super delicious. It was stuffed with tons of veggies with a mild verde sauce poured over the huge chile pepper and a side of queso covered in tomatillo sauce. Everything went perfectly together and I really enjoyed this dish. My friend ordered the duck tacos, and she loved the dish. Next time I'll have to try the Enchiladas. The servers are friendly and attentive, chips & salsa are divine, drinks are always cold & the food is phenomenal. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Caitlyn S.", "I'm torn on how to approach this review. There were some definite perks to our visit to La Fonda last night, but there were some downfalls as well. So, here we go!When we arrived around 6:30 on a Thursday evening, it was semi crowded, but we were able to be seated right away. We chose inside, since...well...it's Texas and July. Our waitress was prompt in getting our drink orders in. My frozen margarita was pretty standard, but delicious all the same (but $7.50 for a standard margarita? c'mon).The chips and salsa are good...the chips look and taste freshly made and a very thick (almost pita like), and the salsa is pretty thin and runny but very spicy. A little went a long way for me, and I stayed away from it once we ordered the queso. The queso was pretty standard too, which was disappointing. I saw another reviewer mention its Velveeta-like quality, and I would have to agree. If I visit again, there was another queso with poblanos and mushrooms that I will definitely try instead.Our meals were good overall. My husband ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Xique\u00f1o based on other reviewers from Yelp (I'm thinking our dependency on Yelp has gotten a little out of hand) which he enjoyed but said they were a little too sweet for his liking. I ordered the fish tacos, which were very good. The fish was covered in some sort of sauce/marinade that was a little smokey and delicious. They were covered in slaw and some pickled onions (I think?) that gave it a nice touch. My only complaint was the side...it was a salad of sorts with tomatoes, crumbled cheese, and green beans or peppers (I'm still not sure), but it was very oily. I think overall we enjoyed La Fonda, but with a city full of delicious Mexican restaurants, I'm not sure it will be one that we return to."], ["Richard E.", "Wife says frozen margarita with Don Julio Silverado is great.

As was the spinach enchiladas over a bed of white rice !"], ["G G.", "What a disappointment. At first glance of the menu it seems like a more eclectic selection than your typical Mexican restaurant, then the food comes and though nicely presented, leaves much to be desired in the way of flavor. There is none! It's bland and boring. The kicker was when my husband found a twisty tie like from bread packages in his beans. The server was there and looked noticeably embarrassed and took it away immediately and brought him a replacement. He apparently had notified the manager who came to our table, made a joke about it and then left. Some service. I wish we had saved those $60 and gotten some better treatment and better food for half the price. Never again."], ["Anabel R.", "My husband and I were there last night and had a wonderful time. The decor of the place was very nice, not over the top. We chose to dine outdoors in the nice courtyard. Reminded me of growing up in Mexico. The food was exceptional, pleasantly surprised with the selections from central Mexico rather than just tex-mex. \u00a0They seem to care about every detail of the food as even the rice, beans and pico were delectable ( I usually don't eat those sides) We began with fresh chips and great salsa and then had enchiladas de mole Xique\u00f1o and the Tampique\u00f1a steak. The mole was delicious and the steak tender and juicy. To finish we decided on the Horchata flan, yummy. The margaritas were tasty as well. Definitely a great experience. Will be back when in San Antonio."], ["Bryan L.", "La Fonda is a great neighborhood joint with consistently terrific food. My wife and I have lived in Corpus Christi for two years but have probably been to La Fonda more times than any restaurant in Corpus. It's certainly worth the drive from any other point in SA. The food is somewhat different from most other South Texas Mexican fare. While the menu includes their take on some Tex-Mex favorites, most of the choices are more like what one might find in California. Our favorites include the trio of specialty salsas, the duck tacos and the shrimp enchiladas. Their margaritas are also spot on.Oh by the way, the value at La Fonda is just about the best you'll find anywhere. Dinner for two with drinks and tip will probably just cap $50."], ["Vicki G.", "Yum!What is it about San Antonio Mexican food?

Very popular place, and I can see why.

Not just the top of the line fajitas or asada but also with traditional tex mex enchiladas, tamales and tacos. The ribeye and asada was amazing.

The fish was breaded which seemed a bit unusual, I'm used to grilled or fried. The flavor was decent but the breading ended up slightly soggy.Pricing:Over priced for Mexican food. \u00a0I realize fish is often more expensive than beef or chicken tacos but $16 seemed a bit steep. Service:We were a group of 25. I am always more tolerant of mixed up orders or delays on getting dishes out. Neither of these happened but one of our waiters was rude to multiple people in our group. He told one person he couldn't move to a different table even though orders hadn't been taken yet. He was inconsistent with telling people about extra charges for splitting dishes. He was generally rude to multiple people, this is not okay. Perhaps he was having a bad day or was feeling overwhelmed by our large group.

There were lots of open tables. I missed the lovely lady with the braided bun, but I understand that nothing remains the same. However, the young greeters were acceptable (there seemed to be a few extra youth milling about). We were seated and given an odd basket of mini-muffins. This, at 1:00pm...long past breakfast. I asked for chips and salsa which were provided once and never refilled. Again, nice group of greeters milling about, but few of them attentive to our needs. I never had my water refilled, and a friend's tea was topped off with warm tea. She asked for ice and was brought a glass with some cubes.The food took a looooong time. We ordered off the limited one-page menu, so it should have been pretty quick.I ordered the Old Number 7. The lettuce on the chalupa was so old, it tasted horrific. It took me a couple of bites to figure out what tasted so bad.The rest of the plate was just ok. Nothing special.I am very sad to say I \u00a0will not be returning. This is a sad realization. I did not speak to anyone...no one appeared to be in charge. No one inquired if we were happy with our meal."], ["James B.", "I took my wife here and we really enjoyed it. \u00a0The food was really delicious. \u00a0Appetizers were great. \u00a0My son was 11 months and got a little cranky at the end but the visit was still great. \u00a0Our waitress was totally on top of things and we were never let down by the service."], ["Carissa B.", "I want to say I like this place but the 2 times I've been there I had bad experiences. The first time my fish tacos were full of bones. Luckily, they brought me a new dish and comped my meal. The second time we didn't get service until sitting there for about 20 minutes. The place was full of older Caucasian people so I guess they weren't in a hurry to help two young women with tattoos in shorts. Besides that everything else was okay."], ["M C.", "Was excited to try La Fonda out due to the positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say, I concur with the Yelpers. \u00a0The food is delicious, and I'd say go with the outdoor seating if you can. The Caesar queso appetizer was amazeballs, great way to start the meal. Two entrees I would recommend would be the Milanesa and Beef Fajitas. Both were exceptional. Also? Their mojitos are made with brown sugar and just taste pure and delicious. The service was relatively quick and overall, we had a great experience! Well earned 4 stars!!"], ["Lauren P.", "Had a lovely, Monday dinner with my visiting mother on the patio. The food was excellent - tasty and fresh. The service was fast and proficient - friendly, but not chummy or terribly attentive. I was surprised it was so busy for an early Monday evening. I had Enchiladas de Espinacas, which was two small enchiladas laid on white rice, with a nice drizzle of poblano cream and sun dried tomato. I liked that the enchiladas were not smothered in the rich and delicious sauce and that the vegetables (I wished for more) were not overly cooked. I asked for it without asadero cheese and thought it was just rich enough. My mom had the Mexican Cobb Salad with beef, which was large, colorful, and fresh looking. She loved it. Will definitely bring future visitors here."], ["Suzi A.", "I love the ambience of this place it's just a great mix of hipster with your grandma's favorite restaurant.

It's really great to find a good vegetarian option. \u00a0Our only complaint it with the salsa that comes with the chips it's bland and watery and doesn't stick to the chips.

I was greeted by various people on my way in and on my way out.I didn't feel like struggling with the drink menu and ordered a house margarita on the rocks w/ salt. It was good, not too sweet or sour. I'm not a margarita connoisseur, but I'll say it was fresh and tasty. I ordered the vegetable tacos and my friend ordered the duck tacos. Both were delightful. I tried a piece of the duck...so scrumptious, cooked to perfection. Vegetable tacos were the best I've had. Huge slices of portobello and perfectly sauteed peppers and onions. Fresh made corn tortillas tasted very good, and I generally prefer flour. My fav part? Salad comes on the side, half a plate of fresh baby spinach topped with mango! Even the complimentary chips are amazing, fresh made and not coated with salt. Salsas were spicy, just how I like it.

What happens? They sit us right away - of course, because they place was empty.Anyway ...beautiful space, light and airy, the patio outback looked nice but it was way too hot to sit outside.The chips and salsa are really good. They give you huge bowlfuls and the chips are nice and crunchy but not greasy. The salsa was very fresh and spicy.I got the shrimp enchiladas and it was good. Surprisingly (and this is good) it was not too heavy since it has so much cheese. Plenty of pieces of shrimp. Maybe I was expecting more because I was in Texas, but while it was perfectly fine, I wasn't really impressed. It tasted like much of the dishes I can get back home in NYC."], ["Hannah B.", "La Fonda on main is consistently great!

We were seated promptly, served chips and salsa, and got our orders taken: La Fonda Special for me, and Tacos de Pato for the wife. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I found the crispy beef taco and cheese enchilada very tasty, made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. Other stuff on my plate was decent too, just not as good. Salsa had some kick, which added to my dining experience (I tend to use it liberally whenever I eat Mexican). The wife's tacos easily elicited my envy, and I'd be lying to say that I didn't have order regret more than once through my meal. She attested to the tacos being as delicious as they looked. We'll definitely go back to La Fonda to try more menu items, even though the prices are slightly above market for Mexican. Highly recommended!"], ["N H.", "Best tex-mex resto I have ever been to.

Our server was very attentive ... she kept checking if everything was ok or if we needed drink refills. I had the fajita plate. the meat was cooked to perfection. The wife had the sampler plate.

We were a little surprised by the lack of a selection of places to choose from, but Barriba Cantina had decent reviews and was convenient to where we were so we decided to give it a try.To start with the positives: I really enjoyed the live music. It really helped create a nice atmosphere. The decor was pretty interesting. I liked the interesting lamps hanging from the ceiling and the dia de los muertos themed decorations everywhere. The food came out insanely quickly, and my fianc\u00e9 seemed to enjoy his chicken tinga enchiladas.Now on to the negatives: first impression of the place was shattered when our server was just all around rude as we tried to sit down at a table. It didn't help that he was our main server throughout the night and wasn't very responsive. We had to ask another server for a few different things (like silverware and water!!). I just think we picked the wrong table to sit at since the other server seemed to actually be on top of it and was very nice.Looking at the menu, I was a bit underwhelmed with the lack of a selection. Fianc\u00e9 was really wanting a burrito, and they don't have those here. As stated, he ended up going with the chicken tinga enchiladas. I ended up splitting Perla's pan seared fish and rice and an order of the mango pescado tacos with my future mother-in-law. We also ordered queso as an appetizer.The queso and chips were a disappointment. The queso was a little too runny and slightly spicy for me, and the chips weren't very fresh. They weren't quite stale either.. just in an in-between stage. Future mother-in-law and I do not like spicy food at all. I can appreciate the flavor, however I find the burning sensation pretty unpleasant. We picked our dishes reading their descriptions carefully and thought we had made good choices given the small menu and lack of selection. I thought we were safe when the menu described the fish as having a \"mild\" chile rub. Well, apparently mild is a very subjective term. We both found it far too spicy to really enjoy our meals. Trying the enchiladas, I also found that a little too spicy. I was curious and looked back over the menu to see if maybe I had just made a poor choice in ordering. For me, it had been between the mango pescado tacos with the \"mild\" chile rub and the baja pescado tacos that not only had mild rub but also a jalape\u00f1o ranch sauce. Clearly, I wanted to steer away from the jalape\u00f1os! Looking at other menu items, I saw the words \"mild\" and \"chile\" generously scattered throughout. It was enough to convince me that I would be unable to fully enjoy any of the food options offered here.This place has decent food if you enjoy spicy food, but what I enjoyed most was the atmosphere. If I ever came back it would just be for drinks. I won't judge all of San Antonio's Mexican food on just one restaurant, but so far Austin is winning on that front for me."], ["Lacy P.", "If you're a San Antonio local downtown in need of a snack and a good margarita, but you want to avoid the long lines of the Riverwalk, Barriba is for you.My hubby and I love coming downtown, but we hate waiting.

It was a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty empty for 7pm. We ordered chips, Queso and guacamole. The waiter took forever to take our drink order. He kept disappearing but finally came back. The drinks then took another eternity to come out. We had pretty much finished the chips and Queso and had to ask another waiter about the status of our drinks. We were sitting in plain sight of the bar and I'm not quite sure what the deal was. The menu is pretty limited- it's mostly tacos. I had the Mango pork tacos. While the flavor of the meat was tasty, the overall temperature of my food was pretty cold. I ended up just using my fork and picking around on the tacos more like a salad. One other note - they sprinkle cheese on their guacamole. So if you have any vegans in your group ask for it to be left off if you decide to try it out.Positives- decor is cool with Day of the Dead type images, neat light fixtures, live music playing, there is patio seating overlooking the Riverwalk, waiter was a nice guy (just kept disappearing), chips Queso and guac was good (thick chips that don't break!)Recommendation: I would not go back for dinner but maybe stop by for some chips and Queso and a drink during happy hour before moving on for the evening."], ["Son T.", "Authentic Mexican food and the River Walk go together like Donald Trump and subtlety.

They offer some nice variety in food here. I went with their signature Del Rey Tacos - \u00a0shredded marinated beef mixed in with a bounty of sheer deliciousness: chilies, pico, onions and cheese. All of the flavors were blended so well, without overwhelming the distinct, deep, rich flavor of the beef itself - exactly the way it should be.

We started out with the chips and queso which wasn't terrible but wasn't anything that I couldn't make myself with some velveta. Then I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which came with some pulled pork \" carnitas\" on top. The enchiladas tasted like tortillas warmed up with \u00a0Kraft cheese inside.

The jalape\u00f1o ranch was also spicy and I liked it a lot. I got the Del Ray Taco Platter--three tacos on small orange tortillas with shredded beef ($10.99).

Big parties are not her thing, so I stepped in to help make it a bit more special with the decorations and everything. They chose Barriba's as their reception site because they offered the best package deal as far as price for venue, drinks AND food. I want to start off with a few things I didn't totally like, but weren't necessarily bad. Food- we had them cater the reception, and pretty much did cheese enchiladas and fajitas, with a build your own taco station. The enchiladas weren't amazing, but the fajitas were wonderfully tender and delicious, and the black whole beans were seasoned nicely, although could possibly be too salty for some. I loved their thick, homemade style tortilla chips, but their salsas weren't my favorite. The red salsa was really spicy, which I personally like, but lacking flavor. And the salsa verde was really bland. Drinks- we did a cash bar, and the bartenders (and all staff, but more on that later) were very friendly. The drinks weren't fantastic though. The margarita on the rocks was a bit too sour. You can tell the restaurant most likely has a pretty strict policy on serving policy because they were careful to measure everything out and not over pour lolBooking- I did not get to work with Kimberly during the booking process, my the bride and groom told me she was very easy to work with. She was very responsive to all of their emails and calls, and she was able to accommodate them the best she could. My only dislike, and this has nothing to do with her, just the place itself, is their policy and where certain things have to be. We were able to arrange the tables as we liked, but they could not budge on where they bar had to be. They set up the bar right in front of this very picturesque stone archway, completely eliminating some great photo opts! It wasn't a deal breaker for us of course, but would have been nice if we could have had that spot free for guestsDecor- If you've seen the place, you know they style- very heavy on a ranchero/country style. They usually have cowhide print table cloths. The color theme we went with was purple, silver and black. I was worried this would clash horribly with the decor already there. Surprise, IT DIDN'T! They were able to provide plain white linens for the table cloths, and we rented our own table runners and chair covers and sashes. That, along with the decorations we brought, which were kept to a minimal, really focused on OUR decor, and you didn't pay attention to everything else going on. Now, if you are planning a wedding where everything has to be a T and all tie in together, then you might not be able to get past all the stuff they have going. We didn't need things to be perfect, just nicely done. And if you're planning a rustic/country style wedding, well this venue is too perfect for you.Staff- If I could give an extra half star I would. The staff was AMAZING! They were always very accommodating, very professional, and very friendly. Where they really shined, and this is also where I felt they truly went above and beyond, was helping at the end for clean up. As I mentioned, they provided the table cloths, and we rented a third party for the table runners and chair covers and sashes. When we were ready to pack up, they were a tremendous help, without us even asking! They removed all the rented materials. We had vases with fake flowers and pebbles in them, filled with water as the center pieces, and they helped empty all of them of the water so that we could pack up. I was really pleased with how helpful and courteous they were. Overall, I would definitely recommend them to the right group. If you are OK with their decor, they offer a great space for medium-larger functions, including weddings. Their location isn't prime, but still a solid location on the Riverwalk with very competitive pricing, and you get a lot of bang for your buck here. The food isn't spectacular, but their top-notch service team will help make everything go smoothly with no disruptions."], ["Marielle T.", "Overpriced, but probably because it is on Riverwalk. Our server was excellent, but food was subpar. The best dish we got was the queso. The cucuy margaritas are strong and delish."], ["David G.", "Had dinner here tonight. My wife ordered the garden salad and I had the Alamo Bowl. She also ordered the Pi\u00f1a Rita and I had some lousy drink that I don't remember the name of. The garden salad was much more than just a garden salad. It had two of the best deviled eggs I or my wife had ever tasted, zesty ranch with a bit of a kick and many other vegetarian living things. The Alamo bowl was a mixture of beef with a kick and some of the best Mexican stuff I've ever eaten. The service was incredible and the live music was a good topper!"], ["Pao L.", "We had the following: Chips with Salsa: Most tex-mex places give you this for free but on this location they charge you a minimal cost for them. They give you three different small salsas to go with your chips. Overall the salsas are good and the chips are great. Queso: this is a must try. It was in the spicy side but not overpowering overall the queso was delicious. The frozen margs were semi decent and the tacos were average. However, considering the rest of the places on the river walk I would rank this higher than the rest of the average cost tex-mex places located on the river walk.... Enjoy!"], ["Katie W.", "Location- street side and up off the river walk so you don't have all the people walking right past you.Interior- it's a lil divey, not good for large groups.

Drip, drip, \"was that a bird?\"Food- checked in with Yelp, got a free queso, thumbs up! Spicy and delicious with yummy tortilla chips topped with cheese shavings. { I would def. order again}I also had the cheese enchiladas topped with brisket chili, MM good!! The black beans and rice it came with were also FAB, full of flavor. Unlike those other crappy \"original\" \"Mexican\" you know what I'm talking about along the Riverwalk. Skip those and eat here, if you are looking to eat for flavor.Drink- Moscow Mule, Ooooo we!! You better like ginger because after the drink goes down you have that \" bitter beer face\" mixed with \"I think I like it though!\" Service- Dude was weird, like John Lovitz, you know..

The river walking crowds (touristy crowds) don't seem to gravitate to street level either, so this place was not as crowded. The food was delicious and service was excellent.

I liked the flavor of the ancho cream sauce but was glad I asked for it on the side since it was pretty heavy. everyone else seemed to also think their food was okay, but no one cleared their plate."], ["Alondra G.", "Awesome choice of sexy, live music.

Even my son's beef on the quesadilla was way too spicy to be on a child's plate. Also, I had to pay $3 for salsa (tomato, jalape\u00f1o ranch, tomatillo) which we find strange considering in Houston this is free at all Tex Mex restaurants. I would not advise families to eat here especially if they are adverse to spicy foods (my daughter likes spicy food but the cheese enchiladas that she shared with my wife were even too spicy for her). I love spicy food but the meat chili on my cheese enchiladas overpowered any other taste."], ["Mike A.", "Food is good, a little expensive for what you get but to be expected on the river walk.

Starting with menus with dried food on them to the bird crap on the dining room chair. The place is hopping, and their business no doubt \u00a0will remain good given their location but really!

This really bothered me while thinking how unprofessional and shady it was. Of course once I looked at the menu, the drink she tried to sell me was the most expensive of all the drinks on the entire menu.Queso was good that came with the check In offer - spicy so keep tissues handy!

It's just good old fashioned Mexican comfort food. Nothing fancy. Just good food. They also have fresh juices. My daughter ordered a pineapple juice and it came in a very large glass, freshly squeezed, or whatever they do to pineapples to get the juice out. This place satisfies even the pickiest of eaters, aka, my daughter. She is a fan of their crispy tacos and even got a side of pork chop. I was thinking I should have ordered that too. It looked good. My boyfriend ordered the fajita tacos and those were some big, manly tacos. He was very happy with them. He could only eat two. I saved the third and made homemade nachos out of the meat for dinner.

Excellent and very large meal, usually when you order Verdes there isn't any other sauce on them, but these had Mexican gravy as well. I actually enjoyed the edge this took off the sweet sauce. Came with rice (oranges with carrots and potatoes), beans, and lettuce and tomato to mix in. Others at the table ordered Posole, enjoyable and made with pork, and the Enchiladas Rojas. My father-in-law swears by the fajita tacos, he says the meat has a smoky quality fresh off the grill.To top it all off, they have the BEST sopapillas!

Overpriced and not good enough to warrant the price at all. Bartender literally doused my drink in tequila and my husbands barely had any at all. Inconsistent and messy delivery. We were an afterthought to the bartender, who was busy attempting to flirt with another employee. Hostesses were not very friendly, and a little rude, but our waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable, and polite. Food was interesting, and I don't mean that in a good way. I couldn't quite figure out where the flavor profiles were originating from. It was a little all over the place. Let me try and break it down:I know they advertise as upscale authentic Mexican food, but I found the menu items to be more of a upper class white person's idea of what Mexican food is. Was it good? Yes. Was it amazing? No. Our salsa was intensely smokey, almost to the point of not edible, and I say that hesitantly because neither my husband nor myself are ever shy around heat and smoke. We usually love it, but there was no balance in the flavors. \u00a0Chips were nice and thick, maybe too thick. Where they score high marks: sauces. Mole was tasty, and Verde enchilada sauce was also excellent. Where I think they fall short are the appetizers and entree accompaniments. We ordered the queso, and it was literally a bowl of rubbery, room temperature cheese that had started to break, meaning the grease and liquid of the cheese mixture had broken away from the cheese and was creating a layer of orange sludge on top of our queso. It was hard to eat with the chips and we eventually gave up. I know authentic Mexican food doesn't necessarily mean Tex Mex queso, but it doesn't mean what we got either. Again, it confused me. Entree sides... the beans, rice, salads, veggies, and tortillas, all seem to be on the bland side and the tortilla was nothing special to me. My husbands fish was also overcooked. I also took a look around the dining area, and all I saw were 25-50 year old Caucasians. Never trust a Mexican restaurant Mexicans don't eat at.

The food, service, and atmosphere were impeccable. Paloma Blanca stood out in all the categories in a part of the country where excellent Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen. Food - My litmus test for a Mexican restaurant I've never tried before is always chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. This place knocked them out of the water. Chicken was well-cooked, not watery as tends to happen with shredded chicken. The tortilla was also great but what really impressed me was the mole sauce. Perfectly salty, spicy and smoky with just a touch of chocolatey. Service - Wonderfully attentive wait staff. My water cup was never empty. I ordered a margarita and I was pushed ever so tactfully into buying another one. No qualms. It's usually easier to write a service review when it's bad service. Definitely not the case in this situation. Atmosphere - Paloma Blanca is tucked away in a strip mall of sorts. I hesitate to call it that because strip mall doesn't do the ambiance and elegance of the restaurant justice. The restaurant had a beautifully shaded patio which was comfortable even during the midday sun. Inside the restaurant walls were tiled in a tasteful white mosaic tile with art from local artist along the walls and ledges. On one end, an exposed brick wall along with weathered wood beams and cast iron details gave the restaurant a somewhat rustic, old world southwestern vibe with a touch of class. The decor was perfect balance of rough and clean. Paloma Blanca was a wonderful experience that I would recommend to anyone in San Antonio for any reason."], ["Luke N.", "One of the most reliable \"high class\" TexMex in SA. Good happy hour from 3-6 m-f with drinks and appetizers."], ["Maretchel J.", "Just stopped in for dessert (after a strong recommendation from a San Antonio local) saw their chocolate tres leches cake online and HAD to order it! Did not disappoint at all! \u00a0also sat outside in their patio which was beautiful even though it looked out into the parking lot. Lol would definitely come back if in town again!"], ["Courtney H.", "This Texan girl knows Tex-Mex and this is the best in town!My go-to is the chicken enchiladas verdes. I normally love veggie enchiladas, but I don't love their version. That is okay, because the rest of the menu is incredible. I take guests here often because out-of-towners love to experience Tex-Mex and there is something here for everyone. Other things I love here:-the patio (when it isn't one thousand degrees out)- enchiladas divorciados-pollo caldo-margaritas"], ["Antonio G.", "Where to start, First things first I wished I discovered this beautiful hidden gem Paloma Blanca like 3 years ago instead of always just driving by it on Broadway, and who would of knew that it would become one of Best Authentic Mexican Restaurants in San Antonio in my Opinion. Me and my date decided we wanted Mexican food and got bored of going to the regular Mex Restaurants we always frequently go to so we decided on Paloma Blanca. At first for some people new to San Antonio it can be a lil hidden off Broadway but once you pull in into the parking lot you will see its busy and packed. The Building itself is nothing special they have a outside patio and a drive thru to pick up food.The True Essence and Beauty of Paloma Blanca what is Inside, when you first step inside your overwhelmed of how welcoming and beautiful it is. A Fire place, sofas and nice luxury lounge, very cozy. There seems to be 3 different rooms you can select to dine at me and my date sat in the 3rd room.The atmosphere here can range from all sorts of class of people, tourists, local, business,college, 09ers etc. As for settings this place is ideal for for dates, anniversaries, birthdays, business meetings or any other sort of celebrations too if you need to bring alot of guests with you.The Food is amazing, a great wide of different mexican dishes that are actually Authentic and not Tex Mex. Their Salsa is superb that they serve one roasted and other mild and chips homemade. The Service is A+ our waiter was friendly, asked us if we had any questions about the menu, and checked back with us in timely manner. My date orded the flautas and I ordered the Ceviche, we waited for about 15-20 mins for food to come out and it was worth it. The portion sizes are big, and you get your moneys worth, Ceviche freshly made and tastes great. Even the price of food is fairly cheap for this type of quality of food. If Your Interested in Drinks they have a wide selection too from Margaritas, Tequilas etc. But it was too early for us to be drinking. Overall I will be going back, and had a great experience here. Food, service i would rate A+. Only con maybe will be that its just alil slow for food to come out but I dont see nothing else I can think of. The prices on their menu I LOVE because they are fairly cheap but for great quality food compared to other places, if anything Paloma Blanca never change the prices please lol.If Your visiting San Antonio and looking for a great welcoming, luxurious, cozy atmosphere and not some hole in the wall mexican restaurant and something different but with still great Authentic Mexican food not Tex Mex I recommend you to go to Paloma Blanca."], ["Hannah W.", "The food is good but certainly not the best tex mex in town. However, their patio is beautiful, the drinks are amazing, and the service is impeccable. Those three things combined more than make up for the small failings in the food. I never go without ordering a Mexican Michelada. Theirs is perfection!"], ["James S.", "Having been here multiple times over the years, I'm basing this review as an overall average of my experiences. If I were to review based on my most recent visit, this place would get one star. Again, as an overall average:ProsNice ambianceGood chips & salsaFast bartendersGood foodConsInattentive and slow service by waitstaffUnnecessarily long wait timesBased on my experience last night, I don't see myself returning to Paloma Blanca anytime soon. The quoted wait time was 45 minutes for a party of six, ended up waiting 55 minutes and we were literally the only ones who waited, they sat parties of 2-4 immediately the whole time. When I inquired, no one would give me a reason why they just said, \"Your table is almost ready\", even though I could so they were just unwilling to move tables. Our waiter was the passive aggressive type, he'd joke and give you hard time but it wasn't funny and he clearly did not want to be at work. Our drink re-fills never came and even after he dropped off the bill, he took a long time to take the payment. With all the options, especially in the Broadway/Downtown area, I don't see the appeal in Paloma anymore, I'd rather go elsewhere."], ["Keely T.", "I was introduced to Paloma Blanca by family, and I'm so glad I was! The staff is great and friendly. I love how they make the guacamole table side! I had the chicken fajitas, and they were amazing! I also love how you sub vegetables for rice. You must stop by if you love authentic Mexican food, an awesome staff, and an even better atmosphere."], ["Sarah F.", "My husband and I ate here and for a weekend and we were seated right away! The atmosphere was fun with old Spanish doors and live music. The food was good; the guac was outstanding! Our house margaritas were delicious as well. The only reason I give three stars is our service was not the best. We had to wait fifteen minutes just to order drinks, and we're not given any silverware. But I think we will still return and give it another shot."], ["C M.", "I grew up in San Antonio, \u00a0so I am very critical of Mexican food. \u00a0For the record, (1) I firmly believe that Tex-Mex is not really Mexican food--it's a variation, at best. (2) It's easy to make, and kind of ubiquitous. There are tex-mex and Mexican restaurants ALL over San Antonio, and the menus are pretty much identical. So the point is, it's hard to impress me in this regard. That said, Paloma Blanca is the real deal. The only reason this place lost a star was because it was just a little too pricey. But the food was 200% spot-on. The one measure of any Mexican or tex-mex joint is always their torilla soup. Paloma Blanca nailed it, with hands-down some of the best I've ever had. They put chincharron in it. If you don't know what that is, (1) look it up and (2) wipe that WTF look off your face. \u00a0It was AMAZING. I also had the chicken with poblano cream sauce...also awesome. \u00a0Chips and salsa: awesome. \u00a0Service: awesome. Atmosphere: awesome. \u00a0I honestly cannot remember the last time I had Mexican food where it actually tasted authentic and that I didn't walk away with a \"meh\" feeling.This is now my go-to joint for out-of-towners who want good Mexican food. \u00a0End of line."], ["Quyen C.", "We ordered the ceviche and fajita plate.

From San Diego and understand what great Mexican food tastes like. The food was really good, cannot complain there. Had chicken fajitas and they were delicious. Beans and rice were good too. Salsa was subpar.The hostesses and waiting area were great too. Unfortunately, the service was so extremely unattentive that I will never go back. I mean, literally the worst. I have 3 kids, was given 2 adult menus and the server never mentioned kid menus. Why should I have to ask? Turns out they ran out. That's fine, but tell me you have one. Then you bring drinks and immediately leave when I'm ready to order. Then refills never come and you shove my tortilla container into my guacamole and blow it off? Then it takes 20 mins after I'm done to bring my check or see about us. Last review...minute maid lemonade? Come on...let's learn how to make it fresh."], ["Eline M.", "Loved my dinner there!Service was really attentive, topped our waters very often which is something I always look out for in restaurants (I just drink so much water, ok...) We got seated outside which was a nice way to enjoy the \"colder\" (really just \"a little less hot than during the day\") night temperature in San Antonio.I had the enchiladas verdes and yum! They were absolutely delicious and not drowned in some weird sauce like I've seen it done in other Mexican restaurants. The chicken inside was very tender, it just melted in your mouth. It was served with guacamole on the side and oh my god, what an amazing guacamole! Will definitely try to come back again and this time have their table side prepared guacamole -- they serve it as a starter, it's a bit on the pricey side but the portion looked huge from what I saw around me. Speaking of portions, I was super hungry but still had trouble finishing my plate!I definitely wanna go back and explore their menu more!"], ["Michael B.", "We have lived in San Antonio for three years.

I had never had it before and it was served with fresh tortillas. Also, since we went on a Sunday, there was a special on the mimosas which was a nice touch. For my main course, I ordered the (and please forgive me if this isn't how it's spelled!) \"divorciadas\" enchiladas and my goodness they were the BEST enchiladas I have ever had!

The problem we encountered was with the service.We had what appeared to be a very (very) young waiter who spoke maybe 15 words to us. We had to ask for chips and salsa (how is this not given once a customer is seated?), we had to ask for every drink refill (not alcohol, just water and tea,) and the waiter's entire service just reeked of disinterest. For the premium price you're paying here, the service could afford to be improved.

Certainly not enough to make you stay on purpose- not that these guys need your business when they've got an industrial complex of mediocre Tex Mex to churn out to the thousands lining up behind you.

Fajitas are $$$$.95 Food portions are surprisingly \"normal\" sized portions and not the extra large meals we are used to in Tex Mex. I ate my entire plate except for the frijoles.- Chips and salsa are probably a 2/5 on the chip and salsa scale. Their \"roasted\" one tastes like I put my piehole on a chimney stack. Red and the tomatillo taste like canned vegetable bases, and considering how much food they turn out every hour, it probably makes more sense than doing it fresh. Fresh requires prep, which requires a lot of labor. Chips are thick. - Chicken enchiladas with mole- enjoyable to eat, but you gotta like the cinnamony sweetness of mole. I can't eat that much of the stuff, but my brother can.- Mexican combo plate- tamale is actually quite enjoyable to eat! Everything else is fine, not great.

Aside from the festive atmosphere, the service is excellent and on point, too.The food isn't bad at all; I enjoyed my mole enchiladas, my sister's tamale, and the tortillas Mi Tierra pounds out, but for the most part, I've definitely had better chips and salsa elsewhere, and the prices here are quite steep for similar quality Mexican elsewhere.Actually, the food here straddles a very fine line between Mexican and Tex-Mex. I would actually argue a lot of their food is Tex-Mex, buuuut that's just being nitpicky.Which reminds me of the wait. I didn't expect such a long wait for Mexican food, especially considering how cavernous this restaurant is.

Luckily I was able to bypass this distraction and as my group made our way into the main eating area, I couldn't help but notice how large Mi Tierra actually is. It's huge, crowded, loud - but most important, everyone looks to be having a great time. The Zapata and pomegranate margaritas were great (I even combined both and enjoyed it) but I thought the food was mediocre. I went with the chicken quesadilla and it hit the spot, but the only thing that really impressed me about it was that it came with sour cream. Was I disappointed? Yes - I had better quesadillas at a food truck in Connecticut!In my opinion, Mi Tierra lacks true authenticity and can be seen as a tourist trap with the strolling mariachis asking to play you music for $6. BUT (there is always a but) the service was great and food came out quick so I would go back (considering my friends rave about this place)."], ["Jinny H.", "My first reaction to Mi Tierra was that the restaurant experience was going to be awesome, since the decorations were absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, bright lights, and so many other elements amounted to a great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food didn't work well with me. It was too salty, and the quality of the food wasn't the best; I didn't get much satisfaction from eating at that restaurant. Moreover, it wasn't just me that thought so... my parents agreed that it wasn't the best place to go for the taste of food.I would have given Mi Tierra 3.5 stars, but rounded it up to 4 because of the nice service despite the large amount of people - we went on a Friday, and although it was crowded, the server made sure to take care of us. Overall: great atmosphere, decoration, and nice enough service, but the food wasn't all that great. I might go back, but it's pretty unlikely."], ["Shawn C.", "Alas how sad... the once 5 stars I awarded Mi Tierra I have no choice but to downgrade them to 3 stars.Breakfast this morning was only mediocre at best. We both had dishes that were supposed to contain 2 scrambled eggs, but I think that it was more like 1 egg if that. I understand that because of the Avian Flu problem that egg costs skyrocketed, but don't just skimp on something that is supposed to be the main ingredient. When you have an 2 egg scramble with meat... the eggs are supposed to be the chief ingredient (i.e. a little meat with your eggs). Instead there was just enough egg to act as a binder to hold the grow of food together. So instead of on egg dish, I had a cheese and mushy tortillas strip dish, and my wife had gummy chorizo glob.Instead of cutting the quality of your food to cut cost, inform customers of the egg issue and add a temporary surcharge (50 cents) per egg dish to cover your added expenses until the problem is resolved.We also saw that they had Pumpkin spiced doughnuts and picked up 2 to go. While tasty, we're so disappointed because they were not doughnuts, but instead soft single sized Bunt Cakes. I was so looking forward to a doughnut with a crispy outside and soft cake interior... this was not the case. Plus their doughnuts were $1.25 a piece... which was a little expensive for the size as well.I'm sorry I made my wife come here for breakfast this morning instead of eating at our hotel or going to Embassy Suites's breakfast buffet."], ["Dave C.", "Food-wise, it's a spot on 4. Decor is a spot on 4; I love the stereotypical, almost campy vibe. The wandering mariachis seem kind of annoying, but when they leave, I miss their music. The bakery, an easy 5. Why the three stars? If you have to go to the restroom, you'll loose your lunch. After years of working in a lab, my sense of smell is almost gone, but this almost made me gag. It's that bad. Hey Mi Tierra! Y'all ever hear of Clorox? Ammonia? Peroxide? Lysol even??? Go buy some!!!"], ["Emily R.", "I'll admit I was a little hesitant to try the place after reading previous reviews but our experience was actually really great!This place really has such a great ambiance and folkloric look to it. As others reviews mention it's a big restaurant with lots to look at. We're talking pi\u00f1ata covered ceilings and other festive decorations that make it look like there's always a party going on. Murals at every turn loved the decor over all.I got the botana platter (appetizer platter) that came with flautas, chicken quesadilla, and beef tostadas. Very tasty quesadillas the flautas were a little hard but still good and the mini tosadas were delicious as well. I also got a Peach Margarita which had the right amount of alcohol kick to it. Boyfriend got the green chili chicken enchiladas and those really hit the spot! Juicey and delicious most likely some of the tastiest enchiladas we've had in a while. Service was really fast and friendly! Mariachi singers come by and ask if you want a song from time to time but it wasn't a bother. Make sure and stop by the bakery afterwards for some take home goodies. The Mexican hot chocolate was amazing! Just like mom makes around Christmas time."], ["L D.", "Great atmosphere, but food was a big let down. \u00a0Service was a mix bag. \u00a0We got better service from the guy who wasn't even our waiter than our waitress who disappears when you need something. \u00a0 Isn't that always the case? \u00a0Probably not come back."], ["Splashing D.", "Muy Picante at Mi Tierra!Stopped by this San Antonio tourist staple a few weeks back to settle in for some southwest Tex-Mex. There seems to be multiple seating areas here which we didn't realize until we left. Our hostess put us in the brighter front section which was fine but we'd request the darker back area if we went back.Our beautiful and vivacious server Diana started us off with chips and salsa and an ice cold beverage as we decided on enchilada plates. The food was actually quite good but there is something in the sauce here that just did not agree with our digestive system and made itself known in a not-so subtle fashion a few hours later. You're also gonna definitely wanna avoid that dipping salsa that comes with the chips or you'll be getting better acquainted with your toilet later on.All in all, still a fun and festive place if you you choose your menu items judiciously. Mariachis everywhere raising hell. Never checked out the bakery but probably should have. Probably won't go back as this is one a those places that usually only warrants a one time visit."], ["Jessica T.", "I was so eager to try this place out. I have always heard great things about this place but I have to say I was very disappointed. The first thing I look forward to is the chips and salsa. Well the chips tasted like they were store bought and the salsa tasted like pace picante sauce. We all ordered sprites and they all came back tasting old and flat. So we went ahead an ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and it was just a very odd tasting enchilada none I've had before. We took a few bites and left the rest. The only thing we as a group were happy with was the rice and beans and homemade tortillas. Won't be back here again."], ["Elvis M.", "Having chorizo con huevo breakfast at Mi Tierra it was very tasty and a lot of chorizo in my eggs.

Unfortunately, the fiance and I had a very different experience than from the rest of the people who have posted these reviews. I ordered the menudo and after 2-3 spoonfuls I could not eat it any longer, it had to have been the most unsatisfying menudo I have ever had, the stench coming from it completely killed my appetite.

It's right in the heart of Market Square, and no doubt it gives off the tourist beacon. Normally I avoid these places in fear of the tourist trap, but honestly, Mi Tierra just looked so cool I couldn't help myself. To start, the chips and salsa were pretty disappointing.

This was literally one of our first stops after flying in to San Antonio. We'd never been here before, but noticed a large number of reviews and a wide range of opinions regarding this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try for a few of the following reasons: 1. We were hungry and wanted Mexican cuisine. 2. We wanted to see the Riverwalk area / Historic Market. 3 We are tourists 4. We read so many polorizing reviews on Yelp for Mi Tierra that we decided to just give it a try ourselves.On with the review...Mi Tierra can be a little tricky to find if you're \u00a0unfamiliar with downtown San Antonio. Although the GPS brought us here, still had to call for clarification for directions. The hostess on the telephone was kind and gave pretty accurate directions using landmarks since we didn't know the street names. The front of the restaurant is facing a small historic market. We almost opted for street parking, but we are glad that we didn't because we learned that a small parking lot is available for patrons (BEWARE ... the parking lot is narrow. Our rental got two scratches while parked). So if you enter from the parking lot, you will see the most beautiful display of Mexican baked goods and notice a large sign guiding traffic for patrons who wish to dine-in. As the \u00a0photographs display, Mi Tierra is very festive. and colorful. During our time there, we saw (and were approached by) several musicians. Should you wish, they will play a song for pay. Inside the lobby, directly across from the bakery display, we also saw two nuns selling religious memorabilia to support their church in Mexico. We purchased a St. Christopher key chain. Our food was good. I ordered vegetarian enchiladas which were not on the menu, but were recommended by our waiter after a brief discussion. They were really tasty and I would not mind ordering again on a future visit. My mother ordered a taco. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \u00a0I was looking forward to trying this restaurant and I was not disappointed. I got a huge slice of the tres leche cake and it was OUTSTANDING.From reading previous reviews, it seems that many of the locals do not consider this \"good\" mexican food, as San Antonio is home to many, many Mexican restaurants. And, as a result, this does not fall in the \"best\" category. However, for an Upstate New Yorker with a somewhat unrefined palette, when it comes to Mexican cuisine, this hit the spot for \u00a0one time try."], ["Paul R.", "First impression... crowded. \u00a0The staff will tell you a wait time when they hand you your buzzer..sit back and relax..it's a lie.

Major props to the staff \u00a0for getting us a nice little area in a back room. \u00a0Several tables were aligned for us and we were seated at about 11 ish with a view of the market square. \u00a0Now, I didn't count the number in out party, but there were easily 30 of us and we were assigned one waiter for the right side of the table and one waitress for the left side. \u00a0Those of us on the left had the windows behind us, this didn't leave a heck of a lot of room for the waitress to walk up and down and I am sure it was very difficult with trays of drinks and food, but she did an amazing job! \u00a0She was fast and efficient at taking orders and and managed to get everything right. She was AMAZING. \u00a0The waiter on the other side of the table was not as fast or efficient and messed up a couple of orders, but he did a good job considering the size of our party. It did take quite a while to get water and refills out for the table. By the time we were ordering it was almost noon. \u00a0Luckily they serve breakfast all day. I ordered breakfast tacos (which strangely are not offered on the menu). \u00a0They were fantastic. \u00a0Delicious tortillas generously stuffed with potatoes and eggs and beans and cheese. \u00a0i was happy and content. \u00a0Along with my tacos, I had the most gigantic mango chamoy margarita. \u00a0i don't always have a margarita for breakfast, but when do, it will always be this one! \u00a0I am not even a fan of a frozen margarita, but this was the margarita to put all others to shame. \u00a0Had I know it was going to be that good, I would have taken another one in stead of the tacos. \u00a0Everyone in my vicinity seemed to be happy with their food and drink choices. There were complaints of the coffee not being hot, but the wait staff were quick to refill (not replace, so coffee pretty much stayed lukewarm). \u00a0Departure time: about 1:45 p.m. That was a long time. Clearly they are able to accommodate super large crowds and still do a good job. \u00a0The food is good and the drinks are fantastic. \u00a0It can be a little pricey for Mexican food, but that's expected for a touristy spot. For me, the crowds and clutter is a bit overwhelming, but people obviously enjoy it since it's always crowded."], ["Olivia E.", "I love Mi Tierra. While this isn't exactly authentic Mexican food it is definitely authentic tex-mex cuisine. Tons of people gather here for family dinners all the time. While the wait might look long, I've never waited more than 30min for a table. It's a huge restaurant, bar and bakery all in one and it's open 24/7. Serving Mexican dishes and Mexican breakfast all day everyday. I've been here several times with many different groups of friends and family. I'll be back again. Service is awesome and food comes out quickly. Prices are moderately for the amount of food you get. Enjoy!"], ["Caitlyn S.", "I have to say, for a place recommended to \"take tourists\"...your family and friends are going to be disappointed. And if they aren't disappointed, it only means that they don't know what they're missing from this great city.The decor is crazy colorful and bright, so it makes for a pretty overwhelming experience. There are people everywhere too. The line for the panaderia is also by the front entrance, so it just adds to the chaotic atmosphere.I will say, even though it was crazy crowded, we were able to get seated pretty quickly. Our server was nice and polite, and he accommodated my crazy wishes to have something without meat. He basically let me create my own dish. I can't remember what I had, but I do remember thinking that it wasn't that good. We stopped at the panaderia on the way out to get a little dessert. The line moved quickly, although you better know what you want when you get up there because they want to keep up the pace. I think my friend ordered some sort of pumpkin empanada, which was delicious, and whatever I ordered was pretty good as well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming to Mi Tierra for the food. There are so so many better places close by that you and your guests will love. But if you want a sweet treat, the bakery will probably have what you want for a reasonable price. You won't feel like you're missing out on a SATX \"staple\" and you can still enjoy a meal elsewhere."], ["J J.", "Ignore the reviews about it being a tourist trap. It was all locals when I stopped by for an early dinner (3pm). Atmosphere is fun. Food was good. Service..... Well, jeez, the ladies were all AARP eligible.

The service never sleeps! The excitement never ends! And the tourists never stop coming! A fantastic place to get authentic Tex-Mex food and handmade sugary sweet bakery treats! I recommend everyone to stop by and see the fun vibrant lights and decorations! Taste the unbelievable mouth-watering food that will send your taste buds on a joy ride wanting more :)The wait was not bad (30 minutes), even though the restaurant was filled with anxious, hungry people. They asked for my phone number to send an alert when a table has opened so that we could be seated. I thought that was pretty creative because I've never seen that before. Starting off my meal with chips and salsa. The salsa is so savory, I could taste all the mild spices and flavors in it! I kept getting my salsa bowl refilled.For my main course, I ordered the Enchilada Dinner, which consisted of: two cheese enchiladas, rice, and refried beans with sprinkled cheese on top. Handmade tortillas came with my meal too. Everything was cooked to perfection, with tons of cheese added as well! Just the way I like it :-) Desserts are just around the wall, literally! Just grab a number and wait for your number to be called, you'll be served quickly once it's your turn. All of the bakery desserts sold in Mi Tierra are fresh, really sweet, and appetizing! Many delightful items to choose from! Overall, The service is average. The hostesses are very friendly and eager to seat you. The servers are polite and more than welcome to serve you. Sometimes, you'll need to get your waiter's attention if you need a refill on your drink or food. Also, the Mariachi Band and individual singers, come around asking if you would like them to play a song, you MUST tip them after they play their song, but you can hear them throughout the restaurant. Just watch and listen from a far, it's like getting a free show :D But other then that, this place is great! I am definitely coming back when I get the chance and would recommend this place to everyone that loves Tex-Mex food!"], ["Dave J.", "Food anytime!Hint: parking is tough. There is a small lot in front or street parking directly across the street. It's a one way street so keep an eye out on the right as you approach.Huge bakery with goods 24/7. Food was great and delivered fast! Enchilada was great. Asada was above average but not life changing. Good beans! We also had the key lime pie. It was frozen so let it defrost for a few minutes but it wasn't bad. There are a plethora of guitar players that will solicit you for a song. It happened 5 different times during our meal. It was a bit disturbing but they were very cordial and nice when we declined.We'll be back for late hour treats."], ["Lauren S.", "I do agree that this is a tourist place, but I wanted the experience. Plus it was Fiesta! Getting into this place was like Fort Knox. No outside booze, no beverages (i had to surrender my fiji water), bag checks, cops everywhere. It makes the place seem a bit suspect. What kind of people are trying to come in here? What could possibly be happening in this bakery/restaurant?So me and my hot lady date scored a table with no wait, which was awesome. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas and we both got puffy tacos. She ordered chicken and I got beef and we swapped one with each other. The taco shell has been fried and it puffs up (hence the name) so it's full of greasy goodness and it's not easy to eat. I went all or nothing and accepted the fact that I would have a messy taco experience. The chicken was juicy and the beef had a nice seasoning. The rice and beans were a bit flavorless, but that was remedied by pouring some of the salsa verde on them and mixing them up. After dinner we headed to the bakery. Mind you, if you want to use the restroom don't leave the main dining area. You'll have to go back through all the check points just to pee. The bakery has case after case filled with Mexican sugary goodness. We got 2 of the sugar cookies, 2 wedding cookies, some pumpkin candy and a few pastries. I loved the pumpkin candy and the sugar cookies the best. The other items were a bit dry. It's a fun experience and I'll definitely be back!"], ["Carson E.", "If you're coming to San Antonio for some authentic Mexican food, then mi tierra caf\u00e9 Y panade\u00eda is totally the best place to be.

The dinng room had a wait so we ordered beverages in the bar. After a day of sightseeing I was ravishing hungry and ordered the Botana platter which consisted of taquitos, \u00a0quesadillas and mini tacos. Unfortunately my name was called for the dining room but the younger waitress would not accommodate bringing the platter over even though it wasn't ready. Her excuse was she had other tables to attend to and could not assist me. She also insisted we wait for the platter and close the tap before we departed to the dinning room - I tipped her accordingly!In the dining room I received just the opposite service from a young waiter who was patient and accomodating while we enjoyed our appetizer platter. \u00a0I ended up ordering a machaca entree which included house made flour tortillas, beans and potatoes. \u00a0The entree was yummy \u00a0- especially the bomb flour tortillas!

First of all, the margaritas are 10/10. They could not have been better, and the bartender who made them was charming and fun. The wait was a little long, so we enjoyed some pastries from the bakery and waited a while. We were glad we did. It's not the most authentic or best Mexican in San Antonio by a long shot, but she service is friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and the prices are reasonable. I had the steak ranchero with a cheese enchilada. The food was flavorful and an excellent meal overall. If you're in Market Square the place is worth a visit. Skip the Tres Leches, I've had far better from H-E-B, but do have a drink and enjoy the handmade tortillas and excellent hospitality at Mi Tierra."], ["Dave M.", "Excellent food, and service was very good. Mi Tierra is a San Antonio institution... yes it looks like a tourist trap stuck in between Christmas and Fiesta. But, for Tex-Mex, this place is the best you'll find in downtown San Antonio, and is open 24x7. \u00a0Not sure why, but my wife and I just love the crazy decor and ambiance. Our favorite time to go to Mi Tierra is when the temperature outside is in the 30s and we get there just as the sun comes up to have breakfast. Breakfast is awesome... huevos rancheros, migas, chillaquilles, everything they serve for breakfast is awesome... and if you're really into it like I am, you cannot beat their Menudo!!!Service has always been good... they don't hover, but they keep the drinks full and check on you just enough. And then there is the Mexican pastry and candy counter... omg! \u00a0If I didn't put a limit on my wife's spending, she would spend half my paycheck at the pastry and candy counter. The BEST Mexican pastry in SA!If you haven't been here, this is a must try in SA."], ["Mike B.", "A visit to Mi Tierra is an experience more than a meal. This is the place to bring friends from out of town to show them what a \"Mexican restaurant\" is like. There's artwork on every surface, some of which is actually very good. Mariachis work the room, serenading the se\u00f1ores y se\u00f1oras. The food is decent, but it's really not any better than what you would get in any one of a hundred other taquerias in town. One thing that really sets it apart is the sheer scope of the menu. If they don't have it here, it probably doesn't exist. And, of course, the bakery is the stuff of legends.This restaurant is extremely crowded on the weekend, so you can expect to wait an hour for your table. But the service is fast once you're seated. If you haven't been to Mi Tierra, you owe it to yourself to check out this San Antonio institution at least once."], ["Dung N.", "Everything in Texas is huge! I got a giant concha to bring back home for my bf and ordered half a dozen tamales to go at the bakery side of the restaurant. The decorations in this restaurant are very pretty and colorful. We were in a rush so we didn't get to enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant, which is also huge. The workers there are also very friendly and I even took pics with one of the waitresses. My bf and his family loved the Mexican sweet bread I gave him and now they are on the hunt to find big conchas LOL. As for the tamales, they weren't bad, but I've had better.

We are all not from Texas so our IDs are from different states and they are very strict so make sure you remember the address shown on the ID because they ask you a bunch of questions.

I wouldn't try the barbacoa beef cheeks (slow cooker style) kind of like a pulled meat style; it was a bit watery and was missing spices \u00a0- you have to like that kind of meat -it's not like regular brisket. If you try it you should add onions and spices!!!Their eggs are fabulous. You need to ask for the green hot sauce.

Recently took some out-of-town visitors here for dinner and it was incredibly disappointing. Going off the reviews we'd heard about this restaurant my guests and I were expecting so much better. If I had been the only one disappointed by the food I would have just assumed it was from living in SA and being spoiled by all the great Mexican restaurants I have to choose from, but my guests also found the food and service to be wholly uninspiring. The drinks we ordered weren't bad, but they definitely weren't worth $10+ and there was nothing on the drink specials list that you couldn't find at every other bar in SA. Our waiter was rather pushy and pretty much ignored us as soon as a bigger party arrived. The food wasn't anything to write home about, especially the ceviche, which was quite possibly the worst ceviche I've ever tasted.The only real plus about Acenar that I could find was its location right on the river, beyond that I would suggest you steer clear. There are SO many better places you can eat downtown, don't fall for this tourist trap!"], ["Erin J.", "Ridiculously priced Margaritas and the manager count not explain the crazy price tag! Outrageous! So disappointing! Never again!"], ["D B.", "Stopped here my 1st day in town for happy hour went back everyday for happy hour. \u00a0Bartender Mike was great and gave me tips on all the places to check out in town. \u00a0Drinks were great and prices good too."], ["Heather J.", "In town for the weekend and decided to have some drinks at the bar where the bartenders were friendly and made great drinks as well as drink recommendations.

Great guac, enchiladas, rice, etc. The service is consistently good and guac is made table side.

And I enjoyed my visit both times. Sat out on the patio (great patio!) both times.Food: Really enjoyed their shrimp tacos. So delicious. The side beans and rice aren't particularly memorable. The house queso is decent. Their chips are a little too thick for my personal preference. Salsa is great.Ambiance: Relaxed atmosphere. A feeling of a little upscale, but it's still casual dress. Again, the patio is great. I haven't tried inside so I couldn't say how it feels there.Service: Service is a bit slow. Nothing special.Overall, if I had to bring someone to the Riverwalk and they wanted Mexican, I would bring them here. It's a great location with decent food!"], ["Kevin B.", "What a great place! I came here back in March with a bunch of friends and we were very pleasantly surprised. The staff were very kind and they accommodated all of us on a large table upstairs. The complimentary chips and salsa were ridiculously good and I could have honestly eaten that all night. My duck chalupas were mouth-watering and the combination of flavors worked perfectly. I loved my prickly pear margarita (the coconut one was great as well) and everything about this place was great. If you're in San Antonio and want a great Tex-Mex place, definitely stop in here!"], ["Dana P.", "The food was good, and the service was excellent. Prices on par with most of the Riverwalk restaurants. 3 of us ate, and total cost was $55 without drinks or appetizers. The menu is unique. I saw young goat as an optiom, for instance.

Every table is served complimentary salsa in a stylish vase shaped vessel. It had a chipolte heat and pretty good Things we ordered:*House queso $7- bland*Fried Oyster on yucca chips with jalapeno butter $11- very good without the chips. Fried yucca chips are extremely hard. *House specialty shrimp with beurre blanc- $26 very good and highly recommend. The 6 shrimp are the size of small lobster tails and the corn and cilantro rice flavors blend perfectly together. * kids chicken tenders $8- More than enough food for my 11 year old. *Tuna margarita frozen- $9(prickly pear mix)Pretty good, I suggest sub chili lime rub instead of saltWe sat on the large upper deck patio which over looks the river. Youre above the river so the view isnt the same as other river walk places. It was August and the patio was full and fans were on full speed. Service was the only negative and the parking situation. He had an 8 top and (2 ) 4 tops and was training someone. He had a hard time keeping up and worry that he may not be the best choice to train and will perpetuate the slow service. He did provide good recommondations, just needs to multi task better. We called ahead to inquire about parking and were told about the valet service. Upon arrival, the valet said they were only accepting overnight hotel guests for a $30 fee. We had to park in the next garage option a couple blocks away.

I ordered the tortilla soup (Azteca) and the Grilled Chicken Tortillas with rice and beans. The soup was phenomenal but the food left much to be desired.

I'm a huge Mexican food fan and these did not disappoint. Slightly messy but I'm used to it :-). Unfortunately it wasn't very much food so I also ordered the stuffed crepes for dessert. These were basically chewy crepes wrapped around ice cream and it was also yummy but I would have preferred more texture, perhaps hard chocolate flakes or nuts?Service: We were seated quickly and our waiter was very attentive. My water was persistently filled and we had no problems with missed orders or the like.Conclusions: Solid TexMex restaurant with a modern atmosphere that is not to my personal liking.

We knew we were going to have a party of about 20, so reservations were made in advance. What we showed up to was our table being given away, only to be forced to wait cramped up in the bar area while they cleaned up after a homecoming party to accommodate for us. We finally were walked downstairs and sat down, but the new table they gave us couldn't fit our last two people since we were by the kitchen, so we were forced yet again to move now, upstairs. Food was just good, but could get better for the price elsewhere. Enchiladas verdes weren't anything special and the mini skewers were a bit chewy and couldn't find the chimichurri sauce it came with. What really got me was the drinks. There were about 8-10 signature drinks on the back. No prices, pretty standard for restaurants. I ordered a cucumber jalape\u00f1o margarita, the 16 oz. We must've been at dinner for about 2 hours so I had a refill of that somewhere in between. All in all, for an appetizer, entree, and two margaritas plus 20% gratuity, my bill was $100.

Best part of their meal was the homemade ice cream at the end. Above all though, the service was the best I've had in years. \u00a0If you are lucky enough to have Mike H. as your server, you are in for a treat. He had great recommendations on food and really was happy we liked our meal.I recommend this to anyone in the San Antonio area looking for a great meal."], ["Tory V.", "Decidedly meh. \u00a0 Carnitas and skirt steak were just ok.

Now usually I only care about food/drinks and typically that's what interests me so let's start off with drinks...I ordered a skinny margarita which really tasted like a margarita on the rocks watered down...so I asked for another drink something lighter with just a splash of agave or sweet & sour whatever they squeeze in that shiz and well it was better... but not great. They really weren't that strong which is odd because yelp reviews swear the drinks are potent...well not today (whomp whomp). Tortilla chips were fresh and tasty. They brought out a spicer green salsa which had a pretty good flavor and nice kick..as long as you don't mind the overkill on salt :S The place was not crowded at all (it was about 4:00pm on a weekday) and we had a table of about 11...food took a while but it came out nice and hot, which these days is sometimes asking too much!

Yea it was a little pricey but it's downtown on the river, it's expected. I would not suggest getting a typical plate of enchiladas, rice beans or something boring..noooooo think outside the box and try there specialities! If I might add the table side guac was refreshing. Ripe avocados, fresh lime juice, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os and onion...you just can't go wrong with guac..just can't. The service was like a 3 out of a 5, she was nice just slow and not as attentive for a party so large. Would I come back?

I didn't have a reservation for a Sunday afternoon but was seated immediately at a table right on the water.

The gorgeous patio at Acenar beckoned... as did the prospect of a giant michelada. We were seated promptly and presented with fresh chips and roasted salsa. Look, I dont know what they did to that salsa to make it so delicious but all I wanted was to eat that for liiiiife.Instead of just gorging on chips and salsa, or rather in addition to, we ordered the jicama shrimp tacos, guacamole and an ensalada de Acenar. Everything we had was outstanding -- especially those jicama tacos. Who thought of making a \"tortilla\" out of a slice of jicama? A genius, that's who. The drinks are overpriced and the service left a little something to be desired but the diversity on the menu, fabulous patio and convenience means I'll probably find myself recommending it to anyone who visits."], ["John H.", "Ah, a nice relaxing afternoon on the River Walk eating some tasty TexMex food. I very much love Acenar's outdoor seating space - unlike most places, it overlooks the river instead of being right on the path. The entire spacious deck extends about headhigh along the river bank so you can actually look down on the people passing by. The food is great for the River Walk - nice portions at a good price and a little more Mex than Tex when it comes to the options. Burnt salsa, verde, and mole make it a step above the average. What I'm not in love with is the rushed feeling you sometimes get during peak hours. Stick to the off times and let yourself enjoy this awesome spot."], ["Annie F.", "Located in downtown San Antonio, I had never heard of this place before, but came to have dinner on referral of my better half. It was a Friday early evening, and being a party of 3 we got seating right away, which was a nice surprise. As you walk into the restaurant you're greeted by a fairly large bar/waiting area. Walking down the stairs into the actual dining hall, a cozy and warm atmosphere surrounds you. The restaurant is also located right on the Riverwalk, so on a warm day, eating outside would be perfect. It's January, so we decided to stay inside.Our waitress was wonderful. Very attentive and quick. She got our drink order in and soon after presented a Mezcal mule, a Mezcal Mojito and a sangria. The Mule and the Mojito were really tasty, the sangria however tasted like an old Velvet Elvis painting that's been stored in a damp and moldy basement for too long. Soon after we got our main courses (all the while we had been snacking away on complementary chips and salsa which were actually really good). I had the Entomatadas/fried stuffed tortillas which were ok. Nothing that I haven't had before. My husband has the Cabrito en Chile Ancho/baby goat - and even though the presentation was beautiful, the dish was a complete and utter disappointment. The meat was super fatty, if there was meat at all. He dug through his food to find something edible, but to no avail. I am not a picky eater and i also am not big on complaining or sending things back, but a $26 dish should be more than retried beans and rice. The goat is what appealed to him, and he had maybe an ounce. When the waitress came to clear the table, we politely told her about the food disaster and the restaurant took the goat dish off the check. However, in an established place such as Acenar, this should not happen. I am not sure if we will go back, especially since San Antonio has so many good restaurants to go and try. Thank you, Sandra, for the lovely waiting job."], ["Alice S.", "Food was great, view was great, service was Absolutely great. The name of our server was Tony, he was very nice and friendly.

Finally our water comes and gives us drinks and brings us chips, I love the their chips and salsa! Yum! We didnt feel like eating a big meal so we just ordered queso and chips. I think our server was a litter upset with us that we just ordered chips and dip. he seemed irritated and new at serving. We were also created by fast flying birds in our face haha it was funny and my son loved it. The mariachi that travels from restaurant to restaurant happened to be there when we sat down and they were very persistent on playing us a song even when we said that we didnt have any cash for tips and then they proceeded to play a song and expected a tip at the end, I felt bad but they didnt listen, all i had was \u00a03 dollar coins. so now they have them... I was supposed to save those.. But they insisted on playing us a song. All in all It was nice.

The food is amazing! A huge variety, from duck to beef to vegetarian and more. There literally is something for everyone. I had the Chicken Tinga Chalupas, which were tender shredded chicken that had simmered in a tomato and sausage sauce, and then piled on a toastada with beans, and a lime slaw that was amazingly fresh and acidic. Best meal I have had in a LONG time. My husband enjoyed his Carnitas also, which came out smoking hot. They were tender and juicy, and came with tortillas, beans, and rice. A ton of food. The d\u00e9cor of this place is casual, but also classy and modern at the same time. Wooden architecture of various stains, and bright neon pink candle holders everywhere make this place feel inviting. The outdoor seating area is on a patio that overlooks the riverwalk. It is tucked away from the main area of the touristy riverwalk so the foot traffic is lighter, but you still get to see the river flowing by as you munch on the delicious food. Like I said, I am in love with this place. No surprise, they are a sister establishment of my other fave San Antonio spot, Rosarios.There is a bar area on the upstairs street level, but we did not venture that way since our son was with us."], ["Sarah A.", "After walking around The River walk and downtown San Antonio for most of the afternoon. We were starting to get kind of hungry (well I was hungry Minh was pretty much ready to start chewing on the next thing that he saw) We passed by this hip restaurant when we first started walking around the River walk. The menu has a good assortment of food and the prices were okay. Walking around an hour or so later, we decided to come back and try it out.Service is okay here; our hostess was kind of a space case. She greeted us but then walked away. Another hostess walked up and she seated us but not before asking if we had a reservation. Seriously, you are asking us that question when the restaurant is not even half-full. Ack, whatever! We told her no and she seated us in the back of the restaurant along with probably all the other out of towners that were there enjoying their dinner. Do not get me wrong inside this restaurant it is stunning and beautiful. I love the decor and the mood lighting.While looking over the menu (which is quite impressive), our drink order was taken and a huge basket of freshly made chips and salsa was brought to our table (okay, maybe this is turning around).We decided on getting: Poquito de Todo $34.00 (and feeds two people)- Skewered shrimp, carnitas, grilled marinated beef, spicy sausage,charbroiled chicken served with chiles and cebollas asadas,charro beans, guacamole & pico de gallo, choice of freshly made flour or corn tortillas. Our waiter was not the friendliest, as he probably hated me for when I hoovered all the chips in less than 15 minutes and asked for more.The other server who brought our food our was very attentive and realized we did not have napkins or silverware. He actually checked in on us more than our other waiter did.Let us just say this plate was freaking huge, if you are a meat lover then this is the plate for you to order.The shrimp were plump, the chicken was eh and lacked flavor, the asada was juicy, and the sausage was indeed spicy but good. I was happy we had guacamole that tasted good and was fresh; the flour tortillas were think, fresh, and piping hot. The beans reminded me of the cup of beans you get at El Torito or one of those types of places. Half way through our meat eating extravaganza Minh muttered \"There is no way we are going to finish this\". Realizing that he was right, we tapped out and opted for a take home box.Once again, our fearless waiter was nowhere to be seen or heard from, but our nice server offered to get us a box and container for the guacamole and a plastic bag too. As soon as our server walked into the back our waiter re-appeared and said he would get us a to go box before we could say anything he was gone.Server brought us the to go box that we needed and asked if he could re fill our drinks, which we said sure.The waiter came out with just a box saw that we had everything and said oh someone already got those for you. We both said um yeah could we have the check please?.This place is 50/50, I would say come here only if you are super hungry, do not expect too much from the staff and just know this place is a tourist trap as well."], ["J W.", "Went here with a group this past Thursday and the service was impeccable!

He was familiar with what was most popular and was also able to make his own personal suggestions. \u00a0The food was high quality, beautifully presented on the plate, and absolutely delicious!! The quesadilla plate from the kids menu was actually big enough to feed all three of my kids. I ordered two kids plates and took the other back to our hotel. They even gave our kiddos a complimentary scoop of ice cream!! I took a bite and it was the best ice cream I have ever tasted!! If I were going to complain, I would say the drinks are over priced. The drinks were ok but the taste and alcohol content was definitely not worth the $16 for one drink."], ["Alyx F.", "This was an a-ok TexMex spot that was very close to our hotel which added a nice convenience factor to it.

There does not appear to be a dress code so tourists can feel free to drop in after a day at the Alamo. However, it is most enjoyable when one dresses up for the experience. They are able to handle large groups with large round tables so that everyone can take part in the conversation. Or, dress up and sit out on the river with your love for a romantic dinner. It is walking distance to every downtown attraction including the Alamo, Riverwalk, and Tobin Center, as well. The very classy Valencia hotel is upstairs for those from out of town or San Antonio looking for a night away from the house."], ["Dave M.", "One of the best Mexican places in downtown San Antonio, but that's not really saying much. In San Antonio, \"tourist style Mexican\" is king downtown. I had the duck chalupas and my son had fajitas. We both enjoyed our food a lot, but both of our wives ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were subpar. The vote from the wives is that we won't be returning. Service was slow also, which didn't help. Still, this is probably the best Mexican Food you'll find downtown. Every other place on the river is worse than Taco Bell."], ["T L.", "Dont order the guac. Bland and small guacamole for 2. Terrible, stale chips. Didn't make it at the table for us/as advertised either. Very Good michelada and alright mojito.

There are a few stairs inside the restaurant especially if you need to use the restroom. They surprisingly serve complimentary salsa and chips. I ordered the special dish they had that evening. It was 6 jumbo flavorful shrimps with a little kick of spice served over maybe cilantro rice ( green in color). This dish was good but if you are hungry you better order a appetizer. I did ask for flour tortillas and they were yummy and tasted homemade. I am Asian but grew up in a predominantly Hispanic area so I know tortillas! I tried one of my kids chicken quesadilla and it was seasoned just right! Very tasty chicken! I did post pictures of my family's dishes."], ["Aracely N.", "The guacamole was so fresh and delicious! I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were great too! They were spicy, I think they might've had chunks of Serrano, but it was perfect! The retried beans and cilantro rice were also great and the Paloma to top it off made for a great meal."], ["Eliza J.", "Soaring hits and a few misses. Great river walk location with balcony seating. Service was efficient but indifferent. Margaritas are STRONG. Parking is an issue as with anywhere downtown. Our group of three had the tableside guacamole which was over salted. Despite being asked twice the server left out the cilantro. Two of us had the duck crepes which we had read rave reviews about before. They lived up to the hype and were amazing. Complex flavors and beautiful presentation. I kept going back for more long after I was stuffed. The whole table raved over these. The other person had the cheese enchiladas which were surpassingly also excellent - subtle flavors and much more than just a greasy pile of cheese. The main courses were the standout. For desert we spilt a chocolate cake and dulce de leche. Both were perfectly good but not remarkable or outstanding. This seemed to be a mariachi-free environment unlike some other Riverwalk options. Overall I would go back and hope for better service."], ["M C.", "Quality has definitely gone down hill in the last 3yrs. I used to live in San Antonio and this place was great. Unfortunately that's not the case anymore... The tables and booths were beat up, the food was cold, and the prices were really high for average tex-mex. Not worth the money any longer. Needs new management and/or some serious improvements to get it back to it's former glory. Also I called ahead of time to make sure my college football game was on tv. The hostesses assured me it would be on and sure enough they didn't have ESPN SEC. This was just the start of the many problems we all ran into. Need some better hostesses..."], ["Mary P.", "Quite possibly the most amazingly delicious TexMex in the entire city. \u00a0I am so in love with this place. \u00a0Firstly, and maybe the most important, their margaritas are sinfully delicious. \u00a0Not too sweet and a tad on the strong side just how I like them. \u00a0Secondly the food, arguably more important than the margarita but it depends on what day it is for me. \u00a0My husband had the cheese enchiladas, very adventurous of him no? \u00a0I was amazed, I have lived here for years which basically means I have had several hundred cheese enchiladas... these are my favorite in the entire city. \u00a0Red corn tortillas and the freshest cheese made for melt in my mouth deliciousness.Moving on to my meal, I had the combo tacos. \u00a0I couldn't decide what I wanted and the waiter, Ricky who was fantastic by the way, gave me a few suggestions. \u00a0I ended up with one taco each of chicken, beef and pork. \u00a0They were the most savory tacos.... with the pineapple and onion and cilantro on top just enough to bring out the flavor of each taco. \u00a0Let me finish by saying the menu options are amazing. \u00a0I have been here several times and each time I have had a beyond stellar experience. \u00a0And considering the venue is multilevel with several entrances and on the Riverwalk, you can't go wrong here."], ["Paul G.", "I was in San Antonio on business and stopped by here for dinner, the food was great.

Although there is great outdoor seating I found myself sitting at the bar for dinner.The bartender was great; took my drink order quickly, was friendly and could carry a conversation, and when I asked for favorites he had good suggestions instead of the usual \"everything on the menu is good...\"Started with a blood orange mojito which was great and followed that with a Shiner Bock.For dinner I had duck chalupa's which were fantastic. On the side was some true hot sauce which spiced them up, but even without the spice the dish was very flavorful as served."], ["Chris G.", "Very poor service. We were ignored at the door, then lead to a table that was so bright you needed sunglasses. Our server seemed rushed and forgot our silverware and our tortillas. The shrimp tocos barely contained shrimp. Maybe two tiny cut up pieces per taco. The beans were reheated and the tortillas were soggy. Carnitas were very dry, and hard to swallow.I am usually very forgiving, but I cant find a single good thing to say about this place.

We were greeted and seated promptly as they were ready for us. The had a table for the girls and another for the parents which was very nice. We had one waiter for all of us. That's probably the only downfall - management should have been better prepared because our poor waiter had to help all of us and keep parents and kids matched up for the bill. We're talking cheerleaders here - it's like herding cats. He earned every penny of those tips. I ordered the hand shaken margarita and it was WONDERFUL! Chips were plentiful and good. Salsa was great with just the right amount of heat for continual snacking. Many of us order different varieties of the enchiladas. Cheese - chicken - veggie - and all raved about the taste.

Outside = quick snack. The inside restaurant does serve whatever the window offers though but not vice versa. Very pleasant service!

Ended up getting a second fruit cup, which was better but still had to skip the coconut. :( It was really disappointing.The ambiance is really casual and laid back.

Those chopped jalape\u00f1o got me all sweating up. Had to order a fruit plate to neutralize my burning tongue.

It might have helped that I was speaking to her in Spanish so if you only speak English, you're on your own on that one right there lol. The interior and exterior appeared to be very clean and I found it to be extremely GENIUS that they've got an outside seating area in addition to the dining room (which easily houses at least 20 tables). They've also got this neat water cooling system that sprinkles on patrons below to keep them cool during this punishing Texas heat!My mini taquitos included very generous portions of bistec!!! I was able to transform my 5 mini taquitos into 10 (because of the double corn tortilla and how stuffed they were with meat). \u00a0I highly recommend their carne guisada and pastor tacos on flour tortillas, and the quesadilla with meat was very tasty as well. To top everything off we had a mango agua fresca, which had an interesting flavor, but was still good. Although I went with a Groupon, I can hardly see this place breaking your bank with very affordable prices such as theirs. If you plan on going with someone who is going to choose the same fruits as you, I would recommend selecting their $4 fruit cup. It's much bigger and only a little over a dollar more than the smaller fruit cups.We will definitely be back for a second round!"], ["Angela F. W.", "Now as the duchess of Los Cocos, I feel I am obligated to write this place a review, lol. So here it goes. I had never stopped by this particular establishment even though it is super close to work. That's probably because I was never interested in Mexican food much. Apparently my coworkers have been coming here for fruit cups for a long time. I didn't know that until recently Yelp suggested that this nearby restaurant had almost perfect ratings. So I was like what the heck I will try it out. So I did. The first time, I got the watermelon aqua fresca. I love fruits, I am not gonna lie. Fresh fruit water in a hot summer day? What's better than that?! I give the Watermelon aqua fresca a 7/10. It was good but I felt it could be more fresh. So I stopped by again the following day to try the mango one. This time, it gets a 9/10 from me. It was almost perfect, I loved it! While waiting for my drink, I grabbed a menu to look at. Man, they have shrimp cocktails! I love seafood. So I decided that I have to come try their lunch. I finally came in during lunch time with a coworker. I got the shrimp cocktail and a tortilla soup which I saw good reviews on Yelp. Our server was very nice and the service was fast. But she did forget my friend's salad. Anyways, we both agree the tortilla soup was very good. I mean very very good. I got the small but it was definitely big enough to eat as a meal. My friend got a large and she didn't even finish half of it. My shrimp cocktail was decent. I think the shrimps could definitely be more fresh. Since SA is not a coastal city, I won't be too hard here. But I have to say the cocktail sauce was perfect. It has cilantro (another favorite of mine), avocado and other seasoning in it. It was very delicious and full of flavors. I ordered the small but the portion was pretty generous. I didn't finish it so I took the rest home. Overall, my experience at Los Cocos was very positive. Any place that serves both seafood and fresh fruits rocks. I have yet to try their famous fruit cups. But rest assured that I will be back soon. In sum, I approve Los Cocos and this message! - the duchess"], ["Christina C.", "Los Cocos isn't in the greatest of areas, it's not in the barrio but rather close. Worth it though because it is a serious contender for the best mexican food I've ever had! So I was suffering from one of those hangovers that only a watermelon agua fresca can cure, for a brief moment I almost only ordered that at their little outside kiosk window, but something about the grilled meat smell and the fact that I saw they had corn in a cup (elote for lazies) made me walk into the restaurant area.It looks like a typical lunch restaurant in Mexico; tables are tacky simple, walls have no actual theme to their hand painted details (picures of fruit, agua fresca, the cheetos cheetah), little hut in the middle as a cashier station, and a Spanish crooner with a guitar even popped up for a song. \u00a0The salsa that came with the chips I wanted to drink with a straw, it was so fresh with a wonderful roasted spiciness. Watermelon agua fresca saved my life, I'll never complain that it's too sweet even if it is. The last time i had elote was more than a decade ago, and although the husband called it \"funky,\" it's one of those nostalgic snacks that just put me in a good mood. The al pastor mini tacos were perfectly marinated and rather heavy on the meat as well as the obligatory onions, cilantro and lime.

Then you can top that off with \"limon\" or \"chile\" or both. I obviously get both...because that's what I do.

Wow.They also serve chili and corn in a cup which consists of corn, butter, mayo, sour cream, cheese, lemon juice, and hot sauce. How can all those flavors co-exist? I don't know! It just works.Of course you can customize what you want in your fruit cup or corn in a cup.

The creamers I received were of room temperature and the coffee tasted horrible after I poured the creamers in. They were probably rancid and not refrigerated for a really long time.

They told me they were closing and that there was no chance of a refund or the proper sized soup. I told them I would be there in the morning to try to get this resolved and there reply was \" well good luck\". It's pretty sad because they could've had a costumer for life. This didn't have to happen. They didn't have to be so rude.

Boringly, I ordered my usual trifecta of breakfast tacos: the sturdy, standard bean and cheese; the meaty, hard-to-perfect beef fajita; and the comforting, easy-to-mess-up, papas rancheras.All three tacos were dead-on perfect. Thick, fresh tortillas. Substantial refried beans with a non-overbearing whisper of rendered pork, sprinkled with real-deal cheese. A few thick slices of tender, piquant spicy beef fajita that paired nicely with the requisite green jalapeno breakfast salsa. Potatoes just crispy enough to marry happily with the right touch of pico de gallo sauteed into the mix.My only mistake was not ordering the same breakfast plate as my Southside companion: two perfectly cooked eggs, a reasonable helping of refried beans, crispy potatoes un-marred by any vegetal garnish, and one awesome scoop of barbacoa (on any day of the week!) along with those pillow-y flour tortillas. The barbacoa was tender and memorable, with no fat or gristle.Although the place was not exactly packed upon this day of Tex-Mex reckoning, the waitress seemed somewhat overwhelmed, leaving my tea empty from time to time. I know it's obnoxious of me, but I've grown accustomed to having chips and salsa served even with breakfast, so I felt somewhat denied not to have them offered at 11 AM.

On the other hand, the beef fajita tasted like pre-prepared/ store bought but they put their own seasoning before they grilled it. The rice was also flavorful, charro beans has the crackling which is very tasty! The green sauce completed the dish! Overall, i would come back whenever i visit san antonio!"], ["Dean H.", "Holy crap, this place is amazing. \u00a0The chicken was so smoky good that I spent the better part of the next two hours, smelling my fingers where a faint hint of the smoky goodness hung on for a while.

But, if you come here, although I like Mexican hamburgers, get the chicken - it hits on all cylinders. \u00a0As added bonuses, the place is cool in a divey sort of way and the service is friendly, attentive, and professional.I like Pollo El Regio (a lot), but in my opinion this place is a solid step up.."], ["Will M.", "Excellent food and service. \u00a0 Order the whole chicken! \u00a0 You will crave more if you don't!"], ["Ellen B.", "Simple and delicious.

We ordered the Half Chicken and the One Pound Fajitas to share between the four of us. When our food came, we were shocked to see the the fajitas are steak. We expected chicken because of the restaurants name. It wasn't a big issue however, and we just switched around who would it what (my mom doesn't eat steak). I ate both meats, which were cooked perfectly tender. The steak was really juicy and flavorful and the chicken was nice and moist. The other food brought with the meat was great as well. The rice was nicely seasoned, the guacamole/pico/lettuce mix had a nice spicy kick to it, and the grilled onions were sweet. The atmosphere was very friendly and family-oriented.

Upon arrival, I saw lots of smoke coming out from afar. Wow, they are doing some serious business. I went inside, it was packed. I'm glad I called earlier and got my takeout right away. I ordered a smoked whole chicken with rice and beans. It's about $15 tax included. Not bad! It also comes with tortilla and a red sauce and a green sauce. The portion is large, 2-3 meals for me easily. The chicken is very moist but there are a few dry pieces. The best part IMO is the chicken skin, full of flavor and very tender. I know this might sound strange but I've always loved chicken skin. All in all, very good smoked chicken but I've deff had better tho. The beans and rice are also good. And ppl sure aren't lying about the green sauce. I don't know what it is made of but it tastes pretty amazing! Just skip the red sauce and get two green sauce instead!

My husband ordered the whole chicken which came with rice, tortillas, grilled \u00a0onions and a grilled jalape\u00f1o. We took our son and we were able to share the food with him plus bring some leftovers which my other son had eaten. So for less than $30.00 you could prob feed up to four people.

The 1/2 and whole chicken come with rice, a grilled onion, a grilled jalapeno and corn tortillas. The beans are extra, but worth it. It is super reasonable especially if you are feeding the family.

My friend and I arrived at 11:30 and the place was already packed with the lunchtime crowd. We signed in and were seated about 20 minutes later. Not bad for a packed house. Within a couple of minutes of being seated, a cheerful waitress greeted us and took our beverage orders. We looked over the menu, which is mainly chicken, along with fajitas, burgers and I think ribs as well. The main attraction here is the chicken, though. We both ordered the 1/2 chicken with rice and charro beans. While waiting for our food we noticed that the staff is well organized and very attentive to customer tables, keeping the drinks filled and tending to customer requests. They were very prompt during this process. Considering that there are approx 30 tables and the places is crazy busy, that level of service is impressive. Our order arrived about 10 minutes later. Wow!! Was it worth the long drive out there. The presentation is nice. Chicken is brought to you in a red basket with red gingham paper. The chicken is still piping hot, as if right off the grill. The rice is beautiful, fluffy and soooo tasty. The Charro beans are heavenly, as they're also garnished with chicharron and onions. \u00a0I'm not a big onion fan, but took a chance and ordered a grilled onion on the side. Best grilled onion I've had in my life. Tasty and juicy without being pungent at all. Will order that again. The chicken was juicy and so flavorful with the seasoning that they use. This is definitely one of the best tasting grilled chicken that I've ever had. Will definitely return. Upon leaving, a gentleman who was either the owner or manager asked us and other customers if everything was satisfactory. That was a nice touch. He was also overseeing the busy kitchen, dining and cashier staff while greeting customers. I LIKE that! We drove about 17 miles from the opposite side of the city to get there.

The rest of the Mexican food is decent, but not extraordinary. \u00a0This restaurant is perfect for meeting up with friend before going out, or taking someone to dinner who isn't from the area.

Omg this fideo took me way back to my childhood when my dad would make fideo for the family. And the salad was so refreshing with the lime dressing and queso fresco sprinkled on top.

He couldn't say enough positives about the restaurant. His enthusiasm only made our interest all the more enhanced. We were not disappointed in the least. The location was an easy walk from the Riverwalk; it had a look inside and out as very hip, contemporary, full of well thought out design considerations. Besides, it was located in an area that was less flamboyant, and surrounded by a variety of exquisite restaurants. We knew we were in the right place.In brief, the food matched wonderfully our high expectations. Our server, Ernest, was ever present and always interested in our enjoyment of the evening, in general, and our visit as Rosario's, more specifically. His food suggestions were right on. He allowed us to take our time, never giving us any indication that we had to rush through our dinner, as the line of those waiting to be seated was growing. It seemed that there were locals attending this fine restaurant as well as vacationers. In short, we hit the jackpot!

However, even as a local (do I count? I've been here for two years now), I always enjoy going here. Here's why:-They serve both classic and creative drinks. Palomas (grapefruit soda and tequila) are traditional Mexican cocktails that are refreshing without being sticky sweet. They also try combining different flavors, like adding spice to regular margaritas.-The salsa is unique. People either like it or they don't, but I'm a fan. It's smokey and spicy, and different than many of the nearby Mexican restaurants.-It's easy to eat healthier here. This is often really hard to do in San Antonio, but ordering ceviche without the chips or the aguacate salad without all the fried stuff means that you'll leave feeling satisfied but not disgustingly full or greasy.-It's an experience. The lights are dim, the decor is interesting, and the environment is intimate. Whether you're visiting, new to the area, or just looking for a place to try out, Rosario's is worth checking out."], ["Kelly M.", "Came here for lunch before strolling the riverwalk (the Alamo is just a few blocks away) and it was great.The boyfriend is still raving about the Enchiladas Suiza.

They are always packed and consistently rated some of the best Mexican in a city already known for exceptional and authentic cuisine.In town for a conference, walked over on a Tuesday night and grabbed a seat at the bar. Bartenders were super friendly and brought me some chips, salsa, and a menu. My only real complaint about the entire evening was the chips. They were the most plain, generic chips I've ever tasted. But for this I was thankful, because it means I wouldn't eat bowl after bowl and actually enjoy the meal.Not sure why, but the first thing to catch my eye was the Sopa Azteca, a smoky chipotle tomato and epazote soup with shredded chicken, Mexicanroasted cream corn, and garnished with queso panela, corn chips, cilantroand diced avocado. This has to be one of the best soups I have ever eaten. EVER. It was a brilliantly spiced tomato broth with succulent shredded chicken and al dente tortilla strips. The richness and creaminess to the dish paired well with the spicy back end. Absolutely delicious and could easily make a meal of this. Will return just for this!Opted for the Lengua (beef tongue) as my main. It was wonderfully tender and the first time I had ever had it thinly sliced instead of cubed. The lengua was served simmering in a tomato sauce and came with rice, creamy refried beans, and 2 flour and corn tortillas each. I can easily see why Rosario's has the reputation it does.

With more than 1,000+ reviews and an average of a four star rating, I knew this was going to be a real gem. Thankfully, I wasn't wrong. Upon arriving, I was pleasantly surprised how bright and airy the restaurant was. Everything was pink (my favorite color)! After a short wait, the hostess showed us to our table, and a server came over to take our drink orders.To start, I had to get an order of Rosario's queso, because what would Tex-Mex be without a big bowl of melted cheese. Needless to say, it was delicious. Perfectly smooth and creamy, with chips that were able to hold up to the dip without breaking.For my main course, I ordered the tacos norte\u00f1os, one beef and one chicken. I loved that these tacos were toasted on a flat grill - it adds the perfect amount of crunch. Of the two, I preferred the beef, but that's not to say that chicken wasn't any good. Normally, I just prefer beef, but wanted to taste them both. The tacos were served with a side of pinto beans, fresh pico, and avocado.

The menu had a lot of options for the sauces that accompanied the dishes; they seemed special because I've never heard of some of the kinds of sauces before. Chips were served with the meal, and they were different too, in a great way - I think I could get addicted to their chips and salsa.

Even the rice and beans had a little zip to them that made them stand out. The flour tortillas were very good too, and I love a good flour tortilla. Fast, friendly service. It's a bit out of the way and kinda hard to find (in the corner of a strip mall), but definitely worth going."], ["Foodie S.", "Great food, super service but the decor is...... not so good.The soups are fab and everything that has been suggested was great.

The price puts it out of your every day dining selections (for us) but it's a wonderful treat."], ["Dennis B.", "Wow where to start, this has got to be the biggest flim flam est. going. Don't look at the menu let the owner make up your dish for you, because he \"knows\" what you really want! Really?

My wife nor I liked one thing we supposedly wanted. Will never ever waste my time or money with this place again."], ["Jacob M.", "The red snapper was to die for.

I looked up restaurants using Yelp and Ernesto's was one of the few close by with the best reviews. I had read a few other reviews on the way to the restaurant and while most raved about the place there were a few that made me question our choice. Boy was I wrong! The food was hands down some of the most amazing food I have ever had. The flavor that played off each other in every dish we had was so delightful! We started off with shrimp tacos and fried oysters. Oh and let me not forget the amazing green sauce that was brought to us with chips. I personally had the San Antonio Jr for lunch and it was just absolutely perfect. A wonderful size lunch portion and at the right price. After we all finished our amazing lunches we decided to get dessert. It was AMAZING! I highly recommend the mango ice cream and strawberry rum cake! Needless to say the next time I'm visiting San Antonio I will definitely be back. Ernesto was an absolutely wonderful man and his food was even better."], ["Debra F.", "The owner Ernesto himself talked to is several times along with his son. It is a very nice family atmosphere.

My girlfriend and I discovered Ernesto's in a very understated neighborhood after searching Yelp for a local place while we were traveling. Although the location and furnishings were quite nondescript, the service and food was exceptional! The owner greeted us like long-lost family. We were treated to an introductory history of the restaurant and then after questions about what we like Ernesto made suggestions for us, assuring us \"you will *love* it.\" We did! The dinner was delicious, the Vouvray was perfect, and overall we enjoyed one of our favorite all-time dining experiences. We were so impressed that on a subsequent business trip a few months later I brought my aunt and uncle (who live there in San Antonio), and they were very impressed as well - vowing to return regularly. My girlfriend is looking at moving her business to the area this year, and we are looking at locations that are not too far from Ernesto's -- as it is most definitely on our task list to visit on our next trip! It's not an inexpensive dinner, especially with a bottle of wine, but it is well worth it!"], ["Brent H.", "This is a delightful restaurant with wonderful food. You will be greeted by the owner Ernesto. He can create a meal custom to your tastes. The price was very reasonable for the quality \u00a0and quantity of the meals.

Everything we had was great. The service was the best we ever had. They did a great job of explaining the menu and tailoring it to us. I would definitely suggest getting a margaritas while you are there it was outstanding."], ["Jimmy C.", "I was very impressed with Ernesto's. I'm not going to say I've eaten a lot of the more authentic Mexican foods, but the food was very delicious. The owner himself was our host and was very kind and courtious. I was first impressed the best ever guacamole and cocktail sauce. Yes best ever!!!! If guacamole and cocktail can be that good I wondered how much better the main course: and it did not disappoint. I literally; embarrassingly enough, licked my plate clean. Now I will say it's very pricey. But I asked myself \"is it worth it\". the answer is yes. my next vacation I will definitely take the 7 hour drive down south to eat at Ernesto's when visiting family."], ["John W.", "Great food and great atmosphere. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great meal at a good price."], ["Santina W.", "You will feel loved coming to Ernesto because they treat you in a very hospitable way. They come out shaking your hand, smoothly greet you and tell you what specials they have for the day. For an appetizer, I had the seafood enchilada and fried Oyster. The seafood enchilada was delicious!! The enchilada was very cheesy, very creamy with a sweet after taste. Crab meat and sweetness go hand and hand like fresh water sweet blue crabs like we use to catch in the summers at James Island. Yummy!! The oyster was good too, but I did not like seeing uncooked batter, but I forgive them. For my entree, I had Kabob Acapulco. The Kabob is Shrimp, Beef tenderloin, and breast of chicken served with a creamy butter sauce with blended green onions, pineapples, coconut and orange liquor. The flavors that stood out in this dish were the pineapples, and orange flavoring. I got more of a tropical vibe from this dish like the beautiful beaches of Cancun, Mexico or Jamaica somewhere. Ernesto's is unique, eventful and one of a kind to San Antonio."], ["Jamison S.", "Fantastic food, over-the-top friendly and attentive service. Visited Ernesto's based on Yelp reviews and I don't regret it! Ernesto greeted us personally and gave his well-rehearsed introduction to the restaurant, as well as the night's specials. I took his suggestion and enjoyed a beef tenderloin topped with crab meat and served with two tasty shrimp on the side. Sauces were flavorful and definitely added to the dish; is be wiling to try any of them based on this first experience. This is NOT your everyday Tex-Mex!Decor is dated but who cares? I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town and will recommend to my colleagues."], ["Ashley T.", "I am in love with their fried oysters!!Ernesto himself visits every table and helps you decide on a dinner selection, and will even go as far to create something to fit what your looking for!!"], ["Julie S.", "Ernesto gave us the VIP experience. \u00a0Every suggestion he made was on point. Full bar was great."], ["Melinda M.", "Today I joined six women in our book club for lunch at Ernesto's and found it to be a pleasing experience. \u00a0The restaurant was not crowded (It was a Monday). \u00a0Ernesto came to the table to let us know that if we wanted any menu item customized in any way he would do his best to accommodate. \u00a0We did not have a great deal of time, so most of us skipped the appetizers and dessert and just ordered off the lunch menu. \u00a0I had Ernestos Steak San Antonio Tender Beef Tenderloin ($10.50) and I was very pleased with the presentation and flavors. When the meal arrived I noticed several dishes that others had ordered that caught my interest and made me want to return to try those. The broiled tomatoes looked especially inviting. \u00a0 I love Mexican food and could eat it everyday, however, sometimes I get tired of the Tex-Mex offerings and at this restaurant I felt the blend of Spanish and French influence offered me a nice change. \u00a0 \u00a0The decor and shopping center are somewhat dated but for everyday dining I felt they were fine and did not detract from the very nice meal I had."], ["Jason V.", "One of the best meals of my life! The beef tenderloin was amazing. I've never had Mexican food of this caliber. I came in with a crew of 30 and we were all extremely pleased. The sauces are the key.

The shrimp nachos are also a good menu item. The staff is really polite and the owner visited our table multiple times to make sure everything was to our liking. Live music was played during dinner.

Last night we thought we'd give it a try. Where Vance Jackson road meets Jackson-Keller road right above Loop 410 is where Ernesto's is located. \u00a0It's a little hidden in the back of some, seen better days, strip center but believe me, it's in there. \u00a0Find it.Ernesto himself greets you at the door. \u00a0Ernesto himself gives you a breakdown of the menu. \u00a0Ernesto himself gives you menu suggestions. \u00a0Ernesto himself was a delight all evening long.He said this was the first gourmet Mexican restaurant in San Antonio and that we were in for a treat. He was so spot on with that statement.I had the ceviche for an appetizer. \u00a0I was supposed to share this with S but S had ordered tortilla soup so I got to enjoy this tasty dish all by myself. \u00a0The ceviche was diced filet of red snapper marinated in a special sauce w/ avocado slices. \u00a0Very flavorful with a great balance of acid and fresh ingredients. \u00a0I highly recommend this dishI tried the Steak San Antonio: \u00a0Beef Tenderloin with garlic butter sauce served with a Green Chicken Enchilada and beans and rice. \u00a0My medium steak was melt in your mouth goodness. \u00a0The garlic sauce took me to a place I didn't know my taste buds were allowed to venture. \u00a0The chicken enchilada was tender and flavorful. \u00a0Was not as impressed with the typical tex-mex rice and beans but Ernesto said we could change anything we wanted on the menu to suit our pleasure. \u00a0 Next time I will try the cilantro rice. My only regret was that I was too full to even think about dessert as the dessert menu was quite tempting. \u00a0To reiterate, this place is a hidden gem. \u00a0Use your GPS to take you to 2559 Jackson-Keller, San Antonio, Texas \u00a078230. \u00a0Once there, let Ernesto entertain your palate with the finest Mexican Cuisine I've yet to encounter in San Antonio. \u00a0I shall return, again and again and again.4.8 Stars out of 5PS: \u00a0the service was immpeccable. \u00a0Everyone was polite and generous with their time.PPS: \u00a0the margaritas we had were small but well made.PPPS: \u00a0the chips were thick and the salsa was green. \u00a0Both delicious.PPPPS: \u00a0when you try Ernesto's, let me know, I want to go with you and try everything on the menu."], ["Cameron K.", "If you really want to have a nice dinner on date night and get delicious food and are willing to splurge on just the food, this is a very good pick in San Antonio. That being said, I do have a few other comments. Before going here, I had read multiple posts of this establishment on Tripadvisor's website. The way it was hyped up, I was just expecting a location with a little more panache. The food was excellent, all that it was hyped up to to be. However, it was a bit overpriced, given the atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, the owner and his staff provided EXCELLENT service but if they really want to take it to the next level, they need to move to a better location and change the atmosphere and decor. The atmosphere and decor left more than a little to be desired, in my opinion. Felt like I was back in the 70s. \u00a0Just needs to be modernized.All that being said, I give this place a 4 out of 5. The food is really good. First, the salsa is very good, green and spicy. The Ceviche was OK but the tortilla soup was very good. Our party had the Shrimp Enchiladas, the tenderloin, grilled shrimp and then the grouper with shrimp. The food was very, very good. The sauces really make the food excellent. The chefs are top notch and it shows in the food. The margaritas are of special note. They are home made and they are DELICIOUS. We finished off with the coconut flan and it did not dissappoint. We'll have to try the Ernesto's coffee another time. Like I stated above, it is a bit overpriced and the atmosphere could definetly use some work. The guy playing the piano and guitar needs to be replaced with more modern music and the decor needs serious modernization. That being said, the food was excellent."], ["John J.", "Ernesto tells you what's good. \u00a0The sauces are wonderful. \u00a0Had the seafood crepes and wife the red snapper.

I left out dinner because they close at 3 PM. which kept me from giving it one more star. The breakfast is delicious with generous portions. The enchiladas in my opinion are some of the best in S.A.

The breakfast tacos are pretty large and reasonably priced. Not only tasting delicious the flower tortilla are hand made and the tacos are not greasy. Sure alot of taco places in town have hand made tortillas but 90 percent of those places have greasy tacos.

The meat was tender and flavorful. Today my taco contained agristle, not asada. Most of my meat Ended up half-chewed and then placed on the plate. Sorry, that's a bit gross, I know.

They were served with the meat and a slice of avocado, with lime, onions, and cilantro on the side. Very enjoyable, the meat was melt in your mouth and went nicely with the smooth, creamy avocado.

One word of caution though, there are two unmarked bottles of sauce on the table, one green and one orange.

It comes on a basic bun with beans and cheese, and the slightly greasy, hearty sandwich made me capable of facing the day. Also a plus? I got it delivered from the Bike Waiter so I didn't even need to find sunglasses. I had to do a $10 minimum order for delivery, which sounds easy, but the prices here are so cheap, I ordered a couple of tacos also, and ate them later. My only problem is one not limited to this particular taco joint, but a lot of Mexican restaurants use floppy, not crispy bacon in their tacos, and this is definitely one of them. The tortillas are fluffy and delicious, though.

We also ordered the Taco Loco - It was HUGE. \u00a0We had to take one home. \u00a0It was very different than any other breakfast tacos we have had. \u00a0I included a picture of the Robert - which may look weird, but it was GOOD!This will be a new go to place for us. \u00a0I would love to try the other items."], ["Peyton S.", "I love all the people whining about greasy tacos. \u00a0First off, they're not THAT greasy. \u00a0I've been eating here for years and never found it to be an issue. \u00a0Secondly, just what exactly were you guys expecting? \u00a0A health food restaurant, this is not. \u00a0 This place is legit. \u00a0Great breakfast joint at awesome prices. \u00a0Hot coffee or iced tea. \u00a0It's all good. \u00a0The dude that works the counter, Isador, is there day in day out. \u00a0He runs a tight ship and it shows. \u00a0This place has been delicious since like... forever.The chilaquilas, huevos ranchers, carne guisada, and barbacoa are all spot on. \u00a0The only thing I didn't really like was the tripas, but honestly, I should have known better. \u00a0Everything else is spot on."], ["Luis S.", "This place is where I come for a great breakfast done right. I live in the Medical Center but will make the trek with my family to this place for amazing food at great prices.Word of warning, bring your stretchy pants...seriously.I can only really comment on breakfast here, but I've ordered a few lunch items for breakfast and they were just as good. For starters, come hungry and order away. Their tacos are full, and in some cases can be made into two so don't be afraid to pay the small charge for extra tortillas. Their combo plates are a great value and really fill you up. I'm a fan of the barbacoa plate, but with eggs and without. Either way it's a win for you.Let me just say that their barbacoa is some of the best in the city. I've had it at a lot of places, and while I won't claim I'm an expert, this place winds hands down for me. In all the instances that I've been their barbacoa comes with little to no fat. Such a huge departure from some other places where I'm just picking gristle and fat out of the meat to enjoy what I'm eating. This meat is clean and I love it.My kids love the bean and cheese tacos. They eat them by the plate sometimes, but their chorizo, avocado, potato and egg, and even sausage and egg are all winners. I will continue to bring my family and visiting friends here for a taste of some home cooked food.The only downside is that sometimes service can be slow and there aren't enough hot sauce bottles to go around. Be sure to ask for them immediately and hoard them, trust me."], ["H V.", "Nice local place, service was good. Barbacoa is great, tortas outstanding. \u00a0No complaints."], ["Emily F.", "During a recent stay in San Antonio for our wedding anniversary, my husband and I searched Yelp for a delicious Mexican spot to soothe our grumbly tummies on a Saturday morning. Yelp wins again!From the perspective of visitors, it was a treat to drive through a historic neighborhood to find this local spot.When we walked in, we expected great things, because any place that puts giant pictures of their food on the walls has good things to offer.I ordered chipotle cream cheese enchiladas and hubs ordered the migas plate and a side of cheese enchiladas. Plus, coffee! The coffee was a bit burnt, but we each downed two cups. The enchiladas were yum-o and the migas were good, but more chips than egg. We ordered a Mexican Coke to go and rolled ourselves out.Service was great, too!"], ["Christian R.", "This place is simply fantastic, nothing compares. Best tortillas and best Mexican food overall in the city."], ["Jason L.", "Have you ever heard the expression, don't judge a book by it's cover. \u00a0The parking here is terrible, the decor is not really that great and since I'm 6'2,\" the ceiling fan was so low, it nearly took my head off as I was going to the rest room. \u00a0That said, we loved this place. \u00a0The food was excellent and very reasonable. \u00a0I had the ham and eggs with a pork chop on the side along with coffee. \u00a0And that chiptole sauce? \u00a0Wow! Our server was very nice and she was very helpful in explaning the menu to my friend, who was from Kansas and didn't know too much about Mexican food. \u00a0This was our last stop on our way out of San Antonio and we went out with a bang. \u00a0Giving this place 5 stars is a no-brainer."], ["Marli K.", "Best barbacoa ever! Also, very good salsa. The green one is my favorite...they are both very spicy but delicious. \u00a0All of their breakfast tacos and plates are great."], ["Marty B.", "I would agree that this is one great breakfast place for some good Tex-Mex food. Pleasant waitresses, very good food."], ["Lyndsey S.", "This is a small place kind of in a hidden area I assume. \u00a0Not being from SA, I wouldn't have thought to come here if it weren't for reviews of places nearby where I was. \u00a0We had a choice of this place or a burger place which is right across the street from El Milagrito. \u00a0We chose this place because we were waiting for the burger joint to open but were too hungry to wait. \u00a0Right when I looked at it, I felt like I was in Austin. \u00a0The paint and the looks of people coming out made me feel comfortable. \u00a0The area isn't necessarily run down but it isn't in the rich area either. \u00a0Some houses look scary.The menu is full of typical dishes but they put their own little spin on it. \u00a0Your sodas come in cans with a chp of ice and tea comes by refilled often. The plates are good sized.It's pretty tight inside and can be a little uncomfortable if your child needs a high chair. \u00a0The booths are a litte tight as well especially if you aren't that close to the one next to you, you will be touching them often and if you're left handed, make sure you sit isle side. Overall good food!"], ["Andrea R.", "Born and raised in San Antonio and these were some of the best breakfast tacos we have ever had.The parking was a little rough but the food was well worth it!The tacos were packed full and the salsa was amazing!Even though the restaraunt was packed our waitress was friendly and we got our food quick!We will def be coming back!"], ["Josue N.", "My wife and I had the Menudo soup, my older son had a torta de carne asada and the picky little one had pancakes.

Prices are right!"], ["Jonathan G.", "Down the street from my house and located in the center for all hipsters in San Antonio. This place is a must for an early breakfast or if you are nursing a hangover."], ["Garrett P.", "I only rate the way I did and write this because I've noticed a recent change in the quality of the breakfast tacos in this place and I'm hoping management/ownership might see this and realize recent changes should be reversed. \u00a0I live really close to this place and so like any other person raised on breakfast tacos I call in tacos A LOT on the weekends. \u00a0The last three times I ordered them, the bacon was thin like they changed suppliers or cheaped out or something, they skimped on the cheese and the carne guisada had major fat chunks in it. \u00a0I know that sometimes restaurants, in an effort to improve their margins and/or streamline their business operations all together, take a second look at where they source their ingredients thinking maybe they can accomplish the same dishes for less cost or hassle of sourcing. \u00a0I support the idea and sometimes this can be done with no unintended consequence to the quality of the food...but sometimes it can't. \u00a0I don't know for sure if this is what happened here but it's usually smart owners/managers that get caught in this trap and the people that run this place are clearly intelligent business owners/operators so I fear they out-smarted themselves. \u00a0I hope this finds the right people so they can be aware that changes have been noticed and are not appreciated, at least by this reviewer. \u00a0Please don't change, we liked you the way you were!"], ["A D.", "Enjoyed my lunch. The taste is very mild for those who aren't daring. Location is good, parking is bad. I will return for more choices."], ["Dan C.", "Excellent, authentic food. If you are looking to avoid the typical franchised restaurants and want some really good mexican dishes, this is a must. Inexpensive and better than most restaurants in the area.
