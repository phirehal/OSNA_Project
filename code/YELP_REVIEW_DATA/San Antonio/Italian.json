{"Capparellis Italian Food & Pizza On Southcross": [["Mongo L.", "There are several Capparelli's family restaurants in and around San Antonio. \u00a0This location has been my favorite for many years now. \u00a0I almost always make it in before 2pm, while the lunch specials are still being offered. \u00a0If you like just plain pasta and love a big, juicy meatball, this is the place for you! \u00a0The menus I posted here a while back are still accurate and list both the regular and lunch fare. \u00a0Can't go wrong with the spaghetti and the Ravioli is delicious too. \u00a0The bread you get with all the bowled entrees is just perfect - a half toasted loaf spread well with garlic butter. \u00a0The pizzas for lunch are great too, and a good value. \u00a0Live a little and try one with anchovies, they're always tasty! \u00a0You'll get a surprisingly good salad with your order, the house Italian oil/vinegar is delicious - they quit putting it on the table because too many walked off with it, but it's for sale if you ask.The service, whether based at the counter for lunch or table for dinner, is first-rate. \u00a0There's always someone here who's been here for years and regulars are greeted. \u00a0No one gets forgotten at this place, never had bad service. \u00a0Sure, it's not Paesano's but neither are the prices. \u00a0I should venture in more for the wider offerings but it's just hard to resist those huge meatballs. \u00a0Puts Chris Columbus Soc. dinner to shame, believe me!!!"], ["Roman G.", "My mother and girlfriend were craving Italian food. While they were deciding between Olive Garden or some other lame chain, I decided to consult the Yelp Oracle for some guidance in the culinary wasteland of Southside San Antonio. Once again the Oracle led me to a great eatery. \u00a0This time it was Caparrelli's Pizza. From the instant we entered, we felt welcome. The waitstaff were kind and engaging. My girlfriend, who has a degree in interior design, found the decor charming and delightful. But the real treat was when the food came out. I had the Nana's trio; ravioli, chicken parmesean, and lasagna. All three were delicious, but I especially loved the lasagna. My mother had the fettuccine alfredo and was thankful that she only ordered a half portion. The servings are very generous here. My girlfriend ordered shrimp alfredo with crab meat. She had to reluctantly stop eating because she did not get the half portion. However, she made sure to take the rest home.Before I close I need to add that their in house vinaigrette dressing is to die for. You can purchase a bottle for 5 dollars at the counter. All in all, the dining experience here was wonderful, and I will be sure to visit again. I hope you will too."], ["Nina S.", "Me and my daughter go often to the Pecan Valley location we absolutely love it..I get the chicken parm or grilled chicken Cesar salad..enough food for two!!

I got the manicotti with a \"meatball.\" \u00a0I wasn't sure if I heard our server correctly but I'm pretty sure she said do you want meat sauce or a meatball. \u00a0The meatball was great, it was juicy and thoroughly cooked. The sauce wasn't too bad, I prefer a little more zest but hey we all have different opinions of sauce. \u00a0For under $10 maybe even less, I got a drink, salad and a good portion of food. \u00a0Since, italian food tends to put me in a carb coma I think I will stick to eating here just for lunch.

Kale and figs was also very tasty. \u00a0Staff was a little slow but possibly because we were outside. \u00a0They were very friendly and manager came out to check on us several time. \u00a0Will definitely be back to try main menu."], ["Ardie S.", "We came to Zocca after dinner at Biga on the Banks for a nightcap before heading up to our rooms. \u00a0Part of our group had joined us after dinner at Charlie Wants a Burger.It was after 9 and it was also the night that the Rockets lost their NBA title bid. \u00a0We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the cool breeze and the river.Our beverages were fine. \u00a0What wasn't was our waitress' attitude.\"What are you drinking?\" she asked in a rushed tone.One in the party, nicely asked if there was a drink menu, presumably to try a featured beverage.Our waitress left in silence only to return two minutes later. \u00a0She slammed two menus down on the table and left in a huff.We stayed. \u00a0We ordered one round of drinks. \u00a0We weren't rowdy, just enjoying quiet conversation. \u00a0We also weren't in a hurry. \u00a0The patio was empty except for our table, which was close to the doors leading inside.Our waitress was back every 10 minutes, annoyingly so. \u00a0She must have come back five times in the hour or so we were there.Finally, when it was clear we wouldn't have any peace, we called for checks. \u00a0Miracle of miracles, she suddenly became very pleasant.The rest of our experiences in San Antonio, both at this hotel and elsewhere demonstrated the exemplary hospitality that this city is famous for. \u00a0Except Zocca.Honey, here's your tip: \u00a0Get a grip.P.S. It's really funny, the homeless father with his child in a stroller who asked us for money for food probably got more than she did. \u00a0It's not that we're not generous folk, you just have to show some respect."], ["Jen V.", "My first night in San Antonio... I'm hungry, tired, & I forgot to do any leg work as to where I'm having dinner! I hate Pizza Hut, McDonalds, etc... I'm in a big city, for God's sake!

Lovely dining by the riverwalk, superb service, simple, but divine menu... Easy-peasy, yum yum! Order 1/2 the size of pasta for your entree. \u00a0(Ask your server.) You'll fill up on their tasty, warm focaccia olive bread & olive oil, & soak in the views. 1/2 the order was more than enough. Other diners, I overheard, were repeat customers. Here at Zocca, you'll get authentic Italian cuisine, detailed, attentive service, & a pleasant ambiance on the riverwalk, located on the lowest level of the Westin. Don't miss it if you don't have to!"], ["Carrie C.", "Great Italian food on the River Walk. Located inside the Westin Hotel with patio seating for a wonderful River Walk view.

Both were very good."], ["Mandee K.", "I really want to give this place a better review but I was truly disappointed in the food. I'm not a hugely picky eater but we ordered the chicken fettuccine and the turkey panini - and the best thing was the bread they served and the French fries. In the pasta, the chicken had a from frozen taste and the peas were almost raw. The sauce lacked flavor and even with adding extra sauce and crushed red peppers - it wasn't cutting it for me. The turkey panini wasn't quite as bland, the jam and bacon combination was interesting and worth trying. The wait staff was nice and the atmosphere was nice on the river so they get two stars, but the food doesn't constitute any more."], ["Channah L.", "I was certainly surprised by the level of satisfaction found here at Zocca. Usually a restaurant on the river walk boasts view & not a plate to match but Zocca delivered on both!Zocca is nestled in a quiet section of the river near the western art museum. You won't find much hustle bustle over here but houses a gorgeous outstretch of the river & nearby bridges. Restaurant is connected to the Westin resort. We came for lunch & we're pleased to find a good selection of items from panninis, to pizza, pasta, salads & entrees. Prices ranged from $8-$25. Most times around $12. Pasta dishes were offered in half & full sizes which I love! We started with the soup Toscana, my Italian husband said it reminded him of his grandmothers. I was shocked but once I tasted it I could see why; deep, earthy, flavorful broth with finely cooked potatoes, white beans, orzo, kale & butternut squash- delicious! The caprese & ceaser were also very fresh, light & flavorful. I ordered the veal ravioli it was in a divine Marsala sauce saut\u00e9ed with cranberries, walnuts, kale & butternut squash. It was earthy, rich & I savored every bite. The parpadelle was also very amazing, the lemon bite worked so beautifully & the citrus cut the cream perfectly. The linguine itself tasted homemade with a fresh light texture. The spaghetti was also very good but not as much as the other two. Try out Zocca, it's such a pleasant surprise."], ["Chip D.", "I have been sitting here at the bar for about an hour - nursing a couple beers. That part is fine.The menu is limited and way overpriced (hence why the place is completely empty). All that said - as stated above, I am sitting at the \"nice\" bar and there has been a stack of dirty dishes stacked at the waitress stand for 30 minutes. Very unappetizing and disappointing - if the place is almost empty, it should be immaculate! I also hate to say it - all the staff sitting in the bar chatting is OK, but clean up the above mentioned plates! They are literally just standing around! To ad to this - the empty plates of my bar compatriots is a little disappointing as well (i.e. Their empty plates have been sitting in front of them for 20 or 30 minutes!).

Unlike some of the other reviews our service was excellent. We prefer attentiveness and not overbearing service. Our waiter John seemed to sense when and what we needed and provided it to us with minimal disruption. Food was great. I had the paparadelle with crab and a touch of lemon. The chef did not skimp on the white lump blue crab and presented the dish nicely. My wife had the meatballs...nice blend of veal, pork and beef.

Really a solid meal.In town for a series of research site visits, we stayed at the Westin. one night after getting back to the hotel rather late - we decided to eat at Zocca. Boy was that a good idea.The service was fantastic. Our server was polite, very knowledgable and extraordinarily efficient.We started the meal with salads and calamari. The mix of salty and variegated was the perfect way to prepare the palate for the richness of the pasta course. I had the risotto - which was great, but a little too \"fishy\" for my taste (I know - ironic that I should order a seafood risotto). My colleague ordered the ravioli and loved it. She said, \"I just wish I wasn't so stuffed or I'd eat the whole thing.\"Zocca is in an amazing location, has great food and is unpretentious. It is a goldmine of a place that deserves a visit if you are visiting from out of town or looking for a romantic dinner. My one complaint - the draft beer menu is really lackluster. With so many wonderful micro-brews in the area, it is amazing that Zocca doesn't fill their taps with local brews. Alas - they need to reconsider their beer menu; but, I didn't go for the beer - I went for the great food and decent wine pours. And those two items were spot on."], ["Jim G.", "I Should have followed my intuition and walked out when 1. Hostess had her Starbucks coffee cup on the hostess table 2. She sat my party of 2 at a four-top booth and did not clear the extra place settings. Neither did the server until prompted. Of note, we surveyed the other tables: Some had two fork place settings, some one, at the same table. We were offered bread but no bread plates. Other tables had bread plates. I would fault the manager for all this inconsistency. Staff was pleasant but not well trained. On to the food. I had the wedge Caesar which was very bland. Croutons were on the side which was a good thing as they were terrible restaurant supply out of a bag type and stale. Wife had a caprese which claimed to have burrata and heirlooms but again was low quality mozzarella and tomatoes, no basil. My pizza was soggy crusted, cheese wasn't entirely melted, and the sauce was straight from a can variety. This despite the claims they had a pizza oven. If they do they are not making them right. My wife's bolognese dish was a gelatinous blob. With a tune up this place could be above average but as it stands, there are many better choices on the Riverwalk."], ["Ann C.", "Having been traveling the country reviewing pet friendly hotels and restaurants. \u00a0The restaurant at Westin Riverwalk called \"Zocca\", looked inviting and as we were guests, we made sure with the front desk that after driving 10 hours from New Orleans LA that it would not be a problem to dine outdoors with our dog. Having done this all the way from Pennsylvania without issue, we were immediately \"greeted\" by a young woman who MUST be the restaurant manager? At least her demeanor would suggest that she was. She proceeded to tell us that normally they do not let pets at the patio seating. She had no reply when I told her that I was JUST told differently. Simply that it would be \"ok as we are not busy\" As arrogant as she was, I hope the meal is to die for, at such an affluent establishment! (Sarcasm) These people need to check with the rest of the country on what it means to Be \"Pet Friendly\" We know they don't allow pets inside in the dining room. \u00a0This is in no way a review of the Westin Riverwalk Hotel as a whole. Just the restaurant. It would behoove some to turn down their arrogance a notch or two. The hotel itself is beautiful and the in hotel staff very friendly. The food was delicious. Hot. Reasonable wait. Had the Tagliatelle. Highly recommend. Too bad it was spoiled at the onset."], ["Msvirgo W.", "Absolutely amazing place to dine!My husband and I celebrated our anniversary there on the 4th of July. The waiter brought us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne as soon as we were seated. The food was so delicious that I can't put it in words.

The wait staff was very attentive and there was even a manager that walked through on a continuous basis, ensuring that everyone had what they needed. The food was hot and very flavorful. The hashbrowns were flavorful, even without ketchup, and had the perfect spices. The omelette was made from fresh ingredients and was just a little larger than I expected. \u00a0I can't wait to try dinner here!"], ["Katy Q.", "Brunch review - I ordered a salmon bagel, and expected it to be kind of like a breakfast sandwich. Instead I got few slices of salmon, a salad, and a side of plain bagel. Perhaps I did not read the menu description accurately, but I was disappointed.The others ordered traditional entrees - Benedicts and Omelets - and cleared their plates. Their hash browns looked especially tasty.Service was OK. I was impressed that our waiter could remember all the small details of our orders (although he did forget the toast for my friend).

Excellent restaurant and definitely one to come back to again and again when we come back to the riverwalk."], ["Ashley M.", "I attended Zocca today for lunch with my family who is here visiting from New York. It came highly recommended by a friend who had dinner there a few years ago, and on other sites it got pretty good ratings so we thought it couldn't disappoint. Boy were we wrong!Where to begin? Service seemed to be prompt in the beginning, as our drink orders were taken just about 2 minutes after we sat down. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. About 5 minutes later the calamari (but not the drinks) were served to us. It was so rubbery and tough and chewy that it wasn't even edible - we had it sent back.Close to 10 minutes after drink orders had been taken we flagged down our waitress and had to ask if we'd been forgotten. She came back with our drinks just a few seconds later, so I'm inclined to believe we had.She then took our lunch orders and away she went. At this point we noticed that every other table that was seated for lunch had been brought some bread baskets - but not us. Nope.I ordered a cup of the minestrone which was good, although a little under-seasoned, but would turn out to be the best part of my meal. Food came out and my mom had to send it back immediately. She had ordered the turkey panini with bacon and cheese, no onions, no aioli, and no tomato. It came out with everything and what looked to be *extra* aioli. The waitress returned again with the new sandwich and now there was turkey, bacon, and caramelized onions - but no cheese. She didn't feel like waiting so she just dealt with it.I ordered the half portion of veal ravioli and the half portion of fettuccine to share with my dad. The bell pepper coulis on the ravioli was good, but the filling was horrid. Dry, over salted, and completely crumbled off the fork. Not good.The fettuccine was ok, a little better, but terribly bland.I will say that they were good enough to take my mom's panini off the check without us having said anything because the waitress knew it had been wrong again, and they brought out a complimentary tiramisu for my brother (new Air Force graduate and newlywed) which was a lovely touch. The ambiance here is beautiful, but the food left a whole lot to be desired. Maybe dinner is better? I wouldn't go back for lunch though, that's for darn sure."], ["Roxanna M.", "I will give 5 ***** everytime!!! The food was amazing and the service impeccable. The view to the Riverwalk was beautiful, i went at sunset time!! This is a special place for a romantic dinner by the river in San Antonio. I expected to pay more for the entire, wonderful dinner. We ordered two appetizers , the calamari and the watermelon salad. For the Entree we ordered fettuccine pasta with home made. Alfredo and prosciutto. For dessert we enjoyed the Tiramisu. I you dont buy a wine. The price is reasonable, but if you would like to accompany the dinner with a wine, there are several good ones not so cheap. My husband and I dont drink wine, we ordered a bottle of water. :) which was great with all the food we ate."], ["Sarah C.", "I'm reluctant to give away my secret! This restaurant has Riverwalk views, heated outdoor seating areas, and a delicious menu. \u00a0I had the crab cakes, and the kale and fig salad. The prices rival that of other loud tourist places that serve fried frozen food on the Riverwalk. The service is excellent."], ["Quay M.", "David and I decided that a short trip to San Antonio was in order and we booked a room at the Hotel Contessa, which is pretty much next door to the Westin along the Riverwalk. We skipped our hotel's restaurant and ended up at Zocca on more than one occasion. We were pleased with both visits.The first night we went for dinner and I ordered the chicken marsala. It was to die for! It was seriously the best chicken marsala I've ever had - and from a hotel restaurant, to boot! Who would've thunk it? The risotto it was paired with was some of the best I've had while dining out. My boyfriend got the sea bass, which he said was pretty solid, but I think he's had much better.The second time we dropped by for lunch. We started off with the calamari, which was the only downfall of this place. It wasn't very good at all. We finished maybe half of the order. I got the chicken breast sandwich with pasta salad, my boyfriend the caprese with local lettuces. Both were very delicious plates.Our server for both visits was a guy named Daniel, who was absolute perfection in his role. He was incredibly nice, friendly, and gave us lots of helpful tips about other places to check around town, including a place we were able to catch the Penguins hockey game. I would totally come back to this place on visits to San Antonio, which is so odd to say about a hotel restaurant! But if you're staying near the Riverwalk, I highly recommend this place."], ["Cindy S.", "Popped in for lunch here and thought it was mediocre. I got the Biztecca panini (shaved beef with caramelized onions, cheese, and bell pepper) with local lettuces (house salad with feta cheese, olives, and honey vinaigrette) as my side. The salad is the only item worth mentioning; the dressing was light and tasty. The sandwich was disappointing and tasted like roast beef. The bread was not grilled or toasted (isn't that the cornerstone of a panini??), and service was subpar in the bar area."], ["Derek R.", "'Great atmosphere, right on a quiet bend of The Riverwalk.

We went there for breakfast and dinner (that's how much we enjoyed it).For breakfast the biscuit sandwich and crab cake eggs benedict were delicious.For dinner we had short ribs and veal ravioli which both were good, but both under seasoned.

The ham was served with their pomegranate reduction sauce which was amazingly delightful. Their stuffing was incredible. The service was wonderful. The best part of the meal were the desserts. As far as desserts go, this is one of the best places on the Riverwalk. Their bourbon pecan pie is probably the most delicious I've ever had! I can't rave enough about their pecan pie...

It was so refreshing and delicious, with feta cheese on top, balsamic reduction and some type of green on top. Next we split a pappadelle (can't remember the exact name of it) and the pasta is fresh and has a rustic feel to it which I loved, the sauce was perfect, not too creamy and overwhelming.

Once I saw orrechietti on the menu, I knew I had to have it. The best part? Zocca offers either a small or large version of each dish! The small is the ideal serving when you're craving the comfort of pasta, but trying not to go overboard. It was served in a sweet, basil-y homemade tasting red sauce, with some plump shrimp that were cooked perfectly- amen! You could tell the orrechietti was made with tender love and care, with that ideal al-dente texture and flavor.

He is an asset to the restaurant and he made our dining experience extremely pleasurable with his expertise and attentiveness. Wish all waiters were as great as him. Now for the food. Does this place do anything wrong? I started off with a double appetizer of the zocca meatball and the bruschetta and I am still blown away by the excellence of both appetizers. The bruschetta was a culinary masterpiece like few can aspire to create and the meatball was a decadent creation that was extremely delicious and huge and the sauce was delectable. Let's move on to the ceaser wedge. Totally delicious and the way a wedge salad should be done. For the main course I had the tagliatelle pasta which was out of this world. It had bolognese sauce with beef, veal, and pork and it was a decadent explosion of flavor that still has my taste buds singing. My wife had the salmon with pesto and I had a taste of it and it was also packed with unbelievable flavor. The portions are pretty big and this place is very well run.

I made a quick reservation via my Yelp app and we were all set for dinner.We were seated immediately upon arrival at a table no more than five feet away from the Riverwalk. Ordering was easy because I already knew what I wanted: the tagliatelle. My dining companions ordered a vegetarian fettuccine and a Caesar salad. Both were delicious, but what stole the show was my dish. The perfectly al dente tagliatelle was served with lump crab and zucchini ribbons in a lemon cream sauce. The lemon really added a nice tang to what would otherwise be a heavy dish--perfect for a balmy evening. So delish! My only gripe is how slow service was at times.

For appetizers we ordered the Cesar salad (very good!) and the garlic knots with olives. The knots would have been better if they were a bit lighter. They were too dense for my liking. I also feel like the garlic butter could have been more flavorful. However, the warm olives were delicious. If I couldn't get the olives by themselves I would order the whole dish again just to get the olives. Our main course was the house pizza. SOOO good! The crust was perfect and I'm not really a pizza crust kinda person. Can't wait to try some of the other pizza varieties. For dessert we had the tiramisu. I'm really picky about tiramisu and this is one of the best I've had. I would definitely order this again and again. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because the garlic knots could have been better and it feels like that is one of their signature dishes. (I could have made that up in my head though.) And our server, although polite, was very rushed in his mannerisms and speech. This restaurant, although not super high end, still feels like a nice place and I would have expected a better dining experience from our server. When putting fresh pepper on our salad he got pepper all over the table including in my water. I didn't mention it because, whatever. But, if he had slowed down a bit and been more careful it wouldn't have happened in the first place. The same thing with the cheese all over the pizza. He was grating so fast and furious chunks of cheese were flying everywhere. We had to bring it to his attention that there was a huge chunk of cheese laying near our feet.

Didn't care for the sauce really, more an orangy marinara than a true red sauce. Since sauce and bread are so essential for me when I consider Italian, this place is not on my preferred list based on my food experience today.

The complimentary garlic knots are pretty dang tasty: soft, just baked dough a top a ton of melted butter, parm cheese, and parsley?? You'd have to be dead inside to not chipmunk cheek 'em! (Caveat: if they're not fresh out of the oven, I get it)Skip the artichoke appetizer...meh....it took up too much valuable tummy real estate & wasn't worth it, in my opinion.We shared the chicken piccata, ravioli, & Brie, arugula & mushroom pizza. ALL quite delectable...the best was the ravioli (also, with a PILE of arugula in the middle of the plate, score!). They were homemade & I loved the addition of pistachio inside the ravioli & combined into the cream sauce. A true 5 star dish!The chicken piccata was good...chicken was a bit dry. Dish as a whole was a bit too over salted, especially with pancetta in there. The pizza was good as well....no trace of grease on the crust, which is pan. I liked that the crust wasn't soggy anywhere considering the large size of the pie. The toppings were 3 of my fav foods ever so I'm biased: Brie, mushroom, arugula. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood!"], ["Anna R.", "We are pretty regular here, when I remember I check-in on Yelp. This is my first review for Tiu Stepppi's Osteria though.

Go Adrienne, you spoil us when we come here. Sergio you are always awesome, friendly and you make us feel like family.Tonight our server was \"Jersey Robert\", thank you for the service you extended us.My husband and I both \u00a0ordered the Shrimp Scampi which has a white wine garlic broth, cherry tomatoes and sits over a bed of fettuccine pasta. For our antipasti we got one of our favorites, the Mozzarella Di Bufala Fritti, this is not as consistent as we would like, 3 out of the 5 times we have had this the tomato sauce was cold. Tonight it was warm as it should be. For dessert we had the Cappachino chocolate concoction which was amazing. Other visits we have had their greek salad, which is always consistent with flavor; red onion, feta, black olives and red pepper. Also the Saltimbocca shrimp which is saut\u00e9ed with sage, artichokes, cherry tomatoes, with lemon butter sauce over fettuccine. Mine was without the Prosciutto. This place has an awesome calamari that is served with a spicy Marinara sauce (can't get enough of this.) Their roasted artichoke heart antipasti is served in a dish right out of the oven - Yum.... I am not a fan of their caprese salad the arugula is overpowering for this salad.One of my favorite staples here is the Shrimp Arrabiatta which is extremely good. I get mine with Shrimp and this is a spicy red wine marinara sauce with cherry tomatoes, artichokes, black olives and parmesan cheese and when they say spicy, they mean it with this dish! They have made this for me without the pasta and substituted it with spinach. We have also enjoyed their Margherita pizza which is truly one of the best I have had anywhere, the mozzarella di bufala is a generous portion on each slice.I am a pescatarian and have found that there is a nice selection on their menu for seafood eaters. Make sure to ask for the \"specials\" this is when I discovered an awesome sea bass that was prepared on it's own. The fish was baked to perfection. I would like to see fish options on their regular menu! \u00a0Oh yeah, please consider bringing back your dessert, \"donuts and coffee!\""], ["Arlene T.", "Went to this place last night. \u00a0Read some great things on Yelp...

Food? 4 1/2 stars. I had the ravioli which was to die for. Rustic, flavorful - I wiped the plate for sauce with the most amazing garlic knots. My husband got a made to order pizza. Which was also really great! (Get the meatballs, you won't be disappointed). However, service was spotty. Hence the three stars. The hostess was kind to open our door upon arrival. But it was slow. Sunday night. No reason no one could not have greeted us quickly at the table. We had to flag down same hostess to get waters and order wine. Miscommunication and no one knew or seemed to care initially about our table. Finally bartender took care of us. We did ask a random server about something that came out of the kitchen. He apparently asked but said - I don't know what it was, the chefs are too busy to ask. What??!Regardless, we will be back. It's great food and close to our house. Definitely needed in this area.

THE CHICKEN PICATTAIn this strip mall, you might not believe me this is one the most authentic Italian meals I've ever had; it's quite unassuming. But once you're inside and take a whiff of what's going on you'll kiss me on both cheeks. The wine list: extensive and the menu: impressive with something for everyone (pizza, pasta, garlic knots, etc.)I highly recommend going with the baked artichokes for an app to split with a couple people. It's flavorful with a breaded crust on top and won't fill you up too much before the main course. The Chicken Picatta is my favorite. The serving size is enormous; will become your next couple of lunches as well! Served with a garlic knot, this dish is perfect. The noodles are al dente and the chicken is packed with flavor. I opt for the alredo cream sauce to enjoy on the side with my chicken.That's amore!"], ["Tiffany S.", "I've eaten here two times at least now for Sunday dinner and just love it. The authentic and delicious taste is ideal, while service has been hit or miss.My husband and I can eat here for $30 sharing the caprese salad, a house pizza and dessert. We love every bit of it. We recently shared a tiramisu and coffee as well and were not disappointed. The coffee is french pressed right at the table for you and served with fresh cream. The tiramisu was fantastic, better than the chocolate torte we shared last time. We also appreciated that they carry a gluten free dough option, as my mother in law has a horrible gluten reaction. She enjoyed \"The Greek\" pizza on gluten free crust."], ["Mama F.", "Went with mom and sister. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan for lunch- was very bland, pasta was hard and stuck together in places.

Thanks to Yelp, I came across this local gem.Food Rating 5/5:We had 3 tired, picky kids with us and they gobbled down the garlic knots faster than the adults could think to get our hands on one. The half pepperoni half cheese pizza the kids shared looked delicious, but I was holding out for something different. My mom and I shared the caprese salad and the 16 oz ribeye special served with pasta. Both of our dishes were made to perfection and bursting with flavor. I never order dessert but it seemed that it would be a, missed opportunity if I didn't, \u00a0so we all shared the chocolate capuccino torte which literally melted in our mouths!Service Rating 5/5: Ask for Adrian when you visit. He was extremely attentive and took care of all our requests big and small. He showed great care in explaining the menu and answering or questions, \u00a0eager to make sure we had a wonderful dining experience. \u00a0The ambiance of this restaurant would be a great date night location or a place to unwind with friends after a hectic work week.

The antipasto with olive/cheese was a plate of old wilted lettuce, few pieces of cheese, few slices of meat, and three olives on this BIG'ol plate For $10, they can do better with this appetizer, at least the presentation so I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. The spaghetti and meatballs was not so good at all. The frozen turkey meatballs at HEB have more flavor and substance. These meatballs were the size of marbles and seemed old and hard with little flavor. The sauce is what got the two stars. I wish I had ordered something different."], ["Margaret H.", "I don't even have words...but I'm going to try. I'm still here at the restaurant and felt compelled to write a review. That's how good my food was. I'm not sure how often they have the ribeye steak special that I just had either, but if you are lucky enough to visit when they have it, order it! It's a thick, juicy ribeye steak covered with a five cheese blend that perfectly compliments the meat...not overpowering like a Gorgonzola or Bleu cheese, but just the right amount of flavor. It's served with a thin pasta with prosciutto, the most flavorful tomatoes I've ever eaten, and artichokes. The sauce on it is delicate and creamy and perfect. My 4-year-old had the cheese pizza from the Bambini menu and even it was amazing. The quality of the cheese and the flavor of the sauce is outstanding...much better than my child can appreciate at her age, but she still loved it. It's huge too...could easily feed 2-3 big kids. This place doesn't even compare to chains like OG or Carino's. It's so much better for the same price. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. It's Wednesday night and not too crowded, but they use the No Wait app, so you can save your place in line before you get here if you come on a busy night. The ambience is very nice without being pretentious. This is only my second time here, but this will be our regular Italian go-to spot for sure."], ["Jessy B.", "Mmmmm.... mmmmm... \u00a0mmmmm... foodgasm... ordered the Caprese salad for appetizer, glass of white wine, shared the Chicken Picata and a Brie & Mushroom woodfired pizza with complimentary garlic knots.... for dessert the lemon panna cotta with raspberry topping and a garnish of strawberry and mint ... everything was fabulous! \u00a0The ambiance is gorgeous, the service was excellent... everything was delicious...

My wife and I tried the $15 three-course Culinaria lunch special, and each course was better than the last. The soup of the day was a creamy blend of mushrooms and roasted red peppers. It had a really spicy kick that I found delicious. The artichoke ravioli with prosciutto and scallions was an absolute triumph, and the \"doughnuts and coffee\" dessert was one of the best things I've ever had. Everything was hearty and very satisfying. This is real stick-to-your-ribs food. I'm a huge fan of Two Step, but I hadn't been all that keen on trying their Italian offshoot--and it was all because of the stupid name! But don't make the same mistake I did. Get to this place ASAP!

My SO had the special which was a chicken breast wrapped in pancetta, which he thought tasted okay, nothing special. I had a pasta, but I can't remember which one-- it just wasn't memorable at all. Great presentation, but the taste just didn't match it.Service: Fine. Environment: The restaurant itself was clean.

San Antonio Yelpers suggested Tiu Steppi's, so off we went! After passing Two Step, the origin behind the restaurant's name was abundantly clear. The restaurant is in a small section of a strip mall, but the interior was gorgeously decorated, even including lamps lit with real fire. Terrific atmosphere.We ordered the mozzarella fritti as our appetizer, and a large house special with pepperoni instead of the prosciutto. The appetizer was crispy, and surrounded by the most delicious vodka sauce ever (our server said it was marinara, but it tasted more like vodka sauce). A perfect start.The pizza came out (with two additional pots of the vodka sauce brought out by our thoughtful server when he found out we loved it), and was absolutely delicious. Honestly, yes, there was a little too much ricotta on it for my tastes, but overall the pizza was good. The sun dried tomatoes were juicy (rare, that), and the pepperoni was obviously high quality. A great place, and we will probably try it again whenever we're in town."], ["K B.", "Nice place, comfortable and not to loud for dinner at 8:30pm. Service was great along with food. Excellent menu. Definitely going back."], ["Ed R.", "The saying don't let appearances fool you applies here. If your looking for that Italian place to take coworkers for lunch, a lover for dinner, a place to sit and talk, this is it.

For example, last time I came here I had the Chicken Saltimboca. It lacked seasoning to my taste and was heavy on the sauce which made the food overly greasy. I mean it was ok, but that's as far as I can go. I've never tried a pizza but perhaps I should next time I go because folks seem to like how they are made here. My girlfriend had a simple ravioli which she couldn't eat because it was too rich. On the plus side, they do have a decent selection of beer for such a small restaurant which I like. Service was adequate, though our particular server wasn't overly friendly. Pretentious is how I'd describe him. Nevertheless, he was attentive so that somewhat makes up for his disposition. At the end of the day, if I'm on that side of town, I might go back. Just to give it one last shot.

In fact since moving to Texas 11 months ago I would say its my favorite restaurant in Texas thus far hands down.

I tried 3 different dishes because the manager kept coming by asking if I would like to try something else after seeing the look of disgust on my face.I had a mediocre server who seemed preoccupied and rushed me through placing my order. He didn't deserve a tip but since my husband was in food service in college before joining the Army he insisted we tipped him anyway. I don't usually tip for you to be rude and disrespectful towards me.The manager kept checking in on us and based off of his unparalleled customer service I give this place two stars.

The Greek salad was a nice large salad. The Caesar is a little interesting. You understand why its called Knife & fork quickly because you get the entire head of romaine with a house made dressing with 2 anchovies. Its hard to cut the lettuce & the top of the the lettuce leafs have dressing but the middle & bottom do not get any dressing so you just end up having lettuce- so its so-so.The pepperoni pizza was a little on the greasy side & a little salty- thin crust, garlicky sauce. Our 2nd pizza was the house pizza a 5 cheese pizza w/sun dried tomatoes & prosciutto. First I have to disclose that I am not a fan of ricotta so this was not my fave. The texture of the ricotta overwhelms the pizza. Prosciutto had quite a bit of fat chunks so that also really did not add to the pizza - it actually took away from it. I like prosciutto on the drier side for pizza so again- disappointed. The sun dried tomatoes were lost. What was really surprising was the interesting selection of draft beer like a blue star brew and a Sam Adams Belgium that my husband had never seen (and that is VERY unusual). They sell growlers for $6 and fills for $16 which is pretty good. The growlers is a plain brown one and they slap a sticker on it (weird). I've never seen a growler from a business that just has a sticker on it usually the are etched or printed. The place is decorated nicely with dark woods and nice decor, but whats the deal with the 2 large TVs? Does a restaurant that does not have a separate bar really need TVs? I don't get it.

It just shows that the preparers are sloppy and don't care. \u00a0I doubt I will return."], ["Denise H.", "My husband and I went here a few weeks ago upon the recommendations of the yelp reviewers and you all did not disappoint. The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming. The service was fast and helpful with wine selections and entree selections. The price was just right. We ordered the calamari to start and it was some of the best calamari we have ever had; tender and NOT overcooked. The sauces that accompanied the calamari were also very tasty. I ordered the Chicken Piccata and my husband ordered the Chicken Osso Buco. There was so much food we could not finish it - we asked for a take away container and ate it again the next night for dinner! Of course we could not leave without dessert. I had the Creme Brulee and my my husband had the tiramisu. Both desserts were fabulous. We will definitely be coming back here again. Thank you Tiu Steppi's Osteria for a wonderful night out."], ["Wayne B.", "My wife and I visited this restaurant last night on the recommendation of a friend.Happy to say it was a good experience!The wine list is adequate and the Cab I had was very good.The server offered a few tastings that is always appreciated when you're paying $9-10 a glass.My wife was thrilled that they had Heineken beer which is not always available.We arrived early (5PM) and allowed to sit wherever we wanted to.I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and my wife ordered the Eggplant.The food, in general, was okay.

After reviewing on yelp we decided to try this place for a nice Italian. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is very clean and feels like an authentic Italian. The dinner menu was disappointedly limited to a handful of meals with only one being chicken. My wife is a huge Italian fan and didn't fancy anything off the dinner menu and asked if she could have the chicken Parmesan off the lunch menu, they were fine with that. I ordered the chicken meal off the dinner menu it was ok just average really and my wife said the same for hers. We had the garlic dots which were average again but the calamari was very good, My 2 daughters had cheese Pizza which was freshly made and very good. I am the only coffee drinker and was charged $8 for a pot of Coffee which is a little high in my book. we also ordered the chocolate dessert with raspberry sauce and I am not a big dessert fan but this one is probably the best dessert I have had this year was superb. for 2 adults and 2 children it was just short of $100 including tip, I probably wont visit again when I am in San Antonio as it really was just average and over priced."], ["R M.", "This is truly a sad case of great potential with a sad ending.

Hubby and I both enjoyed the food. It's a nice little place to enjoy a private, romantic dinner or even have a small get together with a few friends.

This will be on our short list of cozy little no-fuss date night places."], ["Kacie H.", "The Good: The pizza! It was just delicious! Not so thin that you had to roll it up. I rolled mine up anyway, but I didn't have to. That is how I prefer it. My 6 year old said his prosciutto pizza at Dough was better (this prosciutto was a little on the spicy side) but he still ate it. My 11 year old daughter liked her buffalo moz cheese pizza better here, as did I (mine w/ sun dried tomatoes). It's the crust. It has substance. Which I like.The value! I ordered way too much food. It was cool because we ate pizza for a late night snack and lunch. My 5 and 6 year old boys could have split one kids pizza. It was pretty big. The 12 inches me and my daughter got were exceptionally large for a 12 inch. All in all the prices are great for this kind of pizza.Dat Tiramisu! I think we all know how hard it is to find good Tiramisu. I have only been in San Antionio a few months now, and compared to Maggiano's and IL Sogno \u00a0(which isn't even real Tiramisu) this takes the cake. It's made in house, and authentic!The Bad:Wine. I ordered a Pinto Nior. It was cold. I never had cold red wine before. It was not enjoyable. I didn't say anything. I'll just have beer next time, or maybe express my cold red wine concern.The In between:The atmosphere is really nice, but the place is terribly small, no waiting area, and not much room for the servers to move around. It felt nice though, it felt like I was at someones house. The tall ceilings were nice, and the kitchen was constantly poppin.The service. My server was a little inattentive. Being a single woman w/ three small children, I don't take to well to that. His saving grace was his team. One of the other servers explained the desserts to me, very well I might add, and he helped him wrap everything up. The manager/owner also visted the table, which is always nice. Next time he should introduce himself."], ["Trudy P.", "Great pizza and super atmosphere! Can't wait to come back. The House pizza is a great choice if you want pizza but not the heaviness. The sun-dried tomatoes are lightly dried so as to give you the fresh tomato flavor. There is also the right balance of cheese with the five cheese mix and pancetta to bring it all together. A great and welcome addition of high-quality food for the area."], ["Sunay P.", "If you had told me that I had the chance to have a decent pizza, apps and wine on tap in a strip center kinda in Helotes...I would not have believed it...but sure enough Tie Steppi's proves the existence of such a place.A welcoming hostess and nice inside space greet diners as they walk in. \u00a0One thing that you discover is that when you sit on the banquettes you get the glare of the parking lot light in your eyes, and couple that with \"mood\" lighting about your head, and it somewhat feels like an interrogation. \u00a0But you can get over it pretty quickly as you order a glass of their wines on tap (these are nothing spectacular, but they are again priced for not being spectacular, which is greatly appreciated) and peruse the menu with genial wait staff.The menu is small but well executed. \u00a0On a recent visit the olive and garlic knot appetizer was a hit and miss all at the same time. \u00a0The olives were warm and briny with and great with the herby olive oil. The garlic knots left us in knots wondering why they were chewy and flavorless. \u00a0The roasted artichokes shows us that a humble frozen artichoke heart can be transformed by sauteing in butter (but really...what tastes bad after being sauteed in butter??) and gratineed with parmesan and breadcrumbs. \u00a0The only quibble is the use of shredded packaged parm which just becomes bendy instead of toasty. \u00a0But this was pretty tasty!The pizza itself could have cooked a little longer, but had the crust had a very nice crumb. texture (pulling the dough apart revealed a nice texture of gluten strands and bubbles) and flavor. \u00a0We got the wild mushroom mix (turned out to mainly cremini mushrooms, but beautifully sauteed before going on the pizza) and caramelized garlic (again a really nice job with whole cloves of garlic which had just a tinge of bite, but more of a gentle sweetness) on the pizza, which garnered us a strange look from the waiter but was quite good, and was even better warmed up the next day (in a nonstick skilled on the stove till crispy) and a fried egg on top.The dessert was quite the surprise. \u00a0We ordered the cappuccino and chocolate torte, and this came out looking very messy and thrown together, and a departure from what was expected (a very pleasant departure by the way). \u00a0I expected a nice dense torte, and got a lighter almost mouse like torte with a chocolate ganache covering. \u00a0The flavors were spot on with the gentle coffee merging well with the ganache that melted on your tongue in each bite. \u00a0 This was a really well done dessert and worked very well with the unsweetened whipped cream that was served with it. \u00a0I detected a faint hint of espresso in the whipped cream, that certainly enhanced the dessert. \u00a0Most people may complain about the serving size (on the small side). but we felt \u00a0this was the perfect size : enough to satiate the desired sweetness, but not enough to overwhelm you.I am at 3.5 stars right now, but do plan more visits to redo the review."], ["Gabriella F.", "I love love love this place!

I had a pizza, but snacked on some lasagne, pesto spicy sausage pasta, and chicken pasta. Everything was very flavorful, fresh, and delicious. The lasagna is a bit different since it includes pepperoni. The spicy sausage is sliced thinly, but has a good kick. The marguerite pizza has fresh tomatoes and basil. The pizza is slight chewy which an average crust. The outside crust is folded over to be crispy and chewy. You will notice when eating here that they have Italian dishes like other restaurants, but everything has an extra garlic flavor and taste that other restaurants don't. The hardest part is waiting for your food. It took about 30 minutes and my pizza was delivered first.

I feel that traditional tiramisu needs to have that coffee flavor in every bite and this dessert delivers on that. Though a traditional tiramisu is layers of coffee soaked lady fingers and mascarpone filling this one has all of its lady fingers at the bottom, rather than this detracting from the visual appeal of the dessert it ensures that with every bite there will be an even ratio of filling to cookie as the fingers are all packed together. The mascarpone filling is soft and fluffy and practically spreads its flavor throughout the mouth every bite you take and the cocoa powder sticks to the mascarpone rather than chokes the customer by inhaling loose powder. While some lady figures can be soaked so thoroughly that they are water logged or too dry this one manages to be moist and soft without it being too much of one or the other while still giving a moderately mild but sweet coffee flavor. All in all, the two layers work harmoniously, the contrast of the smooth and fluffy mascarpone to soft and sponge lady fingers is inviting enough for a second (or third!) portion."], ["Rachel C.", "Love this place!

They are both delicious and fit together perfectly on their bed of spaghetti noodles. Outside they had basil plants growing in pots so I'm assuming even that is fresh.So my reason for only giving three stars is that even though I enjoyed my meal my husband was very disappointed. His chicken was burnt, like actually black around the edges burnt! Also they noodles used for his dish were thin and did not satisfy his taste due to there texture. His dish was not worth the 30 minute drive across town so I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here since they are obviously inconsistent with their cooking but I am sure whenever he is doing things for his unit on Ft.

Well the consistency reminded me of fondue , but that's what made it so great. It was so cheesy and the real spinach pieces just added so much goodness. The pizza was so so.

The extra mozzarella cheese they use is different and very creamy almost like the dip. The experience was nice cause you do everything yourself.

Last time I went, I ordered the Linguine Alfredo pasta with spinach, onions, jalape\u00f1os and tomatoes. They forgot to add the tomatoes, so I was a bit disappointed, but I was so hungry I ate it anyway. It's okay though, the other ingredients made the dish wonderful. Oh, I know what you're thinking-- wtf, jalape\u00f1os on Alfredo? Yeah, it is weird, huh? I liked it though, and here's the thing- when I was ordering it, the staff didn't give me even the slightest judgmental look/tone of voice when she put the order in. I love that! The complimentary bread with butter is very delicious, but the pasta serving is so huge that I barely finished one slice of bread.

Overall, the staff was the high point of the visit for me.(4) The parking is ample but you have to three the needle to get in/out of the parking lot.(5) Despite being on the always busy Austin Highway, the location is good if you are an 09-dweller like we are.To be honest, since I like a bit more flavorful food, we probably won't be back, but I understand the folks who make this place a regular stop."], ["Charlene C.", "I will start by sharing that the restaurant was busy when I visited. With that being said, service, for me, was nonexistent. I ordered a bowl of soup, some garlic cheese bread and a piece of cake. It took over 30 mins for the waitress to stop at our table and deliver food. When she did, she only brought my husband's food. I let her know my food was missing and she said it would be right out. Ten minutes passed, another waitress passed our table. I let her know my food was missing. She told me it would be \u00a0delivered shortly. After she left, I realized that my husband's and my desserts had not been delivered. So I stood in line for about 15 mins to request them them to go. At that time, three bowls of soup were in the window. I assumed one was mine and would be delivered to my table as promised. I got back to my table with the desserts and there was no bowl of soup. I went back to the counter to inform our waitress that I still had not received my dinner and requested a refund. It was only then that they promised to bring a bowl right away without anymore delay.

My romantic mind tells me I want to go here on a cold rainy night with a friend, order a glass of wine, and enjoy the wonderful smell of garlic and butter cooking on the stove. Now, this place is a 'joint\" not pretentious dining. I get a sense of enjoyment seeing the large tables of younger customers drinking pitchers of beer and eating great pizza. It reminds me of my college years. A table of guys or girls just hanging out and shooting the bull.This time when I was here, I ordered a stromboli with beef. Everything here always taste fresh, and this last time that I was here was no exception. My friend had the Greek Salad, and it too was fresh, large and nicely accompanied with cheese, olives, and peppers.Whenever I come here, it's funny, the seating, especially the booths, allow you to engage in great conversation with your other diners, the overall atmosphere creates a feeling of intimacy and cheerfulness.The Purple Garlic is a joint with a vibe.

And, leaving a restaurant with some additional bills in wallet after having a couple of drinks and eating some great food..ain't a bad thing! It just seems to happen less often."], ["Nikki M.", "When it comes to restaurants, does customer service trump taste and accuracy? In my experience at Purple Garlic, I brought the rating up by 1 star to verify that it does. For starters, I have gestational diabetes and have to watch what I eat in terms of carbs, meaning good carbs mixed with a balance of proteins and my sugar level won't hit the roof. We saw that PG had whole wheat crusts which I can have, so we ordered one with numerous veggie and meat toppings, accompanied by a starter salad with Italian dressing. The cashier/server/busser seemed to be new and didn't know how to ring the order up with a whole wheat crust, so didn't charge us right away since he couldn't find his manager.As we sat down, I took out my sugar testing kit and right away the kitchen manager shot over to us. He said he felt the need to tell me that the Italian dressing had 3 tbls of sugar in the whole batch, and the tomato sauce on the pizza had a lot of sugar as well. I was extremely thankful for the warning and changed the pizza sauce to pesto. He alerted the cooks to change our order and as it mentions on the menu, the pizza took about 20 minutes. When they brought it out, I noticed the crust was not whole wheat. By then, the kitchen manager had left and the new server seemed aloof about the whole thing. He brought over another server to see what the problem was and then went about his duties. I asked for a personal pizza (by this time I was very hungry and just wanted sustenance) on whole wheat with pesto and all the same toppings. It took another 15-20 minutes for my order to come, at which point my boyfriend had already eaten his share of the larger pizza and was done.The manager came over, apologized for the error and offered to comp the entire meal. Although we thought this was a more than generous proposal and declined, he wouldn't take our payment. The server came back and apologized as well as it was his error for not making the order correct in the first place.All in all, the pizza was pretty good and we left satisfied more so because we were taken care of as customers."], ["Vickie V.", "Good pizza and super friendly service.

The people working were somewhat kind. It was a little selective as to who the kindness was shown, it wasn't me.

So I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. They only had Pepsi products, I'm not a fan of Pepsi, so I went for the sweet tea. It was all out. I then just said whatever, and got Pepsi instead. I also ordered some garlic bread with cheese. It took quite a while for the bread to come out, I went during lunch and it was surprisingly not very busy. As I received the bread, it was burnt and the cheese wasn't to my liking. The Alfredo was their only saving grace.

We started with cheesy garlic bread and Cesar salad, which was about average. I will say that my salad had only one crouton on it, and that the regular (non-cheesy) freebie bread that they brought out was completely flavorless. I had the chicken parmigiana, which was easily large enough for 2 people. I've had this dish at Italian places all over the country, from 4-star to fazoli's, so needless to say it's a favorite. Unfortunately, their version of this classic lacks flavor. While it seems like they might actually bread this and pan-fry it here, (as opposed to using frozen), it seems like they have completely forgotten to add any seasoning. I was disappointed.Two of my friends got the fettuccini alfredo, and another had the pasta bar/build your own. Their portions were more reasonably sized for single orders, and they all seemed to agree with me that the taste was just lacking. Also, the friend that ordered the pasta bar was pretty unhappy with the price of his order vs the content: $12 for over-sauced pasta and 2 meatballs. Also, contrary to some of the older reviews on here, the meatballs weren't over-sized, and left my friend wondering what all the hype was about.Bottom line: This is a cute local place, and I know they've got their loyal fans. But I'll be honest, on a day I splurged to treat myself to Italian, I must say it wasn't worth the calories.

The mushroom ravioli with beef cheek ragu is a great choice and comes in a surprisingly generous portion. Tender chunks of stewed beef, savory mushroom gravy, and a tasty filling with cheese and a hint of truffle. My mom raved about this for a solid week after I brought her an order. I'd love to rave more about this spot, but there are a few things holding me back: pricing inconsistencies (menu lists lunch as $12.50, rang up at $15, no explanation?), a vague feeling that the building itself needs maintenance (rickety wood walkway, no landscaping), and the fact that most of the \u00a0menu is duplicated between here and Tre Enoteca (which is the better location IMO).TIP: The patio is nice for dining alfresco as the weather cools off, but wait til construction at the Witte dies down, right now there's no view and tons of noise."], ["Auston M.", "Very under impressed.

Israli Couscous which had kale and marcona almonds which were toasted and flavorful. Roasted Golden Beets and their canellini white beans with Gremolata. Gremolata is a chopped herb condiment, this seemed to be made with the classical preparation of lemon zest, garlic and parsley. I found this an opportunity to try things that I would not have normally ordered off their main menu.My husband and I both ordered the slow roasted Caprese with House Pulled Mozzarella. This dish was very good, I only wish that we had been given the opportunity to have some cracked pepper atop this dish. Our server did not offer it nor was there any cracked pepper on the table so that we could have garnished our dish ourselves. For our entrees we both ordered the Crispy Skin Rainbow Trout with Summer Squash Caponata. The fish was amazing, the squash was served as a cold side dish; I would have preferred my squash hot to accompany the temperature of the fish. For dessert we got the Nutella x 3, this was very good and fulfilled our sweet tooth craving. We also got the Orange Ricotta Cake Trifle with Macerated Berries and Rosewater Crema. I think that fancy names were added to this dessert to make it taste better; it was just okay.Our daughter ordered the tomato Soppresetta Pizza, she loved it!We were served by Chris who seemed to be knowledgeable about the entree's we asked about on the menu. We had his attention, until a party of about 20 people came in and took up the majority of his time. Slow on remembering our daughter's tea & giving us too much time between courses.

On our second visit we came for Sunday brunch, which to my surprise begins at 9am!. The menu is different for brunch which is a good or bad thing depending upon what you're looking for. I was disappointed that there was no risotto to be found, but also pleasantly surprised to find veal Benedict, a pizza with brie/fruit/arugula, chicken and waffles, and Nutella French toast. The pizza was delicious, as was the market salad, and the service was excellent yet again. The only thing less than spectacular about the entire experience was the veal Benedict....way too salty for my taste. Overall a very enjoyable meal, and we will definitely be returning for both dinner and brunch in the future."], ["P Luly W.", "After reading Julie G.'s rave review and hearing very positive things from other Yelpers who have similar taste buds to mine, I knew I had to check out Tre. \u00a0I'm always on the lookout for fresh pasta. \u00a0My husband and I went for lunch and basically mimicked Julie's order. \u00a0We got the Caesar salad, crispy skin grilled rainbow trout, Tagliatelli Bolognese and Nutella x 3. \u00a0Read Julie's review for a more comprehensive description of each dish. \u00a0She did such an excellent job! \u00a0There's nothing more I can add. \u00a0I do have to say that we enjoyed everything except the Nutella x3. \u00a0The dessert was too sweet for us. \u00a0Everything else though was excellent! \u00a0Can't wait to go back for more."], ["Jon O.", "Tasty and the lunch menu was inexpensive. It was very enjoyable food, great service and gold price point. Definitely a must try!"], ["Glenn V.", "First time there and we were very disappointed. As soon as our party arrived we ordered drinks and a kids pizza. Took 20 minutes to get the kids drink and over 45 minutes to get his pizza. We ordered salads and our entrees and before we could finish our salads our entrees showed up. They were luke warm when they arrived and cold within the next few minutes. The pasta dishes tasted ok. Would have been better if they were hot. We actually finished eating our entrees when the kids pizza finally arrived. The worst greasy pizza I have ever eaten. Even the 5 year old didn't care for it. The service was not that great either. We have been to the Tuscan region of Italy and these guys are not even close.This is the third Jason Dady restaurant that we have visited and we will not be going back to any of them!!"], ["Julie G.", "Tre Trattoria was hands down my favorite lunch during Restaurant Week! The sis and I left with happy bellies and an unbuttoned jean (won't disclose who), the food was incredible. Tre is beautifully decorated and accompanied by the perfect atmosphere for a date, party, or meeting. The staff is impeccable, Andy made our dining experience a grand one! Lunch:The food takes you to another place, we started with their perfectly portioned slow roasted caprese and of course we polished everything off despite the mozzarella being slightly on the boring side. I would definitely order the caprese again. Our lunch entrees were fit for a king, tons of food! I went with the house made Tagliatelli Bolognese and my sister ordered the crispy skin rainbow trout with brown butter farro and salsa verde, both divine. The pasta was perfectly textured and the bolognese sauce was light and flavorful. Now, that trout is what I'll be heading back for on my next visit! The trout had a wonderful bite to it and was cooked to perfection, the seasoning had me over the moon. At first my sister was jealous when she saw my old school pasta dish but once she tasted her trout, she moved the plate closer to her and went to town. Sweets:I was on the fence over the desserts, simply because I prefer salt over sugar but it's always nice to sample. I went with their lemon buttermilk poundcake and my sis got the Nutella, I didn't care for either. My sister enjoyed her nutella offering but \u00a0had to push my lemon cake away after two bites because it was harder than a rock.Overall, Tre Trattoria really impressed me with their outstanding entrees and how special my sister and I were treated by staff. HOOKED! Yelpers, do yourself a favor and check out Tre Trattoria before the Restaurant Week extension ends!"], ["Austin C.", "Tre was amazing. I can't believe it's taken me this long to finally eat here. It's a little hidden in the back of the shopping center where it lives but once you find it you won't be disappointed.We ate out on their patio because the weather was unusually pleasant for May. Our waitress was fast and helpful, she even threw in a free dessert - Nutella Three Ways - because it was our first time there.They have a solid wine list and all the food we ordered was delicious. I especially recommend the mushroom ravioli with beef cheek. We will be back to Tre for sure."], ["Jeremy G.", "Thank goodness for Restaurant Week! The whole meal was delicious. I started with chilled corn bisque. It was light and very refreshing. Next I had the pan roasted salmon and it was cooked to perfection. The fennel was a nice touch. Finally how can you not order the nutella x3 dessert...it was very decadent and rich. I could've eaten another serving. I will definitely come back for more!"], ["Sandra S.", "I love Restaurant Week because it's a great opportunity to try places you've been meaning to try but for whatever reason you just haven't yet.Tre Trattoria has been on my list for a while, so Mom and I decided to try it for lunch.What a great experience! I found their staff hospitable and friendly from the get go. Especially our waiter, he was so awesome.We started with the Caesar salad for me and the caprese salad for mom. That hand pulled mozzarella MADE this salad! Yum!For our entrees, Mom had the pasta Bolognese and I had the trout with white beans and salsa verde. Both were delicious.BUT DESSERT!!! mom had the Nutella 3x and I had the Lemon Curd cake with berries.They were both INCREDIBLE. If you are a chocolate fan (and if you're not-what's the matter with you??)the flourless chocolate cake with chocolate ganache, was ah-mazing!!My Lemon curd cake with berries was so light tangy and the berries were the perfect complement!The restaurant ambiance itself is so cozy. They have a great outdoor patio that I would love to come visit for brunch or lunch on a nice sunny afternoon or lovely evening.I can't wait to come back!Parking is a little tricky, the Witte is up to something next door and has taken over Tre's parking lot-BOO!! So you need to park in the Boardwalk parking lot and do a small obstacle course to find Tre, but I bet you will be glad you did!!"], ["Angela F. W.", "I went to Tre downtown once and was quite happy with the brunch there so I figured I'd try out their broadway location. Came with a friend of mine for Sunday brunch this past weekend. We got here at 1:30pm and there weren't many ppl. They have both indoor and outdoor seatings. The patio looked very nice but we opted to sit inside b/c the TX weather would still stir dry ya at the end of August. The inside is very nice and spacious. What really surprised me was that their menu is very different from the downtown location AND they DO NOT have $1 mimosa!!! Sad face! I almost wanted to get up and leave b/c $1 mimosa was the reason I wanted to do brunch here and I could deff use a few mimosas at the moment. Agh! Luckily it was the restaurant week so we were also given a restaurant week lunch menu. Three course for $15! That's a great deal! Both my friend and I decided to do the restaurant week lunch instead and we also got a carafe of mimosa for $12. I'd settle for that. I ordered the caprese salad for starter, rainbow trout for entree and Nutella for dessert. My friend got caprese, a pasta and poundcake. The size of our three courses were very generous. Usually an entree would cost more than $15 so I was super happy about the deal. The caprese salad was very good. I thought the mozzarella was average but the sun dried tomato was divine! When I got the trout I was deff beyond joyful. The portion was very big and the trout was super fresh. It pairs so well with the sour vegetable it comes with. The farro side was ok. My chocolate dessert was also awesome but then again I always love chocolate. My friend's pasta and cake were good too but I think mine were better choices. Overall, I really liked brunch here. I wish they had the green eggs and ham and the duck confit from the downtown menu. And of course $1 mimosas would make this place my go-to brunch spot. Now that they are closing the downtown location, perhaps they could combine the two menus and come up with something even better! I really have high hopes for you, Tre Trattoria. Please don't disappoint me!!!"], ["Phi T.", "Went here during restaurant week. Had a great experience there. They offered very unique dishes, I've never had before."], ["Monica M.", "What a hidden gem! This was a great Yelp find! Was looking for a nice place for a birthday dinner and some how came across this place. The food was amazing and the service was beyond fantastic! \u00a0I love how chic the atmosphere is and did I tell you how great the food was? I had the bolognese and it was melt in your mouth good. The folks got the rainbow trout family style and it was perfectly cooked and flavored. Probably the best rainbow trout I have ever had! Absolutely fell in love with this place. Great food and at an affordable price. Definitely will be going back."], ["Brande M.", "Oh those blasted fruit flies! \u00a0But what can you do when you serve nature's perfect juice in mass quantity? \u00a0They loooove the vino (smartest bug ever).We started with the Caprese over house pulled mozzarella and topped with basil. \u00a0There were three of us, and three of them - it was better than the Dating Game! \u00a0We all hmmed and awwed, and drooled til it was gulped and gone. \u00a0I had the Toscana by the glass (a cab/merlot blend), and my friends had the Sangiovese/Merlot blend, and the Tre Martini - all of us x2.We moved onto our lunch entree's (perfectly proportioned), and shared them family style. \u00a0My dish was the Pappardelle with roasted fennel, Napa cabbage, grapefruit, and ricotta salata. \u00a0So...apparently Pappardelle is Italian for \"BIG ASS NOODLE.\" \u00a0Who knew? \u00a0It was very delish, and the citrus was just the right amount (I admit to being slightly scared of the grapefruit). \u00a0My companions had: \u00a0the special, which was fried chicken nestled in a Parmigiano polenta and the Tagliatelle bolognese. \u00a0Tagliatelle is Italian for \"slightly less BIG ASS NOODLE than Pappardelle.\" \u00a0I would like to pause here for a moment of silence for the Parmigiano polenta. \u00a0LE SIGH! \u00a0I don't like \"grits,\" because, well, they're gritty! \u00a0There was nothing gritty or non palatable about this starchy goodness. \u00a0The parm could have overwhelmed, it didn't, the consistency could have been mushy, it wasn't. \u00a0It was my favorite of everything we had....as an entree. \u00a0I say that, because we had dessert. \u00a0OH! boy, did we have dessert!We split the Nutella x3. \u00a0Because Nutella x1 was never good? \u00a0Lord have mercy! \u00a0It is a flour-less, chocolatehazelnut cake, with a chocolatehazelnut sauce, complimented by a chocolatehazelnut mousse. \u00a0Mousse is almost too heavy a word for that - I thought it would literally float, like a chocolately angel, right off our plate! \u00a0It is a MUST if you go!All in all, I would not only endure, but invite fruit flies to this lovely place! \u00a0The service was excellent, and the ambiance even more pleasant. \u00a0I will be a repeat here. \u00a0Viva Tre Trattoria!TIP: \u00a0Bring your own wine glass because they serve it in a high ball - NOT recommended for such tart wines."], ["Dave S.", "Good restaurant. My wife and I went Easter morning while we were in the midst of a road trip. We were dressed in workout clothes and were definitely out of place. Not sure if it was because it was Easter but everyone was VERY dressed up. 90% of the men were in suits with ties/bow ties, and all of the women were wearing dresses. The hostess looked like she hated her job and the manager was very snooty and poured our water without saying a word. He looked like the dean off of the movie Old School. However, our waiter was very nice and was somewhat attentive. My wife ordered a steak and it didn't come with a steak knife. We asked the waiter for a steak knife and he brought what looked between a steak and butter knife. But it was better than the butter knife she had been using. The waiter also wasn't intimately familiar with the menu, as he didn't know the two cheeses that were served with the cheese dish. The place is very clean and pretty. The food is quite tasty. I had the salmon and it was delicious, although it was a small serving. Gratuity is automatically calculated into the bill at 20%. \u00a0I don't like this concept because I believe it doesn't incentivize the waitstaff. I would recommend this restaurant but probably won't be returning."], ["Jill S.", "Love, love TRE!Everything is so fresh & authentic. The gnocchi is addicting! You will not be disappointed."], ["Melissa D.", "Soooo ~ this year when we went for our lunch meeting, they didn't have us listed to be in for lunch. Panic time. This would be a problem at many other places in town. We require a large table (for between 23-25 people), in a space that we can hear (and therefore doesn't disturb the rest of the patrons), separate checks, and the regular menu. They were completely accommodating and had our space/table ready in about 10 minutes! Now, that is service. Additionally, the actual table service was outstanding and timely as well. You just can't always know when the group is that large. The food is always outstanding. \u00a0I had the gnocchi with a San Marzano tomatoe sauce... for some reason I just had to have it. The flavor \u00a0profile was intense and exactly as I wanted. There just wasn't enough of it. But, that could just be me. When we finished our meeting and were leaving, a few of us decided to stay and chat a while longer. It was a beautiful spring day so we took it to the patio. There is a lovely outdoor space for dining (or chatting and wining) that we took full advantage of! I'm quite sure they were not intending to serve people outside (it was, after all 1 in the afternoon) but the bartender took great care of us."], ["LaDonna T.", "OOOOMMGEEEE!!

The restaurant itself is dead secksy...great atmosphere, very modern & cozy, plenty of seating. The staff was lovely despite being shorthanded due to the Paella festival in the Pearl that day. And I especially appreciated Erin sending me the brunch menu via email when I made our reservations on Friday.Overall, the food was solid & good: I had tastes of the Caesar with parmigiano frico (meh), roasted golden beets (yum!), cannelini white beans with gremolota (beans still a bit too crunchy), pizza (taste of meat grease took over...disappointed), waygu meatball w/ polenta (good), braised beef cheek chilaquiles (ah yeah!), & I had the veal milanese \"benedict\" with a fried egg & saffron hollandaise (pretty tasty...but my toast was burned, which dominated the flavors). The bread and oil before the meal was very tasty, as well. I loved the bellini carafe...you can choose peach or orange and they pour a bottle of Prosecco up in there. Not a bad brunch, but not the best either. Tre Broadway is def a good place to go for a last minute, reservation free Sunday brunch...they have plenty of space to accommodate you; I can't imagine it filling all the way up."], ["Valeria G.", "AMAZING food!!!

I hope in the near future something will change.

Pretty solid/above average place for Italian in San Antonio, but not amazing. Probably second after Piatti's and Il Sogno for me so far. I did a birthday dinner here with friends and they were able to accommodate 20 people without hesitation on a Thursday. The service was relatively attentive and food came out in a reasonable time. We got complimentary bread and dip which was pretty good, but not as good as Piatti's.I ordered the Parpadalle bolongnese and was satisfied with the way the pasta was cooked and the sauce. I definitely appreciate that the pasta was freshly made. The meat that went with the dish was a little underwhelming, but still decent. It basically tasted like under seasoned ground beef. I tried my friend's duck confit pasta and thought it was pretty decent even though I'm not a big fan of creamy pastas unless they have another infused flavor into the sauce like lemon etc. The sauce was basically fetucinne sauce, so not super unique or special. The pastas weren't the best part of my meal, but were a bit above average. The best part of the pasta was that it was freshly made in house and cooked properly.The ricotta bruschetta was really delicious. I loved the tanginess/sourness of the sauce and freshness of the ricotta. The tomatoes went well with the dish and were kind of sweet which complimented the dish well. I basically inhaled this dish. I also tried the fresh pulled mozzarella from a friend and this was underwhelming. It was chewy and the bread was just so so. The cheese at Dough Napoletana is WAY better, so I'd skip this dish here.For dessert, I had the nutella X 3. I was hesitant that it would be too rich for me, but found the dessert lighter than some chocolate dishes and really enjoyed the dessert. The cake was fluffy and light and the mousse wasn't too rich. I tried the pizza that some of my friend's ordered and they were pretty subpar, so I wouldn't recommend the pizza here. The pizza I tasted was pretty bland and didn't have the best texture. Overall, this is a pretty solid place for Italian and is worth a try. Prices are moderate and the ambiance is nice especially if you sit on the patio."], ["Ruben B.", "This is the best Italian food I had in San Antonio. The restaurant is hidden gem. Nice decor, very friendly staff and the food is amazing. I had the risotto and it was perfect. The bruschettas are fantastic and for dessert I order the 3 way nutela and is off the hook.

We were treated well by the general manager, and the change of reservation was accommodating. When we arrived, there was a prompt greeting, and we were seated right away. The service was pretty good, as our server gave keen attention to timing. We were there relatively early, so we were one of the few tables seated. Though there was an annoyingly loud table when we arrived, we were lucky enough to walk in toward the end of their meal. The prix fixe menu was initially a concern because I have a few allergies, but there was enough variety to accommodate this. The Ciopinno was truly the stand-out for me, and despite being incredibly full I did what I never do here--I ate dessert. Nutella 3 ways is ridiculously good, and I would return for these two things alone. The rainbow trout three ways was incredibly savory, well cooked, and well seasoned, but not in direct alignment with my tastes. The portions were generous given the four-course meal.All in all, outstanding food and good service. I would post pictures, but we decimated that food.

The house bread was delicious, especially the olive oil and spices they brought out with it. The mozzarella was a little difficult to cut, but the flavor was on par. The salad special had fresh tomatoes, burrata, pumpernickel \u00a0croutons, spinach and some kind of a vinaigrette. I was a little disappointed because I would not have described this as a salad, but as a caprese. There were too many tomatoes and not enough spinach to call this a salad. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the flavors. For the entrees, I ordered the fettuccine with duck confit and my husband had the sopressatta pizza. My dish was delicious. You could tell that the noodles were homemade and that it was prepared by an experienced chef. I did find a bone in my dish, which I was not expecting. But other than that, it was delicious.

Started with the hand pulled mozzarella, it was delicious, truly enjoyed it. Moving on to entrees I asked the server about the root vegetable risotto, but his description didn't sound very appealing so I asked for the goat cheese pistachio pizza with a side of Brussels sprouts and my companion ordered the ravioli. After about 15-20 minutes the server came back with my pizza, a plate of burned Brussels sprouts, and a root vegetable risotto -_- sigh. Instead of placing the order for my friends ravioli he rang in risotto, because I guess me asking a question about it was more than his memory could handle on the walk from the table to the kitchen.

It's amazing!! In the last year I have made 3 visits ... dinner with friends, lunch during restaurant week and recently New Year's Eve dinner party with our friends. All three visits were great, no complaints. Not 100% perfect but really what restaurant is? Whatever little issue occurred the amazing food eased that bad taste. Takeaways: For you first timers get a bunch of plates and share. Don't hesitate to visit during restaurant week. In general I have not had luck when going to place during restaurant week because the service suffers and menu items run out fast. But with Tre and this location in particular no issues. As for giving them your business on a special night like NYE ... do it! NYE Dinner: It was $69.95 per person for 5 courses ... $13.99 per course is a great deal. Some couples weren't down for the price and it made me have buyers remorse before showing up but the minute they brought out an \"surprise app\" I was happy and knew we made the right decision. I was worried about this night because my last fine dining experience on NYE was 2 years ago and it scared me away ... mainly the timing of the courses. Who wants to spend their evening at dinner??!! No issues with timing with Tre. Only thing is we ordered the wine pairing with the meal and we didn't get our last wine when dessert was brought out so we had to ask another waiter for it. The menu was perfectly designed and left us overly satisfied. We were a total of 6 ppl, 3 couples so I was able to see almost everything on the menu. There were a few items that weren't as good as others but that is the risk in dinners like this ... you make sure not to get what your other half gets so that you can have both. Then what happens ... you pick a favorite. If there wasn't \u00a0the other I am pretty sure everything would have been perfect. \u00a0Just in case the chef is reading here is what was just ok: caprese and the cauliflower ravioli. Nothing could beat out the Turkey with giblet sausage and the sauce on the ravioli lacked in flavor compared to the gnocchi.Overall our evening with Tre was unforgettable and the icing on the cake was that while I write this review I am munching on our take home gift from them ... delicious and the right amount of sweet granola."], ["Claire Siobhan M.", "I came here with large group for a friend's birthday celebration. \u00a0Every item was so good that people were passing samples of their dish around the table to share the goodness of what they ordered. \u00a0It was a truly great culinary experience. \u00a0Every sample of someone else's dish was a reminder that I must return so that I may eventually delight in the consumption of every menu item over time."], ["Bryana C.", "I love this place! everything on their menu is awesome! a few things you should know though... some sundays for sunday brunch they have a fixed menu and if there is something you had in mind that you love and they normally make you cant have it bc the chef will refuse to make it... get the pulled mozzarella cheese appetizer, it is killer good on the weekends they have live music and most friday night we stop here for espresso martinis.... sooooo good! the service is normally very good minus the chef they have lol he is very unpleasant"], ["Kirish D.", "Food is good although adjusting to the new menu.

My brother and his wife used to come here often while they were in medical school in San Antonio. They recently moved away, but came back for a visit so my girlfriend and I met them here for lunch upon their arrival.We ordered a variety of items including the radicchio, a caprese dish, one of the flat bread pizzas, and the duck confit pasta dish. What sticks out to me about this place is the extra dimension of sophistication they add to their food. Instead of just mastering palatability and texture, the chef makes you very aware of the method of cooking used to make your dish. This is most apparent with the radicchio which is charred in a delicious way. Everything we ordered was great. I would recommend ordering with your gut here because I don't think you can miss.Service was also very professional and speedy. There was a large graduation party happening when we were there, but we could barely tell a difference with the service. We will definitely back."], ["Dani J.", "This was mine and my husband's first time dining at Tre Trattoria. As we walked up the wooden stairs, rounding corners and following the signs, we felt as though we were on an adventure! The restaurant was adorable. The patio is lined with string lights and the bar is a homey sunroom. The dining room had a more formal feeling which really allowed guests to choose the right setting for their personal occasion. We sat at a high top in the bar and our server, John, was great! Everything we tried was wonderful. I highly recommend the \"Refresher\" cocktail- perfect balance of ginger, mint, lemon, & vodka. My husband and I could not stop commenting on how extraordinarily fresh the food was. Some of the items we tried included the cous cous, roasted eggplant, cannelloni beans, prochuitto, Cesar salad, and the lamb. Although we were too full for dessert, there was a \"Nutella x 3\" which caught my eye. Looking forward to trying it next time!"], ["erin m.", "Really??? This place is horrible. We have been here several times & rated it as mediocre San Antonio fare but really it's worse than that. And if I could give negative stars, I would. The food is microwaved, over pressure cooked at best & they tried to double charge us on wine. Sad"], ["Daniel A.", "Do not ever order delivery from this place. Ordered for two on a Thursday at 12:20. Over 3 hours later, a knock on my door, and was handed a bag of lukewarm pasta. Things that were missing: an apology for the ridiculously long delay and the two drinks I ordered. The food was mediocre at best (this may have something to do with it being barely warm). The point being, if you can't figure out a way to deliver your food hot and in under 2 hours, perhaps you shouldn't offer delivery."], ["Courtney J.", "Great time on New Year's Eve! Everything was delicious. I do have 2 complaints though. Everything was too salty (and boy do I love my salt). Also, we had our son with us and when we arrived we were given a defective highchair which he fell through. I actually had to get up, take the high chair back to the front, and ask for a new chair even though the server saw everything happen and commented that the highchair needed to be thrown away. For a dinner that was over $200 for 2 people I expect better customer service even if it is for a young couple with a baby."], ["Nathan C.", "My wife and I went to dinner at Tre Trattoria last night. \u00a0We each got an appetizer; I had the caprese with fire roasted tomatoes and she had the bruschetta and both were absolutely amazing!

Pulled mozzarella appetizer was tasty, but bread was burned. The couscous was fairly bland. Had an Italian mojito which was rum, basil, and orange-infused simple syrup; good for a hot day, but not much kick or flavor. All four dinners were over salted. \u00a0risotto with crab was a nice consistency, but couldn't taste the crab. Tagliatelle with chicken had great flavor. Gnocchi was nice, but not great. Met friends who we had not seen for months, so had lots of catching up to do. They forgot our side of roasted eggplant, which was excellent. Service was mostly polished, but lost some points when they brought all the receipts to a table near us to divide up tips....there were still other diners in restaurant. The decor is nice And sound level is good for conversations (perhaps because not very crowded). We had to look closely to see the entrance from Broadway...its next to where the Boardwalk Bistro used to be, then walk to the rear of the complex. The outdoor dining area would be pleasant, but overlooks the Witte Museum construction site. Overall, it came close several times, but needs work to be a serious contender when so many other nearby excellent Italian restaurants."], ["Sandra M.", "This is one of my favorite restaurants in San Antonio. Most of the items are exceptional and a bunch are really good. I have to preface this by saying that I preferred the downtown location better due to the waitstaff and service (although parking was a hassle) but since they closed I'm forced to go to the Broadway location which still has great food but not the same amazing ambiance and waitstaff of the other location.Their pulled sea salt mozzarella is out of this world delicious - soft, flavorful, and a great portion size. Their fresh, home made bread and olive oil for dipping pair well with the cheese. I'm a huge fan of their antipasti-verdure \u00a0menu, often I'll just have 4 of their vegetable selections as a meal (along with the mozzarella and a dessert). For people who don't want a carb heavy or want a healthy meal this is the way to go. I especially recommend this for vegetarians. The roasted golden beets, tuscan farro salad, portabellas (seasonal), and homemade ricotta bruschetta are so incredibly delicious and satisfying.Regarding entrees, the pan seared gnocchi with creamy gorgonzola is amazing. The gnocchi are like fluffly little pillows of goodness, they don't feel too heavy, and the gorgonzola is strong and flavorful. You need to really love cheese, especially strong cheeses like gorgonzola to enjoy this dish. The Wagyu meatballs with spaghetti are pretty yummy. This isn't the most amazing spaghetti you'll have but it's worth the try if you like this basic dish. The meatballs have melted cheese in them which is a delightful treat when you open them up. I recently tried the organic parmigiano fried chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this dish was. It's a modern take on a classic dish - pieces of fried chicken that were super tender and moist with a drizzle of the classic red sauce. It was beyond delicious!I've also had the Tagliatelle Bolognese, all three cast iron pizzas, and grilled rainbow trout which were all ok but nothing to rave about. Although, I asked for an off menu item - salami pizza with an over easy egg and it was pretty amazing. My hands down favorite dessert of all time is at this restaurant - the Nutella X 3. I'm not a huge sweets or dessert person but this dish is beyond amazing. This is the only dessert I crave and I will actually go to the restaurant just to eat this dish. It doesn't hurt that it's priced very reasonably at $7. There's a decadent nutella chocolate molten cake on one side and a light, airy nutella mousse on the other. Try this, you won't be disappointed."], ["Stacey T.", "This is a nice trendy place. \u00a0I was by myself on business and sat on the bar side. \u00a0The main draw for coming here was the reviews about the bread and oil. \u00a0This was never presented to me, but was to those around. \u00a0Perhaps it was because I was a party of one. \u00a0My pasta dish was good, a bit small on the portion size. \u00a0I ended up ordering an appetizer to go as I was still hungry. \u00a0A bit overrated from what I had expected after seeing other reviews. \u00a0Service was just mediocre, no personality."], ["Daryll B.", "Our party wanted to try different options and share. The linguine and clams were briny, buttery, and seasoned oh so good. One person had a steak panini with arugula, white cheese, and tomatoes. They commented, \"one of the best sandwiches they have had\" They had an extensive wine list, but we opted for some Italian sodas. I like their lunch prices, which include a soup or salad and the entr\u00e9e for about $12.50. One person got a goat cheese topped pizza with balsamic-glazed cippolini onions. There are so many other things I want to try in the future.."], ["Cassandra S.", "My husband and I finally tried out this restaurant for dinner one night.....we really liked it!!A \"glass\" of wine is served in your own individual carafe, which was a nice surprise for the generous amount. \u00a0The food tasted great; they also had wonderful mozzarella as an appetizer, and my husband and I were able to share the Duck Confit plate, which had an amazing flavor!The atmosphere is very nice, without feeling stuffy. \u00a0There's a nice bar area sectioned off from the dining room with a wide screen t.v. if you want to grab a drink and watch the game, and the restaurant is family friendly also- it serves family style platters on it's menu as well.We will be back!"], ["Amy L.", "Came for the first time from out of town and overall would not return based on today's experience.

The bartender who was our server was gracious and the level of service was outstanding. And the food...amazing! Brunch can sometimes be too breakfasty for my tastes...the menu was the perfect balance of breakfast and lunch.

My sister and I split the Friday special for our entree, the Wagu Meatballs with Spaghetti and San Marzano Fresca, and OMG! best meatballs I've ever had. Spaghetti was hand made and unlike any I've ever had before. Needless to say the food was to die for and I had plenty of leftovers to take home for the next day.The atmosphere was calm, relaxing and romantic if you're on a date but overall had a great vibe.

I loved the special of the day, which was the Halibut; the rice under the fish was perfectly cooked, the fish was nicely baked, and the sauce had an amazing finish; it was subtle - not overwhelming enough to cover the taste of the fish, but just faint enough to mask the scent. The dish came with a side of squash soup, which was delicious as well; with all of the dishes, people have the choice between soup or salad.

On my recent trip to San Antonio, we went for a celebratory dinner after my bro-in-law finished his bar exam. This is a great place for celebrating: decadent food, extensive wine list. and indulgent desserts added up to a great time for us!We ordered a variety of pasta dishes. Bro-in-law had the Pennette con Polpette e Salsiccia, which was small penne with a rich tomato sauce, meatballs and spicy sausage. The sausage wasn't too spicy and he really enjoyed it. Sis had the Ravioli di Aragosta (lobster ravioli) which was probably our least favorite of the dishes. The lobster inside the ravioli was too bland; the pasta improved significantly after a few shakes from the pepper mill. My sis said she wouldn't order this again, and after tasting it, I agreed. It wasn't as decadent or flavorful as it should have been; what a disservice to lobster! I had the Penne a la Vodka and that was absolutely delicious! Large penne pasta in a rich sauce that was the right blend of cheesy and tomato-y! It's a must try! We finished with creme brulee (sweet with the right texture of sugary crust), the chocolate gelato (super rich chocolate taste --divine!) and the tiramisu (free with Yelp check-in!). I normally don't care for tiramisu but I was so glad I had it here -- Luce's version is incredible! Creamy, rich, moist and the right balance of espresso and chocolate. The service is really the only thing that keeps this place from being a five-star kind of place, because the food was wonderful. After our main course came, the service got a bit slow, and my sister told me that in May she had a private party here after my bro-in-law graduated from law school and that the service had disappointed her. The waiter did not communicate clearly with members of the dinner party (leading to an inflated bill -- not cool!) and was generally inattentive and unprofessional. Sure enough, as we sat there in the dining room, we saw him serving the table next to us. We were relieved that he was not our waiter. I concur with other reviewers here who say that the service could be improved.Overall, I enjoyed our dinner at Luce, and would return."], ["T B.", "Great good; intelligent and polite wait staff-- and awesome lunch specials! \u00a0I would highly recommend this place to anyone-- including my boss!"], ["Estela D.", "Great little restaurant with an awesome happy hour, we love to come here and sit at the bar area and order a pizza (their pizzas are delicious) and also their meatballs (delicious as well), they have a great variety of appetizers and cocktails.

We started with callimari for an appetizer. It was ok. Not over cooked so you could actually taste more than grease. I had the meatball and sausage pasta. I thought both meats were very good. I am excited to five into my leftovers for that reason! \u00a0The marinaria sauce was spicy but a bit watered down. I like a thicker sauce I guess. Good flavor. My wife had the seafood pasta. She enjoyed it except she is not a huge fan of spicy food. She didn't realize it was going to be so spicy. The bread came with 3 different butters. All were unique and yummy. I'm sure there were items on the menu that were a much better value than what we got. 2 glasses of wine, appetizer, salad, and 2 entries were over $100 after tip.

One was just a regular margarita while the other was a white pizza.One of my friends for the lobster ravioli while another got salmon with pasta.

I also ordered a chocolate martini, it was way too strong. \u00a0When I thought I was having a mediocre dinner the dessert came into the picture to save my night. They have a checkin offer of a free tiramisu. I hate things that are too sweet. But this dessert is so amazing. It was mild but super duper delicious! And there was a lot of it! Deff the highlight of my meal. Our server was an older woman who doesn't know what wifi is when I asked her for the passcode of their wifi. So yea, they do have free wifi which is a plus. Overall I was satisfied. The price was very reasonable. I wouldn't mind coming back again to try more things on the menu especially b/c it is in my hood. And of course I'd get that free yummy tiramisu dessert again!"], ["Sandy C.", "We happened upon this place for lunch. It was a nice relaxing place. It was very hard to decide what to order as it all looked good. I was about to order a pizza with artichokes and other stuff when I saw the salad offerings. So I ended up with this Salmon spinach salad. Very yummy!!! \u00a0Staff was very nice and kept water glasses full."], ["Chris A.", "My wife and I had a great meal at Luce Ristorante e Enoteca. We ended up here after buying a Groupon and we'll be back, Groupon or no Groupon. We arrived kind of early for dinner on this past 4th of July. We were pleased they were open. With nearly the entire place empty, we chose to dine alfresco. The outdoor seating area is quite nice and the heat wasn't too bad. They had several fans blowing around the dining area but not enough to provide a wind tunnel affect. The waiter took our drink order and returned shortly. He then stated that he'd be back in a few minutes with some hot, fresh bread. He delivered the bread about 5 minutes later along with 3 varieties of butter: regular, a green herb butter, and a red butter that may have been made with sun dried tomatoes. The warm bread with the butter was delicious. I ordered the Pappardelle con Polpette e Salsiccia / House crafted Meatballs, Spicy Italian Sausage, Pappardelle Pasta Marinara ($19). The meatball was of nice size, sitting atop the center \u00a0of the pasta, and the spicy sausage was excellent. I found the penne to be a tad too aldente and not really a good instrument for carrying the sauce. Overall, I thought it was pretty good but for $19, a little steep. My wife ordered the Linguine Mare Chiaro / Scallops, Shrimp, Lobster, Mussels, Calamari, Clams, Spicy Tomato White Wine Broth ($24). She asked to substitute the spicy tomato white wine sauce (because nothing about that sounded delicious to either of us) with a cream sauce. Now we're talking. She LOVED it. The amount of seafood in this dish was great. Of course we weren't expecting a ton of lobster but what lobster was in it, was excellent. This is definitely a keeper. Even the price seemed great to us considering the amount of seafood and the fact that she had a very nice lunch the next day.The only small downer was a bit of unattentiveness by our waiter at times. I know he was new, he stated that up front, and he did a wonderful job most of the time. However, toward the end of the meal we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for him to return so that we could request our check. This, however, will not deter us from dining at Luce Ristorante e Enoteca again."], ["Scott B.", "This review is for the Happy Hour menu. \u00a0We ordered the strawberry basil mojito which was sweet and delicious. \u00a0The muddled strawberries were a nice touch. \u00a0The funghi pizza was a meal in it of itself. \u00a0It was one of the better thin crust pizzas we had in San Antonio. \u00a0The gamberi al limone shrimp was perfectly saut\u00e9ed and garlicky. \u00a0The polpette alla napoletana was good sized meatballs full of flavor. \u00a0The vongole in brodetto was a little too salty but delicious. \u00a0The polenta con carciofi was the best one - full of flavor and crispy on the outside. \u00a0The carpaccio cipriani was tasty. \u00a0The free tiramisu with Yelp check-in was a nice finish to our meal. \u00a0Total bill was $40 without tip and we both couldn't finish half of the pizza and the entire dessert."], ["Matthew B.", "OK, to be honest, I had bigger expectations for a restaurant with such a fancy name. \u00a0Alison and I stopped here on a whim when looking for someplace new to eat. We ordered the grilled eggplant appeztizer which tasted like they took it out of a box and microwaved it. \u00a0Very bland and very soggy. \u00a0Our entres were so lackluster that I can't even remember what we ordered. \u00a0I do remember that it was on par with Olive Garden, which is definitely not what I wanted for the price. \u00a0The wine list was good and our wine was the best thing we had this evening. So, If you have a choice, go to Olive Garden. And if you have money, go to Aldo's"], ["Sam M.", "Very nice atmosphere although the food was frankly quite terrible. We ordered the calamari which had extreme amounts of breading and you could only taste the flour and the oil and we had no choice but to send it back. \u00a0Even the waitress agreed with us in that it was very very greasy and breaded and they brought out a fresh batch and it was pretty much the same thing. We also ordered the sausage pinwheels which was extremely salty and we left half on the plate. \u00a0We had the tiramisu which was part of the Yelp offer and it was all sweet with no flavor. The only good thing about the experience was obviously the nice outdoor setting, the wine list and the coffee at the end of the dinner. I will not be going here again. \u00a0I do not recommend this restaurant except for the nice seating outside to enjoy a glass of wine or coffee."], ["Miriam S.", "My husband and I had an ok experience at Luce - although, honestly, he really enjoyed it. We started our meal with their bread which is served with butter and a couple of mascarpone cheese blends which were fun. We then ordered a shrimp appetizer that was quite good. For our main meals my husband got a lobster ravioli which he enjoyed the heck out of, but was a little too lobstery for me... I guess sometimes the claw meat just doesn't do it for me. But the tomato basil sauce it was serve with wasn't bad. I ordered the gnocchi with bolognese sauce. The bolognese sauce was really delicious! But the gnocchi way hit the mark - honestly I completely avoided it in my dish. I don't know if it wasn't salted, or if they just have a bizarre recipe. Or maybe they just over cooked it or something that ruined the consistency. Either way, I'm not opposed to coming back, but will have to continue my search for tummy gnocchi in San Antonio!"], ["Steve A.", "Since my original review, I've been back to Luce a handful of times and I've had decent, but not spectacular food. So I want to amend my original 5 star rating to a 3 1/2-4 star. For instance, last night I went to Luce craving gnocchi which I ordered. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty good food; however, not for the $50 I paid for the meal (including tip, beer, and an appetizer). \u00a0The gnocchi were cooked well; however, I thought the seasoning was a bit off. My entire entree needed more salt as it was rather bland. And although the marinara sauce was delicious, there were times when I ate raw garlic in the sauce. There's nothing more jolting than raw garlic in an otherwise tasty sauce. I love garlic but it does need to be sauteed a bit. The bruschetta appetizer was on point. For $12 you get a ton of food! It comes with flat bread and comes with different iterations of bruschetta. I personally liked the traditional style and this spicy version they served the best, but each of the six? selections was good. I thought service was a bit slow for a fairly empty restaurant. I waited several minutes after sitting for someone to acknowledge me at my table. Not overly long, but long enough that it became noticeable to me. Nevertheless, my server was attentive thereafter, so it came out in the wash I suppose. Look, Luce is still a fantastic Italian restaurant. It is hands down much better than the run-of-the-mill Italian chain restaurants ubiquitous in San Antonio. I think it may be a tad overpriced for the food you receive (the scarpiello notwithstanding), but given the area in which it is located, the inflated prices are understandable. This is still a great restaurant for a date night because the ambiance is very nice. Check it out if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."], ["Marilyn C.", "Croutons were stale. \u00a0Lasagna was cold in the middle and portion small for the price. \u00a0Spaghetti scampi good but $24 high compared to other SA restaurants. \u00a0Atmosphere is nice.

Everything from their quad bruschettas and cheese and honey plate to their grouper and the decadent Lava Torte dessert was executed beautifully. \u00a0The dinner was SO good that I made it a point to stop by and experience the Happy Hour that many have raved about. \u00a0Along with my $3 Peronis and my SO's $5 Martinis, we ordered a Margherita & Funghi Pizza, Carciofi Fritti and Arancini di Riso. \u00a0First up, the pizzas! \u00a0The Margherita was fantastic! \u00a0The crust was crispy and the balance of mozzarella to tomato sauce was on point. \u00a0The Carciofi Fritti (or Artichoke Fritters to those who find it impossible to master the Italian tongue) were hot and fresh and came with a highly addictive citrus aoili. \u00a0But my favorite thing? \u00a0LIke my most favoritest thing I've ever eaten? \u00a0The Arancini di Riso! \u00a0These fried rice balls were so unlike anything I'd eaten before. \u00a0Fried and crispy on the outside, soft and cheesy on the inside, oh! \u00a0I'd be lying if I said that they haven't infiltrated my dreams.."], ["Mike B.", "We should have left as soon as the hostess asked whether we had reservations (we didn't).

The food was fine, but it was way too expensive--and I never complain about prices. The bread was only okay, and the flavored butters were nasty.

Our server Alana was very prompt and available for us whenever we needed her.

The pasta carbona that I ordered isn't on their menu, but I think they should definitely add it! (They have a little blurb on the top of their menu that says they have all the ingredients of a traditional Italian kitchen and to just ask if you want something else, so I wanted to see what it was like). Also, the pasta carbonara was $23, but it can easily be shared by two people (by the looks of it, most entrees are large enough to share). My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our soups and main courses. For dessert we enjoyed their in-house made tiramisu (free with yelp check in). The tiramisu isn't overly sweet and has excellent coffee flavor. I'm very happy to report that our second trip was better in terms of service and food. I would recommend this restaurant for an intimate dinner or for happy hour."], ["Laura B.", "Last night was our first time here. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. Great service, atmosphere and exquisitely delicious food. I had a chicken dish with artichokes and risotto. \u00a0I had them put the cream sauce on the side, which was a good choice. Everything was very good. Most of the time when I eat Italian food I am disappointed, but this was really unusually delicious. The only thing that would make me happier is to make a significantly lighter version of this without so much fat (cream, butter, olive oil) or whatever made it like typical Italian heavy food. You can do that without compromising the taste. There was no cheese on this dish, which was good or it would have been over the top."], ["Dave H.", "Excellent service.

Beer, wine, and martini specials are also offered.Since I was with a big party, we each decided to order two or three dishes and tried almost everything from the menu. The stand outs include the calamari (not overly fried and served with two tasty dipping sauces), grilled pinwheel sausage (bursting with juices and flavor and served with peppers), sauteed baby clams (the white wine sauce was tasty but not overpowering), arancini (the crispy texture totally sold me on this one), and the ravioli (creamy ricotta cheese made me melt).Throughout the meal, the attentive waiter ensured our water glasses were always filled and dishes cleared promptly. The dining environment itself is classy in an understated sort of way, with lovely paintings of the owner's family and himself on the wall and an impressive wine collection on display.

The only thing I have found is that the lamb on almost all occasions has not been perfect...either too fatty or overcooked. \u00a0But seeing that everything else is good to great...I can overlook the lack of lambiness in their cooking.The hidden secret is the pizza!

The lighting is a bit low, the ambiance is fairly romantic, so I would guess it is an ideal location for a date (not a first date though, let's get real). I went with a group and split a couple of bottles of house chianti. I think the bottles were less than $30 each, so it wasn't too terrible (to be fair though, I didn't pay and don't remember that well). We split a few dishes between our group, the portions were all so big that 3 entrees were enough to feed all 5 of us. Considering how big the portions are, the prices don't seem so expensive. It is nice that if you mention you are splitting an entree, they will plate it separately for you, not just give you an extra plate. I tried the lobster ravioli, the gorgonzola gnocchi, and the ribeye with potatoes and seasoned veggies. At this point, I should warn you that the menu is primarily in Italian (the dish names at least, the descriptions are in English), so some people have difficulty understanding it. All of the dishes were pretty good, though the gorgonzola gnocchi was a little bland for what it was.

Each dish was large enough to share between four.

This was our first visit. Upon entering, we were greeted by a very nice gentleman, who addressed me by name. That was a pleasant surprise, considering that this was my first visit. I did have a reservation for 1PM, but I still liked being greeted like that. We were then escorted to our table in a beautiful dining area, which I'd describe as classy and intimate. Now, for the most important parts. Our waiter, Brad H., provided excellent customer service. Two of us had the Linguine Mare Chiaro, which was excellent. My other sister ordered the Bistecca di Manzo, which is a grilled center cut \u00a0New York Strip, accompanied by Yukon Gold potatoes, toasted garlic veggies and Veal Reduction. My sis loved this plate, which I think I'll try on my next visit. The salads were fresh, crisp and not drowned in dressing. Just right. The complimentary bread was fresh and tasy. We finished off our great meal with dessert and coffee. The Tiramisu was outstanding and very flavorful. Nice and fresh. The coffee was great, as it's served from a French Press, so you know that's truly a fresh, flavorful cup of coffee. Back to our waiter, Brad H. He was very attentive throughout our meal, making sure that our beverages were full and table kept tidy. Brad was very pleasant and efficient, which I always pay close attention to. Brad scores an A+ for making our visit very enjoyable. Lastly, a tip. I'm not a coupon or discount person, but for whatever reason, I tried something today. If you do a Yelp check-in from Luce, you get a free Tiramisu. I showed the Yelp/Luce offer to Brad and he immediately credited my check with the free Tiramisu.

But, dry because of all the rice so we asked for extra tomato sauce [which, btw, is lovely and tasted homemade!]Ravioli di Ricotta: the ravioli was bland and tasted frozen. The asparagus was fresh and crunchy. My least favorite dish of the night.Polenta con Carciofi: very dry and dense. We didn't finish it. Good for a few bites, but not much more than that.Salumi e Formaggio Misti: a meat & cheese dish. Ok, but my taste buds weren't quite into it.Calamari: just too \"soggy\", in my opinion! I personally like my calamari \u00a0with some crunch on the outside and some chew on the inside. One of my friends loved it, though, and waxed that puppy off.For dessert, we split:Lemon Tart (sorry, don't recall the exact menu name): a lemon pudding with pine nuts on top of this crumbly, delicious cookie crust thing. Tart and refreshing!Chocolate Lava: comes with vanilla gelato on top and is a rich, decadent melt-in-your mouth brownie! Yum!

The calamari came w/ a citrus aioli and a marinara w/ red pepper flakes on top. \u00a0The calamari was a generous portion and was greaseless and crispy. \u00a0It was $3.50. \u00a0The artichoke hearts were lightly floured and fried and they were equally delicious and free of grease. \u00a0They were $3. \u00a0The insalata was a combination of shrimp, calamari, diver scallops and conch w/ arugula and chopped celery in an olive oil and garlic dressing. \u00a0It was fantastic and only $5.50. \u00a0By the time we had finished most of those dishes the idea of dinner had become a dim memory.

The one star is for the decor and that's it. My husband, mother, and I just finished having one of the most overpriced and bland meals of our lives here. I ordered the Pappardelle with Duck and Boar which was I guess duck and boar but it certainly had nary the flavor of either animal. It should have tasted like unicorn tears but it could have been unseasoned hamburger for all the flavor it had. Turns out that I lucked out in the flavor department because my husband's gnocchi with three meat bolognese was so overcooked that the gnocchi's completely disintegrated when you tried to stick a fork in them. The bolognese \"sauce\" was a pile of meat with almost no sauce consistency. You think, \"What's wrong with a pile of meat?\" and I say \"Nothing! Except that yet again, it tasted like damp cardboard shavings and the dry kibble from my dog's bowl\". As soon as they set my mother's lasagna down I was suspect of the sauce as it was bright, shiny, just out of a can red. Turns out that that suspicion was correct. It tasted like someone had dumped pureed tomato onto three layers of, yet again, pasta cooked within an inch of it's life and then filled it with, again, totally unseasoned hamburger meat. I cannot understand how a restaurant cannot season meat as that rule is pretty much cooking 101. All of this and one glass of house cabernet set us back $71....If you're going to price your dishes at that level, making your own homemade pasta, hiring someone who knows how to cook it, and giving more than a passing glance at salt and pepper should probably be part of the equation.

I just love the vines growing up the building. We went knowing the food wasn't the greatest but still were willing to give it a try. It was as mediocre as we expected. Nothing fancy, I've had better at Macaroni Grill. We tried the Tuna and Mozzarella Caprese for appetizers and I had the Gluten-free Chicken Pizza. My caprese didn't even had the balsamic on it and I thought it should have had olive oil. The tuna was good, the sauces weren't very Mediterranean. And my pizza crust was burnt all the way around. The chicken was also very dry. The service was okay, alittle too casual for my liking. Overall we had an enjoyable night and left full. Will I ever go back? Nah, but I liked it just this once."], ["Undercover F.", "Osso Bucco pretty darn good!Dissapointed about the size of salad, very tiny for 10$. :( Shrimp dish,... great flavor, however the shrimp batter was undercooked. Our server was very friendly."], ["Angela F.", "Absolutely terrible food, service & overall experience. I had severe doubts about coming here as it was - as a local, I know the majority of restaurants on the Riverwalk are about quantity (of tourists), not quality. BUT, my office holiday party was here so begrudgingly I trudged with THE worlds worst expectations. I was right and, shockingly, my bad expectations were worsened!We'd made reservations weeks in advance. I walk in & see over half my office milling by the hostess stand...?? They were told to let the hostess know when our party arrived? Uhh. I told the hostess to seat us - there was an empty table reserved just for us...why the eff not? (Even if our FULL party hadn't arrived yet). She took us to our table, saw our group was only about half arrived, then asked us to return to bar area. Ridiculous! We sat down. Our rude waiter let us know as soon as we sat (& many times during the horrific meal) that the table was reserved again so hurry it along. Nice greeting huh? Not kidding. He was the worst: ignored our questions & requests - literally, no reply when asked if bread would accompany the oil on the table (it came 25 min later). He made smart ass comments when we asked a few questions about appetizers then a few of us decided against ordering any (while the other half of the party did). He reached over everyone & cleared plates that people were eating off of at that very moment. Just awful! He was actually Italian, too! SO not the way real Italians dine or serve in Italy, man. You've been Americanized in the wrong & worst way!The food was equally awful. Calamari app was sizable, but gooey & soggy. I ordered the fruta de mare, which was mussels, shrimp, scallops, & lobster atop linguine in a white wine sauce. The sauce wasn't white wine & was flavorless...I had to add salt & pepper. The seafood was frozen & overcooked. The \"lobster\" tasted & looked like crawfish. I ate a few bites then couldn't take any more. I had a taste of the \"famous\" Shrimp Paesano - yuck! The shrimp were overcooked & mushy. The only compliment I'm able to render is the pastas were cooked perfectly al dente.STAY AWAY from here! The Paesanos on 1604 is far superior to this crap shoot."], ["Alexis B.", "Pretty good Italian food on the Riverwalk! \u00a0Classic Italian options in a classy restaurant!"], ["Anna L.", "I'll preface this by saying we did not eat here. We stopped in for an after dinner drink while strolling the Riverwalk. Large covered outdoor area, large bar and indoor seating made this an ideal spot for a rainy evening. We opted to sit at the bar - the entire interior of this place is cement which if crowded could make for a noisy dining experience. Fortunately, we were the only two at the bar. We ordered our drinks from a very friendly and attentive bartender. He was kind enough to share some tips about local coffee shops/delis in the area to get us away from the tourist traps. He was also kind enough to allow us to taste some of the amaretto and limoncello he had made himself - it was quite good actually. Meals coming out of the kitchen looked good. However, I will say I was somewhat put off by the smell of someone's fish dish. Fish should not give off that strong an odor. Compared to other spots on the Riverwalk, this felt a bit less touristy. If I were in town again and had a hankering for Italian, I would be tempted to give the pasta a try. I would definitely skip the seafood."], ["Teresa L.", "I had a sampler platter with two pieces of shrimp, fried calamari and seared tuna. \u00a0The two shrimp weren't great, but the fried calamari was completely disgusting. \u00a0The thick unseasoned batter fell of the calamari when I picked it up. \u00a0I have had a lot of calamari, but this calamari was wasn't as much chewy as it was spongy. \u00a0If it was in fact calamari, it was either tenderized (since their were slits throughout the calamari) or it was some kind of calamari that I have never had. \u00a0It wasn't in rings, but in strips. Unfortunately, my plate was overflowing with calamari. \u00a0I only had four or five bite sized pieces of tuna and two shrimp. \u00a0My boyfriend liked his salad with seared tuna and his sister thought her food was okay.When I told the server that it was obvious that I didn't like the calamari, she totally ignored me. \u00a0That what pissed me off most. \u00a0The food is way overpriced for the quality. \u00a0I'm just not having much luck with food in Texas. \u00a0People are starting to worry about me because I'm not eating much at all.

I didn't really ask any questions - I just did what she said =).I was not disappointed. I ended up getting the fettuccine with gorgonzola cream sauce and spinach, with shrimp. Another colleague ended up getting the same thing, but with chicken. The only complaint we had was that we expected the spinach to be cooked. It wasn't, and I think it would've fit the dish better if it were, but oh well. We all enjoyed our food and the portions were good sizes. It is a little pricey and I'm not sure how worth the price it is, and how often I'd go if my work wasn't picking up the tab. But definitely good food!"], ["Ruben B.", "Traditional italian place with a good view but nothing much more than that. I had a pasta with spinach.

As a concierge, I've been recommending this place for a while and finally got around to visiting it myself.My friend and I went in for a 9pm reservation, though it didn't seem like a reservation was necessary. They didn't ask if I had one at all. It was a Monday night, so I guess that's expected. We sat down and asked for a drink menu. We look under aged so I don't blame them for not providing it from the beginning. I was hoping after ordering drinks our waiter would warm up to us more, cause he lacked any charisma or concern towards us. They're menu has some creative cocktail options. Several fruit martinis to choose from and I choose the pomegranate. My friend got a Bellini and it was so delicious it didn't taste like alcohol at all.I took a while to order but finally decided on Frutta Di Mare with white wine sauce. It came with scallops, mussels and lobster. I opted out of the shrimp since my friend was allergic, but it was still loaded with seafood. My friend just got spaghetti with tomato sauce, and thought it was really good considering the simplicity of it. Our waiter finally brought us bread, but I was slightly disappointed because I heard they would provide table side hummus as well. Finally, I had a dining brochure for the downtown area that scored us free dessert. It was just ice cream balls rolled it graham crackers, sprinkles and chocolate sauce. Very simple but still a nice ending to a great dinner."], ["Malorie B.", "This is the worst place I've ever been in the river walk, maybe even in my home town too.

As for the food it was so salty we couldn't even eat it. I barely touched it and the hotel had no place to reheat it even if they had offered to make me another one. $25 is a lot to spend on something I couldn't eat. Like, seriously was not capable of eating it. It was very obvious they believe in quantity over quality. We were from out of town, so they didn't care. I don't appreciate that kind of logic and it's terrible for tourism. I'm sorry we aren't locals and don't deserve a better experience. All in all I just spent $60 plus tip on food and drinks we barely touched.

Craving pork instead of the pork chop he recommended the braised pork on the bone with gnocchi and steamed asparagus. I would give the gnochhi 4 stars the texture was chewy and not dense and the sauce on the pork went very well with the gnocchi. The reason I give a 3 star was the slight disappointment on the pork. Part of the pork was tender and came right off the bone but the other part of the pork was tough and without more sauce the pork was a little too salty Service was great the waiter came often making sure my drink is refilled. Because of the waiter's high recommendation of the pork and describing how juicy and tender the meat would be, it was more disappointing.However, overall the service was great and the portions of the braised pork and gnocchi was very large and filling.

I've had the same dish at cookie-cutter chain restaurants, and frankly they do it better than this place at a much lower price point. The meat was very thin and much too tough, and the pasta was underdone. The marsala sauce had a good flavor, but it didn't make up for the other noted issues.My friend ordered lasagna, and he said it was quite dry. My kids ordered the pizza (one cheese, one Italian sausage). I tried the latter, and found the pizza to be of mediocre quality. The Italian sausage topping was simply dreadful - it was hard, dry, and way overcooked.The portion sizes for all of the meals were acceptable for the price, but the quality fell significantly short in relation to the cost.I will say that our waiter was excellent, in spite of the mediocre food.

For the past five or six years we have even made it our Valentines Day tradition. NO MORE!I will no longer bend over backwards simply to make the reservation for Valentines Day dinner. What could be so difficult, you ask? Can you simply call the restaurant? No. Maybe shoot the restaurant an email? No. You MUST visit their website. Why? To fill out a form, but NOT a web form, in which you fill in the blanks and click \"Submit.\" It's a PDF form - but not a PDF which you can edit on your screen and \"Send.\" \u00a0You are REQUIRED to download and print the three page PDF. Page one is the fixed menu for your amazing Valentines dinner. Pages two and three MUST be completed and returned to Paesanos catering department. If you happen to do this reservation soon enough, you can mail it in. If not, you MUST then scan these two pages and email/fax them in. One of the two pages has no more than a single bit of information - \"How many guests? ___\" (Sure, let's use an entire page for that.) The other page, though, is your reservation contract. Contract? There is no other way to put it. You fill out all of your personal information, like name, phone, credit card, etc, then sign and date after reading a statement which states in effect that you will be there, and if for some reason you can't be there you WILL be charged for the entire meal anyway. They are such sticklers for getting this contract, that when I called several days early and offered to give my information over the phone because my printer/scanner was broken, they suggested I use the UPS Store. Nice.Let me tell you, Paesanos, I thought it was arrogant and presumptuous to require making these reservations in this way then, and still do now 5 or 6 years later. But the degradation in food quality and service is the last nail in the coffin.We have had a couple of borderline experiences at Paesanos over the years - not limited to Valentines Day - but will stick to this particular visit.-- There was chaos at the hostess stand with walkup guests mingled with reservation guests, and no clear delineation-- Service was terrible. Our appetizer was sent to the wrong table at least twice. Delivery of our entree was VERY late, with tables seated after us actually finishing and leaving before we were served. Our waitress assured us no fewer than three times that our food was on the way out. She didn't offer fresh ground pepper, and we had to ask multiple times for butter and shredded parmesan.-- Food was so far below acceptable it defies description. Crab Cake appetizer, which was offered at a premium, was unexceptional. The Shrimp Paesano was undercooked and rubbery, and it - and accompanying pasta - was so cold it seemed not to have been warmed enough having been removed from the walk-in cooler.-- Price is far and above what should be tolerable for the quality of this restaurant. Prices are bumped up 10% - \u00a020% for this special occasion fixed menu. Add $14 for an appetizer which is not included - and not worth the price. Add $42 for a bottle of so-so wine that retails for about $12. Add, also, the required and pre-printed 20% for the terrible service. Now we have a grand total of about $230 for two people. Wow.I cannot begin to tell you what an amazing evening my wife and I might share at a fraction of that cost at any number of other restaurants. And NOT have any of the headaches and frustrations associated with this one.GOODBYE PAESANOS!Will you miss us? No. Will we miss you? NOT A CHANCE!!EDIT 2/21/15:-- Actually, one of the two pages has just two bits of information; Number of Guests ____, and Which Time - 7pm or 9pm.-- My bill was not $230, it was $212.-- The manager (presumably) called to apologize. Quaint formality, but nothing was offered in any form to redeem themselves. Just one more disappointment. Here's a clue, Paesanos, The customer pays hard earned money for a product/service.

However, my husband ordered the snapper with a red sauce, but when it arrived, it had a butter garlic sauce.

There was still quite a bit of butter sauce at the bottom of the plate and on the fish."]], "Paesano's": [["Necator N.", "I am very impressed - the service was great and prompt, but the reason I even decided to write this review is this:I was here with a large group of co-workers (so no doggy-bags). Hence, I did not want to order pasta (watching my waist, but also don't feel right throwing out the food I didn't eat!) - so I zoomed in on the tuna dish. Now, I only like my tuna raw - theirs was an actual cooked dish... Very gingerly I asked the waiter if they could only flash-fry it on each side for a sec (\"no cooking!!!\" i emphasized) - and that's what I wanted. Raw fish, basically. -- I was very pleasantly surprised when there was not so much as a raised eyebrow from the waiter -- and very soon I was eating some very delicious fish, rendered even more delicious by the reduction and the sauce that it came with.Now, that is what I call customer service and making sure a diner has the best experience. Of note, my numerous co-diners, who all ordered different stuff, were very happy as well."], ["Winter N.", "Soooo, I never really do reviews but..I want to warn anyone that orders the \"seared tuna\" DNT!

The chocolate banana bread pudding is also excellent."], ["Susan C.", "Came by a little early to eat lunch before my reading assignment. \u00a0I tried the drum special. Two lightly-breaded drum filets with a lemon cream caper sauce with garlic pasta and green beans. Also came with the house salad. The server Joe was very accommodating. He spaced the food timing very well as I had some time to kill. He also gave me some garlic bread in addition to the usual bread basket. The drum was very good. Only $15.95. Pretty good for Paesano's. I was tempted to do dessert, but was just too full. A very nice experience."], ["Yvette S.", "If you have never been here and you like shrimp you will have to try the Shrimp Paesano.I like mine with Capalleni & the traditional lemon butter sauce it is excellent.The calamari is more like calamari steak fingers so be prepared to share with like 4 people or you'll never get through your food.Love the cocktails too."], ["Marisa G.", "I love Italian food but I will not order Italian when I visit. My taste buds have a small issue with the marinara meat sauce they use on their spaghetti. I have been for several lunch meetings in their party rooms that always come with a small pre-selected menu so I have had several of their pasta dishes and they are just ok. Their famous Shrimp Paesano leaves me hungry and the butter sauce gets boring after one shrimp. So why do I visit at least once sometimes twice a month?! When I need a \"healthly salad\" I always choose Paesano's. Their Special Salad is AMAZING!! It comes with avocado, hearts of palm, artichokes and tomatoes and I usually get it with a small portion of the calamari steak fingers. It is one of the best calamari's in San Antonio. This meal is 5 stars! Add in the brown fruit and nut bread and I am in heaven.Warning ... their dinner specials are very pricy. Our mouth was watering after the server told us about a crab special and it was really good but I still had sticker shock when the bill came and it was $45. Please note that they have two other locations in San Antonio but the menus are not the same that is why I am writing a review for this location. Like I mentioned this location and the one off 1604 was very nice private dining areas so keep them in mind if you are needing space."], ["Roxie C.", "So I had several things on the menu. First I tried the shrimp paesano the breading covered the shrimp and the sauce was buttery and partially broken. Then I had the calamari. The breading did not have great flavor, but was good enough...however the sauce for the calamari (I guess it was suppose to be marinara) was way too sweet. \u00a0Then I had the osso bucco lamb. They also had veal osso bucco. The lamb came with goat cheese polenta. The polenta did not have enough salt or pepper added to it. The \u00a0tomato sauce added to the plate was good.

When I got the bill and saw that the charge was for $35 I was pretty surprised as I feel that price did not reflect quality. I could spend $35 for an entree at other places in town and have a much better dining experience.Our waiter was nice but he was overworked.Will I go back? No. The cocktails were good but I just dont think the prices are appropriate for the quality of food that I was served."], ["Brooke S.", "I come here solely for the shrimp paesano, been a hands down favorite since I was a kid. The quarry location is definitely the better of the three. Except my last visit I was convinced my server had Asperger's Syndrome. Sadly I don't remember her name but she was so socially awkward it honestly interfered with my entire meal.. She went from being extremely abrasive to overbearingly fake nice. I happen to be pregnant and at one point she stopped addressing me directly and was talking to my stomach in a baby voice asking if the baby wanted more pasta, I felt extremely uncomfortable (and no, I did not need more pasta). I also happened to be dining with a male friend who is not the babies father and she kept telling him congratulations, making both of us uncomfortable yet again. Normally the service is outstanding, so I will definitely be returning.. But I would avoid being served by a tall slightly overweight blonde woman."], ["Nicole S.", "Two words: shrimp Paesanos! Order it!

The gnoochi were bland to the point of being completely flavorless. The oso bucco wasn't very tender and didn't have much flavor.There are many other better Italian restaurants around.

Like many older local places, it's very casual, feel free to come in shorts during the summer. \u00a0Outside of known busy times, like Friday night, you should be seated quickly by a hostess and I've never had bad service here. \u00a0I'm often a single diner and appreciate getting first-class service despite that.In addition, I believe the entire menu is available to-go, in nice metal trays and perfectly packed. \u00a0A great way to serve a gourmet meal at home."], ["Terry M.", "Having heard from friends about the quality of the cuisine, we took out-of-town relatives there for dinner.

I ordered baked cannelloni and a house salad. The salad was a large pile of lettuce, mostly iceberg, with something purple that might have been radicchio but more likely was red lettuce. There wasn't anything else on the plate except a nice vinaigrette. The bread was served with a bowl of unseasoned olive oil. My cannelloni was fine, a bit salty, but tasty and nicely done. My husband had a snapper special with artichokes. It was swimming in butter and was served with a side of plain spaghetti, also very oily. He thought it was only okay.The two other adults in our party seemed really to enjoy their meals (lamb shank for one, lobster pasta special for the other), but they both are on the hefty side and eating is a big part of their lives. Nobody had a drink other than 2 teas.The check amounted to more than $150 for the 4 of usl. In my opinion -- very definitely NOT worth it.

NONE of the wines on the winelist have a year, so you'll be paying top dollar for your current year's selection. The bartender was nice and accommodating (the only employee who was impressive). We finally got a table...in the cold, far from a heater, and by a table of kids (5 kids stuck at the end of their parents' table!). I asked if we could move inside and got ATTITUDE from the hostess. Sorry to be such an inconvenience! There were many tables available inside. Our waiter came and proceded to tell us that everything we wanted on the appetizer menu was sold out, so we just waited (and waited) for bread and olive oil. Bland, tasteless bread... We ordered, and the wait for the food was not too bad.

The salad consisted soley of insipid lettuce. The so-called bearnaise sauce was surely mayonnaise from a jar. The tomatoes were canned rather than fresh. The pasta was limp and boiled to within an inch of its life. The so-called \"lamb\" was actually stringy mutton. We could have had better food, and fresher vegetables, at Luby's.

Appetizers were already on the table, so we got to sample some amazing calamari and a wonderful appetizer of proscuitto, apple, and mascarpone cheese on tiny bits of toast. There was a preset menu from which I ordered the shrimp penne. It was frickin delicious. The red sauce was fresh and fragrant, with the hint of spice throughout. The penne was al dente and the rock shrimp perfectly cooked. If you've ever had overcooked shrimp in pasta sauce, you'll know why it was so important to describe the yum. For dessert I had the cappuccino pie. Delightful. It was chocolate and coffee and I am not sad about either of those things.

I am not sure how the chef or our server or anyone else in the back of the restaurant could have missed that! \u00a0My husband's osso buco was not only flavorless (I had to take his salt shaker away before he gave himself a stroke) but it was also so tough it required a knife. I'm sorry, osso buco should FALL off the bone. I ordered the shrimp diablo on the recommendation of our server. I received 4 completely overcooked shrimp covered in what appeared & tasted like a can of stewed tomatoes. It came with a lovely side of overcooked store bought pasta. NOTE, an Italian restaurant should be ashamed to serve anything but housemade pasta.The only decent thing was the wine list, of course they were sold out of our first choice.

Very rarely do I give one star... Especially if there was no \"incident\". The food was just that bad. Maybe I came on an off night, but I was expecting so much more. I ordered the lasagna and I can honestly say it could compete for the title of worst lasagna. Not even frozen food is that bland. It was cold in the center and didn't taste fresh at all. I probably should've sent it back, but I couldn't see anything else on their menu being good after eating that. I was dissatisfied with the price as well considering the poor quality of food. The ambiance is nice, but that alone couldn't make me return.

He sat down and the back of the chair broke and he fell back, he now has two purple bruises on both of his legs. I'm sure broken chairs don't happen frequently but sadly we weren't so lucky. We thought because my husband had a painful embarrassing fall at a nice restaurant that the management would be more \"customer friendly\" . No one that worked there that saw didn't even ask if he was ok, we personally had to ask to speak to the manager. The manager was strictly business oriented and not \"customer is first\" oriented. When we told him what happened he did ask if he was ok and if he needed medical attention (that I'm sure we would have to pay for a faulty chair) . But, as soon as my embarrassed husband said he was \"ok\" and not wanting to make a big deal about it, the manager quickly changed his mood and just bluntly told him to sign an accident form. We thought the manager would be more concerned about our visit to this restaurant since we had heard so many great things about it and we were highly disappointed. He didn't seem like he cared much that my husband got hurt and when my husband asked him if they could comp some of our check because of the accident, the manager didn't really want to. We didn't go to this restaurant to go eat for free we knew we were gunna pay a high price for our good food. We drove from Houston with our 11 month old baby,had a tiring day at sea world and thought we'd had a nice relaxing dinner. The manager was pretty hesitant when my husband asked him for that favor. I've been to many restaurants and seen accidents happen and the waiters/managers go out of their way to make that persons visit a great one even with an accident. Like free drinks,a discount, or paid main entrees. This wasn't our experience with this restaurant. My husband then asked the manager at the end of our meal for a copy of what he signed and the manager didn't ask him any questions and just handed it to him and didn't even make sure we had at least a great meal. Our food experience was good it was great food but the only reason I give it two stars is for the managers service sadly it wasn't a great one.

The pizza overall was great."], ["Chris K.", "Had pizza, gelato and cannolis here, and the gelato was definitely the highlight!We had cheese pizza, mushroom, pepperoni and a meat combo. The meat combo was the standout, the sausage is super good. A little spendy for the type of food, but overall very good.The cannoli was also good, that chocolate was the best. Gelato was really really good though and the chocolate waffle cone was a great addition.Definitely recommend but be ready to spend a little bit."], ["Kristin M.", "Came to this place in the afternoon and right as we came in the door, we were greeted by Alfredo. We ordered a couple slices of pizza with Canadian bacon and pineapple which were amazingly delicious. Alfredo served us and topped the pizzas with a garlic infused oil which added a nice flavor to the pizzas.I've never yelped before but I was so impressed with this establishment that I felt I must. It's super cute, plays Italian music, and the pizza and gelato are wonderful. Support local businesses and come eat here!"], ["Eugene L.", "Rio de Gelato is the only pizzeria in San Antonio that serves retro Dr. Pepper made with Imperial pure cane sugar in the glass bottles. \u00a0The bottles are 8 oz. so buy two if you wish. \u00a0That's what I should've done. \u00a0The crust is crisp and thick with a perfect amount of sauce and cheese. \u00a0It's not your typical NY style pizza. \u00a0And you cannot go wrong with the tunes being played. \u00a0I would've ordered gelato if it wasn't so cold outside. \u00a0Maybe I'll order it when the weather is a little warmer."], ["Lori S.", "I really fell in love with this place! \u00a0The pizza dough is hand made and the gelato is amazing! \u00a0Alfredo was so warm and friendly and the service is superb. You can tell they really put their heart into everything they do here. There was a short wait, as Alfredo explained he was making everything fresh. The pepperoni is deli style, very large, but great flavor! \u00a0The pizza is thin, but excellent. The dressing on the Caesar salad tastes homemade and the romaine was crisp and fresh. I had the strawberry basil gelato, which was fresh, tart, unique, and tasted like summertime. My son had the banana pecan, reminiscent of the flavor of the hand churned ice cream my mother made when I was a little girl. Parking was limited to lots that charged around $10 and parking meters, but if you are already in the La Villita area or the courthouse downtown, this place is definitely worth stopping for a bite to eat or a little gelato refreshment!"], ["Elzabeth N.", "I walked into Rio de Gelato after a hot bike ride and we were famished. We tried to order a slice of pizza but the only option on Sunday's are whole pies. Since we had no way to carry so much pizza home we opted for the Margherita Crostini, which to our dismay were greasy HEB garlic toasts with a flavorless tomato slice on top. The prices were outrageous, two tiny toasts took 30 minutes, and the pseudo-Italian Schlick was unappreciated. Maybe the gelato was good? but our experience was underwhelming."], ["Filipe F.", "Sad review due to poor service. 5 minutes before closing time walked in to grab only a bottle of water, I was literally escorted out. So no matter how good the food or gelato is I'm not coming back."], ["Stephanie W.", "Even better than their previous location on the Riverwalk! The owner is a delightful gentleman who takes great pride in his delicious creations. Even more so, he loves the guests who visit his business; I made a special trip to visit Rio de Gelato, because I remembered his lovely personality from my first experience. He did not disappoint me this time and made my visit incredibly enjoyable.The gelato is beyond description! The flavors are rich, smooth, and pleasing to the palate. I would highly recommend the strawberry fields and Swiss vanilla. This amazing business is a gem in SAT!"], ["Giselle L.", "The margherita pizza was delish & fresh. Other than that, there really isnt anything else that was above average. \u00a0I wasnt too impressed with their gelato either."], ["Meghan R.", "We had been talking about getting ice cream all weekend, so late Saturday night we finally stopped in as we walked by this gelato place. \u00a0I'm so glad we did. \u00a0Every flavor was beyond good. Everyone was super nice and patiently explained flavors even though i think they were about to close. I wish I could remember the flavor I had. Something with just a little rosemary... Still thinking about it 3 weeks later."], ["Douglas S.", "I got the lunch special a few weeks ago based upon the recommendations of Sheyla and Vanessa at our firm's San Antonio office and it was great!

I am glad that Rio de Gelato is right down the street from my office!"], ["Amanda E.", "Very knowledgeable, friendly staff with great customer service. My husband had the coconut cake and I had gelato, they were both very tasty. We also enjoyed the ambience and location after being on our feet for a while."], ["Steve M.", "So, so worth escaping Riverwalk crowds and humdrum for the gelato here! Inside is cool and quiet, a nice refuge from packed sidewalks and strollers slamming into your ankles.Crema Bourgeois was a favorite flavor, and they also served a nice mint mocha coffee on top of that. Our clerk let us know that all gelato is from family recipes and made by her son. Can't recommend this place enough!"], ["Erica C.", "Best homemade gelato I have ever had. I came here on a very hot Sunday afternoon and remembered from my last visit how delicious the gelato was. When me and my boyfriend walked in we were greeted by the owner who said that the credit card machine wasn't working and he was only taking cash. Of course like most people these days we had no cash, so he advised us to go to the atm across street. Well 5$ later in fees we walked in to get our gelato, and the owner didn't know that the atm machine charged so much in fees. He so kindly gave us free water, and then a free cone for my daughter. After we ordered the strawberry gelato and sat down a while later unknown to me he gave us free pizza which was awesome. You could tell it was fresh and the pepperoni was delicious. Whenever I am in San Antonio I will def be making my mandatory stop here :)"], ["Mark R.", "Was in town and stumbled upon this place. Went in for a gelato which was great. Spoke to the owner, during our conversation I mentioned that I was from New York. He asked me if I've had any pizza in the area. I did and I told him the place I went to was not good. He went in the back and came out with 2 slices for me and 4 for my wife who has allergies..... By far the best pizza that I've had in a long time. What a great day... We ended up spending a couple of hours there eating and talking! The only bad thing about this place is that it is located in Texas and not my home town in New York! This is a must go to place if you are in the area!!!!"], ["Victor O.", "The pizza was terrific. Crispy crust, just the right amount of tanginess, and fresh ingredients....particularly the prosciutto. \u00a0It even pleased my most discerning father in law, who couldn't stop talking about how he enjoyed it. \u00a0We wondered why the restaurant wasn't teeming with customers, cuz the pizza was one of the best we've eaten. Perhaps it's the location, perhaps it's the patience (some wait) needed to get a great pizza. \u00a0 But, the wait and the trek is worthwhile. \u00a0I highly recommend it."], ["Alec G.", "Really interesting flavours of Sorbets, I had the Strawberry and Basil, which at first sounded like a crazy mixture, but in the end it was a delightful treat and a very unique flavor, I give it 4.5 stars because they didn't seem to have a Lemon flavor sorbet! :("], ["Justin G.", "By far the best gelato spot! Also the owner and executive chef is the most kind hearted person I've ever met! Everything is 100% authentic Italian with recipes going as far back as 6 generations. His ingredients are all organic from the home grown Peaches in his peach cobbler gelato to the herbs in his pizza! This place is for sure on my agenda from now on when I come to San Antonio!

Next time I'm trying steak n lasagna.Jacob, the manager, was awesome greeting everyone and making us feel like family. Great atmosphere inside and outside."], ["Brittany G.", "Came here new to the area hoping for some good Italian. Had dinner and thought it was pretty good, \"next time I'll try the pizza.\"Called to order a pizza today (they deliver) was put on hold for 27 minutes only to have the other end not care.Food is mediocre, service is offending.Unfortunately, I can't comment on the pizza."], ["Arlene T.", "Forgot to take pics but had a great meal with my family on Friday night! \u00a0Ordered a large pepperoni, ham and jalapeno pizza and it was amazing! \u00a0 The ceviche was excellent! \u00a0 Not many places can make it like this and you did! \u00a0 Great job! \u00a0 I did order a Ceasar salad and it had feta or Gorgonzola cheese??

Who doesn't? It's always good to find that perfect spot where you can enjoy the perfect (and sometimes crazy) Texas weather and have good food and drinks with friends....and yes people! Guillermo's is that perfect place.I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of bread in general...I think is that kind of food, that just takes away too much space in your stomach and keeps you from eating other delicious stuff. BUT I've finally found the butter to my bread (or the other way around). The bread that they use in their subs is buttery and perfectly seasoned. They make it fresh EVERYDAY and use it for their sandwiches ...is totally mind blowing!And you have to try their Alfredo tomato pasta!It's so creamy and delicious....you gotta trust me on this one! But what really made my night, wasn't their delicious pasta or decadent bread...it was their salsa...yes! You heard me right I have to start by saying that all my friends know, that they key to my heart is... a good salsa. And ooohhh my!!! Guillermo's won my heart and soul!They have this amazing Chipotle salsa which goes perfect with EVERYTHING! Please order it!It goes perfectly with their subs and empanadas."], ["Debbie B.", "Update - Update:I want to thank Steve the GM at Guillermo's for responding to my review. He personal assured that I received the best service that Guillermo's had to offer and I really appreciated the peronal service very unexpected. There may have been a misunderstanding with my order, I do apologize for that. But my correct order looks great and taste great with the extra sauce. I am happy to udate my review. The next time I visit San Antonio I will visit Guillermo's again and I know that I have to order the Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo."], ["McKayla R.", "What an awesome place! My little brother took me here for my first time. We arrived at 8:56, not realizing they closed in 4 minutes. We noticed because they were cleaning up and getting ready to leave. We asked if it was too late to order, they told us no and to come on in! The staff was still happy to have us and treated us as if we were their first.customers. The food was amazing to say the least. I ordered the artichoke appetizer and the spicy sausage with pasta. It came with a salad that was insanely good! The atmosphere is unique and clean. Once again, the service (sam & jacob i believe their names were) was top of the line. I can't wait to come back!"], ["Yvette S.", "Went back today for late lunch early dinner on the patio.Everything was lovely.You could really see the team pull things together and doing their best to keep things running top notch.From the get go things were buzzing and everyone played their roll well.There was a gentle breeze blowing in the wind and it was a sunny day out in their beautiful patio.I had never been seated outside before and we were the first guest be seated out on the patio that early evening.All around it was a great experience eating there from the arrival to the close outand as always the food was superb.The waitress had suggested a few appetizers and then offered us a lovely drink menu with lots of great selection & on that day it was oh so welcomed.Everything was perfect on this day.I had had a couple of experiences prior to this visit that were less than desirable to say the least.However I am writing this review to say that after trying another time and taking a chance coming here's again,I am glad I came back.Still some of the best Italian food around and I will certainly be back to enjoy the patio in the fall!"], ["Nikki M.", "Guillermo's has a variety of tasty dishes, from pizza and pastas to sandwiches and salads.

The food was okay but I'm sticking to the guillermo burger next time we visit. Once we finished our meal it was hard to track down our waiter. We ended up going up to the front and one of the hostesses found our waiter for us. When we were waiting at the front for our check to be processed I was able to peek into the kitchen and saw one of the staff members making multiple salads with no gloves (no utensils or tongs for grabbing the salad items either, just his hands). I'm not sure how that works if someone has food allergies... so if you're allergic to nuts or other things that they put on their salads I advise not ordering a salad if that's the way they normally prepare them."], ["Vickie M.", "Extremely enjoyed our meal. We ordered Four seasons pizza, artichoke dip, vegetoboli and spinach bow tie salad. The salad was amazing I will be back for that alone. Everything was fresh tasting and hot. Pizza was a bit skimpy on topping and thin but good. Great outdoor seating with music. Restaurant is made up off two old homes converted into an eatery. We sat inside only because it was to warm out. Inside is small but nice. When you enter the inside you will notice the home is a bit tilted but it's an old home so it adds to the coolness of the building. We really enjoyed our dinner and will be back our next trip to downtown San Antonio."], ["Mike M.", "Went back to have a late lunch. We sat in the patio again and were waited on pretty quickly by Sam. We ordered beers and tuna de gallo. We were pleased with the food and the service. We then ordered a small margherita pizza and the King Guillermo pita. Both were awesome, especially the King Guillermo pita which has beef fajita meat, chorizo, onions, lettuce and cheese. This was what the waiter recommended and he got it right! Also, they have the best bow tie pasta & spinach salad eveh. Way better experience this time and we'll definitely come back."], ["Jacklynn M.", "I love, love, love their food!! A little on the pricey side for a salad, but I would defintely go back again!!"], ["Amanda F.", "Fabulous lunch spot in downtown SA. A little concealed and off the beaten path. An Italian theme with a TexMex flavor on a few of their dishes. We've been here twice. As far as service, they are excellent -very courteous and quick. The atmosphere is a little loud if you sit inside but it's nice that they have live music occasionally. The food was what brought this to 3 stars. It frankly wasn't that impressive. The salads are good, but have too much pasta- not enough salad. The portions are huge if you like that aspect, but nothing in the dishes we ordered really wowed me."], ["Christina G.", "This place is the place to go for Italian food! It's so good here! The customer services is impressively good too! Every staff member I met was so nice to my friends and I. The food is so goooood! And so are the drinks!

I couldn't resist ordering a pizza & side salad. The hand made pizza was very flavorful & had a blend of spices.

OK, let's get to the food. The kitchen goes out of their way to make and present delicious items. We had the empanadas and they were outstanding. \u00a0The sauces that come with this order (cilantro pesto and a chipotle marinara)are made from scratch and are extremely tasty. \u00a0We also tasted the Tuna de Gallo with tortilla chips...wow!We decided on the Stromboli (which two can share) which came with a salad. \u00a0If you are a fan of great salads, then look no further. We had the Spinach and Pasta Salad. I could try to describe it but it wouldn't do it justice. \u00a0Just try it! \u00a0By the way, the Stromboli was fantastic!Their bar has local brews (Busted Sandal IPA for me) and wines, as well as overall good drink menu.Bottom Line - If you haven't experienced Guillermo's, then put it on your list...you will be happy you did!

Small clean dining area. We went at 6pm on a Saturday and were immediately seated.Started the meal off with the spinach artichoke dip. I enjoyed it! It was really cheesy and served with these little slices of bread for dipping. There was a sweet aftertaste from the bread that was amazing! My fianc\u00e9 and I shared the 12\" four seasons pizza. It was good as well. I would probably make my own pizza and choose the toppings instead if I ordered the pizza again. Total bill was around 25 dollars.

We caught a sniff of the grill downwind and were lured in. The visit turned out to be pretty good. Warm greeting, quickly seated, menus prompt. Specials read, decided on a sandwich and salad. I had a bacon/cheese/avocado on crusty focaccia bread with spnich salad, and wife had a Chicken Club. Brother/sis in law ordered similar, although SIL had just an appetizer. Waitress seemed to be pretty knowledgeable about the menu, but also seemed a bit unenergetic.All food came out quickly and to order. Most of you who follow my reviews know that I am a big fan of all-you-can-drink sodas and tea. Well...wife, BIL and SIL had a tea. Guess who had a soda? Yep. This is where I deduct a star. First, drinks are NOT listed on the menu, and they should be listed. I did ask if it was a Coca Cola or Pepsi establishment, to which the waitress replied \"Coke\". I failed to ask if they offered free refills on soda. My mistake. Waitress brought out A...1...SINGULAR...can of Coke. I asked for free refills. Nope. EACH can is $2. WHAT? So...minus a star for that. If I go to a restaurant, I expect to be told this kind of information. And if you can charge that much for a CAN of soda...sorry, water it shall be.So...great food, great service...not so good on soda refills. And this, Guillermo's, made my mind up to ask from now on about FREE REFILLS on ALL drinks. And to be absolutely certain it is Coca Cola. If you are a Pepsi establishment, I will either ask for the default Dr. Pepper, or just leave.I have come to the conclusion that asking for sweet tea is an epic FAIL. Most places serve it, and it's either sour (from the restaurant's failure to clean the tea service), weak, or just doesn't taste like I like it. So I have given up on sweet tea when dining out.And I forgot where I was...downtown in the heart of the touristy district, where everything is majorly upcharged."], ["Sergio D.", "This place has a real small time charm, ive explored their menu enough to tell you they strive for quality so if its there its because its done right, and more importantly well. Thow bow tie salad is exciting, the mixtures of the house dressing contrasts well with the other ingredients is an incredible start to any of their sandwiches, which I typically order with the chicken cilantro, which when put into words equates to repeat offender. The pesto they add into the sandwich ties everything together.Service has always been very attentive. The staff is very seasoned and very professional.At lunch they have been doing this order at the front kinda thing, I get it. It can get busy and I imagine if you are new to the place hoe it can get overwhelming.The menus range is wide. This place is a gem amongst me and my natives."], ["Alex C.", "I have eaten at this restaurant a few times, and I have to give them two stars. First off, the food here is pretty decent, and I really like their pasta salad and their turkey sandwich on focaccia bread. The last few times I've come here, the service has been kinda spotty (slow for the food and for the waitress to refill our drinks) and I've just felt like they would find room in the restaurant to seat me, but made me feel as if I was inconveniencing them. I thought I'd give it one more shot.The last time I visited, the hostess immediately met my mother and I with a very curt \"we're closed,\" which confused me, because she had just finished seating a party of nine. NINE people! So, we walked all the way back through the patio area, and my mom asked the waitress (who was now taking drink orders for said party of nine), if they were closed. She said no, which is odd, because the hostess had just shooed us away. I don't know if it's how we were dressed, or how we looked (t-shirt and jeans), but it made us both very angry and we don't plan on making a return trip.

What a refreshing experience."], ["Jenny K.", "Finally a restaurant that was ever so kind to accommodate my love for pesto. Our waiter Jacob, was very hospitable, greeted us with a smile. Walking inside my nose was overwhelmed by the aromatic smell of fresh pesto! My dish was made specifically for my often pretentious nose . Our Spinach and Artichoke appetizer was the best I've had. My chicken pasta special order with the best Pesto, my tounge has ever tasted. Of course, we had to try something off the desert menu. My Tres Leches cake was out of this world. On top of it all the restaurant was extremely clean! To all who are true foodies, Guillermo's is a MUST!!"], ["Sarah F.", "We sat outside and there was a guy playing the piano. All the staff were very friendly. We went in a Thursday and they had $2 9oz margaritas! I little too sweet but still ok for the price. The mix salad was delicious! It had almonds, cranberries, pineapples, feta cheese, green olives, and the dressing was good. I ordered the fettuccine tomato pasta. I was a little disappointed, I was kind of bland. The focaccia bread was good though. My bf got a calzone which was really good. I will defiantly come back."], ["Lisa S.", "I would like to update this review and improve the rating based on a very positive interaction with the owner who reached out to kindly offer that my friends and I come back again and give them another chance.

Since we live downtown we will be back! Hubby had jumbo shrimp Alfredo which was also excellent!"], ["Jessica A.", "Whenever I am in this part of downtown Guillermo's is always the place to refuel. I say refuel because no matter what I order from a salad to a tasty pasta dish the portions are huge! The arrival of ones food is a bit funky, I advise if in a group order everything together so your food comes out at the same time. Separate tickets equals separate arrival times and no one wants to watch their friends eat. Italian food is their specialty and the focaccia bread is sooo good but the salads here are my favorite things. The chicken & pepperoni ranch salad is probably totally unhealthy when it comes to salads but so worth it! They have plenty of sandwich options, burgers and a number of teas to chose from. Their white sangria and chamoy margaritas are quite refreshing on the very shady very roomy patio. For being in a busy area and being well busy finding a spot to sit or the food wait have never been a problem."], ["Bryan M.", "This place is a great find... from sandwiches to pizza to pasta... you jave to tey this place for lunch..

I ordered the four seasons or something like that. Too much tomatoe though and the cheese on some of the slices was weird. Don't even know if it was cheese? The patio is dog friendly and they brought a bowl of ice water for my doggie. The guitar player DeHoyos was amazing! I ordered wings which were too overly seasoned with salt and Parmesan cheese. I was so thirsty and my waiter disappeared! I had had a pi\u00f1a colada which was delicious but I needed another drink! I finally had to ask the hostess for my waiter. He was attending guests inside and kept forgetting about me. Cute waiter named Michael. When I got home, I was missing my credit card! I called Guillermo's and they were already closed. I emailed them like they suggested on their recording and five days later I haven't heard anything. I had cancelled my credit card that same day.

We had a couple hiccups with service and other restaurant items but the manager seemed sincere and authentic in his desire to resolve then. Wing pizza is a cool concept and was ready good.

Very good!FOOD: The bowtie pasta salad was so good! Sounds like it shouldn't work, but it so does! Lettuce, pasta, cranberries, pineapples, olives, shaved almonds(?), peperoncinis, tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing. The Turkey/Bacon/Avocado sandwich was almost perfect - I prefer my deli meat sliced thinner, but the bacon was crispy and the bread was soft and fresh.AMBIANCE: Very casual. They have a little patio that looks like it would be nice if it wasn't 111 degrees.PARKING: Decent sized lot behind the restaurant."], ["Abel R.", "i tried this place a couple days ago and I must say its really good. the bowtie and sandwhiches are so delicious and tasty.

I had the Italian ham and pepperoni sandwich with the bowtie salad. \u00a0The salad was amazing in portion, freshness, and taste. \u00a0The mix of apple bits with the light vinaigrette was an ideal segway into my sandwich. \u00a0The sandwich was top notch. The oil added to perfectly spiced meats with a bed of bread that made for a great balance of chewy and crispy. Ive had some quality Italian sandwiches, but this may be the best."], ["Melissa M.", "Went to Guillermo's with my fianc\u00e9 and a couple of friends. We had an overall pleasant experience. The seating is on the patio and the view is a bit \"ghetto\" since it seems to be in a sketchy area of town, but the food is pretty good especially for the price. Most of the pasta dishes are $12.99. Cheaper than olive garden!We had the spinach artichoke dip to share and the serving was plentiful. They put marina in their dip. The bread is nice and toasty and they give you quite a bit. It was definitely one of my FAVORITE things of the night. I ordered the Grilled Pasta with Spicy Italian Sausage. It was just average to me. It said there was supposed to be cheese in it, but I couldn't really taste any cheese. I think it was a bit too marina-ish to me and too many veggies. \u00a0I think next time I'm going to try one of the lasagnas. My pasta came with a spinach and bowtie salad which was unique and EXCELLENT. The serving sizes were plentiful. I'm sure the salad could've made a meal in itself. The pasta also came with garlic bread which was flavorful but was not warm enough and needed to be toasted longer. Finally, they have killer frozen sangrias. SOOO yummy! I'd definitely try one of those.Overall, we generally enjoyed our meal at Guillermo's and thought it was well worth the price. \u00a0I would definitely try Guillermo's again, but I'm going to have to try a different pasta."], ["Jaclyn R.", "Came here after spending an afternoon at a nearby museum. My boyfriend and I were extremely hungry when he suggested Guillermo's. Having never been before I appreciated his warning when he said \"it's an older house and I like that they've expanded outside because it can get cramped inside\". I regret sitting inside because the weather was absolutely gorgeous for a San Antonio August day, that and we were sat at the only two top table right smack in the middle of the restaurant. It almost felt as though we were on display. The house Guillermo's is in has seen its fair share of weathering over the years as evidenced by the worn wooden floorboards. Regardless, I really enjoyed the bold colors and quaint interior.Our waitress, Oralia, was really nice and attentive. When I apologized after sucking down my glass of water in record time, she asked if we would like a carafe of water. Even though she did not have reason to come by and check on us frequently since the camel (that's me) had an unlimited supply of water, it didn't stop her from coming by just as often as she visited her other tables.We ordered the calamari, while most of them came out looking like they were tentacle pieces, they were tender, juicy, and not at all chewy. Their marinara sauce is chunky with just the right amount of tang. My boyfriend got the Meat Lasagna, while I ordered the Spicy Italian Sausage Pasta. I love all of the options (and portions!) for their side salads. I really enjoyed the fresh vegetables in my pasta and was satisfied with the portion size. The only thing I was missing was a nice kick from the spicy sausage, which I had to dig for to find. My boyfriend's lasagna left something to be desired. At one point he said \"I thought I ordered a meat lasagna, but all I have are noodles with no filling\". He has been to Guillermo's several times and assured me it was probably an off day, as he's had great lasagna there plenty of times.I really enjoyed Guillermo's overall and plan to come back soon to try their sandwiches and pizza. I wish I could give half stars for reviews like these because while I don't think it's deserving of four stars, it's also not deserving of three either. Here's to hoping Guillermo's continues to win me over in the end."], ["Daniel H.", "There's never been an instance that I've disliked something or had a complaint/issue. Dining in? Great! Calling for an order to-go? Even better! Guillermo's food is absolutely delicious, my favourite is the Shrimp Scampi!"], ["Melanie K.", "This is a must try place.

Their prices have increased, and quality overall decreased. \u00a0Detailed below is my experience from last night:1) we sat at our table for 15 minutes before someone helped us (even though the hostess said she'd send someone over). In fact, we had to get the attention of a server and ask for menus. 2) The drinks are grossly overpriced. My friend ordered a whisky sour (it was well whisky, mind you), and it was a whopping $9.20!! I could go to the nicest bar in town and get a premium liquor cocktail for less than that! Even their wine is $10/glass. The glass of wine I ordered had gone bad, it was extremely sour. When I pointed that out they immediately opened a new bottle, but that shouldn't have happened in the first place. 3) There was a table of servers next to us who I guess had just gotten off work and would not stop bothering us. They interrupted our conversation multiple times. We could hear them debating coming to our table and asking for one of our numbers; one of them even followed us out when we walked to our cars (he was extremely creepy). As a girl, I felt extremely uncomfortable and would have left earlier if my guy friend wasn't there. It's completely inappropriate that the people working there were bothering us so much. That being said, the food was fine. However, not good enough for me to return and endure all of that again. I'd rather sit in the comfort of my home and order Domino's.

I picked up a phone order, and I can't wait to come back to dine in! This is a quaint restaurant with an adorable outdoor patio seating area. I've driven by many times without noticing the restaurant, so keep your eyes open for it!I ordered their house salad and a thin crust, 12\", five topping pizza. Prices seem fair, and comparable to other pizza restaurants I've visited in the city. The salad is great; topped with unique items like green olives and dried cranberries. The house dressing is delicious, a cream base, not oil. The thin crust is crispy and tasty. The toppings were good, I will ask for extra shrooms next time ;-) ...their sausage definitely has a unique flavor, nicely crumbled and a little crispy. I couldn't resist trying one of their teas (they have a variety of flavors), peach mango was oh so delish. A little sweet at first, but mellowed after a few sips. Everyone at the restaurant was helpful and friendly. The only drawbacks tonight was the website menu link didn't work (made it hard to order) and the phone was busy when I called, then I waited on hold for five minutes. Nothing to whine about, I've got patience for good food. I will be back...eager to try the infamous pasta salad."], ["Michael G.", "Had the Tuna de gallo and the meat lasagna.

The dessert shared were the Tiramisu and Vanilla Brandied cake (like a Italian Tres Leces). It was good but not great. Service was okay had a very young male waiter that was clearing plates as we dined through our courses but the tight tables made it awkward (FYI need bigger tables). I had a Restaurant.com coupon that I wanted to redeem using the mobile app but the young female manager refused to accept it because she wanted a printed copy. No fine print stated such a thing and made what could have been a wonderful dining experience very sour. She offered 10% versus the voucher worth 25% off.

Three people made eye contact with us and said nothing. We decided to just choose a place to sit until we could find someone with a menu. A nice gentleman greeted us a minute later with menus and fresh bread for the table. He took our drink order and returned a moment later for our dinner order. The bread was light, buttered and quite tasty. I was the only one to have a side salad with dinner. I opted for the Italian house salad, and it was delightful!

We all opted for parmesan, and the server returned with a shaker that you typically find at Pizza Hut. We were expecting fresh parmesan. Needless to say, no one touched the shaker. I enjoyed the crust of the chicken, which was complimented nicely by the butter sauce and capers. The linguine was al dente. My husband and son, though, did not enjoy their meals. My husband commented that the chicken was good, but the red sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce-in-a-can. His spaghetti was overcooked as well. My son commented that the Meatballs had no substance and fell apart when touched. His spaghetti was also overcooked. He had difficulty gathering it on his fork due to the pasta being too tender. He agreed with my husband that the sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee. \u00a0We were overall not impressed with the food, and the atmosphere was ruined by the night's much-too-loud entertainment. \u00a0I could not speak to my husband next to me or son across from me without repeating myself or raising my voice above a reasonable level.

I love this sleek very cool successful business person hangout. When you walk in, you'd probably think it was a realtor luncheon or something. Men are all wearing suits and ties and women are dressed to kill.Once you can get past all the beautiful people though, this place always gets me salivating. Practically everything I've ever tried here has ranged from good to outstanding. But I'll try not to get ahead of myself. The wait times are reasonable even during the busier times I've come.The wait staff has always been very knowledgeable and their recommendations usually showcase their familiarity with each dish. I have tried various chicken and shrimp plates and each dish is distinct, packed with a punch and all around EVERYTHING you're missing out on when you choose to go to Olive Garden or Zio's over this place.They start you off with \"classy\" H20 from their glass bottles and hook you up with complimentary bread and olive oil with spices. This part of the experience is very familiar to you by now assuming you eat Italian food like most people. On the other hand, if you've never had the Charcuterie & Cheese Board, it is delicious. If you've never even heard of that before or know what it is, it's all the more reason why you need to order it. The menu description does not do it justice. It would be like if you read that a Ferrari were a \"red car\". Not acceptable.Moving onto the entrees, I've sampled quite a bit over the past few years and some of my favorites are the Farfalle which has sun dried tomatoes that are divine. The creamy sauce that comes with this dish puts your mouth at ease but the first bite into one of the sun dried tomatoes is like Emerald screaming \"BAM\" to your taste buds. I also really enjoyed the Rigatoni partially b/c I'm biased and love rigatoni but mostly because the sausage, tomatoes and goat cheese are too harmonious to deny very often. Lastly, I remember really liking their Brussels sprouts as a side. Yeah, that's right. I said it. And if you still think like your 7 year old self about how \"gross\" they are, this is another one you need to sample to believe.All in all, this Italian spot is one of my favorites not only to people watch but more importantly to fully indulge my senses into the work they put into these dishes. The vibe is very nice although it can be just a tad bit stuffy/pretentious depending on when you go and severs usually give great service. Thank you Piatti for being my favorite restaurant in the Quarry and for being on of the best Italian restaurants in SA. P.S. I'm not sure why there are so many haters of this place..."], ["Nancy L.", "My server, Jose, was awesome! The food n' cocktails were delicious and excellent customer service! I had to give 2 stars because the general manager (GM), Dan, was slamming plates over the countertop while yelling at my server in front of the customers!! Everybody turned around to see what the commotion was. It took me by surprise how the GM was down-right rude, disrespectful, hot-headed and inappropriate towards his servers...I can't imagine how he would treat people when customers are not around! If there's a problem, talk in private...not yell and slam plates during peak hours of dining! Somebody should counsel the GM...he came across as arrogant and rude. Disgusted by the whole scene...turnover rate is probably high there"], ["Z F.", "Chicken Alfredo never disappointing. \u00a0Always my choice got Italian when in San Antonio!! The atmosphere is so real as well, love the quarry!!!"], ["Britania D.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I usually go when it's most packed so we tend to sit outside so we can enjoy a little bit of quietness. Service- the best! Our servers have always been so attentive!! Never rude! Food- the complimentary bread and olive oil they give you is excellent. I've tried numerous of things here but I usually order the same thing. If you like calamari, order it! It's so fresh! To the point that you can tell exactly what you're eating! The little squids were kind of adorable... I highly recommend their spinach ricotta ravioli! It is sooooooo good! I rarely finish my entire plate at restaurants and I sometimes do here! Oops!Peach tea is really good! My fianc\u00e9 loves loves the Rigatoni with the sweet fennel sausage! It's actually really good. The best part is that it's very affordable!"], ["Nancy N.", "I love Piatti's. While i was in college I held birthday dinners here for myself and friends many, many times. The food is good and the atmosphere is wonderful. Service at this Piatti's is really wonderful. I've never had a problem with the waiters. They are attentive but not too pushy. Even though I have been coming here for many years I see the same waiters over and over. This tells me that Piatti's must be a good place to work at. The employees seem happy so therefore the customers are happy. Now the food. The meal starts with bread and olive oil, literally an Italian restaurant can be judged solely on these two essential things. And Piatti's has the one of the best bread and olive oil combinations. The bread is thick and (usually) served warm. It is deliciously chewy and pairs well with the olive oil (which has herbs and balsamic vinegar). Thankfully you can buy their olive oil blend. It is truly delicious. I think I've tried everything on the menu. Even the special menus. I remember a tomato dessert once that was inventive but really weird. But the other desserts, especially the chocolate cake is amazing! If you have time, get the s'mores. They bring a little fire and you roast your own s'mores at your table. It always causes everyone to ooh and ahh. All the other diners will look jealously at your table. Sometimes in the winter, I will come to Piatti's just for an Americano and the s'mores. So delicious. The pizzas are also very good. I like the Italian sausage and margherita. They are somewhat large so you can share them but they heat up nicely and also taste great cold. My favorite pasta is the Alfredo farfalle. It is a little rich so I usually get the smaller portion (which is plenty anyway). The gnocchi is also a great option as is the ravioli and seafood linguini (Fruta de mare). If you are not looking for pasta, I would get the pollo Marsala or pollo arrosto. Both are perfectly cooked and seasoned. If you want a salad- the house salad is amazing. It has a ton of ingredients and is filling on its own. The lettuce is very fresh. My favorite salad is the spinach with portobello. You can ask them to add meat like chicken or salmon if you want a more filling meal. If you come for lunch, you have to get the fries. These are my favorite fries of all time. They are thinly cut, seasoned (with herbs and pepper) and sprinkled with cheese. So delicious. I will say this location is much more established than the Eilan location. The food tastes better here to me. Probably because it also has wonderful memories. The waiters seem more attentive and the customers are generally older than the ones at Eilan. So if you are looking for a nice, quiet dinner at Piatti's I would go to the Quarry location and skip on Eilan."], ["Del P.", "Lunch with co-workers. Had the Lobster Cannelloni and spinach salad. Cannelloni was creamy and plenty of lobster. ( off course, very rich and was stuffed for lunch)Th spinach salad with portobello mushrooms and fried string onions was awesome:)"], ["Stephanie K.", "I had a delightful experience at Piatti last evening. \u00a0From the quiet, super polite server that ONLY eats SPAGHETTI, to the refreshing Moscow Mule, Perfect Ceasar Salad and SUPER Seafoody Fruta De Mare with the Piatti label Chardonnay. \u00a0The only thing that could have made it better was sharing with someone special instead of just me and my book.The Moscow Mule was refreshing, as stated, but could have been better with a little more lime and a copper mug. \u00a0But, I know copper mugs cost a fortune, as a result people steal them and the stainless one served the beverage in about as close to an authentic way as you can without copper.The Ceasar salad really was perfect. \u00a0The Garlic-Anchovy dressing was delightfully briney and with the wedge shaving of parmesan over the top, the dressing tossed croutons on the side of the romaine HEARTS (only) and the extra anchovy fillet to top it off.The Piatti label Chardonnay pairs PERFECTLY with the garlicy briney flavors of the Fruta De Mare. \u00a0The linguine has the right amount of bite left in it to combine well with the textures of the abundant clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp AND whitefish of this dish. \u00a0Don't be deterred by the lobster brodo being the \"sauce\" for this pasta dish, there is no lack of richness or flavor here!"], ["Bridget Y.", "I really adore Piatti's. The menu displays exceptional flavor pairings, and the wine list is equally impressive. The service is consistently good. I consistently choose to take friends, as the overall quality of dining experience is superb.I also highly recommend Piatti for events and large parties. If you make a reservation for an event, they will personalize the menus. Twice, I have met with their catering personnel and planned very elegant birthday dinners- I selected the menu, table set up, linen colors and flower arrangements. They also have a family style option, which offers a slightly lower price."], ["Dave H.", "The kitchen has become a model of inefficiency as well as the bar. \u00a0The slowest service we have had in San Antonio in years. Got here at 7pm and it took 20 minutes for simple beer and wine and 50 minutes for our salads to come out. And there were many empty tables. It just didn't make sense. They brought three pieces of bread and never asked if we wanted more during our extended wait for salad. \u00a0The entries finally came about an hour and 10 minutes into this very slow meal. \u00a0Once I finally got the chicken penne with pesto it was good. \u00a0With so many other Italian choices in San Antonio it will be a while before I agree to go back to Piatti."], ["Ryan B.", "I thought I was going to have to break the bank to eat the quality of food and experience the ambiance of Piatti, but wow was I wrong! Piatti provided fantastic and attentive service and delicious creative entrees all at very reasonable prices.In particular, I'd recommend their gnocchi with pork meatballs. They bring complementary ciabatta bread with flavored olive oil to the table. I could make a whole meal of this bread and olive oil. Their cocktails are the type you'd find at a speakeasy. For dessert, definitely order the s'mores--they give you all the fixings plus a little bowl of fire to cook with.The staff at Piatti were extremely accommodating the second time I came here with a group of 18 for a birthday. They customized our menus to wish my friend a happy birthday and brought out a big sparkler on the plate of s'mores for dessert. They were equally attentive when I went with just one other person. I'll definitely be back here."], ["Debbie K.", "Very nice place - upscale, trendy, yet comfortable. It seemed we were in the minority as far as first-timers to this restaurant. It was a little loud, but the quality of service, drinks & food easily made that endurable.They start you out with good bread and an amazing dipping sauce. Could have easily asked for more but didn't want to fill up on it. I got the Moscow mule, which was delicious. My husband got the cosmo noir because neither of us had heard of luxardo and wanted to try it. Also very delicious. My husband got the seafood stew and was saying \"umm\" with every bite. The juice at the bottom of the dish is the sort you would stab the waiter with your fork if he tried to take it away before you finished sopping it up with your bread!I decided to try something completely different and went with the fig pizza and I was not disappointed - it was a WOW!!! It was new, exciting, flavorful, and surprisingly not as sweet as I was worried it would be - a perfect summer menu item! Would definitely recommend this place with one caution: you'll have trouble deciding what to get because so many of the menu items are unique and sound delicious! We'll look forward to returning here anytime we're in the area!"], ["Alexis B.", "Very good Italian restaurant that is conveniently located in the Quarry. \u00a0They have delicious vegetarian options! \u00a0Appetizers: bruschetta, caprino forno (bake goat cheese crostini), and funghi griglia (grilled portobello msurhooms). \u00a0They also have creative salads, a Margherita pizza, and pastas. \u00a0They also have good desserts and fancy, delicious cocktails!"], ["Christine J.", "I've gone here twice. Once for dinner and once more recently for brunch. Both times I was disappointed in the food and especially at the price. When I went for brunch my butternut squash ravioli (4 of them for 12 dollars) were mediocre at best. They were kinda hard and just not filling for the price. The time before that I got a chicken dish which was rather bland. Again the price for that was ridiculous given the tiny portions. I wouldn't go back."], ["Ann H.", "the tagiatelle di zucchini is tdf and i haven't found anything like it at another restaurant. the sauce is the perfect balance of tomato-y and creamy and the zoodles are always on point. i wish i could replicate this at home! this dish is what will keep bringing me back to piatti no matter what! but based on previous visits, i'm now afraid to try anything else on the menu. nothing else has been that great... and the salmon is horrendous. worse than what i can make at home [and i'll be honest-- i'm no chef!]. the default for the salmon is medium well which is really more like well done, but the main problem is that they don't bother to ask how you'd like it cooked. ended up being dry and bland... ick.the last couple of times i've been at piatti, it seems like it's the go-to birthday celebration place. we saw at least 5 tables get dessert with a giant sparkler-like candle thing. the pyro in me would love to get one of those!note: make a reservation for a friday night or weekend night or prepare to wait!"], ["Rachel C.", "Amazing!

I also enjoyed the calamari, and the pieces were pretty big.for my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the half portion of the shaved zucchini tagliatelle, which was really good. I don't normally love noodles, so I was super excited that the zucchini would replace noodles and I could still enjoy the chicken and sauce included. the zucchini had a great texture, and stood up well to the sauce. I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a lighter meal. I also got a side of roasted Brussel sprouts which were enjoyable.we finished with the cheesecake and sorbet. the sorbet was delicious, light and flavorful.

New favorite place to relax! WOW! Highlight of my weekend! I'm in such shock over my experience that I can't speak in complete sentences.My daughter and I were looking for a lunch break in between running errands. I wasn't feeling so great so I stipulated we had to go to a restaurant where we would be seated and served. We stopped at the fancy Italian restaurant and I wondered if we would be up to par with the dress code. We were seated and I felt my whole body relax as the gentle music played, the natural light shone across the restaurant, and the servers moved about with smiles on their faces. Ahhh, heaven.We ordered (pasta for the kid, butternut squash and Bibb salad for me). My daughter got busy playing with her toys. She asked the server if it was ok that she was playing with Play doh. He assured her that was fine. Seconds later a plate of pizza dough appeared; the staff encouraged her to play!She proceeded to create a pizza (asking for ingredients one by one, truly testing the server's hospitality expertise). Eventually the pizza was taken to the kitchen to be baked. My daughter was elated and agreed that they should hire her to be their Pizza Artist.Chris, our server, was excellent--from the food recommendations to boxing up the hand crafted pizza to exceeding the expectations of a 5 year-old princess.Not only was our meal superb, but the whole experience was the highlight of our weekend. We felt pampered and appreciated. The biggest surprise was the bill. I said, \"OMG--this is how much I've been paying to eat at fast food restaurants!

Our waiter was attentive and fast.I also appreciate that this place takes reservations which I recommend if you are going for dinner on a Friday or Saturday evening.At times it can get rather noisy, especially near the bar but even the music inside often seems a bit too loud.

We were able to be full at the end of the night just on those two entrees. The merlot was OK - we were aware that the pairings didn't really work out, but my fiancee is a fan of merlots so we went with it anyway. \u00a0The wine was very one-dimensional, lacking complexity, but that was okay as it was still quite drinkable - what can you expect at $25/bottle?This leads me to my next tip, if you have never bought wine with dinner/lunch here before, while it may seem enticing to get the $6.50 glass of table wine, beware that the glasses at Piatti are generic (small) wine glasses so that it's actually about 6-8 glasses of wine/bottle depending on how much you pour into your glass usually.

I had to be in the area so I did some pre-yelping and saw this place was not far from where I needed to be (\"Cellular Zone\" up the street getting my wife's iPad Air screen replaced... excellent work by the way, at a good price). Dropped off what needed to be repaired and had a couple of hours to kill while the repaired (same-day service). So I headed in to the pizza place, it reminded me of back home in NY, a few tables with the paper napkins and condiments of hot pepper flakes, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper...... had to ask for the garlic powder though :) It's all about the pizza though, so I had to test the owner's claim of \"NY Style\" pizza. Many state it, but many come up short. Well, the kitchen is open view and the large silver pizza oven are familiar. I asked to try the staple slice of pepperoni, YES, pizza by the slice, awesome (no need to order a whole pie if you are alone! The owner took a slice and placed it in the oven to heat up (which is how it's done in pizza shops in the Northeast, so you can get your slices faster). When it was ready, he handed it to me on a paper plate. I was used to it being served on just wax paper back in NY, but the plate made the hot slice easy to handle. I could smell the goodness as I folded the thin crust slice in half and pointed it downward towards the plate to make see if a couple of drops of the signature reddish sauce-tainted oil would drip off. Yes, a couple of drops, not too much or too greasy, perfect. I took what is always the best bite, the first one... the tip of the triangle. This was indeed NY Style pizza, the crust has a very thin crispy layer right at the bottom and then the rest is perfectly chewy. The sauce and cheese are not overdone, just the right mix (when the pizza is this good, unlike the chains, you don't need extra cheese and thick crust to make up for the lack of overall taste). Also the end of the crust is small, maybe a half inch, the rest is covered with sauce and cheese. Great, because I ordered pizza, not bread... \u00a0like the crusts that you end up throwing away at most places :) So I ordered another slice and also a Calzone to take home for later (for myself and my wife). The calzone was also excellent (I asked him to double the pepperoni instead of including ham and pepperoni), Their Calzones INCLUDES Ricotta Cheese, you don't have to ask for it like other places! To me and the owner of this restaurant, it's NOT a calzone if it doesn't have Ricotta Cheese, that's part of the ingredients. It's just a \"Pizza Turnover\" without it! Unfortunately, this place is a bit far from our house in Alamo Ranch, but when I get the craving and have time, I will not hesitate to take the trip back. In my humble opinion (I was born and raised in NY until joining the military at the age of 20 for an active duty career) this is authentic New York Style Pizza from a family owned business owner (a hard working man born in Italy).If you call, don't expect him to read the entire menu to you over the phone. Someone called while I was there and asked the owner \"What do you have?\".... seriously? This is a pizza place, know what you want and order it, if he seems to not kiss you butt, it's because he won't, it's not that kind of place. Get over it and enjoy the food :) Thanks so much for the great food and great conversation."], ["Nancy N.", "I'm a deep dish, thick crust kind of girl. So when I found out that Sappore's had a thin crust, I was a little worried. But I went in anyway because Yelp told me to and I'm so glad I did. Sappore's sells whole pizzas and by the slice so I got pepperoni and I know this is weird but anchovies and olives (someone once asked if I was pregnant when I ordered this...). The owner was incredibly friendly. I saw the guy in the back pulling out the pizzas and putting on the toppings. It took awhile (maybe 7 mins) since they had to throw on toppings and heat it up. I got it to go so they put my enormous pizza slices on plates and put it in a bag. I wish I had gotten a box but I think a box would have made the pizza less crispy.I took a bite of the anchovy pizza and was instantly smitten. The flavors were so on point! The crust was thin but crispy. And the anchovies were used sparingly so it wasn't overly salty. I was really impressed. The pepperoni was also delicious but I wish it had more pepperoni. And more cheese (everything needs more cheese). I think in general, the toppings are sparse but the pizza dough and sauce are so good, I didn't mind too much.

The ingredients used here seem higher quality than other pizza places especially the cheese, sauce, and pepperoni. The base marinara/cheese of the pizza is more flavorful especially when comparing it to Grimaldis which is pretty flavorless. I think the center crust could be a tiny bit thicker and crispier when comparing this pizza to my favorite New York Style Pizza in San Diego, but that is really my only complaint with the pizza. I know it should be \u00a0pretty thin, but I'm not exactly sure if it's normally as thin as it is here. I'll have to go to NYC to figure that out I guess. The tira misu and cannolis here are also very tasty. I normally have to order a slice of tira misu with my pizza when I come here. It's just so good. I've had the cannolis here once and they are good, but I think the portion is really small for the price. I think it was about $5 for just one cannoli.

Sauce, bold and with unapologetic tomato zest. Cheese, a light dusting, adding stringy goodness to the pizza, along with salty notes. If it's not already apparent, I recently did takeout at Sapore's and was really impressed. The pizza is somewhere in between an authentic Italian pizza and NYC-style. Liked it a lot, and looking forward to the same quality at a variety of locations across Texas. My only criticisms of this place are two-fold. One, the spareness of the toppings aggravated me; ordered mushrooms on my pie, and found about three per slice (should be more). Two, the price is reasonable, but not the best value in my opinion. In particular, my regional favorite for pizza is Little Italy, which sells a 18\" with a topping for less money than Sapore's. Don't mean to get geeky on readers, but Little Italy pizza with one topping (and including tax) is $.053 per square inch, whereas Sapore's is $.074 per square inch.

The sauce was okay, but the mozzarella was pre-shredded and was chewily rubbery, the tomatoes were not complex at all and the basil was dried (though there may have been a bit of fresh basil..but not sure). Overall the flavor was just there. \u00a0It almost needed seasoning.Maybe this is the wrong pizza to get there so I will give it shot with meats again, where the saltiness of the meats may work better. \u00a0But for now, it will be a while before I venture there for the update."], ["LeeAnn I.", "Best pizza in San Antonio! \u00a0The crust & sauce MAKE the pizza awesome. \u00a0 The crust is thin & crispy. \u00a0The marinara sauce tasted fresh and bright. \u00a0We had the Salvatore which has Italian sausage, mushrooms, spinach and garlic and it had the most incredible flavor. \u00a0 We met Guiseppe, the owner, who is from Naples. \u00a0My husband, being of Italian descent and having lived in Italy, and Guiseppe reminisced about Italy, their mutual love of the North End in Boston. \u00a0He was warm and welcoming. \u00a0Being that this was a new place we were checking out, I did a google search for the health inspectors score and was thrilled to find out that not only do they score well but they have several Blue Plate awards. \u00a0They just got one last week! \u00a0 How great is that? \u00a0Amazing authentic pizza, great service, friendly owner and staff and its clean. \u00a0 I cant wait to go back for more."], ["Tamara B.", "Got two orders of to go peppi poppers.

Now, I don't mind paying for quality at all. I rarely visit the national pizza chains anymore despite their low prices. My first impression of the pizza was that it smelled \"metallic\". Sorta like a handful of coins. An aroma of sauce and toppings was not present. I ordered a pepperoni and green olive pizza. Now, despite all a lot of fellow reviewers saying this is the best pizza they ever had, I would suggest they keep shopping. I won't do this business a disservice by mentioning the other places here.

I was tiring of our regular pizza joint, the last couple pizza's we had had we not a good as normal so I jumped on the chance to try something new. Now... this place is a little out of the way for me but I happily and willingly fought traffic for it tonight and didn't give it a second thought. The owner is actually from Italy... not may places can claim that AND he is the one in the back preparing the food. This is very family friendly place, they clearly know a lot of their customers and enjoys tons of repeat business. \u00a0The pizza is WONDERFUL, I don't even know how to describe it, we ordered the ham the last two times we were there (I need to try something new next time) but it's actual shaved ham not those pressed Canadian bacon slices you get at most places. The veggies are super fresh, I am pretty sure our tomato was chopped up right before we ate it. Nice thin, crisp crust but still floppy enough to call it true pizza. The desert... oh my.... don't go here and walk out without a canolli. They are made here fresh... I can easily say it's the best I have ever had... lick the plate good. There was another dessert that we tried that had ricotta cheese and orange peel (I don't remember the name and it was \"off the menu\") but it was warm and wonderful too but it's the canolli that will have you not caring about the calories. The place is simple but clean... you can see directly into the kitchen from the counter and it's amazing how spotless it is back there.

First, I must start off that when I think of pizza I think of Little Italy on west ave and 46th street pizza on dezavala. These are my go to for the best intown. The decor was typical but who cares as your not eating the tablecloths. The pizza was thin and to my surprise crisp. I actually folded my pizza down the middle which I usually dont do. Its not easy to make a pizza that thin and still get that crunch. I give it a 7 out of 10 and will return to try a different flavor. I went with just cheese as I do every new pizza place I go to test out. If you are looking for a thin crispy crust pizza this is your place. I will be putting Sapore's pizza in my top three in town. It also helps that its only 2 miles from my house. I will go back and try the $2.50 espresso that a regular ordered. Its not on the menu so just ask for it. I posted the story of Sapore's pizza that they have on the back of the menu as I feel Its important when you go out to eat to support businesses for more than just the expensive corporate television advertising."], ["Renate N.", "First time here, we were greeted at the counter by a very friendly woman who asked if we had been there before, and then explained the menu to us. \u00a0Ordered a large pizza (half/half) and caesar salad. \u00a0Salad was great! \u00a0loved the dressing. \u00a0Pizza is a nice NY style thin crust with flavorful sauce, good proportions of toppings & cheese. \u00a0Only thing that would make it perfect is a wood-fired oven to brown the crust more. \u00a0Otherwise this place is close to home and not too expensive, so will be returning for sure."], ["Pramod D.", "I've given Sapore's two chances. I do not think I will be giving them a third.On my first visit I ordered pizza for pick-up. It was lackluster, none of the ingredients tasted like they were very high quality. The crust did not seem as if it were made in house, and had an unpleasant cardboard-like quality, and the sauce, which can make or break a pizza, tasted like it came out of a can. Compared to high quality, NY style pizza, this is a poor substitute, and compared to actual NYC pizza, its awful. There are far better options in San Antonio.The second visit we made to Sapore's, we decided to eat in. Probably a mistake, as this is clearly more suited to take-out and delivery. I didn't get upset about the 4-5 to-go orders that were filled before us, because there's a good chance they actually did order before us. But when another group is sat 20 minutes after you, and gets their food first, there's a problem.We had ordered a salad to share, pasta, and a calzone. I get that these three things take different amounts of time to make, which is fine, but please don't make us sit there with nothing when a salad takes, at most, 5 minutes to bring to the table. When we finally went to the counter to ask about our order, we were given the response that \"they were making fresh pasta\", which implies a couple of unpleasant things. The first is that they make pasta in bulk, and serve it as its ordered. Which would be fine if they were a high turnover pasta restaurant, but they're not. They serve mostly pizza, and perhaps serve 2-3 pasta orders an hour at most. So if you get your pasta quickly, it's been sitting around for an unspecified amount of time. And if they did need to make fresh pasta for an order, why only start it after your customer has been waiting 30 minutes?It was at that point we saw them put the calzone in the oven.When we asked how long it would be, the man behind the counter gave us the generic, \"oh maybe five more minutes or something like that\". He didn't even seem to believe it himself. So we asked for a refund and left.Before starting my career, I worked in restaurants for 10 years. Some mistakes are excusable, and some mistakes are the result of being a bad restaurant. The problems we encountered both times with Sapore's belong to the latter category."], ["Christina C.", "YUM!!! I've visited a couple times so far & both times I was very pleased. The pizza is really tasty & I really liked the new Peppi Poppers on the menu, basically a small pizza, but rolled up into little poppers, added jalape\u00f1os to some & the marinara dipping sauce was very good too. The greek salad was soooo good, I'll def order that every time! The dessert is soooo good! I've tried the cannoli's, which was my first time ever trying this dessert & it was DELISH!!!! The new chocolate chip pizza cookie with chocolate ice cream- DON'T THREATEN ME WITH A GOOD TIME!!! Haha!! The perfect ending to dinner!

I was looking for authentic New York style pizza and this place as class as it's going to get in San Antonio. The crust is fabulous. Very thin and crispy. Homeslice in Austin is still the gold standard for me because it just seems a tad better somehow. It's something about the sauce that I can't pinpoint. But I don't have time to go to Austin everytime a pizza craving hits so this place is awesome. If you are looking for NY style pizza, come here. If you want authentic Italian, go to Dough or Barbaro.

Their salad is also bizarrely amazing. Not bizarre because it's weird, but because it's just salad. Like, how could it be so special? I think it has something to do with the red onions and the perfect lettuce blend and the squishy croutons (sounds weird, I know!).

The caesar dressing was extremely watery, and not good at all. The croutons in the salad were supposed to be house made, but they were soft and not crispy so they were basically just pieces of bread in your salad. They immediately got soggy after pouring the dressing over it. I don't understand why they'd serve a salad like that, but whatever. The pizza was delicious and was a good size for being personal. The crust was just the right amount of crispy, and the sauce tasted amazing! The cheese and the pepperoni's were also amazing.

For the price of our meal, I believe that Main Street is well worth the food. I still need to try a pizza.

Another favorite is pepperoni-mushroom, veggie supreme, and their meaty pizza- all are huge pies with huge thin-crust slices. On a really bad (read: super hungry with no regard for caloric content) day, I'll scarf down three, but two is plenty.

I'm a weekly regular at this pizza joint, and I can't say I've ever had a bad pizza. They make all of their sauces in house and you can taste it.

The pizza has been consistently good for at least the 8 or 9 years I've been rocking Main Street. I've honestly never had any of the pasta dishes, but never had a real desire, as I can make a pasta with marinara dish myself pretty easily, and wifey makes great meatballs. The pizza is what brings me back when I want something good and something quickly, especially if we have company or something like that. Never had a single complaint about the service. Keep in mind, this isn't Dough or some other kind of high-falootin' fancy place. It's simple pizza done well every time."], ["Carlos G.", "This place is okay if you want pizza and are near downtown.

The first time I had chicken Parmesan w/ cappelini marinara, salad and foccacia bread. The food was.... bland, the chicken dry (like a previously frozen patty, heated and left for way to long on the back burner) and the marinara sauce taste like right out of the jar. Skipped this place for a while, till today. I had the same experience - it tasted just like ready to heat frozen food from Costco or Sysco alike. I don't think that beside salads they actually prepare anything \"homemade\" there. The food is cheap, yes. \u00a0The place is always crowded because the San Antonio College is nearby.

Everything is at a great price for the amount you get. I always get a salad when I go. The just enough of an appetizer that you wont be full by the time you get your meal. They have tons of options for you if you don't want pizza. My favorite is spaghetti and meatballs. If you don't feel like pizza they have other options. Anything from calzones and meatball subs to salads and pasta. The best thing is that they give student discounts. Their lunch specials are really cheap and you can grab it to go. I highly recommend checking this out if you're new to the Universities around.

I have been there twice (including today) and enjoyed my food and atmosphere both times. It is a big small and seems to fill up at lunch time.

I have coworkers that drive to Fratello's for the sandwiches from the southwest corner of the city during lunch...it's that important. I'm a mushroom freak. They have a mushroom pizza on the menu. If they won't sprinkle my ashes in Venice, I'll settle for the parking lot of Fratello's. The sauce is thin and flavorful, the crust is delicious, not too thick at the edges, and just as thin and delicious in the middle as I have enjoyed in Italy. Add the fresh mozzarella, not too much, and saut\u00e9ed shrooms, and I am looking at my last meal on Earth. The service is great! Dine in, carry out, you choose!

Once inside, the menu is written on signs similar to chalkboards. It's fairly simple, with not many options, but very good basics. It's also in italian, so there's some surprise when you see it. But, the description is also on the board and is in English. I tried the bolognese and my husband the spaghetti and meatballs. It's a seat and serve yourself type restaurant, but they deliver the food to you via a table number display. It is definitely not the TexItalian you see at chain restaurants. I was very impressed by the freshness and flavor, along with the presentation of the food. The flavor is subtle with basil, but the sauce and cheese on top doesn't overpower the meal. A small piece of bread also comes along with the meal, so it's a nice touch. I would absolutely love to come back since the paninis have such great reviews.

They use only the freshest, traditional Italian ingredients. The crust is nice and thin without being burnt, it isn't overwhelmed with cheese, and the sauce tastes like it has been simmering all day. Yum! And the meats are perfection. You can even take home pounds of their awesome salami. My first time, I did have the vegetarian panini...while good, it didn't blow me away like the pizza did.

That being said, the SANDWICHES. The deli gods must be smiling because the sandwiches are excellent. Specifically, the Lombardo. Just order the Lombardo and be done with it. Your mouth will thank you once it is done chewing. In truth, everyone I've fed the Lombardo rarely strays from its guaranteed awesomeness. I've never even tried a pizza and I've been here 10+ times (and trust me, I'm a try the menu type). Also, spring for a dessert. Unlike many restaurants, the desserts are not an afterthought. In fact, just order the three layered chocolate moose. We usually skip the added cost at other restaurants, but the Lombardo sandwich and a dessert feeds two of us lunch for $15. (Ticked off one star because the service can be hit or miss. It is fast, just not always polite/professional. This is usually a HUGE pet peeve of ours because the Boy is in food service but we decided as long as we're eating the Lombardo, we don't care.)"], ["Eugene L.", "There aren't too many authentic and independent Italian delis/restaurants in S.A. however Fratello's is the closest we can get. \u00a0Housed in a building that once occupied a Bonanza steakhouse from a decade ago, the service is friendly and fast. \u00a0Whatever you like whether it's pizza,paninis or pasta they serve it. \u00a0I got the muffaletta. \u00a0It wasn't the worst but it's far from the best. \u00a0I've had an authentic muffaletta at Central Grocery when I visited New Orleans once in 2008. \u00a0It was okay however I'm more partial to the muffalettas served at Jason's Deli and Ragin Cajun in Houston,TX. \u00a0The muffaletta was served on a baguette roll instead of the round seeded Italian bread. \u00a0And I didn't care much for their house made potato chips served on the side. \u00a0Since I gave up sweets for Lent I had to turn down dessert but next time I return I'll get a cannoli."], ["Michelle V.", "The food was good, but not so good that I didn't mind being late from lunch. \u00a0Going at lunch time spoiled the experience. \u00a0I took an early lunch to beat the crowd, got there at 11:10 am, we only had two couples before us and our order still took 45 minutes to be served. \u00a0I ordered the lunch special soup and half a sandwich, it should not have taken that long. \u00a0Additionally I was not the only unhappy patron. \u00a0The guy sitting next to me waited 30 minutes for his sandwich, and he was served the wrong order, so he had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the right order.

I rushed in starving for just about anything after a long meeting, and was bummed to realize I had missed their lunch (they only serve the lunch menu in its entirety until 2, I think), but the sweet girl at the register let me know I could still order pizza, which was honestly what I wanted to try anyway. The salumi was so authentic tasting. Thick sliced, a tad oily, and added wonderful saltiness to the other items on the pie - smoked mozzarella, italian sausage, and pepperoni (I think). I paired it with a caesar salad with clearly homemade dressing and croutons. Small details that make a big difference! I threw in a couple of cannoli with a really amazing pastry crust. It was sturdy but flaky and just sweet enough. I thought the filling was underwhelming and could use a little more pizazz. All in all, the sweet staff combined with a hot pizza ready in less than seven minutes, and this place has my attention!"], ["Nick A.", "Stopped in for dinner with my better half.

It was great. Very fresh and bright, the bread was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft inside. It's a big sandwich, but I had no problem wolfing it down.The building is brand new and they did a great job. The decor is quaint and very well put together. High, open, wooden ceilings give it a rustic feel with the backdrop of the imported Italian goods on the far side of the dining area tying it all together.

Panzanella was not even 5 minutes from our hotel right on the River Walk and seemed to have great reviews. Needless to say, we were excited for what we anticipated would be a good Texas Pie. The hostess took our order easy enough, a pie split 50/50 between The Longhorn (Pepperoni/Bacon) and The Texan (Meatball). The service was very modern using an iPad and Square...seems simple enough? We paid for our pie and asked for a quick pair of table waters...Our first mistake. The waitress replied \"no problem\" so my other half went to get us a table while I waited at the counter. The hostess then proceeded to take the order of the next customers. No problem I thought, they were the only other couple in the place and pizza takes a while so I had no problem waiting. However after about 5 minutes, she then stared at me with the \"CAN I HELP YOU?!\" glare. I kindly reminded her about the water, she apologized and I went outside still happily anticipating our pie. Average pizza time goes by, about 10 minutes - and our hostess brings out our pizza. It actually looks pretty good! Unfortunately, as she's placing it down, she knocks it over and scalding hot pizza goes all over my leg and shorts. She then dashes away, leaving pizza all over both myself and the floor and the rest of the restaurant staring at us. She comes back with a trash can and napkins to clean it up, but never any mention of any apology or what would happen next. Finally after she cleans everything up, and I've been sitting outside for another 10 minutes we go back in to see if they're making us another pie or what's going on, as at this point still no peep from the hostess. As I'm a bit over everything at this point, my other half is kind enough to go inside and check. The hostess then merely says \"oh yeah!\" And attempts to hand a piping hot plate of metal pizza tray to her. I guess it was too much to ask for them to bring it back out. So finally, we have pizza in hand... And after all that it was completely mediocre. Soggy pie, bland meatballs, and burnt bacon.

The dough was perfect. Fluffy on the edges and crispy at the bottom. Finished out meal off with their tiramisu. Hands down the best tiramisu I've ever had. Craving it right now!!

Think Christmas lights crisscrossing the parking lot, a bike rental station nearby, a group of cyclists gathering at the nearby brewery entrance, and Green, a vegetarian restaurant, right next door. The restaurant itself has an open kitchen near the waiting area, a restroom on the second floor which can be accessed by elevator, and a dimmed dining atmosphere. My colleague recommended Il Sogno because a vegetarian friend of his said there were plenty of vegetarian options. Following that recommendation, I went with a group on a weekday night. The vegetarian promise didn't really come true. Nearly every dish had meat in it. However, the server was very helpful when it came to deciding on a salad and adjusting a pasta dish to be vegetarian. The salad (del campo, which the internet is telling me means from the field) was great, but wasn't for a single person. You could probably share it with a few folks. It was this excellent of avocados, spinach, sweet bell peppers, cheese, candied pecans, topped with cheese and a light oil dressing. The dressing was light, but too abundant: by the sixth bite, I was regretting not asking for the dressing on the side. It was kind of like a salad burrito, for what it's worth (see the picture). The pasta was excellent too. It was nice and al dente, with a sauce that wasn't too rich, but still very flavorful. Mushrooms (oyster, maybe?) and spinach complimented the pasta well.For a moment there, the difference between walnuts and pecans had me confused. \u00a0One gripe I had with Il Sogno (other than it's spelled with an i and an l but you can't tell on Yelp because of the font) was that it took forever to get our food. We entered and were seated at 7 PM, but didn't get our entrees until 8:35 PM. We definitely had our entrees ordered by 7:15 PM. It's kind of hilarious because one of the chicken dishes says, \"Allow for forty minutes to cook this dish,\" on the menu, and while in the restroom, while discussing how long the food was taking to come out, a stranger laughed and said, \"Everything here takes at least that long, so I don't know why they put the warning on the chicken.\" I actually asked about the food about an hour in, and the server reassured me that food was being cooked. I'd come back, but only if I had time on my hands and was craving a more substantial Italian meal."], ["Courtney H.", "One of my top 2 favorite place in town.

I was a bit under-whelmed. I have heard wonderful things about this restaurant from others and was quite frankly looking forward to an incredible brunch. It just really wasn't the case. I ordered the spicy shrimp and polenta with a side of potatoes (they are known to have some incredible crispy potatoes). My shrimp tasted and smelled very, very fishy. I understand shrimp is seafood and all, but I've never tasted it so bad before. I wanted to love my food like everyone else did, but I just couldn't. The polenta was very tasty and my blackberry mimosa was too die for! The potatoes also were small and dissatisfying, as if they were scraped from the bottom of the fryer. The service was on spot, even though we were a huge crowd of about 20, she attended to our every need. I'm not quite sure if I'll be back for brunch, but I would still love to try the rest of their menu one day."], ["Julie G.", "Breakfast review:Who knew Il Sogno served breakfast?! I found out from all of Nick A.'s yummy photos. We popped in around 8am on a Friday and were seated right away by the wonderful Arturo. Arturo, our ever so wonderful server, pulled out our seats for us and came over with a tray of fresh fruit to add to our water. He took his time covering their breakfast specials and explaining things on the menu. I went with their prosciutto omelette special(served with toast/bacon/fried potatoes) and my sister went with their popular avocado toast. Their french toast is an absolute must too! For breakfast, every table is decorated with trays of brown sugar, butter, jelly, and your own jar of Nutella(not kidding!). The blueberry or some type of berry jelly was tasty and it paired perfectly with their made in house toast. The potatoes were crispy and cooked to perfection with such great flavor, the bacon was nice and hearty(just the way I like it), and the omelette was completely stuffed with a generous amount of prosciutto. The egg and prosciutto pairing was new to me but I loved every bit of it, you could taste all the love put into making it, no salt was necessary. The avocado toast was delicious and a much lighter option than what I had ordered. Everything served here is of high quality and the portions are enormous making you do a double take at the prices on the menu. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and Il Sogno Osteria really made my day by sending me off with a happy tummy! Prices range from $7-$16, all worth every penny!"], ["Gregorio P.", "Arrived at 11am sharp to grab an early lunch. Doors were locked, but a nice hostess offered a seat inside where it was much cooler, points there.At 11:30, got a table, but the host at the time wasn't very friendly. Almost made it seem as though since we didn't have a reservation, we may not be allowed to eat.At the table...our waiter was a little into himself. He had his hair slicked back and t was a little nappy-looking. His attitude was almost as, \"you're welcome for sitting at my table\" type of feeling he rubbed off. He wasn't very approachable and forgot half of the things I asked for. I asked for a specific bottle of wine, he brought me something else, opened it up, I said, \"this isn't the bottle we wanted.\" He said, \" this bottle is better and more expensive...but I'll give it to you at the other price.\" At first I was somewhat open to that...then he poured the taste...nasty, bitter & very tart Pinot Grigio. I wasn't in the mood to argue as I was with company of high importance in the community...so I just accepted and we continued on. His suggestions of the menu were not knowledgable. He couldn't explain the menu very well or the flavors/aromas. He was almost too busy to stop by and really take care of us. However the table of scantily clad ladies next to us seemed to get more attention. I was a little jealous. I want that kind of attention from my wait staff. I spent $150 for a lunch, they got salads. Seriously? Good comes out and shrimp salad looked unfulfilling for my guest. My linguine and clam entree left a lot to be desired. It wasn't very flavorful from what I was expecting. Pasta didn't taste fresh. Clams were overlooked & some other noodles snuck their way in to my bowl. It felt like an Italian Pho and it wasn't very appealing. The onion didn't belong in that dish either. I've been to Italy and have tasted the best Italian from North to South on my travels and this place missed the mark on taste and authenticity. I felt like I was in an overpriced pizzeria with a kitchen feel. This place definitely caters to the pockets of the people(and politicians) in this area. It doesn't fool me. There's too many Italians in the area that know their roots. The atmosphere is modern kitchen artsy fartsy. Small restaurant about 20 covers. What made the visit less appealing was that the waiter for the table next to us was very friendly and helpful to the guests around us. Next time I'll request him...if I return."], ["Cathy S.", "If you're ever craving Italian, this is the place to go! I would call ahead to make a reservation as it seems to be a really popular place. After waiting around an hour for a table, we were seated and pretty much had one of the best dining experiences I've ever experienced. Our waiter, John, was extremely kind and knowledgeable about the menu. We started off with the meatball appetizer. Each meatball was made from scratch and the sauce was cheese and tomato base. Each meatball was quite large which surprised me because I'm always expecting something small. Then because \u00a0of our long wait, we got complementary antipasto and an arugula salad. The roasted bell peppers antipasto one was my favorite! For entr\u00e9es I ordered the Lardo pizza without the lard lol. I think the quality of pizza is better than Barbaro's pizza, but not as good as dough's pizza if that gives you an idea of how it tasted. We also ordered the risotto which was freaking fantastic. I pretty much ate off my dates plate cause it was so yummy. I want to learn to make it myself! To finish it all off they gave us a complementary Nutella cake dessert with macaroons and ice cream. The dessert was so rich I loved it!This place is simply amazing.

It looks like a square, dense piece of cornbread, but is crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside with a flavor explosion of garlic & butter. The cannelini bean paste with fresh parsley & olive oil on top....SO delicious! We tore through two magnificent plates of it. I had the linguini with clams in a white wine bacon sauce. AH-mazing! They were very generous with the clams, no grit or sand. The sauce was out of this world...I sopped it up with a biscuit (errr, rather aforementioned heavenly bread). My only complaint is I felt that there wasn't enough pasta. Plenty of the other dish components, but very little pasta to soak up all that flavor/sauce.I tasted the pea risotto...YUM....the special of the day, swordfish, YUM....For dessert, the iced coffee drink starting with an \"s\" is a MUST...sorry can't remember the name...but it's two shots of expresso & condensed milk.

There are many better options."], ["Melissa M.", "My fianc\u00e9 was heading back to California and we wanted to go somewhere nice for dinner before he left. I've never been to The Pearl before, so I thought it would be nice if we could try one of the restaurants there. We decided on Il Sogno and booked a reservation the day of in the morning for a Friday. They only had a 6pm spot left so we took it. I'd definitely make reservations. They weren't taking any walk-ins at the time.We had a great experience at Il Sogno. The service was great and the ambience was relaxing. It's nice to go to a very popular restaurant and still be able to hear each other talk. NOW for the FOOD...Our waiter told us pretty much everything is made from scratch, pastas and bread etc. First we were served focaccia-olive bread with some kind of dip with tapenade. It was excellent! I only wish there was more. It definitely tasted freshly made. For main courses we ordered the Handkerchief Pasta with veggies in a lemon butter sauce, the filet mignon, and the wine braised short ribs. Handkerchief Pasta ($22)- I GIVE this a 5/5! My favorite of the three. The pasta was definitely freshly made. It was cooked well and so were the veggies which consisted of eggplant, asparagus and few other things. The lemon butter sauce was super tasty. I liked how light and flavorful this dish was. My ADVICE: If I went back again I'd stick with ordering the pastas or anything with bread/cheese. It's definitely what they are best at. I think these dishes are also more creative. I saw a few people ordering pizza and they looked yummy!Braised short ribs ($33ish)- For what it was, it was executed well. The ribs were really tender and the sauce was good. The veggies were cooked well and it came with mash potatoes. However, the dish was pretty traditional American and lacked creativity. Filet mignon ($35ish)- This was also cooked well and came with a flavorful sauce. The meat came with carrots, string beans, and mashed potatoes which were all good but not very creative or extraordinary. Tiramisu- This was pretty tasty but not the best I've had. It looked handmade and tasted fresh, but the coffee with the dark chocolate made the flavor of the tiramisu a bit strong for me. I prefer a milder tiramisu.As for the prices, I thought they were relatively reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. The pastas ranged from about $22-$30 and the meat/steak dishes were mostly around $35. I've \u00a0been to restaurants that charged $40-50 for filet mignon. Oh and the PORTION sizes are pretty HUGE compared to other \"fancy\" restaurants I've been to.Overall, I would definitely come back again, but I'm going to stick with the pasta dishes, cheese, and bread next time.

(Management: I didn't get his name, but he's the one with the distinctive voice that's somewhere between Johnny Cash and the Godfather. Please commend him on our behalf.)The food was sublime. Half of our party ordered the pan seared scallops special - sumptuous and cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the salmon, and would order it again - if I hadn't tasted the pasta. Delicious.

They aren't just pasta and linguini at II Sogno. I had one of the best hand made linguini with clams I've ever tasted here! It reminded me of my mom's cooking. Silly I know. My mom only cooks Chinese hand made noodles. But didn't you hear the Italians learned cooking from the Chinese? OK OK, whatever you say. My point is that it was THAT good! The ambiance was lovely and you know I always enjoy dressing up for a nice lunch/brunch. My friend had a meatball pasta and i tasted some. It was pretty good too. But still, I LOVE my linguini with clams, bacon, and peperonata in white wine and parmesan broth. Heavenly! We shared antipasti (only $10 for 3 items), it was good but not as impressive as my linguini. The complimentary bread was awesome too. And let's not forget about the fancy water (see pic).

Let not mention that the idea of having people dine next to and all over my soon to be consumed cheese was a bit of a turnoff. We started off with The cheese plate, yes! Totally yes! Then again, I'm a sucker for cheese. Our order of calamari arrived.....over breaded, over cooked and unseasoned, it was clear Andrew wasn't in house. No dish has ever left his kitchen under his watch without being seasoned properly.

I ordered a glass of Ros\u00e9, waiter ? Waiter ? Manager ? Bueller!!? So while my wine arrived I couldn't help to notice that the wine was sitting on the floor, what's up with wines on the floor? When did that become trendy? Why is it trendy? The dinning room is small, the tables are to close together, did I mention that waste of space called the antipasto bar?

Although it neither defines nor represents Texas cuisine, Il Sogno is well worth the visit and money for anyone who appreciates good (really good) Italian food.I used to think that all Italian restaurants are pretty much the same in regards to the diversity of dishes offered; \u00a0pasta is pasta is pasta with a finite combinations of noodles and sauces. A cuisine that prides itself in tradition and judges a good meal based on its propensity to evoke nostalgia for grandma's cooking, can impede room for change and innovation in the food. That being said, Il Sogno has found the perfect medium in giving a modern twist to traditional ingredients.DO start the meal with an antipasto. I opted for a trio of eggplant and lemon caviar, \u00a0prosciutto with figs, and goat cheese under olives. The goat cheese which is usually pungent was truly amazing when savored with some crostini. GET any of the in season roasted meat/game they're offering. We tried the braised short ribs and pappardelle, roasted pork and gnocchi. These were mind blowing good! Meat was falling off the bones tender, seasoned to perfection, and complimented by seasonal veggies and/or house made pastas. TRY anything with goat cheese, either an antipasto or ravioli, you will not regret it. I got an antipasto and shared three entrees and dessert with three other people, my bill came to $74/person, not including tip. Yes, it is pricey, so treat yourself for a special occasion and indulge.  Although the food was close to perfection, I do want comment on the dining experience. For an upscale restaurant, I appreciate the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff. I could however, do without their arrogance and snobbery. I've always associated food with sharing and a sense of gathering of sorts, always inclusive. No matter how expensive or refined a restaurant is, the dining experience should never exude a feeling of exclusivity. If you could change one thing, please fix some of your staff's attitude towards other fellow human beings."], ["Chet N.", "For visitors to San Antonio or regulars from the Pearl area, Il sogno is not to be missed. We visit on a regular basis and enjoy the authentic Italian Cuisine and the antipasti bar. Always be sure to call ahead for a reservation as you'll never get a table at the last minute. Regulars know that the food is always excellent and the service very good. For starters the calamari is tasty and we always let the server pick three from the ever-changing selection of appetizers at the bar. Our main staples are the Pizza, the risotto, roasted chicken and the sometimes offered branzino trout. Pasta items are all excellent and the pressed Italian coffee must be lingered over! \u00a0We spend lots of time there going back frequently. Occasionally the waitstaff is a touch slow and overworked \u00a0but we support them just the same as they work hard. Enjoy your visit !"], ["Kenny P.", "Dinner last night. Love the wild boar.

They stop serving breakfast at 10:30am, we arrived at 10:15am, so we cut it close. The breakfast of spicy coddled eggs, creamy polenta and potatoes with cheese was delicious. We drank Mimosa's, which were good. We recommend this restaurant, for those who don't mind spending a few extra pesos, for a higher quality experience. Thanks for reading.

You pay for it but it is memorable and worth it.I don't think you can go wrong here. We had \u00a0a lot of food (too much!). If I have one criticism the server could have told me I over-ordered. But that's ok. I got to try more!The food!Appetizers:Brussel sprouts- Fantastic. Shredded like a salad and delicious.I read about a ravioli filled with a runny egg. The server said it was off the menu. The chef overheard the conversation and made it! Great fusion of flavors, served over greens that are dressed great.Mushroom pizza- Wish I could have this on a regular basis. Great crust, \u00a0generous topping of assorted mushrooms and perfect balance of cheese.Entrees:Roast Chicken- It's a half chicken that it cooked to perfection. \u00a0You can't prepare chicken much better. Great mashed potatoes with it as well.Cavatelli- \u00a0All pasta is prepared fresh. This dish was served with a light creme based sauce and fresh vegetables. Nicely plated and tasted even better.As I mentioned, we sat my the open kitchen. They run it flawlessly. Between the server and kitchen, courses arrive at the right time. You get to enjoy your food and you are not rushed. The kitchen is calm. No theatre. Just great food. \u00a0This place would rival the best I have had in NYC. That's big.

If you watch \"Top Chef\" and are familiar with \"Restaurant Wars\", you can see this as a complete fail. \u00a0We should have been warned when a waiter from another said establishment thought chef Weissman was dumbing down the \"sandbar\" since allegedly most San Antonians don't trust their Seafood secondary to their distance from the water. \u00a0 The problem was not that the food was prepared poorly. \u00a0It was the finished product. \u00a0It was a \"cruise ship\" experience. A very, \"thanks for coming, now get out\" experience. \u00a0The wine, superb, antipasti, delicious, the personal experience..lacking. \u00a0The personal touch was pedestrian, turn and burn if you will. \u00a0The Cavatelli was killed with parsnip. \u00a0Parsnip is delicious, but should be an accent to a dish that is advertised as Boar Cavatelli with Parsnip and Brussels Sprout. \u00a0There was one Brussels Sprout. \u00a0There were about 20 Parsnips. \u00a0And that was our night. \u00a0When Rosario's and Ocho wins out over this place, it's time to re-think your destination."], ["Peter H.", "Pricey but great food and nice ambiance. Osso buco is delicious, whole seabass is an impressive treat, and the antipasto selection is diverse and overall very tasty. Service had more good intention than good anticipation but could have been a holiday weekend effect."], ["Michael B.", "When in San Antonio, Il Sogno is one of my favorite places to visit. The Italian menu features housemade pastas and has a vast antipasto bar to choose from. The pastas are expertly crafted and sauce pairings perfect. The pizzas are quite good and the ingredient combinations are often interesting, although pleasant. Sometimes service can be spotty and reservations are a must. I have yet to try a dish here I dislike. Definitely some of the best Italian in San Antonio."], ["Charlie H.", "Mr Weissman - where are you? - completely underwhelming - 4 different service people for table of two - so hot we're sweating - forgot our starter - pasta so poorly prepared in Saltimbocca had to pull it apart - what happened? - does not match previous experiences there - is this a trend?"], ["Nick A.", "We stopped by last Saturday night without reservations and were to,d that they would have an outdoor table for us in 45 min. The restaurant does not have a website and I was under the impression that they do not take reservations. Apparently this was the case but due to lines when they would open up they have charged this policy. Our hostess that day was very accommodating and let us order a glass of wine as we waited. We were seated within 15 minutes at a nice table outside with it's own heat lamp as it was a bit chilly outside (after 9PM)We started with the antipasto platter the highlight of which were the house cured anchovies. Briny & get you perfectly in the back of your mouth. The other offerings included \u00a0roasted peppers with goat cheese, Brussel Sprouts with bacon and two others that I don't seem to recall. The bread service included focaccia with white bean pur\u00e9e. One of the best bread offerings I have come across in a while. For my entree I had the wood fire roasted duck with a balsamic cherry glaze, focaccia stuffing and roasted root vegetables. This is one of the best plates of food I have had in San Antonio over the last month after moving here. The duck was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy skin and the stuffing was indulgence done well. My girlfriend had the Osso Bucco served with a Parmesan risotto. A perfect dish for cool temperature alfresco dining. The marrow bone of the Osso Bucco came with a small spoon to scoop out the marrow. Kudos to the chef for this. Over all a great meal & a restaurant we look forward to return to. I am glad we stopped by devoid of plans when we did. \u00a0I just wish they had a website as all other restaurants at the pearl do."], ["Rose S.", "I feel I should first say that I'm a huge fan of Il Songo however, when we visited on Friday, April 24th for dinner, I was greatly disappointed. \u00a0We were sat by the H'orderves table and there was a continuos and annoying flow of flies all night long. \u00a0We wanted to order H'orderves but after seeing the the flies in them, we passed. \u00a0Then we ordered a medium rare New York strip and the Veal Chop and again, to our disappointment they were over cooked and extremely tough.

The feeling in the restaurant is cozy and outside sits a nicely sized patio for sunny afternoons. From our table we could see across the dining room through to the open concept kitchen. The wine was phenomenal, absolutely fantastic. The sommelier on point with his recommendation. For an appetizer we chose 3 selections from the antipasti bar. I had one specific antipasti in mind and told my husband to chose 2 that he would like. The waitress recommended against my selection (a simple kalamata olive tapenade). Instead she recommended a kalamata olive antipasti mixed with carrots and vinegar. It was not good. We were also brought an antipasti that we didn't order, though she quickly brought us the right dish once we notified her of the mistake.For dinner I asked about a pasta dish, the first one on the menu, and our waitress recommended against it. I ended up ordering the \"salmon special\" which the waitress stated came with pasta (we had her double check). My husband ordered meatballs as well as the calamari appetizer. The food came out (timing was perfect) but instantly we saw that the salmon was plated on vegetables, not pasta. My husband notified the manager, who instantly brought out a plate of pasta. The pasta was just alright. It was a fetticini and didn't pair well with my salmon and vegetables. According to my husband the meatballs were delicious and the red sauce in which they sat, brilliant. The calamari, though spicy, was fried to perfection. All in all, I couldn't recommend this restaurant based on our meal. For the price of the meal I felt I should have appreciated more than the bread and the wine. I finished nothing, taking small bites here and there. Nothing was fantastic and I left feeling disappointed."], ["Jamie H.", "my colleagues and i went to il sogno osteria for a large group dinner, and overall we really enjoyed the food and experience. one major thing worth noting though, is that if you come with a large group they will be unable to seat you until the entire party arrives.we had a planned menu with family style appetizers and salads, and then the option to choose between 4 entrees. we started with an antipasti that ended up being the highlight of the meal, which included roasted tomatoes, tapenade, hummus, goat cheese with roasted red peppers, shrimp and calamari (grilled, not fried) with peppers, and some sort of raisin compote. every thing on this plate was quite delicious, and i would highly recommend the platter. we also received a margarita flatbread which was also delicious. the dough was chewy and fresh and perfectly balanced with the amount of cheese and sauce. we were then served a very nice green salad that was lightly dressed and came with poached pears, avocado, and tomatoes. \u00a0i selected the pan-seared salmon, which was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a micro-green puree. i do have to admit that by this time i was very full, but i certainly managed to take at least a few bites. the salmon filets were enormous, but cooked quite well. i did not love the semi-bitter taste of the micro-green puree, but thought that the potatoes were done quite nicely.we finished the meal with tiramisu, which was decent. it was very creamy but not super flavorful, although i did enjoy the chocolate sauce on the side.overall the meal was quite enjoyable, the wait staff was very attentive, and i would look forward to returning."], ["Bryana C.", "This place is AMAZING!!! if you looking for somewhere to go for a date night this is it.. make sure you make a reservation bc they have been busy every time we have gone in there.. they dont have a full bar but their wine list is very reasonably price! the food is so good, we went there one year for NYE.. it was a great choice for my friends and myself... with bottles of wine, appetizers, dinners and desert for 6 people was around $600 so for the service and the quality of food it was well worth every penny but we went all out that night.

We had cheese for an appetizer but the bread was commercial in taste and texture and the plate was not well presented. They were out of the first pasta dish I ordered so I chose the salmon linguine with curry. The pasta was not cooked al dente; it was too soft and too salty as well as overly creamy. Although the waiter suggested it had a kick to it, I found it bland. My husband's clam pasta had very little pasta and it was also too creamy. The waiter was nice and when I told him my dish was salty he offered me something else, but I declined. It is also a nice space in a cool area but I think they need to up their game if they want to make a name for themselves."], ["N P.", "A friend recommended this place. Got there early for dinner on Tuesday night. The service was incredible. I wish I could give them five stars, but the food was good, not great. I ordered pizza and it was good.

Their cappuccino was very good."], ["Lindsay R.", "This is one of my favorite places in town, because basically everything Andrew Weismann touches turns to gold. I miss the breadsticks they used to put out before the meals, but the antipasti plate is always a fantastic choice. The wine list is wonderful, but even better than that are sommeliers who are willing to help you pick the perfect bottle without making you feel uneducated. Every server is impeccable, and goes out of their way to make every visit special, without making it stuffy or intimidating. The goat cheese omelet at breakfast is a really nice way to start the day, and the coffee is on point. Highly recommended no matter what time of day you're eating. I do like the choice of citrus for your water!

There are better restaurants in town that are more elegant and a much better dining experience."], ["Elise D.", "Amazing. We were hesitant to go because the reviews that disliked the service and there is nothing I dislike more than bad service but it was fabulous.

My father wanted to take my wife and I somewhere nice, and I recommended this restaraunt, because I had heard such great things about it, and I was embarrassingly disappointed. \u00a0Immediately walking in the place, you can feel the pretention. Glasses of wine start at $11, and we weren't even offered wine suggestions. All of the antipasto tasted the same - and the shrimp and squid were tough and fishy. I had the wild boar ravioli ($26), and it was WAY too salty, almost impossible to eat. It also had parsnips, and no one should eat parsnips. They taste like nothing. There were about 10 raviolis, so each little ravioli cost over $2.00 each...ridiculous. They cramped 5 of us in a tiny booth back by the wine rack, and my father, a big guy, had to sit at the actual corner of the table. The manager schmoozed some lady at the table next to us for at least 30 minutes, and he was practically resting his butt on our table. \u00a0 \u00a0I don't know what they're service is like for breakfast or lunch, but I will NEVER go back for dinner, if I ever go back at all.

The charcuterie was incredible, and it was the best linguini and clams I've ever had. Can't wait to go back."], ["Chris B.", "Not really getting the 4.5 star aggregate review on Il Sogno, unless the bar is lowered since it's in San Antonio. Although the food itself was delicious, there were several factors that dropped this from a 4.5 to a 3 star in my book. And take it for what it's worth, but I regularly eat at top-notch Italian restaurants in NYC & SF (Locanda, SPQR, Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria, etc).1.) Portion sizes were way too big - as in Olive Garden big. I get it that some people associate size with value, but in this category of restaurant, I consider a huge plate a negative.2.) Food was overly salty... not to the point of being unpleasant, but definitely saltier than one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.3.) Most importantly - the service was on the snotty/condescending side. Maybe that's what upper-middle class San Antonians expect when they go to high-end restaurants, but I personally expect warmth and a helpful attitude. I asked for a white wine that was crisp with lots of minerality, and rather than a straight answer, was told which wines weren't in stock. Same deal when we didn't order dessert (lame dessert menu - tiramisu?? what is it - 1999?)... response was \"very well then\"All in all, I'm glad we went so we can strike this place off our list, but we left wishing we had gone back to Barbaro, where we had lunch earlier in the day."], ["David K.", "5 for food, 2 for service on the night we were there. Great food, one of the best Italian restaurants in Texas. Seafood risotto and red snapper were superb. But service did not match the quality of food or expectations for a restaurant of this reputation. Waiter ignored table for most of meal, and restaurant was not that busy. No checking up on wine, or meal, or noticing that it was our anniversary (he knew it was). Other reviews commented on high quality food but inconsistent service. Couldn't get waiters attention - and we would have ordered more wine, salad, desert."], ["Michele R.", "If you have but one meal to eat in San Antonio, go here. \u00a0That's my husband's and my advice based on a splendid lunch that included fantabulous food, stellar service and artful ambiance. \u00a0This was the finest dining experience of our recent month long vacation, one of the most memorable of all restaurant meals we have ever had and a great value.That's the bottom line. \u00a0Here are the details:KITCHEN: As we walked in we could see into the open kitchen were Chef Andrew Weissman was making gnocchi. He is an accomplished chef and unlike restaurants where the celebrity chef name is simply appended to the marquis, at Il Sogno Weissman is often in the kitchen. Bravo!AMBIANCE: We felt enveloped by the artful space. The perfect blend of funky and elegant for the old Pearl Brewery complex setting is what we first noticed, complete with the perfect jazz mix on the sound system, and wonderful aromas of great food.SERVICE: What will made us feel \"ahhhh...some\" was the stellar service. Perhaps the best service we have ever had in a restaurant of any kind. So it is worth saying that it was provided by Mario. (Roll the \"r\".) From first greeting, when he brought by Il Sogno's signature tray of thinly sliced citrus from which to choose to add to our water, through answering questions on wine and food, through service of each course, this was consummately professional and warm service. Mario's graceful enthusiasm piqued our appetites. Ask to sit in his area of the restaurant and your experience will be even better as you enjoy the fantabulous food.FOOD: This is Italian cooking in the finest form. The meal started with delicious complimentary foccacia and white bean puree. Our starter of a split of a house spinach salad was lovely for fresh flavors and could have served three as starter course. We choose two entrees. One, a shellfish risotto that had incredible depth of flavor from shrimp stock, was cooked to perfect al dente and creamy texture and with generous portion of perfectly cooked shellfish.. We also had a pasta arrabiata with calamari, again \"perfecto\". \u00a0Thanks to top notch coordination between kitchen and server, these arrived at the table nice and hot Panna cotta is one of our favorite desserts, we have eaten a lot of it over the years, and the Il Sogno panna cotta, this just set, barely sweet delight, was absolutely the best we have ever had.WINE: The wine list here is Italian centric and extensive for by the bottle and glass options, including varietals that are harder to find by the glass (at least in our part of the country), like Arneis and Aglianico. \u00a0Glass prices can be steep, around $15, but we found that to be true all over Texas during our visit. Pours are generous. Wine is first poured, at the table, from bottle into individual carafes and from carafe to glass over the course of the meal.VALUE: This has a reputation as a spendy restaurant, but that is very much in the control of the diner. At about $80 (before tax or gratuity) we thought this was a great value for a really priceless experience and food choices as described above. \u00a0But had we elected to split one of their pizzas and and stuck to soft beverages, we could kept the total around $20.ACCESSIBILITY: \u00a0For diners who have mobility issues - and we met a lot of vets in San Antonio who do as there is a military hospital there - \u00a0it is worth sharing that Il Sogno has ample parking in the associated lot, including accessible parking. \u00a0The restaurant is on one floor, although when tables are full it might path of travel to seating tight. \u00a0The ladies loo is on the first floor, and accessible. \u00a0The gents loo is on the second floor (there is an elevator up) and it was accessible too.RESERVATIONS?: The concierge at our hotel told us Il Sogno did not take reservations. But we think they may in fact do that these days. \u00a0If you're going for dinner or the early evening antipasta bar, and they take reservations that would be wise given the well earned popularity of this remarkable place.A TIP: \u00a0They're open for breakfast too!"], ["Melisa H.", "I heard such wonderful things about this restaurant. I looked forward to this meal for a week. I found my salad to be underdressed, and the Linguine with Clam Sauce flavorless. The linguine was overcooked, the sauce was thick and flavorless and, in addition to being tasteless, the clams were so overcooked that they were like eating balls of rubber. In an attempt to redeem this meal, I tried a piece of my daughters mushroom pizza. While the crust was light and crispy it too was lacking flavor. The promised \"Caramelized onion\" was a paste dotted randomly about the pizza that had only a hint of onion flavor. When I left I was probably the most disappointed I had been in a meal. I wish we had gone to La Gloria instead."], ["The D.", "I've walked by this place many times wondering what it was and until last Saturday I finally got to enjoy their amazing food. I came in during breakfast hours, this place has customer service right down to the most minut detail. \u00a0From a tray of sliced fruit for your water to the coffee they press right before you. Wait staff is amazing, decor is modern rustic, dress casual is better suited but I don't think they mind. The breakfast sleeving was great. \u00a0Portions were a little too big for my taste but overall the experience was great. Their crispy garlic potatoes are mouthwatering and addicting. Please make this a must eat place here in San Antonio. Vegetarian Friendly!"], ["Ginger G.", "We're visiting San Antonio for a long weekend. We found a spot to sit down outside this restaurant (not knowing it was a restaurant yet) to munch on a snack. The side door opened and a chef came out to pick fresh herbs from the nearby garden. We asked if it was okay for us to sit there and he said \"of course. Can I get you some water\". We gratefully said no thank you. \u00a0 Two minutes later a waiter came out with cups and a pitcher of ice water. So nice. So to show our appreciation we decided to go in and have a glass of wine. That turned into an incredible pizza to share and included \"gifts\" from the restaurant of a garlic toast olive platter and ended with complimentary tiramisu. \u00a0The food was outstanding the atmosphere was nice and the service was the best.

He gave us an wonderful recommendation on an Italian red wine. I can't remember the name but I will definitely look it up when I go back. Even though we went on a Saturday and the restaurant was busy, the service and management made our anniversary very memorable.

Saw that many people had recommended this place when someone asked for a good Italian non-chain restaurant on a Facebook page so I decided to try as it's very close to where my mom lives. \u00a0I had chicken fettuccine alfredo and the portion was huge and the sauce was delicious!!! It cost extra for a Caesar salad but I completely recommend paying the extra money as the dressing was fantastic. \u00a0The rolls are just as delicious as everyone says on their other reviews. \u00a0My mom had chicken Parmesan and she felt it was better than Olive Garden and we love Olive Garden too. \u00a0I have to admit that while I love Olive Garden, Umberto's is now my go to Italian restaurant!!!!!"], ["Paul B.", "I think I FINALLY found an Italian place relatively close by to our house (which is located in Alamo Ranch) that is worth going back to (in my humble opinion, in the last two and a half years since I moved to San Antonio, I have found the Italian and Chinese food here, for the most part, well below par). I have heard that there are a few really good Italian restaurants in the downtown area but I would rather avoid the drive, parking hassles, etc. of downtown (when I am full, I don't want to drive to far to get home. I guess you could consider us homebodies then. Having grown up in Yonkers, NY (borders the Bronx) until my military career began at 20, I \"think\" I know good Italian food (at least the kind that I was brought up on) pretty well. I also spent 15 more years total in New Jersey and Boston during and after my military career. The eateries I frequented back then were all family owned (like Umberto's) and most of those families spoke Italian as their first language.. and to each other in their establishments. Also many of my childhood friends were Italian (and surely still are), so those times when I ate dinner over at their houses, it was usually Italian food. We also ate Italian food every Wednesday night at home (yup, just like those Prince spaghetti commercials). My wife is Asian and I love her cooking, but usually if I want to make something Italian (from scratch), I am the one who does the cooking. Problem is, I am probably the slowest cook in the history of the world... I have been dubbed \"The Midnight \u00a0Chef\". With full time work, sometimes you just want a place to go to where they cook good food... and do all the dishes.Okay, enough of that (maybe I am just rambling because I am happy to know that good Italian food exists not far from me, and it's bringing back memories).So here is my opinion of Umberto's from just my first visit last night (albeit takeout, because my wife and Mother-In-Law don't want to take a 3 month old baby out to a restaurant, in fear of the little guy catching a cold or worse). I was able to park right in front of the restaurant. After telling the hostess that I was ordering take-out, I was given a menu and led to the bar where nobody else was seated (it was 6:30 pm on a Friday night). In fact, there were only two tables with people seated to dine in the entire restaurant. So I browsed the menu but I kind of knew what I was going to order for my family. I ordered some italian/americanized staples: chicken parm, eggplant parm, fettuccine alfredo, and two side orders of meatballs with marina sauce. The entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose minestrone soup, soup of the day (cream of ?), & side garden salad (minus the onions... I found onions on the salad when I got home) respectively. While I waited, the bartender brought me a small plate of bruschetta, very tasty, and a glass of ice water (much appreciated). The sizeable order took less than 30 minutes to come out, probably because the place was relatively empty. The order came out it was in three bags, and the bartender actually helped me to my truck with them. I did give him a 5% tip for a take-out order. I actually don't know the etiquette on that, but he served me bruschetta & water while I waited, plus took my order & brought the bags of food from the back when they were ready. When we ate this is what was some of the opinions. My Mother-In-Law (who is helping care for our baby), who doesn't usually eat Italian food (as her husband mostly cooks her Filipino food), really liked the minestrone soup, chicken parm, & eggplant parm (we shared our food). My wife & I did not care much for the minestrone soup, as we found it had too much of an oniony taste. We both loved the cream of \"something\" soup (\"something\" being broccoli I think). It was hot, creamy & delicious. My wife & I really enjoyed both the chicken parm and eggplant parm (I thought the chicken may have been slightly overcooked, maybe because it was pounded thinner than I am used to). The fettuccine alfredo was excellent! I use fresh/quality ingredients at home & this tasted similar to my best efforts. The meatballs, on their own without marinara, tasted a bit \"meaty\" if that makes sense. I didn't taste enough fat, herbs, cheese, or bread crumbs in the meatballs. Possibly \"too\" lean made them a bit dry on their own, because when dredged in the marinara sauce, they were absolutely perfect! Note: The online menu prices are a bit outdated as of this review. You may ask: \"Why the five stars if you have some small complaints?\". Well I was told that Italian cooks are judged by their tomato sauce (or \"gravy\" as it is/was known in the Bronx). Their marinara was spot on delicious, I could eat it by the spoonful on it's own. Bravo Umberto's! I'll be back, again & again to see \"youse guys\"! This is an opinion, I'm not a food critic, but I surely do know what tastes good or not to me :)"], ["David G.", "I'll fist say this. \u00a0I'm very particular about my italian food. \u00a0I've traveled to Italy and had dinner with Italian families. \u00a0So when I say this is great Italian food, you have an idea of my standards. \u00a0We had a Caprese Salad, Ravioli with a pesto cream sauce, and Chicken Marsala. \u00a0Complimentary Bruschetta & Hot Rosemary rolls were brought out and were delicious.There have been numerous reviews and pictures, so all I can add is this:Go there. \u00a0Eat there. \u00a0Judge not a book by it's cover. \u00a0The outside is plain and ordinary, but they put the heart and flavor where it counts - inside the restaurant."], ["James S.", "Tucked within an unassuming business complex, Umberto's is quite the surprise when searching for quality Italian food on SA's Northwest Side. Quick highlights -- (1) STRONG flavor game here; (2) outstanding service & staff friendliness; (3) sharp restaurant execution. Atmosphere leaves only some to be desired; overall d\u00e9cor, though slightly generic, is pleasing.Upon entrance, expect an immediate warm greeting and offer to be seated according to your liking. Water and bruschetta di pomodori (garlic-toasted bread topped w/ olive oil, basil & tomatoes) are brought out to start. Umberto's menu is concise, accurate, appropriately descriptive. Next brought to table alongside any appetizers are warm rosemary bread + whipped butter.My farfalle (bow-tie pasta w/ Italian sausage, bell pepper & red onion) was hearty and savory, its sauce flowing with vodka and fennel notes. Topped with grated Parmesan, the dish was a KNOCKOUT and one I'll be returning for hands down. Its Caesar companion was perfectly dressed, complemented with decent cro\u00fbtons.Umberto's pulls off dessert well too. The tiramis\u00f9 that followed my entr\u00e9e was abundantly coffee-flavored and layered nicely with mascarpone. I'm already looking forward to trying their cheesecake next visit, as well as some of their wines... skipped out this time.In closing, I'm all for supporting local businesses, ESPECIALLY family-run ones, and with 3+ years of growing service -- thanks to glowing Yelp reviews and positive word of mouth -- I can see why Umberto's has many a loyal patron who breaks bread with them not once, not twice, but up to five times by week's end. I'm not the least bit surprised a restaurant expansion is in the works.All I know... Umberto's is doing their thing and doing it extremely well.

The calamari had a nice lemony flavor and tasted fresh. Personally, my salmon was cooked to perfection! The pasta had great flavor, as well - my brother was reaching from the other side of the table stealing some off my plate! Overall, the portions were huge and so good for the price.

I'm not a fan and didn't eat it but my serving was quickly eaten by my husband. \u00a0Our drink orders were taken and brought quickly as was our food. Bread and soup or salad is included with your dinner entree.  \u00a0 \u00a0Another reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was the salad and bread were nothing special. The basil rolls were a little chewy. The salads were your basic bag lettuce with a cucumber, tomato and carrots.  \u00a0 \u00a0I do not like salad dressing of any kind. I specifically say NO salad dressing in my salad. Not on the side. They put it in the side in a container in the salad and brought it any way. This is wasteful, on one hand. And if someone says NO dressing, why would you randomly just pick a dressing and bring it out of all the brands of dressings you serve, in the other hand? Just a pet peeve because what ends up happening half the time is the server spills the dressing onto my salad. \u00a0After the average service and start to the meal, I was a little worried about how the main course might taste. We picked the place based in good reviews from Yelp and Trip Advisor. I am happy to say none of us were disappointed. I ordered the penne marinara. My husband ordered the beef lasagna. My daughter ordered the chicken parmigiana which came with a side of spaghetti. \u00a0The portions were enormous. The flavor of the sauce was really good. Not too sweet like some Italian places.  \u00a0 My husband and daughter also shared an appetizer of calamari. I didn't ask how it tasted, but it disappeared pretty quickly, so I assume it was pretty good.  \u00a0The place wasn't very crowded, which is probably typical for a weeknight. We had plenty of room around our table for a nice romantic dinner if that would be your goal. \u00a0 The spaciousness around the tables would also be good if you are a person who needs the extra space for a walker or wheelchair. Because the restaurant is in a strip mall, close parking and accessible curbs are near as well.  \u00a0 \u00a0I almost gave 3 stars, but the entrees tasted so good, and the ambiance was so nice, I know I'll be back to give the place another chance. In the end, our waiter did bring re-fills and do a decent job. He just wasn't very friendly. The prices were reasonable for what we got to eat. And 2 of us have enough food left over for a full lunch tomorrow. \u00a0This place is definitely worth a try."], ["Christina T.", "By far best little Italian place I've tried. \u00a0I'd consider \u00a0it a hidden gem tucked away. \u00a0The brushetta is fantastic, \u00a0just the right amount of garlic/tomato. \u00a0I have yet to try something here and NOT like it. \u00a0By far my favorite has to be the Shrimp Umberto...

Dough takes extra pride in the quality of ingredients and you can absolutely taste the difference. The dough itself is made in house as well as the mozzarella and sausage. Many of their ingredients also comes straight from Naples (including the stone oven!) and if they can't get it from Naples, they get it from the region surrounding Naples (like their basil and thyme) or from a local farm (like the arugula). The point is: fresh ingredients, farm to table experience. Hopefully you'll notice the difference! \u00a0The margarita pizza was very delicious. The dough was \u00a0soft, elastic and fragrant with a thin crust and enough cheese and sauce. I sat outside enjoying the ambiance with a glass of falanghina. Service was superb too!"], ["Melissa M.", "TRUFFLE BURRATA is BOMB! I'd probably give Dough more of like a 3.5 because I honestly don't think the pizza is that great here and \"pizzeria\" is in it's name. Come here knowing the BURRATA is the star of the menu and you'll never leave disappointed. It's a solid 5 for me! They have a pretty good variety of different types of burrata and sauce pairings. We always get the truffle burrata. It tastes so fresh and is very smooth inside. We usually pick a pairing that has proscuitto, balsamic, and olive oil. Last time we had a fig and arugula pairing with our burrata and they offered us a side of balsamic and olive oil on the side. All were super satisfying!As for the pizza, again I don't think it's that great. Just average especially for the price you pay. Maybe this is how pizza is actually done in Italy, but I don't like how the center is never as crispy as the outer part. It's always a little soggy. I prefer New York style pizza in which the pizza usually is cooked more evenly and the center is as crispy and the outer parts. The toppings and sauces seem like they are better quality/more flavorful at Dough though so I give them points for that at least. We usually get the pork lovers or arugula and proscuitto just to complete our meal. I will say that I think the pizza does taste better when we bring our leftovers home and heat it up in the oven to get the pizza more crispy, but we really shouldn't have to do that with the price. Service here has always been above average, attentive, and helpful. The wait has never been too excessive, but I don't think we've come here during peak days/hours. If you want to taste the best cheese ball in the city COME to Dough!! Just don't expect to be blown out of the water by the pizza here. It's good, but not the best."], ["Larry E.", "Absolutely stunning! Came down on Halloween to eat here and at another place! I had a Margarita and the Lady had a Spec Pizza and we split an appetizer. Customers and staff where all having a great time. I stuffed myself!"], ["Amy D.", "Tastey pizza! I would def recommend! They gave my daughter a bit of dough to play with. Neat concept"], ["Caitlyn S.", "Dough is a bit of a mystery to me. It's set in the Castle Hills area, in kind of a strip mall setting, and if you didn't know about it (most likely you've heard about it on a little show called \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\"?) you'd pass right by it. Yet the prices reflect a much different atmosphere and dining experience.We visited on a Friday evening around 5:30. We were able to be seated right away, but it got pretty busy the longer we sat there. They had happy hour for a bit when arrived (I think it was only until 6) so we ordered a small cheese plate as the HH drink prices weren't worth it. The cheese plate had three different types of cheese, but it was definitely SMALL! Maybe okay for a table for two as a small appetizer, or to pair with wine.Our table ordered a couple of salads and two pizzas to share amongst the three of us. I tried the salad on special that evening, and it included kale, butternut squash, and pepitas. It was pretty good, although I forgot to request the dressing on the side so it came out a bit oily for my taste. We ordered the classic Napoletana pizza so we could give it a try, along with the Arugula and Prosciutto pizza. The Napoletana pizza was pretty good, but I couldn't really taste the truffle. And of course I picked the prosciutto off of the second pizza, so it wasn't really even worth me trying since all that was left was the arugula and not much flavor. We ended up with leftovers with three of us eating the pizza, so they were a decent size, although pretty expensive. Dough does ship in their flour from Italy (or something...) and sources locally, so that may be where the hike in price comes from, but $21 for basically a cheese pizza is a bit much for my taste.Overall, I think I'd go back, as it was a pleasant experience and good vegetarian options. I'd definitely like to sample a few more of their pizzas. The waitress seemed knowledgeable, although we did have to track her down a couple of times. My biggest complaint is that they are overpriced, and that includes pizza and drinks. There are many other places in the city that I think offer just as good, if not better, pizza at a better price.

Have caution, though, for the burrata is very rich and filling. I wouldn't recommend eating half of the burrata while waiting for your pizza to come out.. You may not have room!My friend and I split the Natasha and Smoked Salmon salads, and they were both pretty decent. The smoked salmon was cooked to perfection! Nothing to drool over like the burrata, but I would order the smoked salmon salad again for sure. Just when we practically had to unbutton the top button of our jeans, our server recommended the panna cotta for dessert. I was hesitant, since I'm not much of a flan-texture sort of person. We decided to dive head first and say, why not? So glad my taste buds proved me otherwise!! It was INCREDIBLE and we polished that plate clean. Needless to say, if you're looking for an authentic Italian adventure for your tastebuds, definitely check this place out!"], ["Robert B.", "I have been to several places on triple D and very few have been up to snuff This place is okay at best. The app:Bruschetta del giornoOddly made with ricotta. Normally you expect mozz especially with a place known for their mozz. It's two pieces of bread. Not very impressive presentation. The Pizza:Tried the house pie with sausage, pepper, caramelized onions, among other ingredients. The pie is tiny for $20. The flavor of the pizza was good but just not enough pizza for the price. I would have happily paid the price even more if it was 18\". The dough was fresh for the pie which is noticeable by the toughness of the crust. But for an oven that cooks at however million degrees the crust is still soggy. Ultimately not impressed. Much like majority of the triple D locations."], ["Katherine S.", "This place is awesome.

Cooked, yes. Not exactly tasty. - cheese: melted and just a tinge greasy....good- sauce: very tomato-ee it overpowered the flavor of the pizza without adding much profile. A less amount of sauce and a bit more salt and pepper in the sauce wouldn't hurt. Once the pizza cool down the basil and prosciutto came forward but by then the crust was saggy. Ingredients were fresh and they had decent espresso. The price for the pizza and coffee was on the higher end. This place is more of a restaurant than a true pizzeria. Overall score of 3/5."], ["Abby M.", "There is no gluten free pizza dough here but the waiter was very thorough in explaining the reasoning behind that choice (they use strict Italian recipes and cooking strategies). However, he asked if there was a gluten intolerance/sensitivity he should be aware of. How intuitive. The salad menu was excellent. \u00a0I got the Natasha's Salad and I loved it. My family had the Margarita pizza, pork lover pizza, prosciutto arugula pizza and sausage and roasted red grape pizza. I think the last one was the family favorite.

Ive never had a bad pizza here though i admit im addicted to the buffalo mozz pizza and have yet to stray. They only have 1 bottle of moscato and i love it so much i usually get the whole dang bottle. In my defense i dont drink often and its hard to get drunk of white wine with a belly full of bread. lolI dont often get apps as i get full easily but i did try a few desserts and while not the BEST ever they still rant high enough i wont take away a star for it.My best advice is to bring some good friends and a healthy respect for the price tags attached, otherwise the service is great, the food is amazing and the atmosphere cant be beat."], ["Belinda C.", "This place is always delicious.

I could eat a meal of just the burrata and toast points. \u00a0They serve the burrata with some accompanying items like pesto or semi-dried tomatoes or evoo/balsamic. \u00a0The first time I came here for lunch, I skipped the burrata and just had a pizza.

The mozerella is fantastic so make sure to place the roasted tomato and fresh basil on top of every bite! The salads are so fresh and crisp and large enough to share.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'll take the neighborhood pizzeria any day. They have outdoor seating with butane heaters if you would like to eat and enjoy some fresh air during the winter. The wine selection was fairly extensive and all wine were from Italy. All pizza is made fresh to order and is baked in front of you in Italian style wood burning brick ovens. If you would like to see your pizza being made I recommend you sit at the kitchen. I felt our server could've been more present and a bit more welcoming. This was my only complaint for the night. If you're going to charge me $25 a pie everything needs to be on point. The redemption of this was while sitting at the kitchen the workers in the kitchen were really friendly and spoke to us all night. I even learned a few things. I recommend this place. And on my next visit I hope I can bump this up to five stars. The food was phenomenal and well worth the price."], ["Anna W.", "Great pizza! Authentic Italian thin crust pizza.

You don't get a lot of it, and there's nothing outstanding about it. Plenty of restaurants make their own bread and simply give it away. This bread isn't any better than the bread I've had at other places. So once again, it's good but not worth the price they charge for it. The dough on the pizza was great, however the toppings were so oversauced that on both pizzas we ordered, all of the toppings slid right off as soon as we pulled a slice away. So that was annoying.

If you're reading this review and looking for somewhere to eat. Just go here. Trust me. And order a burrata. You'll thank me. We ordered the Fior de Latte with pesto and heirloom tomatoes. A burrata is fresh mozzarella stuffed with another fresh cheese (depending on which kind you order) and cream. And it fantastic. It comes with fresh baked flatbread that has an excellent flavor and textured, alone, or topped with the mozzarella. Then we ordered the pork love pizza. Fresh light sauce, the way napoletana pizza is supposed to be, fresh hosemade mozzarella and a TON of toppings. You can watch them expertly toss the dough and put it directly into the fire oven and it cooks pretty quick. Our waitress was excellent and attentive. She had suggestions and knew the special. She kept our drinks full with a smile. The price was good for the quality, but the corkage fee if you byob is $20! That's a bit steep, but again, the food is fantastic.

By Yelp star rating descriptions, it would best be described by \"Meh. I've Experienced better.\" I think it deserves to be rounded up to three stars though, it is OK without the \"A\".Fior di Latte Burrata was a nice and generously sized starter. Not the best Burrata I've had, but the flatbread which accompanied it enhanced the experience. Complex, chewy bread with fresh herbs sprinkled atop. Got me unnecessarily excited about the upcoming pizza crust.Salmon Spinach salad was half great, half regrettable. The salmon was a lovely piece of fish, thickly cut and attentively smoked. The salad, meanwhile, was drowning in overly sweet dressing. A sort of syrupy moat to which was sacrificed otherwise enjoyable ingredients.And now the Sausage pizza: Seriously, this is what this restaurant is famous for? The crust had all the flavour and charm of a boxed Matzah cracker. The thickness was spot on though and the topping flavours all complemented each other. Mediocre overall, not a special pie by any means.Worth coming here just for the Tiramisu, if you are a fan of the often mistreated dessert. Angelically light, ladies fingers kissed with espresso rather than soggy with liquor. Densely whipped mascarpone with a texture and sensation similar to semifreddo. A few taps of cocoa powder atop to add a bittersweet finishing touch without making you feel like you dumped a packet of cocoa mix into your mouth.Bottom line, not with $100 for two people (after tip). I would return for the Burrata and Tiramisu, but I wouldn't wait for a table just for those two items.

The pizza was mediocre at best. The appetizers are probably the best thing on the menu...and even then, it's just okay. Over priced and over rated, it seems that most people go here because of it being mentioned in media or because they want to support local business - and if you want to do that, then that's great.

So tangy! \u00a0We finished with the pana cotta dessert which was phenomenal. Three complaints: 1) The host situation. They had us check in at a random unmarked desk out front. The host said hi to me and asked for the number in our party then ignored me to help two other guests while I just stood there. When she had time to come back to me, she asked me all the same questions over again. When our table was ready, she sent me inside where I had to check in with a new person who then told us our table wasn't ready and we had to wait a bit up front in a tight area by the kitchen.....which brings me to complaint 2. 2) There's NO WAITING AREA 3) These 10\" pizzas are $20 a pop.

He told us all about the burrata, as well as the pizza. He had all kinds of recommendations for us, and knew what was authentic to Italy. I had the margherita pizza which was delicious.

I love cheese more than some people love their children, and I'd have any of the versions here as part of my last meal on earth.The BURRATA we had involved gorgonzola, figs, and prosciutto, the seasonal special, served with flatbread crisps. It was flavorful and decadent beyond belief, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat.Shared the TUSCAN SALAD with olives, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, and a balsamic vinaigrette. The garlic makes it, so don't order it if you don't like it.Customized the MARGHERITA pizza to add salami to the traditional combination of fresh mozz, basil, and tomato sauce. Adding the salami is a great way to stretch the traditional pie into a more filling meal option.Also tried the PORK LOVE, with four forms of pig: salami, sausage, pancetta, and speck. Despite being a featured pie, this was pork overkill and I wouldn't order it again. Meaty and filling, but unbalanced flavors and simply not my thing.Ironically, I did not care for the crust here. The dough, while it may be a traditional recipe crisped to perfection, is on the flavorless side.The tiramisu though? A must-get.

The way the building is is strange.There was no chat involved like \"hello how are you? what would you like for today?\" which I like. I wanna get my food and get out because if I wanted to talk and hang out I would call my friends. I don't know why everyone's complaining when they try to have a conversation with the workers there and they just tell callers what they wanna know, and that's a bad thing. They're a very busy establishment from what I've seen the first time I went there instead of ordering online/ by phone. No time to chit-chat. Also I wish for that they dont waste time talking and just focus on making my food delicious and of course, it came out very amazing. I've never had eggplant that good before. I like the fettuccine alfredo but the eggplant was so good, that I gave my fettuccine to my bf and gobbled up the eggplant without sharing. The food they served turned me into a greedy eating machine! I'm 100 lbs 5 foot 2 inches. I can barely finish small bowl of rice at home. When I order from La Sorrentina, they gave me big proportions. Half a pasta will probably suffice for me but that day, getting the eggplants for the first time, I just some of the pasta we ordered to try out my own and my bf's then I ate all of the eggplant. Never had the pizza there yet. I'm afraid it wont live up to expectations and ruin my image of the place."], ["Cara P.", "I had high expectations for this place given the reviews. One suggested that the place was fairly small and reservations were almost a necessity to get a table, so we called a few hours before to see if they still had any tables and were told it was no problem.

We also put in an order for stuffed mushrooms while we looked at the menu. 15 minutes went by and our appetizer was still not out yet, so we put in our dinner selections and went on with it. We then sat for 30 minutes, unattended to. Both my husbands drink and mine stayed empty for just about the remainder of the evening. We were also told we would get soup with our meal, to which we did not receive until asking for it, when our server finally brought us some refills. So finally, our meal comes, then our soups. She then informed us that our mushrooms were being made fresh and that's why they were taking so long. By this point it had been almost 40 minutes and we were half way done with our dinner. Drinks still empty. About 8:20 another party walked in. The table next to us was empty, and everything else was full, so instantly our table became a need. An older lady, who had been helping our server when she saw fit, came over and threw a straw wrapper into my dish and took it from me without so much as asking me if I was done (I wasn't). About that time our mushrooms came out. She took my fork, so I was unfortunately not able to eat any of them. She then came over and handed the check to my husband without asking if either of us wanted dessert. She then stood there. And waited until my husband got out his wallet and paid for our entire disaster of a meal. She gave the check to our original server and started clearing my husbands plate out from under him as well. The server brought our check back quickly and both of them stood there waiting to pounce on our table the moment we stood up-my 4 year old son was still eating. That didn't matter to either of them. They wanted our table so they could seat their next party. Had the two of them been this attentive to is all evening, this review would have gone differently, bc the food was quite good. Unfortunately, the service ruined the evening for us and we will not be back."], ["Nisey C.", "First time here today. Great service, prices and food is delish. Would definitely recommend to friend, family and any other Italian food lover."], ["Natalie A.", "Absolutely delicious! Quiet & quaint. Really is a hidden gem, and the staff is great."], ["Matthew W.", "A small little Mom and Pop restaurant off the beaten path. If you aren't looking for it you may end up driving past it. The food and service were exceptional. The food is reasonably priced. The only negative thing about the place is it is a small venue so book in advance if you have a large party."], ["rose t.", "I called in only to ask how much there pizza started at. \u00a0Got a price but also got a response that they would not be taking pizza orders today or tomorrow. \u00a0It took to much time. \u00a0Then I asked if I came in, if I could order something. \u00a0The answer, \" we may not make the order if it is to go'. \u00a0 So I am scratching this place off my place to visit. \u00a0I wonder how a place with a response like that is able to stay in business. \u00a0 I saw 5 stars and glad I called. \u00a0 \u00a0Huge disappointment since I am new to this neighborhood and trying to support local eateries."], ["Alyson S.", "As a broke college student this is great food, for a great price! Very small area but overall a great experience! Will most definitely return. Had the lunch special chicken paremsan with broccoli cream soup. DELICIOUS!! :)"], ["Kinitra B.", "Amazing little spot right across the street from SMU. Great food at a reasonable price and supporting the local Westside economy all in one swoop. Every single dish I've ordered has been yummy goodness from the Eggplant Parmesan to the Veal Sorrentina. Their bread is always fresh baked and homemade. This place has become a reliable goto in my restaurant repertoire. Highly recommended!"], ["Ashley R.", "I been here twice. It's okay..small place. Alittle over price and I just felt watch when eating as if they were making sure to see if my 18month old was going to dirty their table cloth."], ["Maria S.", "Love love love vegetables fresh pasta fresh pizza for kids delicious!! Nice quiet romantic place"], ["Jorge B.", "The food at this restaurant was delicious! The pasta, the chicken, the breadsticks and the wine were all delicious. I had the Tri-color chicken dish."], ["Sarah G.", "I will definitely be coming back to this place. Excellent food and great customer service. I was surprised to hear about this place as I always pass by Culebra and always miss it. It's a hidden local restaurant with great pride in what they do."], ["Melissa S.", "I was visiting San Antonio for a weekend with family. Found this place on yelp. We were there with a party of 6 plus 2 babies. All the adults loved their dish!! We all got a different dish and we all ate all of it! It's a small and quaint place and the service was very good."], ["Kelly A.", "What a lovely, bright little spot for Italian food close to St. Mary's. My friend and I had a really pleasant lunch here on a recent week day. We were served by a kind, yet efficient, grandmotherly woman who told us all about the daily lunch special (chicken parmigiana), which my friend opted for and enjoyed. I decided on my Italian lunch staple: eggplant parmigiana. Our entrees came with the choice of soup or salad, and we both had salads with Italian dressing, which were cool and crisp with just the right amount of dressing. My eggplant was delicious--large sections of eggplant, roasted with good marinara and cheese, served with a side of pasta. It was too much for me to eat. I love how this tiny space is set back from Culebra and perfectly suits itself to a leisurely lunch with a good friend. I'm looking forward to returning."], ["Elizabeth F.", "Everything is awesome here! To the salad to the desert. I will never go to an Olive Garden again. The prices are reasonable and it's not a big restaurant so you get your service better."], ["Erica M.", "Went in for the first time today for lunch with the hubby. It's a tiny spot across the St. Mary's campus, with only eight tables in the dining area. Service was excellent and the food was fabulous. We had mushroom soup, caesar salad, fried ravioli, chicken marsala and penne vodka with meatballs. Everything came out quickly and we could hear the action in the kitchen as pans sizzled. The flavors are on point and this place will become a regular spot for us. The one item that stood out the most to us was the fried ravioli. You could taste the pasta and the cheese filling was so light and creamy at the same time, it was like a perfect ravioli pillow."], ["Liverache E.", "Very delicious. Quaint, hidden gem across from St Mary's. We had the baked spaghetti, which has shrimp and Calgary in it and were happy as clans. Highly recommended!"], ["Jocelyn P.", "The food was great, & the service was ok. We arrived at 7:30 and were the only table at the little restaurant. So I don't believe waiting for our food an hour was necessary. The waitress didn't apologize for our wait, only informed us the food was on it's way, which then still took a good 10 to 15 minutes to arrive. After all that wait, I can't really say the food made up for it. It was great food, but not enough to make up for how long we had been waiting. I am also a waitress, and I believe you should always try to please the customer especially if they are kind people, and right away management should've suggested our waitress offer us a free appetizer or complimentary desert for the ridiculous hour we waited. Besides that, people that arrived after us received their food at a reasonable time, even before we did! Our waitress or someone above her should have had the decency of explaining why there was such a wait, it was quite upsetting. With all that being said, I can only give La Sorrentina three stars, and I would definitely have to think twice before I recommended this restaurant to anyone else."], ["Faith R.", "I have to admit, I was hesitant to visit this place. \u00a0But I am very happy my buddy made me try it out. \u00a0Service was prompt and attentive. \u00a0Food was timely and most importantly delicious! \u00a0Chicken Marsala was authentic and addictive! \u00a0Calamari was plentiful and crisp, the marinara was a little spicy. Nice kick. \u00a0Salad was perfect portion and green (unlike OG). \u00a0Cheese cake was yum. \u00a0 Prices are comparable to any Italian restaurant. \u00a0I would definitely recommend."], ["Matthew S.", "This is by far the best in the west. I work nearby and I am unable to stop eating here. Every week I go through the mental checklist of where and what to eat, it is always an option, no matter what. I always order to go, fellow coworkers will smell what I am eating and will immediately start scrolling for the menu."], ["Rumaldo D.", "Amazing Italian fare generously and cordially served in a tiny spot off Culebra. \u00a0The owner intimated a larger location would be opening soon off Hillcrest and Bandera."], ["Michelle G.", "We were skeptical when we arrived as there were only two other parties, but it was beyond amazing! The service we good. \u00a0You could smell the food being freshly prepared. \u00a0The food is out of this world AMAZING. \u00a0We for sure will be making this our regular go to for Italian food. \u00a0Some of our kids are very picky eater and they Loved it. \u00a0The lady serving us was so great interacting with our children and stayed right on top of service we didn't have to wait a long period of time for drinks, salads or food."], ["Adrian Z.", "I came here with friends. The service was good. I ordered calimari and it was fried perfect. The soup of the day was Cream of broccoli which was good. I ordered the Frank Sinatra a house specialty. Our food took forever. I've been in places where the food took awhile and it's usually worth it. This wasn't the case. The sauce was overdone on dish. It was way too salty and the shrimp was over cooked. Overall this place is ok."], ["Michael S.", "What the place lacks in ambience it makes up in excellent, affordable Italian. Bring your own wine."], ["Albert N.", "Food - 1/5Service - 1/5Price - 1/5Atmosphere - 1/5Best Dish: NothingWhat a bust! This location used to be the home of the best Thai food in town (Sticky Rice), and this is what replaces it? Shameful. A few of my buddies and I decided to try this place out. It took us a few weeks to let the pain of Sticky Rice being shut down subside, but we managed to conjure up just enough strength to try it's replacement. We went for lunch because of the big \"Lunch Specials\" banner that is displayed by the entrance. It was an utter disappointment. I know I may be a little biased because of the restaurant that used to be here, but honestly La Sorrentina is very overpriced, and the food is just not that good. The lunch specials are somewhere between 6-8 dollars but I guarantee that you'll leave the place still hungry. I actually went to the McDonald's right next door to pick up some food because it felt like I hadn't eaten anything.I hope La Sorrentina makes it, I really do. I just never see any cars there anymore and I don't know how it can survive without offering students and faculty (St. Mary's University is across the street) a place with good food but most importantly, great value....especially considering all the cheap restaurants and fast food chains right in it's vicinity."], ["Nicolette G.", "I ate at La Sorrentina during its first week of business. While the owner is still ironing out the kinks in the service staff, the food is off to a strong start. My take-away is that it is a good, affordable, simple lunch spot. I ordered a lunch special ($6.99) of Shrimp Oreganata - a fried shrimp with strong seasonings plated on a decorative lettuce leaf and accompanied by a bowl of spaghetti and red sauce. The sauce was simple but satisfying, with signs of fresh garlic cloves and other herbs. The shrimp appeared battered in a pre-made crumbs and seasonings, but I'm not sure. Another person ordered the tilapia lunch special, also served fried and plated. Others at my table ordered the penne pasta in a vodka sauce, which was the hit, saying that the sauce was complex and fresh tasting. We got to sample the sicilian pizza, which also had a complex but light sauce and a nice crispy crust. The crust appeared pre-made, though I can't be sure.Open 7 days a week, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.Affordable lunch specials starting at $4.99Most menu items are in the $8-$11 rangeFree delivery with a $9.00 minimumDiners should expect a $20.00 credit card minimumLarge menuFriendly ownerSmall parking lotRecent renovations to the building."], ["Madeline G.", "My daughter and I visited on a Friday evening. \u00a0The building is setback from the road so be sure to keep your eyes open. \u00a0I at first thought they were closed because there were no cars in the parking lot. \u00a0We started with the fried ravioli which was okay. \u00a0We had the pasta primavera and a chicken dish (sorry don't remember the name) the dishes were good but overpriced for the size. \u00a0We ended the evening with a cannoli. \u00a0Service was good attentive but honestly I didn't feel overly welcomed (considering no other customers were there) I would say the food is good and authentic but overpriced. \u00a0I saw a sign that they offer lunch specials, so they will be back on my list for lunch."], ["Armando B.", "This quaint restuarante is the jewel of San Antonio's Westside. Chef Pepe is a fabulous chef and every dish we have had over the last 6 weeks --and I visit it at least once a week, has been a culinary masterpiece. \u00a0I have to tell you that you will never taste pizza like his--everything fresh and delectable. The shrimp dishes are incredible, especially the Shrimp Frank Sinatra. Try the rib eye and pasta--excellent!The value for the money is unmatched in the city--especially when you factor in that you can take your own favorite wine ( no corking fee) or spirits.We always call ahead for reservations only because they have entertained large parties and have seating for about 40. \u00a0The good news is that they are about to expand their service to their patios.We had a late lunch yesterday that included asparagus soup (fantastic), field greens salad (try their house dressing), lasagna, rib-eye, parmesan-encrusted talapia- the entire party was satisfied beyond compare.Make it a point to visit this charming place."], ["john g.", "Decided to visit this place Saturday afternoon.First, the place is very small. Probably 8 tables, but very cozy and immaculate. Our waitress was very courteous and helpful. Checked on us several times during our visit.I ordered a seafood pasta plate and my companion ordered chicken with penne pasta and veggie plate. The quality of the food was great and the ingredients all appeared to be very fresh. The portions are not overwhelming, so don't expect a big plate. I had a side Caesar Salad, which was also very fresh. We also ordered fried calamari as an appetizer, which was delicious. This was no big deal, but two things I was disappointed in was the small glass for ice tea and the fact that they do not bring a basket of bread. You get one small piece of bread with your plate. For dessert, we each had a slice of tiramisu, which was excellent.I will definitely return during the week to try out one of their $4.99 lunch specials. If you visit, keep your eyes open, as it's easy to miss this location. It's on a small lot which is nestled between two small neighboring businesses. It's directly across the street from St Mary's University."], ["Maria B.", "I had the pleasure of dining here on Saturday with my Mom and sister, and I was pleasantly surprised. While I was skeptical at first, being that it was located off Culebra Rd. in a rather scary part of town, I'm for once glad I didn't heed my inner voice. The restaurant is small, but very clean, well-decorated, and classy. The server was friendly and attentive. While all this was already drawing me in, I was blown away by the food. I had a house salad with blue cheese dressing to start, and the Italian mix of lettuce was crisp, fresh and colorful. I simply could not get enough of it. We also shared a plate of their appetizing cheese bread with marinara sauce which was beautifully arranged and sprinkled with fresh herbs. Next came my entr\u00e9e of cheese ravioli, which was flavorful, fresh and garnished with a beautiful sprig of peppery, sweet basil. For dessert, we had the Tiramisu, which was once again delicious. I have no complaints about this place, but I will comment that if they continue on this path, they will definitely need to expand!"]]}
