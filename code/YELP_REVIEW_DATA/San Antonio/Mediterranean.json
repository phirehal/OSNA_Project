{"Jerusalem Grill": [["Russ F.", "Great place to stop in for a quick takeout lunch. $5.95 for a gyro (or shawarma, or kebab sandwich) and fries + a can of soda came out to $7.50ish after tax. The pita is always fresh pressed, the gyro meat is heated right before its put on the sandwich, and they give you a side of tzatiki so you can administer it yourself to cut down on the messiness. The fries are thick cut steak fries and normally piping hot at lunch time. I walked in, placed my order and was walking out under 5 minutes and they actually apologized for the wait. Staff is super friendly as you are warmly greeted and bid farewell when you leave. I did wish the gyro came with more than 2 half slices of tomato and a few strands of onion though. That was the only minor problem. I also once came here and asked for the gyro platter mistakenly, thinking gyro + fries = platter but it actually is just the gyro meat, grilled pita on the side, greek salad and an order of fries. It is more expensive ($8.95), but it is at least enough for 2 meals."], ["Krystle D.", "First the good. The shwarma, chicken kebab, rice, and Jerusalem salad were AMAZING. Loved it. Portions are large and the value is good. The one off note was that both the hummus and Lentil soup were oversalted. The soup, inedibly so. That said, at just the mention of the saltiness that staff responded by offering free dessert. We really were not expecting that and were pleasantly surprised.We would definitely go back."], ["Tab E.", "Far from me personally but loved my first time here and have been back several times since.

But to agree with me is to allow key things to first be explained.Arrival and seating -- Depending on the time of day, you will either be immediately greeted at the door and seated -OR- able to sit anywhere you'd like. If the latter, just shout a warm greeting to the guys at the grill... they'll send someone over with a menu in no time.Ordering -- It's straightforward; however, prices for SOME of the plates do in fact run high. My go-to continues to be the Vegetable Plate (i.e. huge servings of pita, tabbouleh, houmous, cucumber-tomato salad, Greek olives, feta cheese, falafel, and dolmas). Of course, the Turkish Coffee is one for the books here... finish up with a cup or two, plus some hookah out in the very spacious front courtyard.Payment -- Yet again depending on the time of day, you will either pay at your table -OR- at the register near the dessert table. My most recent dine-ins have had me simply packing myself a nice box of baklava and paying for everything right at the front before walking out. Good stuff.Don't let other reviews, namely the negative ones, deter you from giving this place your business. When a restaurant's \"style\" or \"setup\" differs slightly from the norm, chill out, go with the flow, and enjoy yourself! Personally, I haven't experienced a single visit in which any of the staff weren't totally chill and talkable. So eat on, folks!

All of the food was delicious but I especially LOVED the hummus with the meat... I could not stop eating it! The grape leaves were simply OK (i've had better elsewhere, but they were not bad). The smoked (?) eggplant was tasty, but the texture was a tad slimy for my liking. Falafel was the best the hubs said he's ever had... and he's been to the ME!

The meat had a wonderful spice that went well with the rice and other sides. The hummus was tangy, just how I like it. It's my favorite thing on their menu. I only gave it four stars due to the lack of cleanliness. There was a sticky feeling on the chair, tables and in the air. The decorations consisted of trees and rugs that needed major dusting.

Delicious :)"], ["Chris A.", "Jerusalem Grill has a lot of competition in San Antonio which means we have lots of choices. Unfortunately, Jerusalem Grill would not be my first choice.I ate the beef kebabs which I found to be under seasoned and a bit on the dry side but tasty nonetheless. If possible I might suggest using a fattier meat because, as we all know, fat is flavor. The hummus was quite nice and had a good flavor when mixed with the olive oil pooled in its center. The slightly seasoned rice was nice but I was just desiring something to mix in to it as a binder, like curry at an Indian joint. We received peta bread with our meals but I found it to be too thin, too chewy, and cold. My wife ate the vegetarian plate which I sampled. The falafel was nice but was spicy. It wasn't inedible spicy, but was unlike any falafel I've ever eaten before. Falafel is always dry so the humus was nice to add to it as a lubricant. The stuffed grape leaves were bitter and thick. I've never liked stuffed grape leaves to begin with. I also tried the baklava but considering my sweet tooth, I'd probably eat a shoe provided it had the proper amount of sugar. The baklava was nice but a bit tougher than usual. This in no way deterred my progress in downing the dessert. Overall, it was standard tasting baklava.So, the meal came to about $28 - not too bad. However, for that price, I'd recommend Al Bustan on Fredericksburg which offers up a Middle Eastern buffet for lunch and dinner at a cheaper price. Also, check out Pasha Mediterranean Restaurant. I've never had a bad meal at Pasha.Yeah, I would go back to Jerusalem Grill but it would not be my first choice."], ["Crystal M.", "First, get the HUMMUS!!! Best hummus ever!!! So delicious.Alright, so I LOVE Jerusalem grill and have been a fan ever since the first time I went here. The service has always been nice to me. I love their kabobs. All of them... Chicken is the best, then lamb, then steak! I always get their plates and though they are like $15, it comes with plenty of food! When I fist came here, my friend and I split the big order with like 5 sides, 3 meats... It is a meal for two, around $35. I got it mainly to try all of their appetizers and meat items. I tried their grape leaves, not really my thing, but they are alright. I like their fried cauliflower, tabouleh salad, and labneh. I also tried their grilled fish (tilapia plate) which was good too.Their coffee is exquisite. I also like their baklava, super sweet though.

You won't be either. The server was excellent too!!"], ["Chris L.", "In our search for a good place with lamb on the menu we decided to try Jerusalem Grill one evening. We also chose this place because they're open late on the weekends. On our first trip we decided to order the mixed grill for two. The mixed grill comes with 3 kabobs, 5 appetizers, rice and pita. Since we had not been eating beef, we decided to order two lamb and one chicken kabob with our order. Of the appetizers we ordered hummus, grape leaves, fried cauliflower, mahamara and Jerusalem salad. I guess I'll start with the appetizers...Hands down they make the best hummus I've ever had with a distinct flavor that I've not had anywhere else. The mahamara is a slightly spicy red pepper and garlic puree that we are now addicted to. The Jerusalem salad is a mix of diced veggies in a lemony dressing that is so refreshing. The grape leaves totally satisfied my craving for dolma with their nice flavor and texture, but the piece de resistance of these appetizers was the fried cauliflower served at room temperature. I'm not too picky about vegetables, but cauliflower has never been on the to of my list. This item was a delightful surprise that I find myself craving very frequently now. The chicken kabobs are always cooked prefect and the lamb is by far the best lamb I've ever had, all served on a hot sizzling plate with onion, tomato and squash. If you like Mediterranean food this is the place to go. We love bringing our friends and family here to share the experience of having such a wonderful feast of a dinner. If that's not enough, then just order the family dinner for 4 and be prepared for a food coma with extra items like their incredibly light and tasty falafel and savory shawarma. You won't regret coming here, that's for sure!"], ["Don N.", "Bodybuilding 101 food. Even though the only thing I'm lifting is those kabobs into my mouth. \u00a0Delicious juicy flavorful chicken and lamb. \u00a0Hummus is creamy and amazing. \u00a0The pita bread isn't as good as pashas but I think the meat here is better and faster service without the busy crowd and Wurzbach I-10 traffic around pashas. \u00a0They also have a reputation for giving me free baklava dessert as I sit in my chair completely stuffed as I doze off into a food coma. \u00a0Open late too!"], ["Carl B.", "Unfortunately, we where really disappointed with the Jerusalem Grill. When my family and I arrived around 8pm it was pretty quiet, we where happy about that. However once we sat down there where flies that wouldn't go away, our drinks where served with like 2 ice cubes each, no alcoholic beverages, the service was marginal at best, drinks stayed empty, empty plates stayed on the table, and our server for the most part was an absentee even though there where only a few customers present that night.Because of the high rating on yelp we figured they would win is over with the food, we where sadly mistaken. When the food arrived my wife's chicken kebab was raw, my son's chicken nuggets where burnt, and my shawarma was just ok. When the server finally made it back to our table he replaced the the raw chicken and the new one was ok. The hummus was decent and the location is convenient but I was not very happy with much else. Think I could give this place one more chance but probably not for a while."], ["Jillian W.", "My husband was telling me about this place since he works close by and he finally took me and it was very good.

The walls are decorated with murals of Jerusalem, and the background ethnic music added a nice touch without being overly cheesy. My friend and I shared the sampler platter and ended up trying a couple of different appetizers.

It's a massive portion, all very fresh and tasty. I would ask for extra sauce on the side, as they put an ample amount in my wrap but the flavor was a bit lost with all of the other ingredients.Service was friendly and helpful, making conversation and allowing me to take Yelp photos during the ordering process.

When I saw this restaurant on Yelp I knew I wanted to try it and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I went here today for a late lunch and we were greeted promptly by the staff. They were very friendly and answered our questions about the menu. The restaurant was very clean and has a nice atmosphere inside. When we went there were only two other parties dining in but I'm sure once word gets out that there will be more people soon. You order at the counter and choose your toppings (kind of like Subway or Freebirds) for either a kebap, wrap or salad. They have beef and lamb, chicken, falafel and veggie patties (so something for everyone). My boyfriend had the regular size kebap with beef and lamb and the Red Hot toppings: cabbage, tomato, jalapeno, red bell pepper and Spicy Red and Hot Sauce. He said on a scale of 1-4, it has a burn rating of about a 3 (so the name \"Red Hot\" is definitely true). I ordered the snack size kebap with beef and lamb and then chose my own toppings: spring mix, corn, tomatoes, red bell pepper, cucumbers and garlic sauce (YUM).

Hot, crispy, nicely seasoned and delicious! Besides everything tasting absolutely awesome, we only paid $20 for the two of us and the cashier gave us coupons for our next visit.

You can read my first review to see what D\u00f6ner Kebabs mean to me (yelp.com/biz/vertskebap-\u2026). The bottom line is that this Turkish-German street food played a major role in my formative years as a young GI in Cold-War Berlin. This is a food I love and associate with many great memories. I'm sure a lot of servicemembers feel the same way.But San Antonio is a major military town, which means that Verts may find itself subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny than they are used to. There are plenty of people here who have lived in Germany. They know what a D\u00f6ner Kebab is and how it should be served. And these people will pick up on certain deficiencies.For starters, the bread--while better than most pitas--is wrong. The Fladenbrot that they use in Berlin is much thicker and more luxurious than the panini-pressed gordita pita that Verts offers. The real deal is more like a soft ciabatta (marions-kochbuch.de/reze\u2026). Can Verts really not find a supplier to make something like this?Secondly, no mayonnaise is available for the French fries. That may sound weird to people who have never lived in Germany, but this is an absolute must-have for the German Imbiss (snack-bar) experience. Rather than make excuses that people aren't asking for mayonnaise, Verts should be educating its customers. They could make Pommes mit Mayo \"a thing\"--something that sets them apart from other restaurants.I checked out this new Verts location and found the food good, but I am disappointed that the company has completely moved away from the original stated vision. There are no longer any references in the store to the \"Berlin-inspired\" roots of the business or indeed to the actual words D\u00f6ner Kebab. Many people are referring to this as some kind of \"Greek\" Chipotle. Maybe that's the plan.I'll keep going to Verts because the food is good and it's as close to a proper D\u00f6ner Kebab as I'm going to find. But it could be so much better with just a few tweaks.

Her very cold, non-apologetic response \"no, I can not scrape off any new ones until I give you these\". On top of getting left over/somewhat warm tasting chicken, 2 of the falafels we ordered were stuck together during frying so the center on each were barely heated. My request for refrying of 2 falafel was granted however. I don't think we will return for $20 worth of fast food that is supposed to be fresh and easy. I rather go to Panda Express because at least I get to request for hot and fresh ingredients when their food pans are not nearly as empty at any hour of the day! Two star for refrying the falafel, otherwise one star for serving people old meat when there are much more fresh ones available!"], ["Sara S.", "Great kebobs, okay prices.

An expensive waffle or tortilla filled with goopy sauces over tasteless meat? It is not German. It is not Arabic. It is not anything but a messy expensive sandwich.

Well done!"], ["Jules G.", "The effort to bring this to San Antonio is great...the food, not so much. Had the lamb/beef and it was TOUGH! This is nothing like the real thing you find abroad.

All together a strange experience. Good luck!"], ["Victoria D.", "Came here with my brothers to try it out and definitely had an enjoyable experience! I ordered the chicken wrap which was very flavorful and tasty. Wasn't too impressed with the falafel because it had been overcooked and a little too crunchy/crispy for my liking.

I was taken back, because I hadn't been previously charged. I questioned the server and she said the owner Norman insisted on charging. Apparently, it's stated on the menu, but I haven't ever looked for it, because I always order the same thing and don't look at the menu. Obviously my fault. I much rather have the prices raised a $.25 than nickel and dime patrons for stupid hot sauce that cost $2.25 for 12 oz. Next they'll be charging for to go cups and boxes.I spoke to Norman, the owner, since we know each other. He was indignant about the fee. He said other restaurants charge $.75. And I know other restaurants, where it's FREE...I'm very disappointed considering I've been a long time regular customer. I certainly can afford the $1.00 they charged for two. It's just the frivolous nature that bugs me.Sadly, his attitude left me with a bad taste, I doubt I'll return.I wish them well..."], ["Chris A.", "At Zorbas Greek Mediterranean Cuisine you get that ominous feeling like showing up on a Tuesday for dinner and an \"Out of Business\" sign being hastily taped to the window. I hope that doesn't happen until the owners are ready to retire because they have a decent product. However, they also have some shortcomings that need to be addressed.First, let me say that our meals at Zorbas were quite tasty. The salad was just ok, but I found the gyro and chicken plate quite tasty. My wife got 2 kebabs with falafel. While she enjoyed the kebabs, the falafel were very dry and required constant lubrication via the garlic-yoghurt or whatever it was, dipping sauce that came with each meal. The pita was warm when it came out which is always nice but the hummus was a bit thin, although tasty.Overall, this is a nice Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood. The food is pretty good but the one server/waitress seemed overworked which resulted in inconsistent service such as having to wait over 10 minutes for a tea refill. When we asked for the check, she decided to partially clean a table that had been vacated before we entered the restaurant. The check came about 10 minutes after the request. If the economics support it, Zorbas needs at least one additional wait staff during peak meal hours in order to provide better and more consistent service as well as to lessen any miscommunication with orders. I would recommend Zorbas and would eat there again if I was hankering for a kebab and was in the neighborhood. If they address the aforementioned issues, I think Zorbas could do some fine business."], ["Brian K.", "3.5 stars. A no frills Greek restaurant with friendly service.I got a combo plate for $13.

Let's just say in the picture there is way more cheese then you actually get, I think we got a sprinkle of feta and lots of seasoning. For my meal I ended up getting the mezza plate, which comes with a little of everything. The falafel was good, the hummus was ok, the baba ganouj was a little too bitter, the pita was cold when it came to the table and seemed store bought which is fine I know how long it takes to make homemade pita. I so wasn't a fan of the grape leaves, it had a very strong vinegar taste to it. My husband got the beef kebab pita with was a very good size and came with fries. For the most part he liked it.

Firstly it was COMPLETELY EMPTY. We reached about an hr before the closing time and quickly ordered the food which was the Mezza Plater and the chicken kebab meal. The baba ghanoui was pretty decent and so was the falafal. However, the pita bread was rubbery and store bought. Hummus - very average. the chicken in the chicken kebab meal was again extremely rubbery and had a weird taste (like that of coniac !!!) the side salad was below average. The thing that pissed us the most was that DURING the time we were eating our meal the main guy (maybe the manager), came & closed the tv and started to put all the chairs up side down on the tables (like they do when they close). i mean dude u could hv waited till the time we finished our meal.

I do not recall if we were charged for more, though.For my entree, I selected the chicken schwarma, which is my favorite. Was a little disappointed with the sauce provided- it was minimal at best and relatively flavorless. Wasn't particularly digging how the meat was already sandwiched for me rather than served separate for self assembly, but that wasn't a huge strike against the order or anything. \u00a0Meat was well seasoned and moist enough to be eaten alone, but if that was what I wanted to do I would have ordered kabobs. \u00a0The hummus was tasty, but it's one of those things that I feel is pretty hard to screw up to begin with, so you won't really hear me raving about it.My date ordered some sort of beef kabobs if I recall correctly, and he consumed it all without any criticisms other than saying he liked the rice.We decided to splurge and go for dessert also, and ordered the baklava- which was served cold and almost impossible to cut or eat iwth a fork or knife, so ended up being a tasty mess that we ate in layers. Kind of lost some points there, to be honest.Not really sure if I'll be back- I was not really wowed by anything. Everything was just okay. Service was also kind of slow, for some reason we only saw one employee and he was out of sight often enough for it to be plausible that he was also cooking.If oyu're in the area and in the mood for Greek, go ahead and try it, but if you have options I'd go elsewhere for chicken schwarma."], ["Kristina M.", "Very good mezza plate, but the staff seems overwhelmed when there are more than 3 tables occupied. \u00a0Very nice place to bring your own wine or beer. \u00a0Chicken shawarma is also a favorite."], ["Allie C.", "I found this great place thanks to YelpI went for lunch and got spanakopita \u00a0and a beef and lamb gyro and both were greatThe tzatziki sauce is really goodVery authentic place.

You are one of the chosen.Besides boosting your self esteem, Zorba's will also boost your pleasure. I ordered a chicken gyro plate, which came with some delicious yellow rice, hummus, and a Mediterranean salad. It ran me $10 and I also ordered a deliciously weird Arabic drink that tasted like black cherry soda but with absolutely no after taste. It was there and then gone, making you wonder if you in fact had actually sipped it at all. You might be thinking, Gee, Allison, this place sounds terrific, but small places can sometime lack on the service. Well, friends, you are not going to be disappointed here. Our waitress was super nice and quick and my husband approved of her service so much that he left a pretty fat tip (he is of the \"vote-with-your-tip\" persuasion).

BTW...you can purchase wine from the local Shell gas station and take it in..."], ["Karen C.", "Given the other reviews, I am not what happened on the day I went to Zorba's. Based on my one experience, here is my review:Skip it. Here's why. The atmosphere is non-existent. Sticky linoleum floors. Plastic yellow tablecloths, covered by longer clear plastic tablecloths. I know sometimes in a family owned restaurant all the money is put into the food. I have had some pretty amazing food in some pretty suspect looking places. But since the food was not great, the atmosphere only adds to the reasons not to go back. And did I mention the sticky floors?Sticky floors are nasty, but the thing that really threw me over the edge was the baba ganouj. Baba ganouj is a roasted eggplant dip with lemon and tahini (roasted sesame sauce) topped with olive oil and in Zorba's case sumac (per the owner, besides the lemon, tahini and eggplant, this was the only other ingredient he was willing to give up in what was by the look on his face obviously his super secret special recipe) - apparently some recipes, according to my limited research, can also include mint, cumin or coriander, none of which I tasted in Zorba's version. The baba ganouj from Zorba's came highly recommended from a number of sources so I was excited to try it for the first time. I really like the main ingredients - eggplant, lemon and tahini. Plus, baba ganouj (pronounced ganoosh) is fun to say, even though to me it sounds more like a term of endearment for a small infant.I'm at a bit of a loss since I really wanted to like it, but it actually tasted like....it kills me a little to say this...an ashtray. Don't ask me how I know what an ashtray tastes like...things happened in college that I can't begin to explain or completely remember. But that is exactly what the aftertaste was. At first, the taste was just a very bland, smooth eggplant puree...then BAM - ashtray...and then, an instant later that startling flavor was gone. Not believing what we had just tasted, we'd go back again. And there it was again...ASHTRAY. Really weird. Since I had no point of reference, having never tried baba ganouj before, I thought maybe this is how it was supposed to taste. So later that evening I googled Baba ganouj. Apparently, the dip can be extremely bitter (but frankly, this was way beyond bitter) if not properly prepared. Otherwise baba ganouj is by all accounts extremely tasty. I cannot imagine this can be mistaken. I mean, I can't imagine anyone tasting the flavor of the baba ganouj we had and mistaking that for tasty. Thus leading me to believe that, at least on this day, Zorba's just had bad baba ghanouj. Interestingly, I also Googled baba ganouj and ashtray - and I actually came up hits - with people complaining that the baba ganouj they had at some restaurant tasted like an ashtray. Pretty crazy. Others know what an ashtray tastes like too! But wait...maybe it is how baba ganouj is supposed to taste? I'm still confused (and also very afraid to ever try it again).Okay...just don't order the baba ganouj. Right? Well, despite the falafel being decent, good with a little more lemon and little more spice than the Food Shark version (The Marfalafel at Food Shark is still hands down the best), and the gyro tasting okay; those items were ultimately nothing special. Not special enough to get me to go back to Zorba's anyway. Although...I will sort of miss the strangely friendly, somewhat mysterious Jordanian owner who, thinking back on it now, had on a couple of occasions during our meal gone out in front of the restaurant to smoke a cigarette.

I'm a big fan of falafel and a lot of places get it either too mushy or over cooked where it's hard. Gypsy got it just right. The portion size was very generous and I had leftovers to take with me. The hummus and pita bread was great too. If you just want a small snack while you smoke that would be the perfect dish.

It was fine hookah, but not my favorite establishment."], ["Sara V.", "We enjoyed their more high end selection of shisha and the atmosphere was pleasant with good music. \u00a0All the couches were reserved while we were there which I'm sure would have been way more comfortable than the table and chairs. \u00a0They only serve beer and wine and they have a decent selection. \u00a0After 9pm the place was packed and bumping. \u00a0What we didn't enjoy was the food, service, and smoking indoors limitations. \u00a0I ordered chicken and my husband got lamb and both of our meats were extremely overcooked. \u00a0Most of my chicken was actually burnt through to the bone and my husband's lamb was like trying to chew leather. \u00a0Our waitress was super friendly but we didn't see her much. \u00a0When we arrived we were one of three small tables in the entire place and it took almost 30 minutes to get our order of a hookah and a bottle of wine. \u00a0And apparently you can't smoke a hookah inside until a certain time at night. \u00a0which we found strange since this is mainly a hookah bar. \u00a0If you are in the mood to smoke a hookah, drink some wine, and listen to good music then you may want to check this place out. \u00a0But I won't recommend eating there and bring a jacket because you may have to sit outside until they decide to let you smoke the hookah indoors."], ["Mischelle S.", "My boyfriend & our friends wanted to try a new place to smoke hookah so we tried this place out.

She kindly explained to us that if we wanted to smoke hookah we could only smoke it outside that night & we said its alright but we wanted to eat there first.Their menu consisted of Mediterranean food & they didn't have much choices. I got the Chicken Shawarma w/ fries & my boyfriend got the beef & lamb Gyro w/ fries. One thing I didn't like was our order came out about 20-25 minutes later. My chicken in the Shawarma was very dry but I really LOVE their fries though. 5 stars for the fries! The environment was clean & well decorated. It had a lot of antiques, pictures of gypsy's & belly dancers, & the place was colorful. It was a very interesting and relaxing environment. The menu they had for hookah flavors had more choices than their food menu. Our hookah flavor had the flavors of Sex on the Beach, Blue mist, and Blueberry mixed together & it was GREAT! You can really tell they use great quality flavors cause the flavor lasted a very long time & while we were sitting outside they had different colored lights beaming at us & they had really good music playing. Pricing was fair. It was about $7 a meal & $16 for one set of hookah. My experience here was okay, I enjoyed smoking the hookah than eating the food. I'll definitely come back here again to try different flavors."], ["Kathryn M.", "The Gypsy Cage has an upbeat party environment. Nice atmosphere, music at a reasonable level. The staff is polite, attentive and curtious. I ordered the lamb shish kabob and it was a bit too over seasoned and spicy but had the perfect consistency.

I definitely will visit this place again."], ["Alisa R.", "I went to Gypsy Cafe on Friday night about 8pm. It was mildly busy, and had I not had children in tow, I would have found a place to sit just fine. Smoking hookah starts after 9pm, so we could have sat down with a piece of cheesecake and had a latte while the smoking stayed outside. I opted out and just asked the people a few questions, took a look around and left. Belly Dancing Saturday nights? Um, I am in. Reserved spots for Hookah smokers? What does that mean - it must be special. The menu looked incredible with vegan options and yummy hot drinks. We looked for a sitter but found no one. Next time we don't have the kids, we are hitting up Gypsy's. It is too cool for school."], ["Kim C.", "I enjoy the atmosphere of Gypsy and what it has to offer, but the service could use some improvement.A few friends and I decided to smoke hookah on a Monday night. \u00a0We arrived around 9:30pm and the patio was getting crowded but not too full. \u00a0We sat outside, ordered two pipes and about 30 minutes later were delivered pipes with ice tips. \u00a0My husband and I ordered the Turkish Delight and our friends ordered a blend of cherry and vanilla. \u00a0Although the hookah was very good, our pipe was slightly broken (the ice tip kept falling off), and although we mentioned this to our server and she said that she would send someone out to fix it, it was never fixed.We stayed until about midnight and only once did someone check to see if our coals needed to be changed or added. \u00a0Will we return? \u00a0Sure, but probably because the other options are worse."], ["VW S.", "I always go with my family and friends and we love this place !!

The babaganoosh was good as was the humus ... though both could have used more seasoning. The lamb cabobs were really well seasoned, but this was obviously cheap lamb as it was a little tough and had stringy bits. And my partners shwarma was kinda bland. The rice was really good. Seems like they are concentraiting more on being a hooka bar than serving great food. That's a shame since Turkish and Morocan food are SO under-represented in San Antonio.

I walked in around 7 and found it easy to find a place to sit. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come ask us what we wanted to drink and bring us a menu. My boyfriend and I let it slide since we assumed she was the only person working the tables and there were 4 other tables of people. As it turns out there were several people working, all just standing around the kitchen apparently. We ordered our drinks, the tea tasted like it was made in the morning and had been sitting out all day. Either that or they made it with dish water. After we got our drinks, it took the waitress another 10 minutes or so to come back and take our order. We ordered hummus as an appetizer and two gyros. Simple enough for a mediteranean cusine right. The hummus came out 25 minutes later, and the gyros 30 minutes after that. Seriously, I know this isn't fast food but I didn't think it was reasonable to spend almost an hour to get our order. The food was ok, but I left feeling like I could've driven downtown and eaten at Demo's and been much more satisfied.

I didn't know whether to order the beef/lamb gyro or the pork gyro so the owner recommended the pork gyro. I ordered the green rice with Lima beans as the side order. We prob waited less than 5 min to get our food. The gyro was overstuffed with meat. I could have prob made two gyros with all the meat that was stuffed in my gyro. The meat was a little spicy but very good. Yummy! Needless to say I ate the whole gyro. Their tea was great too. It had a fragrant flavor. I really don't know how to describe the flavor but it tasted great. I kind of thought the hummus was kind of salty but my husband loved it (and he's picky with his hummus).As for appearance, the restaurant was really clean. I liked the ambiance.

So far, I would call the combo plate the best meal deal, and the perfect order is with gyro lamb beef and the (spicy) pork, black eyed pea rice, and the side salad.

This restaurant serves Mediterranean food and Persian food. For this review, I will be covering what I consider Mediterranean food, since I didn't try the foods specifically listed as Persian and have no distinct Persian experience to reference. I tried the chicken kebabs, gyro meat, lamb shank, and lamb kebabs. The meat was moist and flavorful. The spices uses were evident in the taste, unlike other places that don't have a similar full bodied flavor. The lamb shank was \"fall off the bone\" soft, juicy, and perfect in temperature. The food took about 10 min and you just pick it up when they ring a bell. You order food at the front, like a cafeteria. The meal comes with pita bread and yogurt/garlic/cucumber dip. The bread tastes fresh and soft, while the dip has a creamy fresh flavor, a hint of garlic and cucumber. Not as strong as the Greek tzatziki. \u00a0A small side salad and choice of three rices are available. I chose the green lentil one, which was a punch of delicious flavor. The black eyed peas one was also very delicious, though more hearty. The only sadness I experienced was the baklava, which did not taste homemade. I would not recommend ordering it. An assortment of pickled garlic and drinks were available. I tried the regular yogurt drink and its taste was similar to a liquid, salted cottage cheese.

I'm sorry, but you can get a much better quality gyro for the same amount of money. I think my opinion is biased because I live in Vancouver where the choices for these restaurants are bountiful.

The dining room is painted up to look like you're lounging in the Italian or Turkish coast. Interesting pictures of random Middle Easterners set the tone for a vary cultured meal. The staff was very nice, and let us sample the pickled garlic, which was quite good. I had never had pickled garlic before this, but was quite glad I tried it. It wasn't as overpowering as fresh garlic, it had a more subtle taste. They had multiple sauces to take out to the table, so keep an eye for that if you dine in.

Delicious Mediterranean on the southside? You jest, Old Man!!!\" \u00a0(Full disclosure: I didn't really say that. I probably said something more like \"oh, ok.\")So, I voyaged down SW Military. Just past the point where I thought I should turn around and head back to the highway that I'm more familiar with, I saw it - a gleaming beacon of gyros in a converted Arby's building. I parked in the small parking lot up front and headed in.Since that day, I've been back multiple times, and am always recruiting new people from my office to give it a shot. I always eat a gyro. It is always delicious. The gyro meat (beef and lamb) is tender and has a wonderful flavor, the white sauce is super mild and tasty, and the giant steak fries that come with the sandwich are, well, giant steak fries. My lunch dates always testify that their meals of kabob plates and chicken gyros are delicious as well. If you feel like you need an appetizer, give the baba ghanoush a try - it's awesome and fresh, with little chunks of eggplant throughout to remind you that, yes, it is made from real veggies. It's served with naan that is cooked perfectly.Every time I've stopped by, the owner is manning the register and the kitchen. The dining room is always at least half full, yet the wait for food is always pretty short. The food is extremely reasonably priced, too. If you're in the area, you have to give this place a try... and if you're not in the area, well, get to the area!

Walked in, saw no one at the counter, heard someone moving around in the back. Stood there a couple minutes more, observing that the place was less than clean. Finally a disheveled and gruff looking older gent made his way from the back with a \"What do you want?\" look on his face. Sigh...didnt have time to leave and go elsewhere, just decided to order to go. Ordered the lamb gyro and a Greek salad. Took forever to get the food, paid and left. When I got back to work with my food and opened the containers, my heart sank. The lamb looked like thick,dry pieces of Steak-Um, and was bland and chewy and tasted a little \"off\" (sorta gamey and perhaps freezer-burned). The Greek salad was horrendous! Huge uneven chunks of cucumber, NO OLIVES WHATSOEVER, and a pitiful amount of feta cheese drowned in an oily, tasteless liquid which I assumed was supposed to be dressing.I couldn't eat any of it, threw both items in the trash. What a terrible experience, will definitely never make THAT mistake again.Worst part is, I'm really not a picky eater at all!"], ["Jeffrey M.", "I had the Persian beef stew lunch special.

(And very reasonably priced for a side of 5 at $2.50ish) The staff was friendly, and they had a free side and drink deal with the first check-in on Yelp! Yay! The selection of fresh Mediterranean toppings was quite thorough, and they had several sauces to choose from (although I do think some of the sauce was a bit lacking in flavor... usually with Mediterraneans, when something says 'garlic'.. it means you're going to be smelling like it for two days.... but not here, which may be good for some people.) Anyway, if this place had wifi, I would give it 5 stars..."], ["Ariel C.", "I LOVE Garbanzos - it's pretty much Chiptole for Mediterranean food.

They hand you a falafel sample as you walk up to the counter, I rarely turn that puppy down, tons of flavor, right amounts of crisp with a dense warm inside. The hummus is very tahini- heavy, not my favorite. The meats are drier than you'd expect, but with all the sauce offerings, there isn't too much room for complaints. The plate option gets you the most bang for your buck. Prices aren't too steep, I tend to spend more here than at real Chipotle, they have these awesome house-made lemonade mixtures that are probably what tip the scale.

Though the name is \"mediterranean\" grill, it seems a bit more Israeli.As we walked in, we were offered samples of the falafel- it's not the best but it was okay. Boyfriend, who has much higher standards, said it was awful, but I think he was overstating things. In any case, I ordered more as a side and though he didn't eat them, I did.Bf ordered the laffa with chicken schwarma- it basically looks like a giant burrito, and is warmed in a giant tortilla press, not unlike Chipotle. In fact, the entire set up reminds me of a slightly ethnic Chipotle, but I digress.Laffa was filled with hummus, tabbouli, lettuce, tomato and cucumber salad, the chicken, cabbage, and a few other tasty goodies, then he was offered sauces- and went with the tatziki. Said his food was delish, and consumed it all, complete with a soda and an apple (one of their sides).I went a bit more all-out and got the chicken kabobs (originally wanted half and half, which I was told was okay, but then the guy manning the grill said it would be 20 minutes and he didn't seem thrilled about it, so I let it go) with sides of hummus and the cucumber-tomato salad, then subbed tabbouli for the rice and added the aforementioned falafel. This all came with a pita bread, which neither of us ate but it smelled good. The chicken was a little dry but the grilled veggies were amazing and had a great char on them. Other sides were fresh and flavorful, as mentioned before.The only downside to our visit was that customer service was a little lacking- as I referenced above, the guy working the grill seemed put off that I wanted to order an item that wasn't ready yet. Nevermind the fact that we walked in at 6:30, which should be right in the middle of a dinner rush at any dining establishment. The other two employees were young girls, and while they didn't actually do anything wrong, they were a little immature and I was frankly surprised not to see anyone older- if anything, the surly male appeared to potentially be the closest thing to a manager, which does not at all reflect well. In short, customer service was lacking but food was fresh and tasty.We'll be back- want to try the salad, maybe one of the soups, and perhaps a laffa of my own one of these days."], ["Joe A.", "Delicious food. Awesome, helpful, upbeat employees. If you've never been to Garbanzo, check them out. Think \"fast-food Mediterranean\" but without all of the fast-food guilt. I like to have my laffa packed with steak shawarma, rice, hummus, lettuce, tahini, sometimes baba ghanoush, and definitely feta 'cause feta is betta! You can never go wrong with a free falafel sample right when you walk in. I swear I think they pull them fresh out of the fryer right as you arrive, they're always so hot and crispy. Sure, you can go to any other restaurant that serves up the same delicious goodies, but the point of Garbanzo is to be FAST and efficient, and I always make it here and back to work well before my hour for lunch has ended. The location is ultra convenient, in a nice shopping center (Huebner Oaks) and the place is practically brand new since the upkeep is amazing and the restaurant is always super clean.

The food is reasonably healthy and there are a decent amount of choices. They typically have four types of soups: two, served daily, are the lentil or lemon chicken with orzo while they rotate out garbanzo bean stew or roasted eggplant. For a main dish, you choose either a plate, wrap, or pita (white or whole wheat). Then you choose whatever protein (chicken shawarma, chicken/falafel, steak, steak/falafel, falafel, portabello mushroom, hummus) and add-ins (hummus, baba ganoush, various sauces, and various salads) you want. You can make it a meal with a drink and garbanzo chips, 5 falafels, 4 dolmas, or an apple. For drinks, they do have delicious choices including hibiscus mango tea, pomegranate lemonade, or mint lemonade (which is my preference).The service is patient, helpful, and quick.

Basically a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. This is not a bad thing.2. Food is very tasty. DO get the dolmas. DO put hummus on your pita or wrap. DON'T get the kalamata olives.3. Reason it didn't get more than 3 stars is because a lot of the menu items were not ready to be served, including their prominently featured soup. I attribute this to the fact that I came here on New Year's day at 9pm. I will be back, because I expect the negative things to improve if I visit on a normal day.4. One steak pita + one steak pita combo which came with dolmas and a fountain drink = $19. Probably a bit steep, but not horrible.Full review below:Came here at 9pm on New Year's Day. Probably not the best timing, but I wanted to try something new.Immediately upon walking through the door, I got the impression that this was simply a Mediterranean version of Chipotle. Turns out that was a pretty accurate guess.First, you choose how you want your Mediterranean food to be prepared. You get the choice of a Pita (like a hollowed out tortilla), a wrap or a plate There is also a skewer plate, but it felt like \u00a0a secondary menu item and I didn't even factor it into my decision. The guy behind the counter suggested that my girlfriend and I get the plate since we were first-timers, but we both got the Pita because WDGAF. The menu tells you the calorie count of each item, which I thought was nifty.The bread for the wrap and the pita can be either white or wheat. They were out of white, so we had to go with wheat. I would have ordered the wheat anyway, but it really irked me that they could be out of white pita bread at all.Next you choose your protein. If memory serves you have the choice of chicken, steak, either one of those with falafel, just falafel, portobello mushroom or hummus. Being the adventurous diners that we are, we both picked steak. At this point, the employee peered into the ingredient trays and realized they were out of steak. One of the employees scurried into the back room to grab two delicious-looking slices of steak and toss them on the grill. We were told it would be about 5 additional minutes for the steak to cook. This was fine, and I chalked it up to the fact that it was New Year's day.After this, you select your ingredients just like you would at Chipotle. Lettuce, vegetable mix, hummus (definitely get the hummus), and so on and so forth. There are some ingredients that cost extra. I opted for the kalamata olives and the feta cheese. I do recommend getting the cheese, but I will avoid the olives next time. They were very salty and each bite with an olive was completely and totally overwhelmed by salty olive flavor. On their menu was a huge ad for some tomato/feta soup. It sounded pretty tasty and it was a chilly night, so we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, they were out of the soup, too. The employee said \"I can give you some but it will be cold.\" which was kind of a poor effort in my opinion. I opted not to get it, and was feeling increasingly annoyed by the lack of preparation despite the fact that it was a holiday.I got the combo, which comes with a fountain drink (Pepsi products...WHY does any restaurant do this?) and a side of your choice. I picked the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).We sat down and waited for a while since our steak was still cooking. We took this moment to discuss how doofus-y the staff was, but that we ought to cut them some slack since it is New Year's day. They brought us our food, but failed to bring the dolmas, which I pointed out and they promptly corrected. The pitas were excellent, but I would have been more content if the ingredients were more evenly distributed throughout the pita. All of the steak and tzatziki sauce was stacked right at the opening of the pita. After that came the rice, then the vegetable mix, olives and lettuce. The hummus was spread throughout, which helped make up for the distribution problem because it was delicious. The dolmas were top-notch. I could have eaten ten.Overall, our experience here was positive. Far from perfect, but definitely not bad. Had we visited on a busy day, my guess is that our food would have been ready about as quickly as I could order it. Flavor-wise, the pita's were very satisfying, except for the preposterously salty olives, and like I said, the dolmas were very, very good. The $19 price point was a bit high, but not enough to turn me off. We will be coming back with higher expectations."], ["Timothy H.", "First went to one in Colorado Springs, CO and didn't realize it was a chain until hearing about one in San Antonio.

It's a little ridiculous that they would be short on these items when those are the things that are highest in demand, they should pay better attention to when those things are running low since that's what everyone is there for!

Upon being seated, we were served water and a second round of drinks. Fresh bread was brought to the table and our orders were collected.

I was right and, shockingly, my bad expectations were worsened!We'd made reservations weeks in advance. I walk in & see over half my office milling by the hostess stand...?? They were told to let the hostess know when our party arrived? Uhh. I told the hostess to seat us - there was an empty table reserved just for us...why the eff not?

Our rude waiter let us know as soon as we sat (& many times during the horrific meal) that the table was reserved again so hurry it along. Nice greeting huh? Not kidding. He was the worst: ignored our questions & requests - literally, no reply when asked if bread would accompany the oil on the table (it came 25 min later). He made smart ass comments when we asked a few questions about appetizers then a few of us decided against ordering any (while the other half of the party did). He reached over everyone & cleared plates that people were eating off of at that very moment. Just awful! He was actually Italian, too! SO not the way real Italians dine or serve in Italy, man. You've been Americanized in the wrong & worst way!The food was equally awful. Calamari app was sizable, but gooey & soggy. I ordered the fruta de mare, which was mussels, shrimp, scallops, & lobster atop linguine in a white wine sauce. The sauce wasn't white wine & was flavorless...I had to add salt & pepper. The seafood was frozen & overcooked. The \"lobster\" tasted & looked like crawfish. I ate a few bites then couldn't take any more. I had a taste of the \"famous\" Shrimp Paesano - yuck!

He was also kind enough to allow us to taste some of the amaretto and limoncello he had made himself - it was quite good actually. Meals coming out of the kitchen looked good. However, I will say I was somewhat put off by the smell of someone's fish dish. Fish should not give off that strong an odor. Compared to other spots on the Riverwalk, this felt a bit less touristy.

We look under aged so I don't blame them for not providing it from the beginning. I was hoping after ordering drinks our waiter would warm up to us more, cause he lacked any charisma or concern towards us. They're menu has some creative cocktail options. Several fruit martinis to choose from and I choose the pomegranate. My friend got a Bellini and it was so delicious it didn't taste like alcohol at all.I took a while to order but finally decided on Frutta Di Mare with white wine sauce. It came with scallops, mussels and lobster. I opted out of the shrimp since my friend was allergic, but it was still loaded with seafood. My friend just got spaghetti with tomato sauce, and thought it was really good considering the simplicity of it. Our waiter finally brought us bread, but I was slightly disappointed because I heard they would provide table side hummus as well.

I would give the gnochhi 4 stars the texture was chewy and not dense and the sauce on the pork went very well with the gnocchi. The reason I give a 3 star was the slight disappointment on the pork. Part of the pork was tender and came right off the bone but the other part of the pork was tough and without more sauce the pork was a little too salty Service was great the waiter came often making sure my drink is refilled. Because of the waiter's high recommendation of the pork and describing how juicy and tender the meat would be, it was more disappointing.However, overall the service was great and the portions of the braised pork and gnocchi was very large and filling.

It appeared to be branded as an upscale Italian place, and the prices certainly reflected that distinction. However, the quality of the food did not.I ordered the veal marsala, which was one of the pricier (but not the priciest) option on the menu. I was very disappointed with this dish. I've had the same dish at cookie-cutter chain restaurants, and frankly they do it better than this place at a much lower price point. The meat was very thin and much too tough, and the pasta was underdone. The marsala sauce had a good flavor, but it didn't make up for the other noted issues.My friend ordered lasagna, and he said it was quite dry. My kids ordered the pizza (one cheese, one Italian sausage). I tried the latter, and found the pizza to be of mediocre quality. The Italian sausage topping was simply dreadful - it was hard, dry, and way overcooked.The portion sizes for all of the meals were acceptable for the price, but the quality fell significantly short in relation to the cost.I will say that our waiter was excellent, in spite of the mediocre food. I was happy to give him a higher-than-average tip even though the meal itself was quite disappointing.All in all, not a great experience.

The bread was good, and they just brought more without us asking.

We were there around 5-530pm. As it started to get dark we saw all these bats come out and fly around.

Excellent food and service!"], ["Al R.", "My wife and I have had some enjoyable meals at Paesanos over the past couple of decades, sometimes inviting friends and family. For the past five or six years we have even made it our Valentines Day tradition. NO MORE!I will no longer bend over backwards simply to make the reservation for Valentines Day dinner. What could be so difficult, you ask? Can you simply call the restaurant? No. Maybe shoot the restaurant an email? No. You MUST visit their website. Why? To fill out a form, but NOT a web form, in which you fill in the blanks and click \"Submit.\" It's a PDF form - but not a PDF which you can edit on your screen and \"Send.\" \u00a0You are REQUIRED to download and print the three page PDF. Page one is the fixed menu for your amazing Valentines dinner. Pages two and three MUST be completed and returned to Paesanos catering department. If you happen to do this reservation soon enough, you can mail it in. If not, you MUST then scan these two pages and email/fax them in. One of the two pages has no more than a single bit of information - \"How many guests? ___\" (Sure, let's use an entire page for that.) The other page, though, is your reservation contract. Contract? There is no other way to put it. You fill out all of your personal information, like name, phone, credit card, etc, then sign and date after reading a statement which states in effect that you will be there, and if for some reason you can't be there you WILL be charged for the entire meal anyway. They are such sticklers for getting this contract, that when I called several days early and offered to give my information over the phone because my printer/scanner was broken, they suggested I use the UPS Store. Nice.Let me tell you, Paesanos, I thought it was arrogant and presumptuous to require making these reservations in this way then, and still do now 5 or 6 years later. But the degradation in food quality and service is the last nail in the coffin.We have had a couple of borderline experiences at Paesanos over the years - not limited to Valentines Day - but will stick to this particular visit.-- There was chaos at the hostess stand with walkup guests mingled with reservation guests, and no clear delineation-- Service was terrible. Our appetizer was sent to the wrong table at least twice. Delivery of our entree was VERY late, with tables seated after us actually finishing and leaving before we were served. Our waitress assured us no fewer than three times that our food was on the way out. She didn't offer fresh ground pepper, and we had to ask multiple times for butter and shredded parmesan.-- Food was so far below acceptable it defies description. Crab Cake appetizer, which was offered at a premium, was unexceptional. The Shrimp Paesano was undercooked and rubbery, and it - and accompanying pasta - was so cold it seemed not to have been warmed enough having been removed from the walk-in cooler.-- Price is far and above what should be tolerable for the quality of this restaurant. Prices are bumped up 10% - \u00a020% for this special occasion fixed menu. Add $14 for an appetizer which is not included - and not worth the price. Add $42 for a bottle of so-so wine that retails for about $12. Add, also, the required and pre-printed 20% for the terrible service. Now we have a grand total of about $230 for two people. Wow.I cannot begin to tell you what an amazing evening my wife and I might share at a fraction of that cost at any number of other restaurants. And NOT have any of the headaches and frustrations associated with this one.GOODBYE PAESANOS!Will you miss us? No. Will we miss you? NOT A CHANCE!!EDIT 2/21/15:-- Actually, one of the two pages has just two bits of information; Number of Guests ____, and Which Time - 7pm or 9pm.-- My bill was not $230, it was $212.-- The manager (presumably) called to apologize. Quaint formality, but nothing was offered in any form to redeem themselves. Just one more disappointment. Here's a clue, Paesanos, The customer pays hard earned money for a product/service. If you don't provide that product/service don't take their money."], ["Kymberly G.", "We were out on the Riverwalk and ended up here kind of late in the evening (930ish?). \u00a0Most places on the Walk were closing, but they happily sat us down and let us take our time on ordering. \u00a0The Chicken Parmigiana was great... and I heard no complaints from the rest of my group, either, who had the pizza and a specialty salad.

The portions are large and my husband who can typically eat everything in his plate actually had left overs. We finished it off with Limoncello Cream Cake. After a big dinner I was nervous, but our waiter suggested it because it was a lighter dessert. He was right. My husband and I shared it and it was perfect. Our waiter was absolutely amazing.

We decided to grab something to go, so we examined the menu and was excited to get some good Mediterranean food. We placed our order and grabbed a seat about five feet from the counter and proceeded to wait. The place was quite dead, so we expected no more than a ten to fifteen minute wait time. Thirty minutes later we were still be patient, the we saw one, two, three people/groups of people who came in behind us getting their orders - this kinda pissed me off, so I went up to the counter to ask about my order that still had not come out, this was now 41 minutes since I placed the order. The young girl behind the counter was like \"what\" \u00a0and started looking around to try and figure out where my order was, to pick up the bag sitting on the counter and say \"oh it's been sitting right here for at least 15 minutes sir\". I ask why I had not been notified and the only response was \"sorry\" and it was not even a sincere sorry. If that was not bad enough, there was absolutely zero attempt to address their mishap - no offer to ensure the meal was still warm, no offer to remake it, no offer to reimburse part of it, no offer for a free side or a free drink (not that I expect a freebee, but I do expect a recognition that they made a mistake and are trying to provide some sort of resolution\". This was not the case. So we took our meal that was sitting for at least 15 minutes, went back to our hotel room and ate cold meals that was hardly worthy of us going out to get them in the first place...

I love Greek or Mediterranean food; hummus, pita, kabobs, shawermas.... mmm mmm mmm! We got the hummus and pita as an appetizer, and it was exactly what we wanted, nice and light and fresh-tasting. We shared an entree, which was the salmon kabobs. Each skewer (2) had just enough fish and veggies for each of us to have a decent portion. It also came with a side greek salad and more hummus and pita. We also ordered a side of rice pilaf. Everything was super fresh, seasoned and cooked well. The food was filling without making us feel greasy or gross. The free goodie we received was a Zo\u00ebs Kitchen reusable sports cup!

It's comfortable, with both booths and tables and I can see young families or couples eating here. (We went later during the evening so there weren't that many customers.)

They feel comfortable but still modern.For me, the problem arises because Zoe's definition of the words \u00a0\"fresh made\" has a very different meanings than they do to me. To me, \"fresh made\" means they made the food fresh, from scratch in their kitchen. I guess that is too much to assume. Do we need a legend in each restaurant as to what \"fresh made\" vs \"fresh baked\" really means?When I visited Zoe's, I was trying to decide between ordering the egg salad sandwich and the hummus and pita bread (called out on the menu as fresh made daily). My decision was made for me when I asked the guy taking my order, \"Is the pita bread made from fresh from scratch every day?\" To which he replied, \"Yes...we slice it and then bake it every morning.\" Me: \"Is the pita bread made fresh from SCRATCH every day?\"Him: \"No.\"I completely understand the balance of a fast casual restaurant such as Zoe's needing to buy a lot of \u00a0pre-made, pre-packaged items, since it costs much less than to make it fresh. I get it. My problem is when they try to deceive the general public by making them think that it is healthier and fresher than it truly is. That is my beef. On to a review of the food I ordered. I decided on half a egg salad sandwich with a side and my husband had half a tuna sandwich with a bowl of tomato soup (his gold standard by which he judges many restaurants). My egg salad was unseasoned and beyond mediocre. The lettuce on my sandwich was all white (no green leafs to be found). My husband's tuna was just as disappointing as was the tomato soup. It was clearly from a package and so overly acidic that it was hard to eat. We also tried a chocolate chip cookie that was clearly \"fresh baked\" not fresh made. We also tried the hibiscus green tea which was unnaturally green colored and was nothing to write home about.I won't go back to Zoe's unless a friend suggests it, and then maybe I'll give them a second chance. I'm curious to see what many other think of Zoe's. I know it's new and a fun place to try, but I wonder how they will really do in the long run."], ["Yamen G.", "Awesome food! Great service!

It is kinda Mediterranean style, with lots of hummus, pita, wraps and such. I got the chicken shishkabobs, which was good! The rice was fluffy, and made just right. It was delicious food, and a good value. I enjoyed the fact that they had homemade salad dressing on each of the tables, an oil and balsamic vinegar combo. They also offered their own proprietary blend of herbs and spices in a shaker, which was cool and yummy. The staff at the register seemed to be a little out of it. We had to repeat our order several times, and they still got it mixed up before we corrected them. The artwork is pretty funny. Seems they went to a local school and asked the kids to do paintings of food, but didn't tell them that they'd be hanged landscape style- horizontally. Therefore, there's a lot of paintings of ice cream cones hung sideways."], ["Tina S.", "Zoe's Kitchen is a great option for a healthy lunch/dinner. \u00a0The prices are VERY reasonable and after having 3 different meals here, I have yet to find something that didn't taste great!

You walk up to the menu board, place your order and receive a table number, then pick a place to sit and your food will be brought out to you.Menu \u00a0consists of various salad, sandwich/pita, and entree options, and seems to be very health focused: sides include pasta and potato salads without mayo. In any case, friend ordered the steak kabobs with potatoes and peppers, while I went for the salmon kabobs served with Greek salad, cucumbers and raita, and hummus. Added an extra side of the potato salad and an appetizer of hummus and pita, not wanting to just get the free entrees. To our delighted surprise, the entire meal was free! Pricing was pretty good regardless, for the record.Food was delivered quickly and had great presentation. Pita was grilled but seemed store bought rather than fresh, so that was a slight disappointment, but the hummus was smooth, flavorful, and plentiful. Steak kabobs had a great marinade, and salmon was perfectly well done. The Greek salad was amazing and had a light Greek vinaigrette and plenty of feta, which is my favorite. Potato salad was tasty. Cucumbers and raita didn't really fit with the rest of the meal to me, though. Also want to note here that portions are quite plentiful!As we ate, various employees and a manager came by to check on us. We let them know how tasty the food was and that we would definitely be back. Everyone was friendly and busy working, keeping food coming out quickly, checking to be sure patrons didn't need anything else, and cleaning up after others left. Will definitely return to this place, glad to have a nearby healthy dining option available!"], ["Esther N.", "Tucked away on the wrong side of HEB, it's not really worth going to. The beef kabobs were tough and not enough flavor. They have gluten free and vegetarian items, but didn't seem too impressive.When you first walk in, they have a huge menu up behind the counter, so it takes a second to figure out what you want to order. Once you order, if you aren't going to eat there, you sort of stand around. \u00a0It took quite a while for them to get the food, and you are stuck sort of awkwardly standing around.I don't anticipate this place lasting too much longer.

What a delightful finding! This is a busy middle East (Meditaranian) restaurant that is both good and reasonably priced. There are already two Pasha's in San Antonio and a third one about to open in two weeks in the Forum Live Oak area off I-35. All look like great successes. They seem to follow the same formula for success as the Peymonds Cafes in Las Vegas. If you miss a good \u00a0hummus or lental soup and a gyro plate, this is the place to go to in San Antonio. Of interest, there is a smaller middle eastern cafe right behind Pasha's called the Naara Cafe. We actually like this place better because it has more atmosphere, great outside pation and some of the best pizza in town. And, it is the only place we've found a true Shawarma (wrap) in San Antonio exactly like the small street places in Damascus. Naara Cafe is like a typical small coffee house in downtown Damascas or Tehran. It was then that the waiter told us that Pasha's and the Naara Cafe had the same owner. Was that his Maserati parked next to my Honda Fit right out in front? Maybe it's the sam guy that owns the huge Ali Baba food market in the same complex."], ["Panos P.", "I wish I could give Naara 6 stars. I'll start off by saying that this is by far my favorite restaurant and place to hang out in San Antonio. I have never tried something from the menu that I did not like, and trust me, I have been to Naara Cafe more times than I can count. From the juicy joojeh kabob to the slightly spicy but extremely satisfying falafel wrap, Naara is the place to go for Middle Eastern food in SA. Unsurprisingly, their \"Western\" food is delicious as well. From cheesy pizzas topped with chicken or beef shawarma to chicken wings and even a burger, this is a solid place for a meal, any time of the day. For dessert, I strongly recommend the \"Akbar Mashti\", which is a saffron-rose flavored Persian ice cream topped with pistachios. Other selections such as the kanafeh and \"Naara's Best\" are also excellent.You can not come to Naara without ordering one of their hot teas. There is a huge selection of hot teas, but the best in my opinion is the orange blossom tea with mint. It comes with sugar cubes, but for the best flavor ask for honey. They also served Turkish coffee in a traditional cezve, which can be enjoyed at any time of the day.The best thing about Naara is the atmosphere. Whether you are looking to catch a soccer game, catch up with friends, have a meal, study, or just relax, Naara is the perfect place for all of these. The environment is super laid back, with several TVs both inside and outside as well as backgammon and domino sets for entertainment. People often stay here for hours relaxing or studying, and it is especially nice because you never feel pressured by anyone to leave. For tobacco smokers, there is a large selection of Starbuzz and Al Fakher shisha, with classics such as \"Double Apple\" and \"Gum Mint\", and exotic flavors such as \"Safari Melon Dew\" and \"Geisha\". Options for fruit bowls, ice tips and bases, and even traditional salloum hookahs are available. With exotic lamps hanging from the ceilings and all kinds of different people, one truly feels as if they are in the Middle East when at Naara Cafe."], ["Bruce W.", "Really wanted a gyro today. So I met my son at this hookah joint. The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the hummus with pita and the gyro hold the pickles, I hate pickles and they don't belong in gyros. The hummus was OK, the pita seemed a little on the thin side.The gyro and french fries arrived. The fries were nice and crispy.The gyro was lacking something. I'm not sure exactly what but the meat tasted a little off compared to other gyros I've had. The taztziki was a little weak as well. I would like to have this at three and half stars but that is not an option. So I am going there stars I took one off for the hummus and one off for the gyro. I will try this place again if I want a gyro and some one wants to smoke the flavored tobacco"], ["Stefany V.", "I am involved in a love triangle with Pasha and Naara. It's not as dirty as it sounds, I promise! The two cafes both sell Mediterranean food in the same plaza just by the SA Medical Center. \u00a0Naara draws me in because she's pretty and fun, but Pasha's the one with the good cooking that you take home to mom.All jokes aside, Naara's food and service are lacking but the interior d\u00e9cor, patio seating, and hookah more than make up for it if you're into that sort of thing. Their most-recommended items tend to be the pizza, while the authentic dishes are less palatable. Falafel order is huge for $8 but dense inside and lacked the crisp exterior that I like. Pita is crispy rather than soft, which is odd because I know they have the same owner as Ali Baba International Market (same plaza) with amazing house-made pita bread.As for the service? They seem to constantly have \"now hiring\" signs up, and I've yet to have an order come out correct. Female staff always seem to be hired based on their looks and a little rude for someone in a front-of-house or customer service role."], ["Fahim S.", "I initially gave Naara a 3 star but since that review I changed it to 5 stars, they have upped their customer service and personally apologized to me. \u00a0The establishment took my review and is improving their customer service.

For the appetizer, they bring out two flat pieces of bread with some sort of herb and olive oil pesto sauce that was delicious! I was a bit taken aback by the service. It wasn't especially nice. I asked for water to drink with my meal, and the waitress replied that they only carry bottled water, and they don't have tap water. I asked how they wash their hands if they don't have tap water. Should I be concerned for my health? No, they wash their hands, but the water is unfit for human consumption. I wonder how much of that water ends up in the food? Or is this just a ploy to ring up more sales from drinks? Of course, they have tea. (How did they brew the tea if they don't have tap water?!) I don't think a restaurant should be able to stay open if they don't have potable water. The menu selection was fair, and they had lunch specials at fair prices. They have a whole section devoted to shishas (or hookahs). They carry a wide variety of tobaccos, and accessories. I noticed that the staff was attentive with the coals, and were quick to replenish burned out coals, or offer a new bowl of tobacco. The decor was authentically Arab. It looked like a Marrakesh diner, with rugs everywhere, cool little lamps, and fun stuff to check out on the walls.

For a restaurant or establishment to receive a five star rating from me would mean that it is something truly extraordinary..Naara Cafe is exactly that.

Many corners and tables with luxurious pillows and beautiful lighting. The outside seating was very nice as well. Multiple TV's for people interested in watching sports, and again, very beautiful middle eastern chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The place was very crowded and busy when we arrived, but the very courteous workers still went above and beyond when it came to making sure we found an area that suited us. Once we sat down we looked at the vast menu which aside from a plethora of hookah flavors and variations, also had a wide array of food and drink. Because we had eaten dinner before, we decided to just get two hookahs for the group. The order and delivery went through very fast, and the hookahs themselves were very well kept and extremely flavorful. What I mean by flavorful is that at most hookah locations the smoke itself, although holding certain hints of taste, doesn't really have a depth to it. The hookah flavors we tried here all had an amazing depth and quality to them that I haven't tasted and felt anywhere else. Not only that, but the workers would drop in occasionally to check if we needed new coals instead of us having to feverishly wave them down. There was even a point where a waiter was walking around giving out free plates of unbelievably delicious baklava. This is without a doubt my #1 hookah destination in San Antonio so far.

The salad on the side was ok...kinda sad in my opinion cause I like/make a mean salad with homemade dressings...while edible, this salad is romaine topped with black olives, a few kalamatas, feta, and some bottled dressing. Next up was the Mazze Plate...a large (feeds 2-3 people) sampling of appetizers. The hummus was decent and very generously portioned. We were given about 4 triangles of pitas and had to ask for me. Next were the dolmas...pretty tasty...stuffed with rice and quite juicy. Last, the falafel, which I was MOST excited about. I was kinda disappointed...very cardamom-y. Don't get me wrong, I love cardamom, but, it was a bit much for us. Also lining the plate was tomatoes, cucumbers, and the previously mentioned salad was the \"bed\" for all these goodies to lie on. Two fun sauces on the side: a sweet & sour type that was good when paired with the hummus, and a garlic spice sauce that was good on, well, any and everything! We mopped that stuff up with a biscuit (errr, pita?)! Top 40 music was playing VERY loudly...I like Top 40, but, was hoping for something more authentic & appropriate to the cuisine...like the fun music from their website.

I will, however, suggest trying their food (and their hookahs - I don't smoke hookah, but I've heard good things from friends that do) and just hanging out there.The atmosphere, both inside and out, is very lively with usually a packed crowd, good music and usually an international channel playing on the TV. It's also very clean, so you know you're not sitting at a table that has bugs all over it or hasn't been cleaned. The patio is now covered, so sitting outside on a rainy day isn't an issue. There's also plenty of seating with larger booths outside. I've never really seen this place even remotely empty, but there's somehow always a table available whenever I go. The food is made fresh in their open kitchen inside and I'd say it's pretty good food - better than some of the other Mediterranean restaurants in the city.In regards to the menu, I've tried a few different things, so here's a list and rating for each:Samboose Roll (appetizer) - It's basically a Mediterranean samosa with plenty of potatoes and it's generally good in taste. It fills you up, so I suggest taking it easy on it.Falafel (the appetizer version) - I've had several different experiences with this. There are times where it's been delicious, but other times where the falafel has been dry and tasteless. I guess you just have to take a chance.Falafel Wrap - I love this stuff! But, again, it's also been not-so-great at times. The fries are large and they're seasoned well, and the garlic sauce mixed with the hot paste is definitely a treat.Chicken Shawarma Wrap - This is possibly the best chicken shawarma I've personally ever tasted. It's seasoned well, and I really like it!Gyro - Here's something I've tried from Zain B.; I've never been too into gyros and lamb/beef in general, but this stuff is GOOD. Definitely recommend it!Pizza - I've had the homemade cheese pizza, and I remember thinking how good all the Mediterranean touches were to these little slices of heaven. Gosh, I'm craving it as I write this review.--So, there you have it. Naara. It's a good place to go to and hang out, with a wonderful atmosphere and good food, but be wary of the service you may have to encounter. 'Tis all!"], ["Sean S.", "I love going to Naara!! Whether I'm riding solo, or with friends, there's always something to do. They serve delicious food (I always get the Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich), they have great tea and dessert selections, and they provide a fantastic atmosphere to enjoy a hookah. There is always a great deal of diversity among the customers, ranging from Persian families to college kids, so anyone will feel right at home having a conversation over a hookah and some tea."], ["Matt G.", "Never fails. There service is terrible. Yet the food is great. Pic your poison i guess."], ["Zain B.", "Simple review for Naara ahead.Food: awesome! Always consistent and delicious.Ambiance: I personally love a laid-back, outdoor environment so they won me over. Several TVs outside so you can watch the games when available. They do have an inside seating area but it's a bit stuffy for me, especially with the hookah smoke.Hookah: it's good as every other place but I will say its definitely overpriced, but the environment makes up for it.Service: This they can improve drastically. Consistently long wait times before you can even order. Waitresses aren't even friendly or polite. They have forgotten my order on two occasions and came back to the table to confirm - just write it down the first time! 1 out of 5 stars for service which really brigs down whole experience.I'll return for the food."], ["Anna J.", "This is a great place, love the patio with covered seating, TV's and hookah smells. Visited here with a friend for dessert, and was not disappointed. The staff was friendly and quick to take our order. I can't wait to revisit and try out the savory side."], ["Sean T.", "I've been coming here for years, and I've found that the service has really gone downhill of late. I don't know if I've just been classified as a regular (and such, low maintenance), but I hardly see my server after I sit down. Food is good, when it eventually come, or if it's the correct order. Hookah is good, coal service is so-so. They have an iced tea that comes with free refills, but don't expect it to get refilled."], ["James R.", "I seriously wish I could rate this place higher, it has a great location, well priced food and an awesome middle eastern vibe. Truth is, if you're not there to smoke, you'll probably get terrible service. I've only ever had one attentive waitress while eating there and I've yet to ever see her again. I can't judge their Hookah, but if you order food, expect to not have any sort of follow up. You pay for water and I pretty much just sit myself whenever I go. First time I went with a friend, I was asked to wait to be sat, 10 minutes later I was told to \"sit wherever.\" All that being said, they have an AWESOME selection of drinks. The turkish coffee is phenomenal and the food combos are great. The best things about this place for me is the hours, they are open till 2 and 4 AM. If you have a group or just want a laid back atmosphere, this is one of the places to go."], ["Sunay P.", "This place has a vibe that can be best described as a \"Hookah Honky Tonk\". \u00a0They always seem to be playing country music and couple that with the smell of all flavors of hookah and I think you can picture what I mean.Now right off the top I will get my two issues with this place out of the way : service is non-existent for people with food orders. \u00a0The come take your order, deliver the food and then that's it. If you need anything else you will never see a server again. You need to go to the counter to get whatever you want. Secondly, apparently they don't have regular water to drink. Really?? wtf do they wash their dishes with? what comes out of their taps? I mean I know they are trying to make money off drinks, but this is a shi**y way to force drinks onto people.Now onto the good : very nice outdoor patio, good service for smokers and a very nice selection of teas. In fact they will make you whatever tea you want. \u00a0Black tea with cardamom and mint? sure! Black tea with rose? sure!. \u00a0 The food is okay and nothing I ate there stood out...maybe the kebab sandwiches because they cleverly have square kebabs (I suspect the meat is patted out in a pat, oven cooked and then they cut rectangles out of them to fit the bread) which are nicely flavored with garlic, parsley, mint and some onion. \u00a0The salads are quite fresh, though they seem to leave things off and you have to go ask for them (remember: no service so no chance of asking the waitress to bring you anything you are missing), and the appetizers are okay but nothing spectacular.This is a 2.5 star place really...but the patio and the selection of teas make up for everything else. \u00a0I would say forget the food, but do go enjoy the patio, the arabic coffee and chai, and all will be OK."], ["Sarah H.", "I really like Naara. They carry Starbuzz, which is nice. I prefer their house specialties, though. You can't smoke inside, though. Not sure why. Don't know if it's a San Antonio thing or just their personal preference, but it would be nice to be able to smoke inside, especially on really cold days. (They have outside heaters, but that only helps so much.)Their food is freaking DELICIOUS. Their tzatziki sauce is so refreshing. Today they put in some sort of chili sauce (think Sriracha) with the tzatziki. Surprising and different but so so good!My only complaint is the attentiveness of the wait staff. Tending to the customers are definitely not their main concern, that's for sure. I'm a returning customer, and will continue to be, but I hope they step their customer service up. Then they'd get 5 stars!PS their hookah & food happy hour prices are so reasonably priced! Go during the day and take advantage of this!PPS try Traffic Light!"], ["Chike A.", "I haven't been to too many hookah joints, but this one definitely hit hard. 2 puffs and I was relaxed as hell...

I don't feel welcome when I come here with family anymor. I think my favorite waitress quit got fired or doesn't work there anymore. You walked in and got no hi and waited to be sat when it was not busy tonight on a Friday. I had a really rude service and my server kept going to a group of older ladies to talk about another person or server. Naara has turned into a horrible place to smoke and eat. I won't be coming back until they get my favorite server back or until they get someone who is like her since the other servers don't care about anyone they don't know on a friend level. I not sure who my server was but I do know she is short with short curly hair. She didn't even tell me her name.Another thing, another waitress is really loud and inappropriate with her clients.

At the other end of the shopping center was Cafe Naara. They were open so we went in to check it out. Right off the bat the place felt really familiar. I reminded me of a place that I used to each lunch at in LA that was near my old office. The furnishings and the overall atmosphere reminded me so much of Cafe Dahab, they even have a covered patio area for hookah smoking. However I didn't come for shisha I came to eat and eat we did! They have a very reasonable lunch menu. All of their sandwich combos are $6.99. I decided on a combo kabob plate and that along with an order of felafel was what my son and I split for our lunch. The food was excellent! The beef kabob was good but the chicken was outstanding. They came complete with basmati rice, hummus, and salad. The felafel is the best that I've had in town. Their hummus was also delicious and the big surprise was the dressing on the salad. This wasn't your usual Greek vinaigrette, there was a zestiness to it that was very nice. Service was good despite the fact that it seems that they just have one person waiting on all the tables. I'll definitely come back.

Love love love"], ["Val T.", "Excerpt from our food review blog: complete review is on the blog.She said:Naara is an excellent place to go when you want a light meal, to enjoy hookah, or just hang out with some of your friends. \u00a0They have board games, appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, meals, desserts, and a wide variety of drinks. One of the things I find most interesting about Naara is that the atmosphere is always a little different. It is a great place to people watch, and has probably the most diverse clientele of any restaurant we go to. It is almost always busy, with people of all ages, walks of life, and ethnicity.Dessert tonight was wonderful. \u00a0We both shared Sweet Rolls, described as filo dough wrapped around cashews & walnuts and baked to golden brown. \u00a0They were delicious. \u00a0Crunchy without being messy to eat, lightly sweet, and richly flavored with just the right amount of honey. \u00a0We also shared Akbar Mash-Dee (Traditional Persian ice cream, with rose water, real cream, saffron, and ground pistachio.) This by and far is my absolute favorite dish at Naara. \u00a0There is not an easy way to describe this ice cream. It is floral due to the saffron and rose water, lightly sweet, with just a bit of earthiness from the pistachio.He said:We were seated at one of the curved, padded benches that has a low table. There are regular tables inside and patio tables out side as well. This one affords some of the best people watching. We always sit on the patio. Everything is so relaxed and inviting out there. Stucco walls painted earth tones, black wrought iron ornaments, ceiling fans, and lights that blend to make the perfect ambiance for an evening relaxing. There is always a good cross section of people there. From the young soldiers trying to \"out manly\" each other (Been there and done that myself) all the way to multi-generational families (grandfather and grandson playing chess while everyone else eats and chats) they all blend in to make a rich tapestry of interactions.Neither one of us was really hungry so we decided to split a combo kabob plate. It has very generous portions of marinated chicken and lamb char broiled to perfection with a fresh salad (lettuce and greens with a light vinaigrette. Garnished with crumbled white cheese and sliced green olives), Perfectly cooked basmati rice, tasty hummus, and fresh grilled pita.On to the hookah. All the hookahs at Naara are works of art. They even sell them up front. As well as coals and shisha. We got a blend that is a favourite of us both: rose and raspberry. The floral notes of the rose and the slight astringency of the raspberry ( it is real raspberry flavour, not at all \"cool-aid-ie\") makes a well balanced flavour that is enjoyable for the 3 or so hours we stay and hang out here. There is a separate menu for the varieties of shisha flavours they have. If you are unsure, ask the waitstaff. They are all very knowledgeable and can provide guidance. If you don't want to futz with your coals or just don't know what to do, they have guys walking back and forth every few minutes with baskets of hot coals to help or show you the process.Great Food, Great Service, Great Place.Naara Cafe and Hookah"], ["Jasmine R.", "Good food! I like their Hummus and chicken kabobs."], ["Emily W.", "This is probably my favorite hookah Caf\u00e9 in San Antonio. There's a good selection of sheesha flavors, the hookahs work well/smoothly, the service is great and the hummus is excellent.

Go to Naara!!!"], ["Christopher P.", "Naara Cafe is a gem. I love the location and the interior, all adding up to the perfect place to study or just get-a-way for hours. It isn't very big, but it does have an outside patio. Compared to Shisha, it is tiny, but that's why I like it so much: privacy. The cafe doesn't really start to fill up until after 10pm, even then it isn't packed. The interior is low-lighting, two television screens, dark wood decor, tile, and heavy wooden furniture. The feel of the place is very cozy. The food is pretty good, but not the best. I would say better than Shisha though. However, let's face it, most people don't come here for the food. They come here to relax usually after they eat somewhere else.Key to the goal of relaxation is the hookah and let me be the first to tell you, Naara stands with the best in San Antonio. Their hookah prices are very competitive, cheaper than Shisha, and their hookah pipes are the best I've encountered in this city and they are always in great condition. Their choices of tobacco are typical of a Hookah Cafe, but I discovered their selection is richer and higher quality.Also, their assortment of tea is wonderful. I've had the sage tea on my last two visits, simply refreshing. And to add a little class, they have authentic sugar cubes that come with every tea purchase. Of course, all the artificial sweeteners are available as well.My only pick with Naara: the servers. I was unimpressed. They didn't mess up my order or do anything disastrous, but they didn't do anything that was conducive to a great experience either. However, the server in charge of replacing coals on the hookah has been on-top of \u00a0his job every time I have frequented the cafe, something I can't say for Shisha. Overall--good experience, awesome hookahs, great atmosphere, and passable service."], ["Ene K.", "Great Persian food Buffett. Wonderful assortment of teas. The pizza style appetizers were delicious!"], ["Angel D.", "I've been to Naara probably about 15-20 times. We kept going back because it's close to home. At first I liked Naara. Unfortunately every time I've been since my first visit, it seems to have gradually gotten worse. The service has never been good, and can usually be ranked somewhere between bad and... horrible. Some of the waitresses are extremely rude and oblivious to their customers needs. Usually you can only expect the waitresses to come back to your table once. There are one or two times when the service we've had has been okay. There's also this weird indescribable odor near the register that I've noticed the last few times going. It's really off-putting. Today we went and ordered a chicken shawarma and a gyro. The chicken shawarma had a ton of mayo on it, and my boyfriend said it tasted rancid. Mayo is not something I expect to see on chicken shawarma ever. I had the gyro, it was just okay. Both sandwiches came with french fries, which could've been crispier and needed more seasoning. While I was in the bathroom the waitress took the ketchup away, but there was a big pile of fries still on my plate. That's okay because I soon disovered a white crinkly hair stuck to one of them. So, yep ... I'm officially done with this place. On top of that, hookah was supposed to be on special at the time and our bill did not reflect that."], ["Monkey R.", "They charge $3.99 to MIX flavors!! What?!? There is no justification for that! You aren't using extra tobacco, you're just combining too flavors. That alone is absurd! And the service BLOWS!

You are seated right away, we went on Friday night and then Saturday mid-day. Friday night was packed, and we still had great service.

It is a great price... $12 for a regular flavor(i.e. Strawberry, Lemon, etc.) there were 3 of us and it lasted 3 and a half hours. Great price. We ordered pizzas, I got cheese and it was great, good flavor. Fiance got the Persian Pizza and it was great. Our friend got a burger and said it had a different flavor but she liked it. The fries were good, seasoned well! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. There is seating inside and outside, you dont HAVE to smoke here, you can just go for coffee and food and sit inside. It's a great environment. The music is cool, its not annoying.

The atmosphere was very nice...open and airy, large tables for groups with huge pillows to lounge on, large outdoor seating area, and soon to be an upstairs lounge area which is currently being renovated. We had all just come from fourth of July dinner, and no one was really interested in eating; however, we were all in the mood for desert. I ordered the baklava and was HIGHLY disappointed. This baklava was like no other I have had before. I can't even really say what about it I did not like, it just had a strange taste to it overall. I only took a few bites and politely said I was too full from dinner to eat anything more. I ordered a carafe of cardamom tea which was totally delicious. My family members ordered some orange blossom chai tea which was also very tasty. The prices on the tea were reasonable since they give you enough to serve about 4-6 people. We also decided to try the hookah to see if that was any good. The price was reasonable as we only spent $10 for our blackberry shisha. The waitress who helped us informed us she is also some sort of shisha master (which I had no idea existed) and that she could make us some sort of awesome specialty blend for only a few dollars more. As no one was feeling especially adventurous this evening, we decided to keep it simple. The hookah was good; however, our coals kept going out for some reason and the \"coal attendant\" was too busy smoking his own blend to really notice us. I kept having to wave him over to help us. Other than that, the service was quite exceptional as everything came out promptly and the staff was super friendly. Naara Cafe is owned by the same people who own Pasha Cafe, which is in the same plaza. The plaza is filled with Mediterranean owned shops and even a little specialty grocery store.

The clams and mussels were not rubbery at all and the saffron chorizo chicken broth was absolutely coming through with the bright pop of peas. My hubs and I loved it!! The antipasto platter was such a great way to start the meal. The salami had a great fat to meat ratio. The buffalo mozzarella had a creamy Brie like finish and the prosciutto had a great salt content that create a great mouth feel. (Sometimes prosciutto can be slimy!) The service was great! Will was kind and since they felt so terrible that the first filet was over, we got so much extra stuff including the salted caramel ice cream and some bruschetta which btw is seriously the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had!!The Bellini was good. Solid and shiner is from the bottle so again something familiar. Although this place is expensive it was worth it to us at least once to try this place to say we did and to sit outside in the beauty by the river."], ["Cecilia M.", "I really really really love the food i had here... Even after an hour or two i still can taste the amazing taste of seafood paella.. gosh this is the second type of risoto that i will never forget... If u happen to visit the river walk san antonio, i would suggest to have dinner in this resto and have seafood peaella... Also we had carpaccio as entree, again the taste is lovely, type of good fine dining resto, love they way they serve it so nice and.... The most important is not the look but the taste... The resto itself is not really have the view of the river walk directly unless you eat outside but majority of the resto is in the room, well this is kind of a fine dining resto and quite a romantic one.. I love itPrice wise... Considered pretty pricey but i would go with it instead of having food by the river but taste awful, lucky we got yelp to help us to find such a great resto \u00a0thanks to Yelp anywayWould be good if you have a reservation, we were pretty early for dinner and we are only 2 people so that we could get table easily but when we left the resto, may people were queuing. I guess the resto is quite small, if you want yo come with a big group definitely you need to make a reservation so they can arrange the table accordingly."], ["Christine S.", "I am giving this 4 stars only because of the weirdness upon arriving. I had made a reservation online for a Saturday night at 7:30. When we arrive, there was a long line leading up the staircase with no explanation of what to do. So we walked to the top of the staircase thinking there would be a hostess stand to check in up top. When we got to the top, we were told to go back downstairs and get in line. I mentioned having reservations which was disregarded without even asking my name, party size or reservation time. We then waited in line for about 15 minutes while they seated all the people in the line who did not have reservations. I watched this scenario repeated over and over with people who arrived after us who also DID have reservations and I tried to explain to them they didn't care. So what is the point of a reservation here if you are just seating first come first serve? Once we were seated, our service was fine and the food outstanding so I got over the bad entry, but just be warned that your reservation does not mean much here."], ["Rashi J.", "Phenomenal service and delicious food! We had the pork belly appetizer, rack of lamb and pork tenderloin entrees and salted caramel ice cream dessert. Each and every dish was great! The salted caramel ice cream is probably one of the best desserts I've ever had! However, the Mediterranean category is a misnomer."], ["Charlotte S.", "This was a great find! My boyfriend and I had never been to San Antonio and wanted to have a romantic dinner! I'm so glad I chose Bella on the River. We were promptly greeted and sat at the \"alcove table\" and had a perfect view of the restaurant. Our server Patrick was great and provided us with great recommendations. We started with the eggplant Josephine (amazing) and the bruschetta. I got the scallops and my boyfriend got the pork chops and neither disappointed! We finished with the cheese plate. Wine was well paired! Over all, such an awesome experience & I can't wait to recommend it to other and for us to come back!"], ["Isaac R.", "This place is amazing. My gf and were celebrating her graduation from air force BMT and went here for dinner. We started with the mussels and they were delicious. I had the seafood paella and my gf had the scallops. Both were cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. We capped the evening with the espresso ice cream. Best food we had on the River Walk all week. This place is a MUST try."], ["Bill H.", "We ate here 2 out of our 3 nights in San Antonio and the food was excellent both times. The duck and the scallops were exceptional. Some of the best we've had anywhere, along with maybe the best polenta we've had. Good wait staff as well. The salted caramel ice cream is a fine dessert if you have a craving after an excellent meal."], ["Kimberly R.", "Traveling alone for business in San Antonio, I didn't want to succumb to one of the chain/touristy restaurants around the Riverwalk. Am I ever glad my hotel told me about Bella AND that I made a reservation! \u00a0 \u00a0The ambience inside makes you feel like you're eating at a restaurant with lots of history. There is also patio seating on the river. \u00a0 \u00a0 My drink of choice was their peach Bellini, perfect for a hot summer Texas night. Since I heard wonderful things about their Pistachio cake, I decided to not order a full meal, but ordered two small plates instead. \u00a0I chose the Mussels - in a light broth served with delicious slices of bread; and the Eggplant Josephine (eggplant layered with shrimp)- it was rich and flavorful. It's actually enough of a portion to be an entree. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And yes the Pistachio cake is a must have - a light cake covered in a some kind of whipped cream with pistachios and Carmel drizzle on top.  \u00a0 The host, David, was very friendly and the server, Nathan was attentive."], ["Leonard S.", "Surprise! Brilliant cooking in a tourist area.Straight to the food:Texas Quail: intensely flavored wild mushrooms in the stuffing; marsala sauce was creamy, rich,subtle; substantial portion. This was nice, because when I see the word \"quail\" I think \"tiny bird- tiny serving\". Easy 5-star dish. Matched with the Barahonda \"Barrica\" 2011, a Monastrell/Syrah blend from Spain, as recommended by our server. Great pairing-this dark-red, nearly opaque wine was low in acidity with well-resolved tannins, but big in smoky/berry flavors to stand up to the rich quail dish,Paella: fresh lightly cooked peas, fresh and tender (i.e., not overcooked) shrimp, soft rice without the traditional \"soccarat\" at the bottom of the pan; strong saffron flavors (some skimp on this); perhaps the rice could have cooked a bit more, as grains were a bit firm in the center; Very tasty- perhaps 3 1/2 to 4 stars for the traditionalist.Polenta: Wow! Best ever. Well, I've never had it in Italy, but for me this was over the top. Not at all grainy, complexity from the broth used in preparation. Another 5!Olive oil/roasted garlic: yes, this is worth talking about. We ate all the roasted garlic in the oil, and there were plenty of big cloves floating around in there. I mean, we ate them by themselves, not just on the bread (which, by the way, was also superb).Staff: Steven took our reservation, greeted us at the door, checked on us throughout the meal, told us details about the dishes. Thanks for your welcoming ways. Your pride in the restaurant is well justified.Dessert: Sorry, too full. Next time."], ["Milly L.", "Highly recommended, I can't find anything to critique about this cute gem. The environment is absolutely romantic, everything about it. Don't let that stop you if you're eating for one- I made my way here alone on a business trip yesterday and fell in love. The food was amazing (maybe since it was my first meal of the day at 5 had something to do with it) but it was still magical. I usually don't ever get this impressed. I started with a Bella Blush, soft red moscato and prosecco. Went very well with my seafood and salad. First course was the mussels in a herbed butter wine sauce, very good and was recommended by the waitress. Good portion. Second course was the heirloom tomato salad served on a baguette with what seemed to me freshly made mozzarella balls. Light, naturally sweet... I wanted to stop myself from eating because I had a third course coming.... I finished it. Third course was the Special Bella Pasta, clams,jumbo shrimp, mussels, artichoke hearts, asparagus, mushrooms with handmade pasta. Wonderful. Worse thing about this experience was I didn't have enough room for dessert. Oh and the dip! Roasted whole garlic with olive oil...yum."], ["Melissa S.", "By far the best restaurant I've experienced in SA. Make reservations in advance - this place is NYC small! Start with the wine list - thoughtful and deliberate. The waitstaff knew the wines well. They have a $15 wine flight option which was useful in helping us choose a bottle. The food is intentional, perfectly cooked, dressed and prepared. I couldn't have hoped for better flavors! I had the quail, my husband had the Paella and we were both ecstatic. I was grateful for the gluten free menu, which wasn't an alternative to any of the main menu items, just simply a list of main menu items that were already GF - and many were!I rarely spend that much time in a restaurant - we sat there for 3 hours and it didn't feel that long at all. No one rushed us. The waiter didn't stop by every 10 minutes to pour us more wine - they let us pour our own bottle at our own pace. The atmosphere was so relaxing and pleasant. This will be a hard one to beat - I may have found my favorite go-to date night spot."], ["Stacy Z.", "We made dinner reservations here and showed up early had to wait so we sat at the bar inky to discover only beer and wine no cocktails. This was a bit of a disappointment but we stayed anyway. The place is super small and you practically sit with the people next to you, you are close together. The food was pretty good but the service was not what you would expect. They double sat our server with the table right next to ours so it was very awkward as he went there gave his speech them came to us with the same exact speech word for word. The food was good but would not go back due to no cocktail service and how small the place was."], ["Kathy B.", "A quaint little italian restaurant. \u00a0The setting is beautiful, the building 100 years old. \u00a0We sat outside by the river under an ancient fig tree growing out of the wall. \u00a0The food was a bit pretentious -- my scallops were delicious, but the veggies they sat upon were overcooked and unidentifiable. \u00a0Overall an enjoyable evening."], ["Chenise T.", "Wow. I don't even know where to start. I almost didn't make it here. I wandered the wrong side of the riverwalk looking for Bella and had just about given up when I stumbled across it. Due to the poor weather, no one as seated outside, and it could easily have been passed by. I was pleasantly surprised upon entering- the staircase that greeted me opened up into a small, intimate dining room that was both unassuming yet sophisticated. I had not made a reservation, which it was apparent was necessary in most instances, but the host graciously asked me to wait a few moments and was able to squeeze me in. What followed was the most amazing meal. My server recommended the pork belly to start and it was a surprisingly large portion accompanied by crispy kale & chickpeas and hummus spread that was lovely. The pork belly was rich- as pork belly is- but the other favors complimented it nicely. I followed that with the panzanella salad- heirloom tomato and mozzarella atop a toasted baguette with a vinaigrette dressing. Also good, but a typical salad that can be had elsewhere. What followed topped all. A medium rare filet mignon, encrusted with bone marrow with a yummy sauce and peppers that looked spicy hit were the perfect amount of heat! Everything was absolutely delicious, the service was attentive, and my only regret is not having room for dessert. Can't wait to return!!!"], ["Naomi M.", "AMAZING!! We found this on Yelp and was not disappointed. We started with the eggplant florentine... Wasn't sure what to expect and wasn't let down. We then moved to the main course. I had the scallops... Omg. Mouthwatering. My friend had the quail and he loved it. Wine was a perfect pairing. Highly recommended!"], ["Sarah H.", "This place almost made me wish I lived in San Antonio. Went in for dinner based on reviews. Certainly wasn't disappointed. We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to sit right away at the bar. It is quite cozy in there, but somehow it works. Normally that kind of cramping would bug me, but here it doesn't. The ambience is great. The service is amazing. Everyone is working hard and happy to be doing it. We ordered the red fish, which was pretty good but not my favorite. I got the quail, which was absolutely amazing. It's wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with Italian sausage and cooked just perfectly. We also got their bruschetta, which changes frequently. Ours was a salmon with a tzatziki \u00a0sauce which was different and really pleasant. We got pistachio cake and lemon tart for dessert because although we were full, we wanted to try them. We ate almost all of both. All that food and a bottle of wine came to $160 with a nice tip. Absolutely worth it."], ["K L.", "This place was fantastic. The food was delicious beginning to end, the atmosphere was casual and cool and the waiter was fantastic. I was in town for business and went there for a business dinner based on other reviews I read. I made a reservation ahead of time and it was pretty packed on a Friday around 7:30/8. Each one of us loved it and had very different meals. We knew immediately it would be great when the appetizer came. It was followed by salads, entrees, desserts, and wine. The food was fresh, plated beautifully and all around perfect. Would highly recommend this restaurant."], ["Sandy K.", "Located on the river where you can dine Al Fresco or upstairs in a small quaint restaurant with less than 20 tables.I recommend t making reservations due to the limited availability in this romantic setting. I felt I was transported back in Tuscany Italy with the decor & wine bar environment here.The owner personally escorted us to our reserved table. Our waiter greeted me and took our cocktail order and brought roasted garlic & Olive oil with a hot baguette which was tasty. For my appetizer, I went with the eggplant Josephine - which was incredible. The fresh gulf shrimp, eggplant and cheese were prepared perfectly. The main course I selected the Bella pasta which had lobster & and crab mixed with a red sauce and pasta. I was least impressed with this entree due to the lack of seafood portion and flatness of taste.. Lastly I did immensely enjoyed the fig fritter and shortbread dessert for the presentation, lightness and its bomb taste.Overall service was beyond average and our waiter was attentive but not over bearing. \u00a0It was a quieter night and he has a handful of tables to tend to with no assistant."], ["Kimberly C.", "Highly recommend this place!

It wasn't my favorite, but I did however order a side of the seasonal vegetable, the broccoli, and could have eaten that 10 times over!

The staff are some of the most helpful and friendly faces on the Riverwalk. We ordered the Bruchetta for an app. It was tasty and appropriate in size right before we hit the main course. I had the 6oz filet with fois gras. There's nothing artificial about this, it was divine from start to finish. She had the Scallops which were seered on the outside, but soft on the inside. The two work well with each bite. We finished off with a chocolate tart and dessert wine. It was a pricey visit but much enjoyed. Please make reservations for this place.

There's a reason this place has all the great reviews it does! It can be easy to just pass by but it's a hidden gem that you have to try! The place is not that big so there's not much space to stand while you wait, but it's worth the wait! It's a great spot for a date night with dim lights and cozy yet elegatn decor. Plus the owner is really friendly to greet you and later make sure you enjoyed your night.For the food: They bring you fresh bread, a homemade mini baguette with their version of garlic bread-- olive oil with rosemary and whole roasted garlic mixture to dip the bread in. Yummy~ I always love fresh baked bread.For the appetizer we ordered the brushetta. That day the brushetta was a warm brushetta of mushrooms and a feta cheese spread i believe--it was creamy and decadent in your mouth!As for the main meal, we ordered the paella (which is their signature dish) and the pasta bella. Paella was really flavorful with good portions of seafood! The pasta bella was amazing as well. I usually don't like fetticini because it can be heavy but this is not that kind of pasta. With generous portions of seafood, asparagus, and other yummy vegetables this pasta was creamy and light at the same time. It was quite addicting!!! I highly recommend both the dishes! Their menu isn't multiple pages like some restaurant, but the items that they have are executed to delicious perfection!TIP: make reservations!!! Also, after dinner, walk down the riverwalk to digest and enjoy the view! The riverwalk is beautiful at night."], ["Robert S.", "There is not much I can write about this place that has not been already written time and time again in previous reviews. We went there on a Tuesday night and it was very busy, yet we were seated right away and our waitress was very attentive. The menu was very different than what I was expecting for a Mediterranean place- not your typical couscous and kebab joint, but it was a nice surprise & change of pace. The biggest surprise of the night was their duck dish - hands down, the best duck I've ever had and believe me I've had my share - I sure did not expect this from a Mediterranean place! We also had their paella and that was on par with some of the better I've had. OK, so the food was delicious, but what made the best impression on me was the great atmosphere, as everyone seemed to be in good spirits and having a good time, customers and staff alike - it was not unlike a wedding reception dinner, very festive and jovial."], ["Henry J.", "I love Mediterranean food. They're healthy and tasty.Bella On the River is one of the few Mediterranean places in San Antonio in the midst of an abundance of barbecue and tex-mex restaurants. It's located on the Riverwalk. This place is very, very busy so reservations are definitely recommended or else you'll need to be ready for an hour wait even on a week night.The food is quite pricey. The typical entree is about $35. Most everything is ordered a la carte. For the value-conscious diners, Bella also has prix fixe three-course options that change once every few weeks. They include an appetizer, entree, and dessert.I had their pan-seared halibut while my dinner companion had a seasonal spicy shrimp dish. The halibut was impeccably prepared and had perhaps one of the best pan-seared jobs I've ever seen in a restaurant. One side was very crispy. The fish was not overcooked either, which is difficult to do given that halibut is a white fish. The shrimp was succulent, flavorful, and presented both flavors of the ocean and a masterful blend of paprika, tomato-based sauce, and heat. The shrimps were served on a bed of grilled eggplant slices.All in all, no complaints. Loved everything that was served."], ["Lynn O.", "Awesome little place right by the river.

I needed a glass of wine & they had 1 option for sauv blanc by the glass - joel gott from Napa valley so that made things easy & I went with that. Since I'm traveling solo I got a seat at the bar ... Always more pleasant than a table alone. They helped me instantly and made some appetizer recommendations since I said I wasn't too hungry. Their signature appetizer is the eggplant Josephine so I went with that and the panzanella salad. I was almost able to finish these both, but the Eggplant Josephine is a bit on the heavy side .. fried eggplant topped with shrimp, sauce, cheese & hollandaise sauce ... i think i could have done without so much hollandaise but it was still delicious. The panzella was basically an elevated caprese salad ... very fresh and refreshing and the garlic bread on the side was perfectly crisp and a nice contrast."], ["Candice R.", "Made reservations for Bella on the River based on other reviews.

We did not have a reservation but since we went late on a Wednesday evening we had no problem finding a table. Inside the restaurant is very cozy and relaxing. We ordered the pork belly appetizer which was deliciously cooked and the hummus on the plate was fantastic. We also ordered the butternut squash soup which was creamy and rich. We tried the beet salad! Best beets of my life! The best component of the dish is the mascarpone. I would order just a plate of that to eat with bread. The bread they bring is also delicious and the presentation with the garlic EPIC! I was craving pasta so I ordered the Pasta a la Norma YUMMMM the sausage was just the right amount of flavor. My husband ordered the rabbit. I don't even like ordering rabbit but again this was delicious and the bed of polenta was incredible super creamy. \u00a0Lastly dessert. Wow!

Nah, that's how I'd summarize Darna. The menu has a little bit of everything, almost everything under $10.

GREEK SALAD: $4, no entree size available, heavily seasoned (not a bad thing).CHICKEN SHWARMA PITA: $8, comes with fries or substitute another side for $2. Sided with an intense garlic sauce, giant portion, fresh-baked pita.FRIED CAULIFLOWER & EGGPLANT: Same price ($4), drastically different portion sizes! Giant amount of cauliflower, nicely crisped but small serving off eggplant, and drowning in grease, both unseasoned. Laying the eggplant on some papertowels to drain would up my appreciation about a million percent. This is perfect with a sprinkle of sea salt.They offer a buffet at lunch and the service is friendly. The low prices will keep me coming back, but anyone who says this spot is better than Pasha is clearly delusional.TIP: In addition to having low regular prices, they also come up on Groupon occasionally. Use the app to check before placing your order, for up to half off."], ["Nancy N.", "I came for lunch today. They had a buffet option so I took it since I wanted to sample many things. I really like how spacious it is. The waitress we had was super nice and welcoming. While we selected what we wanted she brought pita bread and water for us. The selections were pretty good for lunch. There was rice, chicken, beef kebabs, grilled chicken, lamb, falafel, a \u00a0chicken wrap, dolmas, samosas, meatballs, bunch of salad options, and baklava and semolina cake. My brother and I really liked the chicken wrap. It was warm and had a nice pickle inside. We also liked the rice. Quite flavorful (but not as fragrant as I would have liked). We didn't like the chicken and beef kebabs. They were cold and not that great. I didn't like the samosas either. But I liked the falafel ok. It was a little better than pashas version. I love that you can get all the hummus and garlic sauce you want. Those are my favorites. I was bummed the pita bread was so thin and small. Pasha has made me expect large, piping hot, fluffy pitas at every Mediterranean restaurant. The grilled chicken was pretty flavorful. I also liked the cucumber and tomato salad. Dessert was pretty great. Both were too sweet and could have used coffee but I liked them. Their desserts are definitely better than Dimassi's. I wish I could have had some coffee though. All in all, a solid, inexpensive lunch place if you are feeling very hungry. I would go back but there are so many places to try that I probably won't for some time."], ["Carl R.", "First night in San Antonio and we wanted something different.

I thought the lunch buffet was a perfect idea. However, I was with co-workers and didn't want to \"pig out\" so much. The lunch menu pricing was great and definitely worth it. I ordered a gyro and it was absolutely delish. I will definitely be back!"], ["James S.", "Let's begin with logistics. Darna's exterior might read hole-in-the-wall, but interiorly it's anything but. Looks are deceiving; one would never guess the restaurant to be so large, nor kept well as it has. Upon entering, seating is indeed self-help (no hostess)... by meal's end, payment too is at the register WITHOUT bill(s). What's free with any meal? Pita. What's unavailable at the moment? Desserts -- exactly what brought me to Darna in the first place. Assorted baklava, harisa, warbat, and kunafa must be found elsewhere, at least while Darna searches for its next aficionado of Middle Eastern pastries.Thus far, I've narrowed my go-to, most-convenient Mediterranean spots to 3 restaurants located within 5-10 minutes of one another, all at or near the city's Medical Center. While my absolute favorite PASHA is the most appealing of them, its relatively loud and crowded environment might be reason enough for some to relocate to the quieter JERUSALEM GRILL (by Ingram Park Mall), or the less busy DARNA (on Fredericksburg). Each of the establishments have strong merits; however, what one lacks, another may or not have, and vice versa. But I'm not the \"picky patron\" too difficult to please... supply me with good, clean eats and I'm a happy camper. And all three of the above do this extremely well.Darna somewhat outshines Pasha (Wurzbach) and Jerusalem Grill in a couple areas -- accommodations and general value. Darna's space is expansive, easily able to seat twice as many patrons as both Pasha and Jerusalem Grill. And while P & JG have more curb appeal and character, Darna offers more for your money. Not that P/JG's portion sizes are lacking... more is simply included with a meal at Darna. All entr\u00e9es are served with homus + pita, darna salad, and either basmati rice w/ vermicelli or biryani rice. Regarding hot drinks, nothing spectacular's going on with Darna's; their Turkish coffee is expectedly flavorful [whether sweet or unsweet] albeit too tiny in amount, and their teas are typical no matter the flavor.Ultimately, what matters most -- food quality -- is on par with both P & JG. General service and waitstaff friendliness are equally great. The ONLY items I cared not for were Darna's dolmas (my friends make far better grape leaves!), tzatziki sauce (reeked of overpowering dill!) and, to a lesser extent, pita (on the edge of nearly stale and too thin!). I think it's safe to say, however, that everyone does love Darna's smoky red pepper sauce. Throw it on your meat and your life suddenly perfects itself.Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...- Overall recommendation = 4- Food taste and quality = 4.75- Portion size = 4.5- Price = 4- Atmosphere = 4.25- General service = 3- Waitstaff = 4.5- Location = 3.5"], ["Kim T.", "I first tried this place when we had it ordered for an event at school. Amazing food for such a large order! Everything was flavorful and moist. I took my family here another time and had the same experience.

Came here a second time with a couple friends and tried the chicken shawarma sandwich with fries. Fries and the seasoning were pretty good, but I didn't really like the sandwich at all. I couldn't really finish it. I ate like 1/4 of it. The chicken had too much of the sauce in it and it reminded me of a soggy hot pocket. The sauce was overwhelmingly garlicky with the amount they put inside and also made the sandwich extremely salty. I could tell because I had to drink a lot of water afterwards. Service though was attentive and from my interaction with the waitress it seemed like they have been seeking customer feedback on how to improve their food.I don't think I'll go back though.---Came here with some friends and the fianc\u00e9. I ordered the chicken kebab with biriyani with vermicelli crispies. Our food came with loads of bread, baba ganoush hummus, and dolma as well. I've had quite a bit of mediterranean food, since my fianc\u00e9 is half Persian and his parents love to take us to eat Persian food. I know its not the same as Lebanese food, but probably similar. Chicken kebab- pretty average comparing it to my favorite chicken kebab. This one isn't as flavorful or tender but still good. The garlic sauce it comes with is pretty tasty.Biriyani rice with vermicelli crispies- The rice here was okay to me, but didn't seem authentic. It seemed like it was slathered in butter and marinated in chicken broth. It was a bit reminiscent of the kind of American marinated rice you get from a bag at the grocery store or rice-o-roni. I'm not used to biriyani being served this wet. Bread- we got lots of it and I thought it was very delicious. It was served warm each time and I took some to go and warmed it up later. Still YUMMY!Hummus- I thought this was above average here and pretty good. I actually liked it more than the baba ganoush.Baba ganoush- It was okay but had a taffy like texture in parts of it. Besides that it tasted pretty similar to the hummus to me. I'm not sure if that's normal for this. I've had the persian version of this dish (kashke bademjan) which is like an eggplant with yogurt and I prefer the flavors and texture of this. Dolma- I don't like dolma that much, but I've had better. Chicken shawarma- My friend order this and I had a try. I liked the flavor and quality of meat of my chicken kabob a lot better. The chicken shawarma was very bland by itself to me, but \u00a0my friend liked it with the sauce. I didn't care for it too much. Although the food was kind of average, the service was pretty good, prices are reasonable, and the portions are large here. They forgot to bring out one of my friend's dishes and so they gave it to him for free. They also have a good groupon for here, which makes eating here super affordable if you just go 1-2 other people. Overall, I don't mind coming back here since I can get a large portion of decent food for a good price. it's just not my favorite mediterranean grub."], ["Yuesheng L.", "This is our second time at Darna because we bought \u00a0the Groupon deal.

Spicy Kebob: Very delicious, tasted great with the Biyani rice.

Since I can't make a good eggplant dish and I love eggplant, I always makes an effort to try it on the menu. I would give the Monk Salad a 3.99 out 5 stars, It is a bit bitter for my taste, but it is a still good dish to tryMint tea: I was hoping for a potted tea, the tea bag kind cheapened it.

The food came with hummus, pita bread, and Israeli salad (diced tomatoes, onion and cucumber). Even this starter was delicious and authentic tasting. The kebabs were so flavorful and moist, not dry at all. Surprisingly, I even enjoyed the lamb, something I usually don't eat. The rice was also a delicious accompaniment.

Our family went back for a second lunch buffet visit and this time they charged $7 for each of our kids who are 3-years-old and 4-years-old so it was quite a bit pricier for our family.

From the outside you'd think this place was just a hole-in-the-wall but it's not. If you have a group, this place can accommodate. We were quickly seated and asked for our drinks. Upon the waitress's return she took our order. My wife went with the vegetarian sampler for $8.99 and I went with the mixed grill for $13.99. The vegetarian plate came with the standards, humus, baba ghanoush, falafel etc. The mixed grill had lamb, beef, and chicken, along with humus, Darna salad, and pita.All I can really say is that it was all delicious. I'm not usually a lamb eater but a nicely spiced lamb kebab char-grilled over open flame... Fuggedaboutit! The Biryani rice was also excellent. My wife loved her falafel and baba ghanoush, but found the Monk salad too sour for her liking. They also had a variety of baklava and other ME desserts although we didn't try any. The did look very delicious.The only real downer was toward the end when our waitress seemed to disappear. We had to flag down another worker for a take-out box. Then, when the waitress did come, it took her quite a long time to sort out our check. Overall, a small price to pay for such excellent food.So, if you're in the Medical District and pining for some good Middle East cuisine, you have some great choices: Darna, Pasha, and Al Bustan (a buffet - great food). They're all worth a visit. Or two..."], ["Charmane M.", "Great food great service. The staff here is excellent. The food is top notch. \u00a0I usually order the gyro with fries as a side.

Just my opinion. \u00a0I am new to town and use yelp for almost everything so I like to offer feedback when I can. I have been to dine in at lunch and its never to busy. I have also ordered take out. Good dessert s as well. Hope this helps."], ["Jenn J.", "Best gyro in San Antonio. The meat is tasty and succulent. They have reasonable pricing and the food seems fresh. There are a nice variety of appetizers and entrees. I love the dressing on their Greek salad. My only negative is that I like more cucumber in the taziki- but that's a personal preference, and theirs is really just fine. They have the most gorgeous and wide assortment of these small filo and baklava type pastries, with great prices so you can try a couple for a couple bucks.. I've tried a few and they were all amazing. I've not seen an assortment of pastries like this in any other Mediterranean restaurant in San Antonio.Everyone that works here is friendly and happy to explain foods to you, as they are very patient. Darna is my new favorite Mediterranean restaurant in San Antonio.I love Darna!!!"], ["Kerry M.", "Where I'm from originally (MI) has a lot of Mediterranean restaurants, so moving here was discouraging because I couldn't find anything that was comparable! But Darna is awesome!! The food is SO delicious and the staff goes out of their way to take care of their guests. My mom, sister, and I went to lunch today, did the buffet, and sat around for 2 hours having a great time. I HIGHLY recommend Darna.. One of my new favorites!"], ["Shay C.", "Tasty fresh food!! Clean environment and friendly staff. The desserts and Turkish coffee topped off a wonderful experience! \u00a0We will definitely be back!!"], ["Shadi A.", "This place is absolutely amazing! The food is always cooked perfectly and has so much wonderful arabic flavor! They were nearly perfect, and now with their buffet they are hands down the best. I have only one complaint... I can't say anything good about their bread.... It is sub par. I grew up on good Arabic bread and so far cannot find any in San Antonio. I have to drive 3 hours to Houston to get decent arabic bread. But other than that, this is hands down the best Mediterranean restaurant in town."], ["Rudy M.", "Loved this place at one point but waitstaff seems to be like they are 13 and offer like one refill that you must literally beg for. No basmati rice since they ran out in the morning. I suppose that 8 hours was way too short of time to make 45 min rice for dinner service. Then the desserts are gone. That was one of the reasons I came but this will certainly be the last. So disappointed and saddened."], ["Angela F.", "We arrived at Darna for lunch as soon as they opened...we were the first folks in the restaurant. Melia R. had eaten there before so Yousef rolled out the red carpet! That guy is so fun & entertaining! He's from Jordan, really takes pride in Darna, & even got White House recognition for his food. The joint got packed within the next hour so our Yousef time was limited thereafter...Anyway, Yousef sent some delicious cheese & meat stuffed puff pasty type goodness to our table...yum! There were 5 of us, so we opted for the family sampler ($14.99 each) for 4. TONS of food! And oh so delicious! We took home containers - plural - of food, still. I was super impressed with the magic they work on chicken breast...moist, crispy on the outside, super flavorful. The chicken schwarma meat and the chunks of chicken that come on the \"grilled meats\" plate were among my favorite...dredge it through some of the amazing hummus, top it with tabbouleh, & toss it into bread, muah! I also thought the baba ganoush was better than any I\"ve had in town. Everything was good. The only item I didn't care food/couldn't eat was the beef/lamb schwarma meat....it was too soft (I like the outside to be a bit crispy) & gamey. Be sure to save room for some of their unique sweets & tea!They've got a Groupon going on right now...so save some money & go eat at Darna! ($20 for $11).And be sure to introduce yourself to Yousef & hopefully he has time to tell you some stories!"], ["George W.", "Very Disappointing...I first started dining at Darna's upon seeing a promotion on GroupOn. The food was really good and the deserts to die for...Today it was awful! The Gyro was cold...The fries were cold and over seasoned...We did return the fries and they were made the way you would expect them. Granted we arrived around 1:00 pm, but you still shouldn't serve French Fries that have been sitting around too long. It's just not that hard to cook some new ones. I'm more than happy to wait to get fresh hot food. I believe most of us would rather wait, than eat cold food that is suppose to be hot.I haven't seen the owner at lunch in quite awhile. Today the tea looked like mud and didn't taste much better, so I returned it and requested a Root Beer. Only to find it lacking the proper mixture of syrup to soda. The waitress did apologize and didn't charge me for the drink. She stated that they hadn't received their weekly delivery until later today. In that case they should simply state they were out of Root Beer, instead of serving an inferior tasting drink.I'm happy to pay for good food and service.I guess when the owner is away the employeesget lazy.Sadly, I'm probably not going to return.Sorry Darna, this wasn't the first time you've disappointed me..."], ["B B.", "We got a good groupon here $8.80 for $20.

They recently changed their bread and I love it! It's much more peaceful than Pasha's and the food is actually amazing, not to mention, the pricing is very reasonable. Plus they give out free bread like Pasha's. I come here very often for lunch with my co workers and have never been disappointed. Definitely worth trying if you haven't gone yet.

I have been cooking my own food for more than 10 years and quite picky when it comes to authentic lebanese food. The main aspect of Lebanese food is the Meza (or mesa) which is a large spread of food starting with hummus, tabbouleh, baba ghanoug etc leading all the way to the kabobs and Kafta. here is my assessment where numerator is the darna score and the denominator is my favorite Lebanese restaurant in beirut / LEBANON 1- I would give all the meats a 10/10 flavorful, authentic and just plain PHENOMENAL.just thinking of them makes my mouth water2- Hummus \u00a0and Falafel 10/103- baba ghanoug 7/10 4- Tabouleh 7/10, you see they use a food processor to chop it where the athentic is hand chopped with more Bulgar and more tomatos.5- dolmas aka stuffed grape leaves 5/10, even the ones I make are better but again i make mine fresh from actual grape leaves that i pick myself ( yes I am that dedicated :0)6- NEW home made bread, super yum 10/107- rice, both white and biryani 10/108- best for last, baklava and all other sweets, My good they are so good, cant tell the difference between their baklava and the one straight from lebanon! yes 10/10 easyso there you have it! Have I mentioned that it is very Very well priced??try it you will certainly not regret it, so far I referred a bunch of people all of whom just LOVED itBig fan"], ["Andy T.", "I wish there was a Darna in Houston! I travel to San Antonio frequently and this is one of my favorite places to have a quick lunch. Prices are very reasonable and you get a generous portion of whatever you order. Also the quick, friendly service is a plus.I've always gotten the gyro sandwich and it's delicious! The tzatziki sauce is what makes it such a great sandwich. Also try the hummos w/ pita!"], ["Patricia M.", "We went here today and opted in on the buffet. It was delicious!!! There were so many options and all were just right. The lamb shanks were tender and flavorful. There were several salads, all fresh and spiced just right. The hummus was tasty...I'm a bit of a hummus nut...has to have just the right texture and flavor...and it was perfect! My daughter always orders a chicken schwarma sandwich so was prepared to order off the menu. Well guess what...there were chicken schwarma sandwiches in the buffet! And to top it off, the waiter brought her a fresh one as he wanted to make sure she had the freshest of the fresh. She loved the ones in the buffet, and took the other home for later. Win win!! So about the service...A+++. We never wanted for anything, and drinks were always replenished. The place is clean and the atmosphere is comfortable. This is our new go to for Mediterranean food!!! Thanks Darna!!"], ["Angie H.", "New. Favorite. Mediterranean. Place.I go here about once a week for lunch . . . It's THAT good. The service can be a little slow sometimes (because they usually have only one or two servers working the floor) but it's forgivable because the servers are usually super friendly and doing the best they can. Now onto the FOOD!After placing your drink and/or food order, the server will bring you a hot pillow of bread and an oil & herb mix. This is good the snack on, but don't eat too much or there won't be room for the other goodness. The tabbouleh salad is DA BOMB. It's the perfect balance of bulgar, parsley, mint, garlic, and magical goodness. It's a perfect side to the Darna kebob sandwich. The meat is moist, savory and has just the right level of char and smokiness. It's wrapped in a warm bread that cuddles the meat and a variety of pickles(?) and onions and a sauce that adds just the perfect tang. Another favorite of mine is the baba ghanoush. It's thick, rich, well balanced, and has a good smoked flavor without being tahini-overloaded.The rice and vermicelli is good - moist and has a fluffy texture that compliments the kebob well. The Darna salad that comes as a side is simple but good and a nice alternative to french fries. But who wants fries when there's FRIED CAULIFLOWER?! It's sooooo good. Be warned: sometimes it comes out piping-frickin'-hot."], ["Angela F. W.", "This place is awesome!! I don't know much about Lebanese food so I was ready to get educated here with a friend who is Lebanese. I've certainly had Mediterranean food but we all know the Mediterranean Sea spans a wide variety of cultures and cuisines. Deff don't be an idiot and think they are all the same! Based on what my friend said, this place offers true Lebanese food. We did the family style dinner for two for $15 each. They don't usually do this unless your party is larger than 3. However, the owner made the exception b/c my friend told him that it was my first time eating Lebanese food and she wanted me to try a variety. The people here were incredibly nice! Both the owner and chef stopped by our table to chat. The owner is very funny and made me laugh several times at his jokes. He even brought free Lebanese dessert for us to try! I was so impressed by the friendliness and hospitality that it almost made me feel I was dining at a family dinner. Now let's talk about the dishes we had. Oh my goodness, I almost could not remember them all, so glad I took pictures for reference. We had dish after dish being brought out to our table. I would highly recommend getting this family dinner deal if you have at least 3 person. Totally worth it!!We started off with a tasty appetizer that I don't know the name. It was filled with spinach and very delicious. I wish it was less sour though but my friend said it was supposed to be that way. Then we got our falafel, darna salad, tabbouli salad, chicken and beef shawermah, kebob, a plenty of pita and hummus. WOW, so much food! The falafel was OK, better than the ones I had in the past. I confess I don't like falafels in general! I liked the darna salad a lot, much better than the tabbouli salad. Then again I never liked tabbouli salad either. The chicken and beef shawermah were very flavorful though a bit dry. But I don't blame them. My friend said it would be hard to make shawermah more authentic b/c meats in the US don't have much fat to begin with. But in order to make the shawermah less dry, the meats need to have fat in them. Besides the dessert, my favorite dish was deff the kebob. It came with very soft pita bread underneath it. The beef kebob was so tender and mouth watering, divine! As I mentioned earlier, the owner brought us a Lebanese dessert to try. Again, I don't know the name. I think somehow it reminded me of Asian rice cakes because of the texture. It was made of rose water, not too sweet, mind-blowingly good!!! The chef also let us try Lebanese cookies, yum!!Overall, this is a 100% solid Mediterranean/Lebanese restaurant. I was so happy that I got to come here with my friend! I greatly appreciate the hospitality and food at this establishment. Will return very soon!!"], ["Curt C.", "Food from Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine! They have their own bakery, and make their own sweets that all look incredibly delicious. The desserts are sold by the tray. The place looks like a hole in the wall, but really opens up. It's quite large, and you can watch the cooks prepare your meal. I got the beef shwarma and hummus. That's all that came with it, no rice or anything. But it was incredibly delicious. The beef was spicy, in a red creamy spicy sauce, in a large dollop of hummus. The meat was cut into inch long strips, and marinated in a red curry type of sauce. The meal came with free hummus and what looked like cucumber pico de gallo with some flat bread. The first serving of bread was served cold. When we requested more, we got fresh, hot bread. You might ask about the bread and see if you can get the hot stuff. Our waiter was clueless. It seemed like it was his first day, because he didn't know anything about the food he was serving, or how to wait on a table. We were brought food, but no plates to eat from. We never got refills, as he quit waiting on us to go run the register instead. The decor was authentic, and cool with lots of Middle Eastern stuff to check out, and a television with Arabic dance music videos. The locals really enjoy this place, and I can see why! The restaurant was clean, and well lit. Parking was easy, and safe."], ["Shohei I.", "Didn't like it at all.The bad: Ordered a side of greek style potatos and a gyro. Very disappointing. The potatoes weren't cooked all the way and super bland. The gyro doesn't even come with tahini or taziki sauce. There's a giant scoop of what tasted like sour cream. The gyro meat is overly fatty and salty.I should have known better. It's a bad sign when a mediterranean place serves french fries with sandwiches by default . The good: It's very inexpensive (~5 for the sandwich and 2 dollars additional for substitution of fries) and the service was decent."], ["Amanda B.", "The service was a little slow, however, everyone was very pleasant and the food very good. We enjoyed getting a little bit of everything and we will certainly come back!"], ["Mark F.", "This is a place that I would like go back and evaluate again. I ordered the beef shawarma, but I instantly regretted it when I saw my friend's gyro. It looked really delicious and came with fries! He said it was better than Pasha's so someday I need to go back and confirm this. My shawarma was OK. It was a bed of small pieces of beef and onions, surrounded by a ring of hummus and some naan on the side. I found myself trying to separate the onions out of it. The place was spacious inside and very affordable. The only major complaint that I would have is that it is dark inside and I prefer a well lighted place to eat. Next time I will probably sit by the front windows where the sun is.

Our drinks were not refilled at any point after this, so I went thirsty for the second half of our meal. The food was on the less pleasing side of fine. My falafel was okay, but it was crammed in a tough wrap with what I am pretty sure was a grocery store pickle and that's about it. The fries were clearly frozen.

Owners and workers alike were busily moving around the floor and up ladders to hang decorative platters on the walls. A woman was tending the grill while three spits were circular roasting meats. To her left was a separate area where a pair of men were loading plastic containers with desserts that were entirely foreign to me, I'll have to try them in the future.The waiter and I gabbed on about Arabic/Middle Eastern cuisine, where he was from, and how much I had anticipated them opening. After mulling over the menu, I ordered the Darna Kebab. Two skewers of seasoned beef/lamb mix grilled over open flame, served with basmati rice and sliced red onion topped with sumac. A refreshing salad and an individual sized plate of Hummus also came with the meal.The kebabs were fresh, delicious, well-seasoned (not overly). Just enough seasoning, not to mask the flavor of the meats that I was eating. The rice was light, fluffy, flavorful, and peppered with small batons of vermicelli. The hummus was light, creamy, dusted with a bit of spice, and drizzled with a floral olive oil. I loved it! Another thing that I LOVED was the marinated Darna Salad, which creates a symphony of textures and flavors with cucumber, tomato, onion, parlsey, mint, parsley, and lemon. The combinations of the kebab, flat bread, rice, hummus, and salad was a fantastic spread.There is an inherent freshness and quality in this type of cuisine and at this restaurant that people in San Antonio (or Texas for that matter) never get to experience. Drop that Hamburger, forkful of Olive Garden insta-pasta, and sample something LOCAL! \u00a0The flavor profiles created by the spices of this region of the world are phenomenal.

We decided to order a vegetarian plate as an appetizer because it was a great way to sample all of the greatest hits yet still leave room for a main course. There was falafel, hummos, babaganouj, dolmas and tabouli with pitas on that veggie plate. Their falafel is amazing, best in town as is their babaganouj. Their dolmas and hummos are delicious too. I opted for the sheesh tahwook (chicken kebabs) and my honey order the gyro. We both shared with our lad. I even had the option to choose biryani for the rice. Everything was wonderful. The chicken was nicely grilled, the biryani was wonderfully complex in flavor, and they are very generous with their portions. Though we could have stopped there and been satisfied, my wife asked if we could get some baklava. How could I say no to that? Here's a very helpful hint if you eat here, save room for desert.

I was fine and expected full price although the connotation of extra is somewhere in between free and full price. They likely make each serving of Dorna potatoes fresh so that is a good thing and why full price as the amount was large."], ["John H.", "My favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in San Antonio. \u00a0As a big fan of this cuisine, \u00a0I was quite pleased to see how many restaurants had popped up in the Medical Center area. \u00a0I passed this one by probably fifty times before trying it since it is a very unassuming place in a strip mall. \u00a0Big mistake...First the service is top notch. \u00a0I have never had a problem of waiting for a drink refill, gotten hummus or bread refilled, and had generally excellent service. \u00a0Now on to the important part: the food. \u00a0Darna has a good mix of dishes for those who are less experienced in the cuisine such as Shawarma and Kabob, and more exotic dishes such as eggplant hummus, lentil soups, and tikka. \u00a0Each meal comes with excellent condiments in the form of tabbouli (shredded herbs in an oil and pine nut sauce), two types of hummus, and a sweet cucumber salad. \u00a0Those alone are better than the food at any fast food restaurant. \u00a0Additionally, these meals come lavash-style bread (aka the flat and crispy kind) which is addictive as crack laced with cookies and cream ice cream. \u00a0Now on to the main course...The main courses are usually a plate of some kind of skewered and grilled meat of either lamb, chicken, or beef. \u00a0Vegetarian options also exist as eggplant is in many dishes and can be used for vegetarian dishes, if you prefer. \u00a0Next to the meat is rice which is a rice and vermicelli blend by default. \u00a0The rich has a buttery taste that makes you forget you are eating rich, and the vermicelli packs a perfect punch. \u00a0The meats are perfectly cooked and are sliced very small so they make for fun eating with torn off chunks of bread as little sandwiches with the various condiments. \u00a0Eating all of your food is a herculean task, so be prepared to take some to go or leave some on the plate.Desserts are good too, though I have only had the orange cake and the baklava. \u00a0The baklava is not the standard sweet and dry variety common in Greek restaurants, but has a cream filling that is ridiculously good. \u00a0I am normally not a fan of baklava as it is too sweet, but the cream moderates the sweetness.Bottom line, a must eat for any fan of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food."], ["Ian B.", "Excellent food, great taste. No different from food I've had at other restaurants where the chef spoke very little English. A friend who had been to Greece was also impressed. Wasn't too busy at lunch time, also lots of seating in case it is."], ["Tim B.", "My wife and I went here for lunch. We saw the reviews and the menu looked pretty good. There were about 8-10 people there when we got there. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. We waited for our food. And then waited some more. The waitress came by and said they were behind on their orders. Forty five minutes after ordering we got up and left. We went to Dimassi's buffet down the street and got the good food we were looking for within 5 minutes. Maybe they have good food at Darna. I don't know. Anyway, we won't be back there to find out.."], ["Brian F.", "Beyond displeased with my experience here. \u00a0I'll try to keep this in chronological order of the issues I experienced.So my g/f and I walk in and are unsure if it's seat yourself or wait to be seated, since there's no hostess and no sign stating what to do. \u00a0So we go ahead and take a booth. \u00a0Our \"waitress\" comes around and asks us what we'd like to eat. \u00a0Our drink order was overlooked. \u00a0So we have a couple of questions about certain items. \u00a0Trust me, I'm not that sort of customer, but some things I wasn't sure the difference between other items. \u00a0Here's where the fun really began. \u00a0There was a serious language barrier between us and the waitress. \u00a0She didn't understand what we were asking and what she was explaining to us had nothing to do with what we were asking. \u00a0So tell my g/f to get what I was familiar with and we also added an appetizer of dolmas. \u00a0Can't go wrong, right? \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0So she leaves then who I thought was the table busser comes to take our drink orders, which come out quick. \u00a0A little while later we are brought hummus, yogurts, cucumber salad and some pitas. \u00a0Then I see our waitress pushing a janitor's cart to 2 empty tables and starts cleaning them. \u00a0Then my g/f's food is brought to me, so I give it to her. \u00a0The rice was cook/dried together by the clump, chicken dry (had some flavor) and beer was even drier with no favor. \u00a0About 5 \u00a0go by in which my original table bussing waitress had passed by and I know looked at the blank area in front of me. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0So another 5 mins go by and I wave down the younger waitress, who checks on my order. \u00a0She comes back twice. \u00a0Once to retake my order and other time to verify what it was. \u00a0I end up getting sort of what I ordered. \u00a0I ordered the gyro entree but got the sandwich. \u00a0The best part of the plate was the thick warm pita. \u00a0I'll leave it at that. \u00a0Just overall not that great of a meal. Somewhere along the way the younger girl became our waitress as well. \u00a0I had to ask for a new drink too, after a while had gone by of it being empty. \u00a0During all this I see the younger and older waitress joking around and laughing with each other, while customers are neglected. \u00a0So it's finally time to pay. \u00a0Again, we had been done for quit awhile, but nobody came around to see if we need a box or the check. \u00a0So we walked up to the counter and oddly were charged for our original order that included the dolmas. \u00a0I was shocked that the original ticket did in fact exist, but somehow my order was lost within the 12 steps it took from my table to the kitchen. \u00a0We had the missing dolmas taken off and left. \u00a0The decor is a miss as well. \u00a0It looks like a Mexican restaurant (tables, booths, floor, walls) that closed down, changed all the lights to very low watt bulbs and left. \u00a0There's maybe 2 things that remind you of the Mediterranean them. \u00a0One would be the mural on the wall that's suppose to look like exposed brick and the second would be the pitcher in the middle of the dining room. \u00a0There's no wall decor, lighting fixtures or table clothes or anything like that. \u00a0Big let down. \u00a0Won't be going back."], ["Faisal A.", "Not bad at all, for the price. I ordered the gyro sandwich, and was more or less pleased with it. The pita bread is soft and tasty, and a good portion for the price (5.75). The only thing about it that I didn't enjoy was the giant dollop of what seemed like a 80-20 mix between sour cream and tzatziki sauce that was slapped down into wrap. It tasted fine, but it was placed on one end of wrap, so I had to spread it out myself before eating it. Not really sure why they do this. The hummus was about as good as hummus gets, but nothing too spectacular. Unless you've only had crappy hummus your whole life you won't be all that impressed. The baba ganoush was solid, again nothing too spectacular. I also tried my friend's chicken shawarma, which was not so good. The chicken was pretty dry, but I attributed that to the fact that we ate there at 830pm and the meat had probably been spinning all day. Not holding it against them, cuz it seemed to be the only exception in quality. The fries that come with the sandwiches are your standard wedges, I would suggest substituting for a better side. All in all, this place was average to good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 though because I think the price is very reasonable. I have yet to try any of their meat entrees, but I definitely will be back to try them - if the quality of their food is consistent I imagine they would be tasty, and they're also not that expensive it seems. Also, they had a buffet special going on for Ramadan when I went, and while I chose not to try it, the food looked pretty good. 14.95 for dinner buffet IIRC, a little steep but might be worth it.UPDATE 2/10/2015: So I have been meaning to update this for a couple months now. This place has definitely improved the quality of its food in many ways. For one, their fries are way better now. Not as thick cut, and they add seasoning to it. They taste even better when dipped in their garlic sauce, which you definitely should ask for on the side. Their sandwiches are even bigger in portion now, never light on the meat. They offer housemade bread now at the beginning of the meal which is pretty decent, it tends to dry out quickly but its not bad. I tried one of their rice entrees, and it was fantastic. What continues to impress me here the most is the size:price ratio, it is very high."], ["Amanda M.", "We stopped into Darna this afternoon for a late lunch, and were pleasantly surprised. The hummus, pita bread and appetizer salads were incredible! Super yummy. Not many places get hummus right these days, but Darna definitely does! I ordered the chicken schwarma, and my boyfriend ordered the spicy kebab entree. Both were excellent, and we loved the rice that came on the side. Our waiter brought us some complimentary dishes to sample, including some very tasty biryani and dolmas. He even gave us extra hummus, because we loved it so much... Sweet gesture :)I've had Mediterranean food all over the world, and was still impressed by this place. Great food, wonderful service and VERY reasonable prices.

His skill in combining tastes and presentation is truly impressive. \u00a0Ask him to feed you and prepare to eat like a sultan. He could easily be at an exclusive $$$$ restaurant. \u00a0His best dishes are lamb chops and his pastries, \u00a0but the salads are to die for.

After just one visit (a to go order, at that) this has become my new favorite go-to spot for Mediterranean food.Initially, I had wanted to call in our order and just pick it up but for whatever reason they were not picking up the phone. So we ended up going into the restaurant and placed our order. Service was quick and the lady at the counter was friendly. First impressions of this place was that it was huge and kept very well. Super clean, aside from the couple of small flies that were pestering the bf as we waited.After some 10-15 minutes, our order was ready and another guy recanted our order perfectly as we departed, and once we went home and opened our food...WOW.We ordered the Darna Potatoes as an appetizer. After all, who could resist some fried potatoes covered in cilantro, garlic, and lemon juice?! It was very tasty! The only drawback (and it could be because sometime had passed between us picking it up and finally opening it up to eat) was that it was a big soggy and soaked in oil (not too much but enough to notice).The combination (beef & chicken) shawermah plate is amazing! The portions are so huge that I had a food coma after eating half. The hummus isn't as tart as Jerusalem Grill, which I appreciate. The meats are seasoned perfectly.I noticed they had mint tea on their menu, which I can't wait to try!Bottom line: The price and quality (and quantity) can't be beat!"], ["Nathan S.", "Not originally setting out to go to Darna, my wife and I decided to give it a try versus going to Subway for lunch on a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon. \u00a0A great decision!Before going in, I took the \"Long-anticipated\" review with a grain of salt because, well, who says that!?, and Tim W's review, and we headed in to find a typical restaurant startup. \u00a0Very clean, new seats, tables, menus, paint, fixtures, and plenty of as of yet unoccupied space waiting for the waves of success to fill the corners with experiential knick knacks of time and the lived-in feel.A friendly gentleman in a Darna polo greets us and asks if it was for here or to go and we opted for dining in. \u00a0Quickly provided with menus and promptly ordering a Mexican Coke, the menu reminded me of Jerusalem Cafe, near Ingram Mall. \u00a0Similarly laid out menu, similar options...I wondered if it was a clone or an affiliation. \u00a0My wife orders the gyro sandwich and I point at the Darna Kebab in the sandwich column, and ask for some hummus for appetizer. \u00a0He gets very confused and asks me a series of questions and if I'm sharing. \u00a0I don't understand and realize only after he leaves that I think I just ordered the Darna Kebab plate instead of the sandwich, but we're getting an order of baba ghanoush out of the deal, too, so it is what it is. \u00a0I get to sample more things, anyway.The baba ghanoush and the hummus come out with unique puffy, Eggo-waffle colored, DVD-sized+ flatbread. \u00a0The baba ghanoush was good, but the hummus was divine!! \u00a0Darna hummus is so creamy smooth with tahini and olive oil performing their intricate and delicately delightful dance on our tastebuds. \u00a0We devoured it, marveling at the uniqueness of the bread as compared with our experience at other places, which, heretofore, Jerusalem Cafe was our favorite hummus. \u00a0Some other places may have better bread, but they can't touch the hummus.Our food comes to the table, the scents and sounds of the meat sizzling on the grill, open for us to see and hear from our table, had us tantalized during our hummuscide. \u00a0I asked the waiter if they were associated with Jerusalem Cafe (JC), and he said no. \u00a0And I was shocked. \u00a0So, now I know it's a clone, but where the JC is close in distance, by most standards, it's complicated for us to get to, and Darna Cafe will suit the aesthetics of the Medical Center lunch crowd, me thinks, while having plenty of authentic panache to draw the more indigenous of the cuisine among us. \u00a0But I gushed at the waiter of how delightful the hummus was, and he welcomed the impromptu review.The gyro sandwich got thumbs up, though the Sysco-style fries that came with it were, well, Sysco-style fries and the Darna Kebab was delicious with fresh red onions, sprinkled with spices and served with flavored rice portions - yes two different kinds of rice. \u00a0Despite nearing our stomachs' capacities, we were graciously gifted with another helping of hummus and bread. \u00a0It was as delightful as a dessert as it was as an appetizer, and even the satiation of the meal did not diminish the returns of flavor of the hummus.While all of this was served relatively quickly, we were somewhat pressed for time and as my wife left to address some remaining errands of the day, we were gifted yet again, surely a ploy to get us addicted to the deliciousness of Darna, with a sampling of their sweets (which they specifically note on their signage). \u00a0I shared the pieces with my wife when I met her and, while good in that they remind me of Mexican pastry desserts, we may need to go back to try some more. \u00a0No one will be twisting our arms to do so. \u00a0Did I mention how good the hummus is?"], ["Larry T.", "Probably the best Mediterranean food in the area.

Gyro sandwiches were huge, fresh bread, filled with lots of flavorful, tender, non-greasy meat, some sliced onion and romaine lettuce, and yummy tzaziki, and were served with an additional large piece of flatbread. \u00a0My friend ordered the hot mint tea and loved it. \u00a0We also ordered a side of hummus ($3.49), which came with some cute little round mini-pitas. \u00a0Hummus was delicious--and I have never been a big fan of it myself--maybe I was just not eating the right kind. \u00a0I even ordered more hummus to take home--for $2.99 I got a half-pint container and a roll of flatbread. \u00a0Got a piece of baklava to go ($.99)--excellent! \u00a0Not overly sweet like so many places. \u00a0By the way, they have a large selection of various baked sweets. \u00a0No listing or pricing for these on the menu, though. Atmosphere: Very big space, lots of space between tables and booths. \u00a0Quite chilly, though--thermostat near us read 71 degrees. \u00a0Some nice decor and tilework on the walls. \u00a0Large space and all hard surfaces means it could get very noisy if full (was only 25% full when we were there). You can see the pit area with the rotating meats and grill for kabobs, as well as the big spread of pastries/desserts. Service: We were immediately greeted by a friendly server. \u00a0Waiter was attentive, but not overly so. \u00a0It was a little unclear as to where to pay, but we finally just went up to the register up front.Pricing: see above and uploaded menu pics; seems very reasonable. \u00a0Love the option to change from french fries to something healthier."], ["Zeek K.", "They deliver an authentic Palestinian-style Falafil sandwich complete with hummus and tomatoes and pickles, no greens.

There's a decent variety of vapors to choose from, my favorite being green apple. I've heard the snacks here are pretty good too!

I was pretty hungry as well, so food was a necessity as well. Nestled in a little strip center, Shisha Cafe had a nice atmosphere to it, with a good balance of indoor and outdoor seating; the funky bright orange and yellow chairs were certainly strange, but I found them fun and quirky. Based on the food alone, I would have given the place 5 stars; the chicken gyro was amazing, the chicken was perfectly tender and full of flavor. However, the service was less than spectacular. Our waiter was well-meaning, although a bit unprofessional and unclear about their hookah policies. We ended up getting two hoses for two people (instead meant for four) after we were unable to discern their policy from our waiter which seemed to conflict with their menu. The hookah was alright, nothing special, but a decent price for the quality. Also, upon ordering water I was given a bottled water, and was forced to pay for it. To me, I expect water to be free for dinner and shouldn't run up a tab for consecutive bottles of water on a hot evening. Overall great food and a relaxed atmosphere, but some of the service and policies on paying and such were a bit ridiculous. I recommend trying Shisha Cafe to anyone interested as I will have to go back and check it out again myself."], ["Danny C.", "Get ready to sit back, relax, and enjoy the best hookah and Middle Eastern experience in San Antonio.Now, let's face it: there aren't any lavish cushions on the floors, low tables, nor do you have to eat with your hands sans utensils...but hey, this is good stuff!For almost 10 years now Shisha Cafe has been offering San Antonio a delicious menu of Middle Eastern foods and an extensive selection of hookah flavors at an affordable price.Upon joining the many regulars here you're welcomed by a host, seated either inside or outside (usually according to your preference now that they've expanded the outside area with an incredible wooden deck and covering), and given a menu that encompasses everything from delicious flavored tobaccos to fresh blended smoothies.My personal favorites? I'm glad you asked. I tend to mix tobacco flavors: vanilla, blackberry, & blueberry. It's a smooth, fruity combination. When I'm hungry I definitely can't resist the Chicken Shawerma sandwich.

It was really chill and \u00a0relaxed. What really made it feel authentic was the overhead music and the aroma. It would be really cool if they got belly dancers to perform every now and then. Our waiter was funny and very attentive. I had the Falafel sandwich.

I've tried a few places, but none have really provided authentic Arabic food. This restaurant provides the best Arabic food I've had in the U.S. The service is up and down. It seems like people fly through there pretty quickly and no one is really properly trained, but it's worth dealing with because the food is so great.I particularly love the Shirazi salad, Falafel, and Chicken Shawarmas.

A fountain bubbles away in the background and you can opt for the deck or the stone, but both are equally pleasant. While I was in, country music filled the air, but I'll admit, I was sort of hoping for a more traditional musical selection, though it was fun to sing along and tap my foot regardless. I tasted a few things off the menu, and I almost decided to go back for dinner. Flavorful. Delicious. My mouth is watering again...

The addition of a patio in the last year ish has been nice. No more sitting on wobbly chairs out on a dirt patch! The food is good, cheap and fast. They are open late for the after club crowd. They do not serve booze. I recommend the falafel sandwich or plate. Their falafel are some of the best around. The chicken shawarma is also good both in plate or sandwich form. They put a slice of dill pickle in the sandwich. It's a nice surprise that compliments the sandwiches nicely. My only complaint is that I find the kebab to be dry. Ask for a side of the delicious creamy garlic sauce and dip everything in it! The hummus is also a winner and their hot tea is brewed perfectly. The 4 star rating comes from the fact that it can get a little crowded and the tables do not turn over quickly because people tend to linger and chit chat. Also, if you are allergic to smoke, there is a lot of fragrant shisha smoke floating around."], ["Ashley V.", "I've only had it to go because the hookah scent is way intense inside but the food is awesome.

I paid more than $30 for a plate of lamp that I really didn't like anything in there.. Plus I asked for an extra pita and they told me I needed to pay $2 plus tax!!! It's more like you're spending your money at fogo de chao over McDonald's crap!!!"], ["Helga M.", "This is my FAVORITE Greek restaurant in town! My bf and I found it thanks to Groupon. Other reviews are correct in saying that the location in a run down shopping strip can be a turn off. Don't let that deter you because you won't regret it! The owner or at least a family member are always present to be sure everything is as it should be. The first time we went Dimi was the one who took care of us. He recommended the rolled grape leaves (Dolmades) for an appetizer and the Hercules platter for two. We were amazed with the flavor and freshness of both plates. The grapes were tasty and stuffed to perfection. The Hercules platter it's like a sampler for two. It includes gyro meat and two types of shishkabobs (beef and chicken) along with potatoes, two salads and pita bread. It was delicious and just enough for two! Don't forget to leave room for dessert. They are always great here and they sell out fast. We shared a Dimi's original better than sex cake. How ca you go wrong with a name like that! ;)The friendly service and family atmosphere is what keeps me coming back for more! There's also belly dancing on the weekends and it gets pretty crowded but to me that's a sign of an outstanding restaurant with unbelievable food. I will keep coming back as long as they are open!"], ["Alvaro S.", "Just delightful!!!!! Had lamb chops cooked to the perfect point!!! The waiter was awesome and desert was great!!!

Greek salad was perfect, topped off a perfect dinner with baklava. This place has authentic food, music, wonderful service, and a fun atmospere that makes you want to return. My wife and I truly loved this place and hope to return before we leave town. Thank you Mina and Dimi."], ["Tina R.", "Belly dancing on Friday night. Need I say more? Yeah, I guess I need to describe the rest of the experience to include the meal. We started with a goat cheese appetizer that was set aflame. It was served with pita slices-wonderful presentation & savory, smooth flavored. We ordered lamb shank which was on special and the gyro platter. The lamb was stewed in tomatoes & onion. Delish! Served with a fresh salad & oven potatoes, i enjoyed this dish. The meat on the gyro platter was plentiful and well-seasoned. I teamed the meal with a nice Greek lager then we finished with an order of baklava. The baklava was perfect! Honey, cinnamon, walnuts, flaky layers of philo dough came together deliciously! Highly recommend, lunch or dinner!"], ["Munchy M.", "Went here with the wife in search of SA's holy grail of Greek food. Don't know if we found it just yet, but Mina & Dimi's definitely stands as the best Greek cuisine we've enjoyed locally. We ordered the saganaki to start (of course), two gyros for the main course, and the kadaifi dessert to finish the meal since it does look quite interesting. The saganaki came first, and was so so. I tend to expect a crispy exterior after the flambe, and a nice melted inner. But unfortunately the saganaki didn't deliver the varied textures I find familiar, so I was disappointed there. It was pretty much a delicious blob. Next came the gyros, and for both me and wife, this was the highlight of our meal. The pita tasted both soft and fresh, the gyro meat tasted super savory, the veggies tasted fresh and delicious, and the tzatziki sauce added tart relief to the gyro's robust palette of flavors. Excellent gyro; would definitely get this again. As for the kadaifi though, we found it's dryness and minimal fruit filling to be downers. When we visit again, we'll skip this dessert for sure, sample a bit more on the menu, and maybe indulge once more in that outstanding gyro!"], ["Melissa O.", "Amazing. My absolute favorite Greek food around. Everything tasted great, service was fantastic, out waiter remembered us and our favorite wine and preferences in food and dessert. Will definitely be taking my friends here in the future!"], ["Brianna T.", "This was an absolutely wonderful experience! From the moment we walked in the door the server was incredible. Knowledgable, friendly, and hilarious! We started out with a well seasoned, wonderfully prepared hummus. It was a perfect amount, and we finished it moments before our main entrees arrived. My companion loved the gyro. It was very traditional, but delicious! I had the chicken on a stick. The lemon pepper and honey mustard played off each other very well, and the chicken was cooked perfectly!! My main recommendation however would have to be the feta fries. They were phenomenal!!!!"], ["Jessica G.", "Total gem! The food is flavourful, plenty to share & by far my favorite Greek spot. The gyro platter was delicious & the salad hit the spot. A must \"check out\"!"], ["Megan M.", "Probably \u00a0the most bizarre experience I've ever had at a restaurant, let alone a place of business. \u00a0WATCH OUT!!!!!! there is definitely \u00a0a scam going on with the wine and beverage offwrings. Me and a girlfriend \u00a0ordered \u00a0a bottle of wine (no wine list nor prices discussed or listed) and once we finished the last glass the waitress Ross showed up and poured wo consent a another glass of wine. Then she proceeded to sit w us and invite a cook over and both drank this bottle of wine. We thought it was weird but proceeded to the register wo dispair. At the register there was a party before us who were arguing about the number of bottles/ glasses they had. After a long heated debate it was our turn. We were being charged the original bottle plus 2 glasses at 6.75 a piece (only after the bottle dispute prior end in her favor). The register lady and the waitress started to push us to split the check. I repeatedly \u00a0asked for a break down. Then the argument started. The waitress \u00a0started yelling at me saying I couldn't hold my liqour. She told me to fuck off, that I was a bitch, wasting her time etc. Then mgmt told me to calm down because there was children although apparently she didn't care that her waiters steal, drink on the job, and scream profanity at their customers. \u00a0I would never come here again.

Wasn't too crazy about the taste in food...."], ["Chelsea M.", "This place really surprised me. There isn't a vast selection of good quality food around Lackland AFB, so I'm really happy to have stumbled upon this one. It's nothing much on the exterior, as it's located in a crummy strip mall. The inside is pretty small, gets packed during weekday lunch. Also, not the cleanest place I've eaten. The staff is awesome. They're friendly and upbeat, and food comes out fairly fast.My boyfriend likes their gyro meat better than Pasha. I get the falafel pita, and I'm leaning toward liking Mina's more. The falafel is perfectly crisped on the outside, great spice and flavor. The tzatsiki (can't spell) sauce is the best I've ever had. No question. It's thicker than I'm used to, but it's perfect. And the pita. My boyfriend and I agree that we could sit here and just eat pitas. Fluffy amazingness. I get salad on the side...get the fries if you like to. Best fries I've had in a long time. Fried and covered with herbs and spices."], ["Jane A.", "Absolutely delicious!!! I tried this place, for the first time, 09/02/14 because I'm training for a job in the complex. I have been there 3 consecutive days since then and I plan on going tomorrow 09/05. I'm not (well, i wasn't) HUGE on Greek food, but it was DELICIOUS!! I've tried different things each day and EVERYTHING is absolutely scrumptious. I agree, definitely located in a not-so-attractive area, but absolutely worthy of a visit! The staff are very playful, so a sense of humor or readiness to enjoy your visit is a must! Don't expect prim-and-proper because they treat you as if they've known you for some time (even if you just met... At least that's how I was greeted). Richard is very helpful and the one I've seen 2/3 times that I've been there. I will definitely take my friends and relatives for a good eat and entertainment on friday/saturday (as I hear it's a good-time)!"], ["Mike B.", "Lots of people love Mina & Dimi's; however, I am not one of them. Paradoxically, it's the very popularity of this little restaurant that creates the thing I like least about it: the dining area is just plain too small for the crush of humanity that populates the place at lunchtime. Your chair is literally bumping against that of the person sitting at a table behind you, making for an overly cozy, unpleasant experience. And on the days when they have a belly dancer working the room, the claustrophobia is just too much to bear. I'm reminded of Yogi Berra saying, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\"The food is good, but I don't find it nearly as good as do so many of the other reviewers here. The meat is not particularly flavorful, and the pita is doughy. And the prices are nothing to get excited about. I will say that the dessert case looks very good, although I've never sampled anything from it. Your mileage may vary."], ["Angie S.", "This is a little hole in the wall place with lots of flavor! Ordered a gyro sandwich- one of the best I have had! Their hummus and put bread is absolutely delicious.

What a GEM! This place is in an older, kind of run down strip mall, so I was a little unsure at first, but when you walk in the door, the smells are amazing! We started with Greek Salads, and I knew from the quality of the feta that we were in for a real treat. I ordered the Lamb \u00a0Souvlaki Kabob, my husband had the Lamp Chops.. both were beyond delicious. The shock for me was the fried Okra.. I hate okra.. but this was actually good. The best pita I've ever had, the Tzatziki was amazing.. I've had some really great Greek food in my life, but this was the best I've had so far.Oh, and chocolate baklava and belly dancers, what more could you even ask for? Unfortunately for us, this is a once in a lifetime trip. We came to San Antonio to see my son-in-law graduate from boot camp, so unless I can convince another relative to join the Air Force, we probably won't be back. If they air mailed food, I'd order the lamb, pita, and tzatziki once a week!"], ["Parker J.", "This place isn't in the best location and it may look unappealing at first glance. However, I have eaten here three times now and it is excellent. They have specials all the time and I have never had something I didn't like.

They serve food on par with any quality Greek restaurant."], ["Nick M.", "I come here often because the food and staff are fabulous!

Its located on a shady side of town, in an easy to miss shopping strip with an unimpressive store front. BUT...The food here is Authentic, Flavorful & Amazing. When I want something simple, I'll order the Gyro platter because its one of those dishes you don't have to 'hope' will be solid, you KNOW it will be great every time. The meat is full of flavor and is NOT over cooked like at many other Mediterranean restaurants around town. Paired with the tasty creamy tzatziki sauce, the gyro here is hard to beat. I also enjoy their fries because the extra spices they use take this normally unnoticed side dish to another level. I've tried the lamb shank on special and didn't regret it. The meat literally fell off the bone and it had a nice medley of seasonings. The DESSERTS here are pretty dang good too but my personal faves are the Baklava & the Better Than Sex Cake so be sure to save room. \u00a0The service here is usually stellar & I love the waitstaff here b/c they are typically very warm, some even have a great sense of humor and will poke fun. You also don't have to wait long to get your grub on which is a big + in my book.

The food was so darn delicious, the small pieces of skewered and seasoned beef were so tender and juicy, the tzatziki sauce had such a nice garlicky coolness, the warm pita was so buttery that my over-enthusiasm led to my untimely tongue tragedy.

I'm a huge fan of eggplant, and, more specifically, babaganoush. I try it anywhere they serve it, and I even make it. Not a fan of this version, which has yogurt added to it. I've never been a fan of tabuli/tabouli. \u00a0Usually it has lots of parsley with a few tiny pieces of tomatoes and cracked wheat with lemon juice. \u00a0HOWEVER, THE KISIR ROCKED! \u00a0This kisir is light, fresh and bursting with Flavor! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!Ordered one hot app, Patlican Kizartma (fried eggplant slices served with yogurt & garlic sauce). \u00a0 I love eggplant (Patlican) but the yogurt was all I could taste and it was applied to the slices before serving. I wouldn't order it again. We split the entree, Iskender Kebab ($14.99 dinner entree): a northern Turkey specialty. Doner kebab meat, cubes of pita bread (not ur typical pita - thicker and TASTY!), in tomato sauce and butter with yogurt on the side. Excellent! We loved it!! Great flavors!We finished with a dessert to go, the Kazandibi (baked custard with a caramelized sugar top). Turkish flan? Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Just kinda *meh* to me. It was thin & heavy. \u00a0Nothing special. But will we return? Hells Yeah!! \u00a0Cem was a phenomenal server!! He was personable, friendly, & knowledgeable.

I had stopped coming here for about two years but recently returned. While I can say that the older man is no longer here, their food is still top notch. Despite the smaller portions (which saddens me immensely), the Doner Kebab (my absolute favorite) will give you goosebumps as the flavor encases your tongue.

Everything on this plate was excellent, and we ate it with what may be the best flatbread I've ever had.For our main courses, we had beef shish kebab, doner kebab and chicken tava.

Lunch prices are outstanding - five of us had lunch entrees and a light shared dessert for under $60 including tax and tip.On my first visit I had what they bill as \"Turkish Ravioli\" -- a plate of unusually textured something (not pasta) with a delicious yogurt sauce. \u00a0Unlike many Turkish restaurants the garlic was present but not overpowering. \u00a0I liked it, but a whole plate was 'way too much of the same thing.Today I tried an eggplant and beef dish - perfectly seasoned though I found the large cooked tomatoes which topped it to be a bit much. \u00a0The plate included a generous portion of delicious rice - my favorite part of the meal, because I like to explore differences among types of rice.Portions, by the way are HUGE. If you order the doner on a pita you will have your next meal to take home.My problem?

Enter, The Turquoise Grill. \u00a0Although this place is a bit hidden, nestled along the access road before you get to the Wonderland of the Americas please seek this place out. You will not be disappointed. Living in the city my whole life there are only two types of food you can eat here: Tex-Mex and oh...Tex-Mex. And the thought of trying new foods besides tacos can sometimes proves to be a daunting idea. However, coming to the Turquoise Grill \u00a0it's kinda cool being taken out of ones comfort zone and all my fears quickly dissipate. When you come to this place it is like you are transported to another place in time, to another country. The music, smells and atmosphere are so different and unique it felt like I was in some oasis in the desert. On this day it was the dinner crowd was arriving, presumably from work, so it was getting packed. But the tables are so spread out it creates this ease. You can have a conversation with another person and it will not infringe on your neighbor's space.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Another great thing about this place is the service waiter who served us on this night was beyond excellent. He was totally friendly and attentive. In addition he brought all our items out as soon as they were ordered. I ordered the Sigara Boregi, as an appetizer. It was four pieces of fried dough stuffed with cheese. These little fellas were the shizzo! I have never tasted anything like that in my life, ever!  \u00a0For the main course I had the Doner Kebab, which is pieces of shanked beef and lamb on top rice and vegetables. It is also accompanied with pita bread. The end result is a \u00a0joyful marriage of taste and spices on your palette. Yummy times ten!!! Although, for people who think that The Panda Express is high-end dining this place may seem pricey to you. My advise to you is to wait until they have a special offer on groupon, as they have this promotion often to defray any costs. In addition the price you pay for your food is very much warranted, as they serve you a healthy portion. In my case there was ample food left enough for dinner the next day.  \u00a0 \u00a0Great food, service and experience equals happiness. The Turquoise Grill surpasses all of this. Like other Yelpers who have written great comments about this restaurant this is a hidden gem in a sea of Tex-Mex food.

The bread was amazing, and I loved having so many dip options. Each was tasty and unique. Our main dish was good, very filling, although I am definitely going to give another menu option a try next time. Our waiter was quick to refill our drinks and friendly. We ended up spending about $35 total, including drinks and a tip. The place was a little sparse for a Saturday night, maybe due to the plain exterior of the building. The food, however, was fabulous. Turquoise Grill is definitely a hidden treasure here in San Antonio... one that I will be back to soon!"], ["Larry T.", "Okay. Place looks a little plain.

For appetizers, my friend and I split the fried eggplant with yogurt drizzled on top - it was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. We also got some cheese filled phyllo with a delightful sprinkling of fresh parsley on top - wonderful! Like a fried spring roll of cheesy goodness! The bread was awesome! Not like pita, it was kinda foccasia like but less dense and bursting with flavor!We split the doner and istanbul kebabs for entrees. I was expecting meat on a stick, but, not so! I was cool with that...I like being surprised. The doner was quite delicious - beef and lamb seasoned well and hammered into thin pieces served with red onions, cabbage, and a delicious potato salad. The istanbul was also beef and lamb but smothered with a tomato sauce with hunks of fresh cubed bread mixed in and yogurt served on the side. Also good but I personally preferred the doner. I'd go back, but, not in a rush to do so. Definitely a cool place to check out and a nice change of pace!"], ["Tzahi E.", "Was actually really good! the kabab and rice were delicious!the location is kind of bad but the food makes it worth to find!"], ["Brad S.", "I don't know much about Turkish food, but Turquoise Grill was a welcome primer to the cuisine.My visit to the restaurant was on a Friday night when they were busy and getting busier. After I got my seat, I ordered a dolma starter and a braised lamb shank. Despite the multitude of people who were seated before me but still had yet to order, my meal arrived incredibly fast. I attribute that to two things - the dolma was probably prepared earlier that day and refrigerated, and the lamb - if it was properly braised - had probably been cooking for hours before I arrived. This is an acceptable treatment for both of these dishes, so I was glad I could be fast-tracked to eating.The dolmas were light and savory, with pine nuts offering a textural element and lemon juice providing a nice sharp citrus notes. I felt bad for eating all four of them, especially in light of the wonderfully fresh and complimentary bread, but some things have to be done.The lamb was braised in a tomato-based sauce and wrapped with eggplant. Normally, I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but I thought its soft texture and slightly bitter taste worked nice with the lamb. The meat fell off the bone, which was a sign of proper cooking. I thought more of the sauce would have been more appropriate, especially since the fat of the lamb diluted the sauce somewhat.The lamb came with a side of mashed potatoes, an option I found clunky against the elegant presentation of the lamb. They weren't very good, to boot, tasting watered-down."], ["Jonathan W.", "Afiyet Olsun! May it be to your health! This food is fantastic.

Damn you, travel channel!I arrived towards the end of lunch so the crowd starting to die down. My server led me to a table and was very courteous and prompt. Bread was delivered to me right after I placed my drink order. The bread was unlike any I'd had before, but it reminded me of a focaccia. It wasn't until halfway through my first piece that I realized my table was missing the olive oil/sumac spice blend. So after retrieving said bottle of olive oil, I proceeded to shake the crap out of the bottle, since the sumac spice blend was caked to the bottom of the bottle (in a sediment layer) ***I'd recommend they bring out a small plate of dry spices with olive oil to add***Not 10 minutes had gone by, and my Doner Kebab wrap arrived. At $6.99, it seem decently priced on the lunch menu! The wrap itself was piping hot and was served with a side of pickled onions and red cabbage. The tortilla that enveloped the beef/lamb/tomato/lettuce was nicely grilled. Although the meat was moist and tender, it could definitely be MORE SPICE FORWARD and a bit of char-goodness from the alleged spit roasting wouldn't hurt. I'm not afraid of your Turkish spices, BRING IT ON! Having said that, the two condiments along with the cucumber yogurt sauce were essential to meld the flavors. Two bites doner (with sauce) and a bite each of the onion and cabbage is my recommendation :) Overall, I thought the wrap had a nice beefy flavor, oddly reminiscent of carne asada.

Sometimes I have no choice but to do so.Recently, my pal and I stopped at Turquoise for a quick supper. \u00a0My companion and I shared an order of Dolma, and she then opted for a simple salad.

Thin slices of marinated lamb and beef, slow-grilled on a vertical rotisserie, served with vegetables and rice for 12.95.\" Sounds good, doesn't it? \u00a0I wish it had been. What I was served was a plate of white rice piled high with unidentifiable paper thin slices of what looked like beef jerky that was dessicated and wholly devoid of any flavor. If \u00a0there was any lamb in this dish, I could not find any, not that it would have improved \u00a0this entree in any way. This evening might have ended there and I would have chalked it up as just a mediocre meal, but our server never asked how our food tasted, nor did he comment on the fact that both of us had left the majority of our food untouched.

What's the deal with these young girls that are hostesses. Why isolate people when there is room in the open bright area of the restaurant.The food was blah. A nice presentation but there was no seasoning. I'm guessing it was prepared at Sysco and warmed up at Pasha. We had samosas and falafel. In a city that serves great Mexican food this place serves bland tasteless Mediterranean fare. I don't get it. Spice it up.The waiter was very good. I think he was overqualified for Pasha. It's not the waiters fault the food, if eaten with a blindfold, would be hard to identify. More proof that today's diners don't know s... from Shinola."], ["Jeremy K.", "Much like their Wurzbach location this Pasha delivers excellent quality food as well as great service. I often order out from here and have yet to be disappointed! You can't go wrong with the shawarma plate and some extra pita with hummus!"], ["Natalie P.", "Giving just a star because the service was beyond horrible, but the food was good. The waiter took our order 25 minutes after we sat down. He ran to the table behind us to get the order, even though the person sat down 10 minutes after our table. He forgot the soup that someone at our table ordered. At most restaurants you get soup before the meal unless it's requested. We had to remind him about the soup, so second time he apologized. Got our food an hour or so after we sat down and even partial was wrong. Manager came by and said about comping desserts and we were like we don't care about the comps. You're providing a service so make sure it is given to the customer. Now comes time for our checks, the waiter messed up on that also. And when we turned around, he was chatting and goofing off with other wait staff. So a person from our table goes up to him to ask about \u00a0our check and his answer was he's waiting for the manager. So another waiter asked if he got the manager and his answer was No. Apparently he didn't care about customer service, so why is he working in an environment that requires customer service as a main stream of customers coming back. If you're apologizing to the customer make sure you mean it and don't keep messing up. This was the worst restaurant service ever!!!"], ["Chris M.", "Best resturant for Mediterranean food in San Antonio.Been coming here for 5 years now and it's always been consistent and welcoming. We drive 10 miles for the Pasha at 1604 and Blanco. Passing one just for the warm welcome we recieve. Warm family atmoshpere, always quick to assist. There is so much pride in this establishment. Normally I order Gyro platter. Basmati rice is great.Kabobs are fantastic! You cannot go wrong with Pasha!!!!!"], ["Tim C.", "My wife and I ate here twice in the last two days and the Yelp reviews that led us here were on the money, \u00a0The first thing to hit your table after placing your drink order is a flying carpet-sized pita/nan flat bread, with olive oil and spices in a small saucer, it was delectable, i don't think we were able to eat more than half of it on either visit, we hated to waste it! \u00a0The beef shwarma plate with hummus and greek salad was very very good, the chicken sheesh tawook plate was excellent, grilled chicken breast...yum! \u00a0Koobideh Kabob, two skewers of ground beef or.

I will definitely be back!"], ["Shai M.", "very good presentation very good service just to bad that the food is just ok .the best part of the dinner was the fresh bread and the turkish coffee at the end.the hummus is without flavor ,the falafel very heavy and does not taste good at all !!!the lamb and the rice was very dry.i am a little disappointed \u00a0from this place."], ["Jessica R.", "Great service and food was delicious, as usual. \u00a0Giro plate and flavored tea hit the spot."], ["Racha Z.", "So here it goes. My husband and were there for lunch. We both got the chicken shawrma lunch special, which comes with greek salad but we wanted tabouleh instead.

The 3 stars go for the complimentary bread they give out, omg it was super delicious!! Baba ghanoush and hummus were very good as well.I would go back just for the bread and the baba ghanoush that is ALL.On top of it all, our waiter was very unwelcoming since the min we sat down at the table to the point of where we were contemplating to ask for a different waiter."], ["Michael S.", "Don't go to this location. They had only 2 people seated with a full staff walking around talking. The girl at the front was having problems at the register. She called the manager a couple of times.

The restaurant was packed but we were seated in under 10 minutes with great and attentive service! I prefer this location as it is close to my workplace but also fast!My table was served immediately and we each got an item off the lunch menu. I personally got the beef shawarma plate. It was delicious! Not salty at all! I loved the greek salad and the dressing was a bit different than normal greek dressings. I also loved that it was not smothered by the dressing! I didn't use much of the tahini sauce as I preferred the oil mixture that was served with our naan. I can't wait to go back for lunch.

A rainbow trout with skin that was grilled to perfection with a little bit of lemon and olive oil. \u00a0It came with Basatmi rice that was mixed with sweet olives (& I usually don't even like olives), and grilled vegetable slightly basted with olive oil. \u00a0There was a complementary naan bread that was humungous and as big as the plate! Along with olive oil dipping sauce. \u00a0I pretty much polished off everyhing put in front of me, exceot couldnt finish the huge naan bread. \u00a0I highly recommend this place!"], ["Joy S.", "I'm quite torn on how to rate this place. On one hand, as others have mentioned, the complimentary unlimited bread is phenomenal. A huge, freshly made slab of naan. Unfortunately, the olive oil that is included for dipping (and poured over all their hummus) is absolutely disgusting. I honestly don't know how they continue to serve it. It tastes almost rancid and ruins everything. The hummus itself is very bland, \u00a0tasting almost like straight pulverized beans. The garlic topped hummus is, I'm shocked to hear myself say, TOO garlicky! Can't we find a happy medium?? I ordered the gyro lunch plate, which had a huge portion, especially for the price. The taste was average and the meat was oddly lukewarm. Tip: Order the plate over the gyro sandwich; you'll get more food. I'll be returning, but only for the bread."], ["Tj D.", "Great place!! \u00a0Great food, good service, need a good wine menu though and hot sauce. \u00a0We had the bread..yum..the falafels were terrific and the gyro amazing!!

I promised not to go back after a terrible experience last year but was in the mood for Mediterranean food so I figured give it one more shot. Well..bad idea.

I've been living in Austin for the last 2.5 years without any decent Mediterranean and I've finally found some since I've moved to San Antonio!The complimentary starter of bread with hummus and oil and spices is fantastic.

I'll be back again and again to try more of this awesome menu."], ["Georgina M.", "Pasha is one of my favorite places to eat outside of loop 1604. On my last visit, I came during an off time because I was dining alone and I always feel really guilty taking up a table during prime time rushes if it's just me. This is actually one of the best places for a woman dining alone (If you don't want to be bothered) because they do not have a bar and do not serve alcohol. You don't need to worry about drunken creeps coming up to you while you're reading your book and enjoying your dinner. The service is decent. The servers not overly enthusiastic but they get the job done in an efficient manner and are never rude. I can not say enough good things about their menu. The Gyro platter or the vegetarian plate are my favorites because you get a little bit of everything. The hummus here is particularly good. The other great thing about Pasha's menu is that there is something for everyone. So if you have a friend who isn't very adventurous, fear not, because Pasha has plenty of \"safe\" options along with the more exotic. All are made with the same care and quality ingredients. They have a well-edited children's menu which is a great way to introduce a new cuisine to little ones. If you enjoy hot tea, order a pot with your meal. It is always perfectly steeped and comes in a little metal pot and glass cup. Bonus- they bring you sugar cubes for your tea. The only real problem I have with Pasha is that I ALWAYS end up overeating."], ["Dominic F.", "I work near by, so I strolled on over to pasha to pick up an order I called in to-go. On the phone- they were pleasant and helpful. Repeated my order and gave me a total. They were very helpful and knew their menu. I was greeted when I arrived and told my order was almost ready. I asked if I could add something to my order and she said of course, making a change wasn't an issue at all. \u00a0Which was great so I could get what I really wanted. The environment was nice and it wasn't too loud. My order was right. The price was right.And the service was just right. I would recommend this restaurant not only for the food but also the service. Thanks for the food pasha. Cheers"], ["Rody A.", "Always an amazing place to be at. Saeed the manager I believe was incredible!! Constantly checking in on the tables making sure everything was great.

Place was recommended by friends."], ["Joshua M.", "This restaurant has large portions, fresh food, unique favors, and comfortable atmosphere. I entered and went to the bathroom to wash my hands, very clean bathroom, but soap was on the last pump before running out. I told the busboy, which told me he would do it immediately. They bring out TONS of bread, more than they should, because it is filling, and there is no end to it. Dipping sauce is olive oil and spices. I ordered the Schwarma plate, I didn't know what Schwarma looked like, so when I got my plate, I was happy to eat it. After a few minutes of eating, they realized they gave me the wrong plate, but brought my real Schwarma plate too. I had a ton of food to take home later. The plate I was eating was the Gyro plate, and it was very tasty. The kids plate came with a coke, which is nice, and the wait staff were very patient with us as a group. The restaurant was smaller than I thought, because the outside looks so big.

Now that we've moved, I try to go when I visit, and I made a point to try this location earlier this week.First impression is that this location looks huge from the outside- and inside, it's larger than the other one but not by too much. Very creative use of the space, love the flatscreens in the bar area.My sister works nearby and goes here frequently and warned me that the customer service was pretty bad here- and as much as I tried to convince her she must have just had an off day when she went, the guy we had was clearly either inexperienced or simply didn't care. Way too casual, had us repeat the orders several times and didn't seem to understand the dishes we were ordering- aren't employees supposed to be familiar with the menu?The food was okay but I should have ordered differently- I usually get the chicken shwarma plate, but this time I tried the Pasha Bowl with chicken shwarma, and it was mostly rice with a scant amount of chicken, lots of shirzi and cucumber salad. Not bad, but a little lackluster. Seemed to be missing something.The bread here though can't be beat."], ["Paul S.", "I will never understand why so many people like this place. Service is wretched, food is often cold."], ["Ken G.", "Service was quick but lacking. We ordered an appetizer & chicken shwarma wraps. The manager brought our wraps but not the appetizer. We told her we were missing our appetizer & that I wanted ketchup. A few minutes later our waitress came to check on us. She had no idea we told the manager about our missing appetizer & ketchup. We told her & I saw her go put the appetizer in the computer. We decided not to get it as we were almost done eating. The wraps were ok but nothing to write home about. We lived In the Middle East for 5 years & know what shwarma is supposed to taste like. All in all not a good experience."], ["Aide M.", "We like the food here. Even my children like the food!

Giant helping of gyro with salad and hummus all for only $10, plus the giant naan was delish."], ["Andrya S.", "After having several less-than-satisfactory experiences with the mediterranean food around here, it is so nice to find a place that is authentic and fresh. We lived in Europe for the last few years, and our all-time favorite eatery was Greek.. while Pasha is not quite there, they are the closest thing we have found. The unlimited bread and oil is a nice touch, and we haven't had anything off the menu that hasn't been fantastic. The food comes out quickly, the portions are a good size, the staff has always been friendly and prompt, and I particularly love that my hot tea is real (and in a pot, with sugar cubes and refills included!.. I can't stand when other places charge me $3 for a cup of hot water and a lipton bag...) \u00a0Beware the garlic sauce if you are on a date!!! It's amazing, but holy-fire-breathing.... The only thing that I would love to see is the addition of wifi..."], ["Elizabeth R.", "Sure, the sombrero-shaped roof top at the Wurzbach location confused everyone I ever took there , but Pasha's has taken care of that :) The only thing you'll be confused about in here is the amount of food you will actually make room for, unconsciously, in order to enjoy Pasha's delicious menu offerings. The Naan is like a safety blanket of love and pure carb joy brought to you by exotic gods with thick eyebrows and beautiful olive skin. The Braised Lamb and the Shawarma Trio are my go-to entrees. The Hummus is glorious. The Falafels are outstanding. Prepare to roll out of there, my friends. Go. You will not regret it."], ["Altovise R.", "This is a beautiful restaurant for a casual dining place. I came in around 8 pm so the lights were turned down low and there were only couples dining.

I typically get the gyro plate and have found that with an appetizer my husband and I can easily split it. Especially after the whole eating my weight in flat bread thing. When I'm feeling really decadent I get the moussaka. It's like a lasagna only better. I think it's the b\u00e9chamel sauce. Need I say more?

I recommend the Chicken Sheesh Tawook (comes with a garlic sauce that Emeril would LOVE) or Beef Kebab - so flavorful! Their Greek salad has a nice dressing but is usually COVERED in feta cheese, so I usually sub Pasha Potatoes - lemony, garlicy, cilantro goodness!!!

Lots of pickling, cooling salads & sides to offset deep earthy flavors & distinct spices with a wide variety of taste buds been hit. Pasha steps up to that plate offering a variety of regional food like Kibbeh, bamia, moussaka & shawarma. I admire them stepping beyond the bounds of kebabs & pitas. I think this place wants you to love their grilled items like the kebobs but honestly where you find the complexity of spices & flavors are in their non-grilled items. The garlic tapenade with the chicken shawarma makes that dish a homerun. Their stews are rich & deep in flavor using unusual vegetables like okra, eggplant & cauliflower. \u00a0The hummus is a absolute must!! They start your meal of with a complementary large flat bread with olive oil & dried herbs. Trying the vegetarian dish as an appetizer which offers your choice of any 4 sides from a offering of 8 is a great way to taste the hummus, tabouli, sharazi salad, ect. Pasha has a diverse menu & serves up satisfying entrees.

As some who usually doesn't like felafel, I can say these were exceptionally good.Then there was my meal, the Turkish pizza (Karisik Pide). \u00a0This was baked bread with ground meat, Turkish sausage, Turkish spices, and melted mozzarella cheese.

It comes wrapped in egg plant with tomatoes, rice, cabbage, and onions. It is very flavorful and at a reasonable price. I recommend that you look at the menu before you go so you can be prepared to order. There's a lot of different dishes and appetizers. Also, there are plenty of desserts to try out as well.

This place is one of those places that is a bit of a 'secret' in that it isn't wildly popular (although it SHOULD be) and is kinda tucked away. This is an authentic Turkish restaurant.

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the service. It isn't bad at all, it's actually quite friendly. It's just not that customer focused service that Americans have come to expect everywhere. You know - where the staff gives fakes smiles and acts like they're thrilled to have you.

I told him again I wanted the vegetarian eggplant and he kept saying Mediterranean and then trailing off. He kept getting the words vegetarian and Mediterranean confused. He had to go and ask his family sitting at a table behind us what it was. Finally I received what I ordered. It was also very good. One member of our party had to wave the boy over three times to get a refill, which I found unacceptable due to us being the only patrons. We had the baklava and rice pudding for dessert.

The food was great all the spices and vegetables went well together with the meat. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for great food in a relaxing setting."], ["Lisa S.", "Good food! Good customer service! The service here was very friendly and attentive. Hubby has spent some time in the Middle East and considers this place a good choice. I liked that there are good options here for vegetarians like me. We will be back."], ["Chris G.", "Average food and they didn't accept my groupon!I went because I had a groupon. When we got there the host sat us right away and immediately asked if we wanted an appetizer while we continued to look through the menu. We just asked for water to start. Ended up ordering the mezze platter and some falafel. About ten minutes later he brought out our food, but still hadn't brought any water. We asked again while we started on our meal. The food was all in all pretty average compared to other Turkish/Mediterranean restaurants in San Antonio. The hummus tasted like there was squeeze bottle lemon juice in it and the falafel was ver bland. I felt like I was eating a hush puppy at sea island. Did I mention that the waiter still did not bring any thing to drink. We asked for a third time for water and had finally brought some out. Because our groupon was for 20 dollars and we had only put about 17 or so on the bill we decided to order some baklava for desert. This I can say was the best thing we ate here.The reason I gave only one star? Aside from the food being pretty average and unimpressive, the waiter when bringing out the bill noticed my phone out with the groupon logo on it and immediately said he could not accept it. He then started stringing off a list of excuses why he couldn't. He said his boss gets very angry, that we couldn't use it because we didn't order dinner (we ordered appetizers, but there were no unusual restrictions in the groupon fine print). It was difficult to make out what he was saying and before we could even begin to understand what was going on and why he didn't accept the groupon, he snatched our card up from the table (which we were primarily planing on using for a tip) and ran off to run it. He seemed angry and was being a little rude. As he was walking away with our card I said \"I still don't understand,\" to which he replied \"then you cook.\" I rarely ever don't leave a tip, and usually feel bad if I don't, but in this case we left 0 dollars for one.It is very possible that we went on a bad day or that there was some really unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the groupon. The fact still remains though that the food was really pretty average and in some cases kind of fowl (one of the dishes on the mezze platter tasted old and spoiled). The only reason you should try this place is because you have a groupon, but just make sure they are willing to accept it that particular day. Otherwise if you want good Turkish or Mediterranean food stick with Turquoise or Jerusalem grill."], ["Carlos G.", "Wow! This place is as authentic as you can get in Central Texas. I'm from Austin and wish we had a place like this here. \u00a0I recently had lunch there with my son that goes to college in San Antonio.The restaurant is clean and the food is very flavorful and authentic. The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance reminds me of our travels to Greece and Turkey. To add to the authenticity, a Turkish TV station was on and Turkish businessmen were having lunch at the table next to us.My son ordered and we had the grilled lamb over eggplant dish. Excellent! \u00a0We also had lentil soup and a salad that were very good.

I had to ask 5 times before my husband went to the cooler and picked it up himself, all the while the waitstaff was sitting behind the counter and doing nothing. This is just unacceptable. It wasn't even busy, there were only 2 other tables beside ours. Why must I ask for the order 5 times, it wan't like they were making it from scratch, the desserts were all sitting in a cooler. I have no idea what the hell is wrong with their staff. Then, they overcharged me by $27, putting something we never ordered in the check. They said they corrected it, but ny bank statement is showing 2 charges, one for $68.12 (correct charge) and one for $86.01. So I got overcharged by $86.01. Their staff is totally incompenent. Again the food is great, you can order by phone and take out, just make sure nothing is missing form the order and you are not overcharged, but I strongly recommend against eating there, since the staff is totally incompetent."], ["P T.", "Yum!

It came on a bed of rice with a pickled cabbage side \u00a0and raw onions. I don't think I'd order it again to be honest.....I ordered a size of their version of tzatziki sauce and they brought a BOWL of it lol and it was really runny, not so much flavor...I prefer the thicker greek style I suppose.The flat bread basket with the Herb Oil is SO good. Aileen ordered babaganush...it was OK too...again Pasha's is waay better.Our other friend ordered the Chicken plate...it was really taste and the same sides as my dish. I wish I had ordered this one instead.The owner remembered that Aileen LOVES baklava so he brings her some...it was delicious. It was drippppping with runny honey. \u00a0so GOOD.I don't know if I would crave this place again but it's ok if I'm near by and my friends wanted to go there again. MAJOR FAIL of the night aside from what you will read after this little paragraph was that at the end of the night my friend wanted us to split the bill three ways but individualize the items because she only had an appetizer. Well the owner threw a little bitch fit and said NO....yea...he said NO and we each had to pay equal amounts..she wasn't so happy about that. It's not the money it's the principal of how you want stuff done if YOU are paying for the service. Right?So here is what had us cracking up at the restaurant.We are done with our meal and the place is empty it's just us three girls...We are always laughing and having a good time so I guess THAT was an invitation for the owner to come to our table and ask us if we like to party...LOL. I think he caught me shakin' it a little in my seat to some cool music he had on. He was SO excited to turn it up (liike night club loud) and we enjoyed a few songs.So we thought that would be it, OH no no no...he comes back to our table and we thought he was gonna kick us out because it was time to close down. WELL he asked us if we wanted him to turn his place into a night club and we can party there whenever we want. Then he goes on to ask if we want him to drive to the liquor store and stock up on wine for us or WHATEVER we wanted to drink. LOL Um....sweet buuuuut kinda creepy at the same time...ya know?He hands us his business card after we politely say no thanks and he's like \"Oh on the back is my other business...latex gloves distributor?? and he *smiles*O_O' \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OK girls it's time to GO hahahahahahahah This might not be so funny to you because you are just reading it buuut try to put yourself in our shoes.No little Turkish man you can't get us drunk and bring out your latex gloves!!"], ["Kashley R.", "Amazing little family owned mom and pop place.

Apart from the delicious classics, Tripoli's uses traditional flavors presented in modern, lunch friendly dishes. The Rice Bowls are my personal favorite.

My wife cleaned her bowl -a rare occurrence- and praised the flavors. The kids actually ate the whole 1X1' flat bread . My dish was very good as well . The service was hospitable and very quick. I also had a Persian tea that was OK, but not impressive. It all came out to $37 (not including tip). I would totally recommend this place. \u00a0(just for cred purposes...I've eaten in Tajikistan and Lebanon)."], ["Stephen K.", "Overall I really liked the food here. Wish they had naan like places in the Mideast do. Some of the food could use a little more flavor. The portion sizes were pretty good, and we had some leftovers. Liked the little pizza looking things. Look like fatair, but they call it something else. The kabob is good, but not the best. I'd recommend the place if you're in the area and want Mediterranean. Some of the prices are kind of high for what you get and the flavor.I'd go back, but it's not my favorite. One caveat, I've lived in the Middle East for quite awhile and love Middle Eastern food and might be a tough critic because I know how amazing it can be and should be. The staff was friendly and attentive."], ["Brett E.", "If you are on or near Lackland and you like Greek/mediterranean food, or if you haven't had it before, you must give Tripoli's a try. I have eaten tripoli's quite a few times now and it is never disappointing. I have tried the majority of Greek and Mediterranean restaurants all throughout San Antonio, and I find that tripoli's has their own unique flavor that brings me back. Each type of entree is available with whichever meat you like, different types of chicken or lamb. I always order the lamb gyro meat, and it has never let me down. It is flavorful, and if you get lucky, sometimes it comes out a bit crispy on the outside, and that adds to the flavor even more. Tripoli's offers calzones, which is pita bread, cheese, and your choice of meat, folded in half and and toasted nicely. They also have pita wraps, as you would expect from any Greek restaurant. They offer 4 or 5 different salads, including their own tasty Greek salad. They have a number of dips, including hummus. They have a number of sides to choose from, including falafel and sambusa. The sambusa is a perfectly lightly fried pastry filled with no lack of cheeses, which comes with a cup of tzatziki sauce to dip. These are also available with chicken. Now for what tripoli's is really known for, their rice bowls. These are a bed of rice followed by lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers, lots of crumbled feta cheese, and your choice of meat on top, drizzled with tzatziki sauce. These make for a perfect, very tasty lunch dish. Occasionally, when very busy, the one or two servers have a lot to do, and may take a moment to serve you, but I have never been disappointed by their friendly service. I also find their prices to be very reasonable, especially compared to some other locations in San Antonio. Also, I enjoy the very seemingly middle eastern decor and music. All in all, tripoli's is a very good choice for lunch or dinner for anyone who likes Greek food or wants to try something new and is my go to place when I can't decide what to eat. I have tried a number of their items and have truly never been disappointed. I would recommend tripoli's to anyone looking for a good lunch stop."], ["Robert V.", "Absolutely Delicious!

Today, about 8 months later, I have a whole new take on Tripoli's.I ate here with a couple of coworkers and it has improved greatly. After the first trip, I would have given then maybe 2 stars but today it's 4 stars.They offer a nice, albeit small buffet. The usual suspects are present. There are 2 different kinds of rice which were both nicely seasoned. The white rice had a real lemon or lime taste. Let's call it citrusy. The salad was prepared with diced tomatoes, some black olives, and feta cheese. Their dressing added a nice tang to it. One thing I didn't care for was the way they nearly shredded the lettuce. I like to stab my salad with a fork, not scoop it. There were numerous meats on tap and a sampling of fish. The boneless chicken chucks had nice crusty burnt bits that immediately informed you that these were properly grilled over fire. They also had another chicken that looked like a rib; dark in color, amazingly spiced, and absolutely moist with a hint of grease, these babies were the bomb. The fish, I assume to be tilapia, was more mildly seasoned, flaky, with a bit of butter and oil to set it off.In all, Tripoli's lunch buffet for $7.99 is definitely worth the price of admission. If you work on or near Lackland, you'd be wise to give Tripoli's a try."], ["Ellen C.", "Terrible service, terrible food. Last time meat was so tough that I couldn't cut it. Today the falafel tasted like thick paper. I was only eating there because it's popular with my co-workers. Next time it's suggested, I will beg off."], ["Vinny G.", "I tried a shwarma wrap and the lamb gyro, I loved the gyro ive never had one with grilled pepper was a good addition to it. But on the downside the shwarma wrap was a little dry and the peppers over powed the meat, I did get it to-go so I dont know if that was a factor. The tzatziki sauce was really creamy and flavorful. I like this place and plan on trying some of the other dishes on the menu."], ["Mike B.", "I've had the lunch buffet at Tripoli's twice now, and I've been impressed both times. It's not a particularly big buffet, but everything is attractively presented and--more importantly--delicious. The big standouts for me are the grilled meats: lovely boneless chicken in a savory marinade and big, juicy chunks of lamb shank. There's also a really nice zesty salad, which you know must be good if I'm mentioning it.The restaurant is divided in half by a wall of windows that separates the dining room to the left and the hookah lounge to the right. This partition does a great job of keeping the smoke out of the dining area. However, I could detect a fruity smell in the air, which I found pleasant.The guys who work at Tripoli's are very friendly and happy to explain the different foods--so the uninitiated need not feel intimidated. In addition to the buffet, they offer a full menu for dining in and to go.This place is right outside the gate of Lackland AFB, where I work. I like it enough that I'd be content eating there once a week. And I will be back, insha'Allah."], ["Zip M.", "Mediocre. The place was fairly empty and the one waitress was too busy.

We had two appetizers, hummus and the goat cheese pizza thing that were delicious! I ordered a chicken scwarma rice bowl and it was super tasty! I love this place!"], ["Stefany V.", "Considering the limited dining options in the Lackland area, this place was sorely needed. Add in the fact that it also has a hookah bar, and you have a semblance of a social gathering place. Ensure that there's walls, glass, and doors separating the two areas and you've pleased everyone to walk through your doors!I am so tired of going to hookah places that decide to serve food and make people who are just there for the food sit in the smoke-saturated area and hack up a lung! Super grateful that this place has done it right- the building is clearly new, freshly painted, and carefully decorated.That being said, I guess most people come here for the hookah, because it was dead empty at noon on a weekday despite an $8 buffet. I'd pass on the buffet in the future, because it was pretty limited and the food wasn't that good- giant pan of greek salad, bland lentil soup, spicy chicken and rice, spicy fish in the exact same sauce, bland fish without a sauce, and a pasta dish that was falling apart. The price was right for what you got, but I would have rather ordered from the menu.So we did- after lunch, we got take out for dinner. You know, to make sure this review was as thorough as possible. All in the name of research, I say!(Translation: our groupon was worth $30).The menu-food reminded me of the food you'll find at Sultans in the medical center- cheap and decent and tasty, but more of an American-Medi fusion than authentic. The gyro was decent, and the calzone with lamb and onions was good, too. They have a bomb garlic sauce. Even waiting until evening to reheat and eat these items, they were still clearly fresh and tasty, and they were priced well- about $7 for each, would make a decent lunch or good snacks while smoking hookah.I want to take a special moment to mention the NY Cheesecake. We ordered a slice for dessert and, for better or worse, it was the star of our lunch. The crust was lumpy and uneven, which gave it a homemade feel, and it had a layer of strawberry both on top and in the middle, and the back end didn't have that nasty clumpy feeling/taste to it like most store-bought cheesecakes do. This was one heavenly slice, that I totally didn't expect!

The menus are under glass on the table so it really takes away any guesswork or waiting for menus. I ordered the falafel appetizer, Greek salad and mixed chicken shwarma and gyro. My favorite was by far the falafel appetizer and would recommend to anyone. Four large patties, freshly made with what I'm guessing was tahini in the middle. Amazing.The Greek salad was plentiful with the feta cheese, tomatoes, onion and sadly black olives (the one thing preventing me from giving 5 stars). As stated on the menu it says it comes with kalamata olives, which I love. I was further a little saddened when my meal came out with another black olive in my hummus *sigh* that however was the only disappointment.The chicken shwarma was tasty but I really like the chunks of lamb.

Currently, half the seats have no cushions on them and there is only one small area to actually get comfortable. The service is intermittent. While the staff are polite, they seem to be overworked and rotate between multiple jobs in the yogurt shop, restaurant, and hookah area. The clientele are a mix of college kids who play computer games on the 2 wall mounted t.v's and military tech schoolers. The food is slightly overpriced for what you get. $5 for a shawarma... $8 if you want it in a combo with a handful of curly fries and a can of coke. The food's pretty good, but a little Americanized.
