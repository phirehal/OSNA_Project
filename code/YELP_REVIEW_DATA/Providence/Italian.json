When out-of-town guests request upscale Italian, this is my go-to venue. In addition to a very large menu, extensive wine list, impeccably dressed waiters (mostly men, of a certain generation, which further adds to the ambiance), Capriccio's restaurant decor and atmosphere is so on point! In short, enjoy the food but come for the EXPERIENCE. My out-of-towner foodie guests no doubt rave about everything after each visit so it's hard not to come back time and again for those special occasions."], ["Patrick W.", "Capriccio is a higher end Italian restaurant in downtown Providence. It provides a very nice atmosphere to have dinner. I ordered the Boeuf Wellington. It was actually the first time I ever ate a Boeuf Wellington. The entr\u00e9e was well cooked and I definitely enjoyed it as I devoured all of it. Of course, it is pricey. If you are just passing by Providence, I would definitely recommend the other restaurants instead. Nevertheless, Capriccio is a great choice if you want something that is higher end. I would definitely go there for a business related dinner.If you are passing by Providence and looking for recommendations, please see rookerville.com/2015/09/\u2026"], ["Jay G.", "I enjoyed another great night out at Capriccio's last evening.

I was sorely disappointed last time as you can clearly see from my last review. Yeesh, sorry I was a little harsh but hey I was let down. This time was a pleasure. Less is more but I spoke to someone on yelp who turned the whole situation around. He took a negative experience and made it a positive! I had the car valet parked and got the classic door opening and greeting then off to a nice table (not in the dark) and our server Larry was great. He was really friendly and funny. He gave us the regular menu and the restaurant menu (without judgment), then told us over 5 different appetizer and dinner specials, I have no idea how he remembered all that, I know I didn't...We all decided to not go with the restaurant week menu because there were so many other good choices. My mom and I ordered the salmon with apple cider-maple glaze, just enough sweetness, it came with polenta cake, (I traded those in for whipped potatoes.....amazing) and a side of asparagus with all the sharp crunchy parts removed, how nice...and really good. Gail tried the haddock which was served over a tomato and fish fumet, (which is a fancy word for broth), with spinach and caramelized onion goodness. Of course I had the vanilla cr\u00e8me brulee (my favorite dessert in the universe), which was served in a deeper bowl than I have had before and not all flat like they normally come, it is officially the best one I have had. Perfect. I was full but I still ate the whole thing. My mom tried the chocolate mousse, it was literally the most chocolaty thing I have had in a long, long time, awesome, I should have got that with a glass of port. :)Anyways, I thought it was only fair to rewrite my review because I finally gave this place a second chance and had the experience that I had originally hoped for. I am glad that yelp exists, it is a great outlet for expressing ones opinions about local places, getting info, and getting feedback. I write very few negative reviews and I am so glad that I can say Capriccios is not on that list."], ["Andrew W.", "This place is amazing! Huge thanks to Nick! You mad our night amazing with the excellent suggestions throughout the night! \u00a0Hands down one of the top restaurants in Providence!"], ["Allison D.", "It seems that providence had lots of expensive restaurants with good food, but not all of them have service that matches. We went for a celebratory dinner here on Friday night and not only was the food amazing, but our cocktails were perfect and the service was 5 star. The waiter takes care of you from the moment you sit down until you leave. They actually know the liquor the bar carries, they know the specials perfectly, the apps are brought to you at a perfect time so you're actually able to have time to eat them before your entr\u00e9e. It's really just a fantastic place all around and you don't mind spending the extra money when you feel it's well spent!"], ["Portia J.", "Im not going to lie. Before I walked in I thought this place was going to be a stuffy little tightly squeezed tight quartered establishment with stiff white linens but it is quite the opposite. I walked in with a friend of mines, we were 20minites early for our reservations (it was snowing outside and gross, so we decided to leave a little earlier) and was immediately greeted by a lovely host awho guided us to the bar so we could wait for our table. The bar was awesome. I think its my favorite thing about this place. It felt like a private den where you could smoke cigars and drink some cognac, in their plush cozy seats. The bartender was extremely nice. I chugged my Reisling and headed to my table.The lighting is intimate and cozy. The bread and butter was really good. I had trouble picking an entree and the maitre d was extremely helpful. I finally settled on the Zuppa Di Pesce. The broth/sauce was really good, the capellini was even better, grated parm was spot on. The seafood was a disaster. It was completely over cooked and rubbery. I wish it werent. The best dish on the table was certainly my boys dish. He got the duck cooked in Grand Marnier. It was absolutely the best thing ive ever bitten into in my entire life.I would certainly go back because the entire experience was awesome. But im coming for that duck."], ["Aimee Z.", "I loved the entire experience! The restaurant is so pretty! The service was the best! The food!!!! I am definitely going back!

The coat room attendant was a very sweet woman, very pretty and very well dressed! Even she was a delight!

Three of us had fettuccini Alfredo which they liked mainly because they prepare it table side. Though they left my mother's plate on the serving table after it was prepared and never served it to her (my boyfriend got up and grabbed the plate for her while the two of us waited 5 minutes for our plates as the others food got cold). \u00a0They brought a cake out to us but at that point we just wanted the bill. \u00a0Wish it was better but everyone of us was grumpy from the lack of service by the end of the night."], ["Dominic L.", "Great dinner as always, love this place.

You really can't go wrong with your choice. Just get here."], ["Sarah S.", "Capriccio is hailed as one of the best restaurants in Providence, and it certainly looks the part. The dining room is beautifully decorated, all the servers are in tuxedos, and the dishes (served on white linen-ed, candle-lit tables) cost a pretty penny. Sadly, for all its elegance and charm, the food simply does not go the distance. My party of 9 came for my brother's graduation meal on a bustling Saturday night. We were well-taken care of throughout, despite the server's nonchalance. Traditional Italian restaurants are not always known for their friendly servers, so that was no surprise. We ended up waiting awhile between courses, but that was to be expected as well (given that every out-of-town family in Providence was celebrating at the restaurant that night). My main disappointment was the food. I ordered the Beef Carpaccio and Oysters to start. The carpaccio was actually excellent, probably the best dish I tasted that night. The oysters were fine as well, and well-prepared, but nothing special. For my main course I ordered the Pappardelle with Duck Ragu and Pistachios \u00a0(because how amazing does THAT sound???). Duck ragu should be rich and flavorful, but the meat was dry and sadly, flavor-less. The pistachios added a nice crunch, but with the addition of burst tomatoes (which got soggy under the pasta) it turned what should have been an incredible dish into one that was profoundly mediocre. Everyone else seemed to have a similar experience: the fish dishes ordered were over-fried (killing the flavor), vegetables soggy, pasta overdressed. It could have been an off night for Capriccio, but reading some of the other reviews it seems my experience wasn't too far off the mark of the average meal. It's a beautiful restaurant and certainly an elegant ambiance for a special occasion, but I won't be rushing back."], ["Donna J.", "I have been here many times and service has always been great!

The waiter was nice enough to visit all sides of the table to list specials and answer questions without yelling and disturbing other guests. Every course came out at once, even the table side options were timed perfectly.

We hadn't been in a few years because the last few times it had been a so-so experience but this night made up for it for sure and we will be back. We started with some drinks at the bar. They have a really nice bar - just wish it were larger and they used to have entertainment but I don't think they do that any more. We were sat on time for our reservation. Service was very good. Food was good although they seemed to have switched the temps of my husbands and my meat where he got veal medium rare and I got steak well done. The waiter was quick to remedy the situation. And brought out all new sides as well. It was worth the wait. In addition we must have mentioned it was our bday and he brought out a small cake for the table and bought us a round of drinks for the inconvenience. Very classy Capriccios, thanks for the memories and we will surely be back."], ["Jessica D.", "My boyfriend and I had a great experience last night going out for my birthday. Everything was great from the dimmed lighting and look of the restaurant to the food and service we received. Initially we were going to just order off of the restaurant week pre fixe menu but after hearing the specials we thought otherwise. I had a blackened squid ink pasta with an tomato arabiata sauce with clams, mussels, bay scallops and squid. It was amazing the sauce wasn't as spicy as expected but all the flavors we're excellent. Although I think I may have liked my boyfriend's dish better which was lamb sliced into 3 tender pieces in a blueberry port wine sauce and mashed potatoes. Phenomenal. I definitely enjoyed the large variety of wine available to us as well. All the servers we're very pleasant and attentive to us, a very professional look to the service. To top of the night we both had martinis the Chocolate Cupcake and the White Chocolatini. So sweet and very well made. We had these alongside our desert which was crepes made tableside and flambe'd, it's a nice touch that you don't see at many restaurants. It is a pricey restaurant but everything is worth it, if you are going to go out somewhere special Cappriccios is a great choice."], ["Terry L.", "This is our 2nd time going here and will certainly not be our last. They offer free valet parking which makes it very easy and we love not having to worry about where we will park. You have to walk down stairs into the restaurant. The service is impeccable.

We loved the food....our friend got the shrimp Flambe which they make by your table and that was impressive. The gnochi is the best I've ever had and the sauce is by far the best I've tasted.

We arrived for our reservation on time and were seated in the corner which surprised me since the restaurant was mostly empty. \u00a0 Our waiter arrived as soon as we sat down and the first words out of his mouth were \"do you need me to take that away from you\". \u00a0This was addressed to my dining partner who had her phone in her hand but was not on the phone. \u00a0She was somewhat confused by his comment and then he followed with, \"you don't want to get my second reminder\" He then gave us menus and walked away. The tone of the evening was set. \u00a0My dining partner, a surgeon who had checked on a patient while we valet parked the car, was completely taken aback by the rudeness of our waiter. \u00a0She was not on her phone, there was no talking to disrupt the other diners, \u00a0she simply had the phone in her hand and was putting it away. The rest of the evening was no different. Our waiter rushed though the specials barely returned to the table to ask if we were enjoying our meal and forget about refilling our glasses with our $100+ bottle of wine. \u00a0The only enjoyable part of the evening was the food. It was delicious but in no way made up for the atmosphere our waiter created. \u00a0Our waiter was condescending, abrupt and his behavior was completely unacceptable.

The food was good not amazing but I'm more disappointed in the service part of it. I didn't expect to have such an un-attentive waiter. Observing the restaurant, every waiter just looked as though they were on point, enthusiastic about the menu and all about servicing their customers. We went early so we were probably the youngest couple in there at the time around 6:30ish. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose because we are young and they don't think we go out much but we got the newer waiter. He had trouble reciting the menu which is fine, I wasn't upset about that but he seemed to start to disappear from the middle of the dinner. The Burrata cheese appetizer was melt in your mouth good it came with a roasted pear and was just so delicious. My husband got the Beef Wellington which he loved and ate everything although the waiter forgot about his side dish. I got the Truffle Veal dish which I was happy with but not blown away. My side of pasta came as I was finishing my meal and by then I was all set. The worst part of it was he asked if we wanted dessert and I said yes so he hands me the menu and I'm pretty sure he is supposed come out with a tray of what they have or at least a description. Well he never came back. We waited 15 minutes and he was nowhere in sight so we asked another waited to find him and he said he'd be right over.Another 15 minutes later he finally comes over and we ask for the check, mind you no apologies for disappearing or what's worse not even mentioning anything about me wanting dessert! I did notice he coincidentally waited on the other 2 young couples in the restaurant which I think proves my point. It was just sad because it was MY first time eating there and I thought I was going to be wowed by service especially when all around me the waiters seemed so passionate about the food there.

Perhaps I got ahead of myself when I was picturing Pauly Walnuts and Chris-tu-fuh in a super-elegant Italian joint, but, well... I was. This IS Providence and this IS Capriccio, after all. I did see a few ladies in glittery dresses and ill-fitting soes, and I did see a few big guys with thick accents, and I did have my vino poured by a charming man from Sorrento, but did I feel the magic? Not so much. Our waiter was new, and seemed very nervous. There were a ton of specials in addition to the massive 50,000-page menu, which was slightly overwhelming. I decided to play it safe and go with the Black Angus strip steak. It was presented beautifully, but it was a tad over-cooked and tasted heavily of char. The accompanying mashed taters were scrumps, and the sauce was perfect. What I really loved about Capriccio was the building - really beautiful, charming and old city PVD. The restaurant is in the lower level, and the exposed brick floors have a thick glaze over them that ads such elegance. All of the waiters (no waitresses, please note) are dressed in sharp tuxedos and look as neat as a pin. They even come flambe certain items table-side, which is so old-school I can't even stand it.

You definitely need to dress it up. After a few drinks at the bar, our group was brought to a private room. The room was elegant and the waiters were fantastic with an eye for top service. Our group (20 of us) ordered one of every appetizer so I got to sample all of them. I especially liked the smoked salmon and mushrooms. For dinner, I went with the recommendation of our driver which was the Osso Bucco. It was fantastic and maybe the best piece of veal I have ever eaten. The wine list was extensive and all the one's I sampled were excellent. I was happy that I was not paying the check.I definitely recommend Capriccio for a fine dining experience.

It's one of the classier restaurants in Providence. The food is solid, but nothing spectacular, especially for the price. I'd much prefer spending a little more and getting something truly special in NYC. The horrible part about Capriccio is its consistently condescending service each and every time. Maybe it's because we're young, 20 year olds, who are not necessarily in a suit (but we do dress appropriate for the occasion). But it doesn't matter. No matter who walks into your restaurant is your customer, and each should be treated properly. \u00a0At the end of the evening, we are still paying as anyone else in the restaurant, and you're providing a service to me. If Robuchon in Paris, Caprice in Hong Kong, and Le Bernardin in NYC can provide personable and respectful service to us young college students, I'd expect Capriccio to as well. But no. On Valentine's Day last year, we made a reservation well in advance. When we got there, we were told that our table is not ready (which is fine, considering it's probably one of the busiest nights of the year), and for us to take a seat at the bar. Sure. That's until when I see multiple parties (of 2 as well) who walk in after us get seated immediately while I'm relegated to the bar with zero attention for AN HOUR. Not to mention, once we're seated after many complaints, our server seemed to think it's fine to ignore us as well. This week, thinking that last time was just a one-off thing, we decided to give Capriccio another shot given the Restaurant Week deal. We called in an hour ahead to ask if there's space for lunch, and they said yes and we left our name. Sounds to me like a reservation. When we showed up, the extremely rude maitre d promptly told us that he doesn't see our name and that there's nothing he could do about since they're full at the moment. Not a single apology, even after I started getting pissed off and telling him this is absolutely unprofessional. With that, I will never visit Capriccio again. Truly, who do you think you are?

Here goes.I haven't been to Capriccio's in a long time. We had a $100 gift certificate so decided to go this past Wednesday. It was nearly empty when we arrived at 6:30 (had booked through open table) and it remained dreadfully slow the whole evening.First the good news, the food! And really, that's what is all about. We ordered the special cheese app with some beets and prosciutto. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. I ordered the beef wellington and my girlfriend ordered the scallops and risotto. Both were delicious. The meat was cooked well and the wellington was accompanied with some flavorful potatoes. We ordered a nice bottle of Venetian wine and that was also fantastic. Too full for dessert.The ambiance of the place hasn't changed in years and is certainly not for everyone as it can seem a bit impersonal and stuffy. However, those things are non-issues for me. They still do some table side service, which can be a nice touch when going out for an expensive meal. One of the waiters cut my wellington into perfect portions.Our problem, was not with the service (per se) or the food. About 5 minutes after our wine was poured and before we ordered any food, the valet came to our table to inform us that our car had been hit in the parking lot. There was no major damage, but we were outside dealing with police and the other driver for 45 minutes or so. When we returned it was as if nothing happened, with our wine still on the table. I had informed our waiter of the situation before we had gone outside. Ok, so we eat and enjoy our dinner. Now recall, our car was hit in their lot after their valet parked my car. \u00a0I really anticipated a comp of some sort. Nothing major, a free app, free dessert. Anything more would have been appreciated, but unnecessary. Nothing. No mention of it. \u00a0We were totally put off by their lack of interest in our predicament. We never mentioned it again at dinner to our waiter. I guess being more vocal would have probably worked for us, but I would like to think that a situation like this would have garnered a little \"old fashioned\" customer service on their part."]], "Andino's": [["Marie H.", "Great place for a traditional Italian lunch! The restaurant is in a great location on Atwells Ave and nicely decorated inside. I stopped by for a late lunch and got the linguini and clams in white wine sauce - it was TONS of food for only $11. There were lots of clams, which were a bit chewy but otherwise good. Could have used some extra salt as well (had to add lots of salt and parmesan cheese). I also liked the bread and seasoned olive oil it came with. Would definitely come back to try out some of their dinner appetizers and entrees!"], ["Sungeeta A.", "I've been here twice (once for dinner and once for lunch), and I have to say this is a solid Italian restaurant. Great service, nice wine list, and decent Italian food. I think the strength of Andino's is their appetizers. The first time we got their appetizer sampler, where everything was tasty (and fried, which is probably why everything was tasty). \u00a0The second time we got the special, which was stuffed arancini - amazing. This was probably the best arancini I've ever had. Their entrees leave a little to be desired. I got their stuffed pork chop, which was really overpowered by garlic. \u00a0My bf got a veal chop, which was overcooked (he asked for medium rare). They were really nice and comped our dessert. Unfortunately, the chocolate cake we ordered was mediocre. \u00a0The service in Andino's really is excellent and you will have a good time here. However, in my opinion there are some better places on the hill."], ["Ryan K.", "Food: traditional Italian. Clams andino, clams casino, lobster ravioli with shrimp and pink sauce. The clams casino outshined their counterpart, but both were delicious. Served with a garlic butter sauce and lemon. They start you off with bread and garlic and oil. Heavy on the garlic which is fine by me. Tried the red sangria Sinatra. It was awesome and would def get it again.Service: as friendly as it gets. These people were on a first name basis with just about everyone...including me after about two minutes. I sat at the bar which has a full menu. Couldn't have asked for anything more here. They make you feel like family. The host was great too. Atmosphere: a little tight, a little loud, but I think that for this place, it just adds to the experience. Feels like a place all the locals love, but also welcomes the touristsSure...I'd go back."], ["A Z.", "Totally delicious, exactly what we were looking for when craving some Italian.

We had reso's for 8:00 but arrived early from CT (hour and a half drive, totally worth it!) and they were able to seat us immediately on the patio. Nice vibe out there on a warm autumn eve; I only wish they could do something to make the music more audible. They play a great selection of \"Rat Pack\" music that really adds to the atmosphere, but the roof exhaust fans from an adjacent establishment make the music a little hard to hear. Completely minor point.We started out with the polenta appetizer, which our waitperson, Kendra, suggested that we order with red sauce and melted cheese, yum! Very good with the seasonal sparkling strawberry Sangria. I ordered the swordfish Andino's special, grilled swordfish with roasted red peppers in a white wine sauce with pepperoni of all things--but it works; adds a nice salt and depth to the flavor of the dish. They also prepare this with chicken and possibly veal. The hubbie ordered the Chicken Saltimbucco, just as delish as the last time. Portions are truly huge, and the accommodating staff kept our doggie bags in the cooler for us while we took a stroll up the street to the Terrace and checked out the scene there, and stopped by the hookah place across the street.

Tucked along a string of Italian restaurants with their unique claims to fame, this establishment sets itself from the competition with their dedication to fresh ingredients, tried-and-true recipes that can only be found in the most obscure hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Southern Italy. I came here on an early Saturday afternoon, seeing a few empty tables, only to be told that without a reservation, we'd need to return at 10pm! At first, my initial reaction was one of shock and gall: the place is smaller than Kitchen, with an empty 2-seater table, why would I wait 5 hours to eat heavy Italian food at the dead of the night. Then, I noticed what people were eating: a ginormous ball of fresh mozzarella, artistically drizzled with balsamic vinegar and served over fresh tomatoes. The chefs were actively slicing thin slices of prosciutto and placing them beautifully over a honeyed fig on a fresh bread-piece. We were sold and did indeed return 5 hours after our early embarrassment. Upon revisitation, we noticed that there were only 4-5 tables, with jazz playing in the background. The overall ambiance was chic with class and a touch of homeyness. The staff were incredibly kind, knowledgeable and made our visit feel unique and welcomed. We tried the eggplant bruschetta, fig and prosciutto, large mozzarella salad and the homemade pasta with fresh pine nuts.Unfortunately, the one negative point was that the enclosed environment, with the loud background music made us feel so overwhelmed that we had to leave before our dishes were completed. The staff were very accommodating and the dishes looked amazing, even in tupperware.

To our surprise, they accepted our version of timeliness with a smile, and offered us the \"Sicilian Terrace\". I thought the owner, Umberto, was trying to convince us to take a bad table, but we accepted it anyways, and to our delight, it was just as enjoyable as he described. It was quiet, away from the foot and car traffic, and positioned in a romantic corner on the side of the building.The owner was upbeat and personable. He recommended we try 4 or 5 smaller plates, which was perfect for us. We enjoyed a great variety of meats and cheeses, a pasta and ceci dish, lasagne and a robust bruschetta with sliced meatballs. My wife enjoyed her meal with a Bellini, and I enjoyed a couple of glasses of Lacryma Christi for all the wrong reasons (\"3 Coins in a Fountain\"), but it was deliciously dry and perfect with the meal.We both would recommend this restaurant very highly, and see if you can get the Sicilian Terrace!"], ["Richard P.", "Not just a meal - an experience!We went to Enoteca Umberto based on the TripAdvisor reviews, and we're so glad that we did.

The restaurant is in the center of an Italian neighborhood full of restaurants - there were loads of tables out on the sidewalks and on a closed street - live and recorded music was playing, and the atmosphere was terrific.Enoteca Umberto specializes in authentic wines and cuisine of southern Italy (Sicily, Calabria, etc). Enoteca means wine bar - so it is not a typical restaurant menu. We started with the pomodoro salad - an assortment of sliced heirloom tomatoes drizzled with excellent olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt. There are four courses on the menu - the first is Freselle or Bruschetta - bread with toppings (like a flatbread, but different - and better). We had the caponata topping - best I've ever had. Then the Antipasti - we had the assorted cured meats and cheeses - also delicious. The main course is pasta - home made, we chose Ceci - which is garbanzo beans, olive oil, garlic, and lemon.The thing that really made this place stand out is Umberto himself - he waits on all of the tables (it's a small place - about 8 tables) and really makes you feel welcome. He sets the atmosphere - warm and gregarious, and makes sure everyone is enjoying themselves and appreciates the restaurant's unique approach.If you are in the area, and can get a table, go there.

The meatball (I forgot the official name of the dish) was sweet, savory and spicy--just a little kick to it-- with a creamy cheese on top...such a great dish.

It is a bit loud, as they have music playing and everyone tries to talk over the music and then the next thing you know you can barely hear yourself think. This may bother some people, but honestly we adapted.The owner seems keen on keeping up with emerging trends and technologies, as they even offer a free beer or glass of wine for Yelp Check Ins, which is not the reason we came here but was certainly a plus. Also, I believe she even visited our table and was extremely friendly to us and our daughter. They serve you bread with specialty local cheeses and olive oil from the owners grove in Greece. The olive oil was a hair salty but paired well with the fresh baked bread.The waitstaff was quite friendly, although I felt they seemed a bit rushed. The food also seemed to take longer than expected. But I will say, once the appetizer (we tried the fried dough) and meals we delivered, they were well worth the wait. The portions were very fair, especially the kids meal. Our meals were not too much that we had any to take home, but not too little where you did not feel full. Just right.

LolWe both loved the drinks there and wish I remember their names, they were the specials of the day, mango mojitos & watermelon with grey goose, both very good, however, the bartenders weren't using any measuring cups, the drinks weren't very consistent, some stronger some weaker! But in general we still love them!They had buffet bruschetta bar, and omg, all the bruschetta toppings were so delicious! Sun dried tomato sauce, blue cheese white sauce, white hummus, rabi etc... Everything tastes delicious! For entrees, we had jumbo shell pasta filled with cheese which was absolutely yummy, I'm not a big fan of cheese but this jumbo shell wasn't heavy at all!

Excited to see a place like this in Prov. Menu a plus too..not trying to hard yet interesting options and diverse...can get pastas, fish, steak, pork. Something for everyone but not overwhelming. Homemade and fresh. And why we won't go back...service and food that didn't live up. Busy Sat night, full restaurant, and we had reservations. Ended up sitting at bar as we sometimes prefer that and sadly the service was non existent. Bartenders barely acknowledged us, wouldn't make eye contact, took forever to finally ask \"what do you want?\", put a drink and food in front of us, and never came back. And when there was interaction it was as we were a bother. No excuse...service is everything. There for an hour with empty glasses for half of it and since no eye contact never got another drink. Even as we were leaving the bartender was walking towards us and no \"thanks..have a good night\" just a miserable look on his face avoiding us...umm thanks! Then the food...read great things about the not-your-typical calamari...should have been called Celery& Peppers salad, as it was flavorful it was about 1/8 calamari and 7/8 celery and peppers. Paid $10 for a chopped up piece of celery. Got the swordfish which was very good but a tiny piece and asked for salad instead of the carbs and my salad had to be sitting in a half cup of dressing and husband's pasta was more heavy cream then pasta. No dessert as there was never an offer just a check delivered. So disappointed Totally bummed as the vibe/decor and menu options makes me want to go back, and recommend to others, but not sure I want to waste another $100 to be treated poorly and leave feeling like I want to go eat somewhere else now.

I'll definitely be back!"], ["Gabriel O.", "Awhile back, I went out to dinner with my sister. We were in the mood for Italian, and Rosalina caught our interest. Neither of us had been before, and neither of us left disappointed. In fact, as if to prove that point, When I brought my girlfriend to Rosalina for her birthday last weekend, by sheer coincidence my sister had made a reservation with her significant other as well! What both of us learned from our first visit however, was to make reservations. Seriously, this place is what I think some people would call \"poppin.\" While Rosalina isn't exceedingly small, they are small enough, and they are popular. So call ahead. The menu can seem a little lengthy, but in that length there is variety. On my last visit my girlfriend and I split the Fried Dough Pizza appetizer. It was larger than I expected, but it was delicious. I would recommend it if you are looking for a quick lunch, or as something to split with your party. The entrees are well proportioned and equally delicious. I've had the Ravioli and the Gnocci. Both were great, the Gnocci comes out on a griddle with plenty of melted cheese. Personally I think think the Ravioli are a better dish. They are packed with flavorful cheeses and paired with a pair of fresh meatballs. Each table receives a basket of bread with cheese and olive oil, prior to every meal. The bread itself was a little too crusty in my experience but is still good. The olive oil is sourced from a greek garden of family affiliation. I'm not a fan of it unfortunately, but that's strictly my opinion. I am a huge fan of the spreadable cheese from Narraganset Creamery however. It's like the incarnate of fluffy, buttery, cheesy delight. The cocktails are refreshing and pretty creative. They have plenty of sweet fruity drinks, but also have a few whiskey based cocktails, which I always appreciate. On my last visit I had something that was pretty close to a bourbon sangria. (I can't presently recall the name.) I will probably try something else next time, but it was well worth the 9 dollars. The cocktails are also consistently priced I believe. Beyond their cocktail menu they also have a good wine and beer selection, and if you're checking in on Yelp you can take advantage of that!The decor is nice; I like Rosalina's branding, for one, but the seating is modern and comfortable, and the walls are adorned with large paintings, that don't call too much attention to themselves but are appealing to take in.

The huge (hard) roll just really compromises the entire sandwich. \u00a0Not enjoyable by any means.

The only thing I would suggest is that they educate all their cooks and waiters about dietary restrictions. I'm a stickler for attentiveness and even more so when I'm only ordering 2 things: fruit and \u00a0wheat bread with no butter. So don't mind me for being slightly annoyed that my bread had butter spread all over despite me telling my waitress 2-3 times (the first batch was toasted to perfection and the remake was not).

Friday early evening and Siena was packed, luckily our vendor was a frequent visitor - our wait was about 45 minutes. The interior is nicely furnished and a bit classy for my regular t-shirt-and-shorts, but in this instance I was lucky to be dressed slightly above that level in business casual due to the earlier meeting.The restaurant is low lit so please excuse my rather dark and grainy photos - a short stint at the bar while waiting allowed me to sip on a rather good Harpoon IPA - this ended up being my go-to beer while visiting Rhode Island.The service was particularly good with frequent stops due to the length of time to get the food to the table - it wasn't excessive once you adjust for the crowd and wait.Caprese Salad - this was atypical with arugula, tomato, fresh mozzarella cheese and crumbled cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegarArugula Salad - something a bit simpler than the caprese and very good.Scaloppine di Vitello Porcini - this very nice, classic veal scaloppine came finished with porcini mushroomsFilet Mignon Dinner Special - \u00a0This very nice filet was covered in a compote of veggies and served with haricots vert and a wedge of polenta - this is what I had and it was divine.Frutti di Mare - Shrimp, clams, scallops and fish sauteed in red clam sauce on linguine.

I went last night with my boyfriend and sister and it was HIGHLY disappointing the way we were treated. 1st my boyfriend called ahead asking about a dress code and the hostess said no, (I figured they're most likely lax because is was a Tuesday night). We get to the restaurant a little before our reservation to be told \"you can wait in the corridor until exactly 8:30\". That was not inviting & not professional. While waiting and talking amongst ourselves a hostess comes out to start cleaning the windows while we're standing there in the middle of service!! She walks into our convo and wishes us a good night?! Too many strange things and we haven't even sat down yet. Finally we have a seat and order a bottle of wine and a few appetizers. The wine was recommended by our waiter but unfortunately was either oxidized and/or corked because the taste was completely off. We send it back to try another and she comes back to say \"I can't just send this bottle back if you don't like it.\" Awesome. Noted. However it was your poor recommendation not our taste buds! Within a few minutes the waitress must have complained because the manager walks up with a vengeance telling my boyfriend he's going to be asked to leave if he doesn't remove his hat. The timing of this all was way too convenient. Not to mention she was speaking so loudly as to try to make a scene!! The manner in which he was asked was completely disrespectful, out of line and NOT professional. This waitress and manager clearly had something against us before we even sat down but we ignored most of the signs while enjoying each other's company. The last straw was her attempting to treat us as though we've never been to a fine dining restaurant before. I told her we called ahead about dress code and since no one mentioned upon arrival why is it such a huge deal when we're half way through our meal?! And let's be honest I have no problem following the rules but we all know delivery is everything. And that manager is wretched I will never be going there again. I will never recommend this place.

If it's a holiday you are looking to come on, I highly recommend calling at least 2 weeks in advance for a reservation.

As all you Rhode Islanders may already know, we are known for our Italian food. Most are tucked away in the Federal Hill/Atwells Ave area with a few sprinkled throughout the city and beyond. Siena is situated in what I call the heart of Federal Hill which is apt as it should be the beating organ of this Italian district. In a somewhat innocuous outward appearance, Siena sits casually to the side on one of the busiest streets in Providence. Don't be fooled by the lack of cars up front. They have a valet service so it makes it seem they are never busy when in fact, they are probably one of the busiest places around. Tip 1: ALWAYS book a reservation. Just do it online and get your name on the board or you'll never get a spot! We walked right in without having to wait where as others who just showed up had to wait hours.Tip 2: You must get the meatball appetizer. Look, it's a pound of meat.. what's not to like? Share it though..Tip 3: Vodka penne will blow your mind. That is, if you like Vodka sauce. Between this and the meatball it was more than enough for two people. Remember not to forget dessert!I did try the pizza.... I wasn't too thrilled with my choice (I can't even remember the type that I got. But I do remember telling myself that I should really try the vodka sauce pizza the next time!They have a great bar area and really surprisingly limited seating within the building.

Only sad part of dinner last Friday night was the missing portabello mushroom appetizer that was a favorite for me and my family. Change is sometimes never good."], ["Jenny C.", "Be prepared for a Debby Downer type review, smashing stereotypes left and right. Sorry!Everyone always recommends Siena as the greatest Italian place on Federal Hill, so when my dad came to visit RI, I wanted to take him there (he loves Italian) and try it out for myself. WELL, after all of that building up I'd done, as soon as I walked in and saw the velvet thrones in the back, I realized I'd eaten there before. It all came rushing back as a memory of mediocre food. Actually, that isn't a fair assessment. I remember the bolognese was a disappointment--I'd been on a quest to find the best in Providence, and it wasn't at Siena's--but the rest of the food might have been okay. The point is I don't remember, and for me, that's a bad sign.Here's my assessment from this time around. 1. Reservations are needed way in advance for the weekend if you'd like to eat before 9pm2. It's LOUD. Tables are tight and I had to yell across the table for my dad to hear me.3. The waitress (or at least ours) will be visibly disappointed if you don't go all out: bottle of wine, apps, dessert, etc.4. The food is okay. The gnocchi sounded amazing (black truffle oil!), but I wasn't a huge fan. The vodka pizza, however, had great flavor, and I imagine their penne vodka would be good.For now, I'll keep experimenting around Federal Hill. I'm not ready to agree that this is the best there is..."], ["Xiao Z.", "Really great American-Italian cuisine here, with attentive service and formal ambiance.

The complimentary bread is not bad at all. I was starving, though, so I may be a tad biased. Their wine selection is substantial--we picked up a great Chilean red to accompany our meal. I ordered the rigatoni as my entree. It was a hearty, wholesome pasta meal with a generous amount of ground sausage and tomato-white wine sauce.

Unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me. I started my meal off with the meatball appetizer. Its a meatball, topped with a dollop of ricotta, over some marinara/tomato sauce. The meatball was the size of a baseball. Maybe a softball. It was just too much. It actually would have been sufficient for an entree. I think they should have decreased the size of the meatball, or broke it down into 3-4 meatballs. I can't emphasize how massive this meatball was. For my entree, I ordered the bolognese (not knowing how big the meatball entree was). The entree was appropriately sized, and maybe my appetizer ruined it for me, but it was just too much meat, and not enough sauce. And it was a little too oily/greasy for my taste. Dessert was the redeemer for me: pumpkin spongecake with cinnamon ice cream and a caramel drizzle. Tasty, and a good size. Service was okay. Our waiter never came around to ask us how our meals came out, and seemed kind of indifferent to our dining experience. Perhaps in the future, I'll come here again and try something else.

The salad was an antipasto, it was your standard salad with meats and cheese on top, but bonus points for the crazy amount of banana peppers on the salad. The pizza was pink vodka sauce with olives, peppers, spinach, and a ridiculous amount of delicious feta!! They do not skimp on the toppings here!

We went for lunch on a Sunday and sat outside on a gorgeous day. They had some good local brews by Harpoon so I stuck with the UFO. When in Rome??? The pizza menu itself is tough to get through because everything looks so damn good! We finally decided to go with Half Great White w/ clams (menu says optional for the clams, but if you don't do it, you are a fool!) and half 4 cheese with vodka sauce. \u00a0By the way the service here is fantastic. Never did my beer go empty without an offer of a new beer! The pizza did not take very long to come out and when it arrived the smell of goodness punches you in the face. I started with the clam pizza...I am glad I did. \u00a0This pizza did not lack flavor OR clams for that matter. It was delicious. Then I moved to the four cheese and vodka sauce. This pizza was next level ish. As I went tearing through this pizza, I forgot my name it was so good. \u00a0It was a religious experience! \u00a0I heard the voice of angels singing!! Oh, wait a minute, we were sitting next to a church that had a service going on, that was ironic and perfectly timed as well. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, that vodka sauce on the pizza was brilliant. Overall this was definitely the best pizza I have ever had. The crust was thin and delicious and all the toppings worked well together. My buddy and I definitely ate the whole thing; there were no leftovers on this trip. But then something happened, we were asked if we wanted to try the desert pizza. Desert pizza? We summoned from the depths of our stomach, room for desert. We willed this to happen. \u00a0We replied,\"Well, sure. Why not?\" We went with the mango desert pizza, the small. One piece of advice, the small isn't very small. \u00a0The amount of fruit on this pizza is ridiculous. Fresh kiwi, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and mango with a cream cheese sauce underneath. \u00a0It was delicious. We pushed through and devoured the small pie. \u00a0I was now food drunk.Overall this place is fantastic. I highly recommend coming to this place and eating here.

Fair warning, though, if you're looking for ooey-gooey, piping hot and bubbly cheese you will not find it here. This pizza is thin, crispy yet chewy, and saucy with obvious attention to topping proportions. In other words, it's well covered in toppings but won't fall apart at your first bite. You can taste everything, and everything tastes good.I highly recommend the Lasagna pizza. Try the Mesclun Green salad if you want a taste of the best balsamic vinaigrette of your life. Add the goat cheese, too. It's worth the extra couple bucks.Ambiance is a little off. Service is inconsistent, and the dining area is usually messy (crumbs on the floor, dingy windows).

Ceasar, arugula, apple, candied bacon walnut...I can't remember all we had, but everyone enjoyed their salads.The entrees are a bit much to remember: steak, fish, pasta, chicken--it ran the gamut. \u00a0I think the only person who didn't enjoy their meal was me. : (. I had the rib eye and it just wasn't flavorful. \u00a0No one should have to salt down a perfectly rared piece of beef. \u00a0Oh well, I left it on my plate, sated with the first two courses. \u00a0Seems like everyone else enjoyed their meals. \u00a0They came out looking like works of art. \u00a0Wish I could have had dessert.The lounge opens at night with a live band. \u00a0Nice atmosphere.Overall, glad to have done what was named a \"Providence institution.\""], ["Melissa P.", "If you want real deal Italian food, come here. Their calamari alone is worth the trip, as is their shrimp wrapped in prosciutto (scampi alla satiago). Staples like chicken parm are done to perfection and portions are large. Prices are very reasonable for the quality. Service was outstanding."], ["Dennis B.", "We were in town on business so I asked my customer where should we go.......he suggested this restaurant.....we sat at the bar for lunch.....this place from when you walked in and met the maitre d........I knew this was a excellent restaurant......the bar staff was excellent. .....the food was fabulous.....great experience was had......I will be back."], ["Lauren L.", "An excellent evening start to finish. \u00a0We had a family friend come in for the weekend who wanted \"old school Italian.\" \u00a0Since Camille's was founded in 1914 with excellent Yelp reviews, this was an easy choice.We honestly got the best service we have EVER gotten at a Providence restaurant. \u00a0The Maitre'd (Michael) was incredibly polite on the phone when I called to say we'd be 10 minutes late for our reservation. \u00a0The staff (Andrew was our incredibly nice waiter) was quick to greet us, grab our coats, and the Maitre'd himself took us to our table. \u00a0The ambiance was very classy- lots of dark colors, prints, heavy decorations. \u00a0You would be wise to dress a little nicer than jeans- several ladies there were in dresses and many of the men had blazers on. \u00a0The menu does encompass a wide variety of palates. \u00a0We spent a long time debating our options. \u00a0In the end, our friend got the veal, I got the baked scallops with crab, and my husband got the classic orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. \u00a0As we shared the entrees we could all agree that these were GREAT. \u00a0The veal was amazingly tender and flavorful. \u00a0My scallops were perfectly cooked, sweet, and the seasoning was a bit heavy but very VERY good. \u00a0My husband's pasta was incredibly fresh and well cooked. \u00a0We split the calamari (very good) and burrata (very fresh, a little underseasoned by my palate, but overall still very good). \u00a0 The wine list was extensive- there were many options that hit most palates and budgets. \u00a0For dessert we shared the tiramisu. \u00a0The mascarpone was nice, a little on the thick side, but still delicate and tasty. \u00a0Overall, this was one of the nicest evenings we've had in a while. \u00a0It is a perfect place for a special Federal Hill evening."], ["Alexandra L.", "I have never been so pleased with a meal as I was tonight. Camille's delivered the most well timed and coordinated service I've \u00a0seen in an establishment. We indulged in calamari for our appetizer. (perfectly cooked; tender and lightly breaded.) Alan, our waiter suggested a white Italian wine from B Lange that accented our seafood dishes magnificently. After informing us of the specials, Alan suggested a rare tuna steak crusted with sesame and almonds. Along side was a wonderful coconut lime rizzoto topped off with \"fried\" shrimp that left us speechless. My boyfriend ordered a frutti de mare over a linguini with a spiced red sauce specially made by the chef. All of the shellfish was cooked to perfection and the scallops cut like butter. For dessert, we were again suggested a plate to share. Deconstructed cheesecake. The fresh raspberry pur\u00e9e complimented the cream cheese and light crumb perfectly. I would recommend Camille's to anyone planning for a special occasion or looking for an amazing dining experience."], ["Chulo K.", "Old school great start to an evening in Providence Rhode Island. Service at the bar top notch. Appetizers even better. It's a don't miss."]], "Costantino's Venda Bar & Ristorante": [], "Cassarino's Restaurant": [["A P.", "We were having a business dinner for 12 and were seated upstairs. \u00a0Comfortable table and friendly staff. \u00a0The wine selection was good. \u00a0The Stag's Leap Cabernet was a great choice for the veal Parmesan. \u00a0The lobster ravioli was delicious for the first two raviolis then the saltiness was quite noticeable. \u00a0The waiters were attentive and timely with everything from our drinks to appetizers to coffee. Bread seemed stale. \u00a0Our dinner was at 7 PM.The portobello salad with roasted vegetables was delicious though too heavy on the dressing. \u00a0Same for my colleague's Caesar salad.Shrimp scampi was good. \u00a0Shrimp a bit overcooked though. \u00a0Large portions so you definitely won't leave hungry!Coffee and cappuccinos are ok. \u00a0If you can, try to have coffee elsewhere. In case you're wondering, yes, I sampled food from other's plates for this review."], ["Amanda B.", "This place was a first for us the other night and wasn't super impressive sadly. We got there a little late but the kitchen rushing us to order by 930 so they could close was a little crazy. Drinks were good, once we ordered the food came out quickly which was nice but it was a rushed time overall. Someone had ordered seafood as we were leaving and the smell was terrible. Seafood shouldn't ever smell that bad, I was really glad we weren't eating it but sad it made us rush to finish our drinks and get outside! Our server was nice but for 9-930 on a Saturday night I expected a little more of a crowd. Overall, certainly not the best but not the worst either."], ["Fadi B.", "I don't see any reason not to give this place 5 stars. The service was great and attentive. The food came in a timely manner, and the waiter was more than happy to give us what we wanted. Food was excellent, and so was the complimentary bread. Prices were also great, but then again I'm not exactly a great reference coming from NYC. The most expensive thing on their menu was $21, which is about average for an NYC restaurant.Also, I know from living close by for a few years that parking isn't very easy in the Federal Hill area, but their valet service was pretty efficient."], ["Richie S.", "For a first time experience I have to say that this place certainly exceeded my expectations. My wife and I came with our friends last Saturday night for dinner and were pleased that we got seated right away when we showed up for our 7:15 reservation. Right away our sever came over to take our drink order and to make some suggestions based on the specials available. We started with drinks and soon followed with some Italian wedding soup which was amazing. My wife got the saltembucca and her girlfriend got the Marsala and her boyfriend got the lobster ravioli. I on the other hand took advantage of the veal rib chop special which was absolutely amazing, so juicy and tender plus the broccoli rabe that came with it was some of the best I've ever had. We are really looking forward to plan a trip back here again soon. Hope you enjoy!"], ["Tom O.", "Food was very good, service not so good. \u00a0We were told by our waiter to order our apps and entrees at the same time. Never heard of this anywhere before. Got our apps and they were excellent. We asked for more bread to soak up the juices of the clams zuppa. We asked again 5-7 minutes later and our waiter said the bread was still in the oven. \u00a0He said this as the bus girl was delivering 2 baskets of bread elsewhere. \u00a0Then on a redrink order, he forgot one of the drinks and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get it. Overall a delicious dining experience, but the service left a lot to be desired."], ["Michael R.", "Excellent food. I highly recommend the Brucetta appetizer. My steak with a Gorgonzola crust was cooked to perfection. The only downside was we had to eat on the third floor. Other than that I would highly recommend this restaurant for a good meal."], ["John V.", "Dined here on Saturday 11/14. My date and I arrived a little early but were promptly seated at a cozy table for2 right near the bar. Our server was Michael and he was assisted by a young man who's name I'm sorry to say escapes me. Both were very polite,professional and attentive throughout our stay! The young man soon arrived with the best Italian bread I've ever had in a restaurant! We ended up asking for seconds and thirds!My date and I started with an antipasto and fried ravioli. The antipasto was absolutely outstanding, ravioli just okay! We then shared a chicken casserino which was very good and a huge portion! An overall very satisfying meal! I will definitely return and recommend Casserino's to all!"], ["Shawn T.", "Came here last summer and remembered a decent meal. \u00a0It was not so good this time around. \u00a0I opted for the special pasta dish with braised beef ribs and thought it was way too salty. \u00a0The toasted ravioli appetizer was below average. Service was spotty."], ["Bruce K.", "The food was good but the kitchen was very baked up all it took a while to get our food. \u00a0We had reservations and were seated as soon as we walked in by a friendly hostess. \u00a0Nearly every table was occupied so the ambient noise a tad loud for casual conversation. \u00a0The music was also a touch loud at first. \u00a0We asked if they could turn it down and they promptly did.I had the Pollo Millano. \u00a0Everything was cooked very well and the flavor was incredible. \u00a0My wife had the Cassalinga with veal. \u00a0She liked it as much as I liked mine. \u00a0Our son had the pesto ravioli. \u00a0 About the only thing left on his plate were some of the olives and some tomatoes. \u00a0We all agreed that the portions were more than enough to fill up anyone.To finish the meal we shared an order of tiramisu. \u00a0We all agreed that it was probably the best we have ever had. \u00a0That's saying something given we recently traveled across Italy and had it everywhere we went.The family decided that we should add Cassarino to our short list of restaurants to always try when in town."], ["Aimee Z.", "Cassarinos was pretty good. We really enjoyed the squash flowers that were on special that day. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great. As for our entrees we were a little disappointed. My husband ordered a pork chop that was recommended: he thought it would be a thick on the bone chop however it was thin and fried and the edges especially were hard and too crunchy/crispy. He had asked for it medium so there was a lack of communication there. Also my entree was a chicken dish with ricotta cheese, spinach, mushrooms & red sauce. My chicken also had the hard edges, the dish was pretty good but nothing I would order again. I'm glad we went to try it out! We had a nice bottle of wine. And I enjoyed the time with my husband."], ["Stephanie C.", "Unfortunately, my husband and I were not impressed. We enjoyed the atmosphere when we walked in and expected a table in the main dining room but that was not the case. They sat us on the third floor in a corner that was dark and away from everything which I didn't like. But I'm not a complainer so I just sucked it up. First off, it took literally 20 minutes before someone came to our table. Being a server myself, this is where I started to judge things, unfortunately. If we hadn't already gotten our drinks from the bar we wouldn't have had any for at least a half hour. We got the clams casino for an appetizer and they were delicious. But our server pretty much never came back so we had to ask someone else for water and bread. My seafood pasta dish was excellent but my husbands breaded, deep fried veal was disgusting. He gave me a taste and I was good with tasting it again. I didn't like it at all. Overall, we looked forward to a date night all week away from our 1.5 year old, got dressed up and was very disappointed. It felt like I was sitting in my grandma's kitchen. And she probably would have been a better waiter"], ["Neil M.", "We were taking out my dearest and oldest friends in honor of their 50th anniversary. \u00a0They were intending to use gift cards for this restaurant (thus the choice to go there) however we insisted on treating. \u00a0We had 6 pm reservations and were seated, downstairs, promptly by a pleasant hostess. \u00a0Our server was Michael who greeted us friendly enough until we ordered non alcoholic drinks (none of us drink alcohol). \u00a0There was then a perceivable change in attitude. \u00a0There was a distinct disinterest in us; interactions lacked the usual social pleasantries that we, at least, are accustomed to when dining in what are supposedly fine establishments. \u00a0(I have dined in many excellent Federal Hill restaurants and servers were always most pleasant and fun). \u00a0We understand that good food takes time to prepare and we were in no rush, however, we were very hungry. \u00a0We were served delicious bread, but only four slices for four people so it evaporated quickly. \u00a0Our server was slow in returning, doing so, it seemed, only when seating new customers nearby. \u00a0When we did finally catch his eye (he never did approach to ask if we needed anything such as a refill on our soft drinks, although the water server was always around refilling glasses), we requested a refill of the bread basket. \u00a0This took, no exaggeration, a good ten minutes I think he forgot about us and I had to remind him; called to him, actually, as he inattentively trotted by us.The food was delivered and there are no complaints about the food; it was very good.When finished, we were offered dessert menus, which we declined, but requested two expressos (these, sadly, were terrible- no foam at all). \u00a0Michael returned and literally dropped the sugar container on the table then slid it across at us, which we thought very unprofessional, even rude.Although we enjoyed the food and each others' company, the pour service and attitude did put a damper on our enjoyment thus we are hard pressed to recommend this establishment to friends and others. \u00a0It is sad to think that our experience might have been tainted because we do not imbibe, or, perhaps, it was just this one server."], ["David F.", "I dined at this restaurant with my girlfriend and were greeted promptly by a male server who told me about the specials for the night. I decided to go with the sangria list since it was so extensive. I had the VIP sangria and I really enjoyed it. I believe it was prosecco, sprite, fresh fruit, and brandy? We had the squash flower app special which was exceptional followed by a veal cassalinga and a chicken francaise. We were satisfied with the price, food, and the service and we will definitely return to Cassarinos."], ["Bill K.", "Got to be my go to place for traditional Italian foodAlmost too many choices for this guy who lives Italian foodBread is as good an fresh as it getsOur waiter suggested a wine that was very goodI had the pork which the waiter suggested , it was outstandingWaiter was very good"], ["Ashley A.", "After much debate about which ONE place to try on Federal Hill for Italian, our client finally just told us to try Cassarino's. We booked a table for 7pm on OpenTable and were seated right away. Our favorite person was the server who brought the water - he was super nice the whole time our waitress was great as well - out on a limb, I think her name was Stacey. I'm 100% guessing. We ordered the Clams Casino which were almost like bacon wrapped stuffed crab...but clams. My coworker got the Southern Mule to drink which he said was real good and different. For dinner I ordered the Lobster ravioli and coworker got the Bracciola which he butchered trying to pronounce - but he's from Alabama so cut him some slack. The portions were huge so come hungry...and don't spoil your dinner eating all the bread and butter (like me). Since this was one of our last travel weeks for the year, we went halfsies on a turtle cheesecake and lava cake - a small bite of each on the spoon plus some ice cream is the perfect bite! Overall we left happy and stuffed but enjoyed the experience!"], ["Michael C.", "Probably our favorite spot on the hill.
