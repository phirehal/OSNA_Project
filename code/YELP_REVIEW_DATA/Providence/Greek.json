They felt devoid of spice or any special kind of flavor. Maybe a spice infusion is necessary? Also, the complementary fillings like lettuce and white sauce left a little to be desired.

So flavorful, so comforting- perfect appetizer during fall and winter.The only thing that has disappointed me so far is the house cocktail- I'm a big fan of St. Germain, and I ordered the drink for the reason that St. Germain was a prominent ingredient in the description.

The location is a perfect spot, and the price range was very reasonable for being in a prime location and on Thayer street, where the restaurant scene is just huge.

Sometimes the places that have the tastiest food know that they're hot stuff and don't feel the need to bend over backwards service-wise. Similarly, there are some family owned joints where the staff is just too cute for words, but you worry for them because sadly their food just isn't that great. Livi's is a perfect example of a restaurant that's simultaneously bodacious and charming. Tucked away at one end of the Arcade in downtown Providence, it's the absolute perfect spot for a quick lunch while working or shopping in the area. I ordered the Livi's Pocket, as my theory is that you usually can't go wrong with a place's signature item. I wasn't disappointed: the eggplant, high quality fresh mozzarella, and red peppers all melded together perfectly in my tasty wrap. At the end of our meal the nice lady behind the counter offered us a free sample of their baklava. That's probably the smartest business move they could make because that stuff is so tasty there's no way you won't buy some to go or on your next visit after experiencing it.

You can try and re-wrap it yourself but it's tough when your hungry and aggravated. \u00a0Also the diy wraps are lame, we ordered one with 3 ingredients due to dietary restrictions and there was hardly anything in it.

He was awesome and friendly when he finally emerged from the back, asking our orders so that they could be placed on the grill and and got to assembling the other items for our wraps. The boy in front of me got chicken bacon, with tziki and lettuce and tomato and they were happy to oblige. I went with The Works wrap, which is their vegetarian falafel wrap. I debated asking for pickles and banana peppers....but didn't want to turn this into a clone of the wrap I get from East Side pockets...at least not on my first time. My wrap did have to endure my walk back to federal hill, but it was still pleasantly warm when I dug in. Their falafel, oh my. Theirs is probably my favorite around hands down. I'm not sure why, but it was lacking any bitter or sharp tastes that I've encountered elsewhere and while a bit crumbly was not grain/gross in the mouth.

Livi's, you are so completely and totally 5-stars of delicious, fresh, wonderful, hospitable, friendly goodness that I want to shout it from the rooftops. Simply put, I LOVE LIVI'S!!!Now that they've been open for nearly a year and now that I've been there several times, I have my order down, my timing down and my actual eating down. I am partial to the Falafel Pocket with a few added extras (no charge! Get the tzatziki!!!) and I like to go post-lunch rush so I can chat with the wonderful staff and then have a seat in their little dining area so I can eat it while it's nice and fresh. The ingredients are key. While chatting with one of the owners, George, I learned that since they don't have a ton of storage or refrigeration, everything is prepared fresh that morning -- nothing sits overnight or for days or even weeks. It's all fresh and it certainly taste that way. Also, prior to owning and operating Livi's, this family made pita bread that has been used at the most popular Middle Eastern eating establishments in the area. Interesting, huh? So they certainly know what they're doing and how to do it, which results in stellar food. They've also gotten their portion sizes right. The first time I had a Livi's pocket, it was enormous and I felt like I wasted what could have fed a Third World Country. Now, their very manageable and just the right size for a hungry gal who wants something healthy and relatively quickly. The staff is incredibly friendly, warm and helpful, the space is clean and charming, and the food is wonderful. Like I said, I love Livi's. You will, too."], ["Richard P.", "Livi's Pockets and Livi's Gourmet is a must try if you are in downtown Providence. Not only are they both located in the Arcade, America's oldest indoor shopping mall, but the food is fantastic! The owners and workers are always so friendly and will go out of their way to make your experience the best it can be. I live in downtown Providence and probably go to Livi's Pockets at least once a week. I always get the chicken and falafel. The ingredients are super fresh, and the falafel is out of this world.

I ordered the combo pocket with two meats, which turned out to be only $8 bucks and was HUGE. The chicken breast was good, yes, but the falafel was mindblowing. It had the perfect crunch on the outside and the smoothest texture on the inside. Because East Side Pockets makes its falafel in the shape of a donut, the crunch to interior ratio is perfect. Also, do yourself a favor and get the pocket instead of the salad. There's something inherently satisfying about the way the wrap comes together with all flavors of the classic Greek spreads (tzatiki, hot sauce, and tahini) and the crunch of select vegetables (pickles, lettuce, tomato). Plus, the falafel, while fried, doesn't taste oily at all and the deliciousness makes it entirely worth it. If you really want a \"healthier\" option, choose the whole wheat wrap.

We got in line which moved at a moderate pace. \u00a0Each order is partially assembled in front of you as you place your order, then any grilled items are placed on top as you pay and either stand or sit to wait. \u00a0Seating is self serve. \u00a0It took less than 10 minutes for our two pockets to be ready. \u00a0Hubby and I ordered the grilled chicken kabob pocket with lettuce, tomato, onion, tziki (sp?) sauce, hummus (no pickles, hot peppers or yogurt sauce) in a bread pocket which appeared to be a pita. \u00a0The chicken was tender and flavorful, condiments fresh; however, the bread was a bit disappointing ... not as soft as we would have preferred. \u00a0Overall, a good experience and if in the area again, we would return and try a different pocket. \u00a0Very reasonably priced, service was also very good."], ["Allison M.", "I challenge you to find a better pocket on this side of town, or anywhere else in the Providence area, frankly. ESP is a long-standing neighborhood favorite, and I cannot imagine Thayer Street without it. Everything I've ever had has tasted fresh and authentic. The staff is tremendously kind and accommodating, and seem genuinely happy to be there. Sometimes they give me a complimentary piece of baklava, too! So nice.At lunchtime it's insanely busy with lines that easily trail out the door. I've discovered that just before noon is the perfect time to get in line, as the grill is screaming hot with delicious meats and they are ready to get customers in and out of there to make room for the lunch rush.This is a grab-extra-napkins kind of eatery. The wraps are enormous and deliciously messy. Roll up your sleeves, tie back your hair and get into it."], ["Natasha D.", "Visiting Providence for the extended weekend I found myself nearby and hungry, I checked Yelp for some guidance on some cheap good eats, and it delivered. I got the Middle Eastern Platter for $8 and the price did not dictate the quality. It was really good. I especially liked the falafel, amusingly shaped like donuts.Not only is it inexpensive and tasty but they have great service. They run like a machine. Everything is so organized and quick it's actually pretty impressive. Their stations are flawless; while one guy is taking your order another guy will clean the debris from the last order if there's anything out of place. While I sat and ate my food I noticed that as soon as a group sitting at a booth left, someone came out to wipe down the table. I absolutely love that kind of attention to detail. If that much care is put towards keeping these ostensibly low-key things clean and tidy then I feel at ease with how they conduct their practices where I can't see what's going on. This isn't a Michelin star restaurant, an interior decorator didn't spend months delivering a top-notch unique dining experience, but East Side Pockets works with what they've got and they are the best at it. Would definitely recommend."], ["Shweta R.", "Amazing taste of falafel and hummus. I ordered the platter. I was craving hummus and this place just made it right. Loved the food"], ["Chanceny K.", "order a combo chicken falafel wrap. Yea... you're welcome!! its amazing. parking is tricky but I don't mind the walk."], ["Myron C.", "Eastside Pockets is hands down the best Mediterranean food in Providence and perhaps the whole US. The wraps here are big, delicious, and reasonably priced. They always keep the food fresh and hot and that's what makes them one of the best. The seasonings in their falafel are the bomb diggity, The Chicken is also seasoned well and grilled to perfection. My typical go to is a chicken and falafel wrap. The sauces they mix together are just fantastic! This is where East Side really hits the mark and puts themselves ahead of the competition. A lot of Mediterranean places have good spices and fresh food, but it can become dry when put into a wrap without the proper sauce. Other places might have a sauce, but it just doesn't add anything to the flavor. East Side Pockets does not have either of these problems. The sauces they use are delicious and balance out a great blend of veggies and meats in the wrap. I wish i could take the Hot Sauce they use home with me! I always get extra hot sauce cuz it's just that damn good!The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with not a lot of seating during busy times, but it is a mainstay on thayer street and has outlasted a lot of other places that have come and gone over the years. If you like good Mediterranean, actually, if you like good food you should do yourself a favor and go check out East Side Pockets!"], ["A C.", "Best falafel I have ever had. \u00a0Ever."], ["Anne C.", "It's not easy to find falafel in Rhode Island but not only do they have it here, it's delicious. The falafel plate comes with rice with lentils, pita, and salad. You get 5 mini donut falafels. Great value for the $8. Worth the drive to providence!"], ["Yaz D.", "I'm of Middle Eastern descent, and have tried food from Middle Eastern restaurants far and wide, and let me tell you - this place is a gem. Paul and his crew serve up big, delicious pockets with big hearts and friendly smiles! The value and quality you get here just can't be beat. Aside from what's already been mentioned (falafel sandwiches and wraps are amazing), if you're feeling adventurous, give the kibbeh a go. You won't be sorry."], ["Olivia P.", "I eat vegan.You can get a freaking good falafel as a vegan here. Yum. I might go get a falafel again tonight."], ["Jacqui G.", "This place is an institution. \u00a0Always packed and for good reason. \u00a0The guys who run it have speed and service on lock down. \u00a0If you're looking for a perfect falafal wrap at a great price, come here."], ["Josh W.", "Consistently great food fast for as long as I can remember. It is BY FAR the BEST Felafel joint in New England at least. IMO. (I'm not saying middle eastern or Lebanese or Syrian. Im Saying felafel joint.) The felafel is crispy and perfectly seasoned. Meats are marinated wonderfully. Veggies are fresh. They gotta be with how fast they blow thru them. They get great grape leaves. The condiments are good. The hummus can be a touch bitter but that's ok by me because the pita chips are a bit sweet. And the baklava is ethereal. The prices have not changed to much in recent years which is great when I think about where they are located. I love east side pockets. I hope they remain forever and are not eaten by corporate jackholes."], ["Brianna M.", "This place was delicious! My family and I were visiting Brown for the day, and I found this gem and decided to have lunch there. It is a very tiny restaurant with not much seating. The line was long as well, but from other Yelp reviews I wasn't surprised when we got up to the front quickly. I got the combo pocket with the chicken and falafel. It was super yummy, inexpensive and filling. We also got the falafel appetizer. I thought it was yummy, but my family didn't really care for it. I would come here again!"], ["Michael V.", "Grilled chicken falafel wrap. \u00a0Done and done. \u00a0Ive been going for years. \u00a0The 2 dozen or so times ive been this.place has never dissapointed me. The reviews dont lie!"], ["Emma W.", "Oh how I miss my quick and tasty meals from East Side Pockets. \u00a0With my Celiac diagnosis and my subsequent removal of gluten from my diet, I am no longer able to eat at my former favorite falafel joint.I was always a fan of the gyro with lots of yummy tzaziki and pickles! The possibilities are endless with their menu. \u00a0You can have a wrap, a salad, a plate, or any combination of the like. \u00a0The servers' hands move quickly to serve you with your meal in no time, despite the often long lines. \u00a0Nothing special with regard to ambiance, but it's nice to know that this place has changed very little in all the years it's been open, despite Thayer Street morphing around it. \u00a0And I mean that in the best way possible!There is no other place I would recommend for a quick falafel meal in Providence!"], ["Dirk D.", "When I say \"Great\" you say \"Food\". \u00a0GREAT........"]], "Skewers Restaurant": []}
