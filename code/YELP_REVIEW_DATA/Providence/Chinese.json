Dark lighting with candles, Chinese lanterns in the dining room. Quite trendy! There is some pop/rock music playing. Just the perfect volume. The overall appearance was clean. A place I would frequent!The food and drinks were superb. Both times I visited, I ordered sushi. They were fabulous. The sushi was neatly rolled and presented. I had enough wasabi and pickled ginger to accompany my order. The drinks were good. Not watered down or loaded with too much ice. It was perfect.Finally, the staff, very accommodating and friendly!

We loved the nime chow loaded with small, but snappy shrimp. \u00a0There was a just-right mix of sprouts, thai basil and noodles. And it was rolled up neatly - seems like a given, but lately I've happened upon some untidy nime chow and it kinda drives me crrraazzzy. \u00a0These rolls were tidy AND tasty.The wings were coated with a crispy, light batter that had the faintest hint of lemongrass. \u00a0They were tossed with red spicy peppers, scallions and jalapeno rings. \u00a0I enjoyed a couple of the jalapeno rings at the start - nice flavor, saut\u00e9ed with some garlic, not much heat until THE FIVE ALARM FIRE WENT OFF in me mouth. \u00a0Whew...the heat sneaks up. \u00a0Use caution ( and do not rip a Fresca out of the 12 pack of soda next to you hoping to quench the flames...bubbles make it worse.

I was a little bummed that a couple of the \"flats\" had shattered bones. \u00a0Sticks and stones (and knives) can break chicken bones, but the word is \"never choke on 'em\".Ok - so the delicate soup. \u00a0The seasoning and broths were a little too heavy for me in their version of my tasty favorite. \u00a0I am not looking for a watered down broth but I just thought it was a bit overpowering. \u00a0I did add the beef which was a huge disappointment. \u00a0I am no stranger to gristle and fat having grown up on a steady diet of schnitzel and ox tails, but I would expect meat in my delicate soup to be tender and not a lot of work to eat. \u00a0Every single piece of meat was flavorful, but took a few too many chews in the end to be enjoyable. \u00a0Not a menu item I would order again.I wish there were half stars. \u00a0I think three is too generous, two stars too little. \u00a0Since it's take-out and not a real sit down meal, I'm rounding up. \u00a0All the flavors and making of a good meal are there. \u00a0Just a little rough around the edges.I would try the food here again...service was friendly and prompt, interior looked clean and the menu promising. \u00a0The white board featured some yummy - sounding adult bevvies from their small bar.

When I was in middle and high school, my dad would pick me up from school and take me out on father/daughter lunch dates at least once a week. More often than not, we would end up at Four Seasons, where I always ordered the same thing- nime chow, homestyle bean curd, and white rice. About six years ago, I took my husband to Four Seasons so I could share with him this place that has such a special place in my heart. He loved the food, but unfortunately we didn't go back until now. Shortly after we visited, Four Seasons experienced a fire, shutting down the restaurant for quite a while.Silly me, I thought Four Seasons never reopened! However, last week, when I was discussing good Asian restaurants with my co-worker, I brought up Four Seasons and lamented how it closed down. He then informed me that it definitely was open- in fact, he said he went there last week!And lo and behold, when I called ahead last Saturday to make sure they were open, they were!Four Seasons is more of a Pan-Asian restaurant, offering lots of cuisines from Southeast Asia as well as standard Chinese favorites.When we sat down, we were happy to see green tea brought to the table without even having to ask!My husband and I started with orders of vegetarian nime chow, or spring rolls. \u00a0Stuffed with rice noodles, mint, and some veggies and doused with peanut sauce- these nime chow are definitely some of the best in the state. \u00a0The rice paper wrapping was nice and chewy without being sticky or greasy.For dinner, I ordered brown rice and vegetables in a lemongrass sauce, to which I added steamed tofu and peanuts. \u00a0The serving size was huge- I could barely eat one-third of my meal! \u00a0The dish was amazing- the veggies were fresh, the sauce was bursting with flavor, and the addition of tofu and peanuts were a nice protein punch that gave the dish some lasting power!A special word on their lemongrass sauce- I could really just eat a bucket of this sauce all by itself! \u00a0What a perfect way to sop up the rice!Thank goodness I found out that Four Seasons is back in action post-fire. \u00a0The food is so tasty, and it is worth mentioning that the service is out of this world. \u00a0The staff was so smiley and attentive and super willing to accommodate special requests."], ["Linna C.", "This restaurant is too good .

However, during my last visit in November, the service was only average and the food was unfortunately not very good. My friend and I each ordered a couple of Jacky's sushi dishes, and the quality underwhelmed. The texture of the fish was not great, and seasonings were all over-done. I ordered a roll I had previously enjoyed here, and it came to the table drowning in sauces with limp, old garnishes. For now, I will write this off as a one-time fluke, but I will certainly be watching for an improvement the next time. Jacky's is too expensive to tolerate slipping food quality.

We had an awesome time, will definitely be returning, and if you're thinking of going, you should go. First of all, the complimentary valet parking is a nice touch, and from the moment you pull into the driveway/courtyard you can tell you're in for a treat. The ambiance and decor are fantastic, between the fish tanks, modern design, and glass walls letting you see the river outsde. The hostess was extremely hospitable, showed us right to our table by the window overlooking waterplace park (which by the way would be an awesome date idea for waterfire, though this was just a regular night). Now here's where it gets good. We sit down, my girlfriend mentions she's a little chilly (wearing basically a sleeveless shirt and shorts) and I suggest that I grab her sweater from the car. She says not to, she's fine. The hostess overheard this, and about 15 seconds later the waiter comes over with some hot tea to warm her up. Now THAT is good service. For the rest of the evening, the service was arguably the best I've ever seen. The food was awesome as far as taste and presentation, and there were so many things on the menu that we'll have to go back to try some others. We had a sushi roll that had the name Tiger in it (don't remember the rest of the name), the crab rangoons, and a \"wet\" style noodle and chicken dish. Now, there are two things that I would say were not ideal. First, as others mention, this place is more expensive than your typical pan-asian/sushi restaurant. Honestly, though, you get what you pay for, and if you don't want to pay fine dining prices then you're not going to get this kind of quality anywhere. Second, it was loud. To be clear, this was not the fault of the restaurant or design, but more bad luck/timing. We had a very loud group of 4 behind us, and two birthday parties nearby, and many of the people in those groups had clearly been doing a bit of drinking and were not afraid to yell.

Very pretty but not enough hamachi to offset the strong sauce that they paired it with. \u00a0Followed by Tako, Eel and Toro which was unremarkable.I'm not sure when it became fashionable to pair uni with an overpowering green but it seems driven by aesthetics. \u00a0Tony Bourdain calls sea urchin the best thing that I've ever put in my mouth. \u00a0I tend to agree with him but this green totally overwhelms the subtle flavor of the fish.

An over-the-top pan-Asian dream home b.) The main dining room and bar of a Carnival cruise ship run aground in downtown Providence c.) A restaurant serving food that's actually pretty decent in an environment that is totally unique (Hint: the answer is \"c.\" But perhaps there should also be an option \"d.) All of the above.\")I first went to Jacky's during their initial week or two in operation. At that time, our meal was decidedly mezza mezza: I recall that our group of four was pleased with exactly 50% of the dishes we ordered, and unsold on the other half. In particular, the lettuce wraps couldn't then, and can't now, hold a candle to those served at PF Chang's - and I'm truly sorry to say that, because I feel strongly about supporting a local business over a national chain, whenever possible. \u00a0We ate at a table by the large picture windows overlooking the Providence River basin. While it was not quite yet a culinary triumph, it was certainly visually astonishing. The d\u00e9cor then, as now, struck me as totally bombastic: almost bordello-like in its brash mix of strong competing colors, lush fabrics, a massive circular bar upon entry and boudoir-style lighting throughout. \u00a0Not my thing, but that's totally subjective--and really, the proof points that a restaurant should rest on are its great food and service. I've since returned a couple of times to Jacky's, and the food has improved so that it's now universally very good. The sushi, noodle dishes and desserts are all tasty, and the hot sake has a bottomless quality of near Biblical proportions. Mark my words; you'll still be pouring long after you expect the narrow ceramic carafe to run dry. If you're prone to getting queasy around loud interior design, this shouldn't be your first choice. Personally, if I was designing an Asian restaurant, I'd go for a look that reads \"dim and damask.\" But if you're in the mood for a show (indeed, even the patrons are on display with Jacky's open floor plan), or simply fancy a celebratory party atmosphere served up with your fried rice, Jacky's fits the bill."], ["Andre V.", "The food here is pretty stellar! Always a little cautious about fusion(y) places but I really enjoyed this place. The sushi was very well prepared and delicious. The Rangoon was good and the same can be said for the spring rolls. The stand outs however, had to be the lobster and sirloin steak tips. Both were amazingly delicious and tender. The flavor was just absolutely spot on. If I had any room left I would have loved to try even more."], ["Benjamin J.", "I have mixed feelings about this place after my first visit.If I were rating solely on atmosphere, this place would get a 10 star review. They clearly spared no expense on decorations and the environment. Its worth a trip here just to look around and be in the amazing restaurant they've created (not to mention the view is great as well). I came here for apps and drinks, so don't have too much to say about their food except that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Drinks on the other hand... This leads me into the one issue I had with Jackys. Our bartender. We sat at the bar so we dealt with the same person for our food and drinks. He \"forgot\" our food when it was ready, so it did not come out piping hot as expected. Understandable. When my lemon drop martini was delivered is where I had an issue. It was pink. My friend and I were commenting on how we've never had/seen a pink lemon drop martini, and figured they had used pink lemonade/pink lemonade vodka. Another bartender overheard our comments and approached us. She told us they did not carry pink lemonade, nor pink lemonade vodka. She then proceeded to tell us that our first bartender is not a good bartender, and that we should've sat at her side of the bar. This is all nice and fun, but why didn't she correct the issue? She clearly knew we did not get what we ordered, and showed no sign of hospitality around the issue. The drink itself was good, so I didn't raise a stink about it. The rest of our stay our bartender chatted with guests that I'm assuming tip him well/are regulars; because we rarely saw him the rest of the evening. It wasnt until he gave us our bill that he was nice/friendly to us. Might have just been an off night for him, or perhaps this is a regular occurence. Still a pretty decent place to check out, and perhaps on another visit, my review will change."], ["Julie A.", "Fantastic place! Most RI-ers know of Jackie's Galaxy which has multiple locations around the state, but this is their \"high end\" location downtown.

I'm not a huge fan of the Chinese food.One of my experiences I went with a gang and the table had rave reviews, it just didn't do it for me. It seemed like normal 'ehhhh' Chinese food.

I'm always very cautious when trying new places because my veganism tends to put a damper on my sporadic outings but Jacky's delivered without a hiccup. Our waitress was freaking amazing. She was so attentive to my dietary restrictions and explained everything that was in my meal just so that I had that piece of mind (no one ever does and I didn't even ask!) so it made my entire visit that much more pleasant. It is situated in Down City and clearly captivates the Downtown high-class theme.

It's a love at first sight. Noodles 102 has a cozy atmosphere where you can have tasty noodle dishes and soups . You can create your own meal by picking from the variety of noodles: udon, rice noodles, wheat, veggie noodles etc. then protein (chicken, shrimp etc.) and finally the veggies. \u00a0Great concept and perfect for those who are picky eaters. They do have some signature dishes with rice or noodles on the menu as well, plus the noodle soups.My favorite dish was the one they substituted noodles with cabbage and stir fried veggies with chicken. The waiter/owner called it the mushy ( not on the menu yet). He also mentioned of a new dish, \"spring roll salad\". It is not on the menu yet, but soon to be part of the menu. I went there with 4 friends and I had a chance to try 5 different dishes. I enjoyed all of them.It is hard to call this place a typical Asian restaurant. The dishes contain less oil, probably less MSG and other unhealthy stuff that a typical Americanized Asian food would contain. If you are a Asian buffet lover, Noodle 102 is too healthy for you. The best way to describe their food is; simple, refined, Asian, home made, fresh, creative, flavorful and healthy. Place is well decorated and cozy. Even though it's not big, tables are not too close to each other. The waiter/owner is extremely nice and he will tailor the food as you like.

Oh by the way - this place is BYOB which is the greatest value add any restaurant can have. I love bringing the good craft beer you can't get in any restaurant. Anyways - then the owner brought us edamame for our wait. No charge. Our table was ready in 15 minutes. Food was great. I had the stir fry. Also had nime chow that came with a nice peanut sauce. Can't wait to go back and try the ramen and bbq rice dish. Okay update - we went back and got the pho and the clay pot rice dish. Loved the pho but the rice dish is the SHOW STOPPER.

You get good sized portions for a good price. I like the mix and match nature of the menu. I like the cozy hole-in-the-wall atmosphere.I don't care for the service. The food always comes out quick and hot. That's not the issue. The issue is getting someone to actually come over and take your order or, even worse, take care of your check when the meal is over and you're sitting around waiting to leave.

There were only 2 shrimp in the entire bowl (and there is an extra charge for shrimp). The coconut curry broth was tasty, but it needed more protein and veggies to make it a meal.

After exploring many, if not all, soup/noodle places in the Providence area, I was surprised to see that Noodles 102 had managed to not be on my list. On a chilly Monday evening, Ryan and I decided to check out what noodly goodness this place had to offer. The place is cozy and rather small. It could be romantic date location OR a fun place for girl's night. One thing to note: this place is BYOB. JACKPOT.Here's why I gave it only 3 stars:- The service, while pleasant, was really slow. It took us a long time to get our soups after some rather mediocre Nime Chow. - Portions are ok but for $10 a bowl, I expect to be able to swim in my bowl of soup especially when many pho places around Providence make a solid bowl of soup for under $8.Overall, I think the place is a good place for variety but the price point is a little much. Maybe I'm a little spoiled with getting killer nime chow for $3 and a giant bowl on Cambodian Rice Noodle Soup from a place the rhymes with Hapsara for $5. :)Not a bad place but not nothing too memorable."], ["Nathan A.", "If I lived closer to this place, I'd go every few days. Fairly priced. Great food. Wonderful staff. Cute vibe. The selections of noodle soups are awesome. They cater very well to vegan and vegetarians. Their stone pot dishes are great...and very hot in temperature. Great apps. Love the nime chow. Only 2 negative thoughts: 1-the chicken is usually dry and can tell it was frozen. I opt for veggies instead. 2-they randomly close for vacations and such without a lot of notice."], ["Andrew D.", "I love this place, house special stir fry is always fresh and healthy.

I made this known to my server \u00a0Erica as I walked in. \u00a0I asked to be seated away from the other diners, she was accommodating right from the get go.

While easy to miss, and not overly appealing from the curb, this place could easily define \"hidden gem\". Yelp has continually been a source in my search for good Pho, and with positive reviews from a large group of foodies, Noodles was my next stop. \u00a0I made it in just before their lunchtime closing (they run 11-3 then 5-9 during the week). We were greeted at the door by a younger man in a white chefs coat who saw us to our table, filled our waters, explained their menu and brought us out a small plate of \"Asian style cucumbers\" that were absolutely delicious. We were then greeted... Not by an Asian man or woman (that has been the case in nearly every Pho place I have been to), but an older, French gentleman (who may have been the owner as I heard another employee call him \"boss\"). He also went over the menu, told us about a handful of specials and brought us over a small plate of fried rice. As always, we went fairly simple with the order. With about 10 noodle types, several broths & a selection of \"add ins\" it was a great opportunity to sample something new. \u00a0I went with the wide rice noodle (listed as freshly made) in chicken broth with chicken and made spicy (they have a spicy miso option I may try next time as well). The kids went with thin rice noodles, and the wife had a coconut chicken clay pot. We also (of course) got an order of fried pork dumplings. The dumplings came out -not pan fried - but deep fried, which I loved. Normally I prefer steamed, but the extra crisp of these was great and the filling was very tasty. Our meals came out soon after (actually some of the fastest service at a noodle place I've had). The large, tilted bowl was full to the top of hot, steaming goodness. The clay pot smelled fantastic, and the kids soup was nicely split into two bowls. Plain and simple... It was all fantastic. I absolutely destroyed my noodles. So much to the point that for the first time at a noodle/pho place, I drank the entire bowl of broth as well. The wide rice noodles were reminiscent of the \"drunken noodles\" at Thai Excursion that I love (that is a wok dish, not a soup) and super fresh. The veggies in the kids noodles were non-traditional corn and carrots which they loved (of course my son slathered on their chili paste for the extra kick he loves). \u00a0I also grabbed a few forks full of the jasmine rice/coconut chicken clay pot. It was very flavorful and a nice big portion. We were sent on our way with some Ferrero Rocher candies and a handshake. Bottom line - though there are chopsticks and Asian inspired dishes, this isn't a typical Pho experience. That being said, it has defiantly become my favorite spot for a warm bowl of goodness. There are many options to try. While they don't have different size options for the bowls (I'm an XL eater for life), you can see the pride in their food, from presentation to taste. The server/owner was comical, soft spoken, and very pleasant. He had a great rapport with some other customers who appeared to be regulars. We were actually craving more later in the night and will definitely be returning soon. Fantastic job!!"], ["Jean C.", "This cute little East Side hide-away is fabulous!

He asked the cooks, why not both, and they threw in a few sliced tomatoes with the beef.Usually, a cashier might slyly tack on an extra buck or so onto your order. Nope! Same exact price.Also gave me a free cup of ice water while waiting, which some places don't do. Customer service is amazing -- they bend over to make you happy here, and in a genuine, respectful manner.So when I got the food, I was thinking -- knowing Thayer Street, $9 doesn't get you much; probably the beef portions are skimpy or something.

My order included Chengdu Spicy Dumplings, Beef Stew Noodle Soup, and Beef Curry Rice platter. Dumplings were a huge disappointment. It was as if they had run out of filling, and thought a pea-sized clump was sufficient and appropriate to use (pic included). The noodle dish was boring as the beef was dry and difficult to chew.

However, their chicken consistently disappoints me. Some of the most tasteless chicken I've ever tasted, even for low-scale chinese take-out places. The sauce is inconsistently applied so either the chicken is dry and chewy or overly sauced and too sweet.I've also had poor experiences with waiting time on food, often waiting long after it was supposed to be finished for small orders, both for take-out and dine in. My girlfriend once ordered a dumpling lunch special and waited at least 30 min before asking them where it was, they assured it was almost ready, then brought out some room temperature dumplings 5 minutes later. I suspect the food was just sitting on the counter in the kitchen and no one brought it out.However, the staff are polite, the restaurant is clean and attractive, and the prices are reasonable.

I get on the phone and ask if they have gan chao nu he and jiao yan pai gu (not sure what these are in English but I think it might be chow fun and salt and pepper pork), they do that's awesome.

(was kind of funny I was talking on the phone to the guy in Mandarin and when he repeated my order back to me it was also in Mandarin except for \"orange chicken\")It got here in about 30 minutes which is pretty good for delivery times. However the food was tragic. The salt and pepper pork was overly battered and the gan chao nu he was so bland. Both MuMu (now Gangnam Flavor I believe) and Golden Stone have way better salt and pepper pork, Golden Stone doesn't have gan chao nu he but that's alright. My partner said the orange chicken was ok but she's had better. At least the lo mein was good...Don't think I would order from here again. It was cheap which was nice but I think Golden Stone is just as cheap and tastes better. MuMu is even better than both of those but they're also more expensive so it's a tradeoff. Definitely not Yan's again though."]]}
