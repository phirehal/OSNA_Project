I guess I just expected better service from such a BEAUTIFUL establishment. It was the night before Thanksgiving so I expected it to be busy.... but to only have 2 bartenders on, is unacceptable. The drinks were delicious but took some time to get both times we went up. The worst part was standing at the bar trying to wave down someone to print your check.

Bar menu after 10 o'clock was more expansive with choices than I thought it would be. We had oysters, calamari, a burger, a fried rice dish, and desserts. Oysters were tasty, calamari amazing, burger cooked rare to medium rare, though we asked for medium, but still tasty; desserts were okay but definitely not shareable size, and the rice dish was spicy yet still somehow bland. Winner here was the drinks. I had a Kentucky Campfire I think, which was made with Laphroaig, and if you're a fan of that single malt, it was a stunner. Best drink I've had in months. Regular menu looks amazing. Wish they'd keep it going a bit later. Always amazes me that restaurants near sold out theaters don't keep a full kitchen menu post show--there's literally 3000 people coming out of a show--chances are, some of them are going to be looking for a proper meal. Anyway. Front of house and server were very kind and capable, and the beautiful building would make this a perfect date spot I think."], ["Kayla W.", "The Dorrance is beautiful. Very classy and comfortable atmosphere. It looks like a glammed up historical bank, with a mini lounge in the refurbished vault space in the back. Small, seasonal, and fresh menu which is a little pricy. Our waiter was great! He was very attentive and friendly. The Caesar salad was pretty large for a side, and the risotto was delicious! Their strawberry shortcake however was too ' New American ' and was really not good :/ it's was a shortbread crust with a rubbery fruit leather sandwiched between with fresh cream. They have upstairs balcony seating as well as the main floor, and offer private party events. The only huge downside is parking. They only offer vallet on the weekends, and if you come during the week it's near impossible to find a spot to park and are forced to bite the bullet and pay 10$ to park in the lot which totally stinks..."], ["Sarah Jean R.", "I've only tried the drinks here, but for that and the ambiance I give all 5 stars. Each hand-crafted cocktail is prepared to order and delicious each and every time. The staff here is super friendly and will help you get through the menu to find a cocktail that is perfect for your personal taste. There are plenty of places to sit at and around the bar. You can even take your drink to the back and enjoy some time in the old bank vault. Between the beautiful space and the wonderful bartenders, you can't go wrong with an evening at The Dorrance."], ["Angela I.", "I came here for a little date with me, myself, and I. It was pretty quiet, as it was a Thursday, but I really enjoyed being served by Stephanie, who is on the fabulous team here. When I explained to her that I wasn't drinking, she was incredibly accommodating and said she'd be happy to have the bartender whip me up a mocktail. Holy smokes, best drink sans alcohol I've ever had, starring rhubarb, pineapple, and a splash of lemon lime.The music and ambience here were chic yet not exactly hipster... At some point, I realized Bush was playing, that melancholic cello in \"Glycerine\" taking me back a few years. Like way, way back.Stephanie recommended the curried cauliflower as an appetizer. I expected this to be a saucy curry dish, but it arrived as huge hunks of cauliflower dusted with curry and topped with chili threads and mint. It was delicious.After the cauliflower came pappardelle with lobster for the main course. This dish blew my mind. It was creamy and filling without putting me into a food coma; the lobster was fresh and the succotash of zucchini, corn, and bunapi mushrooms gave the dish a lighter feel. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Finally, I ordered the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. This was a generous portion and would probably do well to be split between two people. Thank you, folks at the Dorrance, for realizing that cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in summer is made infinitely tastier with berries. I ordered espresso and called it a night. All of Stephanie's recommendations were on point and knowledgeable... I highly recommend this venue for events or a quiet dinner date (even with yourself)!"], ["Kristen S.", "4.5 starsWe had our ceremony and reception at The Dorrance on 9/26 and it was even better than I had imagined it would be.The Dorrance was our last stop after looking at close to 10 venues in Boston, Newport and Providence. We instantly fell in love with how beautiful the space is and knew it was \"the one.\"Regina and Lindsay were so helpful leading up to the big day. Regina, the co-owner, constantly reassured me and let me know she was there for me and would do whatever needed to be done to make the day exactly how we wanted it.Co-owner Jean was in charge of us the night of the wedding and she really knows her stuff. She runs a tight ship, which is great because she made sure we ate and were where we needed to be. It's easy to lose track of time and miss things, but Jean made sure we were right on schedule the entire night.A few small complaints: 1. The cake and coffee weren't served; they were placed in the corner of the other side of the room, where cocktail hour displays were set up earlier. A lot of guests didn't know it was there (the band announced it later), and it was also difficult for people to juggle cake and coffee through the dance floor back to their seats. We paid a lot of money for our cake, and a lot of it went to waste. There was an entire tier of vanilla cake that I didn't even see sliced and they didn't give us any left over to take home (besides our top tier of course)We were also charged an additional $3 per person for \"coffee service\" and there's no way that we went through over $300 worth of coffee (there were just 2 carafes left by the cake, and again, most guests didn't know it was there). Cake and coffee should be served to guests! 2. We paid extra per person for a \"late night pizza\" snack. \u00a0I was told by Regina that these would be passed by servers, but they ended up sticking them in the same corner that they stuck the cake. Again, not many people knew it was there, and by the time the band announced it, the pizza was cold. For the amount we paid, there were not many pizzas laid out either! 3. \u00a0I don't like the \"by consumption bar.\" I'm pretty sure our final bar tab was padded by the bartenders. \u00a0Most venues offer a flat rate open bar price per person. \u00a0This is a better way to go, and they should think about changing this.Overall, our night was absolutely amazing. The food was delicious and we received so many compliments. Countless guests described our wedding as \"regal.\"I would wholeheartedly recommend this venue for your wedding, and we look forward to going back to eat dinner for a special occasion."], ["Maria P.", "I have wanted to eat here for a long time, so going during restaurant week made good sense. \u00a0I think had we gone here during any other time I would have been disappointed in the portion size. Flavor was awesome, so 5 stars for that. Regards to portion size, I give you 3 stars, hence my 4 stars rating. Let me explain. I chose the curried roasted cauliflower for my appetizer choice. I think my small rectangular plate had 5 pieces of cauliflower on it. Okay, \u00a0this was not acceptable when this is not an expensive vegetable. I looked over at my boyfriend's emense (well, emense compared to my dish) bowl of yummy mussels and it was clear he chose the winner. We are meat eaters, so the New York sirloin was a no brainer. I was not pleased that my meat arrived pre-sliced (I have been cutting my own meat since age 7). It was cooked more than the med rare I asked for, but it was still juicy and packed with flavor. Dessert was chosen only because it was included in the 3 course deal. I chose a s'more flour less cake and he got a coconut mango and pineapple Panna cotta. Both were great and satisfying. \u00a0Be prepared that if you go hungry do not expect large portion sizes and do get an appetizer. If you want a 30 something dollar steak, then choose another establishment that will have at least 8 ounces for you."], ["Michelle M.", "Went with friends for a cocktail after work. I have been here for cocktails several times and every time I ask myself why I don't go more often. This is a beautiful place in a great location. \u00a0The bartenders are fantastic.

Do yourself a favor and stop in for a drink."], ["Gale P.", "Went there after Trinity and the expectations were as I expected! \u00a0Knowledgable waiter (Brian C.), great drinks, great food, all priced reasonably! \u00a0We had butternut + lobster soup, scallops and risotto and filet and lobster tail - all delicious! \u00a0We cleaned our plates off! \u00a0Would certainly return."], ["Mrs. H.", "So my one complaint from back when this place opened was the menu. They've since changed it and it is perfect now. Bar service and cocktails are pure perfection. Bar menu is so so so good. Top notch burger and fries. Fried oysters. Chicken wings. Great bar food plus super classy drinks in a beautiful space."], ["Victoria K.", "I've visited The Dorrance twice thus far. The first was to the bar to explore their wonderful cocktail menu, and the second was for dinner during Restaurant Week. On both occasions I was met with lovely service. Not only the decor absolutely stunning in this space, with the high ceilings and elegant adornments, but the food and drinks really follow through with the same level of sophistication.The Dorrance is definitely well-known for their craft cocktails. I highly recommend trying one (or several). I've tasted a handful during my visits and have been impressed by all of them. You really can't go wrong.Something I love about Restaurant Week at The Dorrance is that the options on their RW menu are right off of their regular menu. This way you know you are getting the true experience and not some watered down version of The Dorrance experience. My absolute favorite course of my meal was the mussels Normandi appetizer. It was quite possibly the best mussels dish I've ever had (or at least in the top 2 or 3). It had so much flavor and was just cooked so perfectly. Mussels can easily fall into a rut, but these are absolute perfection.I also tried the short rib, which is another favorite. I've had great short ribs and mediocre ones in the past. The short rib here is quite excellent and definitely a great choice.Dessert was also lovely. I had the spiced chocolate bar, which was a chocolate-lover's dream. I also tasted my sister's peanut butter and banana jar, which was also quite lovely.I don't think you can really go wrong at The Dorrance. Between the excellent food and service, and the stunning ambiance, it really is worth experiencing at least once. And PS, the coat room is actually in a giant vault! Very cool re-purposing of this space!"], ["Patrick F.", "Had such a great experience here. The building is beautiful and enormous. Our server Stephanie was amazing, she was attentive and even recommended other bars/bakeries/etc to visit while in Providence."], ["Shari W.", "One of the most fabulous spaces in all of Providence.Now a restaurant/bar/event space, the Dorrance is beautiful. It used to be a bank and you can still walk into the vault. They have it set up as a little private seating area. The balcony is also a unique space. The bar is huge and runs all the way across the front of the restaurant. The bar tender is skillful and if you ask for a drink that is \"levular\" you will get a surprise!"], ["Alejandro V.", "The location, selection of drinks and music are unbeatable. However, the service is absolutely sub-par for an establishment of this caliber. My party sat at a table and waited for over 20 minutes to receive drink menus and any offer from wait staff to order. Finally, we decided to order a bottle of wine and were asked for our identification in a crass manner despite having already provided ID to enter the Dorrance in the first place. The waiter was mean, throwing our ID cards on the table at us. The staff are either clueless or actively mean. Would recommend only for private events or if you stand by the bar area."], ["Xiao Z.", "Alright, you want to impress your date, or enjoy live music without a cover, or just show off being relaxing at one of the best bar/restaurants in Providence? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then stop reading this review and go to the Dorrance!They have amazing mixed drinks; my favorite involve tequila or whiskey, but everything is just great! They also have live music in the evening, around 9:30pm-11pm, every time I've visited; granted, I've only gone on Friday and weekend nights, but I've never been disappointed. The drinks are a bit on the pricier side, $9-$12 per drink, but it's still much cheaper than NY and you can't be too frugal when you're trying to court the love of your life ;)I've never eaten here before, so, I'll leave that to the next reviewer."], ["Denise G.", "I wanted the Dorrance to be more than it was. \u00a0I think the Dorrance wants to be more than it is.Let me start off by saying that the space is FANTASTIC. \u00a0Beautiful marble floor, stained glass windows, the old bank counter as the bar... really quite breath taking. \u00a0The services was also top notch.Now to the drinks and food. \u00a0EXCELLENT cocktails, but have you seen the drink menu... really, Dorrance, you are trying too hard. \u00a0Like a pretty girl with way too much make up. \u00a0You can serve an excellent drink without needing 20 adjectives to describe the 10 ingredients in each drink. Next to the drink menu, the dinner menu was clean, simple and local. \u00a0The food was complex and tasty, but not quite up to their price point. \u00a0My husband got the duo of lamb for $36, and his medallions were a bit over cooked. \u00a0Our friend got the short ribs and needed to ask for \u00a0extra \"au jus\" to get them down, and that was $30 bucks! Really? \u00a0If you are going to charge these rates, the meal should be flawless! That said, my beet ravioli was reasonably priced for a pasta dish at $26 and was quite good. \u00a0Our other friend got the scallops which was definitely the best meal at the table.Bottom line: It was a good meal, and we had a lovely night, but I next time we want to drop that sort of cash for dinner, we may head to Chez Pascal or Al Forno. \u00a0Sorry Dorrance."], ["Jacklyn D.", "Absolutely LOVED it here. Tonight, I got engaged and my fianc\u00e9 had made a reservation for dinner! Our server Steph was incredible! She made our experience one to remember and we will definitely be returning!

When we arrived, there were only a few other patrons there, so the bartenders paid us wonderful attention. They were all INCREDIBLY friendly, and I would go back just to chat with them again. The mixology at the Dorrance is great...similar to The Eddy, which I love...and the apps my dad and I had were delicious (there's not a lot one can do to oysters to make them superb, but my cauliflower appetizer was genius). I definitely plan to come back and stay for a while."], ["Nicole R.", "Sat at the bar with the mister after going to 95 Empire for a show. The cocktails were thoughtfully crafted and the bartenders even gave suggestions on what to choose. I started out the night with the \"Can you beat a pear?\" which has: Half Moon Orchard Gin, St. George Spiced Pear Liqueur, Lemon, Cinnamon Syrup, Bitter Truth Aromatic Bitters, Barkeep Baked Apple Bitters. Delicious, it was like fall in a tiny glass. Then i moved on to \"Gods and Sages\" which has: Square One Botanical Vodka, Aperol, Lemon, Sage Spirit, Lemongrass Syrup, Lavender Bitters, Fresh Sage. Very tasty... definitely didn't think i would like the sage but it was well balanced in the drink and not over powering. The hus went for the \"Smoking Gun\" which has: Bols Genever, Old Weller, 107 Bourbon, Averna, Jerry Thomas Bitters, Tobacco Bitters. It was even served in an ash tray which was pretty cool. Loved the quality of the drinks and the prices were comparable to other places in the area but in my opinon were much more tasty.

Everything was happening but I almost didn't even notice the waitstaff. I love that.I did order from the prix fixe menu. The mussels Normandie were delicious with little wood mushrooms, bacon and apples. The braised short rib was an itsy bitsy tiny piece of meat with a swath of celery puree and a few Brussel sprouts. While it was delicious, \u00a0it was comical how little food was presented...I really would have preferred an entr\u00e9e sized entr\u00e9e, not an amuse bouche. \u00a0Seriously. The cinnamon spaced chocolate bar with threads of pepper was delicious too; the pepper threads just seemed to get in the way though.In short, beautiful space, perfect service.

I feel bad that I haven't been there in a while due to family obligations, but I have to say that if you work downtown there is no better place to hang out after work and avoid the rush hour traffic over a proper craft cocktail. The flavor profiles that the team puts together is just outstanding and whatever you try will be enjoyable.

It's in an old bank building and they restored the building beautifully. \u00a0It has a nice open space where you can have dinner, and large stained glass windows on all sides. \u00a0I couldn't take my eyes off of the beautiful ceiling moulding, it was so detailed and reminded me a lot of how PPAC is on the inside. \u00a0The Dorrance is ornate and refined, yet the bar still had a cozy and romantic feel to it. The one word that I think best describes The Dorrance is \"swanky.\" \u00a0It has an old feel to it, like you've stepped back in time. \u00a0Our bartender was awesome and mixed us some great drinks. \u00a0If you do get to go during the fall season, definitely order the \"It's the Great Pumpkin Drink, Charlie Brown!\" It was a really tasty and I almost felt like it was more of a dessert because it was sweet and frothy. \u00a0My husband had the \"Smoking Gun,\" which was made with tobacco bitters and served in a glass in an ashtray, and we both thought that was a really cool way to serve the drink. \u00a0They have a pretty good list of other fun sounding cocktails and also a beer and wine menu. \u00a0I also heard they have live jazz bands that play on the weekends, although we didn't stay long enough to hear the band that was setting up while we were there.We went on a Friday night and it was busy, but since the space is so large there is plenty of room for people to spread out while enjoying a drink. \u00a0The bar is also pretty big and we didn't have any issues finding seats. \u00a0I really enjoyed coming here and will definitely be coming back soon, maybe next time for some jazz music!"], ["Cheese B.", "Hot damn. This place is so good. Went for a fancy dinner, and every course-- from the curried saffron cauliflower, to the silky lobster bisque, to seared scallops with pepper relish and pork belly, to banana cake with peanut butter and caramel in a mason jar -- was excellent.The Dorrance boasts about an award winning mixologist (Vito ?) and I can see why! The cocktails were balanced, intriguing, and creative- the only problem is that they go down a little too easy, so maybe take a cab home if you are planning to fully enjoy yourself here.Full disclosure- I wasn't paying for my meal, a friend with a bigger checkbook than mine and an accomplishment to celebrate was taking me out.

So if you're looking for a dapper evening, now you know where to come.For food, however, I would not necessarily recommended the Dorrance. Food, in terms of flavor and creativity, does not match up with the drinks. Without getting into particulars, I found the breaded chicken, the pork chop, and even the appetizers to fall short of their delicious appearances. In other words, I've had better elsewhere in Providence.

There was only one other female who wore jeans, but she wore heeled booties and what appeared to be a leather jacket. The others who dined wore at least dark pants or dresses. For jean lovers, if you wear heels and accessories, it'll be fine. Now onto the food...I ordered the Pappardelle and Lobster which was wonderful. Being the first time I've ordered any dish with Pappardelle, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I loved the consistency of the wide, flat pasta. The sauce was wonderfully creamy and had a strong lobster and sweet corn flavor, with forest mushrooms, and zucchini. And the Point Judith lobster chunks?

It was a banana peanut butter dish and omg it was amazing! The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was when our drink orders were taken. I understood that we all came in separately (there was 8 of us) so it must have been confusing for our waitress who was very nice btw. But our drink orders were messed up in rounds and as a server myself I'm not offended if someone writes down my drink order. We can't have perfect memory all the time. I ordered a titos dirty martini it wasn't titos and same for my friend. Another friend ordered a Pinot noir and received a Pinot Grigio.

This I'm sad to say was the highlight of our meal.For our first course we both picked the ceviche, which was lacking flavor and on the dry side. It was encased in a fried plantain shell which was so bone dry and stale, we weren't sure if it was intended to be eaten.\u00a0For our entr\u00e9es we chose the chicken prepared three ways and the wild herb me Gnocchi. The chicken was wholesome & comforting yet overly doused with salt. The best component off the dish was the coconut rice which was full of flavor.The Gnocchi on the other hand made us question... Why? What were they thinking when they put this dish menu? It offers nothing to the diner other than buyers remorse.On to our dessert and our server kindly offered us a choice of any desserts on their regular menu or their cheese plate since they were out of their restaurant week dessert offering. Alas there was no saving grace here either. The Goat Cheesecake was forgettable and the cheese plate was not put together with much thought. It wasn't bad yet all of the components on the plate lacked harmony.The space is grand and characterful.

We got the little balcony area overlooking the band to ourselves, and I quite enjoyed our nook. I'm docking a star because bartenders were rude, and my friend's Hemingway daiquiri was too tart. I had a delectable cucumber-based cocktail that I recommend wholeheartedly. At around $10 a cocktail, this isn't the place to go on a bender.

My date was already saddled up to the bar drinking a bourbon cocktail with a singular large ice cube, I liked where the night was gonna go already. I had to start with the deliciously refreshing and perfectly balanced Up and Cumber, which the bartenders and my dated joked about how it will never come off the menu. From here, this is where our night got interesting. We were made many cocktails that have transitioned off of the current menu.

I can taste the alcohol but didn't cringe from the strength- which is some crazy bartending magic1. Calamari: perfectly crispy, not greasy. I like the little fried capers & banana peppers too2. Po' burger + fries: medium rare done truly medium rare- hi quality meat & so tasty. Way better than cook & browns where it isn't slathered w/cheese & sauce3. Duck confit: well cooked w/crispy skin! Duck is naturally fatty, but they did a great job keeping it from being greasy4. Marscopone Cheesecake w/glazed bananas: I need to glaze all my bananas!

We sat front and center at the bar and watched the bartenders make magic. The only odd moment was when the hostess actually picked up my handbag from the bar and moved it so that two customers could sit. She only needed to ask me to move it 6 inches which I did. It startled me seeing my pocket book being moved by a stranger until I realized what was happening. No biggee, but odd. My boyfriend had the Kentucky Campfire: Heaven Hill 8 yr Bourbon, Cinnamon Syrup, Lemon, Orange, Jerry Thomas Bitters, Tonic, Laphroaig and I had the Pine Away: Bauza Pisco, Pineapple, Almond Orgeat, Lime, Nutmeg.

I got a steak for dinner which wasn't bad but didn't really blow me away. Also it was a bit cold. My wife's pork chop was probably the best entree we tried that night. Huge and cooked well, \u00a0but fairly boring. \u00a0That's the theme of our meal. Nothing was bad but it wasn't great either, \u00a0which for the prices they charge is kind of upsetting.

There are a few couches/chairs to chill, tables to eat at (or not) and the walls are lined with \"window benches\" all around for more seating. There is also a second floor \"balcony\" that hangs over the bar area that looked really nice. In the front corner there was a live band doing cover songs and they were actually really good! The band members played the sax, guitar, bass, piano and drums exceptionally well.

It is pretty chill on a weekday and you can't beat the atmosphere. I tried the pork chop with cheese stuffed potatoes and the monkey bar cocktail. We liked the pot de cr\u00e8me, though I would prefer it without the peanut butter crumbles. We did not love the pretzel bread, not good. I expect more of a side when I spend that much on dinner also, not a sprinkle of greens and 3 bites of potato. My friends black pasta was a pretty small portion for the price. With pasta there is no excuse for that, even if it's made in house. The consensus was that the food was fine but not special. The menu is not that impressive compared to other upscale places in town. The bread is also better elsewhere. We would go back for the bar menu but probably not for dinner."], ["Lindsay H.", "We ate here last Saturday night. Every aspect was awesome. Well thought out drink menuwith original cocktails. Good selection of wines too. Who started with the salmon appetizer, it was very unique and delicious.

I am not much of a lamb fan so I didn't taste his but he said it was out of this world. My pork was cooked perfectly but I just ran out of room.

Everything else is delicious and the portions are generous."], ["Xiao Z.", "I came here for a business event, located at the top of the building, with our private dining area, private bar, and a decent view of the surrounding street. It was nice to see there is an outdoor seating area and that even the downstairs dining region seemed very chill and properly lit. Our meal, however, was relatively disappointing. I had the nicoise salad with seared tuna (really just two small pieces of fish) and tried my friend's french-style porkchops. The overall price for the quality of the food was too disparaging and I left the restaurant feeling hungry and disappointed. The salad wasn't necessarily bad, but there was no real pizzazz; the tuna was cooked extra rare, per request, but it was missing flavor, and thus appeal. The porkchop was very tough and the green beans were stringy and wiry.Overall, my first impression of Bravo was quite disappointing, but it was spared lower rating with its ambiance, friendly staff and very warm pre-dinner bread.

Bravo is a beautiful French / American style restaurant in the heart of downtown Providence. The inside is so cozy and warm, you really feel like you are hugged as you sit in the dining room or the bar. The staff is absolutely wonderful and the food is always perfect! Usually when I go to Bravo I sit at the bar with one other person. For larger groups I will be over in the dining room. Not once in 10+ years has anything turned me off about Bravo. My food is ALWAYS hot, fresh and made to order. They are so consistently perfect that I always find myself going back, talking about them and recommending them to others. It's hard to find a restaurant that has been around as long as Bravo has and honestly say everything is still perfect - but it is! \u00a0Must try items are - The Bravo Lobster Club, Steamed Littlenecks, Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Moules Dijon, Bravo Mussels, Grilled Lamb Loin Chops, Roast Duck a l'Orange, The Beet Salad (to die for), Spinach Salad, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Pan Seared Sea Scallops. Other than these fantastic choices I truly recommend everything - haha! I have not had everything on the menu, but I trust it will always be perfect. If you are sitting at the cozy bar chances are you will come face to face with Joe, or Tait.

My boyfriend and I were in Providence for the week and wanted to try something neat downtown. It was a Friday night, but it wasn't too crowded since we had gotten there a little early. Our server was fabulous! She was super helpful in making recommendations and was very honest when we asked her about our dessert option (we were stuck between the cheesecake and the creme brulee, and she made sure we picked the creme brulee and it was to die for). My boyfriend and I each had 2 different cocktails that were really delicious and good sized for $9 drinks. They weren't the tiny cocktails you get in other metro areas! I had the steak frites and my boyfriend had the prime rib. Both were cooked exactly to our liking and the flavor was spot-on. I could have eaten their shoestring french fries with every steak for the rest of my life. If you're in Providence and you're not quite sure what you want or want something classic but casual, Bravo is the place to go!"], ["Gabriel O.", "There's more ambiance than flavor going on here at Bravo. The service here is good, and the scenery is nice, but for the price I would expect much better food. During my visit I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Bacon Wrapped Scallops. The soup was OK but nothing to write home about, the scallops were unimpressive. They were as bland as the cucumber salad that accompanied them, in fact the apple wood smoked bacon was the only flavor I can actually say I experienced in my entire dish. While the drink menu doesn't offer a lot of variety in regards to the cocktails, the ones they do offer are made well. What Bravo really needs to do though is get a handle on their menu. With good seating, good service, good bread, and good drinks, They seem to have everything down except for the food, which is what people are coming there for. No matter how much you embellish mediocrity, it's still mediocre.

As you might have guess, they serve French fare there and they do a pretty decent job at it while keeping the prices reasonable as well.From croque monsieurs ($10.95) and cheese plates to French onion soup ($5.95) and steak frites ($21.95), the selection of dishes is varied. They also have salade Ni\u00e7oise ($11.95), duck \u00e0 l'orange ($24.95) and various other classical dishes such as sole meuni\u00e8re ($21.95) as well. Personally, I'm a sucker for simple, classics like a croque Madame ($11.95) and their onion soup. Their fris\u00e9e salad ($11.95) is pretty solid as well and I've also had their cheese plate ($13.95) which came with a ton of bread, three different cheeses, some fruit and some walnut butter.Not feeling like eating French? Worry not. They also have all kinds of burgers, pasta dishes, salads and many other things. And you can wash it all down with some craft beer, wine or even cocktails.Bonus points to them for serving warm, crusty baguette which is pretty authentic (surprisingly). Being born and raised in France myself, this definitely helps me get a taste of home and while it's not exceptional, for the value and the convenience, I'll definitely take it. I'm a fan."], ["Becky M.", "A spot that has offerings to appeal to many appetites. \u00a0My personal preferred dish is either of the mussels. \u00a0I hear the clam chowder is delish too. \u00a0Otherwise, the menu is what you would expect for a French-inspired menu. \u00a0The food is solid -- not the best place in PVD, but a reliable choice that will please. \u00a0My one significant complaint -- the french fries are (a) shoestring, and (b) always overcooked. \u00a0If I am trying to mop up the broth of my mussels, please give me fries that I can work with! \u00a0An easy and natural spot for before / after a show at Trinity Rep or PPAC -- for a meal, a drink, or dessert. \u00a0The servers are attentive, which includes the bartenders if you are sitting in the bar area. \u00a0They are also prepped to help the theatre crowd. \u00a0 Prices are reasonable. \u00a0If you are a bread eater, the warm baguettes they serve the table (that you get to tear a chunk off of...) are bound to please. \u00a0Enjoy."], ["Hilary H.", "I am so confused by Bravo. It's a beautiful, Parisian-esque spot in a primo location on a block with two of the most stellar restaurants in Providence, yet the experience I had here left so much to be desired. I had high hopes, Bravo -- too high, I guess. I'll say this: the service was excellent. On a night when all my friend and I wanted was to linger over a bottle of wine and chitchat as we nibbled, our server got this loud and clear. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was totally distracting and not in a good way. The French Onion Soup we both ordered wasn't edible due to hard bits of thyme that hadn't rehydrated stabbing our gums with every bite. We brought this up and the soup was taken away. \u00a0Then the cod entree arrived and even though I was ravenous, I couldn't eat it -- the fish was not fresh and the veg were overcooked and mushy. My friend ended up taking it home to her cat. When the bill arrived, the soup was still on it much to our surprise. We asked the server to remove it and she did, but that was an oversight that never should have occurred. I would love to see this place scale back the menu and feature what it's name and ambience imply: French brasserie-style cuisine. The menu is huge and I am sure the selections overwhelm the kitchen. This spot would be ideal for curling up with a great bottle of Bordeaux and a plate of steak frittes.

We requested a different table and it wasn't until we had just started eating our entrees that the hostess offered to move us. At that point, we were so annoyed that we just wanted to eat and get out of there.Then I had a lunch date on a Saturday. The waitress didn't know what kind of sparkling water they had on hand and seemed to shrug it off as if the brand didn't matter. Not a huge deal, but when your patron is willing to PAY MONEY for water, you really should put the effort in to let them know what brand they are buying.My veggie panino (they call it a \"panini\" which is actually the plural form of the word but whatever) was just bizarre. It wasn't pressed and just appeared to be grilled. The veggies had good flavor but were VERY oily and each piece of bread was about 2 inches thick and meant I had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork.

Seats eventually opened up. But there are the hangers-on who likely camp out for the duration to graze upon the bounty.

Actually, it only had one piece - an intact piece of claw meat. \u00a0It was still very tasty and hit the spot on this subzero night. \u00a0I savored a plate of the $1 oysters. Expertly shucked with nary a shell and the liquor intact. \u00a0Simply slurp-able. A surprising, super-duper hit? The salmon skin sushi roll. To me, salmon skin is the bacon of the sea. \u00a0The skin was crispy and nestled inside the tightly wrapped roll. \u00a0So. Good.My husband ordered the crab sliders...and I enjoyed the lobster roll. \u00a0Both entrees came with an order of hand-cut fries which were just the right side of firm, but still crunchy. The crab sliders were actually a pair of fairly large crab cakes on soft, rolls. \u00a0All crab, no fillers. \u00a0They were piping hot, nicely seasoned and cooked to crisp perfection.Lastly, let's talk the quintessential lobster roll. \u00a0A large serving of lightly dressed chunks of lobster served in a classic, buttered hot dog roll. \u00a0My husband noted that the roll was about 2/3 the size of a normal roll...but I am all about the lobster...and my lobster runneth over. \u00a0It was the ideal size for me after eating my sushi, oyster and bisque. \u00a0I think that the Providence Oyster Bar does a great job serving fresh, superb seafood. \u00a0And if you hit the \"appy hour\", you get a heck of a deal as a bonus. \u00a0With a complimentary valet, it's really a treat."], ["nicole c.", "We went here on our honeymoon.

Shown to our table, we ordered drinks and an appetizer (lobster won tons) which were fine. Then it got weird. We asked for some bread, only to be told that, alas, the bread was frozen, but they were \"working on it\" (why such a high-end restaurant would, at any point in time, be only in possession of frozen bread is a mystery to me). As if to compensate, our waitress became painfully obsequious and cheery, another sample of things to come. Then the food arrived: my fried oysters were burnt-tasting; clearly it had been some time since anyone changed the grease in the fry-o-lator. My wife's lobster sandwich was large, but the lobster was tasteless except for being over-spiced. Our fellow guests had decided to split a broiled fish dish, but when that arrived it was so small that half a portion seemed scarcely enough for sustenance, perched as it was atop a gelatinous mound of what appeared to be risotto. It was a disappointing meal overall, and the more so when, after dessert, the waitress became increasingly passive-aggressive, offering us more and more water in an attempt, I guess, to clear the table (though there were still empty ones nearby).

It made it really hard to enjoy the good parts of the experience.They had Downeast cider, my favorite, which was awesome and fairly priced. Wines and cocktails were a bit steep. I had some polenta fries; they were good but not as amazingly good as people have made them out to be. I did really like the garlic aioli though. My friend got the moules & frites and she said that it was delicious but the mussels were shockingly tiny. I might go back and try it another time, perhaps on the outdoor patio, but I was really not at all impressed by my first visit."], ["Rebecca V.", "I go to Loie Fuller's just about every Monday for mussels.

The waitress was nice enough to offer free desert as a result of this issue, which was appreciated. Second was duck breast, came extremely raw. I don't know why the waiter didn't bother to ask how i wanted the breast temped, I would have said mid well as I don't want my fowl trying to fly off my plate. Had to flag the waiter down to get service, he didn't care it wasn't to temp. I had to ask that it was cooked properly but by that point dinner is ruined. Didn't even offer to comp us a drink.

In my mind Swordfish is a meatier choice, but this was cooked light and fluffy. It was imply delicious. Throw on an amazing reduction, some crunchy radishes and crispy potato slices and I'm sold.The ambiance really seals the deal for me.

The atmosphere wasn't exactly inviting. And then the staff wasn't overly friendly... And definitely not attentive. It's been a while since I've been, so maybe it was one bad experience.

There was only one bartender and he was super friendly; we ended up telling stories and joking with each other a bunch.Menu is limited but food was great. Got the shrimp po-boy with fries. The shrimp was delicious and non-breaded, sauce was nice, bread was soft and well toasted. The sandwich was big - if you're not that hungry, you can probably split it. Fries were cooked perfectly.With 2 draft beers, the bill ended up at just under $25... but the po-boy is the most expensive thing on the menu ($10).Overall, I really enjoyed myself.

You know how your parents used to complain about the dim lighting in restaurants as they pulled the flickering candle closer to the menu to see? Well, I never considered myself old until I did that same thing with my cell phone at Lili Marlene's. I get it, it creates ambiance and atmosphere and mystery. But I can't read your food or wine menus or even see what beers you have on tap!Fortunately, I persevered and we ordered a basket of fries, a sausage plate, and a few rounds of drinks. The food menu is limited, but good, and everything is pretty inexpensive. Our fries were plentiful and the sausage was great! I have only ever sat at the bar which is fun -- friendly bartenders and you get to spy on the folks \"on the other side\" in the booths and playing pool from the cover of the shadows.

Service was fine, food was fine, drinks were fine, prices were reasonable. This is a not a 5-star establishment by any means but it's a beautiful, sort of moody, art nouveau inspired bar tucked away from the outside with curtains blocking the windows and everything dark.

A low lit heaven for those looking to listen to a fantastic selection of tunes, yet still carry on a conversation. Lili's is my warm comfortable cocoon in the bar scene of the west end. The waitresses slink out of the darkness to take an order or clear away an empty glass, though on busy nights sometimes it is hard to get the attention of the lone server. Fantastic inexpensive food offerings (though they need to add one other veggie friendly item even if its hummus & cheese on a roll), the fries are always hot and tasty and perfect for a couple (or threesome) to share!

The space is beautifully designed and decorated - although, \u00a0the one restroom opens directly into the dining area. \u00a0Odd.Service, for a restaurant that wants to compete with Dorrance, Gracies, etc al, needs refinement. A statement 'May I clear your plate?' Is a huge difference from 'You still workin'?' I don't drink, but my dining companions were thrilled with the wine list and martinis. Now the food. This is where it's a little rough and needs most work. All of us had the prix fixe 3 course menu. 4 of us had the saut\u00e9ed squid. There were inconsistencies in the food. Two plates with peppers, two without. I wasn't thrilled with my appetizer. Beautifully plated and painted with a squid ink aioli, but tasted more like a cold seviche. It was missing something. ..salt, flavor? A friend loved his lobster bisque, an unexpected and fun version with blood orange. I was much more excited about the second course, the Arctic char. It was cooked well and had a nice crisp skin. The spoon bread was delicious but the squash component lacked seasoning. Another friend ordered the scallop entr\u00e9e and one of her scallops was clearly burned and shouldn't have even left the kitchen....this would have been a deal breaker for me. Desert was fun, both chocolate torte and lemon semifreddo were tasty and light.I want to give Garde de la Mer some time to work out the kinks so that I can return and possibly upgrade my rating.

When the waitress did appear there was no apology for us waiting and seemed annoyed that we wanted to order our drinks right away. The food was average at best, (shrimp cocktail was very good (but for $4 a piece I would hope so) and the calamari was tasty, Chowder, fried oysters and lobster risotto was another story). \u00a0The lobster risotto that stated it was 11/4 lb lobster risotto well I think they forgot to put the lobster in!

I might be being picky here so feel free to comment, but when my fianc\u00e9 asked the waiter what gin they carry, he literally had zero idea. I think he could name Bombay and that was it. He had to go ask the bar tender. To me, when you're at a nice restaurant and spending a considerable amount of money, you should know the gin you carry. I've been a waitress in places that weren't as nice as GDLM and. I always knew the liquor we carried. If we had asked something a bit more obscure that would have been different- but gin??

Every dish we had was excellent in different ways. \u00a0The seasoning and flavor combinations are amazing. One person in our group is vegetarian and also stated that the seasoning, creativity and freshness of the food was outstanding.

It'll be good, taste like what you'd expect, and again, consistent.However, many people assume USDA Prime means \"best\" when it is really just a grading system. I have personally had steaks that were not rated USDA Prime and arguably more flavorful and less expensive than pricey USDA Prime steak here and elsewhere. Chain restaurants often don't carry certain steaks I prefer (like 100% grass fed, locally pastured etc.) outside of the standard industrialized farming process for many reasons, including the fact that it's harder to guarantee consistency. Anyway, like I said, the steak here is good and I suppose it's a matter of preference. I'm sure the vast majority will be happily content with steak that tastes like steak and Fleming's surely has consistently steaky steak.Additionally, I've been to business functions here more times than I can count and have had the pleasure of eating through the entire food menu a few times over. Both the steak and the non-steak options are good, consistent, meets expectations. The service is very good, private dining rooms are available, the valet is convenient and it's an easy choice when you are dining w/ perhaps less food-adventurous people with more traditional palates (especially when you're on an expense account).I'm sure I'll be back, but on my own dime you're more likely to find me at the bar chowing on the great Bar Menu happy hour deals (esp. the burger and aps) because I'm saving my beaucoup bucks for a more creative and inspired menu elsewhere."], ["Christy G.", "I was there last night and the service was horribly unattentive.

This place is perfect for everyone as it offers a full menu of breakfast options for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans. Though I am a meat eater, my friend has been vegan for a while and this place is perfect for us to go to! Typically when I go I always get the traditional eggs benedict which is my favorite benedict I have ever eaten. No joke. It is phenomenal. It is also huge! I always get the half order because of how massive it is. Instead of the typical english muffin, they use a huge slice of fresh italian bread from the bakery next door (at least that is what we were told) and it tastes just as fresh! A huge slab of canadian bacon is placed on top with a perfectly poached egg and a huge helping of hollandaise! The meal also comes with home fries which I strongly advise you ask for extra crispy! They deep fry them and they are simply too good! The atmosphere of the place itself is very funky and fun and gives a different vibe than your normal restaurant. The only real issues I have is that the service is pretty slow considering the size of the place. My friend and I waited almost 20 minutes for a tea and a latte. We didn't even order our food yet. Also, as I typically cannot order eggs benedict without a pancake or french toast, I usually get their chocolate chip french toast and the last few times I have been severely disappointed. They take a huge slab of the fresh italian bread, cut it halfway in half, add the chocolate chips and dip it into their french toast batter (stuff). Then they place it on their oven top to cook. Sounds good right? Well usually it is. Only the last few times I have received it I actually had to send it back because the chocolate chips were still solid a and not melted and the batter they dip it in was still wet and oozing out.

We sat in the back, which has some really cool wall art and the tables have some great antique looking old press stamps in the table. Each table is unique, the music in the room is pretty cool.However, we ran into a little issue with the waitress. Not sure what her deal was but she seemed a little off to the point where she could not be bothered with her customers. We did not get the specials, we were forgotten when trying to place our order. The table next to us ordered, different waiter, received \u00a0food and then was on their way out when we finished placing our order. Even the table next to us , who had our same waitress, had the same issue.The food was awsome! We ordered the Ruben sandwich, which is homemade and very good!

Our waitress did leave us to study the menu but then forgot about us until I had to ask one of the bussers to grab her. Went out of my comfort zone and got a non beer beverage called Teaches of Peaches which is one of their several mimosas on the menu. A bit on the sweet side but tasty and could be dangerous Hash seems to be popular as are Bloody Mary's but I opted for the house made corned beef sandwich which you have to add your sides a la carte. I opted for sweet potato fries and a side of fried pickles because.. Hello fried pickles are freaking awesome. As we waited the couple next to us ordered after and got their food first. What the heck!!!However when our food was finally brought out, our waitresses errors were quickly cast aside. Thick slices of rye enveloping their house made corned beef and ooey gooey Swiss cheese, it was pure heaven. Also loved the pickles (which stayed together with each bite and had a great batter to pickle ratio) but not a fan of their dipping sauce, \u00a0mist were eaten plain or with a dip in the ketchup.

Why would she take me to a bar at 1:30 in the afternoon. The host guy said it was a 35 minute wait. Now I am thinking people out here must start partying early. I looked at the menu and though WTH is hash? I later would find out it is one amazing and delicious dish! It's like hash browns mixed with all sorts of ingredients depending on what you select. The food:I ordered a half size traditional Benedict (spicy bacon) with the Italian sausage hash. She ordered a half florentine Benedict with the same hash. It was freaking soooooo good. I definitely recommend replacing the French fries with the hash (+$4). The lady also got a carrot juice that she enjoyed. She mentioned they always have a juice special that is freshly pressed. Let me make a cost saving suggestion. The portions are huge. We could have ordered a full Benedict and split the dish in two. We ended up throwing away a lot of the hash because it was too filling. Dessert:We ordered a Fig Brown Sundae. It's a honey cinnamon ice cream, red wine glaze, with toasted pecans. It was good and the perfect portion for the two of us. 5 stars.

It was about 20 minutes, even though the hostess said 10 minutes, but that was no big deal. It was when we were seated when I began to regret my decision to bring everyone here.We were seated and a waitress came to our table and she was probably the most uncomfortable waitress I've ever had.

It was only 11:30 in the morning when I went with my sister, but I feel like indulging in some day drinking would have made the experience more tolerable.I had the Bahn Mi Burger because I was excited at the possibility of eating something piled with fresh and pickled vegetables. Sadly, there were only TWO cucumber slices and barely a pinch of shredded carrot & radish. So, after two bites, I ended up eating a sandwich that was composed of just bread, pate, and a dry smooshed down burger patty. Which is definitely not something that evokes the freshness of Vietnamese food.I want to say that if I ever came back here it would be just to have some drinks, but that's probably not going to happen. Also, for $13 you could at least offer fries or some sort of side with your burgers? Maybe?

Service was friendly and never rushed, even though I could tell our server had a boatload of tables. Mimosa was standard but nice. The Buccaneer omelette was abundantly abundant, with a ton of lox, boursin, and an appalling amount of mostly raw red onion. I like red onion as much as the next guy, but this was a bit much. It was tasty, but the Buccaneer didn't make me talk like a pirate or nuthin'. ( Sad \"Yaaaar!\" sound.) Anyway, the toast and home fries were nice, and the homemade ketchup is where it's at.

Good thing we did, when we were leaving around 10-1015, there was a huge wait! Cute little funky place and good food - crazy pez and 80's nostalgic memorabilia in the bathroom! They were even playing morning cartons in the bathroom! Lol.I ordered the Thee Weeping Toreador omelette (avocado, tomatoes, black beans and pepper jack) with a side of salsa for an extra buck. My gf got the tofu scramble special that had broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant and crimini mushroom). Both were absolutely delicious and came with a side of home fries and toast. I had a coffee and she had the special juice - a carrot juice/ginger concoction. No thanks for me but she loved it. Also ordered 1 pancake with banana to share. It's real maple syrup so had a bit of bitterness - I didn't like so much.Our server was a bit lackadaisical and didn't remember some of the specials when I asked but he was nice.

Any shortcomings have been dealt with in a very quick fashion and we have always been made to feel welcome. That said, last month I decided to have dinner there for my birthday. That in spite of there being other more upscale options to chose from in Providence. What a mistake, we came in on a Sat night and found the place half empty rather than full and bustling as has been the case on every weekend in the past. In retrospect, we should have taken notice and gone elsewhere as I was being pressed to do. However I chose to talk my companion into staying. So, we ordered drinks to start, they were good as ever if not a bit on the slow side, but hey the bar was busy that night even if the restaurant was not. Also ordered were an appetizer and soup, along with two entrees. \u00a0Those first two items took over 40 minutes to arrive and while the soup was fine, the appetizer was wrong and needed to be sent back. Now even before the appetizer made it's return, our entrees were delivered with a quick \u00a0\" . . . sorry, the kitchen screwed up. . .\" I asked that my dish be kept in the kitchen as I wasn't ready for it yet (the other entree was a salad and didn't need to be kept warm) So, I assume the waiter just put my dish on the kitchen table, but not kept warm as when i finally did get it back the whole thing was room temp. To make matters worse, the entree which was a special that night was terrible, no flavor, bad textures and appearance. I ate a couple of bites and left it there. Our waiter never came back to find out if we wanted more drinks, or to notice that my meal was virtually untouched. We were not offered dessert and the check was left for us as the waiter rushed by to give some other table bad service. Normally, I'm not shy about bringing these kind of things to the attention of the manager, but it was my birthday and I just wanted to get out of there at that point. Bad food and indifferent \u00a0service is a deadly combo for a restaurant I may try Julians again at some point, but it won't be soon and certainly not for a special occasion."], ["Patricia M.", "Sadly, my friend and I were a bit disappointed with our first visit to Julian's. Neither the food nor the service were very good. Though we did not have to wait to be seated, it took about 10 minutes to place our drink order and at that time it was evident that our server was wanting us to order our meal, too, which we were not quite ready to do. So we quickly ordered an appetizer of the fried pickles. These were ok - but a bit \"under fried\" - the batter on the inside was quite mushy. When the server delivered the pickles (a different server this time) he asked what we wanted for our meal...we were sort of hoping for a brief description of the specials but had to ask. This guy was not in the mood to talk. We ordered the banh mi burger and the fried chicken sandwich special. And we didn't see our server again for about 35-40 minutes. Drinks were left empty until the food came. Both sandwiches were just ok. The banh mi burger seriously lacked the fresh veggies found in a Bahn Mi - there were a few slices of carrot and a lot of cilantro with too many stems. This was served on a HUGE piece of a baguette that was hard and cold making the burger impossible to eat. I \"sawed\" both pieces of the baguette in half to make it manageable. Also, the burger itself, ordered medium rare, was very rare - too rare. I honestly should have sent the burger back but did not want to wait another half hour or more for something else. The fried chicken in the chicken sandwich was pretty good, but again the sandwich was served on a large, cold (brioche style) bun turning this into fried chicken on a plate with a roll. For almost $30 for the 2 sandwiches, which don't come with a side, we expected them to be a bit better. The server never checked in with us to see how everything was - something that should be done with every meal in every restaurant.

Sure there's 6 tubs of butter and 20 egg yolks, but what's life without a little coronary artery disease? They have a very generous selection of eggs benedict choices.

The staff has always been incredibly friendly, Brian (the GM) is the sh*t and knows a ton about beer. My partner and I are getting married next year and we chose Julian's as our caterer. We've been working closely with Brian to carve out a stellar menu, and he's been amazing through the entire process. I'm a big fan!"], ["Kayla O.", "The place was empty at 1030 on a Friday night. We were told to sit anywhere. When we attempted to sit at a booth, one of the workers rudely said we couldn't sit there and we had to move. Great drink choices, miserable staff, if you're not a hipster you may feel a bit uncomfortable."], ["Jenny C.", "Julians is a delightful brunch spot. The only drawbacks are the long wait/ cramped conditions (having a table near the front door would be nightmarish given the crowd of people waiting to be seated) and the price--brunch can easily cost $70 for two people.With that said, however, the service--once seated--was super quick, the waiter was awesome, and the food was amazing. My friend and I couldn't decide on just two entrees, so we shared (devoured) three, two of which were daily specials (turkey hash and a benedict special). We also shared a healthy-sounding vegan pancake that had cranberries and walnuts and a special syrup, and it was delicious. EVERYthing was excellent. I also had a hot chocolate and my friend had a cappuccino, and those were great, too. It was worth the wait and the cost."], ["Gabriel O.", "Julian's is incredibly popular to say the least. I'm a bit of a brunch junky, and I've had people recommend Julian's to me by the dozens. I finally went for brunch, and honestly I wasn't totally blown away. Maybe it was over hyped, or maybe they just make really mediocre French toast. That said, I've also been there for dinner, and although they can be a little pricier than average, they do have great food. Their alcohol selection is nice, as is their location. It is dark inside, but comfortably so. The service has also been consistently good the times I've been there."], ["Marjoline F.", "I like how vegetarian friendly this place is! It wasn't like other restaurants where there may be just one or two vegetarian dishes to pick from-- it was one of those places where we actually had to take our time deciding what we want. We started off with the Pesto and Potato Lavash Pizza, which was an interesting take on flatbread. We then had the Vegan Steak and Cheese Wrap, and the Braised Seasonal Mushrooms. The mushroom dish was probably not worth the price, but I do have to say the addition of lentils and greens made it quite tasty. No complains about the wrap; it was as good as expected. The waiter was very nice and if you get a chance, visit the very decorative bathroom!"], ["Lizz W.", "I don't know how I let this one slip without a review.Wonderful everything.Brunch is my favorite and I love Julians! Best Blood Marys, sweeet mimosa selection, best benedicts, good coffee, freshest ingredients, out door seating, I like it, I like it a lot."], ["Bill D.", "It's weird to start a restaurant review talking about the restroom, but hear me out, because it was the best restaurant restroom I've ever been in... display cases of Pez dispensers and classic Star Wars figures on the wall, a TV playing cartoons (Speed Buggy when I was there), and you don't feel crammed into a tiny stall like some sort of veal critter. \u00a0It was kind of glorious.Luckily everything else was, too. \u00a0The menu wasn't overwhelmingly large, but it was very eclectic, with lots of items among both the apps and the entrees to appeal to a wide variety of tastes. \u00a0A little on the pricey side, but good for a night out or casual sort of occasion.The beer selection, though, was the real draw for me. \u00a0Lots of options both on tap and in bottles, and they wisely offer flights of 4 sampler sizes if you want to taste your way through the draft selections. And the night I went, the bartender was quick to offer quick little splashes of sample stuff if you just wanted a taste. \u00a0She was super knowledgeable and very friendly. \u00a0I probably didn't tip her enough.Anyway, yeah, this is a great place and I look forward to going back."], ["Jennifer D.", "I gave Julians 3 Stars only because of how long the wait can be for brunch on Sundays. \u00a0The food is really good and the atmosphere is very hip/trendy which fits right in on Broadway. \u00a0Great place to gather for brunch, however, expect to wait! \u00a0There have been times where i have waited over an hour to be seated. \u00a0If you are limited for time, i would suggest trying another resturant for brunch. \u00a0if not, you won't be disapointed."], ["Kyle S.", "When it comes to brunch spots in Providence, Julians is a staple among carnivores and vegetarians alike. I enjoy the wide variety of options the menu has, ranging from sweet breakfast treats, to savory and delicious hashes and sandwiches. On a couple of occassions I have enjoyed a few of their different hash combos and they always seem to hit the spot.Besides the food, I also enjoy the diverse beer selection available on draft and in bottles as well. Nothing like sipping on a quality brew while filling my stomach with a delicious meal. As others have stated, this place is a well known brunch destination, so the wait can be a little long most weekends. If you arent in a rush, grab a drink, look over the menu and give yourself a chance to enoy the funky, electic deliciousness that Julians has to offer."], ["Chris J.", "Well I was pleasantly surprised! After a few years of avoiding this place, I stopped in for lunch and the service was fantastic! The food was always good, but in the past the service was downright rude. But this time it was prompt, courteous, and friendly. Even someone who appeared to be the manager was making the rounds to make sure everyone was content."], ["Addison Y.", "Everything is really big portion - true American style. We love the Samwell Benedict - the pork is crispy. Yum! Omelet pizza has an interesting combination - eggs with smoke salmon on naan bread - be careful if you are not adventurous. Hash with Italian sausage - if you like slightly salty - this perfect. Salad is not fresh. Heavy American style. You will have a massive poo poo after this for sure!"], ["Angela I.", "Whenever someone asks me where to go for brunch, I default to Julians, because you can't go wrong with Providence's best Bloody Marys and a funky bathroom with a television that shows old-school cartoons.Seating is, as expected, easier on weekdays than weekends, and it's better to come earlier than later. \u00a0At nine in the morning midweek, you'll typically have your pick of the restaurant, but on a Sunday at 11:30, there's a line down the block. \u00a0The same goes for waiting on food. \u00a0Sometimes, an egg sandwich takes 5-10 minutes, but it can take up to 30 minutes on busier days. \u00a0If you do come on a weekend, have patience with staff (they're friendly and amazing!) and bring a few layers in case you'll be waiting outside. The Benedicts are certainly worth the wait - the eggs are are always poached to perfection and the Italian bread they come on is delicious, with a crust that soaks up hollandaise and melts in your mouth. \u00a0Though you can't go wrong with the traditional Benedict, the variations and seasonal specials are often even better - most recently, the menu featured a pulled pork Benedict finished with BBQ hollandaise and hash with hints of lavender. \u00a0Presentation is always something to behold, yet the complex and complementary flavors make it difficult not to clean your plate.Though they do savory well, I do wish Julians had more of a focus on their sweet side of things - pancakes and French toast are clearly not the main event and pale in comparison to the other options on the menu. \u00a0I haven't been here for dinner and drinks yet, but hear it's fantastic and would love to go back to try their selection of craft beers."], ["Connor B.", "We really wanted this to be good, but it just wasn't...Location and Ambiance:Location is great, its on a strip full of fantastic restaurants. The ambiance follows that with its great vibe!Food:Between the weird flavors, hair in our food (two dishes), and burnt bun on the burger... it just wasn't a good experience. Staff:The staff was average to below average at best. In summary, its about as close to a 1 star meal as you can get... not recommended at all!Thanks,Connor Brady"], ["Bill L.", "Love this quirky place! Food and service is always spectacular! A must visit place when in Providence."], ["Emma W.", "The magic just isn't there for me and this restaurant. \u00a0I know it's a crowd favorite, but the wait for any meal here is LONG, even by Providence standards, and the quality of the food just doesn't justify it, in my opinion.There's nothing wrong with Julian's. \u00a0The food has always been tasty in my experience, but nothing to rave about, in the same breath. \u00a0Julian's is a brunch destination for a lot of folks in PVD, and I understand why. \u00a0They have lots of yummy hashes and the like, and tasty hair-of-the-dog cocktails to go with them.The ambiance at Julian's is unique, to say the least. \u00a0Quirky hipster chic is a good way to describe it. \u00a0It's an interesting place for a meal and some people-watching, for sure. \u00a0All in all, however, Julian's doesn't \"wow\" me. \u00a0For the wait and the money, there are several other PVD brunch spots I'd rather visit. \u00a0But, you can count on Julian's for a tasty meal and a good time, for sure!"], ["Kelsey D.", "I feel the need to update this one again. My life with Julian's is a story of Trials and Tribulations.I've been hesitant to return here after a couple of lukewarm experiences in comparison to the Julian's of old, but the extreme convenience of it being walking distance and the allure of every weird beer I could possibly want drew me back again.I have to say, it's starting to feel more like the place I remember. The food is picking back up. I had a local shrimp, red snapper, and clam paella with a spicy tomato broth and I did not regret it in the slightest. There are more weird and funky variations on the menu that are beginning to remind me of the place where I went \"shit, that sounds different and awesome, let's try it.\" The wait staff and the overall vibe is more comfortable for me again. I never doubted that Julian's was still a Place To Go for non-locals, but for almost a year I felt like an outsider at my own bar and that is disappearing as well. People seem content to be there again, whether it be working or drinking or eating, and that helps.The progression gives me hope that this will be my regular spot again soon."], ["Mandy N.", "Exposed brick and vintage neon. Tattooed and bearded waitstaff. A wide array of coffee-based cocktails, fruity mimosas, and an expansive beer selection, all generously priced. Not to mention, vegan dishes that don't scream \"deprivation\". I got the blackberry lemon pancakes and added pistachios (one of the vegan dishes). The 3 large pancakes came with a large pile of fresh, sweet, juicy blackberries on top, drizzled in vegan whipped topping. Each flavor of the pancakes - the lemon, the blackberry, and the pistachios I had added - came through without being overwhelming, and worked harmoniously together, instead of just assaulting my palate with sweetness. We split a carafe of Pineapple Express, and it was well worth the $24. Both of us finished around 3? 4? glasses, meaning we paid about $3-4 per mimosa. Very easy on the wallet. My only regret is that I couldn't also try the Prodigal Sorcerer, one of their coffee-based cocktails. Next time. We finished the meal with a bowl of their green tea ice cream with sesame. $4 for one scoop, but that's all you need to enjoy the savory, creamy matcha notes. It was perfect. We'll be returning very soon."], ["Eric W.", "I really want to rate Julian's higher. \u00a0It is great that it has been part of the fabric of the neighborhood for so long. The food is always good to excellent. \u00a0The service is just no disappointing just about every time. \u00a0If it is not slow it is unfriendly. \u00a0 It feels like I walk in and a sign is place above my head that I live more than a mile away. \u00a0This most recent visit. \u00a0I ordered a diet coke, after 5 sips it was clearly a coke. \u00a0I asked the bartender if it was coke or diet coke. \u00a0She said coke! Her reply when I said I ordered a Diet Coke? \"So, I will get you a diet coke.\" \u00a0 No care or concern or apology. \u00a0I just wanted some basic customer service. Then I ordered the turkey sandwich special on the blackboard. \u00a0First, she came bak to say they were out of the bread it comes on, then that they are out of the bread she offered to replace it. \u00a0Again, no apology! \u00a0How hard is it to update the black board and change the bread it is served on, or actually checking on what you have before offering it Some basic customer service improvements would make it so easy for Julian's to be a 4 or 5 star experience."]], "Cook & Brown Public House": [["K. Brooke Z.", "Went for breakfast and enjoyed myself but ordered wrong. The chilaquiles were good, don't get me wrong, but I had serious order envy.

Expect big portions and order the potatoes with whatever you get."], ["Ace C.", "Got slow cooked here once too many times. Organization at host stand and among waiters has been majorly frustrating at this place to many times. Most recent time was today for brunch. Waited 30 min after being told 20 min max. At 20 min, tried to find someone to figure out if we'd get seated soon or should just leave and there was no one around to ask. When I found someone, they wouldn't give me answer - was baffling and weird. \"I'll be able to assess the situation after we seat this other party.\" Then, got seated at a table for 2. We were 3. Waiter was MIA most of meal. Took him 10 min to take our order. No bread etc was available to tide us over. Was a totally odd experience at a theoretically legit establishment. Wasn't legit and the it felt as if they opened yesterday. Other than a sorry from the hostess, nothing was done or said to apologize. Food was average (2 meals) to good (1 meal). The one good meal had a salad with too tart-sour dressing and too tough lettuce. Had to spit out an inedible piece of overly tough greens into a napkin. Advice to restaurant: Get organized and you'll be OK."], ["Alishia J.", "Great food and the drinks are even better! I have been coming here since 2011 and I continue to visit for as long as there are bitters to be had. Quite simply, my love of cocktails were born thanks to this place. I came here before going across the street to a special birthday dinner at Chez Pascal. That is when I met Jenn, who is the most amazing bartender ever. I told her the type of drinks I like and she quickly whipped up a concoction so good, i was sad to leave...The first meal I had at Cook and Brown was during Restaurant Week. I had the poutine and Giannone Farm chicken and bread pudding. I swear each course was simply splendid. I came back again the following day! My most favorite food at Cook and Brown is the Smoked Bluefish Fritters. I often order them as my entrees. I love the horseradish sauce that accompanies these fried morsels of heaven. I am truly in love with this place!Though I usually visit for the dinner service, I have gone to brunch on several occasions. I like the brunch items, but I prefer to go in the evening.In the four years we have been patrons, we have met some of the best bartenders Providence has to offer: Jenn, Gillian, and Ryan. The menu changes often, but my fritters have stayed around. I love sitting at the bar and, when it's calm, asking the bartenders to create a drink based on a particular spirit I'm interested in trying. Of course, they usually knock these out of the park. This place gets a solid 4.5!"], ["Alma C.", "Cook & Brown for the past few years has been a third-tier restaurant choice for me that I'd avoided going to because of diffident service, mediocre expensive-for-portion-size food and an average or below average bar depending on the bartender (or mixologist, if you must), despite glowing reviews from many yelpers. However, I've noticed improvement in my recent visits in the kitchen and service and I'm happy to upgrade this review. Currently, I'd say that Cook & Brown is underrated in terms of brunch relative to popular places in my West Side 'hood and it's such a pleasure to be able to just walk in and eat on a weekend without having to wait for a change. The food menu has gotten more interesting with more reasonable portions for cost. For example, I used to get grossed out by small poor cuts of meat in dinner entrees or disappointed by the greasy bar burger special that had on many occasions such an overdose of fat that the bun would fall apart in my hands while I'd eat it. The kitchen's really stepped it up lately and it's nice to see foraged or fermented ingredients and other modern trends represented on the menu. Even the service too has been friendlier than in the past, taking the time to be hospitable rather than just dropping off food and disappearing like I've experienced in the past. I've been happy about the consistency of my last visits over the past year or so and I'm glad to add this spot back in my show-my-visitor's-around-PVD restaurant rotation list. Nice job C&B!"], ["Julia G.", "Had a great brunch here! \u00a0Attentive service. \u00a0First batch of coffee that came out was cold, but once we mentioned it they promptly brought out new coffee. \u00a0Space itself was also a little cold. \u00a0Food was great!"], ["Cristin S.", "Ok so here is the skinny for Cook and Brown. I love it for Brunch. I have visited for both Brunch and Dinner and will definitely be back for my morning meal! For Brunch you walk in and are greeted by cute center pieces with milk, sugar, and S&P. I had the Huevos Rancheros which is great. My sister had the pork sandwich. Both were solid choices. Dinner was still very nice but I would not recommend if you are very hungry. I left feeling a bit hungry."], ["Mark C.", "I promised I would come back after attending a Yelp! Cocktail Party in April, as I did not dine that night!I went Wednesday night for the $20 Burger, Beer and Bourbon special. Wow!!! What a deal! A bourbon on the rocks and a cold Miller High Life on a hot summer night!!!The burger was outrageous.

Just top notch!!Add in great service and a cozy atmosphere and I will be back!!!"], ["Sarah E.", "First of all, the Wednesday night special deserves special recognition. A burger, a beer and a bourbon for $20. If I could enjoy this deal, I would in a heartbeat. My friends love it and I've looked at them enviously.During my last visit, I had the Sort of a Caesar Salad. I'm not a salad person. But this one is very very good. I liked the combination of yummy ingredients that made it a meal on its own. Like any good visit, you must must must try the salted caramel rice pudding. It is AMAZING!!!! I cannot stress this enough. The combination of homemade caramel, whipped cream and rice pudding... it's decadent.Lastly, trust the staff here. They know pairings, mixes, etc. They will not steer you wrong. Every beverage is carefully prepared and served to perfection."], ["Marie C.", "This was the best brunch I've had in Providence so far! The food is wonderful with high quality ingredients, great presentation and taste. Came on a Sunday morning with a group of 5 and was quickly seated. Got the Brunch Salad, which is spinach with apples, goat cheese, walnuts and a honey-shallot vinaigrette .. And I added an \"over-hard\" egg on top.... It was a great light meal. All of my friends ordered something different off the menu and everyone loved their meals. I tried someone's pork belly Benedict and it was to die for!!! And the potatoes that it came with were equally amazing! It also happens to be a popular spot on weekends for doctors (especially post-call residents)- so don't be surprised if you see peeps in scrubs! ... I'll be ordered my own pork belly Benedict next time I'm here.. Which will hopefully be in the very near future!!"], ["Cathy Z.", "I'm surprised this place doesn't get more buzz; I've been twice and it was consistently great. \u00a0The atmosphere is upscale/special without feeling stuffy. \u00a0The service can be a little slow, but between the bread and butter, tempting appetizers, and innovative cocktails, you should be able to get by.Their menu changes a lot based on what's fresh, but some things I have had here and really enjoyed include:-steak and bone marrow (so rich though! \u00a0best to split!)-chicken rillettes with Harissa and a little side salad-saut\u00e9ed shiitake mushrooms with fennel, pea greens, and pomegranate They usually offer a few pasta dishes as well; I recently had baked orecchiette with kale, smoked pork, and citrus ricotta. \u00a0The ricotta was really rich, and the pasta was nicely seasoned, but it was a little one-note--I think next time I'll go for something where the ingredients can really shine, like the cod in a chowder broth."], ["Connie W.", "Came again for brunch, the waiters and waitresses are all very professional and courteous! Loved the new addition to the menu, the beef short rib sandwich. Super tender and flavorful beef, gorgeous colors on the plate with the shaved cuke and radish salad. Only complaint was the dressing erred on a splash too much vinegar, but maybe that was the point - made you crave the beef more. Finished off with bacon ice cream waffle sandwich - perfect to share with three other friends!"], ["Annalee B.", "Gem of a place to eat. The menu is great. Been here at least 10 times and the food never disappoints. I will say the last time I went the service was sub-par. The server came to take our order and said verbatim \" let me go get a pen and paper\". Waited 30 minutes for water and bread. Put drink order in and that took 20 min on a slow Sunday night.Nonetheless I would recommend this place for quality of food."], ["Amy B.", "On my last two trips to Providence, we've fit Cook & Brown into our dining rotation. The menu blends interesting seasonal cocktails, fresh new American dishes, and little regional touches like the inclusion of salted fish into several of their winter recipes.The food and the drinks here are really good. I've found I prefer the items that have multiple components, because they go beyond being well-made to blending interesting flavor combinations. I had an appetizer of fritters with the aforementioned salted fish and a bacon aioli; it was phenomenal.Not all of the food is A+; the rice pudding, which we've had twice, is tasty but odd, more like sweet rice mixed into whipped cream than the traditional preparation. It's good enough for us to finish the serving, but not in lockstep with the phenomenal quality of the appetizers and entrees.On the downside, and this may be a Providence thing, Cook & Brown's crowd dies awfully early. We had 8:30 reservations last time, and the place was bumping when we arrived, but we were the last customers there. And our dinner wasn't especially leisurely. It would be nice to feel like we could linger a little longer over delicious cocktails in this cozy neighborhood haven."], ["Barry N.", "Cook & Brown is a great place to take a date for dinner!You'll be surprised at how filling the small portions really are.

I had been in for a cocktail a really long time ago so I was overdue for another visit. There also wasn't a wait at 11am which helped guide our brunch decision.Cocktails were great - the bloody mary with basil vodka as well as a bourbon, berry and prosecco drink topped the list. Food was awesome - sweet potato cake benedict beat out the BLT and sausage egg and cheese but not by much. That BLT has the perfect combination of flavors to compliment the crisp bacon inside, it's going to be a repeat meal for sure.Atmosphere - the reason I needed to take away a star. It was a frigid day with a mixture of snow and rain coming down outside. How could they not have the heat on? Maybe it was broken but almost every diner in the place had to keep their winter jackets on, that's how cold it was.

My favourite thing to eat here is the pork belly, which comes in a large slab and wiggles down your esophagus in a way that says, \"I'm breakfast! Happy to see you!\" The home fries it comes with have the perfect amount of crisp and crunch.The staff here is impeccable, and not just about refilling your coffee cup, though that's what's important.

What ever you order you won't break the bank and you won't go home hungry! I have have also ordered in the past a roasted chicken dish and a home made gnocchi dish which were both out of this world.

I personally love that their food selection is limited because it helps with making a decision. Don't let the limited menu scare you- it's amazing. What they serve they make well. Quick service on apps was amazing. \u00a0The establishment has a limited number of seats, so get reservations if you plan on going during a popular time. They also serve food at the bar. Highly recommend the steak. Really tasty, and cooked the way I asked. Those of you who order medium rare know the struggle.

The eggs weren't anything to rave about, but the toast was delicious. Orange juice was good too. The ketchup was definitely vegan lol, wasn't thrilled with the taste.

From the outside look of it I thought it looked like a bus station with its sign and a large clock behind it. I noticed there was outside seating which is perfect for summer nights in providence. To be honest I usually wouldn't step foot in a Vegan restaurant because you know I'm a carnivore at heart, but my girlfriend and I were only going here to grab a drink. My girlfriend had been before and she quote on quote said, \"let's go to the grange, they have fancy cocktails\". She also failed to mention it was an all vegan restaurant until I stepped through the doors. The Grange has a great ambiance. With their dim lighting and candles at each table it has a real homey feel. It almost felt as if I was eating in an outdoor garden/patio. For instance, they had long tables with high bar stools for large groups, they had an area with a multiple seat swings, a bar, and they had very quaint seating for those on an intimate date. One thing that did confuse me was the bathrooms because there were no signs or words for men and ladies just a butterfly and what looked like some sort of beetle. Now I figured for males it was the beetle, but in this day and age who the hell knows. It didn't help to see a women come out of the beetle stall and a women come out of the butterfly stall while I was waiting so I flipped an imaginary coin and in I went. The menus were served on clipboards which I thought was pretty cool and they served their water in mason jars and anywhere that provides mason jars to drink out of is fine with me. After looking over the drink menu for ten minutes I decided on the Mariposa and my girlfriend had the Honey Bee. Both were delicious! The Mariposa tasted like tequila, cherry, and lime. Which may not sound like the best combo, but it all works. My girlfriend's drink I forgot what it consisted of but it literally felt like springtime in my mouth. Sounds weird, but just try it and you'll know what I'm talking about. While pondering about drinks we glanced at the starters on the menu and I became very vegan-curious to try some of their food. Like I said before I have never been to a vegan place, but the food looked (after I snuck peaks at other people's food) and sounded great. We decided on the Pomme Frites (which I learned were just a fancy way to say French fries) and the deviled eggs. They were both unbelievable, who would've thought vegan could taste so good. The Pomme frites were served with this aioli sauce that blended well and the deviled eggs were your classic deviled egg with a jalape\u00f1o and shallots on top. I will be returning in the future mostly out of curiosity to try more food and to try more of their unique cocktails."], ["Lonnie M.", "Visiting from wis this place was recommended.

I had room for desert so I asked if they had cheesecake, no, but they had carrot cake. The presentation was great. The cake was ok but the ice cream on top of walnuts made it great. It was a large portion. I had coffee with my desert which was good. The service was good and I like the atmosphere. I think it was a bit pricey but maybe it's just east coast.I will go back to try other items."], ["Mariya H.", "I've been to The Grange 10+ times since first stepping in here in early June... another fact I should add is that I am a New Yorker. I have to say that with every single time I've walked through the doors into this restaurant-- I have never been disappointed. To start with the ambiance- hands down clean, inviting, very \"retro/chic\". It is so spacious, the bar is huge and you can have an intimate table in the back or something by the windows to enjoy watching the occasional people that walk by or the bicyclists. Now on to the food.. what can I say? I've been a vegan/vegetarian for the past 3 years and I thought I had tried it all.. every combinations, every recipe. The Grange has won this time around. From the quinoa to the mushrooms, roasted cauliflower to their amazing soup of the days.. (This is just to say the least) I am always so excited to order and even more excited to eat. I always have my camera ready for the food to arrive so I can snap pictures before my boyfriend attacks the food.. (I guess I have to say the same for myself). One of my favorite dishes is the quinoa salad topped with saut\u00e9ed tofu steak.. My god it's to die for. Always mention that you want the tofu steak added-trust me its worth every bite. I am not that big of a tofu fan but the way they glaze it with a hickory sweet bbq glaze just makes me want to eat it slowly so I can savor it as long as possible haha! My SO usually gets the Po boy or the poutine (make sure you get it topped with a sunny side up egg) to maximize your eating experience! The pomme frites are also my favorite- so simple yet so deliciously flavored and spiced! I can go on forever. The staff is friendly and courteous. One time I forgot my credit card on the table after signing and I was already 1/2 a block down the street when I hear \"missss, missss\" having no idea it was for me but turning around to see what the commotion was about and I see my waitress chasing after me with my credit card. I felt so \u00a0thankful to her, my god I wanted to hug her. I highly recommend this place. In Friday nights they have live music and the environment is am defiantly very cool to be in!"], ["Ashley M.", "This is our absolute favorite place for brunch!! We can't help but order our favorite thing every time we go there and that is the hash and eggs with hollandaise. I have also had the tex mex omelette which is great too. The green juice is is another fave!"], ["Rachel R.", "Chicken-fried oyster mushrooms... vegan food so good it's got two animals in its name. Get yer chik'n fried oyster shrooms in the Biscuits N' Gravy, because this pulled mushroom gravy and (not)butter(not)milk biscuit combo will make your ham-gnawin', dairy-guzzlin' daddy cry. Even if this wasn't the best-decorated establishment ever (which it is), I'd be throwing stars like a ninj. The Grange makes the most expertly crafted, high-quality, cohesive, vegan-be-damned vegan food I done dare ever did taste. P.S. - No matter what you do, NO MATTER WHAT, order ALL the desserts. Do NOT screw this up."], ["Shelley R.", "Two words: eat here! \u00a0Especially if you're a vegan or vegetarian. \u00a0Different flavors that don't work on paper came together perfectly over the three courses we tried; curried squash and broccoli soup, then Asian tacos, then pumpkin brownie with ice cream and caramel - all delicious and decadent! \u00a0Impeccable service and a cool setting... six stars if we could give them!"], ["Angela I.", "I feel like I have to start this review by admitting that I'm not a vegetarian, but I truly think I could hack it if not for my continued love affair with bacon. That being said, The Grange succeeds as a vegetarian restaurant for eaters of all kinds because you never find yourself thinking, \"This is okay, but it'd be fantastic if I could just add pulled pork.\" \u00a0Rather, the carefully prepared and beautifully presented dishes stand alone. The Grange doesn't rely on faux meat products to convince its guests, but instead offers dishes which are both seasonally inspired and sourced from local farms and creameries. My go-to dish when I dine here, particularIy for lunch, is the poutine. Although The Grange doesn't follow the traditional recipe for the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois standby, they currently make the hottest fries, gravy, and cheese in the Greater Providence Area. The plate begins with a mix of hand-cut, lightly seasoned pommes frites and thinly shaved potato skins. The gravy that's poured on top uses mushrooms rather than a base made with pork/veal/chicken/some other animal, but the flavour profile is out of this world. Finally, it gets topped with cheese (no curds, but still creamy and delicious) and chives. The portion is large for one person and could probably be split if paired with one of the restaurant's rotating offerings of soup or braised greens. The cocktails on the menu will cost you a pretty penny ($9-$12), but they're stiff and feature unique names and flavour pairings. \u00a0The Royal Mint Swizzle Swizzle, for instance, combines Edinburgh gin, creme de cacao and lemon. When I'm on lunch break, I usually stick to one of The Grange's many non-alcoholic options, like the refreshing homemade sodas.The rustic-yet-modern decor and cozy ambience make this West End staple perfect for brunch, a dinner date, or a midday business meeting. Grab a few people, sit down, and return to those abandoned-but-not-forgotten dietary values you had while watching the film Babe."], ["Ray M.", "Every single time I am in Providence I go here. Usually I stop in to get some of the baked goods they have in their cafe which is attached to the restaraunt. I can't get enough.... Seriously the choices are so delicious and vary a lot. I have tried their oatmeal cranberry chocolate cookies, pb chocolate cookies, pumpkin muffins, poppyseed muffins, cranberry orange scone, chocolate lavender scone...and my favorite of all time the \"cheddar\" jalape\u00f1o scone which is more of a biscuit and it is the best thing I have had in a long time. I have also been here many times for brunch,lunch and dinner. I have never been disappointed and am always satisfied. This is my favorite restaurant in RI."], ["H C.", "Way too expensive.Nice food; not stellar. Nice service; not stellar. You don't get to charge that much, Grange. People can eat cheaper and better in any major city in America."], ["Cathy S.", "I really liked the rustic feel of this restaurant and the creativity of the dishes, though I felt like the dishes that I ordered were too heavily sauced. I shared the roasted cauliflower which had a nice spicy and bold flavor, and while I would recommend the dish, I felt like the main taste I got was the sweet chili sauce and all of the other components didn't really add to the dish as much. For my entree I got the General Tso's tacos, and here there was definitely too much sauce for me. The dish as a whole was pretty salty because the seitan was covered in the sauce and I felt like it drowned out some of the other taco fillings. The guacamole was perfect, but overall the flavors of the dish were not balanced. Some of the other menu items looked good though, so those may have been better options. PS The bathrooms are marked by a butterfly for women's and a beetle for men's, which was confusing to me."], ["Neil B.", "To motivate me to write that I was impressed with a vegetarian/vegan restaurant is not an easy task because I love meat! But today, while visting RI, I lunched here with my mom and was very impressed! The restaurant's atmosphere is a bit hipster. $3.50 each for our ice teas (with no refills) was a bit steep but the food was amazing (if you like spice and I do)! I had read about the Korean BBQ tacos so those are what I ordered and they lived up to their delicious reputation ~ full of flavor! My mom ordered the crispy tofu bowl which was a bit spicy for her but I tried it and loved it! I didn't feel full after the tacos but the tofu bowl was enough to fill up just about anyone. We wanted to try their unique ice cream flavors but their freezer was broken, so that will have to wait until our next visit.Finally I would also like to thank the server behind the takeout counter who chose today's 60's & 70's R&R background music which was a very appreciated plus!"], ["Oki P.", "Came here for lunch and this is seriously the best Vegeterian \u00a0restaurant i have ever been to.

Keep showing up and eventually they get used to you, right?After a few less than dazzling summer experiences (chronicled in past reviews) I have had more pleasant and attentive experiences in the colder weather. The first time that had me warming up a bit more to the Grange was a night for drinks.The bartender definitely took time to explain some drinks to me, and to assess the situation (so to figure out if this was a date and if he was going to have to interject when things looked awkward) and then let us be once he realized he wasn't going to have to babysit people that might have met on okcupid.More recently I got dinner with a fellow yelper, who just happens to have a severe nut allergy. This immediately made our server snap to attention, and pay particular attention to us, and come back and forth with the chef's questions and concerns. The Grange is still a quite different beast then Garden Grille. Different feel, different cocktail vibe, etc.The food here is a bit more, adult and seems like the menu gets a bit more varied. Again I stuck with the oyster mushroom po boy, and was dazzled. I was a bit saddened that the coleslaw presented to me this time around was simply green cabbage and was a bit more mayo laden than i would have likes. THe po'boy though.

I came here on a Thursday evening with a friend's family. It definitely has a hipstery sort of vibe- rough wood surfaces, clipboards and faux-typewriter font. And as soon as we were seated, the super-chill waitress let us know that if we gave up our cell phones for the duration of the meal, the meal would be 10% off. Personally, I love it when restaurants do quirky stuff like this to add an experimental element to the dining experience- and it was a great idea! I now put my phone deep in my bag when I'm out with people so I'm not tempted to glance down at it every 15 seconds.Anyway, the food- was divine! I had never thought of fresh vegetables as a main course before. I'm a student, which pretty much means I microwave some frozen kale to go with dinner to avoid constipation/scurvy/malaise... so this mushroom dish I had at The Grange was a pretty religious experience. All the herbs were blended just right. The mushrooms were cooked just until tender. The food satisfied me completely but I didn't feel at all bloated. When was the last time a restaurant meal did the same for you? This is what it's like to be properly nourished, I thought, it must be. From that day forward, I delighted in buying mushroom mixes at the grocery, adding some red wine, lots of pepper, and a mix of herbs... it's my favorite thing. I can't wait to come here again!Definitely make a reservation if you're coming on Friday or the weekend! It gets pretty packed."], ["Jeff P.", "I am not a vegetarian of any sort - far from it I admit. \u00a0But I love and appreciate good vegetarian food. \u00a0The Grange is a place where you can get VERY GOOD veggie food. \u00a0 We started off with the Cheese Plate - fantastic selection of excellent cheeses, hard and soft, spicy and sensuous and complimented it with crispy Pommes Frites, a fancy way of saying French Fries and they were both fancy and fantastic. \u00a0Excellent beer, wine and drink menu (so good I can't remember what I had!) \u00a0For dinner we split the Korean BBQ Tacos and the Po' Boy. \u00a0Both were A-MAZE-ING! \u00a0I think we had dessert, but I don't remember what (see note about drink menu. \u00a0Also note I was staying with a friend within walking distance!) \u00a0 A bit pricey for us ($$$), but we had decided to enjoy without a close eye on the price tag. \u00a0I'm sure you can have a filling and phenomenal meal for half ($$) of what we splurged on."], ["Eva A.", "All-time favorite place.

I love that there is a juice bar connected with smoothies and other fresh items - I wish they had more of a selection but I am sure they will be working on expanding the menu as it becomes more established the demand for fresh juices in Providence increases. The juices are amazing - I consider myself a person who knows juice very well and the Red juice is one of the best I've ever tasted. I LOVE all of the breakfast/brunch items on the menu. Brunch is my favorite meal here even though everything is great. The cauliflower is an amazing choice for an appetizer and the quinoa salad is so yummy if you need a quinoa fix.

We then learned that he had failed to place the order. \u00a0Our drinks arrived shortly thereafter.

It comes with either salsa or guacamole, which were both freshly made. I didn't use the additional side sauce until my last bite because it had more than enough flavor and sauce originally. The best taco ever. Every taco should be like this. Carrot dog - it's literally a full stick of carrot! The pretzel bun is super salty along with the BBQ sauce. I wads plucking off the salt on the bun and it was still too salty. I'm assuming they wanted to overpower the carrot taste. I think the side chips were made in house too because of the texture and color. Mushroom frittata - it's basically an omelette with mushroom and spinach accompanied by bread and butter on the side. Mango smoothie - its thick, creamy, cold, and it tasted like a green ginger dressing from Japanese restaurants!

We'd been to the first 2 but not the third. Then we met Carlo at a local event. We really liked him and made the decision to give this 3rd restaurant a try. That was back in the end of Feb. Well last night we finally made it there, poked along by a Living Social deal which gave us $50 to spend for a $25 charge. Our meal, one appetizer to share, two mains, one glass of wine and 1 dessert cost an additional $45. So for Providence, it is definitely on the pricier side, but the food was divine and the experience worth it. It would be possible to order less expensive menu items, but there was no way I wasn't going to try the seared tune special. My husband had the duck 2 ways. He loves duck. He grew up in the finest French restaurant in Chicago. Nobody makes the duck of his youth. He adored this duck and that is saying a lot. It was cooked perfectly. Carlo came over and sat with us for a few minutes. He remembered us which made us feel good. We asked him why the calamari didn't have any tentacles, our favorite part! (The rings we nice and meaty and juicy.) Apparently, Carlo said we are the odd ones, as most people don't like the tentacles, so they don't serve them.

It's a place just about everyone will love. I've been to CIrce many times and have always enjoyed the great wine list, the friendly and attentive staff and, most recently, one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time. What blew me away about this meal wasn't just the exquisitely prepared duck confit ravioli in a velvety yet light sauce. It wasn't just the brilliant, fresh and bright local oysters topped with a pleasingly acidic minionette. I absolutely loved every morsel of the pan-seared ahi tuna atop the unusual and bold beet risotto that pared perfectly with the recommended Pinot Noir, but it wasn't that, either. It was the fact that this meal took place on Valentine's Day, and nothing -- not one single element of the event -- was the least bit out of place. There was no rushing, no scrambling, no beat missed. I haven't seen that anywhere else ever on Valentine's Day. Have you?What makes Circe so special -- aside from the delicious food, gorgeous ambience and expert staff -- is that all together, everything creates a magical element I've not seen elsewhere in this city. Every piece and detail of Circe is executed perfectly yet warmly and without a hint of pretension. It's graceful and lovely and comforting all at once. Whether it's for drinks at the bar, a lingering brunch with bottomless mimosas or a romantic dinner for two, Circe doesn't miss a beat. Go for a meal, but just know that the space turns a bit clubby after hours. And if you can, snag a table upstairs -- it's quite lovely!"], ["Queenie L.", "I've been to Circe for couple times and they are just getting better and better. \u00a0Our last visit was Yelp Elite Event hosted there and we had a blast! \u00a0The service was top notch!! All the servers there were extremely helpful, friendly and yet sincere!! I like their vibe!! We stayed a little longer after the event was over, we wanna order food at the bar however it was packed and we were debating what to do, the manager was very helpful, he recommended a great dish for us and managed to find us seats when the food arrived! How awesome it is! We ordered the 16oz hereford sirloin with seared bomster scallops on top of the truffle mashed potato. \u00a0A good dish to share by 2. \u00a0The steak is very lean but the truffle oil gave it a kick, brought the favor to a different level. \u00a0Plus they are thoughtful enough to preslice the steak for us, no messy at all! Love the bar service!! We asked them for recommendation for wine, they poured us couple samples to try. \u00a0They provided excellent service even thou it was a busy night!"], ["Linda F.", "The owner is s super nice guy. The wine list is just ok. By the glass it's catch as catch can. Not impressive or appealing if you're going for a white. I had the honey carrot salad which was a little bland so I didn't finish that. Followed up with a slightly boring charcuterie. Prosciutto. Really\u2049 I've been spoiled by Local 121and that's all too it. Good music and good service. Next time I'll try regular entrees. That may be the way to go. I will definitely give them a 2nd try.

Kevin was our waiter and \u00a0was fantastic. \u00a0Friendly, funny and attentive. \u00a0The food was great, \u00a0the mimosas were good, \u00a0and Kevin brought over a birthday desert -- an amazing chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream -- for my sister. \u00a0The wine list was good, \u00a0and we were enjoying the place so much we decided to get a bottle after the mimosas.

We wanted to go to a nicer restaurant and I really wanted some charcuterie and based our restaurant choice on who looked to offer a good selection. Boy did we choose correctly! Our server was very helpful and informed us that the board for 1 was plenty for us to share, especially if we were having entrees also. So thankful we took her advice, the board was beautiful, \u00a0plentiful, and a crazy deal at $12! So many tasty tidbits that we couldn't even finish all of it!I went with the spring vegetable carbonara, as a meat lover I usually won't go for the vegetarian options but the pasta just sounded delightful. The thick fettuccine had such a great texture and the vegetables were delicious. The husband opted for the duo of duck and loved both ways his duck was prepared.Service was fantastic and I loved that you were not rushed. We were able to take our time with our charcuterie board, I hate it when you are halfway into your appetizer and your meal arrives. It was wonderful to leisurely enjoy our meal but our server was also very conscious of our show time and made sure our bill was taken care of promptly. Bonus was that we got a discount because we were going to PPAC afterwards, that was an awesome surprise! Also overheard another table being told that they were welcome to leave their car with the valet at Circe and pick it up after the show, good to know for the future!"], ["Jamey B.", "After attending the Yelp event I had to come back here for a full dinner. The food and service were truly outstanding. We went for a birthday celebration for a party of six. I had made reservations for 8pm, we were on time and promptly seated. Around the table we had oysters, beef tartare with a quail egg, truffle fettuccine, lamb meatballs, and ceviche for appetizers. A few of us did family style and shared. I tasted the fettuccine and meatballs, which were both rich and well seasoned. Next time I go I am NOT sharing the fettuccine. For mains we were meat heavy. My husband's surf and turf (lobster and steak) looked awesome. My bacon wrapped tenderloin (medium rare) on polenta was perfectly cooked and delicious. Pork three ways was really neatly presented though I didn't get to taste it. The server was good with recommendations when we requested them but didn't push anything. There are enough amazing flavors on the menu to keep tempting me to come back. Delicious!"], ["Hamov Lady G.", "Everything about our experience was wonderful! Food, service, atmosphere. Whole family enjoyed it!"], ["Kay P.", "Because I am such a nice daughter, I pick up my mom from work on nights that I can and we always find a new place to grab a bite. Of course we are always looking for a nice place that has a great deal. This isn't easy and it reminds me of apartment hunting, almost everything you want but you always have to sacrifice something. Circe was different which was refreshing...We walked in and it wasn't too crowded, just a few after work regulars it looked like. There was samba music and everything in there was white. The white marble bar, white leather bar chairs, a white staircase that lead to more white tables. It was so clean and bright looking. We tried a few apps like the duck confit pizza with goat cheese and fig jam, and angus beef sliders. Both were half price because we caught the happy hour special. They had loads of other options that were awesome also, that's how they get you to come back! The bartender was really friendly and made good suggestions for the apps, it was really hard to choose. I will definitely be going back to Circe to try more food and soak in that bright white, high ceiling atmosphere."], ["Alexander V.", "Came here for brunch around 10AM. Ordered the chicken waffle meal but was told they don't make waffles until another hour later and that they can make pancakes instead. Ordered an orange juice and was surprisingly displeased to find out it was just tropicana or some store bought juice. When I got my food I was more surprisingly displeased to find out that the fried chicken was just fried chicken tenders that were dry and tasteless. Good thing the waitress offered ketchup and now I know why. Other than that the service was smooth but there weren't much people in. Definitely not the place to come for chicken and waffles."], ["Joe H.", "Just wanted to say that I left my jacket here on a weekend night that had my wallet and everything there.

Very good for a business or friendly lunch. The steak open face sandwich was awesome. The mayonnaise side with fries was fantastic."], ["Jen M.", "Great place! Great food! Treat their customers right! Me and my fianc\u00e9 went there for our anniversary. they brought him out the wrong plate, the manager immediately came over with a complementary salad for my fianc\u00e9 to eat while I ate my meal. Then they brought his meal over within 5 minutes. Great customers service! we will be back!"], ["Jessica S.", "I was here with a group of 8 a couple weeks ago. I tried the Carlos Way with a side of sausage. The sausage is really good and enough to share with someone. I also got the yoghurt with fruit and granola. The presentation is nice, in a martini glass. It was good but needed a bit more yoghurt. These creations can be a bit dry without enough of it. My friends also all liked their food and especially love the bottomless champagne. The manager came over to chat with us and was very nice. This a good place for a group. The only negative was the coffee was not very good, weak. meh."], ["Caitlin B.", "Went for lunch and the food was pretty good -- though my fries were a little cold (& too hard/ crunchy for my likes) Honestly wish there was a small parking lot because there is limited street parking. would recommended this place!

The space is really great looking. Lots of white, marble and fun little touches. The upstairs dining area feels crowded and has a few tables up on a step above overlooking the bar and street. Came here as a party of two and we were seated a great-looking little table on the second floor overlooking the bar and the large outside window. Seemed awesome but once the restaurant got busy every time the door opened we got hit with a blast of freezing cold air. 20 minutes into our \"meal\" (I use air quotes because we still hadn't even gotten our drinks yet) we were both back into our winter coats. After another 20 min we finally ask to move. Our waiter had noticed the coats and pointed out how cold it was but chose not to offer us a different table 10 minutes beforehand which irked me to no end. The service and kitchen were insanely slow. When all was said and done it took my husband and I two hours for our 3 course meal. It was over 45 minutes between finishing dinner and being served dessert. Yikes. I have to say, the food was delicious. My husbands lobster bisque was delicious and the desserts were to die for. Management was understanding regarding our complaints about time and did take 25% off the bill in response. Overall- I don't think the wait was worth it or the space was well used. We won't be going back."], ["Rob S.", "Another unbelievable great restaurant in downtown Providence. Food, atmosphere, staff and wine selection!!!!!, all truly outstanding. Carlo opened a great place, and I highly recommend to everyone to at try this place. I know Providence has multiple great restaurants; Prime 10, XO, Local 121, Gracie's to name a few, but this place is equal to all of them. I travel for my job, Washington, NYC, Boston, LA and for a city the size of Providence, I do not think you can find a better selections of great locally owned restaurants anywhere else."], ["Max F.", "Food was OK. There are way better places to dine in Providence. Trust me.The owner was rude as soon as we walked in.Didn't bother making eye contact or acknowledged half of the dinner party.

The drinks are really just too good. Like I haven't been that sick the next day since my 21st birthday good. The bartender was so nice and attentive. The bar was jam packed but he was right there when you needed a drink (or some water). The hibiscus martini was amazing. I basically go for anything with Elderflower (because well its the most delicious thing ever) and this drink did not disappoint! I also had the Shiso martini and that was a delicious cucumber minty delight. As Saturday night wore on it got pretty stuffy in there, if you can score at least one or two seats at the bar though you will be fine to just crowd around those seats."], ["Holly S.", "Please note that this is a review for desserts and ambiance only as my husband and I stopped in here Saturday night for a nightcap and dessert. The place was hopping and we were lucky to get two seats at the bar (people were politely waiting for us to leave to take our seats by the time we were done). I saw a young woman drinking a Busted Nut which is a \"young Dominican coconut\" filled with several types of run, coconut water, pineapple juice and coconut and mango puree. I want to go back and have that simply because it looked so good. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered because it is so much bigger than we had expected. It is long and narrow and has a second floor that is stunning. The decor is beautiful and the crowd is young and smart-looking (I can't say the same for us but they treated us nicely despite that). Since I refuse to ever share a dessert, we each ordered our own. My husband had a smores dessert: a small molten chocolate lava type cake with a side of melted marshmallow that sat atop a graham cracker crust. I know it was heavenly because I tried it (yes, while I don't share, he has to, the poor guy). I had the bread pudding which is served with a generous serving of frozen pumpkin mousse. The pumpkin flavor was there but was not overpowering. I drenched it all in the maple creme anglais that came along with the dessert. Great atmosphere, beautiful space, delicious desserts. I'm intrigued and we'll be back the next time we need a special night out sort of dinner."], ["Ian G.", "This is a long-awaited review! \u00a0Was here for Valentine's Day dinner 2015. \u00a0I called a couple days prior to Valentines Day and spoke with the owner who was incredibly kind! \u00a0I immediately felt welcomed before I stepped into the door! \u00a0The complimentary valet parking was much appreciated, since there was a snow storm ALL DAY on Valentine's Day, and my car does not handle well in the snow. \u00a0The terrifying journey to Circe was worth it! \u00a0The interior is modern and gorgeous and features an open kitchen, which I was lucky enough to be seated next to. \u00a0The music was contemporary and created a chill and upscale vibe. \u00a0The calamari was awesome! \u00a0Definitely a favorite! \u00a0I will absolutely be revisiting Circe Restaurant & Bar once I come back to Providence!"], ["Piper P.", "We drove down from Boston for my birthday dinner on MLK day; it was a very quiet night at the restaurant. We started with martinis (Hibiscus Martini and Shiso Martini - their signatures) and crab cakes at the bar and worked our way to our table. Our server was wonderful, as was the second server who was on for the night, Kevin. A recent graduate of Johnson and Wales, we absolutely loved him! We ordered Mussels and corn on the cob as appetizers. My girlfriend ordered the bacon wrapped hereford tenderloin (w/crispy polenta, portobello mushroom, red onion marmalade, parsnip chips, and horseradish cream. I ordered the 16oz hereford sirloin (rare) with seared bombaster scallops (truffle mashed potato, saut\u00e9ed local spinach). We would only hint that perhaps listing vintages on the wine menu would enhance the customer experience (and keep the waitstaff from having to search for vintages). We had a pleasant \u00a0Rioja, but they certainly could do so much more with the extensive wine selection they offer; it was \"safe\" but not outstanding. The food: honestly, I can't remember the last time I've had a sirloin that perfect. The bombaster scalloped were grilled to perfection, and the sirloin was sliced and resting over a subtle bed of simply incredible truffled mashed potatoes with spinach. I can't believe I ate as much as I actually did (we did take a good portion home; I can't imagine being able to eat that much sirloin). We ordered cappuccino and espresso with house made donuts for dessert, but the kitchen actually put together a plate of three desserts for my birthday with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate. The presentation was beautiful and thoughtful. I eat out regularly, and this was, without a doubt, the best dining experience I've had in every regard in a very long time. Aside from being with the perfect dining partner on a special day, the atmosphere at Circe is warm (for a very modern space), the waitstaff attentive and friendly, the food top-notch, mixed drinks outstanding. We were never rushed at all; in fact, we were encourage to relax and enjoy every aspect of our meal. We did."], ["Elizabeth W.", "This was our first time here and I promised the manager I would be fair and honest...First impression, we loved the decor! We were there for dinner and did not stay for the club atmosphere. It was dimly lit with white woodwork and blue accents- very nice. We were initially bummed about being in the back where there was only one other couple but, it ended up being perfect- away from the larger groups and noise.We got a few little things rather than 2 big meals. The Angus sliders were tasty but maybe sightly lacking in blue cheese. But, I like ALOT of sauces/toppings so, maybe that's just me. The lobster risotto with avocado ice cream is ridiculous! I was nervous about the ice cream but the cold, sweetness it provided combined quite well with the dish and the lobster was cooked perfectly. We also got the chacutterie which had all high end meats and cheeses but not enough cheese compared to meats. They have these tiny pickles that I wanted to take home and chicken liver pate that surprises the taste buds.Good wine, whiskey and after dinner coffees. The staff was courteous and all smiles. The valet is helpful in this area too. We look forward to returning!"], ["Jacob B.", "My wife and I wanted to try a new place and we found some great review about Circe... which caused some shock when we arrived, because it was relatively empty. The bar was almost full with seemingly a post-work (Thursday) cocktail crowd, but only one or two other tables with guests dining.The service was fantastic, the food was delicious. We had the grilled pizza and beef tartar, which were both phenomenal; and a meatball appetizer that I wasn't a fan of because of the spices, but my wife was the one who ordered it, and she loved them.The owner even stopped by to check on us and showed a clear passion for his restaurant, which is always refreshing.

Got the side of potatoes with the dill sour cream which was very tasty but I felt it was more pub style food and didn't really go. Had a nice bottle of sparkling wine, Veuve du Vernay, cheap and delicious! They were out of the one we originally wanted but it was a pleasant change.

I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. They have a quiche of the day and crepes of the day which are always so intriguing along with their regular menu. This past time when I went in, I got the crepes which happened to be chicken with apples, walnuts and Brie cheese with a white sauce over them that I can't really remember what it was called. They were unbelievable. It came with Brussel sprouts and roasted potatoes on the side. I could have had a whole second helping of just the potatoes they were so delicious. My friend got the coq au vin and she was barely talking during dinner because it was so good.You get a salad beforehand which comes with a choice of two homemade dressings.

Another server bumped into me 3 times, stepped on my foot and knocked over my water. All forgiven though as it was a little comical.My first course was ok. The maison pate. No complaints, \u00a0not blown away either. Then the dreadful hellish hour passed until we received our entrees. Our server ignored us during this time and offered no explanations or apologies. 5 other tables entered the restaurant and finished all 3 courses by the time ours finally came. I have never walked out before; this time I nearly did. Second course steak frites. Steak was over cooked (should I send it back? It wasnt worth another hour). The frites are the same fries you get at McDonald's. \u00a0I watched the chef, over and over pour frozen fries from a food service bag into the fryer. Further disappointment. The dessert course was nearly inedible. A fruit crepe. Fruit? It was full of chocolate mouse and drenched in a simple syrup. Maybe this was just a bad night and maybe my server \u00a0was having personal issues. I will give pot au feu another chance....but my hopes aren't high.

Nothing on the menu mentioned that they were half white and half sweet (which I detest) nor did she mention that fact when we asked about the potatoes. Plus not a shred of dill in sight.I ordered the duck $32 for breast \"on the bone\" and leg confit. The breast was well done - yuck! Further it was obvious that it had been microwaved. It was so hot that I couldn't eat it for a while. Nothing comes out of the pan to the table and remains that hot for 5 minutes unless it's from the microwave.

The upstairs dining room, where we unfortunately ate, was the singularly shabbiest restaurant space I've ever been in, and not in the annoyingly hip shabby-chic way either. It just looked worn out, tired, and very dated.The menu was a relic from 1978. There was absolutely zero effort put into anything, from specials, to desserts. The waitstaff looked like they were suffering from severe ennui and were woefully ignorant of basic French pronunciations. Inexcusable. Our food was a disaster. Overpriced, clumsily prepared and artlessly served. Seriously, there was not one redeeming thing about our meal, except that it ended and we left, never to return.This is an insult to real French food. I've been to France, as well as a number of other wonderful countries. To claim this is French food is laughable.

The bread, while still not where it could be, is better. Anyone who knows the crunch of a dense, French peasant loaf understands this. With pates and soups incoming, good bread is a serious requirement.2. The Blue fish pate is excellent; light, rich and not overpoweringly fishy. Ample toast if you care to share it.3. The salad greens are appreciated but a little one-dimensional. It may be \"traditional\" but at close to $30 per entree I think we can forego any illusions of simple \"peasant fare\" here.4. It's too expensive. Chez Pascal has a better angle on truly seasonal French country eating and nothing there is priced over $28 (though it, too, is guilty of overpriced, undersized starters). The super simple Steak Frites is $19, if that tells you anything.I did enjoy the Poulet Farci special (chicken breast stuffed with cherries, almonds and brie), and my wife never misses the cassoulet, but at these prices it's difficult to just sit back and take in a meal. I've also had the Porc Normandie; quite good, but nothing to write home about.We come to Pot Au Feu every now and then for its comfortable French food, but the prices can make it feel like a Paris tourist trap.It's a \"bistro\" and we're on the dollar, not the euro!"], ["Lucy G.", "(pics posted) \u00a0 Went here for restaurant week and Its a nice place.

I couldn't believe that my family members who live hours from Providence visited before I did. So after seeing them recently and they once again told me that I had to try it out, I knew exactly where to treat myself to for my b-day. The menu is so classically french and perfect that I struggled to narrow down the options to just one. We settled on the country pate to start....umm, Yum!! I could have eaten so much more of this and with a whole loaf of their warm crusty bread. The pate was studded with just the right amount of liver. We next split the beef a la bourguignon and steak frites with bernaise sauce. It was a beef kind of night! Both were perfectly cooked with the most delectable sides. The bernaise was heavenly! As if we weren't stuffed already with great food and tasty wine, I knew I couldn't pass up dessert! My husband ordered the cassis sorbet on special and I had to try the vanilla mousse. The name doesn't even describe the amazing flavors. The texture of the mousse was so light and etherial it just melted in your mouth. The caramel sauce and toasted almonds were a night contrast in texture.

I also ordered a side of potatoes which were sort of like home fries, chunks of sweet and russet potatoes, quickly fried and dusted with something like crack... because I have NEVER had a sweet potato like this before. Without a doubt, the best potatoes I have ever eaten. Sadly, I had no room for desert, but will plan to go back and try several, as the first 3 items listed sounded wonderful.

Apparently there is a more formal section on the main/top level that is open for dinner, but since we came for lunch we dined downstairs in the casual section.I absolutely loved the exposed brick and red paint in here, it makes the place feel so homey and inviting, and you can just tell you're about to get a meal made with care. The room littered with disposed wine bottles and Beaujolais Nouveau casks is also a nice addition for someone who's wine obsessed like myself. It looks like there have been some fun parties here, and I'm sure many more to come.The lunch menu is a relatively basic offering of many French classics, such as crepes and croques, along with a few others like cassoulet and quiche. The prices here are pretty phenomenal in my view, considering the level of preparation required for some of these dishes as well as the quality of the food served. Almost everything on the lunch menu was under $10, and most of it comes with a salad too.I decided to be a pawn on this day, and be at the mercy of the chef, trying both the soup and crepe of the day. The soup was a \"Grand Pere\" style, made with sausage and cabbage. The aromas were out of this world, in a good way, and I was instantly transported back home as a kid eating the food my grandma made. In between they brought out our salads, which are not the typical boring lettuce and tomato with a few bits of cucumber that most places give away, this was baby romaine with fresh blue cheese and house made dressings, a wonderful lunch time intermezzo. The crepes were made with chicken, red pepper, kalamata olives, and blue and mozzarella cheeses. One great twist on these crepes, they were prepared in the normal way and then baked in the oven briefly to add a nice little bit of crunch, then a little bit of gravy was applied over the top. They were absolutely delicious and I could eat something like that for lunch every day. My lunch mate went with the quiche of the day which was broccoli and cheddar.

He was fine, not too eager during dinner, only when it came to the tip. He made sure he came right over to our table immediately upon us getting up so he could grab the credit card receipt and ring in his tip (not the remaining plates and glassware).

While I enjoyed my selection I have to say, the best mussels in Providence are being served at Louie Fuller- which isn't to say my CP mussels were bad, I just prefer how they're prepared (with a pink broth and crispy frites) at LF better. I also got stuck with a barnacled mussel, which I've never gotten across town (or at any other restaurant for that matter)- while I was assured there was no harm in its presence, I would've rather not had that mussel (along with the five that were closed) at all.

I've heard from several reputable sources that this is one of the best restaurants in the PVD. Considering the difficulty getting a reservation on a Friday night, this sounded right. My cocktail was great (I got something with gin) and my appetizer was also great. I had the escargot which was drowned in garlic butter - yum! The cheese plate was also wonderful. What was disappointing was my entree. I got swordfish which was room temperature and served with cold tomatoes that appeared they were supposed to be warm. I rarely tell the server that something is wrong with my dish, but I couldn't not say something here (actually my brother did, sensing my disappointment). The waiter explained the tomatoes were not supposed to be hot -- but if this was truly the case, it should be explained on the menu or when the item is ordered because it clearly does not appear it SHOULD be this way. He explained the fish would be taken back and heated moderately, as the chef did not want to dry the fish. It was lukewarm when it came back. I can appreciate not drying out the fish, but I've never had cold, dry swordfish anywhere else. Other establishments have figured out how to cook it, so I'm not sure why CP wasn't able to? Finally, I am choosing to believe it is my own, because otherwise I would not be able to go back... but I found a hair both on the outside of my cocktail glass as well as on one of my plates. I haven't found a hair in my food in years, it seems impossible to have happened twice in one night at such a reputable location.

Rolling their hot dog cart and food truck offerings into one snappy little menu, you can chomp down on anything from a Rabbit-Dijon dog to their supremely well-crafted meatloaf sandwich.And why stop there.While the Wurst Window serves the East Side tadpoles during the day, the owners have their eye on attracting more night-dwellers too by constructing a mini dining bar right inside their restaurant, complete with a standalone kitchenette, a butcher block counter that seats four, and two tables for six lined with low bar stools. They obviously understand that most aren't in the market to spend $100+ on dinner for two and that by serving their daytime menu in-house, they stand to attract more locals looking for a tasty, affordable lunch or dinner.

You might be thinking that blue cheese in a dessert is repulsive, but believe me, the combination of the salty cheese and sweet caramel with the cake will blow your mind. Even the salads are beautifully presented and creative.Another thing to note is that this restaurant gets almost all of it's meat and produce locally, and if you subscribe to their email newsletter you'll begin to learn exactly where.

I used my GPS but this part of Providence had changed so much that I had trouble locating exactly where it was. Luckily I saw that I was in the \"near vicinity\", parked my car and walked around. It was only 39 degrees out, so it made of a nice walk (sarcasm here). Once we did find it I realized that this was a nice little cozy barish type restaurant. While not exclusively drinks, they do have a long menu of drinks both mixed and others. However, I suppose you're coming here for the food.They have a shorter list of foods but I heard the \"mmmms\" and \"ooohs\" of satisfied customers ordering all the various options on the entree.

I love salty food and I feel no hesitation to add salt to anything I eat. With that said, something must be wrong if even I think something is too salty. Maybe it was because we ordered 15 minutes before the kitchen closed, but half of everything that we ordered was oversalted. The burgers, poutine fries, and old-bay fries would have all been awesome if they used half the amount of salt in each.

We showed up late without a reservation, and were brought in to the small dining room and given our own banquette- score!The food was incredible- my husband had the scallops and I had the beluga lentils, a vegetarian dish that was one of the best I've had in recent memory. Both were fresh, light and delicious. An expansive wine list and a number of inventive cocktail offerings rounded out the impressive menu as well. Definitely worth checking out!"], ["Jorge R.", "I popped into the 121 with a friend on Saturday night. We had a couple of appetizers-calmari and cheese plate. Tasty!Had some a couple of drinks and enjoyed the hip vibe.Dark rich wood panels lined the walls of the bar and the clientele was eclectic. ...uppercrust middle aged couples. ..young 20-30 something crew and a couple artsy hipsters. Overall It was a cool place to hang and chat it up with friends."], ["David K.", "Nice dishes, thoughtful menu, reasonably-priced wine list with a few pleasant surprises. Appetizers are large and filling, and the mains were smallish. The staff was generally pleasant if slightly clueless. Why only 3 stars? One of our servers stank. Literally. We were a party of 7 in a booth so dishes were passed over the table repeatedly. We came to dread the arrival of our food for the aromatic punch it came with.Also, the espresso was Nespresso pods. Come on, really?"], ["James F.", "Dined here for Saturday brunch. \u00a0On the whole i wasn't overly impressed, given the emphasis on local ingredients - generally that translates into really flavorful and wonderful results - in this case it seemed more of a marketing focus as they are trying to reach a certain clientele. \u00a0Nothing outright 'bad' to report about the food or service, but the potential is there for Local 121 to be much better. \u00a0My party started out by sharing some monkey bread. \u00a0Although it was fresh (\"straight out of the oven\"), it was rather dry, not one of the better monkey breads i've had (others shared this opinion). \u00a0I had the flapjack as well - the actual flapjack was rather flavorless, but the dish was saved by the peanut butter 'dressing' - i think the point of the dish was for the flapjack to be the background to the amazing-ness that is peanut butter, but it really added nothing whatsoever."], ["Jennifer C.", "We went to Local 121 for the first time for a Father's Day brunch. The food was very good but I feel the need to knock off at least two stars for the very poor service. Many times throughout the meal we were looking around for waitstaff to request something. They served some plates when not all of them were ready. After dropping our entrees we were never checked on once to see if we needed anything. This lack of good service especially bothers me in a restaurant like Local 121, which is trying to be high end, and therefore gives an expectation that the experience will be better than average. This was just poor service on a very basic level."], ["Kim K.", "I wanted to LOVE this place but only ended up just liking it. The menu is all over the place and the combination of everything I ordered just didn't impress me at all. The cheese plate was much too skimpy - the cheese was hardly portioned for two, the accompaniments looked like an afterthought, there was too much bread (in addition to the table bread) used as filler - the whole thing should have been served on a smaller plate as well, it appeared even that much smaller because of the enormous platter they bring it out on. I also got the broccoli soup which was flavorful but super watery and not creamy at all. For my entree I got the scallops which were cooked perfectly but that was about it on the plate. I found the entire menu to be overpriced, the service to be hit or miss, and the parking was miserable. The decor was cool though. Glad I visited but probably won't be returning any time soon."], ["Pavel R.", "Have been to local 121 a number of places for dinner and drinks and consistently have had a great experience. Menu always offers very interesting and diverse options and the food is always prepared to perfection. The service is always very attentive and ambience of the dining room is welcoming and relaxing. This spot is definitely one of my faivs and regulars."], ["Ashley A.", "My coworker and I, both feeling rather underdressed, tried Local 121 as our first meal on our short business trip in town from Atlanta. The restaurant was pretty quiet on a Tuesday night but we enjoyed our white table cloth and big chair experience. We had the calamari to start (as always) which we enjoyed - it came with some spicy pickles veggies...which we weren't sure if it was supposed to constitute as a dipping sauce...but we still dipped regardless. I ordered the \"Native Shellfish Roast\" which in the south we just call a \"boil\". Native Shellfish Roast....quit being all fancy. It wasn't super heavy which worked out great since I had already chowed down on the bread basket before dinner. My coworker got the Pork Chop which he seemed to enjoy based on the lack of pork at the end of the meal. Overall, aside from the table clothes making us feel underdressed like some country folk in tshirts, it was a great \"fancy\" meal at a reasonable cost!"], ["Kate C.", "Excellent all around. Delightful environment and wonderful food. A Favorite!"], ["Katie B.", "Local 121 was not at all what I expected, in a good way. It had been recommended as a place with great food and a great atmosphere, and my friends and I were excited to try it.The restaurant is a little stuffy; it has a nice ambience over-all, but I wouldn't consider this a casual place. \u00a0We had made a reservation, but there wasn't much need. \u00a0Even though it was later on a Saturday night, we arrived early and got seated right away. Our food was really excellent. Honestly, even the bread basket was amazing - I could have eaten that all night. We got the Navajo Fry Bread to split, and drinks. \u00a0The app was pretty good and my drink was fantastic. We each ordered a different entree; I had the Statler Chicken, someone ordered the risotto and another friend got the Monkfish. \u00a0The food presentation was so nice, and I destroyed my chicken. It was FANTASTIC. \u00a0I also tried the risotto - next time, I'll be ordering that. We finished our meal with the Dark Chocolate Cremeux. \u00a0And you might have guessed - it was delicious. The service was really great, too. The waiters were attentive, and made our experience enjoyable. They didn't rush us, were helpful in ordering and just over-all very pleasant.

No need for a \u00a0reservation, and have you had the burger this winter with the fois gras? Died and gone to heaven. I've easily gained a few pounds these past two months but they haven't taken it off the menu yet and I keep ordering it... I'm so easy.

I came here for dinner a couple weeks ago and found that Local 121 exceeded my expectations. Starting off the night with complimentary valet is always a plus. It makes the whole experience so much less stressful!I chose a cocktail with St. Germain in it and it was one of the best cocktails I ever had - just a little sweet and totally refreshing. I would tell you the name but unfortunately I forgot it (although it may be as simple as \"St. Germain\"). My dining companion and I decided to split several small dishes and each one was pretty great. The calamari, foie gras, and pan roasted scallops and squid are all winners. I especially appreciated that the calamari wasn't excessively greasy. And the bruleed grapefruit with the foie gras was a pretty awesome flavor combination.Dessert was sticky toffee pudding and a perfect ending to a perfect meal. I can't wait to come back to Local 121!"], ["Nick C.", "I came here with my family on a Saturday night at about 9pm. We made a last-minute reservation because we ended up in Providence after spending a day in Newport and we wanted to try a cool restaurant -- the reservation was definitely worth it; it wasn't crowded that late but the complimentary valet is for reservations only. Easy to book online, too.We're not frequent fine diners, but we were celebrating a special occasion and so we decided to be adventurous with 121. We were really glad we did! Our hostess was very helpful and friendly in explaining the menu to us, and absolutely everything we ate impressed us. The beluga Lentils, broccoli tempura, and scallops (perfect texture!) were especially memorable. The chef sent out a sample of blueberry cream cheese cracker spreads while we waited for our appetizers, which was also very good -- and a good clue to the amazing blueberry ice cream that was the dessert special. We ran into the pastry chef and he took our compliments on the dessert very humbly & graciously, which was nice to see.All in all, it was excellent food and outstanding service. The host/manager took us for a tour of the downstairs speakeasy when we expressed interest, even though it was closed at the time. We felt a little under-dressed in t-shirts, but the vibe was casual enough that we weren't uncomfortable. Appetizers were $6-15 and entrees in the $25-30 range, with a $30 bottle of wine and $10 desserts. A special occasion treat in terms of budget, but a real treat for the taste buds. We were very impressed!"]], "Gracie's": [["Robert D.", "Wow. \u00a0Amazing experience at Gracie's. \u00a0Jesse was our server and she was a fantastic host for the evening, five star service in every aspect of the dinner. \u00a0After introductions she gave us a tour of the menu and ordering options as well as some recommendations. \u00a0We deliberated then decided to start by ordering the cheese board and sausage gnocchi. \u00a0Both were mind blowingly good. \u00a0Five cheese, spread and nut trios with three delicious crostini choices presented in a creative and polished manner rounded out the cheese board. \u00a0The gnocchi was equally well plated and composed. \u00a0Seasonings were on point with no salt or pepper required, and the balance of the flavors in the gnocchi was perfect, with each individual ingredient shining through. \u00a0These kinds of flavors can certainly only be derived from the fresh, local ingredients that the chef is sourcing to create these dishes. \u00a0Moving on to entrees, my girlfriend had the duck and I had the ribeye. \u00a0The duck was just perfect, with a large breast cut as well as individual sliced pieces cooked to a precise medium rare preparation. \u00a0Skin was crispy, and the duck itself was tender and meaty without being gritty or gamey at all. \u00a0The ribeye absolutely blew my mind with how good it was. \u00a0Hands down the best steak I've ever had... the texture, preparation of perfect medium rare, seasoning and aging all came together beautifully. \u00a0Better than anything I've had at chains like cap, flemmings, mortons, etc. Cookies in your car when you pick it up from the valet are a nice touch. \u00a0Can't wait to return... soon!"], ["Sasha B.", "The service was slow and crap, but again, it was a busy night.

I felt like I was at the Ritz Carlton of restaurants! There were constant surprises from the chef! Everyone here is friendly and knowledgeable. \u00a0My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and he didn't really say much to the restaurant about it. However, from the hostess, coat check, waitress and other servers all wished me a happy birthday. \u00a0They provided us with complimentary champagne as soon as we got in. I enjoy seeing the decorative silver stars on the table to show some festivity was going on. \u00a0We did the 5 course meal with wine pairing which was delicious! I only wish they left us with a description of all the meals and wines we had afterwards so I could cherish the memories! Also, I wish we had some more food and wine with that order. \u00a0My boyfriend noted to our waitress that we wanted to do the 5 course meal but advised I love gnocchi. She spoke with the chef and gnocchi was a part of one of the meals! It's the BEST gnocchi I've had, and I have been to a lot of great restaurants. \u00a0I will definitely come back and share the word as I had a great time! It was nice to receive the special surprise treats. Our friends also called an arranged with them to take care of 2 drinks for us - which was a delight. Our friends had no issues and was happily surprised that the restaurant would send us a card from them. \u00a0I also enjoyed valet, especially finding delicious cookies left behind! The cappuccinos here were great too! \u00a0For the next time, I'd do the 3 course meal as there appeared to be more food and even wine!

Requirements from the birthday boy included a classy atmosphere, not too big a hit on the wallet, not dressy (we basically only came with t-shirts), and upscale cuisine. Oh and yummy bone marrow!Searching Yelp for \"bone marrow\"...besides a bunch of transplant doctors, Gracie's name popped up. Who knew? The menu didn't include bone marrow, but the great looking Yelp photos and an open reservation at 9:30 sealed the deal. We just hoped Gracie's would look past our t-shirts since Yelp Dress said \"Dressy.\"Luckily Gracie's let their dress code standards slack for us, possibly due to our beautiful glowstick necklaces but more likely because the Rhode Island Pride Parade complete with Dorothy, the witches, Rocky Horror, zombies and half-naked leathermen was marching right past their windows.Gracie's real deal is the $40 prix fixe, 3-course dinner, basically select choices from their main menu. My first course sherry roasted beet salad with blood orange vinaigrette and second course Crescent Farms duck were both excellent! While I usually don't like too much salt on my food, the duck had a nice salty balance from the perfectly rendered roast skin, offset by the medium rare meat, red quinoa and slightly bitter baby white radishes. Awesome and highly recommended! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was from creamy Madagascar vanilla beans. So delicious.Gracie's has a great wine list in a wide range of prices. I selected a bottle of Chapellet Vineyards' Cervantes Mountain Curvee, Napa Valley 2011. The red wine blend was terrific with dinner.Service was on the money and well paced. Our waitress was personable and the bussers were numerous and quick. All the wait staff looked like they were attending college or just graduated, and seemed to be well trained in customer service. A busser didn't know the answer to one of our questions regarding what we just ate, and he came back from the kitchen with a thorough answer.Thanks to Gracie's our Birthday boy had one surprise candle on his dessert, was happy and full. We were all highly satisfied. When we come back to Providence, I'm sure Gracie's will once again be on our itinerary."], ["Reggie M.", "Our friend decided to have his 30th birthday in Providence, Rhode Island. Incidentally, the city was celebrating their LGBTQ pride week as well. Having a 4.5 star rating on Yelp, we unanimously agreed to booked at Gracie's. It's somewhat dressy but the ambiance is cozy. The tables are set far enough apart from other tables for everyone to enjoy their intimate dining.We decided to go for the 3 course prix fixe dinner. We started of with a bottle of 2010 mountain cuv\u00e9e, they served it together with an Amuse-Bouche of arugula, rhubarb, goat cheese pesto with wildflowers and pine nuts. I chose russet potato gnocchi as my appetizer; it's a braised rabbit, fava beans, black trumpet mushrooms and pecorino. I found it very filling and piquant. A mouthwatering raspberry sorbet was served as intermezzo to clean our palette. My main entr\u00e9e was the crescent farms duck with red quinoa, turnip, fiddlehead ferns, green strawberry and rhubarb. The serving was ample and it was cooked to perfection. My dessert selection of yogurt panna cotta; rhubarb, fennel meringue, cornbread and orange thyme gelato was simply epicurean.The waiter bought some delicious macaroons with the bill to seal our lovely dinner. It's not very often that I experienced great customer service together with great food. This place is highly recommended."], ["Stephanie Y.", "Wow, this place serves great food. Love the prix fixe options as well. Our table ordered the bass crudo, gnocchi and beet salad to start off with. Gnocchi was so soft and buttery and all of the ingredients are extremely fresh. The beet and crudo were off to a good start. Then we got the duck and ribeye. Again the duck was so tender and juicy. I got the ribeye, but after tasting the duck I had food envy. My ribeye was delicious though especially with the foie gras spread. The sauce was a little too salty after awhile, but the meat was great quality.So .... if you come you MUST save room for the dessert prix fixe menu. They're all full portions and we shared it among the 3 of us. Even though we were full from the dinner, we licked each dessert plate clean. Each one included a cake or pastry with homemade gelato. I don't believe these were on the menu either, so they were all nice surprises."], ["Liz M.", "Wow just wow. ... If your looking for an impeccable dining experience this is the place to be.

Of course we started off with drinks I had a strawberry drink made with tequila lime basil and a peppered rim. I need to go back just to try more drinks ! TheyCame around with a break basket. I had beer bread and cheddar bread. Fresh butter on both. Yummy. For my appetizer I had burata. If you don't know it's fresh mozzarella cheese with a creamy center. It was served with fresh tomatoes and basil and a amazing dressing. I chose the sausage pasta. It tasted home made and the sausage flavor was infused in every bite. It was dressed with chunk of feta cheese. They brought over a palate cleansing sorbet that was a small bite of happiness. For dessert oh my desert. Wow. I had the chocolate cake. It was beautifully presented with two round flourless cakes with mint basil \u00a0and pistachio. I didn't even offer to share it because it was that amazing ! As if dinner was not enough they gave us cappuccino flavored macaroons which are from Ellie's bakery which i believe is the same company. Again wow. Our servers were amazing.

My baby greens salad was perfect, topped with some delicate potato chips and lovely blue cheese. \u00a0Their gnocchi is also a fantastic dish to begin your meal with-- as with everything, the flavoring is perfectThe duck is just fantastic, served with toasty grits and a lovely glaze...

It was just--the most perfect thing. The bread was also lovely and different and I could have just had that and called it a day. Oh--and the cocktails. So good. The best I've had in a long while. Why the three star rating then? The service was pretty meh, and I'd expect more of a restaurant where the food is so delicious. Our waiter--lovely. Knew his stuff. Good guy. His helper? Sweet, friendly, brought plenty of that great bread. But here's the kicker--we had a reservation for 9:15. We were seated at 9:45. OK, a half our wait. Annoying but understandable. It's just that we said around 9:20 that we'd love the table in the front window that was empty. It just needed to be cleaned up. We watched. We waited. Still no one came to clean up the table. Nothing. It got a little less crowded. There were lots of staff out and about. But the table--still, nothing. Husband asked about it again. We were told it was being worked on but we could see from the bar that no one had so much as looked at it. And when someone did come to clean it up, well, I kind of thought she might want to kill us with her eyes. She seemed really displeased. And I swear to you we were not mean or irritating.

Within an hour Gracie's called me back and informed me they had a table open up in the dining room but it was 15 mins later. I was so very pleased - the additional time didn't matter to me.

Everyone agrees the third course lamb/pasta dish was by far the winner at the table. And the red wine from Italy paired with it was perfect! Such a nice cozy place to go on a cold fall night.

After ordering our meals, we received an amuse bouche of sorbet. Cool and tasty. I started with the gnocchi and braised rabbit with peas. Let me say, that I do not eat peas for anyone, in anything, ever. I always try to push myself out of the comfort zone when I visit one of my top 10's. If the chef likes it with peas, eat the damn peas. This dish was perfect, peas and all, the gnocchi were like little clouds and the rabbit was melt in your mouth tender. I think rabbit tastes like a meat somewhere in between chicken and pork, it was a first and it was delicious. I could have had two more bowls of that and been good. Uncle Don tried the sweet bread app, which was so delicately fried and came with an avocado mousse shaped like a square cube and all kinds of other goodies on the plate, almost to pretty to eat. -- Photos to follow.I had the duck with wild mushrooms for dinner and he had a sea bass special. Another awesome course with noting bad to say, not that I am a yelper that just looks for the negative to share. I know people are more likely to share the bad then the good, and I want to help in changing that. -- Nothing but good baby.We both tried the dark chocolate fancy passion fruit dessert with a glass of port to finish off the perfect birthday dinner. I am so glad this is a classy place and they did not come over with a candle stuck in something and clap some corny song in my face. The server bid me a happy birthday and made my night enjoyable for sure, keep filling my glass my friend. I could not even hear our two business women buddies once we started eating and sharing our thoughts about all the amazing food we were being showered with. A food bubble with good convo. The server gave us two passion fruit macaroons with the check, more clouds of melt in your mouth goodness. They even left chocolate chip cookies in the car for a snack on the ride home, if you have any room left at all. I did not, but they went perfectly with my left overs I ate for lunch at work the next day. -- Co-worker jealousy...big time. I will definitely return to Gracie's as often as I can and I would be more than happy to sit in ANY seat in the house. I am back in action Yelp -- Here I come :D"], ["Lisa R.", "I dined here for restaurant week with my boyfriend. It was 30 dollars for a three-course meal and I recommend every person to dine here when restaurant week comes around twice a year in Providence.First off, the service here is spectacular. They have valet and complimentary coat check. \u00a0 Our waiters (Allen and Travis) were so informative and pleasant. One was a beer connoisseur and gave us the full run down on what beers would pair well with our meals and dessert and even offered complimentary tastings. We decided on the Goose Island Pepe Nero Belgian Farmhouse Ale. The decor is elegant yet cozy. They had very inspirational plating! Our amuse-bouche and palate cleansers were served on a plate that had a Ralph Waldo Emerson quote on it. \"Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.\"We ordered the russet potato gnocchi, the roasted beet salad, the swordfish, the duck, the bread pudding, and the chocolate banana cake. The amuse-bouche was a roasted potato with pancetta and a celery leaf. The palate cleanser was a lemon tonic sorbet. There was complimentary lemon macaroons after dessert, and on the way out we snagged two complimentary cookies from Ellie's. Needless to say, we left extremely satisfied and dined at a first-rate restaurant for just 30 dollars a person. Restaurant week is the best deal ever, but I would certainly return here even if it wasn't restaurant week. Note: This was our second time at Gracies. One day, we came in to sit at the bar for some cocktails and we met the loveliest couple who ended up giving us two free tickets to A Christmas Carol at the Trinity theater! \u00a0This is just a place where magic happens! We have now made it a tradition to go to Gracies and see a Christmas Carol every year. =)"], ["Michelle T.", "As good as it gets for Providence! And probably one of the best dining experiences I've had in New England in general. Don't you ever miss out on Restaurant week here at Gracie's, cuz that would be your loss!!!! Our romantic \"3-course\" meal here was fabulous, and made complete with the special seating in a cozy booth (1 of a kind at the restaurant). We were started off with bread, which they come around with to serve you. The bread selection was A-OK, nothing special nor terribly memorable, but still a nice tasty start to the meal. My starter was the beet salad. Refreshing, flavorful, and light. Exactly what I wanted...or so i though until i took a bright of my dining companions AMAZING gnocchi. Absolutely the best gnocchi I've ever had in my ENTIRE life. Rich, creamy and full of shroomy umami-ness. I couldn't help but take multiple bites of his dish and then proceeded to dip my bread into that creamy sauce. OH MY GOD, so good. For my entree, I went for the swordfish. Probably the most well-cooked swordfish I've had. Usually, restaurants easily overcook the fish to it becomes on the slightly rubbery side, but not at Gracie's. The single complaint I had was probably that it was WAY over-salted. I believe I downed 8 glasses of water in that meal alone...and I'm not even exaggerating. Dessert, I had the cinnamon apple bread pudding with carrot cake pieces and butterscotch ice-cream. The warm bread pudding was actually quite delicious and tasted really home-made. Like something you'd have for a homemade brunch. The carrot cake bits were rather boring though. Not much flavor nor texture. The bf had chocolate banana cake with the most delicious peanut butter ice-cream. I kept scooching my spoon over to his plate for some of his ice-cream. The check came with small macaroons, which were a nice touch. The food, the service, the creativity, the atmosphere was all excellent and I can't wait to come back again. If you park your car with valet, they leave you 2 little cookies in the car as well! :) Can't tell you what kind they were or how they tasted cuz the bf ate 'em all."], ["Graham G.", "Ah Gracie's. From everything I had heard about it I was expecting to be blown away. I was, with the blandness of the food. While every plate looked appetizing it was just meh. For what we paid for the tasting menu with wine paring I could have done almost 2 dinners out with my fianc\u00e9 at birch. The whole eating experience was just lackluster. Service was good and attentive. The food runner and bus people more so than our actual waitress. The best part of Gracie's were the pre dinner cocktails we ordered. I had a whiskey based one like usual and my fianc\u00e9 had a gin based cocktail. Both were amazing. We would only go back to Gracie's to have a pre dinner cocktail at the bar and then head elsewhere. All in all an over rated experience."], ["Peter V.", "World class cuisine in Downcity Providence - Michelin readers pay attention: this is the breathtaking haute cuisine!"], ["Ana A.", "My husband and I went to Gracie's on our anniversary weekend. We had a reservation for 9:15 but we weren't seated until 9:45. But that was the case with many other guests who were waiting in the lobby. But , what makes Gracie's such a loved place? The hostess stopped by and gave champagne glasses to everyone who was waiting ! At 9:45 we got started with drinks. The chef sent a sample of curried cauliflower with pickled black currants and some yogurty base , and that was delish! Our first course was the gnocchi and the beet salad.. Both excellent! And that was the problem. The 2 dishes raised our expectations soooo high that the 2nd course became almost a disappointment. My husband ordered farm duck , and he found it to be average. I got the autumn vegetables (picture attached) , which comprised of 3 individual dishes. The first one (mashed cauliflower with curried lentils ) was amazing ! The 2nd one had carrot tempuras with turmeric-yogurt sauce, pickled onions and some salad. It was good but not something I'd rave about. But the last one - the Asian pear with almond dirt and seasonal root vegetables was a turn off . The almond dirt was very bitter. But oh well! For the dessert , my husband ordered pumpkin cheesecake (again a-ok) and I ordered the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (also average).We were somewhat satisfied with our meal, and at the end the chef sent pumpkin macarons ... And when I ate that , I thought whyyyyy??!!! Why me?! Why did you have to ruin my taste by sending those awful macarons. I just drank a lot of water to subdue the taste .Anyhoo, I think I may just not have ordered the right dishes .. But if I am in providence again , I will give Gracie's another try !"], ["Matt E.", "If you're looking for an interesting night out with great food in Providence, this might fit the bill. \u00a0You'll need to be open to trying new things as you're sampling the chef's \"inspirations\". \u00a0The experience was very fun and the food was great. \u00a0It's close to PPAC and other places like that in the area so it would make for a great place to stop and have dinner before a show. \u00a0Just make sure you give yourself enough time to enjoy."], ["Elizabeth K.", "Best meal I've ever had. Started with the foie gras, which had a perfect sear and a delicious melt in your mouth texture and buttery taste. Crescent Farm Duck skin ws so perfectly rendered and crispy. Goat cheesecake was a gamble that paid off. It was surprisingly light and creamy with just a subtle tang. Three amuse bouche which were a pleasant addition. The service was perfect. Five stars all the way."], ["Victoria K.", "Gracie's is perhaps the best meal I've had in Providence. The menu at Gracie's offers several options. Dishes are offered a la carte or as part of a prix fixe meal. Additionally, guests can choose to partake in a blind five course tasting. Although many of the regular menu items sounded appealing, we decided to go for the gold and opt for the mysterious tasting.We started with a delicious truffled egg salad amuse bouche. I could have eaten it all day long in sandwiches and by the spoonful... Mmmmm...Our first course of the tasting was a crudo of wild striped bass. It was very light and fresh in flavor and I nice was to start our meal.The pasta course featured a large raviolo filled with country-style pate. It was rustic and meaty and was garnished with crunchy fiddlehead ferns, fava beans, trumpet mushrooms, and aged provolone. It was beautifully presented and delicious.Our fish course started off scary and turned into spectacular. We were served pan-fried soft shell crabs, which my dining companions had a weird and unpleasant history with. We were pleasantly surprised to discover how fantastic this dish was. In fact, it quickly became our favorite of the meal!An intermezzo of sorbet was a perfect palate cleanser...A rare double rack lamb chop was our meat course, and provided a delicious alternative to beef at this point in the meal. It was served with silky carrot puree and confit baby carrots, along with crispy artichokes and English peas. This was another fast favorite. We were definitely impressed.Dessert was their version of tres leches cake. It was tasty and light, with small pearls of mango. Although I enjoyed this, it wasn't quite as spectacular as desserts I have tried in other award-winning restaurants. Overall, we enjoyed it though.A final touch with a few French macarons with our check was appreciated, as was the baggy of chocolate chip cookies left in our car by the valet. Service was on par with the wonderful food, and I'm happy to say I've found my new favorite special-occasion spot in Providence. Thank you so much Gracie's for opening my eyes to a new world of delicious dining. I can't wait to go back!"], ["Terry R.", "The food was very good and until the bill came, we were happy. ( except for the one after dinner drink ordered never arriving ) 3 of the four entrees ordered were overcharged by $60. The waitress had an inexplicable explanation that made no sense. She then corrected 2 entree prices. The manager had to be called to correct the 3rd. He did take that entree and an appetizer \u00a0off the bill. So check your bill at Gracie's !!"], ["Vale C.", "Dreadful experience. Made a reservation for an anniversary dinner through Opentable. I was delighted to receive a call confirming the evening of. Dressed up and arrived on time but was told that they \"were closed\" and were aware of \"no such reservation\" as the door nearly slammed in our faces. I called during their \"open hours\" in the evening the next day and left a message to express disappointment and find out what had happened. Nearly a week later, I've been given no response. Prior experience with Gracie's customer service has been exceptional, but after this, my opinion has taken a nosedive. I'm incredulous that I didn't even receive an apology after I went to the trouble of trying to contact them. If you're not willing to seat people during your last seating on Opentable, it shouldn't be listed! Even a \"I know you have a reservation, but we had a slow night and are closing up, and can I help you reschedule?\" would have been better; it's certainly still disappointing and un-professional, but at least acknowledges the situation."], ["David G.", "Me and the Mister had a very nice nine course tasting menu. Each dish is well crafted and thought out. We both ate extra slowly in order to really appreciate the food. The service is impeccable. I'm not sure I'll go back unless it's a special occasion or I want to impress someone."], ["Cat R.", "Even I am surprised at my measly 2-star review considering the quality others talk about; however 2 stars is quite just for a very disappointing meal.We ordered the 5 course tasting menu (about $70) and nearly every course was over salted to the point of us not finishing our plate. I eat out quite often so it's not as though I eat unsalted homemade food all the time. I ordered a vegetarian tasting course while my friend had a normal meat tasting. We were served 10 dishes and 8 out of 10 were over salted. That's crazy. They had 10 opportunities to not over salt and they did not deliver. It was to the point where we were so relieved to get our dessert course and get a salt break.We informed our servers, who were amazing and gracious people, but the food was just so subpar to the expectations of ourselves and I think to the quality the restaurant is aiming for. Sadly we will not be back and cannot recommend."], ["Steve P.", "Had the duck.. medium rare! Fucken good! Can't explain. Katelyn (the cool server) Hit the spot."], ["Meghan O.", "I can't give Gracie's anything other than five stars. I had been wanting to dine here, or dreaming of dining here, for a while. Finally went with some friends during restaurant week... And had an amazing meal. I got the russet potato gnocchi, the duck, and the chocolate banana cake. For starters the gnocchi was delicious, and the Brussel sprouts had a nice crispy outer layer - which is my favorite. They were so delicate, my friend described them as little pillows. Then the duck. Which came with rice and squash cubes. It was the most delicious duck I have ever had. I shared my sisters swordfish and was so full, I was able to take some of my duck home as leftovers. I hate saying this, but, nom nom nom. I will be dreaming of that for some time. The dessert was honestly not my favorite. The ice cream was great, and the brittle was delicious. The cake overall just was too dense for me. But, I was beyond full so it didn't really bother me. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that my friend got was massive, and super tasty (I tried some). And the other dessert option - some sort of bread pudding was also delicious. Then there were the two great little surprise tastings between courses. One was a little mortadella something or other, and then there was a cranberry ginger sorbet. Both were great, but the cranberry ginger sorbet was so cleansing and refreshing. I love surprises! Only downfall- one member of our party got their early and checked in. She went to grab a drink at the bar - which had people dining at it, so it was kind of awkward standing there. When my sister and I got there we decided to check if our table was ready - and it was- and the hostess told us somebody had already checked in - which we knew from joining her at the bar. Since we had a reservation, and our table was ready, it would've been nice to sit and order a drink instead of awkwardly trying to get a drink at the bar. Then, we sat for 20 minutes before we got a wine menu and someone to take our drink order. Aside from the wait for drinks, service was pretty good.Oh, and the valet gave me a cookie even though I didn't use valet. Thanks man!"], ["Edward S.", "Gracie's has been our favorite restaurant for all of the five years we have lived in Providence. \u00a0We love it so much that my wife and I chose Gracie's as the venue in which to be married and host our reception.Gracie's delivers an artful blend of deliciousness, creativity, and sophistication in each bite of Head Chef Matt Varga's food. \u00a0The consistency in their excellence is staggering, and the menu changes frequently such that every visit is a fresh, new culinary experience. \u00a0Gracie's would hold its own against any of New York City's best (and most expensive) fine-dining bistros.With events, Gracie's has shown itself to be just as perfect as it is in the dining room. \u00a0Our wedding in May 2014 was so seamlessly executed (by Katie Kleya, her team, and the service staff) that it seemed effortless -- and we all know achieving that requires tireless effort. \u00a0The food was, no surprise, also as delectable as we expected from all of our prior visits.Highly recommended for Providence people and visitors alike -- and if you live here, this is the perfect setting in which to impress your guests with your city."], ["K D.", "Gracie's is much more frou frou than I usually go for, but they have great food to back it up. Their prix fixe menu is a great deal if you can find things on there that appeal to you. The overall vibe is odd - the food is high end/big city fare, but the decor is that dated fake fancy look that Rhode Island loves. The waitstaff dressed and acted like it was formal dining, but the host/hostess were wearing very casual fisherman sweaters. The atmosphere is not stuffy exactly, but I think it would gel more if they took the \"\"sophistication\"\" down a notch and aimed for hip rather than strictly high end."], ["Rebecca V.", "I've been to Gracie's a number of times over the years. The experience and the way the menu works is great -- the prix fixe menus give you an opportunity to have 3 or 5 course meals at a fairly reasonable price, especially during restaurant week. In addition, there's a variety of fresh bread baked at Ellie's Bakery, Gracie's bakery spinoff, and usually three amuse-bouche items between courses.I've had some truly great meals here -- hearty duck with cherry sauce in the winter, and exciting desserts year round.The past few times I've gone, though, there have been errors in the conception and execution of the dishes that are too much to overlook. In March, I ordered a duck dish that would have been excellent, had the carefully placed cubes of root vegetables also been cooked to tenderness--alas, they were almost raw. When I went for restaurant week, I was disappointed by the service -- I didn't receive the first amuse-bouche and had to ask for bread. The appetizer--gnochhi-was truly great, pillowy and fresh. The entree, bass with cockles, pickled peppers, and tomato water left much to be desired. The bass's skin wasn't crispy, and basically slid off as one piece; the three tiny cockles didn't add much, and the dish was, overall, overwhelmed by acid and pretty one-note. The toffee pavolva featured a puzzing mix of ingredients--a meriunge cookie play on a pavolva that was hard rather than pillowy, a creme angalais on top, strawberries on the side, overly-hard gingersnaps crumbled on the other side, and a small scoop of toffee ice cream. These things didn't come together in anything like a pavolva, which was a bit of a disappointment, as I was expecting a truly stunning dessert.While Gracie's sometimes provides a stellar experience, I don't think I'll be coming back -- there's a bit too much inconsistency in service and food."], ["Gail A.", "We ate ( I should say dined) here for New years and it was such a treat. For the past 5 years our new years party was pajamas and a good movie, and that is great... but wonderful food, exceptional service and live music by Katie made the night so much fun. It was spectacular! \u00a0Don't get me wrong if price is an issue and you are on a budget as wonderful as their food is this is not for you. \u00a0But if you are looking for an oasis of fabulous food and good people this is the place to go. Great for romantic dinners! I highly recommend Gracie's. \u00a0And yes you have to get dessert because they know how to finish a meal off with tasty treats that leave you dreaming."], ["Jaki G.", "Took my husband here for his birthday after a show at Trinity. He was so happy with this place :) Everything was delicious. It's hard to not spend $150 though, but well worth it for a special occasion. The atmosphere is intimate and perfectly lit. They walk around with an assortment of fresh breads, which is really nice. Service and food was just great and I'll definitely go here again for a special occasion in the future."], ["Lou G.", "This place is amazing. \u00a0The ambiance, quality of food, absolutely everything. \u00a0If you have never been here, and are looking for a special place to take someone give Gracie's a shot. \u00a0I have eaten there many times, and have never been disappointed.Wait staff it's incredible.Not sure there is a bad table in the entire restaurant.Didn't get better."], ["John S.", "This spacious venue knocked out our large group with its food and service. We came on our friend's birthday, which coincided with the gay pride parade, running right by the restaurant's front door. Neither our large party or the chaos of the night seemed to phase the place, which put us in a beautiful corner booth.When the birthday boy went to the little boys' room, we told our server that it was his big day. She said they'd put a candle in his dessert, but \"we don't sing, because it's embarrassing.\" So true! We, however, would be free to sing if we liked.Our server noticed we'd all opened the menu to the prix fixe menu--of course we had, since it's really such a deal. $40, and with items from the rest of the menu. We had lots of questions and she was very patient and thorough in answering them all.We were surprised by thoughtful and clever amuses bouche between courses.There was a little confusion when a bottle of wine we did not order came to the table; later, there was an echo of this confusion when this bottle appeared on the check, but everything was resolved easily.The rabbit and gnocchi appetizer was a delicious combination of textures and flavors. It was heavy on the salt, in a very appropriate way. The flavorful mix could also work well as an entree.The duck came in a large portion and was also salty in a way that seemed right. Fresh white radishes were a palate cleaning surprise.The creme brulee was everything it is supposed to be, and then some--very rich and wonderful. We sang Happy Birthday in cheerful whispers.Gracie's created a special night with grace and also with value. The sophistication and comfort of this restaurant made it a highlight of our visit to Providence."], ["James F.", "Dined here during the most recent restaurant week. \u00a0Was very impressed by the service and attention to detail. \u00a0Delicious bread, desserts, appetizers and wine. \u00a0Entrees were very good, but not quite on the level of everything else.Only negative was the seating. \u00a0We were in what you might call a corner booth, which should have been quaint - but there was another table directly across from us (just a few feet away) with the exact same setup; so if i looked straight ahead i was staring at some random guy instead of my girlfriend. \u00a0Didn't really detract from the evening but it was an awkward first impression."], ["Brent R.", "This place is amazing! Food is delicious, the coffee is good, and the service is terrific.I specially love the fact that it's located on my walk from the Westside to the east side.
