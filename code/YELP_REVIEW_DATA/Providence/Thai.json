The Nam Yaa Soup aka \"Medicine Soup\" is a highly coveted secret passed down from college student to college student. When you have a cold, you go to Angkor and get the Nam Yaa. It's amazing. I've never used the term \"explosion in your mouth\" or \"tongue orgasm\" before, but I think it's because I've been waiting until now. This soup is very, very different and it's not like any other soup I've ever tasted. If you like Pho, you will probably like it, because while it's not that similar, it has that same.. \"hmmmm... ohhhhhh!\" effect when you first taste it. It's sweet, spicy, and it'll make your nose run. Make sure to eat/slurp it while it's piping hot, because like any other soup, it's best when it's ready to burn you.As for other things... I'm not a fan of the street noodles, but I do love the Brittany Noodles.Their new location is lovely. There are only about 5 tables and a few stools at the counter, but it's not a very busy place most of the time (but always still pleasantly occupied). Granite countertops, a flatscreen TV that plays Cambodian music stuffs, and new tables & chairs.I've also had their Sweet & Sour soup and their Tom Yum (aka Hot & Sour) soup. I will always prefer the Nam Yaa, but in order of preference, I'd probably go with the Nam Yaa, Tom Yum, and then Sweet & Sour. I say this only if I HAD to choose, but I've gone in and bought all three before to freeze two of them for a later date.In any case... if you're sick, this is THE place to get soup in Providence."], ["Bailey M.", "The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is that this place is TINY. However, it is decorated nicely and there is a TV on the wall playing Cambodian Karaoke if you are so inclined. Our waitress was delightful-- very friendly, quick, and helpful with explaining the dishes on the menu. The best part of the meal was the fried cod-- I highly recommend it. All of the dishes (spring rolls, noodles, pad thai) were fresh tasting and delicious. I would definitely come back."], ["Mandy D.", "I can't even begin to rave about the Naam Yaa soup, although it seems that everyone on the page has done the job for me. Everything on the menu that I've tried has been exceptional so far. My favorite dish would have to be the green chili, hands down. It's got the perfect balance of spicy & sweet. If you're more daring, I'd suggest the red chili which is much spicier. Also, the mini eggrolls are delicious, and they come out quickly so they're a great starter.I can't wait for the new upstairs dining to open up. I'm sure to be back soon!"], ["Benjamin T.", "It might be a little hard to spot, tucked in just off Wickenden Street behind Adler's Hardware, but this little place is worth seeking out.I'm no expert on the subtleties of Cambodian cuisine- all I can say is that the food is delicious.I was especially impressed with the Nam Yaa Noodles, which warmed my soul and filled my stomach on a cold, grey December afternoon.I spoke at some length with the owner, Chut. He is the chief cook and bottlewasher, as the saying goes, with some help from his family, all of whom are descended from a Cambodian family that were (before the Communists arrived) cooks for the Cambodian royal family.Very friendly folks, a nice cozy place- a real gem for the city, which is increasingly becoming dominated by huge corporate chains."], ["Sue K.", "Wow. Just had a delivery service and it was so fast & quick! (mainly b/c I live literally two blocks away from the restaurant haha) but still, it took approx 20-25 min! and I ordered 3 dishes.

Pad Thai was really good too! and i was surprised how they put a lot of shrimps in it! loved it. I also had crispy chicken wings and they were really good ;). \u00a0Spicy and cripsy!I am definitely going to order from them again.

The small is a general portion; so delicious. \u00a0As we sipped our way through the soup, our noodles were quickly considered tomorrow's lunch.

For starters, we got two appetizers, the Nime Chow and \u00a0Chicken Satay, both were excellent. I personally prefer the sauce that came with the Satay over the peanut sauce from the Nime Chow, but that's just me. Not too much of a \u00a0fan of peanut sauce... Next for the entree we ordered the much talked about on Yelp, the Nam Yaa soup. It has a sweet and spicy taste that is pretty unique and very good! We also ordered another entree, the Beef Spicy Noodle dish. I love scallions with any type of food and they certainly did not skimp on it. As for desert we brought a bottle of Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout. I call it desert since this was tasted like Cappuccino. The restaurant is small, so we went early around 7 to beat the crowd on a Friday night and it turned out to be a great idea. There wasn't much people eating there yet. The service was great and so was the decor. They also had some ethnic karaoke on tv that looked like a bad soap opera. But it's part of the experience, I guess.

Definitely the best Thai place that I've been to in Providence (admittedly not a very high number, oops).The Pad See Ew in particular is divine.

I wouldn't come here with more than 2-4 people on a weekend or you'll never get seated without a reservation.VEGETARIAN ALERT: a lot of the vegetable soups use chicken stock and a lot of the noodle dishes are made with fish sauce, so avoid the soups and ask them to make your noodles with soy sauce instead!"], ["Queenie L.", "We were craving for asian food so went to this neighborhood Thai food place. \u00a0Cute cozy restaurant, nice waitress but I wish I can score this place with more stars. \u00a0Everything taste like home made, did not meet the restaurants standards. \u00a0;("], ["Joie S.", "I finally tried this place after hearing so much about it.

When I move, I find the nearest Thai restaurant and I attempt to latch to it like a parasite. Unfortunately, I have to say.... there's no latching here at Sawaddee. They have the convenience of being close, but not only are they by far the most expensive Thai restaurant I have ever eaten at, but they nickel and dime you to death (yes, they charge you for the white rice that doesn't come with the curry). How much does white rice really cost? Shouldn't your $12 entree come with the $0.05 that it costs you for the rice? Who knows...Overall, the food was ok, and nothing to write home about which is unusual because I always write home about Thai. I also had their Rad Nah (or lad nah depending on who you ask) which is the rice noodle in gravy sauce. It's good and I wish I could say this would be my go to place, but alas this will likely be a resounding NO.Parking is difficult to find outside of the restaurant as it is all street parking in the midst of many other restaurants.

First off, do not expect to enjoy your meal in a spacious restaurant as that is not what you will get. There are about 8 tables in the entire place and extremely snug. One of my tricks is when frequenting little \"dive eats\" I always go in the \"off-season\" of the day, lunch early or late dinner...this way you are not cramped. On this particular occasion, I went for lunch and was pleased to see that theu have a lunch menu; however, it is only to dine-in...which sucks if you just want to take it back to the office with you. The server didn't speak very much English but was friendly. I started out with the lunch portion Som Tum Salad, fine strips of carrot and red cabbage tossed with lime juice, Thai chili, and ground peanuts. Very refreshing and delish, not to mention healthy. I ordered the lunch portion of the Tofu Pad Thai, the waitress talked me into trying it with the Crispy noodle which I was a bit apprehensive about doing as I like my flat rice noodles. I also asked for it to be extra spicy and was asked how spicy based on a 1-4 system...I got 4! The lunch Pad Thai started off with an included smallTom-Yum vegetable soup. It was the best Tom-Yum soup that I have had in a very long time. Not only were the veggies fresh and colorful, the broth was perfectly seasoned and each ingredient sang its own song. I left most of the cabbage in the bowl but finished every last bit of the broth. The Pad Thai was so tasty and spicy just as I requested. This Pad Thai was also the best I have had in quite some time. I don't like it when the Pad Thai is overly soppy & wet, glistening with oil. This was fresh, light and just enough bean sprouts, egg, scallions and peanuts. I was very pleased with my lunch and can't wait to go back to try other things which may be difficult as I can't imagine not getting these items again.For all of the people with bad experience, I am sorry to hear that.

That said, the food obviously didn't taste fresh. Ignoring that, it wasn't really palatable either. The sauces were not balanced or rich. They were often very thin, like water with soy sauce and some spices mixed in. The restaurant itself is a cramped room.
