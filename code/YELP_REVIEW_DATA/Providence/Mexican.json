The owner seems like a super friendly and passionate guy, so it pains me to say unfavorable things about his restaurant, but I am going to go ahead and say them because I Yelp the truth.The \"famous\" sangria was so terrible, I barely drank half the glass. We were the second of two tables in the dining room and they still managed to mess up our order of 4 tacos. The chips and salsa that were brought to the table when we sat down tasted as though they had been cooked in stale, old oil and the salsa tasted oddly sweet kind of like spaghetti sauce. The tacos themselves were pathetic, but it's hard to complain about a one dollar taco. They didn't really taste like anything. They were so bland that my man who never puts hot sauce on anything, added some to his \"meal\".I found it strange that there were sugar packets on the table, but we had to ask for hot sauce. I found it even more strange that our tacos had shredded cheese on them.The place was clean, but the ambiance was a little sterile. The lights were a little too bright to feel any sense of coziness, which it could use given the hard wood chairs and the tile floor. The owner was very friendly, but the waitress seemed to have more interest in standing behind the bar chatting up some locals than she did in giving any attention to her two tables. We were not offered glasses of water, we were kept waiting so long the owner ended up coming over and asking us if the waitress had taken our order yet (which clearly she hadn't since we still had our menus), we weren't given coasters or cocktail napkins with our drinks, we had to ask for hot sauce, and then we had to ask the owner for our check. None of these things are unforgivable, but they do add up to an underwhelming experience. We're really surprised that there are so many 5-star reviews here (and also on Facebook) for Toro. Between the lackluster service and the bland food, it is surprising they've been able to stay open this long. It also doesn't help that parking on Atwells Ave is kind of a nightmare, too.

Came here late one Tuesday night, among the last patrons in the place. I was surprised that the kitchen was even open, given that it was probably midnight at that point. I enjoy that there is a full bar in addition to the restaurant; however, I neglected to partake in any indigenous beverages that particular night. Although there was only one man working both the bar and the tables, I was immediately attended to. I received my complimentary chips and salsa (love me some complimentary), which were both superb; the salsa in particular is worth noting, both for its freshness, and perfect palette of tomato essence and spiciness.I ordered a bowl of pezole (the hominy soup oh-so-difficult to find on this coast), which turned out to be the red variety with pork (a green, tomatillo-based version exists as well). It was a bit lacking in salt for my personal preference, although I am a bit of a saline addict...so perhaps it was satisfactory for the average person. All in all, the flavor was definitely there, and it made for a nice appetizer.My main course was the burrito. You are given a variety of options for filling and sauce, which I am a huge fan of. I opted for the tomatillo sauce (again, a pretty rare find on this coast), with steak. The portions were quite large, and the taste was amazing. I haven't tasted this sort of authenticity in a burrito since being back on the West Coast... It's the closest I've had since moving here 5 or so years ago. The steak was literally cooked and seasoned to perfection.I know that amazing Italian joints dominate the Fed Hill scene, but if you ever have a craving for some south of the border, Toro is definitely worth stopping in for."], ["Andrew M.", "Great place to unwind, have a drink..

However, in the spirit of fairness and informing the reader about this popular Tex-Mex joint, I guess I'll carry on. ;)Anyways! Tortilla Flats is one of those places where things are truly hit-or-miss. There are a number of reasons for this, but it does deliver precisely what it promises.This restaurant is typically very busy. That's because it has got some prime real estate! Not only is it down the street from Brown University; it is also close to apartment living for many other local universities, including Johnson & Wales and RISD. This means college students with cash to blow, and also university faculty and staff who are very well-paid.All in walking distance from a restaurant that is too small to really support demand.That's one of the kickers about Tortilla Flats. It has a beautiful interior. I love the wooden benches and such. But because of the oversized seating, there isn't enough! You can sometimes wait forever to eat/drink here.....Which doesn't make all that much sense, considering that the only real perk to Tortilla Flats over any other Tex-Mex location is that it's in stumbling distance for people with cash flow.So yeah, Tortilla Flats can get pretty darn crowded. That's fine and all. I can deal with a packed bar. But I don't go to a Tex-Mex place to just drink; if I really wanted tequila, I'd go pretty much anywhere and have a marg. The whole point is to go and enjoy the food!Unfortunately... the food isn't really all that stellar. The rice and beans are as plain as can be, which works and yet also isn't a real reason to order the Mezclar Combinar (combo plate) other than the fact that it's cheaper than purchasing the individual items.The enchiladas are pretty good, but a lot of their meat is dry. The veggie option is more of the same bland rice and beans. So either way, the filling inside your enchilada, or tamale, or taco is going to be tough to chew. Bummer!Their nachos are plenty to share and could pretty much make a meal for two or three. They've got some good nachos!Margaritas are delicious, a good price, a bit strong, and come in pitchers for larger parties.All in all, it's a two-star restaurant, but a good place to bring a large group of friends.

These delicious nachos were followed by the meal, my meal was the Slider Trio. Which included a Buffalo Chicken Slider, Pulled Pork Slider, and Traditional Cheese Burger Slider. A little bit of everything, this was a wonderful sampler plate. I have to say the Cheese Burger slider was the best of the three, followed closely by Pulled Pork Slider The Buffalo Chicken Slider was average and had a hard time competing after the Buffalo Chicken Nachos. My lunch guest ordered a combo plate including an Enchilada and a Tamale, with sides of Rice and Beans. Everything had great flavor and the Tamale was cooked traditionally in the corn husk. Both topped with a delicious Enchilada sauce and plenty of cheese. A great place for Lunch or Dinner, this has been one of our lunch favorites for sometime now.

We ordered the Tijuana Street Fries and the Chili Lime wings. Both were very good. The fries were absolutely delicious as they had large pieces of pork with a green salsa and a couple of cheeses. It was so good I wanted more once we polished off the platter. The wings were tasty as well and cooked perfectly. Not too messy and nice and crispy.

I walked in solo on a Friday night -but I was neck deep in a conversation in under ten minutes, comparing excellent (and creative as all get-out!) menu offerings while bending elbows with good beers and friendly people. I'm about it.Bartending was capable, helpful, and...friendly! \u00a0Beer selection is moderate and local for the most part (RI/CT) plus some further-outs (eg Sculpin varieties as of this writing. \u00a0PS - there were two solid offers not listed, worth inquiring about when you're in, in case there's any secret goodness you need to be about). I grabbed various beers, each tasty...but the selection rotates, so I'll stay mum on the particulars except to say I was pleased. The food options were a shock for \"simple bar food,\" which I'd expected going in. \u00a0Nothing of the sort here. \u00a0Asian, El Salvadoran, and mash-up culinary options were essentially the only choice. I clocked in a shift with the San Miguel Street Fries, but could happily have gone seven other directions. I appreciated the options thoroughly, but here might be the only knock - while the selections were inspired, the offering was merely good, not great, and it was what I was told could be considered a start-here-to-dig-the-menu choice. No problem, just not sublime - and if I return and find better options, best believe I'll upgrade.Environmentally-speaking, the music was pretty boss between latter day punk, real garage, and some fine rock n' roll. (The mood was further enhanced by Providence College basketball giving Villanova a run on TV - though your results may vary). Conversation was lively without roaring.

It seems like they are always rotating their selection on draft so I enjoy coming in and seeing something new to try.Also, I recently discovered how awesome their food is. While the menu is very simple, the food is eclectic and full of flavor. The mofo fries are a must try...the sriracha sauce and melted cheese on them was sooo good.

You can truly see the pride in all the work done there from the renovation to the products they serve to the way that they treat their customers. The menu is seasonal with some favorites kept on all the time but in the winter the addition of Pho and Ramen is absolutely amazing. You can really see pride in all the work that they do there.

The wings crispy not overly spicy and the little bits of bacon really shine through.The fries are hand cut and crispy pulled pork cilantro and cheese and a spicy pepper blend perfectly complement those hand cut fries.

The service left much to be desired, including not having the food we ordered, the waitress just bringing us the check when we weren't ready, the bathroom running out of TP and finally another bartender cursing out my friend as we were leaving.

I didn't know what to expect but had hopes that it would be good since there is such a lack of good bars on this side of town. The beer selection was excellent! Narragansett seasonal was the only crap beer on the menu. Everything else was from greats like Stone. They had an excellent Scotch Ale the name of which escapes me now. We also tried a few things from their food menu. The bacon wings were okay. I REALLY liked their kimchi deviled eggs. Good flavor there. Didn't quite mesh with my scotch ale but no big deal. The place is small and very clean. The thing that surprised me was how well lit it was. From the outside it looks like the kind of place you might go to hide, much like a cave. Not so. Definitely my favorite neighborhood bar to date. Dave the bartender (and maybe the owner) is very knowledgeable about his beers and local brewer's scene. He told me one of his distributors is in talks with Dogfish to maybe start selling in Rhode Island again!!!!!! Two thumbs up (two pints up anyway:)"], ["Andre B.", "What can I say, I came for the beer and left wanting more of their food. Self proclaimed beer geek in me drew myself to this new craft beer bar. They have a small local centric tap offering that is sure to please. I was initially drawn there for the Lagunitas Sucks! Imperial IPA. It was cold perfectly poured. Here's the good part. I ordered the Poutine special. Let me tell you it was out of this world. Fries were perfectly cooked with the cheese melting into that decadent gravy. Never expected that from a little corner bar. Then I ordered the sinfully good bacon chicken wings. Just a perfect level of heat and a hint of bacon goodness in the background. Keep doing what your doing.

Meanwhile, within walking distance of my house I had these options: McDonalds, Subway, and the Shell station. Oh, there was also a really crappy bar called the Acores Cafe, which I went to all of one time before my wife decided she was never setting foot in there again. I guess people screaming at the top of their lungs in Portuguese is not the nicest setting for a date night.Well, the Acores has been sold, and has reopened as What Cheer? Tavern, named after the famous greeting (\"What Cheer, Netop\") given to Roger Williams when he first came to Providence. What Cheer is an intimate space that specializes in local food and beer. The menu is small, simple, and locally sourced. The current beers on tap are Providence favorites Revival and Trinity, along with Newport Storm, Wachussett, Grey Sail and of course, Narragansett. Bottled beers are also available and generally fall into the New England craft beer milieu. Now, as nice as this sounds, it's still Washington Park so they do have $2 Narragansett Tallboys on Thursdays, and some domestic beer and cheap shot options as well. What Cheer Tavern has only been open for a few days, but so far it's drawing an eclectic crowd. You have some of the old neighborhood guys that used to come to Acores, college students from Johnson & Wales, professionals stopping in for a bite or a drink after work, some military folks, and people attracted to the locavore and craft beer vibe. All they need now is some hipsters and they'll win some sort of Providence Bingo.The space itself is cozy - probably holds 20 people comfortable with 30 being a tight fit. However, it has a really nice fenced in patio area that they plan to turn into a beer garden. Given the lack of outdoor seating at most bars and restaurants in Providence, I'm psyched to have such an amenity in my neighborhood. The owner seems nice and friendly. We talked for a bit while I was enjoying my Gansetts, and I always appreciate a bartender who takes the time to talk to a lone patron rather than just texting or cleaning and waiting until you need a refill. You can tell the place is still finding its feet. In some ways, I really like that. I like that it's not so busy that I can actually get to know the owner. I like that they draw an eclectic mix of people. I like that they're an unpretentious place serving craft beer and locally sourced food."], ["Eric W.", "Super tasty. Absorbed all the alcohol.

Great local beers on tap, friendly staff, kick ass blues cranking on the stereo, and several large HDTV's with football and soccer. We got to talk to the new owner quite a bit tonight.

And the delicious hot pink edged radish pickles on the side. I'm not crazy about their quesadillas only because they use the thick corn tortillas for that and I think quesadillas should be made with flour tortillas to let the filling take center stage.

The food is amazing. Everything was fresh, well-seasoned, cooked properly and presented immaculately.

It used to be great for groups, but now the vibe is decidedly romantic.The last two times I've been there, I've really wanted a second cocktail--and a second glass of water!!--but have been more or less ignored by the waitstaff.

It's not the easiest to come by. There are many posers. After living in Los Angeles, I have truly been missing the presence of excellent Mexican in my East coast hangouts. Well, look no further. Chilangos fits the bill nicely. First of all, it's pretty much in the ghetto. That's a compliment. Don't expect to find really great Mexican food in the nice part of town. It's worth a visit outside of your comfort zone to taste the wonderful food at Chilangos.During our recent visit here, we were greeted by the most adorable old man who didn't speak a word of English. He did his best to communicate with us in Spanish, and whatever he was saying and doing must have worked because by the end of our meal we were fighting over which one of us was going to adopt him! (We eventually settled on joint custody).Our server Marie was also fabulous. She was really helpful and friendly, even though we stayed in the restaurant finishing our meal past closing time. The restaurant itself is fairly small and cozy. It has the perfect vibe for a Mexican fiesta. The margaritas are served in VERY generous portions and they are freshly made in a variety of flavors. I loved the cactusberry margarita, and my dining companions swooned over the original and mango versions. Several of us decided to order Enchiladas. I love how flexible the menu is here. You can easily switch out meats and vegetables and really get your food the way you want it, without drama. The enchiladas stated that they were dipped in their respective sauces and then topped with shredded chicken, onions, queso fesco, sour cream, etc. I assumed they were actually filled with these ingredients, but alas, they were literally topped with them! It was almost like a deconstructed form of what I consider enchiladas to be. But you know what? They were FABULOUS! Who cares if they're filled or topped when the food is this fantastic. Additionally the refried beans are BLACK instead of pinto (delicious) and the rice is great as well. Generous portions at wonderful prices. I'm smitten. Not only do I want to adopt the old Mexican man who works here, but I want to return again and again to satisfy every craving for Mexican food that ails my ex-Los Angelelino body."], ["Jef S.", "Solid Mexican food cred. Worth a trip.People complain too much about the Mt. Pleasant environs in their reviews of this excellent restaurant. I mean, I lived in Dorchester, MA for years, and this neighborhood wasn't nearly as bad. Maybe I just don't pay attention to these things, but it's always been my belief that for the Real Deal Food, one must venture outside one's comfort zone for the payoff.The first tip-off to Mexican food greatness was the fact that every other customer in Chilango's was Hispanic. The room and decor are really nice. \u00a0It looked even better after two Salty Dogs. Food: chips with spicy salsa. Asked for side of Habanero sauce (uh, hells yes). Guacamole nearly as good as my homemade, with nice thick chunks of onion and tomato. Got lengua tacos and nearly died and went to heaven: tender and delicious. Yum! Solid tamales, with the poblano pepper and cheese as the standout.Service was pretty good. Price was mid-range, but, mind you, we spent about $30 in drinks alone.

It had such a creamy texture to it and flavors of lime, parsley, onions that I could taste cause sometime you can't taste anything but bland guacamole =\\ Michoccanas, enchilada topped w/shredded pollo, cheese on a bed of what appeared to be fried tostadas? Was served con arroz y refried beans. It was ok...wouldn't order it again tho, mediocre. Mango margarita, pretty good. So far my impression is that Id come here for the drinks and appetizers...Server took awhile to take my drink order and my appetizer guac took awhile as well to come out. I was refraining from eating up all the complimentary salsa til my guac here to the point where I hope it dsnt come out w/my main dish! ...yup and I was right that the time the guac came out that within minutes my main dish came out =\\ I HATE when that happens!

Saddles might not be the most comfortable seats in the world, but when else do you get to sit on a saddle that swivels?For all of you adventurous eaters out there, you must have the lengua (tongue) tacos. They are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My personal favorite are the cheek tacos. So flavorful and tender! You can choose your protein in most of their dishes, and I usually opt for the cheek. For an entree, you're good with pretty much anything on the menu, but I personally love all of the enchiladas, especially the enmoladas, a sweet and savory dish with chicken. The portions are ginormous and you will likely leave with leftovers. Now let me mention the margaritas. If you're going with a group, opt for the pitcher. It's about $30 and probably contains about six large drinks. \u00a0They are sweet, but not cloying. Perhaps my favorite in the city, and I am a margarita girl. \u00a0Interesting fact: Carlos, the owner, even makes his own tequila! He is super friendly and a delight to talk to.

The enchiladas also came with rice and beans on the side, and the beans in particular were just the best- sort of smoky, very rich. They were potentially my favorite thing I ate at the restaurant. Honestly, I would totally order just rice and beans next time, were it not for all the other tempting options I still want to try. I have my eye on the chimichanga.Unrelated to the food: we came on a Sunday afternoon and easily found a parking spot on the street right around back. I am not sure if we were just lucky, but it seems like you're bound to find a spot if you just drive around those residential streets right behind the restaurant."], ["Constance G.", "Really, Yelp? Really? I saw how many positive reviews and stars this place got and wanted to try it out. I picked up my yoga pants and bib from the cleaners and headed on down to Providence. My anticipation was high. Sky high. Now here's where some Yelp realness comes in. In the amount of time it took us to place our orders and receive our food, I could have hopped a plane to Mexico City. Or taken a cruise! Even a nice little cruise to Mexico City. My chimichanga came without the guacamole listed on the menu because they ran out but didn't bother mentioning it. Ok, fine. I love guacamole more than most people but I let it slide. Let me just slather this baby with some salsa. But when you tell me there's no more fried ice cream.... GIRL, BYE."], ["Jennifer E.", "El Rancho Grande is another one of the amazing, authentic Mexican restaurants that graces our fair city. \u00a0If you've been to any of the other restaurants in the area, you know that sometimes you have to travel to the not-so-nice parts of town to get the best food. \u00a0I myself am willing to risk life and limb for a good taco. Well, all jokes aside, ERG is really one of the best Mexican places in town. \u00a0The restaurant itself is pretty small, and feels particularly tiny when packed on a weekend night. \u00a0They have a small bar with some stools and several tables, but when we did have to wait, it didn't take all that long to grab a table (it's just awkward when you aren't the only group of people waiting around for a table). \u00a0The margaritas are pretty tasty and they have a couple of Mexican cervezas on draft. \u00a0There menu offers all of the traditional choices such as burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas, but they also have some specialty dishes that sounded yummy and also daily specials that are listed on their chalkboard. \u00a0I highly recommend the fish and shrimp tacos but I had a very delicious Al Pastor taco as well. \u00a0Three tacos were enough to fill me up.It's a tough choice between ERG and nearby Chilangos but El Rancho Grande is definitely up there in terms of food quality, service and price. \u00a0I will definitely return, many times, in the future when I have the hankering for some real Mexican cuisine (NOT tex-Mex)."], ["Linda A.", "I visited on taco Tuesday, so of course, I can't say that I tried a wide variety of items. Still a very positive experience -- the small restaurant is cute and has an authentic, yet slightly hipster vibe. The bathroom was a little dirty and smelled funny, so I touched as little as possible. Ok, the food... The chips and salsa were super tasty. The chips were crunchy and sturdy, the salsa thick with a strong kick of cilantro. I tried the tacos: barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and pork butt. The last of which was my least favorite, to my surprise. The others were super flavorful and delicious. The tacos are on corn tortillas (I prefer flour, but ok) with little more than the meat present -- some onions and cilantro topped each with a wedge of lime. They aren't your Taco Bell supreme tacos. Ask for extras if you're expecting them. My partner said the chicken was a bit dry, but I didn't try them for myself. I look forward to trying more items as well as the desserts. The prices were super reasonable, too!"], ["Ben T.", "Food is great and staff is nice. Only complaint is if you go during dinner time except at least a thirty minute wait in a small crowed waiting area."], ["Portia J.", "I ordered in from this placed based on recc. that I received from a cute guy last weekend. I ordered the Nachos con Todo y Pollo with (which was a horrible idea because anything that is supposed to be crispy and hard turns into soft mush inside Styrofoam) the Camarones appetizer which came with this terrible bleu cheese-esque sauce and I really wasn't satisfied. The chicken was oddly seasoned. I have no idea what was on it. Will try again, will eat in on location."], ["Sungeeta A.", "Two words: QUESO FUNDIDO! I had this for the first time about a year ago and haven't stopped dreaming about it since. Smooth, melted cheese mixed with Pablano peppers (or Chorizo if you please) and served with tortilla chips - heaven! \u00a0It was just as good the second time I went.Everything else about this restaurant, including the entrees, drinks, service and prices, are also solid. They also have a wide variety of offerings - the last time I went there they had pork belly tacos as a special, which were delicious. \u00a0This place definitely gets crowded, though, so I recommend going early to get a table."], ["William K.", "My brother told me about this place. \u00a0This place is great. \u00a0I have no complaints. \u00a0All meals come with nachos and a little dish of a green salsa. \u00a0It is always delicious and fresh. \u00a0I think it has jalapenos for a little heat.I've had this tasty cheese app. \u00a0It is a bowl of melted mild white cheese topped with a sausage. \u00a0Comes with a bowl of nachos. \u00a0Very tasty.Chimichangas with carnitas is the bomb. \u00a0You can get chipotle cream sauce or another cream sauce to top. \u00a0It comes with a nice pile of shreded iceberg with guac, refried beans and rice for sides. This meal is $8.00 and it is a large portion of food. \u00a0 The Taco de Playa are pretty tasty. \u00a0It has avocado, tomato, lettuce, corn, and diced shrimp.Rojo o Verde. \u00a0It's not the name, it's the choice. \u00a0Red or green? \u00a0Both are the ground corn with pork inside cooked in a corn husk.I had both. \u00a0I think the green better. \u00a0Both are good.They have a full bar. \u00a0A nice selection of imported sodeys. \u00a0A very large selection of tequila. \u00a0I drank a LOT of Corralejo (very smooth) when in Mexico. \u00a0They have it.Highway acess is less than 1 minute."], ["Evan V.", "With those tiny, little hands of hers, Maria sure does make some slammin' mole.The guac is without question the best in the area, whipped up fresh and frequently.The only downside for me is something that was only revealed sometime AFTER my fifth (and unfortunately final) dinner date here. \u00a0Many of the seemingly meat-free dishes still make extensive use of some serious animal byproducts\u00a0- namely lots and lots of lard. \u00a0Which would certainly explain the exceptional flavor (sorry, but it is true).There is no questioning the authenticity of these dishes, which are rushed straight from the kitchen to your table, despite the bizarrely placed mini-stairway that leads up to the prep area - which is pretty wild."], ["Ben V.", "Waiting 40 minutes for few apps. And when we ask why it was taking so long she said it takes time to make quesadillas. -_- \u00a0I was hoping a manager would walk around and ask how is everytging going but clearly theres no management. \u00a0we left 20 percent tip but it wasn't the waitress fault it took so long for basic food. \u00a0Overrated."], ["Emma Z.", "This is my go to place in Little Rhody! Be sure to order multiple dishes, if the dish is cheap its not a lot of food. My favorite appetizer is the queso fundido, it a Mexican cheese fundo topped with green peppers! I always stick with getting a chicken quesadilla frita. very cheap and a good bang for your buck!"], ["Richie S.", "What more can I say, but the best taco I've ever had was at this place! My fianc\u00e9 and I haven't been in awhile so we are well overdue to go again soon. The margaritas are outstanding and very reasonably priced compared to most other places. Now let me get back to the tacos, they have quite a variety but the one that I loved the best was the pork with caramelized onions and pineapple....so good!!"], ["Aia T.", "Pollo ala americana is great. Pina coladas were delicious!! Cabacitas are not so great hence my 4star review :( service is okay. Servers are friendly but forgot to fill our water and just noticed it towards the end. Guacamole, salsa, and pico de gallo are awesome!!! Salsa is better than the one in Chilangos actually.

This is not a fancy place. This is a place for people who want a super filling meal and is feelin' some Mexican. Food was good. My friend got taquitos and a salad. I got pez. Both very good. Bill came out to be around $35. Very good service. My water was always refilled and the guy was very quick with our check and anything that we needed. Very clean. Cute hand painted chairs and pinatas hanging around. Probably will come again. Great place for hangover meals."], ["Shahina G.", "Great management and always friendly service. I recommend the \"viva la margarita\" mango flavor and the Mexican style steak which is my fave!"], ["Sarah C.", "This place is pretty good. Their decor is fun and inviting, and I think they have a back patio area? The chourizo burrito I got was yummy. But seriously, what is with the no free chips and salsa that I see happening at almost all of the Mexican restaurants I go to nowadays? Are they really losing that much money by offering those items for free?"], ["Beth J.", "Love this place! The fajitas are the best. The nicest staff & totally casual.

Everything was there but the flavor. \u00a0Everything just tasted like mush in my mouth with no \"sabor\". \u00a0The salsa verde was the only saving grace which I doused everything with. \u00a0 The servers were all hanging out at the bar and the hostess was on her phone when we walked out. She didn't acknowledge us or say good night. The middle aged dude who was bussing was the only person working hard in the front of the house.

The guacamole was fresh, and the vegetarian burrito and taco salad were also very tasty. Our waitress was very friendly and atmosphere is friendly and laid back. Would highly recommend!"], ["Ashley J.", "I'm not even sure I want to give them one star but I felt really bad for the waiter. Got there at 5:15 before the Bruins game so we would have plenty of time to eat. There was a table of about 50 people then just a couple other full tables. It took us about 10 minutes to get drinks then another 10 to get the chips and guacamole. They were good. It then took another 15 minutes to even order dinner. We started realizing as the place starting filling up that our waiter was the ONLY waiter. Just him and a bartender and the bar was full. We ordered our food and waited for about 30-35 minutes. We waited so long that the waiter apologized 3-5 times to us saying that the kitchen was backed up due to the big table of people at the front. It seemed as though that tables order got put in before the entire restaurant. People were getting up and leaving left and right. No one was eating just all sitting with blank faces on. When the food finally got there it was embarrassing, you could tell it was just thrown together quickly. We barely even ate it. We of course were charged full price for everything. I spent $50 with a tip, were there for an hour and a half and we didn't get into the game until 6:50. It was an awful experience. A Sunday at 530 across from the dunk, the night of a Bruins preseason game and one waiter? That's just stupid business."], ["Steven G.", "Food is great. \u00a0Horchata is amazing. \u00a0Ask for a White Mexican if you're at the bar. \u00a0It involves Horchata. \u00a0Nuff said."], ["Emily D.", "Avoid this place at all costs.We stopped in before a show at Lupo's. I ordered a chimichanga, my boyfriend ordered a burrito. I found a massive piece of dimply, rubbery, fatty chicken skin in my chimichanga, as well as 3 or 4 pieces of dark meat that were so dark they looked rancid. The chicken wasn't only bland and mostly flavorless, it just plain tasted bad. My boyfriend's burrito wasn't so good either. The rice that came with my meal was fresh and good, though. I ordered a Coco-Rita without salt and it came with salt. Whatever. But the drink just tasted like salt and sour mix. Not good at all. The bill was more than $30 with tip for the 2 entrees and one crappy drink. I was sure I was going to get food poisoning, but luckily I did not, at least. Awful."], ["Paul J.", "The food was good but I stopped in on a Tuesday evening and the place was dead. Wait staff was prompt and friendly. Prices were reasonable. Probably a better place for lunch than dinner. It's also a smaller venue so I'd probably cross this off my Cinco-De-Mayo list as its in the heart of downtown and probably gets slammed."], ["J R.", "Yummy, fresh salsa with homemade chips and ice cold Modelo... That already is a win! \u00a0The guacamole was amazing the meals were served quickly and everything was fresh and homemade. \u00a0I tried the goat and was reminded of a time many years ago... Amazing job chef! \u00a0 It was an excellent culinary experience for anyone who enjoys cantina style dining."], ["Bob S.", "Rather bland. Not real Mexican food. Ordered pulled pork and it looked like Chicken. Really sucks they charge for nachos and dip. We will not be back again."], ["Kevin N.", "Not our first time there but possibly our last. From entering the door till we exited the staff was more concerned with watching a soccer game. Service was standard at best. Food was good but without service, we did not enjoy.

Very good food and service for sure! I had the taco salad and it was one of the best ones I've had at any local Mexican establishments. You have to try their guacamole. My wife had the burrito regular and thought it was great as well.Highly recommended!"], ["Isabel B.", "I'll start by saying that my husband is from Mexico and we love authentic Mexican food! This is by far the best in the area and one of the best we've been to in the country! Order the Milanese torta or the chicken enchiladas. The green sauce is to die for. We go at least once a week and cannot get enough of this place!"], ["Vilay S.", "There are actually not many breakfast spots Downtown, and what people don't realize that is that Viva Mexico is a decent place for take-out or sit in for breakfast. I work downtown and I often call in an order for pickup both on weekends or weekdays. The Mexican Breakfast menu is the shit. Chilaquiles with sunny side up eggs, avocado slices, and refried beans means I won't be hungry til dinner. Total with tax and tip is around $10. The Mexican breakfasts come with sides of tortillas and beans, while there is an \"American Breakfast\" menu that offers toast and home fries.Sometimes the service can be spotty - I'm not even sure what time they truly open, and other times if it's too early you will be put on hold as they call over someone who speaks adequate English. The breakfast burrito used to be $3 if you paid cash, but now it's $4 or $5 so you get the idea. Get your confirmation if you have questions about times and prices because you can't really go by the takeout menu or online menu."], ["Meredith O.", "The service was very slow. \u00a0The prices were very reasonable and the food was so-so. \u00a0I would've been fine but we were all still eating when the owner came over and asked us to move tables so a large party could be seated. \u00a0Maybe I'm wrong but I didn't think that was ok to do. \u00a0So basically we paid the bill and left. \u00a0I should've asked to take my unfinished glass of wine off the bill. \u00a0Ironically if our service wasn't molasses we might have already been gone...
