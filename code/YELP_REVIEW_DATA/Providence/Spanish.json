Then we all ordered a different menu item so we could try them all. Chicken fajitas, tortilla soup, pork chimichanga, pork tamale, chicken enchiladas and a stuffed pablano pepper. All the dishes came with guac, sour cream, refried beans and rice. Everything was DELICIOUS and seasoned well. One person in our party said the rice could have used a tad more seasoning.

A must try for a drink is the jalape\u00f1o margarita, very flavorful with an added little kick. The food might be one of the best Mexican I ever had.

The pride that the staff (owner?) takes in the food is obvious so it makes me feel terrible to say that I didn't fall in love. The food was acceptable but I found it bland and lacking in flavor. I wanted more spice, more depth to the dishes and it just wasn't there. I would probably give it a second chance if I was in the neighborhood and low on options."], ["Zach H.", "We stopped at Toro for lunch, intrigued by the inviting atmosphere, and were thoroughly satisfied with our meals.

It's located right over in Olneyville with a lot with plenty of parking across the street. Inside you'll find a converted mill building kind of ambiance with high ceilings, brick, etc.. The cushioned chairs found at the bar and some of the tables are pretty uncomfortable, so brace your bottom for that. Service was more or less quick and friendly.Per my Groupon, I got the \"Bocado Experience\" which includes 2 cheeses, 4 tapas, 1 paella, and 1 order of churros. I also got a cava flight. I'll now review each of these components individually:Cava flight: A great selection of three cavas; 2-3oz pours at 9 dollars and served on a beer flight-esque paddle. I especially liked the rose Cava. It was such a nice start to the night.Queso (2, of your choice): We ordered fried goat cheese and Valdeon. The cheeses come with the usual spanish cheese board acompaniments: membrillo paste (quince), almonds, and a pimento. The whole kit looked nice and tasted even nicer.Tapas (4, of your choice): Tried a selection of tapas. There's quite a few at your disposal, so you're sure to find something that you'd like to eat. Problem is, none of the tapas we had were especially tasty, nor were they bad. Just your standard kind of tapas.Paella: Tried the seafood paella. The mussels and clams tasted extra fishy. We found this pretty interesting because we had a mussels appetizer and had no such problem. Calamari in the paella tasted a little rubbery and we found the whole thing pretty drab. Churros: Tasted of old oil, with notes of cinnamon. Chocolate sauce was pretty tasty though.I probably won't come back for the \"Bocado Experience\".

The hostess Sydney had a very charming smile and guided us to our table immediately. Dave was our waiter and was very diligent, professional and courteous. The menu sizes were very large and occupied all of the table space. He suggested the Bocado Experience for four and he helped us selecting the dishes. He also up-sold the specials which was the watermelon and arugula salad. The charcuterie was phenomenal especially the goat cheese and honey, it was everyone's personal favorite. The board was a bit rocky but the whole charcuterie sharing experience was wonderful. We took a bit of time to select all the eight tapas from the menu but Dave made it easier. As a group we all enjoyed the Whipped roasted garlic, spinach & feta dip with grilled pita bread and the Mussels dish. Some of us even quoted that \" we would come back just to eat the mussels\". However the chicken fritters were not very eye-appealing and lacked flavor. The rest of the tapas were very tasty and the service was quick to begin with. The paella we ordered was Paelle De Carna since we wanted to taste the variety of meats. The rice at the bottom of the pan was not cooked throughly and the whole dish was salty. At this point we were all full and could not really finish the paella. Dave offered to box the paella for us. \u00a0For dessert we had the chorizo and the flan. The chorizo was well fried and was coated with ample sugar however the chocolate sauce was watery. That was the only downfall. The presentation of the flan was simple and clean although it had the density of a cheesecake. As a group we loved the whole tapas bar experience and would love to go again.

My friend and I had done tapas before, my mom and brother hadn't, but we had a groupon, so we were feeling adventurous. Everything was wonderful-- fried goat cheese, octopus, beef carpaccio, mussels, cheese board-- I can't even remember everything I ate, it was such a feast.

On the one hand, it's a really neat space with a vast menu of creative Spanish-style dishes. They have a great prix fixe menu option including meat/cheese, tapas, paella, and churros for dessert.I love Spanish food and I love tapas. With that said, the tapas I tried at Bocado were really hit or miss. The albondigas (meatballs) were quite tasty, with a touch of sweetness from figs and some tang from blue cheese. The blue cheese is assertive, but I like blue cheese so it worked for me. Personally, I love simple Spandish albondigas and don't really need all that extra culinary hoopla. A delicious, moist meatball in sauce is perfect.The croquetas and the \u00a0bola de arroz frito are both tasty fried tapa options. The complimentary sauces were good as well.The braised rabbit was salty and quite frankly the worst rabbit dish I've ever had in my life. And I love rabbit. I was so disappointed. It was my friend's first time trying rabbit and I'm afraid the experience turned her off of rabbit forever, which is unfortunate because rabbit can be really delicious otherwise.The cheese meat options we tried were tasty, and by the time we even got to the paella we ended up taking most of it home, but it was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but a solid effort. I think the menu is perhaps trying too hard to stand out by offering some less traditional tapas, or trying to make the traditional ones too gourmet, but I'll be honest, Spanish food is so delicious just as it is, \u00a0it really doesn't need the bells and whistles. Just good flavors. I would consider visiting Bocado again, but would avoid the rabbit dish like the plague. Otherwise, the meal over all was quite pleasant, although not mind-blowing."], ["Eric K.", "Ok so I have a biased opinion of Spanish food and it is hard to make this review in an objective manor. I was able to travel Spain recently and was able to eat a great amount of Spanish food. Naturally, I was excited to see a local place offering some of the great foods I ate in Spain. However, I was not completely happy with the food I ate. But I would go back and eat it again... and again.This has nothing to do with the how good the food actually is. The food is great, and on top of that the wine and drinks were excellent. I was expecting the Spanish food I ate in Spain, but that is not quite what I got. \u00a0We got the \"Bocado Experience for 2\", which is an incredible deal! The tapas are great, we ordered; Pan con Tomate, D\u00e1tiles Rellenos de Queso de Cabra, Croquetas De Pollo, y Patatas Asadas. Though they were all great, 3 of the 4 disappointed me. The Pan con Tomate had a garlic spread (which was unnecessary there is something simple and fantastic about crushed tomato, bread, salt, and olive oil). Datiles y las Croquestas were plagued by paprika. The Paella we ordered was very well seasoned and tasty, but the squid and the little necks were over cooked. I also didn't care for the chorizo.While this sounds like I was disappointed, Bocado makes up any of these faults in the overall taste, the drinks, and the atmosphere. I think the Spanish wine selection including the cava selection is great. The mixed drinks are of high quality to. We ordered the cava flight and some mixed drinks.Overall, like I said, I would go back, I wouldn't have dinner, just tapas and wine."], ["Stephanie C.", "I got a Groupon for Bocado and decided to go for Valentine's Day.

Exposed brick, loft style and candles on all the tables.Plan out about two hours for this experience and be sure to try the Spanish wine. It's the smoothest wine I've ever had and the service was remarkable. A great date place for a couple or a small group.

To start, the space has a whole industrial chic thing going on with high ceilings, big windows, lots of exposed metal and concrete - but is intimate enough for a little date night action or a small group. The bar (which is longggggg) actually looks nice as well although I feel like most folks grab a table. I also think we got the same server both times - an older white dude who seems to be high on life 24/7.Now, I know they try and get you with the 'experience' deal or I know 850+ people have bought the Groupon deal - but just wing it and order a bottle of wine and try different plates.

Whipped roasted garlic, feta and spinach dip: Your typical spinach dip, on Iberian steriodsLollipop lamb chops: Actually like these cause they're bite sized, they're not overly seasoned and taste like lamb chops right off your backyard grill!We got suckered into some bad sangria cocktail that was $10 a glass (!?!?) and completely meh.

A lot to choose from, but the waitress did \u00a0a great job going through the menu and pointing out her favorites. Third course was a great paella and lastly was a plate of churros.

The place itself is very narrow and the bathrooms are located at the very front of the restaurant where the entrance is. Nice long bar with plenty of seating.The groupon we purchased was for 2 meats/cheeses, 4 tapas, 1 paella and dessert (only one available - churros w/ chocolate dipping sauce). Meats/Cheeses - duck and pork loin, came on a cutting board with bread/spread - both very good. Tapas - calamari, venison, littleneck clams, shrimp burgers (highly recommend!), brussel sprouts (good but not worth the money). Paella - Classic, to me the paella lacked a bit of flavor and I'm not a huge fan of the crusty rice bits but my bf is so I let him have all of that. The churros were way too overly doused with sugar - way too sweet for me. We each had a sangria as well, both were good.

Waitress was very nice, service quick, all the food & drinks were delicious. \u00a0About $100 for 2 people included: bread to start, 2 cocktails, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 coffees."], ["Scott M.", "Overall quite pleasant . Extensive menu and well done . Food was delicious. Decor is interesting and unique indeed.I wish they had more obvious vegan entrees . This was not apparent at first glance of the menu and I hope the restaurant can reflect this as many of us look at menus online before coming to a restaurant . The risotto was made vegan for me which turned out to be good. They had some sorbet dishes for dessert which was splendid . This salads were also quite nice. One other criticism I must make was our waitress . She was too robotic in her questions and quite rushed . We just barely got our appetizer or dinner and within 60 seconds she would rush ton our table \u00a0asking if the food was ok ( we just barely started!) . This waitress needed to give us more time and act a little classier . This isn't Friendly's or Greg's."], ["Brewster L.", "Ate here on a crowded Sat night - 7 in our group.Arrived a few minutes before our reservation and seated promptly. Ordered the calamari, chicken pizza, and walnut brie appetizer. All great. \u00a0Everyone thought their dinners were some of the best they've had. I had the scallops and agree with another reviewer that the risotto didn't live up to the rest of the plate. Wasn't bad, just wasn't in the same league. If I got the scallops again \u00a0might ask for them to be seared an extra 30 seconds/side - I like a little more crust on them. But they were great regardless. Desserts were all great as well. Gary our waiter was great and provided the perfect pace for service."], ["Anze U.", "The experience is incredible! The ambiance is special because of the innumerable pieces of art from around the world, the food engages all the sense, the portions are well balanced and at the end of the meal you leave satiated and in a state of bliss, wanting to return again. P.S. Ask for the smoked apple martini:)"], ["Holly K.", "One word, obsessed! The second I walked into CAV I fell in love. I just loved the decor and atmosphere there, it is really hard to beat! I recently reached out to them about possibly having my rehearsal dinner there I am so obsessed, and their private dining area is gorgeous. We went with a bottle of wine for the table and I really appreciated the variety of options as well as the variety of prices. We had no problem finding an affordable bottle that we all agreed on. I went with their hand cut rolled pasta with ricotta, in a shallot cream sauce. The finace went with the duck two ways dish and ate every bite of it. He preferred the duck breast portion while my friend Laura T who got the same dish preferred the bbq-ish leg. The pear chicken dish was also ordered at the table and was raved about. Basically there was not one thing that we would have changed as far as entrees go.Although the dessert menu looked impressive we all had so many desserts left over from Christmas that we decided to pass. The service was great as well.They have a free parking lot directly across from the restaurant, you really can't beat that in downtown Providence!"], ["Beverly S.", "Update: \u00a0I've been back to CAV So many times now, I cannot even count them. \u00a0THIS is where I take out-of-town guests and it never fails to wow them. \u00a0The food is excellent and always imaginative. \u00a0The decor will blow your mind. \u00a0I want to take everything in there home with me! \u00a0(Actually you can, for a hefty price, so I haven't!)Just go there - you will never regret it. \u00a0Great for lunch and dinner - free parking in a large lot across the street."], ["Hal M.", "Went here for Mothers Day and while I understand that any place is going to be busy on a holiday such as this, that doesn't excuse poor food and sloppy service. It took nearly an hour to get our meals and once it arrived the poached eggs were hard and cold. The bacon was basically raw and the potatoes were undercooked."], ["Katie B.", "Incredible. Really amazing dinner experience, and I do mean that sincerely!I had been wanting to check out CAV for a while. It had been recommended for brunch by a coworker, but somehow I could never fit it in (it is, for the record, somewhat off the beaten path). When my family came to spend the weekend and we were looking for a nice dinner, I decided the time to try CAV had finally come.Everything about this place is adorable. The outside patio area is quintessential Providence - eclectic, with a vintage vibe. Tables with umbrellas on the stone terrace, and trees with the sparkling lights, in an old mill-type building? Gorgeous. We were early for our reservation, so we decided to start with a drink outside. It was lovely - and our service was impeccable (shout-out to Tom for being a great waiter!). Once we ventured inside, the experience just got better. Tom, our waiter, was extremely attentive. He deftly explained the top choices and specialities, and was patient as we made our decisions. Everything was delicious. We started with the Goat Cheese Croquettes, followed by the Sophia salad (highly recommend both). For dinner, three of our party ordered the local-caught Caramelized scallops (all unanimously loved them) while I had the filet mignon. We topped it off with salted caramel gelato, tiramisu and chocolate mouse cake. It's a little pricey, but nothing out of the realm of ordinary for Providence. It's a dress-up-or-casual as you choose type place, which typifies some of my favorite places in Providence. I would recommend CAV to anyone, and will certainly be back."], ["Andria T.", "This restaurant is my new go-to when family and friends come to visit. \u00a0It's always tasty, and I feel like the eclectic decor and menu really sum up what Providence is about. I've never had bad service or bad food, but dinner can get a bit pricey sometimes.It feels a bit like cheating, but I honestly have nothing else to say. \u00a0It's a good restaurant--you should go there."]], "La Sonrisa Restaurant": [["Brandon R.", "Just had some takeout from there. Pork and rice. Awesome food and no shy on portions for 8 buck"], ["Silvia R.", "I will not set foot in this restaurant under any circumstances. Staff is rude, they wiped the counter were they serve the food and dropped the paper towel into the beans, pulled it out and continue serving as if nothing had happen.Their hot oatmeal drink tasted burnt.If you call to order food, good luck because they will still not have it ready when you arrive and make you stand in line (poor customer service at its best!)"], ["Sandra O.", "We ordered one meal for two. 6 of us ate a bit of it and now we are sick from food poisoning! \u00a0Horrible food!"], ["Margaret G.", "I've been eating at La Sonrisa for years. There was a short period of time that I avoided it, the food was not as good as it had been in previous years. I went a week ago and was so happy with it. Rice and beans, chuletas, pernil and a chinola for $7, you can't beat it."], ["Christian V.", "La Sonrisa is a great place to pick up some great-tasting Spanish food on your lunch break or if you're just in the mood for takeout. I can't really recommend anything except everything! Definitely try something new because, like a lot of Spanish and Spanish-influenced cuisine, La Sonrisa's food is bathed in flavour. Their drinks and in-house made juices and smoothies are a great little pick-me-up on those hot summer days and winter nights when you're feeling a little under the weather."], ["Sara F.", "Delicious food at a great price! We love the mofongo con camarones. The portions are huge and we usually take home leftovers. \u00a0Worth a try."], ["Truth Be Tol D.", "This place is fantastic! \u00a0If you're in the mood for some delicious rice and beans, stew chicken and plantains, this is THE SPOT to go. \u00a0This restaurant is CLEAN and it has a dining room if you'd like to stay and eat, or of course you can take your yummy eats to go. \u00a0The ladies are always pleasant and the food is always great!"], ["Philip S.", "This place is called \"La Sonrisa\", so that might explain why there's zero reviews here.This place looks like it wouldn't serve food better than your middle school cafeteria, but looks can be deceiving. The food is actually really good. I tried the Salmon and the mashed/fried green bean dish (sorry, I can't remember the name. It was in Spanish). Both were very nicely prepared. And the portions are huge; I don't think anyone was able to finish their meal here.It's a nice place to eat and catch up with friends."], ["Linda L.", "i just went to with my friend and it was my second time going there and the food is delicious, the service is ok, the first time i felt more welcome than the 2nd time. i order rice &beans with ribs and stewed chicken, their ribs are so tender and delicious overall good flavors and stew chicken was very flavorful and tender. the area is okay more like a take out spot."]], "Red Fin Crudo & Kitchen": [["Kristen T.", "I heard that this place was amazing. I went down with some friends who were here from out of town and I give it a five star rating !! It was a cultural experience to try all kinds of tapas from different regions . I was tasting the food and it was all exceptional !!! our server was knowledgeable and friendly !! We had flavorful desserts. Then we met the owners and tried the soup if the day and sampled a Cuban on fresh pretzel bread! What an experience and so much flavor !! Check this place out !! I'm excited to go back for Sunday Brunch :)"], ["Jim M.", "Went here on a Friday night after we gave up on a table at Providence G Rooftop after 90-minute wait. We were seated in under 5 minutes and the staff was courteous, helpful and pleasant from the moment we walked in the door to the time we left (everyone there said goodnight to us --\u00a0it felt like we were at home). We ordered a bunch of tapas items and all were great. Our favorites were the Brussels sprouts and the cauliflower dishes. Oysters were $1 apiece from 9-11 p.m. and they were fab as well. Will come back."], ["Neal D.", "A new favorite in Providence! Outstanding cocktails, fantastic options for oysters and a creative and well executed menu. We sat down at the bar and were greeted with one of the more friendly and helpful bartenders I've ever encountered. He made fantastic suggestions that really helped us make our decision. Also, they have a daily ceviche special on top of daily cocktail specials! I can not wait to go back."], ["Myesha B.", "Though I am giving a 4 star rating it's between a 3.5-4. I came in on a Tuesday around 6:30 with some classmates to do a class project. We were seated immediately in the bar area, our waiter came and greeted us soon after and informed us of the beverage and food specials for the day. Took our drink orders right after. 2 of my partners ordered the raspberry iced tea which they said was really good. When we ordered our food we started off with the croquetas de jamon. There were 4 of us at the table and received an order of 3 croquetas. They were very good and full of flavor though it would have been nice to know that there would be 3 in an order so we could either decide to order another tapa in addition to the croquetas or just order something else with more food. After the tapa was cleared from the table it took about 20 minutes for our food to come out which is a good amount of time to wait. One of my partners ordered the Red Fin Salad which she said was delicious and the greens were fresh. One ordered the mussels which she said were fresh and had a smokey flavor to them and the cilantro and salsa verde was very good though there wasn't any pickled jalape\u00f1o. The plantain chips were green plantains which were bland and were placed on top of the mussels mainly as a garnish. Another partner of mine ordered the fried chicken with braised greens and cornbread with some sauce on top. The cornbread was slightly over baked so it was hard to cut through with the fork and knife. The sauce was hidden but also didn't taste that good. Then braised greens were delicious and the best thing on the plate. The chicken was NOT seasoned and simply hard to eat, she took one bite out of the chicken and couldn't finish it. It was like the chicken was battered in something unseasoned. And I ordered the paella without the clams and mussels. Ahead of placing my order I asked which did our waiter prefer the baca Frits our the paella and he informed me that they were sold out of the steak which would have been nice to know ahead of time. But before coming here I seen a picture of it on the app and thought it looked delicious, I was disappointed by it unfortunately. The rice base used for it had no flavor at all, the chicken was bland and the chorizo was dry and not the best but had some flavor. I personally do not like to add salt and pepper to my dishes when I go to a restaurant but it was needed. I had to wait 5-10 minutes for our servers I come back to our table and ask how everything was to get salt and pepper. After dinner we ordered desserts. We split 2 of them and ordered the triple sin chocolate cake and the brownie sundae. They were both good but the scoop of gelato that accompanied the brownie was tiny as heck for the big piece of brownie. The check took forever to come because it seemed as if they were under staffed and our server was waiting tables as well as working the bar. At one point while waiting for the bill the bar wasn't busy and we expected him to deliver the check but got nothing. We waited about 10-15 minutes for the check. While waiting he greeted a table next to us and introduced himself to the table of men (which he didn't with us) and took their drink orders. After he brought us our checks we made sure to give him the money before he left again. The restaurant is beautiful from the area we saw because we weren't offered a table around the corner away from the bar. Our waiter was nice and friendly though knowing his name would have been helpful. One of the owner's came out and brought us our food though you wouldn't know it was her unless you have visited the website or have been there before. She came and left quickly to go back to the kitchen. It was nice to be able to tell that she was working and helping the BOH and FOH. Though a couple of the entrees weren't that good I would like to go back for the octopus tapa and maybe more or hopefully their Sunday brunch"], ["Nathanyle P.", "I give it a 3stars great! Great! Service my boyfriend and I sat at the bar. And was greeted right away by the bartender taking drink orders. We got the chicken wings special which was in my opinion under cooked and over breaded. We proceeded to get the paella which had chunks of well saffron sliced chicken, mussels, little necks, and rice. The shellfish unfortunately was a little sandy. And I did not taste much saffron in the whole dish. Overall service was great. The food was good but not outstanding like expected. So it deserves an average score."], ["George S.", "STOP reading my review and get over there already. This place is VERY VERY good.
