Luckily I didn't have far to go because of their complimentary valet service. \u00a0My meal during restaurant week was especially enjoyable. I chose the carpaccio for an appetizer and was blown away - it was covered in truffle oil!! Seriously, can it get any better? Not really, but the entree came close. I got the Pacific Sea Bass, which is one of the best fish entrees I've had to date. The previous time I came I got the Pork Loin Valdostana - also an incredible dish \u00a0but very heavy. Be prepared to do nothing for the rest of the day if you get that dish.

And though it has fallen down the list a bit -- a result of many high-quality, upscale restaurants that have opened through the years as part of the city's renaissance -- Capriccio's hasn't missed a beat.We began our dining experience with an assortment of appetizers that included a rich and generous lobster bisque, gently cooked calamari, and a grilled mozzarella caprese rich with the flavor of fresh herbs and prosciutto -- all fabulous. For my entree, I wisely selected the Veal Oscar which \u00a0was smothered in a rich Hollandaise sauce and littered with tasty lobster chunks. Exceptional. And my wife raved about the Beef Bourguignonne Risotto, a personal favorite, not often seen on local menus.But before you pack the younglings in the mini van, two bits of advice. First, the restaurant prides itself on fine leisurely dining -- don't be in a hurry or have other plans. And second, don't forget your credit card -- \u00a0Capriccio's can be expensive.So if you can afford my advice, enjoy Capriccio's at its own pace, soak in the old-world ambiance, and enjoy the attentive table side service whenever you can. It is a uniquely Providence experience."], ["Josh S.", "The atmosphere was cool, brick basement with old world charm. We were surprised to see the prefix menu as restaurant week was over. It looked good and had the apps we were going to order before we saw it so we ordered from it.Even though we added extra apps and bought wine, I knew we were sunk by the waiters expression. My scallops were good, but the chicken dish my wife had was pretty terrible. If nobody wants to cook or serve the prefix menu, take it down. Our bill was still around $200, probably what we would have spent otherwise as we wouldn't have added apps and not ordered dessert in the same place we dine. With so many great places to eat in providence I would encourage the wait staff to be respectful of where people choose to offer their palate and worry less about an extra $5.00 tip from a more expensive entr\u00e9e."], ["Jill M.", "Top of the line all the way!!!

The famed Sole imported from Holland did not disappoint, the meuni\u00e8re sauce was rich... the fish tender (could have been served warmer however).I was a bit disappointed by the side dish offerings, as well as my friends meal (lobster in vodka sauce over cappellini which was all overcooked, lobster tough... again food not warm).

The wine list is impressive.The food, however, is simply mediocre. The pork loin I ordered was very oily and bland. The portion was huge, which might count as a plus for some but not for me. I ordered al dianto riso as appetizer which was pretty good, though.

I rate 5 stars for the food, but the service was another story. I felt as though our waitress was very stern, and serious with us. She was not very friendly or sociable at all.

The maitre D was a slightly rude to me and my party, perhaps because we were in our 20's, which irked me a little. He even came to pour us water later on when we were eating, but reached right in front of the plate while I was eating without excusing himself and poured - he also never resopnded every time we said \"thank you\". Our server, however, was very friendly and knew exactly what he was doing. He was respectful and made up for the service problems. The food came in good time, and it was amazing. I had the mussels with white sauce (very fresh) - a little too much butter, but I'm not complaining about that. For my entree, I had the pork loin stuffed with cranberries and spinach and it was much better than I expected. The pork was perfectly cooked, juicy, and the fat-lean content was just right. The potatoes were roasted slow and were seasoned very well. For dessert, I had the panna cotta - smooth, clean, and perfect after a large and satisfying meal. The berries that came with the panna cotta were lack-luster, but did help to cut into the sweetness."], ["Grace F.", "WOW!!! This place is crazzzy!! Went here for lunch and it was so awesome. Firstly the decor is beautiful, I went to the ladies room and the stall was like a fancy bat cave, no lie! The walls are like a cave. The waiter was so authentically Italian, he was super nice what a gentleman. The lunch was a pre-fix for like 16 bucks. I had a bowl ( a bowl!) of potato squash soup. My friends entree was the veal parm, I had the crispy eggplant lasagna, I took photos check out the portions!! For dessert I had the tiramisu , to die for! I had a Cosmo, my pal had a margarita, we finished dessert with expresso and coffee, this crazy spectacular lunch cost us less than 65 bucks.

The waiter was nice enough to visit all sides of the table to list specials and answer questions without yelling and disturbing other guests. Every course came out at once, even the table side options were timed perfectly.

We hadn't been in a few years because the last few times it had been a so-so experience but this night made up for it for sure and we will be back. We started with some drinks at the bar. They have a really nice bar - just wish it were larger and they used to have entertainment but I don't think they do that any more. We were sat on time for our reservation. Service was very good. Food was good although they seemed to have switched the temps of my husbands and my meat where he got veal medium rare and I got steak well done. The waiter was quick to remedy the situation. And brought out all new sides as well. It was worth the wait. In addition we must have mentioned it was our bday and he brought out a small cake for the table and bought us a round of drinks for the inconvenience. Very classy Capriccios, thanks for the memories and we will surely be back."], ["Jessica D.", "My boyfriend and I had a great experience last night going out for my birthday. Everything was great from the dimmed lighting and look of the restaurant to the food and service we received. Initially we were going to just order off of the restaurant week pre fixe menu but after hearing the specials we thought otherwise. I had a blackened squid ink pasta with an tomato arabiata sauce with clams, mussels, bay scallops and squid. It was amazing the sauce wasn't as spicy as expected but all the flavors we're excellent. Although I think I may have liked my boyfriend's dish better which was lamb sliced into 3 tender pieces in a blueberry port wine sauce and mashed potatoes. Phenomenal. I definitely enjoyed the large variety of wine available to us as well. All the servers we're very pleasant and attentive to us, a very professional look to the service. To top of the night we both had martinis the Chocolate Cupcake and the White Chocolatini. So sweet and very well made. We had these alongside our desert which was crepes made tableside and flambe'd, it's a nice touch that you don't see at many restaurants. It is a pricey restaurant but everything is worth it, if you are going to go out somewhere special Cappriccios is a great choice."], ["Terry L.", "This is our 2nd time going here and will certainly not be our last. They offer free valet parking which makes it very easy and we love not having to worry about where we will park. You have to walk down stairs into the restaurant. The service is impeccable. Men wear tuxedos and really know there stuff. We sat not far from a fireplace which was nice. The atmosphere is very nice. We loved the food....our friend got the shrimp Flambe which they make by your table and that was impressive. The gnochi is the best I've ever had and the sauce is by far the best I've tasted. My husband got surf and turf and loved it and other friend got steak of some sort which he enjoyed. A nice night out!"], ["Norma O.", "What a disappointmentWhere do I begin to address what was wrong with my dining experience at Capriccio. \u00a0I am a RI native now living in DC but visiting the area with a friend who wanted to experience some authentic Italian cuisine. \u00a0Capriccio was always a wonderful choice for that. \u00a0I have dined all over the world at some of the best restaurants and was excited to show off a home town favorite.  We arrived for our reservation on time and were seated in the corner which surprised me since the restaurant was mostly empty. \u00a0 Our waiter arrived as soon as we sat down and the first words out of his mouth were \"do you need me to take that away from you\". \u00a0This was addressed to my dining partner who had her phone in her hand but was not on the phone. \u00a0She was somewhat confused by his comment and then he followed with, \"you don't want to get my second reminder\" He then gave us menus and walked away. The tone of the evening was set. \u00a0My dining partner, a surgeon who had checked on a patient while we valet parked the car, was completely taken aback by the rudeness of our waiter. \u00a0She was not on her phone, there was no talking to disrupt the other diners, \u00a0she simply had the phone in her hand and was putting it away. The rest of the evening was no different. Our waiter rushed though the specials barely returned to the table to ask if we were enjoying our meal and forget about refilling our glasses with our $100+ bottle of wine. \u00a0The only enjoyable part of the evening was the food. It was delicious but in no way made up for the atmosphere our waiter created. \u00a0Our waiter was condescending, abrupt and his behavior was completely unacceptable. Maybe our waiter thought that since we were two women dining together he didn't have to put in any effort. Clearly we know he could since we both witnessed him showering the nearby tables with attention. An embarrassing representation of dining at a highly rated RI restaurant."], ["H.j.

This is our new \"fancy\" restaurant."], ["Jessica B.", "I went with my husband on a Friday night. The place is very romantic and beautiful inside. The food was good not amazing but I'm more disappointed in the service part of it. I didn't expect to have such an un-attentive waiter. Observing the restaurant, every waiter just looked as though they were on point, enthusiastic about the menu and all about servicing their customers. We went early so we were probably the youngest couple in there at the time around 6:30ish. I'm not sure if it was done on purpose because we are young and they don't think we go out much but we got the newer waiter. He had trouble reciting the menu which is fine, I wasn't upset about that but he seemed to start to disappear from the middle of the dinner. The Burrata cheese appetizer was melt in your mouth good it came with a roasted pear and was just so delicious. My husband got the Beef Wellington which he loved and ate everything although the waiter forgot about his side dish. I got the Truffle Veal dish which I was happy with but not blown away. My side of pasta came as I was finishing my meal and by then I was all set. The worst part of it was he asked if we wanted dessert and I said yes so he hands me the menu and I'm pretty sure he is supposed come out with a tray of what they have or at least a description. Well he never came back. We waited 15 minutes and he was nowhere in sight so we asked another waited to find him and he said he'd be right over.Another 15 minutes later he finally comes over and we ask for the check, mind you no apologies for disappearing or what's worse not even mentioning anything about me wanting dessert! I did notice he coincidentally waited on the other 2 young couples in the restaurant which I think proves my point. It was just sad because it was MY first time eating there and I thought I was going to be wowed by service especially when all around me the waiters seemed so passionate about the food there. Oh well back to the Hill we go I suppose."], ["Sarah C.", "Delicious Italian food and romantical atmosphere. Also, their 3-course, $15.95 lunch cannot be beat.

Perhaps I got ahead of myself when I was picturing Pauly Walnuts and Chris-tu-fuh in a super-elegant Italian joint, but, well... I was. This IS Providence and this IS Capriccio, after all. I did see a few ladies in glittery dresses and ill-fitting soes, and I did see a few big guys with thick accents, and I did have my vino poured by a charming man from Sorrento, but did I feel the magic? Not so much. Our waiter was new, and seemed very nervous. There were a ton of specials in addition to the massive 50,000-page menu, which was slightly overwhelming. I decided to play it safe and go with the Black Angus strip steak. It was presented beautifully, but it was a tad over-cooked and tasted heavily of char. The accompanying mashed taters were scrumps, and the sauce was perfect. What I really loved about Capriccio was the building - really beautiful, charming and old city PVD. The restaurant is in the lower level, and the exposed brick floors have a thick glaze over them that ads such elegance. All of the waiters (no waitresses, please note) are dressed in sharp tuxedos and look as neat as a pin. They even come flambe certain items table-side, which is so old-school I can't even stand it. I wish I had ordered the shrimp, as the man at the table next to me did, so that I could get a fron-row seat and what smelled like a divine meal. Next time!"], ["Melanie M.", "I had gone to Capriccio years ago and have never been back. My husband and I used to go there often to listen to jazz music downstairs and enjoy appetizers, etc. A few years later my husband surprised me with dinner there and later a show. I ordered a filet mignon. I ordered it medium rare. It was very well done. It was so awful I had to drown it in steak sauce just to eat the small amount I ate. A $50 piece of steak was ruined and I never went back. Too bad because I love great steak but sadly I have no desire to eat there again."], ["Bryan H.", "If you like being harassed by wait staff this is the place for you. took my gf here after work both in suits, and was told by the wait staff to remove my beanie I was wearing since it is winter and all.

I will make sure this place is not an option for our clients and future business gatherings after this experience."], ["Brian D.", "Capriccio is both the most expensive and best fine dining experience I have had. I was in Providence for a work conference and was invited with a group to dinner at this fine restaurant. From arriving at the eatery, I was blown away by the ambiance and class of the place. You definitely need to dress it up. After a few drinks at the bar, our group was brought to a private room. The room was elegant and the waiters were fantastic with an eye for top service. Our group (20 of us) ordered one of every appetizer so I got to sample all of them. I especially liked the smoked salmon and mushrooms. For dinner, I went with the recommendation of our driver which was the Osso Bucco. It was fantastic and maybe the best piece of veal I have ever eaten. The wine list was extensive and all the one's I sampled were excellent. I was happy that I was not paying the check.I definitely recommend Capriccio for a fine dining experience. It is pricey but well worth the money in my book.

It's one of the classier restaurants in Providence. The food is solid, but nothing spectacular, especially for the price. I'd much prefer spending a little more and getting something truly special in NYC. The horrible part about Capriccio is its consistently condescending service each and every time. Maybe it's because we're young, 20 year olds, who are not necessarily in a suit (but we do dress appropriate for the occasion). But it doesn't matter. No matter who walks into your restaurant is your customer, and each should be treated properly. \u00a0At the end of the evening, we are still paying as anyone else in the restaurant, and you're providing a service to me. If Robuchon in Paris, Caprice in Hong Kong, and Le Bernardin in NYC can provide personable and respectful service to us young college students, I'd expect Capriccio to as well. But no. On Valentine's Day last year, we made a reservation well in advance. When we got there, we were told that our table is not ready (which is fine, considering it's probably one of the busiest nights of the year), and for us to take a seat at the bar. Sure. That's until when I see multiple parties (of 2 as well) who walk in after us get seated immediately while I'm relegated to the bar with zero attention for AN HOUR. Not to mention, once we're seated after many complaints, our server seemed to think it's fine to ignore us as well. This week, thinking that last time was just a one-off thing, we decided to give Capriccio another shot given the Restaurant Week deal. We called in an hour ahead to ask if there's space for lunch, and they said yes and we left our name. Sounds to me like a reservation. When we showed up, the extremely rude maitre d promptly told us that he doesn't see our name and that there's nothing he could do about since they're full at the moment. Not a single apology, even after I started getting pissed off and telling him this is absolutely unprofessional. With that, I will never visit Capriccio again. Truly, who do you think you are? I'm a paying customer at the end of the day and I don't need your arrogance and condescension. Plus, the food isn't anything special."], ["Lars L.", "This is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants.The price is on the high side, so be ready to pay. \u00a0However, it is worth every penny.The service is top-notch. \u00a0Great place for a date or special occasion. \u00a0Also, I good place to go with old friends and hang out in a relaxed, non-rushed environment.EVERYTHING on the menu is incredible. \u00a0Osso Bucco USED to be my favorite, but they discontinued it. \u00a0I am sure the desserts are great, but we never have room because the serving sizes are so large.Call ahead and make a reservation."], ["Kris D.", "A NYE tradition, dinner at Capriccio's! We have been delighted by many dinners here and we always have a fantastic experience every time. The service is impeccable, our server even went the extra step & offered to take a picture of us after dinner near a holiday decorated area to remember our evening. I try to order something new even if it is just a special appetizer. Last night I treated myself to the Foie gras appetizer. It lived up to the hype. The 4 complex levels of each savory bite started my dinner off with extremely high expectations. \u00a0Of course with every visit at least one person in our party will order the Flambe not only because the taste is out of this world but we look forward to seeing Enzo the flambe chef, he completes the night with his expertise and interesting table talk. \u00a0He told us last night he had been Capriccio's flambe chef for 40 yrs! In a city that is filled with what seems to be trendy fine dinning establishments Capriccio's still stands out as a indulgent classic dinning experience."], ["Matthew R.", "I guess its time to leave Urbanspoon and join Yelp like everyone else! Here goes.I haven't been to Capriccio's in a long time. We had a $100 gift certificate so decided to go this past Wednesday. It was nearly empty when we arrived at 6:30 (had booked through open table) and it remained dreadfully slow the whole evening.First the good news, the food! And really, that's what is all about. We ordered the special cheese app with some beets and prosciutto. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. I ordered the beef wellington and my girlfriend ordered the scallops and risotto. Both were delicious. The meat was cooked well and the wellington was accompanied with some flavorful potatoes. We ordered a nice bottle of Venetian wine and that was also fantastic. Too full for dessert.The ambiance of the place hasn't changed in years and is certainly not for everyone as it can seem a bit impersonal and stuffy. However, those things are non-issues for me. They still do some table side service, which can be a nice touch when going out for an expensive meal. One of the waiters cut my wellington into perfect portions.Our problem, was not with the service (per se) or the food. About 5 minutes after our wine was poured and before we ordered any food, the valet came to our table to inform us that our car had been hit in the parking lot. There was no major damage, but we were outside dealing with police and the other driver for 45 minutes or so. When we returned it was as if nothing happened, with our wine still on the table. I had informed our waiter of the situation before we had gone outside. Ok, so we eat and enjoy our dinner. Now recall, our car was hit in their lot after their valet parked my car. \u00a0I really anticipated a comp of some sort. Nothing major, a free app, free dessert.

(I guess that is a good middle.)- Last time I checked this is suppose to be a hooka place, not a club.- It felt like a trashy cramped club.

It is a bit loud, as they have music playing and everyone tries to talk over the music and then the next thing you know you can barely hear yourself think. This may bother some people, but honestly we adapted.The owner seems keen on keeping up with emerging trends and technologies, as they even offer a free beer or glass of wine for Yelp Check Ins, which is not the reason we came here but was certainly a plus. Also, I believe she even visited our table and was extremely friendly to us and our daughter. They serve you bread with specialty local cheeses and olive oil from the owners grove in Greece. The olive oil was a hair salty but paired well with the fresh baked bread.The waitstaff was quite friendly, although I felt they seemed a bit rushed. The food also seemed to take longer than expected. But I will say, once the appetizer (we tried the fried dough) and meals we delivered, they were well worth the wait. The portions were very fair, especially the kids meal. Our meals were not too much that we had any to take home, but not too little where you did not feel full. Just right.

LolWe both loved the drinks there and wish I remember their names, they were the specials of the day, mango mojitos & watermelon with grey goose, both very good, however, the bartenders weren't using any measuring cups, the drinks weren't very consistent, some stronger some weaker! But in general we still love them!They had buffet bruschetta bar, and omg, all the bruschetta toppings were so delicious! Sun dried tomato sauce, blue cheese white sauce, white hummus, rabi etc... Everything tastes delicious! For entrees, we had jumbo shell pasta filled with cheese which was absolutely yummy, I'm not a big fan of cheese but this jumbo shell wasn't heavy at all! The fillings was so fluffy and tasty! I love their sfogliatelle better, this Italian pastry was original and totally blew me away!!! So yummy!!! I hope they do serve them daily because I'm obsessssssed!! Tony, the owner drove all the way to NYC to get the best cheesecakes just for the event for us!! \u00a0The cheesecake was one the best New York cheesecakes I have ever tried but I wish it was original made in the restaurant but I totally adore his hard work for us!! \u00a0Btw the decor there is so chic and urban, I love it!!!!

The positives....Absolutely love the atmosphere and style of restaurant. It's not your big stuffy dining room but rather a smaller neighborhood spot with an urban chic vibe. Excited to see a place like this in Prov. Menu a plus too..not trying to hard yet interesting options and diverse...can get pastas, fish, steak, pork. Something for everyone but not overwhelming. Homemade and fresh. And why we won't go back...service and food that didn't live up. Busy Sat night, full restaurant, and we had reservations. Ended up sitting at bar as we sometimes prefer that and sadly the service was non existent. Bartenders barely acknowledged us, wouldn't make eye contact, took forever to finally ask \"what do you want?\", put a drink and food in front of us, and never came back. And when there was interaction it was as we were a bother. No excuse...service is everything. There for an hour with empty glasses for half of it and since no eye contact never got another drink. Even as we were leaving the bartender was walking towards us and no \"thanks..have a good night\" just a miserable look on his face avoiding us...umm thanks! Then the food...read great things about the not-your-typical calamari...should have been called Celery& Peppers salad, as it was flavorful it was about 1/8 calamari and 7/8 celery and peppers. Paid $10 for a chopped up piece of celery. Got the swordfish which was very good but a tiny piece and asked for salad instead of the carbs and my salad had to be sitting in a half cup of dressing and husband's pasta was more heavy cream then pasta. No dessert as there was never an offer just a check delivered. So disappointed Totally bummed as the vibe/decor and menu options makes me want to go back, and recommend to others, but not sure I want to waste another $100 to be treated poorly and leave feeling like I want to go eat somewhere else now.

Neither of us had been before, and neither of us left disappointed. In fact, as if to prove that point, When I brought my girlfriend to Rosalina for her birthday last weekend, by sheer coincidence my sister had made a reservation with her significant other as well! What both of us learned from our first visit however, was to make reservations. Seriously, this place is what I think some people would call \"poppin.\" While Rosalina isn't exceedingly small, they are small enough, and they are popular. So call ahead. The menu can seem a little lengthy, but in that length there is variety. On my last visit my girlfriend and I split the Fried Dough Pizza appetizer. It was larger than I expected, but it was delicious. I would recommend it if you are looking for a quick lunch, or as something to split with your party. The entrees are well proportioned and equally delicious. I've had the Ravioli and the Gnocci. Both were great, the Gnocci comes out on a griddle with plenty of melted cheese. Personally I think think the Ravioli are a better dish. They are packed with flavorful cheeses and paired with a pair of fresh meatballs. Each table receives a basket of bread with cheese and olive oil, prior to every meal. The bread itself was a little too crusty in my experience but is still good. The olive oil is sourced from a greek garden of family affiliation. I'm not a fan of it unfortunately, but that's strictly my opinion. I am a huge fan of the spreadable cheese from Narraganset Creamery however. It's like the incarnate of fluffy, buttery, cheesy delight. The cocktails are refreshing and pretty creative. They have plenty of sweet fruity drinks, but also have a few whiskey based cocktails, which I always appreciate. On my last visit I had something that was pretty close to a bourbon sangria. (I can't presently recall the name.) I will probably try something else next time, but it was well worth the 9 dollars. The cocktails are also consistently priced I believe. Beyond their cocktail menu they also have a good wine and beer selection, and if you're checking in on Yelp you can take advantage of that!The decor is nice; I like Rosalina's branding, for one, but the seating is modern and comfortable, and the walls are adorned with large paintings, that don't call too much attention to themselves but are appealing to take in. The one thing I really missed is their desserts, which are apparently quite good. I'll definitely return on that point and update my review accordingly.
