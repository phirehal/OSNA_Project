{"Flavours": [], "Masala Indian Cuisine": [["Mandy D.", "I love, love, LOVE Masala!They just recently updated their dining room so there's more tables and new carpet. They're now better equipped to take on larger groups of people and they have a bigger buffet line with more lunch options available.The buffet lunch is awesome and a really good deal. Of course when food sits out for awhile it's not as fresh... that happens at every buffet! But it is priced accordingly for what you get. I love to do buffet lunch takeout and I load up my container with a little of everything. I have no complaints about the buffet, but some people are overly picky. If you want fresher, better food that is more spicy, order off of the menu! Duh.Masala has some of the most amazing, tender lamb that I have ever had. I love the lamb korma and the lamb saag. And like I said before, they have amazing vegetarian offerings like the malie kofta (fresh veggie fritters) and the saag paneer. I also love the vegetable pakora and get them almost every time I go. I'm a regular so they know exactly how spicy I like my food, and it's perfect every time. Everything is fresh and customized for each customer, so they will make almost anything exactly to your liking. Do not pass up this gem!"], ["Jen R.", "This place is our favorite!!!!!! We always get lentils and chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. It is absolutely delicious.

We are never disappointed with Masala."], ["Christian V.", "If you are a lover of Indian food, like myself, Masala Cuisine will easily become your new favorite place. Situated on the busy Mineral Spring, in a plaza next to a Work Out World no less, Masala is a beautiful gem surrounded by the strip mall atmosphere of Mineral Spring Ave. The inside is nothing spectacular, with TVs and a somewhat uninspired decor. But don't think that is me bashing the place. It's just that I don't go to Indian restaurants for the decor or to watch Bollywood movies and music videos. I go for the food.And oh the food! The wondrous, delicious, magical food! I can tell you that the food is delicious. That's what you really want to hear right? Well, it is. I had the Chicken Tikka Makhani and the Chicken Korma. I requested the heat be turned all the way up and was pleased by the ratio of flavor and burn in both dishes. Served over a bed of basmati rice or with a dippable, scoopable \u00a0naan, the dishes were amazing! I will be returning there. One caveat: they offer delivery but don't order anything until dinner service because that's the only time they have a delivery person available to them."], ["Barry N.", "The waitstaff are typically very friendly and will actually talk to the group.

To be honest, I have driven by this place a number of times without a second glance. In fact, I would have overlooked this place all together had I not recently joined the adjacent gym in the plaza.One day, I decided it would be a good place to grab take-out. I received a styrofoam box and went crazy in the buffet line. They had a flat rate of ~$8.50pp dining in or out of the buffet. Which was great so I didn't have to worry about being conservative with the weighing scale. The food was delicious, flavorful and the curry was ranging (perfectly) from mild to medium. Some of the dishes were on the \"liquid-y\" side and ended up getting mixed together. Which was partly due to the fact that I may or may not have overfilled my take-out box. Their warm garlic nann, tender tandoori chicken and sweet kheer were AMAZING. They definitely left me wanting more when I finished it. I foresee many a visits here.

Never frozen ingredients, all fresh and unprocessed; sauces and all are made from scratch. The Pakistani and Indian menu items are all incredible (that I have tried). I have brought numerous friends to dine here, and all have shared a similar experience.Lunch Buffet is a killer deal. Great variety at a VERY good price.

That said, I was ecstatic when we discovered this restaurant! I LOVE Pakistani food for the complex yet harmonious combination of so many spices and flavours. My favorite dish is the Chicken Karahi. Their Nihari (slow cooked beef stew) was very tender and flavorful. We also liked the Pakistani style chicken tikka (which was dry and grilled without the creamy sauce). The fresh Naan was tasty and fluffy the way I usually like it. The rice--colorful, appetizing. The unsweetened milky chai was spiced just right. They have artificial sweeteners, which I prefer instead of sugar. Regular menu offers reasonable prices and generous portions. Each entree is enough for 2. Buffets on weekends from 3:00 to closing. \u00a0$16.99 for adults, $9.99 for kids. Includes chai and dessert. Excellent selection. Sufficient variety of unlabeled dishes, but each member of our party found something he/she loved. The atmosphere has an authentic, \"old school\" vibe, which makes me feel at home-- warm, cozy, very casual. It might be a bit awkward to newbies at first, though. The available dishes are highlighted on the menu, which may change from day to day. Friendly customer service. Credit cards accepted. Free ample parking.

We were very happy.Chicken biryani was mild and delicious.The quantities were huge. Each order will easily serve 2 and the prices are very reasonable. Service was nice and quick.After eating often at restaurants like rasoi, kabob&curry, this was very refreshing food.They were not serving all items on their menu supposedly because they are still testing how they'll perform in the next few months.(just been 4 months since they opened their branch here).

I dislike when tofu is on the menu just to have it as an option. There are specific ways to cook tofu where it turns out wonderful, but if you aren't going to make the effort, just skip putting it on the menu.-The management was having a really loud brainstorming session near the bar - it was annoying and made the owner/manager(?) sound WAAAY more focused on marketing than food.

Eats Habanero peppers raw as a snack. When she saw this place a couple miles from my home, she absolutely had to give it a try, to compare it to the Indian places near her home in Needham. So, we went last evening for supper.We arrived at 6:15pm. The dining-room section of the restaurant it laid out like a huge cafeteria with four rows of booths/seats, with the center row being adjacent to one another so a panel in the middle can be removed for large parties. There was only one other party there, which sat in the center-aisle booth. Definitely a \"cavernous\" feel to the establishment. There is a small \"sports bar\" section off to the side, separate, but we did not sit there. We were immediately brought water and papadum with onion and tamarind chutney. For an appetizer, we both opted to have the tomato garlic soup (my girlfriend is a pescetarian, and while I'm a carnivore , I usually stick with her diet because it is healthier than mine generally is.) For our main dishes, she opted to have the Saag Paneer and I the Chicken Manchurian. We also ordered a side of Jeera rice to accompany our meals.When ordering, my girlfriend informed our waiter she wanted her Saag \"very spicy\". I asked the waiter if he could make my chicken dish a \"little spicy\" (to give it a little 'kick' without overwhelming the flavor) but he said I should opt to have it 'as is'.The tomato soup was excellent. Actually, some of the best tomato soup I have ever had. Creamy, delicious. I could have just eaten a half-gallon of the soup and have been satiated.The Saag was excellent, but was not at all hot or spicy. Since this was our first time at this establishment, she did not reiterate strongly that she \"really, honestly, truly\" wanted the saag spicy hot (looking at my girlfriend you'd think she's a teenaged lightweight, but she drinks ghost-pepper salsa like its bud-light... god I adore this woman!) I suppose the waitstaff is probably instructed to err on the side of caution with newbie customers.My Chicken Manchurian was excellent, but a little disappointing. To be honest, I'm not a huge eater of indian food, so some of this probably shone through on what I ordered. What I ended up with was something more akin to General Gaos Chicken rather than what I expected. The sauce was sticky and sweet, the chicken seem battered/fried. It was quite delicious. I wanted to lick my plate clean it was so delicious. However, it was incredibly unhealthy compared to what I expected based on the description. I had to do an extra 45 minutes on the elliptical to work off the calories.The jeera rice was well cooked. Perfect.Several times during our meal, the ?owner? (older gentleman who was not our server) came over and asked us how everything was, if we wanted anything else, more rice, paan, etc. The portions were perfect sized -- I was quite full after eating my dish with approximately half the rice and my tomato soup. My girlfriend took about 1/2 of her saag home for today's leftovers at lunch. Our the door, with tip, $50. Somewhat pricey, we did not have any alcohol or drinks with our meal, just water. Will definitely return in the future for additional dishes... plan to strongly inform the waitstaff we want our food quite hot, and not 'dumbed down'."], ["Paul B.", "Without question the finest curries I've ever experienced......try this restaurant and you won't be disappointed"], ["Chris M.", "I'm lucky to drive by this place on my way home from work so I get takeout quite often.

It wasn't terrible, it wasn't terrific. The masala wasn't super spicy (the way I usually like it) and wasn't overwhelmingly flavorful either, but it wasn't bad.

I say \"was\" because our last visit (or to better emphasize our LAST visit) was one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever experienced. We were seated upstairs and waited about 15 minutes for the server to recognize us. Once he did, after our flagging him over, he took our drink and apps order. A runner gave our drinks to the wrong table and when they refused he started back down the stairs until I caught him and told him they were OUR drinks. We wait another 30 minutes and no appetizers so I ask our useless waiter where they are, oh they are coming soon he says and then tells the runner to go put the order in. The staff turnover is the root cause of all of these problems by the way. The competent staff of years past are all gone and you now have untrained, unfriendly and patronizing employees to deal with. Back to the service. We get our meals and at the first bite the manager comes and asks us if we can move over 3 tables so a party of 20 college kids can come take the table. We oblige and are moved into the corner. If you think we were ignored before you should see how long it took us to get a server after the college kid party arrived.

Their lamb curry, their naan, their Sunday brunch - I miss it all so much. I can't wait to visit Providence to eat here again. (Given the crowds during Brown's reunion weekend, etc, I'd say I'm not the only one who feels this way!)I should mention that parking is a nightmare, (wasn't an issue for me at the time,) and it isn't great when it comes to accessibility for wheelchairs or the disabled. \u00a0There are steps up to the door, and the interior is quite cramped."], ["Steve W.", "The food is very good. I especially like the tandoori chicken and the chicken shashlik. I also like the samosas and the potato dosa. I come to Kabob and Curry a lot and I have never found problems with the food. The food is never too spicy for me and has a lot of flavor. However the service is inconsistent. Also the tables are cramped."], ["Leela S.", "Conveniently located on Thayer Street to serve the student denizens, Kabob and Curry is a quick, easy stop if you're looking for Indian food in the area. Their lunch prices are very reasonable, and you receive a fairly filling portion for under $10. Furthermore, if you are a student, you can flash your ID to receive an additional discount--this policy isn't advertised, though. I personally am not the biggest fan of most of their dishes as many are westernised versions of the original, but their saag paneer is probably my favourite. Be warned that service is very hit or miss, though--it honestly depends on how frequent a customer you are, and which side of the bed your server woke up on."], ["Jennifer N.", "The Nans amazing!!!! Chicken tika masala is amazing! Amazing place! \u00a0The waiter is friendly as well. It feels welcoming, love the atmosphere. Staff is extremely nice and helpful."], ["Marie M.", "The food here is very good, however the service varies on every visit. The lamb samosas are always delicious as well as their Tamarind margaritas. The reason I will never return here is for the following reasons1. several waiters stood near the bar area and persisted to peek at me for my entire meal2. my waiter closed my account before I could order another drink, and brought me my check within 4 minutes of serving my food while repeatedly saying to me\"we're not rushing you, we're not rushing you\", but you are rushing me."], ["Amanda W.", "I stopped by to order lunch to-go after finding this place - and it's gluten-free options - on Yelp.

The staff are incredibly friendly and remember most of our names.The food is good, mostly curries with rice or naan. I like their dosas, which are like crispy Indian crepes filled with curried potatoes. None of the food is spicy, but it is not at all bland. The prices are very GOOD for lunch during the week and BAD for lunch on the weekend or dinner on any day of the week. Basically the price and portion are doubled for dinner and weekends, which is not a good thing since meals go from perfect sized portions at under ten bucks to monster portions at twenty bucks.The catering is also quite good. It is everyone's favorite in the Brown CS department, often drawing crowds of students to tech talks and whatnot. In short, if you are on Thayer St, Kabob is a good bet. If you are there at dinner time, bring a friend and split the meal.UPDATE 05/12/14:---------------------I forgot to mention that if you are a student, give your server your student ID with the bill. You'll get 10% off!"]], "Rasoi Restaurant": [["Jamie B.", "Oh Rasoi, how you make my heart swoon.The decor is fun, the servers are always very nice, and the food... sigh... so good! They have an incredible selection for vegans and vegetarians. The last couple times I've gone I ordered the Satvic Thali. This order consists of 7 small portions of their classic vegetarian options. Cauliflower 65 - fried spicy goodness, with the texture of chicken nuggets, but without all the guilt. Vegetable Mango Curry - a mouth watering delicious mixture of sweet and spicy with the most perfect creamy texture. This stuff pares super well with the cauliflower. Saag Paneer - creamy spinach, not too spicy, and compliments the rice and fluffy naan very well. The house lentil - which was not merely just lentils, it was filled with yummy fresh veggies. The dessert of the day was served cool next to the other dishes, so my first bite of it I was caught off guard expecting a hot spicy dish. Once I realized it was the dessert, I couldn't get enough of it! After the hot and spicy Thali, the cool and sweet tapioca (pudding?) was absolutely what I needed.The only complaint I can give was that a couple of the times I came the tap water tasted dirty. I know it's free, so I shouldn't really complain, especially knowing they're located in Pawtucket (I used to live there, so no disrespect intended). But after asking for a different glass of water once I found that the new one tasted exactly the same. So, either the waiter went into the kitchen and back out with my same glass, or it's just the water. But really, this isn't enough for me to bump my review down any stars. Rasoi deserves all five. My recommendation? Go for lunch! They have rewards for frequent lunch customers, and the prices are ridiculously reasonable. We're talking between $6-$8 for vegetarian/vegan meals that cost $12-$14 during dinner. And the portions are so filling that you'll probably have to ditch dinner anyway. Which, if you're as lazy as I am, that's a good thing."], ["Michelle W.", "We love Rasoi! Amazing experience (once again) the other night with Erics waiting on us.

For $15 ($14 for the Saturday Vegetarian Buffet Brunch) you get to choose from some of the best food you will ever taste. Every week is different, offering new tastes of different meat and veggie dishes.Their servers will make you feel like royalty. They are very attentive and considerate. They will sometimes engage you in conversation but, it feels like, they're laser-focused on ensuring your experience with their food is incredible!It should note that they are not cheap. Not even in the slightest. My favourite entree to order (and one I HIGHLY recommend), the Chicken Tikka Lababdar, costs $16 before tax. However, you do get a sizeable amount of food for your money.When I'm hankering for Indian food, it's Rasoi or nothing."], ["Annabel T.", "Came here last night (a Saturday) at 9.45pm, on the way back to New Haven. My friend said the food here was good, and she wasn't kidding! Service at 9.45 happens to be really speedy because they close the kitchen at 10.15pm. Our waiter was quite polite and catered to us in a timely and unrushed manner during our 45 minute meal. I know thalis are always a hit or miss, but I ordered a vegetable thali in haste, which was a mistake on my part. My thali did not come with yogurt, so I had to ask for it separately (maybe they forgot?). There was also a vegetable curry that contained mango chutney, which I didn't really care for. However, the saving graces of the thali were the naan, which was by far one of the best naans I've eaten outside of India, and the suji dessert. I enjoyed those things very much. The thali cost $13.99, which is a reasonable price. My friends ordered the potato and egg curry ($12.99) and the Hyderabadi chicken korma ($14.99), which were DELICIOUS. I was like, \"ugh, me and my thali ambitions.\" In any case, this was a tasty albeit brief dinner in Pawtucket. If ever I'm around again, I'll be back!"], ["Gordon B.", "Cooking Demo on 24 AugustChef/Owner Sanjiv Dhar held another class on Monday.

At first I was a bit hesitant with the menu. There was a lot of dishes I was not familiar with, some using some interesting ingredients. I was torn between two vegan dishes and the hyderabadi chicken.The meal began with papdum with 2 sauces for dipping. The brown one is sweet and savory at the same time. Very yummy! For an appetizer I had a potato and paneer samosa which was very nice. It wasn't super hot on the inside but warm enough for my taste.We ordered the spring onion and garlic naan which I ate along with the hyderabadi chicken. Oh gosh was it all so amazing! The chicken was so perfectly cooked and there was a ton of it! The sauce was perfectly warm with spice, nothing crazy hot.

I've lived in India, and I find that they have food here that is authentic enough to meet my cravings but also many choices that are more low-key as to not inspire fear in my friends and family with limited or meek palates. \u00a0There is an option for everyone- gluten, dairy, animal-product free options are not only bountiful, but delicious. The Cauliflower 65 and the Idli are my two favorite appetizers. I have too many favorite entrees to count. However, the crowning jewel of this places for me is their South Indian cuisine. \u00a0It's less popular in general, but so very tasty, and at Rasoi, they do not disappoint with their offerings. Dosas are crisp and gigantic (as they should be), coconut and tomato chutneys are creamy and on point. \u00a0My only complaint is that they don't add more options for the fillings, but the ones they have are wonderful. \u00a0The buffets on the weekend are great values for their offerings. The ambiance is nice, as you can dress up or down and not feel out of place. I love that they have Bollywood music videos on display but not so loud that you can't have a good conversation. It's family friendly. \u00a0The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and unless truly slammed, are always refilling your water or making sure everything is ok before you ask first. The prices are a little high given its location, but it's easy to overlook when the food and services you receive are pretty much perfect."], ["Heather G.", "This place is AMAZING. I haven't stopped thinking about it since my first take out experience last week.I trusted my fellow Yelpers and came in on a Wednesday night for take out.

I loved these and will be ordering them every time I go.The Chicken Korma was the best I've ever had. I am picky about Indian food and usually will grab take out from my favorite spot in Cambridge... but Rasoi rivals the best Indian restaurants in Boston.

GF hub has been here and speaks highly of it, so despite there were other places i have researched and wanted to try, we came here upon his suggestion instead.arrived a few minutes before 3pm on a Sat; saw the posted sign about buffet ending soon, but they still served (ie. not closed in between hours). sat down, ordered drinks and apps, then thought about entree choices as the staff put away buffet tables in the background.when putting in our orders, the only non-Indian looking waiter in the house regrettably informed us that \"lunch time was over\", so we had to go with the dinner pricing of the same food. thinking we would have a larger portion? doesn't seem like it (as evident by the dishes that arrived later), but the price of each just went up $4-8 on you because you arrived 5 minutes too late for lunch. oh well.asked about our serving of that cracker stuff (sorry i didn't get the name; they serve that here instead of bread), our waiter once again regrettably told us that they were just finished with the last batch, but he would check on it and bring us some when the next batch came out.except that he never came back for the rest of our meal. another waiter served us food, the manager-looking gentleman came to ask how our meal was, but no one told us where our waiter went... until the end of our meal as we went to use the restroom, we found him sitting in the back taking his break. i'm not saying he didn't earn his break, but he could've followed up on our orders and maybe explained why he'd be gone, instead of just going MIA on us. or the restaurant could have had someone else serve us to begin with, if he were to go on his break that soon. not sure how that system works...forgot to ask hub to check if his name (which we never caught, btw) was on our tab, or if the establishment goes by a communal tip system. coz if he were to get tips from this meal, he really didn't deserve a lot. not very happy with the forced \"upselling\", either -- now i'm starting to wonder if it was a universal house rule, or he was telling us that only to jack up the bill for his own benefit.food is good, don't get me wrong, and i do appreciate how they list every dish clearly whether it is gluten-free, dairy-free, or both (think they specify vegetarian/vegan dishes too). but the fact that we had to overspend for what didn't look like a bigger portion of food--plus no crackers!--that's just kind of messed up. yes we could've asked for the crackers but when we realized we were not getting ours while those who came after us did (and our main courses were coming), it was kinda past the point...hope the next visit would be a better experience."], ["Lisa O.", "I have been to Rasoi a few times now. The food is always good and the service decent. I gave 4 stars based upon my past few experiences with the tasty cuisine.Tonight, I ordered the potato naan, which I found disappointing. When I have ordered it from other places in the past, it had been deliciously seasoned potato and peas inside naan. Rasoi's was simply a thin layer of unseasoned potato. Essentially, pointless carbs that added no flavor. I also ordered the mango chicken and veggies which was delicious. The meat was plentiful and moist. I often find that Indian restaurants over cook meat and give tiny portions of meat. That problem does not exist at Rasoi. They have the option of brwn rice rather than basamti rice. I figured when I ordered it that the brown rice would also have some seasoning. However, it was just slightly over cooked brown \u00a0rice. I'll be stocking too the basamti in the future.The service is relatively quick and the servers friendly enough, but it is nothing to write home about."], ["Sarah Jean R.", "Rasoi is the best.

My father loved all of the meat dishes and I especially loved the almond dessert. The price is a little bit on the higher side, but you cannot deny that Rasoi is one of the best deals for Indian brunch buffet in RI.Dinner: Years later, I came here with my GF to enjoy a nice dinner and we decided to splurge a bit, with two mango lassi (tall glass, but lots of ice), a specialty dates and coconut nan, a 4-dish specialty and fried okra. I looooved the okra dish, omg, I could eat it all day and they were definitely crunchy, but maintained the soggy, chewy nature that I have come to love from okras. The multi-dish, in which I totally forgot the name was good as well, although the lamb was a bit overcooked and sparsely populated the little dish. The lentils were decent, and it also came with two well seasoned shrimp as well. We didn't try any of the other appetizers, but you can't have it all the first time, right?My personal recommendation, get the okra dish.

I've been to two other Indian restaurants in the area: Taste of India on Wickenden Street and India on Hope (a mere stones throw from Rasoi's doorstep). I think Rasoi embodies the best qualities among the three. For example, parking is easy as pie. The ambiance is bright and friendly, but also quite classy.
