We usually get the chicken kabobs and they are pretty tasty, and I dip them in their yogurt, yummy. Also we love their spicy hummus (and they have regular also), with pita bread. If you're trying to watch your carbs, you can opt to get it with raw carrots and cucumbers instead. They got new dishes and I think the serving of hummus is smaller than before, and it's $4, so definitely go for happy hour.They used to have a feta dip that was delicious, but they took it away and we still wonder why. The desserts are 3 kinds of bahklava (we got the chocolate one) and it was pretty yummy, but they are $1.50 for 2 small bites worth. Their mini cupcakes aren't bad either, but they are the same price, which is too much. I've had the feta fries...not too impressed. The spinach pastry is ok, nothing that special. Bring back the feta dip!They have happy hour every day from 3-6 and all day sunday. The appetizers are half off, so that's a good time to try 2 for 1 price.

I was recommended to this restaurant by a Persian coworker when I told her about how much I miss Persian food from living in Little Tehran (Westwood) in Los Angeles. She highly recommended Luna Grill because of the prices and quality/how authentic the food is. I agree with her and highly recommend this place as well! It definitely hit the spot for my Persian food craving.My friend and I ordered the HUMUS AND PITA BREAD appetizer, the GYROS QUESADILLA, and CHICKEN KABOB ENTR\u00c9E. All of the dishes were terrific. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and looked beautiful. From the dishes that we ordered, we liked the quesadilla the least because it took some time to get used to the restaurant's novel creation, but it was still fun to try and appetizing. The humus is some of the best humus I've tried in SD and it looks beautiful (I've uploaded a pic of it to Yelp). The chicken kabob entree is a nice complete meal with a sizable skewer of chicken, basmati rice, lightly seasoned salad, two sheets of pita bread, and your choice of a grilled tomato or carrots. The portion sizes of all our dishes were perfect; we even had some leftovers that we took home with us. My friend and I left with our stomachs comfortably full.Although the restaurant is next to a few bars, the environment is still great for families. When my friend and I went, there were several gay families; they warmed my heart. The restaurant is spotless and very-well lit. The workers are very kind and the restaurant is well staff. There are a lot of tables/seats including seating in their small outdoor patio. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!

That's how I prefer it. The appetizer hummus and pita doesn't come with it so I order it on the side. Every single time it's different. The first time it was a full order of hummus and pita bread and I ordered a side of cucumber and tomatoes...it was the perfect amount. I ordered it again another day and they gave me a whole order of hummus and pita but literally 3 tiny tomato chunks and 3 slices of cucumber that were cut in half.... I had to cut up the tomatoes and cucumber so small to eat with my food it was strange that I was charged extra for it.

Its truly one of my favorite cuisine's on earth. I also used to work at a Greek restaurant (Daphne's BEFORE they become this \"California Greek\" crap...back when they first started out and served Greek food.) I had a hankering for a Greek chicken salad and some avgolemono soup so I decided I'd give this place a try. Coming in, right off the bat, they had a flat screen situated outside since its World Cup season which was pretty cool. Compared to the previous Greek Caf\u00e9 that was here before, this place is A LOT BETTER in terms of cleanliness and looks. The young lady at the counter promptly took my order and so I waited for my food.I ordered a Greek salad with chicken ($9 + $3.50 for the chicken) and soup ($3.50.) \u00a0I'm usually weary of ordering salads to go because it seems like a lot of places jip you in the to-go salad department but the salad was a good size. The downside is it does not come with any type of flatbread or pita bread. For $12.50, I would have hoped they had some to go with my salad. The chicken was good, nicely marinated. I did not care for the type of cucumbers they put in the salad - they were bitter. If I ever find myself there again, I will also probably ask for extra salad dressing as they don't give you much (that's a personal preference of mine though.) The salad also had a lot of the middle part and end of the lettuce that I throw away.The soup was okay to me. Not as lemon-y as I prefer but it had a good amount of chicken chunks and rice.Overall, I give this place 3 star based on the salad and soup.

The fries were also cold, in old grease, and had feta, garlic, and parsley on them...didn't do much to make them better.This was pretty sad times for the gryos and fries combo.

Avgolemono soup: It's a lemon chicken soup. Savory and just rich enough to remind you of your childhood American comfort food, with a proper amount of tang. I believe there are rice bits in there, so if you're feeling under the weather, or if it's a rare, chilly day in San Diego, the soup comes highly recommended. Salmon plate: You get a salmon fillet, cooked until it juuuust flakes. It's perfect. Seasoned well, and buttery. It comes with herbed rice/fries, warm pita, and a side of greek salad. Beef Kabob: The meat; It's seasoned, with a lovely char on their onions and green bell pepper. Biting into the meat produces a juicy pink middle. I don't usually do kabobs because it's so easy to overcook, but this is really good.Mediterranean Veggie Delight Plate: Try saying that ten times fast. Now this is where I get really excited. It's silly because I'm a massive carnivore, and 9 times out of 10, if I don't have meat when I go out, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Not so, here. Let me break it down; falafel balls are perfectly tender and moist, with a crunchy exterior. It's just herby chickpea mash, but done right. Hummus is great. You'd be hard-pressed not to bump into it at some point when you're here. Spinach spanakopita--it's like garlicky creamed spinach wrapped in filo dough. Definitely one of my favorites off of this platter, but it's very rich. It came with fluffy herb rice, greek salad, and warm pita. \u00a0$9.95 and it's a lot of food I nearly couldn't finish it.

I totally forgot that I had been to Mediterranean Cafe until I saw the reminder to write a review today.

As we turned onto Washington we landed a metered space and lo and behold the Mediterranean Cafe beamed it's soft and welcoming interior lighting upon us. Walking four blocks all of a sudden became an impossible task and we stepped into a much more convenient and equally delicious option.I browsed the menu while listening to live acoustic guitar and selected a glass of red wine with the chicken kabob, gyros and hummus combo plate. The wait was brief and a MASSIVE plate of food arrived in mere minutes - I was staaaaarving and started picking it apart. The chicken kabob was the definite star of the plate (platter) while the gyro meat jumped on the average train for me - not disappointing, not great, just average. The hummus and pitas were portioned well, which seems silly but I always find myself either asking for more pita or running out of hummus with pita leftover. The little things, friends. Oh yeah, the hot sauce comes in a bottle that looks like ketchup and is awesome... drown your food. It's okay and who says that lambs and chicken don't like getting a little wet? Long story short (not really) is that the price was right at $12.95 for the meal and all of us walked out satisfied, stuffed and ready for vacay."], ["Nancy R.", "This place caters a nice lunch for your workplace, they deliver and are very nice. \u00a0We had kabobs, hummus, pita, salad, and they comp'd some desserts. \u00a0Very fresh, healthy, and delicious food. \u00a0I will use them again for a nice catered lunch."], ["Gwyn C.", "Like the ambiance. \u00a0 Nice presentation and tastey. \u00a0Kabob chicken was very well seasoned but a bit skimpy on the chicken. \u00a0Veggie plate was well seasoned and perfect size. \u00a0Lunch specials were very reasonable and good service \u00a0A lucky find, thanks yelp."], ["Jolie F.", "I had a horrible experience with this place.

I got the gyros sandwich with fries and drink. 30 minutes later, the two boys in front of me that ordered entire plates for lunch had eaten their food and left and my previously cold soda was now barely cool. The girl working the counter could not remember who ordered what and kept approaching tables and asking if they ordered what she had in her hands. They gave no system of names or numbers to prevent this. After I had been approached three times, having told her each time what I HAD ordered, I got back in line for another 5 minutes and explained my order had been taken 30 mins prior (no exaggeration) and the guys in front of me had eaten and left. She again asked what I ordered. I again reminded her. She then proceeded, as she had several other times previously, to speak with the kitchen staff and asking that they please make my food. And ten minutes later I received my food. 45 minutes after my order to go I'm driving home with it. I hope it's good. Must be for how busy they are. The parking is shared by numerous other businesses in the little shopping center. However, many of these businesses also serve food at lunch. Large businesses are nearby including Kaiser Hospital. I would strongly suggest that you call in your order and plan ahead leaving plenty of time to pick up your food and get back to work.Needless to say, my experience today was less than satisfactory. I will likely return once more to give this establishment another opportunity to provide better customer service. The girl at the counter had explained to at least one customer that the owner is currently recovering from surgery. I would imagine that the owner provides better customer service.Two stars for what I hope will be decent food instead of the one star the lackluster service deserves."], ["Ryan F.", "I was actually hoping to have lunch at the Purple Mint a couple doors down, but they were closed so I had to find somewhere else. I still wanted something healthy, and so I figured I could come here and at least get a Greek salad.People aren't lying about the quality of food here, my only slight disappointment was my chicken being a little dry. Other thanks that, the salad was well-portioned and very fresh. It came with some freshly toasted pita bread and two kinds of tzatziki, both really good. I'll definitely be coming back to try more! It's even a healthy option, as long as you stay away from the fries and don't over do it with the pita bread."], ["Nancy T.", "My first time here today and I the food was cheap.

I wouldn't recommend coming with more than 4 persons. There really isn't room to put tables together. The decor is simple and basic but you're not here for the scenery. You've come for the food. And let me be the one to tell you, you will not be disappointed. Ask for the spicy tzatziki, yum!! I usually go for the gyro plate. But I've tried everything on the menu and have always been please.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular. The tomatoes and pita were nice and fresh which I like, however they don't come with onions on them. All gyros have onions. I'm not used to getting lettuce on it either so that's a different twist which I was not a fan of because it became soggy from the heat of the Gyro and I had to pick it out. When I asked the cashier for onions he said they \"don't put onions on them because most people have to go back to work\" and it was lunch time. It was 2:30 so lunch for most 'workers' was already over. I don't know if he even realized that was a backhanded compliment or how stupid he sounded \u00a0but maybe I was on lunch break from work and I don't care if I have onion breath?

The hummus plate appetizer was fantastic and had a choice of spicy or regular Tazki. The hummus was something to brag about. It was some of the best hummus I've had! The plate also featured sliced veggies which was a nice touch. I also ordered the chicken Greek salad. The chicken was beyond what I expected! It was juicy, tender and grilled to perfection!

They glanced at us briefly and didn't say much after that. They eventually came to take our order, but they didn't seem to be in that happy of mood.The other problem was that there was no water in the dispenser and they seemed almost bothered when we asked if we could have some. 10 minutes later they added about 32 oz of water to the container and went back behind the counter. The water ran out again soon after that.Finally, the food was good. Great? Not in my opinion. We had the falafel sandwich and Greek wrap (as suggested by Yelp).

I came here during a Mogl promotion that basically made eating here free.My favorite thing to eat at Middle Eastern restaurants is Gyro, even though it is of Greek, not Middle Eastern origin, and in fact, most people in the Middle East have no idea what a gyro is.Vanoos makes a good gyro. The meat is a mix of beef and lamb. I personally prefer straight up lamb, but it's still pretty good. The pita is delicious and fresh. They use a much thicker tzatziki sauce than most places -- it has the consistency of sour cream, and I suspect they make it with labneh. Very good so far.They also add way too much lettuce and tomatoes -- so much that I could barely taste the gyro the first time, and I had to ask them to hold the lettuce and tomatoes the next time I got it. They tend to pile a lot of lettuce on most of their sandwiches, which is a little strange.The quality of the sandwich is slightly inconsistent. Some days, it's better than others. At it's best, the food was good, but not amazing.Their french fries are delicious, but be warned, they are not crispy. I prefer \"tender\" french fries and that is how they serve them.

Also--very large!My only negative was that the ingredients of both sandwiches were absolutely saturated with sauce. It was dripping out of the pita.

At that time it was more of a market (hence its name) than the semi-fancy digs it now calls home however. And is still one of my all time favorite Greek restos, especially since my life long favorite, Hella's, closed a few years ago in Detroit.It's more of an upscale place now with prices also a bit higher than at your typical Greek resto, but in this area it is in line with everyone else. Plus the food here is definitely worth a few more bucks with everything cooked with top quality ingredients. Service is usually a bit more formal too. I have tried many items over the years and have never been disappointed in any of them. Their avgolemeno soup is the benchmark from where I judge all others. Perfect consistency, and the proper amount of lemony tartness. OPA indeed!I often start with their off the charts Grilled Baby Octopus, but we arrived fresh off of AMTRAK from OC in a very starved state. The waiter gave us fair warning that it would take 15 minutes or so to prepare. Thanks man, plan B it shall B then. We opted for the quickest choice: olive and feta cheese plate. Pretty self explanatory, except that feta was fresh as a daisy. Also ordered a delish Greek salad, also very fresh and refreshing.M'lady had never tried moussaka, and wanted to give it a go. From their menu: \"Eggplant & Ground Sirloin Casserole. Baked layers of grilled eggplant, zucchini, and ground sirloin topped with b\u00e9chamel.\" \u00a0Selfishly I tried to steer her on to something else as we agreed to split an entre. I have always thought \u00a0moussaka to be cloyingly rich and too \"milky\" for my taste. This was not. That is why I copied the above from their menu. I have a feeling many other versions I have had did not use ground sirloin, but a lesser ground beef of some inferior sort. Others I have had over used the b\u00e9chamel sauce, adding to the too milky richness that was imparted. Major problem. She will now want to order this in our future Greek resto visits, but I am sure she will be let down after this one. Thank dog we now have Georges in HB so I don't have to look forward to my now infrequent visits to San Diego for great Greek.

The salmon used to be on the menu but isn't anymore, but I still ask for it and they still make it for me. Both the gyros and salmon are delicious, especially the salmon. And for soup, I really like their lentil soup. The service is wonderful. They're very prompt and friendly."], ["Kim R.", "This place had really great food! I had a gyros plate and my boyfriend had filet mignon medallions, they were both delicious with generous proportions. The staff was so incredibly nice. When my waitress bagged up my food she gave me extra tzatziki and extra pita to take home, a definite plus since most places charge for extra pita bread. My food even tasted great the next day for lunch. The only downside is that it was a bit pricey. I have a couple other favorite Greek spots in La Jolla and PB and this one is more expensive than the others. Delicious and convenient for being right around the corner from my house though.

They have a chic, laid back environment and had a nice large table in the back ready for big groups, and were able to accommodate and serve us quite well. \u00a0If you go here, just beware that it is definitely a little on the nicer side, therefore their prices are a little steep, but it's well worth the ambiance and quality. \u00a0They have small plates (/supposed to be more like appetizers) and large plate though, so if you're not wanting to spend as much you can always just get a small plate, but some of them are like really small (I remember several people ordered the mini order of souvlaki and it really is quite mini!). \u00a0I got the Greek tacos, one with falafel and one with gyro meat and they were delicious. \u00a0Everyone else's stuff looked really good as well, and people seemed to enjoy it. \u00a0Also, their cocktails are strong! \u00a0I got the pomegranate margaritas and was feeling pretty nice by the end of dinner :)"], ["L L.", "First time for me and my wife at Meze.

I also got the Greek Quesadilla and added chicken to it, it was the best Greek style quesadilla I've tried. If you are a feta cheese fan like I am you would love it. They have a huge variety of unique hookah flavors and I would highly suggest getting one with a wine base.Best part of the night was when the belly dancer came out.

On a Sunday, after driving around Gaslamp for almost 20 minutes just to find parking, a girlfriend and I noticed Meze near where we ended up, and, both being famished and huge fans of Greek food we decided to check it out. It gives off a very relaxed but upscale vibe. \u00a0The doors are completely open so you can see the menu posted outside, and two floors and a giant bar before you go in.We got there a half an hour before brunch (and their bottomless mimosas for $12) ended, and our waiter Kevin, who was awesome assured us that we didn't have to worry about the end time. My friend is Greek, and so when we go to places like this she takes the lead on ordering, which is absolutely fine because she picks well - like the garlicky, VERY garlicky mashed potatoes to start with. They were served with bread - thinner than pita, it seemed, so I am not sure what kind of bread, but no complaints with that.Between the mimosa-ing and appetizer I didn't want to get too full so I got the appetizer portion Souvlakia, which came looking like it was smothered in buffalo sauce (see picture), but definitely was not. I hadn't had that type of sauce on chicken souvlaki before, but whatever it was was delicious! My friend got a gyro wrap which was very hearty in portion size and came with a heap of meze fries (fries made topped with feta and I think basil). Everything was just delicious. Kevin was very generous with our pours, coming by constantly to refill and to check on us. Also, someone who must have been the owner stopped by to tell us more about the grand opening event, and he was very friendly and kind thanking us for our patronage. The only weird thing we noticed - which hardly warrants taking off a star - is that they play really sad pop music. Haha. Maybe it was just that particular day, but when I'm hanging out having brunch with friends, I don't really want the saddest Coldplay songs ever being blasted around us. Otherwise, the atmosphere of Meze is nice and fun. There are three floors, plenty of seating, pretty lights and decor, and it looks like they have an extensive hookah menu, too, which people can do outside while eating. I am glad I've found a new brunch spot with bottomless mimosas and countless tasty offerings on the menu. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Michael C.", "Think creative Greek tapas.

I had no idea it could taste so good. My favorite though we're the meatballs. It had a red pepper sauce that just complimented the dish so well. \u00a0The Greek tacos were good but not great. I did like the chicken more than the steak. The only setback I had was the beer I ordered, it was flat. Oh well. Also, I saw this place has a killer happy hour. \u00a0I'd definitely come back."], ["Detroit R.", "What an amazing surprise. I walked in this resturant with no expectations and was WOWED :)The music along with the ambience was very inviting. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with a high level of professionalism by Andrew. He was very pleasant, kind and attentive. I ordered a Greek salad with minus olives and two tacos (one chicken and one gyro). First off, my salad was served with with olives. Without hesitation, Andrew snatched my salad and brought me a fresh salad one within minutes. He's definitely is a perfectionist and pays close attention to detail. We also ordered the shrimp and Ouzo fettuccini. That about a delicious dish??? OMGGGGGGG!!!! You need to try this....like, right now!!! We ended our meal with loukoumades.

Its a kasseri cheese flambed tableside in brandy with lemon juice on top, served with pita bread. \u00a0Highly recommended.The souvlaki, feta fries, feta mac n cheese, and spanikopita were also hits. \u00a0The gyro was good too, but it is prepared and presented less like a meatloaf and more like a shredded beef. \u00a0While the texture was not what I expected the flavor was spot on.Many of their best mezes are half off during happy hour (5 to 6 I think) so if you are on the fence about trying it, this is the time to go."], ["Alissa F.", "Great food, the belly dancer was a fun surprise and polite service.

Bottomless Mimosa from 10am - 2pm is $12. YES PLEASE!We grabbed a high top seat on a beautiful Sunday late morning and took a look at their menu. Funny enough, although Meze is a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant, we both ended up ordering the Huevos Rancheros because the table next to us had it and it looked DELISH! I waitress also heavily recommended it.So when our plates hit the table, I was stoked! It looked scrumptious! Tostada, refried beans, two eggs, ranchero sauce, Pico de Gallo, avocado, sour cream - and we added chicken to ours. I was so pleasantly surprised how much flavor there was in the dish even though it was an odd find at a \u00a0Mediterranean spot. And the ranchero sauce was awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!As for the Bottomless Mimosas...it was totally worth it. I've been to so many places that say they have bottomless mimosas but it's like pulling teeth to have the servers come by for refills. Not here at Meze, our serve (I wish I remembered her name!) was on point and kept the bubbly flowing.Added perk?

Everything tasted great, but I will say the portions of the small plates are pretty small for what you are paying for."], ["Pillin L.", "Aaaaaamazing! I was a little skeptical of this place when I first sat down. There wasn't much options. They had a list of cold appetizers and hot appetizers. Cold were your dips and such. Hot were stuff I wasn't really familiar with either. But read through and ordered a handful of things that sounded good. I'm not a Greek food connoisseur by any means. Boy, did we eat good today! The stuffed grape leaves (not sure what the official name was) were delish! It sat upon a lemony sauce that just complimented it so well. The filet skewer was a melt in your mouth delicious piece of meat as well. Their baba ganoush wasn't a favorite but the warm home made pita made it taste so much better. The gyros are a must! Unfortunately when we were there, their fryer was down so we were forced to order a salad (yuck... lol) but it was all very very good! Fresh, and had the best balance of flavors and meat to veggie to tzatziki to pita ratio! You can't ask for more than that.I definitely recommend this place when in SD Gaslamp area.

There have plenty of tables that seat at least 6 people. The front is really nice and open. It's in downtown, so it's just a great vibe overall. We ordered a ton of stuff:-fiery feta hummus-baba ghanoush-firey feta mac n cheese-saganaki-meze fries-grilled asparagus salad -Filet plate-pasta lahano (for the vegetarians)-meatballsEveryone's favorites were the firey feta mac n cheese, saganaki, and the meze fries. Delicious! My favorite was the grilled asparagus salad. The salad comes with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, gorgonzola cheese, fresh fruit, walnuts, and a strawberry-fig reduction. I would come back to Meze for this salad alone. Boyfriend and brother's girlfriend, both vegetarians, both loved the pasta lahano. The night we came they had a dancer going around. It was pretty cool and it really gave them place a sense of culture and it helped create the atmosphere. The dancer asked my dad to get up and dance and after from coaxing from the family, he got up and danced with her for about 5 minutes! It was probably one of the best events of the night.Our waitress was amazing. She really helped us go through the menu and pick things to eat that everyone would like. This is a great place for vegetarians because there are a lot of dishes that don't have meat and most of them could go with some type of substitution if you wanted. They have taco Tuesdays! So if you're looking to try it out on a discount, that'd be the perfect day to come. We didn't have any tacos when we came, but all the meat we had was delicious."], ["Casey Q.", "Fun place, GREAT bar, good food. Was in San Diego for a couple of conferences in March, and since much of my family lives in SD, it was Party Week.Mixed the groups one night when I hit Meze with a colleague, and my brother (who lives two blocks from the joint), where we enjoyed some saganaki - who don't love a nice flaming cheese? - grilled octopus, and some of the less exotic offerings.Setting is comfortable, and very eye-pleasing. Service at the bar was stellar, at the tables a little less so, but they only lose one star for that.Overall, a place I'd happily revisit on my next trip to \"America's Finest City.\""], ["Tara I.", "Delicious.

After some research, we ended up at Meze.They had a dip platter (that came with 6 dips) and I loved this app. Very good to share- the standout was definitely the feta with roasted peppers. On the other end of the spectrum, I didn't care for the yogurt that was strained multiple times- it resembled sour cream to me. For my entree- I had the octopus salad (most salads have an option of making it a half salad but this didn't... glad it didn't because I loved this). I don't normally order salads either! The octopus was cooked nicely- tender but not rubbery. The dressing on here complimented the dish well. Very light and guilt free if you ask me.Wouldn't mind checking out this place if I'm every in the area again.

Lizzy was our server and she was great, very nice girl and highly recommended several things that of course we went for. \u00a0I especially liked how she told us about the restaurant, the owner, the history and the preparation of the food, I thought that was a nice touch!What I did like is that they have several small plates that you can share or meals if you want your own plate and are hungrier than others. \u00a0Because we had a late reservation we mostly shared all the cold and hot meze dishes.We started off with cocktails, wine and beer. \u00a0For food I personally chose the baba ghanoush which was delicious, I eat a lot of hummus so this was right up my alley. \u00a0They brought it out with delicious tasting warm pita bread which tasted similar to naan bread that you get at an Indian place, I also asked for veggies with it also. \u00a0I also had the grilled shrimp which was 3 large shrimps with a fabulous sauce, their meze sauce which I wiped the plate clean with the tasty bread! \u00a0Others at the table had the meze fries with feta, my dad enjoyed the Greek quesadilla, my Mom had the spanakopita which she thoroughly enjoyed in addition to a side of gyro meat, our other friends had the lamb plate and the tacos. One of the best things we enjoyed which came with an \"experience\" was the saganoka which was a warm cheese dish that the server brings out and lights on fire, very cool and highly recommended!I really wanted to get the asparagus salad, the pictures I'd seen looked really good but we had so many small plates that I wasn't hungry enough for that so I'll try that next time.After we were finished eating, Patrick one of the owners came to the table and introduced himself and asked how everything was. \u00a0I also thought that was a nice touch as it showed how much of a family orientation the place had. \u00a0And for the grand finale, they had a belly dancer! \u00a0She came in around 9:30pm in a cute costume with lights and danced around the restaurant so it was nice to have some entertainment!Meze is a very cool spot that's a trendy, fun spot with fabulous service and food. \u00a0It's also very large inside, I'd never been to their original location so I'm saying this is a great new addition to the gaslamp!"], ["Kasia M.", "Never been here before...So I go on customer service, drink, foodThat order.Customer service...

A friend suggested this place to me since I was in the area for a conference. I spent my summer in Greece and was excited by the idea of a great Greek fusion place. The Gaslamp area is really nice to walk around and this place is easily accessible by public transportation (which is a big statement from me since I'm directionally challenged enough in cities I do know - still managed to navigate my way here from Harbor Island having never been to San Diego before) The exterior is sleek and there were a good number of people out smoking hookah who seemed to enjoy the service. The interior is just as nice - open, airy, classy lounge feel. I came during happy hour which turned out to be amazing. They had $3 cold appetizers, $4 warm ones, and had Mythos beer which was a plus. Happy hour is for the bar and lounge only but since the lounge section wasn't open, I was able to grab a table and still order from the happy hour menu. Friendly, accommodating staff and the prices cannot be beat for the quality. I ordered the baba ghanoush, the meatballs, and the fiery mac n' cheese all off the happy hour menu. The food came out quickly and was really great! I thought the baba ghanoush tasted more like a hummus plate but it was just a personal preference - the waitress was really nice about it and took it off my bill since I didn't enjoy it as much. The meatballs were wonderfully seasoned and tasted really great. I wouldn't say the mac n' cheese was exactly 'fiery' (sort of expected it to be set on fire similarly to saganaki) but it complemented the meatballs well. I think the food would be a little lack luster if I were to have only ordered the mac n' cheese though - needs to be paired with something. This place seems to be creative with their food and concept. Absolutely check it out if you're around Gaslamp and if you're not, it's worth the trip. Bummed that I'm across the country! Will absolutely come back next time I'm in SD."], ["Will V.", "A respectable Greek dinner option with a spacious room, attentive service, and occasional deals like half off on all bottles of wine.

I don't know what they add to it, but it's not bitter and is addicting. I've had the lamb gyro, lamb biryani, Greek salad, and lemon soup. Everything is delicious but the lamb can sometimes be on the fatty side and the lemon soup was a bit too sour for me.

The chicken was SO GOOD! It had a mildly spicy marinade and was grilled to perfection; well cooked in the middle with lots of charring on the outside!Cheese Borak ($10.50 for a half dozen); A Blend of Feta Cheese, and Halumi Cheese with Fresh Mint baked in a \u00a0Wood-fired Oven. This got rave reviews from everyone and could easily be an entree on its own.Baklava ($5.50). The family took this to go and reported back that it \"rocked!\" It is massive and looks great. Very fresh and crispy looking.-The prices were really reasonable, moreso considering the size and most importantly the quality of the ingredients and flavour of the dishes. There are a TON of other items on this menu which we can't wait to try. This place scores on every level. An amazing find. Definitely soon to become a regular spot!"], ["Vince F.", "Came here a few times and every time I just enjoying the food here.

One salad is big enough to share, and the parking can be a little tricky. Ps don't ask for Tziki, it's \"Mediterranean, not Greek! \"Ha!?? Confused me too. But it's all sooo delicious! Probably the best hummus I've ever had too!"], ["Jack M.", "I happy to learn that Aladdin continues to do well after all these years. I use to come here before I was a Yelper. I dropped in for a light lunch and ordered the lentil soup, a half order of hummus and pita, and a Chicken Kebab with sandwich on pita bread. The Lentils soup was light but full of great flavor. It was of the extremely blended variety, in that there was no whole lentils in it. But, the soup tasty of lentils, garlic, turmeric, and a variety of other seasonings and herbs. The soup was a great way to start the meal and cost $4.95.The hummus was fantastic as well. Made from fresh ingredients and garnished with excellent extra virgin olive oil, it was hard to go wrong with this. The hummus was served with a pile of sliced warm pita bread which were perfect for eating the hummus. The hummus was quite delicious, and provided a creamy consistency and great flavors of tahini, a bit of lemon juice, garlic, and seasoning for taste. It was quite a treat, and I even used it on my chicken kebab sandwich. The half order cost $5.25.The chicken kebab was very well prepared. Although it did not come with lettuce, the sweet waitress brought me some when she figured out I was bummed it did not have some. The chicken breast marinated in the garlic lemon saffron sauce was great. The chicken properly soaked up the marinade which allowed me to taste it in every bite. The charbroiled chicken was cooked to a tender and juicy temp. The tomatoes were a nice touch with their acidity and the extra garlic was just fun. The chicken kebab cost $8.75.I ate at their small bar and service was active and friendly. It seemed to be the place where the servers congregated, which allowed me to chit chat and be served rather quickly. Everyone was very nice."], ["Yannis A.", "Fantastic food if you like Mediterranean and Middle Eastern. Good prices.

So he took me here after our hike. We started off with the pita and hummus. I must say that the hummus was nice and fresh and the pita came out warm as well. But then to my entree, I got the lamb shawarma wrap. I thought it was extremely flavorless. I definitely like Mamas in North Park better. This absolutely had no flavor, even when I dipped it in hot sauce. Nothing. My friend got the Aladdin's Mediterranean chicken salad and OMG that tasted so much better than the lamb shawarma! That chicken salad was delicious. Next time I will order the right thing and get the Mediterranean chicken salad."], ["Andy R.", "One of the best, if not the best Mediterranean food I've ever had!

So refreshing and the chicken is nicely seasoned. It's also huge...could only eat half of it. My husband got the lamb shawarma sandwich which was juicy with a cinammony kick and tangy yogurt sauce.

Would come here again to try an entree/platter for dinner!"], ["Heihachiro K.", "This place is the best Greek/Mediterranean food I've had in San Diego. Their lamb and chicken shawarma dishes are on point. Also, the hummus is awesome and it's fresh. It doesn't sit there for days and have that weird discolored look to it. I highly recommend this place for lunch. Oh and the salads are enormous, I eat those a lot. Price point is middle of the road. Salads are about $12 and shawarma sandwiches are about $10-11. They have a ton of other shit too. Go there and try it and thank me later. Actually, try the falafel too.

Lamb kebabs, chicken kebabs, falafel, biryanis which added to about $75. The lamb was really overcooked and inedible, chicken was good though.

There were three of us, and we got Kebeh, which where huge (these ones are made of lamb), Baba Ghanouj, Pita Bread, Falafel, and one of the kebob platters.

I live about 2 hours from here, but when I go to SD, I try to make a stop. This place is so worth a try!! 1. Portions are huge! If you don't eat a lot, I suggest sharing or taking the other half togo. You can also take your soda togo when you leave! 2. Not only are the portions big, but the taste and quality is top notch. I usually get the chicken shwarma plate. It comes with a huge bowl of salad (which is delicious), rice, hummus, pita, garlic sauce, and chicken. 3. Pita bread is fresh! They have the best pita bread I've ever tried! The workers are so generous, so you can get more if you ask. 4. Dessert: Don't leave here without trying the baklava! It'll be the perfect end to your meal. 5. Service is wonderful here. Servers are so kind and friendly."], ["Conrad R.", "When Wifey suggests we go to Aladdin or similar place instead of some generic chain restaurant, I'm so happy.Busy lunchtime crowd, and the food still looked and tasted delicious. I thought maybe things would get sloppy with a packed house, but that wasn't the case.The rush was on! We promptly got seated and our server quickly put in our usual orders. I say that like we're weekly regulars, but we aren't since we moved. It's nice that the food quality is as great as when we first frequented the place. The sharable salads are bountiful, piled high with fresh ingredients.My fave is the koufta kebab sandwich with fries. It normally comes with a side salad, but I get to pick at Wifey's ginormous salad that she can't finish. This is one of those situations where I'd like to try a different menu item, but I end up picking something that never lets me down. I hope they didn't permanently change up the fries because this time they served up thin shoestring fries instead of their usual kind...not so much chunky wedges or steak fries, but they remind me of Ore-Ida Zesties. Either way, their fries are always served up perfectly piping hot and crispy. Service is quick and friendly and the servers check up on us often to make sure we're doing ok. I've noticed a couple of small restaurants within walking distance come and go, but Aladdin Restaurant will stick around for awhile longer providing great customer service and delicious food to the neighborhood."], ["Reyna M.", "It was our first time here and the food was good,service was ok! Our sodas cups were never refilled unless we asked , but they make sure to \u00a0charge you 18%service fee + tax + svc! I didn't like that at all. You should not impose such fees unless you come in with a large party. If you don't mind the service fees then give it try."], ["Martin L.", "This is simply the best place in San Diego for salads.

Starting with fresh pita & hummus, and as a main dish I frequently order their Chicken Shawerma (I love the garlic sauce but I skip the tomatoes), and if I am super hungry, I will add a salad. Fear not if you have picky children (or adults) in your party, they have tasty pizza as well. I have been to Alladin with a friend who has a very picky 4 year old, but he keeps quiet as soon as his own \"large pizza\" as he calls it arrives; in all actuality it's a little larger than an individual pizza at CPK, but hey he is 4, picky, and it kept him quiet both times I ate dinner with his Mom, a good friend & fellow lover of Alladin.I ordered the Halibut Arrabiata on my last visit and it was very good, I am very picky about fish and Italian food, having grown up eating both frequently, but I was very impressed with theirs, and would order it again if i were craving a healthy & tasty fish dish. The halibut came with rice, pita & hummus, bit I always order extra pita & hummus, as an appetizer, because it's so delicious.They also have a plethora of teas, and I love tea when I can find it, the mango and passionfruit are my favorites at this restaurant, and they have refills on teas as well as sodas (many restaurants are stopping that method, not so here). Overall, one of my most favorite restaurants, you can linger over a meal, and you never feel rushed. All too often, even at nicer restaurants I feel like they are just wanting to get me in & out flip the table and serve another guest; not so here. Alladin Mediterranean Cafe will always make you feel comfortable, as if you were dining at an establishment owned by friends & for that very reason I will always return and leave with a full tummy and a smile on my face."], ["Sam M.", "My favorite Greek/Mediterranean restaurant!

When i asked, she said it was 'farmer brothers'. \u00a0i had 4 glasses of iced tea because it was so delicious.both my friend and i ordered baklava and -- wow, it was amazing. obviously fresh, wonderfully flaky, with a solid middle. i am sure it was handmade there at the restaurant.this is the only greek food in all of san diego for me. the service was quick and very kind. it was a comfortable place to sit in and go too. very casual, relaxed, and regularly filled."], ["Zenia P.", "Small Mediterranean and Greek Cafe with private parking lot shared with neighboring businesses in North Park. Went for dinner when it wasn't so busy on a Sunday...until after we were seated, more people showed up. We ordered an appetizer of hummus and pita and shared a Super Greek Combo (Gyros, Souvlaki (one beef skewer) & Spanakopita (slice of traditional spinach pie) with pita, rice pilaf and Greek salad. This dish is perfect for two people. The Greek salad had a big slice of feta cheese on top, not crumbled in the salad. Aside from the DIY feta, this combo platter was very yummy! This cafe also serves breakfast and lunch. Great place to get your Greek food on!"], ["Mike N.", "This place is my favorite Greek place. \u00a0My husband and I come here once a week, the waitresses know us and always greet us with two glasses of iced tea, followed by \"Would you like your usual?\" \u00a0It's great.I always get the falafel platter, which comes with a simple salad, rice pilaf and pita bread. \u00a0The falafels are the best I've ever had. \u00a0I've never had a falafel that compares with theirs. \u00a0My husband usually gets the Gyro and Chicken platter, which is equally delicious.Looking for great Greek in a homey atmosphere? \u00a0Come here!"], ["Aaron H.", "What a pleasant surprise! I don't think this place gets enough attention and recognition because of it's location and the places that surround it. Someone told me awhile a go to stay away from here. When I remember who that person is, they're getting a punch in the mouth. That's what it feels like from being neglected from going here that long.Tiny little older school feel in this place, but nostalgic and cool. Good amount of people in here so it's starting to get my hopes up and I love Greek food. Super nice waitress seats me handling this entire place and take out orders with grace and never ending smile. It was impressive to see her hit 4 tables in one swoop.I got the mousaka plate. Looks amazing and tastes even better. Wish the mousaka portion was a little larger, but it was absolutely delicious. Big serving of rice done right. The salad they put some attention in to. Very fresh and put together with care and the perfect amount of dressing. I really appreciate when places can do this even when they're busy. The bread is fresh and tasty as well. Perfect temperature and texture. You can't lose going here. I'll be back soon. Gotta respect the range on the menu."], ["Aline M.", "Definitely a mom and pop shop. This place is amazing. I had the gyros plate and the portion was very generous. The service is GREAT!! The owner is soooo nice and cares so much about his restaurant. Most people seem like regulars and the owner checks on every table. I'm \u00a0Very attentive. An added benefit is the owner's son who works the cash register and slightly resembles a Greek god."], ["Andy A.", "This place has amazing food at reasonable prices. It looks like an old school diner, and it'd be easy to pass it right by it. Do yourself a favor and go in to try it."], ["M D.", "This isn't the best Greek food I've ever had, but pretty close. I am a huge Greek food lover and have tried it around Europe and the states. This place will make you very happy. Their chicken kabobs are heavenly and their rice taste like someone's mother made it (maybe that's the case). I order take out a lot from here. The only advice I would give to them, is to lighten up on the phone. Their customer service skills aren't as great as their food, but I'm willing to look past it because the food is worth it."], ["Darci D.", "I absolutely love this place! Chicken breast salad is one of the few salads I will actually go to a restaurant for. Lamb shank is also very good and so is the 1/2 chicken plate. Their lemon potatoes are great! Staff is always very friendly and I like how casual it is. Portions and prices are right. You can never go wrong with the chicken, it's always very tender and flavorful."], ["Huyen N.", "Hmmm really want to give Olympic a 4.5 stars but it is not quite a 5 so I'm going with the 4.Great place for gyros wrap, sal-d, and fresh pita bread. I often get the gyro plate and that would get me almost two meals. Lunch combo with sandwich and a choice of fries or soup is a great deal. Will miss living right around the corner from this cafe."], ["Ellie A.", "Great spot for breakfast. My family and I have been coming here for years! I always order the spinach and feta scramble. It's big enough to share! They also have delcicious French toast."], ["Cole J.", "We were looking for Greek faire, and had passed Olymique Cafe many times. \u00a0We are so glad we finally made it in. Tender steak souvlaki and feather light spanikopita. Fantastic. \u00a0We will revisit soon."], ["Brit M.", "Another great dinner finished. \u00a0I love the kabob plate, always fresh items! \u00a0A very easy place to enjoy a great meal. \u00a0Family owned and operated! \u00a0You will always a family member working, multiple generations!Easy to get to, easy to park, easy to be comfortable!Try the chocolate covered pretzel rods when Mom has them out!!"], ["Rachel S.", "i love this place. \u00a0went earlier this week and had the gyro and chicken kabob plate. \u00a0out of this world delicious! \u00a0the leftovers were good too. \u00a0today i had the lamb shank daily special. \u00a0the lady told me they had just taken it out of the oven after cooking for hours. \u00a0it was spectacular. \u00a0the deserts look really good, i haven't been able to try any of those. \u00a0i'd recommend this little north park gem to anybody looking for yummy greek food. \u00a0opa!!"], ["Nhan N.", "Been going here for years. \u00a0Love Rosa and her sister. \u00a0They are always super Nice and hard working. \u00a0Food is above average.
