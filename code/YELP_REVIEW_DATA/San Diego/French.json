It was every bit as rich and delicious as it sounds. The atmosphere was near perfect; you'd almost forget you weren't in Europe if not for the souvenirs and the San Diego traffic. I wouldn't chastise them for being located in San Diego as I'd have never had the chance to visit if they weren't but the souvenirs seemed an odd choice for an otherwise upscale place. Staff was highly attentive, friendly, polite, and also invisible and ever-present in a way that you would expect from a place with prices like this. My only real complaint was the noise. It appears that the glass walls which so nicely completed the cafe atmosphere also amplified every conversation to quite the din. (It almost seemed louder than the crowded and boisterous pub in which I'm writing this.)Despite the clamor, it was a wonderful escape from the day and finish to the evening."], ["Ashley C.", "Had a wonderful experience with great service. It is such a cute place (loved the interior).We ordered the \"poached eggs with wild mushroom and sage-truffle buerre blanc,\" \"mussels and frites\" and the \"lavender lemonade.\"We went in wanting to order the \"croque madame,\" but made a mistake and ordered the poached eggs with wild mushroom... It was okay (not the greatest), wished there was more flavor to it, but wasn't bad. BUT the mussels and frites were GREAT. Enjoyed the little bit of soup on the bottom, fries, and the taste of mussels - great combo.LAVENDER LEMONADE IS A MUST TRY."], ["Charlie B.", "Service was mediocre at best, I believe it was the owner and a server working at the time. They were busy setting up for dinner and cleaning up after lunch so I feel I didn't get the attention they normally would give. \u00a0Which is totally fine for what I came in for (calm relaxing meal with a view) I got exactly that. Parking is decent at this hour. But I can imagine how horrible it is during meal times. The fact that it is raining would make me not want to walk a distance to get in. Rain made dinning outside undesirable, so I got a seat by the door, I enjoyed the sounds and cool breeze white I sipped my Rose Mimosa (I recomend).I stared with a cup of Soup Du Jour, it hit the spot. I didn't care for the complimentary water, it had a hint of filtered tap water. Maybe if they double up on filters it would have a better flavor? Or add a sprig of something to hide the taste. Ha. I decided on ordering their version of eggs Benedict \"Croque Madame\" which was fairly pleasant. The bread was interesting to say the least. I was a satisfying experience overall. Thus the 5 stars. I didn't reduce the one star for service because it wasn't a big deal. But if you are one of those that needs constant attention then pick a different time. Or make sure to make eye contact with the servers. I was in my own world at the time.

It comes w/ pancetta, brioche croutons, two poached eggs, over a spread of greens that is an exercise for the mouth. It is the perfect rendition of taste & exquisite flavor that makes this place a cute dining spot.Because I got here when they were first setting up, the waiter forgot to top off my coffee, as I was tucked behind the corner. But as I got ready to leave, he offered to pour me a cup of coffee to go.I plan to return again, the next time I am in the area.

The attention to detail is incredible, both in the delicious food and the overall atmosphere and experience. It's expensive, but so worth it.

Great food, great service, and affordable.The brunch entrees range from $14.50 - $21. You definitely have to try one of the flavored mimosas ($8.50). \u00a0Out of all of the flavors (pomegranate, rose, orange juice, lavender lemonade) the lavender lemonade is hands down my favorite. \u00a0In my opinion the two best brunch options are the poached eggs and the Croque Madame. The sauce on the poached eggs combined with the truffled mushrooms is one of the best breakfast items I have ever tried.It's not the cheapest brunch spot but for the quality of the food it is definitely worth it. \u00a0The inside is small and quaint and almost feels like you are dinning in someone's house. The patio is also small but has plenty of shade which is perfect on a sunny day.I only have 2 very small gripes. No bottomless mimosas and the view is of 9th street, which is great for people watching but that's about it. \u00a0Other than that this place is amazing. If you are in San Diego especially East Village you have to stop in at least once and try cafe chloe for brunch!"], ["Jane K.", "I was so excited to pay Cafe Chloe a visit, but I'm not sure what makes it very special. The interior is small and intimate with a few seats on the sidewalk patio and the food was mediocre ( but pretty). Also, the service was pretttttty daaang...slow.I had their Steak Frites & their Mushroom with Eggs with their Lavender Lemonade, Bloody Mary, and some hot coffee.Steak Frites (add a egg for an extra cost): The temperature was really off. The steak was very cold, and the herb butter was barely melted on top. I saw them constructing my salad in the kitchen window. They put the fries & arugula salad first, then the steak a few minutes later... and then added the butter 5 minutes later... and then added the egg 5 minutes after that.. then served it to us cold. I was prettttty sad but was too hungry to complain. I think it could've been much better if it was just prepared and served at the correct temperature.Zucchini Soup= looked pretty, would have tasted good, but again... was cold.Mushroom with poached eggs= Delish!! It's a very straightforward dish with bunch of sauteed mushrooms over some lovely bread. It was a great dish.Didn't have the best experience, but I would definitely check this place out/ visit them again."], ["Dan S.", "Been here a few times for breakfast and brunch and have found the food first rate.

Kinda bummed...I wished they just had their regular menu that they're known for, why switch it up? Decided to give this place a shot anyways. Couldn't be that bad right? 4 course menu.(Amuse-Oyster Shooter) Oyster with passion fruit and guava granita - Never had these flavors with an oyster before. \u00a0But the oyster was fishy and had some cracked shells in it! Someone didn't know how to shuck em right. \u00a0Had to spit the shells back out. No bueno.Frisee Salad (w/wild mushroom, pan-fried sweetbreads & bacon vinaigrette) - It was ok. \u00a0Not a big frisee person. \u00a0I could've just went for a normal salad, but they had to fancy it up with this salad, but that's just me.Pan-seared Sandbass (sea bass) - This dish was mediocre. \u00a0Bit bland with the savoy cabbage and the broth they had on the bottom, but the fish was cooked well.Braised Beef Cheeks - This dish was better than the sand bass. \u00a0Just had more interesting flavors and the beef cheek was tender.Rose lychee sorbet - \u00a0Great! This was so refreshing after a mediocre meal we had. \u00a0Loved the \"vanilla pearls\" that they described it as, but we all know it's just tapioca. \u00a0I also liked the crispy rice. It was a nice finishing touch!Dark Chocolate Moelleux - Great ending to this meal. So rich and yummy. Balanced out with the chocolate ice cream and raspberries.All in all, good service but wasn't a fan of their prix fix menu... Only the desserts stood out."], ["Ray L.", "Warning, scam central.Not serving restaurant week brunch even though their menu says so.

The place is absolutely adorable. It was quite small, but very cozy and intimate. Perfect for a date night in downtown. My friends and I came here for restaurant week. I've always wanted to come here but I believe you have to put a credit card on file to make resos for RW, which I'm not a fan of and have been avoiding it, but came to terms. I was sad that the RW menu wasn't as French as it could be, but it was still good. I was hoping for some escargot! They had mussels and fries with some sausages in the broth. The mussels were good, but the broth was extremely salty. And I had my share fair of good mussels broth. I could not take a liking to the saltiness of the broth at all. For my entree I ordered the duck. It came with a duck leg over a bed of lentil beans and a potato puree with some cranberry sauce. The duck was delicious! Very flavorful, but hard to eat because it was a leg. I'm not a fan of lentils, but they did a good job on it. The cranberry sauce brought the dish together. My friend had the steak, and I ate her leftovers and it was extremely salty! I didn't like it. I did though enjoy my dessert- the raspberry creme brulee. It had actual raspberry in the brulee which is always a plus in my book!I felt like this was more of American New instead of French, but maybe it was just the RW menu. I probably would not go out of my way to eat here again, but did enjoy some of their food."], ["Chris R.", "We were here on Padres Opening Day. \u00a0Weather was great, we sat outside with the view of people spilling over the crowded Petco Park Stadium. \u00a0We had the Moules Frites, Fromage Plate with organic honey comb and house-made compote and Steak Frites. \u00a0Everything was delicious! \u00a0I wanted to get something I would have typically enjoyed in Belgium or France - the moules frites. \u00a0Although that dish served here was pretty good, it is not far from a typical bowl of it that I would have. \u00a0Just the occasion of having it was good enough for me :) The fromage plate was mouth watering gorgeous - I liked the organic honey WITH the honey comb, delish! \u00a0And the compote was a great mix also with the fromage. \u00a0I would definitely go back for that! \u00a0The steak frites was so-so. \u00a0Nothing too outstanding from steak I normally have :)The decor was admirable, the staff was utterly charming, as is the whole venu. \u00a0I don't live in the neighborhood but if an occasion arises, I would drive out of my way to visit again."], ["Jaimi H.", "First of all this place is the cutest most adorable little cafe.

We were promptly and generously introduced to our server and presented with water and menus.The boyfriend and I opted to share the pomme frites with a trio of dips, and each ordered a bottle of beer. They have a decent selection catering to all types of cravings, priced a tad bit on the higher side. I chose the 3 Monts Golden Ale, from France (750ml, $8), and the boyfriend went with a Great Divide Titan IPA (standard pint, $7).The pomme frites ($8) were delicate, crispy, seasoned perfectly, and the dips were also enjoyable. The watercress was our least favorite, but the saffron and house-made ketchup were delicious.For our entrees, I got the macaroni with pancetta and blue gratin ($15). It was incredibly cheesy and creamy at the same time. The noodles were soft and the dish was piping hot when they brought it out. Perfect comfort food.The boyfriend's steak & frites ($16.5) was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a \u00a0nice strong char. The frites (he sure had a lot that day!) were plentiful, and the bed of greens was a good refresher. He noted that the tomato was probably the most flavorful tomato he'd ever had.We were checked upon frequently with impeccable service, and would recommend Cafe Chloe to any couple looking for a casual but intimate dining experience! The only thing missing from the true French experience was a complimentary baguette with butter, but I was way too full and content with my meal to complain :)"], ["Nicole E.", "Really adorable place, right on the street corner.

My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. We were seated right away indoors without reservations but it quickly got packed!We shared the following from the petite plates section of the menu:- Fromage Plate (Cheese Plate): came with 3 different cheeses, crostinis, grapes, date compote, green apple slices, and honey. Everything was DELICIOUS!!!! This was my favorite dish of the night. I enjoyed all the cheeses, tasted great with my glass of Riesling. - Moules Frites: mussels and fries. I loved the sauce/broth the mussels came in. Not the best mussels dish I've ever had but it was savory and tasty. The fries were very thin and shoestringy which I liked. - Steak Tartar: if you like rare meat, this is definitely worth a try! The mound of pieces of rare steak came on a deconstructed plate of separate herbs and elements which we were able to mix in with the meat ourselves, including a small runny egg on top. I enjoyed this steak tartar but it didn't blow me away. - Gem Salad: my least fave of the night. We ordered this just because we wanted to balance out the dinner with some greens. Pretty much a small but tasty iceberg lettuce salad, but nothing out of the ordinary. I wouldn't really recommend this one.Service was fantastic! Our server (possibly the manager? owner?) was very friendly and checked up on us throughout the night. The staff was also really good about changing out our plates and utensils."], ["Bruce F.", "A few service missteps aside, our visit to Cafe Chloe last night was exceptional. The cuisine was spot on. I enjoyed to cold beet borscht very much. The oysters were served with a mango preserve which took us by surprise and at first, we weren't sure it belonged there. It grew on us. Nicely done. Our guests had the duck confit, salmon, and the roasted half chicken, all expertly prepared. I think the consensus was the roast chicken was our favorite. My chief complaint about Cafe Chloe is its cramped quarters. Perhaps management was going for the Parisian cafe experience, \u00a0transplanted to San Diego's East Village. Some might consider the small space \"intimate\" and \u00a0reminiscent of their experience in Paris. But in San Diego, where restaurant space is in plentiful supply, I find this space to be somewhat uncomfortable. I'm not a big person, but found \u00a0the small wooden chairs not \"ample\" enough, hastening a departure earlier than I would have liked. That said, there is admittedly some intangible charm going on here that attracts an enthusiastic following. Dessert, by the way, was fantastic and any place that pours Pedro Ximenez is A-OK in my book!!"], ["Shaked E.", "Love the place. Good vibes, nice seat out side.

(2) Steak frites: hearty portion of medium rare deliciousness on a mountain of shoestring fries and a side of arugula. \u00a0This is a constant on their menu - and we're thankful for it! (3) They have a seasonal changing menu - I also love their rabbit cassoulet (pure comfort food) and their charcuterie board (prosciutto, salami, other cured meats with pate, mustard, a plum spread - ideal item to share with the table). \u00a0Low-lights: (1) I don't love their oysters - too fishy for me. \u00a0(2) They have a really cute sidewalk patio, but the crowd on that street corner isn't always the best - so sitting outside comes with the risk of a less than relaxing dining experience. \u00a0(3) I have nothing.

They tried to make us as comfy as possible.FOOD: I tried my friend's CHOCOLATE CROISSANT and i had the CROQUE MADAME and MORNING BUN. The Croque was a a french version of eggs benni (which is my all time fave) but it was oookay. The ham was super thick, not proportional to the thin slice of toast under it, and the gravy on top wasnt as tasty as a hollandaise sauce, more like gravy. I def respect different variations of foods from different cultures and restaurants but this one didnt tickle my fancy. The Chocolate croissant and Morning Bun were awesome though! not sure if i'd wait a half hour or hour for them but if i can pick it up to go i would next time. It wasn't that memorable for brunch so like i said i would like to give this place another chance for dinner given the great reviews.PRICE: I dont mind spending money on food, especially after living in SF for so many years and discovering hole in the wall/mom and pop shops have the best quality meals, but i was a little disappointed... especially to spend 14$ on a smaller portioned plate.

We decided it was a nice enough night that we sat out in the patio. It was a nice little corner spot and it wasn't too cold out with the heaters overhead.Our waitress was really nice and gave us great suggestions for first timers. We went with the Fois Gras for an appetizer. It was rich and flavorful with a bit of texture added with the crunch of a bread crumble and tartness of the grapes atop the Fois. We ordered the Coq Au Vin and Steak Frites. I enjoyed the Steak Frites--the herb butter was perfectly melty and ran through to my frites with the steak juices creating a lovely sauce. Boyfriend said the breast meat on his chicken was a little dry in the center but the outside was tender. However both my boyfriend and I noticed how both plates weren't exactly served hot; kind of as if they were made and left waiting a bit before they were brought out. Which I realized between dinner and dessert took a bit of time and our waitress had even admitted that someone snagged our dessert for another table before she got to it. Dessert was a chocolate bread pudding that had delicious layers of flavor and interesting accompaniments like chestnuts which I don't usually associate with bread pudding but I liked the flavor and texture it brought.They did mention how everything is made in house and fresh, which I could gather from our experience.

It tasted like a Cinnabon and a cinnamon roll had a beautiful home made organic baby Lol. I only had one bite but was tempted to have many more. My fianc\u00e9 liked it so much he discouraged me from having another bite lol.Our entrees took about 25 minutes to come.

I had the basque style eggs ( 2 sunny side up eggs over saut\u00e9ed sweet peppers and Proscuitto, topped with pine nuts served with french country bread). The peppers and proscuitto played off of one another nicely and the pine nuts complemented the dish quite well. The whole wheat french country bread \u00a0tasted great too!

The place is super cute but also small. Our group of 6 had a nice big round table in the back, near the open patio door so we got a nice breeze.

Of course it took more time until our orders were taken, and then we proceeded to wait for 50 minutes until our food came. On their menu they explicitly state to allow 20 minutes for the food to come as they cook everything to order, blah blah. I feel like every restaurant cooks almost everything to order, but when you're sitting there for almost an hour, starving, and watching everyone else around you get their food, there's a problem. Once the food arrived, we all thought it was ok but nothing special. I had the croque Madame, which I found rather disappointing. I've had it in France, and I've had it at numerous other places in cali, so I know what a good one tastes like. Their infamous morning bun turned out to be pretty much the same thing as monkey bread, and my friends found it to be too sweet. Our service was also super spotty, and we were never able to flag down someone for water refills.

I despise the city for its bourgeoisie attitude, dirty metro system, and failure to control the onslaught of obnoxious American tourists.

The photos on the walls, the chairs, the menu, the bathroom, even their logo. It is all as quaint and French as you can get. Really gets you in the relaxed mood, especially if you come in for a late evening dessert under the candlelight. We had a chance to try the Pistachio Bread Pudding and Berry Pie, which were both splendid. The portions are decently sized and give you a chance to experience each dish to the fullest without stuffing yourself. Not too sweet and with a delicate texture, both were quite impressive.

I then opted for the Basque Eggs, \u00a0which are sunny side up with peppers,onions,and \u00a0topped with pine nuts. I didn't know that eggs could taste this good, seriously! Normally, I think of eggs like water, yes Fiji tastes better than Poland Spring, but not by much. \u00a0I really did notice a difference here, and I think it has to do with this restaurants commitment to organic and locally produced products. This meal served with toast on the side was one of my most memorable brunches in a while.The final cost with a kettle of tea, was $40.00 for two, not exactly cheap by San Diego standards.

Excellent chilled out brunch in a bro'd out area."], ["Jay D.", "This is the type of place you search and search for in a new city. Fortunate to have it within walking distance and were planning to take full advantage of it. It really does feel different from all the other brunch and coffee spots.

I am lucky enough to live one block away so I can enjoy this gem any time I desire. The place has great ambience. I have been many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have never been disappointed. Its a great place to take out of towners for a unique experience. Dinners in Cafe Chloe are super romantic, as the entire place is candle lit. Never had a bad meal here from the quiche to steak Frites. Go to Cafe Chloe now!"], ["Andrew S.", "Thank you again to Restaurant Week for exposing me another incredible San Diego restaurant. If you're looking for a romantic and delicious French experience, book a reservation now. The atmosphere is cozy, dimly lit, and reminiscent of a night in Paris. The small \"smoking tables\" outside on the patio add to the effect. Some friends and I ordered several dishes off the restaurant week menu and were very happy with everything we ordered.The peasant style cassoulet, a lamb stew of sorts with lamb sausage and white beans was incredible. The lamb was very flavorful and the other flavors balanced the food well. All of the dishes, in fact, had very complex, but complimentary flavors.The duck confit was prepared perfectly and had lentils and a wonderful cranberry sauce.We also enjoyed the macaroni with pancetta, a house salad, and the white raspberry cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but the winner was the bread pudding. MY GOODNESS it was incredible; it was easily one of the top five desserts I've had in San Diego. Bread pudding is a dessert I usually overlook, but I'm glad we decided to order one to share. The gianduja ice cream, the caramel, and more chocolate were so rich, yet so balanced. Go here just to have this dessert. Once you're there, order everything else. You'll be happy."], ["Ge C.", "Like the service... do not ORDER the salad with pancetta and \u00a0poached eggs on top.they never drained the grease. It was so greasy could no eated it. I do like the muscles dish."], ["Joanna L.", "Atmostphere: I sat outside and it was really nice for the most part - however, it does get dark at night (they have dim outdoor lighting), the traffic gets a bit noisy, and sometimes its hard to get the waitresses attention. But this is one of the few upsets I had of this place.Food:Fromage Plate (cheese plate) - this was really yummy. They had a spread of blue, brie, and parmesan cheese with sides of nuts, honey (with the comb!), apple slices, apricot jam, and small baguette bites. I really enjoyed it, although the portion is big enough for maybe 3 or more!Steak Frites - the steak was extremely tender, the portion was huge. The garlic butter it came with was savory and flavorful. The shoestring fries that it came with were perfectly cooked - and they give a huge portion too! The arugula salad compliments the steak perfectly. Duck Confit - the duck was really tasty as well. It was a little bit salty for me, but the sauces it comes with are extremely flavorful. The portion was smaller imagined though.Clafoutis (berry bread pudding w/ ice cream) - if you like bread pudding and berries, this is the dessert for you. It's a little heavy, but the flavors of the tart berries, soft bread, and sweet ice cream go well together.Mint Chocolate Ice Cream - we actually got this one for free! It was extremely decadent, and the minty flavor was really strong, but really good!Def try if you're around gaslamp!"], ["Garrett Kaeo W.", "I came for dinner without setting a reservation. We were sat right away but the they had two options for seating since we did not have a reservation, so I do recommend setting one.Once sat we order some drinks, and took a peak at the menu. Once drink arrived I ordered us the hand-chopped steak tartare. The was great, I loved the fact that they did not pre-mix in all the indigents, or even beat the egg yolk in. We mixed in just the right amount of indigents, and then I asked for more bread to finish off the plate.After this I ordered pommes frites moules. Which were great, the sauce was just right amount of butter, wine, and garlic.

The restaurant has a classy but very neighborhood-cafe feel at the same time. There are lots of windows that allow alot of breeze throughout which gives it a nice airy feel inside so you don't feel cramped even in a small cafe. \u00a0They have a nice patio area but again, space is limited and ordering it up can prove to be challenging if your table can't hold all the food, as was our case. \u00a0 I came for late breakfast/brunch with some girlfriends around 11am. \u00a0They won't seat you until your entire party is there. \u00a0The menu is a nice offering of starters, salads and entrees for a small cafe. \u00a0We ordered the fromage plate (cheese plate) with honeycomb which comes with 3 cheeses they have available for the day and house-made compote. We also had the pomme frittes, the poached eggs with wild mushrooms & sage-truffle beurre blanc and the vanilla pain perdu-french toast. \u00a0I also ordered the chuao chocolate mocha and my friends tried the spiced maya version. \u00a0The food was great! \u00a0LOVED the poached eggs with wild mushrooms. \u00a0The cheese plate was nice but compared to the cheese with honeycomb at Cucina Enoteca, I would pass on this one but that's just personal preference. \u00a0I tend to like creamier/soft cheeses like brie but this one does give you more variety so it's just what you like. \u00a0It is a nice and VERY popular cheese plate. \u00a0My girlfriends get it every time they come so clearly they're fans and almost every table I saw had the cheese plate so obviously it's a favorite! \u00a0The pomme frittes were good but I only had a couple so can't speak too in-depth about them. \u00a0The french toast was my least favorite thing and I would not order it again. \u00a0It looks amazing but I didn't feel the taste lived up to the visual and compared to some other french toast I've had, again, I'd pass. \u00a0The mocha was very good but it was a pretty hefty price tag. \u00a0It was $5.25 for a fair offering but it comes in a cup that's more like a soup bowl with no handle and a spoon so not as convenient to drink from as us Americans are use to. \u00a0Service was ok, a bit generic. Server was nice enough but very flat and some really LONG gaps between for water refills and even a late coffee order. \u00a0Paying the bill also took some time. \u00a0Great little spot with some good food and lovely vibe. \u00a0Heard dinner is also very good and can be a nice romantic dine if you sit higher up in the dining hall for privacy. \u00a0Some items bit pricier while others are very reasonable so cost will depend largely on what you offer. \u00a0Definitely would come back again to discover more or enjoy the poached eggs and wild mushrooms!"], ["Brandy C.", "This is my third time visiting here, and I still walked out with my disappointment. \u00a0The seafood is not fresh at all!!!!!!! \u00a0I had really bad dinning experience here again! \u00a0Why????"], ["Tammy N.", "Meh. 2.5 stars.I came here twice. The first time I got their special which was a grilled cheese with thin apple slices and a small slice of prosciutto. $14-$16 (i forgot exactly how much). I also got spicy hot chocolate ($8).The second time was the wheat pancakes. $12The wheat pancakes helped boost my ratings from a 2 stars to a 2.5 because they were quite good! They came with apple flavored sauce and syrup and were pretty hearty. FIRST VISIT: My grilled cheese was just not good. The meal was pricey, not hearty nor filling and the bread was so so hard and tough. It was really hard to eat in general so of course it made my overall dining experience not that great. I didn't like the combination of the cheese they used with the apple and prosciutto, it was just not paired well in my opinion. I tried their spicy chocolate latte which was good but it was around $8 which is expensive for hot chocolate =(.SECOND VISIT: My wheat pancakes were good. My two friends ordered the eggs+herbed butter+bread+ bacon and the other one got eggs over bread also. Again the bread was super tough and hard and although my order was a good size, their food was puny. \u00a0I seriously thought their \"entree\" were the size of a snack for me. The portions here are not generous at all (except for maybe the hot chocolate which is served in a large mug).I wouldn't recommend anything that has bread here because the bread is super hard and not enjoyable to eat. Overall the portions are small, everything is pricey and food is not that great.Service was good both times but sorry Cafe Chloe, I was not happy with the dining experience =(."], ["Carlotta Q.", "Had a chance to have a birthday dinner here during Comic-Con and I loved it.

When we arrived we were greeted adorably at the front by two sweet girls and were seated quickly- for a Friday night at prime dinner time, this was amazing!I love how the menu is coordinated seasonally with different pairings. The spicy zucchini soup du jour, moules-frites, and duck confit were delectable and perfectly portioned for two. The ambiance of this restaurant is very intimate and beautiful, with a soft candlelight glow and quaint, caf\u00e9 decor.

My Picks:-Lavender lemonade for bevie (there's a Mimosa version, too) -Poached eggs with wild mushrooms & sage truffle beurre blanc for breakfast -Soup de Jour is always something fun, and almost always vegetarian -Moules au vadovan (mussels served with frites) -Ratatouille tart (don't let the 'petit' part fool you...this is savory and filling) -The Lattes!

Slightly off the beaten path of Gaslamp district which is a plus.As French as Cafe Chloe sounds, which is not necessarily always a good thing...The tables seating four would be crowded if only two seated.

The steak frites were cooked perfectly and the shishito peppers were a nice touch. Definitely worth trying.For brunch, I've tried the mushroom tart appetizer, along with mussels as my entree. The tart (not sure if they still serve this anymore), was tasty and comforting. Solid choice as a starter. The mussels never let me down.

I got off the phone thinking I was in the wrong, but I looked and no where is there stated on their website or restaurant weeks website that 20% gratuity would be included.

There is patio seating, but it only accommodates four-person tables, and you have to deal with the homeless frequently passing by.

I saw a previous review mention $12 carafes, and last weekend we had a $15 carafe, so they've been consistently raising the price there.

The restaurant was busy, but maybe 2/3 full.Our server, Robert, never checked on us between getting our order and giving us our bill. We ordered coffee, but we're not offered a refill. We saw him check on other tables, and taste a wine with a customer (at 12:30 pm?), but not for us... Which was disappointing. Another staff brought our food. We were looking to order beignets, when we had finished, but our server just brought over the bill. In his defense, that was the sole time we were offered a top up on coffee.The red chili pulled pork skillet was okay, the pork was flavorful, but there was not much else to it. My wife had the country skillet, which was average.But I guess that's okay, I'm sure we can find good brunch service elsewhere."], ["Lindsay C.", "Service was great, which made up for a few missteps in our order. \u00a0Happy hour is a great deal. \u00a0The popcorn of the day was ok, but the spaetzle was excellent and my friend enjoyed the sliders."], ["Matthew B.", "Okay, here are my thoughts. The service was great. My waiter was friendly without being annoying. The place was easy to find, and a nice walk from my hotel.The menu was nice without being overly complicated. I checked in on Yelp and got free popcorn. It was nasty. Very greasy, stale, and generally unpleasant. I had a couple bites and left it. The wine was a nice French red. Good flavor without being overwhelming.The d\u00e9cor was corporate but comfortable.I ordered the stuffed chicken and it was boring. It was dry, not much flavor, and frankly average at best.I would not come back and I would not recommend this place."], ["Rachel B.", "Such and amazing find. Came for dinner a couple of nights ago and found ourselves back for brunch two days later! Everything that we have ordered has been amazing!

With dinner we were able to validate the parking so parking (valet) was less than at the convention center and a nice short walk which was an added benefit.Evan was our server, made some excellent recommendations. Service was prompt and attentive and he paid attention to the time for us. Evan recommended the pork tenderloin which was outstanding. The popcorn of the day was different and a nice appetizer while we waited for our additional person in our party to arrive (complimentary with Yelp check-in).Definitely would recommend for anyone as a nice stop downtown."], ["Kim B.", "The restaurant ambiance is captivating.

Hilarious, but sure, I'll go with it and order a glass of wine for dinner. In this case, a delicious Bordeaux.I have been wanting to visit The French Gourmet for a long time now. Cam's had this long standing vision of a lunch cafe, which is partially true, but I've been drooling over their dinner menu. We made the decision to come at the last minute, so Cam called ahead to see what the wait time would be like and they said they could seat us immediately. A short drive later, we were in the restaurant and seated at a cute table near the bakery bar.The waiters were all super attentive and worked really well together. The seating is pretty limited, but the food is amazing. Cam and I went with the Prix Fixe dinner so we chose an appetizer, entree, and dessert from their menu. The Prix Fixe starts at $27.99 and goes up or down depending on your selection. Between food, wine, tax, and tip, we spent about $120 on our entire meal.Olive-Rosemary Bruschetta. This was a really good take on bruschetta. Instead of raw tomatoes, they were perfectly oven roasted, which gave them a great flavor. The garlic aioli was a great compliment to the tomatoes and I really liked to toasted basil on top. This is probably the best bruschetta I've ever had.Grilled Pear, Arugula, and Warm Goat Cheese Mixed Green Salad. Cam really loved this salad. I thought the dressing was a little too creamy for me and I stayed away from the cheese, but Cam thought it was perfect for him (he loves cheese).Cabernet Braised Short Ribs with Mashed Potatoes. This was so, so, so good! The meat was literally falling apart in my fork and the mashed potatoes when really well with the entire dish. Some of my vegetables were slightly under cooked, but I love zucchini and yellow squash, so I didn't mind.Dijon-Crusted Rack of Lamb with Garlic Parsley Potatoes. Cam really liked the flavoring on the lamb, but it was a little difficult to eat since the meat didn't come off the bones so easily. I liked the potatoes a lot - they were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Cam didn't like his vegetables so much, but that's just Cam for you.Creme Brulee. This was pretty good, it's my go to dessert when I go out, but there was nothing terrible or extraordinary about this creme brulee. If you want your standard creme brulee, this is the dessert to get. I liked that it came with a raspberry to help cut through the sweetness, but wished it came with more than one.Millennium Cake. I ended up switching my creme brulee with Cam for this dessert. According to our waiter this is a layered cake of 3 different cakes with one of them being tiramisu. Can you say yum?! Similar to the creme brulee, I could have used more raspberries or berries in general to help cut through the decadence, but this was really good by itself.Overall, a really great experience and definitely worth a visit. I definitely want to come back for breakfast or lunch sometime."], ["Ashley H.", "I ordered an almond milk latte. The gal with the tongue ring (disgusting by the way) made me a mocha.I politely told her that I had ordered an almond milk latte. She proceeded to argue with me, telling me that I had ordered a mocha, which I had to reiterate 3 times that I did not. I have never ordered a mocha in my entire life. Terrible service, rushed, and rude. I've never argued with a person in the service industry about a coffee order. The worst!!"], ["jessica c.", "Our second time at the French Gourmet was fantastic!! We were so excited, since the first time was pretty epic. But this time was just as amazing, maybe even better! Stefan, our server, was great from the start. He was so welcoming and friendly, throughout the meal he made sure we were taken care of and enjoying ourselves. We had a chance to speak some francais with him and learn more about his life. Couldn't have asked for a better server.When it comes to the food, you can tell that everything is made with care and effort. The flavors are genuine and work in harmony. I had to get the Soupe a l'oignon as my first plate, again, and loved every delectable bite. My boyfriend had to get the pate platter, again, haha, just couldn't resist! For our second dishes, we both tried something new. Boy am I happy I did that!! The Cabernet-braised short ribs were AMAZING, melt in your mouth soft. The flavors were so well done, Stefan explained the meat is braised for 14 hours. SO. TENDER. With the patatoes au gratin and that fresh asparagus, my mouth was having a party! My boyfriend had the Chicken Marsala and he really enjoyed the dish too. For desert, we had the nutella crepes and the carrot cake. The crepes were delicious, good flavor and quantity. I kind of wish there had been some strawberries to complement the chocolate, but I can't complain they were delicious. The carrot cake was also really good.I really really enjoy the French Gourmet. I know there are a lot of great restaurant choices in San Diego but do your taste buds a favor and check this place out, whether for a family dinner or date night you can't go wrong. Bon appetit!!"], ["Lisa W.", "Haven't been here in years! And it wasn't as good as I remembered it 3 years ago... Or maybe my taste has gotten better?? The place hasn't gotten any different, still a small restaurant inside a bakery. A little cramped, not much seating, so make reservations. We got an awesome deal on living social with a 3 course meal for 2 for $40. We came on a Thursday night and it was full. I had French Gourmet 3 years ago and it was great. This time is wasn't so great. We got the escargot, mussels, steak, duck confit and desserts (creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and carrot cake). The escargot wasn't drench in pesto anymore, it was just garlic butter. The escargot was super bland, I had to add salt to every bite. The mussels were big but again very bland. No flavor to any bite. My duck confit was good but some parts were super dry. The mash potatoes were good and my BF enjoyed his steak but also had to add a bit salt and pepper for seasoning. Overall good felt like it got bland, I don't remember it being that bland. Dessert on the other hand was delicious! I love their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and their carrot cake was good. Pastries are good... Not so much food anymore."], ["Heihachiro K.", "Pretty sweet deal on Living Social - two apps, two entrees and two desserts for $40. Not bad! The restaurant is really small and it's essentially a bakery, but it's good. We came here on a Thursday night when we decided to utilize our Living Social coupon. Escargots \u00c0 La Bourguignonne - half a dozen escargots broiled in garlic herb butter. Not bad but needed some extra flavor, it was a bit bland.Greenlip Mussels Proven\u00e7ale - baked with garlic butter and bread crumbs. Same as the snails, a bit bland. I expected something more flavorful.Duck Leg Confit - served with braised red cabbage, black currant demi-glace, and mashed potatoes. I thought it was a bit dry, but still had good flavor. The mash was on point. Grass-Fed New Zealand Flat Iron Beef Steakgrilled and served with B\u00e9arnaise sauce and potatoes au gratin. This was perfectly cooked medium rare and super juicy and plentiful. It was a fat cut as well. Our waiter was actually impressed by the portion size of my steak. Overall, I was super impressed by this dish and would recommend it to anyone. Great job! Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e - I'm not really a fan of this dessert in generally, but I tasted it and it was alright.Carrot Cake - now this was absolutely fantastic.

I'll admit, sometimes I give out some 5 stars that are more of a 4.5 but this place is a hands down 5! The BF and I came here using a living social gift certificate. 2 pre fix menus which included appetizers, entrees and dessert. Everything was delicious! The BF had the warm goat cheese salad and I had the French onion soup. Super good!I was particularly impressed with our entrees. I ordered the salmon in a Dijon dressing. Besides the fact that the salmon was huge, it was so deliciously moist. Usually bigger pieces can dry out in the cooking process, but this salmon was baked to perfection. I asked if I could get it with mashed potatoes but our gracious server suggested I try the potatoes Au gratin. I was craving mashed potatoes so I declined even though he said the Au gratin were too die for. Well, not wanting me to miss out, he brought me a complimentary side of it with my meal and THANK GOD for him because they were so good. He was right. The mashed potatoes were good but the Au gratin were HEAVEN!!! By the time we got to dessert, we were stuffed but still enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse. Besides the great food, I was especially impressed by the service! The kindness and attentiveness of the staff was delightful and I really appreciated this awesome neighborhood gem! We'll definitely be back!"], ["Kathy T.", "UPDATE: I hadn't been here in awhile, and when we realized most bakeries in LaJolla and Pacific Beach were closing soon, we found ourselves here, at French Gourmet, to pick up some of the delicious-looking desserts I'd seen before when I was here while they were taking out all the booths (seating), to put in new carpet. (First review.)It was a mixed bag for me. Upon a second visit, with clear view of the entire restaurant, I got an entirely different picture of what this store was about. While it only bothers me minorly when retail clerks are rude. I get it. You don't want to be there. Well...this clerk was rude, and decidedly so. She wanted to be; you know, how when you run across people who just don't seem to like you? Eh, you can't like everyone. A common problem in Pacific Beach and La Jolla is that food service workers don't seem to be properly trained on how a customer should be treated. Must be part of the beach life is all I can figure. However, I've met some excellent servers in both PB and La Jolla.This place calls itself \"French Gourmet\" and I can assure you -there is nothing particularly French OR Gourmet about the place. Sure, you can get some passable sweets and desserts. What really bothers me though, is that their stuff is VERY EXPENSIVE, compared to other places that sell the same types of items. Just go inside and look to see for yourself. I inquired about some white chocolate balls that were coated in chopped and slivered almonds and then covered in coconut, and looked really interesting. They were in a pile on a tray, with no pricing on the tray. THEY WERE 1 INCH IN DIAMETER. When I asked the sales girl about price I expected an answer in pounds, i.e., $0.75/lb. SHE QUOTED $1.50 EACH!!! The chocolate eclair was way more than I usually pay and it wasn't even with the correct filling for me to be willing to pay $5.00. Everything else I was quoted was way overpriced also, and for that reason, this store is not for me, and I won't be returning any time soon.I did have to use the communal restroom while waiting for a couple of customers wanting catering STAT!, so I got a chance to see their restroom. Are you fracking kidding me? You have a somewhat-romantic decorating theme that you want to project for those pricy diners. If any woman dining here in the evening had to use the restroom (good chance!), she would see a disappointing bathroom, with a direct view of a men's urinal while she does her business. Gross. It was seriously disgusting. There is nothing pretty or \"French\" in the restroom, and this is the restroom fine dining patrons go? (Their dinner menu is on the pricier side.)This place could also use a MAJOR FACELIFT. Changing out the carpeting wasn't enough. The booths and frilly drapes looked worn. I'd go and like to see what their dinners are like, but it's a dress-up place, and that bathroom really needs some decorations. There wasn't even a full-length mirror.________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:We haven't eaten a dinner meal here yet, but I did buy some lovely pastries, which is why we went in the first place. Prior to going to The French Gourmet, I didn't know meals were also on the menu. Tip: French places usually are quite good ;)The day we went, there was a lot of activity with workers taking out all the booths, tables, etc., in the dining area. They were preparing to put in new carpeting. Can't wait to see it cause I've never seen the restaurant part before. Meanwhile, I was so stunned with all the pastries that were so beautiful and perfect looking, that I concentrated my eyes on the prize. I was here, after all, looking for a chocolate eclair (in the style where it's filled with custard). Well, I converted for a day to their traditional filling of chocolate (and I think theirs had hazelnut mixed with it?), and it was delicious! The kind and efficient lady who waited on me told me they could special order eclairs filled with custard for patrons. Very nice!!!We also had to get some other things to try:2 double-baked almond croissants (spectacular!), a lemon-cakey treat shaped like a rectangle of tart goodness (tart & just the right amount of 'puckery'), and last -we picked a strawberry-cakey treat (the cake part was great, although the strawberries were not very ripe and cut too large). In a lovely place that sells French pastries, there is always a chance you might pick something that's not to your liking. But that's not a fault of the baker/company, but rather, personal preference. I can't wait to go back!"], ["Jessica T.", "Thank you for writing to me Michel.I really did enjoy the Double Baked Chocolate Croissant and I loved the lemon cake as well but I am not sure of the name of it.We really want to come in and sit down and try some of the food options on the menu that we saw that sounds delicious. My kind of comfort food if you ask me.We will definitely be back!Thank you again for writing to me!"], ["Ree C.", "This quickly became my favorite place to dine in!

Unfortunately, we didn't realize that, while they were open, it was only the counter-the waiter wasn't there yet. One of the women behind the counter was kinda snide and unhelpful but the other one was super sweet, and sat us and helped us get drinks and order off the counter menu to eat at a table. Even though I was disappointed not to be able to have a mimosa and try the eggs Benedict, the simple breakfast wrap they could serve that early was pretty freaking delicious! Can't wait to go back and eat off their regular dining room menu!"], ["Hana T.", "Came here for Restaurant Week on a date with my husband. Tiny place with a small parking lot to the side. Everything looked nice and classy. Food! My husband got the escargot because we've never tried it before. I got the pate/charcuterie board. The escargot was really good! Swimming in butter, but delicious! The pate/charcuterie was interesting and had a bunch of different things. On to entrees! I had the duck, Husband had the pork chop. Really good! A bit heavy, but I think French food in general is a bit on the rich and heavy side. Dessert! Creme brulee and nutella crepes. Both classic favorites. The crepes were incredibly rich. The creme brulee was light. I should have gone for the creme brulee after my heavy dinner, but oh well. Learning experience!The service here was really good! It was a bit packed because it was a Friday night and Restaurant Week. The waiters were really friendly and energetic. I really enjoyed myself! Will definitely come back for date nights!"], ["Vanty D.", "Came here and tried their three course menu. We started off with their bruschetta and the baked mussels. The bruschetta was delicious and they actually spread a cheese layer on the bread before putting the tomatoes on. The baked mussels were good as well. I got the Dijon rack of lamb and the fianc\u00e9 got the short ribs. The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly right but the Dijon spread was a little overpowering and took away from the meal. The short ribs were tender and rich in flavor just like typical French food. Ended dinner with the lemon and chocolate tiramisu cake and both were just alright. Overall it was a good experience and great service from from the French waiters."], ["Corey C.", "I had brunch at The French Gourmet, and was very impressed. They serve breakfast until 3 pm, which is quite civilized. :-) The crepes florentine were made with ham and creamed spinach - I'm more used to chicken and leaf spinach, but this approach worked well. It was topped with a delicate and delicious fresh Hollandaise sauce.The waiter asked if I wanted the potatoes on the side, and I'm glad I said yes. Small cubes of potato, perfectly seasoned, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were a great addition to the meal.Lunch prices are very reasonable, about $9 - $12 for an entree.I was too full for dessert, but came back the next day with my wife to check out the pastry selection. We got a huge Napoleon and a chocolate shell with chocolate mousse and berries. Both were excellent.The only downside - we also got a baguette to go - it had a dry texture and very little flavor. I recommend the pastries, but not the bread."], ["Paula N.", "I love this place for latte's! They are located a block from my work so when I don't want office coffee I take a walk here and get their iced White Chocolate Mocha or their Caramel Machiatto. Service is always great and sometimes I grab one of their fresh baked cookies. I've only had food here once - breakfast wrap with potatoes (takeout) and it was decent. The wrap was good but the potatoes weren't cooked enough and were a little bland..but that won't keep me from the coffee!"], ["Lauren T.", "Review is for Restaurant Week 2015.I can't believe how small this place is! \u00a0I always thought this place was 2 stories, but according to my date, the upstairs is the French consulate. \u00a0For specials, like Restaurant Week, I highly recommend getting reservations. \u00a0There's less than 15 tables and you'll be sitting pretty close to another party. \u00a0To start the complementary bread was just okay. \u00a0I kind of expected more in terms of a nice French crusty baguette, but it was soft... more like an Italian roll. \u00a0For my appetizer, I selected the onion soup. \u00a0The best part was the cheese. \u00a0I was surprised that there wasn't more onions, but that's okay. \u00a0The fantastic ooey gooey cheese made up for it. \u00a0My man dish was the duck leg confit. \u00a0They weren't kidding when they advertised a duck leg. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy and tender. \u00a0The sides consisted of mashed potatoes and cauliflower. \u00a0The cauliflower was surprisingly well seasoned and crispy! Since my date didn't want me getting the same dessert as him, the creme brulee, I got the dessert of the day... passion fruit cake. \u00a0I would say it was up to the same standard as the creme brulee. \u00a0It was light and not too sweet, with real chunks of passion fruit. Overall, the portions were kind of small. \u00a0Not sure if that was because of restaurant week or if that's the standard size. \u00a0If they didn't want their portions to look so tiny, they should really consider using a smaller plate. \u00a0The service was excellent. \u00a0Props to our waiter, Stephane.

When you're serving food that needs to be eaten while standing up then take that into consideration. The options were too few that didn't require cutlery.

I did not care for the side dish which was french fries, I'm not sure how they came up with this combination. My husband had the onion soup and braised short ribs with mashed potatoes. The soup was delicious with a top layer of bubbly rich cheese and the short ribs melted in your mouth however there was a spice in the mashed potatoes that neither of us cared for.

Even a trip to Paris did not necessarily dissuade me of this opinion. So the French Gourmet had to reach a high bar to wow me. I would say it made a valid effort during restaurant week but still fell a little short. Consider this a 3.5 star review.My meal began with the charcuterie and p\u00e2t\u00e9 platter, which consisted of three slices of p\u00e2t\u00e9, a slice of what seemed to be prosciutto, and a couple of gherkin pickles. Very French and relatively tasty but not exactly super exciting. But this is probably my own fault in so far as the other options include items like seafood that I don't care for, and the process of elimination led me to this one.Moving on to the entr\u00e9e (oddly so-called on the menu because an entr\u00e9e is *not* a main course in French), I dug into my \"Mediterranean\" cornish game hen, an odd dish because I'm not entirely sure what's French about it. Yes, France borders the Mediterranean, but French cuisine isn't typically associated with the region nor does it typically include ingredients like cilantro. Nor is \"Cornish game hen\" particularly French, the bird having roots in England and the US. The dish was tasty enough, but, honestly, I was more impressed with the grilled cauliflower and flavorful quinoa on the side. (For the record, quinoa is of Latin American origin.)My hopes for the meal really rested on the dessert because that's where French food and I are tight. While the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e came off as better than other San Diego \"French\" attempts I've had (I'm looking at you, Arely French Bakery) given that it had an actual crust on top, I would have preferred a thicker creme to really push the dessert, and thus this review, to the next level.Summary: I guess I'll stick with fries next time I want French food."], ["Ben P.", "Came here today for a lunch date during restaurant week.

YUCK!! \u00a0No mushroom no fresh spinach. So gross that I could only eat half cuz I was hungry n little more cuz I felt bad wasting \u00a0food. Hubby's French toast was like something I can make at home on the stove top. Boring ordinary and not worth the name. I felt so bad for taking him there that I had to apologize.

The place is cozy, the staff is extremely friend and the food is just amazing!"], ["Ray P.", "Came here on the first night of Restaurant Week and it was busy! My partner and I arrived 30 minutes before our reservation so we waited a few minutes. While we were waiting, a lady named MIchelle came over and chatted with us. Not sure if she's the owner but she was very nice and made sure that we were being helped. The restaurant is small!!! There's probably 9-10 tables so it's a good thing we had a reservation. The tables are very close to each other and it actually reminds me of a bistro in Paris. Our server was French too!We ordered a bottle of Bordeaux while looking through the menu. The bread and butter arrived, and it was fresh and warm. For my three courses I ordered the smoked herring with potato salad, duck confit and baked Alaska. My partner had the escargot, rack of lamb and crepe. The smoked herring salad was delicious. The fish was not salty and it complimented well with the salad. One thing I like about the salad was it was not drowning in dressing. Some lemon would've helped freshen it up. My partner's escargots were served out of the shell. They were cooked bourguignonne style and they were delicious! Best way to mop up the butter sauce once the escargots are gone.....the bread!!!!!My duck confit was served with black currant demi glace, braised red cabbage and quinoa. The duck was so tender that it was falling off the bone!!!! The meat was juicy and the demi glace gave the duck a slight sweetness, which complimented well with the tartiness of the cabbage. I would've like a bit more tartiness...maybe a splash of red wine vinegar! I ordered the quinoa because I wanted to focus on the flavor of the duck. My partner's rack of lamb was huge! There were 6-7 pieces of chops and it was served with potato gratin and haricots verts (French green beans). The potato and beans were pretty basic...nothing special or extraordinary. The lamb was crusted with Dijon mustard and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. I like lamb but it can be gamey and this one was not. It was delicious!!!! The crepe was pretty basic but it was a nice ending to the meal! I can't say the same for baked Alaska. It was too sweet!!!! \u00a0At the end of the meal, Michelle asked if we wanted to sign up for their e-mail list. She gave each of us a $10 gift card that we can use next time.

We thought we get a little head start and arrived the night before the big day. Tough mood, long drive, arrived hungry. I had poked around for dinner deals in the area and found a prix fixe at the The French Gourmet, which was only a few miles from the hotel. We bought it and headed over.We were welcomed by Stefan, who is actually a French person. He's also a total character. \u00a0My wife's mood started changing for the better immediately off of his energy. If you've ever tried to speak French in France, you know that they LOVE to correct our pronunciation. We were once told it hurts their ears. Well, Stefan's pronunciation of Swordfish came complete with the W and my wife got to correct him! He was resistant at first, but had to fold.Okay, so great atmosphere, great waiter... what about the food? AWESOME! Our two appetizers were escargot and a salad with warm goat cheese, etc. Both nummy. Many reviews I've read tout the warm French bread, and it is good, but I don't know if it's worth specifically touting.Our main courses were a crispy grilled salmon with a b\u00e9arnaise sauce Stefan said was the best in the world (because the restaurant makes the best hollandaise sauce in the world) and, while it's hard to call it the best b\u00e9arnaise sauce... it is.Our other main was a scallop dish that could have been just as delicious, in fact any dish every made could be more delicious, if it had that b\u00e9arnaise sauce. But seriously, it was also great.We drank a pair of expertly crafted Manhattans and a glass of great wine, the name of which slips me, but which was expertly suggested by..

Restaurant week is here and I have been waiting since the last one to try this spot. I think it has to be one of the best deals you can get the whole of this glorious week. For a mere $20 you get three-courses worthy of $$$The place is small so definitely book a reservation. The ambiance could maybe use a little sprucing to match the quality of the food, and (I'm assuming they were busier than normal) the service seemed to suffer slightly from the crowd. Definitely not bad though and everyone was friendly. On to the food... what a treat. I started with the escargot: super tender, very taste-y. Really though, if you drown anything in that much butter and garlic I'll eat it. My man had the onion soup, he liked it-- all I had was a bite of the melted cheese which can't be done wrong. For entrees I had duck con fit and he had the rack of lamb. Both were outstanding dishes. The braised red cabbage that came with my duck actually out-shined the protein. And the (I don't know what to call it because \"gravy\" sounds pleb) that came with the mashed potatoes reeeally tied the whole dish together. Oh man, did I mention the cabbage? The lamb was also very well-prepared; nice and tender and cooked to the correct temperature. The potatoes au gratin were also perfect and, though at first I thought the person who took our order had forgotten to ask about our sides, I really liked that the sides were paired with the dishes for us. You guys are in charge; I'd have done it wrong. The desserts were creme brulee and nutella crepes. Do I need to go into it? No, obviously they were wonderful. I'm a fan. I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. Points taken because it was way too bright inside.

The French Gourmet is the petit (adorable) seemingly family owned restaurant. We were pleasantly greeted by our funny and kind French waiter and enjoyed the staffs hospitality through a leisurely three course meal. Everything was perfectly cooked and elegantly presented. If I had any complaints, \u00a0it might be the small side of risotto that came with my meal: it wasn't bad but it wasn't as amazing as everything else ... But personally a cheesy risotto tastes less gourmet to me than a creamy wine sauce (just personally) The close proximity might be bothersome to more private people but my husband and I don't mind being friendly with the people at the next table...

Their pastry collection looked very very very delicious!!"], ["Chris C.", "I'm giving them a 5 star average up over all, but in some small cases weren't quite 5 star but more then made up for it in the overall picture.1. The food was phenomenal, my coworkers go to many catered events throughout the year and they said our wedding had fantastic food, juiciest chicken at a buffet they ever had was a common compliment, and the short ribs, to die for.2. The cake was fantastic, we had thought there would be a few more shells on top as we had requested shells instead of a cake topper, but the cake was beautiful and well received.3. The staff was excellent. I had unintentionally dropped some money, a small amount, and I went back to the table and found it tucked into my napkin- trustworthy employees.4. Bar- We had a small setback here with actually trying to give us one small thing extra (premium vodka, we had paid for mid level) but only gave one bottle, so it disappointed some of my guests including my father once the premium 1 bottle was gone. Not a tragedy but would have preferred to not been given the \"gift\", which caused our guests to feel like maybe we cheaped out on the premium, wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't there in the first place- I appreciate the attempt, but it should not be done that way in the future. 5. Setup- We had a challenging set up as it was a rare day of rain in Coronado. Small little things could have been different, but considering the challenges with the weather, bravo. The biggest thing I'd say to remind people having wedding's at the Coronado community center is to ask the caterer setting up to close the blinds for cocktail hour, it made the room opening feel less special that the blinds were open and the cocktail hour guests could watch the setup happening. Not a huge deal, and considering the weather they get a pass, but it would have been a nice touch.6. The staff- mentioned earlier, but will mention again, very friendly, attentive, helpful. Overall very nice job by the entire catering staff. 7. Get Renee- both as the planner for French gourmet, and get her as your Day of coordinator, my only regret is that we didn't find her sooner!8. This probably should have been earlier in my review- but the cocktail hour went fantastic. People loved their Brie raspberry (I think) pastry, the mushroom appetizers, etc, and everything looked nice. We didn't have a lot personally as it was our wedding, but what we did have was great and again we had great reviews.I would say 1000% amazing day, with small little nitpicks. I would recommend a little more structure and earlier in the planning stages, because by the time Renee contacted us it would have been nicer to have a longer lead time for certain plans- not her fault as she was asked to step in late in the game and did a fantastic job. I understand they are busy, but its a wedding and you are spending a lot of money, some more face to face structured meetings earlier would do wonders for comfort and communication on both ends. Thank you Michel and Renee for making our day very special. We won't hesitate to contact you again in the future and recommend you to our friends and family."], ["Christina G.", "I've been coming in here in the mornings to get coffee because it's cheap and right behind my boyfriends house.

In the back they have their restraunt section. I've taken a look at their menu and they have some pretty extravagant items on there and I would love to try it out.

I was surprised when we got complimentary bread and olive oil and vinegar. I asked for more bread to soak up the escargot sauce and they brought it for me. Being french, I love french food so the escargot and onion soup were amazing. My boyfriend and I got the New Zealand grass fed steak with potatoes au gratin and green beans. He ate his plate in less than 5 minutes it was that good. They give you large portions and it was cooked to perfection.

It was nice, but I'd like more spice.When the French gourmet catered a dinner at a church holiday party that I attended with my mother-in-law, I was impressed at how hot and tasty the food was.

Unfortunately, my expectations were not met and the restaurant was just okay for me. I had to make a reservation to get a table and luckily I snagged one a few hours before! First impression: when you first walk in, it kinda looks like a bakery because they have a lot of pastries/cakes sitting in cases. As I walked in further, I saw the restaurant side and it was really tiny... maybe 9 tables max? I went around 6pm and there were only 2 other groups there.Between my friend and I, we ordered:Complimentary Bread: it was warm and so tasty! I think it might have just been because I was really hungry but we devoured the whole baguette.ESCARGOTS: This was my first experience with escargot and I was not disappointed! If you haven't tried it, it kinda reminded me of the texture of clams but with an earthy flavor. The escargots were drowned in butter and garlic which wasn't overwhelming at all!MUSCLES: They tasted like muscles... the flavor was good, but I found that it pretty much just tasted like typical muscles, but with a mild garlic kick.BEEF CHEEKS: The beef cheeks were cooked extremely well and was perfectly tender. The portion was rather small but the tenderness made up for it. The sauce was okay... but I felt like it didn't have enough salt. BEEF WELLINGTON: I was looking forward to this dish the most because I haven't tried this before (and saw it on Hell's Kitchen all the time). I know it's really difficult to prepare, but my beef was TOO well-done to the extent that it was really chewy. The puff pastry was baked well but the meat was difficult to consume. In addition, the sauce was the same as the beef cheeks and so this dish was also not flavorful enough.RISOTTO (side): the risotto was really good! It was drier than ones I've had before and I couldn't really distinguish what was in it.... but I'd recommend it!NAPOLEON: This was a bit too sweet for me but it was tasty! The custard was smooth and creamy but I found that the sweetness was overpowering.BAKED ALASKA: I loved this dessert! The cake was orange-infused and enclosed the vanilla ice cream. I guess you could say it was like eating a semi-melted ice cream cake. It wasn't too sweet which was a plus for me.TL;DR:Food: 3/5 - Recommend escargots, beef cheeks, and baked Alaska.  \u00a0 \u00a0I had really high expectations but the food was just okay overall.Price: $$"], ["noelle r.", "My office LITERALLY shares walls with this french-tastic biz.

The escargots weren't cooked in their shells, which made it a little tough. I also thought that the escargots were a bit too salty. My boyfriend's salad appetizer was pretty good though. The entrees were okay, but pretty forgettable. The desserts were a bit on the sweet side. My boyfriend was satisfied, but maybe because I'm a food snob I thought the French Gourmet was okay :/ Not as good as some of the other Yelpers mentioned though. However, the service and the people working there were really nice, so that's always a plus!"], ["Sara T.", "This review is for the pastries and brunch. I come here often, pastries are the best ones around, the service at the counter is fast and attentive. Coffee is average, but I don't care since pastries are so good and I usually get my coffee somewhere else.Brunch is really pleasant too, eggs benedict are perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce is awesome. The service is kind and discrete (like: they don't bother you asking twenty times if you like your food, but they are ready to fill up your drinks). The guy who oversees the waiters during the day is really kind, he remembers us and what we like. Also, they are ready to modify the dishes to meet your taste.We used it to cater the food for out wedding party and we were not disappointed. Our guests loved the food as well.Honestly, I think the French Gourmet is one of the reasons why I like living in North PB!"], ["Courtney K.", "Tried this place for Restaurant Week during lunch. The service was spot on and very quick! The waiter was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is adjoined with a little bakery. Although the service was great, the entrees were average. I had the duck confit which was pretty good and flavorful. I also tried the steak and that was good too. Then I had the creme brulee which was mediocre at best. Overall, this place is good, but there are better places to have French food."], ["Anthony And Regina Manzon M.", "I hired the French Gourmet for my wedding cake. The cake was absolutely DELICIOUS!! We ordered the strawberry bagatelle with buttercream frosting. Everyone LOVED the cake and so many people kept asking us where we got it. Additionally, working with Trang, the wedding cake coordinator, was an absolute pleasure! I had a couple concerns including budgeting and having the cake pre-cut.. she ALWAYS accommodating to my needs and helped find solutions! I have already and will continue to recommend The French Gourmet for their wedding cakes! I guarantee you will not be disappointed!! Thank you The French Gourmet & Trang for a delicious wedding cake :)"], ["Jeanette D.", "This is a long overdue review for our wedding catering by French Gourmet. Orsika was amazing and very helpful not only in working with us to create the right menu and working with our budget but also talking me off the ledge when I was freaking out about how over budget we were and offering me different ideas. The food was delicious, and we got a lot of compliments on the wedding cake (which we didn't have any left at the end of the night). We had great service as well (except for one waiter). \u00a0The staff also made sure the bride (me!) got lots of snacks during the day which I really appreciated.FG also gives you a free cake on your first anniversary when they cater your wedding. The only thing I didn't like was the hot water for the tea station had a coffee taste to it. I would recommend not using the same equipment to hold water that's used for storing coffee - the coffee taste never really goes away. It's really my only (minor) complaint. Otherwise, pretty perfect all around.I would have FG cater an event again and recommend them without hesitation."], ["Jennifer N.", "You know those places you'd never guess did brunch? This was one of them for me but I'm so glad I got the opportunity to go! I went for Easter brunch and was not let down. I'd already had breakfast, so I got the scallops and they were REALLY delicious!! There were 6 I think of the very larger size with a tomato sauce that was very different than I've ever had along with veggies and potatoes. It was a perfect sized meal for lunch and came with a side salad as well. We had a bottle of champagne for the table of 5 we had and it lasted a full glass for each and a couple top offs and they brought out separate containers for the juice so we could add it ourselves :)Overall very lovely people, good service and delicious food!!"], ["Bonnie S.", "Thank you French Gourmet! \u00a0I had a party for 20 of my girlfriends yesterday. \u00a0I ordered four quiches, the italian skewers, melon balls with prosciutto and the assorted desert platter.

It is a small establishment on Garnet in PB. There is a small parking lot next to the restaurant/bakery, which has 5-6 parking spots. Ample street parking. When you walk in, there is a wide selection of pastries. From croissant to macaroons, from eclairs and madeleines to birthday cakes. Took a while to be seated because the server was really busy.It was a bit short staffed the day I went (Thursday), but service was wonderful. For appetizer, I ordered the green lip mussels even though the escargot smelled very buttery and garlicky. Each order comes with half a dozen of mussels and they were big, fat and juicy! As for entree, I had the macadamia crusted mahi mahi with rissotto. Loved it! The fish was cooked perfectly at the right temperature! The macadamia complemented the fish very well, adding a slight hint of crunchiness to the tenderness. The sauce was delicious as well. Finally, I had the baked Alaska for dessert - sponge cake with ice cream and chocolate chunks. It was close to perfect. Reservation is highly recommended! I would come again :D"], ["TianChee S.", "Came here for Restaurant week and I enjoyed my food experience here.The people running this restaurant seem to be of French descent so they should know how to cook French cuisine. Waiter/Manager was very attentive and wanted to ensure we were having a good food experience so I really appreciated that. Seating is very limited and they only allowed reservation only during restaurant week which is very much understanding because they mentioned that it was fully booked for the night with over 120 people expected. Someone tried to seat themselves and was asked to leave because they didn't have a reservation and the customer started to speak French to try and get some favor from the staff but it still didn't fly. There was some awkward moments during this time but they handled it and were finally able to get them to leave.Tip to know here for restaurant week: if asked nicely, maybe if you don't have a sweet tooth; you can ask if you can get two appetizers instead of getting a dessertFrench bread was fresh and very good.Items ordered:Appetizers:Escargot - well cooked; not overly buttered so we could still taste the Escargot; would recommend ordering thisFrog legs - it was decent but like many items if it's not fresh/frozen; you can taste the difference. It was overly seasoned to my liking and may have second thoughts about whether to order this again. Can't really blame them for freshness of frogs since it's not high in abundance hereMain:Maine Lobster - this was pretty decent; decent portion about 1lb; seemed to be fresh since it was served as a whole and not just the lobster tail. Wished I had more green liver (Tomalley) as I love that stuff but guess it depends on the season and whether it's a male or female lobsterDuck Confit/Breast - this was cooked very well and was pleasantly surprised; I would recommend ordering this dish as they did justice to it (refer to my picture). Not dry and very juicy and full of flavorDesserts:Creme Brulee - nothing too spectacular about it; standardBaked Alaska - nothing too spectacaular about it; standard; I was hoping to have it served with flames on it but it's okayOverall, customer service and food was pretty good and would not mind coming here again."], ["Carmen V.", "I stopped going to The French Gourmet restaurant a while ago because I wasn't that happy with the quality, but I have to say that I am glad my company uses them for corporate events, as the food tend to be very nicely done, there is always good variety and you can see the freshness of the salads (for example) right in front of your eyes. So my review is mostly for the catering services.The staff they hire for those events are very professional and generous in the portions they offer. Meat is well done and cut in front of you, so you know what you are getting. The mahi mahi with mago dressing is very good and the couscous too. Roasted veggies cooked well, but come to the customers a bit cold I would say.About the bakery side, it is very inconsistent, that is why I give only 3 stars.

The desserts are usually $4.25 each, which I think is very reasonable and less expensive than other places. Our favorites are the strawberry bagatelle, red velvet cake, chocolate mousse cake, and fruit tart. My husband really enjoys the chocolate eclairs as well. I wish that they offered creme brulee to go though...we'd get that every single time! In addition to the cakes, they do have cookies, chocolate covered strawberries (call in advance), and awesome croissants along with other breads. I have dined there once for dinner and although the food was good, the service was terribly slow that night. It took a very long time to order, get our food, and our bill. It seemed like we were repeatedly ignored as others around us were getting proper and timely service. So, I'm not sure if it was an off night or what, but I likely won't be back for dinner.

This restaurant is very small and intimate and luckily there is additional parking in the back! We received complimentary amuse bouche to start, which were these cute little pastry puffs dripped with some creamy white sauce. Then we ordered the French onion soup for him and mussels for me. The soup was very too cheesy for me, but my boyfriend really liked it. The mussels didn't have enough flavor for me, but it was still good. Our server gave us extra bread to dip with the sauce. Instead of ordering entrees like we normally do, we decided to get more starters to share- the brie en croute and steak tartare! The brie was wrapped in a light pastry shell and once you cut into it, the cheese oozes out. It was huge for an appetizer and very delicious! I thought that the steak tartare was just okay though.We were full, but left enough room to try the flourless chocolate ganache cake for dessert with some muscat to pair it with. The cake was nice- very moist and not too sweet. For being a French restaurant, the prices of the entrees are very reasonable. They also have a 3 course prix fixe menu on Sunday nights for $25 you can take advantage of. Also, If you love cheese, I noticed a daily cheese menu towards the bar you can check out. I had a nice time here and our server was friendly and professional. Next time, I want to try their signature dish, the coq au vin!"], ["Amy T.", "My favorite thing about this place is the service.

Too much cheese and the onions were bitter from being overcooked/burnt.Baked Brie-Good, not great.Cheese plate- I was mostly disappointed by this part of our meal. All the cheeses were great and good portions but there are is no meat selection and nothing savory on the board. No nuts or anything. Just dried fruit and strawberries. Scallops with Apple Fennel Slaw and fried Coconut Yam cake-This was the best part. Scallops were just slightly overcooked but the slaw and cake were nice. Great flavors.

I do recommend the Prosecco, not too sweet and very refreshing.Grady brought out an amuse bouche of a mini-Wellington in a lemon butter sauce...the puff pastry at Cafe Bleu is some of the best I have ever had...more about that later.We ordered the Brie en Croute($8.95) for her and the small Canapes($12.95) for me, but of course, shared. \u00a0The Canapes change often, and this selection was from the top, Small Meatballs, light but flavorful, Shrimp with a spicy remoulade over a sauted slice of zucchini, and goat cheese mixed with red pepper on a slice of french bread. \u00a0I loved the meatballs, and the flavor/texture of the red pepper goat cheese, but found the shrimp VERY fishy tasting and the zucchini a bit slimy....even so, would order again. \u00a0Had a glass of Rose for this course($8.50).The Brie was the BEST I have ever had. \u00a0Perfect, light puff pastry over the creamiest, butteriest Brie ever, lightly seasoned with Balsamic reduction and a mixture of dried and braised fruits(fig, dates, mango, apricot....) Absolutely delicious, and if served with a green salad on the side, a very filling meal.For entree, we had salmon filet with red bell pepper polenta($18.95) for her, and the \"Surf and Turf\"($28.95) for me. \u00a0It came plated with two sauces, with mashed potatoes on top, served with a scallop, a couple shrimp, and a filet, cooked to order, as well as perfectly seasoned baby green beans(haricots vert).The filet was a bit gamey, although cooked perfectly. \u00a0The fishy shrimp flavor showed up again. \u00a0Am very particular about shrimp, and for some reason, these were just not awesome. \u00a0The texture was perfect, but maybe the supplier didn't provide top quality product? \u00a0Not sure, but would be careful about asking when we return. \u00a0The scallop was seared perfectly. \u00a0Grady recommended the Cotes du Rhone($11.00) and it was dead on wonderful. \u00a0Dry and big, but complementing the flavors perfectly.We finished with the Creme Brulee($5.95) and is was a beautiful end to an almost perfect meal. \u00a0Light, creamy and not-too-sweet.This is a small and romantic restaurant for dinner IF....other patrons are considerate and don't bring small children/babies or try to cram in large groups....there are plenty of places where that makes sense and is easily accomodated, but this is not one of them. We loved Cafe Bleu, and with the exception of the shrimp, have little to complain about. \u00a0Will be back, and soon!"], ["Jaylene R.", "Nothing but good things to say about Cafe Bleu! I'm new to the French scene and this place made French cuisine a new necessity for me. Came in around 6:30p on a Tuesday night and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Our server sat us and started us off with some water and a mini beef Wellington, compliments of the chef. It was a small bite's worth of beef tenderloin wrapped in a flaky puff pastry and a creamy sauce to accompany it. He also offered us bread but I sadly declined due to the influx of carbs I've been eating as of lately. They have a full bar and only a handful of beers on draft, but definitely a handful of good draft beers. To start, we had the French onion soup to share and it was literally the best French onion soup I've had. It has chunks of bread, onions, peppercorn kernels and of course, a soup cover's worth of cheese on top. I highly recommend you try this soup!!Entrees:+Salmon filetThe honey and Dijon crust gave such a beautiful crispy glaze to the salmon that had to be my favorite part of the dish. The salmon was topped with a tomato salsa which went well with the fish. It was accompanied with red pepper polenta (good for the first few bites but after awhile I got tired of it) and green beans.+Surf and turfThe Filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the shrimp were indeed jumbo and juicy. It also came with one scallop and garlic mashed potatoes, and let's be honest, you can never go wrong with a side of garlic mash.We were celebrating a birthday and received a complimentary flourless chocolate cake! I was bummed that it didn't come with a scoop of ice cream as it's usually paired with, but it's definitely one of the better flourless chocolate cakes I've had. It had such a different texture than what I'm used to and I enjoyed the uniqueness of it. It wasn't too chocolatey even with the chocolate sauce it was drenched in. The service was spectacular and I'm extremely pleased (and stuffed!) Cafe Bleu is such a comfy and cozy little spot and I can't wait to come back for more French onion soup."], ["Denise T.", "I'm normally not a fan of French cuisine, but this place really changed my mind. I've converted! The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is due to their slow service. It was slow when I needed a new napkin, it was slow when we wanted the check, and it was slow again when we waited for our credit card to be returned. It wasn't even a packed night. But the food more than made up for the service. Here's what we ordered: Appetizer:Warm crab dip gratinee (5/5) - perfect app to share! The dip was warm, rich, and inviting. Entree:Crevettes Parsienne: Shrimp, gnocchi, sauteed spinach, & a creamy pesto sauce (5/5) - absolutely spectacular. My only qualm was I wished there was more. Much more.Almond Crusted Jumbo Scallops with a coconut risotto cake & a squash and onion relish (3/5) - the coconut risotto didn't add anything to the dish. It wasn't very tasty.

Great way to start the meal. Mussels - saut\u00e9ed in white wine, butter, garlic, shallots, red chili flakes, tomatoes, and herbs. Very very good.Steak Frites - grilled hanger steak with shoe string fries. Super delicious and quite simple. The hanger steak was so tender and juicy. What a great cut of meat.

Reasons for choosing the restaurant was because of half priced bottles of wine on Monday's, a large happy hour selection including a 3 cheese plate, and it was some place different and new for the both of us. First thing first is their web site menu's are outdated as prices have increased. The yelp menu prices look pretty accurate so I would look through that.Parking was easy to find in the back of the restaurant at 5:25pm. There were plenty of spots available in it's shared parking lot. My wife and I started with the happy hour menu as we ordered the Olives, Almonds & Dates and the 3 cheese plate. The restaurant has a daily selection of 10 cheeses to choose from. My wife loved the cheeses and all the fixin's that came with it.For entrees I ordered the bleu burger and my wife decided on the Coq Au Vin. I really liked the shoestring fries that came with my burger. They were heavily seasoned which is something that I prefer. The burger for me was OK, I am not that fond of blue cheese to begin with but felt like a burger. My wife also enjoyed her dish. Service was a bit on the slow side, I could have used more water refills since I drink a ton and one of the servers never brought me ketchup after I asked for some. Fries were good though so it was not essential for me.

We found street parking in front, which was lucky for us. I liked the open windows that this place had, but small restaurant. Everyone started off with bottomless mimosas ($8), which is a deal. They were always refilling our drinks, so yay for that. They also offered bread with butter and jelly to start, which is good but I wish they brought it before we ordered. Anyways, I ordered the Croque Madame ($13) with half fries and half salad. I definitely enjoyed both sides very much while I didn't get around to my croque madame.

Amuse bouche - beef tenderloin in a puff pastry w/ a creamy mustard sauce. Tender and very good. St. Andrews cheese (cow) - nice amount of accompaniments... Mild and creamy, paired well with everything. The boyfriend finally got to try his real honeycomb, so that was an added bonus!Bread with butter and bruschetta (complimentary) - PERFECT. My favorite part of the meal!Crab dip - fresh, light, and flavorful. Would have preferred it to be a bit creamier and cheesier but that's just me. French onion soup - So cheesy! The kind of cheese that sits in your mouth and demands to be chewed... And chewed... And chewed. Very good and rich but could have stood for a little less cheese and a little more flavor. Baked brie - great way to end the meal (yes all cheese errday). Perfectly crisp pastry, unique wine reduction, and luxuriously melty brie. The dried fruit didn't add much in the way of flavor, but the varied texture was nice. All in all, nice change of pace. We felt spoiled and fancy and didn't leave feeling broke ($48 before tip).

The other reviews were pretty accurate, as we had exceptional food, the Prix Fixe menu was perfect and affordable, just the right amount of choices and everything was lovely, the steak frites was cooked to perfection, tender, and flavorful. The atmosphere was casual which we like but the wait staff was a bit unpolished and so was the maitre'd as she talked and laughed loudly with other guests during our whole meal and ruined the ambiance.The 3-6pm happy hour made the wine a good value and the wine list was ample. We also loved the french onion soup and the chocolate ganache cake was quite good. We would definitely return for another experience since the food was very delicious and nicely presented."], ["Tam W.", "So good! Everything is absolutely amazing and seasoned so well! My neighborhood go to. Came here on Sunday for their prixe fixe menu and had wonderful service. Knowledgeable, friendly and humorous.

Always made a mental note to try it & tonight on a rare Friday date night, I let Open Table throw out suggestions.Voila! Cafe Bleu it was! Started with the small order of canap\u00e9s. I'm a girl who could just eat appetizers as my meal and be incredibly happy. These were AMAZING & I'll be back for an appetizer meal soon. My entree was the Boeuf Bourguignon. It was braised just right and I really appreciated that the carrots weren't mush, like so many other places tend to do. Love that slice of crisped pork belly they added for the added texture & flavor. My only regret is in hindsight I wish I would've asked for some of their yummy baguette so I didn't waste any of the sauce. Another time! Hubby ordered their fish special the Halibut. Let me just say, we recently went to a well known seafood restaurant downtown & they destroyed the fish--so sometimes we are hesitant. But it sounded so good that we had to get it and there were no regrets. Seared with that nice crisp on the outside and inside flakey yet really moist. Roasted or grilled tomatoes with mashed veggies & potatoes--a bit of it all together to make a mouth watering bite. Our server/bartender Javier, turned out to be the owner. This man obviously takes pride in his restaurant and it showed in every aspect. All of the servers were friendly & helpful, they were on point with every bit of the service from beginning to end.We didn't save room for dessert--so next time it's on. We shared it all & we'll be back to share it again--soon."], ["Elaine A.", "Stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp. Indeed, the reviews are true! Food is really phenomenal and the service is outstanding. The place is intimate and dim. Perfect for date nights or quiet evenings.We were early with our reservation but they ushered us right away to our seats. The server was very knowledgeable and patient when he told us about the specials. My brother even seek his help when deciding on what cheeses to pick for our cheese plate. Then we ordered the chef's canapes which were small bites of hors d'oeuvres. Each of them was tasty but I especially enjoyed the salmon croquette. Creamy but not too rich and didn't taste fishy at all. For the main course, I ordered the barramundi chef special. It was a good sized meal. My brother got the surf and turf. The fillet mignon was cooked to perfection. The best melt-in-your-mouth steak that we've tasted, the demi glaze complimented it very well too.Wine. Oh you can get them in half glass which was awesome because I want the taste of it while I eat but I don't really want to drink too much. All in all it was a pleasant eating experience. I won't hesitate to come back!"], ["Cindy Y.", "Cafe Bleu, what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing. The finely-lit romantic ambiance, the amazing prices, the breathtaking food, the extremely personal waiters... it all captures your heart one your very first visit. There is a decent selection on the menu, all for very reasonable prices. I came here before, but I ordered the special (swordfish). It was super delicious and made me happy. But the most recent time I went, it just blew me away (well, the salmon did). We came pretty late, but they still took us in (THANK YOU). For $15.95, the salmon was pan-roasted atlantic salmon, sauteed hericot vert, creamy wild mushroom polenta, roastd red peppers and leek beurre blanc. WOW. The wild mushroom polenta was simply amazing--creamy with a slight hint of the roasted peppers and it was phenomenal. The salmon broke off right as your fork dug into it; super succulent, juicy, and delicious. I would definitely recommend this dish to anyone who does not know what to get.Also tried the bouillabaisse for $16.95, which was made of poached fresh fish, jumbo shrimp, jump scallop, carlsbad black mussels, roasted tomato, julienne-cut vegetables, all with saffron-fennel broth on the side. A+ for presentation! They brought out the plate with a teacup filled with the broth, and poured it in the spot. Definitely gave a lot of seafood in this, but I felt the broth was just okay in comparison to the salmon. I will continue to crave the salmon and dream of this place. Great job, Cafe Bleu."], ["Rosie V.", "Wow! I love this place is just amazing! Best food I had in a while and customer service was awesome.

The service was phenomenal the entire time we were there (made me really think hard about giving 2 stars, even though near-death experiences were had). We were sat right away and quickly served our first mimosas (again - GREAT service). I ordered the croque madame, and the hubs ordered some sort of omelette (like I said, things got hazy quick).The food was ok (the madame had a LOT of cheese, but really- isn't that the whole point?!). But about 2 mimosas in, I was feeling NO BUENO.Without getting graphic on y'all - things got ugly. .... Real ugly.Would I go back? Nope.

We came on a Friday evening around 6:30pm. They do not take reservations, but we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of 2. The atmosphere is very romantic; small, intimate dining area and beautifully decorated interior. Most tables were couples on date night. The seating area is very small so this is probably not a good place for groups.The first thing I noticed after sitting down was the noise. The interior is decorated with stone, so the sounds of everyone talking just bounces off the stone walls and amplifies all the noises. It is nearly impossible to talk and you must raise your voice to talk to anyone sitting just next to you. The acoustics of the inside took away from an otherwise delightful atmosphere.My first disappointment was no bread at the table to get us started. BO-beau kitchen fancies itself as a restaurant in the south of France, however, restaurants in France always serve bread to start off the meal. And at $20-$30 a plate, why can't they give us some nice crusty warm bread to munch on?I ordered the short rib pappardelle. The short ribs were cooked well, but the sauce was bland and did not add any flavor to the dish, and the pasta tasted boxed. At this price point I would have liked to see freshly made pasta. My husband had the lobster risotto, which was flavorful and well cooked.The food was nothing special to me, and the loud acoustics of the interior will ultimately send me looking for another restaurant for our next date night."], ["Brandon K.", "Fantastic meal hidden in OB. \u00a0I got to try a lot of their items when I came here a couple weeks back.

I do wish they were a bit crispier but its minor. Overall, they were very tasty and it was a large portion for an appetizer. \u00a0For the main course, I split the burger (with no egg) and the lobster bisc with mussels. Both were great and large portions. \u00a0You definitely don't need the meal size of mussels because they already provide you with bread to dip into the soup but the fries were quite tasty.Throughout the whole meal, our server was attentive and made sure we had all of our food. \u00a0I would love to come back and try some other items here."], ["Lina P.", "Came on a Saturday with a group of 4.

Their burger, the Royale With Cheese, is also incredibly good."], ["Andrew N.", "A nice place to dine. A cute little location packed with fantastic food and flavors. While a bit small, Bo-beau is homey. The fragrance of its cuisine is apparent just outside the restaurant. The warm bread and smoooooth butter was an excellent start. My two favorite dishes were the burger and the pork belly flatbread. I believe it was pork belly but it could have been something else. The burger had an excellent charbroiled smokey flavor with the meat remaining juicy and tender. The fries were also addicting!The flatbread was also delicious. Gooey cheese and flavorful meats! Great texture to the bread as well. Nice and light. I can't give this five stars because while it's almost there, it doesn't quite hold a unique aspect to it. This is similar to the new American restaurants We see in many down towns. Kind of like cucina enoteca and Urbana.

I left impressed, full, and happily tipsy. For appetizers, we had escargot and BO-Beau's famous crispy Brussels sprouts. The escargot was melt-in-your-mouth good -- tender, buttery and mild. There was not even a hint of chewiness, mushiness or saltiness. If you've never tried escargot, this is the perfect place to try it. The Brussels sprouts were magic -- crispy and charred on the outside, tender on the inside. The flavor profile of the dish is complex, with lots of flavors (pancetta, balsamic vinegar, etc) coming together to make a stunning appetizer. For the main course I had the Steak Au Poivre: a peppercorn crusted, sauced sirloin on a bed of hericot verts (green beans) with a side of pommes frites (French fries). The steak was cooked to order (medium rare), and the beef was of fine quality. Lots of flavor! Lots of spice! Quite tender. The vericots verts were delicious, and the fries were divine! Really! You'd think it would be difficult to make a French fry that is heads and shoulders about the rest. After all, it's a simple French fry! But these were fabulous.In short: *loved* the food. Ah! This review would not be complete if I failed to mention the atmosphere and service. BO-Beau is charming, rustic, and very romantic. Totally the kind of place you would take a date, of your spouse on an anniversary. The staff is friendly and attentive, not at all stuffy. I felt welcomed and well served. I highly recommend this place. Just remember you will pay for what you get."], ["Shanon Y.", "So what's the secret in making one of the most distasteful vegetables such as Brussel sprouts into something actually quite delicious? I stumbled upon Bo-beau after doing some research for places to eat around Ocean Beach on my mini getway in SD, and it has now become one of the best restaurants I've tried in SD by far. The dining experience was extremely memorable from the ambiance to the food and the service. Although the wait was long since my date and I waited well over 45 minutes for a seat and unfortunately they don't take reservations. Locals raved about this place as we waited and I'm really glad it lived up to the hype. From their menu we ordered the following:Crispy Brussel Sprouts -pancetta, parmesan, balsamicBraised Short Rib Flat Bread -horseradish smashed potatoes, chivesRoyale With Cheese -8oz house ground patty of filet and ribeye, roasted garlic, gruyere, pork belly, arugula, caramelized onion bun, green peppercorn aioli, pickled red onion, pommes fritesWe were starving by the time we were seated and these three items alone was enough to feed us and we still had enough leftovers for perhaps another meal. Portion sizes are HUGE! I definitely recommend sharing the dishes. The most popular item on their menu is the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and I can honestly say that I usually don't enjoy these veggies on a regular basis but I made an exception to try them and they were surprisingly good. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The Braised Short Rib Flat Bread was also quite interesting. It was pretty much a flat bread with mashed potatoes on top and anything with mashed potatoes is great in my book, although my date loves his traditional cheesy flat breads and was a little underwhelmed by this dish. The Royale was another entree that we enjoyed, it was a really tasty burger that came with a side of thinly cut fries. Although the side of fries was actually a huge bag of fries that could probably feed 4 people. I would definitely recommend this spot for a romantic dinner. The dim lighting and heat lamps outside created a really nice atmosphere for a nice date. The restaurant is quite small so it might be difficult for them to accommodate larger parties. Tip* Wait is very long so come early or expect to wait up to an hour on weekends!"], ["Allison I.", "SERVICE = AMAZING. FOOD = AMAZING. AMBIANCE = ROMANTICALLY AMAZING.1. Brussel sprouts. This is the only place I will eat brussel sprouts! Crispy brussel sprouts, chunks of pancetta, a balsamic reduction/glaze and parmesan shavings. SO BOMB. Seriously. Bo-Beau's is the only place I'll willingly eat this veggie.2. Royale burger with fried egg. The meat is SO juicy and I could tell that every single part of the burger (bread, pickled onions, met, egg, pork belly, etc.) had special work done. The burger is perfectly seasoned. So much flavor all in one bite. This may be one of my favorite burgers in San Diego.3. Steak frites. Steak w/herb butter -- for ~$22 bucks, you get a really juicy steak (w/bits of fat well distributed -- a little fat never hurt nobody!) and rosemary-seasoned fries. They hold up well as leftovers (just had some) -- seriously, SO GOOD.4. Service. We got in and let them know we were on the waitlist (they don't take reservations, but if you call an hour before you arrive, they'll put you on a waitlist which puts you on a priority list). I was complimented on my dress, which was really sweet. As I was checking in to Yelp, one of the receptionists found me (without having called my name) and let us know our table was ready (literally within 5 minutes of getting there on a Friday night at 8pm...impressive). We asked her, \"How did you know it was me?!\" and she said they write down something about you when you first check in (in this case, she wrote down something about my dress) so they can easily identify you. They've got it down to a science, haha.Our waiter was really cool. He let us have our space but was still attentive to our needs. He probably only came to our table 5 times, always asked the right questions, and was very engaging.Love this place. Would definitely recommend for date night.

We called ahead and had a table waiting for us on the heated patio when we arrived. After looking at the menu we decided to start off with a couple of cocktails and some wine. Our waitor was very knowledgable about the wine list and offered some great recommendations. After our drinks we started off with some appetizers. We got the brussel sprouts which were incredible (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), the croque madame which was like a pastry type dish with pachetta, cheese and a fried egg and we also got the lobster bisque mussels. I'm not really a mussels person but the broth was very flavorful and our waitor even brought out some sourdough bread so we could soak it up. For our entrees we split the pistachio crusted salmon dish, the catch of the day (which was a grouper complete with quiona and pumpkin seeds and the seared duck. All the dishes were very different from one another but delicious in their own ways. The catch of the day was definitley my favorite and the table thought so as well. 5 stars for the food, service and ambiance. This place is definitely a great find and I will be back again in order to try some of their other dishes."], ["Wanting H.", "Sometimes there is just no words can describe how the good food is. Bo-beau kitchen is definitely the one. I love their food. Purely amazing! Starting with crispy brussel sprouts, which was perfectly fried and seasoned with pancetta and balsamic sauce. It also adds slightly sweetness to balance out the fried crispy brussel sprouts. This is my favorite brussel sprouts in SD. Next we had their moules and frites. Again, amazingly flavored. We had their moules au citron et fenouil. I love the seasoning and frites was really good too. Lastly, their entrees were very very good. The duck breast was hands-down the best that I have ever had. The duck breast was tender and moist. Furthermore, the cauliflower puree and pomegranate reduction were both excellent with the duck breast. I will try it again when I return for sure.

I finally got a chance to check it out for dinner. First of all, the patio area is the epitome of rustic. I mean, the decor literally has rust on them. Unfortunately, the swarm of flies made it annoying at times to sit out in their otherwise charming patio. We ordered the Malchiodi, Fettuccine, and Pommes Frites. The Malchiodi came with squid ink penne, decent-sized sauteed shrimp, coconut cashew pesto, kalamata olives, roasted tomatoes, and pickled shallots. My friend kept commenting how she could taste some kind of curry in this dish. I had a couple bites and thought it was pretty good. I've never had pasta made from squid ink before; it wasn't as weird as I would have imagined. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the pickled shallots were an interesting addition to the dish. My fettuccine came with duck confit, roasted mushrooms, and arugula--all smothered in a parmesan reduction. This dish was so rich it made Warren Buffet jealous! The duck was pretty tasty, although my friend found it salty. I would have preferred if the pasta wasn't cooked all the way. By the time I got halfway through the plate, it was difficult to keep going due to the heaviness of it all. You know a dish is too rich and heavy when you have to eat some fries to cut that richness--which was precisely what I had to do. If you're going to order this dish, you should probably share it with at least two people and also get a salad. Oh, and you might want to skip dessert. I've already mentioned how handy the Pommes Frites were. These super slim fries were tasty and crisp. The Romesco aioli it was accompanied by was a great sauce for dipping. Overall, I feel as if I just ordered the wrong dish for my tastes. Had I chosen another dish (something not so heavy), I would have probably enjoyed the meal more.

Maybe, maybe not, but since restaurants should be expecting an influx of customers during this period, you'd think they'd be not only prepared, but at the top of their game.My friend and I called ahead about an hour and 15 minutes prior to when we planned to show up so we could add our name to the wait list. (I really don't understand, by the way, what the problem is with taking reservations. Isn't a wait list just a less-convenient-for-the-diner way of doing the same thing?) When we arrived we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Yikes! So much for calling ahead. :(We went over to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. The bar was crowded, but there was one seat left which we snagged. The couple sitting next to us let us know they were on their way out and we could have their seats - score! We decided we'd just dine at the bar, too, and then we watched the bar and the restaurant slowly fill up until we were completely surrounded on all sides. To be fair, the hostess did end up calling our name before 45 minutes were up, but we were settled in at the bar by then.The two bartenders were super busy which ended up meaning that they were pleasant enough, but not particularly attentive (although it was much appreciated when we ordered a bottle of their grenache and were offered a taste first before we committed, a good decision considering it was a ros\u00e9 rather than the red we were expecting).For appetizers we started with the escargot and the corn and crab bisque. The escargot were plump and garlicky and delicious, but I would have preferred them to already be out of the shell so I didn't have to deal with it. The corn and crab bisque was rich and creamy...and also nearly cold. :( We couldn't get a bartender's attention so we sucked it up and dealt with it rather than try to get it heated up.For the main course we had the fettuccine with duck confit, roasted mushrooms, arugula, and parmesan reduction and the Boeuf Bourguignon with baby carrots, pancetta, mushrooms, pearl onions, and fingerling potatoes. Both dishes were good but they didn't blow me away and there was something about the Boeuf Bourguignon that was a little on the too sweet side.We both had the blackberry cobbler with ice cream for dessert. It was yummy (and actually a pretty large portion - we should have just shared one) and was a good note to wrap up on.Bottom line: For $110 for two (including tip), I don't know that I'd deal with the traffic and parking and \"we don't take reservations\" rule to come rushing back anytime soon, but I *am* glad that I'm finally able to mark it off my to-try list."], ["Heidy P.", "This place so closely reminded me of a comfortable afternoon dinner at a friends house.

The first thing to catch your attention in the front of the restaurant are these love locks, a throwback to that bridge in France (and many other parts of the world now) where lovebirds would lock a padlock to a bridge, or in this case a fence, to symbolize their eternal love for one another. Now I saw some combination locks... I guess you can dissolve the love if you know the combo...Don't worry about sitting outdoor. The heaters and the warmth of your company will keep you cozy for the entire night.Crispy Brussel Sprouts (Pancetta, parmesan, and balsamic) - Everyone raves about it so of course we got it and were not disappointed at all. The balsamic really adds another layer to this classic vege appetizer. Goat cheese flat bread (Roasted beets, curry onion jam, crushed red peppers, and jalapenos) - the roasted beets didn't really stand out because of the curry onion jam just stood out so much more. Great plate to share with friends.Moules Marinieres (White wine broth, shallots, garlic, and chopped parsley) - the mussels were delicious but sometimes I can't help but feel like European mussels are way overpriced when Asian dishes sell the same stuff at half the price. Nevertheless, still a juicy and tasty dish.Steak Frites (Choice of ribeye or all natural sirloin, haricot verts, pomme frites. choice of sauce: au poive, herb butter, bleu cheese) - we got the medium rare ribeye to go with our fries. The ribeye was juicy and tender to the center. And the butter just melted all over the meat adding a rich and unforgettable flavor into the whole mix. The frites were great to just nimble on.Little did we know, there was also a \"Cheap Date Night for Two\" deal! For $39, we got 2 fish dish and red wine. What a deal!

It was a long wait which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars but the food was pretty tasty.

It came with three cheeses (costal fog (?), a blue cheese, and Brie), pate, olives, two types of pickles, two mustard spreads, three types of salami, cured ham, and crackers/bread. So delicious! For entrees we got the pistachio crusted salmon and the beef bourguignon. Both are amazing and delicious! The only \u00a0problem I had was that the risotto that came with my salmon was a little too buttery for my taste but I'm not a huge butter person and the risotto was still delicious! We also got the blackberry/ginger cobbler for dessert. It was surprisingly a fairly sizable dessert and it had more than enough to split between two. The bottom of the dessert is a little sense but the flavors are unbelievable. We thought we were stuffed but somehow had room to finish the whole thing!

My corn chowder soup came cold to the table and the half panini was also cold (it was supposed to be at least warm). The ingredients were not glue together.

Would recommend the California chicken wrap with Caesar salad. Fresh, made while you wait, and delicious. Plenty of food to fill you up. The wrap and included side salad run about 8 or 9 bucks. I think that's a great value for what you get. Haven't tried the pastries but they look very good. On my list of To-Do's.Matisse is one of those places that easily flies under the radar; reminds me of the small, generic looking cafes across Europe that surprise you with great gourmet food. Makes sense as the owners are French. Pleasant staff and I can tell they appreciate my business. Definitely recommended for you Downtown office types who want to catch a bite for lunch. For you non-office types there's a bar if that's your thing. Sort of a casual airport style filling station, not a seedy thing at all. Fairly large space with plenty of seating. Quiet and never seems busy.Only downside for me is that they aren't open weekends -- and likely holidays. Despite their proximity to the trains, they cater more to the local downtown professionals.Do yourself a favor and try the place for a bite. They deserve the business.

I may as well have went to McDonalds where we would have been more appreciated. Don't get me wrong - our server was nice. But the way everything was handled along, maybe due to company policy, failed to impress. Not enough to warrant a full description of the food, just mediocre in my books.

The flavor of the bacon helped this dish out, but I really wanted more crunch to my cauliflower...it was a bit over cooked which made the cauliflower to soft for my liking and then not as crispy around the edges. The bonus was this was a full order...so I could not eat it all by myself. 3 starsSecond Course:Short Ribs - yum! This was the best - the highlight of this dinner for sure! The short ribs were so tender and full of flavor. Served over wild rice with some veggies, this was really a filling dish!

Also, since the name of the restaurant implies wine, I was pretty stoked to go.We decided to take an Uber over since we were planning on splitting a bottle of wine. Unfortunately, we decided to go at the last minute and didn't make a reservation, so we walked in right when the last seats had been filled and the wait would be about an hour. The hostess was very accommodating and said that we could sit by the hostess stand and grab a drink while waiting for our seats.As luck would have it, a party of 2 didn't make their reservation, so we were seated within a couple of minutes at the end of a communal table. I thought this was actually very nice because it was much quieter than the rest of the restaurant and the party next to us was extremely polite. The only downside was that there was no live music, but it was nice to get to sit and talk.Our waiter was extremely attentive and made sure the bottle of wine we ordered by the hostess stand was delivered to our table. Even though our bottle of wine and water were at our table, he made sure to come back periodically to ensure our glasses were never empty.Local Charcuterie Board. For $17, I was pretty excited to order this board for an appetizer, but was slightly disappointed at the lack of meat on the board. Although the meat cuts and mustard dips were really good, the bread hurt my mouth and there wasn't a lot of variety or quantity. The pickles were also a weird addition to the board. This is probably one of the worst charcuterie boards I've ever had.Sopa Del Dia. The soup of the day was Tomato Basil Bisque and it was delicious. It tasted so fresh and came with freshly grated parmesan on top, which Cam proceeded to eat up. The texture was perfect and the balance of flavors was spot on between the tomatoes and basil. We were actually contemplating ordering another bowl since the first one disappeared so quickly.Pan Seared Duck Breast. This dish was just okay. The meat was cooked to a medium rare and seasoned well, but it was chewy and not very pleasant to eat. The smashed potato was an under-seasoned slightly smashed red potato. We also meant to ask for a different vegetable, but forgot so Cam ended up eat all of the asparagus, which was difficult to cut into with the knife. The cherry port sauce was really good with the duck, but didn't really go with anything else on the plate. I probably wouldn't get this dish again.Chocolate Dream Cake. This cake was light and fluffy, and not what I was expecting. Cam really liked the cake, but I felt it was a pretty standard chocolate cake and nothing to write home about. The presentation was beautiful though, and the fresh fruit was a nice touch.Overall, 100 Wines was a nice experience, but extremely pricey for what you are getting. The service can also get a little slow if it's a peak hour, but the wait staff is great. I definitely recommend going at least once and getting the Tomato Basil Bisque if it's available."], ["Erica I.", "I went to a birthday party and we were seated in the back at a large table.

The waitress we had was really nice and provided good service. We couldn't decide what to get so we got a couple of different items. We got the cauliflower, brussels sprouts, lamb sliders, mac & cheese and flatbread. The cauliflower was really tasty. It had a nice sauce drizzled on it and it wasn't too sweet. The Brussels sprouts were rather large so it was more than enough to feed a couple of people. The lamb sliders were really tasty and the garlic aioli was a nice touch on them. We got the bakes artichoke flatbread and it was good. The crispy onions was a nice addition to the flatbread. Mac & cheese was ok but nothing special. The hard fried cheese is a nice touch on top.

I love their decor. I would describe it as western meets bougie. There is seating starting from the front patio, to the room where the bar is, to the back room, to the patio where they have a fireplace, table tops, and some covered seating.THE FOOD:I have been to 100 Wines about four (4) times and I have devised two (2) lists. The following list has the food items that in my opinion are worth trying:Appetizers:(1) Melted Brie [hold the nuts] (mixed berry jam, toasted nuts, dried fruit, crostini, $9.00) - tasty. The brie comes with the wax on so its a bit tedious if you don't like to eat the wax but the flavor is there.(2) Duck Confit Poutine (parmesan reduction, crispy pancetta, fresh herbs, choice of sweet potato or regular fries, $13.50) - so good!!(3) Bo Beau Brussels Sprouts (pancetta, parmesan, balsamic port reduction, $10.00) - the BEST Brussels Sprouts I have ever had. Sweet and cheesy taste. I tried them on two (2) different occasions and both times they were fantastic. (I last tried them on 06/27/15***)Entrees:(1) Butternut Squash Freeform Ravioli [hold the pepitas] (baby carrots, baby beets, pepitas, citrus beurre blanc (served al dente), $17.00) - It is a small portion of ravioli served in a dish but it comes on a board with crostini and a strawberry/blackberry salad. (See photo). The ravioli were creamy.(2) Sadly not on the menu anymore but should be: 5 oz Balsamic Glazed Filet on top of a bed of tasty mashed potatoes and green beans. Wow was it amazing and wow am I really sad! :*(The following list has the food items that in my opinion are NOT worth trying:Entrees:(1) Bowties & Bacon Mac N Cheese (3 cheese blend of fontina, gruyere, white cheddar, crispy bacon, panko cheddar breadcrumbs,$14.00) - sounds good but it is sadly gross. The Mac N Cheese put a frown on my face :( It was watery! We should have gotten a refund is how bad it was. (***)(2) Verde Linguini Con Salsiccia (assentis spinach pasta, spicy sausage, garlic cream, roasted cherry tomatoes, pecorino, basil, chicharron dust, $18.00) - lacked flavor. (***)(3) Wine Braised Short Ribs (braised short ribs, fresh corn salsa, spiced rice, quinoa, red wine sauce,$22.50) - first off, no mashed potatoes? That's just wrong. I spoke to the waitress because I was in between getting the scallops entree and this one and she said she would sub the rice for mashed potatoes. I couldn't agree more. When I got my entree the mashed potatoes had NO flavor. It was soooooo disappointing. The short ribs were nice and tender. I did not like the fresh corn salsa. I felt that it did not fit well with the meat. A disappointing entree overall. (***)The following food item I was in the middle with:Cedar River Farms Skirt Steak (crispy rosemary seasoned potatoes + sauteed haricots verts + housemade chimichurri + chicharron dust,$23.50) - I thought it was just okay.THE TIPS:A word of caution: the presentation of the dishes may have changed but this was my experience with the items above that are still listed on their menu.

We were seated on the back patio. \u00a0I love the atmosphere back there. \u00a0There is a french poem on one of the walls. \u00a0One of my friends attempted to translate it for us. \u00a0The back patio is a bit more charming than the front patio, however you miss people watching opportunities that you would get from being seated on University Street. \u00a0Our waitress was really nice and attentive. \u00a0She always made sure we had enough water. \u00a0Really the only other negative besides the chewy ravioli was that there was a faint smell of garbage around 10 pm. \u00a0Maybe it was because we were there late, or perhaps the trash bins are a bit too close to the back patio, but it definitely signaled that it was time for us to go home."], ["Steven T.", "Came here multiple times for dinner & service is always excellent. The wine list is fantastic as well as the food menu. My top three favorite appetizers are the brie brussels sprouts and that the heirloom tomato flatbread. I also love there scallops and risotto. My friend and I also ordered their steak here but not really a big fan of it. The texture, cut, and flavor of their steak is not to our liking. just a suggestion, \u00a0if you're really craving for some steak you are better off ordering it from another restaurant that specializes in steak .

The lamb sliders were a bit gamey. \u00a0The brew bread was rather dense, like a thick pound/corn cake. \u00a0For the price, it was fine, but I think I'll just come back for dinner."], ["Wanting H.", "Another wonderful find in Hillcrest! The restaurant was well decorated. I love the rustic feeling of the place. Very romantic place if you are looking for a romantic dinner. The first plate we had was their famous crispy cauliflower. It is very similar to its counterpart, crispy Brussels sprouts. However, fried cauliflower has a little bit different flavor which was quite interesting. It was a great dish but I will like the cauliflower to be crispier. The second plate was their Spanish chorizo flatbread, which was not bad. The flavor was good but nothing very special to mention. It was pretty normal dish. I was looking for a more surprising flavor but it did not deliver. Last plate was Verde Linguini Con Salsiccia. I typically don't like creamy pasta but it was pretty good. They looked the linguini well, slightly hard in the middle and cooked with great sauce. Overall, I like this place. I will return for more different dishes that they offer."], ["Randy B.", "Yo this is place dope, best service ever. Definitely have to try this place out.

Our server suggested her favorite blend, at $20 per bottle, so we had two. They were happy to cork the unfinished second bottle so we could continue our party at home. We had the pear flatbread and the shortrib pasta, with the brussels as a starter. The food was fresh and hot.

Their roasted cauliflower appetizer is simply delicious - every bite down to the last. Mixed with Parmesan shavings and bits of pork belly thrown in, makes for a perfect app. I had the Walnut crusted yellowtail with vegetable ratatouille and my husband had the sole filet dish. I paired my entree with a glass of Malbec (my fave red) and husband had their Moscow mule (ketel one vodka). All delicious and bursting with flavor! We ended the night with their Chocolate Foreplay - it consists of 3 truffles, 2 chocolate covered biscottis, and a white chocolate confection.

Sad to say neither was great. The Mac & cheese was watery with little to know taste, being the cheese presences was absent. The salad was just what it was cold chopped lettuce.Maybe I'll just have to come there now for only their cocktails ;("], ["Gabby H.", "Lovely restaurant - loved the ambiance and the vibe.

The two stars are for the $1.00 mimosas. The food was OK, nothing spectacular. Biggest disappointment was the service. We walked in and the hostess was very rude. Made it seem like the place was over booked, yet it was not so busy. We sat at the bar and asked to be seated at ta table if one became available. They treated us like we were not welcomed, and even seemed bothered when we saw a table open that we wanted to sit at. Food came out fairly fast but they would take for ever to even acknowledge us. I think the place has potential given that the ambiance is super nice, location is great also.

It can conform to any of your needs: cozy and romantic, fun girls' night out (for some reason there were lots of those on the night that we went), or business casual. The wait staff are also great. Very attentive and gracious.The reason I gave this place only three stars is this: between the four of us at the table, the best of the entrees was my chicken. Who goes out to eat at a nice restaurant and orders chicken? It's something I rarely do, but I did it tonight upon the recommendation of the server. (I have some strict dietary requirements, so a few of the other dishes were ruled out for me -- but not for my friends.) Anyway, the chicken was delicious. As was the polenta underneath it. The ribs, scallops, and catch of the day were just meh. Those are three big name dishes and none of us found them memorable or outstanding. The risotto beneath the scallops was also delicious.As for the appetizers, the brussels sprouts were fabulous, but there wasn't enough bacon in them. That's ok. We still thought they were delish. The cheese plate was good, but lacked imagination. And the charcuterie board was a joke. It had three rows of thinly sausage on it -- each of which had the diameter of a quarter. And that was it. Total disappointment.The wine selection was good, but we didn't think it was outstanding.So, overall, it was good. But nothing memorable."], ["Wendy C.", "I was so excited by the prospect of $1 mimosas, which for me would turn out to be cheaper than any other place's regular bottomless mimosas price. You can mix your bubbly with several different juices, from orange to grapefruit. When JH and I arrived, the hostess told us there was a 10-15 minute wait, but asked if we wanted to hang out at the bar in the meantime. We declined, and stood by; after a few minutes, we noticed that there were plenty of open, unoccupied tables in the front, middle, and back patio. But we waited. Finally, we were seated at one of the tables that had been since the moment we stepped in. Meanwhile, nobody was seated at any of the other open tables, either, unless they were joining an already-present party. This was extremely frustrating, and I simply did not understand it. Minus one star for that, and then minus another for the hostess's dirty look when I asked her how much longer for the wait since we seemed to be the only ones waiting--with plenty of open tables, mind you once again--at the time.And then minus another star for the food that disappointed us. It wasn't horrible, by any means, but the portions were small for the price, and the quality was not as high as we expected for such a well-rated place. JH's pork butt eggs benedict and my croque madame both had good presentation, but the taste was kind of lacking. He said his pork was very dry and the dish just didn't taste good; my open-faced sandwich was creatively presented, but did not taste $12 worth.

The wonderful offerings include $1 mimosas and $8 carafes of champagne with your choice of juices. I already knew that the food was amazing here after going for dinner a couple times, but the bacon wrapped dates (I'm including a photo) absolutely blew my mind. Yea, I know all bacon wrapped things are mind-blowing, but these suckers were over the top good with the powdered sugar and crumbled pistachio. The brunch menu is so perfectly well thought out that it was hard to decide what to get. It is also very decently priced for the amazing quality of food that you get (I say this for both dinner and brunch). I thoroughly enjoyed my croque madame. 100 Wines has forever changed the brunch game. Go check it out. Brunch is until 3pm on Sundays."], ["Togayhan T.", "One of the restaurants I really enjoyed having dinner at. They have an amazing kitchen and service. Highly recommended. Here's a couple of things that needs to be taken care of though;1) Patio is extremely loud (due to acoustics I believe). If you're looking to have a quiet, peaceful dinner, that may not work.2) Air circulation inside is not enough. We couldn't sit inside because it was too smelly."], ["Julianne S.", "As a huge fan of Cohen restaurants, I have to say this one is once again beyond impressive! Tonight my girlfriend and I had a ladies night out, ordering basically everything that we could fit into our stomachs. First off, the cocktails were adorable and very tasty, and we started with the duck poutine. Ummm delicious! As a sauce lover, this zinged all my taste buds in the right way. Next up, bone marrow and crispy cauliflower (and half Brussel sprouts). I personally preferred the Brussel sprouts, but that's mainly based on the fact that I always love Brussel sprouts, so those were quickly devoured. The bone marrow was also very good and had a beautiful plate presentation, but once the Mac n cheese with bacon came out, I knew it was game time. If you love to try Mac n cheese at every gastropub/fine restaurant, this one will make your top 5 list easily. We ended the night with the chocolate dream cake - light and fluffy, which was perfect because we literally ate everything and would not have had room for a rich and dense dessert. Shout out to 100 wines for having a really great staff, food and atmosphere - I'll definitely be back soon and next time and I'll sit on the patio to enjoy that adorable fireplace."], ["Lyndsi W.", "OMG Love this spot!!! \u00a0Stopped in one early evening for some dinner and was pleasantly surprised at how cute and relaxing it was inside.Food- Excellent.

Second for the Apps we also got, the Baked Brie which was excellent. \u00a0I really enjoyed this and it was paired perfectly in flavor to the jam as well as melted so perfectly I couldn't stop eating. The Wine flights were good. \u00a0Some of the wines I enjoyed others not so much but, it was great to have small amounts to compare and really be able to see the difference in the ways the wines taste. \u00a0Sometimes that is hard to pick out without comparison, at least to my palate. \u00a0I myself had the Filet Special for the evening. \u00a0It was great! \u00a0Not priced horribly at all for a filet and cooked perfectly. \u00a0So tender and done so well you could tell this was a great cut of meat to start out with. \u00a0The sides were all very flavorful and unique. \u00a0My boyfriend got the Scallops which were great! \u00a0They were large and cooked perfectly! \u00a0Super fresh and I could tell they were very fresh and probably were not that old from being out of the sea. \u00a0The risotto beneath the scallops was exactly how I always imagined this dish tastes, it was wonderful and perfectly cooked in my mind, for what I know of risotto.Service- excellent. \u00a0Our waitress was awesome she came around just enough to make sure we were taken care of but, not so much it was too much. \u00a0The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was great and she was a pretty and pleasant woman who really added a nice touch to the evening. \u00a0Ambiance- I loved this spot for the ambiance. \u00a0You step off the busy Hillcrest sidewalk and into a dimly lit, cute little rustic restaurant. \u00a0I felt so relaxed and removed from the everyday world in here and it really was exactly what I look for when I'm dining out after a long couple of days at work. \u00a0I felt really pampered here from the minute I walked into the door. \u00a0I work at a spa and it reminded me of some of the most relaxing spas I've worked in over the last decade and a half. \u00a0It just felt like being at a home away from home. \u00a0We were in the corner at a little table and I enjoyed having the little cove area to ourselves. \u00a0Cleanliness- Great, the restaurant was very dimly lit so it would of been hard to see too much dirt but, after the overall wonderful experience I highly doubt there is anything wrong with the level of cleanliness at this place. \u00a0Everything was comfy and clean and looked freshly set up for each guest. \u00a0Price- this is a pricier spot. \u00a0It's the kind of place you go when you want a special dinner for a medium price. \u00a0Most of the dishes are fine dining so you have fine dining prices but, for the quality of food I have paid more for less many times before. \u00a0Go during Happy Hour and you'll find great prices on drinks and snacks and come here when you really need a night to pamper yourself or have a special celebration you want to enjoy. \u00a0It's not every day price point eating but, the 32$ was one of the best I've had in years!Overall, this spot was great, I will be back for dinner, I will be back for Happy Hour and I 100% would recommend this spot for anyone looking for a great fine dining spot with excellent food at a medium price point."], ["Nicole E.", "This place is my absolute favorite restaurant in SD.

The fries were crisp and thin-ish but not too emaciated. The duck confit was appropriately charred and not too salty. The only subpar portion was the gravy; it tasted of a canned variety and was quite unnecessary since the other two components could've and should've stood on their own. Next time I'll ask for the gravy on the side a la ketchup. Doesn't poutine usually come with cheese curds? This one doesn't but you soon forget that you're missing out on decadent globs of cheese because the fries and duck are so amazing. The short ribs with corn salsa and quinoa were satisfying yet unmemorable and the scallops were well done with minimal char. I know, the math then doesn't add up, but those fries and duck were that good. 5 stars."], ["Teresa N.", "Review for their brunch menu only.Ordered the pork osso buco benedict and croque madame plus a couple glasses of pomegranate mimosa.

Croque madame was pretty good too, pretty stand way of many it expect it had just one layer of bread in it. It's good if you don't want to fill yourself up with too much carbs. Again it was topped with really thick and cream savory sauce. Among the two items I liked the osso buco benedict more. You know what's made me happier?

It was good, not too salty. The Duck Poutine Fries were really good and fulfilling. They have many different kinds of wines offered on the menu, hence the name of the place. My second experience I came on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly empty. Maybe because everyone else was partying it up at the bars next door. We sat at the bar to order a few glasses of wine and a cheese platter. The vibe was a little eerie at the time because the two bartenders seemed to be watching our every move or maybe because I was trying to get a good picture at the bar and decor that may have became annoying to them after 10 takes.

The \"best eggs ever\" were far below expectations, and not even a bit spicy, despite the promise of harissa.

I can't wait to be back and try more wines and food items."], ["Francis V.", "I will go straight to the point, exactly the way I like to read a review : this place is below average despite its fancy interior showcase. People who work here take full advantage of people's ignorance about French cooking and display a snobby French style which does not match the reality. Dishes are second-rate, made of cheap ingredients and lack of know-how, service is even worst.Food : Their \"steak-frites\" deserves a \"D\". Meat was chewy and full of nerves, green beans were way undercooked with no seasonning of any kind and with the tip still on, as if they were directly served from the plastic bag they have been taken from. French fries were cold when they arrived but, above all, they were not home-made, as it should be in a French bistrot, and undercooked. My friend's fish was overcooked and chewy.Basically, this restaurant is a fraud because, in spite of the low quality of the food, everything is expensive. This is the exact opposite of a bistrot in France, where you have minimal decoration (bistrots are for proletarian class, not for bohos like here) but where a particular attention is brought to the quality of the ingredients : owners want people to come back. Prices are generally low in this type of place. Service : - In a French bistrot, wine would never been served in cheap refectory glasses, like they do here. They think it's \"chic\", and it also cost less because the volume of the container is smaller than for a regular wine glass, but no restaurant in France would use this type of glass, as it's meant for school cafeteria only. My friends and I joked about that but, actually, there is a reason why French use wine glass with wine. If you don't know it, you probably don't know anything about wine, or your wine is so cheap that you didn't bother to pour it into the correct recipient. - We arrived at 8. The entrees were served at 10. Don't expect to be served before and if you're hungry, that is too bad for you. The waitress was nice but added some items of the check afterwards. She took like forever to make the modifications. And she also brought the wrong dishes : not the fish another friend had ordered, my steack-frites wandering around in the restaurant before traveling back on the table (reason why everything was cold).Conclusion : I really don't know why people are overrating this restaurant. Probably because they don't know French food or are just used to be taken for what they really are : consumers who don't care about what they eat as long as they have a fancy and snobbish environment. Well, if you want to feed restorer's mediocrity or if you are a total ignorant of how you should be treated with the price you pay, go ahead. Now, if you want a better standards and try to please yourself, you'd better to go to another place. American restaurants are generally serving decent meat / fish : why would you eat that in a place that pretends to be French but where the service and the food are so bad ? This is just common sense."], ["Kristi W.", "Our server Ty was great! Attentive and personable. Chipotle humus was good, great flatbread. The Mac n cheese was good as well as the flatbread pizza.

Without even a look over this morning's brunch menu, I ordered a mimosa and the cauliflower; this is gonna be goo-ooo-ood!\"I'm sorry, the cauliflower is only on our dinner menu.\" She kindly explained and oh, how my delusions of grandeur were immediately squashed with such soft spoken words. My excited face turned to a jaw drop as I muddled through my response. \"But, I, uh, well, you, but. Everyone tells me, but, they're delicious, please? Pretty please :-D ?\". \"I'm sorry,\" she replied again, \"they're only served with dinner.\"Deflated and disappointed, I asked for another minute to review the menu and sure enough, no cauliflower, but I wasn't about to let that stop me. Our server returned to the table to take orders, and a friend asked about what they have on their menu that is vegan friendly, to which I quickly retorted, loud enough for her to hear, \"I believe they have a delicious crispy cauliflower ;-)\", which in reality is neither vegan friendly nor on the menu at the moment, but that didn't stop me from throwing that mental jab. She chuckled and responded with \"I'll see if the kitchen can make an order special for you.\" Round one may have been hers, but in round two I came back for that knock-out punch, and about ten minutes later, those delicious crispy cauliflower covered in parmesan and thick chunks of bacon with a delicious aioli dipping sauce adorn the table in front of me.Ahh, yes, the mimosas, Champagne *is* my favorite wine, and when mixed with oj, you get that bright burst of bubbly breakfast bliss, delish. My main dish was the pork butt benedict, a solid option, but IMHO, I will likely try more of the menu if I visit again, but those cauliflower, aaaahhhh, like heaven in your mouth. :-pWith some convincing, they totally hooked us up with my special request, and for that they are all aces in my book, coupled with a tasty and inexpensive mimosa on a Sunday morning, they just can't be beat!Happy Yelping San Diego!"], ["Ray P.", "The previous times we've been to 100 Wines, the service was impeccable and the food was divine! I have to say that their wine selection is impressive! And the ambience of the restaurant is elegant, rustic and cozy! Perfect for an evening out with your significant other or a group of friends! The Cohn Group always manages to come up with excellent restaurant concepts and 100 Wines is no exception. But I have to give them two stars on this visit. Service was not up to par this time. We came in almost 10 pm (closing time was 11 pm) and the hostess sat us promptly out in their patio as we requested. She was very nice and courteous! But sadly, I can't say the same for our server. We must've waited for 15-20 minutes while she passed by our table and provided service to other tables, particularly this one next to us. She obviously knew these people as she was having a wonderful time conversing with the group. We finally got to order our half cheese board and bottle of wine and I got the sense that our server was upset that's all we ordered. We already had dinner and dessert earlier that evening, but we wanted some wine to end the night. Throughout the night, we were ignored and when the food was finally brought, I had to go inside and ask a busboy for silverware! Our server kept disappearing for long periods of time and when she did show up, she was talking with her friends on the next table. And while she was busy with her friends, she hit one of the chairs and it hit my partner's knee and she didn't even say anything!!!!

It's trying so hard to be an Italian bistro but...yeahhh. They only had one guy working but I guess it wasn't too busy (10 am). The service was fine overall.I got the Mediterranean crepe and it was way too salty. That's coming from someone who puts salt on pretty much EVERYTHING. This had salty olives, salty ham, salty cheese, and salty sun dried tomatoes. It was like eating a block of salt.I guess I would come back and try something else if someone else insisted on coming here."], ["Cindy D.", "This place had a whole lotta charm. Not something you'd expect when walking into a small cafe in a strip mall. From the fun hats hanging up in the back near the kitchen, to the wrought-iron unicycle bar stools, to the enclosed patio, it just had a nice vibe to it. The So-Cal omelet was your standard 3-egg omelet. It wasn't as cheese-eriffic as I would have liked. The potatoes could have used a tad more seasoning/flavor-- nothing a little salt couldn't fix. The bread tasted great with butter. It had a nice, almost sour taste- very good. My boyfriend was the only one at our table who had enough sense to order a crepe at a crepe place, and his stomach was handsomely rewarded for that choice. I was lucky enough to get some bites and was in love! Next time I will definitely get the California crepe. The chipotle sauce made it an absolute delight!The prices were decent- about $11 for an omelet. The portions were perfect- filling, but not a bunch of food left over to bring home and forget about in the fridge."], ["Cydney K.", "They made us feel welcome.

I don't think they like Asian people and/or kids. I have tried three different times to like this place because of the reviews and food. The customer service has been terrible each time ruining our morning. \u00a0In our most recent visit, my family were the only customers in the restaurant. We weren't greeted so friendly. They seemed annoyed that I asked for a high chair for my daughter. They gave me one the was broken with the pegs coming out of the seat so I had her sit on my lap. It took them over 20 minutes to take our order. It took another 30 minutes to get our food. When we got our food, my son's eggs were cold. They weren't good about refills either. It was my family and just one other guy eating there. \u00a0They like to ignore their customers. In the visit prior to this one, we had another family come with us on a Monday holiday. \u00a0It took over an hour to get our food. \u00a0How do you not plan to have more staff on a long holiday weekend? \u00a0At least that time they gave us a couple of pastries and apologized.

The decor is rustic French bar, and all the thoughtfully placed touches like the unicycle bar stools, old fashioned coffee grinders, guitars, etc. make you feel very welcome.The food was very tasty, fresh, and well presented.

The curb appeal doesn't do much for this place, but the food is AMAZING!Hearty portions and all fresh ingredients, a true party in your mouth! I chose the California Crepe (savory crepe w/bacon, tomato, mozzarella, avocado & spicy chipotle sauce. It sounded amazing and for being a crepe my tummy was full when I was all done. The crepe portion was cooked to perfection and I could eat it all with just a fork.My hubby chose the Black Forest Ham Scramble w/andouille sausage diced and mixed in. His jaw dropped when he saw the large portion size and the noises coming from him with each bite indicated he loved it. I stole a few bites and conquer, the entire scramble was delish.We'd definitley come back.

For dinner: That savory flavor of a salmon crepe with a glass of prossecco with lemon sorbet was delectable. We then shared a sweet treat; strawberry & banana Nutella crepe.

The best crepes I've ever had are Bibby's crepes at UCSD's farmer market and these don't measure up at all. My boyfriend ordered the Jambon & fromage and I ordered the chicken florentine crepe. We also ordered a banana and strawberry nutella crepe. In addition, I had a mocha. The crepe itself was too thick and dense. It didn't seem fresh because it wasn't crispy at all; it was just soft. The chicken in my crepe wasn't super appetizing; it tasted pretty bland. The Bechamel sauce on my crepe wasn't really too my liking either. It didn't taste that great. My favorite part of the chicken florentine crepe was the spinach which is pretty bad since they just tossed fresh spinach on the crepe. I didn't taste the Jambon & fromage crepe. My boyfriend ate it, but just thought it was average. I was hoping that at least the desert crepes are good here, but again I was disappointed. The banana, strawberry, nutella crepe is WAY TOO SWEET. It's so sweet that all the chocolate made a couple of my teeth hurt. The crepe had way too much chocolate/nutella/whip on it. The only thing I enjoyed at Bino's was my mocha. It tasted more like a mexican mocha and it was pretty good. It seemed to have some cinnamon or spice in it. Asides from the food, the atmosphere is cozy and cottage like here. The prices are in the 10 dollar-ish range. The service isn't that great here. Service is a little slow. It took a while to get our food and there was only one waitress during dinner time when we went, so service was just okay. Overall, I won't be back. The food here is really unimpressive to me and there are so many better tasty food options in Hillcrest."], ["Nadya M.", "Amazing place and food! Great atmosphere and staff.

We ordered those, plus a Mexicain crepe and a Croque Madame. The Croque Madame was very rich. My egg was very slightly underdone, but it wasn't a deal breaker. The other crepe was very flavorful. The cumin spice was very noticeable, but the sour cream balanced it out. The pommes frites were perfect and we really liked the chipotle sauce.All of the food came out hot, and was very nicely presented. My husband asked if they served Mexican Coke and was told no. Lo and behold, the coke they served was indeed Mexican coke. The service was polite and timely. We were the only customers, but even so, its nice when the waiter isn't either in your lap or MIA for hours because the restaurant is slow.

No matter the circumstances, Bino & his restaurant are fantastic!Visit #1: I went with a girlfriend for dinner. I got the smoked salmon (lox) as my meal and she got the mushroom, vegetable & cheese crepe. Everything was incredibly divine. My companion loves dessert and got the basic dessert crepe - powdered sugar, honey and jam. Bino - the owner - was chatty and sweet. When he found out it was our first time, he presented us with a bill in which he'd taken the dessert off and given us a discount. A truly genuine & nice man!Visit #2: I went with 5 girls for a birthday brunch on a Sunday. Many spots in Hillcrest are out the door with lines, but this spot is so tucked away that though it was a bit bustling, it wasn't too crowded. (For that big a group we did make reservations though.) We all got something very different off the menu - everyone really loved the birthday girl's brie, apple & cinnamon crepe and the egg scrambled crepes. I told them it was my friend's birthday and, free of charge, they brought out at a humungous plate of crepe with ice cream, strawberries and sauce. Visit #3: I went with 2 ladies for an early dinner. Bino asked if we'd been there before and how much of the food we'd tried. Because one was a newcomer and we hadn't tried much in the way of appetizers, Bino brought out a plate completely free of charge...just so we could have a taste and experience it.

The girl, the pop, and the mom. There's the cook in the back... We got here first then 3 other tables, but they were serve first then us, got water first, and left first then us. It was because we sat near the door and not near their serving station. We didn't get our waters for like 30 minutes, we even ordered and asked for water. My BF didn't get his orange juice until the food came out (we had to remind the server many many times) The table next to us didn't get their coffee until they finished their meals and was ready for the check. I would say service was like a 2. Again...probably cause it was a mom and pop shop... Food on the other hand was good. Wasn't anything extraordinary that I haven't tried yet... but still good. I got the smoked salmon scramble with spinach on a crepe. The salmon portion was great, and the crepe was good. The hot chipotle sauce definitely gave it a good kick. The crepe was nice and thick and tasted very homemade. We also ordered the dessert crepe and it was pretty good too. Place could use improvement. Outdoor seating was nice, lots of flies. Service could use some help. Overall, I do really like this place, I wish they had more servers for the demand.

We made a reservation on a Sunday night, but little did we know, that we would be only one of two patrons. It was sweltering inside, so we decided to request a table outside to at least enjoy the breeze on a very warm night.I have been to this place a couple of times and have always ordered the salmon and scallops and been wow'ed each time. However, I was not as impressed by the items we ordered this time around.My boyfriend and I were not too hungry so we decided to split the scallop appetizer and the sea bass.The scallop appetizer may have been one of the most disappointing appetizers I have ever had. The scallops were not even cooked and were sliced very haphazardly. They also provided some citrus and sauce with them, but the flavors did not match very well.The sea bass on the other hand was pretty good, but even so, not nearly as delicious as the salmon entree.We finished the meal with a chocolate mousse that was, by far, the best thing we ate all night as it was light, but rich in flavor and was a nice refreshing finish to an otherwise lackluster meal.Overall, this place has potential to be a cute date spot, but the quality of food and the awkwardness of the wait staff definitely limits the upside on this place.

I told the waiter and she scooped my steak on a plate to take it to the back.. to microwave it. Why would you microwave a steak? She returned later with my steak now nice and warm but.. medium cooked. Another waiter came and asked me if my steak is ok, I told him that now it's medium cooked.

I came here with my husband (then boyfriend) for a date night. We ordered a bottle of some yummy French wine and tartar for appetizer.

I'd say keep your party to around 10 people so there's some elbow room for everyone. When we were all seated they brought out warm loaves of bread with this mayo/mustard/butter spread that was good. We all thought it was plain butter and slathered it on our bread but it's a bit too mayo-ish to do that. Nonetheless the flavor was good, just don't put too much on it!We got a few plates of calamari and foie gras. I didn't try the foie gras but the calamari was great. You can never go wrong with deep fried squid and tartar sauce! My friends who did have the foie gras enjoyed it.For my main dish I got the roasted chicken entree (which I cannot remember the name of due to it being a complicated french name). It came with gnocchi and spinach and was doused in this delicious sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavors all complimented each other. The serving was perfect for one; I actually was pretty full halfway through but my boyfriend easily finished off the rest of my plate. \u00a0The birthday girl got complimentary creme bruele and we all agreed that it was probably one of the BEST creme bruele's we've tried in San Diego. The top was perfectly toasted without having a burnt flavor.Delicious place with entrees that are a bit on the pricey side (hence the four stars). We'll be back for a date night or two :)"], ["Mario P.", "Highly recommend Au Revoir Bistro. Their staff is great and their food is amazing. Great environment perfect for a groups or a small romantic meal for two. I really enjoyed that their vibe is very European, in that they allowed me to spend time with my guest even after I was done eating and in no time did I feel rushed. Thank you! From what I could see, even thought the restaurant was busy, their staff was focused trying to make sure that every guest was satisfied. At Au Revoir Bistro you will get not just great food but a great experience. I will definitely be coming back."], ["Kaje Y.", "Came here with my family + extended family. They were able to accommodate all 16 of us. Our family has a lot of food issues. Different people with nut allergies, restrictive diets, a vegan, lactose intolerance. We were seated and provided menus. I spent a week in Paris a year ago, and I recognized many of the dishes on the menu.Escargot was served out of the shell, and with a little cracker on top. I've only had it one other time and it was served in shell. However, the flavour was good.The mussels were very classic. Served in more of a cast iron dish rather than the traditional mini pot. Does not take away from the delicious flavour though!Salmon was cooked perfectly, served with 2 scallops which at first looked over cooked, but after I cut them in half, I realized they were cooked perfectly. Also served with broccolini. The tables don't have all that much room, so it's a bit of a squeeze. A small plate was dropped, and the waiter came to help clean up, and he ensured that it was not a problem and quickly cleaned and brought out a new plate.I tried the lavender fries, but wasn't a big fan. Lavender reminds me of soap, so while it was interesting, I wasn't a big fan. Waiters all speak french; the table next to us spoke exclusively in french to the waiter. Bread was served and always refilled. Water is upon request only, but was refilled constantly. The wine we ordered was delicious, but I don't know what we ordered (my uncle ordered). It was a white wine, and the waiter's favourite wine. It was fairly dry and fruit forward.

We were greeted by a bus boy (not like I have an issue with this, but you'd expect more from a nicer restaurant). He seated us on a large group people - there were 5 of us. He gave us menus and was off on his way. A waiter didn't show up for at least 5 minutes when I kept looking over at them. Maybe they were understaffed that night, I don't know, but a waiter should be at your table within the first 5 minutes of your arrival! The large group table presented to be a problem for my cousins since it was directly in the sunlight. Our request to move tables was fast and they moved us over to the booths. The rest of the night, the service was great though. Water cups were never empty. The waiter, Yann (?), was friendly and polite. Food - We ordered a variety of things and shared bits here and there. Lavender fries: addicting and strange at the same time. I was skeptical at first since I usually like lavender in sweeter things. It's a big portion for $4. Plenty to share! Black mussels (Campagnardes): creamy, fresh, and simply delicious. I got the extra grande portion (BECAUSE I SHARE) and I have to say... I pretty much ate the entire thing. I don't know how to emphasize enough how good it was. Getting mussels when you visit this restaurant is a must! Apparently they have a new seafood distributor as well, so all their items are extra fresh.The pate: pretty basic, but delicious! The duck pate is my favorite; the pork pates were nothing special.The salmon (PAVE DE SAUMON SUR FONDUE DE POIREAUX): SOOOO GOOOOD. Moist, full of flavor, and cooked to perfection. I'm really glad my sister force fed me bites of it! It comes with a creamy leek sauce that is a bit sweet, but all the flavors tie in well together. Scallops \u00a0(SAINT JACQUES AU CITRON CONFIT): I only tried the risotto part of this, but again, simply delicious. My cousin loved the scallops and wanted more even after she finished. The portion is very generous as well!I'd definitely come back here :)"], ["Shea B.", "This is an adorable little French bistro that makes you feel like you're in Paris the moment you walk in the door. Our waitress, who was wonderful was actually from Paris and still had a cute French accent. We got a bottle or French wine, after splitting it with my best friend I don't remember what it was, just that it was great. I started with the Caesar salad, which was good, and my bffl had the poached pear salad which she loved. I tried a bite of pear (poached in red wine, chocolate and cinnamon) which was amazing!!For entr\u00e9e I had the salmon and scallops. That salmon was really good, very moist. The scallops were just has good. My bffl had the coq au vin, which was a chicken dish. She LOVED it. I tried a few bites and enjoyed too(I'm not normally a chicken fan).

Calamari, excellent, perfecto! The onion soup is super excellent in flavor, piping hot, but I have to suggest that they serve it with more gruyere cheese. There was just not enough in the bowl. Also, instead of one small baguette size \"crouton\" they really need to upgrade to a healthier sized slice of bread and again, please.....more cheese! \u00a0Their aioli is excellent, sort of a mustard / hint of saffron? + garlic. \u00a0Yes, it's one of those places where you must indulge in the wonderful bread. \u00a0We each had a bowl of soup, also split a wonderful salad of mixed young leaves, and smooth goat cheese in an a perfectly balanced balsamic vinegar dressing with a poached egg on top!! \u00a0What a touch. \u00a0 \u00a0It's so refreshing when we go to a restaurant and the waiter isn't hitting on my lovely date.Thank you waiter guy."], ["Yudith H.", "I've been once and really like it, very convenient and close from lot of places, prices are good, and the flavor of the food is ...delicious!

Anyway, we ended up at Au Revoir - and No wait, lots of open tables, very nice decor. No air-conditioner! and it was one of the hottest days.. We were lucky to sit right next to the open door and felt some kind of breeze.The service was slow, apparently as expected in France. It took maybe 10 mins for our server finally come and said hi to us. We ordered plate with 3 assorted patees, and it was interesting to try different patees, even though the portions were tiny. My daughter ordered Canard Confit (Brioche, duck confit, saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce), which was really good; my husband had Jambon Fromage (Ham & swiss cheese omelet), he said it was ok, not the best omlette for sure. For myself I got Smoked salmon and asparagus omelette, which was too salty to my taste. I also had Raspberry Mimosa, but next time i will stick to original Orange one. As a dessert we had creme brulee with Latte, and it was delicious. Our server brought extra free dessert with candle for my BD girl which was a surprise, because when at the beginning I asked them if there was any birthday desserts they said unfortunately no. We will be back if we are in area because I would like to try other dishes and I don't really care if service is fast or slow.

Make sure you order the frites with lavender when you order the mussels.The ambiance is quite nice and the prices are reasonable for French Food. A large portion of the mussels is $14, the frites $3 and a brunch for four with mimosas \u00a0came to slightly more than $80. The Restaurant is tastefully decorated and clean and comfortable.

My wife and I shared all of the dishes we ordered, and we enjoyed them all! Prices were reasonable for the quality of food on offer. We started with the salad du bistro, which was very tasty and had poached pears, candied walnuts and blue cheese. We then had with the mussels with the creamy mustard sauce, which were very full of flavor. Probably the best dish we had was the salmon and scallops, which were served very hot and perfectly cooked with an outrageously good leek sauce. We then enjoyed the beef bourginion, which was rich and hearty and delicious. Two small notes on the beef bourginion though: Note 1 - The way the offer it on the menu is with pasta instead of the traditional fingerling potatoes. We had them make it the traditional way for us because it seemed odd to have beef bourginion with pasta and because my wife is gluten free. Note 2 - For my taste, the beef bourginion sauce could have had a little more red wine in it (but that may just be what I am used to). We finished up with a tasty chocolate mousse for desert, which was very well executed. In addition to the food, we also definitely enjoyed the French decor and French music as well as the Cote du Rhone they serve by the glass. We'll definitely be back!

Since this place does not open that early, it does not show up as breakfast search in yelp. But I know I have seen their huge sign of \"brunch\", so we came to this place. I got to try their bloody mary, smoked ham benedict, salmon benedict, and duck confit crepe. I strongly recommend salmon benedict. It was delicious. Also, the bread they used for benedict was really good too. I like that crepe came with salad and fruits. Reasonably priced. Service was good here. Attentive and helpful waiter. Good people watching spot. I enjoyed sitting next to the window facing to the street.

My gf and I were not sure where to eat while in town. We wanted good food and good service, you know, pretty much what everybody wants to find in a good restaurant. We decided to give this place a try. The service here was tremendously helpful and courteous. We were promptly seated even though we placed a reservation. My gf ordered the salmon entree and I ordered the duck. We ordered some calamari to share as well. The calamari was outstandingly tasty and consisted mostly of squid and not batter, which is quite uncommon given that other places put a lot of batter to make their calamari. I would say it was about 90% squid, 10% batter. The entrees came out subsequently and might I say that the salmon tasted good and fresh. The veggies and potatoes complemented the dish so it was a well balanced meal. The duck also tasted good with the lavender honey sauce on the bottom of the dish. It tasted pretty fresh and it also comes with veggies as well as potato wedges. They also put in some slices of apricot which I thought was a good idea. My gf also enjoyed the duck as well. Overall, we believe the food was superbly prepared and the service was amazingly good. I like the restaurant's idea of giving a red book for customers to write their comments/suggests so that they can improve on any weak areas that may arise. If you happen to be in the San Diego area and are craving French food, look no further than Au Revoir Bistro!"], ["Bob H.", "Great little restaurant. You'd almost think you're in Paris.

Merci"], ["Akemi W.", "I came here for a friend's birthday. We were a big group, so I got to try a lot of different items. We started with the cheese plate, pate selection, and escargot. The cheeses were all good, and the blue cheese was especially nice. I also liked the juicy, fruity grapes they came with. It was my first time trying escargot and I don't really understand the fuss, positive or negative. Everyone said that two of the pates were good, but the third tasted like wet dog. Eep! The spread (garlic aioli?) that came with the bread was great too. The lavender fries threw me at first, but I loved them by the third bite. They were especially nice dipped into the sauce from the mussels. The Ceasar salad was only so-so. Overall, the food was good, but too rich for my tastes.I would definitely come back here for dessert though. The portions were huge! Definitely share-able. The poached pear with ice cream was lovely.I'm giving 5 stars because the service was fabulous. The servers brought us copious amounts of bread and kept our water glasses full. We ranged from native French speaker to absolutely zero knowledge and complete butchering of the names on the menu (that would be me!), but there was not a bit of snobbery about pronunciation. They made a special plate that wasn't on the menu for the toddler in our group, and there was no fuss when our reservation numbers were a little off our actual number. We stayed for hours, but felt no pressure to hurry up and leave. It was a lovely night."], ["Cindy W.", "With so many french places to chose from in San Diego this is by far my favorite french restaurant. The food, the service, prices, and portion sizes are a 10!! This is not a fancy french place so you don't need to dress up. It also has a patio where dogs are allowed. Came here on a Tuesday night for their Tuesday night special. $22.95 for 3 courses including an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Many times for these pre- set 3 course dinners the portion sizes are small and the menu items aren't appetizing. However, not the case at Au Revoir. Bread: Pretty standard french loaf but it comes with a dijon mustard butter. We also tried a small order of their mussels for $8.00. This is such a steal since their small portion gives you about 25 mussels. We ordered the campagnardes mussels - creme fraiche and white wine sauce with a hint of dijon mustard. Also came with chunks of pancetta and mushrooms. The mussels tasted very fresh and not rubbery at all. Started out with the French onion soup. Ooey gooey cheese melted on top of large crispy crouton. They don't skimp on the cheese. The broth wasn't overly salty and had tons of onions in it. We also got the escargot topped with puff pastry. \u00a0You get 6 snails that are soaked in buttery parsley goodness. The butter was so good that I even dipped my bread into it. Entree: I decided to get the beef bourguingnon. Normally this is priced at $18.00 on their regular menu. The beef wasn't as tender as I expected it to be, but it was still very flavorful. 4 large chunks of beef simmered in a red wine sauce. The carrots and potatoes absorbed all the herbs and spices I couldn't stop eating them. Also tried the seafood pappardelle. Normally $17.00 on menu. \u00a0Wow! Tons of seafood. Came with 4 large shrimp, about 9 mussels, 2 large chunks of salmon and 3 pieces of lobster claw meat. None of the seafood was overcooked at all. \u00a0It came with a creme fraiche sauce, almost like an alfredo sauce but more on the lighter side. The pasta was cooked al dente and had a perfect consistency. Dessert: The creme brulee was the only let down of the meal. I thought that it had this odd paste consistency. Also ordered the poached pear in red wine sauce. It came with 2 gigantic scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. The poached pear was sweet and took on the flavor of the sweet red wine they used. Service: Water was always refilled and both our waiter and waitress were extremely friendly. They came to check on us after each dish came out. Come back again? For sure!! They seem to have a great happy hour too with appetizers including mussels, frog legs, and calamari \u00a0for around $5.00"], ["Brien S.", "I just love this place. I swear I went 3 times this week.

Its pretty authentic! The prices are rather comparable to a family bistro as well. In the 20s for most entr\u00e9e items.I usually order the Poisson du Jour as every fish preparation I've enjoyed here has been exquisite! I've seen couples or families enjoy the Moules plates and the mussels look scrumptuous. Alas, I eat alone here most nights I come so its a bit much for me to try alone so I stick with the entr\u00e9es.Well worth a try if you would like a wonderful French dinner without the pomp or cost of the more 'upscale' establishments around town.Enjoy!"], ["Trang L.", "I wouldn't consider myself a French cuisine connoisseur, but I do know what I like and I like Au Revoir.

First off.. I'm glad they have parking especially in Hillcrest.. and although it's a tiny parking lot- it's better than nothing (and we arrived at about 7ish and got a spot). The hostess who greeted us was so nice and attentive. The decor was cute and very \"French\", but not overwhelming. The ambiance was very lovely, somewhat romantic, but still felt casual and not intimidating.As far as the food.. I had gone with their prix fixe menu ($23 for 3 courses)- it's a good deal. I had their French Onion Soup which was rich and delicious- there was a hefty amount of gruyere cheese (which I love!).. very good. My entree, I had the Cod and I thought it was great. It had a great crust and the mussels that came with it had lots of flavor. And for dessert I had their bread pudding with chocolate ice cream. It was good, but really dense and a bit overwhelming for my non sweet tooth. Also I don't know if their ice cream is made in-house but I think it was over churned. None the less, I think personally I had a good experience.Now why didn't I give it 5 stars if I liked it so much.. well- my mom order the filet mignon and asked for medium, but It looked border line rare.. also the sauce that came on top of the steak was quite heavy for her taste and mines as well- better to ask for it on the side so you don't lose the integrity of the taste and quality of the beef. Also my friend and boyfriend's cod was a very thick cut compared to mines so they lost some of the flavors.Anywho.. regardless.. I, personally, would come back to this fine establishment."], ["Liz B.", "Just like being a tourist in France!

I was not expecting a 3 course prix fixe meal for $23 would be good, since one entr\u00e9e item costs $20+, so we saved an appetizer and dessert! Portions were generous. The frog legs came out nice and hot, great sauce to it. The seafood pappardelle had plenty of seafood, the rich creamy sauce had a great flavor, could be a bit spicy or have some kind of kick in it though, and the cr\u00e8me brulee was one of the best I've tried! My BF loved their dessert (the puff pastry). For an expensive place, the wine deals were so cheap. You can get a full bottle for as little as $20! And it was pretty good!

The lack of a distinct storefront was not the problem so much as the bad state the storefront was in. The space was really cramped and crowded with two parallel, diagonal tables where the pastries were displayed. If these tables were displayed side to side form a sort of countertop, that would probably be more aesthetically pleasing. Even better, an actual display case would be optimal, as the pastry displays were disorganized and too easily accessible to flies. Because of this, the apple tart I got was dried out, and the added custard on top was not enough to save it (although I appreciated the fact he boxed it up with chocolate garnishes). However, the lemon tart that was kept in the chiller in the back was cold, refreshing, and delicious.I'm sure the wares sold at the market are yummy and cute, but the storefront needs some work to match the handiwork of the pastries."], ["Maria M.", "Not worth the money nor the drive.

When I arrived to pick up the cake, I presented him with a $35 Groupon and cash. He said that the cake would instead be $15 extra, so $53 total. He said I couldn't use the Groupon on that cake because he gave me \"extra\" cake. I told him I didn't want or order extra cake, so it wasn't fair for him to charge me extra now. Then he said I wasn't allowed to use a Groupon on the cheesecake because it was a special cake and the Groupons are only for \"other\" cakes. He offered me a pie or lemon tart instead and I explained I didn't want either that I wanted a cheesecake for thanksgiving as it is a family favorite. Plus there were no restrictions marked on the Groupon. He then proceeded to say that I couldn't use a Groupon for this type of cake and I would have to pay extra for the cheesecake as he thought as I was a regular customer. I told him I was a regular customer as I had been there previously to purchase a box of macaroons. I even had two reviews on Yelp for both times! So unbelievable! Then, he said It was all a mix up with groupon and their website, but when I checked on my phone the website was correct. It was one excuse after another and the bottom line is this guy pulled a bait and switch the night before Thanksgiving to get another 15 bucks. I didn't pay the extra $15- I drove to the grocery store and picked up the ingredients I needed to make my own cheesecake, which turned out great. I will not be going back to this bakery.

Perfect texture and flavors. Quality ingredients are used and it shows. Flourless chocolate cake: OMG, I almost died! This cake is phenomenal. Definitely fits my palate for dark chocolate.

From the entrance, we only saw a few bread items, a huge pile of rather misshapen macarons strewn across a work table, and a large stack of tasty looking palmiers. Upon asking, we were also offered several cakes that were hidden in the freezer. Apparently the baker was prepping for the FM on Saturday, which he urged us to attend.I chose lemon tart and flourless chocolate cake, which he cut out in huge slices (for $6/each, not bad), and boxed up prettily with some molded dark and white chocolate. The lemon tart was good and had a lovely glaze of candied lemon on top - a nice touch in moderation. While frozen/cold, the curd was a good balance of tartness and sweetness, but at warmer temperatures started tasting on the sweet side. The cake was rather crumbly and bland, when I expected it to be smoother and sweeter. When eaten with the dark chocolate on the side, it was pretty balanced.Overall, the tastes were ok and came in relatively large quantity for the price.

Let me tell you - for $1 a macaron, it's definitely a bargain. These aren't your average came-outta-the-assembly-line macarons, but two crunchy shells filled with buttery chocolate cream or pistachio that end your meal on a sweet note. The coconut tart is full of coconut flakes and not doused in souless, tasteless whipped cream. 3 reasons I love this place so much is:1. Chef Michel, meeting, greeting and feeding his customers. He's up there listing the ingredients in his cakes and how they're made (should you want to ask) - I'm always the one stuffing my face with it while he's still talking.2. The presentation. There's something about too-perfect-lookin' cakes that scare me, as if they've been groomed from the Cake Machine. His creations draw you towards them because they appear fresh, with their imperfections made from extra icing, chocolate, and powdered sugar.3. The quality of the quantity of options. I'm always suspicious of someone who can bake cookies, cinnamon ears, cakes, and macarons. Chef Michel has proved me wrong - I've been impressed with all the goods I've bought from him so far, and he brings something new and different to the table every weekend.I'm a huge supporter of local businesses, and even more of talented individuals who give generous helpings of their foods and accept very little in return. I look forward to every Sunday for a french treat from Chef Michel and am looking forward to ordering whole cakes from him for my future dinner parties."], ["Darlene S.", "The owner and chef was such a sweet and hospitable man.

There weren't many intriguing items on sell, but what caught my attention were the cute and colorful macaroons. Although they looked a bit out of shape and there were much more fillings compared to the classical macaroons, they looked amazing. You get 3 for $5 and there are several flavors (sadly I didn't remember them). They are sooo delicious! It wasn't too too sweet which I liked a lot. The cream in between was soft and creamy, a great combination with the crust. I couldn't tell the different between the flavors but I didn't mind that at all.

I chose the Tuna Melt with the Soup of the Day (Tomato Tortellini).My Tuna Melt really hit the spot! It had the perfect ratio of cheese-to-tuna and even had little sprouts in it. The multi grain bread was really good, too. But I must say that the best part of my meal was the soup. It was so good. The tortellini wasn't too cheesy or anything, and the tomato base was perfection.We got our food to go though, because the place had a few flies. It was a bit gross, but it looks like all of the shops around there have flies because as we were walking back to our car, we noticed a lot of flies on that block.I would definitely come back here if I was in the area, but other than that, it's a bit of a drive for me. If I have a craving for a Tuna Melt and Tomato Tortellini soup, I feel that I can get it (and just as good) at Boudin or something."], ["Stefanie I.", "Cafe' de L'Opera is a great little find in the downtown area. Its such a relaxing atmosphere. The owner is really a gem and sweet lady. I love going in there and just having conversations with her. She remembered my order within 2 visits.I have never tried any food yet, but I can definitely say the coffee is great. As a frequent coffee drinker I definitely prefer the small local coffee shops over the usual Corporations. The mocha is awesome just the perfect combination on espresso, milk, and chocolate. The mocha storm is pretty delicious as well. It's a blended mocha, it threw me off guard first because it doesn't really taste chocolaty. I'm not really sure what she uses but its pretty good. But to me it doesn't taste like chocolate. I always get a couple add shots added to my blended drinks. I love the coffee taste and without the extra shots it just tastes like a sweet treat. Also, try the cookies and cream blended, AMAZING!!I hope to try some food soon, and I will definitely update about that."], ["Will K.", "Not a bad place for a quick lunch and something to drink. \u00a0Service was reserved, food was good, not great, a bit above average. \u00a0Great for people watching, and something \"different\"."], ["Jen M.", "This place is the shit! I don't know why more people haven't been here. The food is amazing. They have one of the most amazing pastries I have ever tried in my life, the almond croissant.

Huge variety of everything."], ["maymer m.", "I had cafe latte n a cup of soup of the day...The soup was tasty.The service could be little slow but not so bad. The workers were nice.I just wish their coffee was little better was not my favorite.The interior is nice very relaxing for this location. Little pricey on pastry items. I would find somewhere better with the price."], ["Esther H.", "When I got here, I realized I mistakenly looked up directions to this place and not Opera Cafe. I thought about finding the correct Opera Cafe, but I thought I'd give this place a try because it was such a short walk from work.For a cafe that seemed to be \"french\", I was confused to see gyros on their menu. Seemed very random. Anyways, I ordered a tuna melt panini and a croissant (Total $10). NOTE: Their prices on the laminated to-go menu is lower than the menu on the wall, which are the CORRECT prices.I was very disappointed by the panini. First of all, it came on a multi-grain sandwich bread, instead of ciabatta bread, which was what I was expecting. Second, the portion was small for the price ($6.WhateverCents). However, the sandwich tasted fine, came with lots of veggies (cucumber, sprouts, minced onions, etc.), and it didn't take too long to be served.Their saving grace was the croissant and the two ladies that were working. The ladies that work there are very nice and when I was there, I noticed, they were greeting some customers by name. The croissant. Almost AMAZING. The croissant was not like the kind you get at the grocery store or Starbucks. These were more like the \"real\" croissants. I definitely recommend coming here at least for the croissants!"], ["Gia B.", "I recently visited the cafe and it was great! The server (I think her name was Beth..?) was very friendly and attentive. The food was great. I had a half sandwhich + bowl of soup. The chicken noddle soup was pretty tasty! I also had a cup of coffee and an almond croissant. Beth warmed up the croissant and put butter on it --- it was so good!! :)I had a great time there and the food was pretty great, too. I plan to visit often!"], ["Chris B.", "Everything I've tried here so far has been delicious! The service, especially during the slower hours is top notch, they really go out of their way to make sure you're satisfied. I was sitting across from an older couple who had limited English skills, and the staff took the time to make sure they were taken care of and got what they wanted.Also you can't go wrong with any place that has a GIANT coffee table book on cats!"], ["Laura M.", "I head over to L'Opera during my lunch break. It's super close to my office, fast service, and GREAT fresh food.I recommend the Gyro Greek Salad and the Caprese Sandwich. The Caprese Sandwich was ESPECIALLY delicious.I haven't tried their pastries, but co-workers have raved. My only complaint is that it is SO hot in there (at least during the summer). Wish there was some AC in there so I could enjoy my delicious sandwich or salad!"], ["Heather W.", "I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars, so let's split the difference and say 3.5.They had a large sports team here which took up most of the restaurant (young kids), so we sat outside. Heat lamps are very important in these parts, and their's did the trick.They had a nice selection on the menu and the prices were extremely reasonable. Service was so-so. The server was very nice, just not exactly quick with checking on us, and took quite awhile to pick up our credit card after she delivered our check.My tomato soup was okay. Nothing to write home about. Had better, had worse.Boyfriend's spaghetti pomodoro wasn't a true pomodoro sauce, but was tasty. I didn't love the meatballs.Our friends had the ravioli -didn't try it, and a penne dish. The penne was good and spicy. Could definitely clear your sinuses!I'd go back if I was looking for something safe and reasonably priced, but Buon Apetito in Little Italy or Acqua al 2 also in the Gaslamp still have my vote for better Italian in the downtown area, although neither can beat the prices offered at Cafe' de L'Opera."], ["Maria R.", "I work down the street and I've been to Cafe de L'Opera many times over the past year and each time I have not been disappointed. First of all, \u00a0the staff (Lane and Beth) are the nicest people and make it a pleasure to come in to see them. \u00a0No matter how busy they are, they always take the time to greet me by name and I see them do that with their other customers as well. \u00a0Secondly, and most importantly, their food and cafe beverages are great. \u00a0Today I ordered the ham and egg croissant sandwich with a mexican mocha. \u00a0It was the perfect flaky croissant and the mexican mocha always starts my day perfectly. Honestly, everything on their menu has always been yummy. Lastly, their bakery items are amazing. \u00a0I know they get to work early in the morning to bake most, if not all, of their baked goods. \u00a0I feel very fortunate to have such a wonderful bakery within walking distance from my work!"], ["Nathaniel P.", "It has a cute and comfortable decor, and also a small section of outside seating. Great selection of teas, and the menu is rather expansive. It is a family owned establishment, and the employees couldn't be more friendly. They serve many sandwhiches, paninis, soups, salads, pastries, espresso options, and teas.They gave us great recommendations, and the food is made right before your eyes. I ordered the ham and cheese panini, and also got salad along with it. It's not going to be the best meal you've ever had, but it is satisfying. \u00a0There are comfy couches inside, which is always a major plus for me. If you're ever in downtown San Diego, do yourself a favor and stop by this local, family owned eaterie."], ["Taku N.", "They have something you cannot get at other restaurants.This place is good for lunch, and probably it's better to have to go."], ["Lilly G.", "I've driven by this cafe and kept meaning to go in. Finally today I headed over here, and I am so glad I did!I have to agree with the other reviews here- L'Opera has it all- very charming French decor, a classy menu, delicious coffee drinks, and to top it off, excellent service. \u00a0As soon as you step in, you're in another world- it's quite different than the other cafes in the area. \u00a0I'm so glad I found it- when the proprietor told me to \"come back soon\" I could honestly answer that I'll be back tomorrow!note: this cafe doesn't have internet, which is usually an auto-fail for me in cafes, but that's how freaking cute this place is!"], ["natasha s.", "My tuna melt panini was awesome!!! I had been tempted to try to this place for a while but there was something about the outside that made me keep walking every time I passed it. Today I made up my mind that I was going to try it after seeing that they had a 4 star rating on yelp. I don't mean to be cliche' but I will quote the famous saying \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". I was not at all expecting for a tuna melt to be as good as this one was. They used a multi grain bread that had a slight grill but was not too crunchy. The tuna had the basics, mayo, relish, mustard. But on the sandwich itself came tomato, cucumber, and cheddar cheese. All of these ingredients combined made one fantastic panini. I think I will put this on my weekly to-do list!"], ["Sandy D.", "I ordered the Grilled Chicken Ciabatta sandwich and took the suggestion of adding a side salad for one dollar. I'm so glad I did because I really enjoyed the dressing (Kimi's) that came on it and the salad itself was really very tasty. Along with the chicken, the sandwich included provolone, peppers and pesto and was slightly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. \u00a0 If I make it here again, I'll order some kind of grilled chicken salad, I'm already craving more of that dressing."], ["Tiffany L.", "Got some breakfast to-go the other day. My husband went to pick it up, and couldn't say enough about how sweet the two ladies working were. While some things about this place was great, some were not, but I would definitely give it another try. Iced Vietnamese coffee was good, and the Mexican Mocha was very sweet but also good. A lot of care and time went into making the drinks. I got the Egg and Cheese Bagel, which came on a blueberry bagel. Egg and cheese on a blueberry bagel...not a match made in heaven. It was very odd and the bagel was soggy. The ham and cheese croissant was good. Their croissants are very good, buttery and perfectly flaky. The almond croissant was also good, but I didn't care for the brownie, the texture was very off-putting, almost underdone. I would come back again to give them a fair run."], ["Natalie D.", "I recently went to this cafe and it was amazing!!! \u00a0Their costumer service was on point and they were very attentive.

What? Mais pourquoi? Aha, now we know why. Heavy and masculine, these fries would make a trucker swoon. The French Onion soup was comforting but not its savory full-powered onion self and the bouillabaisse lacked the telling fennel, saffron and orange kiss that could've propelled this beautiful stew into the stars. I feel this Provencal dish should be served with bread to sop up the soup, alas...it was not.Hands down, the service was on point. \u00a0Two men, deftly working the tiny room as patrons enjoyed the evening in an enchanting, Parisian setting, French music tinkling in the background. \u00a0Street parking was easy and despite the restaurant being very small, we were able to garner a good table next to the French doors.

Indeed, dining at La Bonne Table made me believe for an hour or so that I was no longer in the U.S. \u00a0Who knew that a charming and adorable European escape existed on 5th Avenue? The interior of La Bonne Table is lovely. Tiny space, perhaps only large enough to accommodate nine or ten tables. Small, cute bar with about four stools. Dim, intimate ambiance with French bistro-like music playing lightly in the background, flirting with your ears and sensibilities. I was sucked in.To start, I selected the Fris\u00e9e Salad. It was constructed with a mustard vinaigrette that was subtle, but present enough to completely flavor the dense greens without being overpowering. It was served wtih a slender piece of bread covered in a delicious goat cheese. I loved this very much and gobbled every last morsel. For my entree, I opted for the Duck Confit. Without exaggeration, this was the best duck I've experienced in San Diego. The skin was flavorful and crispy, yet the duck itself was juicy and tender. Magnifique!I certainly wasn't ready for the evening to end without dessert. As such, I selected the Chocolate Mousse that's served topped with a lovely whipped cream. The density of the mousse was lovely. It wasn't fluffy and light; rather, it had a nice density to it that I expect in a good mousse. Masterfully executed dessert that I wouldn't hesitate to order again.The wait staff were superb! Attentive, constantly monitoring and scanning the dining room to ensure no one's water glass was near empty, bread basket's replenished, etc. They even politely tolerated my awful, fleeting attempts to pronunciate my menu selections in their proper French names.As I write this review I'm still thinking about the duck. Drooling, actually."], ["Carli A.", "One of my favorite dining experiences ever at this authentic French bistro. Everything was delicious from the craft cocktails and beers, to probably the best duck I've ever had, to our splurge on some of their luscious desserts. They even gave me my dessert for free because we originally tried to go on my birthday but it was a Sunday and they were closed. That was really sweet. It is a bummer that they're closed on Sundays though. We ate on the patio which was relaxing and cool for people watching in a vibrant neighborhood. It felt casual yet upscale and romantic.

Perfect size to enjoy the intimate restaurant. We sat inside as it was a chilly evening, and the small tables are decorated simply and comfortably.I had heard good things about the cocktails, so we opted for that direction (vs wine). Tried a boulevardier and the St. Germain martini. My boulevardier was tasty, though simple; hubby enjoyed his martini (though only 1 choice of gin, and not his fave). I seconded with a classic old fashioned, and was sadly not pleased. Very unbalanced. For those who enjoy a classic drink, you know that the ingredients and the mixing and of utmost importance. Thus, perhaps wine is the way to go?The food. Now we're talkin'!Started with the duck pate, and it was delectable. Served with a bit of fris\u00e9e and a few cornichons, the dish was perfect served with their baguette.For main dishes, we ordered the duck and the trout. Both were delicious; well seasoned and presented, and perfectly portioned.I just had to try the chocolate mousse, so we did. Not bad. A bit too dense - more like a cross between a mousse and a flourless chocolate cake; and a bit too sweet (ameliorated by dipping my spoonfuls into espresso :) All in all, though, still enjoyable.Service was excellent.

The cocktails were very French - I had the lillet and the kir - and quite good. However, I was disappointed in their food. The escargot was acceptable, nothing amazing. But their steak-frites was sorely lacking. The steak was properly cooked and good. But the frites were dreadful. Oily, over salted and poorly cooked. When a restaurant only has four entrees on their menu they need to all be executed flawlessly. Flawlessly. The frites were so poorly prepared it was borderline inexcusable. \u00a0I hate to give a poor rating solely because of french fries; however, when they are such an integral part of one of your four entrees they must be better prepared."], ["Leonard S.", "I literally walked three miles to get to here; well technically I was in the neighborhood when I discovered this place although I did walk the three miles to get here. \u00a0The point is I would do it daily if need be just to find my way back here.The food is the real star here and just excellent in my opinion. \u00a0 Seafood stew, duck confit, duck liver, and the tuna tartare; dont get me started. \u00a0 The drinks are also quite good as is the short but quite excellent wine list.

We both wanted the escargots, but I convinced my husband to order the duck pate special so that we could try both. Great decision! Both dishes were perfectly seasoned, and we appreciated the chef's deft hand with the garlic in the escargots.Hubby had the boudin noir (a favorite of his that you rarely see on a menu in SD) and said it was the best he had ever had. He particularly appreciated what a balanced dish it was. I had the duck confit and could not have been more pleased. The duck thighs were tender and flavorful, and the lentils had a little something special that I never could quite place. (Balsamic vinegar?) The wine we chose was very good (and we thought fairly priced). We were two very happy diners. We each finished with the chocolate mousse.

The food- exquisite! I did the three course meal with wine pairings. First dish was an salmon appetizer (sort of like a spread): that was not so bad. Very interesting. It was paired with their selection of Chardonnay. Typically I avoid drinking Chardonnay for I do not fancy it..but the glass they served us was so yummy! Worked very well with the fish. The second course/main entree was a bowl of bouillabaisse-- you get the real deal seafood stuff, no joke. It came out with a lobster claw on the side, large clams, mussels, a nice slab of cod and a piece of toast with a spread on it to dip into the broth. So mouth watering! This was paired with Rose (excellent choice by the restaurant once again). I tried some of my friend's pinot noir, which was also great (she had the duck). Lastly, we had creme brulee with some sweet wine that had hints of apricot. We were asked politely to do a favor for the restaurant and move to a smaller table outside the patio because a group had been waiting for 45 minutes outside and they felt bad. Of course we moved for them~ and as a result, the restaurant was so kind enough to deduct the wine pairing from our bill :)"], ["Michele D.", "Outstanding!! Went with friends last night and loved every minute of it!!! Limited menu, but the food is true French food to the T. \u00a0I started with the French onion soup and it was fantastic.

I'm happy to try it even without all the advertisement. \u00a0First comes a piece of extra sour sourdough baked by by a local baking company (server says SD baking co) Though overwhelming at first, the tanginess became addicting. The combination of a soft bread and hard outer crust is perfection. Butter makes it better. The mussel bisque en croute comes, and immediately the server pierces the puff pastry crust with a spoon and pours sherry inside. The broth is smooth and delicious. I cannot wait to come back to have this again."], ["Brittany N.", "I found this place on the food network app called food maps, had a bit of trouble finding the place, and people who worked within blocked of the restaurant had never heard of the place. The hunt was worth it. The place was adorable, it was on the smaller side, quant. And we came at an off time between lunch and dinner, so we got special attention from the bartender. We both ordered the mussel bisque en croute. It was served in a bowl with a flaky pastry baked on top. The spoon was stuck in the middle of the bowl, and after setting both of our soups down, the bartender poured sherry into each. Excellent presentation. It was the best thing I ate throughout our 16 day road trip. I highly recommend."], ["Ryan R.", "Went here with the family to grab a bite for dinner on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself has a nice setup and has a nice ambiance as well. It was busy, but we were able to grab a table upstairs right away.To start we ordered the baked brie and the famed mussel soup. Mussels aren't really my thing, and because of that, I wasn't a huge fan of the soup overall--as was anyone at our table. The brie was pretty good, but we had to get it reheated since they had undercooked it the first time around.For my meal, I decided to go with the chilean sea bass at the recommendation of our waitress and was pleasantly surprised. The fish was cooked perfectly and went well with the sauce and potatoes that it came with, and was a decent-sized portion to boot. I also tried bites of my parents baked salmon and my brothers ribeye--both of which were tasty as well.Overall, the service here was excellent and the food came out in a decent amount of time. The dishes are a bit pricy, but the quality and amount of food is well worth it.

We started out with escargot which were decadent and the melted garlic butter went great with the terrific sourdough bread. We then shared a beet salad that was also very good. For our entrees, my wife enjoyed the salmon served in puff pastry and with a brie cheese saffron sauce. I had the duck l'orange which I never had before and it was divine. The screen was crispy and the sauce was delicately sweet . \u00a0 Our server Jasmine was terrific and after telling her it was our anniversary, she said our bottle of pellegrino was on the house.

You enter into a what I recall to be a quaint east coast style tavern on the bottom and the food magic is served in an upstairs loft. \u00a0We started by sharing an order of Clams a' la Provencale and a Roasted Beet and Tarragon Cr\u00e8me Fraiche salad (the website says its beef, it's actually beet). Both were very good and would have again. \u00a0If you have the clams and you want to be sinful, get some extra pieces of their delicious bread and save for dunking in the sauce (wish we had).For a main course, my wife had the Chilean Sea Bass and I had the Seared Sea Scallops. \u00a0Both were delicious and prepared and presented very nicely. \u00a0My wife likes the sea bass cut thick, and this was. \u00a0The sauce with it was awesome. \u00a0Still have a bite or two of bread left? \u00a0Hit that sauce with it.My scallops were also prepared and presented in a superb manner. \u00a0For desert, my wife wanted the berry cobbler, but they were out of it. \u00a0The waiter offered an off the menu replacement, mixed berries in a puffed pastry shell. \u00a0She took the offer, and liked it a lot.

I feel bad about writing this review because our bartender/server Alex was so incredibly gracious and professional, and the dishes looked great. I truly want to see local old-school service-focused places like Dobson's succeed in downtown San Diego.Unfortunately, the flavor of the food during my one visit was very disappointing. It is entirely possible that the kitchen was having an off-night, but there are too many spendy alternatives downtown for me to want to give Dobson's another try for the foreseeable future.Mussels Bisque En Croute ($10) - This is the dish that Dobson's is known for, and it was one of the most beautiful soup presentations I've had served to me in my life. It featured puff pastry baked on top of a bowl, completely enclosing the bisque. Alex, the bartender, poked a hole in it and poured in sherry. I took a sip of the broth and was pleased by the sinful sweetness of the creamy bisque. All was good until I bit into a mussel: it tasted rancid. Mussels should taste like the sea, not like the sewer. And, unfortunately, these mussels tasted like turds. I suspect these were either not cooked correctly or not properly stored. I ended up forcing down quite a few and did not get sick or anything, so it is possible these were just low-quality foul-tasting mussels.Mustard Crusted Rack of Lamb ($34) - Again, Dobson's earns an \"A\" on presentation -- but there were quite a few things wrong with this dish. Most importantly, the lamb came out very tough (I ordered medium rare), and I acknowledge that lamb is difficult to work with, but if you charge $34 for your lamb dish, it should be better than this. There was no discernible \"mustard\" crust -- it almost seemed as if the kitchen simply forgot to season the lamb. The mashed potatoes were good, and the au jus made a decent light gravy for them. Saut\u00e9ed squash and zucchini was served on the plate, which was probably the most edible thing I paid for at Dobson's.I will give Dobson's props on their complimentary sourdough bread -- very tasty; quite \"sour\" and yeasty. If the other food was even half as good as the bread, I'd head back there. But given the overall taste and texture of the food I ordered, I cannot recommend Dobson's."], ["Mathew W.", "Great mussel bisque, bartender was awesome. Will definitely stop back again on this trip."], ["Charlie C.", "I been wanting to tr Dobson for years and I was so excited to finally get to eat here while celebrating my friends bday. First \u00a0idea popped into my head once I stepped into the establishment was \"Cool, I going some where!\" What I mean by that is the decor of the place takes you away from the Downtown SD noise. I love that when a restaurant's atmosphere does that to me. After reading many reviews from other Yelpers, I had to try the Dobson's Mussel Bisque en Cro\u00fbte and to go along with that their Rib Eye and a White Russian to finish the meal. The bisque was rich, creamy, and it had that delicate mussel flavor. The pieces of mussels were not over cooked and tender to the bite! My rib eye was perfectly cooked -rare. What elevated the dish was the green peppercorn sauce. Oh wow! It had the peppercorn spice but also a floral note to it -that was very interesting. The light floral flavor from the green peppercorns plays well with the rich n heavy hunk of beef. Oh and that bread was pretty dam good. I can't wait for my next dinner here."], ["Samie R.", "Dobson's Bar & Restaurant is such a Nice, Comfortable establishment. I can't believe it took me and my Wife this long to finally go there.

Away from all the madness of the Gaslamp, it's a perfect place for a nice Quite dinner. There's a big bar and a couple of small tables on the bottom level with the rest of the dinning area up on the Mezzanine. Lots of wooden furniture to go along with big wooden bar area. White Tablecloths with the standard fancy set-up of wine glasses and silverware. Only hang-up I had was, the table we sat in was a \"2-top\" and it was a really SMALL table... although the size of the table didn't bother me much, it was how Close the tables were to each other. But what are you gonna do, it's a small place. The Service: The service was Great! Nothing like being greeted by the Owner of the restaurant as you get there!! We made reservations and showed-up 10 mins early... we were seated Immediately. Our server was very prompt and polite. \u00a0I brought my own bottle of Wine with me, and they were more than happy to accommodate. As a matter of fact, they didn't charge me a Corkage Fee because my wife and I were there celebrating our Wedding Anniversary!! Awesome!!The Food: Food was Good! The Menu is not too big (which is a good thing in my opinion) ... and The Mussel Bisk !?!? ... WOW.... just WOW! My wife and I both ordered the famous soup for starters, and it has to be one of the BEST soups I've ever eaten. Flakey, buttery, pastry top with a super savory soup... and it was at perfect temperature!! For our meal, I had the night's special, PorkChop & Scallops served with port wine reduction, Veggies and Mashed Potatoes. I was a good meal, only thing I can say is it was a little bit Under Seasoned. My wife had the Salmon served with Veggies... she fully enjoyed it, but did mention that the dish was missing some starch, potatoes, rice or something else. Good food, a little under seasoned and a little over priced. I'm going to go back to try other menu items, but the issues with the food is what makes this a 3-star, not a 4-star review.The Booze: Since I brought my own bottle of Wine, we did not order Booze... but they do have a full bar and a pretty good selection of Wine.The Phat: Old Skool Restaurant / Bar. It's been operating for over 30 years!

Alex garnishes it by poking a hole in the pastry and applying a generous shot of sherry. Honestly it just wasn't my cup of tea. The mussels were overcooked and chewy. The bisque, while a good flavor, was too watery for my taste. The puff pastry served as a nice crouton in the bisque but those rubbery mussels kept getting in the way.

Perhaps it was the chill in the air that night, but this warm and flavorful fondue's was one of the best I ever had.Our friendly and attentive bartender Michael told us the sourdough bread (which as other reviewers correctly noted is great) was from the La Jolla Baking Company - lajollabaking.com.

We were led to a prime table upstairs that overlooks the balcony. We were served fresh warm sourdough bread - YUM!!!!!!!Each of us ordered the mussel bisque ($9) and did the split order of the calamari steak sandwich ($11). Split charge of $3.The bisque is served with a puff pastry covering the bisque. It was requested that Paul \"break my bread\" since I was the Dobson's virgin. Sherry was then poured into the bisque. OMG, it was delish!!!!!!!! It would be even more decadent if it was thicker like a chowder. I was disappointed that I didn't get enough mussels, but I was given some from my partner's bisque. The calamari steak was good, although I'm not sure if I'd order it again. The calamari steak was tender and breaded. It had a little kick to it, but nothing I wasn't able to handle. Service was outstanding even with the busy-ness of lunch. (It starts to get busy after 12p. Make reservations, if possible.) Park at Horton for 3 hours free parking.Warning: You may get intimidated by the ambiance. As I looked around, I was the youngest one in the establishment.

Oh, my. This was a very rich dish. The linguine was cooked perfectly al dente and they certainly didn't skimp on clams. If I have any complaint about the dish, it's that it was a little too rich.The sourdough bread is amazing. I ate way too much of it - if that's possible - but would gladly more often break my \"avoid carbs\" habit just to enjoy this bread more often.My lunchmates ordered a tuna sandwich, a salad, the mussel bisque, and a shrimp dish. All were good; one did manage to think the shrimp dish was a little light, but I think it was an appetizer anyhow. It seemed to be a decent amount of food however and good for lunch.Dobson's keeps the drinks coming. Well, I'll admit - it wasn't alcohol I was drinking - but they offer tea, and one of the things I rate with a lot of restaurants is how well they keep your drink glasses full. I never had to complain about not getting enough water, hot or cold!Prices aren't cheap; but you're getting great service, well-crafted food, and a nice experience. I am certain I'll get the mussel bisque next time. One of my lunchmates said it was the best thing on the menu and I'm sure she isn't wrong.The decor is a little outdated but not a big deal.

We asked them to fix it, and the server was pretty good about not taking it personally. I also ordered the steak and it was just okay.

For a starter I ordered the cheese plate. They were firm cheeses, but to me still needed a bit of time out of the cooler before being served, For our main dishes my friend had the Cobb salad. she felt that there was some additional items not traditional of a Cobb salad that threw it off. For my meal I had the steak sandwich. The bread was entirely to large for the actual steak and unfortunately the steak was chewy. It was just OKWhen all one can say is, well the free bread they came out with was good, then you know things didn't go so well...and we only got one piece of thatMay give it another chance for dinner, but as far as lunch I will look for other options"], ["Danielle O.", "As everyone else says get the Mussel Bisque!!!

I told him that and he got to making it right away with a smile. Let me say, YUM YUM YUM! That was the first delicious thing I had to start the night. The blackberry mojito was delicious and I ended up having two!Now for dinner, we undoubtedly ordered the mussel bisque and again we were not disappointed. I don't even like seafood much, but I could have mussel bisque for dinner for ever. The bread bowl they make it in was amazing and the bisque itself was unbelievable. Also, the freshly baked bread was mouth watering good. I ordered the filet and my husband had the pork chops. Both were tender and flavorful. I doubt you could go wrong ordering any entree there.

Walk into the beautiful awe inspired vintage room, glance at the height of the overhead, peak at the original liquor cabinet ( that's still being used) the Spanish made beer tap, the sexy mezzanine, and the low laying marble tables along the left attached to the banquet...perfect for a wine party.Sit anywhere, because anywhere in the house is good, of course I'd choose downstairs to witness all the action and the most beautiful women in all of San Diego EVER...I'm not kidding it's a sex-pot factory.Start with cocktails, open up some wine, get a cup or bowl of the mussel bisque...it's iconic, it's delicious, the cup or bowl is covered in puff-pastry, the server will add a dash of cream sherry..and you'll think your in heaven. Stand-by dishes are just about everything from the filet to my personal favorite the bistro chicken, did I mention that Paul fly's in the sourdough bread from San Francisco and finishes baking it in house.

There is a cozy bar area when you first walk in to the restaurant. We were there for dinner, so we were immediately led up the stairs to a loft, which is the main dining area. Like everyone else that come here, I very much wanted to try the Mussels Bisque en croute. One word: Excellent! If you are coming here for the first time, this is a must-try! However, this is not the thing that I would be writing home about... the most memorable thing I had there was the fragrant and flavorful sourdough bread! If I had no shame, I would have asked them if I could take home the entire loaf, but instead I will come back again to enjoy it in the restaurant with my good friends.For my entree, I had the filet mignon. The cut of meat was very good, but it really did not need such heavy sauce. A good cut of filet mignon is beautiful alone, or with very minimal sauce. And the cut of filet mignon here was very beautiful and delicious; they did not need to mask it under so much sauce. Maybe I should have ask for the sauce on the side... I'll do so next time.We finished off our meal with dessert and coffee, and went home very satisfied!

It was very rich and filling, however, so keep this in mind if you plan on ordering other things. The salad was good... not too hard to mess up salad. But I really didn't like how they topped the salad with anchovies. Even after removing them, my salad still tasted so fishy. I sat at the bar, and the bartender was pretty cool... service was fine.

Duck tasted a bit too raw for me.- Creme brulee: decent but nothing mind blowingService was great. The owner came to check on us once or twice as well. When we were done w/ dinner, we headed to the bar downstairs. The bartenders were fantastic. Manny (?) welcomed us and made sure we had a drink in our hands all night.

Cute decor, nice waitstaff. No reservations but we were seated promptly outside, as requested. Food was rich/heavy, so we didn't even have room to order entrees! Appetizers ordered:- duckfat truffle fries: the earthy truffle flavor really shined through, and the fries were cooked to the right amount of crispiness on the outside.- escargot au gratin: garlic & herb butter paired really well with the escargot, and even better with the ciabatta and fries! - octopus special: glad we went with our waitress' recommendation, because the octopus was lightly breaded and cooked to a wonderful, tender consistency. The food was solid, but, to me, the friendly waitstaff is what gives the Smoking Goat that extra star."], ["Drew L.", "Prelims: a nice hipster feeling restaurant located in North Park, the Smoking Goat is a very dark restaurant, with lots of open air, bar and table seating, and the perpetual terrible parking situation that seems to plague every good food location. I came here because it was recommended to me by a friend and we ordered here because it was something he wanted to try. I ordered the half chicken and my friend ordered the skate (looks like a stingray). Service was fantastic - even with the hiccup of the guy giving us the wrong check, they took care of us with constant water filling, asking us if we were alright, making sure we got what we needed, recs all around, etc. That level of service makes it a lot better. What we go ended up ~$50, so be prepared to shell out some dough. I ordered the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. My friend ordered the skate specials and we got the goat meatballs as the appetizer. The goat meatballs were ok - they were dry and while the marinara sauce was delicious, it had a bit of a metallic taste to it. the flavors were all present, but I wished it was a bit juicier - it may be a symptom of the goat meat, but the marinara sauce did little to help it out. But objectively very tasty. The skate was very good - a bit buttery and one always wishes there was more if the food tastes good, but the skate was very delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the small sample bites that I got. The chicken was pretty good - the skin was crispy, the meat juicy, and the green beans were crisp and retained their shape and flavor very well. However, the chicken came out in a cast iron pan that was piping hot and I burned my tongue on the chicken :'( The mashed potatoes tasted as they should, neither too creamy nor too much texture, which is how I actually prefer my mashed potatoes. However, overall, the dish was very, very salty. I was constantly drinking water throughout the dinner and I was very grateful that my server would bring water constantly because I would constantly drink it all down. While the flavor was good, the saltiness was very overpowering and I wasn't overall very impressed as a result. As I read the other reviews, it seems that I didn't get something common, but nonetheless one must report the truth of what happened as my experience. It was kind of sad, as I wished it was as good as the reviews reported. As such, due to dry meatballs and salty chicken, I gotta say that my experience was just ok - and unfortunate because I feel like it could have been better.TL;DR unmet expectations due to salt."], ["jonny s.", "I heard so much hype about this place being delicious. Overall disappointed in just about all dishes that we ordered. 1. Escargot: just smothered in butter and no real seasoning.2. Tartare: cheap cut of meat and drenched in sauce that just over powered the meat.3.pasta: $18 for a vegetarian pasta that not only tasted bland but wasn't even made in house and topped off with canned tomato sauce. 4.chicken: How can you mess this up right? Wrong! Super dry and flavorless. 5.pork chop: cooked really well and good portion but all the seasoning that the other dishes missed were on this plate and turned out super salty. Overall just inconsistent with flavors \u00a0and overpriced for cheap quality food.

Bar area \u00a0is usually fine, but had a glimpse of the \"kitchen view\" bar area and asked to move. Our server, Jordan, was happy to move us and was gracious the entire night - our beer and water glasses were never empty. I have a feeling the service is the same with any server/bartender you have. We wanted a little of everything so my boyfriend and I ordered 2 beers (humble legit), a cheese plate, mussels, duck fat fries, and the pork chop. Everything was just as wonderful as expected. Beer was good, cheese was blue, fries were perfectly crunchy, mussels were warm and soupy, and the grits with the pork was thee best. I was looking forward to the short ribs I read about in a review, but I assume the menu changes often. Wish I had room for dessert - I'll have the griddled banana bread next time. They also have a huge wine list, but if you want more beer options, visit Blue Foot next door before or after dinner. Atmosphere was nice - not too fancy shmancy.

We came to visit a friend who manages the place, who very kindly hooked us up with an appetizer and foisted dessert upon us that we were too full to eat but devoured anyway. The bluefin crudo was delicious and fresh, and the additions of flavors like Persian cucumber, mandarin orange and nuts were surprisingly yummy and interesting - beyond the expected ceviche or soy sauce and wasabi. Jack and I shared the burrata prosciutto salad because burrata, and it was a perfect portion to share, the balsamic sweetness offsetting the nutty cheese perfectly. I had the meatball app as an entree, and Jack got the porkchop subbing out grits for the duckfat fries, which were baller and delicious. The porkchop was outstanding, one of if not the best porkchop we've ever tasted. They apparently do a two-day wet brine, with brown sugar and star anise, and it makes the chop moist and flavorful all the way through. Outstanding.

Executive Chef Fred Piehl created this French-American restaurant that surprises me every time I'm there. Modern, creative interior. Warm and lively atmosphere. Well-thought menu and drinks. What more can you ask for?Our table came here for the Happy Hour (5pm-6pm during the week, all appetizers $6, beer $4!) and tried almost every item on the menu. Fantastic were the DUCKFAT TRUFFLE FRIES ($8 regular price), the DUCK LIVER PATE ($9), the MAC AND CHEESE ($10) as well as the GOAT MEATBALLS ($10).My regular menu's favorites are PORCHETTA (slow cooked pork belly, cheesy polenta, upland cress, relish of goathorn peppers, \u00a0roasted tomatoes, chickpeas, $23) and the STEAK FRITES (10oz natural angus ribeye, caramelized shallots, foie gras & thyme butter, red wine sauce, duckfat truffle fries, $32).

This place is packed. We came on a Saturday night and wasn't expecting to eat here at first, but the overrated Underbelly had a line out the door and to the left! We decided to pass on that and wanted to see if we can get a table or bar seat at the smoking goat. We were able to grab some bar seats in the back.Started off with some mac and cheese, and it was good. Not as good as how my friend makes it with a crunchy top using cheese it crackers, but good compared to other places. For my entree I got the maple duck and it was delicious. The duck tasted like duck but not dry duck. It was definitely different from what I'm used to (roasted duck hanging in those Asian windows...). The juiciest duck ever. Wish it was a bit cheaper so we could order more! But probably will come back for restaurant week or a special occassion."], ["Melanio F.", "I'm a fan of Happy Hour. \u00a0Met with a couple of friends with another friend visiting from San Francisco. \u00a0 Happy Hour always mean reasonable prices. \u00a0We ordered so much, for a group of 5 we still tallied about $110 plus. \u00a0It must have been that rush to order more since our last member arrived at the tip of the HH ending.Overall, nice beer selection for HH but I am not an expert so 3 choices might be too little for some but perfect for me. I had the orange wheat (2 in fact) which went smoothly than most beers I drink. \u00a0My friends had white wine (I think there were 5 glasses consumed). \u00a0The late friend had the same beer as me but he mentioned that he also was not a person who can judge which beer is the best.We ordered most of the Happy Hour food menu except the salad I think. \u00a0We had the mac and cheese (which I didn't taste - dairy). \u00a0But we ordered several helpings of truffle fries (duck fat), goat meatballs (still not sure if it's name for the restaurant or its made of lamb) but certainly good. \u00a0The escargot, not the best I have had but it was passable and the toast that came with it was perfectly crunchy and buttery. \u00a0And my friend ordered the salad off the menu (beet) and she seemed to enjoy it.Overall, I give a high rating for a quick Happy Hour for a small group, chit chatting, reminiscing and updates. \u00a0Somewhere along the discussion was planning a trip to Mexico (which logistically is going to be hard to plan with everyone's schedule). \u00a0I would have to try them for dinner sometime (I failed to look at the menu to see what they offer regularly). \u00a0It was not as busy as most restaurants could be but that's perfect when you are meeting friends and want to be able to get in all those HH orders before the end of."], ["Lily W.", "My friend and I came here for San Diego Restaurant Week to celebrate his new job and we were not disappointed a bit. We were able to secure a reservation online and were seated immediately. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, and casual, slightly quirky. Our waiter got us started with water right away and let us look through the menu. For appetizers we enjoyed the prosciutto, arugula, and burrata salad and smoking goat meatballs. The salad was a bit imbalanced as it had too much prosciutto to the arugula amount, but the burrata was great. The smoking goat meatballs were interesting, slightly tough but I assume that's the nature of the meat itself. For entr\u00e9es, I chose the duck and my friend had the steak frites. My duck was perfectly cooked, super tender. The butternut risotto was not quite married well with the duck sauce, but the brussel sprouts were a nice pairing. The duck fat truffle fries were excellent - the mustard aioli and sharp cheese cut the fat really well. The steak itself was alright, nothing special. For dessert we had the goat cheese cheesecake and strawberry rhubarb panna cotta. Both were great and creamy. The waiter brought over a surprise flute of champagne to accompany the cheesecake for my friend as I had requested a celebratory surprise in my reservation. Overall service was great. The waiters were all very attentive to our water needs, got food out to us fast, and I really appreciated their efforts to surprise my friend. One problem I had with the restaurant was its location - parking is a bit difficult to come by in North Park, and it was situated next to a bar that had many bikers who ruined outside dining with the gas emissions from their bikes. Also, the table next to us had slightly smelly people, but I suppose it's not the restaurant's responsibility to regulate personal hygiene."], ["Sarah M.", "The Smoking Goat, an Americanized French bistro in North Park makes everything an experience. From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted by a friendly staff that truly enjoys being there. It only takes one bad seed to ruin a perfect dining experience but everyone at The Smoking Goat was incredibly nice. The atmosphere is warm and inviting with quirky art fixtures and an open kitchen. It's somewhere in between being at your crazy uncles and the finest restaurant you've ever been to; and I love it all the more for that. The Smoking Goat is indulgent without being pretentious and I give high regards to the team that started this restaurant. The food is rich and seasoned to perfection. We started our meal with the octopus special. It was cooked perfectly, super tender and not chewy or tough. The beet salad balances out the earthiness of the beets with sweet candied nuts and it's my favorite salad on the menu. The real star of the evening was the pork chop. Equal parts savory and sweet it was the perfect balance for an entree. The polenta on and the greens along were the perfect balance to make this dish the ultimate comfort food. Because who says comfort food has to be a boring plate of Mac n cheese?? Like I said, The Smoking Goat makes dining out an experience from start to finish. The service and the food is impeccable and I can't wait to dine there again."], ["Kristen B.", "Holy guacamole. This place is the bomb. I've wanted to try it for a long time but never had the occasion, until this past weekend. My man is leaving on a deployment, his birthday is coming up, and we had friends in town so it was the perfect chance to try it. You MUST get reservations. You'll thank yourself later. Loved the decor and the intimate feeling of the place. Also the padded chairs were amazing. Our service was great and our waiter was very helpful and attentive. They have an excellent wine menu, a good variety of beers, and some cocktails but they don't have a full liquor license so it looked like the majority of their cocktails were made with soju. The ladies got wine, the guys got beer. We ordered the duck fat fries and meatballs as our app. OMG. Those fries though!!! I'm still craving them and could have ate a bucket of them. So tasty and the mustard aioli I could have ate straight out of the ramekin all night. The meatballs were super tasty as well. I ordered the steak and frites...MORE duck fat fries and a PERFECTLY cooked medium rare steak in a delicious sauce. I am not a huge beef eater but I almost finished that whole steak in 2 minutes.

Now the food:The escargot was perfectly cooked and simply amazing. It had the \"earthy\" taste but not too much where it can kind of taste like earth unlike others we've tried. (idk if that made sense lol) It came with some toast that can be enjoyed more if you dip it in the escargot's sauce. We also had the mac and cheese and it was good. Though plenty, it was very light, like what an appetizer should be. Now for the entrees, Ian ordered the steak frites while I had the porkchop. The steak was amazing and the meat was cooked perfectly! Tender, juicy and every bite was super tasty. The fries that came with it were amazing. It was weird but good. The aoili was like a mustard grain aioli. Now, Ian doesn't like mustard but according to him he could barely taste the mustard in the sauce so he kept dipping. The porkchop I got was huge and tasted amazing. It was also cooked perfectly and juicy. It was in a very thick slice but it was surprisingly moist and juicy inside. The broccolini and the puree that came with it was the perfect combination.This place overall is highly recommendable and can't wait to come back to try the other foods they offer."], ["Adam G.", "I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to be the man that walked 1000 miles for the steak frites with foie butter and shallots at The Smoking Goat.

The atmosphere is alive, the French-inspired food is executed well. I'll definitely be back."], ["Jorgeanne C.", "Came here with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. \u00a0Crowd favorite of the night was the pork belly. You must order this. \u00a0And make sure to call ahead if they aren't out of it prior to dining as some reviewers say it goes quickly. It's the largest pork belly I've seen served in a restaurant. \u00a0And while it is large in size it is still so tender. No need for a knife here folks. Another favorite was escargot au gratin. \u00a0What?? Snails? What? Yes, its delicious and when cooked and drenched in butter and garlic and eaten with buttery toast what's not to like? Order it.I'm giving the Smoking Goat only four stars because 1) their duck truffle fries weren't as heavenly delicious as other reviewers painted them to be; 2) their meatballs were nothing to write about even though our server said they were the favorite; and 3) their ribeye steak was still a bit tough."], ["laura l.", "Seriously, A+ for customer service. The delicious food has been no secret...but this place went above and beyond and inspired me to write a review. Their chocolate cremeux dessert is the best thing I have eaten in San Diego, hands down. When I first had it in December, it was served in a terrine with these fantastic cookies that are shaped like squiggly icicles and taste like a sugar cookie and a biscotti had a baby, only it was crunchy. Then, for reasons I cannot understand (nothing short of \"they made it illegal for a dessert to taste that good and the only person who knew how to make them is currently in jail\" would make sense to me), they replaced the cookies with some nondescript wafery substitute that - I'm sorry, I'm just being honest here - would definitely be the last cookie picked for the team in elementary school cookie recess. It's just sad. So I'm somehow having an in-depth conversation with the bartender, who is relatively new to the place, and who had never experienced the original cookie masterpiece. I show him a photo (which was posted to Facebook that night in December as \"the best thing I ever ate\"). He takes it upon himself to fetch from the kitchen the executive chef, who was, in fact, not currently in jail. I share my opinion of the two cookies and their respective roles in my dessert entendre. He promises me on the spot to bake a batch of the December cookies that night for me to pick up the next day. Which he did. And I did. And they are just as I remember them, only sweeter because they were made specifically for me. And the sous chef who gave them to me told me they are considering bringing them back to their rightful role as bride to the chocolate cremeux groom. If they do...you are all welcome. In any case, I am one impressed, appreciative, sweet tooth-sated fan of The Smoking Goat and I think you should all go there right now and get yourself some chocolate cremeux."], ["Maria C.", "Our friends swear by this place and it didn't disappoint.

MMM... The escargots were covered with garlic and herb butter... MORE PLEASE!!! Mac and cheese as well as a pear and blue cheese salad. Very well thought out appys and they were really tasty.We also ordered 4 entrees to share: Braised short ribs, Stuffed banderra quail, Ribeye, and Mary's crispy chicken. I had a taste of each entree and they were very good. The quail was excellent. We then ordered dessert to share. Beignets with sugar and cinnamon and the Half baked Chocolate Cake with Caramel and Ice Cream. Simply delicious.

They were able to seat us right away, to our suprise, at bar seating they have facing the kitchen. \u00a0Which I was a huge fan of, since my idea of people watching is snooping on what the neighboring tables have ordered and if they seem to enjoy it. To start we ordered the Duck Fat Truffle Fries, which I mean anything fried in duck fat is amazing so no suprise there. & the French Onion Soup... which was spot on! Nailed it! For entrees we both had the Ribeye steak... it was HUGE and delicious. Overall the dining experience was lovely. Our server was solid and the FOH Manager is a babe with awesome hair that she evidently cuts herself. Like a boss! It was good... for its price it was a bit much.

All the dishes were served relatively quickly and piping hot. I loved the Duck Fat Truffle Fries and the mustard aioli that went with it. The fries were so crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. I opted for the Short Ribs for dinner and I was so glad I did, the ribs were so tender and the red wine sauce was delicious, I finished my plate clean! My boyfriend loved his Ribeye, he said it was cooked perfectly and he also joined the clean-plate club! For dessert the waiter recommended the Griddled Banana Bread, and I'm so glad we went with his suggestion! It was so amazing, definitely recommend!

Service was friendly throughout our entire experience, and the intimate ambience made for a perfect date night.For starters, we ordered the duck fat truffle fries and escargot. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy--there's a reason why everyone goes crazy over these! The escargot was bathing in butter and incredibly full-flavored. It came with a very generous amount of toasted, buttered bread as well.The boyfriend ordered the 10oz ribeye (an extra $5 for restaurant week), and I ordered the duck breast. The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and came with a side of mashed potatoes and salad. It was well seasoned and the flavor of the grill really came through. As for the duck breast, it was basically love at first bite. Cooked beautifully with the skin and fat still intact, I couldn't complain. If anything, I would've wanted more of the butternut squash puree! The brussel sprouts paired perfectly with the rest of the dish, offering a nice contrast to all of the savory flavors.As if our bellies weren't full enough, we continued on with dessert. I had the goat cheese cheesecake, which was delicate but tasted simply delicious. The boyfriend had the chocolate bread pudding with ice cream, which was very rich and decadent.All in all, it was a well rounded meal, accompanied by a glass of beer each and I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here if given the opportunity."], ["Dan G.", "Five stars in every category. The food is unique and delicious. The wine list offers something for every plate. The service was friendly and efficient. Overall, a dead bang winner."], ["Shannon K.", "Let me just say upfront that I truly enjoyed everything about my dining experience - food, service, and ambiance were all on point. Minus a star ONLY because it was restaurant week and it's hard to judge places based on a pre-fixe menu.I tried to make a reservation via Open Table ahead of time, but even as a solo diner I was only getting the options of 5pm or 8:45pm and that just wasn't working for me. But I called the day of and was told that seats at the bar were first come first served and that suited me perfectly.Apparently, as per multiple reviewers, it's the thing to do to walk or drive by The Smoking Goat for years, wanting to remember to try it out, but for some reason still taking forever to finally go in. I've lived in North Park for almost three years, have had TSG on my to-try list for about as long, and figured restaurant week was as good an excuse as any to try it.The decor was rustic farmhouse feeling. Dim lighting, dark woods, exposed brick and ceiling rafters, open kitchen. Would definitely make for a good date spot.$35 for three courses during restaurant week (expanded through Oct 3, 2014, btw). I chose the escargot au gratin in garlic herb butter. I detected fennel which I love and was using the bread to sop up all the extra goodness. My entree was the duck breast with butternut squash puree and roasted Brussels sprouts. The duck was cooked perfectly medium rare and was amazingly tender. Dessert was goat cheese cheesecake with vanilla poached nectarines and fresh whipped cream. The slightly less sweet goat cheese played really well with the fruit and it was probably my favorite dessert in recent memory.The bartender who took care of me was Lisa and she got the right mixture of attentive and friendly without being overbearing down pat. I asked her about happy hour specials and they include $3 beer, $4 wine, and $6 appetizers (including the half-pound burger!) from 5-6:30pm Tuesday through Friday (they're closed on Mondays except during restaurant week).

Originally was supposed to take all my cousins here, but I forgot to make reservations hahaha ^__^;; tried again for another week with just one cousin and surprisingly, there were many open tables. No idea where everyone went. Anyway.. arrived 30 mins early and we were seated immediately. First of all, I'd like to mention that it was very warm in the restaurant. We were seated by a window, which contributed to the temperature. Most restaurants are generally on the cooler side. Really wish they had fans or something going. Maybe just poor ventilation? Who knows. That was the only thing I thought was worth mentioning when considering eating here. The d\u00e9cor is interesting, very rustic. I rather enjoyed the atmosphere. It's not too romantic, but still probably a good date place. \u00a0Don't sit on the turf bench at the entrance! It hurts. Are you even supposed to sit on there? I don't know. I did anyway. I like the theme. FOOD - We started with the truffle fries and mac n cheese. The truffle fries were good - thick cut and topped with parsley and parmesan. I didn't really taste the truffle, kind of overpowered by the amount of cheese on top. Super filling though so we only got through about 1/3 of it. Mac n cheese was so-so. Very bland. I ordered the free range lamb pasta - basically pulled lamb and gnocchi. Pretty salty, didn't really enjoy it that much. The gnocchi was on the soggier side whereas most restaurants will prepare it so it's still chewyish. My cousin got the tomato risotto. Not sure if she liked it since we were full off of appetizers. She didn't rave about it or push me to try it like she usually does though so I'll take that a sign she didn't really like it. The orange honey wheat beer was delicious though! SERVICE - Great service. We were checked up on a good number of times. Everyone was friendly.Overall, not sure if I'd come back here just based on the food. Our bill came out to $80-something. I'm not complaining about the prices since I know what I was getting myself into, I just think I can find better food elsewhere for the same amount."], ["Darlene B.", "I've had The Smoking Goat on my list for a long time. I did NOT make reservations. I did a walk-in for 2 when I found out the Underbelly across the street wasn't open yet. It's hard to tell who's working and who's walking around, because check-in was right next to the bar, lots of people standing. The bartender said \"Someone will be right with you...\" Once someone approached us, I asked if she had any tables for 2 and she gave us 2 options, a barstool area near the kitchen, or a table near the entrance. I said, \"Can we see the menu and then decide?\" She said \"Sure\"...so i saw the menu and decided!...waited for her to come back, she circles around and asks \"Have you been helped?\" and I was like \"Uhh yeah, you said we could have that table right there...\" and she said \"Ohhh that's right...yeah, you can sit there\" Really weird...seemed busy so I can tell she was frazzled. Started with drinks -- I ordered the Goatlet, the description was very mojito-like...when I sipped, I loved the citrus taste. The menu is a little on the pricier side, but I could NOT pass up on ordering the steak ($30...eek). So i ordered the steak, medium. She later provided a steak knife. The food came out more quickly than expected. The sides included a small salad and truffle fries. The truffle fries are absolutely mouth watering, and I could've done without the salad...i was too full to finish it anyway. The steak was cooked perfectly, the knife cut through like butter. The piece melted in my mouth. I love it when steak is made so well, easy to devour. I'm sooo glad I came by and had the opportunity to dine here. I'm super thankful that they could accommodate us without any reservations.

I've always known the ambiance was nice and slightly upper scale for the area so this makes for a good date spot. Service was great. Our server made us feel welcome and was attentive.Ugh!! You know what.....Forget all the repetitive details! Let's get to the basics. Yes, the duck fat truffle fries are as good as they say they are. The Pork belly app sitting on gouda grits.....well its friggin Gouda! Get it. Maine diver scallops were large and absolutely perfect. Enjoying all these tasty treats while sipping on a yummy Pinot Noir was the making of a great dining experience. Ok honestly I know absolutely nothing about wine except that I like Pinot Noir and that this was a good one :) Now for the reason I'm deducting 1 star. Up until I received my entree this was hands down a 5 star experience. Me wanting to be \"different\" and not taking my fellow Yelpers advice. I didn't order the pork chop that everyone raves about. I decided to get the 10oz ribeye. Why?! Because I'm red meat eating steak kind of guy. Presentation was great, truffle fries were bomb, first cut looked promising and medium rare just the way I ordered it. Unfortunately this ribeye was extremely chewy. Not what I'm used to when ordering a $30 10oz cut of ribeye. I was expecting melt in your mouth goodness which it was not. Instead I spent the rest of the meal working out my jaw muscles. Maybe it serves me right for ordering a steak at a French restaurant. Yes I was disappointed in my entree but the appetizers and service really made up for it. Would I go back? Yes and order the pork chop. Moral of the story....listen to your fellow Yelpers.Cheers!"], ["Aaron S.", "We came here around 6pm on a Saturday, and it was surprisingly empty. The staff greeted us warmly once we arrived. The restaurant had a relaxing, hipster, and trendy atmosphere. I always find myself dining at hipster restaurants. There are only a few beers on tap, but they have a lengthy wine list. It is an ideal place to eat some dinner with a glass of wine. The Smoking Goat seems like a better place to take a date than to hangout with a group of friends, unless you guys love drinking wine. After glancing through the menu, we decided to order the Duckfat Truffle Fries, Tomato Risotto, and Brined Pork Chop. Duckfat Truffle Fries: THE BEST FRIES I'VE EVER HAD! The outside was crisp, while the center was still soft and fluffy. The texture was perfect, and it was seasoned well. The mustard aioli accompanying the fries made it much more pleasant. They could've made a menu based on their Duckfat Fries - carne asada on top of the fries, chilli cheese on the fries, different dipping sauces w/ the fries, etc. Tomato Risotto: I didn't really like this dish. I usually get an order of risotto whenever I see it at a restaurant, but we shouldn't have gotten it here. It had too many chives on top that we had to remove it...it looked like a patch of grass on top of rice. The risotto was too soggy for my liking. However, you may love this dish if you're a vegetarian because it has tempeh instead of meat. Brined Pork Chop: a thick cut of porkchop that was cooked perfectly. The meat was charred well outside, and the middle was still moist and juicy. The smoky tomato sauce tasted more like BBQ sauce. I didn't really like the sauce with the porkchop, so I used it with the string beans and potatoes. Overall, the food was pretty good, but not tastebud-exploding. However, the Duckfat Fries were amazing! I would recommend everyone to get their own plate. The fries was practically our main dish, because we were so stuffed that we couldn't finish half of our entree. The service was very attentive and checked to see if our glasses were full and made sure our meal was going well. I would come back here again...maybe I'll get two plates of fries for myself."], ["Diana S.", "Best birthday dinner ever. Opened in 2010 the Smoking Goat...oh I don't know the history but I know that it was hella good. Every bite was a new experience and I couldn't stop eating after I was full. uh..and this is why I gain weight. My bestie and bridesmaid wanted to treat me out for dinner and she picked this place to splurge on me. I have awesome friends. We enjoyed their happy hour which were pretty good sized plates: Duckfat Truffle Fries and Tartiflette (Brie cheese with fingerling potato's in it!) oh it was a cheesy carb overload to start but worth the lactose rage quit. The fries were to my expectations, skinny, crispy and had a that great crunch but fluffiness inside. It was rich in flavor that the aioli sauce that accompanied it wasn't necessary. We even married the duck fries with the brie to even have a bigger explosion of flavors! The tartiflette (brie) was melted and so savory and buttery. The bread that came with it was nicely oiled and grilled to have this tasty char on it. I could of just ate the bread alone. My friend ordered the Pork Chop and while I was stuck between the Pork Belly or Tomato Risotto and well, they were out of Pork belly. That means more room for dessert! I'm glad I got the Risotto because it was creamy and dreamy. Every bite was different...garlic, tomato, cheese, and other tasty pieces. Sad enough, within 2 mins of being served, a stupid fly nosed dived right into it! EWWWW!! ( That what we get for sitting outside) The waitress was so nice to take it back and get a whole new plate for me. To top the night off we ordered the infamous Griddled Banana Bread. *heavy breathing* this dessert is deceivingly good.

We were seated promptly at 7:30 as our reservation had stated.We came specifically for their Restaurant Week menu and they offered just about their entire menu. After wanting everything, I settled on their Beet Salad, Duck and of course their 'Goat's Cheese' Cheesecake.Beet Salad: Atop the beets was arugula and romaine that were tossed lightly in a champagne vinaigrette. The beets were perfect and were accompanied by walnuts and the best damn chevre I have ever tasted. Even my friend hoarded the cheese pieces and he's not normally a fan. Let's just say he's another one I'll get rid of. No one gets between my cheese and I. No one.Duck: This was suggested by the waiter since I was debating on this and the Porchetta. With wide eyes he immediately said the duck so I couldn't resist. What an absolutely amazing choice he helped me make. The duck was cooked medium well and perfect. Cut so well and had just the right amount of fat on it. Cherries surrounded it and turnips, farro and vegetables accompanied as well. It was atop what I believe was a cherry balsamic reduction. I'll say it again... perfection. I paired my entree with a glass of Moulin de Ferrand which was a glass of Sauvignon Blanc/Semillon. An absolute treat.Lastly, and the main event in my eyes...Goat's Cheese Cheesecake: the Smoking Goat took my virginity on this one and I'm oh so glad they did. I cut into it and melted just as quickly as the cheesecake did in my mouth. The pairing of the peach glaze was the cherry on top. I don't know how they could make it any better. Enjoy!I really don't know how they could make anything better than they did. Service was just as outstanding as the food. I can most definitely see this being in my top list of great restaurants in San Diego."], ["Cynthia D.", "Excellent service and delicious food. \u00a0Had the salmon, and it was prepared to perfection. \u00a0I got to taste the pork belly as well, and it was amazing!!! Especially liked the friendly, unpretentious service. \u00a0Highly recommend. \u00a0FYI this establishment is dog-friendly. \u00a0The patio area, where I assume people with fur babies would be seated, is covered and enclosed, so you won't freeze on a chilly night.y"], ["Mike P.", "The Smoking Goat, located in North Park, is one of my favorite spots in San Diego. Local, organic, sustainable, community and family-owned; this is not just chatter from The Smoking Goat. It lives and breathes these words and you can taste these values with every bite. The Smoking Goat and Executive Chef Fred Piehl craft flavors so elegantly that every time you visit is a totally different experience.The first thing you notice as you walk up to the restaurant is the large sign portraying a goat greeting you from above. The rustic d\u00e9cor really makes you feel at home. There are a couple of different areas for seating depending on your mood or the size of your party. There is outdoor seating, but the night we dropped by it was actually drizzling rain... what are the odds?We started off with a couple of Rusty Kids: Carpano Antica, fresh OJ and bitters. This was a very good start to a great night. We asked Chef Piehl for his selection of dishes and wine pairings. This is what we usually do to get the best experience.We started the meal off with the House-Cured Scottish Salmon, consisted of a tempting combination of wild arugula, fennel, citrus, basil, mint and olive oil. The salmon was unbelievable; it just melted in your mouth.Next up was the House-Made Butternut Squash Ravioli, a delightful dish made with kale, butter and sage.And, finally, we got to sample the Tartiflette, a wonderful mixture of Brie and Taleggio cheese, onions, bacon lardons, potatoes, and ciabatta. The blend of cheeses with the onion and bacon gave it that savory flavor and creamy aroma you expect in such a dish. Take a look at the photography and see for yourself. I highly recommend all three appetizers as I can't pick one over the other.We then ordered a couple of salads to share. The Beet Salad is a colorful medley of mixed lettuces, walnuts, and goat cheese. But my favorite, no doubt due to my addiction to blue cheese, was the Pear and Blue Cheese Salad; delectable poached and raw pears topped with pistachio pesto and drizzled in champagne vinaigrette. Such vibrant flavors from a salad; I loved it!Now it was time for the entrees, as if our starters weren't enough. We shared the 10-oz Harris Ranch California Ribeye: a tender steak, cooked to perfection, served with herb butter and red wine sauce, duck fat truffle fries, and salad on the side. I sincerely love my steaks and this one was right up there with the best. It took everything I had not to eat the whole thing. However, my mother taught me better and that was a great lesson learned, because our other entr\u00e9e was the Porchetta. This delicious dish consisted of slow-cooked pork belly, cheesy polenta, upland cress, goathorn pepper relish, roasted tomatoes, and chickpeas. If you haven't experienced Porchetta, you must take a stab at it on your next date night.Of course, dessert cannot be dismissed, and it most certainly was not. We enjoyed the Griddled Banana Bread, a taste sensation which took me back to when I was growing up and my mother would bake it for a special holiday breakfast. It was accompanied by Bananas Foster and vanilla ice cream.As if one dessert wasn't enough, I had to try the \"Goat Cheese\" Cheesecake, a decadently-rich dessert cake topped with vanilla-poached nectarines and whipped cream. Both desserts were out-of-this-world delicious! You should definitely pick at least one to share.What a beautiful evening, once again, and it was a shame it had to end. A great meal is always more than a dinner; it's an experience you can get lost in. Well, back to reality and a very full drive back home to La Jolla... until next time Chef!"], ["Kari S.", "Wow, just wow! That is probably the only way to describe my little adventure to the Smoking Goat on Sunday. I was taken by a date here and can't speak highly enough of this establishment after that night. First thing first, we sat out side on the patio. The day was warm so I could totally see why the choice to dine outside was made. Only bad part is the building across the street radiates heat and may make you go blind if the sun hasn't gone down yet. another side note, it is really noisy since the Smoking Goat is right near the intersection of Upas and 30th street. Choose to sit inside if you want to be able to hear what other people are saying. Service was exceptional! Lisa was our main woman for the evening and was on point with all of her recommendations and super friendly. At one point we got to the selection of a main course. Lisa suggested the chicken, something I wouldn't normally order when dinning out, but it was truly amazing. My date and I decided to go on the lighter route. Order two appetizers to split : Tartiflette and the Scottish Salmon which were both flavorful and delicious. Of course, the chicken and finished the meal off with the goat cheese cheesecake. I'm pretty sure i could eat that cheesecake for eternity but then i would be extremely overweight. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back in the future."], ["Kristen H.", "We just finished our Saturday night date night. \u00a0We were not impressed. \u00a0This was our second time here and the last time we'll come here.

All well done. The Chardonnay servings were just right and sealed an all around 360 good experience.On the way out we also had the pleasure of striking a quick complements-to-the-Chef chat with Chef Piehl and staff. \u00a0Nice crew.There is no billy goat curse at the SMOKING GOAT - au contraire, this neat bistro knows how to put it on, A-Z.5 thumbs up."]], "Opera Cafe & Patisserie": [["Adrienne K.", "I LOVE this place!

They have a fabulous menu with lots to choose from. There hours are very limited, which makes it difficult to come here if you don't work near by. We all took the day off work in celebration of my birthday and sadly, Opera did not live up to the expectation that was set.During lunch hours, the strip mall is packed so parking is tight. The line was wrapped around the tables inside and it was SO loud inside. There is no way I could enjoy a meal inside. It had a food court kind of feel. The outside patio is great, lots of shade and we were very lucky to snag a table. The young ladies that were working the front were very friendly, and bring your food to your table once it's prepared. They were very busy around 12:30pm but then it quieted down significantly around 1pm. I think the popularity revolves around all the near by businesses.Everyone enjoyed there sandwiches, truffle fries and regular fries. Truffle fries were yummy, but I think overrated. You could clearly tell that the quality of the ingredients was good. My mission was desserts!! We ordered several and two were good. The salted Carmel flourless chocolate cake was my favorite...served warm and very fluffy.

They've done their best considering it is in a cookie-cutter strip mall (something San Diego has no lack of ... blame city planning for that though).Food is good and the pastries and cakes are wonderful. We came for brunch and I had the quiche and my wife had the eggs bene. Both were pretty good. Next time I'd like to come for the Croque Monsieur and other bistro fare at lunch.I'd give them 5 stars but in all honesty since they are a \"Caf\u00e9\" I have to rate them on the quality of the coffee which still has room for improvement (unless you like it weak)."], ["Khrysten T.", "Eh...

Now, as a lot of the other reviewers stated, parking is very difficult at lunch time, but if you're patient and lucky, you might be able to snag a spot in the crowded parking lot. The south west corner is usually pretty calm.You have to order at the counter, so sometimes you're greeted by a long line when you first walked in. We came around 12:05pm today, but we got pretty lucky and the line was only halfway across the side wall. However, once we had ordered, the line was starting to back up against the front door. I suggest ordering everything you want at once since you'll have to wait in line again if you want anything else.Salmon Tartine. I normally go for the Chicken Pesto Sandwich, but my coworker highly recommended the Salmon Tartine. Since I was looking for something different, I decided to try it out. It comes with their standard side salad, which is always good, and the tartine was good as well. It's a thin piece of flatbread topped with guacamole, olive oil, salmon, tomatoes, capers, and olives. The salmon was a little fishy for me, but the combination was definitely unique. The capers and tomatoes gave the salmon a nice contrast and the guacamole made the overall dish more savory. All of the toppings made the bread a little too soggy for my liking, but the parts that weren't soggy tasted very good.Although I didn't get any pastries this time, I highly recommend the Almond Croissant or the Opera Cake. I've had those in the past, and those are always a great hit. Their specials menu is always a good try as well. There was a seafood risotto that I've had before which was very rich.Overall Opera Cafe is good for lunch and great for pastries. If I had a car while at work, I might go more often (if not for food, but for dessert). Unfortunately (or fortunately for my waistline) it's definitely not walkable, so it's more of a special events restaurant for me."], ["Nory B.", "Usually come here for breakfast, especially on Saturday because they're close by and not crowded early.Service is always friendly and quick.Food is consistently good--I really like the CA eggs Benedict with avocado and tomato, but I customize it by adding spinach and having only egg whites, scrambled, instead of the poached egg.

I've come a few times during lunch, but first time for breakfast. Coming early so awesome. The parking lot barely had cars and there was no line inside. Was torn between the omelet and the French toast, but since a friend got the French toast, I went with the omelet.There are 3 things you can have in the omelet, so I went with spinach, tomatoes, and bacon. The omelet comes with a side salad and potatoes. The potatoes were roasted and seasoned I think with parmesan cheese. It was a bit weird for me to have a salad for breakfast, so I didn't really eat it. The omelet was good and pretty filling. I probably did not get hungry again till 4 pm, so it sticks with you. The potatoes were crispy and good. I tried the French toast and wasn't a big fan of it, so glad I got the omelet. I like my french toast to be crisp on the outside. This wasn't crisp and the inside was almost mooshy, it was fully cook but a lil too soft. Four small pieces come with the dish and they have powdered sugar on top. Pieces of strawberries were laid out along the plate. My friend got two mini cupcakes to go and I got the almond croissant. This would be my third almond croissant from here and they have all been different. One had quite a bit of powdered sugar on top, while the others barely had any. Almond filling and amount of filling has varied everything too. All the differences are noticeable since I've had the 3 in the past couple months, but still good.

When I asked them if I could trade it out for a different side dish they said they could if I paid for it, which was kind of a let down because I didn't even know the sandwich came with a side. My bill came out to $11.80 for something that should be a third of the price. My ideology about food is, it's worth the splurge if the taste pays for itself. But today, I regretted ever stepping foot in there. This is one of the places I'll be putting in the dark crevices of my mind to be repressed.

It is like a mini-fresh flatbread with ahi and avocado--healthy and filling.The desserts are ADORABLE and to die for.

If you're eating at the restaurant, they'll give you a numbers so waiters will bring out the food to your table, but that's as far as the service goes. You have to get your own drinks, sauces, utensils, etc. During the weekdays, avoid going at noon because there is a HUGE lunch crowd coming in to get food at that time. Either show up about 5-10 minutes before noon or just go around 12:40, otherwise you'll be stuck in a really long line.Parking is really horrible here. There are so many stores in this tiny little plaza. You can try driving all the way to the back behind the parking structure. There's a parking area back there. There were a lot of spots back there when I went, but everyone seemed to be fighting over the spots in front of the plaza."], ["Kimby C.", "The desserts here are to die for.

It was a special. And delicious. I cleaned out the bowl. I am super excited to try their Ahi Tuna Tartine. I saw it on a bunch of people's plates, and it looked marvelous. Also, their desserts looked worthy of being my diet mistress. Service was spectacular. Even though it was \u00a0really busy, we got our food quickly from such polite and full-of-smiles workers.

Not a typical American hot ham and cheese at all. \u00a0The secret is the bechamel sauce! Side salad was nice too.

They cook with a canola/olive oil blend, so it's somewhat healthy too! Next time, I plan to try their gluten free bread. If you're in need of a swift kick in the you know where on a Monday morning before work, the lattes they serve here are much more tasty than the place across the street with the green sign, and it'll get the job done. \u00a0Oh and the pastries... don't even get me started.

I had scallops in every bite, they were definitely not shy with it. The crepe was a bit soggy by the time it got to me, but the tender scallops and thinly shredded leeks mixed into a creamy sauce made up for it. As for my fave part of the meal... Dessert!

Also if you want to say order their Tiramisu but want to make sure they make a good tiramisu, you would want to purchase a pastry size to taste it but they will tell you that the pastry will be different from the cake.

It's no surprise they've garnered such a strong following. I met two people during my visit that professed there weekly devotion for both brunch and lunch at this hidden gem. Both were fans of the Pear Blue Cheese Salad (served with \"fresh Sliced Anjou Pear, Crumbled Blue Cheese, Spicy Caramelized Walnuts, Dried Cranberries, & Cherry Tomatoes). Apparently, adding chicken makes it even more delicious and hearty!The friendly cashier recommended that I try the Tasted Goat Cheese & Bacon (Served with Goat Cheese, Bacon, Avocado, & Cherry Tomatoes). Just when I was ordering, a huge piece of the Quiche Lorraine passed me by - me oh my. I just had to have it! But, I was now in a tissy because I wanted both the Goat Cheese & Bacon Salad (only $6.55 for a half size portion) and the Quiche Lorraine. Yet again, the friendly cashier was out to satisfy. She let me order the Quiche Lorraine and upgrade my side salad to the Goat Cheese & Bacon Salad for a nominal fee - SOLD! I'm a softy for places that exemplify awesome customer service. Opera Cafe has definitely won my heart.Amongst my group, we ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict special, the crab cake eggs Benedict doe vial, the quiche Lorraine, and the goat cheese & avocado salad.

The first time I came here I had the Eggs Benedict Smoked Salmon which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes and it was incredible. Huge portions (I couldn't finish) along with fresh fruit and potatoes. I also got two almond croissants to go which were heavenly.

(yelp.com/biz_photos/oper\u2026) The bennies were quite good. The Hollandaise was very creamy, well seasoned, and flavored with a bit of lemon. (yelp.com/biz_photos/oper\u2026) The eggs were poached a little under than what I requested, medium, but they were still good. (yelp.com/biz_photos/oper\u2026) The crab cakes had a mild flavor. The cake was crusty on the outside and very soft in the interior. Also, there was a good about of tasty crab meat (yelp.com/biz_photos/oper\u2026). They do not use the traditional English Muffin on bottom, but rather a savory biscuit, that not only brought great flavor to the bennies, but also a nice dense and moist texture.

We RSVP'd for dinnertime on Wednesday, but it wasn't necessary as there was no wait when we arrived. The host gave us the option to sit at a larger 4 top, instead of 2, because there were quite a few open tables.La Bastide Bistro has nice decor, calm music, a nice casual vibe. The lighting inside is a bit dark, so bring your glasses if ya need!Outside seating is available for for larger parties, and I would say is suitable for families/groups of 6-8.Appetizers:- Crab Cake | Cajun Remoulade | Spicy Slaw: This crab cake/salad felt Asian inspired and was topped with tasty, flavorful sauces. There are a liberal amount of jalapenos sprinkled throughout the slaw, so be careful if you can't take spicy!- Warm Goat Cheese Crouton |Drizzled with Lavender Honey |Candied Walnuts | Mixed Greens | Apple | Bacon | Mushrooms |Truffle Vinaigrette: I had a little bite of this. Thecrouton with apple was a nice combination for me. Something that I disliked was that the bacon on the salad wasn't really crunchy or crispy. It was on the chewier side, like beef jerky.After finishing our apps, the bread and herbed butter came out. I think this was probably supposed to arrive first..Main Course:- Skuna Bay Salmon Papillote | Julienne of Carrots | Fennel | Leeks | Tomato | Broccolini with Saffron Potatoes : This dish did not come with tomato or broccolini and instead had zucchini and yellow squash. I didn't really mind but it was a bit vexing that they would substitute ingredients without letting customers know. Additionally, the salmon arrived room temp warm, not hot. Salmon is one of my favorite fish, so I still enjoyed the fish. However, others may not have liked their meal at this temperature. The sauce in the papillote with the salmon tasted great! Mashed potatoes were a tad dry but I dipped them in the salmon sauce to remedy this.- Duck Confit | Orange Sauce | Fries | Salad: I understand duck confit is supposed to be salty, considering it is cured in salt, but it was too salty for our tastes. My friend said the duck was nice and tender so that's a plus. She also mentioned the salad may have been the same as the goat cheese salad (but without the goat cheese).Dessert: The highlight!!!- Traditional Chocolate Mousse | Orange Madeleine: The mousse had a warm madeline cookie on top. Tasted great to dip in the mousse. It was also topped with vanilla whipped cream, which unfortunately felt more like a light pudding.- Citrus and Lavender Cr\u00e8me Brulee - This dessert was so good!! The creme brulee had just enough hints of lavender without having so much that it tasted like Bed Bath and Beyond. Great crispy brown top without being overly burnt or charred.It was an overall nice experience. I would come again, maybe for a date night.

The outside patio was lovely with nice potted flowers. It was nice out so we chose to sit outside. The restaurant is next door to a taco shop and a grocery store therefore it takes away from the intimate feel right away. I did not love the food it definately did not match the price. The happy hour was reasonable. The waiter was great and very attentive although he went oh his lunch break half way through the meal.

No substitute, they would not honor their Monday night special of 1/2 off select wine bottles. I went to the bar to speak privately with the waitress and asked to speak with the manager.

I had some left over to bring into work the next day and it was just as good. I couldn't taste the \"vanilla\", which is fine with me. I prefer creamy, savory risottos.x Smoked Salmon and Shrimp Linguine in a Cream Dill Sauce: must I say more? The plate was huge too! I was barely able to finish half of my entree. x Creme Brulee: very popular dessert and I can see why! My friend ordered the fruit crepe and it turned out to be very sour. If you like sour, this is for you. I ordered the panna cotta dessert, which came with a raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was refreshing and light! The panna cotta, however, was okay: 3/5. I preferred my friends' creme brulees. It was a bit hard to find because the sign was small. Look for Vons and La Bastide is residing right next door to the left.

Upscale, dim lighting, and just very neat and clean. The waiter was extremely friendly and the service was phenomenal. I'm not sure if this place ever really gets packed but I definitely will be back. Especially for the lobster!I got the halibut penne pasta with sundried tomatoes. My mom got the salmon salad.

I sent it back and he made a big deal about the fact that he took it off of our bill. No kidding, I could have been very sick if I'd eaten it! The meal was just so-so. My Duck Confit was skimpy on the duck with limp, cold french fries. Again, I said repeatedly no onion, no garlic, and the waiter said that the salad dressing was only balsalmic vinegar and olive oil. I tasted a bit of it and guess what? It had garlic! He then brought olive oil and lemons as requested and stayed away from our table the rest of the evening after I explicitly told him that he needed to be more careful when customers told him about food allergies.

The raviolis were scrumptious and less doughy than you often find and the herb sauce was flavorful and relatively light. The portion size was more than ample (don't you just hate spending big bucks in a high end restaurant and leaving hungry?) and my server Socorro did a great job."], ["CassieRenee R.", "Rode my bike and decided to stop for a beer, had the \u00a0Duvel on draft delish.

There was always fresh baked bread on the table, our wine glasses were continually topped off, water glasses were always full, plates were served piping hot and were cleared promptly when we were done.

I got the pork chops (something I usually don't like to order since it's so easy to make at home), and it was so good paired with a fig/berry reduction/glaze and mashed potatoes.

Our server was lovely. Our drinks were good, and happy hour prices are good. Those things were like 4-5 stars.But the food? We were surprised to find that we did not like anything. The crab cakes were downright not good--I was shocked. I have eaten a lot of crab cakes in my day, and these were so oddly-flavored that we didn't even finish them! (there are 3 in each order). The open-faced hamburger came with fries that were slightly under-done. The bread was dry, the cheese was not noticeable (flavor-wise) and even the grilled onions didn't help. The tasty aioli was the saving grace. I didn't finish it. It wasn't awful, but just didn't live up to the expectations of a $19 dish (although it was 50% off during happy hour!)My eating partners tried two varieties of mussels (one mustard, the other--I forgot) and they were also disappointed.Perhaps we ordered poorly, because the last time I was here a few years ago, we had a great experience."], ["A R.", "Party of 6, \u00a0on a Saturday.Like...Good service.Planche, boeuf bourguignon, bread & mussels were greatSo-so...Onion soup was luke warm, ask for it hot.New York steak wasnt the best..."], ["Ellen S.", "Having lived in the Marseille area I was excited to have the Bouillabaisse for Bonne fete Nationale otherwise known as Bastille day. I called on Monday and left a message for a reservation, got a call back and confirmed date and time. Upon arrival no reservation. They seated us for an early 6pm dinner at a table where the top wobbled. There were plenty of other tables available. As a restauranteur this table should not have been on the floor. Period.We ordered the $50 per person Prix fixe Bastille Day menu and had the tomato, escarole, burrata salad. It had a basil puree on the base which was fresh and tasty, the tomatoes were pink, sandy and dry. I grow organic food in my yard so this was particularly disappointing in July in San Diego where fresh ripe tomatoes abound. Next we waited and waited for the Bouillabaisse and it arrived without a soup spoon and yet in a wide flat bowl. In Marseille one is shown the fresh whole fishes prior to creation for approval. One type of fish in a few chunks, some over cooked shrimp and 2 clams (one which was only an empty shell) and mussels in a good broth. It was not what I was hoping for but for someone not accustomed to real French food I am sure it was fine. My brother enjoyed the soup. The pot au chocolat was served chilled and therefore not the delicate treat it is supposed to be near room temperature with a dollop of ordinary whipped cream and again was a dessert one would expect in a mid-range American restaurant. It had cherries in the bottom? The one redeeming feature was a very nice waiter. I am certain the chefs have never set foot on French soil and perhaps the servers could be taught to pronounce the French words properly...it is a pretend French restaurant. I believe eating French cuisine outside of France is like eating the paper around a fresh baguette and calling it the bread. There was no decor celebrating the most important holiday in France nor even any mention of the day other than the overpriced menu.Overall for the money it was disappointing to say the least."], ["Jeff A.", "The food here is unbelievably good.

I had extremely high expectations for the food but honestly, I'm so so sorry to say that I wasn't impressed. My boyfriend's meat plate was \u00a0about 10 extremely thin slices of meat and the tiniest pickled vegetables I've ever seen. My French onion soup was pretty good but also pretty standard. I was hoping for something interesting done with it that made it a menu item, but I could have made the same thing at home. In hindsight, I would have tried the muscles in cream sauce.Onto the main dishes. My boyfriend's salmon was barely visible in the soup of sauce surrounding it. It came out in a huge plate but was really about 4\" X 2\" \u00a0total. It was cooked well, but that was the highlight of the meal. \u00a0My oyster and mushroom ravioli was bland - it looked like Chinese wontons and didn't taste like anything. The dessert was okay - the gingerbread cake was flavorful, but my favorite part of that was the salted caramel ice cream. The bread pudding tasted like fake almonds..I don't know how to describe it. It just tasted artificial, almost plastic-y ):I think what also made this so upsetting for me was that despite it being restaurant week, I still ended up spending over $100 on just the meal - we didn't order wine or anything extra. I was expecting it to be out of this world amazing and to be blown away, especially since I used to live in France and LOVE French food, but it just ended up being a very expensive, sub-par dinner. I'm so sorry to say that ):I need to point out that they were very accommodating, though.

Both dishes were done beautifully and I wish that I had more of the steak!Now here's the kicker to the review, we originally could not decide on a dessert out of the three choices so we told our waiter that we will decide on the dessert after we finished our appetizers and entrees. Instead, Ken Irvine, the head chef decided to bring out all three desserts for us to enjoy and my god... those were all delectable.

Read on for more.Our reservation was early (I think 6:30p). I got there a bit early and the hostess said it will be a few more minutes before our table is ready. We didn't get seated until 6:50p though.The restaurant is dark and intimate. Which made me instantly remember I actually came here, YEARS ago, on a blind date. How the heck did I forget that. Nice guy too...sorry...got side tracked...They sell their glasses of wine by the 1/4 or 1/2 liter. It's served to you in a cute baby pitcher type of thing. My glass of the Vin du Maison Syrah $9.00 was beautiful. We ordered:- Coquilles St. Jacques: sea scallops with wild mushrooms, chervil and white wine sauceThis was my appetizer that I was so looking forward to. The dish tasted a bit lukewarm and the scallops weren't as plump and big as I had hoped for. It almost appeared that they sliced a jumbo scallop in 1/2 to use for this dish (with the second half of the second scallop used for another person's plate). The sauce was nice although I felt the wine tasted a bit too light.- Escargots \u00e0 la Portugais: escargot in red wine with tomatoes, chick peas, lingui\u00e7a sausage, bleu cheese potato croquetteMy friend stabbed an escargot with her fork and handed it to me. I tried to envision it would taste like a clam. But the more I chewed, the more I started to panic b/c it didn't taste like a clam. Like AT ALL. Friend said something that cinched it for me...\" It tastes DURRRTY right...\"It wasn't meant as an insult to dish. Imagine Durrty being said by Christina Aguilera few years ago when she thought she was a bad ass. But friend said it tasted like earth, like dirt, of a snail. And yep, that's pretty much how it tasted. - \u00a0Fl\u00e9tan \"Oscar\" : local halibut saut\u00e9ed with crab, asparagus, tomato salad herb roasted Yukon potatoes and sauce B\u00e9arnaiseBEST dish of the night. The halibut was moist, flaky, seasoned oh-so-perfectly. The crab tasted nice and fresh. - \u00a0Entrec\u00f4te de Porc: honey/curry marinated pork ribeye steak, spinach, bacon pommes pur\u00e9e , fig and port wine pan saucePork was grilled a nice pink medium. I don't remember much of this dish but friend liked it. The sauce was a bit too sweet for me. - Mousse au Chocolat: rich dark chocolate mousse with seasonal red berriesReally liked this dark chocolate dessert. Creamy, light, and not too sweet- \u00a0Profiteroles : choux pastry puffs filled with vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate saucePastry puff wasn't the best but the ice cream topped w/ dark chocolate sauce was deliciousWas this meal worth $45. I wasn't a fan of my appetizer but I enjoyed my entree. I normally wouldn't order dessert but if a friend wants to share a dessert, I won't say no. My fish entree normally is $28.95 on their regular menu. So that leaves me about $16.05 to spend on other items (assuming I had a $45 allowance to start with). I'm not sure if I would spend that $16.05 on an appetizer or dessert though. I think if I had $45 on a normal non-RW week, I'd use the extra funds to upgrade my glass of wine or try another glass of wine.Regardless, their appetizers run between $13.95-18.95 and both our desserts are normally priced at $8.95. So we did indeed get a good deal from the $45 that we spent that night for the 3 courses.Bottom line, you can make out like a bandit on their Restaurant Week deal if you don't order drinks or upgrade any dishes. Otherwise, the $45 (after drinks, tax, gratuity, etc) can easily become $70+/pp.It was a fun night AND, I forgot to mention, that I paralleled park my car in ONE TRY that night !!

On the one hand, service and atmosphere are excellent, I would rate both five stars. On the other hand, the food mostly lacked flavor and I was disappointed in the majority of items that I tried, I would give maybe a 2, 2.5 star rating for food. There was a lot of variety, and while I was very satisfied with the quality of the desserts, it was the high end entree items (mostly seafood) that left me feeling disappointed.I would probably give another star if the price was lowered around $15. This brunch would be reasonable at $37 per person rather than the $52 per person currently charged. Either lower the price or increase the food quality.Pros:--beautifully decorated tables, chandeliers, piano music in the background, food tables are all laid out and organized nicely so that there is little to no wait--more than just champagne is served, you also have the option for a bloody mary or a margarita. I stuck with traditional champagne, and it tasted great--wait staff is attentive and very polite. Our server came in to check on us every 10 min or so, we never felt abandoned :)--food is plentiful and there is a lot of variety, they are very good at refilling empty trays quickly--Dessert is top-notch, loved the crepes!--valet parking is providedCons:--food I tried mostly lacked flavor; the sushi was just okay, sashimi was better. Shark was not very good, I only had a few bites of it. Underwhelmed by the salmon wellington, caviar was so-so, oysters rockefeller did not taste good at all--my boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and did not like it, he ordered a second one and requested that they use regular tomato juice instead of the bloody mary mix. While they did try to honor this request, he still did not like it and could only drink a quarter of it before giving up--Valet parking, while provided, is not included as part of the brunch deal. It cost us $4 for the first 2 hours--We felt that $52 was rather steep for the quality of food; either the price should be lowered or the food should be made to taste betterAll in all, it was a fantastic experience while at the same time a disappointing one. It was good enough, however, that we will likely give them another chance in the future. I will update my review if our second experience fares any better."], ["Garrett B.", "I have loved brunch at the Westgate Hotel for years and have counted on it many times for special occasions. \u00a0In particular, I have appreciated the elegance and refinement that is part of the experience. These are the qualities that set this Brunch apart and which have made it a San Diego institution. Unfortunately, my last two visits have not lived up to the standards that I have come to expect. Most of the food is still great, the mimosas are above average, and the piano is lovely which is why I have given 3-Stars in this review.However, here are the reasons that the experience is not 4 or 5 stars.1) The service was mediocre at best. In my last visit, we sat at the table for 15 minutes before having any contact with a server, we were ignored for long periods of time while plates sat in front of us, we had to constantly ask for water/utensils/coffee, our waiter was no where to be found when we were ready for the check, and once I gave him my credit card he disappeared again.2) The fish for the sushi was just bad, it was clearly not fresh, Further, the attendant serving it, did not appear to know anything about sushi. For instance, he did not know that one of the types of fish he was serving was called hamachi and the sashimi cuts that he was making reminded me of the way that you would chop meat for stew or a saute. 3) The dining room was in disrepair. The sconces on the wall were almost all askew and the chair that my son was sitting in had a broken arm. At one point during the brunch, my son's finger ended up getting pinched between the broken sections of the chair.4) Finally, there were many people in the dining room who were dressed down. They were wearing jeans and casual shirts or sweaters. I don't know what conclusion to draw from this fact. Maybe its just the reality of living in a laid back city like San Diego or maybe it reflects the institution's lost prestige. I don't know.In the end, I will go back and appreciate all that Brunch at the Westgate has been for so many years. But,I will also be on the look out for a new special place that can deliver on the elegance and refinement that I am looking for."], ["Faye L.", "This review is for their Sunday Champagne Brunch...One of the most memorable things a friend once told me was that being a friend (in his circle) meant that I was in their 'flock'. That the way a shepherd takes care of their sheep, his friends take care of each other. I thought that was one of the coolest things I've ever heard.Well two of those friends are leaving SD soon so I wanted to plan something nice. So a group of 5 sheep got together last rainy Sunday for one last possible get together.I was sold about their Sunday Champagne Brunch by the menu they have online. - $45/pp- includes ts traditional champagne, Mimosas, Bloody Marys (!!) and Margaritas (!!)- array of artisan cheeses will be offered on table side - new Juice Bar composed of locally grown freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables- caviar, oysters, crab claws, prime rib, sushi: did I mention CAVIAR?!- Chocolate fountain!!! Crepe and waffle stationI figured each one of us could easily get our $45 worth with the menu that I repeatedly studied last week. For example, friend#1 doesn't like brunch stuff per se but she loves drinks so I calculated that she would need to drink 'x' amount of drinks and eat 'x' amount of oysters in order to get her $45 worth. Or friend#2 would need to eat two orders of prime rib, drink 8 fresh juices, and make 3 trips to chocolate fountain in order to get HIS $45 worth. Something like that. I had it ALL calculated in my head.To summarize: (go to their online menu to see list of items served that day)- Bloody Mary tasted a bit too clamato for me but the others at the table loved it. Nice presentation and they don't skimp on the booze- Margarita : A.W.E.S.O.M.E!! Our server even asked me if I wanted a double shot of tequila in this drink (which my overly protective friend said 'no she does not'). \u00a0There's fresh lime, tequila, orange juice, sweet & sour mix (I think) in this beautifully presented drink. Even the salt lined rim of the glass tasted good!- I thought someone would be squeezing fresh veggies and fruits for the Juice Bar but that's not the case. There's 3 juices to choose from in that department : I believe they're 1) carrot & ginger; 2) kale, spinach, green apple; and 3) pineapple and acai berry.- most of their hot food items weren't very good. Wellington of Salmon with lobster sauce, chicken breast with mushrooms, scallop/shrimp pot pie, and both eggs benedict were all pretty bad- \u00a0I've never been a caviar person because it always tasted a bit strange to me. But when it's included in a Champagne Brunch, you betcha I'm gonna try it and try LOADS of it (I figured it was the most expensive item that day so this would be the item I would make them go broke on... that was *my* smart stupid thinking).I topped my little blini with creme fraiche, chives, and a big ol' dollop of black caviar (the name of the caviar wasn't displayed). It looked pretty but just tasted too fishy for me. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste and I, for lack of better judgement, don't really know my caviar. So perhaps there are those out there that would really love this dish. But all I can say is that no one at the table went back for seconds for this caviar.- Jonah crab claws: the version here is semi cracked and there's a crab claw cracker on each table. But dang man, these were a pain in the buttocks to crack. The shell is super hard and even though they partially crack it, it still takes some intense work to get to the crab meat. And not sure if you've cracked a crab claw recently, but it isn't exactly a non-messy type of chore. Needless to say, I had a few crab pieces in my hair and dress- oysters were fresh but not the meatiest of oysters- Sashimi: It's not that this wasn't good. It's just that it wasn't amazing for what you think you'd be getting at The Westgate Hotel for a Champagne Brunch. My second serving of the hamachi sashimi was questionable : the slice of fish looked unhealthy - my 2 favorite items: Prosciutto (perfect amount of salt and fat) and Duck breast with walnut truffle vinaigrette sauce- crepe and waffle station: VERY GOOD. Everyone said this was the highlight of their meal- Chocolate fountain: they have strawberries, mini donuts, marshmallows for you to run through the chocolate waterfall !- valet is $3 for first two hours, $4/hour thereafterThe restaurant and 2nd floor felt eerily quiet, old, and haunted house-ish to me (I don't mean this in a negative way - I'm just a scared-y mouse when it comes to this type of stuff).Service was attentive and we never felt rush. It was a fun meal : not b/c the food was all that great but b/c of my flock that beautiful, rainy March afternoon..."], ["JandZ W.", "We've been to the Sunday brunch buffet more times than I can count. This is one of our favorite places to celebrate special occasions and to take our out of town visitors. At $45 per person, it's the best brunch deal in town *and* you get to feel fancy while you stuff your face to live piano music in a rococo inspired dining room. Having said that--please dress appropriately! There's always a handful of ragamuffins that taint the frou frou ambiance.(As far as the price is concerned, it should be noted that for special occasions, such as their Mother's Day brunch which we attended recently, the price usually shoots up to $65; the food offerings remain mostly the same except its way more crowded and the service is worse). Over the years, the food selection has been consistently impressive. The spread ranges from salads, seafood, hot dishes (which, given its a buffet, are actually lukewarm), made to order breakfast items (i.e. omelets, crepes, waffles), carving stations, and an array of little desserts and a chocolate fountain with strawberries, marshmallows, biscotti, and mini donuts for dipping. As with any buffet, quality and creativity are sometimes limited and compromised because the food needs to sit for long periods of time and be continuously refilled, but they do their best. My go-to favorites include the crab cakes, fried shrimp plate, the ceviches, scalloped potatoes, and gnocchi. I always order a crepe with berries, as well as a waffle, and I try one of every dessert--except for the brioche chocolate chip bread pudding, of which I have at least two servings even if I've already stuffed myself to the point of nausea. Bottomless mimosas are a must for us, but they also offer margaritas, bloody marys, and champagne. There's also coffee and tea if you don't feel like getting sloshed at 11am on a Sunday. While this may be the best brunch in town for the money, I have been irked by the level of service we've received over the past year or so. For instance, I *always* have to ask our server(s)--usually repeatedly--for crab crackers, for their table-side cheese service, for the table-side pastry/muffin/bread service, for mimosa refills, and for plate clearing. Its incredibly annoying and disappointing, but I try to eat and drink my feelings instead of giving the staff major \"tude.\" So, if this is your first visit, just keep in mind that they do offer these table-side services & they are not to be missed! You might have to ask your server multiple times, but the gouda and croissants are worth the uncomfortable nagging. Though there is certainly room for improvement, this brunch is definitely secured as one of our favorite places to celebrate with the people we love."], ["Lori W.", "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!! Amazing, friendly service from the minute the valet opens your door. The decor is like being at a mini Versailles, so fun to be somewhere with European Elegance in a beach town like San Diego.

I love sharing it with friends and family; most people have no idea what to expect and everyone is wowed once they step inside."], ["Brad G.", "For a beautiful, elegant yet relaxed brunch, with excellent food choices, champagne, and live piano music, this is the place.

Food is fresh and I like the way they serve a lot of their food in little dishes that you take back to your seat (instead of big trays where you could easily take more than you should).

Will definitely be hitting this place up again!!"], ["Sinni L.", "I love this place for brunch (in San Diego).

It did not seem very busy at all. \u00a0Our waiter come over promptly and took our drink order. \u00a0We got up to go get our first dish. \u00a0I was craving the crab and went straight for it. \u00a0Too bad there was none! I asked the worker standing around if they can bring more crab out and he asked the woman bringing out oysters if she could bring more crab out. \u00a0She tells him they are out and speaks to her privately. \u00a0He comes back to me says they'll be out in 10 minutes. \u00a0I come back ten minutes later and there's nothing. \u00a0The same woman comes out and puts out more food and I ask her directly and she tells me they are out. \u00a0How is that possible? You are only half way through brunch and you are out of crab? Paying $45 I expect to get crab. \u00a0I was highly disappointed.Besides missing the crab, I was not impressed by any of the other food offered. \u00a0I like hot food and all the food was luke warm and/or cold. \u00a0$45 is highly overpriced for the type of food you receive. \u00a0Besides no crab and cold food, I also was unimpressed by the service. \u00a0The waiter was very slow in clearing our table. \u00a0Sitting at a small table, you can only fit enough plates for 2 people. \u00a0If the plates don't get cleared we can't put our new food on the table. \u00a0I was constantly calling over random waiters to clear out plates. \u00a0In the end, I will not be coming back and I was highly disappointed in my experience at this restaurant. \u00a0I'd rather go to brunch at Tom Ham's for $10 less. \u00a0There's a view as well as hot food and food that does not run out."], ["Chris S.", "Certainly not worth the price of admission! Food was good, service was barely adequate, atmosphere is kind of fun because there is nothing else like it in San Diego! Considering how little the server staff has to do, I always had to ask for more water and more champagne which I find unacceptable. I walked into the men's room and the door hit a female staff worker on the rear and as she was bent over picking up trash, and yet there was no warning on the exterior door that the bathroom was closed or there was a servicemember inside. Ironically, she acted put out that I rammed the door into her, in spite of the fact that I was a man in the men's restroom and she was female, and after I apologized, she finally softened and said, \"oh, ok?!\" Really???! The more I think about it, the service was actually terrible, our dirty plates were never cleared in a timely fashion......yeah, I know it was Mother's Day, but I still found the service to be terrible considering the level of restaurant that they position themselves to be."], ["Justin H.", "Honestly? This is the best buffet I've ever been to, ever. Ever.My aunt and uncle were visiting from DC, and they work in Congress so they are used to exorbitantly fancy fare. I wanted to impress them, so I asked around, and everyone told me to go to Westgate for Sunday champagne brunch.By the time we were done eating, all we could talk about was how wonderful the entire experience was. The sitting area is very pretty - a bit frou frou but it's champagne brunch for crying out loud. The waiters purposely lead you past giant blocks of aged stinky cheeses that they later bring to your table. These cheeses are lethal and decadent, and they cleared out my sinuses.Onto the food itself. Buffet. Several tables. Well-organized. Gorgeously plated. Bonus points for the chocolate fountain that I didn't go near because I'm an Angeleno.The seafood was so fresh and delicious. All you can eat fresh sashimi for $42? Seriously? Wait, that's not even true, because there's also AYCE lamb, prime rib, oysters, gourmet food that I can't pronounce, and - wait for it - caviar. My aunt and uncle were astounded, and I was very proud of myself, especially after my third glass of bubbly.Now, there's one thing that I do have to pick on. It was getting near the end of brunch, and there were only a few parties left. So I politely asked the waiter if it was time to go. He said, a bit snappy, \"We are waiting for you.\" Did he mean it in a rude way? I don't think so. I was food coma'd and happy and full of delicious fresh seafood and lamb and prime rib, so I let it go.Westgate Hotel itself is a bit of a trip. It's like Versailles took E and threw up on itself. A bit tacky and silly, but just go upstairs and gorge on this wonderful champagne brunch."], ["Foodie P.", "The Sunday Brunch at Le Fontainebleau is excellent. \u00a0They offer a wonderful array of dishes. \u00a0The selection is more lavish and the dishes are more refined than what you'd normally see at a brunch buffet in San Diego. \u00a0They have black caviar on the buffet. \u00a0I've never been to a buffet that had all you can eat black caviar. \u00a0Usually, you only see salmon roe.The service was excellent! \u00a0I will definitely be back and would highly recommend Le Fontainebleau's Sunday brunch."], ["D K.", "Although the price tag was hefty ($52 adults and $29 kids) for Sunday brunch, everything was wonderful. I particularly enjoyed that the chafing dish foods were in individual dishes so it looked (as well as tasted) fabulous. My favorite foods were the mac-n-cheese on top of a short rib, the chocolate croissants, the fresh made crepes and the chocolate fountain (with high quality chocolate). I also liked that margaritas and bloody marys were included as well as champagne. If you do not like seafood, you may find this buffet a little limited - there were other options, but it was very heavy on seafood. It also does not include sparkling cider if you want that as a champagne alternative."], ["Brianne J.", "Lovely Brunch! The dinning \u00a0room is ornate and feels very old European. \u00a0Live \u00a0piano music played. It was a nice touch but a little loud based on were we sat.

No. \u00a0I think I'm being generous with three stars. \u00a0The service was pretty good. Contrary to some reviews, we didn't have a problem with the wait staff clearing plates and bringing the cheeses to the table. However, they never refilled the water. The food was pretty good but limited. If you look on their website, the menu is pretty extensive. In reality about 25% of the items were not available. \u00a0It's a little misleading. The food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. If your spending this much money, go to the Hotel Del Coronado. Yes, it's almost twice as much, but it's about four times better.It was an ok experience, but I wouldn't come here again. \u00a0They validate parking, but you still have to pay $3 instead of $8."], ["Nicole P.", "Overall this was a wonderful brunch experience. The only issue is that some types of seafood are left out for too long on the buffet, so they get dry and lack flavor. The oysters, mussels and clams were all dried out and bland, not freshly opened as they would be in a restaurant during dinner service. The oysters were difficult to get out of the shell and had no brine. Other than this one issue, brunch here is lovely. There is a wide selection of food, from breakfast items such as an omlet station, to carving stations and desserts. Crepes and crab cakes, and bread pudding were all standouts. The price is very reasonable for what you get. Champagne, juice and coffee are served at your table, along with a delicious table side cheese cart. Service is wonderful and attentive, and I enjoyed the live piano music as well. It's so nice to have an alternative to the usual brunch madness!"], ["Nagarjuna S.", "One of the best place to go.

I don't know if it was just because we arrived towards the end of brunch, but the food and service otherwise were mediocre.

We weren't notified that they had pastries that should have been brought around to us; we only saw other people had some so we had to ask.

The pianist is awesome (even let my mom sing along with him [face palm]). It's all elegantly good here... No schmaltz (like at the Hotel Del) just good food and an excellent experience...

Well it's hard to decide. \u00a0The cronuts okay, not anything special. \u00a0 However I do love the bombolonis (Italian donuts) because they are cream filled with mascarpone-like filling which is the cheese used for cheesecake! They are to-die for! Sooooo yum!! I also go for the sweet potato pie, apple cream cheese, and guava turnover. \u00a0Yes, the guava turnover is comparable to Porto's, I wonder who came up with it first?They also have pre packaged lunch sandwiches, like cranberry turkey, ham and cheese, tuna, egg salad...

I'm insulted that they were selling a whole tray of them. My receipt says \"Almond Banana\", but the tray was labelled \"Chocolate Banana\". I also bought a \"Pain Aux Raisins\" for $2.00, and it was just ok, but not nearly as good as a similar French pastry that I can buy at Arely French Bakery in Clairemont.

I bought this once and threw it away. I'll stick to their regular bread.Overall, their sweets are good. The savory breads with sausage or noodles inside are not that great (compared to other asian-adaptation type bakeries like this).If you're a foodie, it's fun to go and just look at the variety and try different stuff.

Since they have tables here, I sat here for an hour drinking my tea, eating my pastry, and reading my book. It was pretty nice. Oh, and they have free WiFi too!Plus, my friend bought me a cake from here for my birthday and it was delicious! They also look really pretty. Granted they're a bit expensive, but I think it's worth it."], ["Rina K.", "CARBS :)))))things i always get:-corn bread (like japanese melon bread but crunchy with more texture and taste of corn)-cheese cake original (like japanese mushi cheese cake)-blueberry cream cheese bread (very similar to the blueberry bread at 85degrees, but a bit more wet? i feel like this one isn't perfected like 85 but will curb my cravings for it anyway)-chocolate croissant: omg so flaky and buttery and chocolate-y and that's all i need to make me want to wake up in the mornings.things i sometimes get:-mocha bread (recently became available, has a hard coffee top like japanese melon bread and the bottom is fluffy, light and airy sooo delicious. the two work together in combination really really well)-garlic bread (the giant one with bacon bits and parsley mixed into the dough is SO GOOD. eat that one in caution because apparently it has both garlic and onion so it makes your breath smell bad. BUT SO DELICIOUSLY WORTH IT.i did not like:the hyped cronut. not worth it (three dollars? i think), it was soggy and oily as fuhhhh and the taste wasn't that great. i would honestly rather eat a donut or a croissant. the cronut is a tryhard."], ["Mary Y.", "3.5 stars. I love PB pastries in general, but this location ran out of boba the day I came, which was disappointing and they don't have nonfat milk options for their lattes. But they offer a cronut (croissant-donut) version that's really delicious and flaky. It's about $3.50. They have a fair amount of seating towards the back of the cafe."], ["Mei W.", "I love asian pastries and was excited to see that Paris Baguette was close to the place I was staying at because I've seen IG pictures from this place and it looks delicious. Well, it looks delicious in pictures, alright in person, and not so good at all when eaten. And these pastries are sooo greasy. Very disappointed - but at least I won't get fooled by those pretty pictures anymore!"], ["Alan N.", "Very cute little place, clean and staff is a bunch of high schoolers so you know what to expect. Very wide selection of pastries, everything was really good."], ["Phoenix H.", "This is like heaven if you have a sweet tooth. All the pastries and cakes look mouth watering! I need to come back and try everything. I got the passion fruit and earl grey macaroons. I enjoyed them very much. Yum. The macaroons are $2.50 a piece though, which I think are kinda pricey for what you get."], ["Teresa N.", "Yea it's a chain, South Korean chain.. not sure why they call it Paris BaguetteI try to stop by the store every time I shop at Zion Market. It's nice and clean. I like their Asian style bread.. stuffed with hot dogs or custard. Delicious! No it's not a cafe, there are no tables. But I think you you get use the food court at Zion Market? They have coffee too! Perfect place to get breakfast"], ["Tran J.", "Cute little shop for upscale pastries, cakes, sandwiches, and teas. Located in Zion Market. They have their own entrance. Just follow their sign!Everything is self serve, unless you order a slice of cake from the display next to the register. Right when you enter there's wooden trays and a sheet of paper you put on top. You have tongs and then off you go to pick whatever you want to in the displays.Have tried their drinks there.. not a fan. Tried a bunch of pastries, some stood out way more than others. I used to eat their cream cheese danishes all the time, but can be quite pricey. The blueberry or raspberry with cream cheese danish is good only when its fresh. It has a crispy flaky-ness to it and then a yummy filling. If left for too long, kinda chewy rubbery.Cream puffs are good. I like the tiramisu one.The royal milk pudding, strawberry pudding... All the puddings are good. It reminds me of a cross between flan and wannabe cheesecake because of the graham like crust on the bottom. The jars are really cute.The famous cronut. I've tried the original one with lemon I think?, orange, and strawberry. Get them fresh, it tastes very good. But if you let it sit, it becomes way too oily.I'm a lover of garlic. Sadly they discontinued the garlic bread crisps. Garlic rusks are good. I was extremely obsessed at one point with their mini garlic croissants and bought almost 100 in one week.. no joke. But I shared it with my coworkers and everyone at home. It doesn't taste the same anymore as the first time I had it when it was very garlicky. But I like having it from time to time. I love their cakes! Not too sweet and very light! Love the strawberry fresh cream of the blueberry chiffon cake. When ordering it whole, it's cool that they give you candles with a knife, and matches with a striker so that you're prepared to light up the cake. Normally we always forget that part. But they have it for you already which is real nice."], ["Sharry S.", "I love stepping into a restaurant that strives to keep a clean, welcoming and visually pleasing ambience. I always feel good choosing my items and then having a clean table available to enjoy them at. \u00a0The desserts, sandwiches and drinks are always fresh and pretty to look at!"], ["Molly H.", "So delish and fresh. Came back for more didn't know what to choose. So I got a little of several pastries."], ["Rob W.", "The cakes and desert items here are very beautiful in appearance and very tasty. They have a pretty large selection of items here and they are very well presented. The toughest decision is what to order."], ["Catherine C.", "3.5 stars. \u00a0I like this bakery, but I only come here when I'm already shopping at Zion Market. \u00a0They have tasty little garlic bread croissants, fried curry bread, chapjae bread, and lots of other interesting treats and sweets. \u00a0Prices are very fair, staff service is just average, but the shop is appealing with nice lighting, and tables to sit down and enjoy breakfast or coffee if you feel like eating there. \u00a0They have a point card system that accumulates when you make a purchase of $5 or more in one visit. \u00a0Parking can get full during busy Zion hours, but generally it's not a problem, and the lot is very big."], ["Kat H.", "Oh, Paris Baguette, you never fail me. From your buttery, hot dog pastries to your delicious cronut varieties available, I love you so. The place is always packed. Packed like the line would extend out towards other Zion vendors. The cakes always look so pretty. The macarons are delicious. The hand crafted beverages are a little over priced but never disappoint. I do like their iced teas. Their whip cream on the puff pastries are always light and fluffy. Definitely one of my favorite places to go. The one located in H Mart- Mira Mesa is also fabulous."], ["Polly H.", "SOMEONE HOLD ME BACK. I wanted to buy every pastry in here. But I ended up just buying two things - the green tea bread and the strawberry cronut. I got the cronut just out of curiosity; it was actually a bit too sweet for my preference. But good nonetheless! The green tea bread, on the other hand, was just perfect. The green tea is a paste-like texture and there are candied almonds on top. Sooo guuud. Coming back again for sure!"], ["Darlene B.", "I heard from my cousin that they serve \"Cronuts\" here. As a special little treat I made the effort to pick one up for my other cousin's son on his birthday since we were stopping by. It was a weekday evening and the selection was limited. Paris Baguette is located INSIDE H-Mart so this area is fairly small. You can easily bump into a bunch of people. I took the last 2 cronuts of it's kind. We go to the register to pay. The bagger is a kid, and he places one cronut in the plastic container, then he attempts to do so with the other one but touches it with his hands. WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING GLOVES?!? - especially if you're not even running the register - apparently it takes 2 people to get a customer out the door. He goes...\"uhm, i touched it\" - he couldn't even pick out a new one to replace because we took the last 2. He apologizes and gives us the cronut @ 50% off -- uhm it should be FREE. Thanks for ruining the experience! I think this place is expensive and I'm not a huge fan."], ["Nancy W.", "ARGH! I'm so glad they have the mango pudding today!! I came here right when they opened to avoid the long lines but sadly they didn't really have much pastries out yet. No biggie! I still liked the selections that they did have for the time being. Sadly this location doesn't give out small boxes for the pudding like the ones up north.Next time i come back, i will be here 12pm SHARP! for the Cronuts. I have yet to try any, either they run out or i'm always too early :("], ["Caroli G.", "I happened to run into this little bakery while on a sake adventure to Zion Market. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the sweets and pastries on display so I put my sake plans on hold and headed on over to give it a try.Despite its small size there is a big selection of both sweet and savory goods along with coffees and smoothies. \u00a0They not only have fresh baked items but also pre packaged ones and they bake cakes for special occasions, which if they taste as good as they look I am sold...but not today, not todayI decided to take some cronuts (because whats not to love about donut hybrids of any type), cheese bread, and one other buttery deliciousness of a treat that I do not recall the name. \u00a0I shared my findings when I got home and yum! all were fresh and moist with just the perfect amount of sweet. \u00a0My favorite ended up being the cheese bread, which I will definitely be back for more."], ["Jenn C.", "Love this place. Loved the mango turnover and the guava turnover. Paired it with a nice hot coffee. Fruit tart was delicious and beautiful. Mocha cheesecake was pretty good. Egg tarts here are good, but in my opinion aren't as good as the the ones from the Chinese places though. But the upside is the egg tarts are bite-sized which I think is a more appropriate size. Cute music. I'm coming back whenever I can."], ["Clara Y.", "Paris Baguette located inside zion is a small bustling korean bakery with an assortment of freshly baked bread, pastries, cakes, and more! I usually get overwhelmed when I go in because I want to buy/try everything. This time because I blew all my money on zion groceries I allowed myself one item. I chose a loaf of chestnut studded white bread (sadly there's no white cream filling). The bread itself is fluffy and subtely sweet, and the golden chestnuts sporadically scattered within the bread provides a creamy sweet texture to it. There are baked crumbs scattered on the outside edges that bring more flavor and sweetness to the bread. If you get bored of just eating the bread by itself, like I did, put some unsalted crunchy almond butter on it. It tastes so good! Im eating this for a quick breakfast right now :)Also the workers there wear striped black and white shirts with a black Beret. When I was buying my bread I commented on the cool hats and the cashier miserably said he'd rather work without it but its part of their uniform. Loll. He was nice and so were the other workers."], ["Shanna U.", "We always shop at Zion market and only the past time we went did we stop in the bakery. \u00a0Bad choice! \u00a0Now whenever we're there I'm going to want to stop by the bakery. \u00a0The cronut was so good and my taro milk tea was so yummy! \u00a0They're always very busy and people can be kinda pushy in there so just be prepared if you go during a busy time."], ["Ashley J.", "I liked it......I didnt LOVE it . We tried many different things, most were good. Some were alright.The macaroons for instance, extremely good. But why so expensive? \u00a0I also don't like only being able to get a gift pack with flavors already chosen for me..sell them individually. The egg tart is heavenly. One of the best things I've ever had.The green tea latte, superb.Other assorted things we tried (they were giving out samples like crazy) were all ok. The breads seem like what you should get here.Some pastry called a canole, was not a favorite, and skip the cakes in the front. Service was really friendly and its such a cute place. Ill be back for an egg tart and green tea latte when im in the area. Maybe for a \u00a0loaf of bread too!"], ["Philip R.", "Finally got to check this place out after hearing about it from friends. Definitely reminds me of 85 degrees. If you've been to Pangea, this place is smaller but there is tons of seating in the food court area nearby. The place also is brighter in comparison due to their interior lighting and decor. The pastry selection is solid with various red bean and cheese pastries as well as cronuts for those of you looking for another place to get some besides Donut Bar. I picked up a curry croquette (wasn't fully stuffed with curry but the flavor was decent...just wish I had gotten it after it had been made), red bean bun (my litmus test for pastry places), and coffee bun. The coffee bun was fluffy with a slight mocha flavor crust. Delicious!Going to come back here to try more of their selection next time I'm in the area."], ["Paul J.", "this place should be banned. Everything in here is so damn tasty, without being too sweet or oily. I can't stand bakeries where it leaves a film of grease/fat all over my mouth, which makes me appreciate PB's pastries even more - they are always delicate in flavor while satisfying my sweet tooth.Eat a cronut, run 5 miles. Seems about right"], ["Rosalee I.", "I love this place, it's definetly smaller and fewer selections like other Paris Baguette shops. Regardless their desserts are absolutely amazing!"], ["Diane L.", "I finally tried the cronut here and sadly, it is mostly just hype. The taste didn't blow me away. It just tastes like a Chinese donut with different cream/spread on top and in between. It's good as a donut because it's light and crispy. But it did not taste anything at all like a croissant. \u00a0I rather have just a croissant or donut by itself.. not together. The milk tea was sweet but not too sweet. I enjoyed that more than the cronut. Their egg tarts are good and I've also ordered a birthday cake here because they're cute, but again just tastes decent.Paris baguette reminds me of any Asian bakery and there isn't much that sets it apart from Pangea or the bakery inside 99 Ranch Market. I still like 85\u00b0c bakery much better as their pastries are lighter and fluffier. Paris is definitely overrated."], ["Irina R.", "I was disappointed with the chocolate strawberry cake I got for my husband's birthday. \u00a0Although it looks very pretty, it definitely doesn't taste as good. \u00a0Simple chocolate cake you could make from a store-bought cake mix layered with unremarkable white frosting and strawberries. \u00a0It was $36 and in my opinion totally not worth the price. \u00a0I did want to point out that the staff is very friendly but the product was not a hit."], ["Saki E.", "The freshness of their cakes with fruit doesn't last long. I bought a cake for my dad on Tuesday night, he didn't have the chance to cut/eat it until Friday morning. Saturday morning I wake up to find one of the berries molding badly. Very Disappointed. The cakes at Paris baguette are delicious, but don't expect them to last long. buy your cake day of the event."], ["Helena E.", "Cronuts are sinfully delicious however this batch was over fried! The frosting tasted like grocery store quality, nothing special. Usually I take my goodies home to enjoy in utter privacy. Man-oh-man I should have stuck to my uusual plan. Never noticed that when you eat there, you are eating off the lined tray from which other hands have also embarked on. Eh, not so appetizing.Taking them To-Go the pastries only lay on the liner momentarily & the buttery goodness does not envelope through the liner to the tray. However opting to eat there forced us to rush on devouring them. Too much of a germaphobe to try and enjoy pastries there.Cronuts are a delectable treat! Sadly this visit they were not winners."], ["Anthony G.", "This place is really good! \u00a0A bit pricy but well worth it! These pastries are very unique to San Diego and this particular spot is much better than the other place in Mira Mesa.I've pretty much had everything here but my favorite are the cream filled holes! \u00a0I haven't been here in a minute due to the small adiction I was beginning to create. I must return!"], ["Jules F.", "Thank you Lachesis, the fellow YELPER that wrote the review that encouraged my visit to this little oasis of a Bakery. It is very different from most French Bakeries I've been to. They have many unusual items such as Cronuts, Squid Ink Bread, Shaved Ice with Fruit, Sushi Sandwiches, Asian Style Dough style concoctions, sweetened breads?, tarts, breakfast wraps, the most Beautiful and Unusual CAKES I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Was way to full sampling other things to have any cake this time. I loaded a number of photos of the experience too. Hope you enjoy. Cannot wait to go back. Shopped at the market afterwards and was catapulted into another dimension as I really didn't know what most of these items (all written in Korean) were that were being snapped up from the shelves in an aggressive manor displaying that personal relationship that we have with our favorite items.I truly enjoyed myself but will have to limit the number of items I get at the bakery next time......awfully full right now! But dooooo go! Have fun and please put a review up for us to read."], ["Jascha M.", "Went to Zion market to check it out and I wanted some dessert so I went here. First thought-- fancy schmancy! I felt I had to lift my pinky finger each time I take a pastry to put on my tray. They have different desserts from fruit tarts to macaroons. I chose the egg custard, which was really good! I like the light sweetness and flaky crust it had. Compared to the egg custard from the Chinese Bakery in El Cajon Blvd, theirs had a slightly crunchy and crumbly crust and the filling wasn't as deep as the ones here. I personally like the egg custards here better! Will come back and highly recommend this place to friends, family, and Yelpers!"], ["Jessica T.", "Cutest little bakery ever! I come here quite often and I like to try something new each time. They have some very typical pastries, as well as some more interesting ones. They sell a variety of sliced bread and other goodies as well, such as macarons and puddings and cakes. I really suggest their baguette rusks, which are my mom's favorite. They also sell tasty sandwiches and a variety of drinks. \u00a0They even have patbingsu (Korean shaved ice) during the summer time, which always hits the spot. One of my most favorite places to waste my money in San Diego."], ["Adam A.", "Love this bakery!Tucked away in the corner of Zion market, this little bakery is a real gem. They have several locations throughout the state, and I had been to a few in LA, and their other location at H mart.They offer everything from cakes to artisan sandwiches, and a variety of varying pastries for your enjoyment. I love their sausage based pastries, as they make a great quick snack or lunch. I haven't tried their cakes yet, but they look amazing. I have had tried just about every pastry they offer though, and each has been excellent. I once received a walnut pound cake as a gift, and it may just have been the best pound cake I have ever had.They can have a line out the door on weekends, so plan accordingly. They also offer coffee and boba based drinks if your interested. I have been eyeing their castella for a few days now, may need to stop by and grab one."], ["Thu L.", "Ordered a large (20 oz) green tea latte and got 2/3 of what I paid for. On top of that, it was overly sweet that I couldn't even drink. I love Paris Baguette but this is unacceptable. I won't return to this location anymore."]]}
