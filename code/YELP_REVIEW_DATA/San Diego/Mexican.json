On a positive note, the salsa selection is pretty great... But the salsas themselves were mediocre. I love spicy food and salsa is probably my favorite condiment.

The wonderful owner Gerry Torres (also of City Tacos) was there to greet us and walk us through their menu of agua frescas, juices, and unique tostadas. You order at the counter and find yourself a seat on the communal table, or one of the chairs by the tostada bar, or there are a couple of tables inside and outside. I got the mixta (mixed seafood ceviche and pineapple) and sandia (ahi tuna, watermelon and about a million other things). The hubby went for le de pato (duck breast) and ceviche de pascado (red snapper). My favorite was definitely the sandia--the sweet crisp watermelon was the perfect complement to the ahi tuna. This is what summer is all about! I probably could have done without some of the other ingredients because I honestly couldn't taste all of them. I also love that the watermelon helped to prevent the tostada from getting soggy. The mixta was good, but difficult to eat because of the thick ring of pineapple. The hubby enjoyed his tostadas but said that the ceviche one got really soggy because it had been sitting for a little bit longer than the others before it was brought to us. Overall, the tostadas are incredibly fun, with unique combinations of ingredients. I like that they don't seem to take themselves too seriously and experiment with ingredients you wouldn't ever see together, let alone on a tostada. Gerry really took care of us--he even asked for our feedback about the food and generously re-filled our drinks. By the way, the watermelon agua fresca and banana agua fresca (think horchata but with banana) were super delicious, refreshing and not too sweet. We'll definitely be back!"], ["Tony C.", "If you are a fan of seafood and City Tacos down the street you will enjoy Tostadas.Walking in I was immediately greeted with a smile by a young gentleman. All the staff were nice and I really appreciated when the chef came over to check in on me and ask how the food was. I was also pleasantly surprised to see fruit on display and them making fresh juices in the background. Honestly I was expecting more of a taco shop vibe. I was totally wrong! Instead it had a healthier feel to it since the restaurants menu is based around fresh juices, waters and seafood.  I ordered the ceviche de pescado, aguachile, and sandia tostadas. \u00a0The pescado tostada was prepared with Red snapper and fairly traditional. I felt they put too much of the avocado sauce (which I mentioned to the chef) and slightly took away from the flavor of the ceviche. Either way it wasn't bad. Next up was the aguachile tostada. The menu description says large Mexican shrimp and they aren't lying. The shrimp they used were huge, prepared perfectly with the right amount of heat coming from serrano chilies and acidity that a aguachile should have. Lastly was the sandia (watermelon) tostada which was my favorite. A slice of sandia, topped with fresh ahi tuna, bits of red onions, jicama, mango, apple, cucumber and peanuts. It was the most unique tostada I've ever had and delicious. I would order all of these again but the sandia really stood out. This was all washed down with agua de sandia which was absolutely refreshing on a hot afternoon. Great addition to North Park and can't wait to come back.

The Mixta surprised me since I'm not a big fan of pulpo (octopus), but this pulpo was tender and so flavorful. All of their seafood is fresh and you can definitely taste it in each tostada.

All the options are spelled in spanish, which I don't speak so I accidentally ordered the lobster bisque but luckily it was really good.

Sure enough, they sent us a text that we were to be seated right at the 20 minute mark. I suggest having a churro or a street taco nearby to whet your palette for the great food that awaits you at this place. It is worth the wait. Had a really nice server (his name escapes me) but he was very attentive, made sure we were taken care of, and constantly kept our waters filled to the brim on a warm Sunday afternoon. Chips were great. The house salsa it came with wasn't anything to write home about, but I didn't come here just for that. I came for a burro enchilada style, or a \"wet\" burro as so many Californians refer it as. I ordered a chicken burrito with the red sauce on top. The dish came with refried beans and Mexican rice.

I need to show the boys where I'm at.

However, their prices also reflect the portion sizes of their items and sadly their quality too. Although I cannot say I truly know my Mexican cuisine, I have eaten at many other Mexican joints to compare and unfortunately Mexican Fiesta does not compare. My order consisted of their Machaca Burrito and while it was cheap, around $3.80, the size of their burrito was definitely disappointing. To start off, the burrito was smaller than your typical disposable water bottle. If that wasn't enough to disappoint, the burrito lacked flavor that I was heavily expecting. To be quite frank, the burrito was simply way too bland to the point that I relied upon their 'hot sauce' to supplement for taste. Sadly this does not only apply to their burritos, as a few days later I ordered their Carne Asada Fries in hopes of swaying my mind. Their fries are topped with the most liquified guacamole I have encountered and their carne asada was almost nonexistent to the point where my fries included close to a handful of pieces the size of a trident gum. The only saving grace to this meal was their fries, typically I'm not a fan of most fries but these ones had a nice bite to them and brought together the catastrophe that was this item. Overall, I would say this place suffices for a quick meal but their items do not satisfy if you're looking for quality Mexican food."], ["Amit T.", "Fish tacos are to die for and so are the burritos.

Overall ok."], ["Allie M.", "Ok so let's set the scene. Bracero was my pick for celebrating my second wedding anniversary with my husband. We went to The Patio (Goldfinch) for our last anniversary and had a slightly less than stellar brunch. We came into this with high hopes on a glowing recommendation from a co-worker and friend. I tried to make reservations, but with our anniversary only a week out and this place being hot spit--it didn't happen. Husband and I decided to risk it anyway and head down early from North County to grab a spot in the downstairs kitchen. (Sadly can't comment on the upstairs dining room and decor but the wall of cowboy hats atop the staircase seemed promising). For us lowly patrons sans reservations, the wait was actually minimal. We arrived just before 5pm which is when the downstairs dining room can order from the full menu. As we sat down, the front of house manager greeted us--but it was quite awhile until we actually got a server, probably 10 minutes. I was a little disappointed but all things considered, it did seem to really pick up (long line at the door) and appeared to be a shift change for the staff. I ordered the 'agua chiles' cocktail which was a watermelon, vodka based drink with a bit of a spicy kick to it. I loved it. Really interesting flavor, pretty stiff, but refreshing as well. As far as food--we ordered a handful of tacos, and a couple appetizers. OK so just to put it out there and not mess around, the Albacore Two Ways is AMAZEBALLS. Crunchy tempura, black sesame sauce, sashimi pieces and little jalepeno slices...oh my god. Just get the damn thing and be done with it. Also really amazing the BEEF TONGUE taco. Simple, elegant, on a delicious corn tortilla. Really, just, all around good flavor, well seasoned--on point. As far as middle ground--the \"Mexiterranean\" Adobada taco. Pretty intriguing concept with a yogurt style white sauce over the tangy adobada meat. It's a solid taco. If you're feeling adventurous--go for the shrimp and bone marrow sopes. Not my husbands favorite dish but I enjoyed them. As for the misses, the Fideo taco touts an 18-month aged cotija cheese--which, unfortunately is only sprinkled over the top of a crispy fried taco filled with what seems to be mostly a long grain rice, not the strong punch of chorizo when you bite into it. Ultimately, it tastes good but doesn't seem to fit the expectation build up by the description. Lastly, the poorest choice we made was the Grouper Birria taco. I can't really describe it any other way than just really, really...fishy. The elements here didn't seem balanced at all and the flavor was just not impressive. While I can't give this place 5 stars in my book, I will say that I loved the vibe and the adventurous menu (keep an eye out for the ant larvae). This place is lively and busy with good reason."], ["Lilly R.", "I suggest you read this review if you plan to try this new restaurant. Hmmm, where to start with this review. There were three phases of our dining experience, so I'll try to sum it up. (Backstory, my husband had heard of this hot new place and booked us a reservation 6 weeks in advance. Needless to say, we were optimistic and excited!).Act 1. We arrive and are seated in an upstairs tunnel like area. Turns out these are the tables they use to seat reservations (the entire downstairs space - the area we all see as we pass by and longingly think \"how cool is that!\"- is for first come first serve). So anyone making reservations gets stuck in the upstairs tunnel-like space which is dark, LOUD, and isolated. We order a few dishes recommended by our waiter and after the first two dishes, we are super disappointed with how bland and boring the courses are. The manager stop by, listens to our feedback, apologizes, and offers to re-seat us and offer some of his favorite dishes. Act 2. We get new seats outdoors (so much better), and we get treated like kings by the manager. He is the most kind, empathic manager I've encountered, and he offers to bring us some dishes he personally recommends, paired with wine. Even though we've had two dishes and aren't really hungry, I'm still open to experiencing this amazing food. He brings out multiple dishes paired with local wines, and he comes out to personally describe, in detail, \u00a0every dish. This is seriously one of the nicest dining experiences we've had. I am utterly impressed with the manager's kindness and attentiveness, and can't believe how many dishes he continues to bring out for us to try (not to mention paired with the wines).Act 3. Womp womp womp. After the dessert comes out, we get the bill. We are charged for each dish that he has brought out to us. (Thankfully he does not charge us for the wine pairing or the dishes we didn't care for before he moved us outside). Not surprisingly, we don't see him again once the bill arrives. SO DISAPPOINTED! We would have called it a night and left after the disappointing dishes, but we were offered what we thought was a reprieve on the house. Turns out, it wasn't on the house. Two things here. First, please get waiters who can describe the dishes and guide us toward dishes that fit our tastes. Second, don't have the manager come out and sweep us off our feet, and then charge us for the additional meals!For the quality of food, the ambience, and the price, I could not recommend this to any of my family or friends. This place was a huge disappointment and we will not, ever, be back."], ["Andrea G.", "Train wreck oh no! Was expecting so much more from this overly hyped restaurant.I love the concept, however I believe flavor. presentation and service are all musts for a place to hit the 5 stars.Servers are very uneducated in terms of the dishes they are offering.

The atmosphere is veryyyy trendy, I'm talking antique-farm-equipment-spinning-along-on-the-ceiling-in-the-stairwell trendy. The upstairs bar and balcony were looking mighty cool too, though we sat at a high table inside.We ordered cocktails - I had the Javiar Wallbanger which was delicious - two small plates and an entree and it was enough for two people. Specifically we had the albacore two-ways (mmmm!), the griddled cheese (double mmmm!) and the meat four-ways (sorry I don't know the exact names but you'll figure it out) and it was all unique and very good. I would recommend asking for extra tortillas though cause they were a little stingy on that front. The bill came to about $92 with tip.

Bracero came as recommendation from a server at another restaurant. We got a little background story, and tonight we were craving a little latin spice for dinner so we hopped in the car and headed down. Great location, easy to find, beautiful building and the architecture was appealing. We had no problems with finding a table for two on a Thursday night around 6:45pm. Having read a few reviews of the place on Yelp, I initially thought we ought to sit downstairs, but the view from up top was too good to pass up, so we decided on an upstairs balcony table in the corner. The hostess was polite and honest in informing us that those tables were generally for reservations, but the next reservation was at 8:30pm, which would give us PLENTY of time. We waited for quite a while for our server to come over to us, but she apologized for taking so long, no biggie. We ordered a couple cocktails, the guacamole and Tuna Two Ways to start. Drinks and apps get two thumbs up. For dinner, we got two of the tacos, the Cook Pigs carnitas taco and the adobadas taco (By the way, Cook Pigs sells locally I found and they are INCREDIBLE!!! \u00a0Cookpigs.com). Anyway, for the past reviewers who say these are glorified street tacos, I would have to disagree. They are not intended to be a meal folks, they are STREET TACOS. Inherently small in size and not meant to single handedly fill you up. They are similar in size to a TJ street taco, with all the fixings of a gourmet taco.They are worth the $5/taco- so cork-it haters. For the main course, we ordered the Cook Pigs pork and the short ribs. I didn't care to ask what was popular because I already spotted what looked good, so nothing else stood a change of swaying my decision. Two thumbs up, squared, for both meals. Exceptional meat, great little presentation that all went well together. I will say, one family style meal and the rest of what we ordered was plenty for two of us and we are good eaters. We could have probably stopped there and not have felt like blimps.

Each and every time, we left thrilled.From personal experience, my boyfriend and I can attest to the deliciousness of: the carne asada fries, the sabroso burrito, the california burrito, and two orders of the rolled tacos (incredible).The low key, no BS atmosphere of this place is the ultimate win. You're not paying for froofroo aesthetics, as there is only a small dining room, and no public restroom, BUT-- this place was spotless each time we went in, and the staff couldn't have been better.If you're in the market for a small, corner taco shop, look no further. If we're in the Point Loma area again, I'm sure we'll be back.PS: Try the salsa that comes in the yellow mustard bottle. No, seriously. Whatever you're eating will be better. You can thank me later."], ["Frank V.", "We found this taco shop courtesy of yelp and were craving tacos and carne asada fries. Small taco shop on a dark corner and when we walked in we were greeted with a smile and how can I help you. I went with the team members recommendation and ordered the Cali burrito and my boo went with the carne asada fries and we were not disappointed. The asada fries were LOADED with carne asada, fresh fries and all the works. My burrito was rolled in a fresh warm tortilla, loaded with fries, carne asada and the works only to find out I ordered the same as my boo only rolled in a tortilla! The dining area is clean, there is a flat screen with college football and the jarritos were nice and cold. We were completely satisfied from the customer service to the fresh food and the A from the dept of health.  We are full and happy"], ["Stephen M.", "When I lived in San Diego this was my favorite burrito joint, and having just stopped in again while back in the city, I have to say it still is. Their tortillas are toasted to perfection, their housemade salsas are amazing, and their Cali burrito is the perfect ratio of steak, fries, cheese, and sour cream. I have yet to find a place in SoCal that comes close."], ["Mike P.", "Ordered an al pastor burrito with guac and grilled onions. No guac in it and barely any onion. I went back asked for a side of guac and the cashier told me that there was guac inside the burrito and asked all the cooks if they put guac inside and of course they all said yes. Instead of just apologizing giving me a side of guac not that big of a deal. Luckily the food is good here but work on your customer service skills."], ["Brenyn C.", "Probably the best Mexican food ive ever had. There's nowhere near I live close to the flavor this place has great job with the fresh, delicious food"], ["Alison B.", "Best machaca in SD! We love this place, especially because we usually stop over at the donut shop next door for the kids too!Great little hole in the wall taco shop. Their salsas are delicious. Nice setting to dine in. I love how I don't need salt for their food, it has plenty of flavor! Also very friendly customer service!"], ["Betsy F.", "Rude: I stopped in one night for a quick bite to eat, I heard this was a great place to get a good burrito. They man behind the counter was rude. Seemed irritated that I wanted to know what was in the burrito \u00a0I was getting, seemed irritated that I wanted it with no avocado, seemed irritated that I wanted green sauce instead of red sauce. The food was OK, the service was rude."], ["Daniella W.", "Loved it! I got the Sabroso burrito with chicken and shrimp. The shrimp were huge and the chicken was freshly grilled! The staff were also so kind and helpful! I'll be back when I'm in San Diego again, thank you!"], ["Mike V.", "The prefect fish taco."], ["Jade S.", "Yum. Very friendly and food was good. First time in SD eating cali fries and Carne asade fries. Only thing our food was a little cold but still really good"], ["X D.", "We have been coming here for years. Tried a variety of choices on their menu. Nothing beats their Sabroso. It is filled with rice, carnesada and shrimp with a special tardy sauce to die for. I truly recommend it! It gets bit crowded in there but we take it to go. The prices are so reasonable too! Come here for some good Point Loma Mexican food. Always fresh!"], ["Pastor Johnny C.", "Food was pretty good. Got the Sabaroso Burrito & Carne Asada Fries since Yelp recommended it. The cashier wasn't too friendly but I came for the food not for the customer service. Was in the area for a Marriage Getaway and was trying to find Mexican Food open after 9pm on a Thursday night. This hit the spot."], ["David C.", "This place is really as good as everyone says it is. Their Cali Burrito is without a doubt one of the best burritos I've had anywhere. You SD folks are so lucky to have this place. Can't find this caliber of food quality and pricing in the Bay.My usual order: Cali Burrito w/ (2) Fish Tacos = Gluttony at its finest!Friendly staff and quick service. This joint is a must for me every time I'm in SD. I already memorized the surface street directions. Sad....Until we meet again!"], ["Steve S.", "Got two crispy, shredded chicken tacos with beans and rice and a California burrito to go. Plenty of food, tacos were okay, guacamole was hardly noticeable. Rice and beans okay. California burrito okay. Nothing special. However, I shouldn't be making repeated trips to the toilet the following day after eating at any restaurant. And for that reason, last night's first visit will be my last."], ["Ann W.", "Straight up - HOLE IN THE WALL HEAVEN!!! \u00a0We recently spent just shy of a week on Shelter Island in San Diego. \u00a0The young man who served us coffee at the hotel that morning offered up this gem as some local deliciousness to go check-out and I am so glad we did!I had the chilaquiles with red sauce, rice, and beans (OH, MY!) and my husband had the California burrito. \u00a0My husband said it was \"stoner food\" as he happily ate away at his burrito (...which had french fries stuffed inside). \u00a0I think this is their specialty as person after person ordered it as they came through the door. \u00a0Stoner or not (he is in the \"not\" category btw), at the end of the day, when you are hanging at the beach, living on an island for a week or just in the mood for some good Mexican food, Ortiz's Taco Shop was fabulous, no frills about it, dang good food."], ["Hannah N.", "I get a Cali Burrito or Carne Asada Fries almost weekly so I figured I should put a review. I have lived in OB for almost two years ( moved from Dallas) and this place is Godsend. Friendly service, delicious consistent burrito, and amazing rice and beans my two year old loves. Whenever any family or friends come to visit we know we are going to Ortiz for a quick, amazingly priced burrito. Love this place."], ["Katrina D.", "Came down to the area to go jet skiing and figured it'd be nice to grab a bite to eat first. \u00a0Yelped local restaurants and noticed this one had some really good reviews so we stopped by and ordered two Cali burritos and two drinks. \u00a0Came out to about $15 total, but definitely not bad for the portion size you get. My boyfriend and I both ended up with leftovers. \u00a0The meat was well seasoned, cheese nice and melty, and the fries were the icing on the cake. \u00a0Also, GUAC :) The restaurant is really clean on the inside even though we ordered to-go. \u00a0Customer service was great and the cashier was extremely friendly. \u00a0You could tell they naturally have a good reputation as several \"regulars\" came in and the cashier greeted them by name. \u00a0I would definitely recommend their Cali burritos (as I can't speak for anything else) and will definitely be back when in the area!Only MINOR \"issue\" is that it's located in a very tight plaza making parking a little difficult and some of the patrons were on the younger \"rowdy\" side (but they all ordered to-go). \u00a0However, when it comes to good food no issues with this place at all"], ["A J.", "Oh, ok den. Y'all \u00a0got that gudt taco. Best carne Asada fries and nachos I've ever had. Bellee dat. Holler at your manz an em."], ["John G.", "Solid 3 1/2 stars!While in San Diego, you gotta have the Cali Burrito and Carne Asada Fries. These are ubiquitos in San Diego as a summer fog in San Francisco. I've had my fair share of Cali Burritos and Carne Asada Fries in San Diego. I've also had better elsewhere - like Filiberto's comes to mind. Or maybe it was my druken stupor that made them taste better?Having said that, these are pretty good compares to the ones in the Bay. And you cannot beat the low, low prices. It's a local neighborhood joint that seems to be popular with the locals and that is good enough for me. Picked up 4 Cali Burritos (1 with Shrimp) and 1 Carne Asada Fries last night for dinner. Brought them back to the hotel and they were devoured within minutes. Plus I gotta mention the rockin' sauce that gave it that extra kick and flavor. If it wasn't for the sauce, I'd just rate them 3. I was sprinklin' that sh*t like gravy over fried chicken. Yup, it was finger lickin' good. Overall, a pretty good joint at cheap prices."], ["Brandy W.", "You know when you've fully integrated into the community when \u00a0you've found your neighborhood taco shop.I loved this place so much that I went back for dinner after eating brunch there a few hours ago.There is really nothing fancy about Ortiz. \u00a0The small strip mall has a handful of spots that you'll have to share with the thai shop, the donut shop, and the bagel shop. \u00a0With that said, I'm sure you can imagine the mornings are the busiest. \u00a0You order at the register and wait for your delicious meal to be called.The tortillas were the tastiest freshest tortillas I've tasted here so far! \u00a0Something as simple as a tortilla can completely sway a review! \u00a0The machaca was well mixed and perfectly proportioned. \u00a0I didn't taste an overwhelming flavor of egg or meat. \u00a0The carne asada fries were huge! \u00a0I like that there was a ton of different toppings instead of JUST carne asada and cheese. \u00a0 The best tacos come from the most humble of places. \u00a0This is definitely one of those places."]], "Mariscos El Pulpo": []}
