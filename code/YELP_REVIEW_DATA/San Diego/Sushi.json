Upon entering, the decor is classy without being intimidating, and we had no wait at all. The sushi bar is clean and open (no glass between you and the chefs), and everyone was very friendly.Ordered the plain edamame, salmon nigiri (this always sets the tone for me at a sushi restaurant), \u00a0the soft shell crab roll, house sake, and based on reviews from Yelp, the Kill Bill roll. Everything was just right! From texture to unique flavors, the quick service, and the prices, Akinori lives up to the hype.Recommendation: get the large house sake for $7. It is almost bottomless - our carafe had NINE pours!"], ["Heather C.", "Great sushi place as a special treat; as a student this place is normally out of my budget, but we took my BFF here for her birthday and she loved it.Staff was extremely warm and friendly (it was also Halloween night, shoutout to the awesome sushi chefs' costumes!), we had made reservations the night before and they were very accommodating when we had to push them back last minute.Food was excellent; takoyaki was delicious, as was my friend's ramen. I got the protein roll and the eel roll and both were excellent as well.They even brought my friend a free ice cream + creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for her birthday! Needless to say we tipped generously.Overall it was a lovely night, we'll come again for another celebration."], ["Mia L.", "I was torn between giving this place a four star and here is what happened:We arrived at the restaurant and yes understood we had no reservations.We asked the hostess how long, she said she doesn't know. I asked about the empty 4 seats at the bar she said it was reserved. Then I looked in the dining area there were 2 more tables that were opened. I assumed those were also reserved. Okay.. So then we asked how long, she said I don't know. Then she just looks at us. We said we will wait, and her response was to just look at us. Once again we said we will have to wait, and again she just looks at us. Then the third time I raise my voice and said do you need something from us? Then she decided to write our name down on a piece of receipt paper. 15 minutes past and of course those so call reserved tables are still empty.. 15 more minutes past and still those empty tables. Two couples waited with us. And then two more couples came and they decided not to wait. I was getting super impatient.I was pretty upset about their so call reservation rules. The bar should always be first come first serve since that area really is not great for more than a party of 3. One server saw my annoyed face and she then sat us at one of the 3 empty tables. That's about 45 minutes of wait. Well guess what? They filled those empty tables with people who were waiting with us. WTF why such a long decision.??We ordered the following:Spicy garlic edamame: it was goodFish tacos seared albacore w miso Chipotle Chili sauce salsa n crispy wonton: This was super duper good. Definitely never had something like this before. Very tasty. Anniversary Roll: Spicy scallop with seared yellowtail: It was good but didn't stand out too much.Assorted sashimi was also just okay, the highlight was the fish tacos.If this place was more organized from the beginning I don't believe we would have been waiting 45 minutes. Oh and guess what? You have probably guessed, when we left after we were done eating the bar with that. so call reserve section was still empty..At that time it was already late and I guess you can't predict no shows but it was obvious after 30 minutes having 3 empty tables were just plain unorganized.Definitely will try this place again one day, but if I have to wait after seeing empty tables again this place is going to get a 0 star."], ["Candace B.", "This review is for the sushi alone. The salmon sashimi was utterly disappointing, it tasted like it was straight up from Ralphs - I can distinguish fresh/properly prepared salmon sashimi from any ordinary uncooked one. I was disappointed that we spent $8 on 4 itty thinly sliced pieces for happy hour. We also ordered the only deep fried roll they had which was equally as bad. The salmon was way overcooked and flakey and yellowtail was mixed with green onions? I don't understand how this place has the rating that it has. If you love fresh sushi as much as I do, don't settle for this place - you're probably better off eating at Sushi Deli. Their food is over priced & overrated.I do like how generous they are with their mochi, I got 3 \u00a0peices cut in halves for $5 & that at least was pretty good."], ["John G.", "Probably my favorite place for Happy Hour and the menu was just expanded.

I tried a bite of my friend's roll, but it wasn't my thing. \u00a0He said he enjoyed them, although the heaping piles of fried onion on top was a little much for both of us. \u00a0The sashimi appetizer was delicious. \u00a0Nice cuts, very fresh, delicious combination with the truffle oil. \u00a0The omakase was also really nice-- the shrimp was still moving on my plate as I ate. \u00a0After finishing the sashimi, they deep fry the leftover mackerel skeleton and you can choose to have the shrimp head deep fried as well or have it used to flavor the broth in a bowl of miso soup. \u00a0The miso soup was very tasty. \u00a0I was a little hesitant about straying from my usual local sushi faves, but this place was actually very good. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["Lisa K.", "My favorite sushi place in the HIllcrest area!

Sitting outside in Hillcrest is nice, because people- and dog-watching can be quite entertaining. I'm uncertain of whether choosing one of the outdoor tables is what caused our service to be a bit slow, but the food was worth it. We ordered the Rainbow Roll and the Fire Breathing Dragon Roll, and both were absolutely delicious.

He then went to Surfside in PB before opening Akinori, his own place in Hillcrest. I no longer live in San Diego but when I visit I always make a special trip to Akinori to further my appreciation of the fine art of sushi. Tonight, I was not disappointed. From the marinated egg cake at the beginning of my journey to the green tea crem\u00e9 br\u00fbl\u00e9e at the end and the chef choices of sweet shrimp, fatty tuna, salmon, sea urchin, and at least ten more more exotic selections including clam, mackerel, a Japanese exotic root vegetable stuffed with urchin and a seafood custard usually not found outside of Japan sandwiched in between, this journey was, as always, oish\u012b (delicious.) In fact the run on sentence I just scribed is a reflection of the run on sushi choices Akison presented. The bottom line was $60/person. VERY REASONABLE. A tip for the Yelpaters (haters). Make a reservation. Let the chef know what you like and subsequently get to know you better. Let him prepare his buying and selections for you. \u00a0On one visit, a local Lobster fisherman delivered four live lobsters to Akison. He sashimi'd the tails for us and took the bodies into the kitchen and made an incredible lobster miso for us to enjoy 1/2 through that journey...And Yelpaters, no need to slander any merchant. Ask for your money back and don't return. It isn't your job to put them out of business. It is probably at least 50/50 that your miserable view of life lead to your perceived bad experience. Be glad no one is rating your on the job performance. You'd probably be averaging a 2...Akison, you rock (lobster)!"], ["Danielle M.", "Beast sushi I've ever had in my life!

First, the entire restaurant smelled like bleach. The smell was so strong, my nose and eyes were running and my husband started coughing five minutes into sitting down. Second, the service was really slow if you are not sitting at the bar. People who sat at the sushi bar after we were seated at our table were in and out of the restaurant before we were even served our first entrees (even though we ordered quickly).Third, the fish was not at all fresh. We ordered chirashi and hamachi sashimi and the fish in both items was rubbery and old tasting. Their rolls may be ok, but probably only taste better than the fish on its own because they are loaded with so many different sauces."], ["Mindy N.", "This place has great fresh sushi!

Definitely pricier than it should be.The sushi was not memorable and definitely nothing special. I would've given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the owner. I only exchanged a couple words with him, but man, I don't like him.First of all, he was on his cell phone, half the time we were there. It's not like he went off to the side where people can't really see him. He stood behind the sushi bar, in front of his customers (including us), just looking at something on his phone and scrolling for minutes at a time. And he didn't wash his hands after using his phone either. You're handling raw fish, you should probably be more conscious of what you are touching! Also, I heard him telling one of his employees that he was gonna give him a beer, which was gonna be on him. I am Japanese so yes, I can understand everything they say. Him and his employee are just chugging beer behind the sushi bar, in front of the guests. So unprofessional.I definitely will not be coming back here. -----I should probably mention that the white male sushi chef that actually made our sushi was great. He didn't really converse with us or anything, but he was actually professional and knowledgable. When I asked about the different kinds of fish they had, he told me the names of the fish in English and Japanese. Anyways. He deserves to be working in a more professional establishment."], ["Danielle R.", "The fish was fresh and delicious, prices were decent, and service was good. I would definitely come here again!

The conveyer belt sushi is a cool concept and amazes everyone who first sees it but after a few visits it could lose its charm.

That's something that makes it worth so many repeat visits.We stick with hand rolls and Geso (fried squid) and the odd roll or nigiri that passes by. Always order the hand rolls and Geso from the touch screen.Also our favorite server is Phuc who always is cheery and helpful."], ["Tiffany Y.", "I came here with my friend on a Friday around 1 for lunch and there was a 30 minute wait. I have been to a revolving sushi place in Irvine before but this one was way cuter and exciting . You can order from a screen or grab a plate from the fast moving convert belt. This restaurant made me sorely regret not going to conveyer belt sushi when I was in Japan. This was definitely the fastest conveyer belt sushi I have ever seen. You also get a reward if you eat 15 plates. My friend has been here plenty of times already and I'm never a fan of revolving sushi usually, but this place was really fresh ! Since there are so many people coming the sushi has a pretty high turnover rate. We had about 9 dishes, my favorite being the garlic ponzu tuna and the takoyaki!! This restaurant is pretty affordable unless you are eating alot, but the bill was $24 for 2 ppl. I think I would come here again but only if it was less crowded I don't think I would want to wait so long if I was so hungry ."], ["Chang L.", "Taste- ***Service- ****Ambiance- ****Parking- * Fun, fun, fun! This concept is super duper fun! Moving to Japan in a few months and thought I'd give this place a try. You just sit around and watch all the plates go by and pick off what you want. The waitress comes around and teaches you how to use \"Mr. Fresh\" lol! For every 5 plates you eat you watch a little cartoon clip on the screen above your table, and when you eat 15 you get a little toy. Helping the little ninja slay the demon definitely had me eat the extra 3 plates I didn't want to eat. The sushi isn't awesome, but it's not bad. It's just a fun place to go. The wait is usually pretty long and the parking royally sucks. Fun to go with friends once in a while."], ["Raechel S.", "Great place for a date night! \u00a0 You get to pick as few or as many plates as you want, all for 2.25 a plate. \u00a0 \u00a0For every 15 plates, you get a \"prize\" :) \u00a0 \u00a0I love that we aren't rushed, get to have the feeling of it being a date night and still get fabulous food. \u00a0 \u00a0We can't wait to come back!"], ["Patricia M.", "We've been a fan of Kula even before it opened a location down here in San Diego. We've been to several of their locations up in LA county and the idea of revolving sushi in a conveyor belt along with it's novelty and affordability was a really big hit. Obviously, since this place is the only one in San Diego county, wait can be really long especially during peak hours. My suggestion: go really early or really late. For $2.25 per plate, you can't really go wrong. Try as many different types of nigiri, rolls, hand rolls that your little heart desires. The good thing is, with per plate order - you're not stuck eating the full roll of sushi you ordered.Me and the hubby really enjoyed their hand rolls - spider hand roll and spicy yellow tail. Salmon belly is a must! If you don't feel like waiting for the sushi to go around and make it's way to you, you can also order from their tablet menu and it'll be ready in no time. Service is good here. They are all attentive. Kula is always on our rotating list of restos we go to in Convoy area. Don't forget the Japanese Soy Milk Donuts w/ ice cream. Perfect way to end your dinner!"], ["Wanting H.", "I finally came and tried out this place! It has been on my \"to-try\" list for a long time since its opening. However, the long wait line has always detered me from visiting. This time, I was determined! I arrived early around 5:50 pm and used their very convenient Koybee system to sign in. Surprisingly, we got our table around 6. We were very lucky that we only waited 10 mins! That was a very good first impression compared to other people's experience. I like the set-up of this place. It's good to have both table and bar for different type of groups. The conveyor belt runs through all seating so everyone has a chance to see what they are offering. Furthermore, they have the special ordering system that allows you to order a specific sushi of your choice. The order will come on the top conveyor belt right to our table. Since it was our first time there, the waitress gave us a little bit of introductions before we began our dinning experience. She even pointed out how they count plates by sliding it down the return slot. When you reach 15 plates, you will receive a small prize from the top! Overall, their service was great! The waitress was friendly and always around for more water and tea. Okay, now to the important part of the dinning experience, the food! We ordered a total of 11 plates and 1 dessert: Crispy rice with spicy tuna, Salmon, Eel, Conch, Tamago, Hokkaido scallop, Garlic tuna steak, Spider hand roll, Masago, Salmon cheek, Octopus, and Mango/green tea mochi. Overall, the sushi was better than expected. I heard from several friends that their sushi is definitely not the best in town, which is somewhat expected because their high volume and low price. So, I came in here more for the experience than really high-end sushi. To be really honest, their sushi is probably a 3-star for me. It's good that they have wide variety of sushi items, wide range of rolls, and even dessert options. But, their fish quality is so-so. Nothing that will wow you if you are a true sushi lover. The ratio between rice and fish was actually pretty good compared to many sushi restaurants trying to stuff you with lots of rice and very little fish. My favorite of the night was actually Hokkaido scallop sushi. The balance between rice and scallop was just right. The texture of the scallop was very smooth. The flavor of scallop was elevated with each bite of rice. Excellent piece! The rest of items was okay. Nothing too surprise or over the top. My recommendation is to try as many different items as possible so you get a full experience. For the price of $2.25 per plate, you have plenty of room to sample many items and definitely get full at the end of dinner. For the dining experience, it is definitely a 4-star place! I recommend coming for the fun experience and reasonably priced sushi."], ["Romulus T.", "This place is awesome!!The unique ordering system and huge menu makes this a must-try place. \u00a0I especially enjoy the seared salmon with Japanese mayo and the soy donuts with ice cream.The parking is tough and the bill adds up quick, but this place is definitely worth a try."], ["Michelle V.", "This place is a fun place to eat at! You can choose different type of sushi items on a conveyor belt for $2.25. Or you can order items on the iPad on the right/left side of the booth. I recommend ordering on the iPad because they make it as you order. You can grab items on the conveyor belt but you won't know how long the food has been sitting there for. They also offer ramen ($4.80) and surprisingly it's really delicious. Even though they are small but the broth has tons of flavor.On the iPad screen it keeps track of the number of played you have ate and for every 5 plates it has a little show of ninjas. For every 15 plates you get a little prize. My favorite would be: garlic tuna steak, seared salmon, spider handroll, sea urchin, toro, tonkotsu ramen. Before they had a sign in sheet and a long wait list, now you sign in on an iPad and it tells you how many parties are ahead of you. Usually on weekdays its a 20 min wait and on weekends it's an hour wait. Parking can be difficult here since its in the same plaza of dumpling inn and jasmine. So try to park on the street to avoid crazy drivers. Service here is pretty much nonexistent. They give you a presentation on how Mr. Fresh works and from there it's self-serve. If you need any assistance, just press the assistance button and they will come to your aid. Overall, I like coming here. I love how I can try any sushi I want and order anything that catches my eye."], ["Angel L.", "Great deals, I love that you can make special orders if they're out of something or you'd like to have it fresh.

The food is great and everything about this place screams efficiency, which really appeals to the process analyst inside me.Scotty warned me that the wait time here can be insane, so when I invited my friends to go out with me and over 10 people RSVP'd to my Facebook event, I was freaking out a little bit. Luckily, I have some pretty organized friends, so we were able to split the group up into 3 different tables. We could have gotten away with two tables (6 people per table), so note that if you're planning on bringing a large group.We arrived at 11 and there was already a huge crowd outside. We were #13, 14, and 15 on the list and we were seated around 12 once some of the initial parties had left. Once we were seated, we got a quick tutorial on how Mr. Fresh works and our drinks delivered and left to eat at our own pace. The main revolving bar is at shoulder level, with a custom order conveyor below above that for any individual orders you want to come fresh.Above both conveyor belts is an iPad that allows you to place orders and keep track of the number of plates you have eaten. There's also a game that gives you a prize for every 15 plates your table eats. I got a Mr. Fresh Hello Kitty phone charm that plugs into my auxiliary port - it's so cute! :) Note that the prizes are random - Scotty came here with some of her other friends and all they got were notepads. They were kind of disappointed about that.On to the food! I'm not a big sushi fan (raw fish is pretty squishy..), but Cam's been getting me into salmon and avocado rolls, so I was pretty stoked to see that they had spicy salmon rolls. I had about 3 plates of those alone. I also tried the toro (limited quantities), which was really fresh and had a buttery texture to it. I also tried the spicy salmon with crispy rice, but thought that the rice was a little too crispy for me. The best part was the fresh (I think?) wasabi they bring out at the beginning. I've never had wasabi that didn't taste metallic, so this was definitely a plus in the experience. It also tasted spicier than typical wasabi served with sushi.Overall, I will definitely be bringing people to Kula again. Although a lot of revolving sushi bars get a bad rep for a lack of freshness, everything I ate seemed really fresh and delicious. I also loved that everything was really efficient - we basically did everything ourselves on the iPad."], ["Pat L.", "I finally got in after passing by for like forever! It was Monday around 2pm and I got in only 3 minutes wait time!Parking wasn't a problem because it was a Monday but if it were other days, you'd probably have to find parking far on the street. The server took our drink order, explained the system of ordering and eating. We never saw her again until it was time for the bill. Didn't really need her for anything anyway. Everything was pretty self-explanatory. Signs were conveniently posted throughout our table.We ate a little off the revolving belt and a little off the menu (top belt). Got to 15 and joila! A prize! It was fun and I'm stuffed. Total bill was around $38 for 2. Tipped them well but not knowing whom or what I was tipping. Maybe for the entertainment. Will definitely be seeing this place often as long as my craving for sushi remains on Mondays."], ["Alice T.", "I didn't get the hype at first... who cares? It's a revolving sushi bar. But after going, I can see the appeal. It's actually pretty fun. And it's more technologically advanced than other revolving sushi bars I've been to, from the check-in monitor for putting your name down to the plate dispenser. Plus, the food is pretty good!HOW IT WORKS- All plates are $2.25 unless marked. The exceptions are things like miso soup ($2) or certain appetizers/entrees.- You can either grab the plate as it comes around or you can use the touch screen at your table to order things if you don't want to wait. Please follow the directions on how to take the plate out. I glare at people who use it improperly and get their grubby hands all over the plate protector.- Drop used plates through the chute and that's how your total is calculated.- Every 15 plates that you drop through the chute gets you one of those bubble containers prizes of junk like mini notepads. (Yeah, I'm an old grouch.)THE WAITLess than 15 minute wait if you go right at 11am opening on a weekday. The wait at 5pm on a Sunday was about an hour. It's pretty bad.THE GOOD STUFFNigiri is two pieces/plate+++ Yellowtail, Salmon Belly, Garlic Ponzu Tuna, Umami Oil Salmon, Seared Scallop with Japanese Mayo, Soy Sake Marinated TunaThere are some more expensive cuts like Bluefin Tuna or Toro that comes one piece/plate.Rolls are okay. + Spider is huge, California roll comes with real crabHand rolls are pretty good sized, these have to be ordered. Since they are made fresh, the seaweed is usually nice and crispy. The Spicy Shrimp Taco is the only one that comes out on the conveyor belt and should be avoided, because the seaweed is usually soggy. If you want this one, order it from the screen.+++ Spicy Yellowtail, Spicy ScallopWEIRD STUFF TO TRYThis is the stuff I have never seen before but were surprisingly good.- Sunomono- best described as a cucumber salad with sashimi. If you like cucumber salad marinated in vinegar, you'll probably like this dish, since it's just the fancier version. It comes with tamago, cuts of fish, octopus/squid, and seaweed. Pretty refreshing.- Tuna or Salmon Yukhoe- tartare in an upright maki roll topped with an egg yolk. I found this to be way too rich with the egg, but tartare lovers may really like this one.Have fun and try some new stuff!"], ["Christina M.", "I've been here twice now and love it. The atmosphere is very fun and makes you want to eat more. If you eat 15 plates you win a prize. The wait is always out the door but it moves pretty fast. They have quick service and a lot of options. You know this place is good when actual Japanese people come."], ["Jodi C.", "Wowsa this was delicious and extremely visually engaging. \u00a0I went once to a similar style restaurant in Japan and was happy to see it here. \u00a0 \u00a0The food was excellent and addictive. \u00a0No one wanted to stop. \u00a0The prizes for ordering more food felt a little condescending but alas the animations were cute."], ["David T.", "I was pretty excited to dine here. I can't say I was let down, but I didn't leave feeling I got what I paid for.You check-in using a tablet that's outside near their door - you put in your info, phone number, and then you'll receive a text when your table is ready. Pretty neat.Their menu is extensive, running the gamut from specialty rolls to nigiri to hot foods (ramen, takoyaki, etc.) The food is constantly revolving (obviously) BUT if you're craving something and don't feel like it'll come around anytime soon, you can use their handy touch-screen menu that's in front of you (if you're at the bar style seats) or to your left/right (if you're in a booth), and when it's ready it will come right to you on a separate conveyor belt above the rotating sushi.Out of everything I had to eat, I have to say the crunchy hand roll was my favorite. Everything else tasted pretty standard - probably a bit too cold for my liking. I understand that since the food is constantly on rotation that it should be kept cool, but I felt it took away from the flavor. Even their soy sauce tasted off to me; their ponzu was unlike any ponzu I've ever had, i.e., I did not like their ponzu at all. The ginger is kept in this little box on your table, so that's a plus if you're a ginger lover.Looking back, I should've ordered way more hand rolls.They have a few options that aren't $2.25 a plate, e.g., the ramen runs $4.00 if I remember correctly. Why? Because it's bigger - it's a standard size bowl of ramen. If you require assistance/service then you select it from the menu as well. In any case, you get a small trinket for every 15 plates you eat and discard into the slot (they recommend that everyone put their plate into ONE hole to increase the overall number). Honestly, it's cute and all, but not really worth TRYING to get to 15/30/etc.The delivery of the food is sanitary though, as each plate is covered before you grab it. That's definitely a plus.At the end of the day I can say that it was a cool experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon - especially since we came at a good time and our wait was 33 minutes. The first time I tried to eat here, the wait was roughly 2 hours. I'm definitely glad I didn't wait my first time."], ["Patrina C.", "I love Kula! This place is fun and just easy to enjoy. You can pick whatever plates that goes by you on a conveyor belt. It's 2.25 per plate or you can also order from the screen on top on your table. It reminds me of sushi places in Japan. The only downside is the wait. Come early to avoids the crowd."], ["Amanda R.", "Lots of fun! Great experience! The sushi was good but could have been a little more chilled. Also, wish it was a little more clean. The touch screen, table and plates were all very greasy and smudgy!The garlic seared tuna steak was amazing!So fun that you get a sushi prize with 15 plates (not hard to do)!We got there just in time. Arrived at 4:45 and waited about 10 minutes. When we left the line was nuts!Looking forward to our next visit!"], ["Sarah Marie D.", "Oooooohhh! Ahhhhhhhh! Something new?! Well, if you've been to the other Kula locations, this wouldn't be new to you (I do love the Irvine location). HOWEVER, the absolute treasures at this San Diego location are the CUTE prizes and iPad entertainment that come with every 15 plates of sushi you devour! What?! What?! Rewards for eating yummy sushi??? YES! I mean if you're hungry and planned to eat lots of sushi anyway, then might as well get a reward for your consistent chewing :D We have shared this San Diego Hot-Spot with many family members and close friends and they have always enjoyed it here! The sushi isn't your grade A fancy-shmancy sushi (it's $2.25 a plate for goodness sakes!) but it's still delicious!If it's your FIRST TIME here, READ ON for tips!Don't come too hungry here because there's no going around the fact that you should always anticipate a line! There's always a wait here and in the beginning (during the first few months of opening), there was a write-your-name-partynumber-and-wait-for-your-name-to-be-called system. But that got too crazy so they have an electronic sign-in now with a stationary iPad. As you walk toward the entrance, head for the iPad hanging near the entrance doors, then swiftly sign-in with your information :) it'll give you an estimated wait time and also send you a notification on your cell phone. I'd say the shortest we've had to wait was 30 minutes but ... we just got lucky, because sometimes the parties before you just give up! They probably came here SUPER hungry and that's the first no-no I shared with you! :D YOU'RE WELCOME! Here are my recommended plates:-Seared Salmon with Japanese Mayo sushi (LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE)-Salmon Sushi-Kula Sushi Roll (they use real crab meat!)-DESSERT: Soy Milk Donuts (it comes with ice cream and honey and OMG DELICIOUS!! MY FAVORITE! It doesn't count as a \"plate\" but worth every penny!) :DENJOY!!!!!!!"], ["Denise T.", "I am in complete awe of this Kula location! I've been a fan of Kula for a while now because of my previous experience at their Irvine location, but the SD location takes the cake!!They make eating sushi fun here. The sushi comes in 2-4 pieces at $2.25 per plate and arrive via a conveyor belt. You get to pick and choose each smaller sized selection, which gives you the opportunity to try a bit of everything. They also serve ramen, mochi, Japanese donuts, etc etc BUT instead of a waiter/waitress bringing it to you, the items arrive on their electric sliding countertop. So cool! Also if you want, let's say, a rainbow roll but don't want to wait for it to arrive via the conveyor belt which might take awhile, you can order your desired item on the screen and it will arrive within minutes. You also get a prize for every 15 plates you finish. It's a cute little magnet replica of their sushi selections. Yes, the wait was horrendous. We waited for 1 hour and 10 minutes (it was a Friday at 7:30pm when we signed in). I can understand this because Kula is the ONLY revolving sushi bar in SD... yes SD is behind when it comes to this! What we did was we dropped someone off to sign us in, then we went around looking for parking. Yes, aside from the long wait, parking also extremely sucks. Once you have your name called though, you forget about the wait and will find yourself completely mesmerized by Kula."], ["Tim L.", "Adorable sushi place! Great for entertaining some friends. The sushi is decent, but if you're entertained by bright lights, loud noises and have little impulse control like myself, then you're gonna have a fun time :) . AND every ~10 dishes, the iPad you can order from shows a video and gives you a toy! Granted the toy is like a key chain, but it really makes the whole thing a fun experience!"], ["Ellre V.", "I've been meaning to try Kula for awhile now after always seeing the crowd of people waiting by the door. This past weekend I finally did! I stopped by this past Sunday at around 11am. For a party of two, the wait was about 30 minutes. n00bs, all you have to do is walk up to the front door and enter in the following on the reservation ipad: your name, your phone number, # of people in your party, and your seating preference. That's it! You'll automatically receive a text message with a link to the approximate wait time and how many parties are ahead of you. Super convenient, I was already becoming a fan of the place. You can also cancel your reservation from your phone...which I unfortunately did because my boyfriend was feeling ill.We returned around 9pm the same day, an hour before closing, and the wait was about 25 minutes still. I took the advice from one of my fellow yelpers, and headed to Shanghai Saloon to grab a drink while we waited for our number to be called. I second this tip, the wait went by so much quicker. Eventually we were seated and since it was our first time, the waitress explained how to remove a plate from the sushi conveyer belt and order from the iPad up above if what you desire isn't on the belt. Once she was done demonstrating, taking our drink order, and pointing out the specials, we were free to start ordering and eating immediately!Everything tasted so fresh and I was impressed by the swiftness of the order delivery. I'll definitely be back, it's worth the wait!"], ["Erica B.", "I've come here twice now! I absolutely love this place. So much fun and the staff is so nice. The gifts you win are sooo cute!!!"], ["Laura B.", "What a fun experience my daughter had a blast she such a big sushi eater and have it come on the belt was a neat experience for her. The food was good and the prices are great. We will be coming back for sure"], ["Phoebe C.", "Can't believe I haven't rated this place. Food selection can be limited and the wait is annoying, but the combo of experience and food makes it worthy of 5 stars. \u00a0Experience:I've been to other Kula's and they don't have anything on this location. Through the meal, your tables fights and defeats ninjas depending on how many plates you consume. Every 5 plates consumed prompts a cute animation on the screen. Consume 15 plates, and you get a mini sushi magnet. From customer orders to conveyor belt, the meal experience is super fun. My friends and I concluded you can bring a boring dinner date here and have a good time. Only downside is the wait can be horrendous, so I guess that foils that plan. Food:For sashimi, my faves are the un-marinated sashimi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail). For gunkan maki, I love the sea urchin, salmon roe, and tuna/salmon yukhoe. For sides, I like the inari (tofu skin). For dessert, the green tea mochi ice cream is bomb. Skip on the warabimochi, fried takoyaki, and watermelon (lol). Parking: Sucks. You're lucky if you find lot parking but do try. If not, find street parking on the adjacent industrial streets. Definitely not as bad as downtown SD or LA...just annoying."], ["Courtney S.", "I'd LIKE to give it five stars, but as all other reviews before have said, this wait is pretty dang long. This is about as \"authentic\" as it gets to the rotating sushi bars I went to when I lived in Japan (where plates usually cost only 100\u00a5 ($1.00) as opposed to the $2.25 here). Everything was super fresh, albeit sliced pretty thinly for the more popular items (I'm looking at you salmon and tuna). My husband had never been to one of these places before, and is iffy about most sushi, so it was great for him to be able to pick and chose new things to try without worrying too much about the price, compared to the $4-7 you usually see at normal sushi restaurants for their two pieces of nigiri. I am new to the San Diego area and haven't heard of or found anything else like this (lucky for them on that rotating sushi jeopardy!), and will be returning FREQUENTLY! All in all, you had to roll me out of the restaurant and I was very satisfied! Two thumbs waaaay up!"], ["Cathy H.", "Was very excited to see this place open in San Diego because I loved going to one in Orange County when I lived up there.. First off this place is very small for the hype of the place. \u00a0Love the app. You have to put your name on the app outside. Huge wait. our friend got there at 6, we didn't get called til 745. Food: the food on the conveyer belt looked old even at prime hour where it was super busy. It wasn't tasty, but it was cheap. Two people for $40 and we got everything we wanted. Eel sauce was watery. I have never seen it watery before. It's usually too thick if anything! The spicy mayo was delicious though. Not much of an alcohol selection. Glad we tried it but won't be back. I would prefer to pay a little more for outstanding sushi."], ["Thuong T.", "3.5 STARSOf course everyone should eat here at least once just for the awesome experience of rotating sushi plates! But in general, some dishes here are good, and most are just okay.You have the choice of table seating or bar seating.If you have a group of people and are sharing the same bill, then you use one touchscreen. If you are paying separately, then use more than one touchscreen.Me and one friend used the same touchscreen but had the bill split in half.Really easy concept here.The sushi plates rotate around the whole restaurant. When you see something that you like, simply gently grab the plate off. After you're done with the plate, place the plate through the open slot on your table.If you don't see what you want, you can order it on the touchscreen and it will be sent out to you on a conveyor belt.You can keep track of the number of plates you have ordered on the touchscreen menu as well.ALL GREEN PLATES ARE $2.25 each.Everything else has their own prices that are shown on the touchscreen.***For every 15 green plates you finish, you get a prize!A prize dispenser drops a little gift to you right under the touchscreen. It's just a cute little sushi keychain, which I personally don't think its worth trying to get, but I guess it's cool you get something if you really do eat that many plates.ShrimpTemperua Udon Noodle Soup $4.99All their udon/ramen bowls here are mini sizes!! Hence the cheap prices btw!!Even though they're small and super simple, they are actually really good!Miso Soup $2.00They give a little bit more seawood and tofu than most places which is nice.Japanese Soy Milk Donut & Ice Cream $2.80DELICOUS!!!! Definitely recommend this dessert. The donut is served warm. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Goes great with the ice cream.Some of my favorite dishes:Garlic Tuna SteakTuna YukhoeSpicy Tempura Shrimp TacoCrispy Rice with Spicy SalmonCrispy Rice with Spicy TunaEverything else is really really basic.But I learned that in Japan, all their sushi dishes are all basic (according to us) but are higher quality fish. Over here in the U.S., we're more spoiled and add a bunch of extra toppings and stuff to the sushi rolls to make them fancy thus, most specialty rolls here are considered \"americanized\".So I guess you can say this place is more authentic Japanese. All in all, cool experience. Okay food."], ["Jackie A.", "This place is cool, but you are better off going to RB sushi, for the money aspect. If you want to have a fun experience this place is awesome.My favorite roll here was the ponzu salmon roll, so damn buttery. Between two people you will probably eat around 15-20 plates unless you're a savage then you'll eat way more. This was my first time here because there's always usually a wait. I would come back but it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice. Another thing I didn't really like was that no one really came around to refill our drinks and the sushi rice was dry. This place is alright ! Fun experience."], ["Lisa W.", "Just like Japan there's a revolver all around the restaurant! I love that you can also order anything on the iPad. Be prepare to wait, there's always a line! And make sure your party is all there or they won't seat you. And if they call you 5x then you get kick out of the line and have to put your name on it again. Also there's a window... If you go at 5-5:30 you can be seated right away, anything after that be prepare to wait at least 20 minutes.It's cute and fun to eat here. They have covers for those germaphobe (me) and everything is probably fresh because they have a high turnover. Press down and lift the plates and eat! Then dispose of plates in the dispenser so they can count. 15 plates and you get a little toy. Along the way they have short clips if you make it to a certain plate. They def make it fun for adults and kids. Sushi- Only $2.50 a plate... I wouldn't say it's the best quality but not the worst. Some of the sashimi can be better like the yellowtail and salmon. The octopus, tuna and raw sweet shrimp was excellent! We got some rolls, ramen, popcorn shrimp and Karaage. Ramen was decent, popcorn shrimp was good but yeh Karaage was horrible. Not fried right and then breaking was too soft. Stick with the sashimi or rolls! I would only come back if I didn't have to wait. Which I didn't. But I can see the wait being ridiculous because my friend and I were there for a good ole hour and a half. And also think sushi doesn't really get you full unless you eat a lot! Try it once, have fun!"], ["Linda D.", "Surprise you just ate 15 plates of sushi and got a prize for eating.I love revolving sushi bars, especially after living in Hawaii and having them readily available. The concept of Kula Sushi of rewarding their customers with a prize if you eat 15 plates of flat rate $2.25. Items priced more or less than the $2.25 do not count towards gaining a prize.The ramen and udon are tasty here. I like that this sushi bar has quite a list of items available. And that you can order them on the pad to have them delivered to your table. I think this eliminates some of your wait time from being served.The food tasted good, not 100% sure yet if it is worth the wait and hassle of the limited parking. The novelty of a bunch of plays rolling by on a conveyor belt, online order pad, delivery on another conveyor belt and pac man like plate covers that open and close their mouth and the plate depository is a plus. I like the fresh watermelon here. Nice option as a dessert item."], ["Lauren G.", "Kula is so fun! Grab a plate. Eat it. Put it down the slot. They have a ton of nigiri to choose from. All types of salmon, tuna, roe. This is not a roll spot if that's what you are expecting. I do wish they have a few more \"rolls\" to choose from. They offer regular rainbow, Phili, crunchy. The screen makes it really easy to order something that you haven't had a chance to taste yet!The servers are attentive and are happy to explain the process if you are a first timer."], ["Apolo O.", "Went in for lunch today (Wed). I arrived at 11:05 and did not have to wait. By 11:15 all the tables were taken. They have a touch pad outside of the door to enter your name and receive \u00a0a number if there is a wait. The staff will ask if you have been there before, I had not so someone comes over and provides direction on how to remove the plates from the coveyor, order food on the touch pad and dispose of your used plates. Ordered the miso soup to start off then mixed it up between pulling plates off the conveyor and ordering from the touchpad, ordered food arrives on another conveyor just above the other. \u00a0If you're not careful you can really rack up your plates and tab but you will be satisfied. Lively ambiance, friendly staff, good food - overall great experience."], ["Tran N.", "Kula has been opened for a few months but the wait is still crazy long. For a party of 3, it was about an hour wait. But as soon as we were seated we got our drinks menu and were able to start getting our food right away. The goods: Salmon belly, Soy Sake marinated salmon, Albacore, Yellowtail, Umami oil Salmon, and the soy sake tuna. I thought the rolls were mediocre, it was really small. The Kula, Salmon skin, Eel and Red dragon was okay. I would not get it again. So I guess the concept is good, your whole party and get whatever they want without having to compromise. There's literally no wait for food except there's a long wait for a table. The nigiri are great, except the rice kept falling apart for me. And the fish cuts are inconsistent, some were really thin and others were perfect. I must mention though the wasabi is fresh! It was really good, I used less than what I normally would. And parking is terrible..."], ["Jocy C.", "Kula Revolving Sushi Bar is addictive! \u00a0Addictive in a video game sense, not the food. \u00a0 \u00a0The sushi itself is pretty good for the price (every plate is $2.25 including toro and uni). \u00a0Again, you get what you pay for. \u00a0It's not the best quality of toro or uni.A few faves:- Salmon Yukhoe- Garlic Ponzu SalmonThe concept of the restaurant is pretty neat. \u00a0Each party gets to sit at the bar or in a booth (for larger parties). \u00a0All sushi is served in its own container which is then sent along a conveyor belt throughout the whole restaurant. \u00a0Each party grabs what type sushi they want off the conveyor belt. \u00a0Easy!Each seat at the bar and each booth has its own touch screen monitor to order food on the side. \u00a0We ordered miso soup as well as mochi ice cream off the touch screen monitor. \u00a0Quick and easy!The addictive part is the part where the empty sushi plates must be entered into a slot at each seat at the bar and booth. \u00a0That's how your total tab is calculated - by how many empty plates is entered into the slot. \u00a0I swear.... we ate more than necessary because we wanted to keep entering empty plates into the slot. \u00a0Every 5 plates, there is a \"level up\" adventure type on the touch screen monitor. \u00a0Because of that, we ended up eating 20 plates of sushi between the 2 of us. \u00a0We kept wanting to see what would happen at each \"level up\" / 5 plates.Tip 1: \u00a0If lines are long, go to the bakery side of Jasmine Seafood Restaurant to grab \u00a0a few snacks to tie you over, so that you aren't so hangry (hungry + angry) waiting in line. \u00a0For us, we arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday and waited 1.5 hours with at least 18 parties on the waiting list ahead of us. \u00a0Crazy! \u00a0Link - yelp.com/biz/jasmine-sea\u2026Tip 2: \u00a0Park on a side street if possible. \u00a0Parking spaces are ridiculously small at this plaza. \u00a0There is a parking attendant that specifically looks out for people that have accidents as well as guide people on how to park into the spots (especially if there is an SUV in the next spot).Food: \u00a03 starsExperience: \u00a05 stars (esp. if you're into video games)!"], ["Teresa N.", "The revolving part is not new to me for where I grew up. Anyway yes it is \"a\" way of how they serve sushi in Japan but I think the quality of the food is way more important.Quality of sushi at Kula is average, every single rice ball I had fell apart. Fish on the nigiri was small and thin. I think on average each person will spend 25 to 30 dollars on food here? Like 10 plates per person. Obviously you can spend the same amount for better quality AYCE at RB sushi.Here is the worst part, we came here at 7pm on a Friday night, we wrote down the name for a table. It was so ridiculously packed and chaotic outside the restaurant so we went to Shanghai Saloon next door for a drink (but we came back every 30 min to check). I am skipping the details anyway they called our name 3 times and we got kicked out of the line.

I wouldn't come here for date night just because the wait is so long!Overall great food, friendly staff, good atmosphere!"], ["Katrina L.", "Went here the other weekend to see what the buzz was all about. Solely based on the fun and experience, this would be a solid 5 star review, but sadly the quality and wait times were just not quite worth it. Not to mention the parking situation.. Parking sucks..flat out. Small shared lot and many spots are reserved for the other businesses. Park on the street, or in a different lot if you can. Walk up to the masses huddled around the door waiting for their magic number to be called and there's a tablet to the right of the door to enter in all your information. The system then assigns you a number along with a wait time. Cool first impression, efficient too, but then we were assigned our number and realized our wait time would be an hour and a half... merp. Decided to venture across the street to Carmax, we were bored and needed to kill time! Finally get a text that our number is almost up. I guess what you could do instead is swing by to put your name in then venture out to do errands..even when they text you it's still about a 20ish minute way before your number is called..at least for us it was. The cool thing too is that the original text assigning your number includes a link to the system website to see what number they're currently on as well. Finally get seated at the bar and given the whole spiel of how it works, what to do, etc. I really liked that all the plates are the same price, whereas other revolving sushi bars have different plate colors for different prices. The system they have is pretty efficient, grab a plate and then just toss it in the dispenser which keeps track of your plate count. There's some ninja theme and it's like each plate helps the ninja or something like that. I was more entertained by the revolving sushi to be paying attention to the story line to be honest. There's plenty of choices, and if you don't want to wait for the sushi to make its way to you, you can always order direct from the screen which then comes on a separate conveyor belt straight to your seating area. Oh my, word of advice-pace yourself! I got a little too excited and went to town too quick, I was grabbing plates left and right.. oops! The sushi itself is alright, it's not super fresh which is understandable since they sit and rotate around the place. You can see the sushi chefs just preparing them in bulk and have them sitting waiting to refill empty spots. Don't get me wrong, the sushi was good considering the circumstances and pricing, but it would have added to the experience if it was reallllly good and fresh sushi...hence the three star review. My favorites were the seared beef nigiri and the seared scallop nigiri. We also tried the ramen for somewhere around $4. Again, it was just alright.. not worth trying unless you're really craving some soup. We ended with some mochi ice cream which was good, I mean how can you go wrong with mochi?!Anyway, once you reach 15 plates you get a prize! We got a small sushi magnet, but saw that other prizes were cellphone keychains and other small trinkets.Once you're done, just check out on the screen and they bring you your bill. It's somewhat hard to comment on the service since it's almost all screen based and DIY. The staff was friendly though. So at the end of the day would I come back here? Sure! buuuut I would't wait more than 45ish minutes, and I'd only come for the fun of it.. not if I were actually craving some good sushi. It's definitely a fun place to take younger kids or even friends/family who are visiting from out of town. Again, great experience, but mediocre food."], ["Michelle M.", "It took me 3 times to actually sit down and experience this place. Why? Because of the crazy long lines! Whenever I've tried to put my name down, there were at least 1.5 full sheets until my name would be called. On the third try, we came for lunch. The restaurant opened at 11:30am, but we arrived at 11:00am. And there were already people on the list. By the time the doors opened, the listed already grew on to half way the 2nd page. Crazy!We were seated at a booth and our server introduced us to Mr. Fresh. Apparently, he would be our good friend and keep our sushi fresh and clean from other people's germs. I'm all for that since I've seen terrible things at other revolving sushi places. There were two conveyor belts - one for the revolving sushi and the other for special orders you can choose from the touch screen. The 2nd conveyor belt is pretty cool thing to experience if you order something from the menu.Each revolving sushi plate is $2.25. Every 5 plates, you will get an animation on the touch screen, which makes the experience interactive. Every 15 plates, you will get a prize. The sushi itself wasn't too bad and at the same time, it wasn't that great. Also, watch out for the wasabi - it is potent!!! A little goes a long way. Trust me, I learned.3.5 stars for long lines and okay sushi, but a novelty experience for San Diegans."], ["Lux S.", "We waited for about half an hour around 5pm on a weekday. There were about ten parties ahead of us but it went by pretty fast. Beware of this wait that may go for about an hour or two! The place itself is quite small.I was so thrilled to finally get to try this place out. The plates on the conveyor belt are hard not to pass up, you want to grab them all! All plates are 2.25 except for a few of them and they easily add up considering you grab them at your expense. The wasabi is dangerous so be careful! It is so fresh my ears were letting out steam!Their options vary but you might not favor the place if you're into crazy or eclectic rolls. Most of the plates are of nigiri or simple rolls. I appreciate a good fish and rice so for me it was heaven. All of the salmon nigiri, tuna and the beef was so fresh and decadent. You get a little prize if you eat 15 plates which is a lot but easy to get if you're dining with your family. From the screen above you can order items such as ramen, handrolls and dessert. There is something for everyone! I love kula!"], ["Audrey C.", "5++++ stars for the experience! WahOoOooOo!! Now I've been to revolving sushi bars before, but none like this! This was so high tech. It's so awesome how you can order extra things from the iPad and it speeds on through the conveyor belt above right to you! It was really entertaining putting in plates into the dispenser 5 at a time because you get to watch a cute little short on the iPad! I don't want to give it away, but it is extremely cute!We were so close to going somewhere else to eat when the hostess told us that the wait would be 1.5-2 hours. Well, she was right on the ball and accurate at least! It was smart that she overestimated rather than underestimated, like most hostesses have done in other restaurants. But you know what, we drove 63 miles for this! So we stuck it out. This is the longest we have ever waited for food and I truly believe the experience is all worth the wait. Our drive was much shorter than the wait, but man would we go here again? HECK YAHH!4 stars for the food and the 1.5 hour wait the boyfriend and I had to suffer through. Sushi was really yummy and always fresh! Love their Mr. Fresh concept of keeping the sushi bacteria free! It's cool that that's only exclusive to Kula since they're the ones who created this \"Mr. Fresh\" thing! The server explains everything to you when you're a first timer. Which btw, Phuc, our server with short hair and green highlights, was so friendly and awesome!!! She was really great.Getting through 15 plates with just 2 people was actually really challenging. I tried to pace myself so I wouldn't barf because too much sushi = an unhappy tummy (for me, at least!). We were determined to get the prize and sure enough we did! We got a cute tuna magnet :3My favorite would have to be the tiger roll. The popcorn shrimp roll was great too - love the crunch and sauce! The crispy rice with crab was also tasty! I think that was my 2nd favorite thing there. Great crunchy texture with flavorful crab/spicy mayo. Kula roll was good too, especially since I'm a fan of torched salmon. I wasn't feeling the sauce on the shrimp & avocado roll though. I love shrimp & avocado together and I was disappointed that that overpowering sauce all over it ruined it for me. Crunch roll & golden crunch roll were also good! California roll with real crab was oh so fresh and yummy! Crazy how real crab makes so much of a difference. I'm not a fan of nigiri because it makes me feel sick, so we didn't grab any of those plates. Basically, everything here is mm mmm GOOD!The Japanese soy milk donut with ice cream was SO DIVINE. Oh my goodness, it was like a yummy deep fried churro without all the sugar craziness. I think that is a MUST to get here after all the fun with the sushi. We tried the wabarimochi and the texture was a little too weird for us. I wouldn't recommend it lol. Mango and strawberry mochi ice cream were delicious! The sesame balls were also one of my favorites because they came out WARM and fresh. Nom noms. It was nice to eat something warm.Price-wise: It's about the same as any other AYCE sushi. The prices come out the same if you were to eat at a place that was around $22-25/person. It's just the fact that you get a cool, awesome, and VERY entertaining experience for the same price. And more variety of food. Unless stated otherwise on the iPad, each plate is $2.25 each.Oh yeah, and parking is a beyotch to go through! We parked pretty far on the street by the car dealership. We were not about to go through all the hassle just to park up close. So be prepared to walk far and to park on the streets!Overall, I am definitely coming back and bringing more family and friends! Yay! LOVE this place so much! Such a great place to experience!!!"], ["Jenna H.", "Wow!! Brings back memories when I visited Japan & Korea! This place has a terrible parking space & the wait is somewhat long. It was about 15-20minutes long for us (4 ppl). We were greeted by a nice waitress dressed in white uniform. Got seated at the table with a cool small screen that displays your menu & games.We just started to load up the table with small awesome plates of sushi & sweets. My favorites were the sweet shrimp, salmon belly & uni. Their wasabi is a bit more stronger, I think they actually grind the actual root instead of using the processed ones that are in packages. I really liked their wasabi :) they fishes were in a good condition, also sliced into thick pieces I would definitely come back with my friends again. I think I ate about 8 plates =$20 ish. Its $2.25 per plate but the price depends on what you order."], ["Randy S.", "Flat rate for a plate of sushi? Hell yah!!!Pros:Price - cheaper than other revolving/converter belt placesSelection - different variety, even different variations of specific sushiInteractive - touch screen is duel use for ordering for those that dont want to wait, and shows short animated clips of a samurai that needs your help with defeating the \"evil power\" (south park reference) for every 5 plates you disposeService - quick because of the \"button\" service, friendly, and helpfulToys - receive random toys for every 15 plates you dispose (or rewards for helping the samurai beat the \"evil power\"). Cons:Long wait - majority of the time you and your group will have to wait for an average of 45-90min to get seated.Crowded - mostly because of the wait outside of the restaurantParking - small lot, crazy drivers, ton of food places around the plaza, so dont be surprised if you come back to your vehicle with a brand new dent. Detailed sushi rounding the corner:Its awesome the plates are a flate rate. Since most of the typical sushi comes in a 2-pc Nigiri (fish on top of a rice brick), the ones that are usually the more expensive ones like Toro (fatty tuna) or Uni (sea urchin) only have 1-pc nigiri on the plate. But when u think about it, grabbing 2 plates of these1-pc nigiri to make a \"whole\" normal order, is actually cheaper than what you would get at another sushi place. With the use of a \"iPad\" at your table or bar you're able to order anything at the menu at any time or ask for more refills quickly. Yay for techno-savy places. Did my group and I stack up a grip of plates? Yes. For a group of 3-4, only topped out at about 35-37 respectively. Would i come back? Absolutely. But that wait makes it a tough sale. Its seriously like waiting at the DMV. Would i order my than 15 plates just to get a toy? My gamer and kid side says \"yes\"... but so does my adult kid side. :)"], ["Angie G.", "So, I was watching Food Network and they featured this cool revolving sushi bar in Japan that gave out prizes and a cool touch screen service.EUREKA! \u00a0Here it is in San Diego! This sushi place became popular over night! The sushi was okay, I think that it is more for entertainment than the food!Each \"green\" plate is worth $2.25 and every 15 plates you collect you receive a prize. (charm for your phone, magnet, or a sticky pad). You are also able to order other stuff from their touch screen menu located above the revolving belt. I swear you find yourself trying to collect 15 plates and some to try to get a 25 cent prize! We walked out of there spending a little of $90 for a party of 5! Cool experience."], ["Chris L.", "I have gone there three times now, each time I have left extremely happy. I think that their first quality is very good for the price that you pay. I love how they have different variations of the nigiri. I just mainly eat just nigiri there.The parking is absolutely horrible. Good luck with that part! LOL"], ["Jaylene R.", "I've frequented the location in Irvine, and once it opened in San Diego I had to pay them a visit once the crowds got shorter. I came to Kula quite some time after it opened and the long wait and crowds never died down. The (Asian!!) parking lot is terrible and is shared with Dumpling Inn and Jasmine among other places. To start, you sign in on an iPad and wait outside among the crowd of people raving over just average sushi.The only memorable sushi offered is the negitoro and the salmon belly--everything else was neither memorable nor fresh. You know it's not fresh because it's sitting out and revolving around the restaurant several times before it's snatched up. It is a cool concept but not worth it if the sushi isn't everything you've ever hoped and dreamed of. I really don't understand how this restaurant has so much traffic to be honest. You don't get service here either--just a push of a button when you're ready for a drink refill or the check. Definitely not worth the wait but maybe for a one-time visit for the revolving sushi experience."], ["Jimmy D.", "This place reminded me of how they serve sushi in Japan! \u00a0There's a conveyor belt that goes around each table with a variety of sushi. \u00a0Pretty long line, even when we got there at 2:10pm on a Friday and we were seated within 20 mins (lots of people on the list who left). \u00a0Came here around 7pm on a Friday the week before, and the waiting list was 3 pages long. \u00a0Definitely didn't stay for that one. \u00a0Also, your entire party needs to be there when they call your name. Goods:+Fish was fresh+ slices of fish are a decent thickness and not loaded with rice either+ Fresh grated wasabi!+ Most things were quick to grab on the belt+ Lots of variety+ made to order available and comes out within 5 minutes of ordering.+ doesn't take long to eat if you just keep grabbing plates.+ $2.25 per plate+ free prize for every 15 platesFavorites:+ Toro (you only get one piece) that is very marbly and just melts in your mouth. \u00a0Not going to lie, but I grabbed 4 of them. \u00a0MmmM+ Spanish Mackerel+ Salmon+ Tuna trio+ yellow tail+ salmon bellySo So:- LONG WAITING LIST. \u00a0If you're not on the first page, it will probably be an hour +- Ramen reminded me of the korean noodles and the broth was a bit salty. \u00a0Ramen was about half the size of a regular order at a ramen shop.- servers didn't really check up on us, but requesting for service on the screen was a breeze- Limited parking. \u00a0Asian lot.. what do you expect?Overall:I'd come back to dine here if the line wasn't so long. \u00a0I usually go all out, so I spent about $52 and put down a good amount of plates and side dishes. \u00a0Not too pricey for decent sushi. \u00a0Its definitely no Sushi Ota, but it's also not $100+."], ["Janella P.", "After many attempts, I finally got to eat here! The revolving sushi bar, the cheap price, and the prize you get after eating 15 or more plates of sushi is what makes customers come back for more. I'd say this is better than the irvine location because of the experience and their sanitation concepts of serving their sushi. While also entertaining customers with the use of Japanese cartoons & prizes. Food: each plate is $2.25 which comes with 1-4 pieces of sushi. Not a lot, so each plate adds up! When you eat 5 plates of sushi, a cartoon pops up on the screen and when you reach 15 a prize rolls down! Sushi here is alright, not the best. It varies from different kinds of rolls, sashimi, hand rolls, desserts, and many others! You can also order your sushi on the screen in front of you and it will be sent right to you on the conveyor belt in a flash. They also serve ramen. Wait time: average is 48 minutes-1hour!Ambiance: place is small and gets crowded! But the revolving sushi bar makes your experience fun! Parking: you'd be lucky to find parking in their actual lot! Park in the lot next to the jasmine restaurant. If it's full, park on the street! Like I did. I'd go here for the experience, but if you're really hungry I'd recommend going to an ayce sushi place like RB sushi to get the most out of your money. Plates will add up especially when you're hungry here because each plate only has 1-4 pieces and before you know it, your check will be $40 or more for two people."], ["Larivhie D.", "Food is pretty good. Get a Hello Kitty toy every 15 plates. Parking is just okay. Expect a long wait, even on the weekdays. Sushi technology is fun. I would go here again."], ["Jashni F.", "First time finding a revolving sushi restaurant in San Diego! Of course there was a wait, but I think it was reasonable and felt shorter than expected. You have a waiter that will answer any questions and fulfill the basic waiter needs. The dining in experience is awesome because you do feel like you can have some privacy. You have the revolving belt and a menu screen to order other items on the spot. I highly recommend this restaurant for a good time eating sushi!"], ["Lanya G.", "Finally a revolving sushi bar in SD! This place is really fun to eat at! You have touch screen menu, conveyer belts whizzing by with lots of sushi options, you drop your used plates into a slot at your table, and if you turn in 15 plates you get a prize! Dont worry about where you sit because every table has their own toy dispenser. Theres a few other options you can order from the touch screen and these items are delivered to you on a separate conveyer belt , which its also really fun for the food to arrive this way. This place is kinda small inside and theres a wait, even on a Monday mid morning. I'm not sure if it's because this is a new popular spot or because its not very big, probably a mix of both. So definitely expect a long wait if you come during peak hours. $2.25 per plate, any plate. The fish is fresh and good quality! I especially loved the Toro, so buttery and just completely melts in your mouth. Very spicy but delicious wasabi.Fun place to experience at least once and a good place to bring out of towners to. Hopefully with how popular this place is, they will open one in north county!"], ["Alan T.", "This is a review for the $2.25 Tuna Fair promotion! I believe it ends on the 19th so hurry if you haven't gone here yet! First, let me say that I have been to the one in Irvine and it was okay at best. The one opening here, I figured it may have the same quality but boy was I wrong. This is probably one of the most unique and fun sushi experiences I ever had... it also is very good at taking my money... yup.... all of my money. Since this place just opened, the crowd outside is quite large. The bright side is that it doesn't too super long to get seated because a decent number of parties do leave. The waiting list is definitely intimidating. But if you have the patience and the money to also stop by Icekimo, then it really isn't that bad. TIP - if you want to be in front of the line, go by yourself! There are single tables from what I can tell. Otherwise, as long as your party is 6 or less, you should be good to go. So let me begin by detailing why this place is so good at taking your money. 1. the revolving sushi - it is SO easy to just take a plate. TOO easy. This is basically all you can eat in disguise. In a normal restaurant, you order off a menu... it may not have all the pictures so you're less likely to want it. They also take menu away so you don't order again. Here, everything is visual and moving. Simple curiosity will have your hand on a plate before you know it. 2. touch screen menu - the waitresses here probably have the easiest job in the world because you don't need them to take orders anymore. You can search through a variety of pictures and order whatever you want. It will then be conveyor belt-ed to you in an awesome fashion, rewarding you for what you have done. 3. Bikkuron prize and animations - every 5 plates gets you an animation of a little samurai battling some evil people. Every 15 plates gets you a little bikkuron red ball prize that contains stickers or cellphone charms! How awesome is that! So while you're eating, you're getting constantly rewarded for eating! Imagine being at plate 13... you're pretty full but you're so close to 15! You're gonna grab two plates. It's that easy and the red ball is your reward!4. The plate counter - this is the slot next to your table that counts your plates so you can win your bikkuron. By itself, it is a convenient factor for the bus boys in the back but it is more than that. Not only does it keep your area clean... it EMPTIES your table. The one in Irvine, the more you eat, the higher your plate stack goes and the less you will eat in response but you know how much each of those will cost. Here... they're gone as soon as you finish that nigiri and you will grab more. It is absolutely brilliant. Overall, the sushi quality is quite good. The cuts taste fresh and honestly... Toro for $2.25 apiece??? STEAL. At this price range... I'm honestly surprised that it is this good. It isn't Sushi Ota quality by any means but it is SO good for $2.25. You won't be disappointed. So... good sushi, amazing price promotion, the best use of technology in a restaurant experience that I have ever seen. Kula knows how to get your money and honestly... you'll feel perfectly good about it... along with the amazing nap you'll take after."], ["Carmel C.", "If you want to have lunch at Kula I recommend showing up earlier than noon. It gets very busy. Kula is a fun inexpensive way to enjoy lunch. You can grab items off the revolving sushi belt from your table or you can order your items off an iPad and they will come quickly to you on a conveyer belt delivered fresh to your table. The staff is friendly and most of the items are $2.25. You can have a fun experience, decent sushi and you won't break the bank. It's a unique way to eat with friends! I definitely recommend Kula."], ["Joyce D.", "This place is by Jasmine and Iceskimo, across the street from Min Sok. I was waiting for a revolving sushi bar to arrive in San Diego. \u00a0Knowing it is new and that it is located in Convoy, I wasn't really interested in going here because I knew it was going to be a long wait. \u00a0I ended up getting off of work early on a Friday. I arrived at 3 pm. I got lucky with a parking space in the parking lot. I would say to expect parking on the street, especially if you come during peak hours. So at 3 there, there was already people waiting. \u00a0You put your name on a list. My name got called after 50 minutes. My party wasn't there yet and the hostess just told me to tell him when my party arrives and I'll get seated. So the restaurant itself is kinda small. There is both bar and table seating. You can stick with just foods on the revolver, or you can order food on an iPad and it gets delivered to you via an upper belt. The sushi was really good. What's nice about this place is you can try a lot of things out without committing to a full roll or order. Each plate on the revolving belt is $2.25. \u00a0They keep track of your plates when you dispose your empty plate. After disposing 5 plates, a small video clip pops up on the iPad. After 15 plates, you get a small prize. My favorite for the day was yellowtail. I also get strawberry mango mochi ice cream which was delicious.

She never came back once to check on us so I couldn't send my disgusting beef teriyaki back. To top it off we saw her leave her shift without even letting us know or checking with us again...I'm she just closed out and left work...ummm not acceptable.In the service industry this is horrible you let your open tables know if you're leaving or transferring your table.B) my beef teriyaki was drenched in a pool of sauce... I mean it was literally soaked through it was un edible and disgusting but of course I never could send it back because no one ever checked on us after our food was dropped off. I tell them when we finally ask someone for our check. I didn't even touch my food. I had to ask two different people to take the nasty un edible food off my bill. They took no money off the bill no apology nothing. So I say I'm not paying for something that I didn't eat. So this other girl comes over and says they are gonna charge me for everything independent that was in my combination plate but they would take the beef teriyaki off.

In addition I noticed a hair which made it even more inedible. The rolls were okay, but nothing spectacular. The rest of the meal consisted of us fighting off flies and it was gross.

One of the best rolls on the menu is the hot kiss roll, and the Las Vegas roll is also delicious. On the other hand I don't recommend the seaweed salad because it is mostly cucumbers rather then seaweed which is a bit disappointing. The only area this restaurant is lacking in is customer service. I am a frequent visitor of this establishment and one time a busser came up and cleared the plates off my table and about 20 min went by and we patiently waited for our check...

Quality service right there since most places nickel and dime you for choosing anything beyond plainSalmon and Tuna NigiriThey give you GENEROUS slabs with a not-too-big, not-too-small portion of sushi rice so you can just indulge in the flavor of the fish. They both tasted fresh and clean and had dabs of FRESH wasabi, which is so much stronger than the paste so it really creeps up on youPink roll and Eel rollHave I mentioned their sushi rice quality? Perfectly flavored and wonderfully textured (not a hard awful mess or falling apart)--instantly the tip off to good sushi--and it showed in the rolls.There was a great amount of fish and anything with spicy tuna or eel is my go to so the Pink roll was my thanggg. Eel roll was also good but forgettable; not in a bad way but just because it's a standard roll. However they can overdo the sauce sometimes.The atmosphere is interesting. Not a dressed up, trendy sushi bar but a small sushi shop vibe with their stringed white flags and the Japanese style drawings on the walls.

Amazed by the quality and freshness of the sushi served here. By far the best sushi I have had in san diego so far. Since I have never tried it, we came primarily for the live uni. I suggest calling first to make sure they have it because it is not always available. Although the experience was really cool and it seemed to be prepared well, I did not like uni at all. Personal preference I suppose. It tasted like ocean flavored ice cream. The special poke roll was my favorite topped with a generous amount of tuna salmon and whitefish. The NtC roll and California beech roll were also very tasty. The service was pretty good except that they never brought our free yelp check in edamame which was a bit disappointing. Next time maybe :)"], ["Jas K.", "Redeemed free edamame by using yelp. Got the garlic = awesomeOrder: teriyaki chicken bowl, tuna blossom, ultimate crab, bluefin tuna (THEY RAN OUT!!! Nooooo)Review: Servers etc are great. Not a fan of the ultimate crab at all. Too saucy, fatty, rich tasting - contains real crab meat which I thought would be good. Will get it with sauce on the side if I get it again but I doubt I will. The tuna blossom had a lot more tuna and not so much filling last time I ate it so it was a slight let down. The fact that they ran out of bluefin was a bummer because I went there specifically for that. The teriyaki bowl is your normal can get it from trader joe's teriyaki bowl.Bathroom: Smells great (this sounded so weird when I just read it but it smells great in there - guess I've been lucky not to walk in after someone who had bad sushi LOL), well maintained.Conclusion: I still think you should give it a try.

We tried the Hawaiian Roll which was pretty tasty. The roll was cut into 8 pieces which made them a little difficult to eat. Had they been cut into 10, they'd probably be the perfect size. We also shared a Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box which was just mediocre. Chicken was dry and teriyaki sauce could be much better.

Small dining area, I didn't notice anyone waiting to be seated, but the place was consistently full throughout our time here. Service was friendly. Not really the most attentive (i would have appreciated drink refills), but they were kind and courteous enough. I have to mention though, that My husband did get a little upset at the fact that we arrived a full 20 minutes before the people who got seated next to us, and they received 2 rolls within minutes of ordering, all before we got any of our food. (Sad face)Anyways, We got our free Garlic edamame with Yelp check in... Very peppery, which made it a bit spicy. Chicken katsu donburi- basically it is a chicken katsu cooked into scrambled egg with some saut\u00e9ed onion on top of a generous bowl of rice. Came out hot, a large portion overall. The flavor was a bit bland though. I usually don't add any table salt to my food, but I had to sprinkle a little bit of soy sauce on it to add flavor. I've had this dish at other places and I remember it to usually have a much more sweet soy sauce flavor. California roll- I know, I'm one of THOSE people that go to a sushi place and orders the least sushi of sushi. At first I was a bit disappointed bc the rice tasted a bit mushy. but after a few minutes, the plate settled a bit and the rice dried enough to where I was content with the texture. The imitation crab meat didn't have much flavor though.. So I wasn't completely sold on the items I ordered.. But my hungry husband ordered 4 rolls and sashimi... We are not huge seafood eaters.. So sashimi has to be super fresh in order for my husband to really enjoy it. He ordered the yellowtail and was satisfied. He also ordered 2 fried rolls, a baked roll, and another roll. All of which he enjoyed and was satisfied with their freshness and preparation. The rolls ended up being pretty generous is portion, they're long rolls!... The husband has a big appetite when he's hAngry (lol), but this was a ton for him. We've tried sushi is many places all over San Diego, and this place gets a thumbs up for their sushi... They also offer appetizers like tempura or tofu... They have bento meals and bowls... Yakisoba and ramen too.

If you are looking for hardcore sushi, this place leans towards the more modern albeit \"American\" type of sushi, meaning a lot of their specialty rolls have something cooked or fried. They did have the traditional rolls, the nigiri, sashimi, all of that, but they also had a lot of modern takes of those things as well. If you are looking for hardcore sushi then please go to a more hardcore sushi place such as Sushi Ota or even Nobu.

We ordered the sake taster and two rolls, but all we got was the sake taster. A couple sat down after we have already received our drinks. They sat at the table where I was facing so it was not hard to notice when they came in. Well they ordered maybe about 10 minutes after us. They got their food and finished eating while we were still waiting. We asked the waitress and she kept saying the food is coming. I was super peeved. The food was okay and to make matters worst I saw one sushi chef just standing there chillen. They were not busy and there should be no excuse on why it was taking so long. The waitress excuse \"Oh I had to put your drinks in first and that's why they got their food first\". Umm okay but that table is done eating and we still don't have our food, I understand waiting 20 minutes but close to an hour? I didn't leave because we knew everywhere else was busy and I was already hungry. There was a mistake along the way and instead of apologizing we got excuses. If they would have made up for it I would have been fine, but otherwise, no I was not happy.The food was just okay and okay doesn't make me want to come back with such service... Ugh so annoying when restaurants are so highly rated and I happen to be the one that get the bad service.

The SHISHITO PEPPERS and the WILD BOAR TONKATSU w/ kimchi BBQ sauce and miso mustard was also the table's favorites.On to the main course. The table voted for a mix of new style and traditional rolls, as well as sashimi. The fish really was extraordinary and super fresh - SAIKOU SALMON and the JAPANESE YELLOWTAIL were the favorites. The rolls were creative and the non-traditional ones more than filling: the CORNERSTONE ROLL (Salmon, Avocado, Spicy Crab, Jicama, Yuzu-Carrot Fluid Gel, Red Quinoa) was awesome with the yuzu carrot, and the RENEGADE ROLL (Albacore, Crab, Tempura Shrimp, Black Garlic Ponzu, Micro Cilantro) had this nice twist of cilantro to it.The meal was accompanied by several flights of sake.Overall a fantastic experience - highly recommended."], ["Marlane R.", "My favorite sushi spot in San Diego!

I'll have to say Saiko holds its own in North Park. This being a progressive restaurant I wasn't sure what to expect. I came in on a Tuesday evening before a show across the street. I was immediately greeted and sat at the sushi bar. The waitress was patient allowing me ample time to check out the menu. I was being a little indecisive at the moment so she suggested I start off with the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. These were great, saut\u00e9ed just right, topped with cilantro and sesame seeds. In addition I asked for a seaweed salad. Both completely prepared different from what I've had before at sushi restaurants and I have to say I enjoyed both appetizers. I decided to keep it simple and check out the nigiri on the menu. I'll start from my favorite to least favorite. Spanish Mackerel was great and topped with a little lime wedge, I would order this again. 2nd runner up was the smoked salmon which is smoked in house and regular salmon nigiri. Standard in flavor but still good. 3rd was the yellowtail and albacore. I can't quite pinpoint what the issue was but I felt the fish itself was lacking in flavor and was too cold. Like the fridge setting was off. Lastly was my poor scallop nigiri......flavorless and mushy. I really love scallops and order them when available. These were missing the slight sweetness and texture that I'm used to. Kind of a bummer. To end on a good note the my two appetizers were great as well as the Spanish Mackerel. So 3 out of the 6 things I tried I would order again. On top of that the service was great. Fast and friendly! \u00a0This being a progressive style restaurant I feel that I may have ordered wrong. Maybe I should have ordered the rolls and let their creativity shine through. I'll be back to try other items and with hopes to bump up my review."], ["Michelle W.", "I read about this place somewhere that prompted me to bookmark it. Thrilllist, SD Mag....I read a great review somewhere. Well, I'm glad I did read about it, it is a great sushi spot. My husband and I sat at the bar (not the sushi bar) and was waited on by one of the best bartenders I have had in So Cal in long time, Jessica. We later found out she just moved here from Seattle. She gave us such a great pitch on their sake that it peaked even my interest (I don't like sake). After her convincing pitch and a $10 flight special, we were both in. We tried two different \u00a0flights and had good and bad experiences within both flights. My husband ordered the Unique Modern flight and I ordered the air, land and sea. Both are worth trying, everyone has their own personal taste. Overall, I enjoyed the flight experience despite not being a sake drinker. \u00a0My favorite was the Happy Bride, my husband really enjoyed Mystery. On to the food! We ordered the house edamame which is the simplest to prepare, but unfortunately was overcooked and lacked a little flavor. Based on Jessica's recommendation, we ordered the crispy chicken skins and we didn't regret it. They were awesome! They were served with a house made Sriracha which was just ok. I'm disappointed to say that because I give credit to chef that go the extra mile, but the stuff from the bottle would have been killer with the chicken skins. The house made lacked the kick I was looking for. Finally we ordered the Kilroy roll and yellow sashimi. The Kilroy was a hate/love. It was so different with the blueberry so it took me a minute to like it. I would definitely order it again. The yellowtail sashimi was awesome, my favorite out of everything. Overall, a great, modern sushi spot with great service."], ["Jack M.", "`This new Sushi and Japanese eatery is something North Park Needed, not that there are not other sushi bars around, but this one comes with a modern vibe and more progressive menu.I came in on New Years Eve, happy that they were opened, and saddle up to the sushi bar were I met Bill, one of the talented Sushi Chefs. It was still happy hour so I ordered the Salt and Pepper Wings for $5, Saikorama Roll for $5, which turned out to be a great price because off the regular menu it cost $12.50, and off the regular menu, I ordered a regular Tekka Maki cut roll for $5.50 and some green tea which they served in a little pot (yelp.com/biz_photos/saik\u2026).The Tekka Maki or tuna roll arrived first nicely presented on wooded cutting board. The roll was well made nice and tight, and although I felt the amount of tuna was on the small side, it did have a very pleasant sweet and rich flavor (yelp.com/biz_photos/saik\u2026). Next came the Salt and Pepper wings, and I was surprised that only four wings came with the order. If I would of known that, I would of passed on them. I did however mention that at least 6 wings would be more appropriate for the price, even at the happy hour price of $5. I really hope they listen and add more wings to the order because in the end, they were quite good. I certainly would not pay the regular price of $7 for four wings. By the way, that little slaw that came on the side was bliss....The wings came with a nice golden crust on the skins peppered with coarse salt, black pepper, and sesame seeds (yelp.com/biz_photos/saik\u2026). They were very flavorful and seasoning was quite aggressive in a good way, and the meat inside was very tender and juicy and if they add two more to the order, I would order these again. Lastly, the Saikorama roll arrived. It is important to note that the roll comes tempura fried, but I opt to have it without. This roll was my favorite item I ate thus far. It came with Yellow Tail, Salmon, and Crab, and a Carmelized Soy and Wasabi Aioli swirled around the plate (yelp.com/biz_photos/saik\u2026). The roll's flavor and texture was outstanding, and at $5 during happy hour, it is a heck of a deal. Both the the yellow tail and salmon were delicious and eaten with a touch of both creative sauces on the plate was just perfect. I look forward to returning to try some of their other menu items and draft beer selections during happy hour.

We went off of her recommendations for everything like the edamame, chicken skins, the cornerstone, the homewrecker and the saikorama from the happy hour menu. Heather was fun and very personable and we even got to take a photo with Godzilla haha. Definitely recommend this place! Ended up being a great date night :)"], ["Mari H.", "We stopped by last night for some super early sushi around 5, figuring with all these stars, this place is sure to get busy fast on a Friday night. We started off with the House Edamame and Salt and Pepper Wings. I'm just going to say, we're definitely already fans at this point. The edamame was deliciously seasoned and the wings used exactly the right amount of salt and pepper before they could no longer be considered wings and just a salt lick. Basically if you've never eaten a Maldon (or other salt) pyramid as a snack, or find that repulsive, these are not for you. Get something else. Hubs and I loved them!!!We got a few pieces of nigiri sushi and wished we'd got more. They were well seasoned and cut slices with little need for table seasoning. Then, because I'm kinda starving, I got this new style roll. Here's the mistake. I may never order one of these again. It wasn't awful. It's just a big order to not match either your expectations or your palate. I got the Fanfare. It sounded good. But I've still eaten the majority of the spicy tuna in my life on the east coast. We don't mince it. I forgot, my bad. But aside from that, the roll was just bland. Spicy tuna, yellowtail, shishito pepper, and orange citrus miso, I'm expecting something bright, maybe sweet, maybe the salty miso flavor. It was just blah, none of that came through, not even the spicy. Fanfare aside, I'm still excited to get back over there.

I'll confidently say this is the perfect place to bring your friends who might not be sushi fans but not the best for those of us who are looking for a more authentic raw-fish vibe.

I do wish they had a better selection of simple rolls outside of just the rainbow. (-1) for the slowness of the sushi service. I'm not sure why this seems to plague the small-sushi joint world? At only 30% capacity, it shouldn't take you longer than 20 minutes to plop out a couple rolls. (-1) for some very-over sauced rolls. I believe the Renegade was so heavily drenched in the sauce that the flavor of the rice and the fish were simply lost.

The fish look and smelled fresh.Spicy tuna The appearance looked fine. However when I took the first bite the cucumber was old because it was not crunchy. I pulled it out and it was rubbery. The flavor of tuna itself was not spicy at all and was bland. The rice was sort of sweet??? I was very confused. I even tried the rice by itself after I took the roll apart and it tasked sweet. I'm not sure if they add something to it when they are making it. needless to say I didn't eat it :(spicy scallop hand rollIt was not fresh!! The texture was off. It also seemed like it was mixed with maybe crab meat??? It also tasted awful. Didn't eat it as well!!!

Went to San Diego for a weekend, happened to stay in Shelter Island, decided to give this place a try, and it hit the jackpot - almost as good as our favorite back home! Everything we have that night, and I repeat, EVERYTHING, was very good; from fried rice, to ramen noodles, to hot or cold sushi, even the edamame! They bring out the food so fast during peak time we were truly impressed. Appreciated my food hot out of the kitchen! The fried rice had a lot of \"wok hei\" (what cantonese people say about stir fries that had the perfect amount of steam and smoke). The ramen noodle has one of the silkiest broth I've tasted, but it wasn't a thinned out soup, had the perfect balance of creaminess and thickness, texture wise; flavor was real good too, they used the right kind of meat and the right kind of cut for the soup.We couldn't get enough of the sushi because they were plump (one of the reasons why so many other sushi restaurants don't appeal to us, the pieces are small and ingredients are skimpy), the fishes very fresh, and the sauces interesting. The only minor thing was they used a little too much pepper than I like. I'll bet the Japanese people would say they don't use black pepper on their sushi! But we just drank a lot of water to wash away the peppery taste, the rest is unforgettable. We felt lucky to have stumbled upon Umi Sushi!"], ["Cynthia M.", "The quality of the sushi is excellent.

In other words, you can tell them a certain dollar amount and they'll prepare food worth that amount. Also, this is $50 total, not per person (this is an important distinction). In my party of 2, we said we'll do $75. It was more than enough so maybe we should've done $60. There's a guarantee that it's more worth your while if you spent the same amount on a la carte items. I also like how, in the omokase deal, you can give them a percentages of what style of food you want included in it (for example, 33% sushi, 33% nigiri, 33% sashimi). It's served on a big wooden boat. You could probably tell them if you want something specific included, but I didn't do that. Our food was great and tasted fresh--the presentation was cool.One thing I didn't like about this place was that it seemed like the fish wasn't cut properly. I'm no sashimi preparer, but I've eaten a lot of it, and it just seemed like some of the sashimi was cut in a way that it flayed apart when I picked it up. It tasted good/fresh, but the way it came apart when I picked it up was weird. Other than that gripe, this is a solid place to get sushi on Point Loma.Would I come back?

You can choose different things as long as it adds up to whatever the price of the boat was. What through off my rating of this place was the difference in fish quality.

In the waiting time for our food- and other friends had to slither-out of the private room and from the very uncomfortable wooden / torture style seating.So, because you have to take off your shoes....here I am walking through a restaurant and into the bathroom BAREFOOTED! too awkward to stop, put shoes back on,,,,etc.plus, walking out and literally having to jump down from this platform was absurd and uncomfortable.At least :45 min passed and we were well past completing the appetizers- of just edamame, which we were told \"sorry, we don't have garlic edamame - only plain: WHAT? THE?!Did they really mean: we are fresh out of OIL + GARLIC + SALT? or they were too lame to prep it this way.

Bad Bad bad idea Umi.Umi People: you Do Not deliver cold rolls with cooked rolls- either one sitting for a while, waiting for the others....is a total SUCK way to be served.I wrote to the owner on Facebook- let's see if he cares enough to listen and get back to me."], ["Mike D.", "Been coming here for so many years, place is huge, elegant, super friendly people and the atmosphere just makes you feel welcome.

Get them both and decide for yourself :) Our favorites were the hamachi belly, goldeneye, and Spanish mackerel!!! They were so flavorful, fresh, and more unique. We also really liked their simple cucumber rolls. These weren't on the menu, but my bf insisted since he loves how refreshing they are. The most underwhelming nigiris for us (for the price) were actually the salmon belly and the wagyu.. we'll skip those next time. We skipped the bluefin tuna since it's an endangered species, and we didn't want to be like that poacher who killed Cecil the Lion.

Then we decided to choose 5 different types of sushi; red snapper(so perfect! This was probably my favorite), amberjack(I found a small bone in this), yellowtail, salmon belly, blue fin tuna(really good). We also chose to try a roll, the Diego roll. This roll was simple and so delicious. The chopped cerano peppers on top were a great choice. Overall dinner was really good.

Because there were so many choices on the menu, we took quite a bit of time to order but ultimately went with the deluxe chirashi and a rainbow roll with brown rice substitution.When the food came out I was genuinely excited. After reading the rave reviews on Yelp, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the chirashi sashimi disappointed me a bit - with the exception of the toro and uni, both of which were great. The other sashimi pieces were a bit underwhelming and not as soft as I prefer. The rainbow roll was pretty good - I feel like the sashimi was even better than the one served on the chirashi, which is kind of weird to me. After finishing these two dishes, we were still kind of hungry/feeling adventurous so we ended up ordering yellowtail belly and salmon belly.Oh my goodness, the belly orders are the only reason (in addition to the amiable service) this place is getting 4 stars. They were AMAZING - my favorite sashimi pieces I've tried. I'd never tasted sashimi SO soft; the pieces literally melted in my mouth.

We ordered a whole array of Sushi ranging from the Tuna, Toro, Sake, Maguro, Uni... the list goes on.We were immediately brought out the sake and started the vacation on the right foot. The sushi was fast to follow and the food was solid. We enjoyed all the pieces and they were all surprisingly fresh. The notable sushi items were the Uni and the special Maguro appetizer they had. All of the sushi was fresh and you could tell that this joint is the classic sushi focused joint (as opposed to the rolls set up). All of it was solid and we were tempted not to order more sushi on top of what we had already ordered. The one complaint I had is that the Toro was a bit \"fishy\" and yes I know it is fish but I meant it had a strong aftertaste that I am not used to. \u00a0All in all, a very solid sushi spot and if I had not been spoiled by my favorite sushi spot in SF Kusakabe this would have been easily within the top few but definitely check this out when in the area."], ["Inna K.", "In town for a few days and it had some good reviews.

And the pizza roll is great for non-sushi lovers.Good tonite: the rice to fish ratio on the nigiri was good--the chefs here do not put excess rice to fill you up.

Atmosphere - as always I sit at the bar in order to talk with the chef. He was very personable and has been with Sushi Ota for 10+ years. Noise levels were tolerable.The Bad:You will need reservations. Just come here. Honestly, you need to experience the quality Sushi Ota offers. It rivals even places I ate in Japan.

You get a choice of fried shrimp head or shrimp miso soup with your order- the waiter will take away your shrimp heads after you finish the sashimi (picture posted). -salmon, yellowtail, toro: delicious, huge slices. Very fresh! -green tea ice cream with toppings- forgot the name but it's basically green tea ice cream with red bean syrup, jello, and fruits. Really good!I love this place, but it can be pricey. California roll here is $10 BTW.... I also wish that they had a bigger menu selection."], ["Queency M.", "I was never able to eat raw sushi til I tasted their fresh salmon sushi. After that, I understood why high quality freshness is critical. The salmon melted in my mouth like butter. Great experience."], ["Leah M.", "Ate here based on yelp reviews, and we were very disappointed. They have a very simple menu so if you're looking for modern and creative sushi choices, this is not the place for you. The sushi I had was good but the rolls I ordered (spicy tuna) were messy looking. The rice way falling all over and the tuna was not neatly placed inside the roll. Neatness of rolling is usually a sign of an experienced and artful sushi chef. My husband ordered the chicken teriyaki (he's not a raw fish guy) it was awful. It seemed to have been old, was some kind of dark meat,, was fried and was extremely chewy. Our appetizer of seared tuna tasted good but was clearly not made fresh and the \"sear\" was gray In color and was not appetizing to look at. \u00a0 Staff was very nice and that's the only reason why I gave them a two. We would not go back here again!"], ["Krystin T.", "Oh, Taka. I just don't know.I came here with a big group for a friend's birthday. We had an 8pm reservation and four of us (all women) showed up right around 8. We asked if we could be seated, but they said they didn't have a reservation under the name we gave. We tried another possible name, shared last names, etc. and the hostesses kept saying no. We stood outside and waited, and a few of the males in our group showed up. THEY asked for the reservation and we were immediately seated. It was really, really strange especially because we had exactly the right name and the right time - and we were the ONLY 8pm reservation, and in fact the ONLY reservation all day, period. By the time we finally sat, it was probably near 8:15 or so. We ordered and didn't actually receive our food until about 9:15. That's a bit slow for my tastes. We had our wine before then, and our appetizers (edamame, always), but an *hour* is still excessive. I decided to get two different rolls - the vegetable roll and the cucumber roll. The vegetable roll was really good. The cucumber roll was FULL OF WASABI. I don't know if I should have expected that, but it wasn't called out on the menu and man oh man was I taken by surprise. I can't handle spicy things so I didn't eat the rest, but it turned out that the vegetable roll was filling enough. We had all brought cash in preparation to split a massive check, but they actually split it for us (without us having to ask) and brought us individual checks - that was AWESOME and much appreciated. They also brought the birthday boy a cute little birthday dessert - cake with green tea ice cream inside an orange.*Side note - I'm not gluten free, but a few members of our party were, and Taka does NOT have the traditional, gluten-free soy sauce.

I would highly recommend this place!"], ["Nida K.", "I was in the mood for sushi and my friend and I were going to walk around Gaslamp after, so we thought Taka would be a good place to try. When we got there, we sat at the sushi bar. As we took a glance around at the sushi chefs, we took notice that every single one of them was Japanese. The menu is what I imagine it to be in Japan. There were hardly any rolls, at least no \"specialty\" ones. The ones that were on the menu seemed to just be there so they can accommodate for Americans who think rolls are authentically Japanese. By the looks of the menu, this was definitely some place authentic.I ordered Spicy Tuna Tartare and my friend ordered an Albacore Salad. Our sushi chef went to work on it and I can tell he was putting a lot of time into making it pretty. The Spicy Tuna Tartare came out and it had a circular ring of avocado on top and a quail egg. It tasted amazing, fresh and full of flavor. Although it was a little hard to eat with chopsticks, I gobbled it all up. I got to try my friend's Albacore Salad and that was really good as well. We weren't too hungry so that's all we had to eat. The portions weren't very big, but it was enough for us at the time. If you don't like raw fish, I don't suggest coming here. From the looks of the menu, mostly everything was nigiri and sashimi. They have the basic rolls that all sushi restaurants have but not any specialty rolls. If you're looking for authentic Japanese and fresh fish, definitely give Taka a try."]], "Sushi Tadokoro": [["Susie S.", "While we wouldn't pride ourselves on being sushi experts, we've been eating nigiri and sashimi pretty religiously for ten+ years. Here's what we found about the quality of fish:1) Everything we tried was delicious. Had the Omakase sashimi plate and each piece tasted fresh and smooth. The plate consisted of toro, big eye tuna, kanpachi, red snapper, scallop, and another piece we've never had before, a type of pike. Simple, elegant presentation and our chef taught us how to make a ginger sauce for the pike that made it so good.2) We tried a variety of nigiri. Each one we tried we had no complaints. While some were far above more favorite than others, it had to do with personal taste rather than the quality of fish and presentation. Our favorites were the kanpachi, zuke tuna, giant clam, and golden eye snapper.3) Had oyster on the 1/2 shell. The oysters were so big, our chef cut them into smaller pieces. And the marinade was delicious.4) We risked trying new types of fish and were not disappointed. I don't like seared fish, but had absolutely no complaints for the pieces that were. The other half had scallops, which he never does, and said he'd eat it again.As for service, we sat at the bar. Our chef, Takeaki, also the owner, shared with us where the fish was from, how they prepared it, and was willing to guide us through sampling. Not many chefs do this so well, we've found. He was exceptionally sweet and helpful which made our experience so much more than just eating fish.The ambiance is small and quiet. There are only about 10 bar seats and 4-5 tables. It is located in a small strip mall north of Old Town Rd, so park in the lot or on the street.You'll want to make reservations. We didn't but when we arrived close to opening, many of the tables and bar seating had \"reserved\" signs. We were able to sit \u00a0and eat, but it would depend on when you arrive if you would have to wait.We've already decided to go back, and for us to already be thinking about the next time, you would have had to make a strong, positive impression. I highly recommend this place already because of our service from Takeaki and the quality of the sashimi and nigiri."], ["Tricia M.", "If you are looking for great sashimi or nigiri, this is the place. The fish is fresh and melts in your mouth. I particularly like the toro and the oysters. As far as the rolls go, so far not a fan. Both times I've gone, I ordered a roll and both times they fell apart and so raw fish it is. For me, skip the rolls. The chefs are authentic, the place is clean, the service is great.

At least the fish tasted fresh and the temperature was appropriate. The cut of the fish was a little sloppy, much lower quality than we'd expect from such a well rated sushi joint. The only memorable piece was the fatty tuna and even that was not as rich or flavorful as we'd normally expect. The sashimi mackerel was also just okay. Surprisingly the two highlights were the karage shrimp (crunchy and great) and the much better than average California roll (which was also relatively inexpensive).The service was also disappointing as our server forgot about us a few times and forgot a part of our order and never came back to check in on us until we asked where the rest of our order was. If we come here again, it'd be for the rolls which is not something we typically say for a sushi place."], ["Nguyen T.", "Delicious, fresh fish with an authentic Japanese restaurant feel.

The food is amazing, the staff are friendly and accommodating, and the restaurant itself is very clean. Tadokoro has bar seating and only a few tables, so I recommend making reservations even if it's to sit at the bar. They have a shared lot but it's really small, so you may have to park on the street. I've tried a handful of rolls, dishes and nigiri, and the nigiri is what really stood out to me. Nigiri is per piece, and toro nigiri is a whopping $6 a piece, topping the rest of the nigiri at $2-$3 a piece. I'd say the rolls are between $8 and $15, and overall the prices aren't bad especially for the quality fish you get. ALL of the sushi is fresh, buttery and the perfect texture. I swear the fish just melts in your mouth!! Personal recommendations:Nigiri - yellowtail, toro, and salmon Negi toro roll I really thought the salmon avocado roll would be my favorite, but for some reason it tasted off to me. It could have been because the roll was extremely soft and creamy and I was looking for more texture. Whatever it was, I just wasn't a fan. Other than that roll everything was amazing and I can't wait to come back and try their black sesame ice cream for dessert.

This is an A+ restaurant that will make your tastebuds dance!!! My only critique: the green tea was lukewarm and bland (not enough matcha perhaps) and the miso was overly salty.

Sushi Tadokoro is a small place that's a few blocks from the busy part of Old Town, and it actually has dedicated parking! Brilliant!!Anyway, the super-high quality of the food at this joint reminds me of Sushi Ota, but it's less expensive and easier to get a table. We started with the some large Sapporos and the Omakase, which was sooo good! Every piece of fish melted in my mouth, and the flavor was so fresh and natural. We also ordered two hand rolls, and I appreciate how the pieces are just the right size to put in my mouth without filling it up completely. Some places make their rolls too large, but the ones here are just right.

Called in for an 8:30 reservation at the bar but none were available. Bummer but I wasn't going to let that hold us back from our sushi craving. The moment we walked in we were greeted by our friendly server who sat us immediately. Ordered up some gyoza and a beer to start. The gyoza was arguably the best and most unique I've had. Outer texture had a light crunch that was followed up by some tasty juicy pork. Bomb! We were ready to order the rest of our meal and surprisingly our waitress remembered us from when we called in our reservation. She then asked if we were still interested in a spot at the bar. That was a given!!! Of course I wanted to be up close and see what all the hype was about. This was an important event of the evening. Anytime service is personable and even remembers your name makes a big difference in a dining experience. Makes you feel kinda special :) Two big thumbs up for the service!!

Uhhhhh was that a mistake? No way! \u00a0It was all perfect. First round was Golden Snapper nigiri with a light brushing of yuzu sauce and Fatty toro. Both absolutely heaven and melted in my mouth. Next up was a slightly seared scallops with a light sprinkle of grated sea salt. Scallop texture was plump and flavor was spot on. This was followed by a another scallop and halibut nigiri. There is a theme going on here.....and it was all like butter in my mouth. Last but not least we ordered a salmon and avocado roll to fill the belly with some rice.

Mostly near residential area. Ambiance: mellow traditional with modern flair. It looks dim from the outside, but it's actually much brighter inside.

My friends took me here for my 22nd birthday and let me taste some of the freshest quality sushi in san diego.The outside area where this sushi place is located looks so different than the interior (aka kind of sketch). The interior looks chic, elegant, and is dimly lit with a sophisticated and almost sultry vibe (perf for a date night). We chose the $48 platter with choice sashimi including tuna, otoro, sweet shrimp, scallop, and more (2 pieces of sashimi each). Every piece melted in ur mouth and was top notch quality. It was my first time trying otoro and it blew me away and exceeded my expectations. When i bit into the fish, it was so juicy and soft and amazing. I felt like fucking smeagol cuz i wanted to yell \"SO JUICY SWEETTTTT\". There also was a twitching shrimp head on the plate for aesthetics, but u could also have it fried or cooked in miso soup. Both decisions are delish.Everything in this place is delicious. Even the ginger and the miso soup tastes amazing. We also ordered uni which just melted in your mouth, unagi which was buttery and flavorful, and monkfish liver which was creamy (almost like avocado) and absolutely amazing in flavor and texture. The salmon sashimi was also fresh, but i wish it was more room temp. The cuts were too cold. It would have been perfect if it wasnt so chilled.

The owner/chef was manning the sushi bar. Very small and quaint. The fish was top notch and the service was fast and conscientious. I had a Chirashi Box and it was delicious. The Uni melted in my mouth and all the fish was divine even without any wasabi or soy sauce. The chef even noticed I had some extra rice left after eating all the sashimi off the top and he passed me a small dish of pickles to eat with the rest of the rice. \u00a0I will be back to try the omakase for sure. \u00a0 Reservations are a must for dinner. This place has about 5 tables and a small bar. The only thing that could be a potential problem is the parking.... Or rather, the lack of parking. This place is in Old Town and located in a tiny corner next to a liquor store. There are about 5 spots in front and they are arranged in such a way that only about 4 cars fit at any given time. \u00a0 On a busy night, I think a Sidecar ride or Lyft ride might be necessary."], ["June S.", "Tadokoro's Chef's special sashimi plate is always a great way to start your meal so you get the taste of fresh fish on an unclouded palate.

My boyfriend brought me here for my first omakase experience and I absolutely loved it. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Bf said that Tadokoro is cheaper than Ota but we both believe that it is just as good.The toro is especially delicious! The quality is on par with the more expensive places.

The chefs are more knolageable than any I've seen before."], ["Tera E.", "Sushi Tadokoro seemed to be on of the few highly rated sushi places open for lunch - which is a new development I believe. We stopped in while making a trip back from LA to Arizona for a late lunch which couldn't have been a better idea. We were the only customers at the time and sat at the sushi bar right in front of one of the sushi chefs. We were able to order directly from him and watch him make our delicious sushi. Our waitress was also great. The nigiri lunch was a great way to try their different offerings. While most places I'm used to typically serve two nigiri per order, here it is only one so it is more pricy than most but certainly worth an occasional visit. Their house made mochi with green tea ice cream is also worth a taste!"], ["Roger M.", "This place is giving Sushi Ota a run for its money! Don't let it's location in a small parking lot directly next to a liquor store scare you away. Hidden away from the main business strip of restaurants along Old Town, you'll be surprised at the authentic Japanese ambiance inside! And actual Japanese patrons dining inside? Even better!We tried a couple of their sashimi combos and have to say we are highly impressed! Quality of each slice is damn fresh and on point. Grab their chef's special from the daily special menu! It came with slices of all the premium sashimi cuts you'd expect from a typical sushi joint, including two huge sweet shrimps that are practically still alive. This is as fresh as it can get (PETA, I apologize) as the head and legs are still moving, making an attempt to get off the plate. But do not fear, the live heads will be deep-fried soon after you finish the sashimi plate. It's perfectly fried to crispiness that you can literally consume it in entirety.Their gyozas are damn tasty too! It comes cooked and clumped together on this sort of pancake type of style. Order one before all the raw fish comes to the table as this will start you off right! And down it with an Asahi or Kirin on draft to quench your thirst from all the soy sauce.Oh yeah. If you still have room (we always have room after eating sashimi), grab one of their matcha green tea cheesecakes! This is the perfect way to top off your meal. It comes with red beans garnished along the side as well so you'll have a heavenly surprise for your taste buds!And please, save your Cali rolls or volcano rolls for a mediocre place like Sushi Deli, this is the place for authentic sushi only! :)"], ["Vi N.", "love this spot. must haves:-sweet ebi-spanish mackerel (whole fish, served as sashimi, then deep fried to perfection)-sashimi combos-chicken karaageon the pricy side, but definitely a treat i look forward to! :)"], ["Joe S.", "Very small portions. $50 for some sashimi, as thin as paper.

The ambiance was casual but nice and the staff was friendly. I started off with a bowl of edamame. You can never go wrong with that. That was later followed by a crunchy roll and a caterpillar roll. I was so impressed by the presentation! They definitely made an effort to make them unique. Not only that, but they also tasted great. The freshness of each ingredient really came through.The only downside would be the price. I know I could have gotten more food for the price I paid here if I had gone to another sushi place. But do not get me wrong: These rolls were worth every penny! So expect to spend a little more than usual because you are getting more than the usual!"], ["George B.", "Went for lunch. Good service.

We decided to get the Omakase meal that consists of different sashimi, nigiri, and appetizers. Definitely sit at the bar to enjoy the full view of sushi chef performing this beautiful dance with your meal.Forgot to take pictures of ALL the dishes that we got because I was THAT excited to just put the heaven in my mouth, but I will talk about my favorite ones of the night:Monkfish Liver: Best dish to open your appetite, the flavors go really well with the sauce and lemon.Sashimi plate: Beautifully displayed, only wish they didn't run out of the live shrimp. Got Tuna, Tori, Uni, Aji, Yellowtail, and they were all extremely fresh.Miso Sea Bass: All time favorite appetizers! Brings back my childhood memory at those authentic Japanese restaurant. The miso is marinated perfectly sweet and salty. The ginger also goes really well with it.Fried Shishamo: Little fried fish that's lightly salty. Definitely squeeze the lemon on it to bring the flavors out!Kettlefish Nigiri: I have only had squid before, kettle fish has an even stronger and flavorful taste. It was wonderful!Lightly torched toro Nigiri: Really enjoyed the chef dancing with the torch lighter, beautifully cut toro, and grinded sea salt.Giant Clam Nigiri: Might have been the best new thing I have tried that night, the clam was fresh and chewy. It was HUGE.Fresh Uni Nigiri: I watched him taking out a big plate of uni with my wishful eyes, then he carefully scooped out four pieces of Uni. With his gentle hand, he places two pieces on each nigiri. I skipped a heartbeat when he put them in front of us, the taste? Of course heavenly, I can never forget that feeling. I really almost cried. It was so great. So Fresh. So buttery. Ah.The atmosphere is very fun and intimate. The quality from their service to the very last bits of fish is just amazing. Will pick Tadokoro over Ota any day. BRB let me go back to drooling at my pictures from that night."], ["Marquis W.", "Excellent sushi and service. Make a reservation at the bar if you can and want more of the experience. Maybe a little better than Sushi Ota because of the service I received. Will be back on a regular basis."], ["Susana C.", "Came here on a Tuesday night with a friend. We were promptly seated even though we didn't make reservations. We started off with the garlic edamame and maguro tuna. The garlic in the edamame wasn't overpowering, you could taste the hint of sesame and ginger. \u00a0For the cut rolls, we shared the Dragon roll and the spicy tuna (of course). Both were very delicious but the highlight of the night was the Uni (sea urchin). If you haven't tried it, this would be the place. It just melts in your mouth. I will be back specifically for the Uni.This is a quiet, intimate place to take a date and enjoy delicious sushi. Every dish brought out to other tables looked like a masterpiece! I dropped a star because the parking lot is rather small so you have to park on the street. I had to park on a very steep hill, something to remember if you are wearing heels."], ["Hannah N.", "My brother in law was not joking when he said San Diego has the best uni.

The kitchen is painfully slow. \u00a0Second time we came on a weekday when it wasn't busy and waited about 40 minutes after ordering to get our food. \u00a0 The sushi is only average not worth the wait even with the groupon they have. Also the edamame guacamole is losing its allure."], ["Stephanie Z.", "My boyfriend and I had date night at this place and LOVED it. We loved the vibe and look of this place as soon as we walked in. We were seated right away and the waitress and manager were very friendly. The rolls were amazing and we ordered a \"fish bowl\" (I forgot what kind) that was so good. They had very reasonable prices and the rolls were a good size. We will definitely be coming back whenever we're in the area."], ["Jeremy D.", "Sushi Lounge is a combination of medium-higher end sushi and a lounge/bar scene with high energy music blasting the whole area - I brought my 2 tween kids with me and if I knew that there was a partial bar atmosphere, I would not have brought them to eat dinner here.They have friendly hosts and waiters that know how to funnel patrons (e.g. they stopped taking people in because the kitchen was behind and they didn't want the customers to wait so long once they were seated). \u00a0My water never ran dry and I enjoyed them serving us our dinner. \u00a0They also know how to keep patrons happy. \u00a0For example, they forgot one of our dishes and provided it as complimentary even though the food didn't take more than 10 min to come out.Be cautious of their smaller than expected plates especially the Chirashi. \u00a0Their garlic edamame was also too ripe and I found myself getting my hands dirtier than normal as I squeezed out the edamame like toothpaste.Their outdoor seating is a plus since it adds extra space and the ability to eat outdoors/people watch. \u00a0As I left the restaurant, I felt up beat and ready to take on the night!"], ["Sara J.", "I wish I could give 10 stars!!! \u00a0Since my last review, ive been here quite a few times..

I'd probably only come back if I was in the gaslamp area and was craving sushi. Otherwise, I'd prob stay away."], ["Michael K.", "Disappointing that I have to lay down a 2 star review here since the reviews were saying best sushi in SD, but the food just came out too slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. Had a reservation for Saturday night at 8. Place was fully occupied but nothing crazy...Party of 8, so a little challenge for the kitchen. Two hot dishes, the teriyaki bowl and steak lettuce wraps (marinated for 30 hours and was ironically the 2nd dish to come out) were ordered, every other order was fish. No free miso soup here so that's a bummer but it's alright. Brown rice is $2.50. A red flag. Cool art and decor. Took about 15 minutes for the teriyaki bowl to come out. Another 5 minutes for the steak lettuce wraps to come out. Another 10 minutes for an apology for why the food is coming out all separately. \"Hot food comes out faster than sushi.\" Yes, indeed. Another 20 minutes until the 92101 rolls came out. Those with the hot food, now had cold food...Some manageresque figure came over at this point and promised that the food would come out in \"5 more minutes.\"Another 5 minutes until three plates with assorted rolls/nigiri came out.Me and my boy who had ordered chirashi were doomed at this point, an hour in. Had to get to our club by 10 so this long dinner was putting a crimp in our style. Our chirashi bowls arrived at 9 approximately. Honestly, the quality of fish and taste was quite good. However, the portions were on the smaller side and their chirashi selection was poor. I don't expect chirashi bowls to fill me up but the majority were just basic tuna and salmon cubes, with little else of substance besides that. #cmonman They even skimp on the amount of rice that is given, not giving you a standard rice bowl size portion of rice but more like a half to three-quarters portion. The notion that chirashi in this state took this long to prepare was ludicrous, as the cuts provided were not especially complex, intricate, or rare. \u00a0$17 for the chirashi bowl here so it is firmly in the mid-range price. For the uninitiated this may seem like a quality sushi experience, but no sir, no sir. Do a Google search for chirashi and you will understand my perspective. As for the other food, general consensus was the cuts of fish were very fresh and tasty. The lettuce steak wraps were quality and you could taste the marination well. The teriyaki bowl was sup-bar as the brown rice was overly dry and tasteless. The latter two dishes were eaten cold due to the wait which may have impacted the reviews for them haha. Overall, I'd recommend coming here on a weekday when the restaurant is not crowded at all and you can experience some quality fish. They should remove hot food from the menu if they cannot balance out food out times. Location is very prime and convenient in the Gaslamp which probably leads to higher rent and them pricing things up? 4 nice TVs hang above and good Padres support in this bar if you're into that. I will not be returning though as there are better sushi experiences around and I guess this was punishment for not eating Mexican food in SD."], ["Mignon C.", "We came here on Saturday of Comic Con weekend so I really hope that the discrepancy between the ratings here on Yelp and what we experienced was due to the inordinate amount of people that were there that weekend. That being said, SDCC has been hosted here for so many years how do places close to the convention center not have their ish down already?? Firstly, we tried to share a bottle of sake at the table and about 70% of the bottles on their menu was sold out. We settled on something which cost $10/person for less than a cup of sake per person. Rip off. My second order for drinks was an Old Fashioned which I sent back because it came diluted with soda water?? I've never had an Old Fashioned diluted with anything. The 2nd one came out still diluted with something that was at least not carbonated and tasted only marginally better but I no longer wanted to try and order anything else or fix it. My SO's strawberry basil martini was so disgusting that every member at the table who tried to save the wounded soldier ultimately left it behind. (For a reference as to what a good strawberry basil martini should taste like please check out Seasons 52's.) My SO and I each got a chirashi bowl which featured a chef's unimaginative selection of albacore, tuna, and salmon sashimi (yes I know, two tunas). It also had ikura which was rancid in my bowl; it took me a while to pinpoint what I was eating that was giving me that somewhat fermented flavor and when I realized it was the salmon roe I was too far gone (and too hungry) to stop. I normally love ikura and this was so disappointing but at least my SO's was fresh and we could actually compare difference in color and clarity of our roe (yay!science). Speaking of being too hungry to stop eating obviously unfresh seafood, there were five of us at the table who all ordered at the same time. We all ate in shifts since food came out staggered so far apart that those of us still waiting told the others to start eating because we had no idea when our food would come out. In fact, my friend who had gotten the chicken teriyaki of all dishes didn't get his food until after my SO and I got our second round of orders delivered (well over an hour after we first sat down). First world problems, I know, but we wound up missing out on lining up for a panel we thought we had plenty of time to get into. Basically, the food was super over-priced for the quality and quantity that we got. My SO got another round of food (sushi rolls) because the whole experience had left him still feeling so hangry (hungry... and now angry as well), and I felt badly because it's not often that he gets fresh sushi/seafood in Texas and this was supposed to be a treat for him but it didn't feel that way. The only saving grace of the whole experience was that our waitress (dressed as sexy Pikachu?) was super friendly and nice and apologetic for everything that happened though most of it was beyond her control. After all was said and done and because we wound up missing the last panel we wanted to attend, we wound up leaving the area and going to Polite Provisions instead where our drinks were at least on point. I am normally inclined, given the situation, to give places like this another shot, but between the high prices and the gross rancid seafood, I'm not sure I want to risk and see if the wait and the dearth of menu items available was just due to Comic Con.. I would say that overall, the place I went to this weekend that really had their game on point and were prepped for the SDCC crowds was Werewolf.. that is worth checking out!"], ["Drew S.", "I'm shocked at any negative reviews. This place was really great. Food was interesting, different, and delicious.The food didn't come out in 5 minutes so giving a restaurant 1 star for slow service is retarded. Go to Mc donalds .

I was wondering if this place was really supposed to be Sushi Sanrio. Kawaii Sushi is pretty good. One of the better sushi places I have been to recently. It is also very affordable. For 2 iced teas, a Sapporo, thing of sake, and 4 rolls.... $40. Usually these \" affordable\" sushi places are not very good, and the fish quality is bad. I found the fish to be fresh, and the food to be flavorful. Our rolls were: lion king roll, rainbow roll, fantastic roll, and we had one more but unfortunately I cant remember the name and I forgot to take a picture. But it was good nonetheless. The best out of the bunch was the rainbow roll. It had 3 different varieties of fish on top. 1/3 was salmon, 1/3 was tuna, the last was shrimp. Nice flavor, fresh tasting. The fantastic roll was huge and covered in eel sauce and spicy mayo. If you like those types of rolls I recommend this one. All cooked I believe. Topped with krab and roe. \u00a0Lion king roll was my least favorite and I will probably pass on this one in the future. Again 3 varieties of fish on top. Yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. Inside was ground spicy tuna. It was good, just the others were better. I recommend Kawaii Sushi. I will definitely return here again.

Because it was kind of hard to read the page with the rolls, everything was squeezed tightly together.

I first tackled the tekka maki roll. It was basic, but that's the reason why I ordered it. I am not into all those fancy rolls all dolled with sauces and such. The tuna that came in this particular cut roll was a bright crimson, had a rich oily flavor, and with smooth texture. This roll did not have wasabi neatly tucked inside, but I took care of that right away.The cherry blossom sashimi roll was not only beautifully presented, but tasted great as well. \u00a0You can choose your fish, so I went with red snapper, salmon, and albacore. All three fish were great, and I liked the salmons richness, only to be contrasted by the snappers light flavor and texture, and then followed up with the albacore's mild buttery flavor. The roe on top was great and added a nice pop, and the crisps vegetables added some nice clean texture.The salmon sashimi was also nicely presented in a nice tight roll served on a bed of cucumber and daikon. The sashimi came with five pieces and each piece was rich, buttery, and with a smooth texture. The salmon was great to eat with dallop of wasabi and dabs of soy sauce.

The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of one was because of the gyoza. I picked it up with my chopsticks and it fell apart just like that. It didn't seem fresh. But the sushi was great! I got the shaggy roll & it wasn't too spicy but just right. The sauce that was put on top of the sushi tasted like cheese pimento mixed with spicy mayo. I know it sounds weird but, it was a delight!

Everyone went out to help. I mean all of the 2 waitresses and 2 sushi chefs. They made about 5 trips each. In the middle of lunch? Very unprofessional.

The lunch also came with a small bowl of miso soup which was very good.The chirashi was great. All the seafood items were quite good. I especially enjoyed the eel with its great tenderness and slight sweet flavor brought on by its the excellent grilling and subsequent sweetness of the soy glaze sauce. Seriously, I would of been happy with a whole bowl of eel. The salmon was of very good quality and was served at a perfect cool room temp. It was, very flavorful, although not as fatty, large, and evenly cut as I would of liked, it still had that rich buttery texture. The tuna was great and as the salmon, came with two pieces. They were larger and thicker than the salmon, so I was very pleased with that, because it allowed me to better appreciated the flavor and quality of the fish.The single shrimp was good, very light in flavor however, the octopus a little bit chewy but tasty, the yellow tail and hamachi were very nice and light, and the rice imitation crab were all nice. I normally do not eat that much white rice, but I found this one to be very good, especially since it acquired some of the seafood, not mentioned added soy sauce.

I think this is probably the best quality Chirashi bowl that I've tried so far (better than Hane's Chirashi, and I've had many Chirashi bowls, definitely better than Hane's Chirashi bowls) For a $15 lunch Chirashi it comes with 11 items. 2 tuna, 2 salmon, yellowtail, hamachi, imitation crab, grilled eel, octopus, shrimp and egg cake thing with some cucumbers over rice and seaweed. I felt that the fish tasted so fresh and buttery...like it came right out of the harbor and they are slicing it from the boat.

I can only assume that I came on a particularly bad night for the entire crew. My partner and I sat at the bar to see the action up close. Our server was too attentive, if possible. If I don't want appetizers, I should only have to tell you once. If I don't want an $8 Asahi, don't order me one anyway because my drunk friend said so. My biggest complaint though, is the food. When I'm trying a fancy sushi place for the first time I always leave it up to the chef to select the freshest and best cuts of fish to serve to me (omakase style) in a chirashi bowl. What a huge disappointment. Someone forgot to tell the chef that the best cuts are not necessarily the most expensive. The chu-toro was bland. The uni was of such low quality it was almost liquid and had very little flavor. The cucumber slices tasted like dishwater. Most horrifyingly of all, The chef put a dollop of chopped up hamachi mix in the bowl. The rest of the fish tasted like they had been frozen and thawed multiple times. Omakase is an opportunity to showcase your best stuff, not get rid of your leftovers. This is after we bought the chef a beer for himself too. I sat through the whole meal in stony silence because if I opened my mouth it would not have been pretty. The coup de grace was the bill. I knew this place wasn't cheap but $123 for two people for mediocre food? I've had much better and fresher sashimi at random joints on Convoy St (so fresh it was still twitching) for way cheaper. They get the one star because I don't have a choice. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone without a full inspection of the fish first, especially at their prices."], ["Michael W.", "This sushi place was delicious! \u00a0I am more of a fan of the traditional sushi nowadays as I feel like I can really taste the freshness and quality of the fish without having it drowned out by a variety of sauces. \u00a0Once in a while I'll still crave the fancy rolls though if the restaurants do it right, so it really depends on the mood. \u00a0For dinner, my wife and I both had the sushi combo which came with ~10 pieces of sushi and a small set of cut rolls. \u00a0The most memorable ones were Toro (melt in your mouth) and Uni (fantastic piece of uni), and all the other pieces were also very delicious. \u00a0I've also tried Sushi Ota which is supposedly one of the best in San Diego and Shino is just as good if not better. \u00a0My wife is a bigger fan of the fusion/fancy cut rolls so we'll probably be back to try something different next time but I'll stick to the sushi combo!"], ["Danny M.", "Outstanding sushi! \u00a0Very fresh fish and great service. \u00a0A little pricey but worth it."], ["Miki C.", "This review for lunch.

When you sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chef himself takes your orders for sushi, and a waitress comes around to take other orders.We ordered our sushi roll and the chef made it and put it on the counter. We put it down and each had a piece. As we were each chewing our piece, out from behind the plate jumps a random cricket! Now, I am not blaming the restaurant or in any way insinuating it wasn't clean. Crickets happen, apparently. I let out a shriek and the sushi chef called over a male waiter to come take care of the situation. The waiter came over, and saw jiminy in the corner and went to catch him with a napkin, when he jumped high and landed splash into my soy sauce. Yup, sounds like something right out of a movie.We screamed and laughed and the waiter took the soy sauce and went on his way. A random happenstance that happens sometimes.

It was my first time coming here and it really is a hole-in-the-wall sushi spot--a small Bob Marley, reggae-vibed sushi restaurant. Loved the look. I go to Mesa and pass by it every Monday and Wednesday but never noticed it. Upon being seating, apparently, the arrival time of my group did not sit well with the employees because the service was terrible. They acted nice but you could clearly see they did not want us there. We were not rowdy at all either, moreso tired from a long day. The women would stare at us in disgust. They constantly stepped on my boyfriend's shoe without apologizing. The way they set our sushi rolls down with some force. The 6 of us work in customer service, we know this isn't how customers are to be treated. We know how it is after a long day. This is no exception. \u00a0After 20 minutes of us just waiting for our order to be taken down, they finally came and took down our order. After 35 minutes from our order, our rolls and bowls finally came. The food was good. Great even. My friend had ordered a One Love sushi roll. He took a bite and immediately spit it out. It was drenched in wasabi oil. Too hot. He said it tasted like he was eating gas. It burned his nostrils. Displeased, he asked for his roll to not be made with wasabi oil. The women looked at him and started talking in their Asian language yelling across to each other within the small restaurant. They stood there and did not accept his request for his roll to be remade. My other friends took in his roll to eat and my friend ordered a new roll. We paid for a roll that tasted like kerosene because the employees acted like they didn't know what was wrong. They did. We paid for our food, they snatched our signed receipts from us, and we left. Very rude. I liked the style of the restaurant. I wish I could come back but sadly, I will not. \u00a0MY HORRIFIC LEFTOVER EXPERIENCE. I had a teriyaki chicken with fried rice bowl with miso soup and a california baked roll. I did not finish my bowl and two sushi portions of my roll that night so I took it to-go. The next morning, I microwaved it and began eating. Started with the rice. About three bites. Ate one sushi. About to take another bit of the roll when I found a thick dark, short hair in my rice. I with my fork, I scrambled my last sushi. Instantly, I found another hair but much thinner. Disgusted, I threw it away and rinsed out my mouth. I ran to the bathroom and began brushing my teeth. I began thinking of how easy it was to find hair particles in the small amount of food I had for my leftovers and how much I must've eaten that night without looking. I started throwing up in my sink. I rinsed the sink. Gagged and threw up again. I kid you not, another darker hair. Looking at that, I threw up some more. One, two, three more times of throwing up in my sink. My eyes watering, I had to clear it before I rinsed away to check if any more hairs found in front of me. I swear on my own life, one more hair. I never scrubbed my mouth harder than that Saturday morning. Four hairs total that I found. Two in my stomach that I threw up and two I found in my leftovers. There is no way that is a coincidence. No way. I am completely disgusted and traumatized of that place. I am forever paranoid of my food and that place should be health inspected in full detail. I hope to reach out to the owners and discuss with them this matter. I won't stop until it is addressed or I will have it shut down upon further investigation. I don't mean to be the \"kill joy\" of what could be a fine establishment but this is unacceptable."], ["Amanda R.", "I can now safely say I've given this place 2 tries. The 1st try, we ordered take out cause we heard that is the best way to go since this place is pretty tiny and can become very cramped.We placed our order over the phone and the guy read it back to us. When we picked it up we paid from almost outside the door since the place was full. I had no time to look at the order or the bill, just signed and left. When we got home we saw they forgot the chicken yakatori. We called to let them know and had a very confusing conversation with quite possibly a random customer who picked up the phone. Finally someone else got on the phone and asked me to check the receipt since they did not charge me for it. I checked and sure enough, not there. Even though he read it back to me when I ordered, they never added it. Oh well.2nd visit, we decided to go in for happy hour. Most places have a very clear happy hour where things are just at a discounted price. We wiggled our way through the tiny dining area to get out to the patio. A server came immediately and got our drink order. Since our butts had barely hit the seat, I didn't open the menu so I asked her what the beers were. I asked for a 16 oz Sapporo. When I opened the menu I found that in order to get a happy hour price you have to order a large beer from a choice of 3... Not what I ordered. Anyway, we place our order and everything came out one after another over a 10 minute span. Great that they're fast, bad that they don't ever come back once you get the last plate! I was so thirsty after having finished my beer \u00a0and never had a chance to order another thing! The albacore roll I got was bad. Bad flavor, and smelled! Since no one ever came back and I could have done jumping jacks in the corner without any one noticing, I didn't have a chance to tell the server until I asked for the check. When I did, she asked... is it bad? I said yes, I think the fish has gone bad! Did it get taken off the check since a bite was taken out of one piece only? NOPE! So disappointing, the spicy tuna roll was awesome! Served super cold just the way I like it. The katsu bowl was so good with the spicy mayo. The chicken yakatori, which we actually received this time, terrible. Yakatori is supposed to be a peanut sauce with white meat chick, this was dark meat with a simple teriyaki sauce.

The portion sizes are very generous and the food, in general, is satisfying but definitely not light. I came here on a weeknight at around 6pm and the place was fairly crowded (and also pretty small) - I think we got the last available seat.

Anyway, the Sushi Roll Boat was HUGE. It came with the Love Roll Combo (a variety of 4 half-size rolls), tempura, chicken teriyaki, seaweed salad, fried calamari, edamame, and miso soup. Miso soup wasn't my favorite - it wasn't bad, but the taste just wasn't to my liking for some reason. Seaweed salad was pretty good, along with the fried calamari. The edamame was not as \"crisp\" (if you know what I mean) as I would've liked, and the chicken teriyaki was standard. All 4 rolls were decent, though - my favorite was definitely the Bruce Lee roll, followed by the Caterpillar and then the Jamaican; my least favorite was the Diner's California Roll because it was nothing special.Overall, I thought the food was pretty good. However, I personally thought it was way too heavy (lots of fried stuff and the sushi rolls were very dense/with lots of sauce - the Jamaican Roll was actually far too dense for me to have again). Oh I sure left feeling full, but I tend to like my meals lighter. I also usually just go for sashimi/nigiri at Japanese restaurants for this reason - it doesn't seem to be what this place is known for, but maybe I'll make another visit to try it.

\u00a0I looked up at the sushi chefs and although we made eye contact, they made no contact or indication they would take my order. \u00a0I looked at every server in the eye but they all just walked on by me. \u00a0I looked up at the person who seated me at the suhsi bar and even he just went out his way without checking back with me. \u00a0It was about 10 minutes of this before someone finally asked if anyone had helped me. \u00a0I would have thought that would be obvious given I didn't even have a drink in front of me and still had the menus. \u00a0I placed my order for yellowtail and tuna nigiri. \u00a0Out of all the rolls, I wanted to have a Philly Roll, something I was familiar with and used to eating. \u00a0And on the specialty roll page, I went with #8 Funky Kingston Roll which is crab and shrimp tempura in and spicy tuna and jalapeno on the outside topped by a spicy mayo sauce. \u00a0For starters I ordered the seaweed salad and an iced tea. \u00a0Unfortunately they serve instant iced tea instead of fresh brewed. \u00a0They brought out the seaweed salad and it was untraditionally served on a bed of lettuce and covered with masago. \u00a0I do like masago, but not atop my seaweed. \u00a0I'm used to a more traditional serving which is not on a bed of lettuce and sometimes with spicy carrot slices but not masago. \u00a0However, the taste was traditional and good.After finishing the seaweed salad, they brought out the nigiri. \u00a0The fish portion was quite generous but didn't look like the freshest of quality. \u00a0I had a piece of the tuna and while it was nice, it was just average. \u00a0Almost a bit warm too which was quite disappointing. \u00a0I ate both pieces of the tuna and one piece of the yellowtail. \u00a0It wasn't bad fish, but not the freshest I've had. \u00a0Surprising to me was also they just let the dishes stack up as I was finished instead of removing them. \u00a0It got a bit crowded and at one point my glass of tea was knocked over. \u00a0I didn't get anything on me, but they seemed a bit peeved at the mess. \u00a0But they nicely cleaned up the tea and refilled my glass with some more fabulous instant iced tea (that's sarcasm by the way). \u00a0The rolls were delivered and they looked very appetizing. \u00a0I started off with a few pieces of my Philly Roll. \u00a0Again, somewhat disappointing because it was warm. \u00a0Even the cream cheese was somewhat room temperature. \u00a0Unless it's a baked roll, I like my fish and roll to be chilled or cold. \u00a0The taste was okay, but nothing spectacular. \u00a0I moved onto the Funky Kingston Roll - \u00a0the place has a Jamaica theme to it (odd for a sushi place) and they play a lot of Bob Marley; but this roll, they spell Kingstone which was odd to me since the city in Jamaica is spelled Kingston (no \"e\" at the end). \u00a0I took a bite of this roll and it was fantastic! \u00a0I love a roll that I don't need to dip in soy sauce or anything else. \u00a0It was very flavorful and just the right amount of spicy! \u00a0I finished the entire roll, it really was great! \u00a0So, overall nice quaint place. \u00a0I didn't see the outdoor dining area but can't imagine that it's much larger than the indoor. \u00a0Parking is difficult and initially service seemed to be lacking. \u00a0They have an amazing list of rolls and I would like to come back and try some of the others. \u00a0Take-out seems to be most popular when dining here. \u00a0I would say about half the orders were for people just for take-out and it probably is the way to go given the parking (or lack thereof) and service. \u00a0And I haven't mentioned it, but they do have good prices, but on the other hand, its comparable to the quality of fish they are serving.Lastly, they use Styrofoam! \u00a0I can't understand why a place is still using Styrofoam. \u00a0I've done my own research and there are businesses in San Diego that sell recyclable containers and the cost is less than 10 cents more than compared to Styrofoam, something you can easily pass along to the consumer. \u00a0Styrofoam cannot be recycled in San Diego."], ["Cheyenne M.", "BEST SUSHI PLACE EVER.

Once we ordered and waited a bit for our food, we were pleasantly surprised that the sushi lived up to its hype! We got our standard special California roll, crunchy roll and Smoked Jamaican. All delicious and left us satisfied.We will definitely come back here but might just order on the phone, but by the looks of it, that may be why the wait to get our food once we ordered took a while.

My girl went in and picked it up she also got attitude from the main lady for no reason! It took 5 minutes for her to even get greeted at the door. Food was supposed to be 5 minutes when she arrived. Because I called in ahead of time. It ended up taking 20.All the rave about the baked rolls is garbage. It's all filled with cream and sauces. Probably to cover up the fact that the food is not fresh. Never will go here again. Don't take a risk at this place"], ["Andrew P.", "Came in with my wife to have some sushi.There is only one bathroom outside of the restaurant. It looked like it hasn't been cleaned all day, there was puke in the sink.I ordered a bento box and an asahi. Wife had salmon sashimi and baked scallop roll. We ordered baked mussels and spam masubi as appetizer.Throughout the meal they forgot several, not just one but several food items which we had to remind them to bring.Almost done with our meal already, we noticed that one of the rolls we ordered never came out. We asked for the check when the server came with baked scallops in a to go box and asked if we ever got ours. We said no, but it is okay, we preferred to just skip the roll since we were done with our meal and we'll just take the check.He left and returned after he spoke to the manager. He said that they don't allow food to be returned. Then he dropped off the baked scallops and a check.Utterly terrible customer service.

I have yet to taste low quality fish from this place and I'm very particular in a way. As long as it's not fishy I'm good. So the way I eat my rolls, I usually get the piece of fish out of the roll and take a small bite, this way I know what I'm going to expect from this roll. So by doing this I haven't had a bad experience from Sushi Diner yet so that's a big plus. The service overall is generally good but they are super busy for this small place. There are times where the wait can be 15 minutes and then there are times it is 1 hour. Not a place for a group as they only have 1 table that can fit more than four people. Their average rolls are $8.95 which is considerably good considering they do not skimp out on the fish at all. I like the sashimi salad and the nigiri (sushi pieces) since it's not over saturated with sauce. But sometimes I like to order the saucy rolls, but either way I like their options. Great place to go to for quality sushi that matches their price. YUMMY!"], ["Amy C.", "This is definitely my go to place when it comes to specialty rolls! Hands down the Smokin' Jamaican Roll has got to be the best roll I've ever had. I love the smoked flavor from the salmon. This time we ended up ordering the boat with Love Roll. Such a good deal for the price of the boat. Very delicious! I never get disappointed with this place!The staff here are very attentive to all the tables. Constantly comes around to refill the water ups and making sure that everything we order was up to par. Although this place is very small and busy, I feel like having a group of 2-6 people would be just perfect. Would not recommend bringing a big party here. This place is definitely in one of my top restaurants to eat in when it comes to sushi. Ever since day I moved to San Diego 7 months ago I have came here too many times for me to remember....so addicting! Yum!"], ["Mel T.", "I liked the concept of this restaurant. The theme is chill and they have a huge listing of options for sushi. I like that they have combo options so you can get a little bit of different rolls of sushi. The only reasons why I didn't score higher is because for one thing, the restaurant is small and very cramped. Secondly, I unfortunately had hair in my sushi. and lastly, the rolls are very rice-heavy. I got full really fast because the rolls are so big and filled with rice. I wouldn't recommend their hand rolls because it didn't taste like anything besides the rice. Maybe next time will be better but definitely check under the fish on the roll to see if there is any hair in it lol."], ["Amy S.", "This place is very small and gets filled up easily. To get on their wait list you have to sign in your name on a clipboard that's sitting right outside their door. I HIGHLY recommend to get a friend to sign their name early so you can reduce your wait a little. I came here with a group of friends (five) and it only took about 20 minutes before we got sat. When we were sat, it took awhile before a server could get to us... I thought that was pretty ridiculous. No greeting, no drinks, nothing. Which I understand that they have other tables but they should at least have the decency to let us know that they'll be with us in a few minutes. Communicating with your customer(s) is key. I finally got a server's attention after a good 10-15 minutes and we were able to order. My friends and I ordered the 'Love' roll boat, calamari, and karaage. The sushi was fresh and really good. The appearance wise was also really amazing! The boat had the options of 4 different sushi rolls, all depending on which one you choose. Every boat came with seaweed salad, calamari, edamame, various tempuras, a small salad, and hibachi chicken. I now understand why people wait so long just to eat here. Everything is really good!So besides the service, the food is great. The girl that was serving us was more attentive towards the end which was nice. I'll definitely come back again!"], ["C S.", "This is the classic hole in the wall place you hols on to really tight. The quality of the sushi is great and prices are really good too!

BOB MARLEY!!!!The price is damn cheap for what you get. You get tasty sushi, it's humongous in size, and you can tell that they take pride in what they make. This place epitomizes what it means to be a hole in the wall restaurant. Usually get the calamari sushi or any of the other rolls. They are creatively themed and taste good no matter what you order. Have yet to be disappointed whenever I go. Obviously some places taste better, but your wallet and your taste buds will thank you. Get your rear to sushi diner!TL; DR Taste good (7-8/10) and tastes even better when you get the bill."], ["Liz P.", "Still our favorite for sushi in San Diego.

It's top notch! We have enjoyed everything we have tried and are always amazed at how much food you get for the price. Try the fish cakes...they are amazing! It's tiny and has unusual decor, but we don't care...it's all about the sushi for us."], ["Sara S.", "I absolutely loved this place! Honestly, I don't like seafood or sushi, and this place changed that for me. I ended up trying multiple types of seafood and sauces, which is not usual for me. I got the diner bento box, and I was impressed with what I got for $10. So many different kinds of food!My boyfriend got the LOVE Combo of sushi rolls and really loved it. Apparently that plate was the best he has had as far as sushi goes.I highly recommend this place!"], ["Daphne L.", "What can go wrong with a Bob Marley themed sushi place? Nothing.I love coming here for dine-in and take-out because the quality of the sushi surpasses the price you pay for it. I love their calimari roll because it is huge. Their sashimi is also very fresh and totally worth checking out.There are about 10 small tables in this place (including the patio and bar area) and it is always packed. I suggest you pick take-out because the quality is the same and you don't have to deal with the crowded atmosphere.Service is always good and food comes out pretty fast.

Don't know how much I need to repeat that. 99 cents!!!! Small hole in the wall, so make sure it's more of a smaller group, or come ready for about a 10-20 min wait depending on your group size. Worth the wait though. Bob Marley themed sushi place by the way, unusual, but makes for quite the interesting roll assortment. Very flavorful!!

A Bob Marley themed sushi restaurant - YEA MON! Don't expect the highest quality, mouth watering sashimi and sushi here. The quality isn't the best, but for the price it's pretty good. Basically, it's a notch above Japanese grocery store sushi like Mitsuwa and Marukai. It's more fresh than those places. But it's definitely not the highest quality you'll get at a $$$ or $$$$ sushi bar. Most rolls are between $7-$14 depending on what you order. Great, friendly and nice people work here. The sushi chefs are awesome and seem like hard working, down to earth guys. If you're looking for a quick and easy place for sushi, this is your place to go."], ["A. W.", "The location is terrible, the parking lot is the worst, and the seating is cramped... But this is my favorite spot for good quality sushi. The restaurant itself is kind of quirky with decor but the food, service, and sushi chefs are all really top notch, and the prices are fair! I am absolutely in love with their sashimi and the quality of their fish. I'm really not big on fancy rolls with lots of special ingredients. In my opinion it takes away from the actual fish, why eat sushi in the first place if all you get is that stuff? The quality of a place lies in the strength of the nigiri and sashimi they serve. And this is definitely the best salmon sashimi I've had. It is so buttery and absolutely melts in your mouth! Like I said I'm not crazy for elaborate rolls with 50 ingredients and crazy combos. But if you're into that stuff, they offer a lot of that sort of thing too. Just avoid their \"parking lot.\"It may not be super traditional japanese sushi but it is definitely top notch. definitely try their nigiri & sashimi."], ["Christine C.", "Always had the idea to come in and try this place out but always came at the wrong time with the line of people down the block. Fortunately, there was no wait at all this past Friday afternoon! I agree with most that the quality of the sushi is not the best, but worth the money you'll be spending. We ordered 3 rolls and 6pcs of sashimi which totaled at just under $35 (pictures included!) the food came out quicker than it took us to decide from their wide variety of rolls. Business picked up as we began eating, but their staff seemed to spread themselves and respond to the customers needs very well. 4 stars are for the food, price, and service. Unfortunately, it is a small area and was uncomfortably warm inside for a gloomy day :( We definitely will be back here again!"], ["Soojung K.", "Definitely my go to sushi spot! Very chill atmosphere, I mean they play Bob Marley in the background. Love the Spicy Salmon Peno Crunch Roll and Bruce Lee Roll.

Looks pretty rough from the outside, like something you'd find on an island. You walk in & bob marley is everywhere (love it already) & greeted before we even took a step inside.It's a quaint restaurant w/ nice staff. My boyfriend and I ordered spite (canned), lemonade (definitely home made, SUPER sweet.. a little TOO sweet), mussels appetizer (even though it came out last & about 10 minutes after the two rolls), spider roll, & crunch roll. Crunch roll was amazing. Tempura flakes tasted fresh (not that out of the box crap). That's my go-to roll usually & this place nailed it. Plus it came out super quick. I love soft-shell crab, but the spider roll here wasn't that great. I actually only had 1 piece then my boyfriend had to take one for the team & finish the rest. Hehe.I would definitely come back. The restaurant opened at 4, & we came at like 4:10. There were 2 tables already there when we got there & the restaurant was basically full by the time we left. So this place is seriously a hidden gem. Don't knock it till you try it & this is definitely an example of how you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.Nom nom nom."], ["Brian E.", "Charming neighborhood sushi bar. Come with a special friend because this place is intimate and not ideal for big groups. The staff was attentive but not disruptive. Perfect. The specialty rolls are killer and there are happy hour deals. And who doesn't love walls decked with Bob Marley and Rastafari flavor.The portions are pretty big so don't bite off more than you can chew. We got the chicken karaage to start. It was fine. Same with the baked shiitake mushroom roll. It was way too rich and heavy for me. But now for the really good stuff. The Smokin' Jamaican was awesome. Salmon and eel sauce goodness with just a hint of smokiness. The Bruce Lee was nice and light with a wasabi sneak attack at the finish. The Protain Rainbow Roll was hands down one of the best specialty rolls I've had. Well-balanced and well-suited for the San Diego heat."], ["Erika M.", "I give 4 stars because this place is my absolute new favorite sushi spot! A couple of tips, call in to order Togo! This place is extremely small, the smallest restaurant I've ever been to. After waiting about 15 mins outside to be seated the waitress calls my name, they only had one 4 table booth available and outside seating. She says to me \"we have outdoor seating available\" I told her I want to eat inside since they DO NOT have heat lamps outside. She gave me a long look and said \"okay\". She did not want to give me the indoor seating bc there was a party of 4 that came after me. But tough shit, first comes first served. I thought her attitude was pretty rude. She had no friendly attitude and did not smile while taking my order. Anyways if you come in a party of 6, they charge 15% gratuity! They have a sign for this.Also my favorite sushi rolls are the protein roll & green day roll. I also reccommend their chicken karrage, their chicken is tender and soft, the sauce that goes with it is delicious too."], ["Paola S.", "BEST SUSHI place ins San Diego!!! I've recommended this place to so many people, affordable and great flavor, their rolls are perfect size. I always get smokin in jamaica and i've tried all of their appetizers which are great.

Came here because of the reviews but was blown away by the poor service. The female owner took my order of spam masubi, salmon sashimi, baked scallops roll, baked mussels, bento box and an asahi. They forgot to bring out my spam masubi so we reminded them and the server tells me his boss forgot to write it down. We were in the middle of our meal and reminded them we ordered a beer when we first arrived. Server apologized and brought it to us. After finishing the meal we mentioned they forgot our miso soup and we requested the check even though they hadn't brought out the baked scallops roll. He brought our check and our baked scallops in a to go box. We told them this was a little too late for the baked scallops and we didn't want them anymore. The female owner said she doesn't recognize returns on food even though, the food was so late that it came out in a to go box with our check! Food was mediocre. The service was truly atrocious.

Super convenient when you want something low/no-carb since you can request \"no rice\" on any CYO rolls. Nutritious and delicious."], ["Christina S.", "When we arrived, the place was packed. While it is a small restaurant (maybe 30ish people max at a time), the wait time wasn't very long. \u00a0 The ambience at sushi diner was casual and very unique with many different decorations representing Bob Marley. We sat at our table and looked through the menu. There were many MANY different choices of sushi rolls. It took me a little while to decide.Janelle decided on the Smok'in Jamaican Roll, while I had decided to get the Baked \"UB 40\" Roll and Spam Fried Rice. After ordering, Janelle's roll had come out first pretty fast. My roll and rice on the other hand did not come out until much later (Janelle had finished her roll before I had even received mine).So I will review Janelle's roll first (I had a chance to have a couple bites of hers). The Smok'in Jamaican Roll has crab and eel inside, and seared smoked salmon, cream cheese, eel sauce, and spicy mayo on the outside. It was very delicious and refreshing, and also very flavorful. I can see why this roll has become Janelle's favorite roll.Next, the fried rice had come out. The spam fried rice was decent, but nothing too special. It lacked in flavor, for the spam was very overpowering and salty that I couldn't really taste anything else but that. I had put a good amount of black pepper on it (I enjoy fried rice with a lot of pepper), and that seemed to have calmed the salty taste of the rice. There was a good amount for the price, which is always nice.Lastly, I had received my roll. I understand that this roll takes a little bit longer to make than the raw rolls, but it would have been nice if Janelle and I could've eaten our rolls together (even if that meant waiting a little longer). Inside the Baked \"UB 40\" Roll is spicy tuna and cream cheese, and on the outside is baked scallops and crab, spicy mayo, black pepper sauce, and green onion. While it may have taken a while to make, this roll is very filling. I had ordered a baked roll over a raw roll because I was very hungry and baked rolls seem to fill me up better. This roll definitely had made me feel full. It was very flavorful and pretty delicious.I really enjoyed the food here at Sushi Diner, and will definitely return soon to try some more."], ["Naomi P.", "This place is awesome!

By noon this place is almost packed, so I get in at least at 11:45. I heard that they used to have discounted rolls for lunch, so a $15 roll discounted to $7.50. But in the past year or so, they just switched to lower prices. Today, my co workers (a mans man and petite gal) went with me (average gal) and we shared three rolls and a spicy garlic edamame. Our bill was $30. Three-Oh. The rolls always taste fresh, never leave me heavy or queasy and always satisfy. I love their crunchy dragon, but I also contemplate drinking eel sauce. #exaggeratingThe service is best described as dependable. I can depend on water (my beverage of choice), delicious miso, warm edamame and lovely rolls.
