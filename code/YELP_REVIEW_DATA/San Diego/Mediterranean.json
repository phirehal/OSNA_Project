I could slather it on just about everything on the menu. I sometimes get cravings for it. My biggest failing as a parent might be raising a child who doesn't share my appreciation for this delicious food. Enter Micho'z Fresh Lebanese Grill. They deliver to my house! Not only that, they have a kid's menu that includes chicken strips and fries for my picky son! I'm a fan. So many choices on the menu. I wasn't sure what to go with. I figured since they have food my son will eat it's a safe bet that we'll be ordering again so I got a few vegetarian favorites this time around. Everything arrived hot and packaged well for travel. Nothing was forgotten. They even packed me a bag of their tasty saj bread. It was perfect with their delicious and oh so creamy Labneh. I'd definitely order it again and again. The lentil soup really hit the spot, I started with that. It had little chunks of carrots and potato in there and was garnished with cilantro, so wonderful. I also got the falafel which came with tomato slices, pickles, and pickled carrots. Everything was great and fresh tasting. The falafel was cooked just the way I like it, super crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Finally I moved onto the spinach and cheese pie. Ooo it was heaven sandwiched between unleavened bread. That delicious spinach combined with tomatoes, onions, mozzarella, and feta cheese. Absolutely divine. I couldn't stop myself from slathering some Labneh on it, because I'm kind of a glutton :-)The gentleman who brought our order was really friendly and someone called from the restaurant to see if everything was good. I was very happy with the service and will definitely order again. My son had commented after I gave him his food \"is this a new place?\" Then later, \"order from them again.\" Haha, he's so picky but even he was pleased."], ["Antonio G.", "Delicious omg! \u00a0Had the michoZ rotisserie half chicken $11.99 and it came w hummus, thin pita and nice light crisp salad. \u00a0I loved the garlic sauce! \u00a0It's a must. \u00a0The seasoning was excellent and everything was perfect! \u00a0Now I'm used to have amazing middle eastern foods in LA, so I know I have finally found a gem here in SD! \u00a0Hubby had the gyro, it was huge and on special for a $4.99. \u00a0Very tasty, light enough for lunch w all the lettuce and he feels great afterwards. \u00a0We are coming back again and again. \u00a0You cannot beat this flavor and generosity for the price! \u00a0I'm stoked! \u00a0Enjoy Yelp friends, you're welcome. \u00a0I almost want to keep them a secret but I'm sure word will get out. \u00a0They deserve to be very busy w regulars and must stay in business!! \u00a0I would say it'd be cool to add some rice to my dish. \u00a0However, the tawook (kebab) does come w rice so I can order that and it's only like $2 more. \u00a0Prompt and amazing, do it for lunch! \u00a0They have $5 specials and then they have happy hour after 3! \u00a0M-F. \u00a0Yay!!! \u00a0Why have a boring burger or another heavy burrito, when you can have this? \u00a0You will see. \u00a0Go."], ["Paddie C.", "Wandered in here on a Thursday afternoon and got the vegan combo platter as a snack, along with coffee, tea, and baklava.

I'm picky about soups with beans and peas, but this is so good. The gyro platter with rice is generous and spiced just right. The spinach pie with feta was interesting as it has mozzarella as well. I mentioned to the owner that I prefer a heavier feta taste and he was very accommodating and said he will add extra feta and less mozzarella whenever I ask for it. The Lebanese coffee was nicely strong but not bitter. The owner is charming and always pleasant, as is the staff. I'll be back again soon."], ["Sam A.", "This place is great. I been eyeing it for sometime, although my love for Asian food always gets in the way and very occasionally I eat middle eastern food. We came in during the hillcrest pride block party. Right away we wanted a sit outside in their beautiful patio with a lot of fresh air. They have a pre-set \"fast menu\" .. It wasn't very fast at all.. But they were busy it's fine as long as the food tasted good it's worth the wait. It was really good! I had the gyro wrap, I thought it was gonna be a gyro with the thick pita but it was rather like the menu said a wrap! It was still good but not what I was craving for. It's no worries. Still very yummy. Also got the house salad on the side---I didn't really eat it it just an OK house salad. My partner had the kabob plate. The meat was very tasty, the meat was prepare with a variety of spices that to me it taste like Christmas, powerful scents of nutmeg and cinnamon. It was comforting. Overall real good place, fresh ingredients, healthy! And pretty cheap! \u00a0The only thing I didn't like was how they serve the food. It was in disposable plates, plastic spoons, and paper cups. Felt like I was being serve cafeteria food. But the taste was there and this problem was easy to ignore."], ["Jane S.", "Yum! Just got back from having lunch here and the chicken kabob was just what I needed. Fresh and super tasty. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the Lebna starter!!!!! I don't know if it's cheese or yogurt or both but it's my favorite Mediterranean food!!! TRY IT!

Great experience!I'd heard from several people that the food at this place was delicious, but the low-key ambiance never really pulled me in from the street. My roommate convinced me to give it a try. I was absolutely shocked by how good the food was. I had the kebab sampler with the lentil soup. They served salted carrots as a light snack before the meal. Surprisingly delicious, and much healthier than chips and salsa. The lentil soup was hearty and filling, perfect for the cool night air as I sat on a barstool looking out the window. The real stars of the meal were the kebabs. I expected some dried-up shoe leather with grill marks and drenched in sauce. Instead I was served perfectly (and I do mean perfectly!) grilled chicken, steak, and lamb. The outside was seared to perfection, and the inside was exceptionally juicy. I am tempted to make a YouTube video showing how amazingly well cooked this was. Eat there.

Less salty, more acidic (but not too much) which was very refreshing- grape leaves: tasted fresh, and not old like some places I've been to. nice an soft, with the ingredients inside the leaves were pretty good- hummus with pita-ish bread? tasted like decent hummus. I like the unleavened bread also. It was a new texture.- salad: like the dressing, but tasted a little old.

In fact, I have never ordered anything off the menu, because I love their Buffet so much. This place has opened my eyes to what is possible when you take simple ingredients, and turn them into amazing dishes. The buffet is split into 4 sections. First a small soup section, with two soups that are usually Lentil or Lemon Chicken Rice soup. The next section is all Vegetarian dishes.The third all meat dishes. The fourth being a cold section of \"Salads\" and a few unique deserts.As a vegetarian, I'm blown away at how you can take a carrot and completely create something so full of different flavors. The same can be said for the Okra, the zucchini, the eggplant, etc... My favorite dish they have is the Moussaka. I'm not sure what the amazing top layer of this Lasagna-esque casserole dish is, but it creamy almost like cheese, but it's not cheese at all. Below that is a concoction of different vegetables, and I'm telling you this goes faster than the rest of the dishes.Of course I skip the meat section, which I will tell you everyone that eats it loves.The salad section is crazy. Fatoosh Salad, macaroni salad (But like you have never had before), Tabouli, Garlic Cabbage something or other (Amazing), Hummus, Baba Ganoush, A Garlic paste made with potatoes, Cold spicy rice dish. The list goes on. I almost like the cold section better than the hot section. For desert there is usually bread pudding, some sort of Rose water and rice pudding or something, and a few others including this amazing shredded carrot and coconut dish that I've only had at Fairouz. Very simple, yet incredibly delicious.I'm only sharing this next bit of info because I think you deserve it. Order the fresh lemonade, and ask them to put Rose Water in it. I would come there just to drink a glass of that. It's the best Lemonade I've ever had.The place has a nice quiet vibe, and the walls are covered with paintings from the owner (alnashashibi.com). This place is a family owned and operated place, which is very few and far between these days. This place has options for every one (Meateater, Vegetarian, Vegan, even Raw). I wouldn't even hesitate to give this place 5 stars. Go there!"], ["Lesley M.", "I stopped by last week for lunch with my gal pal Justine H.

There were so many nice hot vegetarian dishes on there and the salads looked great. The buffet is priced at $12.99. It includes quite a few meat dishes, two soups, salads, desserts, many hot side dishes, and warm bread brought to your table. They also have a punch card for the lunch buffet, not a bad deal if you come here often. The service was good. As soon as we sat down, our drink order was taken. We went off to conquer the buffet. There were so many great vegetable options. And the lentils, I just love anything with lentils. The cold side had some great salads as well. The desserts were kept over there, assuming you still have room. I tried a couple small portions of these and they were tasty. I'd definitely come back again."], ["Layla M.", "Wow! Great Food!

Some of the plainer looking steamed vegetables at the beginning sometimes look squishy and not very appetizing, but the okra tastes fantastic and I love the green beans too. \u00a0 My kids love them as well, and my kids usually boycott vegetables at home. \u00a0For protein, there's always leg of lamb, chicken, meatballs, gyros and sometimes even more. \u00a0The moussaka topping is strangely addicting for me, and although I'm not routinely a huge fan of cooked egglant or zucchini, they taste marvelously rich and wonderful in this dish. \u00a0Often, there will be other alternative casserole style vegetable dishes and maybe a mixed rice dish. \u00a0I always go for these combos and I'm never disappointed. \u00a0Salads are all wonderfully tart and light - my favorite is a very unassuming tomato, cucumber and onion mix in a fresh vinegar dressing. \u00a0I just cannot get enough of it. I love the tzatziki with the gyros and the freshly toasted pita that they bring to your table. \u00a0I enjoy the tabouli which is very different from the store type at most middle eastern markets. \u00a0This one has a kick to it! \u00a0 I always want baba ghannoush, but it's not always available. \u00a0The marinated carrots are also an addiction for me and the kids. \u00a0We get at least 2 scoops each. \u00a0There are a wide variety of extra sauces to choose from, some garlicky, some spicy. \u00a0Then to top it all off, there are no less than 5 different desserts to choose from. \u00a0I like the shredded coconut carrot salad, but my kids prefer rice pudding with rosewater, and tapioca. \u00a0I don't know what's in the small brown cake squares but they are delicious too. \u00a0The buffett doesn't come with a drink, but I recommend the lemonade with rosewater or iced tea with rosewater. \u00a0After all of that, it's the hospitality of the family that sets this place apart. \u00a0Their love of each other and what they do comes out in everything you eat. \u00a0All the art on the walls has come from Mr. Nashashibi's soul. \u00a0He is so incredibly prolific, there isn't a blank space anywhere! \u00a0He also writes poetry which is now featured under the glass at the tables. \u00a0He's very romantic and lyrical. \u00a0He always comes to our table multiple times to chat and service the table himself. \u00a0Something about him makes me feel like a little kid again and I end up feeling guilty that I don't take my own dishes to the kitchen, lol! \u00a0He is always so caring and hospitable that my kids adore him. \u00a0Lastly, don't forget to sign up for the new Birthday Club and get a frequent diner card!"], ["Lisa D.", "What a great place! \u00a0From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcome.

There was a strange seasoning that just didn't seem to fit for me). \u00a0 For dessert I could not pass up the Rice Pudding with Rose Water, man that was SO good YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! \u00a0I also tried a bit of their Basbousa which was also delightful but very sweet. \u00a0To drink I ordered a water with lemon and then tried a beer and the Turkish coffee with honey to end the whole experience. \u00a0I would come back here! \u00a0The menu if a bit different for lunch then it is for dinner. \u00a0The dinner buffet includes Lamb!

He's also an accomplished lawyer, artist and poet. You'll find your table decorated with placemats featuring his art and poetry. Take time to browse the art adorning the walls.But, you want to know about the food, don't you? The food is delicious, fresh and plentiful. Our favorites were the spicy pickled cauliflower (who knew?), the mixed bean salad with chickpeas, the Lebanese chickpea salad, the saffron chicken, and the jalapeno relish. You can help yourself to all the humus, tzatziki, and beef and lamb as you desire. You should ignore any reviews that slam the falafels as Fairouz doesn't serve falafels and never has.

Aladdin Mediterranean cafe is an excellent restaurant with authentic flavors that you cannot miss!! First of all, their menu includes all the famous Mediterranean dishes from appetizers to herbal teas. In addition, they also have wood-fried pizzas that are inspired by traditional Middle Eastern flavors. Most importantly, they also offer traditional Lebanese dishes and exotic rice dishes. With these countless delicious choices, I decided to go with something more basic. I ordered an entree plate of Lamb Tika Kabob. Each entree plate comes with salad, hummus, and rice with the main course. Many people don't like lamb because its smell or taste. However, I think it's hard to cook delicious and tender lamb dish than other types of meat. Therefore, I decided on trying their lamb dish. The salad came first before the entree plate. I was shocked with the waitress brought the \"side salad\" because it was a full plate of lettuce. It is lightly coated with some olive oil and vinegar and some spice. It was a perfect way to start the meal because the salad was very refreshing. By the half way through the salad, I couldn't wait to have the main dish because it must be very delicious. The main plate came soon after the salad and was indeed a big surprise as well. The portion was HUGE!!! It came with a stack of pita bread on the side, a full bowel of high quality jasmine rice, a side of hummus, and 2 skewers of lamb with onion and green pepper. I didn't know where to start the meal because they all looked super delicious. Since many Yelpers recommend their hummus, that's where I started it. I have to concur with my fellow Yelpers that their hummus is ridiculously good! I like hummus but not like a crazy fan of it. However, their hummus blew me away! Its flavor was full of fresh chickpeas with a good balance of salt, garlic, and sweetness. Furthermore, its texture is super smooth that melts instantly in your mouth. Hands down that their hummus is one of the best that I have ever tasted. Their lamb kabob was well marinated with tons of flavor and perfectly cooked next to the open fire with a touch of crispy and burned flavor. I love it! The lamb is juicy, tender, and flavorful. When you eat with grilled green pepper and onion, the flavor even elevates to the next level. They also add some fresh onions that also compliment lamb kabob very well. Their high quality jasmine rice was well cooked and served together with lamb. Needless to say that I love Aladdin Mediterranean Cafe and highly recommend you try out their authentic Middle Eastern cuisine!"], ["Felix R.", "This place is awesome. \u00a0My wife and I are here on vacation and was looking for a healthy place to eat after working out and we found \u00a0Aladin. \u00a0The food is excellent.

There is no point in expecting an appetizer to come before the meal, because here they bring everything together. And they wait for the food to be prepared and then serve whatever soft drinks we request along with the food. Their deep-fried vegetables are the best and we always make sure to order those. Those are definitely worth the wait. However, with prices as low as these it is a little unrealistic to expect a faster service.

No one received their salad until it was questioned, after the main course arrived. And when I asked the waitress for bread to accompany the more than 3/4 remaining hummus that I was taking home she said, \"we're busy and I'll ask the kitchen if it's okay\". She came back with attitude and gave me one piece of pita. I asked her for more and she said, \"we gave this to you as a courtesy.\" That response was a surprise. I then told her that I wanted more bread and she could charge me. So she brought me another piece and did charge extra. What a shame that she gave me attitude because I asked for sufficient bread to accompany the $12.00 \u00a0hummus. The bill was over $160.00 but she couldn't spare an extra piece of pita."], ["Chelsea T.", "The service was amazing ! I went with a party of 6 tonight around 7.

I had the lamb kebab wrap, which was okay, too much sauce (even after I scraped some off with my fork) but the side salad it came with was on point. My friend ordered a chicken salad and it was amazing. Sun dried tomatoes and that garlicky mint dressing just UNF so good. But yeah I guess I just ordered wrong.

My sister explained the situation, and not too long after the owner came by to offer us some complimentary appetizers and share some kind words.

Nevertheless, once our two dining companions arrived, we managed to secure a table immediately. Since there were four of us, we decided to order one of the large platters that can be shared. Specifically, we opted for the Aladdin Meza Platter ($26) that consisted of: hommos, tabouleh, baba ghanouj, chicken and lamb shawerma, dolma, falafels, hot sauce, garlic sauce, pickles, and pita bread. In addition, we also ordered a Greek Salad w/ chicken ($11.95) to share. The portions for the chicken and lamb shawerma were disappointing, arriving in two little tiny bowls. While tasty, it barely put a dent in the protein requirement that my body yearns for at dinner. The other ancillary items of the platter were decent, but nothing that caused me any real excitement. The favorite part of the meal for me was the salad. I think I spooned at least three different servings of the salad on my plate. It was delicious.

Maybe there is a language barrier, but I felt like she was upselling me. The tone was one of impatience.Whoever said the falafel patties are a mix and were told they were \"homemade\" was correct: they are a mix. Dry but flavorful, and hard to find in SD. They proportion food well, but most things are over salted. Related: Mama's Lebanese took a huge dive in quality last time we were there. They topped our hummus plate with rancid veggie oil.

The greens were fresh, the chicken was tasty but not nearly proportionate to the greens and the dressing was meh.

The baked pita was crispy and fresh, the rice oh it's well seasoned with herbs and you can see it also. The only thing is the salad. It's not as bad as I will critique since they use fresh olive and vegetables. The Greek sauce could use a bit more what do you call it. BANG to it. But overall near perfect entree!

I was looking forward to trying the dinner for two with my man, but it wasn't what I had hoped for. I felt that the kabobs were over cooked and I was looking forward to those the most. Everything else was just ok and was kind of overshadowed by the toughness of the kabob. We were the only ones in the restaurant and were able to watch Judge Judy while we enjoyed our meal. They provided plenty of pita bread and the selection on the giant plate was vast. If I could have gotten over the dryness of the meat, I would have loved this place so much.

Great food, service is prompt and always friendly, and they've been accommodating when I need to bang out some work in the corner. I'm updating my review just so I can give anyone the quick run-down on their food. They have a vast selection, and you might be looking through here to find out what people are eating. Avgolemono soup: It's a lemon chicken soup. Savory and just rich enough to remind you of your childhood American comfort food, with a proper amount of tang. I believe there are rice bits in there, so if you're feeling under the weather, or if it's a rare, chilly day in San Diego, the soup comes highly recommended. Salmon plate: You get a salmon fillet, cooked until it juuuust flakes. It's perfect. Seasoned well, and buttery. It comes with herbed rice/fries, warm pita, and a side of greek salad. Beef Kabob: The meat; It's seasoned, with a lovely char on their onions and green bell pepper. Biting into the meat produces a juicy pink middle. I don't usually do kabobs because it's so easy to overcook, but this is really good.Mediterranean Veggie Delight Plate: Try saying that ten times fast. Now this is where I get really excited. It's silly because I'm a massive carnivore, and 9 times out of 10, if I don't have meat when I go out, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Not so, here. Let me break it down; falafel balls are perfectly tender and moist, with a crunchy exterior. It's just herby chickpea mash, but done right. Hummus is great. You'd be hard-pressed not to bump into it at some point when you're here. Spinach spanakopita--it's like garlicky creamed spinach wrapped in filo dough. Definitely one of my favorites off of this platter, but it's very rich. It came with fluffy herb rice, greek salad, and warm pita. \u00a0$9.95 and it's a lot of food I nearly couldn't finish it. Nearly.This probably brings me one step closer to the dark side, but boyfriend is pescetarian, and I'm super excited to let him know that I ate veggie food, and I am happily sated."], ["Annalisa Y.", "First time here and I will be coming back!

Well certainly no lie there, after we sat down three nurses, staff member and two doctors come in. Came in and checked out and noticed they have lunch combos.

The hummus and pitas were portioned well, which seems silly but I always find myself either asking for more pita or running out of hummus with pita leftover. The little things, friends. Oh yeah, the hot sauce comes in a bottle that looks like ketchup and is awesome... drown your food. It's okay and who says that lambs and chicken don't like getting a little wet?

If I had the money, I would totally book a trip back to Sweden just for the doner kebabs.But, alas, I'm a broke college student and I thought that my craving for good quality doner kebabs would never be fulfilled no matter how many times I try seek the out. Then, I stopped by for a quick bite at The Kebab Shop. Cue majestic music and a halo around a lamb/beef doner kebab roll. You can order in 4 forms, a plate, a doner box, a doner kebab, and a shawarma. From there, you pick your meat, sauces, and extras (like fries to California-ize your order). I've only tried their lamb/beef and their mixed meats but the meat is perfectly seasoned and pairs well the garlic yogurt sauce. Speaking of which, the garlic yogurt sauce is truly droll worthy and is the closest the garlic sauce that i had grown to love back in Sweden. I would probably drink the stuff if I could (not that I'm going to because I'm a lady, you know). The doner kebabs are super filling and refreshing with all the greens that they grow in. The doner boxes are kind of like salads but with rice or fries. It doesn't seem like a lot at first but it's the perfect amount. I have yet to try the sides but I have heard good things about the hummus.Seriously, stop by. You won't be disappointed. The times I've been here, the cashier has been the same lady who has always been cheerful and super nice. Sign up for their doner club and you get a doner for free for your birthday :) \u00a0Now, if only they had kebab pizzas too..."], ["Anastasia D.", "I like my Mediterranean food and this place is just OK. I went here for the first time looking for garlicky chicken and some tasty hummus. I ended up getting the chicken plate with a side of basmati rice and spicy hummus. I read the reviews to get their garlic sauce, and made sure I did, but I've had better. The chicken was good, but again, I've had better. The basmati rice was nothing to rave about, but the spicy hummus was a pleasant surprise. It was definitely much more spicy than I was expecting, and pretty tasty. I think I got most excited when I saw that they have the sour purple plum powder in their condiment section that is normally served with Pakistani food. I LOVE that stuff! \u00a0But overall Ehhhh."], ["Martin D.", "My wife and I love gyros, and hummus. My wife loves Olgas in Michigan which I must admit is the best!

But I was more in the mood for the rotisserie plate today, so I ordered the chicken rotisserie with Algerian eggplant and fries as the two sides. This came with a free soda drink thanks to the yelp check-in! The chicken (mostly dark meat) was tender and full of spice. The eggplant salad was also very good, although the fries were pretty average. Next time I'll try a different side. That's part of the fun.One thing that was disappointing was a side order of hummus. For $4, this should be a lot better. The hummus was small, course and flavorless, and it came with a few wedges of cold pita bread. I should have returned this. Disappointing.

Mixed meat came with chicken and their beef/lamb (gyro). Everything about this doner was spot on. Flavor was on point, fries were crispy, the wrap is 10 times better than any tortilla, and the white garlic sauce brings everything together. I have determined that each doner needs 3 white and 3 red sauces. Thats how many I usually use. What I love about this place is that they emphasize customization. If you can think it up they will make it for you. So go wild!The service here was great as well. Tables were cleaned and the people working here are great. Super friendly and welcoming.

Not that many, lemme tell you that. That description sounds way too ornate to be quick and cheap, but who cares because The Kebab Shop has outdone fast food. When I say fast and cheap, it is not actually that fast - probably takes 7ish minutes - and cheap - probably around $10 - but relatively speaking it is.The portions are very large, which is probably the California part of the establishment's description; the lamb/beef is great, which is probably the Mediterranean part; and I am too uncultured to understand the Turkish part (but I do know Turkey is in Europe and not just the large bird). So I've had the Lamb/Beef D\u00f6ner Kebab every time I've visited. The meat combination sounds relatively sketchy, but it is a marriage of deliciousness. The pita-esque tortilla is also wonderful and topped with the garlic yoghurt sauce... yum. Everyone needs to experience this sublime example of fast food although it is slightly more expensive than most - I think you would rather eating identified meat over the mystery meat featured in other place's menus.

Lunch is under $10, whereas dinner can be a little pricey. But they roast and grind their own spices at this restaurant, and who else does that any more?! The owner is kind and passionate about his business, and if it's not too busy, he's happy to stop by my table and chat about the food.Four of us were delighted with the Lebanese Feast for 3. We had 3 adults and 1 child. My little granddaughter ate 3 helpings of the hummus on the homemade pita! The Lebanese Feast comes with a plate of meats, and various outstanding side dishes. On the meat plate, the Kafta Kabobgee were my fav, with the best texture and flavor I've ever found in any Kafta. The chicken shish kabob was a little dry, and could have used more tenderness and less cooking. The Beef Shawarma was good. The Lebanese Feast for 3, for $49, also comes with the best Baba Gannouj I've found, very fresh Tabbouleh, mild Hummus, Spicy Olives, and wonderful homemade pita bread.In addition to the Lebanese Feast, we also tried the Kibbeh Beirut, filled with eggplant, roasted almonds, & pomegranate seeds. This is a colorful and tasty appetizer! We also enjoyed the Labneh, which looks like sour cream and tastes like yogurt. Both yummy! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kouzy for $19 on the dinner menu is braised lamb with aromatic spices served over rice with roasted nuts. I ordered this on my previous 1st visit to this restaurant. The lamb is tender, and I love how the delicate spices compliment the lamb, and yet there's no overpowering sauce. Warak Inab is 4 grape leaves stuffed with rice, parsley, lemon juice & olive oil for $4.75 on the dinner menu. These are the best vegetarian stuffed grape leaves I've ever tasted. The textures and flavors are enjoyable, as they are made from fresh ingredients. I enjoyed fantastic service from the owner himself. He said they roast and grind their own spices twice a week. On my second visit, we also met the owners wife. This sit-down restaurant is a wonderful find!Oopsie! You won't find a photo of the freshly made baklava, because it literally disappeared in an instant! So good... The texture of freshly made baklava is amazing. I like the baklava better than the Karabeege for dessert. \u00a0Wine & beer are offered. My glass of smooth red wine was $7.50. The interior is spacious, and the tables & chairs are comfortable and attractive. I'll definitely return to try the Mediterranean fish! In fact, you can expect me to try every item on the delightful menu!"], ["Omar S.", "My prized possessions include a passport, strong teeth, and several Lebanese friends that cook.The marvelous thing about Lebanese cooks is that while they're capable of grand performances (attend a Lebanese wedding and try not to use the word \"sumptuous\"), they can also, with seeming ease, delight the palate with the feast of small plates called \"mezze\". And it's not just the dishes' tastes that gratify. The mezze looks beautiful, and the preparations are presented a few at a time, so the meal is a bit of a show. I recently enjoyed the mezze at La Miche Kabobgee, one of few real Lebanese restaurants in the County. My dining companion and I were greeted kindly by owner Nabih Geha. I whispered a budget to Nabih and asked him to guide us. He smiled, removed our menus and began the show, bringing:- Ma'anek, small veal sausages, flame-glazed in lemon juice, olive oil and pomegranate juice. The lean and tender meat absorbed tart, sour flavor from the saut\u00e9 (sour being common in Middle Eastern cuisine), making the ma'anek unavoidably craveable. Drink-the-juice-from-the-dish-when-no-one's-looking craveable. Really good.- Basturma, an air-dried beef cured and seasoned with salt, ground pepper, ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and coriander. La Miche served its basturma sheerly sliced. The meat, being fatty in a prosciutto crudo sort of way, benefited from the astringency of garnishes including delicate bits of pickled turnip.- Khubz'arabi, or Arab bread, which resembles pita but is thinner, chewier and offers more of a yeast \"bite\". Nabih and his helper were so insistent that we eat the best, freshest bread they could provide that twice, we'd only eaten a single piece from our basket before the whole thing was replaced. Arab hospitality can be over-the-top.- Labneh, strained unflavored yogurt not unlike mascarpone. Throughout our meal, Nabih kept a full bowl of labneh on our table. It was dressed with a drizzle of good olive oil, and was a delicious accompaniment to the rest of our dinner.While we ate, Nabih spoke amiably of food and family, occasionally disappearing \u00a0into the kitchen and returning with more plates. He brought:- Kibbeh, made of burghul (cracked wheat), minced onions and lean ground meat. It's often served \u00e0 la tartare (\"Kibbeh Nayyeh\") or as fried croquettes stuffed with minced meat (think arancini). We had La Miche's Kibbeh \"Beirut\", a signature dish that I haven't seen elsewhere. Nabih presses the kibbeh into cup form, bakes 'til it's firm, then fills the kibbeh cups with caramelized onion, eggplant and roasted almonds, all touched with pomegranate juice. It's one of the prettiest, most flavorful dishes I've tasted in San Diego.- Tabouleh. This salad was light, nicely balancing parsley, burghul and bright tomatoes, mint and onion, olive oil and lemon. I preferred this to the garden salad we had later.- Baba ghanoush. La Miche's take on this classic included eggplant mixed with onions, tomatoes, tahini, olive oil, and a touch of yogurt to make it very light and pleasant. I'm not usually a fan, but I enjoyed this version.- Grilled lamb tenderloin and chicken breast, served with white rice and dressed garden salad. The chicken was dusted with a pleasing, savory spice mix that Nabih let us smell, but whose ingredients he wouldn't enumerate. The lamb was tender, as its name suggests, but something else: I thought it had been marinated, but Nabih said no, it was spiced just before grilling; otherwise, its succulence was native to the meat itself.- \"Toum\" (garlic in Arabic) was offered as a garnish to the meats. La Miche's excellent toum was a delectable aioli of garlic, salt, olive oil and lemon juice in mild, balanced portions.We ate and enjoyed Nabih's company (at one point convincing him to sit with us), then suddenly, he announced that it was time for dessert.He brought out something new to me, \"ghorayeba\", a tasty semolina shortbread filled with a paste of pistachio, rosewater and orange blossom water. It was served with a slightly-sweet white sauce resembling stiff marshmallow fluff, called naatiffe.We finished with Turkish coffee, laced with cardamom and served traditionally, each demitasse being filled from a long-handled pot. The drink's aroma provided my Arab companion and I memories of comfort, family and home. After we finished drinking, I read my friend's fortune from her cup. Turns out, in the future, she needs to quit hogging the ma'anek. Once, long ago, I ate at Restaurant Fakhr el Dine in Paris. Their mezze was renowned in the City's large Lebanese community, and I saw why: over several hours, my friends and I discussed travel, politics and food, savoring dozens of unreasonably delicious dishes, each gorgeous course served by beautiful women. I might have stayed in Paris, but having chosen San Diego, I'm glad La Miche Kabobgee reminds me of that night."], ["Nancy B.", "My koobideh was delicious and so was the salad it came with. I was a little surprised that there was so very little meat on the plate, however. My friend's expensive shrimp salad was meh.

The hummus had a unique smokey flavor we really liked, the tabouli was fresh, the olives were nice and spicy, the baba ghanouj very flavorful, the potatoes were tasty, but a little too oily, and the falafel was good, but a little on the dry side. They gave us a ton of fresh pita with our order and between the two of us, were stuffed without finishing it all. We also got the manakesh, which was a little on the salty side, but still good.

It's right across the street from my work, and I've been on a Mediterranean food kick lately. So when my coworker asked to go today, I accepted without hesitation. The place is rather large and spread out. It was a group of us (four people total), and when we walked in, nobody greeted us. I had to track someone down and ask if we order at the counter or if we wait to be seated. I was simply told \"I have a hostess but she's on the phone. Just sit wherever.\"Ok. So we sat wherever.15 Minutes go by...No waters.20 Minutes go by...Waters, finally. 25 Minutes go by...Oh, are you FINALLY ready to take my order?30 Minutes go by...Bread and hummus while we wait.40 Minutes go by...Food arrived.I ordered the Mediterranean fish, with the topping (onions, cilantro, tomatoes) on the side. It was okay. The fish was seasoned with too much black pepper. The rice was meh. I didn't even touch the salad. One of my coworkers ordered the sandwich combo and asked for a side of hot sauce, and they brought out Cholula. UMM WHAT?!Now let me just pause here for a moment, I LOVE Mediterranean hot sauce. Love it, can't get enough of it. And if I find out you make a good one, you've made me a loyal customer. Don't offer me effing Cholula. If I wanted Mexican hot sauce with my meal, I'd go next door to the taqueria and eat tacos. And even they would have better hot sauce at their salsa bar. So we finished our meal at 12:50, nobody had come to fill up our waters, check on us, or anything. I was getting really agitated. I had to go up and look for someone to refill the waters and bring us the check. So in closing out this review, I have come to the conclusion that I most likely won't be back for a while. Food was ok, nothing great. I'd suggest Tigris across the street instead. This place has some serious things they need to improve before I consider this place again. Some tips for the owners/management:-Your service is horrible. You had one male server today who tended to just ONE table out of the 10 that were filled. Not acceptable. And then when asked if he could refill our waters, gave an attitude. Get more NICE, FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL SERVERS.-Keep in mind; you're in a location with business parks all around. Lunch hour is the busiest hour. Anywhere in the area you go to, you'll most likely be in and out within 40 minutes max. By 40 minutes, we had just gotten our food. -Get better hot sauce."], ["Arlene P.", "Service all the way was horrible! :(First of all I entered the place and it is empty. I stood at the register for a little bit before I was greeted. And that was actually the best of it...After that, I felt like I was treated like a second rate citizen.I asked one question and the girl who rang me up treated me like I was lame. I wanted to understand the difference between the $7 shawarma and the $9 one on the lunch specials menu. Its like after I asked her that her attitude towards me changed it went from very low energy to almost most irritated with me . :(Then while I'm waiting for my order, \u00a0in all of the expanse of the empty restaurant, \u00a0one of the girls decides to start sweeping all in the area I'm in. \u00a0That's kind of rude.Then even though I came in first the girl who ordered after me who had a much larger order was given her food first.When I asked if they forgot me they said it was coming. The girl handed me the food without a smile and so I just left. It was horrible.No wonder the place was empty when I got there. I have no idea why this place has 4.5 stars.I'm glad I tried it, but I'm pretty sure I won't be back.+++About the food. It really did have too much garlic just like the other review said. There was a good amount of meat in the burrito like shawarma. But overall it really was not a $7 meal which really came out 2 nearly $9.00 since there was tax and I added a tip. Why did I add a tip?+++About an hour after eating, I'm kind of tired and lethargic and my breath stinks. This is such a disappointment.

It's a very strategic process. If you don't eat enough, the host thinks you don't like the food and you risk offending them. If you finish your food, it looks like you're still hungry and there's more food a'coming. And so goes the never-ending cycle.The service here is amazing. The owners and the chef came by many times to chat with us and to tell us about the restaurant. They genuinely care that you enjoy all parts of your meal, and like family, they take good care of you and make sure you have enough to eat.We ordered one of the combos with three meats ($32)- beef shawarma, kafta kabobgee, and chicken shish kabob. It comes with salad, hummus, rice, roasted veggies, pita bread, tahini, and garlic sauce. We were looking to try more meats, so we ordered this combo. The Lebanese Feast ($35) is the more popular option though with two meats, rice, roasted veggies, salad, pita, sauces, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, and a variety of other appetizers.All of the food was very good. The pita bread was warm and made fresh. Smear some tahini and homemade garlic sauce on it, and then put some beef on top for a wrap that rivals the chicken garlic wrap at Mama's in North Park (one of my favorites). Plus, the chef hooked us up with enough meat to make sure that we wouldn't be hungry for the next few days. I felt guilty that I barely made a dent in the food... but then he just kept bringing us more food- more bread and baba ganoush (just because he wanted us to try it). And then when our pant buttons were about to explode and we thought we were done, he brought out a gluten-free crepe on the house that he was working on perfecting. The thing was huge- layered with bananas and chocolate and then topped with a ton of whipped cream.Be nice and talk to everyone, and maybe you'll get the special treatment.

When Nabbih, the owner, came by to say that the baba ghanoush we'd ordered would be the best we'd ever had, I was skeptical. But it was. Even for we longtime fans of Middle Eastern food. The baba ghanoush had fresh pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, which I'd never seen before, but it worked great with the flavor, besides looking pretty. I asked Nabbih about the delicate smoky flavor of the dish's eggplant and he said, \"Cooked over an open fire.\"The hummus was creamy and - a rare thing - the tahini didn't overwhelm the delicate taste of the chick peas.The Mediterranean eggplant entree had a delicious and unique flavor that surprised me. (Who knew there was anything new to do with eggplant?) The pita bread tasted fresh and tender as crepes. In fact, all the food was fresh and beautifully prepared and presented. Only the green side salad was a bit unimaginative. The restaurant itself is beautiful inside, worth finding in a newish strip mall at the corner of Ruffin and Clairemont Mesa Blvd. Nabbih, the owner, has a talent for making his guests feel welcome and the place has a warm, comfortable feel.

Side salad was a bed of green lettuce, a single slice of tomato, and a hefty squirt of some white dressing sauce that overwhelmed the greens.

But the humus that came to our table complimentary was kind of blah. My boys got a combo meat plate that also came with a plate of salad. They really liked the beef kabobs.

We were on a schedule and glanced at the clock noting that we only had 13 minutes left on our lunch hour. My husbands Turkish coffee finally arrived and we asked the waitress to pack our food to go. When she got back to collect the check I asked if there was some reason we never got our food-and pointed out all of the tables seated after us, happily munching away on their meals. We had to ASK for our food. Both of us were dressed casual, I in my workout wear and hubs in his mechanic's uniform. Everyone in the restaurant was wearing office/professional work attire. We felt slighted because we were underdressed but the restaurant was casual and it was lunch hour. We would have gotten better and faster service near by at Tigris which sells the same food for the same amount in a more efficient kitchen.

The meat is a mix of beef and lamb. I personally prefer straight up lamb, but it's still pretty good. The pita is delicious and fresh. They use a much thicker tzatziki sauce than most places -- it has the consistency of sour cream, and I suspect they make it with labneh. Very good so far.They also add way too much lettuce and tomatoes -- so much that I could barely taste the gyro the first time, and I had to ask them to hold the lettuce and tomatoes the next time I got it. They tend to pile a lot of lettuce on most of their sandwiches, which is a little strange.The quality of the sandwich is slightly inconsistent. Some days, it's better than others. At it's best, the food was good, but not amazing.Their french fries are delicious, but be warned, they are not crispy. I prefer \"tender\" french fries and that is how they serve them. They season the fries with a delicious mix of salt, pepper, and other spices.The service is very friendly.I'd come back if I was in the area, but it's not somewhere I'd go out of my way to patronize."], ["Francis F.", "Great deli and great service. \u00a0I like to order the Italian sub- I can usually have it for lunch twice since its a pretty good size. \u00a0When I feel like sharing my gf and I order the greek wrap and split it, it's also a good size but i have definitely eaten the whole thing on my own before. \u00a0We have been going to Vanoos on the regular for a couple of years now and highly recommend it. \u00a0Tip: If you are driving down mission its a bright purple building across from cold stone, you cant miss it."], ["Kelly O.", "I got the namesake \"Vanoos Grillette\" wrap and taste-wise, it was amazing.

But it was so tasty that I almost ate the whole thing!My eating partner had a pita filled with shwarma or gyro meat (don't remember) and it had a delicious cinnamon flavor. Also--very large!My only negative was that the ingredients of both sandwiches were absolutely saturated with sauce. It was dripping out of the pita.

The falafel is quite good, make sure you get it with the red cabbage. The lebne with zaatar is as good as the stuff in Israel - ask for an extra pita. The best sandwich is the kebab with tabouli and hummus. I normally don't like big combos but this was fantastic.

I've been getting a lot of the chicken salads as of late; I get two meals out of it..that is if I don't share. ;) This place is pretty much known for their wraps cause they are humongous and filling. Everything is relatively cheap but if you want \u00a0to get the most out of your money and aren't really on any type of health restriction, I'd lean towards any of the chicken wraps vs. plates/combos. While the chicken cheese is probably the tastiest with a smokey, pungent, savory flavors, the other two wraps are made with the same basic ingredients and again, huge! I've tried a few of the makanessh. Good, yet it's can be a little much. Check out the ingredients; it's a bit rich and over filing.For side options I'm a bigger fan of baba ghanouj over hummus in general. The fire roasted eggplant does make it's presence be know. I love that. The only thing is that it's a tad oily so mix it up before you dive into it.What I haven't been impressed with is the beef sharwarma. I don't know if it's suppose to be on the dry side, but I'm not digging it. I'm also not getting much out of it except for the vinegar after taste. They may use the same marinade on the chicken, but the flavors come out better on the poultry.I've only had take-outs but they have a cool enclosed patio, that's kept very clean and have a small table or two right in the front. Casual, fast, cheap and you're supporting a local business.

The size of the wrap is 2 meals worth. 5 stars there for the price. I thought, ok, marinated beef, it's gonna be fine. I was wrong. It was so salty I kept rinsing off the salt with their Batch Craft Soda - Ginger Beer (pretty good btw, 1 size cup with unlimited refills). The beef is really good, but I just want that salt to be 50% reduced. I don't feel like walking out with pre-hypertension/pre-diabetic.A pleasant surprise was the sujuk and cheese pie, the crust is just delicious, reminds me of the ones at Alforon.

The chicken shawarma has huge chunks of tender chicken inside with LTO and pickle with a nice drizzle of zingy flavored tahini. The baba ghanouj and grilled eggplant wraps both even for a meat lover like me makes for a very nice filling meal by itself and would make any vegetarians day. The only difference between the two is that the grilled eggplant wrap has actual chunks of eggplant inside along with the baba ghanouj paste. For $6 a piece for the none meat wraps and $7 for the meat based wraps you cant go wrong here as they are all of generous portion and leave one more then satisfied.

Essentially, yes, that's what it is.. But MAN was it THE best wrap I ever put into my mouth, and for only $5. So much flavor! And the pita all nice and toasty. It was perrrfectly filling but so good I want another. I came here several months ago and had a falafel salad that was fresh and delicious too. But I want to keep trying different wraps now! They had a ton of choices, it took me 10min of drooling over the menu to decide... Most other wraps look a little bigger and probably two portions, if you can stop yourself. But that Manaeesh!! (seriously considering walking back for round two...)Mama knows what's up!! Oh and baklava. I left without a piece. That was the wrong decision. My sweet tooth is so angry right now! :)"], ["Jeff T.", "I love Mama's! It's very close to where I live and consistently has good food.

It's huge and plenty of food, especially when coupled with a bag of chips and drink or salad and appetizer. Make sure you bring a good appetite. The prices are fair and you always get plenty of food.

The spinach tasted very vinegary to me...i thought it was just ok.Maybe the cheese and spinach would have been better.We also got a vegetarian platter that came with hummus, baba gnash, an herb salad (forgot the name), falafel and home-made pita bread. The hummus was fantastic, but the baba gnash and the herb salad i did not care for. and the falafel was a little under seasoned.If i'm in the area i will stop by and try one of their wraps."], ["Maria P.", "I have been coming here for the last 7 years and the only thing that's changed over the years is more variety on the menu and their eating area has expanded. \u00a0Yay!It's a very inviting scene, counter is small thou there is an heir of sweetness about it.The food is delicious and fresh. \u00a0You can feel the love in every bite. \u00a0The service is warm and friendly.My favorite wrap is the grilled eggplant and favorite dessert is the pistachio cigarette amongst all other sweets. \u00a0I have been telling friends to come here for authentic Lebanese home cooking.My favorite is the grilled eggplant wrap served with fresh tasting ingredients. \u00a0Awe! \u00a0I could eat the homemade bread daily if I could eat gluten."], ["Natalie S.", "Really fresh, good Mediterranean food.

I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing, but it was so good. There are two options to making your meal a combo. You can get chips and a drink or a salad and appetizer. I went with chips and a drink and feel like it would have been too much food with the other option. The sodas are craft sodas and they have plenty of options for bottled drinks as well.

The meat pies are stuffed breads with various exquisite ingredients. The cheese was my personal favorite.. The pesto was \"eh\" but then again we shouldn't have gotten pesto at a middle eastern spot.

I ate the first one, dry, very little chicken, and only a hint of garlic. \u00a0What made this wrap famous was its BIG garlic flavor, \u00a0I explained this to the women in the kitchen, and she said OK. \u00a0A few moments later another kitchen cook came out, and asked me what was said to the first kitchen women. \u00a0She explained she did not speak English . \u00a0WHAT HAPPENED to the Lebanese kitchen staff? \u00a0The second woman from the kitchen said she would make my second wrap the way it was suppose to be. \u00a0While the second one looked more like a wrap than a burrito, and had more chicken in it, it still lacked that great garlic flavor that made this wrap famous. I DO NOT KNOW IF I WILL RETURN. Perhaps Lebanese food ought to be made by Lebanese people. It is things like this that take the reputation of a good restaurant and ruin it, and soon you have no restaurant at all. \u00a0My guess is that this is the fault of management trying to cut down on the cost of paying employees a reasonable wage. This restaurant has a healthy clientele, should be making a profit by the looks of the prices ( I am not saying it is over priced, I just know the restaurant business). \u00a0Please try to take this a constructive criticism, and turn this problem around. \u00a0Again, what happened to the Lebanese staff?As for you folks who recently gave the chjx. garlic wrap a good review, you have missed out on what a really good garlic chicken wrap taste like.

As Albert W. said, it's also \"as big a child's forearm.\"The filling is made of large, juicy chunks of chicken breast snuggled neatly within a giant piece of fresh saj flatbread. This is the amazing part - soft, tender, delicate, and chewy. It's made to order on a traditional dome stove and I have yet to find any other place that replicates it. The wrap is fulfilling in every way, including your wallet. The pie takes a distant second place and I would outright avoid the plates, as the meat on those is on the dry side.

First, if you want coffee, don't pass it up here~! The Arabic coffee is sweet and thick as mud. The spinach, meat, and cheese pie is a hearty meal in it's own with a bite of flavor that is unmatched and leaves you savoring every morsel. The sandwich wraps are thick and light on the bready flavors while instead filling your mouth with intense flavors of the ingredients. One of the down sides is the amount of pita you receive when you order the yogurt/cream cheese. One piece is not nearly enough for the amount they give you.

I love the Mediterranean platter and the Shish Tawk plate. The shawarma plates are good, but not my favorite. The hubby loves the kefta kabob plate.

A great pickley way to add a little crunch in my mini hummus and pita sandwiches. The lentil soup is also really well seasoned; light and aromatic. I'm not into gyro but the shawarma, kabob, and kafta kabob are really good - the shawarma is as salty as the sea, but somehow they pull it off and I like it. The kabob is never overcooked and its juices get all over the pita bread making it an extraordinarily juicy sandwich. The kafta kabob is traditional ground beef kabob and not too fatty. It's juices don't get everywhere like the normal kabob, but its still great when you're feeling like ground beefy, mooooo. Try their garlic \"dip\", which I think is just garlic butter. I use it to \"butter\" the pita bread while I'm eating my sandwich. Ugh, fatty and melt in your mouth goodness. The tzatziki dip is under seasoned and too liquid for my taste. I like a thick, paste like tzatziki with chunks of cucumber and lots of mint and dill. Biggest perk: open late for drunk munchies.

With my fear of bugs, I reacted (and rather embarrassingly) with a very startled scream and when I looked at the faces of the people behind the counter, they were not surprised by the cockroach which possibly means they know there is a cockroach infestation in this restaurant.

If you do plan on getting a wrap and you're in the mood for beef, I'd recommend to get the beef kabob in your sandwich rather than the beef tikka. I got the beef tikka and although the big cubes of steak tasted great in the wrap, it was such a chore to try and bite through the pieces of meat. So get the beef kabob in a wrap!

The piece of chicken served was pretty big, but also thin and honestly just seemed like it came from the freezer section of Costco (which isn't bad, but come on, I can bake this at home). The heaping amount of basmati style rice (saffron rice?) below the chicken was decent at best and seemed a little old...if you've ever had the rice at Grill House Cafe in Miramar (perfection) then you would expect much more from this place.

First gyro meat was cut too thick by about 3x- they should take their time and cut the meat thin and then even consider crisping it on the grill a bit.

Unfortunately this place nixed that at the bud the moment I walked in and spotted the menu. I really wanted to try the fries because it sounded like it would be a Mediterranean version of carne asada fries; however, I also wanted hummus and a salad. They had no side salads (only big salads). I went with the fries and a side of hummus. Soda machine was broken but no big deal, they got it going and I eventually got some ok fizzy pop (Coke products here guys). After a ten minute wait they brought me the fries. Its basically gyro slivers on top of fries, ok so nothing fancy there. The portion was big, I couldn't remotely finish it on my own. The hummus came about eight minutes after the fries. It was pitiful! So watery, which in all honesty, I suppose was fitting with the almost paper thin tasteless/colorless pieces of flat bread that came with it. There was a small amount of tsatziki to go with it all. The taste and value were both negative, if it was cheaper maybe I'd consider coming back just on that account but it was just all around bad!

Go a little more east on Clairemont and on the left behind the Wells Fargo (before you him Ruffin Road) is a wonderful new little Lebonese place that will give you a run for your money and tastebuds.

You are served enough hummus to feed a small army, with 8 wedges of pita bread. The pita bread is thinner and drier? crispier? than I'm used to, but it was great! The chicken tikka wrap is essentially a chicken kabob in a wrap. It's also chock full of succulent onion and green pepper pieces, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles. Good, but not quite as tasty as the chicken shawarma, which is the slightly more familiar 'sliced off a spit' preparation. Same lettuce, tomato, pickle treatment. Tigris also offers gyro meat and falafel in addition to the chicken. All come in wraps and plates ($10). The plates come with your choice of sides, including really tasty-looking rice. Definitely will be back!"], ["Lauren B.", "I came in for a late lunch, around 3PM and ordered my go to , Chicken Shawarma.

The menu is pretty well made, but I only had a Donner to see if it was like the Kabab Shop located on ninth avenue!And I must admit, I was slightly disappointed. I asked for a lamb doner, and though the lamb is the same, the way in which the doner is made is not at all neat. The Pita bread was not rolled tightly, or slightly toasted, causing the doner to fall apart after a few bites. Plus as I was eating the doner, the sauce that was placed in the roll was lumped together causing me to get a full bite of just sauce. It was disgusting. Though my experience here was unsatisfying, I'm still giving them three stars. The new place was pretty full, and people seemed happy. Plus, \u00a0they offered a large menu of other things that would appeal to different people. (However, I sometimes think a smaller menu is better, so you can concentrate on QUALITY!!

Second, the wait was approximately the same the other 2 times, neither of which were during the height of the lunch rush. Lastly, when I finally decided to go ask the front where my salad was, the gentleman told me it'd be just a minute. After I sit down, what does he do?

After my experience today, I realized the problem isnt the restaurant, its the Turkish food.... which I still can't get myself to like.Born & raised in the middle east, I've tried it all. Meze (down the street by stingaree) is 1000% better than this place, but their prices are double. They don't bullshit u like this place (making the wrap seem huge by packing on the lettuce), Meze (not to be confused with Maza) actually PACKS THE MEAT, makes their wraps from freshly made doughy pita bread, so net rxn is that it all melts in your mouth. The flavor is wayyy better @ Meze. My mouth has a cum fest with MeZe (but not this place Maza)Looked through the reviews again and realized white ppl rated this joint. White people over rate everything bcz they're not used to flavor. So when they get the slightest bit of flavor that's different from pizza & burgers (like this joint), they rate it 20 stars.

I also got the Greek Quesadilla and added chicken to it, it was the best Greek style quesadilla I've tried. If you are a feta cheese fan like I am you would love it. They have a huge variety of unique hookah flavors and I would highly suggest getting one with a wine base.Best part of the night was when the belly dancer came out.

On a Sunday, after driving around Gaslamp for almost 20 minutes just to find parking, a girlfriend and I noticed Meze near where we ended up, and, both being famished and huge fans of Greek food we decided to check it out. It gives off a very relaxed but upscale vibe. \u00a0The doors are completely open so you can see the menu posted outside, and two floors and a giant bar before you go in.We got there a half an hour before brunch (and their bottomless mimosas for $12) ended, and our waiter Kevin, who was awesome assured us that we didn't have to worry about the end time. My friend is Greek, and so when we go to places like this she takes the lead on ordering, which is absolutely fine because she picks well - like the garlicky, VERY garlicky mashed potatoes to start with. They were served with bread - thinner than pita, it seemed, so I am not sure what kind of bread, but no complaints with that.Between the mimosa-ing and appetizer I didn't want to get too full so I got the appetizer portion Souvlakia, which came looking like it was smothered in buffalo sauce (see picture), but definitely was not. I hadn't had that type of sauce on chicken souvlaki before, but whatever it was was delicious! My friend got a gyro wrap which was very hearty in portion size and came with a heap of meze fries (fries made topped with feta and I think basil). Everything was just delicious. Kevin was very generous with our pours, coming by constantly to refill and to check on us. Also, someone who must have been the owner stopped by to tell us more about the grand opening event, and he was very friendly and kind thanking us for our patronage. The only weird thing we noticed - which hardly warrants taking off a star - is that they play really sad pop music. Haha. Maybe it was just that particular day, but when I'm hanging out having brunch with friends, I don't really want the saddest Coldplay songs ever being blasted around us. Otherwise, the atmosphere of Meze is nice and fun. There are three floors, plenty of seating, pretty lights and decor, and it looks like they have an extensive hookah menu, too, which people can do outside while eating. I am glad I've found a new brunch spot with bottomless mimosas and countless tasty offerings on the menu. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Michael C.", "Think creative Greek tapas.

I had no idea it could taste so good. My favorite though we're the meatballs. It had a red pepper sauce that just complimented the dish so well. \u00a0The Greek tacos were good but not great. I did like the chicken more than the steak. The only setback I had was the beer I ordered, it was flat. Oh well.

I ordered a Greek salad with minus olives and two tacos (one chicken and one gyro). First off, my salad was served with with olives. Without hesitation, Andrew snatched my salad and brought me a fresh salad one within minutes. He's definitely is a perfectionist and pays close attention to detail. We also ordered the shrimp and Ouzo fettuccini. That about a delicious dish??? OMGGGGGGG!!!! You need to try this....like, right now!!! We ended our meal with loukoumades.

Its a kasseri cheese flambed tableside in brandy with lemon juice on top, served with pita bread. \u00a0Highly recommended.The souvlaki, feta fries, feta mac n cheese, and spanikopita were also hits. \u00a0The gyro was good too, but it is prepared and presented less like a meatloaf and more like a shredded beef. \u00a0While the texture was not what I expected the flavor was spot on.Many of their best mezes are half off during happy hour (5 to 6 I think) so if you are on the fence about trying it, this is the time to go."], ["Alissa F.", "Great food, the belly dancer was a fun surprise and polite service.

Bottomless Mimosa from 10am - 2pm is $12. YES PLEASE!We grabbed a high top seat on a beautiful Sunday late morning and took a look at their menu. Funny enough, although Meze is a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant, we both ended up ordering the Huevos Rancheros because the table next to us had it and it looked DELISH! I waitress also heavily recommended it.So when our plates hit the table, I was stoked! It looked scrumptious! Tostada, refried beans, two eggs, ranchero sauce, Pico de Gallo, avocado, sour cream - and we added chicken to ours. I was so pleasantly surprised how much flavor there was in the dish even though it was an odd find at a \u00a0Mediterranean spot. And the ranchero sauce was awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!As for the Bottomless Mimosas...it was totally worth it. I've been to so many places that say they have bottomless mimosas but it's like pulling teeth to have the servers come by for refills.

I was a little skeptical of this place when I first sat down. There wasn't much options. They had a list of cold appetizers and hot appetizers. Cold were your dips and such. Hot were stuff I wasn't really familiar with either. But read through and ordered a handful of things that sounded good. I'm not a Greek food connoisseur by any means. Boy, did we eat good today! The stuffed grape leaves (not sure what the official name was) were delish! It sat upon a lemony sauce that just complimented it so well. The filet skewer was a melt in your mouth delicious piece of meat as well. Their baba ganoush wasn't a favorite but the warm home made pita made it taste so much better. The gyros are a must! Unfortunately when we were there, their fryer was down so we were forced to order a salad (yuck... lol) but it was all very very good! Fresh, and had the best balance of flavors and meat to veggie to tzatziki to pita ratio! You can't ask for more than that.I definitely recommend this place when in SD Gaslamp area.

Delicious! My favorite was the grilled asparagus salad. The salad comes with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, gorgonzola cheese, fresh fruit, walnuts, and a strawberry-fig reduction. I would come back to Meze for this salad alone. Boyfriend and brother's girlfriend, both vegetarians, both loved the pasta lahano. The night we came they had a dancer going around. It was pretty cool and it really gave them place a sense of culture and it helped create the atmosphere. The dancer asked my dad to get up and dance and after from coaxing from the family, he got up and danced with her for about 5 minutes! It was probably one of the best events of the night.Our waitress was amazing. She really helped us go through the menu and pick things to eat that everyone would like. This is a great place for vegetarians because there are a lot of dishes that don't have meat and most of them could go with some type of substitution if you wanted. They have taco Tuesdays! So if you're looking to try it out on a discount, that'd be the perfect day to come.

After some research, we ended up at Meze.They had a dip platter (that came with 6 dips) and I loved this app. Very good to share- the standout was definitely the feta with roasted peppers. On the other end of the spectrum, I didn't care for the yogurt that was strained multiple times- it resembled sour cream to me. For my entree- I had the octopus salad (most salads have an option of making it a half salad but this didn't... glad it didn't because I loved this). I don't normally order salads either! The octopus was cooked nicely- tender but not rubbery. The dressing on here complimented the dish well.

Lizzy was our server and she was great, very nice girl and highly recommended several things that of course we went for. \u00a0I especially liked how she told us about the restaurant, the owner, the history and the preparation of the food, I thought that was a nice touch!What I did like is that they have several small plates that you can share or meals if you want your own plate and are hungrier than others. \u00a0Because we had a late reservation we mostly shared all the cold and hot meze dishes.We started off with cocktails, wine and beer. \u00a0For food I personally chose the baba ghanoush which was delicious, I eat a lot of hummus so this was right up my alley. \u00a0They brought it out with delicious tasting warm pita bread which tasted similar to naan bread that you get at an Indian place, I also asked for veggies with it also. \u00a0I also had the grilled shrimp which was 3 large shrimps with a fabulous sauce, their meze sauce which I wiped the plate clean with the tasty bread! \u00a0Others at the table had the meze fries with feta, my dad enjoyed the Greek quesadilla, my Mom had the spanakopita which she thoroughly enjoyed in addition to a side of gyro meat, our other friends had the lamb plate and the tacos. One of the best things we enjoyed which came with an \"experience\" was the saganoka which was a warm cheese dish that the server brings out and lights on fire, very cool and highly recommended!I really wanted to get the asparagus salad, the pictures I'd seen looked really good but we had so many small plates that I wasn't hungry enough for that so I'll try that next time.After we were finished eating, Patrick one of the owners came to the table and introduced himself and asked how everything was. \u00a0I also thought that was a nice touch as it showed how much of a family orientation the place had. \u00a0And for the grand finale, they had a belly dancer! \u00a0She came in around 9:30pm in a cute costume with lights and danced around the restaurant so it was nice to have some entertainment!Meze is a very cool spot that's a trendy, fun spot with fabulous service and food. \u00a0It's also very large inside, I'd never been to their original location so I'm saying this is a great new addition to the gaslamp!"], ["Kasia M.", "Never been here before...So I go on customer service, drink, foodThat order.Customer service...

Put the spicy sauce on the fries which made them even better. Speedy and fresh lunch in the Gaslamp."], ["Kat R.", "! Very good. A friend suggested this place to me since I was in the area for a conference. I spent my summer in Greece and was excited by the idea of a great Greek fusion place. The Gaslamp area is really nice to walk around and this place is easily accessible by public transportation (which is a big statement from me since I'm directionally challenged enough in cities I do know - still managed to navigate my way here from Harbor Island having never been to San Diego before) The exterior is sleek and there were a good number of people out smoking hookah who seemed to enjoy the service. The interior is just as nice - open, airy, classy lounge feel. I came during happy hour which turned out to be amazing. They had $3 cold appetizers, $4 warm ones, and had Mythos beer which was a plus. Happy hour is for the bar and lounge only but since the lounge section wasn't open, I was able to grab a table and still order from the happy hour menu. Friendly, accommodating staff and the prices cannot be beat for the quality. I ordered the baba ghanoush, the meatballs, and the fiery mac n' cheese all off the happy hour menu. The food came out quickly and was really great! I thought the baba ghanoush tasted more like a hummus plate but it was just a personal preference - the waitress was really nice about it and took it off my bill since I didn't enjoy it as much. The meatballs were wonderfully seasoned and tasted really great. I wouldn't say the mac n' cheese was exactly 'fiery' (sort of expected it to be set on fire similarly to saganaki) but it complemented the meatballs well. I think the food would be a little lack luster if I were to have only ordered the mac n' cheese though - needs to be paired with something. This place seems to be creative with their food and concept. Absolutely check it out if you're around Gaslamp and if you're not, it's worth the trip. Bummed that I'm across the country! Will absolutely come back next time I'm in SD."], ["Will V.", "A respectable Greek dinner option with a spacious room, attentive service, and occasional deals like half off on all bottles of wine. Decent Mediterranean food, I had a passable appetizer/tapas style size portion of hummus, decent baba ghanoush, good dolmades, and shared a nice, half off bottle of white wine. I love half priced bottles of good wine. Who doesn't?"], ["Kindra M.", "As an out of town visitor to the Gaslamp district we had no shortage of options for restaurants. \u00a0I am so glad we ended up at Meze for a late Wednesday night dinner. We had our dog with us which wasn't an issue since they have a lovely patio that opens up directly to the restaurant so you are still able to enjoy the cool ambiance inside. \u00a0Ok now for the food- we decided to order a variety of items from the starters menu. Cilantro jalape\u00f1os hummus- excellent. The spanakopita was probably the best I've ever had, lots of spinach encased in fluffy, flaky pastry omg it was good.

We had Tiffany (waitress extroidinairre) and we ordered nearly all her suggestions. The Mezes ( smaller portions) allowed us to sample lots.

Just some basics, hummus, dolmas and a few falafel, but they do the basics well! \u00a0We devoured our snacks. \u00a0This is a pretty large space with multiple levels to it. \u00a0They do hookah here too if that's your thing. \u00a0Oh!

Wow! marinated quarter chicken perfection. Herb-citrus chicken with crispy skin. Can't believe I waited this long to try it because it will now be my go-to item on the menu. For sides, their tabouli is light and perfectly minced and has just the right amount of lemon on it. I can recommend the hummus and dolmades as well. Also, if they have the lentil soup for a buck be sure and get some."], ["Daniel T.", "No idea how many times I've eaten here by now (it's a lot), but I have never been disappointed. * Always delicious, fresh food* Great price for the quality* Very kind service.The only problem I've ever had is not being hungry enough to finish a plate.

I was so surprised by how absolutely amazing this place was! I had the chicken shawarma with a side of hummus, and oh my god. I've never had anything that good in my life. There were so many flavors that were all so balanced out! The romain lettuce was fresh, green and crunchy, the tomato was just as fresh and juicy, the chicken was cooked to absolute PERFECTION, and the hummus had the best seasoning on it. For the life of me I couldn't tell what they used but it was so good. The service? Fantastic. Absolutely WONDERFUL service. The woman who took our order came around when we were finishing our food, and asked if we enjoyed it \u00a0(which I love, I see that as such great customer service) and the woman who was running food was on point!

Thank god I'm moving up the street, I needed to find a new Mediterranean joint after leaving my regular one up north!"], ["Carissa K.", "Just finished my first meal here and it was incredible. Hands down, my favorite gyro stop in San Diego. The meat portion on the gyro was very generous and I love that they give you the sauce on the side to put on yourself. It was fresh and the pita was so soft. The service was fast and the staff is very polite. It was slow when I was in but the restaurant was very clean and well kept. They also have a red sauce on the table. It tastes just like franks red hot and well... That's an even bigger win. It's right by my house so expect lots of check ins at this hidden gem.

Got the chicken kabob sandwich with a side of domas and one of those fancy synergy komchucha drinks they had there which was a god send cause I was craving something bubbly but I didn't want an over sugared soda! So thanks so much for having those!!The chicken kabob sandwich was soooo flippen good! Big pieces of delicious chicken which were perfectly seasoned. Loved the taziki and the spicy red sauce that came on the side. Mmmmmmm so good and the best part... it was healthy!!!! The only critique I would like to make is the pita is very thin making the sandwich itself pretty flimsy. In regards to taste I wouldn't change a thing but I do wish the pita bread was a lot thicker.

The lamb meat has 16 ingredients and takes 3 days to make. It is bomb dot com. I crave it all the time! The flat bread is warm fresh Sooo good.

There are veg and non-veg options which is high on my list of considerations when the bf and I are trying a new place for the first time. The combo plates are the way to go - your protein choice, plus rice or couscous (or half and half), PLUS two sides. All for under $10!I went for the chicken kabob, half and half rice/cous cous, falafel, and hummus. It also comes with pita. I don't know what spices are involved in the making of chicken kabob, but it is really freaking delicious.

I don't know if they really forgot or if the rice was just easier and ready, but, truthfully, I wasn't really bummed since I was low key undecided.I enjoyed every part of my meal. My Kabobs were nice and moist with great flavor. Food and service wise, this place is 4 stars, but overall reviewing the entire establishment is a solid 3. I wouldn't necessarily bring the whole family here or certain friends...probably keep it solo, but it's a good place for a quick and healthy family-style meal. I swatted one too many flies out of the way while eating because they leave the door open. I get it, it's hot, but that's always a gripe of mine when eating indoors. There's no A/C, so I understood. I thought parking was kind of weird too. There are spots that are visible and then spots that are well, invisible in the center...I think. Maybe the lines faded?

The sides: the rice had a bad aftertaste, the green salad was as generic as any diner with cheap store bought dressing, and even with an itsy, teeny bite...I can tell the pita was stale. Only thing pretty passable was the tabouli. Even the tzatziki sauce was horrible.I was told that the chicken shawarma on the sandwich was dry. Reheated meat much?Service was comical, from start to end. There were no other customers, and we're not talking farm to table meals here. Took about 20 mins. before we got our food. And when the first plate came out, the server practically dropped it on the table causing some of the pieces of chicken to spill over on the table. Let me mention, too, that \u00a0there was no ice in the glass of water (whaat). Gees, there were other little annoyances, that seriously, I'm over even writing about it.

I saw the cashier making the salad without any gloves and I was unsure if she washed her hands so I was already very hesitant. The fries were good I didn't bother trying the salad the rice was bland and the chicken was terrible. It had a squishy soy consistency and didn't seem like chicken to me and you could tell the pita bread was hard and definitely not fresh. So I spent about $12 to enjoy my French fries. The worse part of the experience was they turned the lights off before we even walked out of the door. I love Mediterranean food but there are far better places in the area.

Btw, their baklava is amazing! they had some pistachio nest thing which was just perfectly crisp, sweet, and nutty.Interior is more functional than decorational but you don't need much when the meal hits the spotAnd the price is as nice as the service folks."], ["Ihab S.", "The best.

I came in for lunch and ordered the chicken kabob sandwich with fries for $6.99 (yelp.com/biz_photos/kabo\u2026) and side order of falafel's for $3.99 (yelp.com/biz_photos/kabo\u2026).The chicken kabobs were great. They were nestled inside a warm pita over a bed of romaine salad greens. The chicken kabobs were well seasoned, tender, (yelp.com/biz_photos/kabo\u2026) and went very well with their home made Tzatziki sauce filled with bits of fresh cucumber. (yelp.com/biz_photos/kabo\u2026) These two chicken kabob sandwiches were not only scrumptious, but they were healthy. These were a great choice.The homemade falafal's were outstanding and were served on a bed of lettuce. The interior was moist and packed with flavor, yet the exterior was well cooked and crunchy. (yelp.com/biz_photos/kabo\u2026) These too went very well with the Tzatziki sauce. These were great!The employees are very cool. I had a few questions regarding their food and they were very obliged to answer them.

I have made a point to try as many of these eating holes as I can in San Diego and every city I stay in. I must say that I am ecstatic right \u00a0now since my discovery of this hidden and undiscovered gem in the heart of Golden Hill. I rate this place on the following criteria:1) Authenticity of the food was amazing. Over rated places like the Kabob Shop can not hold a candle to this level of home style middle eastern cooking. It truly tastes as though it came from a seasoned veteran's home with cardinal knowledge of flavor, aesthetic visual appeal and quality of ingredients. 2) Portioning is not corporate and weighed out like other places who's pride in quality and quantity flew out the window with the adaptation to stardom and the all mighty buck as is the typical scenario that occurs over time with establishments that grow rapidly. Here you will receive an honest portion of protein, sides and whatever else you order. There is no weighing of food, it is all determined the old fashioned way by the equitable eye and gracious hands of a true \u00a0Shwarma master. If you are looking for a place to take a date or ambience, I would wait until the 4th or 5th date when you are no longer trying to impress as far as atmosphere and price. This is to be considered a staple, go to place and falls within anyone's budget being that most dishes are under 10 dollars. The Arab music videos they play all day on the TV;s also make for entertainment as they are atrocious , but funny at the same time. Give this place a try and get hooked instantly. I usually order the Chicken Shwarma Combo Place with Beef Kabob... Incredible."], ["Bec F.", "Delicious food!! We called in the order and was told 30 minutes. We arrive after 25 (to pay) and the woman behind the counter says that they're really busy which is why she told me 30 minutes...ummmm, I was there only 5min early! Then she says they haven't even started making it. So, we had to wait another 20. The food was worth the wait but the customer service needs improving. Just be honest and tell me the correct time from the beginning.

The restaurant was pretty empty - there were a couple of people picking up food and a few people sitting at one of the tables, but it was empty otherwise. After perusing the menu, I settled on the chicken shawarma with hummus and falafel. It was a bit pricey for lunch, but the serving is pretty large so I was able to split it into two meals. The chicken shawarma was a little on the salty side but still had good flavor, the falafel had a good crunch on the outside, and the hummus was simple \u00a0but in a good way. Overall, it wasn't the best Mediterranean but it's pretty tasty and hits the spot."], ["Mariam A.", "This place is a gem. Halal food. Really polite employees. And the fooood... Oh Em Gee.

There are never many people (actually none) when I walk through the door but I'm not bothered by that. It's just one of those no frills kind of joints that whips up some quality grub and in an area saturated by taco shops, it's a welcomed change.I am not really a creature of habit but both times here I have ordered the same thing. The menu is simple and makes the decision process very easy. For me it's been the beef shawarma plate with half rice and half couscous. That also includes two side orders and the tabbouleh and falafel round out the meal for me. It's a big plate of food and only added up to $8.61 after tax. Great deal!One other thing that I really like about this place that is so commonly overlooked is that they actually serve the food on real plates with silverware. It's little touches like that that make you feel like you are eating a home cooked meal prepared with some love. I always hate eating from a take out container or a paper plate with a crappy plastic fork that's going to break on you.Welcome to the neighborhood, Kabob House! I look forward to many more meals..."], ["Tom J.", "Definitely a fan of this neighborhood joint. The place is tucked away in a the corner of a small strip mall in Golden Hill and is a really good addition to the neighborhood. The menu is small which is good, so it narrows down your choices, but the food is pretty decent. I pretty much ordered everything - the Lamb plate with two sides (hummus/pita and falafel) and the Beef Shawarma sandwich. I ordered my lamb plate with rice and the two side dishes and I can say the lamb was cooked perfectly AND the falafel was one of the best I've had. It wasn't like eating a ball of sawdust, but crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - and was seasoned well. The rice was soft and fluffy and pretty damn delicious. NOW, to the mama-jamma! The Beef Shawarma was huge!!! It was a pita sliced in half and stuffed with marinated beef. One sandwich could make you full for at least half the day! It was juicy and had good flavor. My personal rule is to not go to places that I like too often because it ruins the experience each time, but I'm going to make this place a frequent stop, now that it's in the 'hood."], ["Lauren A.", "My boyfriend and I have ordered take out meals from here a number of times.

I got this location confused with another restaurant opening on Broadway but with some careful looking I figured out the door to this place is in the corner of the L shaped strip mall. The menu has large pictures on it with no guessing game of \"what does this food look like\" to the Mediterranean food illiterate. It's straight up. Combination plates at 7.99 with a choice of meat, rice or couscous, and two sides. Sandwiches are 4.99. I highly recommend the sharwama, I got the beef one and it was BOMB. Salads are 5.99 and look amazing. I thought more sides would be available to choose from. They have three choices: falafel, tabbouleh, and hummus. From what I had read on other reviews here on Yelp I thought the salads could be made part of your side option for the combo plates but I was wrong. A smaller scale sized salad as an option would be awesome to have as well as slightly more pita bread that comes out with the hummus. The kitchen is open and bright. Both the kitchen and eating area is very clean. The building was extremely hot inside but as summer wraps up this should not be an issue. The guys working were very nice and were very pleased to here we really enjoyed the food. One MASSIVE combo plate, a HUGE beef sharwama, an al la carte side of hummus, and a can of Green Tea was under 20 bucks. That's a steal for the quality of freshness and quantity of food you're getting. Another suggestion as their popularity grows is to offer up a soda fountain machine. I dig their long hours that they're open and the diversity that their cuisine brings to my neighborhood. This will be put in my regular restaurant rotation for sure!"], ["Jessica M.", "I just went here.. Open late.. Staff was friendly. Food warm and delicious!

Ordered:Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Salad w/ FetaThe pita was golden with the perfect toasted smell you'd find in a small house.The Spits we slowly turning the Beef and Chicken, just watching the swirling skewers were enough to convince me to get the Shawarma Sandwich - $4.99The Chicken was melt-in-your mouth and had a nice taste of spices that didn't take away or add too much. The Cucumber was fresh, the onions had a good fresh punch, and the tomatoes were spot on with texture. The kitchen is in the open and you can watch the cook prepare it as you order it. The Tzatziki sauce(the white sauce served with this style of food) was killer. Just a little bit for a cool taste as you bite into the pita stuffed with fresh veggies and slow-cooked meat. The Salad was just as fresh and was a great medley of green, red, yellow, and white. The salad was good choice of lettuce and spinach, the tomatoes were ripe and held the texture of fresh picked, the peppers(on the side) mixed in gave it a nice spicy pickup.Overall the word for this place - Fresh. Everything was made as we ordered it and it came in a timely fashion. You can tell the owner bought all new Stainless steel equipment and the cleanliness was outstanding. Only thing that was missing was the music you've come to expect as a Mediterranean place.

My mother had the Moussaka and loved it. Both came in large enough portions that we had food to take home. My only real sticking point was that our server had us waiting for our check to be picked up at the end of the meal so we ended up having to go inside to find someone.

The lentils were terrific and tender, and the soup was well seasoned and came with some tender carrots and celery. The soup cost $3.79.The chicken soulvaki was great and came with a very good size able amount of chicken kabob. The chicken was not only tender and juicy, but it also came with a great crispy char, that just added to the overall great flavor and texture of the chicken. The pita bread was moist and warm and the tomatoes and onions were freshly cut. The Tzatziki was great, and it was easy not to hold back smothering the pita sandwich with it.

After an amazing experience at a local restaurant, I became obsessed with tzatziki (I had never had it before! *gasp*), kabobs and everything Greek! Where had this been all my life? Unfortunately, having such an amazing experience left a longing in my heart when I tried most American Greek restaurants after that. A lot of the time the food was bland, overly fried, or just made wrong. Luckily that is not the case with Cafe Athena.Located towards the back of a shopping center, Cafe Athena is a blink and you miss it kind of place. Walking inside the view doesn't change much, with tiled floors and scattered wooden tables. Luckily what it lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for in the quality and flavor of the food served.We ordered appetizers of tzatziki and spanakopita. The tzatziki was spot on and I inhaled it. Spanakopita was new to me but triangles of flaky filo filled with a blend of spinach, onion, feta cheese, onion, eggs and basil? Sold. Very flavorful! (And great to dip in tzatziki). For the main course I ordered a chicken kabob. I wasn't sure about this because it seemed like a slightly generic choice, but I was really craving one. And boy did they deliver. The chicken was moist, uber tender and marinated perfectly, with hints of garlic and oregano. The accompanying onion, red bell pepper, mushroom and zucchini were char-broiled and cooked to the perfect consistency. Briami (marinated vegetables), rice pilaf and more tzatziki (score!) rounded out my plate.I left super full and smiling. We were supposed to get frozen yogurt after but I had gorged way too much, I just couldn't help myself. Cafe Athena is a hidden gem in Pacific Beach and some of the best Greek food in San Diego.

I was really excited to get the Sea Bass and was under the impression that I would be getting a decent amount of flame broiled fish. What I received was the smallest portion of horribly over-salted, over-cooked fish, some really delicious artichoke hearts, and the biggest portion of rice pilaf I have ever seen on a plate.

First of the decor looks old. It reminded me of Olive Garden. The decor really could use an update, but that being said I noticed that the majority of the clientele during my visit were all seniors, and I know most seniors don't like any change. So maybe its planned that way.Aside from the decor the food and service was pretty good. My wife and I came very early around 5:30pm and we caught their \"happy hour\". If you like trying smaller plates of different things, come for happy hour. They have lots of half size app plates to order and try. They are priced between $3 and $10, if I remember correctly.The humus and taziki were good but nothing special. The meatballs were pretty good, nice seasoning. The feta bruschetta was delicious, but you need to love feta to love it. The rice wrapped in grape leaves were interesting, but not out of this world. We finished with the Grecian Feast. The gyros in my opinion was sub par, kinda dry and not full of flavor. While not really gyros, I like the donor kebab places in gaslamp better for gyros. Anyways the moussaka was delicious, the lamb \"egg roll\" thing was SO great, a little sweet and packed with flavor. The roasted veggies were perfect too!All in all this was a great place, I can see why it won \"best Greek\". It's not really catering to the Hipster, Yuppie crowd so don't expect something you haven't already seen. The pricing was great considering happy hour, we had a mountain of food for under 40.

The lentil soup was pretty good too. I think it needed some kick and my coworkers all seasoned it. I wanted Tabasco, but none was in sight. So I threw tazitki and a squirt of lemon in it, which was really good. My boss recommended the chicken sloviki or chicken aoli because he eats there all the time. We all didn't listen and ordered the gyro lol. My first gyro came out ICE cold and he of course teased me about it with an \"I warned you\". Anyway I asked my hot waiter if it was supposed to be ice cold he said no and took it back. The new one was very hot and the pita was great but the meat was just mediocre. It also had too much lettuce in it. I generally do not like lettuce in my gyro in any circumstance. My boss was right. Next time i'm listening to him. Pass on the gyro. We also tried some rice pudding and baklava which were both OK nothing to rave about."], ["Shanise M.", "Cute little place tucked away in a plaza in Pacific Beach.

This was back in July 2013, so I don't know if that deal still exists.I got the chicken soulvaki and tore through that really quick. Cafe Athena was a good change from the Greek place on UCSD campus (it was good too, but not when it's the only option you have when you're stuck there!).Service was prompt even when the restaurant was fairly busy.

I might say, I'm not one to fill up easily, but I was stuffed with just the entree. Our server was very nice and took time to talk to us, great a couple of regulars, and even fix a wobbly table (we all know how important that is). The food is a bit slow to arrive, and it's definitely out of the price range of a casual family dinner, but that's worth it- pay for what you're getting, right?

Upon my most recent visit there I had the Avo (lemon chicken) soup which I highly recommend. The lemon comes through giving the thick soup an unexpected flavor burst. I ordered a cup of this with the falafel sandwich, which also was delicious and came topped with a pickle and tomatoes, and of course, tzatziki sauce. Next time I'll add a little hot sauce. This dinner plus hot tea only totaled about $12, which I think is a great deal for the portion-size and quality of the food.

He called me the next day and said Athena must be the last restaurant in our neighborhood that has high quality, delicious food - and went on to describe the most fantastic meal, hearing about it made my mouth water. If I were not in Florida, I'd be on my way over there now. His order came to about $19.00 the entree was about $12.00 and the salad was extra - but it was so much food, he could only eat half - and it is so fresh and well-prepared, it can easily be saved for the next day, even the salad!

I sliced the pickle into thin strips and ate some with every bite of hummos and pita. Yum!!We shared the chicken cous cous and it was awesome! It consisted of a large slow-roasted chicken breast on the bone and generous portions of zucchini and carrots over cous cous. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was juicy and flavorful. I'm glad we shared it because the portion was huge!I'll definitely go back to try other items on the menu!"], ["Latha P.", "We have been there twice and it is a gem.

The meat boureka are unusual and outstanding - with a hint of sweetness to make them unusual. The gyros are about the usual, the white sauce. We got to try these on the Grecian Feast, along with a great moussaka. I also really liked the meatballs - lots of flavor and not greasy. The avgolemo was a bit floury but tasty - get it with a side of lemon. The baba ganoush was also quite good."], ["Adrienne V.", "Needed to serve 45 middle and high school students dinner in between performances, so the other parents and I chipped in for dinner from Cafe Atehna.

Still... our waiter didn't acknowledge that it was taking a long time. Anyway, the food arrived. I ordered the falafel sandwich with their potato wedges. \"Excuse me, may I please have some ketchup?\" Waiter: \"we actually don't carry ketchup\" um... what do you mean you don't have ketchup?!

After having the Mediterranean salad two times since my not so great original salad, they've redeemed themselves. The cheese was in abundance (2 oz is their standard), the walnuts were crunchy, the sundried tomatoes we're savory, and the chicken was delicious. Though the second time that i had the salad I checked and the chicken was a bit pink on the inside, I showed the take out lady who threw it back on the stove for a few more minutes, which I really appreciated.

The calamari is very fresh and flavorful and the spanakopita is so stuffed that it almost looks like its going to burst. The spinach pastitsio is another one of our favorite appetizers. I can eat this all day everyday. \u00a0It looks like a spinach dip but it has chunks of red onion and it comes with bread. \u00a0The gyros is one of my favorite Greek dishes and Cafe Athena knows how to do it right. I prefer the gyro sandwich over the entree simply because you get more delicious meat, but if you want a salad on the side then I would recommend the entree.

I was in from out of town and a friend suggested we go here. She did not steer is wrong. The Greek salad was superb die to the amazing creamy feta, out of this world olives, and dressing. Yum!

Menu wise, I was so overwhelmed by the different descriptions of all the food, I went with the Greek Burger. What can i say, I panicked. But what a good choice. The soft ciabatta complimented the tender, crumbly beef patty, and with their fresh onions and red pepper aioli, it made the right blend of sheer perfection in the form of a sandwich. The beef was quite crumbly, like can hardly stay in the bun-crumbly, but nothing a quick scoop from a fork can't fix.

For dessert, I ordered a pear filled crepe, the pears were dipped and cooked with wine then wrapped in crepes, it was so delicious with sprinkled cinnamon and sugar service with vanilla ice cream.

The only problem was the baklava - it was surprisingly hard to cut through. We were impressed by the simple, yet homey interior, and the ambience provided by the Greek music playing really helped relax us. \u00a0Also, what surprised us was the amount of diners that came in later in the evening - whether it was because of Restaurant Week, or because they were regulars, it wasn't apparent, but our seats gave us a good view of what they were ordering.A slight ding on the service; it took a while for our drinks to be refilled, and at one point, our server had my drink in hand, put it down at another table, then five minutes later remembered that I had asked for a refill and got me one immediately afterwards.Otherwise, Cafe Athena does a great job here, and definitely blows Daphne's out of the water due to its authenticity. \u00a0If I'm ever in the PB area, I'll be coming back here."], ["Valerie H.", "Good solid place to visit to fulfill your green craving.

It's ultra creamy, smooth, with fresh garlic that doesn't overpower. Their pita bread is made fresh and is pillowy soft, perfect for dipping into the hummus. I was looking for tzatziki but didn't see it on the menu so I went with their side of tahini. I'm not a huge fan of tahini alone because it can taste bitter, but the tahini at Aladdin is so good! I don't know what they add to it, but it's not bitter and is addicting. I've had the lamb gyro, lamb biryani, Greek salad, and lemon soup. Everything is delicious but the lamb can sometimes be on the fatty side and the lemon soup was a bit too sour for me.

The food is fresh and delicious with huge portions; the location is convenient; the service is great; the restaurant is comfortable; the prices very reasonable. In fact, my whole family declared that this is a \"must go to\" everytime they visit me in San Diego! -convenient location in Claremont Mesa in a strip mall with lots of free lot parking-casual, table service restaurant; large, spacious, comfortable eating areas both indoors and out; nothing too \"fancy\" but very clean-good for large groups, kids and couples; lots of options depending on which area you're sitting in-it wasn't very busy at all when we went, but even on a full night I can see this place being conducive to a quite, relaxed meal-the service was wonderful! we were seated quickly and \u00a0the menu was explained extremely well, all of our questions were answered and quirks addressed without issue (especially regarding food intolerances (one of our guests has a corn allergy and they were very accommodating... that in and of itself deserves top praise), a kid's menu, specific requests, etc)-the waitress was super friendly and helpful, the food came out quickly and she checked on us several times-the food was amazing; the star of the show! -the menu is really varied, there's no limit to the options; the food is clearly described and there are lots of pictures-the portions were huge (the side salad was larger than you'd expect most entree salads to be); we had enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch tomorrow-everything was freshly cooked using great ingredients and seasonings; each item tasted delicious. nothing was overly oily and everything was cooked to perfection. -each entree was a feast of various components, so with three adults ordering there was a massive variety of food which is great when you want to try a bit of everythingChicken Shawerma, $20; Marinated strips of chicken, grilled and served with Basmati rice, Hummus, Garlic Sauce, Lebanese salad and freshly baked pita bread.

This got rave reviews from everyone and could easily be an entree on its own.Baklava ($5.50). The family took this to go and reported back that it \"rocked!\" It is massive and looks great. Very fresh and crispy looking.-The prices were really reasonable, moreso considering the size and most importantly the quality of the ingredients and flavour of the dishes.

I dropped in for a light lunch and ordered the lentil soup, a half order of hummus and pita, and a Chicken Kebab with sandwich on pita bread. The Lentils soup was light but full of great flavor. It was of the extremely blended variety, in that there was no whole lentils in it. But, the soup tasty of lentils, garlic, turmeric, and a variety of other seasonings and herbs. The soup was a great way to start the meal and cost $4.95.The hummus was fantastic as well. Made from fresh ingredients and garnished with excellent extra virgin olive oil, it was hard to go wrong with this. The hummus was served with a pile of sliced warm pita bread which were perfect for eating the hummus. The hummus was quite delicious, and provided a creamy consistency and great flavors of tahini, a bit of lemon juice, garlic, and seasoning for taste. It was quite a treat, and I even used it on my chicken kebab sandwich. The half order cost $5.25.The chicken kebab was very well prepared. Although it did not come with lettuce, the sweet waitress brought me some when she figured out I was bummed it did not have some. The chicken breast marinated in the garlic lemon saffron sauce was great. The chicken properly soaked up the marinade which allowed me to taste it in every bite. The charbroiled chicken was cooked to a tender and juicy temp. The tomatoes were a nice touch with their acidity and the extra garlic was just fun. The chicken kebab cost $8.75.I ate at their small bar and service was active and friendly. It seemed to be the place where the servers congregated, which allowed me to chit chat and be served rather quickly.

Would go there again"], ["Kelli S.", "I've been to Aladdin's once for lunch and ordered take-out from the eatery twice, but whether I dined in-house or have gotten my meals to-go, I've always had a phenomenal experience. Aladdin's is known for their delicious Mediterranean cuisine, and the flavors of each dish I've gotten have been incredible. You definitely get what you pay for and Aladdin doesn't skimp when it comes to ingredients or portion size. This is one of my favorite restaurants and there's so much to choose from on the menu!Even though I've always liked my entr\u00e9e, I try to order something different with each trip to Aladdin. Here's what I would recommend:\"Hummus and Pita\": When I dined in at Aladdin, we got their signature hummus and pita to share. This app features a delicious blend of garbanzo beans, Tahini, fresh garlic, lemon and olive oil. This has to be one of the best hummuses I've ever had. I'm not hard to please when it comes to hummus and pita, but the hummus tasted so fresh and Aladdin doesn't skimp on serving size, either. The pita was also soft, warm and fresh-tasting. Even when we got hummus and pita for our take-out order, it was equally delicious! This app is a must-order during any visit to Aladdin.\"Baba Ghanouj\": I don't think I ordered \"Baba Ghanouj\" on my own before, but my friend ordered this as another appetizer and said it was tasty. This app features a blend of baked eggplant, Tahini, fresh garlic, lemon and parsley, and it's topped with olive oil. Even though I don't really like eggplant, I couldn't taste it much in this dish, and the spread itself was savory and delicious. I heaped tons of it onto my pita, along with the hummus (they actually feature similar ingredients), and I was grateful for the chance to finally taste \"Baba Ghanouj.\"\"Aladdin's Pizza\": I ordered this pizza once and absolutely loved the grandiose variety of spices that came on it. This pizza pie was seasoned with a blend of more than 12 herbs, thyme, sesame seeds, oregano and extra virgin oil. It came topped off with Feta cheese and Roma tomatoes, but I ordered my pizza sans tomatoes. I could definitely taste the Feta in every bite, and I enjoyed the blend of spices that gave this pizza such great flavor. I chose this pizza because it didn't come with lots of tomato sauce.\"Sinbad's BBQ Pizza\": If you love BBQ, this pizza is your match made in heaven. It sports a generous amount of marinated chicken, spicy barbecue sauce, fresh cilantro and red onion. I ordered my pizza without the red onion, but everything else was amazing! The BBQ sauce wasn't too spicy--it had a great sweet-and-smoky flavor--and there were ample chunks of the chicken all over the pizza.\"Genie's Shrimp Pesto\": I haven't ordered this pizza yet, but it's at the top of my to-try list because it includes fresh basil pesto sauce. This pizza features marinated shrimp, Roma and sun-dried tomatoes and red onions. I wouldn't get the red onions or tomatoes, but I'm sure the shrimp-and-pesto combo provides enough flavor for me. If I do end up ordering this pizza, maybe I'll see if I can swap the tomatoes and onion for cheese or a different topping.\"Chicken Shawerma Sandwich\": I ordered this sandwich on my first visit to Aladdin. There are several different types of chicken sandwiches available; this one comes with marinated chicken strips that are charbroiled on an open fire, garlic sauce and tomatoes rolled in fresh pita bread. I ordered my sandwich sans tomatoes. While I enjoyed the moist, tender chicken strips and topped with pita sandwich with more hummus, I think the best part of the entr\u00e9e was the side of curly fries. Oh. My. Word. These curly fries were seasoned to perfection and sported a great, crispy exterior. Highly addictive and one of my favorite fries to date!\"Vegetarian Borak\" (Spinach Pies): This spinach pie is definitely something I'd like to try in the future, since it features my favorite vegetable. The \"Borak\" includes a seasoned mixture of spinach, onions, tomatoes, sumac and lemon Juice stuffed in special dough and baked in a stone oven. If there's a way to not get tomatoes and onions in my spinach pie, I would opt for that. But this entr\u00e9e almost sounds like a quiche, and if the dough is as fresh and light as the pita bread, I'm sure I'll like this dish.\"Cheese Borak\": This pie is similar to the \"Vegetarian\" version, except for the fact that it includes a blend of Feta and Halumi cheese with fresh mint. As a cheese connoisseur, I'm sure I'd love this cheesier version of the Borak ... and, come to think of it, I'm not sure if I've ever had Halumi, so it'll be a first-time experience for me."], ["Zak M.", "Great food joint.

Indeed, it was!The salad that came along with was delicious, a lot of sumac on it delivered the zest needed to make it super fresh. I love to see the chefs at the open kitchen making all these deliciousness in front of you but not in your face. Hummus appetizer was so-so, too bland as others have pointed out. I guess after trying the spicy hummus from Luna Grill this nothing can compare, sorry! Service and atmosphere very good.

Sadly, what I think is the major downfall of this place is the lack of a lunch menu! I went for a sandwich because with a side salad in the $8-$9 range it was the best deal. The entrees were all priced at $20+ which is just too steep for a quick lunch out. I had the chicken sandwich (nice how they note which options are healthy, vegetarian, and vegan). The sauce was super tasty and the side salad was pretty good (if a bit tart and vinegary). My friend had the falafel and thought it was very satisfying but wasn't as big of a fan of the taboleh salad which was more heavy on herbs than other components.

The Koefta is delicious, especially with the garlic sauce; my husband loves the Schawarmas, and my son, the pizzas. \u00a0They serve a good Lebanese salad with the entrees, but I always have them upgrade it to a Greek salad, since it's so wonderful! \u00a0The combo platters are a great way to try everything. \u00a0Good for vegetarians - many selections. \u00a0I've been coming here for years, and that will continue!"], ["Jenna P.", "First middle Eastern place I've tried and I am not disappointed.

However, the food was a major let down. The Middle Eastern Platter, especially the dolmehs, was the best dish we got. We also had the Ghalieh Mahi, which is a special salmon dish on the weekends, and Loubiah polo with chicken kabob. The rice in Loubiah polo didn't taste too fresh and felt like it was more of a side dish instead of the star of the show and the chicken was pretty dry.

She had planned on taking half to go, but failed in her mission when she found an empty plate in front of her. I like the wide-range of vegetarian options and the fact that everything on the menu is an adventure, even if you've had it at a million other places. I also have gotten the feeling through sweet chats with the owner, that she is always ready to try new things, to improve recipes, add new items, and take her place to the next level.  \u00a0 The decor is peerless, every accent piece, or colored plank of wood, every light bulb seems artfully and spiritfully placed.

Chicken or Tofu $11.95 Lamb Shank $14.95I think the Baghali Polo was mediocre, lamb was a little bland. Dilled Basmati rice was pretty standard. The Zereshk Polo was delicious, I don't know for other Persians but it was good for my taste buds. The berries, almonds, and the sweet carrots almost remind me of my favorite cranberry almond salad!

The ground meat was seasoned perfectly with the Persian spices. The rice was delicious & slightly sweet with berries & almonds. My mother really enjoyed her salmon meal. I had a taste of it & it was really flavorful & it was cooked just right. They served her the hot tea on a cute little platter. Ross brought us complimentary Persian baklava for her birthday.

Let me start first with telling you that if you want authentic Persian food, this is not the one. 1.Zereshk polo did not have any barbarries and had cherries instead. 2.Rice was way overcooked, it had tons of carrots, that tasted too sweet, almonds and orange peel, that was overpowering everything. Salad had only potatoes in it with carrots and a few pieces of chicken on a side!!

I would come back, but probably try one of their vegan/vegetarian offerings next time. Oh, also the Persian baklava was tasty but very small.

Whether your tastes are light and vegetarian or spicy chicken or fish, there is something on the wide ranging menu that will tickle your fancy. I love the Zereshk Polo - sweet, spicy, just a ton of interesting flavors. We've had many of the chicken, salmon, and tilapia creations and always have been happy. The appetizers and sides are terrific - and the curry sauce that comes with many of the sides is off the chart! The wine list is thoughtful and well curated - lots of surprises at very good price points. Other interesting cocktails are also available - it's a limited bar, but fun. I've read some of the more negative reviews here and have to wonder if maybe expectations weren't set quite right?

I went on a Thursday for dinner and it wasn't crowded at all when we sat down, but it filled in as it got later. The decor is adorable and I found the space relaxing overall.I started with a pomegranate soup, which I really enjoyed and think it might be their staple. If you like somewhat sour flavors, which I do, then definitely try the soup. It comes out with pita bread. The main dish I got was a curry dish with tofu because it was the Thursday special - love that they have daily affordable specials. The portion size was perfect and I thought the rice was perfectly cooked so I'm surprised by the reviews that say otherwise. I also really enjoyed the flavor of the curry, though I wish the tofu pieces were cut slightly larger. I appreciate that they only serve locally made non-gmo tofu. I tried some of the lamb shank that my dad got and thought it was ok, but I'm not a fan of stewed meats because of the texture so I'm not the best judge of that. He liked that it was soft and fell right off of the bone. Definitely don't leave without getting dessert. We shared the Persian Ice Cream, which is saffron and rose flavored and had a yummy pomegranate sauce topped with whipped cream and pistachios. It was so flavorful and not like anything that I had before.Overall I recommend going if you want some Mediterranean cuisine - good price, friendly service, and tasty food. A perk is they serve cucumber water, just a nice touch because I hate when you go out for a nice dinner and you are served bad tasting tap water."], ["Deepak V.", "Cute restaurant, friendly owners, had a great time this evening.

We came back and they sat a newly arrived couple at the same time as us, but they went to help them right away while leaving us unattended for about 10 minutes. They came over and we told the waitress we had the groupon, and even though the groupon had no limitations on it she said we could only get he house wine and no high-end appetizer, so when I calculated the maximum anyone could spend on their meal with those limitations there was no way it could be close to $69.95. They clearly advertised a value on Groupon that the meal could never reach.Ok so let's get what they allow us to order. We got the Malbec house wine, it was very good but took 10 minutes to get to us. Then the Potato Pancakes, which had good flavor but were almost cold.

We had the Lamb Zereschk Polo and the Chicken Lentil Squash dish, both good with tender meat and ample portions. My problem with this place was not the food, the enjoyed the food quite a bit.

The hostess/waitress was nice but that's probably where the pros end. We started with the hummus and when it came out it was slapped messily on a plate along with a salad. It tasted store-bought and I'm not sure why the hummus wasn't on its own plate. After ordering our main meals it took at least 40 minutes for the food to come out. What made this even worse was the fact that the food was not good. The chicken kabob was dry, bland and there was no way it was fresh. The rice, which every Persian restaurant should be able to cook perfectly, was cold and instead of being yellow, the saffron rice on top was orange, a clear indication that they use something other than saffron to cook their yellow rice.

Most other Park Avenue establishments are pretty overrated in my opinion, but Sanam and her crew offer ambiance and great service to every one who walks through their front door. \u00a0From the appetizers (love the hummus!) to the salads and main entrees, there is something for everyone on the menu and it is all cooked fresh straight from Sanam's family recipes. My husband and I never stray from our usual selections - the curry chicken is off the hook - and every time, it is delicious. The Pomegranite iced tea is another favorite of mine. Parking can be a challenge on Park, especially after 6PM, but it is worth doing a few laps around the block to get inside and grab some of this tasty fare!"], ["Rashid K.", "Persian food is my jam. \u00a0I am Persian, and my (american) wife has become a great Persian cook over the years. \u00a0We can both appreciate some good Persian food. There are a couple of Persian restaurants around town that we are very fond of. \u00a0Since we live close by SB, my wife had asked to check this place out. However, I had told her that I had gone a couple of times years ago and was not impressed. Finally, I was tired on a Friday night and craving Persian food, so I found myself fuzzy enough on my memory of this place to say \"Let's give Soltan Banoo another shot tonight\". We ordered one Gormeh Sabzee and one Asheh Anar to go, which we both split. When we went in to pick it up, my memory came back about how I found the place loud and chaotic feeling. And in retrospect, it should have been a red flag that there were no Persian people dining. Nevertheless, the lady helping us was nice enough. We get home and start our meal. My wife starts on the soup... A couple bites and she simply says \"This isn't very good\". \u00a0A phrase that has never come out of her mouth in reference to Persian food. I start in on the stew. Two bites and I start to feel the heat of the gormeh sabzee. I have acid reflux issues and therefore cannot eat spicy food, so my meal stopped right there as far as the stew goes. Persian food is typically not spicy at all, and I have actually never tasted spicy Persian food before. I understand that this place has some interpretation of its own when it comes to Persian food and I can accept that, however I think it is inappropriate to make a traditionally non-spicy dish spicy and have zero indication of it in the menu. \u00a0Didn't taste that good anyways, regardless of the spice. \u00a0My wife stated while eating it \"It's fine. \u00a0But definitely my least favorite Ghormeh Sabzee I've ever had\". \u00a0The soup did not have much flavor, and the chickpeas and red beans were dry and on the hard side. \u00a0Neither of us finished either dish. \u00a0And perhaps most offensive of all was the rice. Good Persian rice is something to be proud of and something we both love when we go to our favorite Persian spots or make at home. \u00a0Soltan Banoo's rice was small, shriveled and tasted like minute rice.I hate to knock a Persian place, but for me this place was so subpar on so many levels on three visits spaced out over about eight years that I really have nothing positive to say about it. Finally learned my lesson for good and will definitely never return, despite the proximity to our home. \u00a0A drive downtown or to Clairemont is well worth it."], ["Jo F.", "There was one table of guests seated and yet we stood waiting to be seated for 5 minutes - we actually walked into the restaurant to be seen.

I'm so happy to report that I've found a new favorite in the 'hood that is making me a very happy boy. Soltan Banoo has absolutely won my heart.Admittedly, I've walked by Soltan Banoo oodles of times and have never really been intrigued enough to go inside. Two weeks ago, for whatever reason, my dining companion and I were desiring more ethnic options and decided to finally pop in. The interior dining room is very warm and homey. The space is flavored by a number of Middle Eastern paintings, shelves sporting Persian chachkies, and several other non-essential furniture items. Honestly, I think they could remove some of it because it's a little too busy for my taste. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is pleasant and cute. I decided to start with the Pomegranate vodka cocktail ($6). It's a refreshing drink that employs an Asian vodka (I'm not sure of the exact name). It doesn't pack too much of a punch, but it's refreshing, nevertheless. \u00a0For appetizers, we selected the Koo-koo (potato pancakes $5.95) and Baba Ghanoush ($6.95). I adored the potato pancakes; they were unique in that the batter was accented by quinoa and dill. So comforting! The baba ghanoush was also quite good, embodying a rich smokey flavor that always is pleasurable to consume with accompanying pita bread. Moving on, I selected for my entree the Loubiah Polo ($10.95). This is a rich chicken basmati rice dish cooked with chopped green beans, tomatoes, Persian spices, and spicy curry. Eating this reminded me of my mom's classic chicken and rice dish that I used to love as a child, only this was much more spicy. It's one of those types of meals that is the perfect medicine to nurse your mood after a really bad day. Rib-sticking good. Love at first bite.The following weekend I returned and had the Saturday special, the Abgousht (Persian Stew). This dish is a stew of lamb, chickpeas, potatoes, beans, tomatoes and dried limes for flavor, served with pita bread, all for $12.95. The lamb was succulent and cooked to perfection. The stew had a little heat on the back-end of each bite. Love. Apparently, the proprietor is from Iran and all of the meals are her personal recipes. It's easy to confirm that after the first couple of bites. The service is swift. All of our servers have been so pleasant, welcoming and informative. I just love Soltan Banoo--it truly warms the cockles of my heart. And to think that I've only commenced my journey with their expansive menu!

(This is in part due to it being an early lunch and the festivities of SD Pride were happening that day.) The woman who owns the place (presumably) is extremely nice; she gave us a lot of helpful advice for ordering, and she did it with so much enthusiasm and genuine care. She was also very pleasant to talk to. We ordered a lot of different items to share, and enjoyed them all thoroughly. All of our food was delicious, filling, and left us feeling quite gratified. Oh, and to the people who complain about the food here costing too much or taking too long to come out: Hush. Because its made after you order it.

The place is on the small side and half of their dining area is actually a patio. We went on a chilly day and sat in the covered patio. It was a bit chilly even though it was covered, so I would suggest sitting inside or wait for a warmer day to sit in the patio.Food...Rooibos Latte: This was a deliciously tea latte...kinda in between a spiced chai latte and a asian milk tea. A definite yes.Baba Ghanoush: Probably one of the smoothest I've had...it was like they put butter and cream in there...delish!We went on a Saturday so we got both of the daily specials...we wanted something other than the typical kabobs.Abgousht: This was a Persian lamb stew that was salty and sour. I thought it was a little too much on the sour side...I thought the dried limes that were in the stew were pieces of lamb several times and boy was my mind fooled...was not a good taste surprise at that... This dish was okay if you take out the limes.Koufteh: These were big balls of meat and rice...like giant meat balls...in a plate of sauce. It was the better of the two dishes but nothing spectacular.Dessert was a house-made ice cream with wafers...I believe it was pistachio? The ice cream was great. Not too sweet and just the right creaminess. Topped with a tart pomegranate? syrup/reduction. The wafers that the ice cream was smacked within, however, were not all that great. I could have done without the stale/soggy wafers. I am guessing the wafers were assembled with the ice cream and were just kept until serving?...which probably gave it the staleness.

Rice and vegetables were cooked well and provided a really clean flavor to the plate. I loved the yogurt with curry and fig sauce that was given with our meal. It went perfectly with the fish.

To finish it off, we had the home made dessert \"palace\".All the food had incredible, distinct flavor + tasted fresh. The dough on the pies had great taste, even though, it was a bit high in carbohydrates, it was light and easy to eat, not too thick or thin, great texture. The fatoush dressing was excellent, it is some type of citrus with some olive oil and other spices/herbs. One serving was plenty for the two of us to share since we ordered so much food.The pies were all very very good, we were happy with the 3 choices we made. All three had their distinct flavor, the zataar (vegeterian) was exotic with a blend of different herbs. The chicken tawook was incredible with the special garlic spread on it, and the kafta bajeen comes with with some beef kabob meat, the seasoning on the meat was amazing and so fresh tasting. Food was not greasy, a big plus.The spinach pie is the only thing we would not probably order again though, it was a little bit too sour for us. I think it would have been great with some cheese (feta) in it, and definitely not too sour.The \"palace\" desert was some type of sweet cream and pistachio on top, with some rose water around, takes a litlle bit of an acquired taste, but we quickly enjoyed it.Customer Service, especially from the owners, was very personal.

Both were pretty much perfect. The beef shawerma is better than most I've tried because the meat was juicy, not overcooked, and the tahini was a perfect addition.Whenever we go to Middle Eastern restaurants, we order garlic sauce. This was hands down, the absolute best, most authentic, creamy, fluffy, amazing garlic sauce you will ever have IN YOUR LIFE. I would come here just for that, even if everything else was bad...which is isn't. I won't come here without ordering some for my meal, and probably some for the road as well. The chicken tawook is as good as every review says it is, and just like the beef shawarma, the chicken is moist and tender. It is topped with jalapenos and the garlic sauce, which add amazing depth.The kibbie is similar to kofta (ground meat) but instead of cooking it on the grill, this is the over baked version, and it's fantastic. It's perfectly spiced, and the pine nuts mixed in add another nice touch.I love the house-made hot tea, which seems to be a blend of black tea accented with rose water (though the owner won't let you in on the secret). Better try it for yourself! It also includes refills, which is a huge win for me. It is the perfect compliment to your meal.Finally, the service is so kind and welcoming. It's no wonder people love it here and keep coming back.

Spinach flatbread 2. Hummus3. Tabouli4. Baba Ganoush5. Pickles6. Fatoush SaladThe flatbread was flavorless. \u00a0There was a generous amount of spinach on the bread but the bread itself was boring. \u00a0The Hummus, Tabouli and Baba Ganoush were fine but not memorable. \u00a0The hummus and baba were very creamy so probably had a lot of tahini in them. \u00a0I would have liked more lemon in them to cut through the tahini.Several people gave the pickles a good review. \u00a0The pickles consisted of carrot coins and pickled radish and the portion was very small. \u00a0 Boring and not worth the money.The fattoush salad was a total miss. \u00a0Just a bunch of lettuce with chopped up veggies like peppers, tomato and cucumber. \u00a0The dressing had no taste. \u00a0It was so unappealing I took one small bite and left the rest.Everybody also raved about the service but this also sucked. \u00a0A woman greeted us as we walked in the door by saying \"Welcome back\". \u00a0I had never been to this restaurant before so this should have been my first clue.The waitress made no suggestions about the food and seemed unenthusiastic. \u00a0When she noticed that the fattoush salad was not eaten she asked if I did not like it. \u00a0I told her that I did not care for it and that it did not resemble any fattoush salad I have eaten anywhere else. \u00a0She still included it on the bill.As we left, the same woman who greeted us gave us 2 thumbs up, even though she did not bother to ask if we enjoyed out meal.All in all it was a very strange experience. \u00a0The food was expensive and not very good. \u00a0I will not be going back. \u00a0I will be heading straight to Mamas for my lebanese food fix."], ["hans h.", "Awesome people, awesome food. \u00a0Must try the house desert, and the cheese flatbread. \u00a0The beans dish reminds me of my mom's cooking...lemon, garlic, olive oil, and a bit of spice :)"], ["Yasmin C.", "Omg! Why have I never reviewed Alforon?? I love this place! We sadly discovered this only several months prior to moving to Houston last year, but stopped in a few weeks ago during a whirlwind weekend vacay for a wedding in good old San D. I was happy to see that the space had expanded! Which means we were seated easily for lunch right away on a Saturday. I'll run the risk of sounding like a broken record on this page to say that the chicken tawook flatbread is my favorite thing...in fact, I broke my vegetarianism (which is a development of recent months) for it and it was completely worth it. As others have said, the addition of cheese and jalapenos is a must. We also ordered the fresh veggies for some color and variation, and got an order of that perfect crispy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside falafel, and it was a perfect lunch.Other items I've had before are the dolmas, vegetarian flatbread, feta cheese pie, and of course the rosewater pistachio dessert. It all really is amazing...though I honestly can't go without getting the chicken tawook. The waitstaff and owners are friendly and personable as well, making for a pleasant and delish experience.This is one of those places we will ALWAYS return to when we're in town.

No offense to the owners who seemed to be very welcoming yet in your face at the same time. Coming from a person of middle eastern descent, I can tell you that none of the items I tried seemed to be authentic or even good. The hummus was a watery consistency, lacking salt, tahini, and lemon. The cheese pie tasted like the cheese was previously frozen. And the Shawarma pie was so soggy and lacking any flavor I couldn't bear to eat it.I can see this place as having a lot of potential, but their food was severely disappointing. The waitress, possibly also the owners daughter, seemed like she just did not want to be there with her obnoxious mother yelling at her from every corner of the room. I was staring her down for 15 mins after we finished our meal, waiting for her to bring us the check so we could leave. I finally gave up and just went to the front desk, paid them their money, and left."], ["Sami A.", "A very nice and family managed restaurant. Their manakeesh (flat breads) remind me of the bets manakeesh I had in the Middle East. Very friendly family and the owner's wife came several times to our table to check on us. She noticed that our 3 year old daughter was not eating much, and when we told her she likes vegetables, she brought a plate of boiled vegetable for free. That was very nice! Their tabbouli is actually a tabbouli, not just a mix of parsley and tomatoes which is what you probably eat in other middle eastern restaurants. This place is fabulous and I will certainly visit again next time I am in San Diego."], ["Teagan A.", "Everything was amazing.

The night started off well because I got a parking spot right in front of the store! A word of caution: There are plenty of light poles in the front lot so careful when you're backing out or pulling into a spot. My gf and I came an hour before they closed so the place wasn't packed at all. They immediately seated us or better yet, let us choose wherever we wanted to sit. The food menu wasn't TOO foreign to me since they had flatbreads, falafels, and hummus dishes. I would say this place is more regional, specifically Mediteranean, than Lebanese specific. We ordered the Chicken Tawook flatbread ($7.25), Feta Cheese Pie ($4.50), \u00a0and half dozen falafels with tahini sauce ($5.95). They served the ice water very quickly (with straws without us asking :D ) so the service was impeccable so far. We didn't have to wait long for the food to come out. Up first was the Chicken Tawook, which I have to say was the best dish of the night. It was topped with tender marinated chicken, garlic paste spread, cheese, pickles, and soft flatbread. I liked how they give you a dollip of cheese (which I think is kefir cheese) on each slice so you can spread the cheese throughout the flatbread however you like. The chicken was shredded and very tender. The flatbread didn't have a crunchy texture, which is what I prefer since I hate it when flatbreads break after one bite. This was followed by the feta cheese pie, which was more like a baked roll than a pie. They baked a flatbread and stuffed it with feta cheese with their special mix. This was a so-so dish. You had to cut it into sections to eat it. It was a bit dry so I would dip it in a sauce if I could. The last item was the half dozen falafels with tahini sauce. This wasn't the best dish of the night, even with its self proclaimed moniker \"world famous falafel\". The falafel balls were very dry, which is most likely why they added tahini sauce. It was like a creamy lemon zest sauce. The falafels had to be dipped in the sauce or it would dry out your mouth from being so fried, it's dry.Overall, it was a pleasant introduction into the lebanese mediteranean world of food. I was go again to try the other selection of flatbreads they have, especially the shawarma!"], ["Bernard S.", "The best Lebanese food, ambiance , music , and best welcoming restaurant in San Diego! I can't stop coming back over and over !!!!"], ["Emily P.", "Literally words cannot describe how insanely good the food is. I don't even know where to start....When we walked in we were sarcastically told to leave by the very outgoing and excitable owner (at least thats who I thin she was). She then sat at our table with us and explained the entire menu at a speed that I thought only auctioneers could speak at. She encouraged us to share all of our dishes, but we were stubborn and ordered separately. After looking at the Yelp suggestions, I got the Chicken Tawook. Holy shit... It was amazing. You have not lived until you have tried Alforon's Chicken Tawook. The added cheese is worth the few extra cents. And there was some mysterious vegetable on top of the cheese that tasted rather garlicy and delicious. My friends ordered falafel and Soujouk which was also very good but did not compare to the Chicken Tawook. When we finished eating we did wait around for a rather long time. A waitress took my friend's baklava order and then insisted that we split their house dessert. \u00a0She explained it was a custard type thing in rose water... yeah, sounds gross. She said she'd pay for it if we didn't like it, so we really had nothing to loose. Seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had. The rose water tasted like the nectar of the gods and the cake itself was heavenly in texture and taste. I rarely walk out of a restaurant planning my next trip to the restaurant, but in this case it was completely necessary. Also, I can say without a doubt that I have never tasted food and had to reevaluate my life... but it happened twice in this one meal. If I'm ever on death row (which is a slim possibility) I am sure that my last meal will be from Alforon."], ["Janet L.", "I've tried the zaatar and the chicken tawook flatbreads, which were both delicious. I think the thing that makes this place stand out is the friendliness of the owners. We declined ordering dessert because we were already full, but they brought us a plate of aaysh essaraya anyways, which was just incredibly tasty. We even were brought to the back to take a look at the huge oven they use to cook their flatbreads.

The wrap was a good size portion and smelled heavenly. The bread was so fresh and warm, the FALAFEL was outstanding - moist and flavorful on the inside and just slightly crunchy on the outside.

Props for the aggressively friendly hospitality ^.^We ended up getting chicken tawook, the soujouk, the hummus and some falafel, all of which were fantastic. The labneh (cheese with a butter-like texture) on the tawook was incredible, the spices on the soujouk (ground beef) were so savory. The flatbread for both was very soft.

I'm not very familiar with Mediterranean/Lebanese food, and so it would be easy to confuse and intimidate me with a very authentic menu. But their menu is concise, easy to pick from and there's a lot of familiar stuff on it. The hummus was outstanding. Love it. I've tried a couple things on there that I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly the salad type stuff, and their veggies are always vinegary which I liked in some places but not in all, but that's personal preference. Their flatbreads are amazing. Try the chicken tawook. So good. The only complaint I have of this place is their service. They're nice and all but both times I went there I ended up thirsty with an empty glass that wasn't being refilled, and the server seemed to be hiding out back for the entire time we were eating. This happened with water as well as a drink I paid for. That was kind of annoying."], ["Dmitriy S.", "So much hype surrounding Alforon that I had to give it a try. I grew up eating a lot of Mediterranean food, but this isn't like your average restaurant. No kabobs or rice dishes. A simple menu highlighting the best of Lebanese food. I couldn't understand why simple flat breads could be so hyped up, but I was blown away.- Falafel (Half Dozen, $7.25): Served with Tahini and pickles. Wonderfully prepared. Crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. As common as falafel its, many tend to mess it up and lose touch with the proper consistency. Alforon got it spot on.- Chicken Tawook ($6.95): Chicken, garlic paste, pickles on a flat bread. This is their signature dish and now I understand why. The flat bread is smothered in tender chunks of of perfectly marinated chicken. The garlic paste is not too heavy and adds a perfect touch to it. Sprinkle on some cheese for an extra $0.95 and you won't regret it. Every bite of this is mindblowing.- LahmBajeen ($3.70): Ground beef, tomato, onion, and spices on thin flat bread. I'm used to this being called lahmacun in Turkish, or Turkish pizza by Americans who refuse to even try and pronounce it. The one here is fantastic, with plenty of beef chunks and all flavors working in harmony. A close competitor to the chicken tawook.- Aaysh Essaraya ($3.95): Pistachio-encrusted phyllo on top of a yogurt based pudding drizzled in rose syrup. Even if you don't have room for dessert, you MUST get this. Even if you like sweets, you must get this. It will change your outlook on life. The delicate, sweet, crisp flavor of the rose syrup mixed in with the yogurt and pistachio is an out of this world experience. It just may bring about world peace if spread to every nation. Enough said.In addition to the great food, the atmosphere is incredibly welcoming. Upon leaving, the jolly owner had a great chat with us and made our night unforgettable. Worth all the hype and the Top 100 Yelp! restaurants ranking."], ["Mady H.", "I like this restaurant, the design and the arabic atmosphere.

For me, the falafel wrap was the highlight; it was, simply, the best Mediterranean wrap I've had in San Diego with excellent seasoning and the wrap itself having the desired flexible firmness from toasting. My only regret was that it didn't include shawarma. Separately, the shawarma flat bread couldn't quite capture the same magic perhaps due to a greater focus on the bread and the lack of vegetables with which to make the flavor more intricate.One further plus: the extremely friendly owner lady who apparently thought I might be Lebanese no doubt due to my tall, dark, and handsome nature.Summary: It's Alforon, and it's all for love."], ["B.

To compound the issue, I've discovered \"The Kebab Shop\" nearby (yelp.com/biz/the-kebab-s\u2026), which, plain and simple, offers better kebabs. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?The service and atmosphere are one two things (along with the price), that are unchanged from my initial review. First and foremost, kudos to Doner Mediterranean Grill for having hours that can cater to the late night crowd. I mean, you can only stomach (literally) waiting in line for a crappy piece of pizza so many weekends in a row no? While DMG can get crowded, the service is generally snappy, and the servers are responsive to special requests. No complaints here. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Yes, the doner wraps in particular are still just a few coins shy of $10, but I should emphasize here that these are absolutely massive: larger than any I can remember having in the past. The doner wraps are easily two meals packaged into one, and during one of my more recent visits my kebab was easily the size of two Chipotle burritos. Something can be expensive but still be packed full of value, and that's very much the case here. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I don't know what's gone wrong over the course of the past year, but the quality of the kebabs here at Doner Mediterranean Grill have suffered tremendously. My first visit back I got a chicken doner wrap because they were out of beef. No problem, but when I took a bite? Problem. The meat was painfully dry, the chili and yogurt sauces barely sprinkled on, and the onions disgustingly overpowering to the detriment of the entire wrap. I didn't even finish it. My second visit back I went for a mixed wrap with both chicken and lamb meat, hoping that my previous experience was a fluke. It wasn't. While I opted to skip the onions, the meats were still painfully dry and flavorless, and the sauces were once again barely spread inside the wrap. I finished slightly less than half before giving up and chucking my nearly $10 doner wrap. During my first visit, the meats were succulent, the sauces liberally applied, and the dressings complimentary instead of detrimental. How I long for those days. No Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?The Kebab Shop mentioned previously isn't open as late, but they dish up a superior product that's worth waiting for. I have no doubt I'll be back to reevaluate DMG, but in the meantime I can't recommend it.

Unfortunately the rest of downtown San Diego also wanted lamb/beef, so they were out.

Not meaning to say anything negatively of him, he probably just thought I was an idiot by my inability to pick up on his jokes. The wait was relatively long, but worth it. The falafel was perfectly seasoned, and not greasy at all. I wasn't really paying attention to the other insides of the wrap, but I think there was squash, onions, and some other veggies. Initially I thought Doner and the Kebab Shop would be relatively indistinguishable, but such was not the case. Everything was so fresh and seemed (?) healthy.

The cashier offered to bring my food to the table because it was going to take a little longer, but I don't think they normally do that. You can sit inside in the cute dining area, and there are a few tables outside for when the weather's nice (so that's all the time, right?)I ordered a falafel plate. It came with about six falafel balls, a salad, a healthy amount of pita bread, and the most delicious tzatziki sauce. The falafel balls were fried up fresh. Because of that, they were warm, and the outside was still a little crispy. Now, I do not normally order falafel because they are often super dry, and I have to drown them in something. And what's the point of a falafel if you can't even taste it? These falafel balls however were actually doughy on the inside. Some would say, maybe even a little undercooked. However, it was perhaps the most delicious falafel I've ever had BECAUSE it a little undercooked. I could actually enjoy the falafel WITHOUT the sauce for once! But I used the sauce, because, I'm not crazy.The tzatziki sauce is made with fresh greek yogurt. delish. My fiance had a half chicken/half beef wrap. One half had their spicy sundried tomato sauce and the other half had the tzatziki sauce. The wrap was huge, and could easily feed two people. My future hubby eats like a horse, so- not an option.

The chicken was dripping with shiny juices, while the beef was also roasting away.Being our first time, the person making our wraps was incredibly friendly to us. She was really welcoming and told us all of our options. Unlike other places where you can get a wrap, all the options are FREE. This means free yogurt sauce, free hummus, and free spicy sauce. She toasted the wraps first, then piled on a huge spoonful of both yogurt and hummus and spread it nice and evenly. Then she put on these mixed veggies that included some fried potato wedges. Next came some lettuce and then the meat.We also ordered fries and used a check in deal to get a fountain drink. The fries were incredibly light and crispy having just been out of the frier. She did put some seasoning on the fries that was not too salty with ketchup being the perfect compliment to them. What really surprised us was the deep smooth, creamy, and awesome flavor of the wraps. The beef was a little better than the chicken, because the chicken was a bit dry, but when you ate the wraps you were met with an explosion of hummus and yogurt. Every bite was full of good stuff.

First of all, and there is some much I want to say about this place, the pita was surprisingly moist for being made from wheat, and the beef was very well seasoned and incredibly tender and very flavorful. During its cooking process on the spit, they apply a cap of lamb fat on top that slowly drips into the beef (yelp.com/biz_photos/d\u00f6ne\u2026). Clever indeed.The pita wrap was very well filled with beef that had a nice seer on the outside that helped keep that natural juice of the beef inside (yelp.com/biz_photos/d\u00f6ne\u2026). I loved that they not only piled on the meat, but the grilled peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, and onions, but most of all, that amazing dill feta cheese (yelp.com/biz_photos/d\u00f6ne\u2026). The tzatziki sauce was excellent and so was the spicy roasted tomato sauce. The both made the pita sammie that much better. The fries were very well prepared with their great color, crisp exterior, and tasty soft center.

The people working here were friendly and happy. Yum!"], ["McKenzie R.", "Really disappointed with this place this time around. The last time I was here there were two young ladies behind the counter, who I assumed to be the owners given their Eastern accents. They were funny, extremely helpful, and very professional when dealing with our group. The food was so good, hot crispy fries with a beautiful and delicious gyro. The thin seasoned onions and the meat with yogurt sauce were my favorite parts of the gyro. You could tell the ladies behind the counter cared a lot about the establishment and their work.This visit, the opposite. The staff was very unprofessional. Multiple staff members were texting (one was the cashier!) and were talking and messing around the entire time I was there (ordering and eating). I hoped the food was still as good as I remembered, but that was a disappointment too. The fries were cold and soggy and the pita sandwiches were sloppily assembled with hardly any yogurt sauce to be found. It was very apparent that the staff was only there to get a paycheck. I took my parents here after raving about this place and they were so unimpressed that they questioned my judgement. The only reason I give this place two stars is that I had a five star experience last time and I still enjoyed the sandwich, just not as much as last time. The staff ruined the experience for myself and my family, they need to be fired! Not sure if I will return again."], ["Angela D.", "First time at the one downtown, my friends & I were just hungry.

I got their chicken wrap made extra spicy. The restaurant is pretty small, but their food is really good. They're open till 4am.

What is atrocious, however is the mayo filled \"yogurt\" sauce they add to it and serve with their falafel.

I usually get the chicken wrap when I go here.The service on the other hand is really a hit or miss. There is a young girl who works there that provides really great service and makes my wraps the best. The men who work there on the other hand are the worst. They have some unsanitary practices. They use no gloves when preparing the food and there was one time I saw them prepare food right after handling money - still no gloves. Also, the men here seem to hate their job...going through the motions and caring less about providing proper customer service. And regardless who is working - the service is SLOW. Expect a 10 - 15 minute wait for your food. And if your ordering more than one sandwich, give it a half hour. With that said, I still find myself coming back to this place for its delicious food."], ["Alyssa T.", "Doner is a VERY CASUAL, EAT-N-GO kinda place in the Gaslamp Quarters.

No joke."], ["Jack M.", "Got the Yelp-acclaimed chicken wrap with grilled veggies, tzatziki, and hot sauce. Super awesome. This chicken is schawarma style. It was nicely marinated and the vegetables and the hot sauce nicely balanced out the meat on a fat/acid ratio. The tzatziki had the perfect amount of garlic, mint and dill that they mix fresh at the restaurant. Can't really remeber the wrap so it was probably good but not amazing. Which is fine because it let the fresh ingredients play joyfully on my palate. The service was really helpful and friendly. Definitely go here."], ["Katherine G.", "We had the Chicken Plate and it was enough for my daughter and I. My son had the Falafel plate and enjoyed it.

A wonderful young corpsman at the hospital recommended this place to us. Parking, even on a Sunday night was a bit cumbersome, but we managed to snag an illegal spot without receiving a ticket ;)The meats were on those verticals rotisserie things that are constantly basted. The girl working the counter and getting our food was friendly. I was a bit confused by the menu; the items lacked description. However ... the girl was just amazing at explaining each item and even suggesting all the ways my dad could experience both meats in one meal. She allowed us to sample the berry lemonade (YUM!) and the yogurt drink (Ick). But the food!!! Oh my gosh. The chicken was freshly shaved off the rotisserie and the beef was sliced off. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. The beef was a bit on the dry side, but flavored perfectly. The bulgar wheat, which I had never had before, was moist and just amazing. I would have assumed I was eating rice if I hadn't known. The yogurt sauce knocked my socks off. I really loved the fresh cut seasoned fries. I didn't even need ketchup. The veggies and salad were fresh and crisp. The dressing for the salad was interesting- in a good way. It was lemony and had a flavor I couldn't identify- I want to say cinnamon? Or cardamom? I don't know, but it was super yum. The prices were WONDERFUL. My platter was only $7.95. We've made plans to return tomorrow for lunch. You must visit this place!!

They also gave us a side of garlic butter that was added to every bite. My youngest 7 yr old son had a cheeseburger burger and fries, which was pretty big and he ate the whole thing (not typical for him) my husband had the Chicken Shawarma plate and loved it, well he does prefer the dark thigh/leg type meat vs the white; but loved it none the less. Good size portion too. The only sad thing is that I live far from this place. This is a great alternative to the typical chinese or taco shop take out. It wasn't cheap but not expensive either. We pretty much got 3 full meals for $28.This is a great place, till next time!"], ["David K.", "I come here a lot now. A whole bunch - not as much as Mel the Duchess - but I do come in second. I absolutely love the Kafta plate. I try to stick with the beef plates. I recently saw that they made the Yelp top 100 restaurants --- and they are the top rated Lebanese restaurant in the area. Which is quite amazing considering how well hidden they are. Always friendly behind the counter and you must try all their sides - I love the potatoe salad and yogurt cucumber. Definitely worth the trip - even shocked friends with how excellent the food is!!"], ["Mai K.", "This place is cozy and the food was pretty good. Like many others after seeing the yelp top 100 best places the eat list, we flocked to this place. It's basically your mom and pop shop. The owner is extremely sweet and made us feel very welcome. We ordered the beef and chicken shawarma. I personally prefer the chicken sharwarma. Both were seasoned nicely, but the beef was a little bit on the drier side. However, dipping the sandwich in the hummus made it a nonissue. Their fries were also pretty darn good dipped in hummus. *drool* Anyway, I heard their baba ganouj is amazing.I will be back!"], ["Staci R.", "In the mood for Mediterranean and intrigued by the great Yelp reviews I came to Mister Falafel on a late Thursday afternoon with some friends. There was plenty of parking in the lot shared with other establishments which is always a plus. I was the last to arrive and my friends explained to me that not only were they greeted warmly by the owner (who I shall henceforth call Mr Falafel lol) but they were offered some complimentary hummus and pita chips while they waited. My friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant for a while so we were lucky to receive lots of personal and hospitable attention from Mr Falafel. Everything sounded and from the Yelp photos looked so delicious that we decided to order a little of everything. We had the Fattoush salad, \u00a0falafel, \u00a0tabbouleh ,baba ghanouj, the chicken shwarma, and the hummus. Everything was served with a side of warm pita. To say we were satisfied with our meals would be an understatement. We stuffed ourselves to the brim and all had leftovers to take home where we enjoyed it once more for lunch the next day. The prices are great and the service and food are awesome. All in all a great experience. I will definitely be back."], ["Jessica R.", "The owner is the nicest guy!!! \"You don't like it, I'll make you something else\" pfft no way! The food was incredible! Got the Kafta sandwich, the meat melts in your mouth! I'll be coming back for the shawarma :)"], ["James A.", "I tried the chicken shawarma and hummus; my wife had the falafel and baba ghanouj. Everything was delicious. The service was excellent. We appreciate all the vegetarian choices, as well as the burgers and fries for our somewhat-picky kids. Oh, and the garlic speed... if vampires existed they wouldn't get within a mile of us! We'll be back."], ["Courtney W.", "The food is amazing and priced really well especially how filling it is!! Great service also!"], ["Jerry C.", "A little slow to \u00a0get our food but it was worth the wait. Food Came out fresh. Had the Non Sharma Grilled chicken wrap. The chicken was a little bland so next time I will try the Sharma.Hummus was a good side order. The place can be little hard to find the GPS was taking taking me in circles. Very small place - like hole in the wall. Worth trying."], ["Jenna C.", "Tiny little shop hidden away behind a gas station. \u00a0Closed on Mondays. \u00a0Alright so I walked in and was greeted by the most sweetest, friendliest little man ever! \u00a0With such a warm smile! \u00a0Off to a good start already. \u00a0I ordered the beef schwarma (no rice), with taboulli and hummus, and a small lentil soup. \u00a0Prices are fair. \u00a0I'm kinda funny about my schwarma and taboulli but they were both good enough to pass my taste test. \u00a0The lentil soup needed a little kick, so when I got home I put some Cholula in it and it was perfect. \u00a0Maybe that's against the rules but I liked it much better after that. \u00a0I want to come back and try some falafels! \u00a0And the chicken schwarma!"], ["Izzat A.", "Saw the reviews on Yelp and stopped by here. Looks really unassuming from the outside but they serve fantastic food. I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap and it was outstanding. Good quality chicken that was seasoned well. The garlic sauce that was in it was very good and not overly garlicy. Service was very friendly. It feels like you're eating at somebody's home. Wife got a kofta burger which she liked a lot. Everybody was happy. Prices were very fair too. Props for being halal as well. Great little place to eat."], ["Janice D.", "We have been trying falafels all around san diego and so far this is my favorite place!!! the plate is soo good, the baba ganoush, tabbouleh, the fattoosh, hummus... ohhh my goodness... fresh and on point. Worth trying!!!! and the people, super friendly :D"], ["Polly H.", "The owners at Mister Falafel really take care of their customers! They make it a point to learn your name and help you make a decision on what to order. I ended up getting the falafel plate and got the tabouleh and baba ghanoush. I looooved the tabouleh; it tasted very fresh and citrus-y. The baba ghanoush was alright; it tastes better eaten together with other stuff like the falafels and the pita bread. I had never had baba ghanoush before so I wasn't sure what exactly it was or what to expect. It looks like hummus, but tastes very light! The falafels are great! VERY, very filling. The plate comes with 5 falafels - which are rather large too. Awesome price, big portions, fresh food!"], ["Matt C.", "This place was really great. \u00a0Family owned service and great food. \u00a0I got the falafel plate. \u00a0It was really good. \u00a0And the service went above and beyond. \u00a0You can tell they take pride in their food and their service. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["Jackie B.", "Great little hole in the wall. Delicious and fresh fattoush with beef shawarma and tzatziki sauce and grilled pita. Well priced and clean!"], ["Kairyn H.", "Such a great place! Amazing home cooked Lebanese food and the owners are kind and very welcoming. Today the power was out in the area and they still served me - treated me like family! Highly recommend!"], ["Veronica L.", "The owner was super friendly and personable, introducing each item and making sure we liked everything. I really don't eat Mediterranean food much and it isn't my favorite but my meal with falafel and pita wasn't bad. The servers started cleaning as we were still eating which made me feel rushed but it was fine overall."], ["Stefanie C.", "With its warm and welcoming service and fresh cuisine, it's no wonder Mister Falafel made it onto Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in 2015. It's easy to order food either to-go or dine in. I chose the Beef Shawarma plate ($10.99) with Tabbouleh and Hummus as my sides. The whole meal was delightful! My favorite parts were definitely the sides. Very freshly made. The beef was good but not overwhelmingly so. I'm glad they gave me a small dish of sauce, because the rice and beef would have been too dry otherwise. Good variety of menu items. Great place to take friends with certain dietary restrictions too. Congratulations, Mister Falafel!"], ["My S.", "Yum, their falafel sandwich were so delicious! And like I had read on the reviews they are so nice to their customers. My boyfriend and I was really hungry we came late and it took a while to get our food (no problem though) and the man who took our order gave us some samples of hummus and bread (maybe we looked hungry). Best hummus I have ever eaten."], ["Natalie P.", "Delicious, made to order fresh food! \u00a0Tucked in a corner but well worth the drive - so good, every time. \u00a0The owners are friendly and hospitable and I'll miss this place terribly."], ["Mohammad E.", "Excellent Lebanese food and very hospitable owners. Only down side: the place is too small"], ["T. H.", "After my first visit (a single takeout order), I debated between a four star and five star review. The falafel sandwich and service were both excellent, but I wasn't sure I had enough info to write an actual review. Fast forward a few days and add a few more people: my wife and three of our kids. I definitely \u00a0have enough info now. Our order: a falafel plate with hummus and baba ganouj, a falafel sandwich, and three burgers. My 15 year old destroyed the Kafta Burger as if it were trying to get away. The two younger boys would have preferred the classic burger, but they were out of them at the time. The falafel plate and sandwich were both excellent. The sandwich has some unique ingredients that provide a nice blend of flavors. Definitely a repeat order in the future. Hummus and baba were excellent as well. What put me over the top was the service. The young woman who took our orders was extremely patient and accommodating -- especially considering how long it took our kids to decide what to order. She also promised to make them something else if the boys didn't love their burger -- a proposition that one of them took her up on. Let's just say that 10 year old boys don't really appreciate a blend of good spices and migrate more towards something plain with some ketchup. This place is a great find. A definite diamond in the rough. Looking forward to another visit when my kids will have a better idea what to order. Shalom."], ["Eileen T.", "Came here for lunch and it was my first time here. The place is very small and clean. The owners are so friendly; they walk around to ask how your food was.I ordered chicken shawarma plate with baba ghanouj (eggplant dip) and cucumber yogurt salad. I mixed the cucumber yogurt salad with my rice and it blended so well. Everything I had on my plate was served fresh and tasted great! Would definitely come back to try out more items on the menu."], ["Brandon G.", "This place is really good and the people who work there are really friendly. I felt so bad for the people working inside because it was blazing hot but they were still pumping out all that Lebanese goodness. I ordered the chicken shwarma and was happy with my choice! I gave this place 4 stars only because of a slightly long wait time and because I've had better food elsewhere. However, you should definitely come here for good food, you won't be disappointed."], ["Mel J.", "The owners are the proud chefs at this tiny Lebanese hidden gem, where everything is made from scratch, and you can eat well for under $10! Now they are experimenting with new items which are only offered on the weekends. The Za'atar and Lahm bil ajeen were 2 new weekend-only items that I enjoyed recently. The spices for the Za'atar were imported from Lebanon, and the Za'atar looks like a small pizza pie with spices on top. It's delicious with yogurt. The Lahm bil ajeen is a Lebanese meat pie, and the meat had an exciting burst of flavors which were well balanced. If you visit Mr. Falafel on the weekend, check out the small board for new specials, or just ask about any new items. My favorite items on the regular menu are:--Beef shawarma plate with 2 sides for $9.50. Comes with scrumptious tahini sauce!--Lebanese chicken panini sandwich with choice of 1 side for $6.99. Comes with yummy garlic sauce!--Kafta sandwich for $7.50 with choice of 1 side. Secret tip: I order it with everything that it normally comes with, PLUS the sauce that normally only comes on the Kafta burger. --Kafta burger, fries & canned soft drink for $8.99. The sauce on the Kafta burger is addicting, but here's a warning...the bun is so tall that you will need a big mouth when you eat it. (-; \u00a0So delish!--Fattoush salad for $5.99. Made daily, so always fresh! Add chicken for $2.99 extra or add beef for $3.99 extra. Wonderful homemade dressing. --Labneh for $4.99: comes with Pita chips or pita bread. Eat as an appetizer or dab some on any sandwich. Best when shared as it's a big portion. It's like yogurt...it's actually kefir cheese with mint, garlic & olive oil drizzle. The rice that comes with the plates has a nice texture, and is cooked with vegetable broth, which keeps it moist and flavorful. I love all of the sides, but my 2 fav sides are the baba ghanouj and the tabbouleh. Any 2 sides can be chosen with the plates, including the baba ghanouj, but if you order a sandwich, you can choose 1 side, but NOT including the baba ghanouj. The Turkish coffee for $2.75 is strong and so smooth that I order mine without any sugar. Friendly, warm, and welcoming are the best way to describe the family that owns and runs Mr. Falafel. They take special care with phoned-in orders, if you don't want to wait in line. I prefer to dine in, because although it's tiny, it feels like home!You will find this hidden gem behind the Panda Country restaurant on Clairemont Mesa blvd, in a small strip mall on the corner of Genesee and Clairemont Mesa blvd. \u00a0I highly recommend Mr. Falafel, which serves healthy, homemade Lebanese food with pride, and the most expensive plate on the regular menu is only $9.50, so you get all of this goodness for under $10!"], ["Mel G.", "Great food !!!Really the BEST kafta sandwich in San Diego!!! Ask them to put French fries inside ! You wont regret it !!!"], ["Naznin U.", "DELICIOUS food!!! I loved their whipped garlic..it was amazing!! Everything is so fresh and light. The people here are also extremely welcoming and friendly!"], ["Marina K.", "Delicious food and friendly service, but for 5 solid stars they need a little bit of work. It took 20 minutes to get our food and they were empty, I mean no one was in the restaurant. The food was amazing with the exception of babaghanouj it was runny and not as good as I've had before."], ["Bryan E.", "Wow!!! Best food. \u00a0Great service ! The food is so fresh and delicious. \u00a0If it's busy ( and it always is ) it's worth the wait. \u00a0If you go once you will go back for more. \u00a0I've had everything on the menu. Not one bad choice. \u00a0They are all good. \u00a0It's all about freshness. \u00a0 No fast food here."], ["Giovanni S.", "This place is amazing and it feels like I'm eating at my moms house. It has a great homey feel and taste. I think I was reminded of home cooking because the cashier was a sweet lady who took my order and the chef brought my food and was very attentive. I had the falafel plate here with baba ganoush and yogurt and it was perfect. The falafel was freshly fried and tasted delicious. The yogurt was fresh and you could taste the mint. The baba ganoush was very smoky and had a peppery taste which was something unique to me. Most baba ganoush I've had in the past taste like hummus so to taste something new like that was great. With that said, service here was slow but it's because it's being cooked on the spot. I wish this restaurant faced the street because it faces the courtyard of a sad strip mall next to a mechanic shop. Overall I loved this place and can't wait to make a pit stop here again."], ["Arya I.", "I had a falafel plate for lunch , and it was awesome \u00a0with a reasonable price !Their fries are also very fresh.."], ["Dave S.", "My wife and I had the pleasure of eating Lunch at Mr. Falafel a few weeks ago. We have had dinner their in the past and thought to check it out for lunch. I had the chicken dish and the sauces were out of this world good. One was a pumus and the other was yellow in color and both were very tasty with the Chicken! I absolutely love this restaurant as its worth the drive from Bonita. If you like small, family owned restaurants that are very quaint with very fresh food that's absolutely delicious, then I recommend you try it out. It's casual, not pretentious and very friendly."], ["Elizabeth Y.", "Don't let the location fool you! Nicely tucked behind a gas station and a less than average strip mall with a mexican joint and a dentist, lies a well kept, clean, yet small Mediterranean local spot! You can tell the owner takes pride in what he does and even told me that he is representing where he is from and wants to show everyone the quality and greatness of their food. I'm glad he can live up to what he believes in! :)Everything is made to order and very fresh. It's just ran by him and his wife, who is also ultra friendly. I wish I remembered his name, but he wants to make sure you are 100% satisfied, so if you are at all not liking something to your desire, he will swap it out. (I didn't ask him to do that for my dish but he offered to take back one of my sides because I told him it wasn't my favorite out of the other sides I had!)I know we will be back, it's only a few miles away from us."], ["Ed M.", "Yelp has this ranked as one of its top places to eat in the country. \u00a0They have a sign at the front saying so. \u00a0This is such an unassuming place to eat being it's located in a strip mall near a gas station. \u00a0This is a small operation too. \u00a0I don't think it can seat more then maybe 15 people tops. \u00a0Walking in I was greeted by a nice woman working the counter. \u00a0I paid for the chicken shawarma plate with a side of babaganoush (no idea if I spelled it right) and a side of Labonese potato salad. \u00a0Paid just over $10. \u00a0The food was handed to me by what appeared to be the cook who gave me a hearty smile and wished me off as I did take out. \u00a0I have never eaten shawarma before but I must say I am probably going to be coming here pretty often when I have a fix for this. \u00a0It's hard to describe the taste. \u00a0It's a mix of tangy, salty, lemon, and surprisingly good food. \u00a0The way the food looks definitely doesn't taste like you think it would taste. \u00a0This is going to be one the places I will go when my taste buds wants Mediterranean type food. \u00a0The chicken appeared to be either grilled or baked so it is somewhat of a clean eating option. \u00a0All in all Yelp approved!"], ["Omar A.", "Solid lebanese food. The food is made fresh and is enjoyable. We ordered a falafel sandwich, a chicken shawerma sandwich, and their weekend special menu item, which was oven-baked kafta and potatoes on rice.The kafta and potatoes dish was incredible and reminded me of the one my mom made. This is a dish you won't find anywhere, because it is hard to predict how many people will order it. (Mister Falafel makes it one weekend a month.) The kafta was fresh and very flavorful. The potatoes were soft and delicious. The rice absorbed the flavor of the dish, so again, it was delicious.Their chicken shawerma sandwich was good, but not crazy good. The chicken was moist and it had all the ingredients that other shawerma places tend to skip. The problem was that there was too much bread and not enough filling. I believe they use a whole loaf of lebanese pita bread to make one sandwich. Way too much. It was on the dry side. The next time I order it, I will just opt for the \"plate\" version instead of the sandwich.The falafel sandwich was the same story. The falafel itself was fresh and seasoned very well. The rest of the ingredients were solid and authentic. But way too much bread. Again, next time I'll get it plated.The sandwiches came with sides, which were amazing. Baba Ghanouj was among the best I've ever had. The potato salad was homemade and yummy.The service is extremely friendly and is reminiscent of the Arab world. While we were there, every customer who walked in was a regular. A great environment.The place is a little small, its location is not great, and at least while we were there, the AC did not seem to be working correctly and it was very hot inside.Overall, I'd come back and try the plated versions of their sandwiches. I would especially come on weekends, when they have their \"special\" menu items, because that special was incredible."], ["Donovan B.", "I really like finding these places through Yelp, and trust me if it wasn't on here I'd have never found it. It's next door neighbor is a pile of junked cars from the gas station behind it. Once you step inside this hole in the wall you will forget about all that surrounds this place. The food is that good. My site got the chicken plate and I got the kafta plate and we tried 4 sides. Everything was great. I love places that make things to order and this was an excellent example of fresh food made to order. \u00a0I and my family loved it, and we are planning to go back."], ["Helena Z.", "Probably the best felafel I've ever had. The waitress was incredibly friendly and he service was fast. Try the labneh- it was amazing. Best Lebanese restaurant I've ever been to, one of my favorite restaurants in SD."], ["Mayra U.", "Very good Mediterranean food! They have a nice variety!!

My gosh, I have been to my fair share of restaurants in my lifetime and nothing compares to this in terms of overall satisfaction. To elaborate, the owner of this restaurant is a rather small statured man who is completely passionate about his product and work that he cannot recommend one single item as he truly believes that each and every one is great. What makes this place remarkable aside from his passion is his personal mission to make your dining experience enjoyable going as far as striking a conversation with each customer and providing complimentary snacks for each meal. If I had to given an Nobel Peace Prize, this man is on the top of my list. He could end wars with his amazing personality. In fact, when it came to ordering my meal, I asked for vegetarian recommendations and he took the time to describe and explain each vegetarian dish. This is nice, but given I had a friend with me, he made sure to assist her as well and providing equal good recommendations. For food though, the meal was quite pleasant as I ordered the baba ghanouj. The flavor was smokey with a light creamy texture mimicking hummus but only slightly. To top this, the meal was served with warm pita bread and complemented well due to the light and flakey consistency of the bread matched the healthy whole taste of the baba ghanouj. Additionally, the owner also brought complimentary toasted pita chips with what seemed like a powdered spice to dip the ghanouj with. Although I prefer the pita bread, the bread was more suited for a meal whereas the chips would work well as finger food.TL;DR Service made the meal first class with the food a close second."], ["April M.", "Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in San Diego. I usually get the kafta plate with cucumber yogurt salad and fries. I would also highly recommend the chicken Schwarma, potato salad and tabbouleh. If you want dessert, definitely try the knafe!! The food is amazing but what really excels is the customer service. Go for the food and stay for the owners. They treat all their customers with such courtesy and such a attentive care. We've been regulars since around the time they opened and they treat us like we're family. \u00a0It's been great to see them thrive and I love seeing them busy. \u00a0Definitely worth checking out!"], ["Bridget C.", "I don't know, maybe it was an off day or something, but I just wasn't that impressed. \u00a0The falafel sandwich was fine, but took forever to make (I want to say it was almost 20 minutes between ordering and getting the food) and I ended up just picking out the center and eating that with a fork. \u00a0The falafel itself wasn't close to the best I'd ever had, either. Final point that rubbed me the wrong way was when I asked whether they took card, and the person taking my order said \"Well, obviously we prefer cash if you have it. \u00a0Can you pay cash?\" \u00a0He then stared at me until I put my card away and watched until I started digging through my purse to find some change. \u00a0Don't pressure me not to use my card if your store takes card. \u00a0The end."], ["Brianna M.", "If I could eat here everyday, I would. In a heart beat! Excellent food made with love and fresh ingredients. The service was great (I believe I was helped by one of the owners) \u00a0he was the nicest man and so genuine! I ordered the falafel sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. It was a perfect size not too small or too large fresh fresh veggies and the falafel was moist and warm ...out of this WORLD!
