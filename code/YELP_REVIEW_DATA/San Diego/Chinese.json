The menu boasts a variety of traditional entrees, dim sum, and appetizers, and even fusion items like saladsand cream cheese wontons. items from Lucky Liu's is open 'til midnight on Fridays and Saturdays!#3: Decor is modern rustic, atmosphere is ambient with Asian charm.

A rock where Vietnamese food isn't served.Dropping by Phuong Trang earlier this week gave me an amazing orientation to the \"other\" Asian food that has somehow been neglected on my regular trips to dine out. I always go for Japanese, Thai and Chinese, and when I get Vietnamese I stick to pho noodle soup. But I'm glad I branched out by coming here.I ordered a delicious noodle dish off the \"bun\" section of the menu. As I learned, \"Bun\" is basically steamed rice noodle salad, so you get steamed noodles with thinly sliced raw veggies over a bed of lettuce, and then it's topped with a grilled meat or egg rolls of your choosing. I got the stir-fried shrimp and bean sprouts which were warm and savory on top to contrast the lighter, refreshing bottom of the giant bowl. On the side you're provided with a light housemade fish-sauce dressing that provides a nice tang to dress up your dish and take the flavors to that next level. The bowl was so big I ate half of it the next day as leftovers.The menu is massive and divided into sections (e.g. pho, bun, stir fry, etc) and there are even lots of Chinese dishes, especially under the specialties section. So if you want both Vietnamese and Chinese food in one sitting, this is your spot.My dining companion, who got pho noodle soup, also added a half order of garlic butter wings to our table. My oh my. I have never had a JUICIER tastier wing, it was just bursting with every bite and packed with flavor! This definitely had a butter flavor to it, versus the usual Chinese-style salt and pepper wings I would get at a place like Sam Woo or Royal Mandarin.The hilarious part of the meal that made me feel like such an uncultured foreigner was when my companion ordered the grilled pork skewers. Being that this dinner was my companion's first trip AT ALL to Convoy Street, he was equally clueless. \u00a0First came a huge plate of raw greens -- mint, cilantro, carrots, radish, cucumbers, canned pineapple chunks and a massive plate of rice papers a top a small bowl of warm water. We had NO CLUE that this came with the pork and asked our server if we had been given the wrong thing. Then when the pork was brought out (SO incredibly tender and flavorful!) we were still confused. We asked our waiter what was up and he said we were to wrap the pork and veggies with the rice paper. Ladies and gentlemen, please SOAK your rice paper circles before trying to eat it. I did not know this and tried to bite into what was basically inedible plastic. Later on my own I figured out we should soak them, and then they become soft and translucent, and delicious!Overall, an absolutely delicious meal for two with beers for only ~$40 with leftovers!

Or maybe they finally left the Dumpling Inn reign to their kids/younger generations and their Millennials decided to invest in the place. They moved from the little hole in the wall (probably seated like 20 max...if even) to the place next door, which looks like it can seat 5 times that amount AND has a full wrap around bar! With SD craft beers available (Sculpin + more). Also they have legit decorations, plants and nicer tables...instead of the typical Chinese restaurant decorations (think the \"lucky cat\" with the moving arm). Oh you can also see the chefs making the dumplings (like Din Tai Fung)...so this place is also new and cleaner too!Food was still good and cleaner than I last remembered. We got the mixed chow mein with home made noodles and it good. Not too saucey or even salty. We also got the Xiao Long Bao which was so good, we probably could have eaten 3-4 orders of this and be full. And our last plate was the kung pao seafood...which wasn't my favorite because it was too saucey. Maybe next time we'll stick with the popular dishes like the catfish. Service was ran by the OGs and it's a lot better, the younger workers are doing the hostess or at the bar. I really like the new venue.

I can recommend the dumplings, however the rest of the food was pretty medium and just enough to fill us up as we were very hungry. I think the best idea is to get Americanized food rather then ordering authentic Chinese food from the menu. The fried orange chicken looked really good.

Put our name down and it took us about 30-45 mins to be seated since we were a party of 9. 2) looked at the menu and didn't really have that many options to choose from (well there was, but not a lot for a usual Chinese restaurant). It had a whole page of entrees, half a page for noodle soup/lo mein, half a page for other noodles, back page for dinner packages for the dumplings. 3) we got our order fairly quick for knowing how busy it was. We had about 8 dishes and overall my favorite were the schezchuan (sp?) beef, garlic seabass, pan fried pot stickers, and the XLB. Although some of the dishes were a bit salty, it's ok4) Customer services was good. They filled up our water without hunting the sever down for more water. 5) I would recommend going to this place and will go here again. But, to only come here for the dumplings (duh that's why it's called the Dumpling Inn). But, I highly suggest to come here right when it opens or even before it closes to avoid the crazy wait."], ["Linda X.", "Wow I was blown away from how different this location was compared to the previous tiny place they had before! It's a beautiful space and tons of seating with a large bar in the middle. We walked in on a weekday for lunch and there was no wait. The service was quick and friendly.We ordered the famous xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings) 10 for $8. You seriously have to try these when you're here! The soup is hot, soo flavorful and very high quality. It took awhile for this dish to come out we actually finished our other dishes by the time it got to our table.We also tried the pork pot stickers (8 for $8) and deluxe fried rice ($11) that came with shrimp, beef, and chicken. They were both pretty good but I've definitely had better at other places.Come here for the xiao long bao! I'll probably just only get this next time. It's worth the trip out here, there's nothing else in San Diego like it!"], ["Christine K.", "First timer here!The decor is very updated, clean, wooden tables and high chairs in the lounge. There's also a very nice looking bar! Tvs everywhere. This place was modeled perfectly.Parking will give you some trouble if it's a weekend but you can park at Jasmines lot next door as well.I ordered the shrimp chow mein, deluxe noodle soup, shrimp and pork dumplings in hot sauce and xia long bao. In all honestly I'm not even a dumpling person! But the ones here were so good I wouldn't mind coming back for more. I would have gave this place a 4-5 star except for one dish and customer service.The deluxe noodle soup was so bland, sad and flavorless. Do not ever order this. I did not even touch it. No one at my table wanted to.The shrimp and pork dumplings in hot sauce and xia long bao were great and out of this world! It has truly started my love for dumplings!!The shrimp chow mein was very good! BUT my friend saw a hair in it. At first I thought it was a bean sprout but I moved it a bit and YES IT WAS A HAIR!!!!!!!! A little black hair. I have blonde hair and my friend has purple hair so obviously it's not any of us. Told the waitress she gladly took back the dish and said they would make a new one. Some guy comes back with a new dish and says \"Upon further examination it was just a burnt bean sprout but we made you a new dish anyways\" with attitude and I was so pissed off I didn't even eat the new dish. I should have just voided it off the menu. That moment just ruined my night.Hopefully I'll find another dumpling location I can enjoy or they should really get their sh*t together here."], ["Pat F.", "This review is more Shanghai Saloon based than Dumpling Inn based. We've dined here three times since the Dumpling Inn-Shanghai Saloon had launched at their new location on Convoy Street. Those familiar with the authentic Chinese food which the Dumpling Inn served when they were next door to the optometrist shop with 9 tables will be ecstatic that they now have 35+ tables throughout their dining room. Don't think for a moment that there won't be a scramble for a table with all that extra room. Next to Kula Sushi Lounge, Dumpling Inn-Shanghai Saloon is the next most popular spot in the strip mall they're located at (yes even more popular than Jasmine).We've sat at the bar all three times and Shanghai Saloon has an abbreviated dining menu consisting of small bites, appetizers, and a limited number of offerings. On Sundays, you can order everything from the Dumpling Inn menu at the bar. On all other occasions, you can only order off their bar menu. The bartenders Shawn (Bar Manager), Devin, and Steve are all really really cool and many of you may remember them when they worked for another very bar & burger spot some time ago. Standout dishes we've ordered were the: X-L-Bao (of course), their pork pot stickers, 3-ingredient (chicken, fish, shrimp) pan fried noodles, deluxe fried rice, lollipop fried chicken, & ahi poke salad.This Chinese Restaurant/bar has by far the one of the best lounges with couches and coffee tables set up to the left with many large screen television monitors to watch your favorite sports on. Go check it out! Their bar has plenty of seating on three sides at the center of the Dumpling Inn dining room! You may see us there if you stop in. Kudos to the owners for putting a place like this together which has all the right stuff. I wish they served food longer into the evening... I believe the kitchen stops preparing food at 10:00pm even though they continue to run the bar well into the late night."], ["Huy D.", "Easily the best chinese dumpling house in San Diego. This reataurant was housed in a small shack in the Asian district of Convoy st but now it moved to a location worthy of its stature in this community. Shanghai Saloon has been revamped for the better in all ways. The new theme is an old western chinese bar. Step inside the restaurant and you are taken back to the old wild west. Every element in the restaurant reeks of old western-chinese influence. The menu is large with many options. The typical choice is the xia long bao - juicy pork dumplings. There's nothing more to be said about that dish. It's just a must have entree that defines Dumpling Inn. Today I tried the fried rice with shrimp and the stir fry noodles with shrimp. For the noodlea, I selected the wide house made noodles which cost extra but taste so much better than the regular noodles. This dish reminds me of chow fan. The diah comes out smoking with the smoky smell and flavor. Large firm shrimps fill up the dish. Taste is excellent. The fried rice comes out the same way, smoky and delicious with large shrimps. Everything tastes wonderful. The quality of the dishes at Dumpling Inn stands out from the numerous other Chinese restaurants in San Diego. \u00a0After finishing eating, I do not have that icky dry mouthed feeling that I get from eating chinese food at your average chinese sit down restaurant. Must be the good quality ingriedients. Service was average. Not up to par with the American restaurants but better than the typical chinese restaurants. Parking in the plaza is tough though since the plaza is filled with many popular stores and not enough parking spots. Be prepared to park on the streets.Taste rules and this is the best lunch/dinner chinese food in San Diego so 5 stars!"], ["Roger M.", "I sort of miss the small hole-in-the-wall feel of their original location. But this new minimalistic hipster ambiance is not too shabby either. Who would have though that craft brews and crafted cocktails can be mixed together with \"little dragon dumplings?\"I've came back a handful of times since they've moved into the new building and found that it's much faster to get a table now that they've got much more space. If you're not looking to have a proper meal but just want to get your dumpling fix, you can just order directly at the bar. If you're a newbie or at a lost of what to order, here are a couple must haves:- XLB (their abbreviation for siu lung bao/xiao long bao). Having it with a splash of soy sauce/vinegar/ginger is a necessity!- Beef curry dumpling. This is sort of like a Chinese style samosa, with a lovely curry beef stuffing. Goes well with beer by the way! I noticed some reviews ordering orange chicken here. This is not the place to order that (take your arse over to Panda Express for that). Eat plenty of dumplings and wash it all down \u00a0(especially that MSG) with a nice pint of brew!"], ["Jason T.", "Definitely worth checking out. Sit at the bar if you can and enjoy some great local beers. My wife and I came in 20 minutes before close and the service was incredible. We didn't feel rushed and they even brought out each item separately to ensure we ate everything hot. Damn it was good. We started with the kung pao striped sea bass, yum. Light, crispy, and full of flavor, will definitely be ordering again. Next we had the steamed fish and chive dumplings. Solid. Tender and great flavor. Mix a little chili sauce, soy, and sesame oil in your little dish and dip generously. We wrapped up with the pan fried shrimp dumplings. So damn good. I could explain but you need to try it for yourself. Do yourself a favor and order them pan fried.I've been a few times and the food has been great each visit but this time was extra great because of the service. Our bar tender recommended a killer IPA and took time to poor tasters for my wife and I even though it was close to quitting time. I can't remember his name but he was working Sunday night 10/25/15 in case management wants to give him a pat on the back. He was really nice and enthusiastic about the food and beer it was obvious he enjoyed his job.Check this place out for sure, you won't be disappointed."], ["Dong P.", "With a name like Dumpling Inn - Shanghai Saloon, one could only wonder what manner of deliciousness this place could deliver. Inside, your senses are welcomed by lovely aromas from the East, coupled with hipster bar chic from the college age West. Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Maybe it's both!I've generally gone by a simple rule that if the restaurant doesn't cater to the ethnicity of where its food hails from, then it's probably no good. No doubt, this was no low rent shopping mall Panda Express nor did it attempt to be a sit down suburban PF Changs. But without any Chinese people in sight, I was pretty damned surprised to find that the food was quite good. Here is a breakdown of my culinary experience at Dumpling Inn:xialongbao - 3/5 stars, what happened to the soup inside?won ton soup - 3/5, won tons were good, soup was on the bland side of the spectrumpot stickers - 4/5, perfectly pan friedfried rice - 4/5, tasty, fried rightpan fried noodles - 4/5, great balance of crispy noodles and savory gravygarlic baked fish - 4/5, tasty fish without the fish tastepepper steak - 5/5, the best I've had in a whileService was attentive and always on point with any last minute requests, despite being part of a very large, multi-generational party of Vietnamese and Midwesterners. Perhaps this blend of East meets West offered at Dumpling Inn was the perfect venue to host our event after all. I think I'll probably come back again if I was in the area."], ["Nhu N.", "Wow!!! This place is so big now! Such a change. They recently relocated to the old market right next to their original place. Everything is so different now! Workers actually have uniforms now, there's a bar, decorations are completely different and nice now, and there are probably over 20 tables instead of 5. Everything has improved. I'm so glad they finally invested a bigger location. Food is still as good. I got the fried potstickers and 3 ingredient lo mien like I usually. So delicious!! Service was great! They refilled my water a few times and constantly checked up on us!"], ["Jake A.", "Likely the best tasting dumplings (specifically Xao Long Bao aka soup dumplings) in San Diego. Not nearly as legit as Din Tai Fung (for those of you that know), but it'll satisfy your local cravings. This new location at Shanghai Saloon is a huge improvement...to include the appearance, draft beers, and air conditioning. The food here is great, and the dumplings are solid. I highly recommend that you take your guai lo friends....its a local favorite for good chinese food."], ["Khrysten T.", "I've been all over Convoy, but never here until recently. The inside is spacious and looks newly done. I've only gone during the weekend, so I'm unsure how busy it gets during the week. I'm usually able to just grab a seat at the bar. Their dumplings are so good! My favorite are the ones with like a pork soup inside (Xiao... something). Their chow mein is very flavorful, as is their won ton soup, which is also perfect for a rainy day. Their happy hour prices are a steal. I've had their pork belly sliders, tuna tostadas, and their cream cheese rangoons. I would order everything, except the tuna tostadas, again. Great place to watch Sunday football that isn't too crowded on Sundays. Just beware that their parking lot is shared with Jasmine and several other stores, so parking is an absolute nightmare."], ["Conrad R.", "I like what you've done with the place. Much more dining room seating than before. A well stocked bar with crafty beers plus a swanky lounge area. The food is tasty. Service is ok. The lack of parking spaces is abysmal, especially with a new sushi spot that dropped, stopped, and opened up shop next door. It's a slick setup inside and a fresh departure from the original humble beginnings of Dumpling Inn's dining room, which was a handful of tables in front of mirrored walls for the illusion of a bigger space. The XLB is still delicious as well as their other freshly made dumplings. The restaurant theme is consistent throughout the room and visually pleasing.The central Shanghai Saloon is a nice addition, including an array of craft beers, a variety of spirits and a lounge area. We were there for lunch, so daydrinking wasn't in the plan. We'll be back during Happy Hour for drink specials and to check out the separate menu of bar snacks.The third feature is Dai-Pai-Don, a cash-only late night snack bar inspired by HK and SE Asian street bites and comfort foods. Check out the chalkboard menu for daily specials. There is a convenient ATM by the door, although I find it odd that this snack bar is cash & carry, yet Dumpling Inn & Shanghai Saloon both take cards.Hopefully the parking situation doesn't discourage. Dumpling Inn-Shanghai Saloon brings a new school restaurant bar to Convoy St that is worth checking out."], ["Adria D.", "I like the old dumpling inn better. The service was horrible and the soup dumplings were dry and generic. Definitely not the same. Rip dumpling inn :( Don't get Kung pao chicken either it has no heat and also lacked flavor.

Probably not but who are we kidding? \u00a0People complain about the parking but it's Convoy and there really isn't anywhere other than the car dealerships and Zion that have a decent lot so I'm not knocking them for that.So drop by and check it out if you've been thinking about it. Dumpling Inn has something for everybody and are a pretty comfortable place to kick back and enjoy some food and drink."], ["Francisco M.", "The dumplings here are always great. Last night was my first time there since the remodel. The place looks amazing. The beer barrel tables in the front of the restaurant are awesome to see. With the whole saloon rebrand, they have a full bar in the middle now. They offer 30+ beers, hard liquor, and a whole bunch of drink specials. This is definitely a place to host dinner parties now! The food has always been great here. My wife ordered cashew chicken. I normally hate cashew chicken but this time around I almost finished it. Good Chinese food is hard to come by in San Diego. So this is definitely a go to spot!I didn't give them 5 stars because I think the plates are a little more pricy than traditional Chinese restaurants and don't give as big portions. But I will be back to try the pork belly sliders!"], ["Jannet C.", "Amazing ambiance, good prices, attentive service, delicious food- this place deserves 5 out of 5 stars from me! I have never visited the old location, but I adore the layout of this place and the saloon style, intimate feeling once you open the doors to Dumpling Inn. Despite the rather grand appearance however, it's dumplings are simple, yet quite delicious!This visit I got to try their quite WELL known soup dumplings and the curry dumplings. I wasn't too big a fan of the fried curry dumplings mainly since I'm not used to the two being mixed together- but those soup dumplings were pretty spot on. Flavorwise, they gave me the impression of 'mellow richness' if that makes sense: the flavors worked well with each other but weren't overly rich.The only qualm I have is that I wanted more soup in the dumplings!

The chicken size was bigger than the McDonald's nugget and it taste like it came from a frozen batter chicken that they decided to toss it in there. We did not let our daughter eat it.
