The quality is good enough, but I do wish the Tandoori chicken was a tad bit more spicy and more of that tandoori flavor with all its lovely seasonings, besides the somewhat deceiving strong color, it kind of lacks in that authentic Tandoori flavor. The pricing is ok. It's pretty good but at the same time the flavors are not really strong enough for me, I think they go too light with the spices.

However, last night I saw through an open door into the kitchen a giant bottle of red food coloring. The bottle was almost empty. I don't know if this is a common practice, but the tandoori chicken looks like it had been collared red with artificial dye. That is not cool, as typically Tumerick powder or papeika can be used to alter the color without resorting to artificial dyes.Also, when I eat their Indian dishes like saag paneer, they have a lot of curry sauce but very little cubes of cheese. It feels like they are stingy with the cubes of cheese.Beside from the food coloring and the stinginess with the cubes of cheese, I like the food, the people are friendly, and I would go back."], ["H D.", "Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite.

The one that wasn't occupied had a drink, a coat and a newspaper on it. It looked like an Indian paper, and like a restaurant employee had been sitting there until a late rush.I asked the woman behind the counter if I could sit at that table, and if someone could clean it up.

An Indian place that makes it as hot as I like! Pretty stoked to find Indian so close to home too. Also, as we walked up, I told my girlfriend not to expect much in d\u00e9cor, as Indian places tend to be tucked away in forgotten mini-malls of the '80s, and this place looked to be the same (in behind Phil's and Red Lobster). When we walked in, however, it was a nice change of pace from the usual. Tastefully done, well lit, nicely greeted, and no huge bigscreen belting out Bolliwood movies. The two guys servicing the place were super nice, helpful, and attentive without being bothersome. We started with veggie samosas, a few orders of naan, and two orders of chicken tikka. TWO, you ask? Yeah. Turns out the only person in our house, that can handle the HOT food I can....is the dog. So, if the same thing looks appealing to us, my girlfriend has to order a milder version, or else her face burns off. It's kind of a bummer because we go home with lots of leftovers, but at least I can order things past 10, especially when I think they'll really cook it that way. The other thing I notice, is that places where they are really going to give it to you hot often test you with little treats to see if you can handle it, and they also laugh at you when you tell them you want it as hot as they eat it. This place was no exception. Guy looks at me, and goes, \"Really??\", \"Are you sure? Because, it's really hot.\" When I told him I wanted it redder than the tablecloth, he finally understood. What was really cool, is that he brought me some sort of chili paste that was hotter than the sun, in a genuine interest of me trying something new. It was amazing and I ate it on everything that was put in front of me. The samosas were amazing. Flaky, steaming hot, and with a wonderful flavor. The Tikka was equally good, with really high quality white meat chicken, a glorious sauce, and plenty of it. Rice was the same, and although the naan was not as fluffy as what I'm familiar with, it was good in its own way. One thing I realized, if that you're not in the mood to drink, as I wasn't, order yourself a Coke. For some reason, it just fits and was one of the best Cokes I've ever had.I would actually drive to eat here, which is more than I can say of many Indian places in town. The prices are extremely reasonable. The service is great. The food, most importantly, tastes fresh, and is cooked with pride and creativity.

Perhaps I have high expectations because I've eaten a lot of really good Indian food, but this was truly terrible. I will not be back.I went to eat here after getting my hair done at Salon Soul\u00e9 next door and I was excited. Indian food is my favorite (when prepared right). Immediately upon walking in the door I noticed it was REALLY hot inside the restaurant. I was seated by the hostess who took my bread and drink order and then told me to go help myself at the buffet.My first impression was of this big pan of yellow mush. The sign said it was rice. It looked like they put 2x to 3x too much water and still decided to serve it to customers...Basmati Rice is supposed to be dry. Even I know this and I'm a \"gora\". Since this is all the rice there was I decided to get some...and have an open mind about it. Maybe it's supposed to be that way? Next I got some Chicken Vindaloo and Aallo Anday. These looked safe, I mean how can you mess up potatoes and chicken? Again, even I can cook those and I'm a white boy. Well these were terrible too. The Chicken Vindaloo had hardly any meat - it was all bones. And absolutely no flavor. It was like chicken in watered down tomato sauce. And the Aallo Anday also didn't taste like anything. It was like eating boiled potatoes that weren't cooked all of the way in some kind of bland gravy.I choked down what I could of this and went back to try different dishes. I decided to skip the yellow mush this time and instead got some Daal soup and some vegetable korma. The Daal soup was actually good - like everything else they didn't put ANY spice in it - I guess they were scared of Americans complaining it is too hot? - but the vegetable korma was terrible. It was sweet rather than spicy or gingery. There were chunks of something in it...it didn't taste like paneer or tofu...so who knows what it was.I gave up on trying anything else at this point. As I finished my last few bites of Daal soup, my bread finally came. The rotti bread was actually good. Too bad it didn't come until I was done eating. While all of this took place, the health inspector was in the kitchen with the hostess.

Some other dishes I typically order are the chicken tikka masala (tomato curryish sauce), paneer (cheese cubes) tikka masala, some kind of biryani (seasoned rice with goodies), and maybe a channa masala (garbanzo beans). All of these go great with naan (preferably garlic), in fact don't eat them without naan! This places spicy scale is also off the charts.

We ordered quite a variety of menu items each visit in order to test consistency and determine the potential of being regulars.

The lentil soup is incredibly smooth and packed full of flavors! My new favorite food to eat: vegetable momo. TO DIE FOR! They are a dumpling similar to Japanese gyoza and this particular flavor was full of minced cashew, herbs, and a variety of chopped vegetables. Truly wonderful despite its affect on me (I get greedy!)! We tried several different naan: cilantro garlic, garlic and herbs, plain, and onion. The cilantro garlic and onion varieties were our favorites. Balanced flavor and texture! You do need to request chutney to accompany the naan! For our entrees we shared a tandoor salmon well done: the vegetables were excellently prepared, al dente which is how I enjoy my vegetables best. They were not oily and were a fresh accompaniment to the protein! The fish was cooked as I requested and had a marvelous char and was succulent and moist! I was pleasantly surprised at the reheating value the next couple of days! The other entree we shared was a level 7 spice of cauliflower in a tomato curry sauce (can't recall the exact name), MAGNIFICENT! This was far too spicy for me by day 3 of leftover status.

We also got the garlic naan which was the BEST part of the meal. It satisfied our tastebuds 100%. The vindaloo has a set spice level of very spicy and it was true to its spice level. It was also tangy, sweet and spicy just like how the description said it would be and I thought it was pretty good. But I'm not a huge fan of it. The Bali beef was a different flavor entirely and it had a coconut flavor to it which made it taste creamy and smooth unlike the vindaloo. Both curries came with salad which was salty due to the dressing they used.The regular portions were good enough for one meal and I couldn't finish the last 20% of it.

I don't know how big the portion size will be but it's still a great way to try (or re-try) World Curry.Here's what we tried from that prix fixe menu:PHALL POPPERSThese cream cheese stuffed eggrolls have a bit of their phall curry inside. The phall curry is bat sh*t crazy SPICY. We loved these poppers. TIKKA TACOOne of THE BEST things I've eaten all year. The taco is made with World Curry's roti flatbread (which was so soft & nicely chewy) and stuffed with their tikka chicken. It's covered with fresh cabbage and smothered in sauce (curry? cream?). VEGGIE PAKORAThere were lots of fresh vegetables (zucchini, carrots, onions, broccoli) in this pakora. The chickpea batter could have been crispier.NAANThis is the underbelly of the naan. The naan was clay oven baked beautifully.THAI GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN & VEGGIES; TIKKA MASALA WITH CHICKENI was shocked to see this dish as my memory of this place was jostled once again. I asked Momo (one of the owners) if they always served their rice in that pyramid shape. She smiled and said yes. It's funny the stuff your head remembers! I enjoyed the Thai green curry as it was lightly sweet and had a thinner (curry) sauce. The tikka masala was a thicker curry with almost a grittier texture. I wish I could remember what Bruce said was used in their tikka masala. The chicken tasted fine but could have been served warmer.BANANA FRITTER WITH COCONUT ICE CREAMYou could taste that they make their coconut ice cream in house. It was a wonderfully coconut-y ice cream topped with toasted coconut. The fried banana fritter had a nice crunch (I think they used a wonton wrapper) and would be a nice dessert option if you like something sweet and gooey (from the caramel sauce and hot banana flesh).The owners Momo and Bruce are such sincere hard working people.

They didn't have any of the \"Singapore\" curry left, so I opted for my second choice - I had the soup, salad and naan deal with the Thai yellow curry soup. I can absolutely take responsibility for not returning it when I should have, as it tasted oddly sour but I chalked it up to the spices and salted the oddness away, but was barely a quarter in before I started feeling nauseas. Obviously i soldiered on as its curry, and I didn't want to waste my money but couldn't finish more than half. Was tasting it come back up every time I burped or breathed in too hard. Promptly went home and involuntarily puked the whole thing up. Yikes! So maybe if your food tastes odd, let them know - I'm guessing the coconut milk had gone sour.

I even let a LivingSocial voucher I bought almost a year ago expire on me! Tonight, I finally, finally answered that question in my head whether it was any good.Well it IS good! The chicken tikka masala I ordered had a nice layered flavor, not sharp in any way and was lightly creamy. It was amazing with their chewy medium grain brown rice, and I love the little cabbage salad (with vinaigrette) that they give you on the side since this dish is just meat, sauce and rice. You can order the curries in two sizes: regular for around $9 and large for around $11-12. You can also get a smaller bowl size version for $6.99. Reasonable prices for a legit meal. I'm not a tikka masala connoisseur but have had it many times where the flavor is sharp from tomato and I preferred World Curry's.I look forward to returning to try the Thai massaman curry, which is apparently their top seller next to the tikka masala. And I'm also interested in their new Thai/Indian vegan yellow curry that has been featured on their board the last few times I passed by.

I ordered the Golden Curry which is essentially red curry with coconut milk and almonds. I have never had curry with almonds before, and I was pleasantly surprised. The almond adds a nice texture to the curry. The hubby ordered the Keema Curry which is minced chicken with tomato, peas and cilantro.

IT WAS DIVINE. We loved the fritters so much, we didn't even think of eating it with the ice cream at the same time (we definitely will next time). But there was absolutely no rush from the servers. They checked up on us A LOT which made me happy. We even ordered two drinks - the thai tea and green tea frappe. Both were just right for our distinct tastes.

There has always been a bit in past orders, but I have been able to eat around it. Not the case this time. I called the restaurant and asked them to just take it off the bill as the dish was inedible for me (ridiculous, I know, but I just cannot stand cilantro!) The restaurant offered to send a new order, which was appreciated, but we didn't want to wait and decided to just share the tikka masala, so they just comped it. In retrospect, we definitely should have checked the chicken tikka masala before calling about the other dish, as it was also chock full of cilantro. It was when I called back to ask them to just send a replacement of the whole order instead if comping it that things went awry. The woman who answered the phone was incredibly unpleasant and said that it was my fault for not ordering the dishes without cilantro. This would have been a valid, if rude, thing to say, except that I have had both dishes before and have never had a problem with them. I just did not expect this much deviation in a dish from one visit to the next. Honestly, the whole thing would have been fine if they hadn't been so rude about it.

Id say my only real complaint is how long it took to get my order during lunch hours when there was nearly no one in there...I actually had to end up asking for it to go because they took so long.

Nevertheless, the food was pretty good and the servings were generous. All entrees came with a side of basmati rice. We tried out the new place on a Friday night and it was empty! The first thing the new ownership did is jack up prices (not a smart move for a business that was already struggling with traffic). Before, you could get a $14 tikka masala plate with a complementary serving of basmati rice (very common for Indian restaurants). Now, the much smaller tikka plate will cost you $18 and rice is extra!As far as taste, it's pretty bad. The tikka masala sauce quite literally tasted like canned Italian marinara sauce! Very bland.

I tried to justify it, believing that good food comes to wait.As most yelpers wrote, the food here is good (which is why this place is getting 3 stars instead of 2), but I think it's a little bit more on the expensive side for what you get. I've personally had better, cheaper Indian/Himalayan food; I only went here because I wanted to take a friend out on her birthday. And to top it all off...they got our order wrong. After all that wait, wouldn't you think you would be a little more meticulous and get it right? We didn't send it back because we were too hungry. :-/ At least it tasted good....I will say that our server was nice and checked up on us every now and then. So kudos to that.We didn't feel like going far and being that she lives in PB, we decided to go here. I think I should've been a little more proactive in going to Downtown instead of this place because I wasn't that impressed."], ["Traci B.", "Again another amazing dinner at this insanely beautiful restaurant.

From 11-3pm is their buffet. Cost is cheap at 8.99 M-F and 9.99 sat and sun. Parking was an issue as many businesses share the small parking lot. To be honest, this was my first time trying out Indian food. Didn't know what to expect, but I was in for a treat. I'm not really into curry, but the Indian version of curry was a pleasant surprise. I tried the chicken tikka masala and I swear there was a lot going on in that curry. Lots of flavor and spice sang a sweet saffron song inside my mouth. Samosas was crispy and potato filling inside was a bit much in terms of fullness. Tandoori chicken was a bit dry and seasoning was a bit salty. The naan bread was fluffy awesome to use to dip with the curry sauce. Biriyani chicken basmati rice was a bit dry but good spices. Saag paneer (green curry) was not spicy at all and a welcome addition with the plain white rice. Achari chicken was good with me with mild heat spice level. There was salad, orange slices, and rice pudding for the side items. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Bathroom was unisex yet well kept. There's a TV that plays hindi cinema music videos. Funny thing is that I recognize some of the movies that the songs are based on. This place may have set the bar high for Indian food for me. This place is literally 3 mins. away from home. Small selection of buffet items but price is really good for what you get. If you are in the area craving for hindi cuisine, try this joint out.

The vegetable samosa was good with the green mint hot sauce that they provide. It was crunchy on the outside and very soft in the inside. The chicken tikka masala however, was delicious! I wish it was a little spicier but the overall taste was great. They were really generous about their chicken which was a plus. I don't know what they put in their rice but I love the texture of it!

Big plus of Halal meats :)! Flavors were nice but not vibrantly outstanding-- a bit mild/watered down-- but everything for the price was perfectly okay by me.

We gobbled it up while still hot and the cheese, liquidy. The Vindaloo with vegetables and the saag paneer were delicious. Samosas were crunchy and the filling spot on(even though they were not authentic samosas the outer layer was made of spring roll paper). It took very little time to clean-lick the samosa plate with their chutneys. Usually Indian food leftovers taste bad the next day for whatever reason(mostly it has to do with the restaurant quality). We had our Sundara leftovers the next afternoon and they were still yummy! So yes, take those boxes home people. Don't waste the food! I think they make their own sweet chutney and wow! It had an amazing zing to it. The food was beautifully presented and the wait staff was especially awesome and caring. We ordered a spice level 7 and the vindaloo was steaming spicy wile the saag paneer was just right. I suggest going down a notch for the vindaloo gravy.One star off for: Lack of dessert options. They have \"rice pudding\" or payasam as it's called in south India but that is the most basic and boring pan-Indian dessert to have at a restaurant for 5.50. I'm sure it would have tasted great.Another thing I noticed is, when a large group of guests left, the waitress just wiped off the rice from their table onto the floor!! :-o :-oI am very particular about rice wastage especially, as it is a value taught in my household that rice signifies prosperity.

The dining room is quiet and intimate, and the menu offers homestyle curries that feel wholesome and comforting. The owner isn't Indian but he's somehow created authentic fare, from the chutneys, to the naan and the saucy, flavor-filled curries. The menu isn't too big, but they seem to know what they do well. My friends who are regulars brought me here last weekend and we ordered the Vindaloo (just a little spicy) and the Tikka Masala, and added cheese naan and all three of the chutneys. We also ordered the Indian-fusion spicy pork ribs appetizer which I highly recommend. My friend told me that the paneer (cheese) when ordered instead of meat is presented in one big slice versus chunks or small pieces.I'll definitely be back, especially since my friends are already hooked!"], ["Angel L.", "A very cozy/quaint Indian restaurant.

It is both crispy and soft. The chutneys are also really good. Others who tried the mint chutney said it was really good, as I am not a fan of mint.The pizza was just amazing. I've had Indian style pizza elsewhere in Miramar, but that was underwhelming and unremarkable. This pizza though, exudes Indian in and out. The pieces of chicken hide inside the sauce under the cheese. Based on the size of the chicken I think it was ground chicken.The ribs were good, but it didn't scream indian to me.

Can't resist fresh baked breads of any kind!Curries:Dal MakhaniChanna MasalaChicken VindalooAll the curries were delicious! Of the 3, Dal was the least intense in terms of spice and spiciness. It is a really good dish to order if you're just going to eat it by yourself. Channa was also delicious but the spicy is significantly stronger. The garbanzo beans are very very tender. The Chicken Vindaloo is the spiciest of all. The chicken was very tender, but it does not absorb all that heat from the sauce.Dessert:Authentic Rice Pudding: topped with almonds and pistachiosI had a few bites of this.

They've also done something really smart, which is offering delivery in Ocean Beach and Point Loma. Since OB is perpetually 420, I'm sure they are making a killing with their delivery service (you can order through Yelp or on their website)! Just be patient as delivery usually takes 45 mins-1.5 hours.I have ordered several items for delivery, and most of them are really good while a couple are \"meh.\" My favorite item has to be their Spicy Baby Back Ribs appetizer. It comes with two large, very tender, baby back ribs in a dish with a really delicious dark sauce. True to it's name, the sauce is a bit spicy, but just the right amount! I like the sauce so much that I also order a plain Naan because it's perfect for dipping in the sauce.Also good is the order of Samosas. Two very crispy samosas are in each order, and they're packed with a mix of vegetables including potatoes and peas. I love that they come with both a tamarind sauce and a mint chutney because they impart two very distinct and different flavors to the samosas.I've also had the rice pudding, which is OK but it's too runny. The Chicken Tiki Masala was mediocre because I think the sauce could use a kick of some additional spices. Judging by the Yelp reviews, some people love the Tiki Masala, but it tasted kind of \"blah\" to me. I'll still order delivery, and some day I may actually trek to the restaurant itself."], ["Ravi R.", "This was one of those unexplored places.

They not only offer great service but the food was really delicious as well. We asked for some onions and the guy (who was serving us) obliged us with a plate of sliced onions, chilies and some lime.

What makes this place even better is that they deliver (dangerous commodity, really) From here I've had the samosas, masala paneer, saag paneer, several types of naan.... and while everything is good, the real winner for me were the samosas, specially with the tamarind sauce. They were of good proportion, seasoned to perfection, filled with all the right stuff and not super oily. Also, perfect to share with someone.

The dishes are also served with a huge portion of Basmati rice. We were blown away. Great flavor, quality, and service. However, my second visit was this past Thursday night. The food was not as good as the first time. My boyfriend and I got the Channa Masala, Paneer Tikka Masala, sesame naan, and mango lassi. The sesame naan was subtle in flavor which made it delicious. Paneer Tikka Masala was comforting and warmed us up \u00a0however the Channa Masala was overwhelmingly salty. It was disappointing because Channa Masala is my all time favorite. I think tonight was just an off night but I still love and believe in this Indian gem. I informed the server of the super salty Channa masala and she was very nice about it. She asked us if we wanted another dish and I ordered the Vindaloo to replace the Channa Masala. The vindaloo was much more spicy and rich in spices and flavor.

The cilantro garlic naan was not good; it was doughy. Added nothing to the meal.The saag paneer was generous with the paneer cheese, but it had an unusual flavor and thickness. It did not taste like other times I've had this dish. It just simply didn't taste that good.The chicken tikka masala was also just a bit off. It didn't have the wonderfully complex and deep flavors that you expect in this dish and in much of Indian cooking. It was just Meh.The rum mango lassi didn't taste of mango nor rum. Just tasted like thick yogurt with a tiny hint of fruit.Even the raita wasn't good. It seemed like yogurt with a few pieces of cucumber in it. It was thicker than usual and didn't have much flavor.The samosas were good.Service was nice, and prices were ok, but the food was lackluster and flavors were off.

After having done a little bit of research on this place I figured it was worth a shot. My dinner, shared among a total of four adults, consisted of: samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, and two pieces of naan(1 plain, 1 garlic-cilantro). The ambiance of the place is great, it gives you a hole-in-the-wall feel with pleasant waiters/waitresses. The price is more than fair as the quality of the ambiance and the quality of the food was good. But why only A-OK (3-stars, as Yelp likes to refer to it as)? The entire meal seemed way too salty. The chicken tikka masala had a good tomato taste to it, but became quickly overwhelming as the salt took over. The vindaloo even more so when combined with the mildly more spicy nature of the curry. The chicken within the curries were succulent, moist, and generous. But the servings were generous as was the serving of basmati rice that came with the curry orders. The garlic-cilantro naan had solid garlic and cilantro flavor too, but coupled with just maybe a dash too much salt. BUT, with that said the samosas were fantastic, maybe a little over-fried at the edges, but I am more than happy to let that slide when the samosas are well filled and massive! The tandoori chicken is to die for. Flavorful and very moist (not something you expect from a chicken that is cooked under really heavy duty heat). I will admit that I've had a mixed experience with regards to the food at this restaurant, but because this is only my first visit, I hope to be able to update this review at a later time with more favorable conclusions."], ["Bridget H.", "Delicious!

This was a nice change. Service was friendly, fast, and good, but we came earlier and the restaurant was empty. This place is nice, but small - there are maybe 3 booths inside and a larger selection of tables on the covered patio out back. Nice atmosphere overall, particularly for an Indian restaurant. The naan was delicious - fresh and hot, well spiced, a bit crispier than I usually see. The samosas were the best I've ever had - lots if flavor instead of the plain mash potato type others serve. The mint chutney and tamarind were also great, though the mint is spicy so be prepared. I got the Vindaloo and my wife went for the Masala. Generally I'm not a fan of Masala, but this wasn't as milky/creamy as others. Tons of flavor and really tasty. The Vindaloo was murder. Just spicy enough to get my sinuses going and full of huge, tender chicken cubes. The rice was served in a huge portion and was fragrant and perfectly cooked.

I'll not be quite that generous, but it's a lovely spot in a surprisingly quiet part of Point Loma with great dishes and decor.My first gripe is that they do not take reservations between 630-830 pm. Really?!? Is this a Michelin star restaurant? Are they flooded with passersby every night for 2 hours straight? Do they resent paying the $1 OpenTable fee so much as to alienate their customers and incite vengeful Yelp critiques???

This snafu almost derailed the evening, but I decided to sally forth like a good Yelper!Luckily, the place was more than half empty when we arrived. We were promptly seated and promptly ordered drinks. Menu is small (this is presumably a good thing for small restaurants). The drink list is surprisingly strong: several wines and beers by the glass (no full bar). Mango lassi was the only authentic drink (you can order it with rum).The food was all excellent/ Chicken tikka masala pizza ($8.5) was cheesy and rich. Not terribly Indian in my opinion. Samosas were decent. Naan was excellent (definitely do the garlic and herb). All of my companions were please with their dishes.The bathroom was immaculate. There was a nice scented candle burning, which you don't see nowadays. My only complaint was the subpar bussing service. My friend's dirty plate sat on the table 30+ min, as did my empty wine glass (from tasting). I'm also inclined to believe the server forgot to order my pizza, as it came out a good 5 min after everyone else's meals.

It's also great that you can ask for utensils through the system.The garlic naan is served in generous portions, so I probably should have only ordered one instead of two. Since each dish comes with rice, it's more than enough carbs already.The chicken vindaloo was my least favorite. It's usually the one I go to right away, but this one was lacking in spice and flavor.

Definitely would come here again especially for the decadent mango lassi!!"], ["Tracey C.", "Amazing complexity of spices and flavors in a casual joint with stellar service. Spicy Ribs stole my husband's heart, \"best ever, bar none!\" Equally compelling: the veggie Vindaloo and Saag Paneer. Garlic Naan rounded out our lively, hearty meal. You know you're experiencing a class act when the Owner sends along a second course of Spicy Rib appetizer plus Pappadum and Chutneys to apologize for \"small delay with the rice cooker.\" Well done Sundara, we will be back!!!"], ["Nicholas G.", "Pretty great indian food!Ok today i decided to goto OB and we choose our destination Restaurant via yelp so I thought it was responsible to leave a good review for this place, wether good or bad.As a brit I love my indian food, believe it or not we eat indian food in the UK more than fish and chips and crumpets :-), so i'm a pretty good judge of good indian food.What can I say it was great, other than Gourmet India downtown which is way way more pricey this is the best i've had in SD, its a shame they don't deliver to PB.The place is pretty small, and from talking to the waitress i hear they get busy at night time so I guess make a reservation if you plan to eat here at night.Long story short, was a good experience, great food and service and would come back, if you add PB to your delivery route would give you an instant 5 :-)"], ["Bridget L.", "Car payment, insurance bill and new books left me with enough money, if I wasn't too extravagant. So when I found this Indian restaurant with an amazing lunch special, I knew this place would be in the regular rotation. \u00a0 By mid-semester, I had shared my discovery with some close friends, so on top of being considered a wise consumer , lunchtime also became a nice break for the ordinary. \u00a0We love the food and the service and are there every Wednesday afternoon, stop by!"], ["Jillian W.", "I loved this place, after moving to Houston I really miss eating here. I wish they would expand and come to Houston."], ["Justin A.", "I came to Sundara the other night after I began to crave Indian. I was a bit disappointed at first, the menu was extremely limited and only contained Masala, \u00a0Vindaloo, Saag, and Tandoori Chicken.After getting over the small menu, the food that we did order here was great. Quality over quantity ! My girlfriend and I split the samosas, chicken vindaloo, and saag paneer. The portions were large and tasted fresh. They did charge for Papadum (most Indian restaurant's don't), but given the relatively inexpensive prices, the $3 dollars wasn't a big deal.Overall, Sundara is a great place. Even though there is a limited menu, each item seems to be cooked with pride. I will be back soon."], ["Rachael C.", "I love the food here and I am not a huge fan of Indian food generally ... not sure what that says, but again the food here is awesome. \u00a0I love the vegetarian options and the fact that they deliver. \u00a0The delivery usually arrives within an hour which is perfect."], ["Ray L.", "My girlfriend and I tried the chicken tikka masala and she said it was too salty but I thought it was OK. Was really disappointing because of all the rave reviews saying how great it was when it's mediocre. At least the chicken wasn't dry for breast meat, that was the biggest plus of the meal. The worst part of the meal was that the rice was stale and tasted very old. We understand that basmati rice can be dry sometimes, but this rice was hard and tasted old; we know rice, since we're asian and eat every kind.The garlic and cilantro naan was burnt on the bottom and tasted like it was baked with garlic powder rather than fresh garlic so that was disappointing as well.The rice pudding was a little heavy on the cinnamon but not bad. The nuts were a pleasant touch to it. The portion was tiny for 4.05 but hey, probably the best dish in the meal... which isn't saying much.We really wanted to like this place but after this poor experience we probably won't be back. In total, it was only $17.30 but for less than that we could've gotten 2 amazing lunch specials at Taste of the Himalayas for less so the price being an excuse for the quality really isn't a valid argument. We feel really misled by the inflating ratings."], ["Suki E.", "Went here STARVING for dinner (and Indian food) about a week ago. \u00a0Overall I really liked the place and will totally go back!!It was a little different than the Indian food I am used to though. \u00a0The bulk of my exposure to Indian cuisine has been in Yuba City, CA...an area that has one of the largest Sikh populations outside India. \u00a0In that area, I can't remember a single dish that I wouldn't eat again and again and again.At Sundara I ordered the Tikki Masala with chicken. \u00a0The chicken pieces were well cooked but the sauce didn't impress me and I wouldn't order it again. \u00a0The Naan (plain) seemed a little less soft than I am used to but still tasty.The samosas were delicious!!!!!!!! \u00a0My friend had the Dal Makhani (vegetarian lentil curry) and I thought it was exceptional as well!!!!The dining areas (one in the front/entrance and one in the back)) are very small...we sat in the back where there was ample air flow...it was comfortable. \u00a0The service was excellent. \u00a0Very attentive and friendly. \u00a0Excited for visit #2!!! \u00a0Saag & Vindaloo are next on my list..."], ["Saad S.", "Their Tikka masala and saag was awesome and their tamarind chutney was fantastic! Can't say the same about their dessert, the rice pudding. It doesn't taste like Indian rice puddings and in my opinion is way too heavy on the cinnamon."], ["Madhav G.", "One of the best indian restaurants we have had so far. I could rate this as the best in USA."], ["Andrew N.", "My friends and I walk here all the time, which is good when we drink a few beers. They only have a few beers on tap, but they are all good. I get the vindaloo and a nan and have enough for lunch at work the next day. My buddies get the tiki Marsala and they like that too.Afterwords I stumble home with at least half my food left (unless I bring Erica and we slit one). So go to sundara, tell your friends, but not too many bc I don't want to wait in line"], ["Hanna G.", "Great Place. Clean food. Simple Menu. Great for first time.The Chef is super cute, you can see her in the small kitchen window working hard with to-go orders flying out the door. She's also white which is pretty cool because she executes the authenticity of Indian very well with her own spin on it. 5 stars because they do VEGAN options. Yes please!Also a nice glass of red wine is perfect with the meal. My boyfriend usually gets a good beer. We aren't even drinkers but for some reason we love cuddling up in a booth, sipping on some grape juice and fermented barley and grubbin. The place is small and I think if you live close to the area its best to get take out. I live in downtown and I'm always in \u00a0a starving mood when I want indian so we always eat there. Not a lot of room, but we've never had to wait. In the summer, the back patio is nice and cool. In the winter they have heaters, but like i said earlier, the booth is where its at.Service is amazing. We've always had a male server and they're great. They deal with our odd vegan requests and always execute properly. They are good at knowing what you need with out bothering you too much.Def worth a try. Reading some of these reviews confuses me because I'm a foodie and all the other indian I've tried was way to heavy and for not being Indian they hit it on the head pretty well."], ["Wanda S.", "My first visit to an Indian restaurant in San Diego was a complete success. After having one of the best dinners at Himalayas in Ventura, I didn't think it could any better...however, I was wrong.The ambiance of this place is cool and romantic. The lighting is dim and the soundtrack is AMAZING. ( 80s / The Cure, The Smiths, etc.) It was a slow night so it felt like my date and I had the restaurant all to ourselves. Customer service was spot on and the food was so goooood.... the only thing keeping this from a perfect rating is the super salty taste of the food...I like salt, but I dont like waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I just walked the Sahara desert. I will probably come back, prices are good, the beach is around the corner, and they deliver! Try it!"]], "Bombay": [], "Gourmet India": [["Sabine M.", "Very good meal. And I have eaten Indian food my entire life including in India and from my in laws. Flavors are good. Had chicken tikka masala, sag paneer, Dahl Makani and chana masala. All were good. The chicken tikka masala was excellent, as well as the sag and the Dahl.We also pester garlic naan and everything formed with Rice.You can eat on the patio.Service is good."], ["Shruti N.", "We ate here on a whim last night and while we enjoyed the meal there were a couple things we would change. First even after asking for our food \"Indian spicy\" it wasn't really all that hot. Second the service was a bit slow and scattered, as others have mentioned. We did ask our waiter to ask the chef to make us some chili naan which isn't on the menu but wow it should be. He really packed that naan with chilis and it was delicious!!! Overall a good meal."], ["Mike P.", "Really deserves a 4.5. All items I tasted were well done. My sole complaint is that I asked for the chicken curry to be spicy and it wasn't. That said, the flavors of the samosas, dal and naan were all excellent. I would order again."], ["Vivian A.", "So so good! We walked by the night before and drooled over the incredible looking food. We came in for dinner tonight and it just happened to be during happy hour, so we decided to splurge. Two naan bruschetta, one panneer appetizer, nirvana chicken (delicious), and vegetable curry (again, delicious). Happy hour drink specials were ridiculous- I got two Bollywood beauties (4 each, and so good I am tempted to order more) and my hubby got a mojito and sangria (4 each). Wonderful service, incredible food, great drinks, and a cool ambience. Highly recommend you coming in!! Plus, it's great for a date or girls night :)"], ["Jerry v.", "We really enjoyed our meal there. We really appreciate all the gluten free options. The tandoori chicken was fantastic and the masala delicious. We're here for a conference and plan on taking our group there again!!"], ["Ray G.", "Excellent restaurant, service and great quality food. Mirna was an amazing hostess as well Divya, attentive, courteous and professional. Great atmosphere!Ray G."], ["Christine M.", "One of the best Indian restaurants in town. The place is small and cozy, right in the heart of the Gaslamp District. The waiter was a delightful guy who brought out the food quickly. The tofu masala was just perfect! I was impressed with the bartha, it had a more natural look than most barthas I've tasted."], ["Judith H.", "I honestly love this place. At first I thought I was not going to get full with the lunch special but half way through it I was full. I was unable to finish the whole thing because my stomach was not letting me. The food is good the price is good. Customer service has always been good."], ["Peter S.", "Gourmet India is a real delight. \u00a0The food is very good (try the Lamb Vindaloo), the portions are more than enough and the service was wonderful - attentive but not overbearing. \u00a0It was my first visit but certainly not my last."], ["Timmy L.", "What a great restaurant! I cam here during the esri user conference 2015. Very friendly wait staff...helpful about whats good and offered recommendations. A plus was i didnt have to wait long for a table. The food was fantastic and flavorful. I had the nirvana chicken curry and tandoori chicken lunch special. Very good price for the food you get!! I'm coming back here again during the conference."], ["Mark S.", "I am grateful to find a good quality place that makes amazing food with love and care. I had a lunch platter with nirvana chicken curry and added a marsala chicken curry for +$2. The garlic naan doesn't get any better.

Food was great, service was great. Definitely coming back soon! If you want some good Indian food, try this place. You won't be disappointed"], ["Alejandro F.", "In my hometown there's no decent indian food within 500 miles so we make it a point to enjoy Indian food on our travels. In San Diego we stumled upon Gourmet India and we are so glad we did! \u00a0The staff were very friendly and attentive. The real star though, was the food! Excellent flavors melded together in perfect harmony.... Highly recommended!"], ["Mitch L.", "Gourmet India is a cozy little joint in the gas lamp district. \u00a0The food is great and the prices are very reasonable, especially given that with a couple of appetizers, one entree is big enough to split between two people. Unlike some of the other restaurants in the area, there's no charge for splitting an entree, either. The staff were friendly and I enjoyed the ambiance. \u00a0I would definitely go back again,"], ["Cherice W.", "Given the sarcasm from the manager/owner , I am dropping this to one star. That lack of care is evident not only in the food but in management of the venue . Just plain tacky.I should've known the place would be crap when I went to an Indian restaurant that had no Indian customers . Smh"], ["Randy H.", "Went back here last night and had a great time. Food was good, service was good. Wonderful dining experience. This is now my go to Indian spot when I'm stuck working downtown."], ["Katherine K.", "We love EVERYTHING about this restaurant! \u00a0My husband is British and not easy to please when it comes to Indian food. \u00a0He was shocked at just how good our meal was. \u00a0The service is perfect and the prices will pleasantly surprise you!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"]]}
