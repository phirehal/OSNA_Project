The veggies weren't as fresh as they usually are in the fresh salad rolls. It's hard to go wrong with sweet rice with mango, but we had to send it back because the rice wasn't cooked all the way, so the rice was a little crispy. So our recent visit to this restaurant was a bit disappointing overall. However I will still give Lanna Thai another chance because we've had good visits previously.

I highly recommend the platter as an appetizer as it comes with like 4 of the things on the appetizer menu and was well worth it.

We walked in and were sat quickly. Water was received and we flipped through the six pages of menu.

Pad thai - soggy, clumpy noodles, not much taste. Spicy noodles - meh. It was okay. Not that spicy, light flavor. For the next fifteen minutes, there was no service to be seen. It wasn't after we both put down our forks because I found something small and rock-hard in my food, like two little street stones. The server comes back with the check without an apologetic manner and tells us how it's not really anyone's fault that those inedible stones (she claims were \"really hard noodles\" that \"could've come from outside\") were in our food. That's not quite how customer service works when you try to make excuses of how it \"isn't your fault\". We sure as hell didn't put that in our food so it must've come from somewhere in the back where the restaurant is reponsible. Anyways, clearly unhappy with our food, the server brings the check without any offer of a discount. I guess for the server, it was okay for our food to be mixed in with street rubble and we were entirely wrong in saying otherwise. It wasn't until my husband asked her this that she offered 10%.

This was my first and last visit. Bf and I came here on a Wednesday night (6/11) for dinner. We arrived ~7:40, saw 2 other couples in the restaurant waiting for their food, we ordered papaya salad, chk pad thai, and eggplant w/ tofu.1. Food came super late - Papaya salad came at 8:20, which is 35 min after we ordered. (I was checking the time because I was in a middle of laundry) \u00a0Eggplant arrived around 8:35, and Pad thai about 5 min after.2. Papaya salad - there was hair in it!!3. Eggplant - very salty, we had to pour all the sauce out.4. Pad Thai - Over fried tofu and driest chicken I ever had (see pic), we ate about half and didn't even bother to bring the rest.5. Service - nada, the only waiter was helping out cooking inside the kitchen 6. Customer service attention** If a customer requested no dried shrimp on a dish (description), it could be due to allergic reaction. When I request no dried shrimp on the pad thai, a waiter should be caution enough to note there are also dried shrimp on the papaya salad (the ones we usually go to do not have dried shrimp on their P.S.). \u00a0We were a little surprise/upset to see the amount of dried shrimp on the P.S. because my bf is allergic to shrimp. He had a small bite because both of us were starving and had up itching the entire night. :(I'm not sure was that day just off or not. There were at least 4 people working in the kitchen (exclude the waiter), during our wait, there was 1 phone-in and 2 walk in togos, one of them I believe was from a delivery company where the driver was walking back and forth checking the status of the food. At the end he spoke pretty loud saying \"The promised delivery time was 8pm, but now is 8:30 and the food still not ready?\""], ["Its Me Y.", "Thai pepper has the best lunch special !Great food, good service.I usually get the hot basil shrimp !with the tom yum soup And its delicious!"], ["Queena L.", "Bestest Thai Evers!

Whenever I'm in the mood for Thai Koon Thai is my first choice. Sometimes the wait is cray but when you're good you're good. It can be difficult to find parking in the lot shared by multiple restaurants and other establishments but that's a common problem with businesses on Convoy. I used to go for the safe stuff like Tom Yum Soup or Pad Thai (which are delicious), but after I tasted the Green Curry the box I was living in was shattered and my tastebuds danced in rejoice. It was soooooooo good. I've already gone back for more like a week later. I'm excited to try the other curry dishes and to get even more adventurous with other traditional Thai dishes. I don't eat meat so I ordered veggie but I'm pretty sure that there was a piece of meat in my vegetable green curry (my stomach seemed to think so at least). This has happened to me at several Thai restaurants though (I don't know why). I'll still go back! New week perhaps?!"], ["Cris L.", "I've come here for their lunch specials and for dinner a few times since it's one of the few convenient places on Convoy that has a big parking lot.The food itself is decent. Nothing mind-blowing, but it's good enough if you're having cravings for Thai food. Can't go wrong with their noodle dishes, and their soups are tasty. The price is very reasonable as well. For all this, I give them 4 stars.However, the service is terrible. We'll be with a crowd of other people, waiting in the lobby to be seated, and we'll see that there are clusters of empty tables not being cleaned to seat new groups of people. Once seated, it wouldn't be uncommon for us to wait forever to get our order in. When the food finally comes, there will be one person missing their dish, and it usually won't until we can flag down a server to check on it. As long as you get past all that and have your food, then it's fine. It's just annoying leading up to finally getting your lunch or dinner, and for that, I dropped it down to 3 stars.I'll come here because it's conveniently located for me, and I'll try to arrive when I'm not starving. Besides that, there are other Thai places with less hassle."], ["Kristina T.", "My second time coming here and I'd have to say their food and service are really good. My friend and I came around 5, so it was right before a dinner rush would come by. They just added in some cute table dividers that have Thai phrases and their meanings on them so people could try learning a little Thai. The decor in the restaurant is also very cute; very modern but still with Asian influences. Our server was very friendly and constantly came by to check up on us after we ordered. I ordered the red curry with chicken medium spicy, and they don't play when it comes to spice. As I kept eating the curry, the spiciness increased but that wasn't a total problem. The curry had a rich flavor and I liked how they put generous amounts of bamboo shoot in it. I loooove bamboo shoots and I can also say they didn't skimp on the chicken either. Overall a really good meal at a really nice place."], ["Gordon D.", "This restaurant is well furnished, and it sets the mood for a dim lit dinner.The past three times I've been here, we've ordered the following dishes:Satay skewersPad see ew with chickenPad kee mao with chicken or porkCrab fried ricethai ice teahouse soupThe noodle dishes weren't special for some reason--maybe it's because it's not spicy enough or that it wasn't flavored enough. The meat additions seemed like the flavors weren't mixed in completely. The crab fried rice was disheartening--crab meat prices are high and the lack of portions reflect that.The thai ice tea and the tangy house soup was delicious, though. The skewers were also delicious.Despite the reviews I've given, I did enjoy the experience there. I'm still on the look out for other Thai places in the meantime!"], ["Amy R.", "I was craving pad thai, so I yelped this place and when we arrived, was very satisfied with the overall ambience. Such a clean restaraunt! I ordered the chicken pad thai in mild. The waitress told me that even their mild is pretty spicy and she was right! Had a slight kick, but was the perfect amount of spicyness."], ["Joanna R.", "I was really excited to try this place as it was recommended to me by a friend, but I walked away a tad disappointed. First off, the service was so-so. We didn't get our waters refilled until we were nearly finished with our meals. (*** In response to management, okay... We are in a drought. Yes. But if water is upon request, your servers should still check on those they are serving and ask if they would like their waters refilled.***)They didn't clear out our empty appetizer plates when the waiters finally did come by. The woman who greeted us and seated us was very friendly, but the staff who served us weren't as inviting. As for the food, it was okay. But I'm sad to report that it was nothing we were too impressed with:My hubby had the seafood padthai and barely had any sea food in it. He got maybe two mussels and 1 small shrimp on top of a mountain of noodles. He said the noodles were pretty tasty, but he couldn't finish it as he didn't have an adequate portion of seafood in it. If we are paying for seafood padthai, you'd think there would be more pieces of seafood in it :-(. I, on the other hand, had a decent portion of chicken for my padthai but the tofu in it tasted old. I really wanted to like this place... I'm thinking maybe I needed to try different entrees to really understand why they have so many raving reviews. So I may be back to update this."], ["Kimberly B.", "I had pad Thai it was good. However I was very uncomfortable because the place was so hot. I ask if they had the AC \u00a0on and one of the workers said they did. The worker said the reason it might be hot was due to having lots of glass windows and black interior. \u00a0I been to places that had the same elements in their restaurant and it was cool. Maybe the AC is broken but it definitely wasn't on."], ["Shawn L.", "Nice Thai food and atmosphere. Their Thai fried rice was delicious and the Pad Thai was spicier than I had expected since we ordered mildout. The taste was great and the spice really kicked in since I thought it wouldn't be. I would definitely stay at a safe mild to low medium for spicyness here. I would come back for their lunch specials too."], ["L T.", "My friend really wanted thai food and he was leaving San Diego soon so we settled on this place. There was no wait really. The place was pretty empty besides our group. We got the tofu stew and the curry with brown rice. The food was good, but it was spectacular like Siam Nara or Sab E Lee. I would come back again, but only because Siam Nara and Sab E Lee are too far from UCSD."], ["Kelli S.", "One of my Taiwanese friends always raves about Koon Thai, thanks to their generous portions, great lunch deals and reasonable prices. I finally went with her to check it out on a rainy Friday for lunch around 12:40 p.m.Tip: Definitely make a reservation for lunch if you go during the week, cause this place is hoppin'! We had a group of 5, and we probably would have been waiting for 10-15 minutes if we didn't have a reservation. My friend suggests going at 11:30 a.m. or so if you do go for lunch (without reservations), so you can beat the typical lunch rush.There's a lot to choose from on the Koon Thai menu, but I decided to go with one of the \"Create Your Own Lunch Entr\u00e9e,\" per my friend's suggestion. The interior of the restaurant is pretty cool, and I especially liked the d\u00e9cor and water glasses. I think the one thing that can definitely be improved is service -- even once my party was seated, it was a good 10 minutes or so before our server came just to ask for drink orders, and we had to flag someone down! They seemed pretty short-staffed -- even once our server came, she didn't come back very often and we always seemed to be hunting for someone to flag down whenever we needed something (more water, extra napkins, our bill, etc.). I'm not sure if slow service is the norm at Koon Thai, but if it is, be sure you plan accordingly if you're going for lunch during the week (I would give them 3.5 stars because of service, but the eatery gets a 4 because of the yummy food).Here's what we ordered, as well as what I would get in the future:\"Create Your Own Lunch Entr\u00e9e\": These lunch entr\u00e9es all come with house salad, and you can choose one of the available meats and pair it with different rice or noodle dishes. During my first visit, I opted for the \"Chicken Pad Thai,\" which came with generous chunks of grilled chicken, stir-fried noodles with eggs, tofu, chives and crushed peanuts (I ordered my Pad Thai sans bean sprouts). The salad was light and I liked the flavor of the dressing, but I didn't finish all my salad so I could enjoy every bite of my Pad Thai. The dish was served piping hot--I could still see the steam coming out--and the crushed peanuts were in a small pile on the side. I liked the fresh taste of the noodles and could easily taste the eggs and tofu. I ordered my Pad Thai mild--I can't handle super spicy food--and the dish had just enough flavor for my liking. Definitely a good traditional dish that I would order again in a heartbeat.\"Pad See ew\": My friend said she usually orders this dish but changes up the meat she chooses. During our visit, she opted for shrimp. This entr\u00e9e consists of flat, stir-fried rice noodles stir with egg and Chinese broccoli in black soy sauce. My friend likes this dish because of the black soy sauce; the noodles came with a good amount of broccoli chunks as well.\"Thai Fried Rice\": If I ordered a different rice dish for the \"Create Your Own Lunch Entr\u00e9e,\" I probably would have gone with this chicken fried rice. The fried rice portion entails Jasmine rice that's stir-fried with garlic, egg, Chinese broccoli, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. Of course, I would modify my order a bit--no tomatoes, onions and cucumbers for me--but everything else in this fried rice medley sounds absolutely delightful. Plus, I like the finer grains of Jasmine rice, so I'm sure I'd love this concoction.\"Garlic and Pepper\": I love the smoky flavor of combined pepper and garlic, so this rice dish sounds like it's right up my alley. I definitely want to try this rice entr\u00e9e one day--it's probably great with chicken or pork--and I'd get it if I'm certain I don't have any other plans for the day (don't want to be smelling like strong garlic!).\"Chicken Satay\": Though we didn't order any appetizers during our visit, this dish sounded yummy. It features marinated chicken in mix of Thai spices on a skewer and comes served with cucumber sauce, peanut sauce and bread toast. I'm not sure what the bread toast tastes like here, but I like peanut sauce so I'm sure I would enjoy this dish. If I ever order an app from Koon Thai, this one's at the top of my must-try list.\"Poo jah\": I love a good crab cake, but I must say, I've never tried a Thai crab cake in my life. This one sounds appetizing, as it features stuffed crab that's dipped in egg batter and fried, and it's served on a spring mix with lime mayo dressing and Sriracha chili sauce. Now, I'm not a huge fan of Sriracha cause I can't handle the spice, but I am curious to try the Thai crab cake itself. I wonder if it has a super strong crab flavor ...\"Wonton Soup\": This soup sounds absolutely perfect for a rainy day and it doesn't encompass too many ingredients, which I like. It features a milk clear broth soup filled with wontons, ground chicken, shrimp and shiitake mushrooms. I love wontons, so I can't wait to try this comfort soup one day."], ["Mandy S.", "Came here a while back after a massage therapist from Thailand said Koon Thai is better than Thai food in Thailand. The interior is clean and warmly decorated, service is good for the most part, and since our first time, we have come here at least once every week. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced, but the dinnertime portions are larger and they set the table with fancy napkins. Here's our top five:Pad Kee Mao - stir-fried flat rice noodles with vegetables and choice of meat. Go-to dish not only for thai food but stir-fry in general . Five out of five.Duck noodle soup - broth of soy sauce and fish sauce with chopped duck. It goes well with both flat and skinny noodles, and on good days you'll get the meaty duck breast (other days you might get bony or fatty parts). Four out of five.Thai fried rice - fried rice seasoned with fish sauce. Good portions, consistently delicious. Four point five out of five.Pumpkin curry - we tried several other curries, and I found most to be too sweet for my taste. However, all the curries are very flavorful. Pumpkin curry isn't on the lunch menu, but it's our new favorite -- the smoothness of the coconut milk doesn't overpower the spiciness, and the pumpkin melts in your mouth. So delicious. Five out of five.Tom yum soup - Adequately sour, just as tom yum soup should be. There's chicken, two different kinds of mushrooms, skinny green herbs, and tomato in the soup, and it's only $1.50 for lunch, although I would pay full price any day. Five out of five, just ask for some limes if you want more sour.We always order no spicy and ask for the hot sauce caddy on the side, that way dishes can be shared with everyone. Spicy-lovers beware, we've been here with friends who underestimated the spiciness and couldn't eat their food at all. We tried appetizers like papaya salad and fried shrimp, they were all just ok. The beer towers are pretty cool. If I were to choose one restaurant to live off on for the rest of my life, this would be among the top choices."], ["Ivonne V.", "Came here for lunch, and they have a special lunch price.

D.", "Go-to Thai food!Favorite dishes:Spicy noodles - Flavor is plentiful, not too greasy. \u00a0I usually get mild and it still has a kick to it.Sweet and sour fish - Fried fish with tangy and sweet sauce containing bell pepper (I've only gotten the fillet but you can get the dish with whole fish). \u00a0I always get this dish but there is one complaint - too much sauce! \u00a0The fish would stay crispier without so much sauce and that much is really not needed because the sauce and fish are both so flavorful.Crab fried rice - \u00a0Not typically a dish I would order but here it is great. \u00a0I can really taste the crab! \u00a0Good balance with the veggies and the rice texture is just right; not too greasy, not soggy.Service is friendly. \u00a0The place is always busy but I've never had to wait. \u00a0Parking lot can be difficult and the spaces small. \u00a0I try to park on the street."], ["Angela F.", "I love my Thai just like I love my men - spicy enough to bite you, but not make you cry. The reason for 3 Stars is two-fold: ordering spicy food is inconsistent. Some waiters will ask \"what number 0-10\". Others ask \" no spicy, medium or hot spicy \". Even still, you never really know what you are going to get. Ordering spicy is like playing Russian roulette, you never know what you'll get. \u00a0Sometimes medium is not spicy at all and other days I can't feel my tongue. But I just take it however they dish it.Typical of Asian establishments, once you order your food you won't see the waiter until it's time for the check. So get everything you might need upfront.I'm ashamed to admit I spend too much of my paycheck on this place because it's close by. The lunch time menu is deal with average cost of $8 for a large enough of a portion to take home leftovers. The red curry is seasoned perfectly. As a soup connoisseur, I've tried them all and they were nothing to brag about.Overall, it's a decent little place with an overcrowded ambiance that I won't make any special trips to on an off-work day."], ["Drew L.", "Prelims: a nice clean little place on Convoy street, the interior is a bit dim, even during a lunch but is still a pleasant place to go kill time and food. The interior is larger than it looks, and the place is definitely a cleaner joint than most Thai restaurants I've been at. Parking is a beast - you'll have a harder time finding parking than finding the lost city of Atlantis; which is totally ironic as there is a massive parking lot! It's just really poorly designed with horribly small spaces that make you feel like you're backing in a semi. Service is quick and fast - food came out a bit slow but it was lunch hour - who gives a rip.I came here with 2 other coworkers after much debating over who wants what and where we were going to go eat. We were originally going to go somewhere else, but the driver (cough, MAX, cough) decided on his own to just drive here, despite our protests that we go elsewhere because he said that he \"heard\" someone say they wanted Thai food. And we all got the lunch special. Because it's cheaper. That's right - I'm a cheapskate. I ordered the Pad Thai - yes, I ordered the most boring and common dish that the entire world orders when they step through the doors of a Thai restaurant. And it tasted like it was meant to tickle the palate of every person around the world: decidedly average - the flavors were all present, with the sweet and sour, the tomato, the peanuts, the chicken, etc. But it was all a bit underscored - like they took the flavor and dialed it backwards. The food tasted like it was supposed to but it wouldn't bust down the doors to my tastebuds. The portions were pretty good-sized through. I had a massive pancake breakfast beforehand and so I ended up eating half of my noodles. It lasted the night and I had it for lunch that next day and it was pretty decently filling so I'm pretty sure most people would be full....scratch that, it's America. You'll probably get full but not enough for a second meal leftover. So all in all, I would eat this if I was pretty hungry and didn't really care too much to be a snob about it, but there are definitely better things on the menu to order. My coworker ordered the Pad See Ew (god I have to spell this again :0 I think it's spelled Phat Si-io). It was again, decidly average - a bit oily, a little on the small side for the amount of chicken, and the flavor was a bit underwhelming. I mean, the flavors were all there - it tasted like what you expected it to taste. But that was the best of it's flavors - just a little bit of average. Now, if I was desperate for PSE and couldn't find it anywhere else, this would definitely hit the craving spot. And if I didn't care about being a snob about Thai food, it's a good place to go. But there are other things on the menu and I feel like this is just a safe option only if you know exactly what you want and expect. My other coworker got the drunken noodles. It ended up being pretty decent; personally I have never gotten drunken noodles before because the idea that my noodles are haphazardly meandering down the street singing old Disney songs at the top of their lungs because they consumed too much alcohol doesn't exactly excite me. On the other hand, I'm a much bigger fan of curry, so I haven't exactly had the urge to try them either. So as the opportunity presented itself, I dug in a bit to see exactly what they taste like. And it tasted like PSE just a bit spicier. I mean, it was as if they used the same ingredients, in the same work, for the same dish, with more pepper. My expectations were low - this hit it exactly on the mark (so success, I guess?) so drunken noodles were something that I would now put on the backburner in my mind whenever I am going to a Thai restaurant. Lunch specials are under $10TL;DR decent location, big servings, average Thai food."], ["Kat H.", "Mmmm. Fancy Thai restaurant next to Cafe Heu, WAFFLES FOR DESSERT. Really nice decor with lights, a cool painting on one side, and tinted wine glasses. I've had the pad thai, pad kee mao, and boat noodles here, and I've loved them all. The boat noodles, and other soup noodles, are really cheap too. They have a huge variety of dishes, not just your typical pad thai and curries. I believe they have my favorite dish, Kha Moo as well which is slow braised bork pelly, but I'll save that for another review if I get to try it.Generally pretty quick service, workers are very friendly, and a solid place to get some Thai food.

The inside decor is nice. Actually, I almost felt a little underdressed in my shorts and flip flops sitting at a table with white table clothes and beautifully folded cloth napkins. The place is fairly small so I can only imagine the wait on a busy Friday night, but we were here at an off time of day (2pm or 3pm, I think?) and on a national holiday so the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately and given time to look over the menu, although Venessa and I are no strangers to eating Thai food together, so we already knew what we wanted! I ordered the yellow curry, as I always do, and brown rice, which I sometimes do when I'm trying to be a bit more healthy! The food came out pretty quickly and my yellow curry was great! It wasn't as creamy as I'm used to it being at other places, but I'm no Thai food expert so who knows who's is more authentic?! I liked it all the same and gobbled it down, no problem. Lastly, the service was great. Sometimes the worst service I receive is in restaurants that aren't currently busy. You know, they are all either talking in the back and you don't get any service at all, or they are all over your table, hovering and taking your plates as you still have that last bite in your mouth. Not here! They were perfectly attentive -- there when we needed them and not there when we didn't. They even helped us make some wine selections and talked us into the Tom Kha soup (not a hard thing to do with Venessa and I!)Even though my favorite (so far) Thai restaurant is just a couple blocks away, I like Taste of Thai enough that I will return.

So I had to ask the waiter to heat up the entire pot! He did and it was perfect.

We knew something was off and I'm glad our waitress regonized it and asked if it was okay (of course it's NOT okay) but we were nice about it because the Tom Yum tasted BETTER than the Tom Kha, it's like They just need to add coconut milk to the Tom Yum and it it will be good!When we received our actual Tom Kha, it was kinda worse. It was more bland and lacked that spice of ginger, so we had our left over soup of Tom Yum and added it to our Tom Kha and THAT was perfect! I feel like it was lacking more ingredients, it's like the cook got lazy and just put 3 ingredients and added water and coconut milk.

They are my barometer for Thai restaurants and are typically the first thing that I order to figure out what else to eat based on their quality. Though simple, they're f#cked up constantly. The good news is that Taste of Thai is doing them right!First things first... the parking blows here. You can cruise the streets in search of an open parking meter but your best bet is to park in the lot out back and they'll validate your parking for you. Just be sure to head inside first, have them give you a parking pass and drop it on your dashboard upon arrival, not departure. Okay, those spring rolls. I think they may call them fresh salad rolls here, but they are not the fried ones, they're the ones rolled in rice paper. You have the choice of shrimp or tofu here and they'll come served with a side of peanut sauce - standard. What makes these ones shine is the crunch when you bite into them. The veggies are fresh, aromatic and the rolls are most likely made to order. Stir some Sriracha into the peanut sauce and dip away...So why four rather than five stars? They're small and they're pricey.

They have a menu in which you as a customer can refine yourself. My girlfriend loves their pineapple fried rice with chinese sausage and honestly it is the best I have tasted. Only reason this restaurant is lacking in the stars department is their overly sized cuts of vegetables. Tum Yum Soup - The flavors are almost there, however the broth was over-ly sour. The large chunks of half cooked onion did not have time to sweeten the broth and balance the flavors. Almost maybe only had 2-3 pieces of shrimp inside the entire soup The green peppers added was unusual but did not do harm besides being too large.Pineapple fried rice w/ chinese sausage - The flavors inside that dish was delicious. The sweet flavor from the pineapple was not overpowering and the saltiness from the chinese sausage gave a great balance to the meal. However, the same problem remains in all their dishes.

Probably will not be returning."], ["Marlene A.", "Used to go here all the time when I lived in North Park. Under construction last time I visited. Now only for take-out which is a bummer but well worth it. Drunken Noddles and salad are da best!"], ["Aleck L.", "My friend and I came here on a Thursday night and it wasn't crowded at all. It had its own parking lot, which is nice because parking can be a pain in north park. I ordered the spicy noodle with mock duck, which was decent. The mock duck was great, but the noodles were only okay. We also had the angel wing appetizer, which was tasty! And it looks way bigger than the picture in the menu. The portions are great for the price. I'd come back again!"], ["Grace C.", "Pork larb, spicy noodle, pad thai, mango sticky rice and thai ice tea - the regular dishes that comprises our dinner when we dine at Bangkok. The friendly, fast, efficient staff also makes for a great dining experience.Pork larb is sooooo flavorful and spicy and is great in contrast with the lettuce wraps and cucumbers they give you to eat with. I love their Thai ice tea - not to sweet, even though it's a little heavy on the condensed milk for me. Spicy noodle is spicy and is loaded with your choice of meats. As for the mango sticky rice....I could come here and eat just that. The rice is the perfect blend of warm and sweetness and the mango is soft and juicy. Obviously the mangos taste better when the fruit is in season, so...grain of salt! Generally speaking, portions are very generous and they don't skimp on quality. I've come back here several times, and will continue to dine here. Great service, great food, and great prices."], ["Alisha S.", "Please go back to dine-in service again! I miss sitting in what was clearly a gutted pizza hut, sucking down the best tom kha in town, and enjoying any number of their noodle dishes. For now, I'll have to eat it at home, or in my car if delicious smells overtake me."], ["Ray V.", "Sorry Folks...Bangkok Spices is no longer open for sit down dining. The good news is they're still open for business, but only take out."], ["Jackey N.", "Took one of my best friends to have lunch here for our first time. I'm giving this place 4 stars because for one, as we walked in we were not greeted til about 10 mins later....where is everybody? There was only one other group of people eating away besides us. We were then seated and given menus. Our waitress came and served us water then asked if we were ready, but we were not. It was my friend's first time so I had to explain the menu to her for she was confused. The waitress came back again and asked if we ready. So we felt a little rushed. But we did end up ordering after she came back the 3rd time. I liked that she gave my friend a sample of the Thai ice tea before she decided whether or not she wanted to order it, since she never had it. She loved it!My friend ended up ordering the pad see eiw for her first time. She couldn't decide between noodles or rice, but she knew she wanted a lot of veggies, so I told her pad see eiw. I ended up ordering a bowl photak soup w/ a spice of 9 and papaya salad with a spice of 9. When the food came I ended up ordering a bowl of jasmine rice to go with my order. My friend ended up taking half of my rice and putting it w/ her noodles! LOL! Food was delicious! Soup was not spicy enough for me but the papaya salad was perfect!So why not a perfect 5? Well, for having to wait as we walked in, and for being rushed to order.But we'll be back to try other stuff on the menu!"], ["Christina T.", "Every now and then, I have a craving for Thai food, and it haunts me until I am satisfied.Sure, the parking sucks and the building looks a bit out of place. However, this a definitely diamond in the rough.The menu is abundant with many authentic Thai dishes to suit any taste preference. A large serving of papaya salad (spice level 5 burns!!!) with PLENTY of shrimp?! Don't mind if I do! I always have trouble finishing the large portion of spicy drunken noodles (pad kee mao) because I always get them too spicy (oh but it's sooooo good) with ingredients abundant. They give you so much shrimp in seafood dishes!! I've only ever had their yellow curry, but it's quite tasty. The Thai tea isn't as sweet as other places - it tasted more like tea, which I prefer. They have the perfect ratio of milk, tea, and sugar/cream.Great service and I like the booth seating. Pricing is perfect, as most dishes, even with shrimp, are under $10 and enough to share. Now if only they could open a location near La Jolla *wink wink*"], ["Macey M.", "My group got Red Curry, yellow curry, Spock noodles, and Angel wings. Incase you were looking for good suggestions. Food on 1-10 1 being garbage 10 being amazingly perfect I give a 9 however the service was a 7. Don't get me wrong the waitress was super nice but the problem was there was only one.. Granted it was after New Years so I'm sure everyone called in sick.. They had amazing curries Red and Yellow were creamy and full of spice both equally great! And the appetizer Angel wings was.. *muaw* .... Well I went to heaven hence the name..hahaha great restaurant highly recommend"], ["Sabrina K.", "Been eating here since they opened. \u00a0 \u00a0It's located in the strip mall next to where I work so it's a super close lunch option.I usually get the yellow curry add extra veggie with brown rice. \u00a0It is a pretty consistent item as far as flavor profile goes. \u00a0There are a couple items that seem to change depending on who is cooking (the Larb Chicken and the Yum Woon Sen noodle Salad). \u00a0Sometimes they are over spiced and sometimes under spiced. \u00a0I always order Spicy #6, but I've had it come totally mild or totally flaming hot! Another item that is pretty consistent is a chicken noodle soup... kinda their version of Pho, \u00a0I don't think it's actually on the menu but there aren't any Pho places around, so they make this for a lot of my coworkers. \u00a0It is a little oily, but regardless, I'm always satisfied after I eat it."], ["Cecily H.", "Order spicy garlic fish and Bangkok spicy chicken it was made to perfection my new fav. Thai place - I highly recommended. \u00a0However call you food if you don't want to wait either way you can only order to go. Don't let that stop you from going the food is great!!"], ["Carlos P.", "Excellent. Consistently good spot. Tom Kha and beef salad are always on point. Very popular place for to go orders. Everyone is very good at customer service. Unlike most Thai spots in the area, parking here is easy because they have their own parking lot...that my fellow yelpers is called...\"winning\"."], ["TianChee S.", "I need to be honest, I don't understand why Thai places are so stingy with the amount of duck served. This is another restaurant that charges a premium and cheaps out on duck meat. I mean I was basically just served duck fat and skin. If that's what you are going to serve then list it like that. Had I known I would get little to no actual duck meat I would have never ordered.Note to self, don't order duck at any Thai restaurant. Seems rather consistent with most Thai places here. Only few exceptions I would go again and order a duck dish but sadly this is not one of them.I tried my other friends' dishes which were decent. Beef Pad See Eww was good. Their Jungle Curry was pretty good. Would consider ordering that next time. Their Pad Thai was very mediocre. Was not really impressed with it at all. This place didn't leave too good of a lasting impression. I would not proactively come back here for my Thai cravings. It's worth a try I guess."], ["Angie V.", "We found a new restaurant. Absolutely delicious.Great service. \u00a0Easy parking. Spicy the better. Very reasonable."], ["Brian C.", "Top notch service and food right here in our hood !!! Spicy Noodle level #3 with Chicken was the BOMB. (That's good.) \u00a0I tried the duck for first time ( a taste of someone else's entree ) and it was perfectly cooked and tender. ) \u00a0Super friendly servers. GO. NOW !!!"], ["Eric C.", "My first time here this place is the bomb!! \u00a0This place has the curry spices that will make you happy!! I'll be on there's so many people here waiting for tables and they bring the food out piping hot and absolutely delicious!! \u00a0You could do substitutions that help you create your epic meal!! Bad part it is walking distance!! I will be able to come again and again!Love this place!! Cheers!"], ["Vicki W.", "The pad se ew was really tasty. \u00a0The meat seemed good- not too fatty and it had really good flavors. \u00a0I also had the spring roll starter and it was good. \u00a0There weren't too many people in the place when I went but it was 2pm so maybe the lunch rush was over."], ["James S.", "I have tried a lot of different Thai restaurants but this is my all time favorite. It has been a staple of my life for the past four years. I always get a noodle dish, a chicken curry dish, and either soup or an appetizer. The food here is amazing and the prices are great. I would never think twice about going to another Thai restaurant in the Hillcrest/Northpark area.Edit: Disappointed that it is only takeout now."], ["Laurel T.", "Yum! \u00a0This place exceeded my expectations. \u00a0Their tom kha is really yummy and the service is warm and friendly. \u00a0The portions are large - I shared the drunken noodles with \u00a0my sister and they were delicious. The place is cozy and welcoming and there is a parking lot provided. \u00a0They have a very large menu and I look forward to trying more of their offerings."]], "J&T Thai Street Food": []}
