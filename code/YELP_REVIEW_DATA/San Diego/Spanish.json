(The only reason it even peaked our interest is because of this awesome movie called 'Chef' on Netflix -- definitely a must watch btw!) They had a huge banner right above their menu that said \"TOP 100 PLACES TO EAT IN THE U.S. IN 2015\" so my expectations were pretty high already. We ordered at the counter and were told that we could take a seat and they would bring the order to our table. My bf got the pollo grill plancha (chicken) and made it a combo with the canasta de papas whereas I got the original cubano with pulled pork. BOTH WERE BOMB.. Although I didn't get a chance to taste his sandwich because he scarfed it down before I could even finish my first half :TI enjoyed dipping my piping hot, crunchy cubano into the garlic aioli and curry sauce (that came with the fries) and it tasted even BOMB-er. We were also able to get the super crispy and FREE plantain chips during our meal too. Service was great considering they had a full house and only 2 servers + one busser (in training) on the floor.

My fianc\u00e9 said he might've liked a little bit more pickles on it, but I thought it was great. The Boricua is slow roasted pulled post, Puerto Rican style pink beans and yellow rice, with Caribbean BBQ sauce and cilantro. \u00a0I thought the BBQ sauce was a little too sweet for me, but still very good.

On Mondays they have an awesome special for the cuban sandwich, fries and a drink for 9 bucks i believe. Cant wait to go back and try more food from their menu!

Chicken and waffles that came with pesto sauce, syrup, and potato salad were tasty but could've used an extra minute of cooking on the chicken for crispiness.

It doesn't matter. Also don't eat the food here, just get the bottomless mimosas if you have a deal.My husband and I ventured to Viva because of a Travelzoo coupon. It was a good deal and we had never heard of Viva serving brunch so we thought we could check it out. Well from the moment we checked in with the hostess everything went downhill.We were greeted by the hostess and told her we had a reservation. She doesn't check anything (there's no computer) and says ok she will find a table. After walking through the restaurant and coming back to the hostess stand, she approaches ANOTHER couple and asks if they have a reservation. They say yes and she walks them over to a table. My husband and I stood there in shock. What just happened?! After she seats the other couple she then looks at me and asks if I have a reservation. I thought we had already covered that. YES WE DO. There was no line of people. It was just us. Nothing could excuse that goldfish 5 second memory. She ditches us at the first seat she could see (one right behind the hostess stand outside).On to the food. Ordered the short rib benny. Waaaay undercooked eggs! There was more raw egg than cooked egg. Because of that the bread underneath was a soggy mess. The sauce was probably something chipotle since it was tinted orange, but it lacked flavor whatsoever. It was a raw creamy mess. The only thing I ate was the actual short rib itself as it was the only safe thing. Husband got some sort of chocolate pancake. Not worth the $.As for the bottomless mimosas, all the tables around us and inside the restaurant received a little carafe of OJ and a bottle of champagne. It looked great so we decided to go with it. Unfortunately, our server brings out a pre-mixed mimosa carafe. It was definitely more OJ than champagne. Why would be treated different from all the other tables in our section? Or in the restaurant for that matter? I was visibly upset. After the seating fiasco and the mimosa carafe, I definitely felt that they were discriminating against us for some reason. My husband flags down another waiter and asks if we can be treated like everyone else and pour our own mimosas. She apologizes and brings out a bottle. Her explanation is that when the waiter wants to make less trips to a table she brings out a premade mimosa carafe. Makes sense, it would take forever to drink all that OJ.All in all, they definitely have a lot of kinks to work out. The front of house needs a LOT of work and perhaps a revamp on procedures. Some waiters may benefit from more training as well. Thanks Travelzoo. We now know we do not like nor will we ever return to Viva!"], ["Tyler F.", "Decent place to come and have a drink.

There's outdoor seating or you can sit inside where the music is a little too loud. Anyway, \u00a0we had a reservation for 11:15AM we were seated inside since there were no available tables outside. The inside is fairly large and there are few tables that can hold big groups, there's also the bar and its four tvs each showing a different sport. By the way, there's a free chips and salsa upon check in but it's only available during dinner (boo, the check in thing doesn't say that).Ok onto the food: they have a decent brunch selection: there's omelets, sandwiches and sweets such as pancakes. I opted for the fried chicken torta with fries. I thought this was delicious actually I loved the crispness of the chicken, though I wish it had more aioli. My boyfriend \u00a0got the carnitas with eggs dish. \u00a0This dish came with potatoes, eggs, beans, carnitas and a green sauce which he said tasty a little sour. Though all in all he liked the dish. His one complaint was the portion was small. I didn't have the same problem, I thought the portion was just right.We did get the bottomless mimosas, but it didn't feel bottomless. First they give you the juice and champagne bottle, then they gave us a small carafe of champagne and lastly they gave us a premixed carafe. Boo. I remember in NYC bottomless mimosas meant they just kept pouring the champagne in your glass, no questions asked. But hey, every place is different, I get it.I probably wouldn't come \u00a0back here not only because of the skimpy bottomless mimosas, but also because this place is pricey without the coupon.

It was calling my name! Since it was just a party of me, I opted to eat at the bar, and that was actually a great choice. The female bartender hooked me up with an AMAZING bloody mary chock full of celery, olives, and lots of lime. The manager came by often to check on me and to chat so I wouldn't feel so alone up there. The bloody mary could have been a meal in itself. It was absolutely delicious! If they threw some maple bacon in there, I would have had three of those as my breakfast! The short rib Eggs Benedict was all that I hoped for and more. The short ribs were tender, seasoned well, and melt-in-your-mouth tasty! The eggs were poached perfectly. The seasoned potatoes came with a spicy chipotle ketchup, and I had a little fruit cup on the side to round out my meal. (Gotta love California!) I love that they offered me 3 types of hot sauce to choose from. How awesome is that?! The food itself would have warranted a 5-star review, but the service was just over the top amazing. It was so good, I came back a couple more times with some friends I made at Comic Con just for drinks and apps. Same fantastic service with a different staff.

Another coworker asked for a veggie omelette with egg whites and the waiter replied, \"So...you want egg whites instead?\" and then, when he delivered the food, he said it was a chorizo omelette (luckily, it wasn't). All 3 of us asked for coffee, but there were no spoons and we had to stir our cream in with our knives. The last straw was probably when my coworker asked for butter for her pancakes and 10 minutes later received a little cup of MELTED BUTTER.

Fortunately the \"Deliful\" Sandwich came with a side greek salad which we used on the chicken club to zest it up. The strangely named deliful had bison, pastrami, turkey and bacon. The only thing about this sandwich that I didn't care for was the malted brown bread....very dry. But the other flavors all worked well together.

This restaurant is lodged in the middle of the famous and beautiful (and famously beautiful) Balboa Park. When renewing my Explorer Park membership, The Prado gave my family a $20 gift certificate. I decided now was the time. First things first, this place is popular. Make reservations (and ask for patio seating). Arrive early to find parking. Enjoy the walk from your car to the middle of Balboa Park. My server was extremely friendly! She shared recommendations and joked with us. Sometimes this is not the case at a tourist location. I was pleasantly surprised! We had a seat on the patio which gave us a view of the Japanese Friendship Garden. I started with a Caipirinha: a Brazilian drink made with cacha\u00e7a, sugar, and lime (heavy on the cacha\u00e7a ;) This drink is a refreshing change from a margarita on a hot day. The wedge salad was great with bacon, tomatoes, and blue cheese. I would have taken a picture of the beautiful presentation but I gobbled it down before I realized I forgot. For my main meal I had the kobe beef sushi, which came highly recommended on Yelp. It was an interesting take on sushi. I am glad I tried it, but I think I would go for something else next time. I also tried the kobe beef burger with gorgonzola. That was GOOD. The cheese took this burger to the next level. The burger was paired with fries and baked beans.

Super cute and romantic! My birthday happened to fall on a Tuesday, which coincided with their date night special. Two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40! Seriously, what a steal. Everyone should come here to take advantage of this deal. The food is INCREDIBLE! I took a look at the menu and immediately knew I'd be ordering the paella. I studied abroad in Madrid and am always craving a Spanish fix. The paella was one of the best I've had in San Diego despite trying many traditional Spanish restaurants around town. The rice was cooked soft, which I like and it was packed with all sorts of seafood and meat!! So delicious and filling. The BF got the short ribs and they melted in your mouth. They came with tasty sour cream and chives mashed potatoes that were equally perfect! Everything about this place was perfect. I would also like to shout out the amazing staff. Our waitress was so attentive and fun! She was really considerate and caring the entire tonight and I really appreciated that. No doubt in my mind that I'll be back!"], ["Andrew N.", "The Tuesday night date night deal is really good because you get a bottle of wine and two entrees for $40. The paella is really yummy.

Service felt rushed in the beginning, slow while waiting for our food, and it took a unusually long time to check out because the card machine wasn't working/the employee couldn't figure out how to work it. Not good when needing to eat and board a plane. The employee also spilled water all over the floor by us when refilling our water and never cleaned it up.3. The food was mediocre. My husbands Cobb salad looked like it was placed in a food processor before service. it was crazy chopped! The ingredients were not of a high quality and definitely not gourmet. The salad was not dressed and he had to ask for dressing on the side. My Texas burger was so jam packed of different flavors it was confusing. The mustard overpowered everything else including the crunchy onions and beef. The cheese was lacking, and there was way too much bacon.

I am going to set things straight for y'all!Urban Crave is a watering hole in the San Diego Airport that also sells food. In order to eat at Urban Crave you must pass security which means you are traveling. So this is not a destination for mouthwatering delicacies. Who goes to the airport for fine dining? This is a place to imbibe before a flight. \u00a0They sell beer, wine, cocktails and virgin drinks. I had a bloody mary which was prepared with a spicy mix and I could \u00a0really taste the horseradish and Worcestershire sauce. IMHO it was a delicious drink. At first glance it looked great too, however the celery was tough and hard to eat and the pickle had seen better days. My advice, don't eat the pickle. I did enjoy the salty olive.The draft beers are big and cold, but what really makes this place special is the happy people traveling. Before our flight to Cabo we sat at a large group table and met all kinds of fun people. It was like a boozy get to know you party of everyone on our flight. \u00a0Seriously folks, half of the flight full of people were partaking at Urban Crave. \u00a0I am even planning a day with one of the friends that I met.Come to Urban crave to get an attitude adjustment, and meet cool people.

It was delicious! The airport used to have such microwaved crappy food... but thank the travel gods for the fresh cracked eggs, quality generous bacon and cheese on a soft rill: It totally sustained me past lunch on a lob travel day. The service was casual, nice and prompt. I needed my order to go and they were fairly quick about it and packed it in a wrapping that kept it warm for about 15 minutes till I could settle in and eat it at the gate. I only docked a star because it was a little dirty behind the counter, could have use some wiping down and a good sweep.

My only thing is that wedge salad is traditionally with Bleu Cheese dressing this came with Ranch and Bleu cheese crumbles on a tin plate. \u00a0Wasn't a fan. I did ask for Bleu cheese dressing Vilma said they don't carry Bleu cheese dressing but could bring me more crumbles and ranch dressing. \u00a0I said ok since she was sweet about it. \u00a0I thought for sure for an airport restaurant I would see an up charge for the extra toppings. \u00a0I was prepared to pay and wasn't even bothered that she didn't mention an up charge. \u00a0 To my surprise there was no need to mention an up charge because there was none.

I thought $6 bites wasn't that great of a deal and that there wasn't a ton of options.I was wrong.Caprese Salad ($6): Really good and a large portion. It was perfectly made and I could not believe how large it was for the price. They also have a little pile of greens to add to your meal which really hit the spot. Fontina Bread Pudding ($6): Really yummy. I liked the take on bread pudding and trying a savory version. I really liked it a lot, but one could tell this was not a diet food! Wow, really cheesy flavor without being greasy and a tasty aioli. I wished for more greens on the plate but really it wasn't a huge factor.Wine: Red Sangria came in a really cute fashion with mint and cinnamon stick. The other wine was good but I am a lightweight so it gets foggier.As some time wore on the place got crowded and lively. It made the service super slow and it took a long time to get the check but our waiter brought us a little Sangria on the house for our trouble so I can't get too huffy about it. The one thing I didn't like was that the 20% tip was already added. I actually would have tipped him more for being so nice and also I like to round up from what the cost of the meal is and then add 20%. I just found it really weird for a party of two to add in a gratuity. I wonder if they do that all the time, or if it was just a really busy night and because the service really fell off in the end he might have been afraid I wouldn't have tipped correctly? Parties of 5+ I understand but I like to give my tips the way I want to.
