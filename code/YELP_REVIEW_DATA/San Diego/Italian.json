Despite how busy they were. We started off by ordering a bottle of wine- we were undecided between Chianti and Sangiovese our waitress was kind enough to let us try both. We went with their Chianti. The service remained on point throughout the night. Even though our dinner came out before the wine their acknowledgment for the delay and apologies before I could say something was great. \u00a0I decided to order the Tagliatelle with the white cheese sauce (Almati) and added prosciutto. The pasta had a great texture- but the sauce was a little on the saltier side for my taste. \u00a0I still managed to finish everything on my plate :) so no major complaints. \u00a0My bf had the pappardelle with the Bencotto sauce. \u00a0One of us usually picks the better dish and he definitely did this time. It was delicious! Bf was feeling extra greedy and ordered the 3 cannoli dessert- which consisted of a pistachio, chocolate and a mocha one. I'm not huge on the sweets but the mocha one was the tastiest of the three. \u00a0Bencotto is a solid choice in Little Italy mainly due to their service. \u00a0When the staff is able to keep their cool and cordialness despite the fact of being swamped- they earn all the stars in my book :)"], ["Brittany L.", "SQUID INK PASTA!! And free bread.PARKING: It's little italy so expect to circle a few times before finding any spaces. \u00a0I think they do offer valet but when we went, there was a festival going on so they didnt offer valet that day.WAIT: We made reservations but even then on a Saturday around 12:45pm there wasn't a wait and plenty of open tables.ATMOSPHERE: Trendy, modern interior with black chairs. \u00a0There's a bar, an upstairs that overlooks the dining area and overall glass exterior to see outside. Perfect for a date or nice but still casual dinner. \u00a0I could see it getting fancier at night.FOOD: You can do the choose your own pasta where you choose a pasta and then a sauce and they make it for you. \u00a0Or, you can order from their specials menu which changes. \u00a0They make their pastas fresh daily and if you get the fusilli or gemelli it's super al dente and PERFECT tasting.They give you free bread, it's not the BEST (not warm and not that crusty) but still decent with the olive oil and balsamic.I opted for the squid ink fettucini (which is not an option for the build your own pasta) but instead of the spicy shrimp sauce I got the pink pancetta sauce.The pasta wasn't as chewy as I was hoping but it did taste fresh. \u00a0It's black and flat/thick. \u00a0Dont let the squid ink scare you away, it doesn't taste fishy or weird at all. \u00a0The sauce was AMAZING though. \u00a0I think the pancetta was almost ground up and spread out so it was super tasty, the sauce isn't heavy and they don't put on a ton so it just lightly flavors the pasta. \u00a0Super good.Overall, definitely would recommend this for pasta. \u00a0It is a little pricey though so be aware of that before going."], ["Jennifer S.", "I came here for lunch with two work friends and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. \u00a0We snagged a great table on the patio during an absolutely beautiful San Diego afternoon. \u00a0I opted for the make your own pasta with penne, meatballs and a pink sauce - it was so ridiculously good and I wish I could have brought the rest of it home with me. \u00a0The service was so attentive and made sure we had a great experience...definitely a place worth trying out!"], ["Nina S.", "Squid ink pasta - there was a good amount of shrimp. The shrimp was juicy and tender. The sauce was really good too. It was pretty flavorful. The squid ink pasta was cooked well. The first time I've tried squid ink pasta was a few years ago in Hollywood. So I've been searching for a good squid ink pasta with pink sauce in San Diego and finally, I've found it (credits to my friend for telling me about it! :))! Most of the places I've tried in San Diego has squid ink pasta was in white creamy sauce. Their Salmonella sauce is so good and creamy. I highly recommend this sauce, especially if you make your own pasta. It's very flavorful and comes with salmon chunks/bits. We selected ravioli only because husband wanted it, which did overpower the sauce. Will try a regular pasta next time. Both dishes were so heavenly! The complementary bread was really fluffy. We usually don't go for more bread but we did. We left pretty happy :)"], ["Trucy H.", "Okay so everyone is right! The food here is amazing! I had what everyone raved about. The gnocchi neri (squid ink pasta with shrimp in a lobster bisque sauce.) My friends ordered different pasta dishes and every single one was so good!!The gnocchi neri dish could be shared because pasta can be quite fulfilling. The sauce was a generous amount so you can also dip the bread with the pasta..yum!! The alcoholic drinks are pretty strong. We also shared a cheese platter. Interesting and delectable, must try too with the bread.Our servers were so attentive, always had our water filled and cleared the table of any empty small plates. Good job team 5 star review for this restaurant!"], ["Eric C.", "Located in the center of Little Italy in San Diego, Bencotto Italian Kitchen truly is a gastronomic heaven for those who are insatiably addicted to pasta, such as my husband. Knowing we'd be spending a weekend in San Diego, I did my research and found Bencotto Italian Kitchen through various food blogs and reviews. And when I learned their pasta is freshly made in house and the menu allows customization, I was immediately hooked.Getting a table here was surprisingly easy (for a Saturday lunch, might I add,) if you appreciate the art of reservations. And though we arrived earlier than our reservation time, the hostess was more than happy to seat us. The restaurant itself is very industrial-modern, it features a bar, high ceiling, and also a second floor seating area (which unfortunately only opens for dinner.) Upon being seated at our table, our server Danny showed up promptly and explained their daily specials as well as answered our questions regarding their menu patiently. Here's what we opted for:- Ravioli di Margo: Large ravioli made with egg and semolina flour. Filled with spinach, ricotta, and parmesan cheese. And the marinara sauce was so rich and condensed, very different than the watery marinara sauce that I usually encountered at other Italian restaurants. - Tagliatelle al Nero di Seppia: It's official, this is the best squid ink pasta that I had ever tried! This hand cut black squid ink fettuccine goodness was served in a spicy vodka sauce with shrimp. The squid ink was not overpowering, fishy nor salty. The shrimp and the sauce were fresh, so I would highly recommend this dish!- Semifreddo al Pistacchio: Pistachios half-frozen mousse, served with hazelnuts and sour black cherry sauce. Please don't be fooled by the size of this baby, the sheer creaminess and the density of the mousse can easily fulfill your sweet craving.Personally, I do not agree with yelpers that gave a restaurant low-rating simply because one to do appreciate the concept of making reservations and ended up have to wait. All and all, my husband and I fairly enjoyed our time at Bencotto. The service and the food were excellent, so, I'm giving them a solid 4-star."], ["Diana T.", "Ever since management sent me a free gift card to come back and give them a second chance after my first bad experience I had hoped of giving it another try. I really wanted to give you another chance but no haps. Walked up at 10 minutes to 7pm on a Saturday and was politely told that the soonest seating was at 9 pm for 3 ppl. Really? Note to everyone wanting to eat here, apparently reservations are a must, unless you plan to eat at closing. I think it's time to toss the free gift card. Sorry to the management but I gave it an honest attempt. This was the last straw. It should be noted that restaurants across the street were immediately accommodating. ;)"], ["Willie P.", "This is my 2nd time coming here. This time it was a double date and we introduced our friends to this place. The service is very good and the food here is amazing. Let's start off with the Tagliatelle Salmone. This pasta is very simple, yet tasty and delicious in which they don't skimp you with the salmon. Next is the Tagliatelle al Nero di Seppia which is hand cut black squid-ink fettuccine in a spicy pink shrimp sauce. It has a good spicy kick to it and a good amount to shrimp to accommodate the pasta. Next time I come here I want to try the Gnocchi squid ink. Next was the Stinco di Agnello which is lamb with mash potatoes. I'm not a big fan of lamb and it's taste but this I can actually tolerate. Add a bottle of wine with any of these and you're good to go. Oh, did I forget that there's unlimited bread? Perfect with your wine while you wait for your meal.The ambiance is quite fancy. Good for especially taking someone out on a date. I recommend calling in for reservations.

It's on the create your own pasta. It is divine! I also tried the meatball appetizer and it was ok. Service was great. Our server was very attentive and remembered the little details.

There's a reason for everything! \u00a0This was just a short walk away and had shaded outdoor seating and was nice and cool inside. It turned out to be an excellent choice."], ["Vanty D.", "Came here with my husband and my in laws for a celebratory post wedding dinner. I got the pumpkin ravioli and it was rich but delicious. A good amount of ravioli was dished. The service was excellent. Location made it very difficult to find parking and the menu was slightly on the pricier side. Was too full to try dessert but some of the dishes looked promising. Will definietky come back to try a few other items that stood out on the menu."], ["Lawrence C.", "I must say that this restaurant is excellent. I had a reservation for 4 at 6PM on Sunday and we were seated at 6PM as promised, even while they were busy, so already a good start. We sat in the upstairs area, which was very nice, with no distractions from outside or any hustle and bustle from kitchen and staff. We were seated next to a table where they sliced bread right in front of us, and replenished our bread quickly, since we were right next to it. The guy even notified us of the bread fresh from the oven, so we got that as well.The menu is a little pricey, but deserves to be. The pasta is hand made and very fresh. They also prepare their ingredients each day, so the menu is designed specifically to be not too complex, yet customizable with the pasta selection and options. The special menu is where it's at! The squid ink taglietelle is amazing, perfect if you enjoy seafood.Finally, the desserts. The panna cotta had a great citrusy flavor to it that was enjoyable.

The fresh pasta and the lamb sauce was like heaven in my mouth. My date had the Tagliatelle with spicy red sauce and grilled chicken and she really enjoyed it.The drinks we had from the bar was delicious too. I will be back and I highly recommend if you are in the mood for some Italian food, you have to come here.

Before then, my idea of pasta was that restaurants made pasta the way I made pasta, opening a bag of that pre-packaged stuff you buy at grocery stores. Poor ignorant girl, I am. It's amazing how something so simple as combining flour, eggs, and salt, served fresh could make such a difference. When planning my trip to San Diego, I went on the search for a place that would promise a great pasta experience. I've been training for a marathon, as anyone who diligently trains for a race would know, you're eating healthy for a while with a limited amount of not-so-fun carbs. The idea of smelling garlic, marinara sauce, and dinner bread at an amazing Italian restaurant got me very excited. Bencotto. Bookmarked. Looked at the Yelp pictures. Drooled. Found their Instagram page. Drooled some more. Made the reservations. Drooling commenced until we arrived.Fellow Yelpers Terri R. and Mel C. joined my other half and I for my race weekend feast. They are known for squid ink pasta and gnocchi, so it was hard to pass that up, even though their regular menu had so many options to choose from. Pasta made fresh in-house daily. That includes their ravioli, gnocchi, fusilli, penne, tagliatelle and pappardelle, which are like fettuccine. I love their \"pasta your way\" option, where you create your dish with your choice of noodles and sauce. From their own Bencotto pink pancetta sauce to the traditional pesto, bolognese, and arrabbiata, you have endless options of making that perfect plate just for you. How excited was I about this place? I ate here twice in two days. I RARELY repeat a visit, especially when I'm visiting a city as San Diego and there's so many great restaurants to try. But I had to go back. Squid-ink gnocchi with shrimp and lobster sauce was my pick the first night. I actually think it got better with each bite. The next night, I tried their Tagiatelle hand-cut noodles with the Summer sauce, which was simply EVOO, garlic, fresh tomatoes, and basil. What is it about the chew and wonderful texture of fresh pasta? So comforting and so delicious. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We had reservations for both nights. It took a while to get seated the first night, but I appreciated them keeping us updated and apologizing for the wait. When the hostess lead us in, we got the best upstairs table next to the balcony. Sweet! \u00a0The following night, we got a great seat outside to enjoy the great weather. One night was hectic, the next night was mellow. It showed how great the service was when it doesn't seem to matter how busy the restaurant was, the food service was impeccable and the staff had time to chat with us both nights. TIP: Make reservations, especially on the weekends. Bencotto, thank you for making my San Diego Italian dinner(s) so memorable. I will be back!"], ["Missy B.", "I'm a sucker for Italian food. I'll eat it anytime, anywhere, all day, every day. The problem is, I know how cheap it is to make at home so it feels like such a rip-off getting it in a restaurant and paying astronomical prices. At Bencotto though, I don't think I could really replicate any menu item they offer, no matter how simple it may seem! So forking out the extra cash is worth it.Is it the cheapest? Absolutely not. But it's a classy date night spot and really stands out in the sea of Italian restaurants in Little Italy, so it's worth it. Also, the service is always great. The attentiveness level is always spot on and the staff is very knowledgeable making their recommendations informed and not random. Probably one of my favorite things about Bencotto is the fairly large \"Create Your Own\" pasta section of the menu. I LOVE this because I tend to be picky when it comes to my pasta and I feel like I always want to make adjustments at other Italian Restaurants. With the \"Create Your Own\" menu, I can pick my favorite type of pasta, pair with the perfect sauce and choose my protein. So, it's never bad! I will say that their baked pastas are pretty awesome too. This is one of my favorite date night spots and I'll definitely be back!"], ["Eric B.", "Located right in the heart of Little Italy in San Diego, this place is consistently rated one of San Diego's best Italian restaurants.A quick disclaimer, I grew up eating my mom's Italian food which was beyond amazing. So I'm easily disappointed and pretty harsh with my reviews on Italian food.With that said, this place was solid but not spectacular. \u00a0I was expecting a bit more out of the homemade pasta, and the marinara sauce was a little oily and too heavy for my taste.We also got an average salad and a calamari dish in a spicy tomato-based sauce which was pretty good but a little bland.It's a really modern and nice looking restaurant on the inside, and the atmosphere is good.Little Italy in general is a really quaint and fun place. \u00a0If you find yourself there, Bencotto is worth a try."], ["Teresa R.", "You'll need to uber it over here. It is impossible to find parking if you have a reservation. \u00a0Tables are so close together that you can hear the conversations of the couples around you. I had a hard time conversating with my boyfriend because it was really loud in here.We ordered the Polpette Bencotto appetizer, caesar salad, the lasagna alla bolognese, and gnoccio bolognese. \u00a0 Then appetizer was delish. It was a bunch of meatballs served with this delicious spicy tomato sauce. The meatballs were very light. They weren't tough. The sauce had a slight kick to it with a bit of sweetness. Loved the salad. The lasagna was okay. My boyfriend loved it . What I did not like about this lasagna was the fact that i can taste a lot of nut meg in the middle. I am assuming they used bolognese sauce on top and used some type of bechamel in the middle. The gnocci was is a very heavy meal so it's probably something you'll \u00a0want to share. I was not able to finish it all. \u00a0I love how the gnocci was very delicate and silky. It reminded me of raviolli. \u00a0Our server was awesome. I did not think the bus boy was nice. Unless he just didn't speak english. We told him we wanted to take some of our appetizer sauce home and if he can give us just a littl emore of the sauce and he told me they didn't carry a sauce container. I asked him what do they put the sauce in when people order it to go? He said he didn't have a container small enough to put left over sauce. I asked if he can give us a little more, of course we would pay, and he refused. Really? Anyway, he ended up finding a smaller container to put our left over sauce in and didn't even hook us up with more. Ambiance is nice. Definitely a place you can take a date. You'll have to make reservations because it's hard to get a table on the weekends. I'm a big critic when it comes to wine being poured in my glass. I hate going to restaurants that give you less than an inch of wine in your glass. That you end up buying three glasses.. The glasses here are average to big and they definitely did a great pour on my wine. \u00a0My whole glass lasted me from start to finish. \u00a0=) Cheers to that!"], ["Cat Q.", "Beautiful restaurant with a nice atmosphere and friendly waitress. +++Riso Fritto (Fried Saffron Risotto Balls, Bolognese Meat sauce dip).

Soon after the host sent people without reservations to their sister restaurant Monello. (I hear that one is good too! I bookmarked it. :) The entire staff was extremely friendly. We never wanted for anything. This is sometimes rare at a popular place like this!As for the food: Oh my! Fresh pasta certainly makes a difference. I had Tagliatelle pasta with a cream sauce. It was very much like fettucini alfredo. Except I NEVER had a better version than what I had for lunch at Bencotto. The pasta was perfectly al dente and covered with the fabulous sauce.

Bencotto stood out.After frequenting San Diego for a few years, this was actually one of our first dinners with just my girlfriend and I near the downtown area. Even though it's not really downtown, in fact it's more particular \"Little Italy.\"Squid Ink fettucini and Build your own Pink Sauce on Fusili and sausage. Those were the two main dishes we had. Both EXCELLENT.I will actually start with the consistency of the pasta. Both on point, not too soft and not too hard. In fact, the fettucini noodles were also relatively thin, which made it a delight to eat and I felt like really let the flavor of the sauce be the star. As opposed to a heavy pasta flavor.The flavors for each were confident. Each with it's own unique herbs. I'm usually a fan of pink sauce because while it has a tomato hint, it's USUALLY very creamy like alfredo. However, this was a bit more on the tomato-ey side and was in fact quite light. So, it made for a nice contrast to the squid ink.Atmosphere is great for a date. Maybe a small dinner party for business or gathering. It keeps a modern feel and also very simple. While I wouldn't say Bencotto is expensive, it's not a place I can eat once a week. Which is why I cannot give this place a 5 stars. It's GOOD pasta, don't get me wrong.

The broth had the perfect level of every flavor: spicy, sour, salty, sweet!My entree was the Tagliatelle with Lamb Ragu. The fresh pasta itself elevates the dish with an unrivaled texture, but the sauce was also perfectly balanced with tomato and lamb flavors!

She said it's the best pasta she's ever had. I don't know if she groups Italian pasta in the same category as Asian noodles, cause she's kinda racist like that, but if she does, she basically says Bencotto is better than China.

On top of that, the house gave us a tiramisu, which was also excellent. But the coup de gr\u00e2ce was a complimentary bottle of their house olive oil, a reward for not breaking up for a decade.Talk about a gift that keeps on giving and fond reminder of our amazing meal at Bencotto.

Also, we were in our server's blind spot and weren't greeted for 10 minutes after beings sat. Coming from the industry, you get 30 seconds to acknowledge your table.After that, everything felt busy/rushed. We ordered our dinners with our drinks for fear our waitress wouldn't come back. My glass of prosecco was flat. Pastas were solid but not spectacular. The gnocchi is handmade, but very heavy. Our sauces were served wrong, but they corrected it. Good flavor, but not the best I've had.We were hoping desserts would be stellar. We ordered the chocolate mousse (GOOD!) and the flourless chocolate cake. I never send food back. I sent this back. The texture was all wrong, could not be eaten with a spoon (which is the only utensil they gave us) and had really no chocolate flavor at all.

Guess I previously wanted to try this place.We were here early afternoon, so right before they opened (11:30am on a Saturday). We were seated right away and everyone there was very friendly and knew a lot about the dishes.We ordered the fried zucchini flowers stuffed with cheese to start. OMG. So #1, this dish comes laid on a truffle sauce. TRUFFLE SAUCE. Anything that includes truffle anything is basically the way to my heart. I also LOVE cheese. I thought these fried zucchini flowers were amazing and they were recommended to us by our server because she said they were here favorite. My boyfriend didn't feel the exact same way about them. He said they were too cheesy, but I thought the cheese was perfect, light, and not overpowering.For pasta I ordered from the Valentine's Day specials menu and got squid ink gnocchi in a lobster bisque sauce. Now, I love lobster bisque and I love gnocchi, but with the combination of the squid ink, it was a little salty for my liking. I did hear another waitress tell some customers that the squid ink does add some saltiness to the pasta.My boyfriend ordered one of their most popular dishes, the tagliatelle. He ordered from the Valentine's Day specials menu also, I can't remember the sauce, but his also had large prawns and asparagus. He loved his pasta and said he definitely wants to be back.All their pastas are made in house, daily! Gnocchi is my favorite pasta and when a restaurant is serving homemade, fresh gnocchi, it's always my go to dish. Everything is pretty moderately priced, but the portions are much bigger than either of us were expecting. After sharing the zucchini flowers and each having a cocktail, neither of us could finish our pastas. Made for yummy leftovers!"], ["Alex W.", "I am ever so glad that a local referred us to Bencotto. A local friend of a friend pointed us there for good authentic Italian food in Little Italy as we wanted to try something out there while visiting San Diego. After a long day of being tourists, we needed good home-cooked nourishment. Homemade carbs was exactly what we needed! We didn't have a wait and were able to sit outside as requested. Although it took awhile for someone to come by and greet us at the table, it was smooth sailing once our waitress finally did. Our waitress was calm and sweet! She went thru the menu with us, suggesting we go with the house specials or the \"pasta your way\" for dinner. Both of us chose a side salad [go with the Bencotto salad sans beets!], and each a house special - green ravioli with sausage and a cream sauce, and a pinched pasta filled with a pumpkin-based filling and cream sauce. Everything was unbelievably filling and delicious - I seriously cannot praise them enough. Had we both had more space in our stomach, we might have ordered dessert or a drink. From speaking with our waitress, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu."], ["Alyssa M.", "I recently had dinner at Bencotto while vacationing in San Diego and would highly recommend others to do the same. I eat gluten free for health reasons (not by choice) which can make dining out difficult. \u00a0Bencotto noted my allergy in our reservation and when we arrived, the hostest thanked me for letting them know ahead of time and said they take food allergies very seriously. \u00a0Music to my ears!Our waitress (do not remember her name, but she had short blonde hair) was very helpful and gave great recommendations. After describing my wine preferences, she suggested the California chardonnay and I loved it. \u00a0For dinner I had the gluten-free fusilli with pesto sauce and my boyfriend had one of the specials, fettuccine with a lamb meat red sauce; both were excellent.

Made a reservation and came here on a weekday night. Ordered melon and prosciutto and squid ink tagliatelle to share. Melon/prosciutto was plated beautifully, and there was A LOT of prosciutto! :O I was a little worry because usually prosciutto was too salty for me and I can only eat a little, but the prosciutto at Bencotto wasn't too salty! The texture was also a little different from the typical prosciutto too, but it was delicious. As for the squid ink tagliatelle--I love squid ink stuff so it's a default that I'll order anything squid ink--it was also delicious. The seafood sauce was creamy but not too heavy, and there's a lot of seafood piece in it! The tagliatelle was a bit not as al dente as I would like, but good nonetheless. There are also other squid ink dishes like gnocchi and ravioli (didn't see it that day) on the daily special, I would come back just for them :P"], ["Trung N.", "I am not one to normally suggest Italian food because I generally find it too heavy and most of the time, pretty basic when it comes to textures and flavors.

The restaurant is sleek, modern in design, and conceptually open. My party and I were quickly led to our table and the wait staff was super efficient in taking our drink order.The two dishes that were mind blowing:-the \"Pasta Your Way\" with the tagliatelle pasta topped with their infamous Bencotto (pink pancetta) sauce. The pasta had a nice al dente firmness and combined with the sauce, each bite was savory and flavorful. -the handmade crab ravioli. Bomb. Five gorgeous pieces of ravioli stuffed with generous heaps of sweet crab. The ravioli and crab ratio was on point, and the lobster bisque sauce that bathed the ravioli created this flavorful explosion in my mouth.Each dish was unbelievably good here.If I ever find myself in this neck of the woods again, I would definitely make a stop to try out other dishes."], ["Nancy D.", "Wow fresh beetroot, olives, goat cheese, green beans and lettuce with a balsamic dressing that was so good we used our bread to absorb the last drop .

The bread & olive oil/vinegar mix was GREAT!We started off with the risotto balls which were covered in waaaay to much breading & barely any risotto inside. For the main course I got the gnocchi with the 'summer' sauce which tasted like a sweet meat sauce & was sorta bland.

I wish it had a little bit more flavor. A little salt added really helped.

I think they literally had one section put together for bigger parties (there was a party sitting at the tables that they had reserved for us so we had to wait for them to leave). It's a great little romantic spot for dates though, dim lighting and super intimate. They are best known for their home made pastas and after trying their food, I can't agree more! They gave us bread before we ordered and we were STARVING so we filled up on the bread and they were so generous with refilling the bread too! No skimping here! It also came with oil and vinegar for dipping the bread.I ordered the Tagliatelle autunno pasta and added meatballs (it has bacon in it but I feel like bacon isn't really a \"meat.\") The sauce in the pasta was amazing, not too salty or overwhelming but definitely enough flavor especially with the hint of the shiitake and bacon. The meatballs were really good too although there were only like 5 meatballs and it costs ~$5 to add them. They were also a TEENSY itsy bitsty too salty. The service here was great, they checked on us constantly. One thing aside from the delay in being seated was that there was a delay in bringing out the last person's dish and being the fancy people we are (haha) we felt it was necessary to wait for her dish to arrive (she ordered the same thing as me minus meatballs and despite her request to start eating) which was honestly like 10 minutes.

My last time here, I called last minute to let them know that I needed to add an extra person to my already large party of 7 people. They squeezed in an extra chair and made sure that my friend had a great birthday celebration. I have to say that for the quality of the food, and wine and alcohol that we added to our tab, it wasn't an outrageous cost for dinner. We ordered a cheese plate and some pastry dough apps, two bottles of wine and each had an entree. We each had a desert wine to finish the evening. I had the lemon cello which was so sweet and refreshing. Our total came to about $80 a person. I think we all chipped in for the birthday girl's dinner too.

This place is special because they hand make all their pasta fresh daily!When we arrived they immediately sat us to our table inside right next to the window.

We started with the fried zucchini, and it was amazing! came with perfectly cooked sun dried tomatoes and some sort of white sauce that was great! We then split the caprese salad and this might have been my favorite part of the whole meal. For our entrees I got the fettuccine with a lamb sauce and added chicken; my girlfriend got the same pasta but had the bencotto sauce and added chicken as well.

The pesto was quite good, perhaps it could of been better with a little more aggressive seasoning to bring it together. The gnocchi were like multiple soft pillows that just kept on coming one after another. Their flavor was mild, but their texture were a melt in your mouth type quality. The shrimp were good, but I could not help notice that they were a little over done. Nevertheless, provided a nice sense of the sea and firm texture (yelp.com/biz_photos/benc\u2026). They were nice because they broke up the monotony of the pesto sauce, not that I did not like of course.

We looked at it and not only did they increase the prices, the menu was quite limited and didn't have the dish I was looking forward to. So we moved our reservation to the day before.

The speck was outstanding - the highlight of the meal. It came with fried bread and that was good too - better than the bread basket, for sure! Our pasta was good but not great. Considering their location, I expected this homemade pasta to blow me away. Don't get me wrong, it was good. It's not like I took a bite and spit it out - far from it. The sauce had a nice flavor and the pasta did have a decent texture. But from the rave reviews I just expected it to be better than other places in the area and it really wasn't. And coupled with the too-cool-for-school service, we walked away kinda disappointed with the overall experience.Next time we are in town we'll stick to our old favorites on India Street."], ["Anna G.", "We came to Bencotto to try their thinly sliced cantaloupe topped with prosciutto appetizer and squid ink shrimp pasta based on the reviews. Both were incredible! We had some other dishes as well but I would definitely recommend those two as they stood out the most.

Great experience overall."], ["Jay D.", "Slow, subpar service but the food was excellent, especially the gnocchi bolognese. Server took over ten minutes to even approach our table and even though we asked for bread it didn't come out before our meals at which point we had to ask again. Server also took a very long time to see if our food came out okay --granted I eat pretty fast but I was 3/4th done with my entree by the time she came back to the table. Perhaps it's worth a return trip on a less busy night but for this kind of restaurant the service should never suffer or compromise the experience when the food is doing its level best."], ["Denise K.", "Had a wonderful date night here. We made a reservation through Open Table... arrived a few minutes early and we were seated right when we got there. I always give kudos to restaurants who are timely with their reservations.This was our first time eating here so we had no idea what to expect. The restaurant has a very clean, simple, modern look to it. Lots of clean lines, metal edges, white plates and napkins. We were seated upstairs next to the glass partition. It was a great spot because we could look downstairs at the bar/tender, the prosciutto cutting station, and see the hub-bub goin' on outside on the streets. Our server, Melissa, greeted us with a big smile and was very friendly. She told us her favorite items on the menu and we went with it. We ordered our cocktails and per her recommendation, we ordered:Caprese salad - Interesting presentation. They serve the mozzarella in a ball, on the side of a gigantic dish. You're somewhat forced to construct your own caprese salad stack. I didn't mind the extra effort it takes to build this salad. It was simple. Fresh. Good. Tagliatelle with lamb - house-made pasta that's perfectly al dente. Wowie, I love that! The lamb sauce was rich and flavorful. The meat was so soft and the ragu held onto the pasta. Perfection. Crab ravioli - gorgeous presentation. 5 gigantic handmade ravioli stuffed with generous heaps of crab. No seafood fillers here. The sauce was absolutely divine - I was scooping it up with fresh bread. And the black caviar on top? LOVE!Panna cotta - a perfect way to end our meal. The texture and flavor of this panna cotta is... seductive. Yup - I said it. Seductive. You get one taste and you can't stop. At the end of our meal, Melissa was so polite and thanked us for stopping in and said we were the nicest couple in her section that night. Who doesn't love a compliment?? Service, food and ambiance are all excellent. 5 stars all around and I'm looking forward to returning soon. There were just too many things on the menu that peaked my interest! And the following day, I received a call from Bencotto. They called to thank us for dining with them. I thought that was a very nice touch. They've found a loyal patron in me!"], ["Paige B.", "Saw this restaurant showcased on PBS and looked forward to giving it a try.Went here for my husband's birthday last week and we were not impressed. Atmosphere was very noisy and industrial with exposed ductwork. Service felt rushed. The waitstaff was freindly and attentive but felt like hit and run. This was not the relaxed dining experience that I had in mind for my husband's birthday. Food was just ok. My husband was not fond of the sauce that he ordered and my pasta was slightly underdone. (I let it sit in the sauce for a few minutes and it was fine, did not want to send it back and wait another half hour.) Don't think we'll be going back. We don't eat out often and when we do I want it to be enjoyable not rushed and noisy with just ok food. For the price it should have been a better experience."], ["Staci R.", "Dear Bencotto,You've reset the bar for authentic Italian cuisine in my book. We saw your ranking in Best of San Diego and had to give you a try so we made a Thursday evening reservation for our anniversary. We found street parking a few blocks away. I wish you offered parking or valet service, but I understand it's Little Italy so that would be a lot to ask. We were seated promptly and approached by a gentleman who offered us water. We obliged and browsed the menu. Someone brought over some italian bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I gave up white bread a few months ago but my fiance looked to be enjoying the loaf so I dug in. To say it was amazing would be an understatement. It was all I could hope for in italian bread and more: soft but not too soft, flaky crush, amazing. We ordered an assorted cheese plate (regional cheese, great touch) and enjoyed it. It came out swiftly. Our entrees came out swiftly too. For entrees I ordered the \u00a0Tagliatelle al nero di seppia (squid ink pasta) with Shrimp and a spicy pink shrimp sauce because I heard great things about it and had never tried squid ink pasta before. My fiance ordered the pasta your way with the Al Formaggi (cheese sauce), whole wheat Tagliatelle and chicken. \u00a0My dish was delicious. To be quite honest I didn't taste much of a difference in the squid ink pasta vs. regular pasta but the pasta tasted every bit as fresh and made on site as we were told it would be. The sauce was flavorful and delicious. \u00a0Thank you for the ample amount of shrimp you gave me, the many whole shrimp and pieces in my sauce were lovely. My fiance enjoyed his meal too. We didn't partake in any wine or dessert this time but your offerings in both seemed scrumptious. Sincerely,Staci RP.S.

I know some people might think my review is not valid for this reason so I just had to throw that out there. I am only an average girl who enjoys food. This is really good Italian food in my opinion. That ricotta truffle souffl\u00e9 that everyone has a picture of.... YES, it actually is very good! I'm actually lactose intolerant but I still ate it because it was delicious! We shared it amongst 2.5 people (half because one person only took like one bite of it) and it was more than enough! It was so rich and dense and creamy and all good things you could imagine for a ricotta truffle souffl\u00e9! I had the squid ink pasta with shrimps! This too was delicious! I couldn't tell the difference between normal pasta and squid ink pasta besides the obviousness of the color. I think the sauce masks the flavor of the pasta itself that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference unless I ate the pasta by itself. The sauce wasn't heavy which I enjoyed! There was definitely more shrimp than I expected so that was also a plus! The portion size was very good too! The cheese souffl\u00e9 made me full from the richness that I couldn't finish my pasta! :( My friend had a prosciutto pasta and she enjoyed it! I can't say much else about it. I tried a bite if it. I think it was good but it's not my cup of tea for a full dish. There was also another dish that was just simple penne with spicy sausages I think. That was what you could imagine. My friend wanted it more spicy so we got her some red pepper flakes and she was happy. We did come for my birthday so they gave us a small version of their tiramisu. Always a little plus!

You can build your own pasta bowl which is pretty cool so you can make the sauce-pasta combination you want. We got the riso fritto as an app and it was heavenly. The outside was very crisp while the inside was gooey and decadent. Both my boyfriend and I got the pasta your way. I got the arrabbiata sauce which is a combination of spicy garlic and tomato. The sauce was pretty good. It wasn't anything to run and tell home about, but I didn't regret getting it. My boyfriend got the Bolognese sauce which is traditional tomato sauce with meat in it. The meat to sauce ratio was a little off and mostly it was just clumps of meat. Perhaps I am just used to how my grandma makes it, but I like pasta sauce a little more... saucy. Despite this, however, the flavor was great. I really liked how they cooked my noodles. I got the pappardelle and they were firm and delicious. The service was ok. Our server did everything he was supposed to do. He refilled our glasses, took our order, gave us our food all in a timely manner. He didn't go above and beyond for us and his personality was a little flat, but perhaps I am just being a little picky, after all, it was a busy Saturday night. The hostess was very nice and sat us immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. Overall, I say check this place out if you are in the area.

We found Piacere Mio not too far from the place we were staying and decided to give it a shot.Our first impression when we walked in was that Piacere Mio was a trendy trattoria with a lot of fashionable-looking people, though we did not feel too out of place with our kids. The atmosphere overall was warm and welcoming, and actually hearing the staff speak Italian took me back to my experiences traveling there. We also appreciated the friendly and accommodating service from our waitress and other staff, especially in their catering to our kids. Overall, our initial feelings about good, and we were excited about our meal.Regarding our food, it left me feeling much less excited at the end. I had the special risotto of the night, the Risotto Salcissia E Funghi, which contained their house Italian sausage, mushrooms, and gorgonzola cheese; I also had some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The plating of this dish was nice, as the risotto was widely spread out over the plate, allowing for each spoonful to be full and for the bottom of the dish to reveal itself; it is a visual effect that was appealing, one that is hard to fully describe but made the dish pop some more. I noticed the plating of my family's dishes also being very nice as well, further adding to the excitement of our meal. However, once I put that spoonful in my mouth, the pleasure stopped there. While the flavor profile was not bad, there was something very off with the texture of the risotto. It was not the al dente rice, rather it was some sort of combination of gritty, gummy, and stringy that left me wondering, \"what the hell happened?\" I can assume that this displeasing texture was the gorgonzola cheese and the process by which it was folded into the risotto, perhaps combined with the parmesan. On top of this, the sausage also had a weird texture and taste in that it was dry and lacking fat and spice. I frankly have had better Italian sausage from my local grocery store, so for an Italian restaurant to fall flat with this was unfortunate. The dish itself was edible overall, but if I were not there with my family with my kids getting restless, I would have sent the dish back and asked for something else. The pasta that my wife and kids got did not have such issues and seemed tasty enough. However, it was enough of a flaw to throw me off, especially since the set up to the meal had been so good.I do think that if I had another occasion to go to Piacere Mio, I would give it another shot. The potential seemed like it was there, and given other reviews, it seems like others' experiences have been more perfect. But if others find such imperfections in their dishes, I'd question if the atmosphere and service is just compensating for flawed food."], ["Kirsten S.", "AMAZING!Delicious, well-made food paired with a friendly and cozy atmosphere means happy pasta-filled people. Our waitress's name was Manuela (sorry if I spelled it wrong!), and she was wonderful. She put up with my extremely talkative dad with ease, gave us great suggestions for meal choices, brought out a ridiculously good tiramisu/ sang to my sister for her birthday, and gave us all samples of dessert wine to pair with our tasty post-dinner treats.On another note, the pasta is FRESHLY MADE! What?! So good! Literally everyone's meals were eye-wideningly good, although I have to say that mine was the best--capellini with funghi (you can never go wrong with mushrooms).The restaurant itself is adorable. It's fairly small with cool lighting, located on a street corner in South Park. Parking was quickly found, and because we made a reservation, we were seated right away; that being said, it didn't seem like anyone waited too long to be seated.Everyone on staff is friendly and attentive, although I have to admit, I think we got the best waitress there :) Great staff, freshly made food, and a good atmosphere means we'll definitely be returning."], ["Norm D.", "Friendly service, fresh pasta, rich red wines, homemade desserts!

Piacere Mio was one of these places. I came in with a friend on Christmas Eve. There was a large party already seated, and there was us. We were greeted with the jovial Italian accents in full presentation, and slowly it unraveled from there..Our starters were the only solid part of the meal IMO. I will say their Carpaccio was one of the best I have ever had. Very delicate, pretty and well done. The Buratta was also very nice, delicate and fresh, but the meat pairing didn't go well with it. Throughout our time there, service became spotty at best. Yes, there was a large party there, but no one seemed rushed or stressed. They also looked like they didn't care. Good amounts of time came and went before we were even checked on, or asked if we needed anything refreshed. As far as our main meals we got Gnocchi and Salmon Ravioli. My Ravioli tasted a bit too fishy for my taste. Fish should not taste fishy. It tasted almost like canned fish, not fresh. The Gnocchi was fine, smaller than I was expecting..and again didn't really look handmade. It resembled something that had been pre made, and then just warmed up. They tasted fine, but there was nothing mind blowing about them. I feel maybe I caught them on an off day going by reviews, but again I find this becoming common place for very highly rated eateries to not be as good as they have been written about. I do like the location, and the place is small and quaint. I thought the starters were nice enough, but it is not enough for me to want to come back again, especially with the spotty service.

We had our 10 year Anniversary here and it was a cattle call to say the least. The staff and chef are still on point but tonight on a Wednesday was filled with Coronado, and downtowners, also people who could not get into Bueno Forshetta whatever that place is called down the street. I am removing a star NOT because of the food or the service but because this place is like Alexander's down the street now, loud, obnoxious and not a place to have a lovely dinner without LOUD acoustics.LIke Alexander's, we *might* come back once the hype dies down or if several new Italian places open up Downtown.

The carbonara as seen on other yelpers photos seemed small in size, but it most definitely is not. \u00a0They are not only generous with the pasta but with the pancetta as well. They give you more than the $13 you pay for this dish. \u00a0It is more creamy and rich in taste then how i usually like my carbonara (usually more egg-y) but Pacere Mio's version is delicious nonetheless. The taglierini neri ai frutti di mari or squid ink pasta with seafood was the better dish of the night. \u00a0Packed with lots of squid, octupus, shrimp, mussels, and and clams in a light marinara sauce is just perfect. \u00a0Not too starchy and balanced with all the seafood. \u00a0It could have used a bit more seasoning and heavier on the sauce but even as leftovers this dish was delish.

The consistency of the risotto was perfect- creamy and al dente at the same. Hubby got the spaghetti carbonara, a creamy white sauce with chunks of thick prosciutto in it. Mom got the penne with shrimp which was tossed in a rose cream sauce. We all enjoyed the carbonara and lamb the best. Service, per the usual, was welcoming and attentive.

Not sure, but it looks like the place is ran by an owner-chef, and I could feel that from various places in the restaurant; food style, trend of menu, service style...I tried the sepia pasta with seafood; the amount of seafood it comes with is significantly large! \u00a0Probably larger than some over-priced American restaurant's Cioppino.. The pasta was made fresh from the restaurant; the taste was delicate, I personally think it would go well with a light oil-sauce based, but still go enough. We also tried classic Lasagna.

The menu is amazing. The pasta is made in house and the dishes are seriously authentic. Everything I've tried has been delicious. I highly highly highly recommend the calamari to start. I can't understand how they got it so right. The calamari was seriously so light and perfect - it's amazing. Also, don't neglect the bread and lentils - they are very flavorful. A nice change from standard bread and butter (or olive oil). If you're looking for an amazing ravioli, you've come to the right spot. The three meat ravioli with mushroom sauce is to die for. It's so good. Like lick your plate good. I'm not even exaggerating. The linguine with white calms is also a top choice in my book. So fresh and flavorful. Yum!

The prosciutto burrata was incredible. The spinach pesto didn't look good, but sure tasted good. They need to spruce up the presentation on this. I'll save you from what it looks like. My pumpkin risotto was good but fell short a little bit. It dries out on the top easily. A little over cooked. If you keep stirring it up, it saves it some. It was to have bacon and shrimp in it. There was hardly any bacon in it. The shrimp were ok. I think they need to just throw a couple large shrimp in here opposed to the medium to small scattered ones.

You're reading a review written by a guy who's 100% Italian, and grew up outside of Boston, spoiled by the famous North End Italian restaurants, so my standards are high. The biggest mistake wannabe restaurants make is ruining the sauce. This happens everywhere - Italian restaurants, pizza shops, etc. Piacere Mio has a great sauce because it's simple, yet still unique and tasty.

Pasta was cooked perfect, the sauce amazing, and there must have been 15-16 whole clams all for $15.50. I always order linguine and clams when trying out a new Italian place bc it's such a simple dish but always amazing how many places mess it up. My girlfriend ordered the Orrechetti and that was absolutely mouth water as well. We finished with a cannoli for dessert and that was off the charts too.

Came here last night around 7:00pm. The place was fairy busy but we were seated right away. Water and bread were delivered to the table right away. I enjoyed the lentils that came with the bread. A very different approach than just your standard butter or balsamic and olive oil. Appetizer: Got the burrata and proscuitto. \u00a0$8.95. Their proscuitto wasn't overly salty and went very well with the smooth and creamy burrata. I'm not sure if they make their burrata there but it was delicious. It also come with some pickled vegetable which complimented the saltiness of the proscuitto very well. Probably 6 slices of proscuitto and a decent serving of burrata. Pasta: One of the owners came over and kept telling us that they were famous for their pasta. They make it fresh everyday. Got the frutti di mare and also the bolognese pasta. $15.00 Frutti Di Mare- came with a decent portion of clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari. The red sauce was light and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I chose the Tagliatelle pasta which soaked up the sauce very well. $13.00 Bolognese: Wow such a delicious meat sauce. I wanted to lick the bowl afterwards. You can tell that it must have been simmering for a long time because all the ground beef and pork were very tender. Got the papperdelle pasta with this I like how they give very generous portion sizes. I only had half my pasta which was more than enough.

I wouldn't go as far as to say the food will blow your mind - it's good but not phenomenal - however it's certainly decent and enjoyable and I would definitely recommend a visit to experience it for yourself. On our last visit my wife and I started our meal by sharing the caprese; my wife's choice. I would never order caprese as I feel like it's something you could easily make at home, however it was as good as caprese should be. For entrees my wife had the Lasagne Ala Bolognese and I had the Taglierini Neri Al Fruitti Di Mere (Squid Ink pasta, with Shrimp, Squid, Clams and Mussels). Both were delicious, though I would recommend the Taglierini over the Lasagne for something a little less predictable. For dessert we shared the Cannoli. It was my first Cannoli experience so I can't say whether it was better or worse than most, however I thoroughly enjoyed it.The main reason I'm writing this review however is because of the service and 'pleasantness' of the place. It's small, intimate and cosy and the staff are friendly, making you feel welcome and well looked after. It's a perfect date place and is suitable for small groups or families. I recommend giving this place a try next time you're in the mood for good quality italian food, at a moderate price in a nice friendly environment.

Another over rated yelp place (like Ota). We went for Christmas Eve lunch. There was a large party and a couple other tables with 2 people each. There were plenty of open tables to choose from. So it was not that busy for all the workers standing around...standing around ignoring us. I inquired about wine when the waiter finally came over. First he said there was one red by the glass. Then I asked about the other ones on the menu that were by the glass (thinking maybe they ran out).He said 'oh yeah ok well you can get this one or that one they all the same'. Really? All the wines were the same? OKAY, I saw where this was going. I asked for any recommendations and he once again said they were all the same. After I read the menu and decided on one blindly, he brought a whole glass, no tasters here I guess. I had never heard of any of them and I wine taste A LOT.ANYway he disappeared awhile someone brought bread with lentil oil which was ok. He finally came to take our order with a stone cold look, no smile not friendly at all he actually seemed borderline irritated that he had to deal with us. So he had no personality OK fine but be a good waiter then...NOPE he was always gone, empty plates stacked up on out table etc. We had to push our appetizer and bread plates into a pile to the side before the bread guy eventually came to clear them. We noticed the servers all socializing a lot not giving a eff about us who were just a few feet away. It was the whole I can't be bothered with you attitude the whole time.Now onto the food. The carpaccio was EXCELLENT, my favorite dish done to perfection. I would go back for the carpaccio alone. The meat was sliced paper thin and of high quality as was the olive oil that was drizzled on it. There were also shaving of grilled eggplant and capers mixed in the arugula that came with it.The buratta with prosciutto was OK the burratta was good but there was something missing it needs some arugula or something to break up the monotony of the dish. Also a little cracked pepper would have been nice but of course the sever never came around for it after it was delivered. The bread guy came buy with it for the carpaccio earlier, but no such luck minutes later for this dish.I ordered the gnocci my friend got the salmon ravioli, but we always share. The gnocci was loaded with cheese and not bad in my opinion but i have definitely had better (and worse). She thought the gnocci tasted like trader joes gnocci and nothing special. Her ravioli was REALLY fishy. I am guessing they never cleaned the brown salmon fat off the salmon to make the ravs. The fish flavor was really overbearing and drowned out the saffron sauce. I will say the dish looked lovely but unfortunately it was no good. Also the asparagus that came on it was SO WRONG someone should be slapped. It's not that hard to get asparagus right. They served the bottom part that should have been discarded and sauteed it VERY briefly it was like chewing straw or a stick of lemon grass. She sent her dish back and we shared my gnocci. The salmon ravs sat there a LONG time before he came buy to ask why we had set them to the side, the gnocci were almost gone.The wine I picked was drinkable but on the sweet side, I wish I had been offered a chance to taste test a few.Server never asked us about dessert and we asked for the check to split which he said ok but them came back with one check and told us different amount to pay that made no sense. So in complete frustration I jumped up and grabbed a menu and figured it out myself. He came over to ask what was going on and i snarkily replied ''well since you refuse to split the check i am figuring it out for us'. He said he couldn't because of their archaic order system, which was a numbered ticket assigned to each waiter. OK in this day and age REALLY? Could you be ANY more unaccommodating?The 2 stars is for the amazing carpaccio everything else pretty much sucked."], ["Ashley B.", "We had dinner at Piacere Mio last night to celebrate my husband's birthday and my own birthday. \u00a0We had reserved a table for 10 about two weeks ago and were suprised to see such a crowd for a neighborhood walkabout event. \u00a0Even with the extra foot traffic we were seated promptly and served efficiently. \u00a0Everyone was so friendly and helpful, it was amazing. \u00a0Each item was cooked beautifully and the wine was delicious and affordable. \u00a0I'm so happy we chose this restaurant for our celebration dinner!"], ["danya b.", "Great service.

When we walked in maybe 15 minutes later, our table was set and they greeted me by name. Now that's customer service.We started off with a bruschetta, which they serve with prosciutto and mozzarella - don't see that every day. Maybe the bread is crunchier and the tomatoes are fresher elsewhere, but hey put a little meat on there and I thought it was fantastic.Ordered a tagliatelle carbonara, tagliatelle arrabiatta, cappellini frutti di mare, and orecchiette. Had to wait quite a while for food to come out, but when it did, we all liked our dishes. The portions here are pretty large; if you're not starving, you could probably eat half the dish and be pretty satisfied. Only thing I wasn't impressed with was the orecchiette, which was drowning in whatever sauce/gravy it comes with.We actually only decided to come here after Buona Forchetta (down the street) had a wait time of 1 hr and 40 min (wtf). Definitely not upset though at having discovered this solid Italian restaurant."], ["Jason L.", "I cant pronounce half the stuff on the menu here.

The. \u00a0Best. \u00a0Calamari. \u00a0Evah!!! \u00a0The abundant amount of perfectly fried and seasoned calamari is mixed with fried shrimp and zucchini. \u00a0The accompanying dipping sauce was drinkably delicioso. \u00a0Yummerz! \u00a0For my main course, I ordered the taglierini neri al frutti di mare, which is squid ink homemade pasta served in marinara sauce with squid, shrimp, clams, and mussels. \u00a0I would definitely order this tasty dish again. \u00a0The pasta was divine, the sea creatures were plentiful, and everything on that dish was finger licking oh so very good. \u00a0Being married to a pastry chef, we couldn't leave Piacere without dessert. \u00a0Piacere graciously comped our dessert to commemorate our anniversary by bringing out creme brulee. \u00a0What a great ending to a great anniversary dinner. \u00a0The hardened sugar on top while mixed with the just right texture made me wish I had my own. \u00a0Actually, eating the pasta as leftovers was a great ending.Piacere Mio, you are truly worthy of your 4.5 star Yelp rating. \u00a0Although I've never ventured into the so called Italian heavyweights, in my gut satisfying opinion, you're the champion Italian establishment. \u00a0Bon apetit Yelpers."], ["Angelina D.", "Didn't like it the last time I was there during Valentine's day. \u00a0The food wasn't that great. \u00a0They messed up my husband's order. \u00a0There was this guy giving roses to all the woman in the place but keep skipping me. \u00a0Needless to say made me feel very bad and made me felt sorry for my poor husband who was trying to make me feel good but the jackasses who work there couldn't even do their job well. \u00a0The owners are nice actually very nice but the experience was overall very negative for me. \u00a0It is not as good as it was last time I was there. \u00a0I don't think I ever want to come again. \u00a0Will spend my money somewhere else."]], "Cucina Basilico": [["Andrea R.", "Love this place! \u00a0We have been here at least a dozen times and have had great service and delicious food every time. \u00a0From beginning to end it is amazing: -Their warm, fluffy, homemade bread with olive oil and balsamic is so good, you can tell the oil and vinegar is the good stuff-I have tried four out of the 8 appetizers, I would have tried them all but my husband doesn't eat pork or beef. \u00a0They have all been great! \u00a0I love that the calamari isn't breaded and deep fried, just perfectly cooked calamari with delicious sauce. \u00a0My other favorite is the bruschetta colorata, yummmm!!!-I've only tried the insalata Basilico (side salad) but the lemon dressing is delicious, if someone advertises lemon dressing on the menu I want to taste the lemon and this dressing delivers, it is bright and fresh every time!-Their pasta and gnocchi is always fresh made in house and perfectly cooked, where else can you get that?! \u00a0My favorite is the pappardelle, no matter what flavor it is I always get this because I love the texture.-I have tried 7 of the 11 sauces and have loved them all, my favorites are the super alfredo (great for garlic lovers because of the whole roasted cloves), the pesto, and the arrabbiata.-I have only tried the tiramisu for dessert but it is sooooo delicious! \u00a0It's light, fluffy, and not too sweet. \u00a0So much better than some of the soggy messes you get at less authentic restaurants, we've even taken it to go and it has still been delicious hours later.What I love about Cucina Basilico is that everything is fresh and homemade so you don't leave feeling heavy and like you need a nap like some other Italian places tend to do. \u00a0The owners Danilo and Francesca are always genuine and welcoming and their staff is friendly and helpful. \u00a0I definitely recommend this place!!!"], ["Khristopher t.", "Had the spinach pasta especial...

I'm not one who goes out to \"pay\" for pasta often, as I feel I can buy some Barillo pasta and sauce and make it at home for $2. However, since I had friends in town who specially requested good Italian food, I had to oblige their request. We were also celebrating a special occasion - their wedding anniversary. We wanted a hole in the wall place, convenient and something that was in the middle of Mira Mesa and Mission Valley. Up popped up Cucina Basilico. I read the reviews and saw how amazing this place was, and it what was a bonus was that this place was located in District 6 in the City of San Diego (my fiancee's district). My friend made reservations for our party of 9 on a weeknight. They accommodated our group with a large table in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant is located in the same shopping center as Sizzler and Jack in the Box, and right off the Aero Drive exit off the 15 freeway.We ordered various items and as we reviewed the extensive menu we were offered comp bread and EVOO and red wine vinegar. I opted to order the lasagna which is one of their staple menus. My entree came out steaming hot, and I had to wait for some time for the lasagna to cool down, but it did - OMG, was it amazing!!!The lasagna just melted in my mouth. I never had lasagna that delicious. The pasta and cheese literally blended so well together. When we return I will definitely order this again! Everyone in our party enjoyed their entree, and everyone complimented on how freshly made the pasta was. My friend mentioned that the pasta was just as comparable to real Italian food from Italy. We all ordered dessert and I opted to order the Flourless Cake. Perfect ended to my dinner. The employees are super friendly and the owner who helped serve was really nice.We will definitely come back to visit for more lasagna!"], ["Omar S.", "I fell in love with Italian food in Italy. I was improbably charmed - and sated - by tiny places whose offerings seemed too limited: a few tables, a wine or two, spontaneous menus created by husbands cooking madly in the back while wives ran dining rooms, each playing Zia to her guests. Those men worked hard to make good food, surprisingly elegant food that was subtle and filling, and those women bustled through their dining rooms, making sure we didn't simply get enough to eat but that we ate enough to suit them, a distinction involving extra food and some coercion. Those ladies weren't just waitresses; they protected the restaurants' reputations.To my surprise and gratification, there is such a place near Qualcomm Stadium, called Cucina Basilico. This restaurant has promise. Chef Danilo cooks while his wife, Francesca, runs the front of house. Chef makes the majority of his food in-house, by hand, including pastas (some gluten-free); sauces, breads and desserts. There's an artistry and concern for quality evident in each plate Danilo's kitchen produces, which, as the restaurant is next door to a Holiday Inn Express and a quick couple of turns off the freeway, may be lost on some of the guests. But smart diners who are willing to trek for pleasurable, high-value Italian food at affordable prices will be glad and grateful for what Danilo and Francesca have created. A caution: while dining at Cucina Basilico shortly after they opened, my wife and I were disappointed by the saltiness of several sauces. This was a problem for the evening, but the place has garnered many positive reviews in the months since then, and I was impressed by the couple's concern for the issue as I mentioned it to them, so I expect the problem has passed. Much as its parks and architecture reflect a city's values, so too do a city's restaurants. Surely, we in San Diego are about more than overpriced Italian fare promoted by pop-culture boites in Little Italy and La Jolla. Show your class, San Diego; visit Cucina Basilico tonight."], ["Dan P.", "High quality Italian, freshly made in a restaurant with ample parking in a location right off the freeway. \u00a0My father, who has Alzheimer's disease, exclaimed after every bite about how much he loved his food. \u00a0He had two pasta dishes and I had the pappardelle with pesto. \u00a0It was delicious and exactly what I was hoping it would be."], ["Mike F.", "Dealing with traffic and parking challenges wear thin even when the food is good. When reading about handmade pasta, that was the deal maker. \u00a0We'd been in the area and this description was spot on to our preferences. The choices all seemed so tempting and even before we'd eaten anything I was thinking this is a spot that will bring us southward. First round:She had a glass of Malbec to accompany the calmari with marinara in a less spicy version. I selected a glass of Chianti. \u00a0Main selections she chose the gnocchi with a Bolognese sauce and the meatballs with marinara was my calling. \u00a0Her gnocchi dish brought an instant smile and what I liked about this was between the meat and sauce, each was discernible. Some we've had are over tomatoed so if there is any meat, they get lost. This was perfect. \u00a0 My meatball dish \u00a0was good as well. Some places that make them so filled with bread crumbs/bread bits that it is a tease. I don't call that a \"meatball\" but a breadball with some meat within. \u00a0The handmade fettuccine noodles have that firm-springy mouth texture which is a hallmark for a good fresh noodle. My one comment there was the noodles took on a bit more salty taste probably from the salted water they were boiled in. Not objectionable though it did bump the salt profile a tad. To round out such a nice meal the final pick was the vanilla panna cotta with berry sauce while she selected an iced Americano. \u00a0The panna cotta was just right for our tastes, sweet without being overly sweet. The berry sauce's tart and acidic balance went well with the light textured panna cotta. Overall the food quality-taste, combined with attentive service and reasonable price concludes for an enjoyable dining experience.

The pesto with fettuccine was without question fresh and delicious! There's really nothing else that compares to fresh pasta. The disappointing aspect to the meal was the organic chicken that cost an extra $3. It was just pan fried and had no flavor. I expected something a little more special for that price!Trying not to hate, but when your take out bill comes out to $12.95 with tax for a weekday lunch, that's just a little pricey for my pocketbook.

As someone who gets full pretty easily and brings home left overs 90% of the time, I expected I'd bring home at least half, like usual when I pay this much.

This was paper thin slices of Octopus on top of a bed of greens with a lemon dressing. \u00a0Light and so tasty.

The fettuccine and gnocchi where excellent. \u00a0Great pastas! Worth a visit."], ["Kelly R.", "Best lasagna I've EVER had. This is not the usual lasagna where they pile on the cheese then stick in a broiler. This is the creamiest, smoothest most delicious lasagna I've ever eaten. My husband and I have become frequent diners here and have tried most everything on the menu, all the sauces and most salads, but that lasagna is hard to pass up.Give this little place a try and take my advice - ORDER that LASAGNA!"], ["Angel L.", "I love fresh pasta and this place has definitely caught my attention. This is quite a gem that is situated close by Fry's and Walmart - it's in the plaza where sizzler is. Here, you won't have to fight others for a spot like you would in Gaslamp and Little Italy.Arrived to this restaurant with 10 other friends, I was pleasantly surprised by its decor. It isn't a huge place, but the light and the colors of the walls were earthy, modest, and welcoming. I would recommend this as a place for a not-so-high-maintenance date.The menu comes with fresh pastas of the day. That night had 4 choices - gnocchi, papardelle, papardelle with sun dried tomatoes, and fettuccine with lemon and red wine. You can match any of the pastas with the sauces available on the menu. Isn't that awesome? Of course you'd have to think about if you made the correct choice by matching appropriately.I struggled with deciding on a match for the Aglio e Olio - papardelle with sun dried tomatoes (because I love tomatoes) VS. fettuccine with lemon and red wine (brightens up the oil and the garlic combo, or so I hoped). I can't believe I was in a dilemma with just simple options like that! So I finally chose and decided that tomato was going to win that night.First - house bread with balsamic and olive oil. I wish the breads were fresh from the oven because it was a bit too hard on the outside for my taste. The vinegar was good.Apps: caprese - the cheese and the tomatoes were sooooooo good! Fresh and light, you know it's Italian done right when they can impress you with just the simple ingredients. I also tried their Bruschetta Colorata - red bell peppers stuffed with goat cheese and bread. The goat cheese is actually mixed with other ingredients, so that it's really light. Last on the app was calamari carpaccio salad. It's a refreshing salad - mainly lemon based with the dressing and the octopus is cut really thin, and unusual but tasty combination IMO.I had the soup of the day - asparagus soup with plenty of herbs and in particular, rosemary. It was so light, no cream, and really fragrant. A fresh start for my Aglio e Olio with papardelle with sun dried tomatoes. Boy the garlic in the pasta!!! I am not a huge garlic eating person. I love cooking and eating foods with garlic but I rarely eat the garlic pieces because it's usually got this bitter taste. Well, Basilico did it so well that it was flavorful, in addition to the kick from the chili in the Aglio e Olio. I have to say though, their papardelle is much much thinner than any other fresh one's I've had at other establishments. I did try my boyfriend's dish that used the same pasta but with the meatball (polpette) sauce. It was good but the pasta was less than al dente. My friend who ordered the same pasta with bolognese sauce also complained similarly. Now, the portions are generous and you can still have room for dessert if you save a little room. However, I couldn't stop eating my dish and I barely finished the last bit! I have been a huge fan of an Italian restaurant in Pasadena, and since my return I have not yet found another Italian to compete with this favorite of mine. This place has made it on my list. Their fresh pasta makes me want to come back for more.The price point and the quality they deliver are not what you would expect. It's wonderful to find a modest restaurant with modest prices that does a wonderful job on delivering fresh and well cooked foods."], ["Bobby H.", "Best fresh made pasta dishes in town! We are here at least once a week and keep being surprised week after week! Fresh pasta, fresh made salads, everything is superb"], ["Mario S.", "Great traditional cucina.

So Italian kitchen to me was something associated with food I can easily make at home, thus vastly overlooked on, the restaurant level, by me. For some reason I stumbled onto this place and figured: \"Ok, let me get a meal I can do at home, probably even better...\" Oh, was I wrong. The masterpiece that came on the plate will take me years to master, and I am not a bad cook. The most important is that they use fresh and mostly organic ingredients, this brings the taste to the next level on its own, but I do the same at home. What made my tastebuds dance was the pasta, pasta mmmmmmmm...... They make theirs in house, the texture of it is not like something I ever tried, it was just right, not too soft and not too hard and what a flavor. I have no idea how to make such a flavorful pasta, I always considered pasta to be the base for the sauce, the sauce base for the meat or fish. In this case it was the dance of textures and flavors perfectly matched for each other. I stayed for desert and one more cup of cappuccino just to write this review. And was not disappointed by either. Wonderful place, the best Italian restaurant in San Diego in my opinion!"], ["Marc C.", "Their menu tells you what is vegetarian, gluten-free and dairy-free, so if you have dietary restrictions it is very helpful. Thumbs up for this!More importantly, the food was very, very tasty. Had the parmigiana and it was fantastic."], ["Daniel K.", "Lasagna is different things to different people, I always order the lasagna at a new Italian restaurant, which I judge very critically. I've had vegetable heavy, cheese heavy, marinara or pesto, some look like bricks, others are delicate squares of heaven. \u00a0This Italian restaurant bridges the gap between preferences. \u00a0I've actually enjoyed several versions of their lasagna which comes complete with a \"lesson\" regarding the origin of the recipe as well as ingredients used in preparation. \u00a0I very much enjoy this place, but must nap almost immediately afterwards."], ["Miss Know It A.", "I've been here several times, it's never very busy and it's always very quiet.

I am rating this restaurant a 2 star rating because not only did they bring me chicken instead of shrimp, but that this supposedly \"organic chicken\" was so dry, I couldn't even eat it. I am not a picky eater by any means..but it was downright disgusting. My friend's meatballs were also not very good. The handmade pasta was good- but not the best I'd ever had. Maybe this restaurant is supposed to be geared towards vegetarians- but I won't be coming back."], ["Jack M.", "The is a very nice new Italian eatery. The key at this place is house made pastas and sauces, not to mention the polpetti or meatballs that I had for an appetizer, to the freshly baked foccacia table bread (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026).I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, and had the Polpette appetizer in a red sauce and the walnut pesto fettuccine. For dessert, I had the piede de napolitana with ricotta cheese. The house foccacia was wonderfully moist with a mild crusty exterior (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). It was the perfect bread for dipping in some fine olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). A great start. The walnut pesto fettuccine also came with extra virgin olive oil, basil, parmigiano and pecorino cheese. It was a sight for sore eyes with its bright green color (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026), but what surprised me the most, was the light, although flavorful flavor it had. It was not oily, nor over burden with garlic. (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). It tasted great, but there was a small issue with the fettuccine, because it stuck together in area and clumped up; as a result, the pasta in those areas was not cooked all the way through. Nevertheless, it was a great pesto sauce and the pasta that was properly cooked, was a perfect al dente. $9The Polpette are made from a lean beef, to a more fatty beef, and finally to a small amount of pork. This dish too, came with a vibrant color, red given of from the house made marinara sauce (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026): a sauce that was well balanced with a slight acidity to a mild sweet after taste. The polpetti had a nice texture ranging from moist to a mild chewiness brought on by different grades of meats. The meatballs was juicy and flavor all the way through (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). This was a great dish to eat with the foccacia bread (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). \u00a0I can't remember how many basked fulls I ate, but I know I ate! Polpette $6.55The dessert was heavenly which I had with a smooth Italian ground coffee (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). The piede de napolitana had milky sweet center brought on by the ricotta cheese. It flavor was mild but very good (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026) I really liked this dessert because it was not overly sweet and the exterior crust won me over (yelp.com/biz_photos/cuci\u2026). I am a big pie crust lover and this one had it going on.This place provides very nice service and delicious food for a very reasonable price, and it's a great alternative for driving downtown looking for a great Italian eatery, because you do not need to anymore.

As you can imagine not many of us had cash so this presented an awkward situation of us trying to figure out who owes what and then pay one another later. After a lot of trying to figure it out the manager did come over and ended up splitting the bill 3 ways so then we could use 2 cards per check for all 6 groups - he apologized and said it was a mixup regarding how many checks they could do per table.

Salads and appetizers were also half off, so my friends and I ordered a couple salads and a bruschetta. I also ordered a spaghetti with marinara plus mushrooms for $13 and my friend ordered a Alfredo with gluten free pasta. The salads featured fresh ingredients and were tasty, but they were not creative. Pear, blue cheese, and walnuts? Seen it. Not sure it's even Italian. My pasta was also alright, but not really worth the expensive price tag. And they messed up my friend's order. They originally brought out regular posts for my friend and later did bring out gluten free pasta for her and offered, it out, but it seemed sloppy when they weren't busy. Overall, this was an okay place to eat with a nice ambiance. The happy hour specials are good and made me glad I tried this place out.

The host could not answer any of our questions because \"oh I dunno yet, it's the first night of restaurant week...?\" I got a bad vibe from our waiter because he had weird crazy eyes but, regardless, it took them 3 reminders to get silverware for my one friend. They got our orders mixed up for each of our three courses. Nobody gave us bread until we asked after having been seated for 30 minutes, and then it was the bus boy who got us the bread. Seriously, the bus boy was the only person in this entire establishment who did a good job. This one random lady brought out one bowl of soup for our appetizers, but actually 3 of us ordered soup. We told her this and she said, \"Oh sorry I was just trying to help...\" And then proceeded to stand there and state at us until we reminded her to get some silverware.Also why was the man serving our dessert wearing one moist latex glove on only his right hand?? SO WEIRD.In regards to food - unimpressed. Bread pudding was not good but cannoli was excellent. Focaccia was made awesome only by dipping it into the tomato basil bisque. Linguini with clams was okay, but I was expecting a white sauce. Wine and cocktails are very pricey.

I was very surprised and impressed that an Italian restaurant had any hot sauce available. Most Italian restaurants seem to be against providing hot sauce to their patrons but that wasn't the case here and I was very glad they did. Everyone else at my table was very happy with their dishes. They ordered ravioli, spaghetti, and a few other dishes I don't recall, which they were all very happy with. Some of their dishes had sausages in it with a delicious red sauce. My family also had some type of cheese plate as a starter but I arrived too late to try it. I was the only one who ordered dessert, but shortly after, everyone started digging in. It was one of the best desserts I have ever had.

I was excited to try it after hearing and reading good things about it I booked it for an anniversary celebration. It was good/average overall and I'd give a half star if I could but went with the lesser based on our overall experience. We arrived about 5:45 for our 6 o'clock reservation we parked behind the restaurant and used the walkway-which is confusing and could use to be signed. We weren't sure if we walked through restaurant/bar or through seemingly creepy dark alley. We went with the first and then were standing at the bar. We exited this side of the restaurant and went into the main side where the hostess stand was so we could be seated. I was happy we made it before 6 so we could place a few things from hh menu. We waited at the host stand for about 2 min and weren't greeted/acknowledge until someone arrived. He was pleasant and said you want outside? I was unsure but he said that's where they have you. \u00a0On our walk to our table-in a work area/bus/drink station without any notice to us the gentlemen stopped and was chatting with someone for at least a minute we stood behind. He didn't explain or apologize, odd but I told my hubby he's probably let the server know I indicated on reservation it was for our anniversary. We sat down and waited again it was now 5:55. No one came by until our server at 5:58 and I inquired about hh and she said well it's the computer not me that makes the time but it was behind. We put in our request anyways. We didn't hear she had been successful but a few minutes later our wine came out! That was a happy surprise. Food-Hh is best deal on food-half off apps and salads. We ordered two apps; bruschetta and stuffed shrimp both were delicious as well as a house salad. I then ordered the sunday chefs 2 course special (@ $20). Although looking back didn't need it because we had made hh. Oh well we took lots home. The special included spicy mussels (our waitress had explained shrimp and pleasantly swapped at her mistake). This was good but on the spicy side accompanied with saut\u00e9ed spinach was tasty. The entree was a chicken spinach penne with wine marinara. This was okay a bit bland in my opinion. I added lots of cheese. My hubby ordered the pesto/arti asparagus pizza this was good too. \u00a0Food was good overall 3.5-4.But service would be a 2.5-3. Last night was lacking for us. Maybe they were short a busser/host. The entry/seating experience, we didn't get water until after server came. \u00a0When she was there she was friendly but maybe preoccupied I asked for a straw she forgot, I asked for more water again she forgot. A large group of 12 sat RIGHT next to us. (Hubby had to get up mid dinner to let lady in) they were waited on more attentively and likely took her focus. After we packed up our leftovers she brought the check with no offer of dessert (which I had planned on getting) and they didn't mention our anniversary, well I could see two other tables giving special birthday desserts. I'd come back for hh or maybe to try another meal might have been a off night for service!"], ["Ivonne V.", "Cajun shrimp pasta for lunch it's really good!Or thinking outside the box...

We've heard lots of good things about this place through word of mouth from other locals so we wanted to try it. I'll preface that we're not food snobs that need the ground we walk on worshiped. We're 2 people in our mid-twenties who like good quality food. I'll start from the beginning:-We parked in their parking lot. What seemed like the entrance was actually just their back patio where anyone could just waltz in. The only other path was walking through the \"chef's alley\" (where employees would most likely go for smoke breaks and were the trash is). This was just odd but not enough to ruffle our feathers. It'd be nice if they had signs saying to walk around to the street side, etc. -We got inside the restaurant and it looked amazing. All white, very nice. There were a good amount of people at the bar since it was 5pm. An employee promptly greeted us, asked us if we were dining or just in for a drink, and then directed us to the dining portion of the restaurant. There were maybe 3-4 customers in the entire restaurant area. But still, they verified our reservation (even though didn't seem like we needed one), and took us to our table. For whatever reason, in this large place, they sat us all the way out back on the patio. However, our table, and none of the other patio tables were even made. I'm talking no table cloth or even seat cushions. Instead of just having us sitting inside, they had us sit on the semi-rusty chairs at the table while someone got us a table cloth and cushions. Few minutes later, they came by with cloth and cushions (still no place settings however). I don't blame any of this on our waitress, this is all front of house stupidity. But we were finally able to start looking at the menu and ordered drinks. While we were waiting for our drinks, we watched a buss boy go around to each table outside, setting up 1 utensil at a time at all the tables, then doing it again for the next utensil, and so on. One would think that it's common sense that he would have just set our table in full first, and then dealt with all the empty tables. But I guess that's not how they do things in Old Venice. It's the wild wild west of common sense.-After the complete failure of the service thus far, we were hopefully the food would be the saving grace. We got our drinks. 1 of the cocktails was supposed to have muddled strawberries in it. Instead, it was just a few slices of strawberry right out of the packaging. Tasty, but not nearly as exquisite as the description. STRIKE 1. For appetizers, we order the brussel sprouts w/ with prosciutto and the magic mushrooms. The sprouts were insanely bland and not seasoned, the prosciutto was hard as a rock. It's like they didn't even try. All they did was blanch them, cover them in balsamic, and throw some overcooked prosciutto bits on it. STRIKE 2. We enjoy cooking at home and we've made flash fried brussel sprouts. Ours tasted better than these. And that's a problem. You go out for dinner because you want to enjoy a delicious meal that you couldn't otherwise make at home. But at least the brussel sprouts were edible, which is alot more than I could say for the mushrooms. Those things we just bland and unseasoned once again, stuffed, provolone slice thrown on top, and the plate put in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Couldn't even finish them, they were so bad. STRIKE 3.Given all that, we weren't going to waste our money on the rest of the meal. We got our check, paid, and went to Liberty Station for real food. It's mind-blowing that people actually like this place. You could get better service and food at Olive Garden."], ["Jill C.", "We found this place on Yelp and loved it. \u00a0Only thing is, we felt there is a lot of good Italian food for much less money in SD. \u00a0But they seem to have good specials that we will come back for. \u00a0Beautiful ambiance if you are looking for a great date night."], ["Alexis M.", "I went here with my mom and son.

Not sure what his deal was, but we we're totally nice in return. We were then walked through a beautiful main room with white tablecloths, candles and great atmosphere, through the kitchen to the back patio where we were seated on iron chairs with seat cushions you might find on your back patio bistro table set, at your grandmas house. It was cold, the tables were too close together, we heard every word of our neighbors conversation. It seemed like they seated people back there who they did not want in the nice front room. Either people who did not have reservations (which we did!) or people with kids, overweight folks, people with tattoos, younger people (we are mid 20s...you get the idea. When we walked through the front room, it was older middle aged people with suits and dresses. The joke of it is, everyone in the back room with us WAS dressed nice, and we're super nice people. Just a little out of the mainstream compared to the people they sat in the front room. Maybe it was hypersensitive of us to notice this, and unintentional on their part.

They have semi-quiet indoor dining area, a very loud bar area and a semi-quiet-loud outdoor dining area. All of them were pretty full on my visit here, but I didnt take a chance so I'm glad I did a reservation ahead of time.I came in for Restaurant Week and for $30 you get a 3 course meal. And there were a lot of people. I was originally seated in a semi-big table, but when they realized a few minutes later that I was just eating by myself, I was re-assigned to the loner-corner-table. And it was colder since this area didn't have the heat lamps on.Oh well, whatever. Anyways, 3 courses for 30 bucks. I love asparagus so I went with their proscuitto wrapped asparagus. Grilled, with some chopped garlic. Great taste. Also came with some cubed melons too. Not sure how each compliments the other, but whatever.For the main course I went with the chicken florentine over a bed of angel hair pasta. The chicken was stuffed with hot cheese, spinach and mushrooms. Despite the small portion, I was still satisfied after this meal.And for dessert, I went with their Raspberry Napoleon. The wafers were very difficult to cut especially with just a fork as the primary and sole tool for this evolution. But with enough force, I managed to break through and finish this very sweet dessert.Even if you don't come here for dinner, there's a nice bar that they have where you can chillax for a bit.

I sat outside with my lovely company, and we ordered the Anguria salad, Panino del Mattino, pizza insalata, mimosas, and for dessert, their notorious chocolate mousse-like delicacy (the name escapes me).Let's start with the Anguria salad. This refreshing salad contains watermelon as a component and let me tell you: it definitely ties the salad together. Helpful hint: if you like mojitos, this salad is for you. The Panino del Mattino is the bee's knees. This breakfast sandwich consists of sliced hard boiled eggs, delicious pancetta, tomato, and greens, all contained between two slices of delicious panini bread.The pizza insalata is like a delicious salad on a pizza. The mozzarella provides a soft pillow for the fresh tomatoes and baby spinach. The reason I like this pizza above many is because the dough is fresh and it tastes as close to Italy as you can get.Last but not least, the dessert. It's chocolate. It's beautiful. Get it, don't even think twice. Seriously, you will regret not eating it.The service, the atmosphere, and the food. This place has it all.

This is definitely not your typical pizza and I realize some people would add two more stars just for that, so to each his/her own. I wasn't a big fan of the Margherita pizza because it had no sauce. \u00a0I also tried a slice of a custom pepperoni pizza but the pepperoni was too spicy and there wasn't any cheese on it - at least any that I could recognize. Also, unfortunately for me, everything had at least one thing on it that I don't like so it was hard choosing a menu item. I ended up being down with OPP (other people's plates), lol. Oh shut up, I paid the bill, ok? I will say that all of the ingredients tasted very fresh and the effort to present something special was definitely noticeable. On the downside, our waitress was a little aloof, so that didn't help things much. She was very kind and pleasant but wasn't really around much when we needed her. She never came back to check on us unless she was summoned. She had to be waived down from the table several times and we had a really large party so it was a bit awkward. Several water carafes went bone dry during the visit and I really wish we would have been told that the wine was sourced from a family vineyard in Italy. If that fact was on the menu, I guess I missed it while trying to figure out what I wanted to order. I think it should have been verbally highlighted before our order was taken.I think I would go back for happy hour or for an another occasion.with my wife - who loved the place. So did the birthday girl. Both left very positive reviews."], ["Mari M.", "Visited Isola for the first time on Veterans Day. We went to enjoy the free Margherita pizza.

Luckily, Isola delivered! We started with a glass of cabernet, then moved on to the pizzas (perfect balance of delicious crust, tangy sauce, rich mozzarella and fragrant basil) before heading off to meet a friend. We were in and out within an hour, which is always a bonus. While we ate outside, the interior is warm and cozy, perfect for a relaxed meal for groups of friends.

Very swag and swanky interior and, the mens restroom was designed by a person who knows what a man wants.I retuned to my seat to find my house merlot waiting and our waiter ready to take our orders. We opted for two pizzas and I wanted to try their pasta which had a vegetable called Rapini, something I never tried before. During our meals, I round tabled my families thoughts on their meals and the verdict was pretty unanimous. The food here is average. I did like the restaurants modern looks and cleanliness. And i really enjoyed the Rapini but, I don't think i will be retuning here to dine anytime soon."], ["Mac W.", "Little Italy has several pizza restaurants/shops, many of them are good but this is hands down my favorite. It's located in the heart of Little Italy right off of India. \u00a0You can sit on the front patio, inside, or the back patio. I recommend the back patio especially if the weather is nice, which it is 95% of the time. \u00a0The back patio has a cute Alice in Wonderland feel. I love the hanging lights and greenery surrounding it.Now on to the food. Apps: get the Brussel Sprouts ($10) and the burrata mozzarella ($12) and upgrade to the prosciutto (extra $4). I love Brussel sprouts and these are especially tasty. Who can resist wood fired Brussels?! The bruschetta here is also super tasty. I have tried the original ($6) and the pomodoro fresco ($8) and again do yourself a favor and add the mozzarella and prosciutto for an additional ($4). It's worth it! I went with some friends and made them order their own because I didn't want to share. \u00a0I have only tried the pizzas here but will be back for the pasta soon. My favorites are the margheritta ($12) and spicy salami ($16). The pizzas are big enough for 2 people to share."], ["Nikita J.", "Went again and got to meet the manager/partial owner of this establishment (Alonso). He went out of his way to make our dining experience extraordinary! This place is his life and he is so clearly passionate about it. His love for the food, his customers, and this industry was made apparent in just one dining experience.Alonso explained how the flour they use for their pizza comes all the way from Naples! As well as their pizza oven! All the way from Naples!?! Their pizza chef comes straight from Italy and is under contract... they brought him here from Italy just to make us amazing pizza! Evidently he was born and breed to make pizza has been training since he was very young (they take their pizza very seriously) letting the dough rise for two days before being molded into the amazing thin crust pizzas they are so famous for. They also serve wine from their families Vineyard which we had the opportunity to try and it was divine! As well the chocolate mousse like dessert that changed my life! I can't find the right name for it anywhere but it was incredible! A chocolate mousse with salted caramel and a whipped cream that brought me to the moon and back. It was almost too hard to share! I work at a hotel and when anyone asks for a recommendation I send them here. I've had such great feed back! They loved it, I loved it, you will too... Go nuts."], ["Aleisha G.", "GREAT happy hour!! Definitely recommend this place if you like quality wine & italian food. The bruschetta burrata along with a glass of red wine..yum yum amazing combo! The bruschetta is a simple appetizer but they take it up about 20 notches...I come here solely for this item!The cheese plate is also a winner. I'd also recommend their salad as it pairs well with everything.I wouldn't say that their pizza is my favorite but I'm just not a huge fan of burnt crust pizza.The staff is always very helpful, attentive and asks around for finals orders before happy hour ends which is a plus.This place is definitely worth trying and the prices are phenomenal (particularly happy hour).

We had bruschetta, pizza, wine and dessert. The bruschetta was substantial and filling. The pizza had the highly desirable charred crust and delicious fresh ingredients to compliment. The wine list had good variety, and we were pointed by our server to a light and very drinkable white to complement our pizza choice. They got points in my book for their fresh daily desserts--which is key for a good tiramisu. We had both the tiramisu and a gelato. The gelato was a little icy, but the tiramisu was perfect."], ["Christina T.", "Come here for the Happy Hour if you can! 3-6pm every day, so it's pretty legit and worth checking out if only for the Margherita pizza. It's a great date-y spot with stiff drinks and plenty of small plates to share.- Margherita pizza: a generous individual portion topped with basil and pillows of mozzarella cheese on a bed of tomato sauce. I am normally not a fan of tomato sauce on pizza as the flavor masks the toppings, however their tomato sauce is very fresh and light. A steal at $5 for a wood-fired pizza!- Bruschetta burrata & carciofini: the burrata cheese is very creamy (reminiscent of goat cheese!) - Gambaretti alla 'nduja: wood-fired jumbo-sized shrimp, sausage and fresh herbs - delicious. the descrpition speaks for itself.We ended our early dinner with dessert, three scoops of gelato with a waffle chip to share. I'm a fan of the mixed berry sorbet, although I'm not sure if the gelato flavors change daily.The ambiance is a bit romantic with candles lighting up each table and the vibe is more cozy and homey, as opposed to an upscale steakhouse.

My only request is to add a Benedict dish to the menu!"], ["Mel J.", "Holy smokes! Isola Pizza Bar is a good place to taste hand-tossed, Napoli style pizzas, baked in a stone, wood-burning oven. The kitchen gets quite smoky, and since it's an open kitchen, you can see them hand-tossing the dough and using the big red cheese grinder. I enjoyed the Pizza with \"arugula con l'uovo\" for $15 on the regular dinner menu., although it was a little bland for me. This is a mild-tasting pizza with mozzarella and parmigiano, truffle oil, panna and pancetta, and topped with an egg and arugula. This pizza doesn't have any sauce. The crust is a hand-tossed Napoli style thin crust made with doppio zero flour, and while it's a good crust, for me, it falls short of perfection when it develops a few burnt black bubbles on the crust, which occurred on both of my visits. I mostly scraped these black bubbles off my crust, but I did get a bit of it on my tongue, and an unpleasant charcoal-like taste lingered on my tongue for a while after I finished my dinner.Happy hour is excellent and crazy cheap at Isola. If your read my previous review, you'll flip over deals like the $5 pizza Margherita and the $4 Gamberetti ala 'nduja (shrimp). Vino is $5 a glass at happy hour. My glass of Sangiovese for $8 was a pleasing red wine. A sign on the wall says that the wines come from the owner's brother's vineyards.BEWARE of the door to the ladies bathroom, which is in a public area, and doesn't have a good lock! I hope they fix this soon. The ladies room has only 1 toilet. The lock is one of those simple buttons on the door knob. You push in the button. This type of lock is unreliable. Two staff members said that this door sticks sometimes, so several times the staff tried to shove the bathroom door open for waiting customers to use, but unfortunately, there was somebody inside the bathroom, and on one occasion, the staff member burst open the bathroom door on a customer. Oopsie. Dear owner, please fix that door.If Isola Pizza Bar can make me a pizza without the black bubbles in the crust, and if they fix the door to the ladies room, I'd add another star to my review. The 2 pizzas I've tried, the Margherita and the pizza with arugula con l'uovo, are fairly tasty, but a little bland for me. If I return, I'd like a pizza with more pizzaz...maybe more garlic and spices, and a flavorful sauce."], ["Jesse C.", "Are you in town and craving some good Italian food and good wine at a place with a laid back atmosphere without breaking the bank?

The second appetizer was their house made focaccia bread or bruschetta original, that was a perfect compliment to the octopus. The bread was cooked in their brick oven which is where they bake their pizzas and gives it that crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside texture.

I did, but didn't care for the sample, so she asked about my preferences (bourbon, mezcal, Malbec, port... turns out I just like burnt sugar and alcohol), and she opened another bottle that I did enjoy, a Barbera d'Alba Bricco Cichetta from the Pietro Rinaldi winery, owned by Tenino's brother.Now I had my drink picked out, and soon, my wife arrived, so we moved to the dining area. I was concerned that the little table we were given might not be sturdy and that the chairs might be uncomfortable, but neither thing was a problem.Our waiter was engaging and charming and spoke with a melodious Italian accent. I thought about sending him away and ordering dinner from the bar, since who needs that kind of competition at dinnertime? But when I realized that my Beloved was more focused on the menu than on Fabio, I relaxed and we made our selections.Because it was early, we cobbled together an order from both the Happy Hour and dinner menus, saving a few bucks along the way. We had:- Gamberetti Alla 'Nduja. Wood-fired shrimp, spicy 'nduja sausage, fresh herbs. $4This was a tasty dish, mixing shrimp with my new love, the spicy 'nduja, which itself combines \"poor cuts\" of pork, like jowls and bellies, tripe and oh, yeah, fat, with fiery Calabrian chilis to make a sort of pate. Think Mexican chorizo, or Scrapple. - Pizza Margherita. Tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil. $5This is my Beloved's go-to pizza, sort of her benchmark item for Italian places that serve it. The pizza was cooked perfectly, which is to say light and chewy around the edges, slightly charred underneath and moist (not soggy) in the center. The sauce provided fresh, bright flavor, and was not oversalted.- Salamino Piccante. Spicy salame, mozzarella, tomato, fresh basil, parmigiano. $15As if the 'nduja wasn't hot enough. This pizza was the real saltimbocca (jumps in the mouth), having the same great sauce and crust as the Margherita, and adding a wonderful hot salame that was sliced just thick enough to be pleasant to bite through. I wish I'd thought to ask for a whole egg on top of this pie; the yolk would have perfected the dish.Finally, let me mention that Isola's Happy Hour prices are nuts. For those of you keeping score, our meal cost $24. It was like having dinner at Crazy Massimo's House of Discount Goodness. My advice: take advantage of the great prices right away, before Tenino's accountant calls, telling him to shut that sh*t down."], ["Jesse C.", "Regrettably, I cannot comment on how good the pizza at Isola is because we opted for something else.

I love the decor, the vibe, the candlelight. Secondly, service is on point. There are so many workers. Plates are bussed immediately when you're done with a dish. Someone else brings you fresh plates and utensils for your next course. Someone is always there to refill your water before you can even turn around to ask someone.

What we ordered:Octopus appetizer - A perfect blend of juicy, tender octopus, sliced potatoes, onions, etc. Loved the sauce. Salamino Piccante - Our server said this is the most popular pizza on the menu. OK, we'll try it. Thank god we did because this pizza is a slice of heaven. It's got a perfect amount of heat. I absolutely love the tomato sauce (not too saucy) and the texture of the pizza dough/crust. This pizza was divine. I can't imagine ever coming back to Isola and not ordering this pizza each and every time. Love, love, love this pizza to the moon and back. SO GOOD!!Arugula con l'uovo - I loved the bacon, truffle oil and yolky farm egg. This pizza was good but the Salamino Piccante definitely overshadowed this pie. Complimentary dessert, the Chocolate, Salted Caramel Budino - complimentary?? Who doesn't love complimentary? I'm not a chocolate fan but the boyfriend devoured it within minutes.

The pizza itself was undercooked and doughy. All of the ingredients seemed fresh / good but unfortunately the crust being so undercooked took away from the experience.

With sausage and some delicious cheese, it's a great option to share. When I return I'll order two pizzas and split each, with a little leftover. There are so many on the menu and they all look yummy!"], ["Sandra V.", "I love the Happy Hour at Isola and go often. A lot of locals make Isola as their go to place to hang out and talk to friends.

The Burrata Bruschetta isn't on the regular dinner menu, I think it's on the happy hour menu, but it's available any time so just ask. The bread is about double the size of typical bruschetta pieces, and perfectly toasted so that the inner bread was still soft. And the tiramisu! I've never been a fan of it, but here I am! It was big enough for 3 of us to share. Ambiance is casual but fancy. It's more of a \"let's have dinner and catch up\" with friends and less of a first date sort of place.Other stuff that sounded great, but was just good...Gamberetti alla diavola - shrimp with a white wine garlic and caper sauce. It was too bland. The wood roasted veggies with goat cheese and roasted garlic. I like rustic but this was a little too much. Veggies were too tough and I wish the garlic was peeled more"], ["Samantha W.", "The bruschetta was full of flavor & the bread was just the right amount of crisp! The margerita pizza was excellent!

Everything we ordered was spot on. Friendly staff and a nice wine Wednesday menu."], ["Gary R.", "I was really excited when a friend suggested that we try Isola, a local Italian restaurant mere steps from where I live. I've been passively observing the rave reviews over the last year or so. Well, this past Sunday the opportunity finally presented itself for three of us to pop in and check things out for ourselves.We walked in around 8pm and business was very light. We had our choice of outdoor or indoor seating, of which we opted to escape the cool, brisk breeze and sit in Isola's comfy, warm dining room. The dining space is quite lovely, characterized by an updated, contemporary aesthetic that I found charming. All of us were absolutely famished. In fact, we wanted to order practically everything on the menu, but we finally settled on starting with,SALUMI MISTI ($14) -- an assortment of salami and other cured meats, olives, artichokes, and roasted bell peppers. \u00a0Fabulous! We all gushed over this dish. Everything was gobbled up in no time. \u00a0A lovely antipasti option that I would recommend and order again. POLIPO ($12) -- Octopus. A bit too rubbery. Seasoning and flavor was lacking. It's certainly not the worst octopus dish I've had, but there was nothing about it that would inspire me to order it again. VERDURE AL FORNO SALAD ($11) - We were in the mood to share salad, and the roasted vegetables and other ingredients in this one sounded wonderful. We had no idea, however, we were getting a warm salad; I assumed the roasted veggies would be cool or at least at room temperature. That's our bad for assuming and not giving more thoughtful attention to the menu. Honestly, though, the salad wasn't very good. The veggies lacked seasoning, and the warm goat cheese just didn't quite work to salvage its flat flavor. The accompanying bagna cauda dressing was near unpalatable to me; its texture and taste was dreadfully off-putting.For our main entrees, we opted to share three of Isola's pizzas:BROCCOLI RAAB ($16) -- I love broccoli raab and was looking forward to its personality on this pizza. Sadly, this pizza was disappointing, to say the least. \u00a0While I typically love the bitterness of broccoli raab, there was nothing on the pizza to counter its presence. Even the fennel sausage couldn't balance it. Additionally, the crust was charred to the point that I could taste burned bits in almost every bite. I normally don't shy away from minor charring, but this was just too much. I could have asked for some Parmesan and red pepper flakes to give it a little life, but after one slice I decided to move on. EGGPLANT PARMESAN -- I may be incorrect on the name of this pizza, but it was one of their only options where eggplant was the predominant theme. \u00a0Again, we were really excited to eat this. Unfortunately, again, this pizza was one-note, lacking flavor. Moreover, the texture was not enjoyable; the toppings sat on the crust like a primordial blob of goo. SALAMINO PICCANTE ($15) -- This was the most enjoyable pizza of the night, folks. The spicy salame, mozzarella, basil, and all of the other ingredients melded together perfectly. Everyone loved this. After eating a slice of this selection I was sorry I wasted my calories and available stomach space on the other two.Two of my dining companions expressed concern that the wait staff were too eager to take our food away from us before we had signaled to them that we were done. I did notice that they were a bit too ambitious in that regard. The waiter didn't appear to be very friendly, either.Overall, we were all very disenchanted. I was generously treated to a meal here, and when someone I care about spends a lot of money on a dining experience that has a net result of being grossly substandard, it makes me very sad and upset. Unfortunately, we likely won't be returning to Isola when there are just too many other options in Little Italy where we've had much more pleasurable experiences."], ["Wana L.", "Great food and service! \u00a0Came here for a Yelp event and recently for happy hour with some colleagues. \u00a0Ambiance is beautiful and when the sun sets, the lights get dim inside providing the perfect romantic atmosphere. \u00a0I would recommend it as a great date night.

The margherita though simple is oh-so good! The sauce is incredibly flavorful. But the bruschetta burrata is a must try! There are so many unique and delicious flavors mixed together for one perfect bite. The prosciutto! The burrata! Oh my! It's $4 during happy hour.

So, while downtown this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I stopped in to grab some of this pizza this uber driver raved about. He was right. I loved it. I got two pizzas, the arugula and prosciutto one and the one with spicy salami and basil (I can't remember the names exactly and I'm not looking it up...you'll know which ones they are once you see the menu). Both were delicious - I love the smoky flavor on the crust from the wood burning stove. The spicy salami was a little too spicy for my taste - but I'm kind of a baby when it comes to spicy food, but even though it was spicy, I still ate half of it! The arugula pizza - loved it, couldn't get enough of it. I'm excited to come back here for date night and try the wine from the owner's brother's winery in Italy. I want to say I'll try their other menu items - that looked amazing too - but honestly, I'll probably just keep trying the other pizzas I wanted to on Sunday. Aside from the food - the staff was extremely friendly and the waiter even took some time for me to describe the wine to me and which he would recommend for future visits with certain menu items. We weren't even seated - we got our order to go. The hostess who took our order was also so sweet and very helpful.

I am also super impressed with the fact that it's a family owned (as it should be, it's the italian way) business and loved the fact that they also own a family vineyard and sell their wine in house.

The salame was amazing and paired well the mozzarella accompanied with basil and parmigiana. The customer service was TERRIBLE. Our waiter took our order and after we received the food NEVER CAME BACK. Never asked how we were doing or asked to refresh our drinks. I had to ask a random server/busser? To look for our waiter.

Any place that has something sparkling on their happy hour menu is my kind of place. The bruschetta burrata & carciofini is absolutely out of this world. You get two slices of good sized bruschetta piled high too. Highly recommend their pizza margherita too. This isn't a little mini pizza, this is a legit sized pizza for only $5. Great flavor and crunchy thin crust. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.It definitely gets busier the later you go so keep that in mind.

Due to the extreme lack of service, I have to split the difference with three stars. Five stars for the food and one for the service. Let's start with the positives. My gnocchi was quite possibly the best thing that I have ever tasted. From the tender gnocchi to the flavorful pink sauce, the dish was perfection. Even the leftovers reheated nicely and I was able to enjoy the dish for two days. Granted, I'm a rather light eater and heavier eaters could likely finish this amazing dish in one sitting. My boyfriend also loved his eggplant parmesan. He described it has being a lighter version of the dish since the breading was almost non-existent but in a good way. He thought it was one of the better eggplant parmesans that he's had at a restaurant. The complimentary bread and marinara were also amazing and we quickly ate the entire loaf while we waited and waited and waited...which brings me to the downside of the meal.We arrived at 6:15 and shortly after were brought water glasses and the bread. Then we waited and watched as several other tables were seated after us and placed their orders before us. This entire time, no one came to check on us or ask if we were ready to order. Around 6:45, my boyfriend flagged down a busboy and asked him to get a waiter for us because we were ready to order. It took another 15 minutes for a waiter to appear. We almost walked out of the restaurant before ordering because it was getting so ridiculous. I understand if the restaurant is busy, which it was, but I don't understand other tables that are seated after us being served before us and us being completely ignored for 45 minutes! I'd love to go back to Pomodoro to get the gnocchi again but I think it will take a lot of convincing to get my boyfriend to give them another try. On the plus side, I love that they have a dog friendly patio though!"], ["Jaylene C.", "We decided to try out this Italian restaurant for lunch. We got lucky with parking as there was one spot open on the lot of the restaurant. There's only 2-3 restaurant spots, the rest are all nearby/street parking. The restaurant has an open, spacious layout but, we can see how the seating arrangements can be quite close when the restaurant is full. The staff was nice, but service was extremely slow. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. It appears there was only one guy working the floor. Perhaps they were short staffed due to the restaurant just opening for the day and it was lunch time? But, our waiter took a long time to come by and take our order. There weren't a lot of people. There were only 3 parties, including us and there were no more than 4 people per party. \u00a0It then took a little longer to get our water and bread/butter. Our bread was a little warm and didn't seem fresh. The butter had a bit of a weird taste to it. We had to get up and get our own olive oil and vinegar to dip the bread in as it was never offered to us. It took even longer to get our food. We were expecting to get piping hot, freshly made food, but it was barely warm by the time our dishes reached our table. We ordered two items which we thought were pretty expensive for being off of a lunch menu. We ordered the Gnocchi Tre Sorrentina which is their homemade potato dumplings with tomato sauce and melted mozzarella. The dumplings seemed a little on the dense/heavy side, but at least they weren't too chewy. We also ordered the homemade Ravioli stuffed with portobello mushrooms & ricotta cheese in a porcini cream sauce. The Ravioli was good, but not amazing. The food was just... OK.

And as the occasion was the Friday date night w/ the boyfie, Dean Martin's \"That's Amore\" began playing softly in my head and served as the soundtrack for the night. Perhaps it was due to Pomodoro's effortlessly romantic ambience...or perhaps it was just the only Italianish song I could think of, but nonetheless, I really enjoyed the relaxed feel of the restaurant.FOODWOW. We really enjoyed everything we ordered. I had the squid ink seafood pasta & though I was expecting it to be all black & inky, it arrived looking a lot less intimidating. The pasta noodles were the only thing that was a bit darker than usual, but it complemented the pasta sauce well as it was flavorful & creamy. The portions were average, but I couldn't finish it since we also ordered some apps.The minestrone was pretty good, but not fantastic. I wish there could have been little pasta shells in it as well, though maybe I'm just Americanized and that's not how true minestrone is supposed to be. It tasted fairly unique and unlike most minestrone soups I've had, which was a nice surprise.The boyfie ordered caprese salad, as that's his go-to anywhere he goes. The ingredients were very fresh, though the flavor was a bit lacking. Could have used some balsamic vinaigrette or something similar as opposed to just virgin olive oil.The bread was a-ok, but not extraordinary. I believe it might have been focaccia?Highlight was the squid ink pasta b/c so few Italian restaurants offer that dish & it's always been one of my all-time fave dishes, so ordering it here was a real treat! The boyfie ordered pork shanks for his entree, and it was well-prepared & flavorful, though he felt that the portion could've been larger...then again (don't tell him I said this, but he can never really be satisfied with the amount of meat he orders...haha, men!) this could've just been opinion.Overall, excellent! No complaints! I want to come back & try dessert though!!SERVICEAs we were having our Lady & the Tramp moment eating dinner (jk...jk...haha my imagination is running wild again), the server would come by here and there to refill our waters/ask if we wanted more wine/grab our dishes/etc etc just the right amount.The best part??

Again, portion was so huge (even after my friends each had a taste) I took leftovers home and enjoyed it for dinner. Friends enjoyed sea bass w/pasta, and squid ink pasta with seafood -- as did I since I tasted them both. We shared a strawberry Napoleon and it was so enjoyable I would have enjoyed at least half to myself.Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. Friendly, cordial, good service. If I lived any closer I would be eating here regularly."], ["Mayel H.", "I made a reservation for 6pm yesterday. When I made the reservation I informed them that it was my 3 year old daughter's birthday. When I arrived I was told that it would be a 20-30 min wait but it could be longer. So around 7:00pm we were seated ordered our food and started to eat around 8:00pm. Service was horrible,food was just okay and I will not be returning to this restaurant. It's very obvious that they overbooked and all they kept saying was I'm sorry."], ["Calvin H.", "After only coming here once, this is one of my favorite Italian places in town. The atmosphere makes it feel like an authentic cozy Italian restaurant, complete with Italian speaking staff (or they're really good at doing accents). I really felt like I was eating a home cooked meal.The Bread:I'm all about the carbs so I welcome the basket of complimentary bread. It seems like it comes to your table fresh from the oven as it's warm and soft. Even better is that it comes with a side of marinara to dip.Appetizers:The minestrone soup was interesting as it had no pasta but the mix of vegetables was excellent. The soup had good flavor and was not too salty. The caprice salad consisted of two slices of regular tomatoes and one slice heirloom tomato. Each topped with a sliced of fresh mozzarella, pepper and olive oil and garnished with fresh basil. I tend to enjoy my caprice salad with balsamic vinegar but this one didn't need it.Entrees:Black Pasta - The linguine is made with squid ink which gives it an excellent taste as well as a black look. The sauce itself is a white buttery sauce. This one is chalked full of delicious seafood.Osso Buco - A huge pork shank on a bed of risotto. The pork was cooked to perfection and very tender, falling off the bone and the sauce was excellent. This is definitely the dish to get when you've got a big appetite."], ["Ellie D.", "We stumbled upon this gem accidentally! What caught our eye was the brightly lit sign outside. We turned the rental car around and headed for this restaurant. We made an excellent decision!I live in NJ, where local Italian restaurants are everywhere. Many of them very good. That being said, I must say that the marinara sauce I tasted at Pomodoro's was hands down the best marinara sauce I have ever tasted. My partner and I devoured the entire cup of sauce provided with the bread. The bread itself was fresh and \"good\" bread. Not the kind where a place pretends they are serving real Italian bread and really aren't.The contadino salad was fresh and I love that organic greens are used.The pollo empoli was delicious! The chicken was of good quality and the tomato sauce was incredible. I'm not one to dip bread onto my plate to clean it, but if we still had bread on the table, I would have. It was THAT good.I love the atmosphere of this restaurant...how it looks like a house converted into a restaurant, with seating partially outside. The owners clearly care about attention to details and ensured it is decorated thoughtfully and invitingly. I felt warm and fuzzy and like I was in Italy.Pomodoro, you are my \"go-to\" restaurant that I must revisit when I'm in the area again. By far, this was the best restaurant I ate at in California thus far. Bravo for a job well done!"], ["K D.", "Ordered Eggplant Parmigiana, which was really good, very less cheese and with lot of tomato sauce, enjoyed it. Also ordered Linguine al Pesto, I usually enjoy the Pesto sauce, but didn't like it here.Ordered Minestrone soup, which had chicken broth in it, so I couldn't have it, hubby enjoyed the soup, he liked it. I didn't like the taste of tomato sauce which came with the free bread."], ["Nina S.", "This restaurant will have a special place in my heart. Mainly because this was where my then-boyfriend took me for dinner right before he proposed at Shelter Island. It is a cute restaurant that has outdoor seating, which was pretty nice during summer during the evening. We started off with calamari fritti. The plate consisted of fried calamari and fried zucchini. It was lightly battered and crunchy. I really liked it. I really enjoyed their pork osso bucco. The meat fell off the bone easily. It was very tender and the flavors made it absolutely delicious. The portions were so big, I barely finished and had to take the rest to-go. However, even when I reheated it at home, it still tasted amazing. This is probably one of my favorite places to get pork osso bucco. Their smoke salmon ravioli was absolutely delicious and flavorful as well. The caviar on top complimented the ravioli very well and gave it extra flavor. I really wanted to try the desserts but was too stuffed. I'll probably skip the appetizer and get dessert next time!"], ["Lisa T.", "We chose to eat here from the reviews that we read on here. It was a Monday night and chilly out side so the crowd was light. We had a fantastic waiter who took very good care of us. My husband ordered the pork Oso Bucco, it was decadent and a huge portion. I unfortunately should have gone with something more traditional but instead I ordered the risotto Nero- definitely not for the week at heart and certainly not for the person who doesn't LOVE seafood! The risotto was drenched in squid ink and it was very strong! I didn't want to be rude but every part of me wanted to send it back and say \"just kidding\" I will have the eggplant. I was disappointed that I didn't suggest that we get a couple of appetizers and split the Oso Bucco that was big enough for the both of us! On a sweet note we ordered the strawberry Napoleon and although my hubby seemed to like it, I'm more of a tiramisu gal. Overall the atmosphere was great, the service was great, the hot bread and marinara were phenomenal earning them 4 stars!!!"], ["Chris G.", "I had heard so many good things about this place and was so happy I was finally able to try it. We went on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't crowded at all. As soon as you walked in you are hit with multiple wonderful Italian kitchen aromas. It reminded me of my fianc\u00e9 or her mom's kitchen when they make meatballs and Sunday sauce.The atmosphere reminds me of an Italian kitchen. Warm and welcoming with bit of romance. The staff is really friendly and funny. Very honest about any questions you may have about the menu. The bread and dipping sauce are so good. The tomato sauce has a little spice that gives you a little kick at the end if a bite. Just enough to make you want another bite and then maybe another. The menu is really big with tons of options. My fianc\u00e9 and I split a Caesar salad to start. It was huge and delicious...probably could have been split 4 ways. I went with the osso bucco and I definitely didn't regret it. The meat was do tender and full of flavors. My fianc\u00e9 got the rigatoni with a cream sauce that was really good.I'm not sure what dessert the table next to us got but wow did it smell good. I have to remember not to eat so much next time so I can try it. I will be back!"], ["Dub M.", "This is one of the best, most authentic Italian places in San Diego. I can't say much that's not already been said, but when I eat here I feel like at any second Al Pacino could stand up and shoot a corrupt cop.I highly recommend the linguine di mar with tomato based sauce, the homemade ravioli, and extra bread dip sauce.You know you're gonna like a place when you can't understand the waiter and you're treated with some RESPECT. I know it was you, Fredo - you broke my heart - you broke my heart!"], ["Gaby S.", "This place is a gem. Best food ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have not eaten anything as good as what I ate here. I was in a party of 11 and we all ordered different plates and tried a little bit of everything. The chocolate pudding is to die for and even better than sex. Maybe not but close."], ["Mary T.", "Love Pomodoro! One of my favorite Italian restaurants. The food is consistently good and the portions are huge! My favorite dish is the pork ossobuco - definitely enough food for 2 people. The meat is fall off the bone tender and the risotto it comes with is bursting with flavor. Everything I've ordered here has been delicious! Expect to leave here absolutely stuffed and satisfied."], ["Ernesto C.", "We had high expectations and left a bit disappointed. \u00a0Whilst the locale ( perfect lighting & layout/decor) is nice and service very attentive, the food fell way short.I think it is perfect for someone on holiday that is in SD happy pill mode and not very discerning with matters of the palate. \u00a0I want to say it is akin to Little Italy food in NYC - tourism cuisine.Our bruschetta was nice but a bit over the top on garlic. \u00a0The anchovies with arugula were nice ( more so Spanish style vs 'ala moda pasesano Italiano ) and also a bit heavy on the garlic.Her - the Milanese: bland and somewhat tasteless. \u00a0Me \u00a0- the Parmigiana - sugary sweet sauce, nothing acidic to balance the flavors......a single or double at best, not even close to third base or homeplate. \u00a0She passed on desert. \u00a0I chomped on Orbit Bubblemint gum on the way home for a refresh...Highly recommended for the tourist circuit but not for those seeking Mamma's sauce and home cooked delicacies. \u00a0Mind you, the staff is overwhelmingly Italian but that just is not enough to tip the scales past average, at best."], ["Chris K.", "Fantastic, can't say enough!! Great service, Michael is so friendly and knows every dish on the menu by heart. The location is great, setting is rustic, homey, comforting and beautiful. Like a wonderful meal at home with friends and family. The artichokes were so flavorful and great with the bread. Enough for 3 or maybe 4 people of you want to keep it lights, lots of butter Our main dishes were delicious. My wife had one of their home made pasta dishes and it was really great. The sauce and meat and pasta were all so well done and a great combination. The standout, though, was my pork ossobuco, which was heavenly. Served with a mushroom risotto, I got it on Michaels recommendation and I would get it again. So tender and perfectly combined with the risotto. \u00a0We had the tiramisu for dessert and if you've got the room left over or you can split it with 3 or 4, it's a big plate, then do yourself a favor and try it. I love tiramisu and this is a great one!Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!"], ["Quynh N.", "My boyfriend and I came from for dinner for the first try. This restaurant is AMAZING. I haven't ever written the review for anywhere before, but this time, the food here is ABSOLUTELY blow me. I'm so impressed of it despite of the small area. Will come back again!!!"], ["Molly W.", "Teeny little place - I'm glad I made a reservation in advance. We were shocked that it was so empty but in about 20 minutes or so the place was packed! The service is very friendly and FAST, the food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is adorable. There's wine decking the halls from floor to ceiling, which made me quite thirsty but sadly I had to decline since I'm pregnant. =PMy husband ordered Farfalle Salmone e Vodka, and I ordered Orecchiete Pugliesi. BEST. CHOICE. EVER. I haven't been this blown away by restaurant food in a long time.Antipasti: Buratta - wilted spinach and just-cooked cherry tomatoes with soft, fresh mozzarella. We sliced it up, dipped our (obviously made from scratch and quite tasty) bread in the tomato sauce, then loaded it with the buratta. Yum yum. :)His: Tender, fresh, flaky salmon in a light, creamy tomato vodka sauce and bowtie pasta. Everything tasted divine together. He paired it with chardonnay and the flavors complemented each other well. He just about licked his plate clean.Mine: Orecchiete pasta in a garlicy white wine sauce and sausage, rapini, and tomatoes. It was divine. The garlic flavor was omnipresent in a way that made me swoon, but it wasn't overpowering. Just the right about of nuttiness and bite. I've had rapini that makes me gag - theirs was just right. I would have loved to clear my plate, but as I'm 8 months pregnant, I had to tackle my food in batches and ended up taking the rest home with me.Tiramisu was dessert - I heard good things about it but I guess I'm just not a fan of it. But everything else was great.Long story short I'm really happy we found this place and I'd love to come back again!"], ["Allie S.", "This place has wonderful food! It feels very quaint. The restaurant is a converted home with outdoor, covered seating. There's a patio with a tin roof and a fire pit. Very cute atmosphere! The waiters and hostesses all seem to speak Italian, so it feels authentic as well. I've been here twice and sampled a very good amount of their food between the two trips. I had bites of everyone's food. I'd recommend everything except the veal Parmesan. It tasted a little like a chicken fried steak from a diner :( but everything else was delicious, delicious, delicious! They only have wine and beer (no hard liquor) which is absolutely not a problem for me, but I thought I'd let you all know ;)My only other tiny complaint is that I feel they're under wait-staffed for dinner hours, so the service can be pretty slow"], ["Roger W.", "I hate to give out the secret to Pomodoro as its food is off the Chart good. Come Early 5:00-6:30pm is the key. Sit anywhere you want, enjoy the setting sun and have full attention of their waiters, cooks and staff. As it gets more crowded the service slows down as expected. We have fantastic meals and service every time when we come early."], ["Katherine S.", "~$14-17 for a main dish Favorites: Calamari Fritti and the Pappardelle This place is definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants! There is indoor and patio seating, and the entire restaurant is dimly lit- perfect for dates (crowdedddd on Valentine's Day). There's a large selection of food, so you can definitely bring a selective eater here. They always bring out bread and red sauce for you after you've ordered. My tip? Ask them to heat up the red sauce!!! It tastes that much better ;) I've also tried the Strozipretti, the lobster pasta and the salmon pasta and they were all delicious as welllll. I for sure will be coming back for more! The service wasn't horrible or great- very much so whatevers. This place is known for their Napoleon cake. Im not too big on desserts, but it was pretty good! It's homemade, which always deserves extra points! The parking isn't great... You have to find parking on the streets but this restaurant is worth it! ^_^"], ["Roberto J.", "Just came in today for my anniversary with my fianc\u00e9 and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!!!This is a nice cozy Italian restaurant that makes you feel like you're on a corner of Italy. The bread with marinara to start was amazing!I had the Linguini di Mare with white wine sauce. It was absolutely a great dish. The customer service is just as good as the food. Estela was a great hostess that made us feel at home and made sure we loved every bit of our experience at Pomodoro's. If the owner is reading this all I have to say is she definitely deserves a raise! Prices are reasonably priced.If you're in San Diego and want the best customer service, Italian food, and prices, look no further.

We watched several tables be seated and served before anyone even came over to our table to take our order. I checked the time and it took 45 minutes from the time we sat down until a waiter appeared. This was even 15 minutes after I flagged down a busboy to ask if we could order and he said he would send a waiter over right away. The restaurant was busy but the fact that I watched other tables that were seated after us be served first makes it unacceptable. I came very close to walking out of the restaurant without even eating. However, because I stayed and the eggplant parmesan was so good, I'm willing to give them two stars instead of the one star I had originally planned."], ["Kelly T.", "Food was ok. I would've rather had Olive Garden and I'm not a fan of Olive Garden so that is saying a lot. I wasn't paying the bill so I can't comment on prices. Service was extremely slow even though \u00a0the restaurant was not busy at all. Although a simple request, I asked for a wedge of lemon three times and never received it. Bread basket was a nice touch but bread was a bit stale. I had the risotto which was creamy and it had 5 shrimp that were a bit overcooked. Husband had the lasagna as did my father-in-law which was basic. Kids tried spaghetti and meatballs - youngest wouldn't eat it but the older child (8) did. (Heads up for parents) They do not have a kids menu, nor did they have lemonade or apple juice.

I had the portobello stuffed ravioli with a porcini mushroom sauce and it was the best mushroom ravioli I've ever had! My husband got the rib eye which came with a mushroom topping the steak was very tender and yummy too. And when you order a glass of wine you actually get a nice glass not the 1/4 glass most places serve you. And the prices are not bad either !"], ["Jon Q.", "Just about the cutest Italian casual restaurant you will find. They have a large outdoor dining area that is masterfully decorated for the type of ambience they are trying to create. Strangely, all the staff here had Italian accents. I'm not sure if they were real or not, but it was kind of cool. \u00a0So far, I was excited to be here given the great yelp rating this place has. In the end, I ended up being a little disappointed. The food was good, but nothing to write home about. \u00a0In fact some of the dishes were memorable for the wrong reasons. \u00a0We ordered a few dishes and shared them. That evening, we sampled:D'Anatra salad - smoked duck breast, spinach, pine nuts, raisins, and bacon. - Sounds so good right? It was a little disappointing. The duck was not very good. \u00a0A little on the dry side and it didn't stand apart from the weak flavors of the salad. It was just a very plain tasting salad.Spaghetti Carbonara - Carbonara is good. This was no exception. The spaghetti was al dente and the carobonara was rich, creamy, and flavorful. The pancetta was perfect in preparation and portion. \u00a0It was a really good dish.Linguine di Mare: The linguine was cooked perfectly and the seafood was cooked just right. Aside from that, it was underwhelming. The white wine sauce was dull and really sank the dish. \u00a0It was a totally forgettable dish, except I can't forget how bland it was.Pollo arrotolato - Chicken breast rolled and stuffed with ricotta cheese and spinach in a mushroom sauce. Like the linguine, this was very bland. The chicken offered little texture and kind of blended in with the soft ricotta, which was not very pleasant. The mushroom sauce was good, so it was confusing that it didn't really pick up much with the chicken. \u00a0Dissapointing.Fettucine Piemonte - This was pretty good. The mushroom sauces here are good. The pasta was cooked perfectly in every dish we had, so it was nice that it was paired with a really good sauce. I liked it a lot.Tiramisu - It was good. Your standard tiramisu. I just have to learn not to inhale it, because that cocoa powder makes me choke everytime!Overall, I thought the experience was enjoyable, mostly because the restaurant is adorable beyond description and we had good company. The wait staff's accents are novel, but they could provide a little better service. It's important that you make good choices on the menu. The carbonara and the mushroom linguine were really good. The rest had components that were good but they just couldn't tie it all together.I would go again (great for a date), but I would be very careful in making my menu selections the next time out."], ["Susan V.", "Horrible service. \u00a0Third and last time at this restaueant. \u00a0Still waiting \u00a0over an hour for dinner."], ["Briar Z.", "Horrible experience.

The restaurant is literally a little one story cottage/house, and it just looks like the kitchen of a home. There is an outdoor area, as well. When my friend and I went to the restaurant, it was during dinner time, so there were lights lit up everywhere and it looked beautiful.The waiters were predominantly male, and I felt very comfortable under their service. Italians are always nice people and are big on family, so I think their goal is to do just that--treat their customers as if we're their family. They all were flirting and winking, as well, which was sweet and flattering.I was craving pasta, so my friend suggested this place. Bon appetit! The penne pasta was very flavorful, and I tasted every flavor in every single bite. Pricing isn't too bad, either.

Pomodoro is their sister restaurant if you guys did not know. If you take a look at their menu's they are pretty much identical however Pomodoro has squid ink seafood pasta. Bread: comes out warm with their tomato sauce. For some reason I like to not only just dip my bread in the sauce but dunk it. We started off with their fried calamari and zucchini. $9.50. Their calamari is always not overly fried or chewy. It comes out crunchy and accompanied by their warm tomato sauce. Pasta: Black linguine- $15.95. Comes with 4 large shrimp, bay scallops, leeks in a cream sauce. Their cream sauce is so good it makes you want to lick the bowl.The gnocchi comes in a rich cream sauce they aren't too chewy or soft in texture. The service here can be a hit or miss. Came here on the weekend after Valentines day and there were only 2 other couples in the restaurant and it still took our waiter about 5 minutes to get our check. Come back again? For sure!"], ["Courtney H.", "I have a 'places to eat' notepad on my phone and this place has been on it for awhile after someone recommended it to me a long time ago. I'm usually not in the mood for Italian food, but my friend was so my list came in handy because this place was remarkable!The decor is like a homey, Italian kitchen. It's small but that's one of its allures. Honestly, had it never been recommended to me, I may have never known or visited the place at all. There is free street parking and I don't know what it's like on the weekend, but during the week, there's plenty of it. The food. We ordered it all. Starting with the calamari and zucchini appetizer, light batter and enough flavor that there wasn't a need for the sauce. They bring bread with marinara sauce also while you wait. Next up, I ordered the Caesar salad, which was good. Not the best I ever had, but decent.I ordered the rigatoni dish with chicken and my friend ordered the pappardelle. He thoroughly enjoyed his as did I mine. The portions are hearty and the flavors were good, sauce not too heavy. The restaurant had a list of specials in addition to their regular menu. The toughest part was just deciding what to get.Finally, we finished it off by sharing the Strawberry Napoleon as recommended by our server. I'm so glad we shared! It was a good choice due to its lightness and boy, was it yummy, but couldn't have eaten the whole thing myself. Even the coffee I ordered with it was good. Our service was also top notch. Our server was friendly and we were well taken care of he was kind and patient to explain different menu items to us. Despite my carb overload I didn't feel bogged down, but definitely satisfyingly full."], ["Alya A.", "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and it's the best Italian restaurant we have been to yet!

Authentic and reasonably priced."], ["Marcella M.", "Of course my husband and I have our anniversary on restaurant week and all of our faves are crazy packed. We decided to try this place. I love the cute setting. However, on this occasion we were seated in a spot that probably would have been a walkway, but because they were super packed they decided to put a two person table there. It made our night not so pleasant. The food was pretty good a little bland but I could taste the quality ingredients. I was however pretty disappointed because every time a server walked our way they grazed us so we were trying to dodge the servers as well as patrons all night. At one point I felt like I just wanted to get up and walk out. \u00a0I felt like we weren't guests but another random customer. We easily spent $90.00 and i regret every penny of it.

I had been here once before and thought it was good but this visit put it on my map as terrible going forward.

The vibe and the food are the best you can find. It's my good to place when family comes in to town and they want to go out to eat. You get complementary bread and dipping marinara sauce to start. They always have good wine recommendations. You can't go wrong with the food, every dish I've had is great. My favorite is the Borsettini di Aragosta -- lobster, cheese ravioli in a cream sauce with asparagus tips. Their lasagna is great. I've had the chicken/eggplant parm. The beef shank is amazing. You really can't go wrong. And most everyone speaks Italian their. And it's in little Italy!"], ["Valentina H.", "Ate here twice in 3 days during our stay in San Diego. It was a recommendation and totally worth it. First day we had the penne calabresi with real Italian sausage, and the octopus for me. Cannoli for dessert. The sausage was as real as it gets in the south of Italy with fennel seeds, the octopus was nicely charred and the cannoli crunchy and with a good and original ricotta filling.Today we had daily soup, a calamari and spinach stew, and the ossobuco. Ossobuco was so tender you could eat it with a spoon. Desert was again cannoli and a Tartufo.Best cannoli outside Italy and Boston modern pastry.Will be back as soon as we can!"], ["Will K.", "A very good sampling of the Italian dining options available in the area. \u00a0We came for late lunch early dinner on a Sunday; no lines and quick service. \u00a0The Osso Busso was great - very reach and with the right (to me at least) flavor on the meat. \u00a0 Service is friendly and pretty fast. \u00a0It's fun place - the only take away is that it can be a bit cramped, either on the patio or inside. \u00a0They're really keen on making sure that everyone can get in to sit down."], ["Amanda N.", "I've been here a few times now. The first time I came I had a horrible experience, but I decided to give it a second try because so many people rave about this place. I'm glad that I did. The first time must have just been a fluke because I've had great experiences every single time I've been back.Most recently I brought 2 of my girlfriends who were visiting from out of town. It was semi-early to be eating dinner so we all weren't extremely hungry. We decided to each order an appetizer and share between us. We got burrata (my absolute favorite), the meat and cheese platter, and baked eggplant topped with mozzarella. Three delicious choices and we were pretty full after eating them.There is indoor and outdoor seating. The seating is a little cramped and it can get kind of noisy in here. The service was good. Like I said the first time around I had a bad experience (horrible service and horrible tasting food) but I've returned multiple times and had delicious food and good service. I'm definitely glad I gave this place a second chance and will be back in the future!"], ["Jason A.", "WOW! I must say that I love the food at this place! The food speaks for itself. I went to Buon Appetito with a colleague of mine when I was in San Diego for a conference. We went on a Saturday night and it was reasonably crowded for a dinner. When we got to the restaurant we had some communication issues with the greeter but after clarifying the issue we were seated. After we sat down, we quickly asked the server his recommendations and he suggested the homemade lasagna. (I HIGHLY recommend the homemade lasagna!) Our order came exactly as ordered and came out within 10-15 minutes. As soon as the lasagna hit my lips i know this place was special. The sauce is amazing! The disk was amazing. The only negative thing i have to say about this establishment is that our server was not the best at following up with us and never asked \u00a0if we wanted \u00a0anything else or if we wanted more wine. I would rate this establishment as follows: Food is 5 stars, Atmosphere is 4 stars (even though its a big restaurant the tables are close together), Service is 2.5 stars and the Price is 4 Stars.Overall this restaurant has great food but \u00a0\"ok\" service.

BUT this tomato sauce is so good that I dipped A LOT.Capellini alla checca - hands down the best capellini alla checca I've ever had. The taste is just right. Unlike most Italian restaurants where they put tons of olive oil on top, this dish is not oily at all and the tomato sauce is something to die for. They also use mozzarella cheese - different from other places but super delicious.Our server and other stuff were really friendly and funny and the restaurant has nice decor.

It wasn't fantastic but flavorful and the proportions to price were certainly fair. My biggest complaint, if you will, was how loud it was. I am not talking about a packed house loud. Just loud in general. And, forgive me for being old fashioned, but if you go out for a romantic Italian dinner you really don't expect piped in Hip Hop music to fit the evening. I mean really? Give me some romantic Italian classics. Heck, give me Dean Martin. But Hip Hop! Overall, it's sort of a reluctant 3.5 star. Would I go back? Only after I experienced the other high rated restaurants in Little Italy. In other words, it will be a while."], ["Evan L.", "I've heard great things about the food here but also definitely heard about the not so up to par service and unfortunately that is exactly what we experienced. We were quickly seated when we arrived and sat on the patio. First of all, the seating is way to close together. I felt like I couldn't have a conversation with my girlfriend because there was another couple about 6 inches from our table. We had to move our waters whenever someone needed to walk by. We put in our drink orders and I just got a water and my girlfriend got a Coke. The soda came right away but after about 10 minutes my water never came so o had to ask a different server because we couldn't find ours. He brought it out and I quickly drank it because I was so thirsty. I asked for a refill and it was never brought out. After we ate our food which was pretty good, and they cleared our plates, our server never came back to check on us or ask us if there is anything else they could get us.

We came around 8 PM to avoid peak dinner times. I don't think that matters because the place was still busy! We were very fortunate a couple (who had a reservation already) rather wait for a specific table so we go a table right away. From my impression, this place is busy so I recommend getting a reservation beforehand. We sat outside which was nice. The seating area was tight so walking through to get to the tables was a little nerve-racking because I didn't want to knock anything over.We ordered veal pasta, the spinach salad with duck breast, and a glass of red wine. The veal pasta was AMAZING! So tender, so simple, and so flavourful. The sauce was really good. The spinach salad was also good and was refreshing to eat (although I would eat pasta the next time I come here but I was not that hungry that night).Overall, great place and nice service!"], ["Sharmeela S.", "This restaurant deserves 4.5 stars. \u00a0Every time I visit San Diego I come here. \u00a0I absolutely love their vodka sauce, ie creamy tomato or pink sauce. \u00a0They also serve complimentary Italian bread with marinara sauce. \u00a0There's a small grocery store two doors down that sells pasta and their very own pasta sauce. \u00a0I think the restaurant makes their own pasta also. \u00a0There tiramisu and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e are also excellent. \u00a0The prices are reasonable about 20$ for entrees and 7$ for dessert. \u00a0But the portions are quite big, usually enough for a good snack later."], ["Mike M.", "I ordered the Linguine alla scoglio which consists of clams, mussels, bay scallops, and shrimp in red or white sauce over linguine.

I would have preferred olive oil and crushed pepper. My service was good. They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk. I would return here.

We decided to eat here for dinner from all the good reviews. We were seated outside, because inside it was extremely noisy and packed. It was a weekday at 7pm. Just in case you are claustrophobic, this might not be the best option because you are seated literally maybe a foot from the table next to you. It made things really awkward because you don't mean to listen to the conversations happening next to you. Anyway the food made up for this. We started off with an appetizer: the polenta in mushroom sauce. It was absolutely divine! They give you complimentary bread so be sure to soak up all that amazing mushroom sauce with the bread. They were so generous with their portions that I was full by the time my entree came out! I ordered the seafood risotto, which was good. Not spectacular, but satisfactory. It lacked the creamy texture that I enjoy so much from other risottos I've had in the past. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, which was amazing. I always end up loving his dishes more than my own!

I was surprised at how small the inside of the restaurant was, but I liked how that gave it more of a cozy, family-style atmosphere. The food didn't disappoint either. They start you off with bread and an amazing marinara sauce. The only issue I had with the bread was that it wasn't warm. The sauce made it delicious, though. For my main dish, I decided to go with the rabbit ragu. It was so good!! The rabbit was tender and each bite was filled with flavor. And you get a very good amount of meat in this dish. The ragu sauce was delicious. I didn't find it to be salty at all, and I liked the texture that the carrots added. The fettuccine pasta that the rabbit ragu was served on completed the dish perfectly. The pasta was well cooked and picked up the sauce very nicely. This was a very large dish and definitely worth the price. I was only able to finish half of it and I had the rest for lunch the next day (it tasted just as good as the night before!).

Friendly staff, great service, and amazing food.The only reason why I'm taking a star off is because we had made reservations and still had to be seated outside their sister restaurant next door (on a hot summer night.) We came right on time for our reservations, but watched as the waitress gave away the last available seat indoors to a walk-in couple. But despite the heat and mysterious wet towel smell (which could've just been from the street), this proved serendipitous because we loved the experience of dining underneath the night sky. Hubby had been here before and asked the waitress if we could order one of their prosciutto and fig paninis from Sogno Di Vino (the restaurant nearby)-- it was amazing. The saltiness of the prosciutto paired with the sweetness of the fig was fantastic. The pesto salad it came with was fresh and complemented the dish well.

After I complained about the heat and having no where to sit outside, she escorted us to another side to the restaurant where we could stand and wait. Finally when she arrived we went back to the front and asked to be seated. She counted 7 of us (we called reservation for 8) and said she still couldn't seat us. My father in law was in the bathroom!! The restaurant was only half full at this time. We finally sat and a very rude and aggressive older man (might have been the owner) greeted us and counted and said \"I count 7, where is everyone\".

Everything they give you is dusted in green cut up parsley on and around the plate. The risotto was SO bad! It tasted like old dirty sock water.

The restaurant is located in Little Italy so parking can be difficult. Luckily we found some street parking not too far. The restaurant looks small from the outside but we didn't realize the restaurant right next to it was also part of it. We were seated outside so we got to people watch but it was a little chilly outside. The service was a little slow to start but it could just be because they were busy. They provided bread and tomato sauce as an appetizer, but we were not even given our table settings until we received our meals. I ordered the linguine nere which was squid ink linguine pasta served with shrimp, sausage, broccolini (rapini) and served in a spicy tomato sauce. My friend ordered a lobster and cheese ravioli served with asparagus and a white cream sauce. My pasta was al dente, but I couldn't really taste the squid ink and it just tasted like regular linguine. The sauce was not spicy, but still good; it was not heavy or greasy. My friend's ravioli was good as well; you can definitely taste the lobster in the ravioli and the white sauce complemented the flavor. They gave generous portions of the food so you're getting a good amount for the price you're paying. Overall a nice little restaurant that I would probably come back on a less busy day if I'm in the area."], ["Philip M.", "I am not Italian. I have never been to Italy. I don't even have any Italian friends... but holy hell, THIS PLACE IS GOOD! I was trying to find a cute romantic restaurant for Valentine's Day few years back, and after numerous considerations among other close contenders, Buon Appetito won out. Service was passable. It wasn't the best service I have ever received at an Italian restaurant, but waters were refilled and we were checked on consistently. But what makes Buon Appetito worthy of its four stars is the food. It's amazing.We begun with the Antipasto alla Contadina, which is a combination of sliced meats, cheeses and other goodies. Holy crap, this antipasta was huge. It had salami, ham, fresh sliced assorted cheese and other little mixtures. Everything tasted excellent. If you never had italian food, this is a great appetizer to tantalize your taste buds off with!For our main entrees, I went with the Orecchiette alla Barese. At $16.95, every bite tasted better than the last. The \u00a0Ear-shaped pasta, mixed in with italian sausage, broccoli rabe, and fresh chopped tomatoes, smelled delicious and made me believe in true love again lolThe girl went with the Salmone alla Griglia ($21.95), pretty much salmon over chive risotto. She loved it so much, I didn't get to taste a single bite. She raved about it the rest of the night and wanted me to take her back there in the future.If you are looking for authentic tasty Italian food, Buon Appetito is firing on all cylinders.

So much flavor and richness but not heavy that you feel like you just chugged a mug of cream. Mo's salmon ravioli was smoky and tender and paired perfectly with the nutty champagne white sauce. While my veal and mushroom \"pockets\" were bursting with flavor. The veal was tender and moist with none of the harsh \"gaminess\" that veal sometimes has. The mushrooms helped keep that moist texture and provided a great flavor booster for the veal. The sauce for my pockets was a tomato cream and was...so good I cleaned my place with a slice of the soft soft soft bread they give to you to start.Speaking of that! Hahaha sorry backwards here. The BREAD and fresh tomato sauce... O_O...TT_TT It might make you cry it is so good. You can taste how fresh and what QUALITY they use. It is amazing.

We originally started on the patio, but it was a bit tight and got hot pretty quick so we moved and got comfy indoors. We all also coincidentally ordered the same entree for lunch: Ravioli Classici. It was just eh. I didn't really taste the spinach and I'd never thought I'd say it, but it was a not too cheesy. Based on the reviews, the lasagna seems to be more of a winner."], ["Mindy N.", "One of our favorite Italian restaurants in SD, always a good meal and excellent service.

Came here this evening to celebrate a late birthday.Though it did take about ten minutes to order drinks and twenty minutes to order our food (which is why I had to knock off a star) service was so kind to us. I got the farfalle with salmon and changed the tomato sauce to pesto! It was soooo delicious. I forgot the name of the dish my mom ordered, but it was a veal shank under the dinner menu and was AMAZING.Our waiter (whose name we didn't get, but he was the older man with glasses) was very helpful and brought out a tiramisu cake for my birthday, which was the best tiramisu I've ever had.I'll definitely come back again, even if it's just to have that tiramisu."], ["Bryn J.", "A little small but nothing uncomfortable like some of the other reviews say. I had capellini-alla-checca and my boyfriend had a salmon bowtie pasta, I can't remember the name of his. I love angel hair pasta and theirs is good! My boyfriends dish was fantastic as well.

Can't really help more than that.Decor:It's good rock walls and lots of decorations on the wall. Some poor placement of structure beams, but overall a nice place.Food & Drinks:We had the fettuccine alla Montanara and we had some type of gnocchi as well. I had to say the gnocchi felt very heavy as a dish with the pesto sauce and too much salt. The gnocchi was cooked really well, but the flavors just didn't taste good. The fettuccine was kind of bland and had too little salt. Which made sharing really great cause one was too salty and the other not salty enough. Overall, I'm surprised that this place was so lack luster and for the price I was let down. It wasn't too bad, just didn't live up to all the hype I was hoping for.Okay Pasta eating my friends."], ["Jessica V.", "Loved loved loved! I couldn't have been happier with this restaurant.

We came here during dinner hour ok a Saturday and were able to get a table almost immediately. The polenta appetizer was delicious. Creamy polenta with a great mushroom and cream sauce.

Very reasonable prices."], ["Ben B.", "I arrived at Buon Appetito solo on a Friday night without a reservation. \u00a0I was seated at the bar.

Although I noticed other tables getting bread, I had to specifically ask the bartender to get some for me. \u00a0For my entr\u00e9e, I got the Farfalle con Pollo Affumicato - Smoked chicken breast with sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms in a white wine cream sauce. \u00a0 It had interesting textures. \u00a0The mushrooms had a bit of a crunch. \u00a0The chicken seemed overcooked and a bit dry. \u00a0I loved the sun-dried tomatoes, but there weren't nearly enough of them to keep the dish balanced. The bar itself is a bad place to eat. \u00a0Four chairs are crammed together, so you'll feel cramped if you have more than a drink in front of you.

It was extremely hard to pick since this is in \"little Italy\" so you can only imagine how many other Italian restaurants there are here. I'm really glad I picked this place, the pasta was perfect. The only thing I did not enjoy was that there wasn't enough customer service, not because the host or server were nice but because they were so busy and honestly only saw two servers running around with their heads all over the place. It took about 10minutes before someone coming to take our drink order and then another 15 for our meal order and forget everything else it was impossible getting the servers attention. The food however did come out right away. I think they definitely need more servers. Will definitely come back"], ["Andrew K.", "No idea why I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars on my first review.

The fettuccine Alfredo my daughter had was a little dry for my personal taste but she enjoyed it which is what matters. Food-wise I was not disappointed. The only negative part for me would have to be the fact that there was a fellow diner with a large dog (German Shepard) sitting in the outside sitting area where we were sitting which barked at my daughter (not in a playful way) and also at any other dogs that walked by. \u00a0It kind of made me nervous like he was gonna get loose and attack. \u00a0I feel maybe the restaurant manager should have asked the diner to do a better job at keeping his dog quiet so it wouldn't startle others."], ["Brooke D.", "This place is the best. You can get get food from here or you can get food from next door. Great authentic Italian food. We usually get a bottle of wine and the cheese plate.

I was very excited to order, but the waiter saw my unItalian features and interrupted me mid-word. No, I am not fluent (yet), but lesson one of this arbitrary language course was ordering food and I felt competent. Anyways, besides that initial disappointment, the wait staff was very attentive and polite.I ordered (or tried to) the Orecchiette Alla Barese and was not too amused by its appearance or taste. There was no sauce besides a separated light tomato/oil mixture sitting at the bottom, and there was way too much pasta compared to veggies and meat. Besides the sausage, it was relatively tasteless, so I would definitely not suggest ordering the fun sounding dish.I came here with my friend and her mom who ordered the Melanzane All' Amalfitana (AKA eggplant parmesan) for the table. It was actually borderline scrumptious and I would have eaten the whole thing and not my dish if that had been socially acceptable. The complimentary bread was also better than my order - it was fresh and soft and came with a tomato dip, which is unlike most Italian restaurants I have been to. My friend's mom let me try her gnocchi and once again it was better than my meal. Actually, it was delicious. Basically I ordered the wrong thing. I would have rated the restaurant two stars had I not tried other food.Learning that I am a Yelper, my friend's mom made a point to tell me to note the tragedy of our leftovers. With half of our plates full and our stomachs reaching maximum capacity, our food was whisked away to be put into to go boxes. Now I can imagine they were relatively excited to eat their food (because it was scrumptious) so disappointment quickly followed. As we were walking to the car a few blocks away, oil began oozing from the bag. However, the severity of the situation was only realized when the bag was opened. The bottom three boxes were crushed due to their flimsiness, the oil in the food, and the fact that four boxes were stacked on top of each other. Not only did we witness the death of these leftovers, but also a phone nearly perished from the oozing oils. Nevertheless, the(ir) food was good and our experience in the actual restaurant was too."], ["Alan C.", "Great italian food at some pretty reasonable prices.Love their seafood pasta, generous portions of mussels, fish, calamari and more. Pasta is good perfectly, and the light red sauce lets the seafood shine. Cioppino is good, but I wish there was more broth to dip my bread into.The burrata cheese appetizer is always a good choice if you love cheese. I sort of have a weak spot for burrata, so creamy without a strong taste.Portion sizes are ok, pretty much in line with what you would expect for the price.Seating is a bit tight, but service is great."], ["Helen G.", "The Spaghetti Alla Principessa was delicious and very well made.

MehThe chicken had grill marks but was undeniably NOT smoked. No smokiness at all. It was an over cooked tough piece of chicken breast. The mushrooms and wine cream sauce lends itself to a messy presentation. The dish was ok but not great. A sizable portion of bread was brought to the table. The bread reminded me of the $1.99 French bread one can purchase as Safeway. It was served with a cold chunky tomato sauce which was tasty but not what I had expected. I would have been happier with olive oil and garlic or just the traditional olive oil and balsamic. My server, griffin, was courteous and efficient.

Growing up in Boston and frequenting the North End, I have high standards for Italian - and Buon Apetitio surpassed those.

I ordered the sea bass, mussels and clams in homemade marinara on fresh pasta and it was amazing. I couldn't believe the portion of sea bass. My husband had the rabbit ragu and it was delicious, but there were a bunch of bones that started to ruin it for him after more than two - but it was another huge portion and the homemade linguini was amazing. The other people I was with also both loved their meals and cleaned their plates. Service was great - very attentive.

There were a few issues with our overall experience which I will briefly go over. \u00a0We love Italian food (and Thai, Mexican, Spanish, Cajun, etc) and frequent restaurants regularly and have average, not above average, expectations of the food and ambiance experience. \u00a0We are not demanding people and generally make the best of our dining experiences. Our negative experience at this restaurant began when Daniella our host (and later found out manager) directed us to the next door restaurant and told us it was the same as Buon Appetito. \u00a0I am still not sure if this was true but we accepted this explanation and proceeded to order our meal. The meal was average overall with some good and bad and here are our thoughts:The Good:1) Our server, Nadia, was attentive.2) The tiramisu was light and airy and had the right amount of sugar-a winner in our book3) Nice decor.The Bad:1) The bread was sub par. \u00a0When we visit Italian restaurants we expect good to above average bread and this was below average. 2) My pasta dish, Linguine alla Scoglio, \u00a0was mediocre with gravy (sauce) that was average and seafood that was a bit over cooked.3) My wife had the, Pesce Spada alla Griglia con Arugula e Pomodorini, which was average but the presentation was terrible with the arugula completely covering the sword fish. The fish was fresh.The Really Bad:We have no children but love our nieces and nephews and understand the challenge that parents have in raising kids. \u00a0We also are very accepting of family oriented restaurants and realize that parents also want great food and need to get out. \u00a0However, we had a couple next to our table that had a young child that was screaming the entire time we were at the restaurant and they never attempted to pick up the the child. or take the child to the bathroom (maybe a diaper change was needed), or take the child out for a quick stroll- totally unacceptable. The parents were eating \u00a0away and never made an attempt to pacify the child. Really? What kind of parents and people do this? \u00a0Most disappointingly, the managers of the restaurant never approached the parents to talk to them about their child. Is this not the environment that they should control?When I complained, Daniella apologized over and over which was after the fact and we would have accepted this if she had indicated that the management would look into handling situations like this in the future. We told her that for the sake of most patrons inconsiderate people like this should be asked to leave the restaurant and she said they would never do this. She said that the restaurant would never ask anyone to leave. \u00a0Really? Conclusion:We will never be back. We think we are reasonable and that a restaurant experience is more than serving food. A good experience consists of well prepared food, good service and a nice peaceful environment. \u00a0This restaurant fails on many counts. The biggest disappointment is how they are more concerned with filling tables than with good and basic customer service. \u00a0It was our first visit to San Diego, \u00a0We love San Diego and the people in this great city and will be back. \u00a0We love the laid back vibe. \u00a0We will never be back to Boun Appetito and highly suggest you avoid this restaurant."], ["Wayne H.", "We had a wonderful lunch yesterday.

By the time we were done our waitress came back and joked \"you hated it?!\" Because we had devoured it so quickly. As for main courses, I personally hated my farfalle. I knew in my heart it was risky because I am not a huge fan of light wine sauces, and prefer thick sauces. But on top of that, the chicken was dry and chewy. Everything was pretty bleh.The star of the show was the penne bolognaise. The cheese on top melted like butter and the bolognaise sauce was freshly made in house. It was amazing.

He had good recommendations and easily answered all of questions so we could get the best out of this gem of a place. The bread was soft and warm while we waited.

It was all very good and cooked perfectly. We liked that the pasta dishes included an option for al dente. Definitely recommend this place! Visit LI and be sure to enjoy the friendly and delicious meal at Buon Appetito"], ["Tyler W.", "This was a tough one...I ordered the squid ink pasta with sausage and octopus and one of my dining companions ordered the bolognese. We both agreed that they were good...but I wouldn't say very good or great. We were both excited because it seemed like the type of Italian place we would have found back in Boston or NYC. However, it didn't deliver on the flavor side...which was too bad because the squid ink pasta itself was really well done. By socal Italian standards I would give this place a 4...but if we start comparing it to modern hip Italian places like Bestia or the Italian places in the northeast it doesn't hold up as well. If you are in the area it is a solid option though...3.5"], ["Justin A.", "The girlfriend and I came to Buon Appetito here on date night. We originally planned to go to Craft + Commerce but the place was too \"bro\".Buon Appetito was packed but we ended up sitting at the tiny bar right away. The bartender was very friendly and approachable. he let us try a bunch of different types of wine before we finally settled on a glass.For food, we ordered the gnocci special and the rack of lamb. The gnocci was awesome, the perfect size to share. The rack of lamb was also delicious, it was not overdone in bed of sauce and the char was perfect.As other reviews point out, the food doesnt come out right away. If you're in a rush, this isn't the place for you. That being said, there is low table turnover and this place is a nice spot to relax."]], "Devine Pastabilities": [["Jaddahti J.", "We were in San Diego in September, and I put this place on the agenda to surprise Babygirl, who is a carboholic, and used to stuff her dinner rolls with her rice or potatoes when she was little. I saw where a kindred spirit had invented noodle sandwiches, and I knew it would be dream come true for her. As it turned out, she went out on the town with her cousins the night before, and imbibed in so much liquid carbs that she was a no-show, so the Anaconda and I decided to bite the bullet and go in her honor. What a pleasant surprise! It's a cute. clean little shop, the servers are young and cheerful, and noodle sandwiches are better than you think! The hollowed out rolls are toasted nicely so they hold the saucy fillings nicely, but are not hard to chew (which the Anaconda hates). Fries were great, and I'm not sure why it thrilled me so, but the salad came in one of those little wooden - looking bowls like the good old days, instead of a plate like usual. Strange the the things that will make you happy. Including noodle sandwiches."], ["Kirsten R.", "We were at the OB farmers market in our neighborhood when we tried the sandwiches. It's right by our house actually (the restaurant itself) and we've heard the guy is an ASU grad (go Devils!) so we'd been wanting to try it.It was $15 total for both sandwiches and they were very filling. I had the chicken Alfredo. I watched them prep it all in front of me and it was fresh and the sauce appeared homemade. It was really good! Bread was very fresh, lots of chicken. I would get it again. Hubby had the spaghetti and meatballs. I had a bite and it was also good quality, nice tomato sauce.Would definitely try this place again when the mood strikes. Not a once a week place. Maybe a once a month treat as I was ridiculously full when I finished! Yum!"], ["Anthony M.", "As creative as pasta in bread is, I was just overfilled with carbs by the end of the meal. I was craving for something more, but unfortunately it was not more of this. It was just simply way too much carbs, but this place is pretty cheap.Our friend brought us here to show us something new that SD had a pretty good idea of. Torpasta is literally a pasta sandwich. The same idea of a bread bowl, but instead using long subway baguettes, and adding pasta as the filling. I ordered a creamy pesto pasta 6inch, (around $7-8, which I though was pretty cheap). Adding the sriracha hot cause made it a bit spicy, but just as tasty. We also got bread holes (?) that are the same idea of donut holes. We got about a dozen of toasted (inside of the bread) bread holes, with a marinara dipping sauce, and parmesan fries. Realize hot much carbs we are eating before our actual torpastas came.

It tastes like crap ._.The idea of pasta and bread seems creative but honestly, it's a carb overload to the point that it is overbearing. I already got lost interest in the texture by a couple of bites. We order the pesto and the FAB, which is fettuccine. The pesto sandwich was very saucy which made the sandwich really wet. The pesto flavor was really light and not as strong as I want it to be. The fettuccine was worse. It has no distinctive flavor what so ever. It was bland as if it came out of a can. Both of these were a disappointment. I scooped out the pasta and try to see if it would taste better but it didn't. It was a fail attempt in flavor. The decor was really plain and looks like as if it's a fast food joint. There were trash around the tables and I kinda felt dirty sitting there. I walked in assuming it was where you order it at the register and sit down with your food but it's a restaurant? I was so confused. The service wasn't bad. They would keep coming and ask how we are doing and ask how's the food. to be honest, if i said I didn't like the food at all, would they give me something different or have helped us?

Unfortunately, I made a mistake of not asking them to make it vegetarian at the beginning of the meal, but they were super understanding and didn't look down on me for it. They had it fixed in no time! It was super good with the bread being super soft. It was definitely a lot of food.I also had the tiramisu, which I won't lie, wasn't that great. It was definitely on the drier side, but for what I was expecting, it did its job.Overall, I would definitely come back here and try their pasta sandwiches, particularly after a workout or run.

The pasta itself is pretty good, I would love to eat a whole plate of it if I could, but combining it with a bread bowl I get the best of both worlds in one bite. It's way tastier than Olive Gardens that's for sure. They have friendly workers that are willing to help you find the right pasta you want, they're attentive and also pretty laid back.

Now, if you are a carb lover and like to indulge at times, this is the place for you. It has a great, casual atmosphere.

We had one main waiter but another guy kept making sure we didn't need anything else. They were really busy so it took a little bit for him to take our order but not because he wasn't busy working. The food was absolutely delish!! My family of four is just raving about it, even my picky young one. The bread is super delish and soft.

The fettuccine was very doughy and the sauce was nothing like the carbonara I'm used to.The yelp meatball spinach rigatoni torpedo was good - not because it was shoved into a sandwich, but because the meatballs were very tasty, the sauce was good, and the pasta was al dente and not doughy.Atmosphere and service is friendly and casual.So, if you are an absolute carb lover and the idea of stuffing a bread roll with pasta appeals to you, you will like it. \u00a0I didn't much and will probably not come back."], ["Jennifer M.", "Love this place!

However, if you're looking to carb up, this place is heaven. Located in a plaza, there is plenty of parking to go around. There is about 3-5 outdoor tables and around 8-10 tables inside. The restroom is located at the back and there is one stall for each sex. The place is very clean and tidy. If you're looking for an appetizer, I suggest getting the garlic parmesan French fries. It's good for around 2 people and it taste great. Now they have a pretty extensive menu, but the reason to come here is to try out their Torpastas, in which pasta is stuff inside a hollow garlic roll. The first time I came here I decided to get the Yelpwich, which comes with your choice of meat, cheese, basil and blush sauce over penne. Since it was my friend's first time here, he decided to get that. This time I decided to get the Matahelper, which was sausage instead of ground beef which macaroni and cheddar sauce. It was amazing and very filling. I highly recommend getting this in addition to the yelpwich.

Everybody's food came in the signature hollowed out loaf half - except for mine. I ordered the Avocado & Turkey Torpedo, which was really just a sandwich. Everybody said they loved their food, but they also doused their food in Cholula and red pepper flakes. My friends who ordered 12' Torpastas want to warn everyone of its fillingness - keep that in mind. So to get to some disappointing news; the waiting service was sub par.

Great concept, but I was a little skeptical to of it would taste good. We ordered the bread holes as starters. For as hungry as we were, the bread holes were- ok. Maybe they were a little over toasted, so they were dry. I didn't taste the richness of the garlic butter. The dish of Mariana sauce quickly went, because the bread needed the sauce for moisture. Each one of our party ordered different kinds of pasta and everyone lived their food. I had the creamy pesto with sausage, and it was so flavorful, hot, and creamy! Hubby enjoyed his meat lasagna, and in laws loved their classic meatballs and spaghetti! Grand parents and our nanny ordered their regular sandwiches and they were good too. It would get 5 stars- but the service was not that great (and the bread holes need improvement). We had to ask for utensils, refills, etc. And when they were dropping the food off, they were literally dropping them off on the table and walking away, leaving us to guess and figure out what they were (it was our first time there).

There's something very appealing about holding a pasta dinner in your hands. Never mind nutritional balance!The sandwiches are also good (nothing like fresh, fluffy bread).

I got the meatball and spaghetti torpasta, and I was scared that they would be stingy with the meatballs, but they weren't! I found quite a few meatballs, and they were all very flavorful. The spaghetti was also pretty good; only thing I wish was different was that the pasta was a little soft for me. I wish it was al dente instead.

On this last visit I had the Devino - bow tie pasta with alfredo sauce & sun dried tomatoes (I added shrimp) As far as apps go, we almost always get their Parmesan garlic fries and I love their bread holes! During HH you get 3 bread holes free when you purchase a beer!Service for me has always been great as well! Friendly waitresses who are knowledgable and know the menu if you need to ask questions. Throughout our meal they also came back a few times to see if things were ok or if we needed anything. All around great service!"], ["Monica U.", "My friend recommended me this place!

But besides the great service and appreciated advice on reheating, the food was greater than expected. I admit.. I expected the fries to taste differently. But a miracle happened when I ordered those bread holes, because the moment we dipped both the fries and bread holes into the marinara sauce, I swear, it was like a slice of heaven. Please consider offering the marinara with the fries!In terms of their famous torpastas, the two of us ordered the 12-inch Divino and Yelpwich (of course). And wow. I cannot stress this enough -- I LOVE, LOVE, LOVEEEEEEED my Yelpwich. The meatballs were great and the pasta was great and the Divino, too, was delicious! It felt like it wasn't even 10 minutes and our tummies were full. Our 6-inch halves weren't even finished yet! *For future reference, if you do order a 12-inch, get two different torpastas/torpedoes/etc. Switch halves with your partner and have the best of both worlds like we did. It was sooooo worth.As for the atmosphere, it was very welcoming. I remember each employee cheerfully saying goodbye when we left. I never did look at photos of the location, so it was a bit of a surprise when we entered, but the decor was interesting and made for good conversation (i.e. $600(?) sign for beer lol). In the end, we had so many leftovers. It really made us happy considering we barely ate anything that day, so thank you, Devine Pastabilities! You made my celebration for my boyfriend's acceptance into SDSU a successful one! \u00a0We'll be coming back for more! But maybe for 6-inch torpastas instead lol."], ["Kassandra I.", "Finally got the chance to come in and try this place! \u00a0I must say I was slightly disappointed with what I ordered- the Machahelper. I should've ordered one of their more popular items for a first time visit. Nonetheless, it was still yummy! Imagine macaroni hamburger helper stuffed in between a 6inch bun.

Have one, have two. Admittedly the name of the place seems a little weird, I don't know why they just don't call the restaurant \"Torpasta\". In any event, I hope to see an invasion of so-cal by Torpasta eventually. Food trucks, restaurants, DO IT!I also wanted to mention that there's a great consistency in quality. I used to visit when I lived in San Diego two years ago. I recently made it a point to visit and it was exactly how I remembered it!

Why didn't I think of that? Because I'm dumb and Pastabilities is smart. Even the name is portmanteau genius. Combine all of these elements with an intimate vibe and craft beer and you've got an awesome place to chow down. Upon entering I was thrilled to see a surprisingly decent selection of local beer. I asked our server her recommendation and she pointed me to the creamy pesto. I really don't like when servers are wishy washy about their favorites. \"Well uh it depends on what you're into or whatever...\" Just tell me what your favorite thing is! This server said \"creamy pesto\" without skipping a beat. I added shrimp because I need *some* protein. The food came out and it was glorious. The sandwich comes vertical like a horn blowing its tunes into heaven. The bread was perfect. Crunchy yet soft. The pasta was flavorful. It filled every carb need I could ever have. Creamy sauce and the meaty shrimp was a great contrast to all of the carbiness. If pasta inside of a sandwich sounds good to you, then please stop in and get a 6\".

The bread holes are a must order! They take the insides of the bread and smother it in garlic butter and warm it up for you.I thought this was a very clever idea. Instead of trashing the core, they use it for an appetizer. Very smart.The interior just feels so homey. Not a very big area but big enough to feed maybe 30 to 40 people at a time? They also have a couple seats outside. The parking isn't too bad, the lot isn't empty but it's almost never full.I love just spaghetti with red sauce in the bread. Keep it simple. You can choose what pasta you want with whatever sauce and also get toppings. There are different sizes breads as well. I always go for the bigger one.

The space is now more modern and feels much more open. There was a large selection of beers on tap behind the new bar and the flooring seems to have been replaced as well. We were greeted immediately as we entered and had a choice of where to sit. Our server was wearing their usual 'heart carbs' uniform shirt (I've always wanted one) and she was very friendly and offered her favorites as suggestions. Previously, I always ordered the 6\" meat lasagna torpasta, but unfortunately this time they were just starting a new batch and I was too hungry to wait. We ended up ordering the garlic parm fries to start and splitting the 12\" meatball torpasta. The food came our quickly and was delicious as always! \u00a0 Who would have thought that something as simple as stuffing your pasta in bread would be such a revelation for the taste buds?

Mine had SO much potential, the alfredo sauce was pretty much soaked up by the bread so it was basically just noodles & chicken. \u00a0I probably should of asked for more alfredo sauce on the side which would of helped.

It's very good but the parmesan cheese can be overwhelming. I had the chicken Parm, which id highly recommend. I think it could have used a bit more sauce on top though. The waiter, I'm guessing he's the owner of the place as well is a friendly guy. We were the first to arrive at opening for dinner. He sat us right away and took our orders.

Plenty of open seating when I came in with a friend on a Friday night. 2. Family owned. There were only 2 guys serving us & everyone else in the restaurant.3. Unique Italian food. It might've been because of what we ordered. Haha! I ordered the Ravioli di Aragosta. It was lobster ravioli, with a ton of tomatoes on top, & mint? I was a little hesitant to order it, but it was unusually good. As a tomato lover, I loved how they piled the tomatoes on top rather than the measly few pieces you'd usually get. My friend ordered the Tagliolini Neri Mediterranei, which was squid ink pasta buried under A TON of seafood. Squid ink pasta sounds weird, but I tried it & I was pretty jealous of her entree.The main downside was we waited awhile to get our food while we saw other tables who ordered after us get served. Table envy...just one of the worst feelings when you go out to eat. It wasn't the best Italian food...I may have to come back to order the squid ink pasta for myself though."], ["Barbara L.", "I like to support local establishments but my experience here would not bring me back.

Although it is crafted fresh, the skimpy amount of meat makes this dish very sad. The beef was grounded so softly that I could not even taste it. Meat sauce and cheese is key to making a delicious lasagna and this place was missing both ingredients. My taste buds left disappointed and unsatisfied. My bf had the pasta with sausage in a white mushroom sauce. The pasta was not \"al dente,\" and on the stale/hard side. He was not fond of the dish at all. Service was friendly and while the food looked delicious, it did not taste delicious."], ["robert c.", "This is one of the better Italian restaurants in San Diego.

At least it is not smack in the middle of Hillcrest where parking is unbearable \u00a0during the weekend. Here \u00a0you can just park down the street in some neighborhood and walk just a block or so without the annoying parking meter.My wife and I ordered the Lasagna Tradizionale and Tagliatelle al Ragu di Maiale.The Lasagna was very rich and full over flavor. This is the first time I had lasagna that used fresh mozzarella and a rich Bechamel sauce as opposed to the standard mozzarella and ricotta. The Lasagna came out piping on serve on a plate that was hot as well so be careful.The Tagliatelle was excellent especially with the pork rip.

The patio seating was perfect for the warm San Diego evening. The inside of the restaurant was bright and cheerful with the entire front wall opened up so those on the inside could enjoy the fresh air as well.The menu left us with difficult decisions. We could not figure out what to eat because so many of the different items on the menu looked ABSOLUTELY delicious. In the end we decided to go with the Cozze e Vongole (muscles and clams) for an appetizer, I ordered a pasta dish that had thin spaghetti like noodles and an assortment of seafood (clams, oysters and crab I believe), my boyfriend also had a pasta dish with a red sauce and lamb.Everything we received left us scraping the plates. Literally. We were started off with a small appetizer while we waited for our food, puff pastry with a tomato sauce and parmesan cheese. I couldn't believe this was free. Despite being covered in the heavenly tomato sauce, the pastries managed to maintain their texture and their own flavor still was a active player. The sauce's flavor tasted like a grandmother had been cooking the sauce for days allowing all of the flavors to develop. Put both together = a party in your mouth. Our appetizer the Cozze e Vongole was BEAUTIFULLY done. All of our shellfish opened up and were served in a sauce that forced us to order bread so we were able to soak it up and eat it ALL. The portion size was quite large and by the time we finished it there was nothing edible left, NOTHING.On to our entrees. I am sorry but I can't remember the names but they both were described above. Both lived up to the newly set standard that were set by the appetizers. My dish, the thin spaghetti pasta with seafood, was extremely hearty. The sauce served with the pasta and seafood was very light but added a depth of flavor to the dish. They did not shy away from serving ample amounts of each of the types of seafood included. My boyfriend first felt like his pasta was a bit to al dente but as he progressed through the dish he decided that they cooked more and turned out to be perfect. \u00a0From the few bites that he was willing to share with me, his dish was also hearty and served with plenty of lamb meat. Being given just a taster of his left me wanting MORE!Besides the food being absolutely delightful and beyond all expectations. We received great service. Granted we were one of the only tables in the restaurant. We were told about the kitchen staff and how they came along as well as where the inspiration from the food came from.

The whole street was packed with tourists and diners and every restaurant I checked with had upwards of a 45 minute wait - not cool! I was in a bit of a time crunch so I Uber'd over to Charisma in Hillcrest hoping to escape the crowds and long wait-time of Little Italy without compromising on quality. Charisma was the perfect answer. The restaurant's clean, and charming, and the food was perfect for hearty classic Italian fare. While we waited for our orders, the owner brought us bread and a little dish of green lentils and roasted garlic in olive oil, which turned out to be a perfect accompaniment. Our dishes (carbonara and pastorella) were out very quickly thereafter, and we were incredibly satisfied. Both dishes tasted home-cooked and very fresh, with the true differentiator being the tomato sauce: you can always tell if it's made in-house, and this definitely was. Finally, we were really impressed with the bill! Had we stayed in Little Italy, our check would have easily been twice as much for what we'd ordered. Both our dishes were $13.00 each.

The food tasted authentic, nothing here was made out of a can I'm sure, if it was I'd be floored.

He first brought out bread and a topping for it that looked green and had little balls In it that looked liked lentils. I have no idea what it was but It was good. The salad was ok but the chicken was BOMB! It was smothered in a delicious sauce that I just couldn't stop eating. The taste is really authentic, not like olive garden or bucca. The only reason I'm taking off a star is because of how the tables are set up. This is one of those places that has tables almost right next to eachother.. so close that you're not able to go in between them without knocking over the plate of the person next to you. \u00a0Beside that, everything was great!

It was later and close to closing so understandable.Menu was limited and we all ordered pasta. The best of the three was the Bolognese. The Carbonara was broken and the eggs were scrambled instead of tempered into the pasta in a sauce like they should have been. Still edible but this is a mistake a home cook often makes and it shouldn't happen at a restaurant---and something I \u00a0careful to not do myself when I cook this dish. The squid ink pasta was liked by the 9 year old, but I thought the pasta was overcooked.

Absolutely amazing! Cassie ordered the tagliatelle pesto, Hunt ordered the pollo parmigiana and I chose the tagliatelle bolognese. All 3 were things to write home to mom about.

The pasta was pretty good - never had black squid ink before but I think it went well with the spicy tomato sauce. A unique flavor that everyone should try. Seafood was cooked pretty well too.The lasagna was good too - it had a different twist to it than regular ones - and I really liked the sauce - it went well with the meat, which had great texture by the way.One complaint was: they took a while to fill out our waters or give us a check.

Our waitress was kind enough to bring a second serving since we loved them so much. Onto the food given the holiday season I decided to go with their butternut squash gnocchi di zucca with gorgonzola cream sauce- seriously amazing. The sauce was true perfection- the perfect amount of cream and the texture was truly exquisite and beautiful. Every bite was to die for so much that it's hard to feel guilty. My bf ordered the lasagna- I had a couple bites and it was also very good. However, I would say the butternut squash was the better order of the two.

I could tell by the crowd and by what everyone was wearing since Bencotto had a lot of dressed up people. For our food I decided on the ravioli with veal and marrow filling. I forgot the name but it was excellent. The filling was super tender and flavorful. The marrow gave it a nice richness and creaminess that I really enjoyed. The sauce it came with was a tomato sauce which was also excellent. Top it off with grated parmesan and pepper and I was a happy camper. They make all of their pastas here in house every day so how could you not go with a pasta dish. My only complaint was some of the ravioli seemed a bit undercooked to me but it wasn't that big of a deal since the filling was so good. My friend got the cacio e pepe and she said her dish was very good as well. Service was ok. Although friendly and super helpful it wasn't as attentive as I expected a place like this would be.

I could've mitigated that if there was enough ricotta on top to eat with the pancakes, but sadly there wasn't.Bacon was clearly microwaved and not actually cooked in a skillet which was hugely disappointing. On the menu it's \"applewood\" bacon, and maybe it actually is, but after being microwaved it neither has the taste of applewood nor the consistency of bacon, so much as cardboard.

I originally intended to dine at Bencotto to celebrate my birthday. I have been going there for almost four years and have consistently stellar experiences. After making the long drive through traffic all the way from Del Mar, we were dismayed that there was a mechanical issue of some sort at Bencotto's kitchen. The server stated that Monello was owned by the same family and they already had a table ready for us.There was no table ready and we waited for almost ten minutes to be seated. The restaurant did not seem busy at all and the only actions they took to prepare the table were cleaning the surface and providing the plate/utensil settings. Service was absolutely terrible - our server was rude and condescending. She incorrectly understood our request to taste two of the wines before ordering a bottle. She came by with two full glasses of different wines, which was not a big deal and understandable given the noise level inside. However, she spoke to us as if we were her children and declared to us that the glasses were already filled. Yes I can see that, thanks for the additional detail... She also continued to speak over us and interject about ordering different sizes of draft wine and created a frustrating experience. We are paying good money for a nice experience and receiving an experience not even fitting for a Dennys. Even before the server came by to deliver an absolute lack of tact and professionalism, my girlfriend became doubtful about accepting the offer to come dine at Monello. I assured her and let her know that I had been dining at Bencotto for a couple of years and the service/food should be excellent at Monello given the fact that they have the same owners. As you can see, this negatively affects my reputation and Bencotto's reputation. . To make matters worse, my \"fresh\" pasta entree tasted like it had been pulled out of a frozen entree box. The noodles did not have the texture of something that was freshly cut (as advertised) and the sauce was weak in substance. The misto fritto appetizer tasted average, though the accompanying sauces were good. My girlfriend's gnocci was actually great - it had a great texture and the accompanying sauce was rich. Hamilton, the manager, was very kind and an absolute professional - he did his best to assist with the situation and I greatly appreciate his efforts. The staff who bussed the tables and filled our water were very knowledgeable, helpful, and polite. I feel that our experience would have been profoundly elevated, had they been our actual serving staff. In the end, I am not in a rush to return to Monello and am also concerned about returning to Bencotto. One does not intend to make a long drive down the 5 freeway in traffic and expect to meet head on with a disaster."], ["Aaron S.", "I stumbled upon this place when I was randomly finding restaurants on Yelp. Their menu looked great, so I decided to make a reservation. This restaurant has a casual, modern, and romantic ambiance. It's a great place to take a date. We stared at the menu for a while. I wanted to order so many things, but we ended up getting the Cavolifiore, Panzerotti, and the Special of the Day (I have no idea what it's called). Cavolfiore: I don't really like cauliflowers, but I could eat a bucket of these. The cauliflower was breaded perfectly. The outside coating was crisp, while the cauliflower inside was tender. The side of spicy aioli made it a lot better. It's kind of pricey for the serving size. Panzerotti: three fried calzones with marinara sauce and mozzarella inside. It's like a big, gourmet pizza roll. It was just alright. it is just cheese and carbs, but the filling was good. It's not my type of dish, but if you love cheesy bread, then try this. Special of the Day: a whole lobster cut in half with pasta in a slightly spicy lobster bisque mixed with crab meat. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS! The lobster was cooked perfectly, and the noodles were al dente. There was an abundance of crab meat scattered on top of the noodles. The lobster bisque coating the noodles was so flavorful; it didn't taste like the ocean. It's enough to share between two people, but I could've easily eaten it all by myself. Overall, this is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. The food wasn't too heavy and loaded with cheese. Although the portions are somewhat small for the price, it is well worth it. It seems like they focus more on quality than quantity, which is a good change from other places that gives you heaps of mediocre food. I will definitely come back again to try their other dishes!"], ["Brett S.", "I've read some negative review about this restaurant but my experience was very good. I had the butchers steak with potatoes and arugula salad.. It was delicious! As an appetizer we ordered a cheese board which was also very good. By far my favorite item of the night was the sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. It was absolutely delicious and recommend this to anyone. First time at Monello and will be back again!"], ["Sharon L.", "An interesting spin on happy hour: when you order a drink, complimentary, bite-sized dishes are paraded to each table. The dishes are not great (small items smothered in cheese, roasted brussels sprouts, tiny chicken skewers, unshelled lupini beans) but it's a nice treat and makes me feel sorta special. I'm not a fan of their sweet vermouth, which is made in house. The raspa dura cheese is a don't-miss, especially when it's piled high atop a nicely charred pizza. The monello pizza is outta-this-world delicious. The crust is up there with Pizzeria Bruno and Buon Forchetta. It's the stuff dreams are made of."], ["Courtney H.", "Had a delicious visit for SDRW. They offer a 3-course lunch meal for $20. We started with a complimentary dish of some type of beans, which I first thought were oyster crackers, and that you eat like edamame - got all that? They had a salty, sea taste and I ended up eating them whole. We ordered the foccacia which was served with a flavorful dipping sauce and started off our \"love of carbs\" meal off right. My friend and I started with salads (although I do want to go back for the cauliflower). My caesar was beautifully put together and the dressing tangy just like I like. I ordered the lasagna which was a tasty portion of spinach pasta sheets, meat sauce and cheeses. It was decadent, but nearly as much as the spaghetti my friend ordered. This is similar to Alfredo, the sauce a macaroni and cheese taste -- so if you are looking for red sauce with this dish, it doesn't not have it. Both portions were enough to take home for leftovers. After the heavier lunch meal, we each had a fruit sorbet.Our service was top notch and the decor clean and simple. I am fan of next door's Bencotto as well, but Monello may have a few more options to choose from. One of new favorites in Little Italy."], ["Nayef A.", "Ridiculous food!

Most places smother their pastas with cheese, salt, or sour tomato sauce. Most places use the same sauce for all their pastas and pizzas.Monello earned my respect. If you are in the mood for pasta, choose between spaghetti, macaroni, or gnocchi. Choose from seven to ten different home made, unique sauces. My husband got carbonara (bacon, cheese, and egg sauce with ground pepper) which ended up being super rich. I got ragu, which was perfectly seasoned and meaty.If you are in the mood for pizzas, delicious selection but margherita is their best. My friends who were there told us Monello's pizzas are almost identical to how it is done in Italy. If that doesn't convince you it is good, then you are missing out.For large groups, I recommend getting their carchuterie board of Italian meats and cheeses.Note: They give you lupini beans as a small appetizer for free. Peel the yellow skin otherwise you will have an interesting experience and a bad taste in your mouth. Also note, their breadsticks are long thin sticks made of bread dough. Don't expect the soft ones you find at Olive Garden at your local mall."], ["Mike V.", "I found the best Pizza and most enjoyable restaurant in little Italy, I'm a regular at Po Pazzo but for a nice change we go to Monello, what a great staff and the food is so delicious, you don't want to miss this place.Mikey V"], ["Erica B.", "Happen to stop in for brunch on Saturday.

This restaurant is like the cheaper version of the Italian please next door closer to India street. Same chef and owner. Similar menu but less selection here than the more expensive one.

So we all decided to give it a whirl!We all got seated immediately by the bar and the waitress came by to take our drink order & asked if we had any questions. I got my glass of Moscato and ordered a grilled chicken breast on top of a bed of peppery arugula and fresh tomatoes with a heaping amount of their shaved homemade Parmesan cheese drizzle with a balsamic reduction! My friends got the gnocchi in an olive oil and Parmesan sauce, and the squid ink spaghetti with lobster. We nibbled on the focaccia while waiting for food. It was heaven on Earth as we all did family style and took bites of each other's meal! Everything was pure PERFECTION! I wish I had a bit more of that sauce because it amped up the flavors more! Although we were full, there's always room for dessert! However we should of stopped there. We unanimously wanted the tiramisu, but I'm always skeptical because no one can ever make tiramisu like my hometown Sicilian! Then I looked down on that menu with a tiny asterisk next to it and what my eyes led to was you have to be 21 to order it. Well that's odd! I know there's rum but only enough to barely taste it. WRONG! We took a shot of rum with lady fingers, mascarpone, & cocoa mixed in it! I'm sorry but that was the grossest thing ever! The more you went to the bottom, the drunker you got! Although it was the size of a tea cup we left the remains in it. Dinner amazing! Dessert not so much. Tiramisu is NOT for everyone."], ["Helen W.", "The food here is just so good!

My only wish was that although the owners are Italian, the waiters are so young and not ITALIAN! They butcher the pronunciation of the food items and just so blawwww.

There was so much seafood that we didn't have to fish for it - you know how when you get a seafood dish, a lot of the time there is a limited amount of fish so you kind of have to poke around to get some? This was not like that. Every single bite was so full with seafood that you would have to DODGE the scallops and shrimp (which is ridiculous, why would anyone do that?). It was so good.Final course was sorbet? Or maybe it was a gelato? This was a couple of Manhattans deep. I am dying to remember what the second dessert was that we got.

The sweet vermouth (free samples because we were first timers---super nice gesture!) was very good and a real treat. We shared the fresh mozzarella. \u00a0It didn't have much flavor. I ordered the burrata (sp?) and ended up gutting each slice and only eating the insides because the flat bread was so bland. \u00a0Even so, the filling of cheese, prosciutto, and arugula was good, but not delicious. The tiramisu was quite good, but scanty for $9. \u00a0My husband thought the chairs were very uncomfortable.

They specialize their drinks with Vermouth, and their signature cocktails do not disappoint!What we liked best was that with your drinks they had also served tapas as well, so the only dishes that we ordered that night were the pizza and grilled octopus.I highly recommend trying the grilled octopus! I have never tasted anything like it, and it was absolutely delicious!

It resides directly next door to Bencotto, sharing the same ownership from what I understand. Three of us made reservations recently for a Saturday night dinner.Monello has a vibrant atmosphere. It's thoughtfully designed, and it showcases an aesthetic that is both hip and sophisticated. It embraces the San Diego casual approach to dining quite well. Space is very nice.We all started with a round of drinks. I had a glass of a Cabernet. I loved it, eventually having a second glass when my meal arrived. I kept waiting for a bread basket to be brought to the table, but it never came. Explanation? It's not complimentary; you must order it from the menu. A little unusual, in my opinion. I opted to pass on the notion of our party having to pay $$ for bread.I decided to begin with a Caesar salad, while my dining companions opted to share Monello's version of fried calamari. The Caesar is prepared with whole romaine hearts, in lieu of the greens being ripped or torn. The presentation was quite nice, but, overall, the salad was rather dry. It suffered fro being under-dressed, sadly.For my entree, I just couldn't pass up the Carbonara, and I'm extremely grateful that I didn't. Such a rich, flavorful and decadent menu item! The spaghetti was cooked a perfect al dente, and the generous amount of bacon and pecorino made the dish that much more sinful. I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. It was the shining star of the evening, without a doubt. The verdict is still out on Monello for me. The salad foible and bread dilemma irks me. I'd like to go back."], ["Elen H.", "Monello (Italian for \"brat\" I heard) is a glossy Italian eatery serving pizzas, handmade pastas and brunch on Saturday/Sunday. \u00a0It's the younger sibling of Bencotto (the restaurant next door) and just as tasty, but a little more modern. \u00a0Bencotto is probably better for pasta; they seemed to have more choices in that category and it's priced a little lower. \u00a0On the other hand, the selection of pizzas and street foods is better at Monello. \u00a0I guess it just depends on what you're looking for. \u00a0A lot of things make Monello unique and inspired me to write them a five star review (I don't write many). \u00a0LUPINI BEANS: served as a small starter (free). \u00a0You would be advised to peel them. \u00a0Very tasty, ours came with lots of rosemary = yumm. VERMOUTH: \u00a0They make their own sweet vermouth in-house. \u00a0I'm not a huge vermouth fan, but it's something different. HAPPY HOUR: \u00a0When you order a drink during happy hour, rather than a discount, the chef sends out around 3 tiny plates of food. \u00a0We received roasted potatoes with some kind of really good sauce, a cheese-egg sandwich, and a ravioli. \u00a0It sounds underwhelming, but with the great quality and variety of cheeses/breads/sauces used here, you won't be disappointed. \u00a0My only complaint would be that the drinks/beer/wine here are pretty pricy. \u00a0You can get the same quality elsewhere for quite a bit less. \u00a0That being said, I would probably only order a drink during happy hour, the tasty bite-sized dishes are well worth the few extra bucks."], ["Elyse S.", "This place lived up to the hype! We had the Raspa Dura, Fried Calzones and split the Spaghetti Carbonara and everything was delicious. The atmosphere is snappy casual, trendy and perfect for a date or night out with the girls.

The neri was delicious and came with plenty of seasfood inside. The pizza was just as amazing as the pasta. The sauce was not too sweet nor bitter. The staff working there were overly nice and frequently checked up on how we were doing. The prices were reasonable especially the drink menu."], ["Adrienne B.", "I stumbled across this place in little Italy. First we sat outside which I loved! I think any restaurant with outdoor seating is a plus. Secondly we ordered the Cabernet for wine. It was a perfect wine to go with our pasta! We ordered the lobster bisque to start which was good. I wouldn't say it was the best I ever had, but it was good. Secondly we had the polenta with short rib. I could of ate that all night!!!!! The flavor just melts in your mouth! Lastly.. Our main entree was the Neri pasta! Our waiter told us it won many awards.. So we gave it a shot! I thought it was very tasty.. But you have to like lobster and octopus to enjoy this dish. The service was ok.. We felt a little rushed by our waiter.. Maybe because we had reservations at 8:30 and the restaurant closed at 9? He was nice.. Just felt a little rushed.

But Monello gets it right with their signature Monello pizza. Chewy crust perfectly fired up in their oven, topped with homemade sausage, bell peppers, spinach and the piece de resistance: raspa dura AKA deliciously light, thinly sliced, melts instantly in your mouth cheese. Unless you can find this cheese easily in your local market, I'm gonna be heading straight to Monello for this deliciousness.I absolutely loved eating here during lunch hours. We always arrived early before any crowds so parking was a breeze (a rarity in Little Italy!) and we were sat right away. Wait staff was very attentive, friendly and willing to go the extra mile to serve us promptly. Though I started this review raving about the Monello pizza, I also very much enjoyed my verdure sandwich on my first visit: grilled zucchini, eggplant, goat cheese and black olive aioli. The sandwich came with their homemade sweet potato chips, thinly sliced, crisp and flavorful.I didn't think I could love Monello as much as its sister restaurant next door. But currently they are neck in neck for my favorite place to eat in Little Italy. Looks like I need to plan my next visits to these places very soon..."], ["Jade Z.", "I love Monello! It's hard to choose between Monello and Bencotto, tonight we chose Monello! For starters we had the Rosemary focaccia with Monello dip which is seasoned olive oil, so yummy and great to munch on while you drink and chat. I had the carbonara, the pasta was the perfect texture i loved every bite. My husband ordered the bencotto pizza, cheesy and crunchy everything you want in a pizza!

I must admit it was quite big though enough to feed a family of 4. We also got the truffle fries which were just as a good as it sounds. For dessert we got the pumpkin tiramisu. OMG it was the best tiramisu I've ever tasted!!! It even had pieces of fresh pumpkin with just the right texture. In a way it was like having bread pudding in a mason jar. But so flavorful. With it we had coffee to balance the sweetness. Our bartender was great and often checked up on us.

We had a very hard time finding the right place for our rehearsal dinner, and when a friend recommended Cucina Urbana, we went to try it out. We told the waiter that we were considering the restaurant for our dinner, and he was super helpful. He had us try items that would be on the special dinner menus and showed us the space where dinner parties are held. We had a beyond incredible dinner, and decided to book them.When I got in touch with the restaurant to host the dinner, the lady I worked with was super accommodating. She took care of all details--From menu choice, to wine choice, to having floral centerpieces. The rehearsal dinner itself was amazing--The wine room space where the dinner was held is off to the side, so it's a bit more secluded from the rest of the restaurant. The food was served family style and all of it was DELICIOUS. My husband and I are vegetarians, and the waitress made it so that a few of the dishes that were not vegetarian could be. (Just for us!) She even had a special dish made for one of our vegan guests. We never wanted for wine or champagne, and everything with the dinner was handled quickly and gracefully. It was an incredible dinner. If you need to book a rehearsal dinner, do it here! They took care of us entirely, which was so refreshing during the wedding planning process."], ["Justin A.", "This restaurant has been reviewed verbatim, but let me just say a few things:1) They have Billecart Brut and Rose on the menu.Awesome.2) Even though this place is a bit large, I really love the vibe here.

I only ordered a glass of the chianti but i've tried their cocktails and they are made very well!Appetizers:Stuffed fried squash blossoms (4 stars)- herb ricotta + opal basil pesto + lemon aioli. The lemon aioli makes this dish, the squash blossoms are good, just wish they didn't keep such a long stem on it, still nice and warm and the ricotta oozing out is amazing.Burrata + prosciutto 'caprese' (4 stars)- heirloom tomato + arugula + gaeta olive + aged balsamic. Good! I love how thin the prosciutto is, tomatoes were pretty good, and well burrata is good with almost anything! Nice light appetizer.Dinner:Risotto Special (4 stars)- Got this the first time since they had a special, it was really good, had a balsamic drizzle mmm.Margherita Pizza (2 stars)- san marzano tomato + house made mozzarella + basil- I didn't like this pizza at all, the crust was too thick for me, there was way too much sauce and not enough cheese, just did not work for me, I've had way better even at a fast pizza joint. They were trying to make it thin and crispy but just failed miserably. Agnolotti (5 stars)- sweet corn + sorrel + cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche + speck + chili oil- Now this was really good, sweet corn is almost always delicious, the sauce was good and the saltiness of the speck went perfectly with it, highly recommend!Pappardelle (4.5 stars) short rib + cremini mushroom + carrot + parmigiano- Had this the first time I came, really tender short rib, great sauce, different with the carrot but it worked for me. Sides:Polenta board (5 stars)- creamy mascarpone polenta + chef's ragu- This is definitely a MUST ORDER. Had this twice and both times were great, the chef always changes his ragu, first time I had a beef ragu which was my favorite, it was so tender. This last time was pork and the flavor was still there but it was a little tough, that was the only setback.truffle parmesan fries (4 stars)- Good fries and something good to snack on, sometimes found it a little over salted. Dessert:peach + almond crostata (3 stars)- buttermilk gelato + chamomile honey*- This was an ok dessert for me, the buttermilk gelato was amazing just not a huge fan of crostata's or tart's they are still too dry for me.Gelato and sorbet sampler (4.5 stars)- First time we had this with blood orange, lemon, melon, and I forgot the last flavor, but I remember we were all fighting over it and finished it, they had good flavors the first time. The last time we went they had the worst flavors!!! Like grape, blueberry, ugh.Anyways good Italian place in SD, I would just steer clear of the pizza's!

Vibe: For a pricier venue that practically necessitates dinner reservations, the general dress code was pretty casual. T-shirts and jeans were completely fine on a Sunday night. We were some of the better dressed in more business casual attire. The place had pretty much every table filled the entire time we were there (7:00-8:15ish). I was happy we got seated at a wall table since the center of the restaurant provided little to no privacy whatsoever. Service: The hostesses were friendly and accommodating and our server was dependable. There were bussers who floated around clearing tables and filling waters throughout the service. There was one change of table setting after our appetizer round. Food: \u00a0Burrata and garlic vasi - the bread was the main component with six very thickly cut slices of three different breads. I personally would have preferred the burrata to be the star of the dish rather than a mere spread. Squash blossoms - very good. Reminiscent of tempura vegetables with a small amount of creamy filling. Caesar salad - liked the capers as a substitute for anchovies. Soft polenta \"croutons\" were an interesting choice. Overall, a satisfying new spin on a traditional dish. Cauliflower - the dates sold me. The texture was good, flavor was decent... Another interesting combination of ingredients. Short rib pappardelle - probably my favorite dish of the night (despite the mushrooms). Tender meat, rich sauce, and perfectly al dente pasta made it a solid order. We had no room for dessert but maybe next time when we come back for 1/2 off polenta on a Wednesday! For all the pomp and circumstance, I was expecting amuse bouches, classy dining (not being surrounded by kids and t-shirts), and inedible sprigs and garnishes.

They sell wines by the bottle at retail price and then charge an $8 corkage fee with the option to take home the rest of the bottle if you don't finish it. The BF and I splurged!

They were extremely attentive and very patient with us. The highlight of any restaurant, the food, did not disappoint. Between the two of us, we had the burnt Brussel sprouts, Bucatini, seafood lasagna and the almond torte to finish the meal. Everything was delicious, but some dishes stood out more than the others. My personal favorites were the Brussel sprouts and seafood lasagna. The Brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked, with a nice, crispy char on the skin. Lots of times, the inside of the sprouts are undercooked but these were perfection. The seafood lasagna was another personal favorite with plenty of seafood coupled with high quality ingredients to create such a nice flavor. The other dishes were good as well, but I found the Bucatini to be slightly heavy on the salt and the torte tasting slightly like medicine. Not sure why, the ice cream, we couldn't quite distinguish the flavor, but it kept reminding me of medicine.

Wine is priced without markups and they add an 8 dollar corkage fee on top of that-so you end up saving a ton compared to traditional places.

As we were finishing our sprouts the bus boy took our plates before we were finished..ok weird but whatever. Then the octopus and pizza came out at the same time....questionable...and they were BOTH COLD. Like not lukewarm, but rubbery cold octopus and congealed cheese cold.

I came here for my boyfriend's birthday and we were both underwhelmed. We started off with the truffle fries and cherry tomato vasi. I highly recommend the vasi. For entrees, I got the short rib pappardelle pasta and he got the beer braised lamb shank. My pasta was too salty and I couldn't finish it. The lamb was okay nothing memorable.The restaurant was beautiful with its rustic feeling. I'll definitely come back another time before I rule this place out."], ["Aileen A.", "Overall, I was very happy with my experience. Food was delicious, staff were friendly, and service was prompt. I give 4/5 stars overall because we forgot our boxed food =\\ they give you a little \"claim\" tag to pick up your food on your way out, but we forgot about it, and the tag was buried under a napkin by the end of our meal. Wish they would have brought it to us with our checks. Can't blame them entirely, we were in a moderate food coma from eating so much :)- Food: my friend and I shared Parmesan fries, Brussels sprouts, carpaccio, margarita pizza, and the pappardelle. Everything was brought out at an appropriate time, as if it was perfectly planned ahead of time. We ordered too much food, but don't regret it! It was delicious. The carpaccio was outstanding, I would recommend it without a doubt. - Drinks: tried a few cocktails - one with watermelon and another with cucumber. Both were phenomenal recommendations by our server; not overly sweet, perfectly balanced. - Atmosphere: we had an earlier dinner at ~545pm, and the place was relatively empty. We left around 7pm and it was packed. The lighting in the center of the dining room was dim, but we sat on the side so there was more light (which I prefer). Wasn't terribly noisy. I would go back again, should I visit San Diego again!"], ["Becca T.", "WOW. WOW. WOW. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Absolutely great service by every worker we encountered! Hostess, busser, waitress, even other employees that we happened to walk by said a friendly and sincere 'hello'. A++ on customer service. Ambiance is so cute, perfect place for a date or family dinner. Now, on to the food. Absolutely everything was delicious. My friend said it was the best meal she's had in *years*. We ordered: the rabbit sausage ravioli, the beet salad thing, truffle fries, yummy bread, delicious wine....you can't make a bad decision.This place is seriously the best, A+ all around."], ["Suzanne R.", "Now THIS place was awesome! You definitely need to come here. The ambiance, the interior design, the staff, THE FOOD, the cocktails - everything was a WIN! We ordered the meatball, for an appetizer. No joke, I will return just for that meatball. It was deliciously seasoned, both the meat and the red sauce. The melted cheese on top was perfection.For a main dish, we ordered the rigatoni and the pepperoni/fennel sausage pizza. Both were excellent.For cocktails, we ordered the Mexican Mule and the Manzarita. Just a heads-up, the Mexican Mule was very spicy. The tequila in the Mexican Mule had \"red jalape\u00f1o tequila.\" Spicy, but very good! The Manzarita had apple cider, tequila, st. germain, and cinnamon. Yum!And, Kevin, our server, was the best! Hope to see him again soon. Great staff, overall."], ["Lillian C.", "Came here for a celebratory dinner and received amazing service! The food is excellent, the ambiance is excellent with its modern metal chic vibes, and the service was excellent. The short rib papardalle is a must-get for me every time I go with beef and carrots that are so tender that they melt in your mouth immediately. Absolutely delicious. Not a huge fan of the texture of the pasta that is used though because it is a thicker and rougher noodle but still nonetheless delicious. The polenta board is MOUTHWATERING. They pour out the polenta and the meat that they use for the night in front of you and spread it on a wooden plank. The polenta is warm and savory and tastes like mashed potatoes with some extra cheese and flavor in it. It mixes perfectly with the tender beef that is placed on top.The burnt brussel sprouts were good as well although they were a bit bitter. They're served with a spicy sauce that adds a little something extra to some healthy veggies which I loved."], ["Tran N.", "Fork-licking delicious kinda food... As I was leaving, I was already planning when to come back! Make reservations ahead, this location gets booked. I love the restaurants decor, rustic but with a romantic ambience. Parking: There is valet, but you can probably easily find street parking! Their cocktails are very strong! Though their homegrown cocktail Honey crisp was so good! (Come on Saturday and post a selfie of yourself and use #CUCINAselfie and \"geotag\" your location for $1 homegrown cocktail! Maybe you can find mine on Instagram ;)) The food, where do I start?! I loved the short rib pappardelle there was so much flavor and the short rib was so tender. As for my friend's Duroc pork chop it was cooked so perfectly!! Even at medium well, it was so juicy and tender. I was not a big fan of their truffle Parmesan fries and the burnt Brussels sprout was okay."], ["Kristine H.", "This place is amazing - possibly my new favorite restaurant! Everything from the decor, to the food, to the service is impeccable. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the way they brought out the food was entertaining. I love how everything they make is fresh - pasta down to the gelato/sorbets. The croutons on the salad were delicious (totally not your average croutons). Daryl was fantastic! He had great recommendations. For the entire night, our waters were never empty, not because we didn't drink water, but because they were on top of it with refilling! All in all, the overall vibe of the restaurant is wonderful. Will definitely be back!"], ["Steve S.", "Great place! Very cool setting, great service and food!

Thank you guys"], ["Michelle M.", "I've been here for a few different occasions and I can only seem to order the same things every time I come here.Some of my \"usuals\" are short rib pappadelle and truffle fries. Every time I order them, these items are pretty consistent and flavor/quality stays the same. By far, these two are my go-to and never fail me. The truffle fries are also one of the best I've tasted. I've also gotten the lavender lemonade a few times, but I've seen inconsistencies - some too sweet, some too floral of a taste or no floral taste. I guess it just depends on whomever is making it.This recent visit I ordered the rabbit sausage with ricotta ravioli, rib eye carpaccio, aquazul for a non-alcoholic drink. The carpaccio was a pretty large plate with mushroom, parmesan, and aioli. The rabbit sausage ravioli was jam packed with a lot of flavor, definitely making it the star of the dish. As for my drink, the aquazul consisted of strawberry, mint, lime, ginger, and soda.If you do have leftover food to take home, they box it up and put it in the front desk refrigerator for you to pick up on your way out.

We came here with my parents without a reservation, but everyone there (especially the bartenders and waiters) did their best to get us seated by the bar.

Need a place to eat dinner? GO HERE.The food, service, and general ambiance were all on point. It is very hard to find a place that scores well in all three. Service: from the minute we walked into the restaurant until the minute we left the service was top notch. This did not seem like a kid friendly restaurant yet the service staff never once made us feel bad for bringing our young child, in fact they were amazing. They were on top of everything and brought out the food promptly (go back of house!) which was great because we were starving. Best part of the service was this: we asked for our leftovers to be boxed and they said no problem. They took away the food and then shortly later brought us a small laminated ticket to present to the hostess desk when we left. There our food was, waiting for us in a refrigerated case with the matching ticket number attached. I was in heaven, this made my night and I wish it was replicated in all restaurants. Valet service for leftovers...yes!Food: we had the smoked trout pate, cucumber and calamari panzanella, rabbit ravioli, and cherry tiramisu. The smoked trout wasn't briny enough for me but I could see a lot of other people liking it. The panzanella though was so good I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and die happy. I have never had calamari cooked that perfectly. Dear back of house of Cucina Urbana, thank you for this dish alone, it was perfect. The ravioli was delicious but too much cheese not enough rabbit. The tiramisu was also quite good and in a jar! Could have used more cherry flavor but nevertheless I ate every bit in there.Ambiance: has all of the features of a standard hipster style restaurant but the chairs were particularly comfortable which uncommon these days. While the restaurant's decor was hipster the crowd was definitely all of the place which I appreciated and felt quite comfortable.I can't wait to go back!"], ["Lily P.", "Great shortrib pappardelle (huge pieces of short rib and thick pappardelle)Beet and Blood Orange salad was REALLY good and the chopped salad was another good filling salad to get. The beet salad was beautiful and filling. Bucatini pasta was filling. The large meatball (single) app was big but good to split and flavorful.

This was not the case with this establishment.We started off with the Cucina meatballs for our appetizer and they were absolutely delicious. The tomato sauce that they used was to die for. I got the casalingo pepperoni + fennel sausage pizza, while my girlfriend got the bucatini pasta. The pizza was great, but after taking a bite of the bucatini, I regretted not getting a plate myself. Oh well, next time.The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service is great. I think my cup was void of water for 20 seconds at the longest, if it was ever allowed to be empty at all. The staff was very attentive and friendly even though the restaurant was packed for dinner. As is usual with many San Diego restaurants, it was a little pricey.

The place seemed pretty crowded but that didn't seem to affect the great service even though the restaurant was overflowing with people but then again it was Saturday night. We started our night with their prosciutto caprese salad which was deli-sh and their Gorgonzola mouse pear spread that came with crunch tasty bread. The spread was very light and flavorful and you can taste the many different ingredients. I decided on one of their pasta dishes the butcai and my boyfriend ventured to try their rabbit sausage. The pasta was absolutely scrumptious and very filling I had to take half of it home. Although I did not know what to expect from the rabbit sausage it was quite tasty and interesting, it was like nothing that I have ever tasted before so that was kind of an unique and memorable experience.

Well that just gives us another reason to come back."], ["Mia L.", "4.18: Am I tripping? We came back after a few more people told us that this place is super good. So I gave Cucina Urbana the benefit of the doubt and returned. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. So I asked a few friends and I read reviews again. What shall I order?We were a bit stuck in traffic and was lucky to find parking after about after 3-4 minutes. We were about 9 minutes late. We walked in and I mentioned we were late, the hostess said \"You just made it right on time, we have a 10 minute grace period\". She didn't say hi, she just checked her computer and then that was her response. Okay then, thanks for the heads up, would have been nice to get a phone call. What would have happen if we were 11 minutes late? There was no one waiting, would she make us wait? We came pretty early with reservations at 6pm, it was close to full but still room.

I can't believe this was a $17 dish. Two rolled pasta about 5 inches tall and 1 inch wide. - Lamb Shank: The best dish out of all the dishes we had. Full of flavor and perfect sauce. Yummy!! \u00a0- Short Rib Pappardelle: I sat there waiting for someone to say something after I took a bite. Maybe it's just me? I didn't like it, I can't even eat anymore of it because it was so salty. Then it came, my fiance's parents both started stating how they think the short rib papprdelle is super salty.

The food, the wine, and the company all made for an amazing first time dining experience at Cucina Urbana.Recently, I went back to celebrate an anniversary and we were treated so wonderfully! The hostess offered us glasses of prosecco to start. We had brought our own bottle of wine to enjoy with our meal ($20 corkage fee, waived on \"sinful Sundays\" if you purchase any bottle at the restaurant that's over $20).Our first appetizer, the stuffed fried squash blossoms, was delightful. The herb ricotta was surprisingly light and the lemon aioli provided a nice freshness to the dish. Next, we had the grilled octopus, which was cooked perfectly. The tomato sauce that the dish comes with is much richer and heavier, especially right after eating the airy and light squash blossoms.For our entrees, we opted for the agnolotti and the short rib pappardelle. The sweet corn and creme fraiche in the agnolotti was amazing! Slightly sweety with a hint of salt and spice... absolutely delicious! Finally, the short rib pappardelle was my favorite dish the first time I dined at Cucina Urbana and it definitely still is. The short rib was tender, the mushroom sauce was delectable, and the pappardelle was perfectly al dente.I wish I had a bigger stomach to try more dishes, but that just means I'll have to come back \u00a0again and again."], ["Adrienne K.", "Well, it lives up to the hype.

I'm not even kidding. If you aren't convinced by the tons of Yelp photos, you can tell by the raving reviews that this place is legit.I haven't spent that much time in Little Italy, but I finally got to check this place out recently with a friend, who said that this is her and her fianc\u00e9e's go-to date spot. I can see why. The d\u00e9cor of CU is modern and stylish, and even though it was convenient to sit at the bar, I already resolve to sit at an actual table next time so I can really enjoy and take in the eatery's contemporary ambience.My friend said the menu here always changes, based on the chef's picks and what's in season. Definitely take advantage of Happy Hour (3-6 p.m.) if you're a fan of the drinks (my friend says that the cocktails here, in particular, are amazing) but it's also worthwhile to note that those amazing \"Truffle Parmesan Fries\" are included on the HH menu.We decided to split three different dishes so I could try several items from the menu, and I really loved the flavor and presentation of everything we got. My portion of the bill came out to about $30, which is more than I usually spend on dinner, but the food--ingredients and taste--were definitely worth it. This is a great place to bring out-of-town guests if they want legit Italian food, or it's also a great place for a date night.Here's what we got, after some contemplation because I wanted to try everything:\"Truffle Parmesan Fries\": I feel like \"Truffle Parmesan Fries\" can be hit or miss sometimes. Sometimes the fries are too thin and crispy for my liking; other times, it's lacking in flavor and I can hardly taste the truffle or cheese. But CU's version of this popular app is amazing. Phenomenal. And highly, highly addictive. If you're getting one appetizer from this place, get these fries ... and you may not even want to share once you do. The fries are on the skinnier side, but they're not super crunchy and crispy (at least, I still encountered some soggy ones that met my fancy). They're accompanied by homemade ketchup and my friend ordered garlic aioli on the side as well. I normally don't even like ketchup but this homemade ketchup was BOMB. I still preferred the aioli, though, since it had a garlicky taste and a slight kick. I seriously could NOT stop eating these fries once they were brought to our table. Hands down some of the best fries I've ever had.\"Lamb Sausage + Honey Ricotta Pizza\": Since my friend said the pizzas here are usually good, we went with this one because the sausage and cheese combo sounded delicious. This pizza also came topped with gaeta olives, baby chard and fontina. All of the pizza toppings melded together so nicely; this has to be one of the best combos that I've ever had. I didn't really eat the olives, but there wasn't a plentiful amount. I don't usually eat chard, but it seemed to complement the other flavors. I absolutely love ricotta and fontina cheeses; you get the savory element from the moist, juicy lamb sausage (perfect round-shaped bites) that's balanced by the slightly sweet ricotta. I enjoyed every single bite of that pizza and wouldn't hesitate to order it again! The crust was thin but not burnt and not too crispy; it was baked at the perfect temperature to deliver the best crunch and texture.\"Rigatoni Bolognese\": I wish there was a description of this dish on the menu so I knew exactly what was in it, but I really liked this pasta dish that we ordered. I tend to be wary of dishes that comprise tomato/marinara sauce because I'm not the hugest fan of tomatoes, but this entr\u00e9e was delicious. The tubes of pasta tasted fresh, and the amount of sauce was sufficient for taste, but not overwhelming. I think my favorite part of the dish, though, were the dollops of herbed ricotta that were around the bowl. You could enjoy your pasta and swirl it around in the cheese, which was melting throughout. CU certainly gets an A++ for presentation, and even though I was getting full by this time (half a pizza and all those fries later), I definitely got my fair share of this dish. I was glad that we ordered several dishes to share because I felt that I got a good sampling of what CU had to offer.\"Hen of the Woods\": This is the other pizza that I had contemplated ordering ... but maybe next time. It features cremini, oyster mushrooms, goat cheese, fried onions and truffle oil. Since I'm a huge fan of goat cheese and truffle oil, I naturally wanted to order this pizza. I'm not sure if I've ever had oyster mushrooms, but because everything else on this pizza sounds amazing, I'm down to give those mushrooms a chance.\"Casalingo Pepperoni + Fennel Sausage\": Though this was one of the plainer pizzas on the menu, sometimes simple is best and I would give this pizza a chance. You get your basic mozzarella, peppadew pepper and fennel sausage topping, and I'm sure I would especially enjoy the flavor of that savory sausage."], ["Katina K.", "This is no regular Italian food restaurant. The chef mixes good old Italian food with a little bit of a progressive touch. I have been wanting to come here for awhile and finally made it out to the restaurant. Upon walking in I was immediately in awe by the decor of the inside. I had a reservation with my friend and we were seated immediately as soon as we checked in with the hostess. Shortly after our waitress, Caroline, greeted us and spoke a little bit about the menu. Since my friend and I got there with 15 minutes to spare in happy hour we were scrambling on what to order so we could get a deal. Thursday's they have half off pizza (making some of them $8, yes please!) during happy hour so we jumped on that! We ordered the prosciutto and Brussels pizza. We asked her to hold out on sending it to the kitchen though so we could have an appetizer first. We were still able to get the happy hour special though which was awesome!! For starters we went with a cheese and salami board. I highly recommend the Robiola bosina and Rustichella Tartufi pecorino cheeses. One is a softer cheese like a Brie and the other is a harder cheese, I forget which is which but both were delicious! After our starter we put in an order for the bolognese pasta and had our pizza sent in. The pizza came out first and it couldn't have been more perfect. The crust was cooked just right and it wasn't an overly doughy pizza, perfecto! Then came the pasta... Amazing!!! Sometimes with bolognese pasta it is just swimming in meat, this pasta however was done just right. Perfect amount of meat to pasta ratio. Plus there's this herb ricotta they put in the pasta that just took it over the top. Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but all the desserts looked great as well! The service was impeccable. Caroline was great but also the food runners and other helpers on staff never let a water glass go empty for too long and constantly were cleaning up our table which was so nice. So sad I'll be moving from San Diego in a week or I'd come back here every month because it was so perfect in every way!"], ["Sarah T.", "Had a great meal! \u00a0Kevin our waiter was warm and had great suggestions. \u00a0We asked for a Zinfandel and he brought out a great bottle. \u00a0We had the burrata for an appetizer. \u00a0It was cool, creamy and perfect little bite with the wine before the pizza! \u00a0I love meaty and spicy pizza and it was no trouble adding spice to our pizza on the menu. \u00a0He knew I liked spice and brought a cool, spicy tomato sauce to top the pizza with and it was delicious! \u00a0 \u00a0Will for sure go back"], ["Chansamone O.", "The food and service is really spot on here. It was our first visit and we are glad we went. The ingredients are fresh and you can taste it in the meal. We ordered the grilled octopus, seafood lasagna, and pappardelle pasta. Everything was absolutely delicious. We really enjoyed our date night here."], ["Judy T.", "Great service, delectable food and wonderful environment. You can read everything else from the other reviews but I have to compliment the staff for their attentive service and the amount of detail in every dish I ate. I had the roasted cauliflower, polenta ( creamier and better tasting than mashed potatoes or pureed cauliflower) and the pasta dish. Add a bottle of champagne and a birthday dessert and you've got a perfect meal.Perfect."], ["Shirley R.", "I was recommended by my coworkers to try this restaurant and it was a good experience! The atmosphere was really nice. My bf and I arrived around 8:05, reservations were at 8:15, didn't get seated til around 8:30-8:40. Our waiter was incredibly nice and gave a nice breakdown of his favorite items upon my request, which was about half the menu, but hey that's a good sign! I ordered from the restaurant week menu - ricotta squash blossom? Short rib pasta? And chocolate... Pudding? I'm horrible with unfamiliar terminology and just simple memorization, but that's pretty much what I had. The squash blossom was really good! It had a tempura-ish fry. Stems were like zucchini when I was expecting... Idk floral tasting stems? Short rib pasta was really rich for my liking. The noodles were excellent, but the sauce was a bit much. The chocolate dessert was just like pudding with a dollop of cream. The biscotti was okay. My favorite part of my experience was the music selection! They played mainly indie rock, so I was jammin all throughout dinner (:"], ["Jess R.", "I was taken here on a lovely date a few weeks back and everything AGAIN when it comes to the food and service, it was perfection! It was a tad dark and rather noisy, but hey misery meets company and I had a great company.I didn't realize I ate here months back bc everything looked so different from where I sat. So this restaurant has the different perspectives and views. Will def come back!"], ["Tori W.", "Love this place great service and great food! the short rib pasta is amazing =). I just recommend making reservations first."], ["Sharon L.", "I've visited three times and the final visit sealed the deal.During a past visit, I was not impressed with the mushroom pizza or the famous short rib pappardelle. I think it was too salty or something-or-other. I remember wishing for more pasta to offset the sauce. I vaguely remember a beet salad which was pretty good. More than anything, I enjoyed basking in the beautiful surroundings and watching beautiful people drink wine. Fast forward to another visit, when I tried the bucatini. It was very rich and quite good. Now onto last night, when my boyfriend decided to butter me up by taking me here. We shared the squash blossom appetizer. The fried portions were light and airy. The sauce was almost tangy. The slow ooze of ricotta from within the tender squash blossom was too much for words. The appetizer tasted so good that if people weren't sitting next to us, I would have licked the plate. We watched lovely, blistered pizzas escaping the oven and really wished we ordered one. Someone next to us dug into a lamb and sausage entree. My insides were dying. Luckily, our food arrived before I fainted from hunger. For his entree, he ordered his favorite, the short rib pappardelle. I don't know if the dishes have been tweaked or my taste buds changed but it was delicious. Even more delicious than the pappardelle was the campanelle with peas and proscuitto. It was such a satisfying, savory dish. The portions were perfect. I would order this dish again. Too bad that the pappardelle gets all the attention, because I think the campanelle was swoon-worthy.Service was kick ass. Everything was perfect. I was blown away. Great job, Cucina Urbana. Two thumbs and two toes up."], ["Joyce K.", "My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here and it was just beautiful! Our reservation was for 9:15pm and once we arrived, we waited about 5 mins to be seated. The decor is so romantic, beautiful and dimly lit. There are candles lit and lights hanging from the ceiling. The walls are lined with wooden decor and the center of the restaurant reminds me of Anthropologie. The food was just delicious! We were torn between ordering the burrata + prosciutto or the stuffed friend squash blossoms but our server recommended we go with the squash blossoms and I'm so glad we did!! The squash is stuffed with a ton of herb ricotta and basil pesto and then fried! Once you take a bite into the squash blossoms, the ricotta comes ooooozing out. Ugh! Heaven in my mouth! I wish there was more where that came from though =/Spicy shrimp puttanesca angel hair: 4 stars for the juicy jumbo shrimp, perfectly cooked pasta and delicious tangy tomato sauce. I didn't think the dish was spicy at all.... That might just be me though since I'm able to tolerate quite spicy foods. Hen of the Woods pizza: 3 stars. It wasn't my favorite dish and nothing extraordinary about it. Even though the goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil was delicious, the pizza crust was crisp, I just felt like something was missing. After reading reviews, I wish we had added the fennel sausage or egg on top.Also, I wish our server was a bit more attentive and helpful with us, it just seemed like he wanted to take our order and get on with it. I don't have much to say about the service here. I'm looking forward to trying the other locations that Cucina has to offer! I hope to give this place 5 stars on my next visit!"], ["Luke O.", "Although I was staying at the Gaslamp district which had a lot of restaurants, this well reviewed place made me very curious what made this place stand out among the rest and hence I drove here to give it a try. I must say that the reviews and ratings were well deserved. This place was very popular, despite being a weekday night, the tables were all taken up and I was pretty fortunate to get a seat at the bar, which was still very spacious. It was my first time there and the service staff was very helpful and gave me very good recommendations, octopus, beef pasta and truffle fries (which many others here have recommended as well). Taste wise, I would say it's truely delicious and flavorful, and I kinda felt that the pasta was freshly made there, rather than the usual dry pasta. Moreover, the meat was extremely tender and well marinated, allowing the sauce to complement the pasta well. The octopus was grilled just right, not too chewy and not too soft. The flavors were retained well and it went well with the vegetables. Lastly, the truffle fries had the right amount of truffle taste, not too overpowering, just right. If you were to bring your date out for dinner, I would highly recommend this place, a reservation is definitely a must. Do come here for the happy hour, i missed it, but the menu looked pretty good."], ["Leigh P.", "Great experience! Came here with a friend and business partner for dinner on a Thursday night without a reservation. We only had the option to sit in the bar area, which is probably the only major deterrent to this space overall as the tables are right next to the front door. The other \"negative\" was just that we all felt extremely rushed - our appetizer came out before our drinks.But the FOOD was delicious!! All three of us shared an appetizer, a salad, and then each had an entr\u00e9e. Completed the meal with dessert and it was superb.if you want more detailed menu recommendations, message me on Lokely :)"], ["Stephanie W.", "Kevin was an amazing server! He took great care of us, gave wonderful recommendations, and even had the valet bring around our car for us because he knew we were off to an event next!The wine and food were incredible, as usual! You can't go wrong here. \u00a0:-)"], ["Suzanne T.", "My husband and I came here yesterday to celebrate our anniversary. We came for lunch since we were spending the whole day together.I let the host know it was our anniversary and all of the staff wished us a happy anniversary. The host sat us in one of the window seats where we can see the whole restaurant.Our waiter was great. He was very attentive without being smothering. I let him know I like ros\u00e9 wines and he recommended the Red Car Pinot Noir. It was an excellent choice. Very smooth and not overly sweet. He also recommended Moretti beer for my husband. The restaurant has it on tap and hubby said it was a good beer.I also let the waiter know about my wheat and walnut allergies and he was really nice about explaining the menu and what went into each dish. He also made recommendations and we ordered based on those. Appetizer - Grilled Octopus - tender and not chewy at all. It had great flavor. There wasn't really any chorizo in the dish, but its in the item description. I didn't miss it though and there wasn't a need for hummus in my opinion because the octopus was flavored superbly . \u00a0There are chickpeas in this dish and they were divine. My husband is not a bean fan but he liked the chickpeas. The sundried tomatoes were really great as well.Cucina Hero - my hubby ordered this sandwich and it came with truffle fries which were so good. I couldnt eat the sandwich due to the bread but my husband loved every bite. Short Rib Pappardelle - this dish was so great. I ordered mine with gluten free pasta. If you are a fan of beef that is super tender you will love this dish. The carrots and mushrooms were cooked to perfection. I am so hungry just thinking about this dish. Soooo good!By the time the dessert menu came, we were so stuffed so we ordered coffee instead to help with the food coma. Hubby ordered a Caffe Freddo, which is iced coffee. It was strong and had great flavor. I ordered a Caffe Shakerado and asked them not to add additional sugar and it was a great iced mocha. I could taste the coffee and the chocolate and they complemented each other instead of competing and being an overly sweet drink.While we were waiting to get our coffee our waiter brought us some complementary prosecco to help celebrate our day. I thought that was so nice. Besides the food and staff I loved the decor in this restaurant. We will definitely eat here again."], ["Jon W.", "This was my third visit, but first review. I learned of Cucina Urbana during my first vacation to San Diego, shortly after opening, when it was hip and new. Impressed with the food and service, my next vacation, Cucina Urbana was revisited. This held true to my most recent visit, which coincidentally fell on my wife's birthday.Both my wife, and myself, adore this restaurant. It's hard to find fault with perfection, and Cucina Urbana is as close to perfection one will find with a restaurant. Considering how busy the restaurant is operations, from a diners perspective, run seamlessly. Knowing my wife wanted to dine here on here birthday, I emailed the restaurant, through yelp, and received a reply from Tracy, the owner, shortly thereafter. I only wish she had sent a confirmation email, which was solved by a quick phone call. The food is divine. Everything. Polenta board, grilled octopus, shrimp spaghettini, balsamic glazed salmon, craft beers. I have yet to find a dish which makes me go \"meh, I've had better,\" or left me desiring more. \u00a0The price, for the quality, unbeatable.Our most recent server, Jonathan, was terrific. He knew the menu and made fantastic recommendations. Cucina Urbana is a must visit and a staple for all of our future San Diego visits.

I'd like to send compliments to everyone in every department from valet to management, \u00a0from hosts all the way to the Chefs. Thank you for always delivering world class service and food!! After having a conversation with Bobby (a bartender) it was clear see that the strength of this restaurant lies with it's culture.

Definitely a busy spot that fills up quickly so make reservations. Plenty of metered parking and valet for $7. Also, it's a great place for kids! The wine and cheeseboard were my favorite part of the night. Highly recommend this place if you are seeking a nice, adult outing but have to bring the kids with you. And don't forget to get the gelato sampler!"], ["Ann M.", "This place is ridiculously fabulous. The service is excellent. I always order sparkling water and my glass never goes beyond half empty (or full, however you perceive it) - Same is true for alcoholic beverages. It's the little things. I've never been neglected here or had to call over my server. Everyone is attentive, friendly and eager to please. Re the food, what can I say that hasn't already been said, so I'll talk about my favorites. What I don't understand is how squash blossoms can taste so damn good. The octopus is tender. The smoked trout and whipped goat milk ricotta vasis are excellent. I wasn't over the moon about the pizza but the pastas are fabulous! I hear the risottos are amazing but unfortunately, they're seasonal. Yet another reason to return. Re dessert, just order the ricotta zeppole!"], ["Joseph D.", "We got take out from this place when we first moved to San Diego and then couldn't understand why everyone kept raving about it. We finally went back to eat and then ahhh... we figured it out- this is not a place where food translates well as take out. We started with the squash blossom which was interesting albeit small. If you got this dish as a take out it'd be a few sad little pieces in a box. The octopus was amazing with a perfect slow cook and char and lots of acid. The paparedelle with short rib was hearty and cooked al dente. The ricotta and lamb sausage pizza was our least favorite and kind of dry. Our favorite of the night was surprisingly the tiramisu which was not at all traditional. It had an amazing crunch with coco nibs, blackberries, and espresso. We were lucky enough to have Connor the bartender (aka the Descriptor) tell us about all the food which made it all the more enjoyable.We had stuffed ourselves with food on a Friday night and were happy we gave it a second shot."], ["Dawn T.", "I am absolutely enamored by everything Cucina Urbana, from the farm to table concept to the beautiful rustic country decor. Our server (I hate that I can't remember her name!) was an absolute doll. She was so incredibly sweet and friendly, not to mention extremely knowledgeable about the menu. She made the best recommendations!Drinks: SO GOOD! The cocktails are amazingly delicious yet STRONG. Our server made great recommendations and I loved everything I tried. \u00a0Between husband and I, we had the Prim & Pleasant, Il Zenzero, Hooded Monk, and the Mule. \u00a0If you're looking for something strong and just barely sweet, I highly recommend the Prim & Pleasant.Food:- Chicken Liver Pate Vasi: I love pate and Cucina Urbana's did not disappoint. It was ridiculously rich, smooth, and flavorful. You get an incredibly generous portion of both pate (served in a mason jar) and bread. I could not stop myself from munching on this throughout the meal!- Stuffed Fried Squash Blossoms: There's only three to a plate but they're definitely worth ordering. Despite being fried, the blossoms are light and crispy and the lemon aioli helps to cut the richness of the ricotta. - Short Rib Pappardelle: I was already full from drinks and apps by the time my main dish came out but I managed to devour most of it anyway. The pappardelle was cooked perfectly and the meat was juicy, flavorful, and so tender. No wonder this dish comes so highly recommended!- Chocolate Budino: This is a dish for all of you chocolate lovers out there! It's rich and creamy but is nicely balanced by the creme fraiche on top.I'm always a little apprehensive about restaurants that sound just a little bit too good to be true (2000+ reviews and an almost perfect 4.5 star rating? get out of here), but honestly, I can't recommend Cucina Urbana enough. \u00a0Food, drinks, and service were all fantastic. \u00a0On top of that, this place is extremely affordable, especially for the quality of food you're getting.

A perfect date night with my partner. TIP: for popular weekend evening times, reserve 1-2 weeks or more in advance on OpenTable. Totally worth the wait. Odd times are easier to snag, but definitely secure a reservation in any case.We shared a beet salad, fried stuffed squash blossoms, cheese polenta with roast meats, truffle fries, a blueberry custard dessert, a signature cocktail, and lavender lemonade. We wanted to try more things but couldn't eat another bite. Everything was on point - to die for! Value: All of that for about $77 before gratuity.

Love the athmosphere, the bartenders are all sexy and of course the service is on par with the Urban Group of restaraunts in San Diego. Love the rotating specials, wood fired pizzas and the \"pick yourself\" wine selection on the wine wall.. Great pricing with a nominal corking fee. Try the jars for a little taste of what's to come and of course the bread and olive tampanade to die for. Portion sizes are sub-par for the pricing but what to expect in the trendy places like this..Note to self! Call in for reservations or Opentable.com as Cucina tends to fill up quickly.

Once we arrived someone had taken that table but there was another one similar in size but had half the seats sitting behind the bar. Sort of an interesting setup but we went for it!Once we sat our server Matt came over and was extremely friendly to our group that was very indecisive about everything from drinks, food to when our whole party was arriving. Matt had a very friendly attitude to every question and comment we had! It was happy hour and I ordered a glass of the house red which was excellent and he took back one of their craft cocktails that looked like a berry mojito and replaced it with the house white. The menu was fairly simple. I had the spare rib/pasta combo (pappardelle) which had the spare rib that was cooked for 12 hours. The pasta was a bit firm but nothing to complain about. Some others in our party had the truffle fries which were good. The pizza with the truffle oil looked good but didnt seem like anything too special. Another got the burrata cheese dish that looked good. the person that got it didnt know how to eat it but our server had a great attitude when showing. At the end, Matt offered to split the checks with couples and singles which was super nice. Overall: Matt was super accommodating, patience, nice, knowledgeable. Food was good but nothing to rave about. The ambient light in the dining area looked great. Will be back if I'm around!"], ["Kevin T.", "Cucina Urbana was a wonderful experience through and through. Even though the tables were booked until 10 p.m. the night I went and I had to wait roughly 20 min. to get a spot a the bar, I would say it was definitely worth it. Went with friends and we ordered the Bolognese, the roasted chicken, pizza, and the parmesan fries. All the dishes were excellently flavored and you could definitely taste the quality of the food. Even the ketchup that came with the fries! You could taste the tomato and the freshness.For the Bolognese, which I ordered, the meat didn't over power the rest of the flavors in the dish. The herb ricotta they had on the sides of the plate help to cut through the dense meat flavors and provide a different dimension. The noodles were perfect al dente. Overall a very high quality dish that I would love to eat again."], ["Alicia P.", "I finally got the opportunity to try this restaurant. Everyone that I know that has has nothing but good things to say. And now I know why. It's a very appealing atmosphere with a warm and inviting feel. I found our server, Eliza, to have an elegant and mild manner. Because it was our first visit, she explained about the wine selection and corkage fees and offered to answer any questions about the menu. We ordered the ordered the hummus to start, which was smooth and creamy. It was topped with smoked tomato jam, that complimented the hummus perfectly. Then came our entrees, shrimp puttanesca and \u00a0whole sea bass, which we shared. The staff kept watch and cleared used dishes as soon as they were empty. They were very attentive.

We were on the road for 3 hours & just wanted something nice to eat. Upon entering, we felt embarrassingly under-dressed. However, we were still greeted with a friendly welcome. I know some places would treat you like a lower class citizen if you didn't have the proper attire, so I felt a lot better.Something so simple like how we are greeted can mean the difference between a good experience versus a great experience in a restaurant.It was actually the most romantic dinner I ever experienced! Candle lit dinner under dim lighting with soft music. I also noticed a piano on one side of the restaurant, and a harp near the entrance. It would've been amazing to get to experience that, but we went in too late!David, the owner, offered us complimentary glasses of Prosecco. This kind gesture made our night because we were celebrating our anniversary. I would've enjoyed it more, but i felt so tense because of how under-dressed we were.

As for our entree, we got the Halibut special as well as Spegatti with meat sauce... I have to say the fish was moist and cooked perfectly. As for my pasta, it was a bit on the salty side and I would have liked it if it had some marinara sauce on the side or something. We could not end our meal w/o trying one of their delicious desserts. So we got the berry tart for to go. The tart was very delicious and it wasn't too sweet. The berries were fresh and just perfect. So why did I deduct a star? Well our server was a bit fake...

A member of our group was celebrating his birthday and wanted Italian and I discovered this place on Yelp. \u00a0I was able to make reservations, the day of, through OpenTable. \u00a0It was located only a few blocks from our hotel, so it was convenient for walking. \u00a0The best part? \u00a0Its on the edge of the Gaslamp, so you can escape all the riff raff. \u00a0Fantastic.We arrived on time and were immediately greeted by the owner, David. \u00a0The restaurant was dimly lit, quiet and intimate w/white linens; it was like entering another world, while exiting the raucous Gaslamp. \u00a0The majority of people there were on dates and I could see why. \u00a0Our group started out a little rowdy; however, the ambiance of the place changed everyone. \u00a0As if the decor weren't enough, there was a harpist, located right at the entrance. \u00a0Ummm, awesome. David was very friendly and asked how we heard about the restaurant. \u00a0When I told him through Yelp, he said, well then, everyone gets a glass of Prosecco. \u00a0Nice! \u00a0Of course, that wasn't enough for the men in our group who also ordered Martinis. \u00a0To start, I had the Antipasto All'Italiana. \u00a0I love wooden boards of snacks, but this board was huge (definitely for sharing for the table). \u00a0It had Melon & Prosciutto, Caprese, Salami, Caponata, Olives & Cheese. \u00a0A great starter.With our entrees, the table opted for a bottle of Chianti, which was very good.For my entree, I had the Papa Sisto. \u00a0Fettuccine pasta in creamy white sauce w/homemade sausage. \u00a0I liked the sausage, but thought there was a bit much of it. \u00a0On the other hand, the Fontina, Parmigiano & Mozzarella cheeses on top were wonderful. \u00a0Overall, I loved my dish.We were there a very long time and service was good throughout dinner. \u00a0Nearing the end of the evening, the men at our table switched to drinking Espressos & Whiskey? \u00a0I took a sip. \u00a0Not my drink. \u00a0As if that weren't all enough, the restaurant provided the birthday celebrant a piece of Tiramasu & Key Lime for the Table to share. \u00a0I'm a Tiramasu fan and hadn't ordered in a while because the last couple of times its been too much coffee taste. \u00a0THIS, on the other hand, was DELICIOUS. \u00a0Husband agreed. \u00a0We were trying to hide how many bites we were taking, knowing the birthday celebrant was watching us. \u00a0haha! \u00a0Also, the harpist agreed to play Happy Birthday. \u00a0Perfect.A wonderful evening for friendship & celebration."], ["Tamara K.", "Wonderful Italian, food is great, atmosphere is cosy, warm.

He even had the harpist play the birthday song for me as he brought out this tasty treat of Amaretto Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Highly recommend that dessert.

Excellent Food Excellent wine list, \u00a0BUT first we ordered a champagne but wasn't in correct \u00a0temperature?? Then the owner recommends us a wine from Italy ( $450) we order the wine AND WAS really OLD, literally we just tasted it, we didn't drink it, the owner knows that was OLD and bad ..and he charged it.

I certainly wasn't disappointed. The dining experience was absolutely delightful all around.The restaurant is located in the quieter corner of the Gaslamp Quarter. (There are several parking lots nearby) Ambiance was definitely memorable - baroque d\u00e9cor, chandeliers, live harp music, white piano on the dining floor. Service is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and polite. I had many questions on the wine list and was very impressed by the waiter's knowledge of each of the wines. My Ossobuco was absolutely delicious, with rich sauce and meat melting in the mouth. I also ordered cr\u00e8me brulee, which I believe was one of the best I've had thus far (and it's a desert I order very frequently). This is definitely a white tablecloth, formal dining type of place, \u00a0so make reservations, dress accordingly and prepare to pay premium prices for the experience. That said, the prices are reasonable for what you are getting in terms of service, atmosphere, and most importantly, quality of food, etc. I'm in love with Salvatore's and will definitely dine there again."], ["Jackie W.", "This place was some of the best Italian I've ever had in Italy or anywhere else!

Since discovering this place back in February I have continued to come back over and over to celebrate all my special events. My first experience was on Valentine's Day and even though the place was packed we still received excellent service and the food was amazing. Their spicy crab linguini is my favorite dish and by far the best pasta dish I have ever ordered at a restaurant. The food alone would be enough to keep me coming back, but the service and atmosphere are what really drive Salvatore's over the top for me. Each time we come in the owner greets us personally and introduces us to our waiter. He goes above and beyond for special occasions and even provided Prosecco for the entire table when I came in to celebrate my graduation.When I came this weekend for my boyfriend's birthday I was worried we would not get a reservation since I know they can get busy on weekend. I was able to make a reservation online and got a personal call from the owner 15 minutes later confirming the reservation and letting me know that he saw the note about the birthday we were celebrating. He knew who we were when we came in and sat us down at a beautiful table in the main dining room. At the end of another amazing meal we were too full for dessert but our waiter insisted that we choose something for our celebration on the house. When he brought out cheesecake the harpist played \"happy birthday\" and it made for a very special experience. With exceptional service I have received each and every time I come here combined with the delicious food and beautiful decor I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars!"], ["Jeremy D.", "The atmosphere here was incredible. Everything was crisp and clean and the staff was very attentive. They had live music with a lady playing the harp. I had the lasagna and it was very well prepared and a good sized portion.

That's how UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE this place is. I don't even know where to start, but before I do let me just say that I was sooooo looking forward to finally trying this place out. I've tried some insanely good Italian food, and I was hoping that by the looks of the reviews for this place, it would be amazing. Unfortunately it was laughably terrible. I had rsvp for this place on Valentine's Day and to begin with I tried calling them the entirety of that day and their phone rang busy the whole day, which then I resorted to calling my American Express to have them confirm our rsvp. Once we got there I was shocked to see how DEAD this place was. Literally empty, which scared me right off the bat. The host up front was at first very friendly and nice so we of course went with it, until I asked him why their phone rang busy all day and he responds \"we had to disconnect our line because of the insane amount of calls we were getting\"Really? Like WHY would you do that? Don't you want to make business? That on its own is the silliest \u00a0thing I've ever heard- and considering how empty the place was, i don't know what calls he was talking about. As we were seated, we waited 20 minutes until we were given menus, which should be done AS SOON as you're seated... Then showed up our server/waiter, and never in my life did I think I would come across a server that rude, incompetent and confused. The guy truly looked like he was high. He had no sense of respect or professionalism- he literally said \"So water.. Soda.. What do you guys want??\" Even cheap fast food chains are better- the workers know to say the basic; \"What can I get you to drink?\" After browsing the menu we asked if he had any recommendations and he says \"it's all good, it's up to you guys\"... How professional. After we put in our orders... He leaves the menus on our table until we had to ASK can you please take these with you? He responds \"Oh yeah\". Going on to our meals... We asked for a Ceprese salad which was extremely mediocre, not to mention how there was a tablespoon of buratta cheese and 10 slices of tomatoes, not properly proportioned at all. Then we asked for soda, it took our waiter 30 minutes plus 2 reminders to get them to us. ITS SODA, why on earth would it take that long to get?Our entrees came out, and after 3 bites- we were done. Boxed pasta and Prego sauce tastes better. I was seriously appalled at this point. Then I thought maybe because I've had amazing Italian food paired with impeccable service is why I'm not impressed, but this just wasn't acceptable. Expecting our server to come by at some point and ask how we are doing or how our meals were for us to voice how we felt, he did not come by for another 30 minutes. And once he did- he says \"So are we all done here or what...\" At this point we had given up and just wanted the bill so we can run far away from this place. Thinking that maybe the dessert might be good, or HOPING that the dessert might be good we asked to see the dessert menu and our server responds with \"We don't really have much tonight, it's a pre-fixed menu so whatever is on there\"... WHAT A JOKE. So I simply asked for some hot water and 10 minutes later he comes and leaves a cup of hot water with a huge tomato sauce stain on the plate and tip of the cup. DISGUSTING. Not only is that disgusting but it's also impossible to not notice. How can you SCREW UP getting a cup of HOT WATER. I took a picture which I will attach because i didn't think that it would be believable given the reviews this place has. I literally and seriously can't understand WHY this place is still running... We should have walked out when we saw how dead it was when we walked in. Terrible terrible service, food and atmosphere. Never coming back."], ["Gino G.", "Great food, fabulous service.

When we arrived, we were greeted and sat immediately with a free glass of champagne. The ambiance was very romantic, quiet and candle lit. Our waiter was very attentive but at the same time, not always in our face, allowing my date and I to enjoy each other's company as well as our food. I ordered the lasagna and it was amazing.

We also split a Caesar salad which was delightful as well. The food came out steaming hot and was presented beautifully on the plates. After we finished the complimentary champaign we both ordered iced teas and our glasses never emptied. Our waiter would bring a new one out right when the glass was about half empty.

I'm simple when it comes to pizza and don't need all the bells and whistles. I appreciate good dough, a good sauce, and good cheese.

Both dishes were well seasoned and well prepared, but the serving size was a bit on the small side and I was still a little hungry after finishing my dish. :( We couldn't resist trying out the tiramisu and we were very happy we did. It was AMAZING! Love, love, love! I almost ordered another piece. Overall I really enjoyed my experience.

Also true: the best Italio-eateries sometimes appear to be a mass of catastrophic confusion. Don't be deterred. You might discover... Mama Mia...thats-a-good!The dishes at Buona Forchetta, or \"The Good Fork\", are simple. The menu doesn't offer up anything you haven't already seen (except maybe the \"Pizza in a Jar\"). But the ingredients are incredibly fresh and crazy-good. The delightful salads, handmade pastas, and Neapolitan pizzas would compete with the best in Italy. They hand-stretch the pizza dough and top it with bright San Marzano tomato sauce and buttery mozzarella. It is then crisped up in the wood-fired oven (hand-built in Naples) at temps above 900\u00b0. Your order will be prepared in a-few-to-several minutes. But, you may not see it for a while. Staff will be running around in choreographed chaos before bringing it to you.

The have a bunch of daily specials: Pasta, Gnocchi, Ravioli, etc. The wine selection was a good mix of Italian and Californian averaging around $30 a bottle. We opted for beer. I had the Boulevard Tank 7 Saison on draft ($5). Matt and Taryn had 16oz cans of Modern Times Amber ($7 each). The polpettine ($7) was three deliciously moist beef and pork meatballs covered with marinara and parmesan cheese. The Bresaola ($10) was an arugula salad with aged beef, marinated artichoke, parmesan. There was a bit too much green for me but the combination of saltiness of the meat and cheese against the spiciness of the arugula was delightful. For pizza, we decided on the Puttanesca ($13) and the Amanda ($14). Basically all of the other pies cost $14. The classically cooked pizza made in their imported Stefano Ferrara oven made a perfect Neapolitan pizza. The super hot oven (700-1000 degrees) crisps the crusts with a bit of char but leaves the sauce and cheese hot and bubbly. The puttanesca was a bit intense with the brine since the pie combines Anchovies, Capers, and Olives. The distribution of the toppings were a bit overloaded on one side which is only bad thing I could say about this place. The \"fried\" Amanda pizza was equally delicious. The crust was buttery and ultra crispy. For toppings it had scamorza, ricotta, and prosciutto di parma. There is always something on an Italian menu that I don't recognize and its either a meat or cheese. Scamorza is a fresh curd cow milk cheese similar to mozzarella with its elasticity and saltiness. I like this cheese better because it melts better and has a stronger flavor profile. (Did you know that Ricotta is not really cheese because it's made from cheese byproducts?). The ricotta gave a fresh taste and contrasting texture. The post oven Parma was of the highest standard. The best part of this place was the value. The $65 price tag was super cheap for all of the delicious food."], ["Melvin M.", "There's just something about this place that makes me comfortable. Maybe it's that it's in the middle of a neighborhood, maybe because its a small and cozy place, maybe because the people there, from the hostess to the waitresses, all have Italian accents? Who knows, all that I know is that I came here for my first time the other day and ordered a Margherita pizza, Meatballs, pizza in a jar, calamari, and dessert. I must say though, if I was rating this place strictly on the food, it would get a 3-star rating for sure. It is not as good of a place as I have heard about and didn't really get a real \"kick\" out of the meal. The only reason it gets four stars is due to the fact that I was very comfortable in the restaurant and really enjoyed the fact that this was the only source of noise within a block's radius. It felt like I was walking to someone's house for a meal, and I really enjoyed that.

We did manage to call a bit before we arrived, though, so the wait time only ended up being around 30 minutes.We got seated at one of the outdoor tables, which was great especially because it was a nice evening/night. While reading through the menu, one thing that really surprised me was the sheer number of pizza choices they had. The Yelp reviews before me do mention this, but I actually didn't read through them until afterward so I wasn't really expecting it. I'm not saying this in a bad way, but pizza isn't quite my thing. Thankfully, this place had a number of other choices too, and I ultimately went for the pumpkin ravioli.The food came out very quickly - I'd say within 10 minutes of ordering. When I first saw the plate I was a bit disheartened because of how small the portion size looked. However, by the time I got half way through I definitely took back my initial doubts - it was SUPER filling. I probably would have stopped eating at that point, but it was so tasty I kept going and ended up finishing all of it. The pumpkin filling was spectacular and the ravioli envelope tasted freshly homemade - although I personally would've preferred a slightly softer skin.Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out! The food is great and the service is both fast and friendly.

It definitely was. :) Once we were seated, we were promptly served water and we ordered the calamari, the Rebecca pizza, and for dessert, the tiramisu. The calamari was delicious. It wasn't heavily breaded, which made me feel a little less guilty eating it. The Rebecca pizza was also wonderful! The prosciutto tasted great on top and the mushrooms were cooked well! The crust of the pizza was AMAZING. It was soft, doughy, but still had a crunch. I usually don't eat the crust, but this time, I'm so glad I tried it. After we devoured the appetizer and the entree, we couldn't help but see that there was tiramisu in the dessert part of the menu. We decided to order the tiramisu and we were so content.

We ended up ordering the Toscana salad and sauce less Isabella pizza. The Toscana salad was right up my alley - spinach, goat cheese, juicy, flavorfully seasoned roasted chicken, pine nuts and balsamic. A great simple salad but the chicken took it over the top. The pizza was good but not my favorite. I'm still unsure if the raw onions amidst of the buffalo mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes were on purpose, but they kind of steered my taste buds in the wrong direction. Additionally, I'm a burrata fanatic but for some reason the cheese didn't seem to be the creamy rich concoction I'm used to. It was almost ... Rubbery. But the crust!!!!

We got the last free table outside, so let that be a warning to you--come early! I believe they also take reservations but I am not totally sure. Worth a try! We ordered the special pasta: linguini with clams in a creamy sauce, with a GIANT shrimp on top. We also ordered the Rebecca pizza and the Sergio pizza, which have ruined me forever. The pasta was super good and I am usually totally underwhelmed by pasta, which makes me think I have been doing it wrong my whole life because this stuff was so good. The sauce was flavorful and light but buttery, and I don't like clams so I let bf devour them and he was thrilled, and the shrimp was perfect and sweet and huge and I loved it. Excellent pasta.

The chicken was cold but went well with the salad. My boyfriend ordered the lobster pasta special which came with a lobster tail and a generous amount of pasta. I ordered the Nicola, which had mozzarella, sauce, mushrooms, prosciutto and topped with truffle oil. I was extremely happy with my pizza and the truffle oil added such a nice touch to it. The servings are hefty and we had leftovers from each dish.The ambiance is so pretty, with options of indoor and outdoor seating and such a cute view of the neighborhood. Can't wait to come back here and try other options!"], ["Juan C.", "Amazing food and prices everything is fresh and authentic. My go to for great pasta and Italian Pizza. Good for an affordable date night that is an elegant venue."], ["Cat A.", "Love the atmosphere, above all. Buona Forchetta is a charming and lovely spot tucked away in a little residential corner in South Park. Whimsical and can be intimately fun for any size party.Be warned, there's no reservations taken except for parties of 6 or larger. There is almost a guarantee of at least a \u00a020 minute (if you're lucky) or more (up to an hour plus)wait time during peak hour. My first time here was when it recently opened. The appeal of this spot was starting to show by the crowd clustered up in front those other times we would pass by. That day happened to be during a weekend afternoon and fortunately, it wasn't too bad. Also, they're a dog friendly patio and this pushed us to go ahead and do a little walking trek from GH to lunch over here. What can I say, I'm a dining out with my pup fanatic. ;) I was on one of those clean eating restrictions (yeah, smart, right? Italian is the way to go..not!) But who doesn't serve salad, tho? I was desperately tested with all the beautiful dishes and aroma that surrounded me. I stayed strong and ordered a smoked salmon salad. Happily, nothing needed to be taken out or modified. With the added capers, this was absolutely delicious and delightful. Fish was very fresh and delicate. I admit, I wanted to at least take a mini bite of the lasagna that was right across from me just so I can say I tried it. Again, I stayed strong and stuck with my salad. I was told it was okay, though I kinda think it was just so I didn't feel so bad in missing out that in-house made pasta and sauce concoction. Anyway, since then, I've been back and have had the calamari, the infamous sardine salad, the osso buco, cheesecake and tiramisu. All very good, in a traditional sense. The osso buco, particularly stood out in memory and was a magnificent sight. But it did fall short of one extra sprinkle of something. \u00a0Nonetheless, still wonderful.I still am in need for a return visit when I can excuse myself from not doing a gluten free but a full on regular pasta dish or at the very least, pizza. Which both, from what I've heard, is authentic Italian yumminess to your tumminess."], ["Veronica E.", "MY NEW FAVORITE.AMBIANCE: Cute little spot in South Park! You'll notice the space by the cute stringed lights and marble tables scattered over the patio - very fitting for a little Italian restaurant. Some of the patio has a tree romantically draped over it and on the other side is covered by a black awning. I didnt get to check the inside of the building but it looked like a small dining room so naturally i would think they'd rely on their patio, which brings me to a funny story...SERVICE: ... the Thursday night my friend and i went, there were distant rain clouds brewing, but I'm sure the restaurant wasnt expecting for it to actually rain - we do live in Sunny San Diego right?? - so they were still seating folks in the patio... but when the rain DID come the restaurant didn't freak out and quickly accommodated the guests - awesome! That's probably why i dont have very many photos as the rain was super distracting and entertaining. Everyone had a very hard Italian accent when speaking English, so i thought it was for the sake of the restaurant, but we heard them all speaking Italian to each other haha crazy, but love it! I'm assuming its family owned :)FOOD/DRINK: SO GOOD. we started with a glass of wine and sangria then dove into our huge salad - very basic but the homemade dressing was tasty. We shared the INDIA PIZZA which had ricotta, prosciutto, and red sauce baked in an oven named after a woman (im totally blanking out on what the name was, uhg). It was medium sized and perfect to share, about 2 big slices each, although the dough in the middle of the pie got kinda soggy :( a bit of a bummer but regardless it was super tasty with the fresh ingredients. The final plate we shared was the deeeelish TIRAMISU. i'm a dessert freak so this was a pleasant treat! next time i visit i'm definitely getting it again AND some pasta - the folks around us did and i was super jealous. PRICES: very, very reasonable! for 2 drinks, a large salad, pizza, and dessert (all food shared) was $20 each! totally worth it as i was very full and loved the ambiance.PARKING: street parking wasnt too bad since its not a busy neighborhood."], ["Omar S.", "Buona Forchetta was the restaurant my Beloved and I favored for unwinding and reconnecting at the end of a long week. We'd nuzzle and chat, occasionally visiting with the owner and with \"our\" waiter, and we'd share delicious food and a little wine while relaxing on the patio. At other times, we'd host friends (singles and couples), cautiously sharing our retreat, hoping to keep it hidden.Early on, we'd worked out that by calling ahead to get on the list, we could minimize our wait time, so the worst we might expect on arrival was tight parking, which isn't really a problem if one is willing to circle the block a few times, or walk a bit before and after dinner.Buona Forchetta's layout was comfortable and conducive to our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates. While there were only a few tables inside and seating for perhaps 50 people on the patio, the arrangement was such that a couple or a foursome could rely on that comfortable bubble of space around one's table that enables the fantasy of privacy, even in a crowded room. The service was at once attentive and intrusive; our waiter might bring us extra food or arrange a special request without a hitch, and then plop down at our table to talk about his immigration issues. We didn't mind innocent impositions; they made us feel like family.And the food was delectable: lovely, moist and flavorful Neapolitan-style pizzas, hand-crafted pasta dishes, specials including wild boar, or saffron, or strange and wonderful cheeses sourced in Italy by the owner and presented to San Diegans as much for our edification as for our dining delight. For the first time in our marriage, my Beloved and I had a \"special occasion\" restaurant that wasn't a steakhouse. \u00a0Buona Forchetta promised unique and surprisingly gratifying dishes, and consistently kept its promise.But things changed, and Buona Forchetta is no longer a desirable place for couples like us. We watched frustrated as the place declined, and spoke with those who could help the situation, but no one did, and now, the restaurant's hit-or-miss kitchen tosses food to the crowd with little regard for taste or quality of presentation. And \"our\" waiter is gone, replaced by loud, unhappy men who badger each other and the clientele, or chuckle and comment conspiratorially as though no one in San Diego but them speaks Spanish or Italian.Eventually, these things happened:Buona Forchetta became a banquet hall that grudgingly admits walk-ins. Not long ago, on a Saturday night, instead of accommodating the couple of dozen people waiting in line, the restaurant simultaneously seated groups of 9, 12 and 18 people. They also seated two deuces (us, and another couple), but of course, the presence of three large groups destroyed the ambiance that once made Buona Forchetta a charming, intimate restaurant.I thought: \"I can endure crowded seating.\" But the service became disjointed and imprecise.Over several visits, we noticed that the waiters had increasing difficulty figuring out what dish went where without help from we diners, and that the kitchen sometimes ran out of foods without telling the waiters, who took orders, then, half an hour later, came back to take new ones. \"No problem, I said, \"I can overlook bad service.\" But then the kitchen quit trying. Since last summer, the restaurant has served decent pizza, except when it has unapologetically offered burnt pizza with skimpy toppings, instead. And more disappointing, its special dishes were no longer reliably special. One recent Saturday, I took myself to lunch at Buona Forchetta, being among the first customers to arrive. I was served dry bread, tough lamb with a washed-out tomato sauce, and what was billed as Porcini Risotto, but appeared instead to be plain risotto with mushrooms added, the rice being more like pilaf, and what I'd swear was Gorgonzola cream sauce stirred in. An awful combination of textures and flavors, slopped onto a platter.I spoke with my waiter and one of the cooks about these problems, and was told I was wrong. But I wasn't guessing. I'd eaten the risotto there several times, and the lamb once, and knew they could do better, because they'd done so in the past.I believe that Buona Forchetta has finished with \"Stage One: Make a Charming Neighborhood Trattoria,\" and has moved on to \"Stage Two: Quickly Make as Much Money as Possible.\" I'm unwilling to help them with Stage Two, so my Beloved and I will leave them to it, and will find a new favorite restaurant."], ["Susan V.", "Very authentic Italian restaurant with delicious food! \u00a0We visited for lunch and shared the \"special of the day\" pizza which had an amazing crust and lots of prosciutto .... yummy! \u00a0We also had the Sottoterra salad with goat cheese & caramelized onions and for dessert a flaky puff pastry which was delicious!It was a little noisy eating out on the patio, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and all the dishes being served looked so good. \u00a0Will definitely return to this little gem of a restaurant! \u00a0 P.S. \u00a0Check out the restrooms while there :)"], ["Jacopo B.", "#1 Italian Restaurant in San Diego.San Diego has a reputation for beautiful beaches, perfect year-round weather, and horrible Italian food. \u00a0I've tried dozens of Italian spots and more often than not... I leave disappointed. \u00a0One evening, not to long ago, I begrudgingly accompanied some friends to dinner at \"a new Italian place in South Park\" expecting another crucifixion of the greatest cuisine known to man.Buona Forchetta totally surprised me. This is the hottest, tastiest, most authentic Italian restaurant in town.My mother was in town from Firenze and I was excited to get her opinion on my new spot. \u00a0We started off with a Chianti Classico Riserva which accompanied the entire meal perfectly. \u00a0The wine list is packed with fantastic choices and they are priced MUCH better than most places. Go ahead, get two bottles next time you are in ;) I intended on eating and drinking enough to satiate a medium sized African village, so we decided to start with a light appetizer: bresaola over an arugula salad. \u00a0This was topped with thin slices of cheese (maybe Pecorino?) and drizzled with olive oil. \u00a0It was light, and crisp; a delicious way to start.On special this evening was Gnocchi con Speck. \u00a0The Gnocchi are made in house - they are heavenly. \u00a0I grew up eating homemade gnocchi from my mother and we both approved. \u00a0Served over a light cream sauce and covered in perfect little slices of mouth-watering speck and walnuts. \u00a0This one will make you drool just looking at it - then you find out it tastes even better than it looks.Since Buona Forchetta has a wood burning oven, we decided on a Quattro Stagione Pizza (four seasons). \u00a0The crust was amazing, the sauce was perfect.... my eyes started tearing up as I drizzled olive oil on top and devoured every last bite. \u00a0Enjoy my photos; writing can't do justice to this meal.Overall: \u00a0If you don't get it by now...this place is the best. \u00a0Service is great - real Italians, being typical Italians (funny, intense, passionate, real, and they know what they are doing in the kitchen.) \u00a0The food is top. \u00a0Buona Forchetta's reputation is no longer a secret. \u00a0If you don't want to walk around the lovely neighborhood while you are waiting for a table - make a reservation or show up early. \u00a0Buon Appetito!"], ["Greg P.", "Dress up or go casual. Artichoke hearts were the best I've had. Filet was perfect. The pappardelle carbona was really good. Tiramisu was delicious. Service was on point.

Our waiter and busboy were nowhere to be found. \u00a0I'm assuming someone threw away my wife's food and was too ashamed to tell us. \u00a0We traveled out of our way to eat at this restaurant due to its great reviews, but it didn't feel like we were a priority for them and that's unfortunate."], ["Claudia G.", "We have been meaning to write a review for quite some time now. We first went to eat there a little under three years ago. It was our first date, the food was wonderful, the service beyond great, and great ambiance. I love the fact that it's in our neighborhood and we don't have to drive far. We go there for special occasions or bring friends who have never been there. On March 7th this year John spoke to the owner and was able to arrange an engagement. Him and his entire staff were all in on it. They went above and beyond to make our day special. Nowadays it's hard finding that level of service. From Claudia and John, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Keep up the great work!"], ["TianChee S.", "I had nothing but very positive feedback for this place. Heck I insisted very hard on my visiting friends to come check this place out but during my recent visit here I was totally shocked with the service. I'll admit their food is still good but their service was just very bad. I usually recognize most of the staff as I was a regular here but this new waiter was giving me a hard time. First of all 3 tables that were seated after we were seated were immediately served with some bread and oil/vinegar. Our table, I waited and waited and nope nothing. I eventually asked our waiter for some bread and he oddly said, \"oh we usually only give bread on request\" I was like umm okay? Did I not just ask for bread? Eventually I was given the bread but just the bread. I had to again call down our waiter to provide the oil and vinegar. And again he somehow decided to bring up this nonsense of how usually bread is not given unless requested? This started to irritate me further. I am asking for bread.... so just give me the darn bread and stop trying to lecture me something that doesn't make any sense. I was more irritated at how it seemed like our waiter didn't want to give us bread yet I glance around the whole restaurant and everyone had bread and oil/vinegar at their tables. That just completely got me infuriated. The waiter eventually told the manager and somehow the manager came to our table which I initially thought was him hoping to apologize but again he repeated what the waiter said which is that usually we don't give bread unless on request. I'm like in my head, are you serious? Just let it go, never mind the fact that I simply just asked for bread already. I just didn't get what they were trying to say. The manager was saying like ohh we are not like other Italian places that serve bread without the customer asking...I just gave up with their excuses. I came here over 5 times and was always served bread without any issues until today so I was tired to having to call them out on their poor service and refusal to serve bread to us. Yes I'm not Italian but I have eaten at your place over 5 times and I have been to Italy so I am not clueless in how things work. If you don't want to give our table bread and oil/vinegar but give everyone else at your restaurant those items then so be it. Once my favorite place for Italian food but this has left a very very very bad taste in my mouth which I cannot tolerate. I can and will eat elsewhere. If that waiter is not working there anymore then maybe I'll reconsider but when you make a whole deal of how bread serving works at your restaurant \u00a0and try to lecture me on this even though I have been to your place numerous times and refuse to apologize that's just ridiculous. Stay away from the bald guy waiter."], ["Maria A.", "Tried Buona Forchetta for the first time on Friday night. \u00a0I usually don't start a review that's overall positive, but the first thing we heard when we arrived was that the wait was 2 hours long!!! They don't take reservations unless your party is 6 or more, and I would highly recommend having a party of this size to avoid the crazy wait. \u00a0Thankfully there is a bar across the street so we posted up there for some drinks before dinner and they called us when our table was ready. \u00a0And it was almost the full two hours.The ambiance is really nice, it's what I imagine Italy to be like (although I haven't been there). \u00a0The specials are all written on a chalkboard and they give you a menu for the pizzas. \u00a0We had a friendly italian server.I ordered the risotto dish which was a porcini mushroom risotto with lamb and it was really good. \u00a0The lamb was cooked properly and didn't have much fat on it. \u00a0The mushroom risotto was delish also.Aside from the wait it was a great dinner and experience overall, but I honestly don't think I would wait 2 hours to eat anywhere! \u00a0Thankfully I was with a group of friends and we were due to catch up and not in a rush, so it wasn't a big deal. \u00a0If the circumstances were different I may not have been willing to wait so long.

Thank you!"], ["Stephen D.", "When you ride your bicycle around the corner, only to come across an unknown restaurant, with a line around the corner on a Tuesday evening, you make it a point to do a little research. The capacity of my research involved copious amounts of good food & drink. The line lived up to the reason worth waiting- A Really Great Experience.No one wants to read a long review about the delicate seasonings and perfectly prepared cuisine that we all experienced this evening. Was it Good? Should I Go? Price? The menu concept is straight forward- a list of Apps, Pizza & drinks. Everything else is run off of a Special Board, allowing the restaurant to use what is in season as well as whatever inspires them that day. This is genius because it forbids the customer from demanding some dish that they loved back in the Spring of 2012, only to find that it is no longer on the menu. Essentially there is No Menu and you come there knowing that. This in itself is a reason to get excited and a reason to keep returning. Not for something you have had already, in fear of being disappointed, but Rather knowing that their quality is so HIGH, fear not for the food will be great. Even more so because it allows the kitchen to have FUN again, while not being treated as a robot/primate turning out the same slop over and over again. Bloody Liberating, making your food all the more interesting and delicious.Drinks are priced well. No dish is priced over $15 and let me assure you that for the size & ingredient quality of the pizzas, you will be impressed. Pasta- Special; Gnocchi- Special; Secondi- Special!Environment is that of what it should be: Fun, Social, Comfortable, not pretentious in any way, & not in a hurry to move you along.

Both the regular dough and the gluten free dough are amazing, the sauce is on point and flavorful and the pizzas are topped with just the right amount of delicious cheese. If you're in South Park and in need of some good food or specially pizza and want a nice atmosphere, this is the place to come. There's usually a bit of a wait for a table but it's for good reason. Locals know how great this place is and if you want amazing pizza, it's most definitely worth the wait."], ["Reinke E.", "HOW does this place have 4.5 stars?! I literally do not even know how that is possible!!!!Okay where to begin. This lovely restaurant happens to be right around the corner from my house so I frequent it at least a few times a week. I would easily eat here every single meal if I had the funds to do so. I know pretty much every single worker here and every time I come I am greeted with enthusiasm! They are all extremely friendly and they are authentic Italians, who doesn't love that accent? After studying abroad in Rome, I have been longing for the unequivocal food experience I had while there. I can definitely say that this restaurant is the closest I have come to reliving that. The caprese salad is made with the freshest possible ingredients that can be found in SoCal. Their wood oven pizzas hit the spot every time and have never once let me down with their melt-in-your mouth savoriness. I can honestly say this is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in the US and I will be dining here until my credit card gets declined."], ["Teresa N.", "Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.Came here on a Saturday night, long wait, yes, very very long wait. What do you do? Write down your name and number, walk over to Hamilton's for a couple drinks, they will give you a call when your table is ready.Make sure you check out their special menu, very special menu written on the wall by the door. My friend and I ordered a bottle of house red, lobster pasta, and pesto ravioli which were specials of the day. I don't know it it was just me or what, their put the wine in their own container that seemed bigger than the regular 750ml bottle. But it was okay, it's never too much wine for us. The food came, ravioli was mediocre but the lobster pasta was really good. Really flavorful pasta sauce. What about the lobster? It came as a whole thing with the shell! And it was huge too. My friend and I were both super lazy to take off the shell so we pretty much just ate the big craws and the body, it was yummy though. Dessert... we got the cannoli! Delicious! Next time I will try to go with a group and make reservation (they take it for party of 6 or more)"], ["Michelle K.", "My favorite restaurant in San Diego (trust me... I've been to a LOT of restaurants). Love love love the ambiance here. I always insist on sitting outside. The service has always been superb. Lovely hostess who is always friendly and the servers are fun, energetic, and super helpful. I had a reservation for tonight, and we were seated right away. The food is consistently good. I love their pizza! Their pizzas remind me of Pizzeria Delfina in San Francisco. Yum. I always get the Margherita pizza and whatever daily special they have. Today, they had a zucchini flower, pancetta, buffala, yellow tomatoes pizza -- omg this was lovely. Their gnocchi with boar ragu was solid, though I thought the gnocchi could've been a bit softer and lighter. The clam linguini in white wine sauce was good. Lasagna was great. The calamari appetizer was forgettable, but not bad. I always enjoy a good caprese, and theirs was pretty tasty -- would've been better with more basil! I always make sure I fit this place in whenever I visit San Diego. Go there for dinner after dark to get the full experience. Bring a date you want to impress -- it will work."], ["Sunny S.", "We got food poisoning after eating the lamb risotto here last weekend 9/5/15. The wait time here is crazy too. Our wait time was estimated to be 2 hours but we got our table after 2.5 hrs. I liked the ambience of the place and the food but after having the runs for 2 days straight I don't think I will eat here again.We also noticed that there favoritism towards Italians. They take reservations for parties of 6 or more but we talked to an Italian family of 4 that had reservations and were seated right after we were. \u00a0Peace!"], ["Ashley J.", "What an amazing gem!

The mozerella shredded on top is real good quality that they shred of a block of cheese. Just get some on your food. The sausage was some of the best I've had. And the crust was perfect. It Was perfect.The calamari was light, and done very well. Def order that. The wine list is great and reasonably priced. We did the Sonoma curter chardonnay. Excellent wine.a great spot for a date or to bring a group of friends and eat well with good wine . Oh the service was pretty good too. I think everyone is Italian and it adds to the charm. Loved this spot ..will recommend and come back often!"], ["Justin J.", "On the shortlist with Monello and Bencotto of truly fine Italian eateries in America's Finest City.The Pasta, Rissoto, and Gnocchi specials of the day are all fantastic but the standout really is the pizza pie. Napoletana style with a gorgeous chew on the crust and a mildly sweet sauce. The mozzarella is a class above anything I've had in California. The laid back Brooklyn vibe of South Park adds to the experience, and partnered with the lovely carbs make Buona Forchetta a must try."], ["Lisa M.", "The food is great, that isn't the issue. It's the service. I am a local and have been a fare few times for dine in and take out. I always feel rushed when I am eating and feel like I'm bothering the server if I need something. The take out is a bit of a joke too. I have ordered several times. They say 20 minutes, but when you arrive to pick up, there is usually a further wait of about 10 minutes. I now know to get there about 30 minutes after calling the order in so I can grab and go. However, 3 times now I have arrived to pick up and not only is my food not ready, but I've waited an additional 40 minutes for them to bring it out. They take your payment upon arrival so I couldn't even cancel the order. Service definitely needs to be addressed."], ["Flynn M.", "This place is da bomb!!!! Best pizza on the face of the earth.

I can't believe I'm waiting for over 2 hours for 6 people to be seated. We were told we would be seated in an hr or so... we didn't mind waiting until an hour came... This place seemed great for groups but they need to implement some kind of rule for parties greater than 8 and the time they are allowed. I know that's an asshole thing to say, but there are ways to work around table and working with reservation and big groups. My group did not have reservation and I really wish we did, but treating others differently and acting smart doesn't make me feel great about this experience. Not only did we wait longer then the expected time, we didn't even get seated because we gave up. I complained to the host and she said its gonna be another hour. UGHHH! The frustration! After, my long night. I called the restaurant right away and told the owner what had happened. He apologized and It was very nice of him to put me at ease. We agreed that when I do come back to try them finally, that to speak to him and he will make sure I am being taken cared of. I really appreciate that and that's why I didn't have the heart to give this place a one star. I hope to one day give this places a 5 but we will have to see..."], ["Anthony Z.", "Best Italian in San Diego! Hands down! Ever since I found this place through yelp, I fell in LOVE.

(Bring a sweater) The pizza. 10 stars if there was a option. Wow, the crust is crunch yet chewy at the same time! The cheese is exceptional along with the tangy/sweet sauce. Oh man! My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it! Have to come back soon! Skip little Italy and come here instead."], ["Eve W.", "Average food. Average service.

They do not take reservations for parties under 6, luckily we came with a large group and had a reservation, but I saw many people waiting outside. We ordered a carafe of red house wine which was ok. Can't beat the price so I was happy to drink it. Did have to request proper wine glasses as they first brought out water cups for the wine, which I just could not do. Also they did not bring out enough silverware for everyone...had to ask and they forgot, but I just took someone's knife who wasn't using it.Started with the smoked salmon pizza with brie. LOVED it! Two of my favorite things on pizza...it was a dream come true! Soooo good!!!Sardine salad which is actually white anchovies on arugola was great! The anchovies were the vinegary type that I had all over Spain and just love. They went perfect with the arugula and artichoke. For my main I had the portobella ravioli. I expected a lot of this dish as I love mushrooms and I feel like it is hard to go wrong with pasta (especially at a place so highly ranked as this one) but I felt like the dish was lacking some flavor. Not as creamy as I would have preferred with a mushroom ravioli. I had to add salt to it for some added flavor. Also, I tried the salmon pasta that my fiance got and it too was a bit bland.So my conclusion after one meal here is go for the pizza and salad. Get a bottle of wine and enjoy a nice evening outside on their patio. I definitely recommend this place although I've had better pasta."], ["Tony C.", "5 stars Buona Forchetta WAS a hidden jewel that is always busy now but I highly recommend for everyone to try.

But seriously this place is quaint and inviting. The staff all speak with an Italian accent. Are they purposely laying on the thick accent? Maybe....but I like it! It makes you feel like you've been transported to a small village in Italy. Oh the food!! The food is awesome. I have been multiple times and my last trip was just as great as the others. Ordered the Nicola which is a prosciutto pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella and truffle oil. Also had a special shrimp ricotta ravioli plate.

The presentations of the dishes looked ordinary but the flavors and textures were amazing. Couldn't read the menu that was in Italian but conveyed what I wanted.

We could tell he was annoyed so we stood up, walked to the otherside of the room and read \"the board\"...whatever.The calamari app was way underseasoned and meh...wouldn't order that again. We both ordered pizzas, I got the smoked salmon(added capers) and husband got one with sausage and procuitto. Pizzas came out and mine was not cut- so I sent it back for a quick cut...ok now the taste. The salmon was not smoked very long, so it was very mild in flavor. I love the saltiness of a well smoked salmon- but this was lacking...very lacking. Despite adding capers, I actually ended up salting my pizza :/ My husbands pizza was missing procuitto. We brought it to the attention of our annoyed waiter, and he just stared at us...\"do you want it?\" - \"um, yes please. The description of the pizza says it has it\". We showed the waiter the description on the menu and he snatched up the pizza and left.The pizza returns with ham, NOT procuitto. Ok we may not be \"Italians\" but my husband is a chef and we eat out enough to damn well know the difference between ham and procuitto...whatever. I guess we are just \"stupid Americans\".

There was no fruit to be found nor was there any sign of carbonated water. Perhaps this is how authentic sangria is supposed to taste like? It wasn't terrible, just not what we expected. Aside from the sangria, we also ordered calamari (cooked to perfection!), Lobster pasta (best thing on their menu!), and Nicola pizza (truffle ANYTHING is delicious!).

Seafood risotto (scallops / shrimp) was so yummy! That sauce was to die for.2. Angela pizza melted in our mouths, it was spicy so there was a kick!3. Lasagna was the least favorite of the night but thats only because we've had it so many times everywhere. Thats not to say it was bad, it was good.We paired it all up with the house white wine and had panna cotta for desert. To our surprise our server gave us an extra one for being first time guests. All the staff was so attentive, even considering the fact that it was a full house with so many people. We will definitely be back! The atmosphere is what I loved the most about this place. I love that it's directly in a neighborhood. There were locals walking from their houses to have dinner here. The restaurant had pretty outdoor lighting and heat lamps.

It was a Tuesday evening when we went so the place wasn't too busy. Brought our own bottle of red wine to compliment the pasta dishes :) The three of us decided to go about dinner family-style.

I have a moral dilemma giving this place 4 stars: the food was definitely 5 stars, but the service was so slow. It felt like we spent half of our time just trying to get our server's attention. This was probably because there was one person singlehandedly running the entire front of the house - so the lack of service isn't her fault at all. But it nonetheless plays a role in my review. For the food:1. Ricotta cheese gnocchi. This was absolutely stunning. The gnocchi just melt in your mouth and you get this beautifully smooth taste. Highly recommended.2. Spaghetti alla Vongole. Healthy amount of shellfish. The dish is very well seasoned and the herbs are absolutely spot on. I personally am not a big fan of vongole in general, but the person who consumed the majority of this dish seemed to thoroughly enjoy it.3. Taglioni alla pescatora. Again, good serving amount of seafood. This was pretty standard in terms of presentation / composition but it served as a nice intermediate between the rich gnocchi and the light vongole.4. Grigliata mista. Large amount of grilled squid, fish, and shrimp. The charring is spot-on and the acidity from the lemon cuts through it very nicely.5. Pizza alta marea. I was a bit disappointed by the pizza because it just seemed like a normal pizza. It lacked a certain loving quality that all of the other dishes had.

Here is what occurred.*No one came to give us menus or bring us water for about 20 minutes.*Once someone finally did take our order, it took what seemed to be forever for our food to come. We were busy talking so we did not check the time but it was wayyyy! to long a wait.*Two of us ordered lasagna. One plate of lasagna came out. It was cold and \"underwhelming\" in taste. Very weirdly, the 2nd plate of lasagna did not come out for another 10 minutes. Really? Isn't lasagna made in one large pan and shouldn't both lasagna orders come out at the same time. This lasagna was also barely lukewarm. A very disappointing order of lobster ravioli actually came with small pieces of lobster shell still left in it.*When I asked for a coke. The server came out with a cold bottle of coke...no glass and  no ice. I asked very nicely if I could have a glass of ice. She said they didn't have any ice. Honestly? *In all fairness, this restauranteur said that her main cook was absent  that night & apologized for the poor service but it was clear that the lack of quality preparation and lack of organization in the restaurant happens more often than not.*All of us were at a total loss understanding where the rave reviews come from.

It had about 6 slices of pepperoni. It wasn't spicy or had any flavor for that matter.The crust was soggy in the middle. The edges had a little more structure but was a little like styrofoam and had no flavor. It did taste like they used a wood-fires oven.The cheese was gritty and spongy. It had a high moisture content like it was frozen. This made the cheese taste a little funky. Not objectionable but not stringy and delicious like I expect my pizza.The sauce. The sauce was phoned in. I could barely find any but, when I did, it reminded me of the sauce that comes with spaghetti-ohs.

The batter was slightly unorthodox (crunchy/grainy instead of smooth) but delicious, the seafood fresh and cooked to perfection. I sampled some of the bolognese/rag\u00fa: it looked a little weak on the tomato, but was also just right. The penne that came with it were al dente.Overall, an amazing experience.

I am a fan of expertly prepared MMMeat in between two buns and this one is no exception: medium rare patty, bacon jam, roasted garlic mayo and cheese curd made it devastatingly bad for my arteries.

The servings are small but it is ample to curb your sweet tooth. Get the chocolate tarte or the brown butter blondie.Let's not forget the cocktails! Negroni, Moscow Mule and even a Mai Tai were all worth the prices. I like it when I can get my favorite drinks at an Italian restaurant that is obviously more wine centric.

However, the truffle eggs toast wasn't that good as we expected. We also ordered the Uovo in Raviolo 'San Domenico', a giant ravioli but it was quite small.

Can I give 10 stars?"], ["Allison I.", "I made my way here after a morning stroll through Little Italy Farmers Market on July 4th.I was a little put off by the service here. When we walked in, we had no expectations of where to sit (patio vs. inside), but the host immediately assumed we wanted a patio seat and assertively told us that there was no patio seating available. We told her that we didn't care where we sat, and I could tell she identified how she came off to us because she started explaining why she greeted us with that right off the bat. When we got to our seats, myself and my fellow diner were already feeling totally weirded out, like we didn't belong here. Didn't make a big deal about it, but a part of me wanted to just leave.Our waiter came by to take our drink orders and he was very friendly and authentically Italian. Two minutes later, another server came by to take our drink orders. We gave him our orders and then politely told him that someone else came by to take the same order. He was genuinely apologetic, but with the already off-putting experience at the door, I wondered what was really going on behind the scenes.I went with the truffle toast with fontina, 2 eggs and shaved asparagus, and my friend went with the Davanti burger. For brunch, both these items were reasonably priced at $10 and $15, respectively. I was pretty pleased to see these numbers.My truffle toast came in 10 minutes before the Davanti burger did. Out of politeness, I chose not to eat until my friend's burger came in. I didn't want to finish my food by the time my friend's came out. My waiter came by and saw that I was waiting, and he told me that they bring food out as soon as it's ready and he pretty much TOLD me to start eating. Um, no. I will wait, thank you very much.The truffle toast was very rich. I didn't think the truffle would be mixed with the cheese, and so every bite, including the egg yolk, was almost too much to bear. The Davanti burger was huge and delicious -- very Italian and cooked perfectly. The fries were very meaty and dense, which was the perfect complement to the dish.I don't see myself coming back for brunch, but I would like to try this place for dinner. I could tell they use bold flavors in their food and would like to see what turns up on their dinner menu.

At least put two ravioli... But to serve just ONE Ravioli for $13. Unacceptable. I/ we were disappointed because it soured us on the meal so we left and got more food elsewhere.

One point a friend made was the strong use of lemon and vinegar in their dishes which might be the style for this Italian restaurant. \u00a0P.S. no red sauce in any of our orders...lol!Overall, the pricing was admired by my guests coming from San Francisco because they feel prices in the bay area in restaurants are ridiculously high. \u00a0Service was good with minor hiccups that didn't alter the enjoyment of the restaurant. \u00a0As they say in Italy, my family (friends) are happy, I am happy!Arrivederci!"], ["Lisa W.", "I was not impressed... After hearing many good things about Davanti, it turned out to be just okay. Nothing better than any other place or a home cooking of Italian food. We started off with the \"must have\" $21 focaccia de recco... A thinly baked bread with cow cheese stuffed inside and served with local honeycomb. Came with about 8 slices. Was it worth the tag price? Maybe trying it once is good, because it was a good piece of bread and cheese, the honeycomb is what made it. More like a dessert. I don't think it was worth the price tag but it was a good one time try. It was the only good thing we tried from here, I'll give Davanti that. We also had the beef carpaccio. You can skip this. Theirs was very bland and have anything on it. Usually it comes with capers or lemon but this was short of flavors or garnish. For my entree I got the sausage pasta, it was okay. Nothing Great that i haven't tried elsewhere. We also got the lamb pappardelle, and that was the most flavorless thing I ever tasted. The lamb was so dry, pasta was dry and there was no sauce to it. It seemed like it was simply tossed in olive oil. It had some peas and mint but it was pretty bland. I would not suggest this for anyone if you are looking for a burst of good flavors. Don't get me wrong, Davanti is a great restaurant and service was superb. Our waiter was awesome and attentive, but he can't change mediocre food and especially the price tag with that. I rather walk down the street and eat at Bencotto or KEX. We would have been more satisfied."], ["Bil B.", "Davanti is an EXCELLENT choice for amazing food at a very reasonable price.

I've thought \"damn, I should have gotten the burger.\" \u00a0This is not to say the other menu items are bad, they're pretty tasty, but the burger is crave-worthy. \u00a0Bacon jam, cheese curds, arugula, roasted tomato and a garlic mayo? \u00a0Yes please!There are a TON of restaurants in Little Italy, many of which are new and trendy and come with a 1 hour wait list- this spot does not suffer that problem. \u00a0I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes for a table here and service is quick and competent. \u00a0The servers know the menu well enough to tell you which dishes are stellar, and which ones are just \"OK\". \u00a0Also note-worthy, they have a build your own bloody mary bar for weekend brunch. \u00a0I've never tried it out, but man I do love DIY food/drink stations.After writing this review, I really want some focaccia di recco and a burger. \u00a0Yum."], ["Jesse K.", "I think this was easily a top 3 fav restaurant all time for me and not only is Italian my fav, but I grew up inNJ/NYC and spent some time staying in Northern Italy as well.

How are we supposed to share a caprese salad between 8 people if there's only 3 tomato slices?? Most dishes are only few ounces but cost $15 to $20!! And the way the food comes out randomly is fine unless some orders the full meal entree. I ordered the burger and it came out way after all the other dishes. I would suggest going all small dishes in your group so there is no awkward waiting for someone for a ribeye steak while everyone else eats. -1 star for the price! One of our friends ordered the salmon dish and thry completely forgot to put the order in. Big mistake. I understand it was an accident and he did offer us some free deserts but it was a major buzzkill. The server also messed up the bill and overcharged us for dinner. Strike 2 buddy. Yeah they were honest mistakes and overall the service was pretty good, \u00a0but still -1 star for the service."], ["Jerline H.", "My extremely indecisive friend and I were to eat in Little Italy, and just to harass my partner in crime I suggested we eat at every restaurant we passed by. The friend finally agreed to the menu that featured the most truffles and mushrooms in Little Italy. The store is dark with bricks and dim lightining, featuring many pigs for decoration. Our server was an awesome lad named Danny who was very knowledgeable about the dishes, what was popular, actually had opinions on what we may enjoy, was fun to banter with, and he just made our night that much better. I highly recommend trying to sit in his section! Our Foccacia di Recco ($21) was all we were hoping for (honeycomb with delectable soft bread oozing with cow cheese) and more (oil dribbling down my face). Though if I had noticed the price tag, I might have hesitated because like I feared the dish left me still hungry - but to Hollywood with it - I'd order it again! Order an extra honey comb ($2) at the beginning so you don't have to skimp when you're running low!It was my brilliant ordering that we ended up with Pizza con Funghi e Taleggio ($13), a pizza pie topped with mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio and infused with truffle oil. It was delicious with the right amount of toppings to crust ratio; condiments include pepper, chili flakes, oregano (?) and salt. Waking up with truffle oil breath has got to be the best morning breath ever.The beef carpaccio+arugula+ mushroom+ toma piemontese + truffle oil ($10). It was good for the first serving, then my tastebuds shriveled up at the saltiness. The pairing was very good - just a bit too much salt for me. The Escarole ($8) with hazelnuts, celery, apple and pecorino dolce was more of salad type - would order again! The shredded Brussels sprouts ($8) with cheese was salty on its own, but taken home and mixed with my tub of spinach leaves, they were perfect! We had Rum In Wonderland ($11) consisting of white rum, orange juice, pineapple, orgeat, and grenadine and Italian Cadillac Margarita ($12) consisting of tequila, amaretto, triple sec, orange juice, sweet and sour, lemon and lime. I suggest that if you normally don't like tequila, you will probably still not enjoy tequila, even in this new and upgraded form. My rum was relatively sweet, though not as sweet as I like my drinks, and so much better than tequila. The water here is awesome, though my friend pointed out it might be so awesome because the food is for the salty palate. The make your own Bloody Marys ($10) is very fun - though at the risk of concocting something horrid. Luckily there is a nice, knowledgeable lady who stands by with gloves and helps make your drink tasty with bits of everything from the mixing table. Don't forget to add in the bacon, available from the bar! The tomato juice is awesome and my awesome drink ended up tasting like V8 or clamato, which is just great. If you screw up royally, the lady can help you fix your drink or do a reset. Uvo benedict ($13) is like an egg benny without the biscuit and good, but compared to the truffle egg toast ($8) there is no competition. I very highly recommend the truffle egg toast, a truffle-infused brick of toast with a poached egg on top every time you come, 'cause sadly it cannot be taken as a to-go order. The eggplant + tomato + mozzarella + pesto ($8) dish was very bland for me; I think my tastebuds had died by this point. One time I called in an order on a Saturday evening at 730pm and waited 50 minutes to receive my order. The kitchen was extremely backed up, management was extremely apologetic, people were being turned away at the door , and they waived the price on my order. As expected from a place I've come to associate with fantastic customer service. Restrooms are for either gender, clean and stocked. Parking is on the street. Outdoor seating with heat lamps available. Anyway, one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego! See you soon, Davanti!"], ["Taylor W.", "Came here for my GF's birthday dinner. We made a reservation a day in advance and right off the bat received attitude from the staff assisting us. Upon arrival we were barely greated and just given incredibly vague directions where our table was like we are supposed to already know. Regardless we found our table unassisted being the adventurers that we are. After a mild wait we started our dinner endeavor. We had to ask multiple occasions for drinks, menus, and our heater to be turned on. After half an hour we got up and turned on our own heater after asking 5 times. Anyway all in all the food is great, the decor and atmosphere were great. Staff made us feel unwelcome and that they were essentially too good for us which was a bummer because we are not really a needy group and all have served in the industry. Luckily we got tuff skin and had a kickass time regardless.

Their pickles are pickled themselves and amazing. Our friends for their burger which was voted 3rd best in The SD. I tried a bite and it surely was delicious. A little salty imo but I'm not a big salt water so that could be why. Mo wife got the eggs Benedict and loved them. They have a decent beer selection too. They have like 4 or 5 beers on tap. I think they were all local micro brews. They even offer you samples before jumping into a full pint. Really cool stuff, like getting an ice cream sample before buying a full scoop lolThe best part about this place is the combination of how great all the food is and how well priced it all is. It was less than most eateries we stopped by while looking for a place to grab brunch in little Italy while being better than most places we ate at down there. We kicked it at the bar and Kristian (spelling?) was absolutely amazing. He chatted us up and even filled us with tons of places that were must sees in the area. He also made some amazing drinks and was a really funny dude. He definitely made the stop worth our while. Why is it so hard to find good, friendly service now a days like they have here?

Once the rest of my group arrived we were escorted to a nice table (booth style) on the back patio. \u00a0From there we ate, ate and ate some more. Our server (Melissa?) was friendly and very accommodating. Apparently, we were having so much fun that the Assistant Manager Anna came by to check us and join in the laughter.

Then had Marscapone polenta & Ragu. Meat was sooo tender. Finaled with as much of a Davanti burger that could fit in our stomachs but planning on eating after a nite of drinking."], ["Mark N.", "You must try the Bloody Mary bar brunch. OMG I have never had that much items put in a glass. From prosciutto wrapped asparagus, carrots, celery, a skewer of meats and peppers, and more. Wow that was a meal in itself. Another must try is the focaccia di Ricco and Honeycomb which has 4 yummy melted cheeses one of them slightly salty and then the warm toasted thin focaccia and honeycomb. This is a must for sure."], ["Benson S.", "My wife and I went there as a suggestion from someone in the hotel we are staying. I was not expecting such good food and service. The waiter was top notch any question you asked him about the menu he had a good answer that was correct. They have a very fine selection of cheeses and I love goat cheese. I wish I was not leaving Tuesday morning for home because I would go there again. Even my wife who complains about every restaurant we eat at loved this place, So if you're hard to please go here and you will be very happy you did."], ["Laila Y.", "This is one of the few places in San Diego that I can say deserves 5 stars in everything: food, drinks, service, location and price. Every single staff member from the hosts, bartenders, servers, and bussers are extremely friendly and helpful and provide you the best experience ever! They have the best happy hour and brunch specials in the area and everything is amazing and great quality and quantity for the price. The Bloody Mary bar on Saturdays and Sunday's is only $10 and it's one of the most detailed and vast Bloody Mary bars in San Diego! The servers go out of their way to hook it up and provide you the best experience. Ashlyn, who was filling in for the Bloody Mary bar did an absolutely amazing job! So personable and had a great attitude! The manager Dustin also goes out of his way to make sure you have an exceptional time.

Seriously, get in your car, go to Davanti and eat it immediately. It is by far one of the best things I've eaten in my entire life. Give whoever created this an award. I haven't had a bad dish here once -- from their pizzas to their pasta. Their plates are meant to be shared, but I've ordered individually several times as well. Food is served as it's ready. Staff is always friendly and attentive."], ["Adam O.", "I dined here on Friday night. It was spectacular. Here is the breakdown:Service - Perfect, thank you Dustin for the perfect balance of information and humor/warmth. Attentive without being to obtrusive.Food - The focaccia with fresh honey and cheese seems expensive at $21, but man is it ever worth every penny. I get this every time and never regret it. Beef Carpaccio was thin and melt-in-your mouth tender, as it should be. Lightly seasoned with Parmesan slices and Arugula and just prefect. Finally, the star was the pork shoulder ragu on Polenta. Not a speck was left and we ordered the larger size ($18, only $4 more than the small and per Dustin was twice the size of the small). So, so good. Maybe the finest (taste and fine-ness) Polenta I have ever had. Ended with the coffee tiramisu and two espressos, again, just spot-on. There was literally nothing more I could have asked for. I can't recommend Davanti Enoteca enough. Call for reservations on Fr-Sat nights."], ["Mike S.", "Stopped in late on a weeknight, and the place wasn't too crowded. Grabbed a seat at the bar and settled in to check out the menu. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic selection of charcuterie. That's great in my book! \u00a0Figured I'd order the 4 for $20, which is your selection of 4 cured meats and/or cheeses for $20. They have a nice menu, well rounded and full of options. I checked the wine list, but was feeling more like a beer. No beer menu, and the tap handles might not necessarily match the beer. No bottles either, just the 4 drafts on tap. Finally put in my order for 3 meats 1 cheese chefs choice, a beer, and the sausage and rigatoni. Got my beer, a strawberry blonde from Acoustic Ale house that was pretty good. Then came my charcuterie. Oh my! \u00a0Large helping of 3 cured meats, cheese, sliced baguette, honey, Gardiner. Well worth the $20, and a great value for what you get!Then not 3 minutes into my app my entree arrives. I comment to the server how it looks like it came out too soon. \"Yeah, guess the kitchen is fast tonight\". \u00a0I worked on finishing my appetizer, and by the time I got to the rigatoni it was cold and congealed into a solid mass.I can see the effort that went into this place creating the menu and the freshness of the ingredients, etc. But when the entree leaves the kitchen not 3 minutes after the app, the poor planning and delivery of the food is what ruins the meal. You pay $50 of your hard earned money to have a nice dinner, the least they could do is bring you food you can eat hot.In summary, appetizer was outstanding and a great value. Entree was awful because it was cold by the time I got to it. Tip for those willing to try this place: if you're going for more than one course, order each course individually from the server so they don't all bring it at once!"], ["Staci R.", "My experience at Davanti was bittersweet but I'd still recommend it to others. I had a friend in town and after a day at the Safari Park we had the hungs. I heard good things about Davanti so we went on over. It was a Sun evening and there was no wait at all to be seated in our choice of seats. After a long day of sightseeing and running around the safari park I started with a glass of Syrah. It was great and well priced. I was craving some cheese and was delighted to see that they offer many different varieties solo or as a plate. I went with the Grana Padano which is like a Parmesan and it was perfect. \u00a0Next we had some grilled calamari which was cooked and seasoned well. For entrees I ordered the Polpo con Rafano(seared octopus, warm fingerling potato salad, marcona almonds, finocchiona, fresh horseradish aioli) and my friend ordered the Pizza D.O.C (tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil). I didn't realize that finocchiona is sausage because I'm Pescatarian. When I got my plate I ate one bite then looked down and realized there was meat! I don't think I ate any of the meat but the sight of it made me upset. I think I cried a bit lol. I called the waiter over to ask if there was meat in the dish and he instantly became apologetic. He realized that I had told him earlier I was pescatarian so he blamed himself. I told him it's my fault for not understanding italian but he felt really bad. He offered to take the dish back and bring me one without meat but I preferred to order something different (and safer) so I Burrata and Tomato Salad. It was very good. Our waiter continued to be apologetic and courteous and even offered us a free dessert. We declined but he insisted so we went with the Crostata al Cioccolato (chocolate tart with ganache filling and chocolate meringue dark chocolate + meringue + chocolate ganache). It was rich and delicious. Despite me almost eating meat the service was fantastic and the food was very good, so I'd recommend Davanti!"], ["Susie K.", "Little Italy in itself is such a beautiful, scenic gem filled with amazing places where you can sip espresso, grab a quick slice of pizza, relax with a glass of wine, etc. However, if you want something that will wow your taste buds and make the trip and parking worth it the focaccia di recco+honeycomb is a hands down winner. It was the most incredibly fresh, three cheese filled, milky, crunchy, slightly sweet perfection. I thought NY was the only place that could get the crust just right, but oh was I wrong.I hate to say it, but I'm not quite sure what the hype is all about on their bloody mary's. I absolutely love a fresh, tangy, and spicy bloody mary with the works, but Davanti's mix just didn't have the va va voom. Even with the spruced up build your own bloody mary bar, it sadly just lacked the foundational flavors to build on it.The overall experience wasn't a 5 star restaurant due to service being a bit uncoordinated, but it's definitely a fun laid back spot with a beautiful patio.Seriously though get the FOCACCIA DI RECCO+honeycomb.xoxo"], ["Adam J.", "Their Italian Beef Sandwich is very bland and not original what-so-ever...It's their own invented version and is horrible. They don't even put real giardiniera in it either...It's like these dry mixed veggies that taste steamed...Yuuuck!....That is what completely makes and breaks a real Chicago style.Secondly, the servers are nice and polite but they rarely come back to offer you a refill on your drink when you are occupying a table for a 45 minute luncheon. I have eaten at this place 3 separate times within the last few months and you're lucky if they come by once, but most of the time you have to flag them down to get a refill, even when the place is almost empty with no people during the afternoon.First impression is always the last impression. I just discovered The Princess Pub next door makes authentic Italian Beefs and they are awesome...I definitely won't be going back to Davanti Enoteca anymore."], ["Hima J.", "Awesome Italian food, I can easily categorize it as one of the best Italian food I ever had. Their Focaccia Di Recco is just out of the world ! Whenever I visit SD again, this would be main reason I would come back to this place :) You can make out that the ingredients that they use are pure and they really make an effort to prepare dishes and present them. Ravioli Carbonara is also good. Overall great food, friendly staff and an impressive ambience.

Might sound like order overload but we ended up finishing up nearly everything.The eggs were all cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious. I loved the tomatoes that came with my insanely yummy egg & proscuitto open-faced sandwich, and the grapes on the egg platter were great. The pancakes might have been the star of the show - thin, light and so yummy. The serving size isn't huge, so it did end up being a good side for us to split. I couldn't get enough of those pancakes!I would have liked to see some sort of drink specials during lunch, or a slightly lower price point on their make-your-own Bloody Mary bar...$10 per drink is steep.

I think they could do a little better with where they place their tables to clear pathways to walk. Now to the food. There were two different menus; the specialty menu which consists of specials made for the week or for the season. Since it's October, the menu had a few dishes that incorporated pumpkin in it. And then you have the usual everyday regular menu. We ordered off of the specialty menu and unfortunately I forgot the names of our dishes. (I need to take notes next time. My apologies readers). We had the pumpkin ravioli which was delicious! \u00a0And this jumbo shrimp, scallops with black pasta. That was my favourite dish. My friend and I shared the two dishes. For dessert, there's no menu. Our waiter named all of the dessert options and we went with the tiramisu. It was a big slice. We accompanied our dessert with a cup of coffee each.

Simple enough.

The response from the waiter was completely careless and stated that in Italy, people don't eat their meat with any sauce. \u00a0That may be true. \u00a0We just got back from Italy not too long ago actually. \u00a0The difference? \u00a0Our waiter was just plain rude about it. \u00a0The atmosphere was okay and the eggplant appetizer was good.

It's cozy inside, almost like eating at your grandmother's house with a warm vibe emanating from the restaurant. It feels a little crowded in terms of table arrangement, but hey, it adds to the authenticity of it all. Our server was Italian. He was passionate, funny, and very efficient. Anyone dining there that evening could tell he was the life of the party which made our experience there enjoyable. He threw in a free dessert for my daughter when we told him it was her birthday in a few days, and though his singing was a little off tune, we appreciate him being such a good sport =)Now to the good stuff. Their house bread is served warm and fresh with a sun-dried tomato dipping sauce. I prefer olive oil and balsamic vinegar which they gladly served upon request. Knowing how heavy and carb-induced this cuisine was, we skipped getting any appetizers and went straight to the main course. BLACK LINGUINE ($16.95) served with lots of scallops, shrimps, leeks, and tomatoes in a scrumptious cream sauce was a heavenly bowl which I wanted to devour completely if I had the capacity to. The pasta was cooked al dente, as should be, but it was the hint of squid ink flavor that really won me over. Everything tied in together into one beautiful harmony. Superb!MUSHROOM RISOTTO ($17.95) was a huge plate of perfectly cooked arborio rice. Mushrooms were aplenty and the truffle oil was evident in every spoonful. This blew away everyone on the table and they claim it's their favorite of the night. Mine remains the black linguine but I will attest to the goodness of this one, no doubt.STROZZAPRETI ($16.95) is similar to a cavatelli but elongated. The pasta was nicely done, pleasantly chewy. It had copious amounts of bay scallops, shrimps, and mushrooms but I'm not a big fan of their pink sauce here. Sadly this was our least favorite and I wish we ordered the RISOTTO NERO in squid ink sauce instead.Portions here are generous but I wouldn't recommend sharing one dish between 2 adults, possibly 2 kids.

Right there, I knew that was a good sign. After being seated, we were quickly approached by our server who had a thick Italian accent. The place leaves very little room to walk through. The decor is classic Italy as you would imagine a moms and pops restaurant. With all that and a big table full of Italian diners with their bottles of wine and the sound of laughter echoing, it made the experience seem like we were transported to Venice.Then once we got the food, there was not question this was a real deal. Let me rewind a bit and say whatever red that was suggested was fantastic! I had a big glass of it before any food came out and was already on a good one by the time the main dish arrived. LOL Actually, the glasses of wine may of been the only thing that wasn't Italian. I believe it was from Spain (2nd glass was a Malbec). I don't recall but damn, it was good.For starters, I got the calamari which is my usual. Good and simple. The side of marinara to dip still kept the simplicity of the flavors in the app. For my dish, after debating between my favorites of the lamb and seafood, I went with the latter, and got the cioppino.

Right away, we were warmly greeted by the host as well as our waiter, and soon after we got our menus we were served water and bread as well. The menu is pretty extensive, so it took us a while to decide but I ultimately went with the pollo giardino.As we were waiting for our food to arrive I tried some of the bread and sauce (tomato sauce, not the traditional olive oil/vinegar) which was surprisingly very good given that I'm not usually a huge fan of bread. The food came out soon after, and I was not disappointed. The entire dish was perfection! The chicken breast was cooked beautifully with a wonderful flavor that was enhanced by the warm arugula and tomato topping. I also loved how the dish wasn't drenched in sauce, which is unfortunately the case for many places nowadays. The side of broccoli was tasty as well; however, the carrots seemed a bit undercooked despite the nice flavor (honestly a negligible flaw though relative to the rest of the dish).Overall, I love this place - everything about it. I'll definitely be back, especially when I'm looking for solid Italian food matched with solid service. Highly recommend!"], ["Adan C.", "This place is adorable and the food is delicious!

Delicious, had mussels and clams and shrimp. Black noodle pasta - creamy white sauce, scallops are tender and delicious. It's a rich flavor. Service is very nice but getting the bill after packing up our food for us took 15mins long and bringing our check to us after we payed with our card was another 15 mins.

My favorite dish is the spaghetti bolognese. They make such a simple dish into an experiment for your mouth. I've had a few other dishes along with their meatballs and this establishment has yet to let me down.The ambience is very cute and quaint. It's a hole in the wall that could easily be over looked from the outside but with a romantic and intimate vibe once you're inside. The only problem about eating here is that parking is terrible.

Pretty easy to find just terrible to find parking. It is downtown hillcrest after all.Decor:Kind of a dim feeling. Fairly noisy inside and can get a little stuffy. I would recommend sitting outside as they do have a curtain so it's actually quite toasty and less noisy. Plus you get some fresh air!Food & Drinks:We order a variety of things here. I know they have a \"special\" menu, but that has turned into more of a normal menu. We get usually 1 red and 1 white such as a fettucine primevera and a penne tirreno. Very delicious. It is a bit carb heavy, but most italian places are. I have always been satisfied by everything I have had here and even better than some places in little Italy. Try whatever you think looks good.

From the fake peeling plaster-exposed fake brick walls to the traditional menu and nice selection of accessibly priced Chianitis and other Tuscan wines, Arrivederci just seems to get it all right. The Italian waiters play their role very well. Very welcoming, friendly and accommodating. In fact, far more attentive and responsive service than you will receive in any restaurant in Italy where the plaster is really cracking and the service is very often too relaxed. The grilled polenta and burrata appetizers were both fantastic. There were no complaints about the salmon, lasagna, veal piccata or meat balls--all perfectly prepared. Dessert included a great strawberry Napoleon filled with fresh whipped cream and fresh strawberries and puff pastry and (needlessly) drizzled with chocolate syrup. Nice indoor/outdoor seating in an intimate Hillcrest atmosphere with easy off-street free parking with validation."], ["Anthony Z.", "Pretty good. Went here for lunch on a weekday. The food was tasty. I was seated outside on the patio. They bring some bread and marinara. I asked for extra because it was delicious. I ordered the Veal piccata. It had hints of lemon and a smooth white wine sauce. I felt like it was a tad bit greasy but that was the only thing I could think that was wrong with it. My mom ordered the lasagna which I thought was really good. I would order that again next time. ***Tip: park in the parking lot next to the restaurant.

A very intimate location with a good setup. Staff are great. The food is good and the prices are worth the experience. There's not one thing in particular I feel makes Arrivederci amazing but just that everything they do here is done above-average and that's always a good thing to see from a business. My suggestion is a change in decor. I feel the vibe is right but the design is off-balance. Also, better presentation would also help separate this place from others like it. Overall, Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen but Arrivederci is a solid choice to keep coming back to. I definitely recommend at least trying it out for anyone visiting the area or looking for someplace new to eat Italian food."], ["Spencer B.", "I love Italian food and I love this place. The ambience is great and the staff are impeccable. Plenty of food option and fantastic wine pairings.

Ambiance: small, cozy (re: small) house-shaped restaurant. loud, genuine italian atmosphere. you'll probably be seated very close to the table next to you.Food: they start you off with some house bread accompanied by a sundried tomato dipping oil. this was great. and they keep the bread coming if you ask for it.Carpaccio - they really drowned this with lemon and it came with so much arugula it was practically a salad on top of the beef, which isn't a bad thing. this was alright. Black linguini - had a very creamy flavor with not enough saltiness for my liking, but i can understand why some would like it. definitely unique. Spinach gnocchi: also very creamy. not a whole lot excitement going on. just little lumps of carbs covered in cream. Nero risotto - so this was risotta that was billed as flavored with squid ink, so in my mind i thought they might swirl the squid ink on top. nope. this thing came out looking like fresh asphalt, darker than the darkest of nights. black. after the initial shock subsided, i tasted it and while it was definitely flavorful, it was extremely salty. i couldnt even tell you what the main flavor was, but i'm guessing that it was mostly squid ink? they weren't kidding when they said it was flavored with squid ink. for those that want their food to look pretty/appetizing, i'd avoid this one lol.and finally the service: like any traditional european restaurant, they take their time and theres a long wait between the time you order, the appetizer, and the main dish - all of this is to be expected. but once we asked for the check, we assumed we'd be given it in the next 5-10 minutes. nope. we had to ask for the check 3 or 4 times and it took almost an hour for us to settle our meal. So im not sure if yelp let us down, if we just happened to get unlucky with our choice of entrees, or if just was not meant to be but doesn't seem like i'll be saying arriverderci to Arriverci. just goodbye.

(The outdoor patio was more chaotic since it was raining. ) The decoration is classic. Since I had to drive back to LA after the meal I only ordered a plate of angel hair with shrimp, mushroom and zucchini. They then gave me half a loaf of bread and I really couldn't finish it... but the tomato dipping sauce for bread was brilliant.It took them a while to prepare the pasta. Guess were I not just by myself I wouldn't even have noticed the wait. But it worths the wait. The pasta is mind-blowing good. The angel hair was cooked just right and the sauce too, not too watery nor too dried. The tomato is very flavorful. Some canned tomato you can find in grocery stores tastes like nothing, but their tomato sauce was really thick and smelled awesome. I love the idea of mixing zucchini and shrimp together in red pasta sauce. I like that the zucchini is still crispy. Since every one in the room is talking with their group of friends, this might not be suitable for a date (or at least not the first few ones).

It is served on top of a creamy mushroom risotto all cooked in port wine reduction which adds a sweetness to it that is absolutely addicting. It's a very big, hearty dish, so it is pretty rare that I can eat it all in one sitting. It also takes a little extra time to cook.

So we had told the host that we had a reservations and she had told us to wait and to give her my name.

I was starving at this point (I pretty much demolished the bread with marinara sauce.). So the plate for the fried calamari was huge ad we couldn't finished it. My lobster ravioli was by far the best I've ever had. It was so tasty and the ravioli tasted so fresh. The black linguine was so yummy as well.

The waiter puts them at a tiny table butted right up against another table, and awkwardness ensues. For a \"nice Italian dinner out,\" it's not the ideal seating situation. That's the exact situation that Ristorante Arriverderci wanted to put us in, except that we HAD made a reservation a while earlier, and we did not show up at a busy time (5:30 PM). We weren't about to live a Black-ish rerun, so we declined the table. Thus, we were banished to the \"patio\" by ourselves.Waiter was great. Wine was fine. Food was just okay. I had the pork osso bucco, which came highly recommended, but which really cannot earn a grade of any higher than okay in my book. Other patrons were seated practically right next to us, and we felt that we needed to whisper to have any sort of conversation. I can't remember if there was music, but if there was, it was very quiet. We weren't having a secret conversation or anything, it was just awkward for everyone to be able to hear everything we were saying.For what we got, the $70-something price tag didn't seem justified. On top of that. it felt like we were rushed out \u00a0to make way for the dinner rush."], ["Summer S.", "Intrigued by the carb loading that runners indulged in, I agreed to join my runner friends for a meal prior to the race. \u00a0It must be the best feeling for an Italian restaurant when they see a pack of runners coming in. \u00a0I was in absolute awe of the the quantity as well as the quality of food that just kept rolling out of the kitchen. \u00a0There was no one pecking at a salad, this group was there to eat with gusto. \u00a0So fun! \u00a0I am thrilled that I stuck with my single entree \u00a0as I wasn't running 26 miles anytime soon. \u00a0The service was pleasant, so much hustle, maybe I should look into this running thing."], ["Bogdan R.", "The food was alright, though the fried calamaries were dry and basically mostly breading with a little calamari thrown in.

We also asked for a little more bread and butter to go with our food. We asked 5 times, literally 5 times, I was counting. The server would actually come to our server, look it over, and ask if we needed anything. We would ask for some more water and some bread, and the waiter would say \"sure!\" Then the server would leave, come back 5 min later and ask \"how is everything? Do you need anything else.\" We would ask for the same. \"Sure!\" 5 min later same shit.

My friend got a Spaghetti with a side of their homemade meatballs which I sampled and they were probably some of the best meatballs I've had in a long time. We finished with a Tiramisu which was very light and made just right. Next time i'm back in SD I'm coming back"], ["Nicole W.", "Go eat here!!

Was so so creamy and salty! Gnocchi is supposed to be a potato dumpling, but they're not very giving on the potato part. Could hardly tell there was potato in there. The thick creamy sauce made up for it tho. Very seasoned and the prosciutto and peas helped add texture. I've had gnocchi before where it's just the potato dumpling with a creamy red sauce, but the additions of a meat and a small vegetable helped add to the texture of the dish. Saffron adds a nice hint of flavor as well!Parking: There's a lot RIGHT next to the restaurant and they accept validation for the first 1.5 hours. After that, then you hafta pay. If you're lucky you'll be in and out within the 1.5 hours. Or you could score princess parking RIGHT in front and use quarters for the meter.Ambiance: Small intimate setting. Can get loud.

We ordered the calamari - huge portions and perfect balance of breading and calamari. While the tomato sauce it came with was decent, I would definitely recommend ordering a second side of the marinara sauce that comes with the bread to dip the calamari in. I ordered the squid ink with shrimp, scallops, and interestingly, leeks! The dish was creamy, FULL of fish, and the crunchy addition of the leeks set the dish over the top. I can't wait to go back. My boyfriend had the fra diavlo and was initially worried about not having enough fish (lobster) but it was a huge portion and more than enough. While it could have been spicier for our taste, it was still well prepared and delicious. I know that next time we go he is going to order the squid ink though.

Most recently we got the sausage orchiette and the fettuccine with swordfish. Both of the dishes had minimal sauce/flavoring and were quite bland. They were really heavy on the pasta to anything else ratio. The fettuccine was also quite limp and overcooked. Overall quite disappointing. The service was also fairly subpar, we waited 10 minutes after we were seated to get our menus and got very little attention from our waiter for most of the meal.We've had better meals here and wonder if it's only certain dishes this place does well.

I like this restaurant better than the other location for some reason. First off, the osso bucco is pretty amazing. I've tried other places, leaving with disappointment due to tough meat and bland risotto. \u00a0Arrividerci's osso bucco is fall off the bone tender with flavorful risotto to accompany the meat & rich wine reduction sauce. My favorite item on the menu is the angel hair with shrimp & zucchini but with pink sauce! It is soo good. The squid ink pasta is another one of my faves. Ceasar salad and calamari are must haves also. The restaurant is always busy, & sometimes has an effect on the service. The waiters and hostesses are great, but sometimes it takes a while for them to get to your table because of how busy it is. Parking kinda sucks, because there's no private lot.

Enough said...I am taking my rating down because my FAVORITE dish, the mussels, were WAY less than favorite yesterday. The mussels were tiny, overcooked and underwhelming.

All I enjoyed yesterday was the crostini and the broth :( BUMMER I miss my delicious mussels"], ["Jessica S.", "We drive by this restaurant every day, commuting to and from work. We just haven't had a chance to stop in (despite the fact that two co-workers have raved about it recently) until we found ourselves in need of dinner before heading to a show over at Brick by Brick.It was chance, really, that led us here. We were stuck in traffic on 5 S, and left the freeway early to take side roads. Around that time, my husband mentioned that we should start looking for someplace to eat, and I mentioned Luce. He'd never heard of it, but was game to try.We found street parking right across from the restaurant, which was fortunate, as the lot behind the place was blocked off (and tiny, anyway). They were doing a brisk business by the time we got there, and all the tables were packed. Oh - before I go on, let me just say that this place is teeny-tiny-itty-bitty. Seriously, they have maybe four \"private\" tables along one wall, the bar with stools, and four or so \"communal\" tables. That's it.When we walked in, all the \"private\" tables were taken, and the bar was full up. Our only option was to sidle up to a \"communal\" table that was occupied by one lady and her laptop. It was kind of awkward, mostly because the guy who led us there said to her, \"I'm bringing you company, I hope you don't mind!\" and wandered off before he could catch her glaring at him.Anyway, we perched on some seats across from the suddenly grumpy lady and her laptop, and started to go through the small menu. We were squinting up at the specials board (a chalkboard above the kitchen that was printed in what I would equate to a 6 point font. It was small!) when I noticed that the group at the communal table behind us had left. I made the \"wanna move?\" gesture to my husband, and he quickly agreed. We gathered up our bottle of water and glasses and migrated over to the empty table.I think it threw the server for a loop, but I much preferred being alone with a chance of newcomers joining us than being forced to sit in frosty silence with laptop lady.At any rate, they didn't make a fuss over us moving, and we were able to place our order. We decided to share the Carnitas Tacos, the Lamb Shank Tacos and one order of House Cut Fries. To this, my husband added a beer, while I stuck with water.Business only picked up as we sat there, and as we were now at the table closest to the door, we were able to watch people come in, hover near the door and peer anxiously around the room for an open table. Most people were told that they could either join one of the communal tables along one wall, or wait for a private table along the other, and of course they decided to wait. But, with no real standing room, or waiting area, they were forced to shuffle back and forth, out of the way of servers and patrons.The food, when it was delivered, was absolutely delicious. The fries came out first and the serving was huge. They came with two dipping sauces - the aioli was our favorite. The tacos came out soon after, and we quickly split them up. It was hard for me to pick a favorite - they were both pretty evenly matched - but when it came down to it, I think I preferred the lamb shank tacos, just because of the extras that were on the taco. The cabbage/veggie/slaw mix added a nice crunch, and the sauce helped tame it down. The carnitas tacos were delicious too, don't get me wrong. Those came with avocado, corn, a different sauce and veggies. I just think it was a bit too much for me, at that time. It's hard to explain.Still, they were both very good. And those fries! Crispy and crunchy and way too addictive for potatoes. Plus, the waiter gave us a little container of their hot sauce - divine! It was like that Mexican chili candy that I grew up on. I couldn't stop eating it, but was afraid that if I kept going, bad things would happen at the show. ;)The service was good, though it was hard to flag down the waiter to pay at the end, mostly because there were so many people he couldn't get to us. I'd absolutely go back, even though I know it's likely to be just as busy."], ["Kelli S.", "I liked the concept behind Luce Bar + Kitchen, but I think I would have enjoyed the eatery more if I had gone for brunch. There are SO many items that I would want to try on the brunch menu.The dinner menu, however, felt a bit more limited. I met a few friends for dinner here on a Sunday evening, and the eatery was crowded. I was glad that two of our friends came early enough to get us a table. We parked on one of the side streets and walked around the corner to get to Luce.In of itself, Luce wasn't bad. Maybe I just expected our pasta to be a bit better than it actually was. I probably would have been happier ordering the \"Luce Burger.\"I would be willing to give Luce another chance by going for brunch. However, I did enjoy the cheese board that we ordered, as well as the taste I got of our friends' \"Luce Burger\" and addictive fries.Here's what we got during our visit: \"Cheese Board\": The four of us decided to share the cheese board, which consisted of pickled vegetables, roasted garlic bulbs, toast and apple coulis. I didn't quite know what I was eating, in terms of cheese, but I think I got some of the goat cheese and Brie ... I absolutely LOVE Brie, so I was a happy camper. I didn't really eat any of the pickled veggies, but I did like the mini crostinis and the roasted garlic bulbs. If you're a cheese lover and enjoying a meal at Luce with friends, this is a good shareable option. \"Luce Burger\": If I were going to Luce again for dinner, this is what I would order next time. My two friends chose to split this. It includes arugula, tomato, caramelized onions, garlic aioli and aged white cheddar. It also is accompanied by house cut fries (including parsley, parmesan, truffle oil and garlic aioli). The fries are definitely a winner - they're soft, slightly thicker and not super crunchy/crispy. They tasted especially good paired with the garlic aioli. The burger itself was flavorful and tasty, and the garlic aioli and aged white cheddar made it taste even better. If I were ordering this burger myself, I would get it sans the tomatoes and caramelized onions, but I can see why this is one of the most popular items on the menu. \"Daily Pasta\": Be sure to ask your server what the featured pasta of the day is. The one that was featured during our visit sounded delicious, as it included shrimp, spinach, bacon and garlic sauce. I did love the consistency of the thin noodles, and they actually didn't skimp on that succulent shrimp. However, the pasta seemed a bit bland ... it needed more of that garlic sauce or something. It probably would have been better with a pesto or stronger cream sauce. I was disappointed because we paid $15 for that pasta and it was still lacking in flavor (I took the leftovers home and added shredded cheese to it, which definitely helped). I do tend to like pastas with cream/alfredo sauces instead of tomato, which made this pasta dish initially appealing. Hopefully the chef was just having an off day and if this pasta entr\u00e9e is ever featured again, there will be more flavor to it. \"Luce BLAT\": This sando sounds delicious and I would get it with accompanying fries if I ever visit this eatery for lunch. It includes thick-cut house smoked bacon, garlic aioli, mixed greens, avocado and tomato on focaccia bread. I do love focaccia bread, so that's already a win in my book. I would just probably order this sandwich without the tomatoes, but everything else--especially the bacon and garlic aioli--sound delicious. \"Fried Chicken & Waffles\": This is one of my newfound favorite entrees, and I'm always interested to see how the versions from various restaurants compare. This one features Serrano maple syrup and a savory waffle. I hope the chicken is succulent, juicy and fried to a perfect golden-brown; definitely interested in giving this sweet-savory combo a shot if I ever come here for brunch.\"Pork Belly Hash\": There are so many savory items on the brunch menu that it's almost impossible to choose just one. But, I would really want to try this pork belly hash. It features house smoked bacon, potatoes, rutabaga, green beans, a horseradish cr\u00e8me fraiche, hollandaise sauce and poached eggs. Definitely an interesting combo for sure, but hashes are one of my favorite savory breakfast items, so I anticipate trying this one day."], ["Stacey H.", "Finally got a chance to try after living so close for so long.

The restaurant is your typical trendy decor (expensive bulbs, dark with metal and wood furnishings, and chalkboard galore). Not a big restaurant so this place gets packed especially with more people that are finding out about them and during and after happy hour. Love how they have tons of window openings. Just lets in natural air and light in and probably so it doesn't get stuffy. On to the food... this place has a sort of revolving menu and they have tons of daily specials available on top of what they have on their menu. At this visit, the bf and i had their lamb tacos, pepperoni mushrooms pizza, and their house cut fries. Each were great. Who can pass on fries truffle oil and a garlic aioli? No one and you shouldn't because they aren't your typical $5 super thin fries. These are normal sized fries and they are generous with their truffle oil. The garlic aioli too is just the perfect dipping combo. The lamb tacos (comes with two) were just wow. First the portion is huge. They are moist and flavorful. Only wished they had more of the lime creme fraiche added to it. The daily special we had was the pepperoni pizza. Oven fired pizza yes please. Not too thin of a crust but also not Americanized thick pizza. Needless to say we left with no doggy bag here. Tip: Street parking only.

Both of us decided to try the catch of the day salad and I see no shame in ordering the same thing. If anything it simply confirms that I have superior taste buds and everyone copies me... joke! The spinach was lightly dressed with a balsamic reduction and was topped with feta, olives, grilled marinated veggies, candied walnuts and a huge piece of yellowtail. They bill this bad boy as a \"big salad\" and I'd have to agree. It's hearty, healthy and capable of filling you up as much as any salad possibly can.

The place is a bit dark and it has more of a bar feel to it than family restaurant. I called to see if children could come in and they could but, after arriving I realized it's probably best for just adults because of the food selection and the bar atmosphere. To start I ordered the charcuterie board and added cheese to it as the server suggested. I also had a strawberry mule. The charcuterie board was amazing. It had a very good grainy mustard along with a great selection of meats and cheeses. I was in heaven. The strawberry mule was very good and refreshing. I ordered the ribs and fries from the appetizer menu for my daughter and I had the crispy chicken. My daughter enjoyed the ribs and the sauce they had seemed to be homemade not bottled which was good. The fries were very good they had Parmesan cheese. The ribs came with a sort of savory muffin that was pretty dry but, it balanced the flavors since the ribs were sweet.My crispy chicken was cooked very well it wasn't dry at all but, it was under seasoned which made the dish just ok. It had some risotto cakes that were also a little bland. Had the dish been well seasoned it would have been great. I'm giving it a 3 just because of that charcuterie board to be honest I love a good charcuterie board. Our server was very nice but, someone forgot to either place the order of a pizza or to make it. The server didn't notice until we mentioned it to her and she quickly placed the order again. The selection on the menu is small but they have a few very good things on there. Definitely not a place for kids they don't even have a children's menu so definitely leave the kids at home for this one. Even though I wasn't completely satisfied with my dish the other things out group ordered were good and if definitely give them another chance."], ["Q Steve T.", "This delightful little gastro-pub serves up some pretty good mules and entrees that are large enough to be shared.

It is a very cool spot with an awesome atmosphere. The downfall for me was that their menu was limited during happy hour and you could only order the things off of it. I must say if you like mules you have to try the strawberry mule. It is so good, perfect mix of bitterness, sweetness, and alcohol! I loved it. Everyone ordered a little dish of their own, I chose to go with the bacon burgers. They were alright I was expecting them to have meat on them too but they literally mean burgers with thick pieces of bacon on it! It actually ended up tasting pretty good though. We also ordered their pizza of the hour for our table. It was amazing. The crust was perfectly cooked and not too thick or doughy. This is a cool hidden spot in San Diego. Definitely adds a nice touch to the bay park area with its more hipster vibe. The service was notable as they were very kind and helpful but not over bearing!"], ["Brent C.", "This place has to be one of my favorites places in San Diego.I've only been here for dinner but I've been impressed with every single plate I've tasted in the two times I've been here. They might have less than a handful of entrees and it might be in an understated area of Mission Bay, but don't let this fool you. Their entrees, pizzas, share plates and specials have all impressed me. Let's start with the PORK WINGS. First of all, the pork is perfectly cooked. It falls right off the bone and you can tell as it breaks apart and the steam comes out from the middle that it is beautifully moist and tender. But the killer part is the sauce that is dredged all over. It strikes the flawless balance of sweet, salty and tangy that just makes you just say WOW. I know this for a fact because every time I see someone taste these, they literally say WOW.As for other delicious share plates, the house fries are pretty winner because they are just the perfect crispness and served with a delicious truffle oil garlic aioli. The carnitas tacos feel very San Diego with their blend of corn, avocado, and creme fraiche and the carnitas are well-seasoned and tender. Every pizza I've had has been amazing too. There was this special pizza with brown butter, arugula, shrimp, and bacon and it was so good we had to order a second one. Their entrees are limited but I've loved all of them. The roasted crispy skin chicken served over a mushroom risotto with crispy panchetta was delicious. I believe this is topped with the same sauce they put on the pork wings, which makes this an automatic home run. My friend had the catch of the day, which was rock fish, and it was served with this coconut lime grain (can't remember if it was quinoa or cous cous or something similar), which was just divine.On top of that, they serve rotating, local craft beers and their cocktails are damn delicious. I especially love their apple pie mule and souther gentleman. We ended the night sharing some biscotti gelato and it was the perfect cap to an amazing dinner.If I have one favor of you to ask of you from reading this review, it would be to give this place a try. Neither the menu nor the location may seem anything out of the ordinary, but their simple concepts with dynamic flavors will make you think otherwise."], ["Darlene B.", "Wow this was mind blowing! I saw Community Manager, Brad B.'s review and pictures for this place...I trust his opinion and knew I had to check it out for myself. The location for this place is off my tracks, definitely had to use Google Maps to get here. It was crowded for a Saturday Night, and this place does not take reservations. So initial walk in, the host said it'd be 15-20 minutes (with no where to sit and wait) or he was about to seat a party who was waiting at the bar. The bar serves full menu and drinks. We were able to snag 2 of those bar stools! It was perfect. The bartender/waitress was soooo nice! She answered our questions and made kickass mules for 2. :) Luce Mule -- SOOO delicious, portion was large, got a good buzz off of it. I decided to go with the short rib for dinner. The portion was small, cost $11 and it was made very well. The meat was tender, the crispy onions on the side w/ mashed potatoes were so good! I couldn't believe it. It was a perfect size in my opinion. Their brunch menu also looks really appealing, can't wait to try. I almost had to leave for a family emergency and the bartender was so nice, she was getting us to-go boxes quickly...Uh, i loved it. Fries are good too.I don't recommend this place for large groups, the location itself is quite small..but the food is worth the wait, if you have to."], ["Darlene B.", "I seriously loved this place!! I loved everything about it - the service, the ambience, the drinks, and the FOOD!! It was our first time coming here, and we honestly didn't know what to expect. But the reviews and the photos were great so we decided to come check it out. The service was great! The guys were so attentive; right when we walked in, we were greeted. And I think it's safe to say, we weren't greeted like we were customers but more like \"out of town friends\" who came to visit a good friend's place. Yes, it was like that! We were seated right away and our server was very friendly, professional and knows his stuff! :) After getting the run through of the specials and drinks, we decided to order the lamb tacos, house fries, and the charcuterie board. I LOVE charcuterie, so of course it was my favorite, but we loved everything else! The flavors in the lamb tacos were perfectly defined, the fries and the aioli that came with it was great, and everything on the charcuterie board was great! My tastebuds were having a party!! I also ordered their strawberry Mule, which was made with their house strawberry infused bourbon! Wow! It just became my favorite drink! Also did I mention that our server was really awesome!?Overall the place was great! I would definitely come back again! I like that the location isn't in a very busy area, but the place was sure packed! The only complaint I'd have really is that I wish our table wasn't so small because we were running out of space to put our plates in! Lol.."], ["Bryan L.", "This place is a homerun. Great atmosphere, great bar, great food and great service. \u00a0Oh, yes, did I say \"bar\". \u00a0Hello, it is a bar, not a family restaurant.

It wasn't that busy and they were showing the Dodgers playoff game! Bonus points! We ordered french fries, sweet pizza, and crispy chicken. The french fries were delicious and I liked the garlic dipping sauce but it was too watery. My pizza was good and huge. I had half the next day. I had a taste of the brussels sprouts that came with the crispy chicken and they were very plain. I wish they would have added some pancetta or bacon to liven it up. Overall, fairly good food and excellent service. The bathrooms were clean and parking was super easy (street)."], ["Jen B.", "First timer. \u00a0Pizza, salads and pork wings are excellent. \u00a0 Negroni, the bartender, is super nice and accommodating. \u00a0Staff is really friendly. \u00a0Had a fun day of eating and drinking (and they even put NASCAR on for us) at LUCE. \u00a0Win-win. \u00a0Recommended for foodies and drinkers!!!"], ["Yulia G.", "Great neighborhood place with Awesome staff.

(I think I just made up a word). \u00a0It had a nice mix of greens, roasted peppers, grilled veggies that were still crispy (yum!) and delicious, juicy tri tip. \u00a0I wish they had more meat in the dish cuz it was so well seasoned.. could have eaten the rack of meat. \u00a0My colleague got the tuna melt and he scarfed it down. \u00a0Simple, tasty, great service. \u00a0Those are the three words to sum up the experience. \u00a0Prices were average - matches the quality of food, and parking is reasonable (no lot, but you can manage to find decent street parking).

Beer, multiple varieties of mule's or great food, this place has it all. If you aren't a Baypark or Bayho local, head elsewhere, do not pay attention to the great reviews. This wonderful place does not exist. It is merely a figment of your imagination."], ["M. C.", "Honestly I kept seeing it from the 5N as I'd head home from various outings. Finally tried it with my sister over the holiday weekend, short wait for lunch.The trip tip sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had- well seasoned, multiple flavors and textures, and meat easy to bite (I hate sandwiches where the middle slides out as you bite into it!). Fries were on point and that garlic aioli (?) was so evil-y delicious. Fish tacos were solid, side salad had a lovely vinaigrette, slaw was lacking (no dressing? oops, was that just a plate decoration? haha). We had the peanut butter gelato sandwich, loving the cookie crumble/chocolate crust. My sister's gin gin drink was light and refreshing, not too sweet. Didn't get a chance to try the beer selection as plenty of drinking going on later, but I plan to on my next trip. Service was excellent at the bar. Overall we were very impressed, really pleased with wonderful lunch at a reasonable price. Definitely looking forward to going back. Only downside is the street parking but we found something within a few blocks. It's a small little place (did I see a side expansion?) but that won't stop me. 4.5 stars."], ["Erica R.", "Love this place!!! They have great food and the best Mules in town. It's hard to find a great kid friendly place, so we're so happy we found this place. My kids love the Sunday brunch. Chicken and waffle :)"], ["Liza S.", "Our first time eating here. We tried the charcuterie plate, fries with truffle oil, frito misto, mussels and the pizza margherita. My girls tried everything and my 8 year old can't wait to go back. Everything was savory and tasty. If we had room we would have ordered more. The four of us thoroughly enjoyed the food while watching the USA women's soccer team win. The service was impeccable. My daughters chocolate milk had too much syrup and they were very accommodating to make her another one. We were never rushed or felt neglected.

Can I get an Amen?!!! Luce Bar & Kitchen is located in the Bay Park area right off Morena Blvd. near the well known Siesel's Meat and boasts the same owner as Baci, another nearby restaurant. Here is a breakdown of our super delicious lunch:Lamb Shank Tacos: The lamb in these tacos were so tender chewing was optional. The cabbage along with the mayo based sauce perfectly complimented this super moist lamb. The fries came with two dipping sauces, the usual ketchup based sauce and a jalape\u00f1o sauce that rivaled the Brigantine's. So tasty I could have drank the sauce by itself. The fries themselves were good and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this entree. Mussels and Grilled Fish Sandwich: My wife consumed these dishes. Only crumbs and shells were left on her plates. No sharing was involved. Enough said. Societe Pupil IPA: My eyes lit up like a pinball machine when I saw that they had this IPA on draft. It's good to know I can enjoy one of my favorite IPA's without having to go to the brewery. The seating is first come first serve and the seating unfortunately is limited. I would recommend coming during an off hour to guarantee a seat. Five stars!! Amen!!!!!!"], ["Paul P.", "It was very busy at 5:30 on a Wednesday night. \u00a0Service however was very attentive. \u00a0We decided to have the Lamb Tacos, stuffed mushrooms and a pear and walnut salad. \u00a0The Lamb Tacos were an excellent value. \u00a0Good flavor, although a little more seasoning would have helped, and a large portion of lamb contained in two tacos.The stuffed mushrooms came with bone marrow. \u00a0Again, needed more seasoning to make the flavors pop. \u00a0Four of them to an order. \u00a0I thought the prices were on the high side for this entree.The pear and walnut salad was as described. \u00a0Really fresh ingrediants but seemed to lack a cohesiveness that made it something more than just lettuce, pear, goat cheese and walnuts on a plate. \u00a0Maybe more dressing would have helped. \u00a0We saw the charcuterie board being delivered to the table next door. \u00a0It looked very good and also a good value. \u00a0I can't give Luce just an A-OK because I would like to come back. \u00a0However, I'm not quite committed to Yay!

As other reviews have mentioned, the location is a bit random, but the place itself is nothing short of wonderful. From the start, the waitstaff was friendly and very attentive.

The little things. Anyway, my friend and I ended up splitting their Margherita flatbread as an appetizer. Really delicious. I ordered their salmon entree, which was unreal. The dish had some sort of cucumber/tapioca component to it. Definitely an interesting combination of flavors, but it worked.We obviously ordered their gelato ice cream sandwich dessert (Dear Scale, go screw yourself. Sincerely, Lisa's tastebuds). So, so good.

We were hungry and immediately asked for food but the bartender said \"kitchen is taking a break until 3pm\". We were a bit surprised since I've never seen a kitchen taking a break, especially close to lunch time but it wasn't a big deal since there was football on to keep us entertained.The interesting part is that there was a solo lady at the end of the bar who was trying a bunch of drinks and food... And Apparently giving reviews to the manager. Everyone was around her. So the kitchen was closed but only for the rest of us, mortals, but working full speed for the lady.I had the best drink I've had in years, a grapefruit mimosa. It tasted sweet enough, smelled delicious and it was an absolute hit. I had three. Bartender really did right in there.For food we tried their pizza of the day: pesto sauce, artichoke and Portuguese sausage and it was fantastic. It seems more like a flatbread to me but again, not that much of a big deal. We also had the meatball sliders (OMG so so so good) and I definitely recommend them. Sliders were so good we decided to try another kind, so we got the pulled pork. Those were good but the pork had too much BBQ sauce, wich I didn't like it. It wasn't salty and porky like pulled pork should be, it was sweet. Not bad, but not my favorite.My boyfriend had three beers and in total we got an almost $80 check before the tip. It was a bit pricey for a casual Sunday app/drinks at a small neighborhood bar, so that's why I'm dropping a star. I think the drinks drove the cost high considering the sliders were only $7. And it was happy hour time. Imagine of it was regular time?!Either way, despite the price, I really enjoyed that place and will definitely come back.

But I sincerely feel that our server, Bobby profiled us and thought he'd add gratuity to a bunch of young people thinking we wouldn't tip. That offended me and was kind of a bummer.

You cannot seat yourself, as they will seat you either at the bar or at a table, according to the order of your arrival. I do recommend that they organize a better system so that new arrivals can be greeted immediately and have a place to check in.Luce Bar and Kitchen is definitely doing something right!

For pizza we ordered Capricciosa ($12.25) -Tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham mushrooms, artichoke hearts and olives. The pizza was woodfired (from what we could see of the oven) and after a generous sprinkling of parmesan and red chili flakes, it was amazing. Def. one of the best pizzas I've had in SD. The are where the restaurant is is not the greatest. There were a lot of transients and \"interesting\" looking people in the neighborhood. I would not want to walk here alone. Our waiter was pretty terrible. He was a young Italian boy, with facial hair. He barely came by. However, the bus boy George was amazing. Super attentive and friendly.

Sat at the bar to make it easy. The bartender took our drink orders and handed us some menus. I've been in here before for drinks and appetizers (cheese, crackers, meats) but hadn't had their pasta. Their entrees are Italian named so you want to read the details to choose your dish. They also had an extra sheet slipped in for Specials of the Day which were easier to read through. My friend got the Lasagna off the Specials of the Day menu to make it easy and I decided to eat the Lobster Ravioli (Ravioli All' Aragosta) off the dinner menu. They give you bread with some marinara sauce while you wait. The Lasagna was hearty. Lots of tomato sauce and meat. I only tried a little bit but it was good. My Lobster Ravioli was good. Sweet to the taste too. Probably the marsala wine. There were 2 jumbo shrimps on top with diced tomatoes. It was nice and lite so I didn't feel overly full and I finished the whole plate. Lots of seating. I've never seen it too crowded in here but it's a nice spot. (FYI: Our entrees were about $15-20 each. Specifically, my lobster ravioli was $15.50 based on their website)"], ["Torrey S.", "Yess! New Happy Hour spot has been found! First off, the d\u00e9cor in this place is not that of a traditional Italian place- sometimes they feel too stuffy. Postino is open and cool with concrete accents and monochromatic coloring.

The calamari was perfect, bruschetta was fresh with massive chunks of tomato and mozzarella- they did not skimp out.

After last night, we immediately remembered why we choose to have our date nights on weekdays and not weekends. We made a reservation for 2 people at 8 pm on a busy Saturday night and got there around 8:10 pm. When we walked in, we saw how crowded the restaurant was and realized they were understaffed. The whole entire room was full with customers and the waiters were running around everywhere. No one greeted us even though they saw us. I eventually had to come up and told them the waiter I had a reservation and was quickly brushed off. Finally, a host came up to us and greeted us and say us down within 5 mins. Since they were so busy, the food came out ridiculously slow so we quickly devoured all of the bread that were given us to start our meal. Well onto the food: Smoked duck breast salad ($8.95)- this was soooo good! There were thick slices of juicy smoked duck breast laying on top of a pile of spinach, crumbled bacon, pine nuts, and cranberries along with a creamy vinaigrette. This was the best salad I've ever had and I would probably even have this as an entree if I could. The flavors worked well together although I wish there was a bit of acidity to balance out the savory and sweet components. They even split the dish for us into 2 which I thought was a nice touch. Linguine w/ clams, mussels, and shrimp ($15.50)- you get to choose between white wine sauce or red sauce and I went with white wine. This dish was amazing!! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shellfish was fresh and full of flavor. I believe there were 3-4 shrimps and they were huge! For the price, I thought the dish would be smaller but it was big enough for me to only finish 1/3 of the plate and take the rest for to-go. I would def order this dish again! Penne w/ bay scallops and shrimp in pink sauce ($15.95)- my bf chose this dish and he liked it. I had a few bites and wished that the pink sauce was more creamy. It tasted like a plain marinara sauce to me which confused me because pink sauce is generally more creamy. It came with bay scallops which were small and the shrimp was the small, unshelled shrimp. I think if they served this with the big shrimps that came on my plate it would've been much better. The food was amazing and I would come back, preferably on a week night to avoid the dinner rush. The prices were also really good given that most Italian restaurants are pricy and come in small portions. On the other hand, the prices here were very affordable and the portions were huge! Can't wait to come back to try their happy hour which has the duck breast salad on it!"], ["misbah s.", "Coming in from LA, it took a while for the ma\u00eetre d' to sit us. However we did get our seats within 10 minutes. The restaurant was very busy and it was a Saturday night. The waiters were all rushing and several of them are sweating as well. It deafly did not make for a relaxed Saturday night out. The bread is quite hot and we scarfed down almost to Lowes of it with their typical marinara sauce.However, we did ask for all of oil Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. All the waiters were quite rushed I'm not sure why they were understaffed but I did make a comment if they were, the waiter actually nodded his head and said yes.The food itself we had ordered two types of gnocchi the first was a traditional gnocchi with pesto sauce and sun-dried tomatoes. The food that came out did not have any sun-dried tomatoes. We had to order a separate bowl of sun-dried tomatoes. It did not taste the same. My friend who had ordered this exact same type of gnocchi had raved about his dish and unfortunately was unable to get it the exact same way he originally ordered it. My gnocchi however was a black gnocchi with shrimp and scallops. It was quite tasty. We had ordered two glasses of red wine around $11 each and they were quite good. However the Wine was a little hot. This had forced me to put several ice cubes inside the wine in order to get it to room temperature.They also had a very large birthday party which was quite annoying simply because the guests decided to make so much noise and the other attendees decided to be as loud as Bar patrons. The waiters did not seem to mind at all it was cute at first but it got very annoying. I even made a joke to the waiter to go get me a slice of their cake because it seemed as if we were part of the celebration.The meal itself was around $65 with tax.

While the pasta was passable, the duck part was nothing more than bony chunks with some meat attached and a rather bland sauce. Nothing worse than having to pick out shards of duck bones every few bites. Had my friend not traded dishes with me halfway through the meal I would've had a miserable meal. My friend had a squid ink and scallop risotto (can't find the name on their menu at the moment) and it was delicious. There was a nice seafood flavor that was complimented by the saltiness of the ink sauce. That totally made my night. I don't know if I would have been able to handle a whole plate but it definitely made up for the crappy duck pasta.Our table had a cheese and meat appetizer as well as the Capresse (Beefsteak tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, roasted bell peppers and basil) which was awesome to start the meal with. The complementary bread and oil was great as well.The water was a great year."], ["Adria D.", "I really love this place for Happy Hour 5-7 everyday. They have $5 wells and wine $4 beers and an amazing selection of \"appetizers\" ranging from $3.50-7. I use the term appetizers loosely because they are like entrees for me. The Bruscetta for $3.50 is probably the consistently best bruscetta I have had anywhere. It's tomatoes are always perfectly ripe, the mozzarella is high quality and I love how super garlicky it is! If you don't like garlic do not order this! One of these orders has 4 large crunchy pieces and easily fills me up. My second favorite is the duck salad with pine nuts, bacon, and raisins for $6.25. The duck is served warm and tender, perfectly cooked served on fresh baby spinach in a delicious vinaigrette. The bacon and pine nuts add a nice crunchy texture. It has some depth with the warm tender duck and cool spinach and crunchy toasted pine nuts and chewy raisins (which i am usually not a fan of raisins in my food).The scampi with white beans and rosemary for $5.95 are my third fave and yummy too and a nice large portion! I have ordered the gnocci here twice and sent it back twice. They are sisters to Arreverderci and Buon Appetitto and that is my FAVORITE gnocci in the world so I am not sure what is going on with the gnocci here but I give up.Entree wise so far I am a fan of the Chicken Marsala, the osso bucco not so much.Some of the menu items are hit and miss. I always get great service and everyone works as a team which I do notice and appreciate!I am a fan!"], ["Lisa W.", "At first I was sad to be moving away from Arriverdeci, but realize II Postino was the sister restaurant to Arriverdeci but much bigger (so you don't have to wait for a table on a busy Friday night)Food was excellent. I got the Osso de bucco with risotto and man oh man, the risotto was very flavorful, it was the best tasting risotto I've ever had! And the meat, don't forget the meat, the meat was sooo delicious. Words cannot describe how good the osso de bucco taste. We also got the beef carpaccio-delicious as ever. The food here is a great deal, great prices for great portions. Only thing I did not like (minus one star) was how noisy this place was. Nothing intimate about it, even though it sounds and looks like a romantic dinner. No, not good for couples- great for groups. Also service was a bit lacking, they could be better... our server barely came around, and it took awhile for our orders to be taken. But it wasn't bad bad, it just wasn't extraordinary!Anyway, our new favorite Italian restaurant in town!"], ["Nic J.", "I was really impressed with this place when my gf and I stopped in for dinner the other night. The restaurant was pretty big inside with solid decor/ambiance. The hostess and the servers weren't very friendly but the food was awesome. I went with the Postino II pizza, which was absolutely awesome. She went with the squid ink gnocchi, also really good. They serve hot fresh bread with marinara sauce, they're a bit stingy with the sauce. The service was odd, not sure if they just wanted to get out on time or what. After we left there were still about 5 tables occupied. The waiter would come over and mumble stuff, couldn't figure out what he was saying but I continued eating my delicious pizza and then beat feet out of there."], ["Elena M.", "I had a great meal here last night. I asked for some intel on the two pinot noirs on the wine list and the server was informative and helpful which I don't always find to be the case at restaurants. I chose the San Simeon pinot noir and was very pleased. For my entree, I decided to keep it simple and ordered the penne arrabiate, which was penne with chicken in a spicy tomato sauce with sage. Although a simple dish, my entree was fabulous. The flavors were perfectly melded together to create a delicious and memorable sauce. This was a home run which I didn't expect with such a basic dish. I can't wait to return and try other things on the menu. Very reasonably priced too!"], ["Maylynne R.", "Mmmm... I've been here a couple of times. And it was actually pretty good, in terms of food and service. I really like the environment (although it's more a night time place, since the dim lighting sets a good mood for a date). It's huge, and I feel like it would make a good place for a private dinner party (always a plus). \u00a0But, the last time I went, the service (for lack of a better word) sucked. And it wasn't because it was busy. In fact, there was almost no one in there. My cup had lipstick on it. Gross! Literally made me think that they don't wash their glasses at ALL. Because it wasn't smeared lipstick or anything, it actually looked fresh. DOUBLE GROSS. And on top of that, the guy was just chillin at the bar stools on his phone and didn't check back on me until I requested for more bread. He was incredibly unattentive, and he wasn't even doing anything. They get an extra star for the food being alright. Not the best, but definitely not the worse. I would go again to try a different entr\u00e9e, and in hopes that the service is a lot better."], ["Heather Z.", "Sitting in our hotel room trying to figure out where to eat for dinner I came across this gem while sifting through the hundreds of restaurants on Yelp that weren't too far from us. Checked out the menu online before we went (parents are picky) & decided to try it.Seated quickly; server was very friendly & gave us plenty of time to pick what we wanted. I tried their chicken & squash risotto; being a huge risotto lover (although I suck at making it myself) I give theirs a 10/10. It was delicious & the portion was HUGE. \u00a0My mom tried their amaretto chicken & it had the perfect balance of sweet & a little nutty. Dad had the seafood stew type dish; a little too spicy for him but the seafood was fresh & delicious. I might also add that they have a very large wine menu so I recommend checking that out as well. This place is perfect for a nice night out with friends or family & also has the ambiance for a romantic date night. When I'm in town I will definitely be coming back here."], ["Arlene P.", "This place seems huge. it is spread out and has a few different areas. \u00a0Tables, a huge bar and some loungey low tables.

Having been to Italy a numerous amount of times i felt the food here was pretty good! \u00a0We (my Girlfriend and I) have been eating here regularly for the last 2 years or so and have enjoyed many meals tat this place! Usually the service is average but recently the service has been getting worse and worse when we went in there for a meal. On our last visit i spoke to the owner/manager and informed him that the service wasn't the best on tonight's occasion. He apologized and put it down to being an off night. However on the way out, our waiter came up to me and said that if i wanted better service i should leave him a lot more money as a tip (30% region). I said to him that this is outrageous & who is he to decide how much i tip. After all IT'S MY GOD DANM MONEY, so i shall do with it what i please. He then went on to say how if you want better service then tip more, which i don't fully disagree with. Although been very regular at this place most times visiting there once every week we felt that this wasn't necessary, after all not everyone has money to waste. \u00a0Unfortunately what used to be our favorite place to eat turned into THE WORST RESTAURANT IN NORTH PARK BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE & we shall not be going back there ever again. It's a huge shame that a couple of waiters GREED FOR TIPS has cost the business in the long run."], ["Blake G.", "Upscale, but casual, never have to wait for a table, and the service and food rivals the best of little Italy. Do not pass this place by if you love Italian food!Service is personable, and prompt. The food comes out alarmingly quick, but is consistently al dente, and perfect every single time. One of my favorite places in North Park for an affordable dinner."], ["Angie G.", "WHOA! Black Ink Pasta is one of the best tasting pasta noodles out there! (I seem to think so). The food here is on point. Seafood is fresh and so is the marinara sauce! From the moment you sit down, you are greeted with water, bread and the fresh marinara dipping sauce. This is a really cute, sophisticated, and mellow restaurant. FYI- try not finding a parking spot around North Park, they have FREE parking in the back. Which is ALWAYS a plus!This place is definitely a \"first date\" kind of restaurant."], ["Kyle Z.", "Our experience at Il Postino was about as mediocre as it gets before it starts to be just bad. Everything started out ok, we arrived and were seated promptly. The table was wobbly, which is a pet peeve of mine, but I got over it. Bread was ok.  Wine list was good and moderately priced. The bruschetta was decent, I've made better but it was pretty tasty, but after that things seemed to go down hill. \u00a0I ordered the penne arrabiata which was way too spicy and drowned out any other flavor (and I dig spicy stuff!). \u00a0My date got smoked chicken fusilli. Neither were tasty. The arrabiata came way to spicy like I said and came with chicken mixed in (not well cooked), which in my book (and most other Italians) is a big \"no-no\" Additionally the portion was E.nor.mous. Way too much for one person. The fusilli was a little better, super creamy with chicken and A LOT of fake smoke seasoning, which really ruined it. Again, huge portion. We ate a little, had everything boxed up, tossed it on the way home. Pretty unimpressed. I would go back for drink and bruschetta, but the pastas were pretty bad."], ["martha w.", "Really enjoyed the happy hour, which I had a great Italian wine for two bucks off and an eggplant dish.

The food is tremendous, and the atmosphere is awesome as well. So convienient for us north parkians, and the prices are pretty good for what you get. Real italians not only cooking, but serving. The service can be a tad slow, but thats okay because its such a cool place with great food. Go with friends, enjoy a bottle of wine (some are very cheap). #219 congress springs is 19 bucks for a Pinot Noir and its one of best wines for the money. Cant beat that. I always go with the linguine mediterrano. Lots of seafood in the dish and the pasta sauce is tasty. If you like a lot of sauce this is the place, but if you dont like too much tell them to go light on it or your pasta will have tons of sauce.

We were a large group of 20+ people and they set up a U-shaped table for us to all still be able to see/talk to each other. Our drink orders were taken promptly and the bread baskets were always full! Quite a feat on a Friday night with many other customers to take care of. Our friend ordered us some appetizers and I got to try some of the calamari. You can never go wrong with starting off with calamari. We got three plates to share among us and there was plenty to go around for seconds.For my main dish I got the gnocchi of day which I think was called gnocchi primavera. It was in the house marinara sauce which was great! The sauce tasted so fresh which was a nice change from all that bottled pasta sauce I've been eating at home lately. My boyfriend got the lobster ravioli which was great as well. The portions for his ravioli was a bit small but he just cleaned up the sauce with the extra bread and was full. I had leftovers for lunch the next day which I was happy about. Everyone was pleased with their meals and half of us had enough to take home for the next day. The waiters were prompt with their service, always refilling our waters and making sure if we wanted anything else. They brought out a fantastic slice of tiramisu with a candle on it for my friend and we all sang happy birthday. After we had our dessert the waiter came around and got each of our individual orders to give us separate checks! Most places get all pissy when we ask about separate checks but they went ahead and assumed we wanted them. The waiter remembered most of our orders from the beginning too so it wasn't even that difficult! I would give this place 4 stars for the food since it wasn't out of this world but bumped them up to 5 stars because they really took care of us. Definitely would come back for a date night if we're in the area."], ["Tanya H.", "I wish I could give this place 5 stars simply for the service. The bussers were on point the entire time. My water glass was filled after every sip. And they were so pleasant. However, the food left something to be desired.

If the menu/taste improved I would love this place."], ["Reesa G.", "Every time I dine at Il Postino, I always find a new favorite dish! The quality of food here is top notch, and everything is always well seasoned. The calamari & zucchini fritti is my go-to appetizer, and I love trying the different pastas. On my most recent visit, I had the Capellini Bosco e Mare - angel hair pasta with shrimp, zucchini & mushrooms in tomato sauce. The angel hair pasta was cooked to perfection and was not stuck together. They don't skimp out on seafood here. My pasta came with five or six pieces of giant, succulent shrimp. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms, but that didn't stop me from enjoying every single bite of my pasta. The restaurant has a cute, romantic vibe. I usually go after the dinner rush when it's not too crowded or noisy. The service is good, and the servers are quick to refill waters and bring another basket of the complimentary bread."], ["Jennifer J.", "We went here because devanti enoteca was booked, along with all the other good Italian places. Mediocre. The bread and weird marinara sauce they give you for free is..odd. I had the lobster ravioli which had a strange sweet taste. I couldn't even taste the lobster, it was a weird mashup. And the weirdly placed shrimp were even weirder. I ordered a speciality cocktail and it had barely any alcohol and came in a tiki inspired glass with fruit on the side, out of place for a \"classy\" Italian restaurant.

One of the servers quickly picked up a pair of menus and led us to the right side of the restaurant and sat us right next to the deli counter. It was a really odd table - we felt like we were in the reject section (not in the main part of the restaurant where we usually sit), and it was not exactly romantic. So we went back to the front of the house to ask for a new table.I asked the hostess if she found our reservation, and she said yes. She led us to another table right next to the bar - a loud and high traffic area. Again we were not pleased and expected a better table, so we gave up and walked out (for good). The only explanation I can think of is that someone took our reservation over the phone and it never actually made it to the books.On top of all this, the restaurant was over half empty at that hour.

OMGosh! That's just too long! But it was a Saturday night, and we figured just about anywhere we went at this point would be about the same. So we gave our name to the hostess and waited. A spot opened up at the bar...and our eyes looked beggingly towards the bartender. He smiled, waved us over and cleaned up the spot for us. Great! I thought, we were told a 1/2hr, we were instead seated in 5min...we are off to a great start. Unfortunately, that was the peak of our experience. I'm not entirely sure who our bartender was. It wasn't the nice man who waved us to our seats, but a slightly plumper woman I think. She was in so much of a hurry to get our orders! We had never been here before, in fact - we didn't even have menus yet! So we told her so and she threw some up...and that was the last we saw of her for awhile. It didn't take long for us to decide we wanted the BBQ chicken pizza to split, and a Caesar salad; on the other hand it did take long to grab ANYONE'S attention to order. We didn't even have drinks. lol at this point Clay was so angry, so tired, and so HUNGRY he wasn't even talking to me anymore :( 20min later, we did see our bartender again to order. We also were able to get drinks. But just one round, for she never returned to offer us more. Expo's brought our food. The Caesar salad was great! Not too much dressing. But let's be real here people, it was just a really good Caesar salad...lol big deal. Our pizza on the other hand smelled delightful, but didn't quite hit the spot. We wanted dessert, but didn't want the torture that was bound to come along with it. When we were finished eating, we got to play another 25-30min of the waiting game. In fact, we were never even able to get our actual bartender's attention again. We'd see her and try to wave her down but it was useless. Another bartender, (the name on the check said Jason?) was able to drop off our bill. I had my card ready when it was handed to me! But he didn't take it with him.

We were there for at least an hour and half, and maybe 20 min of it was spent eating!! It upsets me when server's/bartender's act like they are \"put-out\" by having to help you.

I probably should've waited a few minutes before digging into the pizza because the toppings started sliding right off. The pork shank was delicious.

The only pasta they make is the pappardelle which can be substituted for any of the non-house made pastas. We visited on a weekend night around 8:30 PM and this big, lovely space was about 25% full, if that. \u00a0There's no one with experience or even proper training exercising quality control here. Ordered entrees and wine. We were offered no bread, the pasta sauce tasted liked pasta water. Our only flavor salvation was the salt shaker on our table. My pappardelle al limone looked anemic-and tasted the same. Not even a sprinkle of herbs or parsley. The cooks here put food out like they're serving up cafeteria food. Don't bother visiting. So regrettable as this could've been a vibrant, hip restaurant. Sad."], ["Shari S.", "I was there last night and had a terrible service experience. The two star rating is for the food which was excellent. Here's a quick rundown. -we were seated and not given menus. -we asked for menus and were given 1 (there were 6 of us)-we asked for more and were given 2 more -it took 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table (we tried to flag someone down several times)-they were out of three wines we ordered we took a substitution that was suggested. It was ok. -other tables got bread, we didn't until we asked-we waited 45 minutes for our food-my daughters plain noodles coming last-our bill included the original wine we ordered and we were charged for a full plate of plain noodles even though we ordered a half children's portion. Food was great but I will never return. Neither will anyone I was with."], ["nicolette l.", "I love this place, from the ambiance to the friendly staff to the varied menu. The prices are reasonable too -- a delicious wood fired pizza and salad can feed two and only run you $20. There is a great selection of pasta, seafood, and meat dishes. Portions are decently sized. Il Postino is a good place for a date or catching up with friends, and is accommodating to kids too."], ["Kiki R.", "This might be my favorite restaurant in San Diego. The food is solid. My favorite dishes on the menu are the \"simple\" dishes. What's the word for that....They are simple because there are few ingredients but they are combinations that you don't see in a lot of restaurants. There are definitely dishes that aren't \"simple\" but those are my favorite ones. Ex: Fettuccine al limon, a pasta dish with lemon sauce and prosciutto. Parking: Apparently there is a parking lot in the back but I've never tried it. It's North Park so street parking is difficult but there's always that paid parking garage on 30th and North Park Way, only a block away.Food: I guess I already covered that. Comforting, solid, everything is good. They bring fresh baked bread and a spicy tomato dip when you sit down. My favorite thing on the menu is the mediterranean linguine. Tomato sauce with clams, mussels, shrimp. Pizza here is excellent.Drinks: Extensive wine list with LOTS of affordable and by-the-glass options. Beer list is good, it is not a brew pub so don't expect 30 choices. Full bar with a list of interesting looking house cocktails (haven't tried yet).Service: I've never seen a waitstaff like this at such an affordable restaurant. Staff is courteous, friendly, prompt but not hovering. I came here for my birthday a few years ago. I had 20 people in my party and all of our food was delivered within 5 minutes of each other. All the food was perfect. We had a server who was attentive to everyone. Last time I went here there was a gentleman who was just waiting and watching to see if anyone needed assistance.Ambience: Great ambience. Bustling but not chaotic. Modern but not gimmicky.I grew up in Napa so I have a soft spot for this place because it reminds me of the restaurants that were there when I was younger. Definitely worth trying out if you like Italian. Try if before you go to some shot-in-the-dark place in Little Italy (some Italian places there can be pretty bad....)I DEFINITELY recommend this for a large group of people, a great alternative to getting pizza."], ["Jack M.", "I stopped in for lunch on Christmas Eve. I was in the mood for salad and pizza, always a good combination, so I ordered their Caesar salad, and the Pulcinella pizza with mozzarella, broccoli rapini and spicy sausage for $11.95 (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026).Before my meal arrived, they offer you complimentary house baked bread with marinara sauce. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) The bread was very moist and had great flavor. The marinara sauce was quite good as well. I liked that it was not to sweet nor to tangy, it was just right and tasty. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026). The Caesar salad arrived next, and I was very happy to learn that they prepare the salad in the traditional way with an egg and the remaining ingredients. So, that being said, the salad arrived glistening from the flavorful egg dressing throughout the salad. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) Also, it was heavily laden with nutty aged Parmesan cheese that not only provide a nice texture appeal to the salad, but a salty nutty element as well. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) I ate the Parmesan with the salad, and by individual slivers too. It was such a treat. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) The salad had a modest amount of croutons that were very good, but I wish they would provide more of the. I am a fan of those crunchy critters.The Pulcinella was great. The spicy sausage tasted great and had just enough spice to let you know it was there, but not overwhelm, and the broccoli rapini was well season and cooked under the heat of the oven. The leaves were tender, but the stems still had an al dente bite, but were cooked. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) The Mozzarella was of very good quality. It had a nice elasticity, and melt in your mouth buttery texture. The crust was perfect. It was baked to a light brown (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026) and was thin and crispy, but held up well to the toppings. (yelp.com/biz_photos/il-p\u2026). It was a great pizza with well layered flavors. I would order this again.I ate at the bar. The gentlemen, the bar keep, was very cool and was very knowledgeable about Italian food and such. Food did take a little long to come out of the kitchen, but the quality was there, so it was easily overlooked."], ["Kat F.", "Fabulous place! Service, ambience, and food are all fantastic.

And it is - AMAZING. You know you're in the right place when you're surrounded by actual Italians eating there. It seems as though no other culture takes their cuisine as serious - and they don't eff around. Our server was incredible and knowledgeable- he went through the menu with us, gave honest opinions and let us know what was made fresh in house. He also helped us make great wine selections! Loved him! We devoured the bread and butter to start and it was love at first bite. For dinner, my dining companion ordered the seasonal special - pumpkin ravioli - as suggested and it was fantastic. I wasn't interested in any pumpkiny nonsense, but it totally changed my mind.I was all about the lobster ravioli, except I was really in the mood for a creamier sauce so I almost ordered the mushroom, before our server saved the day and told me he could have the lobster concocted with a saffron cream sauce. Whaaat? Lets do it. MAMA MIA - what an excellent decision! Best meal I've had in ages. I practically licked the plate - it was SO damn good. I dream about it still. And to end our perfect dinner we thought it was appropriate to have some dessert. After much debate, we decided to ask our lovely server what he suggested. The Napoleon, no hesitation. Without fail, he was so right. It was the best I've had. So so good. Made in house of course and good to the last bite. I seriously can't wait to return here. I loved the service, I still dream about the food and I loved the open, family style, yet still refined atmosphere. It might be my new favorite restaurant. No joke."], ["Adriana S.", "Love this place! It's our #1 go to place when were in NP. We never make reservations and always get seated fast, of course we tend to go for early dinners. The service is great, everyone is very nice and friendly and fast. I like the post office theme. I can't say I have a favorite dish here as I have tried something different every time we've come here and never been disappointed. I must say the Duck Pappardelle is delicious, this coming from a girl who dislikes duck. I've yet to try their Pizzas, but I bet I will not be disappointed either. I almost forgot to mention...their bread and tomato sauce are amazing! I could just eat that as my main course."], ["Katia P.", "One of the best happy hours in San Diego !

I like to get the basic pizza the first time I go into the place. \u00a0It was not bad but it really just tasted like a basic corner pizza place. \u00a0The cheese tasted like cheap pre-shredded frozen stuff. \u00a0Too much oil in the cheese. \u00a0Its the kinda of cheese you see clear grease seeping out. \u00a0That kinda cheese is for delivery pizza. \u00a0The dough was alright but the sauce was drowned out by oily cheese. \u00a0If you want pizza go next door. \u00a0My wife had a sea food pasta dish. \u00a0The scallops,tasted frozen and were very chewy and the sauce was way too buttery. \u00a0The pasta seemed like high quality dry pasta not fresh. \u00a0Dont get me wrong, its not terrible. \u00a0It's just not good enough for a second visit with so much better italian food in SD. \u00a0Cut a few bussers and like at 3/4 of the menu and focus on fresh ingredients. \u00a0Less is more sometimes."], ["Amanda J.", "Some of the best gluten free pasta I've ever had!

When my gf & I arrived it wasn't too packed or overly busy. The ambiance is quite decent. The bar area is in the middle while there are tables all around the restaurant.

I was having trouble deciding between the risotto with truffle oil mushrooms and parm & the squid ink linguini with scallops, leeks, and shrimp. I opted for the risotto since my friend sitting next to me had ordered a squid ink gnocchi and offered to share. I absolutely LOVED the risotto. It was very flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I got to try the squid ink gnocchi and I though that was really good too (I love squid ink). It was pretty nice sitting around my friends because I got to try everyones dishes (: The carbonara was really buttery and sooooooo tasty! The service was pretty good.

The weather was perfect but we could not get over the potent smell of trash.On my way to the restroom I overheard a man telling his girlfriend he saw a cockroach by the bar. Nice. By this time we already had eaten our food, so... yolo? Speaking of food, when our food came out, it was not the fresh delicious Italian we were expecting. The food was Luke warm at best and seemed as if the chef used old/stale ingredients. It was edible. We decided we wanted dessert but they were out of the only treat I desired so we just left. The WORST part, while we were eating our sub-par dinner, we could hear the chef Yelling/mistreating the waitstaff... F*ck that.

What I keep on coming back for is their Spaghetti Carbonara, it is made up of Pancetta, Shallots, Tossed Egg, Parsley cream and Parmigiano and topped with Parmesan cheese. It is so delicious! You can also bring your own bottle of wine, with a corkage fee of course. When it's not too busy the chef comes out to the dining area and meet the customers.

While they have a solid regular menu, I prefer their daily specials. The portions are on the larger side, which makes getting in multiple courses challenging. For dessert, don't even attempt the Pope's Pillow alone -- split it.This trip, our table shared some appetizers and I had one of their specials for my main course -- veal ragu. It was very tasty and did not disappoint. I've had the gnocchi in the past from their menu -- one of the house specialities, but I found it too salty for my taste and couldn't finish it.They offer inside and outside seating. The place is rather cozy -- when it gets busy you start to notice the loudness. That's one of the reasons I prefer to book earlier in the evening, to avoid the crowd.

I will def. be ordering the Ravioli Rossi next time around."], ["Leigh P.", "As an Italian-raised, Jersey-born girl I cannot express how happy I am to have found my go-to Italian spot right in my West Coast neighborhood :) this place is the perfect date spot as well as the ideal setting to grab a Sunday night feast with your friends!Want menu recommendations?

Really good.Chianti- don't know the maker but was super good.Capris salad- amazingly good. Comes with 4 portions.Prosciutto and mozzarella - this dish was a great appetizer. Very fresh and salty! So good.No AC- unfortunately they don't have AC and it was ridiculously hot this Friday night. Sweating was crazy. I deducted one star just because how uncomfortable it was."], ["Michelle O.", "Wow. \u00a0After being on the west coast for 8 years I finally found an Italian restaurant that is to die for.The meatball appetizer is unbelievable. \u00a0The sauce is perfect and the ricotta is so fresh. \u00a0I could eat this just for dinner.The Spaghetti and Lobster has huge chunks of fresh lobster in it and the sauce has a great thick consistency.You could hear the chef in the kitchen taking a lot of consideration into how quickly the waiters take the food from the kitchen to the table. \u00a0I heard him say something along the lines of \"lobster does not sit here when it's ready\". \u00a0I like that kind of service. \u00a0I like my dinner hot.The service is very good as well. \u00a0Great prices for what you are putting in your belly."], ["Grant V.", "WOW, this place is one my favorite in all of San Diego. I love the small house and the atmosphere is always positive. I love that they have different specials nightly and the food, well is just the my Grandma makes back home!!

Been there a few times and every time the burratas are delish, but the entrees are underwhelming. PB has a lack of great restaurants and this one is another average spot. It does have a nice, cozy ambience though. Go for the wine, apps, and ambience, but leave before dinner."], ["Jodi A.", "We were super excited to try this place after hearing such great things about it! The ambiance is super cute with an intimate and charming feel. However, the service was less than great. We weren't greeted for quite a while although someone did come by with bread and water. We absolutely loved our appetizer which was the burrata special with figs, arugula, and some kind of nut. I might return for this but the pasta left much to be desired. We shared two pasta, the pappardelle bolognese and the orecchiette with ground sausage. Something about the consistency of both pastas themselves was off, we have had plenty of fresh pasta before but taste and consistency of these noodles was not great. The flavors of the sauces and toppings did not seem well balanced and the dishes just came across as bland.Not sure if we will return but maybe we just ordered two of the more bland options on the menu. I would have liked to have really enjoyed our meal and time here! We might have been more likely to return if the service wasn't so poor."], ["Charlie C.", "Our group of 7 had a really pleasant experience dining here for me and my dad's birthday (we share the same birthday, awww right??). The ambiance is great - we were seated outside in their pseudo-patio, and it was extremely comfortable. The service was very good and the owner even came out to chat for a bit.The food was all delicious! I would recommend sharing a burrata, which is a mozzarella cheese dish. The free bread is also nice and warm, and comes with a delicious balsamic/olive oil dip. For an entree, you can't really go wrong with anything! The meat+mashed potato dishes are huge, and so was the spaghetti+meatball dish we got. The Ravioli Rossi came with around 5 large pieces of ravioli and was quite good as well. It's not the cheapest place, nor is it too expensive. A great place for a nice Italian dinner!"], ["E A.", "Definitely not worth the money for the quality you get.Our evening already started on a low note - we made reservations, were seated, and promptly ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually a woman came over and asked if we were helped - she was very sweet, and brought a waitress over, but it had been quite some time before we were even offered wine or bread (about 30 minutes of waiting by that point). There was no offering of a complimentary glass of wine or appetizer or anything; if the rest of the meal was impressive it could have been easily overlooked but it was just another disappointment onto a subpar experience.When we ordered, I learned that most of their pasta is NOT made fresh in house - just 2 dishes (the current specials, $24 and $34 each). \u00a0I decided on the mushroom pappardelle ($20), our party also had carbonara, bolognese, and the gnocchi which tasted like a pesto sauce. We started with the burrata which was delicious - this was definitely the best part of the \u00a0meal. I think if we had ended there the restaurant would have been 3 or 4 stars.The rest of the food then came out and was disappointing. My friend's bolognese was somewhat bland and not hot; the mushroom pappardelle was super bland and swimming in oil. The mushrooms were not flavorful, the sauce was only lightly seasoned (I think with saffron?) but there was not the strong flavor that is supposed to accompany pappardelle. My husband had the carbonara and noted the flavor was also somewhat bland and he found himself spooning red pepper onto the dish. My friend's gnocchi was okay but nothing special.Something else of note: The waitress asked if we wanted fresh ground parmesan but it was already finely ground in the bowl - was it actually fresh ground or Kraft? We couldn't tell based on appearance nor flavor. Either way when we asked for a small amount it was heavily supplied onto the dish; this did not improve the flavor.I don't know what I paid for with this dinner; I took home leftovers just because it wasn't worth the calories to keep eating it. I'm hoping I can reheat it with some fresh parmesan or goat cheese at home to salvage it. If you do decide to come here (there are many positive reviews, I'm guessing they had the burrata) just do the burrata. We didn't try desserts - it was already too late in the evening to stay."], ["dean p.", "Great night - relaxed and very country Italian with a Latin hint...Cod was supurb with a wonderful blend of fresh and cooked greens on top of garlic mashed potatoes and covered with an addictive tomatoe caper olive sauce!!! It was a birthday and the complimentary dark chocolate mouse was a great send off and the whole night has us coming back soon!"], ["Courtney O.", "Every time I think of Enoteca Adriano my mouth waters a little. My friend and I came in for my birthday and it was incredible. I had the orecchiette pasta in the best bolognese sauce I've ever eaten. It sounds simple enough but the flavors were extraordinary. Besides that, the meal comes with s delicious bread to devour. Another added bonus is that they have no corkage fee Monday through Wednesday. We stopped by the Ralph's before dinner and grabbed a bottle of wine to enjoy with our meal, which was so fun."], ["Danielle S.", "My favorite meal of my trip was had at Enoteca Adriano. Ordered the Ravioli Rossi- handmade ravioli encapsulating a silky seafood filling then smothered in a delicious red sauce/lobster reduction and topped with shrimp. Yum! Still thinking about that dish. \u00a0Also tasted my fella's Pappardelle Bolognese. Again, handmade noodles in a meaty ragu - the noodles, though, let me tell you about THE NOODLES. So delish. We skipped starters this time, but have enjoyed the Burrata Adriano, as well as, their Spinach (Spinaci) salad on past visits. This time we tried to save a little room for dessert. Dinner, wine & bread were filling, so we ordered the Pope's Pillow to go. After reading many reviews, I gathered that it's a must-try. I enjoyed it, alas, am not a \"dessert person\", so I would go for their Burrata or one of their delicious soups, instead. I'm just weird like that so I would recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth & penchant for pastry, fresh whipped cream and mascarpone.I love their menu - short & to the point, while still covering a wide variety of flavors and proteins. EVERYTHING sounds & smells amazing. If I lived in SD, I'd try something new each visit and work my way through the menu :) From just a few visits, I trust that each dish is as good as the last. Service was spot on this trip. In full disclosure, I would NOT recommend bringing children with you. We had less than nice service when we once brought my son with us ::dirty looks and snotty hostesses:: which took us sometime to get over and come back... if not for the delightful food. So, we've placed it in our \"DATE NIGHT only\" spot.Other than that hitch, this place is truly, a jewel in San Diego"], ["Sarah K.", "This was top five best meals I've ever had...that is saying A LOT!!Wow. The food is out of this world. Every single thing we ordered...bruschetta, homemade lasagne which is a Wednesday special, and the Chilean White Sea bass. All prepared absolutely perfectly with the richest flavors. Even the house bread was to die for. Good service. Took about 8 min when we first sat down to get a drink order in, which is a lonnng time for me, but after that it was smooth sailing. Not a very big restaurant inside so a tad noisy, but nothing mattered once you tasted the food. This was my birthday \u00a0meal \u00a0to celebrate 27 years of life and it was absolutely perfect. We will be coming back very soon!! Bravo!True FINE CUISINE"], ["Allyson L.", "Enoteca Adriano is by far my favorite restaurant in PB! It is a romantic little restaurant more in North PB, kind of away from the hustle and bustle which is so nice. They being you delicious cheese bread and marinara sauce while you look at the menu. It takes a lot of self control not to eat the full basket and get too full before I even have dinner. Last time I was there I had the stuffed chicken breast and my date had the sea bass, both were phenomenal. \u00a0Everything is good here, you can't go wrong! \u00a0I always leave with a happy tummy."], ["Marika K.", "They served us bread within a few minutes of being seated. The balsamic vinegar with herbs and evo was delicious with the freshly baked bread. It was so good we asked for more bread.For the appetizer, we ordered the Spinachi which had gorgonzola cheese, caramelized pecans, and strawberries mixed with balsamic vinagarette. I've typically seen these types of salads but with pears, not strawberries. I would definitely order this salad again.For our entrees my fianc\u00e9 really wanted lasagna, but they only serve it on Wednesdays. The waitress suggested a four cheese pasta which wasn't on the menu and added sausage to it. I ordered the Spaghetti con Polpette which is basically spaghetti with two big meatballs. Our meals arrived fairly quickly. The spaghetti in the Spaghetti con Polpette was flavored just ok, but when eaten with the meatballs, it is so delicious!! The four cheese pasta and sausage was on a level of it's own."], ["Danielle G.", "Brava!!! I am visiting family and they mentioned this place has really good Italian. I must admit I agree! Located in the Mission District of San Diego, this small, family owned business is quaint and comfy, perfect for a romantic night out with a paramour, or with a social gathering with family and friends. We ordered the bruschetta which was delicious!!! Diced and halved heirloom tomatoes mixed with delicious honey balsamic and julienned basil, a dollop of goat cheese with grilled ciabatta bread. \u00a0Items ordered were capellini pomodoro with grilled chicken, amazeballs. I also ordered a mixta salad and asked for gorgonzola crumbles and the honey- balsamic dressing subbing for the normal dressing \u00a0and they had no prob accommodating me. \"Now that's Italian!\" ( insert Italian accent). My younger daughter ordered Spaghetti marinara with grilled shrimp, delicious. My daughter ate all the 5 prawns in her pasta and asked for 2-3 more and they happily brought her out more in 5 minutes. My other daughter asked for a half order of angel hair with marinara, she loved it and asked for a second order which they brought out in 5 minutes with a smile. My niece ordered the minestrone and said it was very good. We all had their standard cucumber water and the kids ordered Italian sodas. Even though we asked for a lot of substitutions and extra orders, they were happy to make us happy. Total bill was $81 (minus tip) and well worth it! I'll definitely be returning."], ["Tram P.", "I think my bf and I have been here 5-6 times. They really never disappoint. The bread and dip is really worth coming for, as well as their wine selection. I always leave happy, full, service was nice, and the price is well worth it. There's a reason this place has almost 5 stars. Sure, all restaurants have their good and bad days, but you have to learn to overlook those minor details to truly appreciate any place you go. Like today, they admittedly told us they ran out of napkins... No big deal.

The ambiance, staff and food make me wish I could eat here everyday. This is a great for dates, special occasions or just a nice family dinner. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. You would think they're paying me to write this review, Lol but they aren't. Finally, the food is the best Italian food I have ever had. Everything is made from scratch and taste so fresh. Also, their complimentary cheese bread is so good that I can probably get full off of just that.

Never a dissapointment."], ["Miss B.", "April 2015 review Italian waitress with an accent was so cool and the owner came up to ask how our dinner was and greet us in Italian, nice touch.

Great service, cozy intimate ambience at night with Christmas lights in the outdoor patio which has heaters too. Great privately owned rest with crazy good food. Absolutely planning to return!!November 2015 return reviewDifferent experience on a Weds night. Prosecco was warm and flat. Bread was a little warm, but they changed the olive tapenade that goes with it to balsalmic vinegar and olive oil, standard. The meatballs were warm vs hot and flavorless and too big. The ricotta parm and pieces of pappardelle in it was a bad combo. The special, Seabass with spinach papardelle in a saffron sauce was so disappointing and bland. Probably won't be back. Very different experience this time. Took 45 mins for entree. Service was just plain slow."], ["Jackie J.", "A very good restaurant. I had the carpaccio and then the lobster ravioli. Very tasty. My wife had the burratta special (fig jam, fig pieces, arugula, small heirloom tomatoes, prosciutto ) and then the seabass special. We both really enjoyed those items. Desert was the pope's pillow. Wow. Very light and tasty (if I was to make it myself I think I would use less glazed strawberries or perhaps fresh strawberries that are less glazed but that's just a personal preference \u00a0(still a great desert). We sat inside on a hot September night and the fan above our table was not working. So it was a stuffy, sweaty dinner \u00a0(luckily we were dressed casually ). I was looking out at the lovely people on the patio and very envious. I think if I wasn't in such a good mood that evening it would have made my opinion a little negative but sometimes the food prevails. This was the first time we dined here. We were in the area on vacation. \u00a0We would definitely give it another try."], ["Christine V.", "I loved this place. Came with friends while visiting San Diego and brought some NorCal wines to share. First, the burrata, oh.my.god. There are burrata specials each night - Get it!The fresh bread and dipping sauce.

And I was like ugggghhh I'm soooo hungry what are we going to do there's NOTHING that I want in PB right now bc I wasn't in the mood for greasy/ simple food, I wanted something special lol.. Passed by this place and voila it was exactly what I was looking for..Ordered the burrata pesto e carciofini, which was a ball of soft creamy cheese served with artichoke (canned/bottled I think?), and drizzled with honey pesto and candied walnuts!! Well.. the burrata came and it was hooooomygosh probably the best appetizer I've had in a long time. Like forget charcuterie boards just give me this lol.. Umn but it wasn't what we ordered bc like 5 minutes later after several spoon fulls of cheese in, our server came with the burrato we originally ordered! whoops. \u00a0I was just so excited I just ate what the runner put in front of me but duh she gave us a different burrata!! delicious cheese with proschiutto laid besides it, drizzled with fig jam along with tomatoes, arugula and a balsamic reduction.. don't ask me which one i like better bc i could no sooner pick a favie star in the sky (anyone know where that's from? lol) Anyway, the cheeses were served with crostinis but the table bread was phenomenal!! \u00a0Stuffed with cheese and served alongside with balsamic vinegar, oil and herbs. \u00a0I mean that's all I needed. I could have that for dinner any day and be completely contented. \u00a0lol but duh we got more food..I had the parpadelle doci and Hiro S. had the special of the day pasta with spinach and sausage. \u00a0His was pretty bomb. \u00a0Bold flavors from the sausage.. Spinach that must have been thrown in super last minute bc it wasn't super wilted and disintegrated into the pasta like many spinach pasta dishes are.. Mine tho' lacked a bit of seasoning.. I don't normally say that bc I'm pretty sensitive to salt but I don't think my dish had any lol.. There was no salt on my table (that's a bold statement assuming everything will be perfectly seasoned) so i did what any normal girl would do! \u00a0Ask for a shit ton more salty parmigiano.. lol that gave it a lot more flavor.. my noodles too were a bit too overdone for me.. Hiro's were perfectly al dente but mine were too soft.. The mushrooms omg they were heavenly!! It's interesting bc it had like a seafood flavor to them. Not gross like fishy old mushroom flavor bahahah that sounds bad but it just had idk it was a varietal I've never had before whose aroma and taste made it seemed like you were eating fresh clams or something.. it was really good..I will definitely definitely come back to eat here.. Especially since there's no cork fee I mean hello.. Bring a bottle of tobin james and order a burrata and i am set for the evening! \u00a0Oh and obviously service was glorious.. My server bah I forgot her name, was super thorough and attentive.. She got real busy for a moment and it took a really long time to get our check but I think it's bc they a rush of ppl came in at the same time and they were understaffed, not bc she was just like neglecting us or forgot about us (i don't think lol).. anyway she didn't charge us for eating the wrong burrata either lol and instead of just letting us eat it and taking back the correct one, she let us have both! \u00a0So yes, will definitely come back!"], ["Genesis S.", "Came here right before the dinner rush with my mother (around 5p on a Thursday) Promptly seated and served quickly!

Please try the pesto bruschetta, the flavors are so tasty. I wanted to order more but I had to save room for the main course and (free!*) dessert. My mom got the sea bass with squid ink pasta and a lobster reduction sauce special and I had the gnocchi. The squid ink was very delicious and worth the 34$ price tag. The gnocchi, while fluffy, wasn't that great with the sauce which was a little bland to me. I like a lot of spice and bold flavors so I should have ordered something else. We got dessert on the house due to a mix up in the kitchen with my moms order (thank you so much!). I got the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and my mom got the sorbet. Both were perfect.

Best of all, we felt the prices were very good for the quality of the food & level of service (perhaps being in a residential non-oceanview location helps keep prices reasonable??) It was casual but nice all at the same time - perfect for coworkers, date night, dinner with relatives or guests, even kids!, etc.Two things: order the burrata and whatever fresh pasta they have as their special!!! It's always worth the few extra bucks to get the fresh pasta!We started with two appetizers: the seasonal honey-fig burrata and also the Burrata Enoteca (wilted spinach, onions, tomatoes)...both were delicious and different, but if I had to choose one, I'd stick to the classic one on the menu. After the burrata and filling up on the bread (to soak up the syrupy balsamic & oil...yummmm), I was already full but that didn't stop me from finishing most of my fresh pasta special entree (a thick spaghetti-type noodle with minced sausage and tomatoes--did not taste like regular 'spaghetti and meat sauce' - tasted so much deeper and more complex than that!!)Three coworkers ordered the \"often mentioned on Yelp\" Ravioli Rossi - and they enjoyed the rich lobster sauce and seafood stuffed ravioli--a decent portion, but everyone finished their plate. One coworker ordered the gnocchi, which was a huge portion of pillowy gnocchi, but it was all \"homogeneous\" in a gorgonzola pesto creamy sauce. I'd get bored eating this after a few bites, but it was done well and a good value if you're starving!For dessert, we got the \"often mentioned on Yelp\" \u00a0(but overrated) Pope's Pillow, creme brulee, and some more wine. We were all disappointed in the Pope's Pillow - why does such a nice restaurant use fake strawberry glaze??? The pastry didn't taste very fresh and left a greasy film in my mouth, like bad quality puff pastry often does. And the marscapone cream was good, but not spoon-licking good. The lemony creme brulee was a much better dessert and we fought for the last scoops of that one! Can't wait to come back here and try more of the menu on my next visit to San Diego!"], ["Kirsten R.", "First of all, very impressed that this restaurant could take a party of 15 on a Saturday night on relatively short notice. Rachel was the one that took our reservation and she was also our server.We were all very happy with the phenomenal service along with the food.

They bring out bread that is stuffed with fresh melted mozzarella with a dipping sauce. Oh my goodness. So good. They also brought out water glasses with thinly sliced cucumber. Very different. Gives the water a nice taste. We started out with Minestone soup. Fresh vegetables and pasta. What can I say but really good. I had the orecchiette Bosco with minced fresh sausage and a really good red sauce. \u00a0Excellent. Very tasty. My wife had the spaghetti con Polpette with two huge meatballs and fresh mozzarella. The meatballs were melt in your mouth goodness. Very good dish. The service was really good. Water cups were filled promptly and our food came in a timely manner.

The ambience was very cozy and warm. Filled will lots of regulars and locals. The house bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar told us that we would be in for a rest tonight. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped burrata special with fig, arugula and baby heirloom tomatoes. The burrata cheese was creamy and spreadable. The fig jam was a nice contrast. The linguini neri with seafood and lobster reduction surpassed our expectations in terms of flavor. The gnocchi with mushroom and chicken was so hearty and satisfying. I love anything in white sauce that is topped with Parmesan cheese.The Pope Pillow was a light dessert with puff pastry, glazed strawberries in mascarpone cheese. What an amazing dinner!

Very good service made it a wonderful dining experience to remember."], ["Malisa D.", "$14 corkage fee. Not too shabby;) Penne Melanzzane::: with eggplant and spicy tomato and mozzarella. This dish was good, but the eggplant was cut into rectangular pieces and sorta thinly sliced which I think made it a lil too tough for my liking. Orecchietti Bosco::: minced casa sausage, bread crumbs and aurora parsley sauce.. Would order again verse the penne melanzzane. The pasta looked like the little shells but that are rounded with a lil dip in the middle to capture the sauce. I really LOVED them lil guys! Anything with bread crumbs always makes a dish better! I remember the first time I had pasta with bread crumbs I literally died and went to heaven for a couple minutes. Cannoli::: I wanted the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but they were out. Then I wanted something else and they didn't have that dessert either... So I chose a cannoli which actually settled my sweet tooth craving. Having three pieces is a good option for sharing as well."], ["Mel L.", "Very good visit my first time here! My boyfriend has raved about this restaurant for months, but I go through \"phases\" with cuisines I'm into and haven't been into Italian for years. He saw the opportunity to take me here after our plans fell through on a Friday night.We started off with the walnut salad which was so fresh and tasty! Perfect little appetizer to give you a glimpse to how good the food is.We shared two entrees: the eggplant penne with spicy red sauce and the pesto gnocchi. There were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but since we don't eat meat, we thought it was detract too much from the dish if we ordered it without. the penne was amazing! The eggplant had a great smoky flavor and the red sauce had a nice kick to it. The pesto gnocchi was not what I was expecting. It was creamy, not the standard pesto that comes to mind. I also didn't think it was very flavorful.For dessert we ordered the Pope's pillow and the key lime creme brulee cheesecake. The cheesecake was to die for. It had that hard crystalized top and rich but not overwhelmingly sweet. The pope's pillow, while good, was very inconsistent with every bite you took. Some bites had this cream that other bites didn't, but the flaky crust was delicious.I would definitely come back and order other dishes.

They had the veil and it was horrible. Beaten to nothing. I had the $30 pork chops that were dry to the point I had to order more wine to wash it down. The only thing that tasted decent was the sea bass special and also the appetizers that we did order which was the burchetta but came with hardly any bread. I will not be recommending this place to any of our military families for date night worst $223.00 meal we ever had."], ["Pinto T.", "We love this place. Its Friday night, lucky there are seat available without reservation (next time we will call first) many people here that surprise us and it make us feel ohh..this should be a right choice.Me and my husband first visit here we impressed everything start with ambiance, server, especially food! We had calamari as appetizer (omg-so fresh squid. Its sweet crispy, we tasted and emmmmm..cant wait for next portions), the pesto pasta and pork chop as main course. The pork chop is the best as i ever taste its juicy and seasoned as chef special style cooking. Even we were so full but i really wanna try dessert then special lemon cheesecake is our choice -yes again its bomb. As a cheese cake lover i guaranteed this is bomb!We would say this is a best Italian dish we ever had. The sparkling juice was great too. For sure, we will come back again.

It's a good neighborhood spot, our server was super friendly and really made the experience memorable (as did the fun table of people next to us - we shared a laugh over the chalkboard sign taunting \"Cecil L. on Yelp\"), and the food was good. Not exceptional or 'as good as it gets', but good.They were very accommodating for a last minute reservation, and I appreciate that, especially as reservations cannot be made online.We had the burrata special and it was delicious. It had fresh figs and fig jam and it was really well balanced and tasty. A+ and 5 stars for that.Our entrees were good, but not spectacular or standout. I had the carbonara and it was good, but needed a bit more egg/'sauce'. It was also heavy handed with the prosciutto so it was on the salty side. I wasn't crazy about the Pope's Pillow. I know people go bonkers for it, but it wasn't for me. Pastry cream, glazed fruit, and pastry - it isn't something I'd normally go for but I tried it because of all the rave reviews. Ah well. If that's your thing you might enjoy it.I admit to being apprehensive because of the owner's aggressive comments to reviewers on Yelp, and then walking in and seeing the sign (though it did make us laugh) made me feel uneasy. When we made a joke about the sign to the server, \u00a0she seemed intimidated by him, and said that he is a bit of a character, and French - which was interesting, considering that he mentions his Mom in Italy, family recipes, and throws in Italian phrases in his comments. Who knows what the real deal is there. Something else that made me feel somewhat ill at ease was that someone - the chef or owner, I'm not sure - came out and greeted the two tables next to us, but totally ignored us. A little odd. I guess my point is that overall I didn't get a fully welcoming, relaxed vibe from this place.

As I finished up my meal, what came to my mind was balanced, a very well balance of flavors and textures.I stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening after a grueling day at work, so I was in the mood to pamper myself with some good food, and pampering is what this place provided. I started out with a nice glass of Barbera D'Asti, a slightly dry red and some of the complimentary table bread with a side of olive oil, balsamic vinegars mixture with a touch of honey (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026). The bread was beyond words I can describe, but I can describe the balsamic vinegar, a mixture made for those who love food. (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026)The Burrata Special was a very eye pleasing dish and had impressive layers of great flavors. (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026) Starting with the salty and nutty prosciutto, (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026) to the creamy soft burratta mildly flavored by its mozzarella and cream, to the seasoned baby cherry tomatoes drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and peppered with some crushed black pepper corns, and finally to the sweet fig jam all to be eaten together with a crunchy and chewy textured crostini, (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026) well this alone was to die for. I was not shy, and I ate the whole thing. Everything on this plate danced together in unison.For my main meal, I tried one of the nights dinner special: the Spinach Pappardelle with mushroom cream sauce blanket with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026) First of all the Pappardelle was perfectly prepared and arrived al dente and well flavored with the spinach from which it was created in house. (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026) The mushrooms were meaty but very tender with a superior flavor (yelp.com/biz_photos/enot\u2026), and the sauce that accompanied the mushrooms, was thick but creamy, and packed with a earthy mushroom flavor. Here too, all the ingredients loved to be together and they shined.Jessica, my server, was beyond exceptional. Being there a little over a year, her experience was well seasoned and it showed. Her timing was on point and knowledge of the menu and operations, was impressive.

We also ate the calamari caldi and proscuitto e melone for apps - both were eaten in seconds. We did have to ask for some of our drinks a few times, I personally asked for a beer twice before I got mine, but we had a huge group, so I won't fault them a star here.

Was amazing. She was very helpful with the menu, telling us which her fave dishes were. Not pushy at all & pretty funny so the night started off great!Ordered the calamari for an appetizer, very different from the usual crispy dishes. This was bathed in a tasty sauce with garbanzo beans and spinach I think it was.. yum! Main course (listing the dishes I tasted): Pappardelle Bolognese $16, Fettuccine Mare Monte $18 & Gnocchi Di Pollo $16. My favorite out of those 3 was the Fettucine. The sauce it came with was aamzing, so light and creamy. Plus the dish had mushrooms so that's a definite bonus! Mmm both the gnocchi and bolognese were equal in their goodness. The bolognese was cook to perfection. Not as heavy as the others I've tasted. Gnocchi came w/chicken and some veggies, excellent! Btw, order Pope's Pillow for dessert. It's basically strudel, which is always a good choice.Prices at this place is very reasonable.

We ordered a couple of seafood pastas plus some shrimp ravioli dishes. My mom and her friend were disappointed when the waitress came back to tell us that the squid ink pasta in the seafood special was sold out. But, all was not lost as they were given the option to choose any other pasta. The seafood was plentiful in the specials and I thought my shrimp ravioli was tasty and not lacking in the shrimp department. There were chunks of shrimp in the filling and there were some whole, plump shrimp to accompany the 5 large ravioli.

The smoked salmon is not overly salty, fresh, and delicious with arugula!Polenta con Salsiccia: the ragu is delicious, polenta is soft and serviced in slices.All the main and pasta dishes were beyond expectations. A caveat was that each dish could be overwhelming just by itself, so we almost shared with each other, to freshen up our palettes from these flavor-bursting dishes!1. Tortellini Panna e Prosciutto: I was battling ordering this one too, and it was pretty delicious especially with prosciutto! It is surprisingly not as heavy as I thought.2. Tortellini Pasticciati: delicious tortellini of pork and veal in a ragu type of sauce. So much flavors and umami taste. Unbelievable.3. Papadelle with mushroom and truffle oil: just scrumptious. Noodles are al dente, though I would have liked it a tad bit more al dente. The flavors are super savory and meaty without any sorts of meat! The flavors can be overwhelmingly rich.4. Brasato con Polenta: braised beef in wine reduction with polenta. There is so much sauce in this dish you could literally get more bread to finish it.Dessert: having saved room for this course, we ordered like royalty: 1, 2, and 6!Profiteroles alla Nutella: holy nutella!!! I didn't realize this was covered in nutella cream like the meringue in baked Alaska. The cream inside the profiterole and whipped cream was really great complements of the dessert. Truly unforgettable.Tiramisu: for the average American, this is probably not sweet enough. However, this was just perfect, the ladyfingers soaked in coffee really add more depth!Torta della Nonna: I didn't taste too much of lemon at all. The crust is flaky and delicious.

I really appreciate that very much as I suffer from insomnia and it would have been a disaster to get caffeine at 8:00pm.My real regret was that I didn't take advantage of their specials! They had a gnocchi dish that I almost ordered but for some silly reason, I talked myself out of it! I will try it next time. I enjoyed my pasta with sausage, a very basic dish but I love marinara sauce and their sauce was very well prepared and it paired nicely with their Montepulciano. \u00a0My husband had the pasta arriabata, he let me have a taste, the sauce was nice and spicy.

I am not a dessert person but oh man... this one was worth the calories. You will definitely need to split it, it's too much for one person! The only draw back I have to say is that it is similar to Piacere Mio in my neighborhood which has become so hyped that it is constantly packed out at dinner time. The noise level is deafening so not a place to have a romantic dinner. What made it worse for us is that there was a table full of loud mouth drunks sitting near us, they obviously were drinking before they got to Parma because I didn't see them being over served here. My husband and I basically didn't talk to each other because we could not hear what the other was saying. Most of the people there were couples of various generations trying to have an intimate dinner. \u00a0If you can deal with the noise, you will 100% love this place and give it five stars.

Like most restaurant desserts, the price ($8) was inflated, but it was really, really good.

Where the restaurant really shined, however, was through the impeccable service offered by its employees - who all seemed to be genuinely committed to delivering as outstanding of a customer service experience as possible. - To start things off, we ordered a Caprese di Burrata, which was delicate yet flavorful. The burrata itself was delicious & creamy, and the mildness of the dish was a welcome contrast to the bold flavors of our entree courses. I enjoyed the fact that diners are provided with their own balsamic vinegar, and you can thus play around with the flavors of the dish to suit your liking.- I ordered a Gnocchi with Ragu Sauce for my entree course. The portion size was reasonable (albeit not massive). The ragu sauce was well seasoned and had a good, balanced consistency; it wasn't overly soupy in texture and featured a nice blend of cooked-down tomatoes and ground meat. The gnocchi themselves were fluffy & fork-tender. All in all, a very solid entree. \u00a0- As I mentioned before - for as great as the food was, what really set Parma over the top for me was the degree to which the restaurant's servers went above and beyond in their efforts to put a smile on customers' faces. Case in point: my girlfriend and I had ordered a bottle of prosecco at $29, but were mistakenly quoted on our receipt as having ordered a higher-priced bottle ($35 or something like that). After having noticed this mistake on our receipt, I brought the matter to our server's attention. Without discussing the matter further, he brought back a new copy of our receipt, saying that we would find the newly adjusted price \"to our liking.\" He was right, and then some - our final bill was modified so that we were given a full bottle - for the price of a single glass! Needless to say, I happily strolled out of Parma with a grin on my face (and a bit more money left over in my wallet than what I had initially expected!). Moments like these are really and truly what make a restaurant stand out to me.(Moral of the story? It always pays to double-check your receipts.)If I ever find myself back in the area, I'll certainly be making a return trip to Parma. Its relaxed, romantic vibe, homey cuisine, and stellar service all earn high marks in my book."], ["Evelyn M.", "Parma is a fantastic Italian restaurant. It's absolutely delicious. I had the lasagna which was cooked perfectly and literally melted in my mouth. I seriously can't wait to go back! I also had a glass of wine and a capresse salad as an appetizer which was ammmmmmaaaazing. Would definitely recommend this Italian place. Workers are welcoming and friendly. The only downfall I would say is that the food takes a while to come out but believe me it's worth the wait. 5 stars!"], ["Chad H.", "I love Parma so much. \u00a0I really miss going there when I used to travel to San Diego all the time. \u00a0It was one of my go to spots. \u00a0This is definitely the best Italian restaurant in San Diego - I've tried a lot of them so I say that with confidence.The staff is really friendly and there's nothing better than sitting out on their patio during a nice evening and people watching while enjoying some amazing food. \u00a0My favorite is the veal tortellini - it's always cooked perfectly and just has an amazing flavor. \u00a0The buratta appetizer is also a favorite. \u00a0But really, everything we've had here is amazing. \u00a0You won't be disappointed."], ["Val T.", "Another good review for this place after been all round San Diego looking for good Italian food.

I feel like in Italy, plus funny atmosphere thanks to all team that some time arguing \u00a0each other......but what can I say? this place is alive and is alive thanks to all their staff. sometimes you go out and try new places to distract your mind and yourself, how boring life would be if it was all perfect.

I tried this place out for the first time this weekend with friends. It's as authentic Italian as it gets, complete with the Italian family managing it (all lovely people), and the Italian chef. To start, we had the cheese plate. It is without a doubt THE BEST cheese plate I've had. Such high-quality cheeses, with an amazing pairing with orange marmalade.Both my husband and I are vegetarians. He had the penne all'Arrabiata, and I had one of the daily specials, a truffle tortelloni.

What a great recommendation!My friend and I decided to split our entrees: the Tagliatelle al Ragu & Tortellini Panna e Prosciutto. The Tagliatelle was fresh and the ragu was pretty flavorful. The Tortellini was the standout by far, though. The pasta was so flavorful and tasty. The cream sauce with prosciutto was incredibly balanced between the creamy cheese and salty prosciutto. My other friend ordered the Tortelloni in Rosa and loved hers as well.Service was really friendly and intimate.

I wasn't in the mood to even try eating again. But this place caught me attention. The last time is seen this business , it was a coffee shop so I was very surprised to see it was transformed into an adorable Italian restaraunt. My friend and I were greeted as soon as we stepped over the lease line and asked to pick a table. I'm not sure if the waiter was speaking to us in Italian, or English, I just know I liked it. The waiter described and recommended items from the menu, then strongly recommended dinner selections and a wine pairing.I can't BELIEVE I ATE MUSHROOMS! You must try one of the house specials, Raviolo al porcini. I detest mushrooms and they are prevalent in this ravioli dish and I don't care.

As we were about to leave after waiting for 10 minutes (we didn't want to take the chance of waiting for an hour) the server came back and sat us down. Yay!! So I ordered Tortellini Panna e Prosciutto while my other half ordered lasagna. The server was friendly and you could tell she was trying to make our dining experience smooth, which I give her props for. My dish was good, not great but good. I kind of got sick of eating it once I got halfway done with it. It was a bit too salty for me. However, the lasagna was UH-MAZING. It was so soft and meaty. It was one of the best I've ever had.

This is absolutely our favorite restaurant in San Diego. \u00a0It's menu is diverse and generally reflects Northern Italian cuisine, which to me has a finer, more delicate flavor than traditional Italian fare. \u00a0The food is outstanding from beginning to end! \u00a0Loved the Insalada Mista and our son enjoyed their soup. \u00a0The tortellini stuffed with spinach and mushrooms is a sumptuous delight (this was a \u00a0\"special\" both times we have dined here). \u00a0The lasagna is just over-the-top exceptional. \u00a0We've never had lasagna this good. \u00a0The bechamel sauce was delectable!All that said, then comes the desserts! \u00a0We don't usually eat desserts in restaurants, but this is not the case here. \u00a0Having tried two of their desserts the first time, there is no way for us to come here without trying one of at least 2 incredible desserts. \u00a0Their traditional Tiramisu is the best I have ever had, including in Italy. \u00a0Then there is the Profiteroles alla Nutella, which ismascarpone cream filled puffs covered in a smooth Nutella cream sauce. \u00a0OMG! \u00a0This is just downright decadently wonderful. \u00a0My wife, who doesn't care for hazelnut flavoring, was duly impressed, and our son and I just swooned over it's extraordinary smooth and sublime flavoring.Our last outing here, we brought our best friends, and they also agreed it was an exceptional meal.Did you pick up on the fact that we just plain LOVE this restaurant!"], ["Taylor C.", "Best Italian food I've ever had in my life.

Will be back again."], ["Laura D.", "I wonder why it took me THIS long to discover this restaurant because it is amazing! I come to Hillcrest often and 5th ave is my street because of Buffalo Exchange, Urban Outfitters, and of course Landmark Theatre. I honestly would just walk past this place so much and now I feel so bad for doing that. I called to make a reservation and also to ask for the corkage fee. Corkage fee is $10 for those who are wondering which is not too bad considering that you can bring exactly what you want to drink. Once we arrived we were immediately greeted by our lovely server. He was so incredibly warm and definitely very Italian down to the thick accent. My dad had a tough time understanding him at times but thankfully my time in Italian 101 paid off. We started with the antipasto of course which had a lot of cheese and meat- two of my favorite things. We had the Burrata Fiore do Parma which had burrata cheese, prosciutto, and ruccola with a balsamic glaze. In case you don't know about burrata it's a cheese comprised of mozzarella and cream. The consistency is creamy but it tastes like mozzarella. The other cured meat antipasto we had was I think one of the specials of the day. It has Parmesan, ruccola, and a drier and saltier cured meat. Both antipasto dishes were delicious and yes, there was plenty of bread for us to fully enjoy the meat and cheese. I would like to point out that we ate the American way, not the Italian way so the primi piatti (first dish) was the only one I had. I didn't follow the pasta with chicken or beef. I ordered the tortellini panna e prosciutto because I obviously did not have enough of it for one night. The veal tortellini were delicious! The sauce was nice and creamy. Surprisingly this dish wasn't too salty even though it had the prosciutto. All in all it was a win for me! And of course there had to be desert. As someone who spent a lot of their time in Paris eating gelato I think I can comment on good gelato. I ordered the pistachio gelato and the server assured me it's good. You gotta trust the Italian right? I liked it a lot but it just wasn't the same thing I would get at Amorino. Overall the service was amazing and the food was even better. If you're in the area come check it out. It's a small and new restaurant just waiting to be discovered by San Diegans. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!

Still a paying customer here. Anyway...the first time I ordered the pasta with sausage and that was good and I loved it, no complaints. Then the second time I decided to try their chicken marsala. It was the worst marsala ever. It had no seasoning, no flavor, the chicken was literally yellow (like no marks that they cooked it), it was the most bland chicken I ever tasted. And there was no sauce! Doesn't chicken marsala usually have a brown sauce with mushrooms? Isn't that the \"marsala\" sauce? This had nothing but the chicken breast! And a few veggies. They might as well call is \"chicken\". But seriously, no sauce on this dry, nasty, bland chicken! I was so disappointing, I added salt and pepper and poured my BF's gnocchi sauce on it. The only sauce I saw was the overwhelming olive oil at the bottom. My BF didn't like his gnocchi either, it was too oily. We tilted the to go box and half of the gnocchi's box was in oil. I really did like this place when they first opened...now I really don't know why this place has 4.5 stars. Maybe it was an off day? Maybe they were punishing us for getting it to go?

I moved on to Spallotto di Maiale ai Funghi Porcini, slow roasted pork shoulder with porcini mushrooms in a creamy white sauce served with mix steamed vegetable. \u00a0Perfect for my low carb diet! \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0My wife choose the mixed salad ( simple and.good with a Balsamic glaze) and Tagliatelle al Ragu, egg noodle pasta with homemade meat ragu. \u00a0A lgre helping. She cancelled her second entre and still brought some home. \u00a0The restaurant is located in the Hillcrest area of San Diego - a neighborhood that reminds me of the Castro in San Francisco. \u00a0Lots of funky shopping choices. \u00a0We browsed a large used book store after dinner on the same block as Parma.,"], ["Yvonne C.", "You will fall in love with the little Restaurant and the wonderful staff and owners. \u00a0This will be a place you will come back to over and over again and leave with a great dining experience. Pretty much when you walk in it's like getting a big hug. \u00a0The food and wine is amazing and legit. \u00a0 Try the Prosciutto app with the cheese....Wow! \u00a0Last time I visited it was late and they were closing but when they saw us at the door Christina (Server) rushed over and said No...please come in. \u00a0 \u00a0The woman that owns the place (she's so adorable) came over and greeted us with a warm heart and smile. Say Hi to me if you see me there =)"], ["J\u00f6HnNy A.", "Oh Fabrizio! And the spinach ravioli with porcini mushroom Alfredo sauce special. Heaven! Love this place!!!!!"], ["Josh H.", "Been here at least a dozen times. Regarding the very few bad reviews here, nothing at Parma is bland nor is it presented as looking like cafeteria food. Their pasta dishes are always spectacular as are the sauces. Get the special ravioli in white sauce with porcini mushrooms and you'll be so happy you did."], ["Anthony P.", "They had me at \"prego\". The use of that word was the first sign that this was going to be a true italian experience. This is as official, authentic and delicious as it gets without actually purchasing a flight to Italy. Very few italian places are able to help take me back to my time at Campo Di Fiori in Rome, Italy with just the taste of food. I can tell you this restaurant EASILY compares to any of the amazing restaurants that we ate in Rome. The burrata plate with prosciutto was amazing and very fresh.The Tortellini filled with Spinach Ricotta and porcini cream sauce - to die for. (see pic)The pasta with WHITE TRUFFLE porcini sauce - heavenly. (see pic)The two wines we enjoyed were the Chianti and the Sta. Christina - excellent pairings.The tiramisu was one of the best i've ever had in any restaurant (even in Europe).Everything tasted home-made, fresh, crafted with care and love. Perfectly cooked and sauced. Very quaint and relaxing experience. Customer service was top notch. I could go on, but long story short - it is currently my new favorite italian restaurant in San Diego."], ["Justin A.", "I came to Parma last night after craving some authentic Italian food. Parma is a nice, small space that feels like your stepping into a families kitchen in Italy.The menu isn't huge, but actually well put together - Parma has a dish for everyone's palate. They focus on quality not quantity here.We started with the burrata y prosciotto appetizer. This was very good. My girlfriend had the arrabiata pasta and I had the meatball special. Both plates were really good and you could tell the ingredients were fresh.The portions aren't huge, but just the right amount to leave feeling full, but not overly stuffed. I will be back soon!"], ["Unknown A.", "I love this place! I've eaten here several times; in parties of 6-8 and just my wife and I. Every time the service has been spot on, and the food delicious.The owners hail from Italy and know exactly what fresh, authentic Italian food is and how to make it. We will continue to make this our go-to Italian restaurant in San Diego!"], ["John D.", "Everything about this place feels both authentic and quaint. My girlfriend and I were able to sit on the street and enjoy the ambiance of the hip little street-side tableau as well as the smells and noise emanating from this incredibly cool little Italian restaurant. The wait staff were incredibly nice (and their accents added nicely to the the flair of the place) and helpful, the food was hands down delicious and the prices were incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the experience. I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody."], ["J K.", "Decent food, and friendly service from the older employees. The younger employee was awkward and made me feel uncomfortable. Good portion, came out very fast (which makes me question the preparation), and fair prices. Probably won't be back due to the rough parking situation and much better places elsewhere. I don't fully regret my visit, but as I sit here I'm reading Nietzsche. We don't need Freud for this one. wut"], ["Shaun P.", "The staff are Italian and there is a traditional feel to the place with a modern decor. The service was slow and the restaurant wasn't half full. The food was mediocre-- I had the gnocchi, which was on special. The menu is limited, which has pros and cons. Compared to LA, this would be two stars. Not a great find."], ["Sophia C.", "This place is really cute n the staffs r really friendly. Their foods r just amazing \u00a0I got their special Alfredo w salmon n it was delicious. Our server is really nice. We didn't make reservation but we were able to get a table within 10 mins \u00a0if u r craving for Italian foods, I recommend this place."], ["Csilla L.", "My husband and I enjoyed a date night at Parma a couple weeks ago, and he says now that Parma is his favorite Italian food restaurant. Their red sauce reminds me of meals I enjoyed in Italy, and the appetizer cheese plate was delicious with a lovely presentation. The ambiance of Parma is adorable, with comfortable seating and nice adornments. We both highly recommend Parma."], ["Beke L.", "Food was fantastic! Authentic Tuscan-Style dishes. \u00a0The staff was so friendly and accommodating. \u00a0The only complaint was the temperature in the restaurant...but it was a hot night."], ["Lunetta P.", "I love this authentic Italian ristorante. The owners are straight from Italy and are genuine! \u00a0Their pasta is some of the best I've had and I've been to Italy 4x from Milano all the way down to Sicilia. Mi piace!"], ["Randy S.", "I love the fettuccine prosciutto and mushroom in white sauce. They're also dog friendly on the patio...."], ["Susan D.", "I called Parma to make same day (Sat) reservations for my B'day. I asked for a special table and ended up with a cute corner couch setting for my party of 3.The service was attentive, the wine was superb and the food was phenomenal!I was even surprised with a lit candle bowl of chocolate gelato for the celebration. Parma is a quaint, special restaurant that I plan to put at the top of my list for any night that I am looking for a great Italian experience."]]}
