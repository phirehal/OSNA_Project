There's a juice shop add-on where the soda fountains were. I actually tried to come back sooner but they were closed for Ramadan. So after looking over the menu, I was set on trying some different things that caught my eye. This is what I had... chicken shwarma, chai tea hot, basboosa, and a napolean to go. I had a yelp deal and that stuff came to $20... just over it with tax.Here's why I'm giving 3 stars again. I learned my lesson from the last time, but they didn't. The service was awkward. I said that I wanted a shwarma and just like before I wasn't asked what I wanted on it. I also said that I wanted some desserts so I walked over to the other side. The woman just stayed at the register. I had to flag her down and wave for her to come over. After I chose what I wanted and paid up. I watched the guy making the food (he was stellar) and again I noticed all of the vegetables. So I asked him what comes on the shwarma. He told me and I told him what I wanted... instead. Done deal. I went outside to grab a table. My shwarma came out, but my tea didn't. I had to go back in and ask for my tea. She flat out forgot.The shwarma itself was pretty good. It was my first time trying it. It looked a bit different than what I had seen elsewhere, but it's not a big deal. I definitely want to try some other varieties. The basboosa (semolina cake?) was good... thick and syrupy. It had an interesting texture... a lot like cornmeal. The tea was alright, but I thought it was a bit over priced for the small cup. But I do know chai costs a bit more. Now for the napolean... I waited maybe an hour and half to eat it. And the top layer was so hard it bent up my plastic fork. I had to really let it sit in my hot kitchen for a couple of hours for it to soften up. When it finally did I really liked it, but it was mushed up from earlier. Did they give it to me frozen? What if I wanted to eat it right away?Also, there were indeed paper towels in the bathroom this time. Other than that, a couple brought their dogs to the outdoor patio. I didn't appreciate that at all. Period. Not to mention some woman parked her double baby stroller in front of the patio doors and walked away. On the plus side, there was a shift change while I was eating so when I returned my dishes the new cashier was MUCH friendlier and much less awkward."], ["Nacer M.", "Was there last week the waiter and cashier were cool ..all by a sudden some asshole shows up staring at us and said we close at 9.30..guess what he was the owner of the store ..it would've been better if he said get the fuck outta here...left everything on the table and left ....noooooo more"], ["Rob Y.", "For the past two years, I've always made a visit to Manakeesh whenever I was in town.Food (8.5/10) = I've been quite habitual with Manakeesh, ordering the the Tawook (marinated chicken) flat bread + iced coffee every visit. \u00a0If a killer combo works, why change it?

I was very excited about Manakeesh when it first opened, and I was truly thrilled about the pastries. I tried other food as well bit the greasy flatbread sandwiches gave me indigestion. So I stuck with the pastries and hummus + pita.Receipts at Manakeesh are not itemized and I always felt slightly confused how I ended up dropping $15 on cookies. But I gave the cashier (usually the same guy) the benefit of the doubt... until it became all too clear he has no qualms about lying.The last time I was at Manakeesh, I ordered my usual small hummus, and the guy who's usually at the counter asked if I wanted a large portion at no extra cost. Regular customer appreciation, I thought! So I took it. It came in a takeout plate even though I was eating in. The olive oil on top had congealed and the hummus had a stale crust. That meal was long past the hour when it was due to turn into a pumpkin.--------Added in edit: I appreciate the owner's reply. It may be comforting to some that they would have gladly replaced the hummus. However, being \"kindly offered\" a large portion for the price of a small only to discover that the establishment was using you as a vehicle to get rid of its leftovers is just too much of a slap on the face.

You walk in and think you're in a middle eastern joint, but they also have a fully stocked smoothie bar. They have teas, desserts, food, hummus, who knows what else, either way, you are pretty much guaranteed to find something you like, especially when despite a menu that's all over the place, the food is consistently great.I had a couple of small dessert items (more like 10 probably) and some sort of special tea, I forget what it was called, but everything was super sweet and fresh, but didn't taste like just pure sugar.

My biggest problem with this place was the menu. It is overly sparse, with just a name for each item (typed in Comic Sans font) and no description at all. I imagine we could have asked the waitress for details, but I didn't want to make her describe every item, so we just picked a couple. My favorite thing about this restaurant was the pita and bread basket that came out with some homemade pesto before the meal. Between the four of us, we split the sampler plate, the lamb plate, the scallops, and shrimp scampi. The baba on the sampler plate was probably my favorite part of the meal, and the hummus was good too, though the lentils were a bit bland. The beets and olives were both okay, but those aren't my favorite anyways. The lamb plate came with some grilled onions and peppers, and it was quite good, but not worth the $17 price tag.

I really had a great time.I love herbs but was a little nervous that everything would be entirely over seasoned, I was pleasantly surprised because each plate was deliccious and I even find myself craving it here and there. This was my first experience with Moroccan food so I had no idea what to expect. My favorite was the baked chicken with the spicy sauce which we ordered on the side just to be safe. Also, the baklava was what dreams are made of. Overall, the food, service, and experience were amazing and super fun. I think this would make an amazing first date.

After placing our order, the food kept flowing. The service was probably the most unobtrusive service I've ever had. As one dish was placed in front of us, another was seamlessly removed. I felt like royalty or at least someone enjoying a nice meal at someone's dinner party. The regular dining formalities I'm used to were thrown out the window, and it was fantastic! As I'm sure you're aware, this $25 prix fixe menu has seven courses and you are welcome to BYOB.

Here's a little rundown of dining experience:Course 1: Three-Salad Platter- The eggplant is phenomenal (and messy). Luckily you have some assistance from the pita to eat it. The cucumbers and bell peppers and carrots and cucumber were good, but the eggplant stole the show. Course 2: The B'stella- As someone who doesn't normally love sweets but loves cinnamon, carbs and meat, this dish was a winner. This dish was dough filled with chicken, nuts, almonds, egg, peppers and onions. It was really hot at first, but once you cracked open the shell and let it cool down, it was easier to eat. I had some pita saved from the first course, so I found it easy to break off a piece and rest it on the pita while it cooled down. Truly a sweet-savory delight. Course 3: Chicken- So here's where the choices began. You can either get chicken with lemon or spicy chicken. My group opted to get the spicy chicken with the cumin sauce on the side. The chicken was melt in your hands and then melt in your mouth good. The spicy sauce had a nice kick without being overly spicy to me. I still had some pita leftover so I did a little dipping with the sauce. Course 4: Beef or Lamb- My table got a little creative here and asked for half portions of both the beef and lamb. The beef was served shish kebab style, and to be honest, not my favorite. It was a little well done, and I struggled a little to get it off the stick resulting in a pepper flying into my husband's wine glass. Sauvignon blanc tastes best with a little pepper anyways, right? The lamb was perfect. Even the non-lamb eaters thought it was delicious. It was tender and took on the flavor of the chick peas and onions without having an overwhelming lamb flavor. Course 5: Couscous with veggies, chick peas and raisins- This was probably my least favorite dish from the main meal. It was a little blander than other couscous dishes I've tried in the past. I would have been disappointed if this was the only thing I ordered, but everything was a hit thus far in the evening. They did give us spoons at this point, so don't worry about eating the little grains with your hands.Courses 6 & 7: Dessert- I'm assuming the tea, fruit and pastries count as the sixth and seventh courses. At this point in the evening, my bottle of wine had been consumed and I wasn't counting the dishes, and am making this assumption while referencing the menu. I'm not a tea fan so I passed. The pastries were little crisp triangles that reminded me of baklava. The fruit came out frozen was a little hard to eat. I nibbled on a strawberry and took a banana for the road since the majority of the group passed on the fruit. Perhaps the fruit was customary, but I thought a little unnecessary. If it's part of the traditional meal then no harm, no foul. \u00a0To sum it up, I had delicious food and hours of fun. It's an experience not to be missed in Philadelphia, especially if you go with an adventurous group of friends. While I couldn't imagine going to Marrakesh every Friday night, I can definitely pick a handful of occasions that would be a perfect fit."], ["Kathleen D.", "The whole idea of this place slightly terrified me ahead of Sari's UYE last weekend. For the most part, I'm incredibly picky and also have the tendency to eat veeeeery slowly. Sharing a plate with a bunch of people? Would I get my money's worth?Well, yeah. And more. This was an amazing meal! I even liked the eggplant...for the first time!By the end of the night (shout-out to the lemon chicken and beef skewers and BYO wine and umm everything else), I was beyond stuffed and happy.Thanks, Sari, for putting this Yelpy night together, and thanks to the Marrakesh team for being so hospitable to our group! I'll definitely make it back to this great spot at some point in the future."], ["Gerald S.", "I am normally not a fan of prix-fix menus, as they tend to be too limiting of choice, and suggests a kitchen unable to handle more options. \u00a0But, when that standard menu comes in 7 courses with additional vegetarian alternatives, and is packed into a Bedouin's tent of a restaurant, complete with belly dancing, baklava and honey tea, I can make an exception. \u00a0This is multiplied many fold when your 40 closest friends are packed into a carpet clad room with barely enough room to sit down, and an ambient noise level loud enough to make talking to anyone but those right next to you impossible. Yet, with enough wine and North African music to alter consciousness, this becomes an all-consuming environment that transports you out of South Street and into the dark, mystic souk casbah of one of the ancient cities of Morocco. Marrakesh takes finger food to the ultimate. \u00a0From cool salads, to roast chicken, cumin lamb and grilled beef, cous-cous with veggies, the only thing between your fingers and the searing meal is the thin pita used to pinch, lift and stuff in your face. \u00a0Failing that, be prepared for first degree burns. \u00a0The large metal serving trays kept coming with more food. \u00a0We all appreciated the concession to the use of towels to cover laps and wipe hands. Some of the braver souls accompanied our graceful dancer as she gyrated her hips, abdomen, shoulders and arms with cymbals ringing. Some of our folks really knew how to move. \u00a0Impressive.Stepping back out onto Leithgow Alley after 4 hours within this transporter, it took a few moments to reorient myself to being back in Philadelphia after our wild ride.Marrakesh is not just a restaurant, it is a magic carpet."], ["Dana S.", "Food: The food was amazing. I went with a party of 5 which seemed to be a great size for this dining experience and everyone of us loved the food. We were all first timers at Marrakesh and we also had never tried Moroccan food and we were all pleasantly surprised by how tasty the food was. Standout dishes: the salad (omg so good). The chicken. You can order the chicken mild or spicy or get the spicy sauce on the side. It was amazing and tender. The kabob. We tried lamb and beef which were both very flavorful. The lamb was literally falling off the bone. I highly recommend the lamb. Fresh fruit at the end. Who doesn't love fresh fruit? \u00a0You get a total of 7 courses so pace yourself.Ambience: The restaurant is very intimate. It feels very exclusive especially because of the location. It's technically a street but it feels like an alley way. I've literally walked by this street maybe 200 times and never thought anything of it. They have (I'm guessing Moroccan) music playing which is very ear friendly. The design of the place alone is enough to make you want to go back. It's beautiful. This place makes you feel like you're right in Morocco.Service: The people who worked there were so pleasant and hospitable. Great service.They are byob so take your choice of beverage and you will surely enjoy yourself. The price is $30-35 /person"], ["Komal D.", "This place has it all. Fantastic experience, food, atmosphere, and service... and its BYOB too! Located in an ally, you really have to know where you're going. You must knock on the door (i felt so VIP) and then they'll welcome you in. Once you're inside, the place opens up. It felt like I was in Marrakesh - low tables, couches, pillows, and beautiful decor. Someone [the owner maybe?] explained the courses to us and even adjusted the menu because we weren't eating red meat. You start with washing your hands, and then they give you a towel to use throughout the meal. FYI: you eat with your hands, don't ask for utensils. 1. Started with veggies and pita. There are three kinds [eggplant, cucumber, and carrot] and they all taste so good and so different. 2.Flaky pastry covered in powdered sugar and stuffed with chicken and egg. This plate came out piping hot, so it took a while for us to dig in. It was a nice mix of sweet and savory. 3. Spicy chicken.. dare i say it?? BEST CHICKEN IN THE CITY. Its fall off the bone, tender, packed with flavor and spices goodness. I could have jussst had the finger lickin good chicken for my meal. 4. Hummus - this was the replacement for the lamb/beef kabobs. It tasted like authentic hummus. None of sugar and random flavors. Simple and delicious. 5. Cous Cous - I'm not a fan of cous cous, so I can't really give an good review for this dish. sorry!6/7 Baklava, Fruit, and tea. - Baklava was a 5/5, i dont think there is any place in the city that has something that even taste close. The fruit was a little bruised, so we didn't go for that. And the tea was hot, sweet, and a perfect way to end the meal. Rose water: simple, sweet, delicious drink. Very Moroccan. \u00a0A nice way to clear the palate in between dishes. To sum it up.. try everything because its good. Pace yourself, relax... its A LOT of food. and most importantly, enjoy the experience!"], ["Bill M.", "Five stars for what was probably the best UYE ever (and I say that as a former host of many!)! But in a lot of ways I could also give five stars for Marrakesh being one of the most unique and sightly secretive dining experiences in all of Philly.I've long heard the legacy of what it had to offer, and was ecstatic the moment that I heard that Sari had it potentially lined up as a UYE Destination. And it didn't hurt and most assuredly confirmed that i'd be going when I heard that my friend Anastasia was to be the belly dancer for the evening.When I arrived I somehow discovered a new part of a Philly area that I've been familiar with for decades, and almost couldn't even figure out how to get through the front door. Yet when I did and shuffled my way up the stairs, not only did I come across a plentiful room filled to the brim with Yelpers, I came across the West Philadelphia Orchestra getting ready to play a party across the hall. Marrakesh is just one of those places!For $25 plus tax & tip we all had our hands washed in rose water, were handed sufficient towels per Hitchhikers right; and were served some five plus courses of succulent chicken served as both spicy whole and baked into filo dough, savory lamb, hummus, many salads, delicious injera that served as our forks, and then some. While I've had better in similar packages, it was delivered in a tasty and extravagant fare that made it something to be experienced. And they also made sure that the vegetarians and vegans of tour group were presented with an equal amount of courses.It could be the fact that we were a party of 25+, but the one slight flaw was that the room layout did feel like things would be cramped even if we weren't that large of a party. But it could have also just been the fact that my friend was delivering a tremendous dancing performance and calling for people to learn, and many people were calling my name to join in, I could hardly move because I was trapped in the lavish corner. If you plan on or expect to dance be prepared to sit toward the end of one of the tables, and get ready to savor what might be the best interactive dining experience that you can get in Philly."], ["Nick V.", "Gimmicky, not clean ... your feet stick to the floor. Over crowded ... Fire Hazard, where is the Board of Health/ Philly Food and Safety Inspectors to force this place to upgrade some things ? Food is mediocre. \u00a0Where are we in the US or a third world country."], ["Natalie K.", "I thought this place was a lot of fun! Another BYO gem in Philadelphia. I went with a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday and I will say what makes the meal is the experience that goes along with it. FOODThe meal is something like 9 courses (it's possible I lost count somewhere along the way) and they have vegetarian options to substitute for each course. I thought the food was pretty good, although I could have just eaten the first course of hummus and dips the entire night and been extremely happy! There was a great fruit platter right before dessert, which was baklava (YUM)! Truth be told, I preferred the vegetarian options! I thought the whole meal was really well priced - $40 for the meal+tip and we were stuffed at the end!EXPERIENCEThis place is well decorated to make you feel like you've been transported to a different place. The walls and ceilings are covered in fabrics that made me feel like I was at someone's home enjoying a delicious meal. The seating is kind of low to the ground, which is comfortable and find. The restaurant itself appears to be an old fire house converted into a restaurant as there was a pole on one floor and the dining area was broken up into separate rooms without doors. It was nice though because it made the experience a little more intimate. They have belly dancers that go throughout the restaurant and dance with each table - I thought that was a great touch!TIPSThere are two seating times and you will definitely need a reservation! Make sure you plan your visit here in advance, especially if you have a large party. Leithgow St can be difficult for cabs and ubers alike to find so have them drop you off at South and 4th and walk down South towards 5th - there's an alley on the right hand side of the street and that's Leithgow. Walk down it and the entrance is on your right."], ["Huamei Y.", "Came here for a friend's birthday celebration a few months ago. I felt like I stepped into a different world. Every room was decorated head to toe with beautiful rugs and fabrics. It was kind of dark but it set a mystical ambiance.The waiters came around with jugs of water for us to wash our hands with. There was an intricate 7-9 courses (couldn't keep track after a while). My favorites were the chicken, which was SO juicy and spicy, the lamb, slightly sweet and incredibly tender, and the pickled vegetables, can't get enough of it all!Did I mention the bread??We also had a belly dancer come in and dance for a segment. Overall an unforgettable experience that I couldn't believe I was in Philadelphia on south street. I hope to experience the real Morocco one day :)"], ["Elizabeth H.", "After frequenting various Moroccan food places for the past two decades, I've come to the conclusion that no place will ever be as good as the old Alkimah on Route 70 in Cherry Hill. \u00a0That fact aside (tearful emoji), Marrakesh is pretty on point! \u00a0The ambiance is appropriate, the meats are flavorful and fall off the bone, and salads are savory and delicious, and the baklava is dripping in honey. \u00a0The couscous course needs salt, especially after all the fully flavored previous courses, and the B'Stella is not the best I've had -- but its hard to hate on chicken, egg, and powdered sugar in phyllo in general. \u00a0The pita is usually veering towards stale. \u00a0The best part of this place besides the salad and meat courses is the experience factor. \u00a0If you haven't experienced floor pillow/rug sitting and eating somewhat exotic spice combinations with your hands, you should."], ["Charlene U.", "I've been to Marrakesh twice, and both times I left stuffed. \u00a0This place is a very social experience since you are sharing plates and eating everything with your hands. \u00a0The tables are also very close together. \u00a0It's fun to come here with a small group. \u00a0From knocking on the ornate door on one of South Street's side streets to the dark and cozy ambiance, the place has an air of mystery about it. \u00a0The servers were very friendly both times I was here. \u00a0If you are intimidated by having to eat seven courses, you can have your leftovers wrapped up. \u00a0My favorites were the eggplant salad on pita at the beginning, the spicy cumin chicken, and the tea at the end.While I do agree that cash only is a pain, the food and dining experience is worth making sure to hit up an ATM on your way. \u00a0Don't forget to pick up a bottle of wine as well, since it's BYOB. \u00a0If you have any friends coming from out of town, this is a nice place to take them on a weekend for dinner when the belly dancer is there."], ["Paul C.", "It was a cryptic and memorable Friday night (in early April).Walking down (dark and shady) Gaskill Street on my way to Marrakesh, I already felt as if I had been transported to sequestered residential alleyway in a Moroccan town. I kept looking back after we turned the corner because I literally thought that someone was following my friend and I. At last, we spotted the green Marrakesh awning and spotted some men chatting while grilling meats under the bright outdoor light. They instructed us to use the side entrance on Leithgow.We knocked on the door twice. A few seconds later, somebody opened the door asking if we had a reservation. \"No,\" I said. He let us in anyway.We were seated immediately (because this place is TINY). Then, we realized two things: 1) that this place was cash only (which is always a huge turn-off), 2) that the only dinner option was a 7-course menu. We deliberated for a few seconds, and decided that we would stay for the adventure. I'm glad we did. My friend ran to the nearest ATM to get some cash. Meanwhile, I had already started digging into the first course before he returned. We still joke that we think we were already 50% full after just the first course. There's unlimited pita bread (throughout your meal, not just the first course; they actually encourage you to take a handful each time) and massive servings of very filling eggplant, mint/carrot and cucumber side dishes. I think the second dish was the olive chicken dish, which was so amazingly tender and well-flavored. If I recall correctly, that's the only course where you had the option to choose between two dishes.A few minutes pass. Everything is kind of hazy in my mind after the second dish because we both gradually slipped into a massive and serious food coma. We literally just slouched there and thought \"OMG... how much more do we have to eat. My stomach is literally about to explode.\" It's not like we could take it to-go. There was even a belly dancing performance somewhere in between. Desserts came and we breathed a sigh of relief.Everything tasted really good. I've never had Moroccan food before this, but I get a feeling that everything tasted relatively authentic. Some of the textures and tastes are a little bizarre for the American palate (like the scrambled-egg like dessert). Nonetheless, it tasted good and that's all that really matters.Here's some things to know before you come:- It's cash-only. There's an ATM at the restaurant, but, of course, you never want to fall for that trap.- Come with more than one other person! I saw two other groups that were just two people, but trust me, you will start to feel uncomfortable by the third or fourth course and it's not a pleasant feeling. And definitely don't come here alone. I would say 3-5 people is a good party size.- Be prepared to eat with your hands. Utensils are not the norm here.- The ambiance is wonderful. It's like a little piece of Morocco that made its way to Philadelphia. With that said, it can get kind of boisterous. - Service is great.- Generally quite affordable. My friend and I ate like pigs and we still paid like $30 each. They also pre-calculate the gratuity for you, I think, so you just pay the amount that's on the check."], ["Jennifer M.", "I've done the Morroccan experience before, so I knew what to expect. Our group of 8 really enjoyed our time here, especially since we had some first-timers. We came well stocked with wines and beers to supplement a multiple course dinner!After covering ourselves in towels and washing our hands, it was time to get down to business. Towels were great since eating with your hands is not an easy feat, at least not for me. Course after course, we indulged and explored new and interesting tastes. We all raved about the first 3-salad course of eggplant, carrot, and cucumbers. Don't hold back on the pita. Grab 3 or 4 because you'll need them to help grab the veggies! The second course of B'stella was great! By looking at the towels around me, this was the messiest dish. The third course of spicy chicken literally fell off the bone, and was very flavorful. It came out super hot, so the pitas that came around helped. For our fourth course, we chose the lamb with almonds and honey over the beef. The lamb did not disappoint, and the honey definitely added just the right amount of sweetness. By this time, all of us were stuffed, yet we had two more courses! The couscous was probably our least favorite since it had to follow some strong dishes. Thankfully, the fruit and delicious mint tea helped slow things down. Baklava was also a nice treat, thought it wasn't anything to write home about.Overall, I'd recommend this place. For date nights, group dinners, and large celebrations. Since it was such a large feast, perhaps slowing down the pace will help! Service was friendly, and since we were there during the weekend, we did get to see a few belly dancers pass through.

Beautifully ornate rugs, padded chairs, colorful wall hangings, sweet shisha smoke hanging in the air, delicious smells wafting from the kitchen, and a hip, diverse crowd in deep states of chillness and relaxation. It is an unpretentious, thoroughly warm and welcoming oasis from the madness of Old City.I had two great friends visiting me in Philly for a weekend. After a nice day of walking around the city and checking out the M\u00fctter Museum, we decided to take a breather with a movie at the Ritz and then have a late dinner. Around 6:45, I called Ariana to ask if they took reservations. They did! And yes, they could seat the three of us at 9pm on a Saturday. Score!It was an easy walk from Ritz at the Bourse. We walked in and were welcomed by a lovely, smiling woman who, it turned out, would also be our waitress for the evening. Our table was spacious and comfortable (those padded, upholstered chairs!) and we could tell right away this would be a great place to while away the evening.One of my friends had the pulao with chicken, which turned out to be this intoxicating blend of sweet, acidic, proteiny and savory. It was excellent. My other friend had a chicken kabob and was very happy with that. I had a dish of split-pea daal topped with lamb stew. It was incredible, and the quality of the lamb was top-notch. Oh, I almost forget that we also split several appetizers, different varieties of dumplings, and those were extremely good, as well. My favorite was filled with fresh chives.Afterwards, we smoked a hookah. The hookah pipes are attractive and clean, and there was a ton of shisha in there. We ordered a second coal but we finally had to end up leaving unsmoked shisha because we were all starting to feel a little light-headed! The shisha was good-quality and delicious. I should also say that the air had the light smell of sweet smoke, just enough to be atmospheric and pleasant, but Ariana's must have a very good ventilation system because even with a hookah on practically every table, it was never oppressively smoky or remotely close.The crowd was great. It was diverse--mostly Black and Brown with a few White people--and very chill and friendly. Everyone was happy and having a good time. Ariana is BYOB, so some people brought wine. One table made the power move of bringing a bottle of Jameson along!When we finally left, our waitress smiled broadly and wished us a good night and told us to come back some time. The service was friendly and warm, from beginning to end.The next day, my friends were still raving about Ariana, so this is definitely a keeper for entertaining out-of-town guests.

My friend and I were not hungry, so we ordered a handful of appetizers. I started with the Aash-e-dal (lentil stew/soup). It had a nice texture, but very little in the way of spice, and wasn't served nearly hot enough. I had to add salt, which is something I almost never do at restaurants, so that started off on a bad foot. I also had the Bulanee Gandana (scallion turnover). The menu says \"stuffed\" with ingredients, but a better description would be \"slightly including.\" I'm not big on scallions, but there was hardly any scallion taste - or any taste at all. I smothered my pastries in yogurt, which was thankfully hard to mess up.Finally, dessert. I ordered the firnee (Afghan pudding) on advice of the waiter. It was supposed to have \"ground pistachios, almonds, and rosewater.\" There were two slivers of almond and about half a pistachio of grindings on top, and that was it. There were a few lumps in the pudding, which had the consistency of very firm Jello. It was sweet, and tasty for that reason, but hardly something I imagine as authentic and definitely did not live up to the billing.It's not a horrible 1-star type of place, but definitely not worth revisiting.

No complaints about the dish, but it was like $12 for a little bowl of cooked shrimp in sauce. Also got chicken, lamb and beef kabobs, along with some grilled veggies. I was really looking forward to some kabobs and these were a bummer. They were all very overcooked. I can see the chicken being cooked well, but grilling beef and lamb until it is black, hard and dry is definitely not what I'd expect from a restaurant. We ate it, but it certainly wasn't enjoyable. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing here, I don't know.

All items on my salad had a lot of spice, a lot of pow. I think I'd like to have a piece of bread or something to go with this salad next time, to calm down my palate.I can't wait to return.

This was so good, so fresh, and a much healthier option than other eateries nearby.With the popularity of this type of style restaurant (fast, choose-your-own-adventure-type meal), the place gets busy around lunch time.

Their menu is all organic, locally sourced, gluten free and prepared on site. It's a build your own creation type place, starting with your choice of wrap, rice or spinach (I chose spinach - fresh and crisp). Next, you choose your main topping. I got grilled veggies, but I'm itching to try the falafel or steak next. Up after that is the 3 sides...so many delicious options to pick from here. I chose white beans with spinach and parmesan, a tabouli salad and the roasted cauliflower. My darling friend let me try her carrots (yum) and beet salad (omg). Last, you select a sauce (or two!) to top it all off (or for dipping on the side). I got the lemon tahini, and it was the perfect complement to my veggies and sides. My lunch at Agno rang in at just over $8 for a healthy, tasty, unique meal that I can feel great about eating - for my tastebuds, my body AND the world. I haven't tried their older sister restaurant, Pure Fare, yet, but I applaud what these folks are doing. Bonus: they deliver down to 4th and up to 24th (from Arch to South) all hours of operation, and into West Philly until 3PM. And they made sure to let me know if I wanted to order dinner earlier and have it delivered, the food may sit for up to 12 hours without a fridge and is still solid. GOOD TO KNOW.

My boyfriend has been bugging me to try this place and telling me that I would love it. I'm already a big fan of Pure Fare and, honestly, I might like the Agno Grill concept even more. There are so many choices for what you can put into your bowl or wrap that you could probably go twenty times and have something different each time. Last night I opted for a (step 1) black rice bowl with (step 2) veggies, (step 3) roasted cauliflower, olives, and white bean, spinach and parmesan spread plus (step 4) tzatziki and the special sauce of the day, green peppers and olive tapenade. And no, I didn't order a single thing extra - you really get that many different toppings in your bowl or wrap!

The black rice has a nice texture and I love the white beans w/parm and spinach, but I didn't love the rest of my choices. The radicchio and the roasted cauliflower were okay. Both the falafel and the hummus were heavy/dense and almost bitterly spicy.Since then I've kept the black rice (black), but swapped the \"protein\" for either grilled steak or the grilled vegetables, and choose 3 toppings (white beans w/parm and spinach, cucumber and tomato salad, and quinoa tabouli) with lemon tahini (sauce). The lemon tahini is great; tons of flavor! The grilled steak reminds me a bit of the braised barbacoa from Chipotle, but it's (sadly) drier with less flavor.

To break is down, you first choose a base (black rice is awesome), then a protein, followed by 3 sides and 2 sauces. The Tzatziki is to DIE for! The hummus is made in-house and is also really good.I think of Agno as more of a \"fast food made slow\" kind of place, although I was told that it is a BYO, so one can certainly make it into an outing if on a budget.

I've been on campus for a really long time, but had somehow never tried Saad's before. The thing that I liked most was the atmosphere. Saad's is a little corner eatery with a no-frills aesthetic, but welcoming at the same time. I enjoyed the diversity of the crowd, and the atmosphere was lively and vibrant.We ordered a couple of dishes to share so that I could try a few different things off the menu. We got an order of the falafel, which is very good here. We also got the famous chicken maroosh (maroush?) sandwich. I have to say that I was less crazy about it than most of the reviewers. The main problem for me was that there was too much white sauce, which tasted mayo-based. I liked the pickles in the sandwich and the texture created by the bread being pressed in a toasting device. We also got the fries, which are a sleeper order--often overlooked, but seriously good here. One improvement I would suggest would be making a homemade hot sauce to provide to people (like me) who like really hot food. Not much here to make your food spicy, just run-of-the-mill hot sauce.

I'd venture to say that they are beer battered, but I trust the sign on the door that says \"halal\".

As soon as I opened up the aluminum foil a piece of chicken fell out from my chicken tawook sandwich and fell on the inside of my suit. Great, now there is mayo stains on the inside to remind me of Saad's.But if you can forget about plentiful mayo, the food is actually out of this world. My chicken tawook was piping hot, fresh, and had the typical, classical Mediterranean flavor profile you would expect from Beirut. When I got tired of eating the sandwich, I would switch to the fries for a bit, and cycle through until I could no longer finish either. My suggestion would be to share a boat of fries with someone, and work on half a sandwich and take the other half to go. Unless you're feeling distinctly American in Beirut and you want to throw away all your New Year's resolutions.Intriguingly there is a \"no cell phone rule\", is that while you order, or while you eat, or what?

Very Mediocre.Overall, I knew the octopus salad would be the bomb because I've had it before. Everything else was ehhh.Service was friendly and okay."], ["Krystal H.", "This charming little open air spot is adorable. We had great service! We went for restaurant week and it was really nice. Huge bouquets of fresh sunflowers in the windowsills made for a warm welcome.I wasn't a fan of the caesar, but then, grilled lettuce...it's a big wedge that you have to use a steak knife to chop yourself. The haloumi was great, the sprouts were delicious. The blackberries used as garnish and in some of the salads were fresh and ripe, not too sour. The shrimp looked beautiful and everyone who tried them said they were cooked well. Same goes for the pork chop and salmon.For dessert (there were 5 of us) they just brought us a sampling. While we all tried everything, none of us wanted the rice pudding or the panna cotta. It would have been nice if they let you choose.I'd love to go back again when it's not restaurant week.

My friend and I ordered 3 small plates and a side of the Brussels sprouts. The server said it would be on the lighter side but I was stuffed and we had food left on the table. The risotto was creamy and so simple but somehow so effing good. The haloumi was also tasty but salty (that's just the cheese though) but it was good. The pita was also amazing - get the tahini!!! It's creamy not liquidy like normal. Skip the avocado hummus it was whatevs. The Brussels sprouts didn't impress like cray or anything but good veggie to have. Can't wait to go back!

We chose your restaurant because the pre fix option (3 courses for $30- see photo for proof). When the bill arrived we received a $28 charge for desserts. upon notifying the waiter by saying \"we were charged for dessert when the website says 3 courses for $30\", he provided sass with the following comment \"well it clearly says on the chalkboard outside that it's 2 for $30\". Thank goodness we pulled up the website when the bill had arrived for confirmation. Because 5 minutes later the waiter came by and said \"just so you know *shows his phone* our website says 2 for $20\". So we proceeded to show our phone and clarify he had obviously spent the last few minutes editing the website to try prove us wrong. I do not appreciate liars. I come here often and I am appalled by the lack of class and shadiness of your employees. How dare you be so rude. Own up to your mistake. See the photos of you need proof."], ["Sophon P.", "Came here on a Saturday. We stood for almost 2HRS to be seated. However, the wait was worth it.

Me and the girls were stuffed!"], ["Sylvia K.", "The menu for this place looked really good, so I picked this place to have dinner with a friend. We ordered the roasted brussels sprouts, the short rib flatbread, and the pappardelle. The bruseels sprouts were really good and cooked perfectly. The short rib flatbread came with braised short rib, portobello, and truffle oil. This one was all right. The pappardelle (which is my favorite pasta noodle) came with portobello mushrooms, arugula, sunflower seeds, and shaved locatelli cheese. This pasta dish was also good, but it was a tad bland - it could've used a little more flavor, though I'm not sure what. The service was really great - our attentive server came by a few times to check on us and to refill our waters. The interior is really simple - there's nothing on the walls, but there were beautiful bouquets of tulips. It kind of felt like we were in someone's home eating dinner (with many other guests) and you could also kind of see into the kitchen. The place is not huge, and the tables are set up really close to each other. This place is cash only, so make sure you bring some ahead of time. They also take check, which is kind of weird, but I guess if you carry a checkbook around, that's also an option for you. The place is also BYOB, which is awesome. I saw lots of parties bring in their own bottles of wine. My friend and I didn't partake, but I did notice when leaving the restaurant later, that there was a store selling alcohol across the street! Convenient!"], ["Amanda M.", "Thanks to Pope Francis' impending visit, restaurant week was moved from its standard September dates to August. \u00a0Anyone who's read my reviews knows I'm a big fan of RW, so I wasn't going to let the date change stand in my way. \u00a0A friend and I settled pretty quickly on Audrey Claire, as the menu looked amazing (lots of choices!) and we'd both heard good things. The night started off great - the restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived, and so we were able to pick a table by the window. The waiter was attentive, opening the wine we brought and bringing over ice right away (although he didn't offer to pour, which I thought was odd). We were served warm crusty bread with delicious dipping oil, and were given plenty of time to make our decisions about what to order. I went with the fried haloumi to start, followed by the pappardelle pasta with portobellos (how's that for a tongue twister?) Unfortunately, the starters stole the show - my haloumi was amazing, and my friend's brussel sprouts were delicious too. \u00a0The papardelle was mostly disappointing, heavily oiled and not particularly impressive at all. \u00a0Sometime during our meal they turned off the air conditioning (remember, this is August), and a couple very large groups filed into the restaurant. \u00a0Consequently, the place got VERY hot - so much so that I was pretty anxious to leave. \u00a0Of course, we had to stay for dessert, which ending up being not worth it. \u00a0We were served a tray of rice pudding and chocolate melting cake to share - neither really interested me, so we booked it out of there fairly shortly after. I don't think I'd come back for a full meal, though the starters are worth a trip if you're in the area. I'd rather pick a few of those to share than spend a lot of $$ on an unimpressive entree."], ["Katie L.", "We've been in a small plates mood lately, and since many of my fellow Yelpers complained about the blandess of entrees at Audrey Claire, we opted for the \"snack as many things as you can\" option. We started with the antipasti for two, per my fellow Yelper's recommendations since everything looked pretty good, although a \"little\" of everything was definitely true. Would have loved more of the artichokes and the mushrooms, for sure. The beets and the tomatoes were just kind of middle-of-the-road.For the smaller dishes we went with all of your great tips and tried the seared haloumi (pretty darn excellent), jumbo crab (too much apples, too little crab), grilled octopus (because yes, more please) and baby arugula salad with figs (tasty, but a little too simple.)So overall it was hit or miss. If someone wanted me to join them at Audrey Claire, I would definitely not say no (BYOB, hello), but I don't feel the need to go out of my way to go back."], ["Kimberly D.", "This place is seriously adorable.

Service was good, not spectacular. The hostess seemed overwhelmed and the restaurant clearly needs to hire more staff. But, the most important part if this place is the food. We went for restaurant week and pretty much everything was delicious. The Tiger Shrimp appetizer was kind of bland, but the Brussel sprouts with Parmesan was delicious. My favorite dishes were the lemon sole and pork ribs. The mashed potatoes with the pork ribs was devine and the sole was juicy and soft. Dessert was wonderful as well. My only complaint is that it was very loud in the restaurant. I had to shout and lean in to speak to my dining partner. Otherwise, I had a very pleasant experience and would go there again."], ["Jessica S.", "I've been to Audrey Claire before for small plates and flatbreads and thought it was delicious, so I was pretty pumped to dine here again for my friend's birthday. There was a group of 10 of us and we were able to score Sunday night reservations at 8pm. It was the first night of the August restaurant week.. Now I usually am a big fan of RW, but I tend to be cautious about where I go, since sometimes the menu is limited and the portions are smaller. The menu for Audrey Claire looked pretty good, since they offered lots of options for appetizers and dinner and an assortment of desserts for the table. The place is small and cute with some outdoor seating. It's BYOB (plus) and cash only (minus). We were seated after a few minutes and our wine was opened and placed in buckets. We were brought out crusty bread with olive oil to start the meal. I decided on the seared haloumi with sesame fig compote. The haloumi was a tad salty, but overall very flavorful and delicious. The candied dates provided a nice balance between sweet and savory and I was plotting how to avoid sharing with my husband since we decided we would split our appetizers! He got the arugula salad with goat cheese, lentils, berries, and figs. The salad was okay.. Nothing very special. The goat cheese was good but not very abundant. The rest of the salad was pretty lackluster and I didn't care for the texture of these particular figs. I also tried my friends Brussels sprouts, which I thought were pretty good but not the best I've ever had.Onto the main course: I was excited to try the pappardelle, as it's my favorite kind of pasta and it sounded so good with mushrooms, arugula, sunflower seeds, and shaved cheese. I got this and my husband got the ahi tuna which we planned to split. The pappardelle was pretty terrible. It had absolutely no flavor except for oil and the blandness of the dish made it pretty unappetizing. I'm confused why it's hard to put salt/pepper/any kind of seasoning at all on a pasta dish. I was pretty surprised at how bad it was and also very sad! The tuna was also not that great. Again, the crust on the tuna was bland and it was probably the first time in my life where I left pieces of ahi tuna on my plate. Main course fail!!!The desserts were a nice variety and they brought them out for everyone to share. I am not a huge dessert person but the molten lava cake was delicious. Service was decent throughout the night. Moral of the story: only come here for appetizers and dessert. Skip the main meal. Won't be back again for RW but would come back for small plates and a redemption.."], ["Caragh C.", "We came here on a Sat night and got a table right away (no reservations on the weekend). For the appetizer, I got the pear flatbread, which was amazing. For the entree I got the porkchop. The porkchop was well cooked and was delicious.

By the time the dessert came, we couldn't eat anymore, but the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate lave cake were also good.The service was great, everyone was very friendly.The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate its good for date night or groups.

The flat breads are all delicious and pretty large, the braised short rib is the best.

It's always jam-packed, but I don't really get the appeal other than its cute ambiance. \u00a0On our last visit, we got the appetizer sampler, which was just fine. A bunch of under-seasoned vegetables and some olives should not cost $17. \u00a0I've also had fish two times here. \u00a0Once, it was so drenched in butter and oil I couldn't even taste it, and the second time it was so dry and overcooked that I didn't want to finish. \u00a0The risotto served alongside it was also undercooked to the point of being crunchy. \u00a0The only thing I loved and ordered all three times I went was the seared Haloumi. \u00a0It's possibly worth a visit on its own. \u00a0As others have mentioned, the service here is bizarre as well. You have to order all your dishes at once, and the servers are for the most part unfriendly. \u00a0There's no hostess so the last time we went, we waited at the door for almost 10 minutes before anyone approached us to put our name on a list. \u00a0All in all, I'd say this one is a pass."], ["Katie G.", "Service was good, outdoor seating nice.

We were greeted by a friendly male server and promptly seated outside.Flatbread with Braised Short Rib, Portobello, Melted Fontina Cheese, & Truffle Oil - 3.5 out of 5Sort of like a small pizza, the flatbread dough was thin and shaped into a round. It was more like a thin cracker. The edges were completely cooked through and crispy. I liked the use of the Fontina cheese, it was more flavorful than a mozzarella but less intense than a Pecorino. It gave a nice salty twang to the dish and it helped highlight the soft sweetness of the short ribs. Still, this dish fell short somehow; it needed some acid or some drizzled reduction on top for it to taste complete.Bloody Beets and Sunkist Orange with Black Truffle Vinaigrette - 2 out of 5This dish, ordered as an appetizer, arrived in a small bowl. The beets, cut into small blocks, were paired with two equally chilled orange heart sections on top. Flavor-wise, we both did not taste the truffle at all. These beets tasted boiled, as opposed to roasted (or a combination of the two), and therefore they did not have the caramelized sugar and earthy taste that an oven imparts. Overall, this dish was bland as there was zero seasoning. Taste aside, the textures were nice.Seared Brussels Sprouts with Shaved Parmesan - 3 out of 5There were about three large halved Brussels Sprouts that were seared and a little crispy. They were tossed in olive oil and topped with shaved Parmagiano Reggiano. These were kind of undercooked and kind of bland. I liked the idea of Parmesan, but the slabs of cheese were too thick and large to really incorporate with the sprouts. In summary, the presentation was too rustic; everything had to be cut a lot and mixed together. Like the beets, these could have been exponentially better with salt and pepper.Marinated Mozzarella Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes, Israeli Basil, & Pancetta Lardons - 3 out of 5I appreciated the simplicity of the three 1/4-in. thick rounds of mozzarella, tossed in olive oil, and topped with large sections of a tomato. One of the most important things in a fresh tomato is the texture. [Gritty, foamy tomato meat results from refrigeration.] These tomatoes tasted refrigerated, and as a result the flavor dulled significantly. The mozzarella was average. Pancetta lardons, little salty brilliant bits, were sprinkled on the plate.Grilled Octopus with Feta, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Lemon, over Greens - 4 out of 5I'll preface this review by stating that I'm not a fan of octopus. However, I always retry food I don't like again and again to hopefully acquire a taste for it. That said, this was my favorite dish. The octopus was grilled to perfection. It was tender and lightly charred. I also loved the mild feta dressing on the salad.Service -Hit or miss. Our main server, a young woman with brown hair, seemed unenthusiastic. She didn't greet us and there weren't any pleasantries with her service. There was a food runner/server assistant, a super cool and friendly guy with short (or no?) hair who kept an eye on us. He really did end up taking care of us well and we tipped him commensurate to our appreciation."], ["Ari S.", "Perfection. \u00a0Service, Food, and the fact that I can see my food being made. \u00a0All amazing. \u00a0It was mine and my girlfriend's first anniversary. \u00a0I came in at 4:30 to drop off some flowers and a vase to have on the table when we arrived to surprise her. \u00a0I was ready to start adding in the flower food and ask the host to put water in, and he told me he would take care of everything. \u00a0Not only did they have them there, but the host arranged them beautifully. \u00a0Great start to the night. \u00a0The waiter brought out an ice bucket for our wine that we brought to keep it cool. \u00a0We ordered all plates to share. \u00a0First came out the Bosc Pear and Gorgonzola flatbread. \u00a0 All the ingredients went so well together. \u00a0After removing the empty flatbread plate, the waiter brought the antipasti for 2. \u00a0What could be wrong with lightly grilled or sauteed veggies? \u00a0So many, so good. \u00a0After that, we were brought the best parts of the meal... \u00a0the hallumi and leek and portobella tart. \u00a0Lastly, we ordered dessert. \u00a0The waiter brought out the creme brule, which was awesome. \u00a0Then surprised us with a complimentary bread pudding with a candle in it for our anniversary. \u00a0All-in-all, this was a great dining experience and I will go back many times over."], ["Charlene L.", "Clean flavors and fair prices, this is what comes to mind when trying out Audrey Claire. \u00a0Came here while in town for business and heard about this place as it's fairly new. \u00a0I was impressed with the menu and decided to take a chance.Walked in with no reservations and was able to be seated. \u00a0However, it was a bit of squeeze and super busy (Sunday, 6pm). \u00a0First thing that I noticed was that it was super loud in there.. super hard to hear anything, and that's not just because I'm a granny... Things that were ordered:-Seared brussel sprouts with shaved parmesan: Really delicious, \u00a0but then again I'm an easy sell when it comes to brussel sprouts. \u00a0Not overly crispy, almost a pan roasted.. nice flavors, but nothing new that I haven't seen when it comes to this common preparation. -2lbs of Prince Edward Island mussels: Mussels are mussels! Super common typically done in a white wine and garlic. \u00a0But this was surprisingly different! More of a sun-dried tomato broth, but full flavor. \u00a0Would have been great if bread was served, as there was so much liquid in the bowl! Also, a huge serving! -Crispy shallot crusted lemon sole with crispy sage and caper butter: Loved the texture of this crispy shallow crust and the perfectly cooked sole. \u00a0However, I was really looking forward to more of a lemon/citrus flavor but didn't taste that. \u00a0Also, it was served with long green beans (perfectly cooked but tons of butter) and cous cous. Good components of this dish, but again, nothing note worthy.. Tasted a bit heavy, especially for a fish dish, due to the flavors of too much butter.I was super disappointed that they were out of the grilled octopus, as that was the first dish that really caught my eye. \u00a0Overall, a solid restaurant for fresh flavors without complicating the dish. \u00a0Would I be back?

Two of us did the \"Tayim\" for $42ea, meaning we tried 10+ plates for $80ea after drinks and tip. No modernist techniques at Zahav but it still deserves 1* over several Chicago staples (Blackbird, Longman & Eagle). We're waiting, Michelin.Zahav's hidden residential location is a grassy, tranquil square; circle the building until it pops out. Inside fits thirty families; ages vary but it's all groups, few couples. Soft yellow pain and plenty of natural light maintain bright atmosphere despite cloudy skies, and the soundtrack keeps things lively despite the patron's age range.Ten minutes past opening on Sunday and half the bar seats were still available. We grabbed two, were greeted immediately, and soon enjoyed well balanced cocktails: the Desert Rose is done right, incredibly refreshing compared to the somewhat muted Smoked and Famous.. chartreuse should always be the highlight of any drink it's in. The New Year's Jerusalem was essentially ros\u00e9.. pass next time.The incredibly consistent food stretched across 10 plates and multiple forms of protein, veggies, breads.. masterful on all accounts from the starting salad to the stunning desserts. Favorites included the ethereal labenah ice cream sandwich, the bright carrots with aleppo pepper, the spicy merguez lamb sausage, and the incredibly smokey-yet-delicate grape leaves. The only dishes we'd skip on next visit was the tartare and regular hummus--go with the Turkish.We were gifted two more dishes on top of the ten from the tasting menu; one from the main menu and one an off-menu amuse.

Not something that you see that often. \u00a0Worth it simply for that. \u00a0Soooooo much food. \u00a0I was stuffed long before the meal was over. \u00a0We ordered the Tayim (a tasting menu). \u00a0I am not sure that I would get the tasting menu again, only because we left so much food uneaten (I would have loved to have taken food home, but we had a long night of \u00a0being out afterwards without storage).SALADS AND HUMMUS:The selection of salads were terrific, very tasty. \u00a0I liked the beet salad and the eggplant ones best. \u00a0The hummus was well made. \u00a0The salads, hummus, and pita would make a good meal in their own right if you got a bit more pita. \u00a0For the amount of salads and hummus you get, there needs to be either more pita or less other stuff.We were sent out a complimentary dish of smoked salmon and some pickled vegetables. \u00a0The pickling on this was too strong for my taste, I did enjoy the smoked salmon though. \u00a0It seemed like every table was given a complimentary dish.SMALL PLATES:The haloumi and dates might have been my favorite of the small plates, very rich flavor. \u00a0The duck hearts were not too tough, were well seasoned and paired well with what was on the plate. \u00a0The asparagus was cooked well, well seasoned and flavorful.The last of the small plates was sort of a breaded chicken ball. \u00a0It had what might have been rice or couscous inside with some small vegetables. \u00a0This was a little dry. \u00a0GRILLED DISHES:The branzino was served with tzatziki, lemon, and a crispy skin. \u00a0My companion liked the fish more than I did, the citrus taste was a bit much for me. \u00a0I thought the lamb was delicious. \u00a0The peas worked perfectly with the earthy taste of the meat. For dessert, she had the pineapple sorbet, I had a carrot cake with apricot. \u00a0We both agreed that mine was the better of the two. \u00a0A moist cake with apricot baked into it. \u00a0DINNING ROOM AND SERVICE:I was surprised how loud it was in here. \u00a0Tall ceilings, tables close together. \u00a0There was a not-so-dull roar until it got pretty late into the night. \u00a0The music was interesting, surprising for what we were doing, but great music. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0However, I am not a big fan of the over the top service in places like this. \u00a0I don't need new silverware every minute and a half, and my water glass was refilled even when I didn't drink out of it. \u00a0I did like that we arrived early for our reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in, I was not expecting that. \u00a0We came for our anniversary, and they gave us a complimentary glass of champagne. \u00a0A very nice touch. \u00a0All in all, this place is a hype machine. \u00a0It was a very good meal, but there are some things that I would order differently at my next visit. \u00a0With two weeks notice, I was only able to reserve a table at 10:30 pm on a weekend (we were seated closer to 10 pm). \u00a0While I would not agree that it is the best restaurant in Philadelphia, it is very good, and I will be back, if I can get a table."], ["Nicolas N.", "Excellent ambiance, service and food = satisfying dining experience. \u00a0This is one of the quintessential Philadelphia restaurant - a must visit if you are in the area!"], ["Sophack S.", "Before Zahav, I don't think I ever had eaten legitimate Israeli food, but luckily I was able to sample the many delights of this particular cuisine here. Now admittingly I could not say I'm an expert in Mediterranean/Israli food, as it seemed quite similar to other renditions of this cuisine, but this place was so good, packed some really nice flavor and executed very well.Let's start with the service and decor. Greeted with smiles all around from hostesses to waiters/waitresses to kitchen staff, you feel welcomed. The atmosphere is very intimate and alluring in both the environment and the food. The waiter we had was excellent. I'm sadden that I don't recall his name because he did a great job in explaining the menu and read us well in determining if we really like our food and drinks. Drink wise we started with the lemonnana. Quite refreshing and might have been better later in the night, but never the less it was a solid starter. After this, I had order a marble rye, but I did not enjoy this as much. The celery soda really caught me off guard and was a bit too carbonated/fizzy for me. Our waiter noticed my displeasure with the drink and offered another drink. This time asked some of my preferences and I received the smoked and famous. I'm starting to get familiar with mezcal and this was a solid drink. The smoky-ness from (what I believe was) the charcoal infused spirit was upfront, but not overpowering and with the chartreuse bringing the sweetness to even the sour/tart flavor. Excellent drink.Food wise we did the Tayim: Taste of Zahav to sample several things. I think this is a good choice if you're not decided on anything in particular and it gives quite a sampling of the menu. The meal started with the pickled items and salads which were all delicious: carrots, beets, etc. Some of the notable items were of the apps and mains were the following:Crispy Grape LeavesHouse Smoked SableDuck KebabLamb MerguezThe sable was quite good. Add an egg (my weakness) and boom, winner. The grape leaves were also quite tasty. The ground beef had a nice flavor and was easily the best graphe leaves I've ever had. Honestly... every item was great. Nothing but great things to say about this place. Absolutely stuffed at the end of the night.There's no wonder why Chef Michael Solomonov received a James Beard Award in 2011 for this place. Excellent all around."], ["Linda ..", "The positives:We reserved a spot, and when we walked in, were brought straight to our table, so that was nice that we didn't have to wait for our reservation. Our water glasses were never empty, as I think they had waiters reserved specifically for making sure that the water glasses were never empty. I liked that they waited until both parties were finished eating to clear the plates. Overall, the services was almost perfect, except for the very end (see below).Negatives:The food was so so. The hummus was amazing, with the exception of the butter hummus. It was very flavorless because the butter seemed to almost overwhelm the flavor of the chickpeas and the tahini. Would not recommend it. The chicken is dark chicken only-so if you don't like dark meat, don't get the chicken. At the very end, we were finishing our drinks and we weren't being slow with payment, but the waiter kept looking over my fiancee's shoulder when he walked by to see if my fiance was finished paying. We were just about to leave when the waiter came by and actually snapped up the payment in front my fiance's face, like he was frustrated that we had taken so long to get up and leave.

It's smoked fish atop a large fluffy slice of challah bread sandwiching a fried egg. Once you dig your spoon into the fish (actually they do it for you), you see the yolk ooze out slowly... So good, and also a bit salty (but I guess what else can be expected from smoked fish?)The crispy haloumi is good if you're looking for something heavier and filling. The duck hearts and fried cauliflower were very good, and I can see why the latter is a crowd favorite. I'd skip the raw lamb though.Al ha'esh: my personal favorite was the lamb merguez. It was so well sliced and flavorful (I could definitely taste the dashes of cumin)! The lamb came paired with roasted pumpkin seeds, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and squash.The sirloin was a bit salty for me, as was the babaganoush on the side. I also tried the kofte (meatballs), and they also had flavor, but what blew me away was the lamb.Dessert: I can't speak for many on this, but after having had so many intense flavor parties in my mouth, I was ready to finish with something lighter - the pear sorbet. I was expecting flavored ice, but it was actually very creamy -- I don't know how they did it! This came with small orange slices, pomegranate seeds, and granola on the side, and they all sat atop a sort of cinnamon-tasting, clear jelly. The dessert was very complicated for my taste buds at the end of a 2 hour meal, but I'm pretty sure it's because my palate isn't refined enough (lol).The kataifi and honey cake bread pudding are great if you want a larger and slightly heavier dessert! I was more than happy at the end of the long meal, and my advice would be to pace yourselves!Zahav is definitely a 5/5."], ["Kimberly D.", "Holy cow their hummus is awesome.

Atmosphere is inviting and the food is a true experience in itself. Textures mingle with fresh flavored and uniquely blended ingredients! Simple ingredients such as cauliflower and turnips come to life with their cooking techniques and ethnic flavor profiles. I will be back!"], ["Raj D.", "UPDATE:Following my complaint to the restaurant, I got an unexpected communication from Zahav's manager who had read the review. He went through it 'point-by-point 'and promised to fix the discrepancies - for instance, raising the topic of delays with the staff at their daily meetings and even amending the verbiage in the menu. I wasn't expecting it, and it is not every day that a busy restaurant like this takes time out to address concerns of a patron with detail at a personal level. Additionally, what I liked about the response was that it was not 'defensive', but rather appreciative - he acknowledged the concerns raised and was willing to resolve the issues (rather than disputing or trying to rationalise them). In light of this, I'd like to clarify a couple of items --- We were waiting for the waitress for eternity and not the hostess as such; and- The food is not the usual atypical middle eastern, but characteristically Israeli which is very close to Middle Eastern with a different touchThe service and follow-up from the manager makes a meaningful difference (and is by itself worthy of a Michelin star ! :-) and to respect and show appropriate value towards this, I have updated my erstwhile ranking for the restaurant. Well done and keep it up !------Food is OK. If you are looking for Middle Eastern food this is not it. The ambience is good. Place was crowded even on a Wednesday evening, ... And the service can be a bit rushed as a result. We were waiting for eternity before the hostess managed to come by and the service was lacking.Everything is Tapas - Small plates. There isn't really an entree section but the menu is divided into mezze (small plates) and al hayesh (which seems like the traditional entree section) but is actually also small plates - I think this should be made clearer in the menu so people can get a sense of the portions. They advertise rice pilaf with al hayesh, but it is not per plate. We ordered 4 al hayesh and it cam with 1 rice pilaf. You have to ask if you want the complete set (not sure why this is the case, you should be delivering food as per the menu)?!Salatim: it's huge. When the waitress told me it was small, I wasn't exactly expecting six small plates of salads. But that aside it had a good variety including eggplants, carrots, beans etc.Hummus is Average but salty. The preparation (serving) with the garnish looks very nice.Smoked Sable was terrific.Al Hayesh - No complaints - all were cooked and prepared to satisfaction."], ["Sanoj P.", "First off, I'm a huge carnivore.

Secondly, I heard a lot of people say this place was really great, but I've been let down by other people's opinion - so, I was skeptical. Let me tell you how unreal the food is!SERVICE: We had made reservations and we went for our anniversary. I think my wife mentioned it when making the reservation. We were congratulated four times: hostess, waiter, manager, and the guy sitting next to us because of the other three. The waiter kept our table clean, plates were removed quickly, and they had the perfect amount of being around when necessary and out of the way as necessary. FOOD: Holy cow - the lamb was great. But I'm keeping it real here: the vegetarian dishes were absolutely phenomenal. I told my wife that if she cooked vegetables like this, I'd convert my eating habits that night! We had the chef's choice option and it was worth it. Everything that came out of the kitchen was spot on. And so much food! So much variety, and everything came out so tasty! I hate beets, but that beet dish was the best thing I've ever eaten. And their choice of wines was great!

We were sat at the bar and pretty much immediately ordered the Tayim which is the $42 tasting.First of all, Chris, our main server was awesome. So friendly and knowledgeable but not overbearing. He gave us some great recommendations (LOVED the cobia crudo!)Okay, food-wise, everything was incredibly flavorful. People are right about the hummus (we got the masbacha although I was very very tempted by the Turkish hummus)--it was the smoothest, most delicious hummus I've ever had. The laffa was freshly baked and perfect for the hummus. And I LOVED the salatim selection. I don't even like carrots but I liked their carrots! We got twice-cooked eggplant, pickled napa cabbage with onions, green beans, beets, carrots, and roasted red peppers&carrots. Everything was delicious.At that point, we were already pretty full but still had a bunch of courses left! The marinated asparagus was tangy and salty from the bulgarian feta and I really liked the toasted hazelnuts on top. As I said before, I loved the cobia crudo which is a very different preparation of raw fish than what I'd had before, mainly in sushi restaurants. This one came with some spicy Turkish sauce and fava beans. The grilled halloumi was also great although I would have liked more pickled onions to cut the richness but that's just being nitpicky :) And the bf really loved the chicken kibbe which smelled and tasted amazing with a whiff of cinnamon.For our grilled plates, we got the duck kebab and the sirloin. The duck was a bit spicy and had a lot of different spices going on--I felt that I needed to eat some of the pickles we were given or rice after every bite of duck just to calm down my tastebuds! I liked it but I didn't quite expect it to be ground duck (like a duck meatball) and I tend to prefer regular duck pieces. The sirloin was amazing though! Really tender with a great crust.By the time dessert came around, I was so full I could barely take a few more bites! We got the carrot basbousa to go and we shared the Chocolate Halva Mousse. Really unique. I really liked the mousse with its sesame undertones although I thought the chocolate was a tad dry and crumbly.

Can't wait to return."], ["Suzy D.", "4.5 starsOur meal at Zahav was easily in my top three meals of 2014, beat out only by Rose's Luxury in DC and Ink in LA. The food was beyond excellent. I just spent six months living in the Middle East and ate more than my fair share hummus; Zahav's blows all other hummuses (hummi?) out of the water. I'd never had warm hummus until our meal at Zahav but I highly, highly recommend giving it a shot. It brings out flavors that would otherwise be overlooked by the palate. The timing of the meal was the one element that was lacking. I wouldn't have even minded having somewhat extended waits between courses except that the temperature felt like an arctic cold had swept in and, given it was August, I hadn't brought a down parka with me. Had we had the beverage we had ordered to distract ourselves from the cold it may not have been so bad but between the wait and just how painfully cold the restaurant was, I have to dock it half a star.After our initial and promptly served round of cocktails (I had the Desert Rose with gin, hibiscus, grapefruit, and cucumber), we went for a pitcher of the very summery Lemonnana (Jim Bean, muddled mint, fresh lemon, verbena) and waited for it to arrive. Our food courses came and went and still we waited. It doesn't take that long to mix four ingredients yet we waited some more. We were close to the end of the savory portion of the meal by the time it arrived and, since there were only two of us, we had to drink faster than preferred to remain on course with the meal.We began with the Masbacha - the warm chickpea hummus. Unknown to us, this came accompanied by six small veggie side dishes. Seeing the spread of food before us, we knew that we probably shouldn't have ordered that in addition to the \"taste of Zahav\" menu for each of us. Regardless, it was delightful and the veggies were a nice treat with everything tasting very fresh.Zahav allows you to create your own tasting menu (two mezzes, one grill, one dessert for $42) which was perfect since we were able to try a sizable portion of the menu. Our four mezzes were the crispy grape leaves, fried cauliflower, Yemenite beef stew and konafi (cheese cubes). The first three were fabulous but we both found the konafi to be unpalatable. Justin ate a couple bites but I was done after one and only reluctantly swallowed that down. The GM inquired about the nearly-full plate and we said that we were glad to have tried it - it was certainly unique - but neither one of us cared for it. He insisted that he would bring us another dish of our choosing. We politely declined, afterall we were the ones who chose it, but he insisted and brought us the watermelon, feta and black olive salad. This ended up being the best of the five mezzes we had and we were very thankful for the generosity of the GM. For the grills we had duck and kofte, the latter being my favorite. And for dessert Justin chose the black forest mousse and I had the white chocolate custard with watermelon and hazelnuts. I generally dislike fruit in dessert but this dish blew me away. This was the best dessert I had all year and it was beautifully plated. Some of the menu here is seasonable but there are staple items that remain all year around. Regardless of what is on the menu when you visit you're sure to find a bunch of winning items...just remember to bring a sweater despite the temperature outside."], ["Neeraj J.", "It is hard to get a reservation here. \u00a0And, when reviews are this high, I have doubts that a place will live up to it's reputation. \u00a0Well, Zahav lives up it and then some. \u00a0Absolutely delicious food and great drinks. \u00a0I could eat here every week if it was possible. \u00a0If I had to nitpick, I would say that my entree was kind of small - next time I will probably stick to ordering several more small plates. \u00a0Make your reservation and patiently wait for the day - this is a meal that's worth waiting for!"], ["Maris F.", "I'd be a regular at Zahav if I lived in Philly. I love their decor, their laid back music, relaxed but upbeat atmosphere and I especially loved their food! The restaurant has an old world feel with a new world twist with its arched doors with large red drapes and large colored photos above the dining tables. You can definitely tell that the menu was put together by a James Beard award winning chef. We sipped on some yummy rose in a small lounge area upfront while waiting for a table at the bar. Once seated we ordered an array of dishes. My favorite was the crispy haloumi cheese with onions and a sweet and savory jam. I really enjoyed the salmon filet with its crispy skin, and the hummus paired well with their warm, soft bread. I was impressed with their complimentary ricotta and heirloom salad with picked veggies, it was amazing! The servers were engaging and attentive and they made our entire dining experience a five star experience. I will be back soon!"], ["Jonathan D.", "Can I give them 6 stars? I'd been wanting to go here for a couple of years, but now that I don't live in Philly anymore, opportunities are a bit fewer. Still, I'm in town a number of times a year, and my parents and I finally made it this past Tuesday. Wow. Just wow. We got the Mesibah menu, which is basically their version of an omakase. It began with 6 small dishes of salatim, which are little salad/pickled/Israeli antipasto type dishes. Among them were beets, eggplant, cabbage, string beans and carrots (I think the 6th dish combined a few things). Each one was incredibly fresh and like a little flavor explosion in your mouth. Next came hummus with fresh made (and grilled) laffa. Both were addictive and probably were the downfall of my parents, who got rather full later.Next came a trio of mezze. Ours were the crispy fried haloumi (sensational, came with dates, pickled onion), the house-smoked sable with challah and a fried egg (yum!) and fried cauliflower (easily the best iteration of that dish I've had). The main course was a beautiful shoulder of lamb that was falling apart tender, accompanied by pomegranate glazed chickpeas (could have used a few more of those) and this fascinating crispy rice (almost like a giant crispy cake). Fantastic flavors all around, and enough food to bring home for another meal for my folks.Dessert was a trio of gorgeous desserts, including their ice cream sandwich (it's so much more than that!), a carrot basboosa (with beautiful apricot in it) and a lovely dessert that rocked a chocolate ganache filling but was surprisingly airy. Will post some pictures to help bridge the gaps in my reporting.Service was on it. Not only was our server very friendly and knowledgeable, but water glasses were always kept full, and my mother was tickled that our table kept getting wiped between courses. The restaurant was bustling (well, when you're one of the best restaurants in the US, this isn't a shock). We sat in a room off the main room; only tiny issue was that it was a touch dark where we were, so I pulled out my cell phone to help my dad see the menu. But that's nothing when compared to an amazing, authentic meal with great service and a comfortable environment. Can't wait to go back!"], ["Liza K.", "My Elite Yelper friends said that Zahav was the best restaurant in Philadelphia - and I was SO glad I finally tried it. \u00a0Book ahead as they fill up fast! This is a quality restaurant that is what it purports to be - authentic and flavorful items that are unique and exciting.The short of it: Try the Fried Cauliflower and the Duck Hearts (if you're not squeamish) - they were by far the best and most exciting items we tried! Dessert was underwhelming, and the Cremini Mushrooms were too salty for our taste.The service was very friendly and helpful without being overbearing. \u00a0We had a lot of questions about menu items, and our waitress answered all our questions with confidence and in detail. \u00a0We trusted her recommendations and were glad we did. \u00a0Go for the Tayim - Taste of Zahav for $42 if you get the chance - it's really worth trying a lot of items on their menu. \u00a0**You can only do the tasting menu if everyone in your group chooses to do it, so peer pressure your friends into it!** It's a great deal and gives you the chance to take some culinary risks!I started with the Desert Rose drink, which had just the right amount of sweetness and wasn't too strong. \u00a0It was very complimentary to my meal.We started with the Laffa and classic Hummus. You can tell it's a recipe they've perfected over many years. Then they brought out the Salatim (a medley of different cold salads). \u00a0We both LOVED the eggplant one, and really all of them were pretty amazing. Just as an FYI, if you're ordering off the tasting menu, don't worry about getting too many veggies later on as you'll start with a good amount of healthy veggies here.For the Mezze/Small Plates, we tried the Crispy Grape Leaves, which are stuffed with ground beef and tomato, and served in a mild harissa tehina sauce. \u00a0It was an unusual take on one of my favorite dishes, and I liked the unexpected crispy texture (compared to the way that stuffed grape leaves/dolmas are normally served).The Yemenite Beef Stew came out next and was very tasty as well. \u00a0It comes with several pieces of roasted short rib and two potatoes. \u00a0The short rib was tender and juicy, in just the right amount of sauce that didn't overpower the meat itself. \u00a0Only came with two potatoes :( Between the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, our waitress didn't hesitate: \"Go for the Fried Cauliflower, it's been on our menu unchanged since we opened. It's a favorite.\" \u00a0I'm SO glad we listened to her as this turned out to be my favorite dish of the meal. The cauliflower was fried and came with a labaneh sauce with chive, dill, mint and garlic. \u00a0I could have just stopped there and eat more cauliflower. \u00a0So delicious! \u00a0I don't want to go on and on about it, but give it a try! \u00a0I don't think you'll be disappointed.I also wanted to try something a bit more daring, and I'd heard people raving about their Grilled Duck Hearts on Yelp. \u00a0So thank you for your advice, Yelpers! \u00a0I'm glad I took it. The Duck Hearts aren't for the faint of heart - if you're squeamish, avoid the dish as it is just what it says, they serve you actual hearts of a duck. \u00a0I love trying new food, and neither was my date, but it still took me a minute to get over the fact that I was staring at four perfect little hearts on a plate. \u00a0If you're adventurous, definitely definitely try this dish! \u00a0The hearts were very tender and I really liked the unique texture - They came with pickled green tomatoes, and soft onion rings. If you've never tried it, I enthusiastically suggest that you try it!The Al Ha'esh/Grilled Over Coals items were least exciting in my opinion. \u00a0Maybe because I was already really full by then, but by the time they came out, I was kind of over them. \u00a0The Duck Kebab (duck leg that comes on a kebab stick). The server takes it off the stick for you, so I didn't manage to snap a picture of what it looked like in its original form. \u00a0It's served over a pistachio pilaf with pickled onions and fig jam. Not as exciting as the duck hearts.The Crimini Mushrooms, which were served over israeli couscous was my least favorite item- they went overboard with the salt. I rarely am unable to finish a dish, but quite honestly it made me a bit sick to eat something this salty. \u00a0I had been reading about their chocolate mousse and their rhubarb dessert in recent reviews, and neither one was on their menu. \u00a0:( \u00a0I was looking for something lighter after the heaviness and saltiness of the Crimini Mushroom dish. We settled on the Vanilla Custard and the Almond Chocolate Cake. \u00a0They were both ok, but I wished they had lighter options to balance the heavier dishes at the end.Overall, this is an amazing restaurant that offers unique dishes and a bit of an adventure for culinary risk-takers! \u00a0Peer-pressure your friends to get their Tasting Menu so you can get a well-rounded experience, although don't get your hopes up for dessert."], ["Grace H.", "Hands down my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia. I first came here with a friend and her parents with zero expectations, not knowing anything about the place. I've since returned over 5 times. ALWAYS do the salatim. Always. Although I think you could opt for the small and be fine, even with a larger party. The hummus isn't particularly memorable, but definitely a solid choice. The roasted brussel sprouts and fried cauliflower are always a must for me. And I'm usually not a big lamb eater, but I make an exception for their pastilla - super flaky and tender.The sirloin steak is probably my favorite Al Ha'esh option, although the kofte and cremini mushrooms are both delicious as well.I would give Zahav 5 stars, but one time I brought my cousins from Korea and everything was overly salty. Apparently the head chef was out and I think I drank 4 glasses of water that day - needless to say I was a bit disappointed.

What can I say about you that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? ...Likely nothing.

I can even reiterate the fact that when I got home last night, I didn't move an inch for a good hour.Last night was like Yelp-night at Zahav, I tell you. There were several of us spread around the restaurant without actually planning it out that way. At our table, fellow Yelper Ashley S. and I were mind-blown by the amount of food given to us -- despite seeing the reviews ahead of time. This may have been the longest meal of my life, having clocked in at 2.5 hours.First there was the salatim and hummus and laffa bread. I loved the beets especially. Then came the cauliflower, chicken that tasted like Christmas, grape leaves, and haloumi. After that, I had the ribeye -- medium rare, as they suggested. Chocolate mousse for dessert.Oh, and also a Desert Rose (gin) cocktail. Always the gin.Servers were super professional and ready to swoop in with fresh plates and silverware (and also boxes...) when we were done each course. The manager was also very friendly. He asked me where I purchased my change purse since it was clearly Turkish. When he said, \"I hope to see you again,\" I awkwardly replied, \"You too,\" instead of \"Thank you,\" and I'm not even ashamed, because I must go back. They even gave a $10 off return coupon.

Overall, I have to say I wasn't blown away by this flagship dish. I have no doubt the preparation for this massive chunk of meat takes days, and it does come right off the bones and melts in your mouth. But at the same time, it is greasy and over salted. We couldn't finish the whole shoulder and the leftover that we took home was covered by a white layer of grease after sitting in the fridge overnight. Other than that, the ambiance was great, service was very professional, and we very much enjoyed the small dishes served in the beginning."], ["Jules L.", "**Neighborhood Gem**Zahav is a true gem.

Even non cheese lovers will love this! We also got the crudo and the kibbe naya. Don't be put off by the raw lamb description because it is absolutely delicious. For the final course, we had the duck kebab, lamb kofte, eggplant, and sirloin. Duck was a little salty but the lamb kofte knocked it out of the park.

He challenged us to eat the entire lamb shoulder, which he claimed had never been done before. Hoookay.Ummm, also, how have I never had Turkish hummus before? The warmed hummus we got was so silky and buttery, I just had an incredulous look on my face as I was eating it. We ordered the lamb shoulder prix fixe, which is usually only for parties of 4, but you can get it for 2, at the expense of a couple mezze. So yeah, we definitely hit that one hard.

Hummus Grill is just around-the-corner from where I work, and a meal from there, will hit the spot every bite. And, it's easy on the wallet too.I've picked this two dishes for you to try:- Shawarma sandwich: Tasty and spicy shaved grilled chicken sandwich. I prefer my sandwich in a wrap, with everything on it: hummus, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, cabbage, onion, hot sauce, and tahini.- Combination platter is the perfect choice for the indecisive people. This platter will give you a taste of the Middle East. It's pretty solid with the falafel & your choice of meat ( I always go with shawarma.) Also, it come with your choice of three sides ( tomatoes & cucumbers, cabbage, eggplant, beets, carrots, potato salad, hummus, and tabouli, or baba ganoush. And whichever you choose, I guarantee you will enjoy it.Four Yelps."], ["Lauren C.", "Swung by here for lunch the other day. \u00a0I got the salmon platter, and for $12 I received a piece of salmon that lasted 2 lunches over an equally as impressive bed of rice, a fresh piece of pita bread, hummus, tabouli and eggplant (my choice of an array of sides), a clinatro-lime creamy sauce and a more spicy salsa-like sauce. \u00a0It's a pretty healthy sized lunch... and also a pretty healthy lunch which i felt good about. \u00a0The salmon was fresh, cooked very well, and kept me full all day. \u00a0The rice was very aromatic and delicious. \u00a0The eggplant was fried and warm, and the hummus and tabouli were pretty much a dream. \u00a0I took pieces of the pita and made little sandwiches. \u00a0Overall, i really enjoyed my lunch. \u00a0I'd come back here in a heartbeat!"], ["Jane P.", "After reading the reviews a places an order for delivery for the chicken kabob platter and a chicken sharwma pita. \u00a0I also got a side of hummus and baklava. \u00a0The chicken dishes were good but just a bit dry. \u00a0Their white sauce was a greenish sauce and it was good but not the same. \u00a0The hummus was totally bland though. \u00a0However the pita that came with it was amazing.

We used Grub Hub and it made it to our office in Olde City only 20 minutes after we ordered it. I had the falafel platter, and it was really delicious. The falafel was crispy on the outside with plenty of texture on the inside- just how I like it. I had the hummus on the side, \u00a0which was perfectly creamy and balanced. You also get to choose two little side salads, so I went with the cucumber & tomatoes and the tabouleh. Both were really bright and fresh tasting, and the perfect contrast to the richness of the falafel and hummus. My only gripe was that the little cup of tahini I received was definitely watered down. It had no flavor at all and literally pored like water. Come on, guys, you can do better than that.

Hummus Grill is located pretty much smack dab in the middle, and it's easy accessibility makes it pretty popular with the general population - not to mention the reasonable prices. Staff here at this casual eatery are friendly. The food is solid too - nothing spectacular to write home about, but you won't be disappointed with the cost/quality. We typically get their platters, which is a fair amount of food: pita (solid), we go with the rice instead of fries, and your choice of three sides. My favorites are the beets, carrots, eggplant, and cabbage - hummus is fine, as is the baba ghanoush, but not as good as other places. The falafel is tasty and satisfying, although we prefer the chicken shawarma above all else (salmon is good but occasionally overcooked, and the kebabs can sometimes be a little dry). I've also enjoyed their salads, especially the salad plate. Great lunch spot right by the hospitals."], ["Jo L.", "I went the first time and had the Lamb Kabob sandwich $8.95 that I really enjoyed.
