They have even won 2015 best gelato from Best of Philly to prove it. The second you look into the resturant from the open front dining area, you can see Italy from Chestnut street. I'd say eat gelato first and then have dinner. I ordered an afogato (espresso with gelato) with zucaa (pumpkin spice) gelato which was mind blowing. They make both the gelato and coffee on premise upstairs in their labs, which the guest could watch while they enjoy dinner. By far the best espresso I have had. You know it is rich when the sugar sits at the top and needs to be mixed in, instead of just sinking to the bottom like most other places. If you are a wino, there is not a doubt that you could find a spectacular italian wine on their list of 200+ vino. Even though only about 30 of them are by the glass, each week they have a rotating menu where they visit a different city in Italy each week and gives you a chance to try some of the wines not usually sold by the glass. Now on to the food, if someone can bring me to another resturant that puts gelato on their food I would be shocked. Stefano Biasini, the gelato maker and head chef, has created something I was never aware of, gastronomic gelato! He takes a savory ingredient and turns it into a gelato to pair with a dish. Most are over pasta dishes, so it creates an extra sauce though out the dish. If you are a Carbonara lover, don't miss the Carbonara with bacon gelato! They even cook the pasta al dente like you would have in italy. I have also tried the Veal and Pork Ravioli that is served in a butter sage sauce with a black and white truffle gelato. Serve that with a glass of Cannonau and you will forever make this your regular dinner spot in the city."], ["Aditi M.", "This is a hidden gem in Center City Philadelphia.

Right off Rittenhouse but very down to earth.

They have large and small plates on their menu but some of the large plates are huge and very share-able. We got 3 small dishes, two desserts and two drinks for a very filling meal for only $60!

We actually ended up being eight and two children. I was impressed with the way that the hostess and the manager found a table for us all the while apologizing that it would be a tight fit. So many restaurants would've just turned us away and insulted us for not having a reservation. The manager actually checked in on us several times throughout the meal, and I really appreciated his thoughtfulness. This place has a sizable wine menu, a great gelato selection, and a decent food menu. Most of us ordered pasta. The portions were small but filling. Plus they left room for dessert. I ordered a crab pasta which was just ok. My husbands ragu was delicious, as were the gnocchi. The highlight was definitely the gelato. We ordered a large to share with three scoops. At 8 bucks for an ice cream it's not cheap, but no decent gelato in the city is. My favorite flavor was the kinder one that had chocolate and waffle pieces. The Nutella was a little under flavored. My husband was very happy with the wide variety of European flavors. I would definitely consider coming back for the gelato, as I consider this place comparable to cappogiros in that regard. I would also come back for some dinner but would skip the crab pasta and maybe try a panini next time. Had I loved my main course for dinner, this would've been a five-star place.

What more can you really ask for?I got the hazelnut cappuccino, which ended up being FAR more sweet and less coffee-y tasting than I was hoping for, but it was quite delicious nonetheless. I paired that with a tiramisu, which was not the best I've ever had, but I loved that it was deliciously moist and drenched in more heavenly flavors and espresso.My friends got the caramel brulee and creme brulee, both were creamy and delectable. The creme brulee had a lemon base, which was unexpected, but still quite good.L'Aquila offers 4 different blends of espresso, depending on how much of a caffeine kick you're seeking. I got the medium blend, and I don't normally have too much of an issue sleeping at night with coffee, but dang, that is some powerful espresso. I could literally feel the caffeine and sugar coursing through my veins after we finished up around 5:30 PM, and laid awake in bed many hours later that night for far longer than I was anticipating... haha, but I wouldn't take back anything I consumed. It was all quite satisfying.Overall, a little pricey for my poor graduate student budget, but it's good for a nice splurge. I'm looking forward to going back and trying the famous gelato!"], ["Cesar S.", "The sweets are amazing!

I have had quite a few things on their menu but I would definitely recommend the rustico appetizer which has some delicious cured meats, cheeses, and grilled vegetables. The wild boar pasta is also incredibly delicious! I have come here on a date and ordered an appetizer and two pastas and we were both very satiated.

I also tried the filet and mussels. The meatball was very average and somewhat disappointing, but the wild boar ragu made up for that. The mussels didn't disappoint, and the filet was also pretty good. However, the prices were a bit on the high end for Italian food, and the portions were somewhat small. SERVICE: 4/5We were seated very quickly and overall everyone was very attentive. It was a bit difficult to get the waiter's attention when we wanted to get a photo, but it might just be that it was too loud. AMBIANCE: 5/5Not a bad place for group dinners or a 1 on 1 date.

For my 22nd birthday I wanted to go somewhere fun for a group, preferably at a BYOB. Normally BYOBs are super crammed and noisy but it was a Tuesday night so I wasn't worried. I also do not like Italian food but when I looked at the menu it looked wonderful. I called Monday to make a reservation for Tuesday but they are closed on Mondays, so I left a message. They called me back Tuesday afternoon with a spot open for 9 people at 8pm. I was a little upset because their online menu is a little different, so what I thought I would order was not available. To start, I ordered the mussels and they were definitely the best I have had in the city (and my favorite food is seafood). For my main dish I ordered the Filetto Al Pepe Verde. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare and it was just that. It was perfectly cooked and for 9 orders, we received our food very quickly. After we were done eating we still wanted to hang out and drink (we brought 7 bottles of wine). We stayed over an hour after we were already finished our meals.

I was able to get a full three course meal without even a thought of having to worry about my allergy. I got the Insalata Melograno, and of course just asked them to hold the tomatoes, followed that up with my entree which was the Filetto al Pepe Verde, and something chocolate for dessert.

I actually enjoyed the antipasti platter the most - had a great variety of cold cuts, grilled veggies, mozzarella and crostini. I could eat it as a meal by myself! I ordered the pappardelle Tartufate based off yelp reviews and was slightly disappointed. The dish felt too rich / thick, but not in a creamy way.

Instead, tiny calamari rings and tentacles very lightly saut\u00e9ed and tossed with white beans, tomatoes, and wilted baby spinach. the sauce was light and lemony with a little kick. very yummy.- mussels appetizer. they were yummy, with a lovely light white wine broth. giant chunks of garlic swam in the broth, and was great for dipping when we finally got some bread (only had to ask our waiter about 4 or 5 times).- pasta special with duck. this isn't descriptive enough to be helpful, but if they have the special of ripped pasta noodles with duck- get it. - pass on the risotto. it was undercooked and underseasoned. highly doubt it was made-to-order as risotto should be. the shrimp were tasty, but the overall dish was a let-down- salmon got great reviews from the table. we even ordered a second one to split. it was cooked perfectly, though the accompanying tomato salad was s bit blah.- the chicken. the one that's a half-chicken. get it. the cook on the chicken was perfect, the sauce was full of flavor, and the accompanying kale, potato, and pancetta hash was soooo good.- don't bother with the filet. It was a decent medium cook but was still tough and the sauce was bland and was a non-appealing shade of light pink. - tiramisu. this was yummy. light and airy, not dense like some variations. definitely a good pick, and i'm not typically a tiramisu fan.- skip the chocolate hazelnut cr\u00e8me brulee. yes, really. unless you just want a few spoonfulls of nutella. i mean, nothing wrong with that... but the burnt sugar top that lends a lot of depth to a typical standard cr\u00e8me brulee gets lost on this dish- it's textuarally pleasing, but that's about it. the best part was the small cluster of candied hazelnuts on top.overall not the best, but could've been worse. the food is decent, BYOB is great, and the location is convenient (especially if you're heading to helium comedy club for a show after dinner). service could really use improvement."], ["Alanna P.", "Really good antipasto and food in general - the lamb was cooked perfectly and we had a ricotta ravioli that was delicious.

I took my girlfriend here right before I left for job training in Chicago for a month and this was very memorable. I got the seafood pasta dish which was delicious and a very generous plate. The seating was the only difficult element of the evening, we took an undesirable table right next to the kitchen in order to minimize our wait time even though we had made a reservation in advance, this was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. However, they more than made up for it when they were unable to relocate us to a better table by giving us a delicious dessert on the house. This place is definitely among the top BYOB's in the city."], ["Abigail L.", "I really loved this place. The fact that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the dining area certainly adds a bit of charm and movie style ambience. \u00a0I went with some girlfriends and a few bottles of wine.

We called L'Angolo and made a last minute reservation, I think we may have snagged the last table. We shared a few apps, including an artichoke special. I am such a sucker for an artichoke special. It did not disappoint. \u00a0For my entree I opted for the gnocchi and omitted the shrimp to make it veggie. It was delicious. \u00a0Everyone else loved their entrees too.

They had no openings, but suggested L'Angolo's, which we didn't really know about. The staff promptly sat us after a brief wait, and we ate one of the best Italian seafood dinners ever.

Come hungry because it's a lot of food. Highlights of the meal were:- Mussels & Clams - the broth is tasty and great for dipping your bread - Beef Carpaccio - my first time having carpaccio.. I'm officially a fan.- Short rib ragu - my usual go-to, it never disappoints - Spicy crab bucatini - squid ink pasta was another first for me.. it had a nice kick to it and they definitely did not skimp on the crab. I loved everything about this dish!"], ["John K.", "When she first moved to Philly, the GF lived across the street from Varga. And while we heard great things about sister restaurant, Mercato, for some reason we never popped in, though we have been to Varga's other sister restaurant, Valanni. But with our good friends living nearby, we decided to finally stop by to celebrate my boy J's bday. And being that Mercato's BYO, we brought a few wines to start the night off. Dining inside is close quarters and homey. But we decided to gp al fresco and enjoy the late July breeze. We had plans to go out after, so apologies in advance for the camera pics (Samsung S6 Edge). Bread ServiceDinner started off with some Italian bread, along with whipped ricotta and olive oil with pepper sprinkled on top. Trio of Bruschetta [$12]We ordered two of the bruschetta to share among two couples. The 2nd came a bit late though because our server may not have heard or understand that we wanted two orders. That being said, the 2nd order did come out fairly quickly thereafter. The whipped ricotta and pickled watermelon was definitely my favorite, with the acid providing some balance amidst the rich, creamy ricotta. The chicken rillette with peas was nice, though the pears and figs ate somewhat sweet for my carnivorous tastes. Pan Seared Jersey Scallops [$30]Roasted eggplant puree, golden raisins, tomato agrodolce, arugulaWith the exception of the belly of this pig, the rest of the diners had the scallops. They were sweet, seared well, and nicely seasoned. The roasted eggplant puree provided some \"meaty\" undertones, but was balanced by the sweet and sour from the golden raisins and the agrodolce. Short Rib Ragu [$23.50]Ricotta gnocchi, broccoli rabe, shaved locatelli, truffle oilThe truffle oil was the faintest of faint and I was completely fine with that. I wasn't fine with the fact that the short rib was incredibly chewy and lacked any salt. The bed of broccoli rabe was a nice counterpoint to the heft of the beef, but again, there was a general lack of seasoning. The ricotta gnocchi were also a bit tough. Generally a disappointing dish. Despite the misstep with the bruschetta, service was good overall. Dinner was very relaxed and timing was great. However, I'll admit that I went away from this cash-only meal a bit disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were a bit high going in? I'll need to stop by again to give Mercato a fair chance, but in a city with plenty of BYO options, consistent execution is always appreciated."], ["Danielle B.", "A true delight! \u00a0Terrific space, attentive service, BYOB and excellent food.I suppose the only negatives are that the space is tiny, the tables are tightly packed and that it is cash-only."], ["Nat M.", "A good Italian restaurant that is intimate but not too small. It is CASH only and a BYOB.Nice menu with a good range of items. I went for restaurant week and they still offered specials you could substitute without any additional charge. Fantastic feature and it is not commonly done during restaurant week. I had the grilled artichoke, shared the meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, the lamb bucatini (special), tasted the short rib ragu (yummy), and had the tiramisu (really good)."], ["Lea T.", "Mercato is one of my favorite BYO Italian restaurants in Center City, but I've had to knock off a star after my recent visits. The atmosphere is cozy, intimate, and similar to a NY style restaurant. The earthy wooden tables are close together and I wouldn't recommend coming here with a party larger than 6. It is CASH ONLY and you can make reservations online at their website mercatobyob.com. They have a nice selection to choose from for restaurant week and daily specials are always appetizing. The pasta is fresh and the portion size is good, but I usually don't have leftovers. Unfortunately on my most recent visit my pasta was undercooked, the fish special was dry, and my meatballs were overcooked. I will come back, but this might not be my number one spot anymore. You'll start with sliced baguette and olive oil with ricotta. My favorite appetizers are the Smoked Mozzarella Stuffed Meatballs and Bruschetta Trio (which changes daily). The Whole Grilled Artichoke and Beef Carpaccio also seem to be big hits. The Short Rib Ragu is my favorite pasta, but the Pyramid Pasta is a nice option if you want something cheesy and indulgent. For meat dishes I would suggest the Chicken Alla Romana and Veal Milanese. Also a four course tasting menu is available for $48 per person."], ["Jess T.", "Had reservations for 8.30 pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in, there were plenty of tables open inside even though I didn't have options for an early reservation. We started with the mussels and clams. It was okay. We thought it was odd that the restaurant didn't offer any complimentary bread but later realized that they had forgotten. The squid ink buccatini with spicy crab sauce didn't disappoint however. It was really good with a good amount of crab for $24. They ran out of the duck ragu which we were interested in trying. The backup Lancaster chicken dish was solid but we probably won't be wanting seconds. The pistachio and almond cake which sounded intriguing was also nothing to shout about.I'm not sure whether it was because I'd been a little biased by previous reviews about lackluster service but we noticed the same. Our waiter was really nice but things were a little bit slow and we almost got charged for an extra entree. We were also seated nearly elbow to elbow with another couple because of how tight the space is so don't expect too much privacy of you're on a date.

No fancy customer service that are going to explain all the details of the menu and at the end you remember, basically, nothing. Menu was really good - just that the quality of it was not the greatest. The main i chose to get was the Spanish octopus which was tasty but way to salty.

This is my first stop, this BYOB. First tip U.S. Cash only but they do give you a reminder call when you make a reservation and let you know so that's a plus. We made our reservations early and were only the one of two tables in this intimate joint. I like small and intimate places so I don't mind. It got packed to capacity fast and the noise did not get too out of order so that also was a plus.The herbed butter served with the bread was tasty. Nothing exciting but it was butter...so it was great all the same lol.We both started off the first course with the Fontina Stuffed Meatballs. Excellent. Seasoned just right. Not overstuffed with cheese. Not too much or too little sauce. Just spot on!For the second courses I got the Pyramid Pasta. My BF got the Short Rib Ragu. My Pyramid Pasta was ok. I could taste the shrimp and lobster inside but it was overpowered by way too much Ricotta cheese in the stuffing. The brown butter sauce and pine nuts with asparagus helps cut the sharpness of the filling a little but it was still way too much cheese and way too little meat on the inside of the pasta. My date was satisfied with the taste of his Short Rib Ragu but thought the amount of short ribs in the entree lacked. Especially compared to the meatballs we just had as an appetizer. For Dessert I had the cannoli and he had the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Both excellent. Another plus for the restaurant week diner they had an additional menu they presented with items they included to go along with the restaurant week menu as well. Jury still out if we would or would not go back to try something else.

For entrees we tried the spicy crab bucatini which was pretty tasty and the ink noodles it sat on are certainly something different, but I don't think I would ever come back and pay full price for them. \u00a0I had the Pyramid pasta which sounded really delicious, but was really lacking in the flavor department, it all tasted very bland, needed more seasoning, and the chunks of lobster were chopped in pretty large chunks so some bites would have a huge chunk, and others wouldn't have any. \u00a0I thought it could've been done a lot better.Desert was definitely what saved this place, at least for my fiance. \u00a0The goat cheese sorbet with balsamic reduction was fantastic, definitely the best desert either of us have had in a while both from a taste and creativity standpoint. \u00a0The Tiramisu I had was good, but like the meal as a whole, nothing to write home about.Service:The wait staff was fine, polite and professional, our only comment was that it took a long time by US standards (2.5 hours for the whole meal) which isn't a big deal to us, but it is something to be noted.I think with a little more aggressive seasoning and flavors, this place could be top notch, but until then, it's just another pretty-good and slightly over-priced BYOB in Philly."], ["Arin S.", "I love Mercato!

He took the time to go over the menu with us and answer any questions that we had all while making us feel like we were in no rush to order (which was good because there were so many delicious options to choose from!). As someone who works in the service industry it's hard to find a restaurant that I feel has outstanding service. With that said, Ian surpassed both my boyfriends and my expectations and we would return here again just to have him as our server."], ["Megan G.", "I went to Modo Mio for the first time a few weeks ago, and absolutely loved it! We were able to get a last minute reservation the day before, which was great, and the restaurant was packed when we got there. We both did the prix fixe menu, and the price was pretty inexpensive, especially given that the place is BYOB.My first course was a seared scallop, and the scallop was cooked perfectly. I also had the pasta special with Tiger Shrimp, and the sauce was delicious. It came with about 4 pieces of shrimp too, which I thought was decent. The star of my meal was the fried steak. It was cooked to the perfect temperature, fried, and sitting in butter, and I ate every single piece. Also, the dishes seem small at first, but I was completely full by the end of the meal, so very deceiving. The only thing I did not love was that the restaurant was extremely small and loud, so it was more difficult to carry on a conversation. However, I would go back in a minute!"], ["Amanda G.", "I came here for New Years Eve dinner and was more than satisfied with the entire experience. We were taken for our reservation on-time, our courses came out quickly, our waitress (Marie) was outstanding (as was the rest of the staff that bussed our table, filled our water, brought our bread, etc.), and the food was spectacular. I really have no complaints about this - except to say that I was glad we were not seated in front of the door because it got stuck open every time someone new came into the restaurant. Not to mention that the price is definitely right here... a four-course meal for two people only cost $113.00. Here's a breakdown of what I ate in order from my favorite to my least favorite dish:1. Spinach and ricotta dumplings with a nutmeg brown butter. This was my favorite dish by far. The dumplings were essentially little gnocchis (the texture and heavyness was the same), but the butter sauce was SO GOOD. Guuuuhhhh I just want another plate of these right now.2. The mussels in a white wine sauce were my second favorite dish because they were the biggest mussels I've ever eaten in my life. Seriously. 3. Crispy pork tenderloin with beet and horseradish salad. This was essentially a pork cutlet (breaded) with beets on top. I didn't get much horseradish in this dish, but I liked it and was surprised how nicely the beets paired with the pork (I'm not a beet person).4. Butternut squash ravioli with pancetta and sage. These were definitely good, but they were sweeter than I was expecting, so it's primarily for that reason that they come in a little lower in my ranking.5. Veal with a mushroom cream sauce. This was good - it reminded me of a cross between beef stroganoff and veal Marsala. 6. Italian festival sausage with lentils and a balsamic poached egg. This dish was basically a crispy piece of sausage on a bed of lentils with an egg on top. I don't really like poached eggs or lentils, so that's why this is last (and also why my husband was the one to order this for himself!)For dessert we got a flourless chocolate cake and something else that I can't remember the name of. It was basically a white cake soaked in sambuca stuffed with ricotta cheese and some chunky bits that I can't decide were dried grapes or walnuts and then covered in a hard shell chocolate ganache. I liked both desserts a lot and was stuffed by the time we left. I would absolutely go back here!"], ["Kevin R.", "The same guys who brought you Monsu and Paesanos operate Modo Mio. This cash only BYO is a perfect fit for Northern Liberties. I highly recommend the tasting menu, not only for its great value, but for the diversity as well. We always get the same friendly waitress who makes you feel as welcome as family. The oversized bread loaf you see when you walk through the front door is not just an appropriate decoration; they serve this amazing carb monster along with a little soft cheese and olive oil to start. The four course tasting menu changes seasonally and on Sunday's they abandon the menu and serve up great Italian family style...come hungry and with a few friends to help you through this onslaught of yummy!"], ["Zach V.", "The four course menu is the way to go. \u00a0The portion sizes are small and I don't think ordering just one would be enough food. \u00a0That being said the four course menu for $35 is well worth it. \u00a0Our reservation was for 7:30 on a Saturday night. \u00a0We were seated immediately at a table just outside the kitchen. \u00a0The dining area is plain and has high ceilings. \u00a0 The tables are close together and it wasn't too comfortable for someone my size (6'2). \u00a0The outside temp was about 92 and it wasn't much cooler inside. \u00a0If I was rating the restaurant just on the food it would totally be 4 stars. \u00a0My girlfriend and I shared the mussels with a spicy red sauce. \u00a0They were very large, cooked perfect and the sauce was FANTASTIC! \u00a0I had to ask for more of their house made bread to soak up all of the goodness left in the bowl after we devoured the mussels. \u00a0I forgot to mention the complementary oil / cheese. \u00a0I love dipping bread in oil but the added cheese just took it to a new level.For my pasta course I had the Bucatini Amatriciana. \u00a0It was thick hollow spaghetti, pancetta, spicy plum tomato & pecorino romano. \u00a0The pasta was a bit under cooked but I still enjoyed it. \u00a0I do love my pasta al dente but this was a bit too tough. \u00a0I really did enjoy the flavor and salty pancetta. \u00a0After finishing the pasta my breaded pork loin with blueberry reduction arrived. \u00a0It was topped with fresh arugula. \u00a0This dish reminded me of a German Schnitzel. \u00a0The sweet and bitter flavors worked well together.Since the portions are geared for multiple courses I had room for a piece of cheesecake. \u00a0The portion was the perfect size to finish off the meal with out making my pants feel too tight.I will return again."], ["Matt C.", "Hmmm.....alright....Modo Mio. Modo Mio did so many things right, but did so many other things very, very wrong. Strap in folks; this is going to get interesting.Lets start with the positives. If we were judging on food alone, Modo Mio is a 4 1/2 - 5 star experience. Everything was DELICIOUS, and with the Turista menu, the servings (although small) filled you up without making you feel stuffed. I started with the Saltimbocca, which for the time being, comes with crispy sweetbreads instead of egg dipped zucchini. It was delicious; the sweetbreads were perfect, and the crab and proscuitto made for a well complimented complete bite. Next course was the lasagna verde. The flavors were really good, but the lasagna was mostly ricotta cheese, and it kind of took over the dish. Still very tasty. The main course was Bistecca Siciliana, which is the breaded grilled ribeye, fried egg, lemon caper butter, sopressata and provolone, which was again, delicious. Dessert was just a mix of the current samplings, but I didn't really partake. There were 9 of us, so bites were being shared and almost everything I tasted was really, really good. At $35 for the 4 courses, its also a pretty sweet deal. Food wise, I have no complaints, and can whole-heartedly recommend Modo Mio.....On the other hand, there were some big knocks on Modo Mio as well. First, IT IS LOUD! I'm talking, headache inducing, yell to be heard loud. The restaurant itself is very small, which amplifies the cacophony of noise going on around you. Our waitress had to employ this high pitched, dolphin like voice to TRY and rise above the din of the restaurant, that only added to the problem. Someone at the other end of our table told me to literally text her what I was trying to say to her because she just couldn't hear. Insanely loud. As mentioned, it is also very small. I had to apologize to the table next to us, as I had to make the difficult \"ass or crotch\" choice, as I scooted past to get to my seat. The tables are unfortunately at PERFECT ass height, so my butt was hanging over this poor mans pasta. Third, Modo Mio FORCES you to order the Turista option for tables of more than 6. (I actually talked to the owner about this; more on THIS important tidbit to follow.) It doesn't matter if you aren't really hungry, or if you are allergic to something, or don't want to spend $35 because you just want some gnocchi, EVERYONE at the table MUST get the Turista. It wasn't a BIG problem for us, as 7 out of our 9 wanted the Turista anyway, but I'm not sure its a great business decision to TELL your patrons what they will be ordering. Our 2 holdouts were emphatically just not going to be forced (they had a wicked perfect storm of restrictive diet \u00a0and crazy allergies) and were finally allowed to basically split a Turista, after a talk with the owner......About THAT; as our 9:30 reservation quickly turned into a 10 o'clock seating, we were pretty much the last group in the restaurant at the end of the night. As such, the owner Pete came out to talk to us. He came out with a huge glass of red wine and thanked us for coming out before asking how everything was. Pretty par for the course for an owner, but there were a few comments that he made that maybe I wouldn't have made if I was the owner of a customer service driven industry. Maybe the wine had something to do with that, but being somewhat of a shoot from the hip kinda guy myself, I brushed off the.....lets say familiarity of the comments......Then we went outside, where Pete came back out to join us and continue the convo. Without getting into too much detail, because I really do think he is a nice enough guy, Pete continued to make comments and jokes to a bunch of people that he LITERALLY just met 5 minutes ago. Perhaps the second huge glass of wine had loosened ol' Pete up a little further, but he was just firing off comments without really taking the temperature of his audience. It wasn't anything on a Donald Sterling level, but he was getting close, if I'm being honest. It all came off as a \"hey, see, I'm cool...I'm like you guys\" kind of vibe, but the things he said elicited a couple of \"wow\"'s and awkward, \"OOOOOOOOOOOOkay\"'s.The fact that despite the missteps, Modo Mio is a 4 star experience, speaks to how well they do the good things right. The food really is excellent, and if you can get in and out before having to deal with any extracurricular activities, I think you'll enjoy your dinner.PS, BYOB."], ["B.

I loved this place when it was Bistro Juliana but I must say like it even better under the new owners. \u00a0We started off with 5 apps: Eggplant Rollentini, Clams (vongole) in white, bruschetta, grilled calamari (a special), and stuffed peppers (a special). \u00a0There wasn't a scrap left! \u00a0Everything was delicious with the Rollentini and bruschetta being my 2 favorites of the 5. \u00a0Also, the bread they serve is very fresh, warn and tasty. \u00a0For dinner, I was debating between the chicken carciofo and the lasagna (a special last night). \u00a0The owner pointed out that I could have the chicken any night so why not go with the special. I am so glad I did! It was probably the best lasagna I have ever had. \u00a0My 7 companions were all more than satisfied with their meals as well.For dessert, 1 friend ordered Tiramisu, which I tried. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0The only downside to the entire meal were the cream puffs. \u00a04 of my friends ordered them and not 1 of them enjoyed them as they seemed overly stale (as opposed to the slight staleness they normally have). But I would never judge the place based on the cream puffs as they are not a dessert I normally enjoy anyway.Finally, the bill came and it was so reasonable that at first I thought they had somehow made a mistake. \u00a0Obviously, Eatalia being a BYO helps to keep the price down. \u00a0And an extra bonus is that they even though they are a small establishment (seats up to 32 by my count), they take reservations. \u00a0It's so great to have a restaurant like Eatalia in the Port Richmond/Fishtown area."], ["Bob W.", "Went on a Saturday night in March. Hard to find in the dark and the windows were so dirty you could not see in or out. Seated us at a table near the door. The door's automatic closer was broke so every time someone came in the door stayed open. A staff member or diner had to get up to close it but not after several frigid blasts of air came in. It is a small place but the decibel level was like riding on top of the Frankford el. Our waitress came over and literally screamed out the specials which were at least 7 items. Ya think they \u00a0would have them on a chalkboard or print them out \u00a0so you could really think about them. There are like 10 tables in there, how much would ten copies of specials attached to the regular menu cost??? They immediately served us a vegetable hummus which turned out to be the best thing we ate all evening. Unfortunately it was served with several slices of Amoroso's air bread. I ordered the ravioli which were ordinary and nothing special but the waitress talked me into a homemade meatball which came in as a golf ball sized meatball tasty but so overcooked when I cut into it in crumbled into dry pieces. My wife had the ricotta gnocchi with pancetta and alfredo sauce.The pancetta was not crisped but limp and rubbery and there was not enough sauce. The worst were the gnocchi which were bland and tasted like raw flour. Salads and appetizers were expensive so we passed. Did not stay for dessert, had enough by then. Two entrees and the bill was $45 plus tip...won't be going back!"], ["Julie D.", "I had dinner here for the first time last night and was very impressed. I made a mental note to post a review on here ASAP, because I wouldn't have even known Eatalia existed, were it not for Yelp! I live in Fishtown and, though I have some local favorites, I'd grown a little tired of the same old, same old. So I turned to Yelp for some fresh ideas, and saw several glowing reviews for Eatalia. I went in with a friend around 7:00 on a Thursday, without a reservation. We were greeted right away by the owner, who was very friendly and seated us right away. It's a BYOB, which I love (and there aren't many in the Fishtown area). While perusing the menu, we were brought a basket of warm bread and a small bowl of something they called vegetable presto. It's similar to a pesto, but made with zucchini, carrots, and several other vegetables. Absolutely delicious! I would have asked for seconds, if our appetizer hadn't arrived so promptly. The menu is extensive, and everything on it sounds delicious, but we decided to order from the specials. We started with a baked portobello mushroom appetizer. The mushroom was marinated in delicious (clearly high quality) balsamic vinegar, and baked with some sort of greens, sundried tomatoes, and provolone cheese. It was very light, in spite of the cheese, and was absolutely delicious. For my entree, I had lobster ravioli, which was served in a rose sauce with shrimp and lump crab meat on top. I'm ordinarily not a big shrimp fan, but these were cooked to perfection and I ate all five of them. The ravioli was fantastic, and the sauce was rich but not overly heavy. My friend had another of the entree specials, which was spinach gnocchi with a gorgonzola cream sauce. I tasted hers, and it was every bit as delicious as my ravioli. Portions are large, but not overwhelmingly so. We both brought home leftovers, and I'm looking forward to enjoying mine tonight. The restaurant itself is relatively small and unassuming. Like I said, I had no idea it was there until I stumbled upon the Yelp reviews. It's on Cumberland Street, east of Aramingo Avenue, and is so close to 95 that outdoor seating (which they do have) might not be the most enjoyable experience (though there was a couple seated out there who seemed to be enjoying themselves just fine). \u00a0The interior of the restaurant is very comfortable and unpretentious. I appreciate this even more now that I know how excellent the food is, because it definitely rivals the best/most popular Italian eateries in the city, and yet isn't at all showy about it. We were waited on intermittently by the owner and a very friendly server, whose name I didn't catch. They were attentive without being overbearing, and took great care in making sure we were satisfied with our meal. For the first 40 or so minutes we were there, it was just us and another party of two, so it was relatively quiet/intimate. About halfway through our meal, a large party of 15-20 people came in and were seated next to us. It got considerably louder at that point, but not in an obnoxious way. I think that Eatalia is going to be my new favorite Italian BYOB, and I'm thrilled that it's within walking distance of my house. I'm looking forward to taking my parents the next time they visit, and am sure it will soon become one of my staples."], ["Amy B.", "Eat here every few weeks, food is always excellent. Get the lobster ravioli, also had meat sauce with gnocchi on New Years and it was amazing! The veggie spread for the bread, I crave it. Really like the waitstaff, friendly and attentive.

I went to dinner with a few friends to Eatalia and consider myself an EXTREMELY picky eater. \u00a0I was a little skeptical because I had yet to hear about the place and it's a little off the beaten path. \u00a0However, if I would recommend any Italian restaurant in the city, this would be one of them. \u00a0I have been to La Viola, Gnocchi, Porcini, Modo Mio, and all of the top Italian restaurants and I can honestly say the food here definitely competes with all of them. \u00a0We started with the antipasta and I assure you it was extremely good and had an excellent variety. \u00a0Next was the crabcake. \u00a0I am extremely picky about crabcakes but this was EXCELLENT! Nice crisp outside and juicy lump crabmeat inside. \u00a0Definitely one of the best I have ever had. \u00a0From there, I had the Filet Mignon in a Fra Diavalo sauce. \u00a0I am sitting here today writing the review while craving their Fra Diavalo sauce. \u00a0EXCELLENT!We finished off with the Tiramasu and loved it. \u00a0They also definitely get points for the presentation!I think the difference between Eatalia and all of the other Philadelphia Italian BYOBs is that it really conveys that small, intimate setting that you crave when you go to an Italian restaurant. \u00a0The owner is waiting on tables, meeting with customers and makes you feel at home. \u00a0 You feel welcome and are not just \"another\" customer! \u00a0You can definitely tell that they are passionate about what they do! \u00a0This is definitely the type of place I see myself going to weekly to have dinner with family & friends. \u00a0If you are looking for a diamond in the rough, this is your place!! I'm just upset I didn't know of this place sooner!"]], "Vetri": [["John K.", "... Review continued ...Almond Tortellini with Truffle SauceDomaine Gerard Thomas, Bourgogne 2011Easily the GF's favorite dish - the almond tortellini were cooked perfectly al dente, redolent with almonds and crushed amaretti cookies, which added a nice textural sweetness to each bite. The truffle sauce helped to add an additional depth of flavor that was not overpowering. It was paired with the Burgogne, an aromatic and intensely fruity chardonnay. Spinach Gnocchi with Brown ButterPoggerino, Chianti Classico 2009My favorite Vetri dish is easily the spinach gnocchi with brown butter. The initial attack is all nutty cheese - Grana Padano and salty ricotta salata with hints of nutmeg. But then as the pillowy gnocchi envelops your tongue, spinach is readily apparent. The brown butter adds to the richness of each bite and it is at this point, I realize that the bite of spinach gnocchi alone is worth the price of admission. Truly a revelation of flavors. A perfect pairing with Chianti, the acidity and tannin in the wine helped to balance the heft of the gnocchi. Perhaps it was the Chianti that pushed it over the top, but it was at this point when I realized I was feeling the 'joy' involved with wine tasting.Pappardelle with Cockles and TardivoVie di Romans, Sauvignon 2009 \"Vieris\"At the halfway point, the pappardelle was presented to the GF. The GF was in love with the perfectly crafted and cooked pasta. And despite her wariness of bi-valves, she enjoyed the flavor the cockles lent. The raddichio helped to balance the dish and the pasta was paired with a sauvignon blanc that was intensely fruity, with a long full-bodied finish.Lasagna alla GiudiaVie di Romans, Sauvignon 2009 \"Vieris\"I received a decadent lasagna that contained baby artichoke and bechamel within baked pasta sheets. Parsley and mint helped to add an herbaceousness freshness to each bite. The crispiness of the pasta sheets helped to add texture.As with the GF's pappardelle, the lasagna was also paired with the Vieris sauvignon blanc. Ricotta Ravioli with Wild PecanYves Cuilleron a Chavanay, Roussanne 2012We were also simultaneously presented with ricotta ravioli with shaved wild pecans. The gossamer thin pasta was filled with clean flavors and orange zest helped to add a unique brightness that simply enthralled the GF. The ravioli was paired with Roussanne, which was redolent with honey and fruit.Milk Braised Lamb with Mint Anima Libera, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano 2007For our final savory dish of the night, we both received the milk-braised lamb, with the GF receiving the bone-in lamb. As expected, though not as tender as slow-braised lamb shank, the grassiness of this lamb perfumed each bite in an intoxicating manner. The milk braise helped to temper each bite along with the meaty cannellini beans, which the GF appreciated. The classic mint pairing offered a refreshing note as well.The lamb was paired with the Anima Libera, which was intense with spice, plum, and blackberry. Quite complex in its intensity, it was seemingly a nice choice for the lamb.At this point, we were offered the option of a standard dessert or the cheese plate. Despite our mutual love of cheese, we opted to go with a standard dessert in deference to the GF's sweet tooth.Blood Orange Sorbetto Honey, pistachioAs a palate cleanser, we were offered a blood orange sorbetto, which was heightened by the honey atop. For something so simple, the honey really added to each bite, with the pistachios offering texture.Piccolo PasticceriaWe were also brought a plate of piccolo pasticceria or mignardises. Clockwise, we were offered torrone with pistachio and almond, an apple button cookie, biscotti with chocolate, pistachio, and almond, chocolate-covered balsamic-vinegar chocolate, orange tuile with lemon curd, quince cookie, ricotta hazelnut cheesecake, and in the middle was a peppermint marshmallow with chocolate. A melange of various bites, the balsamic vinegar chocolate and the marshmallow were clear favorites.Elio Perrone, Bigaro 2012We were also served Bigaro, our favorite rose and a great way to end any night. We first had the tipple at Amis, so it was capricious that this sparkler made its way here. It was a refreshing and effervescent way to cap off the night, but in addition to a bonus pour from the staff, there was more to come!GM/Sommelier Bobby Domenick presented us with the entirety of panettone. As huge slices of panettone were served, Chef Adam Leonti himself came out to serve a heaping spoonful of sabayone made from prosecco - certainly a nice touch. And as expected, at the end of the meal we were presented with a take-home bag, replete with hand-painted menus and some almond coffee cake bites for the next day. Certainly come to Vetri Ristorante for the amazing tasting menu, but you'll find yourself returning for the unparalleled service. Kudos to the entire staff!"], ["Samuel M.", "Fine Fine.

It was a performance, we never lived that before."], ["Anthony N.", "***Marc Vetri's Vetri serves rustic and good Italian cuisine utilizing high quality ingredients, but it lacks the finesse and truly delicious cuisine of fine dining Italian restaurants like Quince (San Francisco) and Spiaggia (Chicago)***Vetri is one of the most renowned Italian restaurants across the country. \u00a0The restaurant has a small, rustic and neighborhood feel, but it features the tasting menu-esque approach and amuses of a fine dining restaurant. \u00a0I had several courses at Vetri and while I liked a good number of them, I left not enjoying Vetri as much as other upscale Italian fine dining spots I have been to like San Francisco's contemporary Quince and the traditional but still delicious Spiaggia in Chicago.My dinner at Vetri started with a series of amuses including crudite with a strong balsamic dip. \u00a0There was also a plate of assorted bites including sheep's milk cheese, a vegetable tart, cured pork, and foie gras with brioche and fruit paste. \u00a0The bread offerings included a standard sourdough and a very good and unique semolina focaccia, which had a texture and flavor similar to Yorkshire pudding.The first course was a very rich sweet onion filled crepe with truffle fondue. \u00a0The fondue was creamy and aromatic and the kitchen did a great job reducing down the onions so that it almost became like a marmalade.The fish course was Mediterranean sea bass with a crispy skin (as well as flaky and moist fish) paired with a lemon and fava bean risotto. \u00a0It was a simple but good dish.Two of the pasta courses I had were signature courses at Vetri. \u00a0There was soft and pillowy spinach gnocchi in a brown butter sauce. \u00a0The nicely cooked gnocchi was topped with a good Parmesan to contrast the sweetness of the sauce.I also had almond tortellini filled with rice. \u00a0The pasta was good and I liked the truffle sauce, but having pasta filled with rice was kind of odd because of the starch. \u00a0The consistency of the rice grains was also a little unusual for a pasta filling though maybe this is common in traditional Italian cuisine.The third pasta course was not a signature Vetri item, but it was an exceptional dish and my favorite of the night. \u00a0It was a dry pasta (durum pasta shells) sauteed with porcini mushrooms and escargot. \u00a0It was interesting having the escargot and mushrooms together because they had similar textures. \u00a0With the pasta being a mushroom pasta too, there was a great mushroom flavor throughout the dish and the flavor of the mushroom went really well with the escargot.My main course was a young goat over polenta. \u00a0Like a lot of the courses at Vetri, this course was very simple and only featuring 3 or 4 flavors but impactful flavors (though definitely not the elaborate courses you get at some of the more modern fine dining restaurants). \u00a0Like the fish course, Vetri handles proteins well here. \u00a0The goat was juicy and had a great crispy outside. \u00a0With the crispy outside and juicy, and easy-to-shred meat, this goat was a lot like crispy duck confit. \u00a0And like a lot of duck confit dishes, the goat here was overly salty.The cheese course featured a good variety of cheeses including goat cheese and a good blue cheese as well as garnishes like buttery milk toast, local honey and strawberry jam.The palate cleanser was a cool and refreshing raspberry sorbet topped with honey and a fresh raspberry.The main dessert was a molten cake-esque chocolate polenta cake with good vanilla gelato. \u00a0It was a simple but still satisfying dessert. \u00a0In addition, really exceptional to-go biscotti was provided at the end of the meal.Service was great--very, very nice staff and the food came out at a good pace.The dining room had a small and intimate feel (it felt very much like a neighborhood restaurant and not a stuffy and/or luxurious fine dining restaurant).Prices were high. \u00a0Though a lot of the food is rustic, Vetri is charging fine dining prices. \u00a0The menu approach is a tasting menu, but they show you a menu of the dishes available that night so that you can urge the inclusion of some dishes while also picking items you would like to avoid.While I enjoyed a lot of the food at Vetri (especially the excellent pasta with escargot and porcini), I left a little disappointed. \u00a0A lot of it had to do with expectations. \u00a0I was expecting Vetri to deliver the creative Italian cuisine of Quince or the simple but distinct, delicious and make-you-want-to-keep-digging-into-what-you-are-eating flavors of Angelini Osteria, but Vetri was a noticeable notch below both of these restaurants. \u00a0Vetri is definitely a good Italian restaurant though I am not sure I would say it is one of the country's best Italian restaurants based on this one visit.I am not sure what the parking situation is in this neighborhood."], ["Shefali V.", "So we spent $600..

Then we received bite size starters from the chef, including fois gras. This was followed by our four course tasting menu - my favorite item was the gnocchi ravioli, it melted in my mouth.

This meal was everything I hoped/dreamed/planned/anticipated it would be.Let's preface this by saying that I, probably like most people who dine at this restaurant who aren't oblivious and or obnoxious, was anticipating the event for all of the days approaching it. Also, being the self proclaimed Philadelphia/generalized food snob/poor person that I am, have been coveting a meal here for some time. It was worth the wait and anticipation in every way.I honestly didn't want to read too many yelp reviews beforehand because I wanted it to be kind of a special surprise in a way that many of my preplanned and exceedingly researched meals are not.We walk in at reservation time, waited about 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready, and meanwhile offered (a couple glasses) of complementary sparkling wine. I didn't mind the wait, lets put it that way. Our table right next to the front windows was set far apart from the others-there are not too many seats in this restaurant. Crusty bread, appetizers, vegetables with an amazing balsamic cream sauce, house cured olives-this is just the \"before the actual courses come out\" offering. After that, we were both treated to 5-6 different plates each (aka, I ate maybe 11 different dishes that night). Highlights were most definitely some of Vetri classics. They are classics for a reason. Sweet onion crepe is unreal, as is the spinach gnocchi. I appreciated the sweetbreads dish and all of the pasta courses I ended up getting. What a lucky girl I was that night.The dessert before the dessert as well as the actual dessert were just perfect. And by that point I was way over indulged to even pay attention to what I was eating. Just kidding, that would never happen. If you dine here, you are obviously either treating and or being treated by a very important person/business partner/client/special event etc etc etc. Make the splurge and get the fancy wine pairing. Yes, the fancy one. Whatever they're calling that these days. Or, make it even more exciting for you and your date and do one of each wine pairing. Either way.

I am not sure if I would pay that much for this experience since I can't eat a lot in one sitting, but my friend said she would do it again."], ["Revital Y.", "My husband and I were treated to dinner here by dear family that spare no expenses. We received a glass of champagne upon being seated, not sure if this was complimentary or not. However, I am sure that it was a great start. The waiter came over, gave us water, bread, and explained how things work, asked for any food restrictions (which annoyingly we had plenty of; kosher style, pescatarian, no pork or shellfish, and the lucky one among us- my husband- who has none and gets to eat EVERYTHING). Like I said, annoying and slightly complicated but our waiter got it. The food started coming out slowly, steadily, and pretty generously. I have to say, I don't remember the exact combinations of our dishes, but I do remember that the homemade pasta was incredibly tasty and cooked to perfection, every vegetable we had was incredibly fresh, meat was incredibly tender, wine was delicious, and dessert was brought out double, because we got it like that. Not really, because I asked ever so nicely for more macaroons. The service was one of the best parts and the ambiance very nice and homey. Our waiter was hysterical and very personable, the chef came by our table too which is always a nice touch. This is more of a \"we're here celebrating something\" or \"tonight is a special evening\" restaurant. A real treat."], ["Cynthia X.", "My BF took me here for my birthday, and I had such a great (and filling) time! I had been suffering from a lot of arm issues at the time, and the meal made it go away for a few hours! I love how if you go with a group, each person gets a different dish on the item each time. My BF and I shared everything so we got to taste more dishes! and the dishes wouldn't stop coming! I was already so full after the gnocchi / ravioli course. Then, it was followed by more pasta! and meats! (At one point, I was secretly hoping the food was stop because my stomach would literally bust.) I took the petit fours home, and had a delicious snack the next day. 1 star off for the price / plating. Call me a snob, but I just wasn't a fan of the plates / cups they used. Reminds me more of a family style casual Italian restaurant rather than the \"fancier\" experience that I was here for and paid for."]], "Amis": [], "Fiorino": [["Ryan B.", "Fantastic service, incredibly nice staff, and delicious menu! Minestrone soup is hearty and big, and the cheesecake was fantastic. Waiter Brought us out some limoncello which was a nice touch, and was very fairly priced overall. Quaint tiny restaurant though, definitely make reservations - intimate seating right next to your neighbors, lucky we had a friendly couple who were talkative but respected our space/conversation."], ["Jon S.", "Friend and I decided to have dinner here and I called at start of week and made reservation. On Wednesday my friend asked if we could push it back an hour. So I called the place and the gentleman said sure and made it 6:30. On the night of we were running a bit late and called ahead to inform the restaurant and the woman answering could not find our reservation. Seems the gentleman deleted my reservation without adding new time. The woman told us to come anyway and that they should be able to accommodate us. They were able. I ordered the clams with spaghetti my partner ordered one of the specials. Our food came incredibly quickly. We didn't even have time to touch the bread. The spaghetti and clams was alright, but I wouldn't go back for it. The special, my friend ordered, was amazing. It was a stuffed pasta that was packed with flavor. For desert I ordered the tiramisu, after having a delicious one in new York recently I was worried this one would not live up to par, but it did. The flavors were balanced and it was the highlight of my meal! The environment was cozy and quaint and filled with a more elderly crowd. When the dining room filled with patrons it became hard to hear my friend. I would recommend going earlier for a more intimate feel if the idea of a crowd is off putting."], ["Su W.", "This place is officially the best Italian restaurant I have been too. This place is a good for date nights, celebrations or just casual dining. You can easily get dressed up here or come in wearing jeans, both are acceptable and fitting. On to the food...You get complementary bread with marinara sauce. The sauce was literally the best sauce I've had with bread. It was so good that my friend and I finished it all!I started off dinner with the caprese special. To be honest I only came to this place because I saw the picture of the caprese and it looked so good! The tomatoes are fresh and grown in a garden near by. You can really taste the difference between an organic garden tomato and one that has been treated with chemicals. This is a must try dish. For the entree I decided to go with the season scolgio and my friend went with the veal special. The veal dish was creamy and cheesy! I thought it was a little too salty but my friend thought it was perfect. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area. There's a reason why this place is rated 4.5 stars"], ["Maria-Elena T.", "This is a true neighborhood gem. I am putting it in my permanent rotation!It is BYOB and they immediately helped open the bottle of wine we brought. The evening started with a complimentary bruschetta with diced tomatoes. Very yummy! Then they served a delicious Italian bread \u00a0with matainata sauce for dippingI got the grilled calamari for an appetizer. I enjoyed the arugula salad on the side better. My friend got the eggplant rotini, the special that evening. They were amazing and deserve to be on the regular menu. \u00a0I only got one bite and it was difficult to hold my fork back. I wanted to get the Branzino special but I was craving pasta. \u00a0For my main course I requested a trio of pastas: the gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce, the tagliatelle Bolognese, and the cheese ravioli. Wow and yummy! The gnocchi were like eating clouds. They melted in my mouth. I never met a cheese ravioli I didn't love. The service is personal. The chef visited our table and chatted far longer than an obligatory stop. We liked that and enjoyed his conversation. When it came to them calling us a taxi, they went beyond caring and stood outside to wait for it and hold it until we came outside. The place is small and on a Saturday night, and as expected, packed. I had made a reservation ahead if time on OpenTable so we were good. ."], ["Chris S.", "So, so authentic! Our new favorite place, next to \u00a0Modo mio!Seafood salad incredible! Tortellini pasta was unbelievable...can't wait to go back!"], ["Bryson V.", "I have a rule- No Eating Italian Out! \u00a0 Simply put, nobody can cook it better than I can. \u00a0We've been here twice now, both times for date night- and it doesn't get better than this, Frank kills it! The first time we went we sat outside, and enjoyed the beet salad (which was crispy, crunchy, bitter, and sweet). \u00a0Beets aren't normally something I'd try, but based on the other reviews I felt like I had to. \u00a0I was not steered wrong. \u00a0The caprice salad is delicious too. \u00a0The mozzarella was fresh + salty, and the tomatoes were dense, and crunchy. \u00a0It was perfect. The Main courses were perfection too, and reminded me of everything my nona made growing up. \u00a0While I could write an essay on them- I'm hesitant to do so. \u00a0All I can say is eat at Fiorino- seriously!"], ["Danita R.", "Gosh I love a hidden wonder, and this li'l nook is harboring some mighty fine food in a super sublime atmosphere. I (luckily) work nearby and finally had the pleasure of popping in for lunch. Everything was delicious. I have to admit that I felt some kind of way about being the only diner in the place who disregarded the BYOB (I mean, it is Monday and I was on my lunch break. Le yada.), but otherwise, the service was exceptionally pleasant despite the sudden rush.There aren't a lot of tables, so it gets pretty cozy inside, but everyone was jovial, and when they're serving food that's so deliciously fresh, how could they not be? I had the soup of the day which was a lobster bisque. I've been on a bisque kick lately and this bowl kept the streak a-flowin'. Rich, creamy and flavorful. I also got the eggplant rollatini, and that. was. scrumdiddlyumptious! Clean and happy plates abounded. I'm tickled to have a new go-to lunch spot in my midst. If you're in East Falls, head on down Indian Queen and stop on in!"], ["D A.", "My only reluctance in giving this review is that more people will learn about this culinary gem located in East Falls. I would prefer it be mine! and mine alone! There is not a thing wrong with this place: the food, the service, the intimacy of a true Italian restaurant - all excellent. AND, It's a BYOB! Franco, the owner and chef de cuisine, makes occasional appearances in the dining room to make sure his offerings are being well-received. Enjoy."], ["Peter N.", "Amazing. Italian. Restaurant.The food here is fresh, prices are reasonable, and it is BYOB!Upon seating, we're presented with bruschetta followed by complimentary bread accompanied with a flavorful tomato based spread.Went here for the first time and I might've gotten carried away with the seafood. But it was well worth it.We ordered the grilled calamari as a starter and it was grilled to perfection. I could not get enough of it. \u00a0I will definitely get it again next time I return.For an entree, I had the spaghetti scoglio and it was a plethora of seafood over spaghetti. Personally not a fan of spaghetti pasta, but the seafood was extremely fresh and wine sauce very flavorful. I even found myself dipping the bread into the sauce.... repeatedly.My friend had the Adriatic Salad, which was also very good and carb watcher friendly. \u00a0Again, tons of seafood and even lump crab on top, perfectly tossed over a bed of greens. \u00a0See the pics attached \u00a0- Words can't describe how good it is!For dessert we opted for the lemon cake, which was a special not on the menu. \u00a0Moist and paired well with the raspberry drizzle.When we received our check, we were also offered complimentary limoncello! \u00a0What a way to end a fantastic meal!The restaurant is located in a somewhat residential area, so parking might be tight. \u00a0And seating is very limited (see pic), so I'd suggest reservations."], ["Scott L.", "While everything here was thoroughly enjoyable, I can't say that it was particularly exciting. The highly recommended bolognese fell flat. The eggplant, however, had much more vibrant flavors. The complimentary bruschetta and refilled bread baskets were a nice touch. I particularly enjoyed the tomato tapenade. However, I felt that these, as well as the caprese, would have benefitted from some olive oil of a higher quality.Finally, I was perplexed about the whole limoncello situation. The table next to us received \"the best limoncello they've ever tasted\", yet every other table didn't, despite ordering dessert. What is the deal? Who do you have to screw to get some limoncello??? The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth."], ["Dan L.", "Howdy Folks!Another impressive showing Friday night from Fiorino. My last visit to this discreet East Falls gem has propelled it to the top of my exclusive Philadelphia Italian restaurant list.First, we made reservations on Wednesday and were rewarded with a great corner table by the window. Next, we didn't see the appetizer we had during our last visit on the menu (prosciutto with mozzarella and tomatoes), so we asked. They knew just what we were talking about and provided it for us. I don't know where they're getting these tomatoes but they will knock your socks off. My GF had the tagliatelle bolognese for her main. It was a very thick and meaty bolognese that paired wonderfully with the thick noodle. I had the veal bocconcini with spinach and mozzarella rolled inside. It was served with some great veggies and shockingly tasty potatoes. Capped the night off with a great homemade tiramisu.Will certainly be back."], ["Trish L.", "This was an incredibly charming neighborhood eatery. Had a delicious lunch here on a Friday. It was empty when we arrived at 1 but others who seemed to be regulars came in later. The salads and pastas we all had were good and the owner was very nice. It did take the food quite a while to come out."], ["Erin H.", "Cute little romantic byob tucked back on a little side street in East Falls. We had several apps, entrees and desserts and all were wonderful! \u00a0Some favs are the seafood salad, eggplant rollatini, Branzino and mango gelato. Each dish is made to order so bring an extra bottle with you, it's totally worth the wait!"], ["Matt K.", "I was in town on business and looking for a place to eat relatively close to my hotel, which was not so wonderfully located. \u00a0 What a find in Fiorino! \u00a0I called first, just to be sure they could accommodate one at 8pm on a Monday evening. \u00a0The gentleman with whom I spoke told me to come on by. \u00a0 The restaurant is in a fairly residential neighborhood with narrow streets and lots of parked cars. \u00a0At first I worried that I wouldn't find a spot, but there were several just down the block. \u00a0When I arrived, I was greeted by a woman who asked if I had just called. \u00a0 I really appreciated that she knew that, that the man who answered the phone \u00a0had communicated about it. \u00a0They had a table ready and waiting for me, which I also appreciated. \u00a0What a fabulous, quaint restaurant. \u00a0From start to finish everything was just great. \u00a0 The space is small, so the suggestion in other reviews to make a reservation is a very good idea (and precisely what prompted me to call first, even though it was 8pm on a Monday...). \u00a0I started with the mussels marinara, which were very good, and I used the fabulous fresh bread to mop up the extra sauce. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0There were many wonderful sounding options for dinner and I settled on the branzino, which was cooked very well, and accompanied by potatoes and mixed vegetables. \u00a0For dessert I had the zuppa inglese (rum cake), which is one of the desserts they make at the restaurant, and it was fantastic. \u00a0I was fortunate to strike up a conversation with Kathy, my server, as she was not only great at her job, but also lovely. \u00a0 Whenever I'm in Phila I will make a point of eating at Fiorino. \u00a0It was truly a fantastic experience."], ["ted z.", "Good local Italian restaurant with Mediterranean flair.Byob makes it even betterGrilled portobello with smoked mozzarella was excellent starter.

My boyfriend is a big Yelp person and had this place bookmarked for a while, so I checked out the reviews before we went and was prepared for a pretty awesome dinner. However, that's not really what I experienced.We were running a little late because of traffic and I called to let them know (which they said was fine). We get there and let the waiter know we had a reservation and then he disappears into the back for a few minutes. He comes back out with a place setting or two and walks past us and I followed thinking he was seating us. But he walked outside to another table full of guests...so I awkwardly went back inside to wait. We were left standing at the front of the restaurant for 5 minutes or more just waiting to be seated. Keep in mind this place is small and there isn't a good place for you to wait so we were just awkwardly standing in the way. We weren't really greeted or told it would be a few minutes...I was feeling uncomfortable from the start.We finally got seated at a nice table, but then sat there for another 5-10 minutes without anyone coming by. We finally got menus and were ready to order but had to wait a while for someone to come by. Once they did, we ordered but then I had to ask for something to drink because they never asked me if I wanted anything. We didn't bring wine since we were heading to the movies afterward, and that seemed to surprise the owner. Once we ordered, our food came out very quickly. It was delicious, I will give them that. But the whole experience was so awkward and uncomfortable. I felt unwelcome and couldn't wait to leave.Not sure what happened during our dining experience since there were so many good reviews on Yelp, but I was not impressed and will not be returning."], ["John H.", "Haven't been here yet but I plan on going."], ["Doris V.", "Had an amazing dinner experience. \u00a0Food was excellent. Service was great. Felt like we were dining in someone's home in Italy. \u00a0Cannot wait to come back!"], ["Anh H.", "Homey BYOB in East Falls. The food is superb and consistently good. Everything on the menu is fantastic. However, if you're looking for a place to have a conversation, expect to raise your voice. It does get busy and loud. If it's a nice night, just sit outside and enjoy your company. It's definitely quieter."]]}
