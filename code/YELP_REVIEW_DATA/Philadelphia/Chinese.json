Rice, Gai Lan (Chinese Broccoli), and beef. What could go wrong? The vegetables were fine. The rice was fine. The beef, oh my goodness!So one of the ingredients used when cooking Chinese dishes that has meat, is Shaoxing Wine. In this case, too much! It was as if I was eating beef dipped in wine!

The General Tso's chicken is what makes this place the go-to for work lunches, my boss and coworkers can't get enough of it. It's sweet and salty, very deep flavor, a bit fatty but still delicious. Just a pro tip- the darker the color, the more flavorful it'll be!The salted fish and chicken fried rice is a personal choice, as I've been eating it since I was a kid and this place does it quite well! And the fish with okra is another request from my coworkers, the fish is cooked really well and is quite tasty. The problem with that dish is that nobody would want to eat the okra, so we've recently decided to have them put Chinese broccoli on the dish instead of the okra, and suddenly it's become as popular as the General Tso's!The food is very tasty but also quite heavy, so be prepared for a food coma if you come here for lunch. The bathroom (which I've never been to, thankfully) is apparently not for the weak-hearted, and the environment would completely throw me off if I came here by myself, which is why this place only gets 4 stars.

The food came out fairly quickly and both dishes hit the spot. Its going to be hard for me to order anything else next time because these two dishes were so good. The wings were perfectly crispy and just salty enough. I couldn't stop eating them. The Dai Pang Chow Mai was light and flavorful, sweet and tangy.

Seafood Fried rice, Sate Beef Ho Fun, and whilst deciding what soup our waitress suggested Seafood & Tofu soup. \u00a0We ordered that & she said \"that's enough\" which gave us a chuckle. Food came out amazingly fast; soup in like 5 minutes and entrees 5 minutes later. Soup was amazing in its deliciousness & simplicity. \u00a0I ate 3 bowls and we still couldn't finish it. Fish (flounder) was breaded and fried and went well with the chinese okra & delicate sauce. Fried rice was basic, but had that great flavor & texture you want. The Sate beef ho fun was great as well, got it dry as opposed to sauced and my only complaint was lack of heat(none at all) when it was noted as hot on the menu.Noodles were great consistency & the beef was tender.Service was good. Received wrong dish, squid instead of fish w/ okra and waitress corrected it after saying some unkind words in Chinese to other one who took the order.This is basic Cantonese fair, done extremely well, with a few Szechuan dishes. Tried the Chicken w/eggplant in Garlic sauce on a return visit which was incredible! If they do use msg, I don't think it's much because I am sensitive to it, but did not get a bad reaction.Do not let the surroundings fool you; the food is delicious, fast, abundant, and the prices are cheap.

They actually keep this place relatively clean. There's no decor to speak of other than a Chinese calendar here and a picture there, but they did install a few giant fans just to make sure their customer can be comfortable in hot weathers. This place specialize is stir fried noodles. The beef chow fun is probably one of the most authentic thing you can find in the entire Chinatown. My favorite item is not even on their menu but you can ask by name is the \"Dai Pang Chow Mai\" or Stir-Fried Rice Vermicelli Dai Pang style. It's thin rice noodles, stir-fried with eggs, shrimps, barbecue pork, pickled vegetables. It has a wonderful balance between salty, tangy goodness with silky textures from the noodles.

Next came my dish, and quite a bit later, the wings. \u00a0Kid's entree's were timed pretty far off, but they were happy munching the slightly salty almost tempura (but not as crisp) wings, served so hot we had to slow down a little.Hot tea was provided along with styrofoam cups, as was water when requested. Service was quick (very), but polite and our English was easily understood.Sweet and Sour chicken, as indicated elsewhere was a stunning version of a tired classic \"Americanized\" dish. \u00a0Tender, moist breaded breast, drizzled but not drenched in a sweet and vinegary sauce. \u00a0The General Tso's on the other hand, was VERY garlicky and had a lot of sort of sour brown sauce. \u00a0The chicken was chewy thigh meat, and the breading soggy. \u00a0 One dish to avoid.My duck and pork served with tender bok choy atop a huge mound of white rice was un-sauced. \u00a0The pork was delicious loin dusted with five spice. \u00a0The duck, what little was actaully consumable was quite good, but one the bones were removed, I suspect the actual skin and meat would have filled a tablespoon. \u00a0For five bucks and change, though, I'm not complaining.Son did not finish his General Tso's so I ordered another round of dumplings (six large to an order) for the ride home. \u00a0Bill came to $41 before tip (after being whacked 15 to park.)

I will put my food credentials in jeopardy and go the opposite route: This is in defense of the sweet and sour chicken ($8.50), if only at Tasty Place.Yes, the Chinese mock us for our very 'Muricization spin on it. And our own cultural elites deride us and fumigate us with a dizzying heap of scorn: \"You know they don't eat this in China, right?\" they'll ask us, which inevitably leads to \"You don't know how to use chop sitcks?\" and \"Can you stop saying 'me so horny' every time we come here, Zac?\" Smug PC police, I tell you.This is not your hours-old, mall food court variety of sweet and sour chicken that's carelessly ladled into an equally lifeless styrofoam container. Not here. Here is a sanctuary for judgment-free bites of golden nuggets fried to a smokey blister. Here, a flaky shell of awesome envelopes the chicken and breading.

It also takes 15 minutes to prepare from scratch, which is plenty of time for you to get over any preconceived notions.The rest of the menu borders on good to amazing, especially for a place that allows cigarette smoking and MSG in its kitchen. Salt baked chicken wings ($8.50), any of the ho fun dishes (heh! Also: $5.50 - $6.50), and positively anything with char siu (Chinese BBQ pork, basically) are worth some of your first considerations.

Upon entering we were greeted by our server and seated in one of the restaurant's small pick of tables. We shared the Duck Wonton Soup, Roast Pig, and Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce. All classic and delicious.The Roast Pig, in particular, was the pick of the lot. Succulent, boneless pork surrounded by a skin crispier and more flavorful than a plate of cracklins. Their menu is expansive but Ting Wong seems to do soup, duck, and pork the best. A simple glance at their front-of-house kitchen (lined with roast ducks, pork belly, vats of meat broth, ribs, and more) quickly confirms this hypothesis. One interesting note from the LaBan article--the Chicken Wonton Soup is supposed to be excellent. Apparently Ting Wong, everyday, gets fresh, live chickens from the local poultry shop to make their soup. And while the Duck Soup was great, the prospect of FRESH chicken (as in living that same day) is too good to pass up.

So since they don't deliver we had to take a trip back and when we got home found out they gave me a pint (small) wonton soup on the side so I felt like I've been rip off when indeed I paid for large. \u00a0So when you pick up your food make sure you check to make sure all your food is there to prevent any issue like me.

We inquire to the manager and she quickly yells \"it coming, it coming.\" Meanwhile, the one party that arrived 20 minutes after us has now opened their fortune cookies, paid, and left. The kicker is that they appeared to have ordered the same or similar dish (sesame chicken or general tsos - same dish, different sauce) as us. Perhaps they're ability to communicate in Chinese allowed for quicker/better service (?!?!) Again, interesting. Moving on. The sesame chicken finally came out.

Any request we made seemed to be met with hostility and a sense that we were bothering the staff. Our party felt very unwelcome. Native speaking guests, however, were getting hugs and smiles upon entrance. For some, I would recommend it and believe the service would be great.

I've typically had mu shu served with the pancakes on the side so I could assemble myself.... here they do it table-side for you. one order = 4 chinese burritos. noms. the price point is super reasonable, and this place is a nice alternative for vegetarians and those who keep kosher... and the meat-eaters won't have anything to complain about."], ["Michelle S.", "The Pros: \u00a0The food was really good, and it was way cheap. \u00a0You can seriously get stuffed here for around 15 dollars. \u00a0The vegetarian prawn and vegetables was phenomenal.

It's fairly nondescript from the outside but when I finally went in, I really enjoyed the meal I had here. This is one of the few Taiwanese restaurants in Chinatown. \u00a0It has a very clean feel and one of the walls is a huge glass window that looks out onto 10th street, so there's plenty of natural light and sunshine.I tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. \u00a0Just under 7 bucks, steaming hot, a very generous amount of beef, and very flavorful. \u00a0(Maybe a little too flavorful actually, I found the broth a teeny bit on the salty side) \u00a0I wouldn't have minded a little more of the veggies but still a great portion size for the price; I had leftovers for later. \u00a0My friend tried the Indonesian curry and really enjoyed it. \u00a0The curry itself was a little on the watery side, but we weren't sure if that's the nature of Indonesian curry itself or how it was prepared here. \u00a0Best to avoid ordering from the lunch special menu even though those items, like General Tsao's, may sound more familiar to those who don't know a whole lot about Taiwanese cuisine, b/c those are distinctly Americanized dishes. In fact, my friend was originally going to order the Hunan chicken lunch special and the waitress actually asked if she was sure, adding that those are Americanized dishes. \u00a0Obviously if you know Chinese, now's the time to bust it out with the waitresses but they speak English really well too, at least from the exchange I heard between the waitress and an English-speaking patron. \u00a0I already have my eye on the pork chops with rice (sounds fatty but heavenly) for my next trip here, and sometime I'll try the oyster pancake appetizer too.The only drawback, which is a minor one, is that there's only a single restroom and it looks like a broom closet converted to a bathroom b/c it's so narrow.

They deep fry the chicken and the sauce is a little bit to thick for my own choosing but to each it's own. \u00a0They give you free tea and water which is cool. The staff could've been a bit more attentive. They also seem disorganized a little bit. We had three different people come to our table to give us food or clean up our dishes.

Small details, but some places in Chinatown can be a dodgy about these things. The service was quick, pleasant and helpful, the waitress serving us gave me her recommendation on which smoothie was the best. The mango smoothie definitely was a highlight of the meal, the lo mein I ordered was satisfactory but I was most impressed with the smoothie and frozen watermelon ice. $3 each, which I think was quite reasonable. The smoothie was served in a cute glass, and it was really quite good, and I'm a bit picky about smoothies. (It wasn't one of those depressing smoothies filled with ice and disappointments)Yes, there are places in Chinatown you could get food a bit cheaper (but really, not by much, it's quite reasonable), but I was quite pleased with the meal and the feel of the place.

They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.Taiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.Beef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.Service is fine and friendly. Their English isn't great, but it's fine. I did have to explain several times that I wanted the rest of my food wrapped up to go. This was a bit icky, but when they put my leftovers in, they included my chicken wing bones.

The waitress with a short pixie haircut is more of a moody character. Another memorable feature is their amusing and cheerful music selection.Since going vegetarian, the lunch options for me are scant. The service is also slow and forgetful at times.

That doesn't mean the food was bad though, but the three cup chicken was absolutely delicious!The moment the large clay pot of three cup chicken arrived, our table was engulfed with its luring aroma.

The flavors, textures, and colors were on point. My one complaint is a big one: there weren't any whole oysters in the pancake.Beef noodle soupAlthough better than your standard Chinese beef noodle soup, the broth lacked depth. The beef was so tough I couldn't bring myself to eat it. The pickles were excellent. There were no tendons.Wonton soupThe plump wontons were filled with pork, shrimp, and mushrooms. The wontons were served in a clear broth with seaweed and Chinese vegetables. Overall the dish was good, but the cook was a little heavy handed with the sesame oil. Special tofu and meatballsThis was on the Chinese side of the posted recommendations. The dish consists of tofu stuffed with meatballs and stewed. It looked and tasted very homemade in a bad way.

It didn't taste at all of oyster, and instead of the thick, slightly sweet, sauce that topped it, itself a gooey mix of rice, egg, and whatever else was in it.

Zha Jiang mien was good - although the pork seemed a bit salty (kind of the point, I know, but a bit too salty). The Indonesian Curry chicken was really, really good.

I thought I might have need an extra appetizer, turns out I took half my meal home with me. I ordered the peking noodle with meat sauce for $6.75. It tastes a lot than it sounds. The portion size was bigger than my face. Tip #2: Their Taiwanese meatball isn't the type of meatball you're use to. It's actually a very tradition taiwanese dish, I was surprised to find it on the menu, I haven't been to many restaurants that sell it. Its sort of like a Chinese pork bun, except the outer layer is made up of tapioca flour and starch. It has interesting texture if you want to try it out. I for one thought it was pretty good.The prices are actually a lot lower than I expected for a family style restaurant. Each large entree is around $10, at most $15.

I found the Chinese version to be less salty and lighter, the Korean versions I have tried have more of a dark, hoisin \u00a0flavor.

I would describe it as a cold noodle dish with spicy peanut butter sauce instead of the spicy minced pork noodle dish. The dry pepper was really good. Very spicy and crispy. Wish it could have more chicken than the breading. I would definitely come back here again for lunch or perhaps order take out."], ["Huamei Y.", "My, oh my, Philly you are doing it right these days. I'm so happy to see more Asian restaurants open up with trendy decor, about time they get on that bus!Although you can walk 0.5 miles east for food that is half the price of Dan Dan, you cannot deny the great service and ambience Dan Dan has to offer.I came here on a tuesday evening around 5:30pm and there were only a few people here. The restaurant has an open loft concept, so noise levels can be tricky. The bar is in the middle of the room with a few small tables against the window. We had a reservation and we were led upstairs where there was additional seating.Being a huge spice and noodle fanatic, I had to get the dan dan noodles. My friend and I also ordered the twice cooked fish. Fish is amazing if it's cooked right with the szechuan flavors, so I had my expectations up.The service was on point - the waiters were very friendly and honest about their opinions when I asked about their recommendations. They were not too pushy and they definitely paced the meal well. The noodles were peanut(y), which had a kick! I was pleasantly surprised. The fish was tasty, as for the sauce, it reminded me of black bean sauce. Nonetheless, paired with rice and the noodles, we were pretty full at the end of the day. The portions were just right!I'd still prefer going to chinatown, but I'd recommend this place to anyone who just needs their szechuan fix in Rittenhouse!"], ["Allison B.", "Had a tasty meal here. Some of the best scallion pancakes I've had. Eggplant, garlic chicken, dan dan noodles and dumplings all flavorful and yes of course, spicy.

It just. ain't. right."], ["Michelle C.", "I, much like I'm sure everyone else, was incapable of eating here without comparing everything directly to Han Dynasty. And you know what? I was still hugely impressed. Let's break it down.The dan dan noodles: Fantastic. Seriously. I think they may be on Han Dynasty's level, and may even be slightly spicier.Pork belly burger: This is basically a pork bun, and it's *really* good. And at $4 each it makes for a really great appetizer.Double cooked fish: This is where Han Dynasty wins, but barely. The fish at Dan Dan isn't deep fried like at Han, which I would imagine makes it healthier. If you care about that sort of thing, get your DCF--a soon to be well known acronym I just made up now--here, otherwise get it at Han.I'll need to sample more of the menu before I can know for sure how Dan Dan truly measures up to Han Dynasty, but if you're in Center City and seeking Schezwan, they're a safe bet."], ["Stone Z.", "I was surprised by this place in CC. I would argue that taste wise, this place is better than Han Dynasty. The authenticity of the dishes are excellent.The spice of their spiciest dish was a very pleasant numb for me. If you like spicy food I highly recommend trying their beef and tripe starter. IMO that is one of their best dishes. I have eaten a lot of this traditional Chinese dish called \"fuqi fei pian\".Their Dan Dan noodles tasted very authentic as well. Traditionally Dan Dan noodles are a poor mans food but they have made it into a classy dish.I don't really like the plates they gave us for the food because I felt like it was too small but it is very classy."], ["Dennis L.", "This was a fancy and kind of pricey Taiwan/Asian fusion joint \u00a0in Rittenhouse. The fact that they had a Taiwanese menu was what pulled me in. I sat at the bar and ordered a few of the smaller dishes for myself. I started with the Scallion Pancakes, Taiwanese Hamburger, and some Taiwanese minced pork rice.The food was really good. The reason for the stars was the cost for so little. Value wise, meh....The scallion pancakes for $3.75 were okay, but I don't think they were really anything special.The taiwanese hamburger was 4.75 i think and it wasn't really that filling. Don't get me wrong, the meat was delicious and it had a great flavor, but again the price...The best value may have been the small bowl of minced pork rice, which was actually chunks of pork cut up and thrown on the rice, so that was better than just minced/ground pork. The flavor was good, but could've used a bit more sauce to let it soak into the rice."], ["Alice J.", "The scallion pancake was really good. The dan Dan noodles came out within two minutes after we ordered it and it felt like the noodles were just sitting pre made back in the kitchen....the noodles itself felt soggy. The beef tripe soup was flavorless and bland. The dumplings in hot oil was good but the dumpling was lacking meat.... It was the saddest dumpling I ever had. I rather go to Han dynasty."], ["Jeff H.", "There's a buzz def hanging in the air around Dan Dan in the heart of Center City Philly and everyone I know who has been there just likes it. The Philadelphia Inquirer restaurant critic recently rated their signature Dan Dan noodles as only average. \u00a0Say what?? \u00a0They're not average!....they have an excellent consistency and are very tasty with a spicy kick. \u00a0I love the Dan Dan noodles at Han Dynasty and I like these as well. \u00a0The ground floor bar area is cool and the popular dining room is upstairs. \u00a0Service was very friendly. \u00a0So with its prime location near 16th and Walnut Streets, Dan Dan Noodles is a good bet wherever you're eventually heading to in Center City."], ["Carrie B.", "We went on a Sunday night after a movie, and were surprised at how busy it was at 8:30pm. Overall it was A-OK. Dan dan noodles were great, crispy cucumbers, excellent tofu dishes, as well as chicken. But, and I don't really want to say it, my husband and I most likely will go to Han Dynasty next time. The ambiance at Dan Dan isn't great- it's bright, chairs are hard, tables are tight, and the food is so similar to Han Dynasty. Why not just go to a place with a little more personality and comfort? That being said, maybe it's better during the day for lunch when expectations are different."], ["Enid C.", "The smartest thing this place did was call itself Dan Dan. This city is in love with that dish thanks to a certain Mr. Han Chiang, so that was a pretty clever move.The food is decent, though they sometimes lean on the side of salt rather than flavor. The prices are also rather high for the amount of food you actually get. It also legitimately bothers me when a Chinese restaurant claiming to serve authentic Chinese food is primarily staffed with servers who do not know the Chinese names of the dishes they offer. (some things I just don't know in English!)It's probably the best Chinese food you are going to find in Center City, but I'd rather hike the extra few blocks and hit up Handy Nasty (see: City, Old) or cross the Schuylkill and visit Chili Szechuan (see: City, University)."], ["Hoang T.", "Heard about this place through the Philly food grapevine. I'm not the biggest szechuan fan but i do enjoy trying new Asian restaurants. My expectations are always lower when ethnic restaurants establish locations in \"higher-end\" areas of the city (any city). My friend and I work near here so we decided to try it out during lunch...we were scared the wait would be long but fortunately, we were a party of 2! Ordered the Dan Dan, bao (hamburger), and ginger scallion fish (white sauce). I haven't had Dan Dan noodles in a long time, but i thought the noodles were overcooked, a weirdly large portion which messed up the meat ratio, and lacked scallions/onions on top which provides additional crunch texture. The sauce wasn't what i remember a \"good\" dandan is suppose to be. Between two people, we couldn't finish it (it also has something to do with the large portion). I will say, i'm on a low carb diet, so i get full off of carbs easily. \u00a0The bao was pretty expensive--$5 for one. I guess that's KINDA comparable to NYC's ippudo's baos (2 for $9). But Dandan's bao wasn't that good. The only part i liked was the bao itself, nice fluffy, hint of sweetness. The filling just didn't do it for me. THe pork belly was good, but the garnish and sauces just didn't go well together (in my opinion). The ginger scallion dish with the fish was the least szechuan dish. It actually tasted more cantonese which isn't a bad thing. It was actually the best dish out of the three. I wish there was more fish. There was a bed of bokchoy (my favorite) and the sauce was very nice and not too overwhelming. misses-served lukewarm/cool tea-basic white rice was not good and lukewarm. -service was good then kinda fell off at the end (10+ minutes for check). this should be addressed during lunch hours since workers have limited lunch time."], ["John K.", "Regular readers know of my love for all things Han Chiang and his empire of Han Dynasty restaurants. So when I heard former managers Kevin and Catherina Huang opened up a spin-off in Rittenhouse, I had to check it out. The connection? Catherina Huang is Han's sister! Sure the Sichuan dishes are all there, but how does DanDan set itself apart from Han Dynasty? In a nutshell, the spice level seems tempered for the Rittenhouse crowd.And to be frank, the GF was all about that because unlike me, she can't handle the heat! I kid, I kid, but let's go on it with it shall we?Dan Dan Noodles [$7.95]Han Chiang has \"famously\" (jokingly?) stated that he didn't trust Westerners with mixing their own noodles. So in similar fashion, DanDan mixes the noodles tableside for you as well! Toothsome with great texture, the dish had sweetness from the peanut dressing, with some light spice that hits you in the back of your throat. Could have used a bit more of the crisp pork bits and I'd personally opt for more spice, but this was perfect for the GF. And for less than $8, it's quite the portion. Ask for a bowl of rice and this could easily be lunch with leftovers to boot.Fried Vegetable Potstickers [$6.95]The potstickers were great, with a nicely crisp exterior despite a wonderfully gluttonous wrapper and a good melange of veggies within. The dipping sauce was sweet with a lightly spicy kick.Pork Belly [$9.95]Sweet garlic chili oil Obviously, I had to try DanDan's take on the pork belly app I love. These were spot on with a huge portion of thinly sliced roast pork belly. The chili oil was more sweet than hot and provided the necessary seasoning for the pork. With a bowl of rice, I was pretty much set. Cumin Pork [$12.95]Stir fried, bell peppers, dried peppers, onions, cilantroWe also decided to try the cumin pork, which featured lusciously porcine strips crusted with cumin. This was mixed with onions and bell peppers with bite, with the spice coming through from the dried Sichuan peppers. The cilantro provided a nicely herbaceous element to the dishDanDan's a great addition to the Rittenhouse area and is certainly tailored towards the neighborhood's tastes. That's not to say that they can't bump up the spice level to meet your Sichuan-spice needs! And the service? Wonderful! Our server Cati was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. DanDan should be getting their liquor license soon and their first floor is centered around the bar. It'll likely be a hot spot for happy hour, with a side of their eponymous noodles!"], ["Komal D.", "I love Han Dynasty, and now there's a spin off from it? Yesssss. This place has a modern feel, its super clean, and has an extremely friendly staff. There was a couple next to us that wanted a few dishes explained to them because of their strict diet and the chef came out to help them figure it out.. talk about awesome service. Looking at the menu, its very similar to Han Dynasty. But its basically the same cuisine, so I guess its expected? The only major difference I noticed in the menu is that the food isn't as spicy as Han Dynasty [which I personally appreciate]. They also give a nice hot tea, which isn't super sweet so it helps cleanse the palate so you don't have a lingering spice taste all day. Okay so onto the dishes... Dan Dan Noodles [I had to]Similar to Han Dynasty and oh so delicious. They bring a decent size bowl out of noodles and mix it up for you tableside so each and every piece is covered in an amazing combo of a slighty sweet peanut sauce and a spicy sauce. Each bite has a sweet peanut taste that ends with a nice spicy kick. Veggie PotstickersAbout 5 green potstickers, fried, and stuffed with a light yet tasty filling. The sauce was amazing... I could taste the fresh ginger and garlic with every dip! The only downside to these was the oil... like superr oily. I almost wanted to ask for a napkin to blot these [like i do with all my pizza! ha]Chicken in Garlic SauceWe just ordered this blindly because I wanted to try everything on the menu and couldn't decide... and I'm so glad we randomly chose this. This dish is packed with flavor but it isn't super spicy. I don't know how they did it, but it won me over. A little bit of rice mixed in with this saucy dish made for a perfect lunch.Wonderful service, food, and ambiance. These guys are doing it right. If they keep it up, I can see this place being very successful. Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu."], ["Mary M.", "I want to give this place a few more goes before giving it 5 stars but it is well on its way to becoming my favorite Szechuan place in Philly...even more than Handy Nasty!Wonton soup dumplings were so ON POINT.

Unfortunately they were already out of gua bao, which I had really really wanted.The cumin pork was perfectly spiced with nicely cooked tender pork with pieces of still crunchy bell pepper. a bit on the oily side--but I would definitely get it again. The 3 cup chicken reminded me of home--it definitely veered a bit on the sweeter side but was a nice balance to the cumin pork. The soft shell crab was a bit of a disappointment--unevenly battered and missing that msg/pepper/umami flavor.Oh? And the dan dan? I'm sure because they were churning out large quantities of it--the noodles were a bit soggy and I wish there were more little pork bits. Good. Not great-yet.

The interior is nice and sleek, very airy and open with a nice loft/second floor for seating.As part of their opening promotion, I got to try the Dan Dan noodles, which were great. Better than Han Dynasty? Probably not. Maybe as they keep tweaking and developing their dish, the two dishes will begin to diverge into their own separate entities. For my entree, I tried the Cumin Tofu, which I loved. The tofu was extra crispy and packed with delicious and smoky cumin flavor. It was a very large portion, so I brought half of that and half of the Dan Dan noodles home with me. Looking forward to leftovers!Service was slow, but good-natured. The wait staff was a little all over the place - trying to manage the host stand, trying to take orders, as well as learning their new computer & reservation system (is the dinner rush the best time?) From what I could see, everyone was trying their best but everything was a little frantic and misguided - and it was only about 5:30pm, I can't imagine how they currently handle a packed restaurant.So, i have good feelings about Dan Dan.

E.g., the Spicy and Sour Ribeye Pot was honestly bland. And not spicy, even though it was marked with four (spicy) dots. The Garlic Sauce Dish (with beef) was the best of the entrees, but don't you think it's strange when the bamboo has the most flavor of all the components of a dish. The Scallion Pancakes were slightly dough-y and just not up to Sakura standards (my new favorite spot for scallion pancakes!). Even the rice (jasmine) was a little dried out (though I liked that they had a rice pot up on the second level, so they could serve from there--they said they could give us more if we wanted it).Probably won't go back unless some fellow Yelpers follow and tell me it's improved.

The pork belly, which was served with a bean sauce, leeks, hot peppers, and fermented black beans, was crispy and well done. However, I felt like the portion size was a little bit small, and while I didn't finish my dish (leftovers galore!), it definitely would have been small to share and didn't have enough meat to make it feel like a substantial dish.

All of the seating on the first floor is by the front door, and the hostess stand is towards the back of the room (huh?). There is absolutely no waiting space, and only room for one person across to move or stand between the bar and the hostess stand. So while you're waiting to speak with the hostess on a busy night, servers are constantly asking you to move aside so they can access the front tables. But there is no room to move without backing up the line of people waiting behind you! I got up close and personal with no less than five servers in my under 3 minute wait to speak with the hostess. You are \"welcome\" to hang out at the bar while you wait for your table, but there is absolutely no room to do so. The bar seats are reserved for diners, and there is literally no room to stand with a drink. Every single space downstairs not occupied by bar or table is filled with server foot traffic. With only two of us, we were easily seated upstairs. But I watched a group of six with a reservation get squeezed into a table for four with three chairs squeezed in each side. Food was good enough.

Like most of the other restaurants on trendy 13th street, Sampan serves small plates to be shared. The menu is not updated on the web page but the dishes we had were as follows. My apologies for not knowing the complete names....Lamb Satay - This was my favorite dish of the night. The lamb was tender and moist and had a nice grilled taste. It was more Mid Eastern then Asian, but delicious all the same!Chicken Bao Bun \u00a0- We really liked this dish, the chicken was crispy.Duck Fried Rice - This was excellent, lot of great flavors.Miso Mahi Mahi - This had some delicate favors and was very good.Korean Fried Chicken - Not bad but we have had better. This was lacking something for me.Crab Tacos - These were just OK, no one really loved this.Muscles in Coconut Pineapple Sauce - The broth for us was better then the muscles but the whole dish didn't really work for us. The serving size in terms of the amount of muscles was good.Pad Thai - Miss on this. I understand it is Sampan's take on Pad Thai but this dish didn't come together for us. It was a tad too spicy alsoChicken Dumpling- This was very good, I think General Tao chicken, but not sure. Our server was great by the way, very helpful and attentive. If we only ordered the stellar dishes, Sampan would get 4 or 5 stars but based on our mixed bag of testing, a solid 3.5 stars. Sampan is a bit pricey also. Our check was about $180.00 for 5 people and only one dessert, a sake and a beer."], ["Alyssa R.", "The best happy hour food!! Seriously the prices and quality of food at happy hour is amazing. No wonder it's always so packed to try to get a place to eat then. Not sure where to begin. The Brussels sprouts are out of this world. Usually need my own order. The Kim Chee fried rice is also absolutely amazing. Generally everything is great here it's just such a great deal at happy hour definitely worth going to if you can make the time. Graffiti bar in the back in a nice option, although music is always so loud hard to have a conversation. The front tables outside are also on happy hour. Which is great now that it's nice out.

There was a small misunderstanding soon after we arrived but Amber, the hostess, immediately moved us to the kitchen bar and then personally took care of us the entire time we were there. She was beyond wonderful. The manager, Jared, also made sure that we were taken care of perfectly. We ordered the Shrimp and Lobster dumplings as well as the Korean BBQ Beef. The BBQ Beef was so amazing that we took an additional order to go so that we could enjoy some more when we returned to our hotel. In addition, Amber brought us an order of the Edamame Dumplings, compliments of the house, which were incredibly delicious.We also enjoyed a couple of rounds of the Citrus Dream cocktails. They were exquisite.The decor and atmosphere are very soothing. The place is beautiful!Amber and Jared are a huge asset to this restaurant.

Their food prices during happy hour are unreal. Sitting at the graffiti bar on a nice day is also an awesome perk. Kim chee rice $4?! I love almost everything on their menu.

I used to live across the street and was definitely a frequent flier at this fantastic place.

So many options for dishes and you get to try so much! Some personal faves: kobe beef fried rice, edemame dumplings, pork or chicken bao buns, crispy spicy shrimp, soy glazed sea bass, and the beef short ribs. Plus they have the most adorable baby ice cream cones with homemade soft serve in two unique flavors each night....obsessed with these obviously and you will be too once you try them. Also check out the kitchen bar if you're going in a party of 2, lots of fun to see the food being cooked (serious talent back there)!!Ahh writing this made me hungry...I need to go back! The only thing I've had here that's less than amazing is the Korean fried chicken satay...but I'd try it again and double check.

The most expensive meat dish (the steak) was the length and width of two fingers. It was over cooked, despite me ordering medium rare, and barely had a taste. It was tough, tasteless, and way too small to garner the $24 price tag. The vegetables were hard, cold, tasteless. The other most expensive meat dish (the pork - $21) was okay, had more flavor, still a bit over cooked, and a small dish, but at least had a bunch of noodles so you could fill up. They tasted like they were doused in salt \u00a0The shrimp pad Thai was tasty, but had literally 5 pieces of small baby shrimp on the entire bowl. For a $16 dish, I expect more than that. The crab tacos were good but didn't taste like crab. They tasted more like mayonnaise, hardly any crab. And there's only 3 for $11. The Edamame dumpling was good, but again, a very small portion.The chicken bao bun was okay, again very small portion. The koren BBQ steak skewer was okay, again very small portion. $95 plus tip for a meal that left us barely satisfied and most of which was poorly cooked or just OK doesn't leave a good impression for me!

The thick bun PLUS the breading on the chicken just makes it kind of a clunky and rather bland single note---the complete opposite of the delicate and crazily flavorful dumplings.The crab wonton tacos were not as magical as the dumplings, but there were tasty and had a spicy kick (and I'm generally not a spicy fan). And the more i ate, the more I liked them. You may feel a need to over-order bc the portions are so small. \u00a0I did and shouldn't have.

My cocktail tasted like fruit punch which I was able to drink in less than 10 seconds. My waiter didn't even get a chance to turn around and walk away before I finished my drink and immediately asked if I wanted a second overpriced $12 drink that contained no liquor. He then proceeded to not split our checks correctly (there were only three of us.) If you want good Asian food that is not insanely overpriced go to china town.

Just wow. I came here for date night on a Friday night and first of all, let me say that it is a VERY good idea to make a reservation. This place gets packed.

We waited about 15 minutes for the table and got a dink while we waited. Once we were seated, the waiter promptly came up to us and explained how everything works, since this was our first time. He was friendly and knowledgeable but wasn't too pushy or sales-y, which I appreciated. The menu was very simple but everything sounded amazing. We decided to try the chef's tasting, which was $45 a person, but it was well worth it. We were able to pick 1 thing from each section on the menu and it was the perfect spread. The courses came out perfectly timed and I can't remember the last time I had food this good.I'm really picky and judgmental, especially for higher end restaurants and this did not disappoint.

In the back, there's graffiti bar who gets crowded easily but people do not mind standing and enjoying their drinks. They have amazing deals not only on the happy hour menu but also on their dinner menu. Chef's tasting it's $45 per person. On the happy hour menu, I usually love to order the pork and edamame dumplings, kimchi fried rice and a glass of wine for $4 bucks. I can guarantee that anything on the menu is exquisite.

They offer the chef's tasting menu at a discounted price during restaurant week. However, they made us order collectively such that we could only order 7 dishes of appropriate portions for the table instead of being able to pick whatever we wanted or even 14 different dishes. I absolutely loved the Brussel Sprouts, the Chicken Bao Buns and the Korean Fried Chicken. I also enjoyed (for most part) the Peking Duck which comes with delicious Scallion Buns but I found some pieces of the duck to be too rare for my liking. If I were to come back here, I would skip out on the Pad Thai, which was kind of bland.

It's a good place to come with a date or a friend to share plates and have some wine or beer. You can order about $20-$25 of happy hour food and it serves as dinner. I like to order the kimchi fried rice, it comes with shrimp and a fried egg. You can get skewers of shrimp, beef, or pork. I like the lobster and shrimp dumplings, the edamame dumplings, the crispy Brussels, and pork belly sliders. Really you can order almost everything and it is very good. I came here for the $45 tasting menu and I feel like we ate the whole menu. I think the tasting is an excellent deal. I really liked everything we ordered except for the pad thai and the dan dan noodles(nothing compares to handy nasty!). I would go back and do the tasting again right this second if I could. The little ice cream cones at the end of the meal are adorable. Staff is great, knowledgeable and non-obtrusive.

As I tried some new dishes, I realized that most of what I had was more of a three-star than a four-star rating.We had the steamed pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes again, and they didn't disappoint. This time, we also ordered a dish of seaweed, which was really salty--it made the tea taste sweet. The seaweed and egg soup was also on the saltier side, but not as extreme. Although it's called an egg drop soup, it looks like the cut the egg into strips after it was cooked to resemble the seaweed more. Although it was more visually appealing, the egg tasted a little hard. One thing I do enjoy about the soups I've tried is that they aren't thickened. We also tried the sweet potato cakes, which were fried and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and filled with red bean. While I did like them, they were too greasy for my taste.Overall, the dishes here tend to be too salty or too greasy for me. However, the staff here are always super-friendly, prices are reasonable (this meal was $20 including tax), and complementary tea is always a plus. This isn't my favorite place in Chinatown, but I don't mind going with my boyfriend when he's in the mood for some dim sum."], ["Ilikeboa C.", "Read all the reviews about how awesome their soup dumplings was and got all excited. We ended our trip in Philly with a taste of China and left a bit discontented.The experience and the service was overall \"ok\" but I guess the overhype of the food killed it especially when a long tiring day did not meet its reward.We ordered soup dumpling and YangZhou(Yueng Chow) Fried Rice.The dumplings had too much dough and it was a bit hard to chew off the top. I am not sure if their vinegar sauce was specially made like most other Shanghainese cuisines, this place gives you a bottled vinegar. Usually Shanghainese cuisine serve the vinegar sauce in a cup with ginger and they tasted so darn good with the soup dumplings. Obviously it was not the case here.The soup part of the soup dumpling was so plain I thought I was tasting water.YangZhou Fried Rice came with a big portion and I was so full that I couldn't stand straight. I was full but felt empty. The dish tasted plain and nothing like what I had before. I appreciate the fact that no MSG was added but at least pour some salt or something.This review might be a bit biase since I am never tried \u00a0their dim sum.

However. The service. Rude and belligerent to the point where I actually thought the server was joking. Unfortunately not. We had difficulties asking about the types of noodles they had (apparently the fact that we didn't know the Chinese names for a flat rice noodles vs vermicelli rice noodles was something we had to decipher for ourselves instead of him just indicating which one we could get, this took maybe five minutes to negotiate with him). At the end of our meal we asked for the rest to take home, which they gladly complied with, however when we requested a second plastic fork they refused. I mean, what does a plastic fork cost you, a penny!?! I couldn't believe it. Anyway. All up our bill was around $32 including a tip the server didn't really deserve.

And it's about time since I've walked by Dim Sum garden, like, a million zillion times.So, a zillion years ago, I tried Dim Sum while living in Chicago and I hated it. It just wasn't that good, leaving a friend and I sitting there asking ourselves \"Is this what non-Americanized Chinese food tastes like or does this just suck?\". I remember the best thing from that meal being a turnip cake, otherwise, I felt like this vegetarian was mostly left hung out to dry. The cool little cart didn't even make it better, either.Although I still don't have the answers to these questions, I am so happy to tell you that everything I tried tonight at the Dim Sum Garden was delicious! I found myself here after a friend suggested that we and three other ladies meet here for dumplings before a show at the Union Transfer. For around $15 each (with tip), all of us gals shared the bok choy, scallion pancake, and a whole lot of dumplings! We all left feeling pretty full and pleased with our food. I'm going to go ahead and say that the scallion pancake was the most tasty for the price ($2.50), but the bok choy was something I could eat an entire plate of (theory almost tested: I shared, but it was mostly all for me). The dumplings definitely held their own. Between the shrimp and the veggie, I couldn't declare a winner because they were so equally good. I might have liked the veggie quite a bit because someone ordered theirs pan fried, which made them a little special. I recommend trying both steamed and fried: each method of preparation gives each variety of dumpling a new taste. Definitely try the different sauces at each table, too, which were soy sauce blends of deliciousness.Our service, the food, and the prices are all great.

I've been here multiple times, and have willingly sacrified cleanliness and service for some bomb soup dumplings. HOWEVER. There is still a LIMIT to the disgustingness and horrible service one can handle. First of all, we arrived with a party of 6 - maybe a bit large for this tiny joint, because things seemed to have fallen apart after we arrived.1) They left used napkins on our chairs. Not wanting to touch them, I tried to ask a server for a napkin so I could get rid of it, but nope, expecting them to merely hand me a spare napkin was too much to ask. I eventually had to walk over to another table to get a napkin. 2) ONE person ordered out of the six, which apparently terrified the server because she ran away and never returned. After the ONE person ordered, ALL HIS FOOD CAME OUT within 3 minutes, which would've been pretty awesome...IF ALL OF US HAD ALREADY ORDERED. Basically, he began eating his food before our second person even ordered.3) When we got a different server (yes, our server had disappeared off the face of the earth), she decided to take our menus before we even ordered. I had to remind her that only ONE of the 6 of us had ordered and took the menus back.4) After ordering our soup dumplings, she brought out one plate at a time, which is fine. HOWEVER! While we were eating out of one of the plates, she came by with the second batch, and placed them ON TOP of the one we were eating out of. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! 5) While we were searching for any server to get our check at the end, I witnessed the main worker work the register, then wipe her greasy forehead, walk over to the kitchen, and pick up the food with her BARE HANDS and place them on plates before serving it to the table next to us. Honestly, Sakura's dimsum might be a little more pricey, and a little too clean for when you're in the mood for cheap Chinese food, but it is definitely worth it if you're avoiding the risk of getting hepatitis/food poisoning/frustrations from the filthiness and stupidity of Dim Sum Garden."], ["Isaac N.", "Loved it! \u00a0We visited Phili last week and went for dinner. \u00a0The service, hospitality, food, flavors and price everything was Awesome. \u00a0I highly recommend them. \u00a0Don't forget to try the dumplings."], ["Cort M.", "Service was excellent. \u00a0Dumplings with soup inside? \u00a0Try them...you will love them. \u00a0We also had shrimp dim sum and scallion pancakes. \u00a0We each had a bowl of soup, one beef and one chicken. \u00a0We were stuffed and couldn't finish all the soup. \u00a0The broth was just right. \u00a0Didn't need to add a thing. \u00a0Added the ginger sauce to the scallion pancakes and then went from excellent to brilliant. \u00a0 We will definitely eat here again if we return to Philly."], ["Seema F.", "This place is very overrated, which is strange since it's a dingy little place under the overpass by the convention center bus station. It's not really a a dim sum restaurant like the name suggests. The actual menu has standard Chinese fare and the dim sum menu has about 18 items, many of which are not even dim sum (scallion pancake, french fries, and a fried chicken and fries combo?!)

The shanghai siumai was very interesting--it was a purse shaped dumpling, rather than the standard siumai shape, filled with what appeared to be rice and meat. \u00a0The juicy bun was about the best thing there, but with the tiny plates and spoons, it was difficult to eat without spilling everywhere. \u00a0My only other complaint is that the tables have chili sauce, ginger sauce, and dumpling sauce, but no soy like all the other dim sum restaurants seem to have. \u00a0I like all those sauces, but I really need soy for certain dumplings.Overall, it's a ok place to grab a dumpling while waiting for the bus. \u00a0The juicy dumpling was good, but it is nothing I would go out of my way for."], ["A R.", "Just wanted to update, I am told that the business receiving the good reviews closed in 2013 and another place opened with the same name in the same location. \u00a0The review I left is for the new business"]], "Buddakan": [["Peter N.", "Good take on Asian Fusion. \u00a0Buddakan keeps the food somewhat traditional, and adds flair to the dish as opposed to a full on twist.

We always leave feeling completely stuffed and in food heaven but this time we were mildly underwhelmed and bummed that we hadn't switched it up and gone somewhere else. Maybe our expectations were too high.. or maybe the place has just lost its flair. Either way, 3.5 stars seems appropriate.We had a reservation on a saturday night and were seated a few minutes after arriving. I wish they wouldn't seat people who make dinner reservations in the lower bar area.. I would much rather prefer being in the dining room atmosphere than feeling like I'm at a lounge but oh well, not the end of the world. After ordering drinks, we started perusing the menu-- we were so excited, like kids in a candy store! Too bad this was short lived. We started with 2 appetizers, the tuna pizza ($16) and the rock shrimp bao buns ($18 with one extra). We have gotten the bao buns before and they are really good. The shrimp are crispy and spicy and the bao buns are fluffy. We opted to get 4 instead of the 3 it comes with (really, an appetizer with 3 pieces when most parties are 2 or 4 is just another way to make money!) which tacks on an extra 3 bucks to the price. It's worth it though to each enjoy 2 of them. We usually get the edamame dumplings as a second appetizer but we decided to try something else, so we got the tuna pizza. BIG. MISTAKE. This was completely bland, uninspired, and so disappointing to eat that we *almost* said something to the waiter (but I hate complaining, so we didn't). Ugh it was so boring that I'm having trouble remembering it to write about. Now to the main courses..We got the sea bass ($36) and the sizzling short rib ($26) with a side of wasabi mashed potatoes ($9) for our main course. The sea bass was delicious, tender and flaky.. melts in your mouth. The short rib entree was subpar. The ribs were extra fatty and pretty unappetizing. We have gotten the short rib dish there before and it has definitely changed over the years.. it used to be amazing but it has definitely changed for the worse. I'll give them that the noodles that it came with were very flavorful.. I would have rather had a whole plate of those than any of the short rib! The wasabi mashed are usually one of my favorite parts of the whole meal, but even those didn't seem as creamy and spicy as usual. We did get dessert because I needed a pick-me-up after the underwhelming meal we had. We got the trio of sorbet which included coconut (yum), butternut squash (gross), and chocolate (good). Butternut squash should stay in the vegetable category.. not sweet enough for a dessert. Overall, a bummer of a night. We will not be back for our next anniversary, sorry Mr. Starr!"], ["Paul G.", "Was in Philly this weekend and we went to Buddhakan to eat, first off if you are allergic to shellfish don't eat here literally everything they have has an oyster sauce on it. We ordered the Cashew Chicken which was extremely bland and i got the black pepper steak and it was so peppered i basically couldn't eat it. The pork dumplings were good and so were the drinks but the entrees were very disappointing. Finally we ordered the Chocolate Box for dessert which also was disappointing, we ended up eating only the banana chocolate mouse and Mango cheesecake the rest were horrible.

And the sauce was rich but the pickled slaw topped with the jalape\u00f1o cut the richness perfectly. The flavors were layered well and the shrimp was succulent and fresh. The Miso Black Cod: There's an over powering taste of unagi sauce and not enough of the salty miso that I was anticipating. Overall the fish was on the sweeter side as it was covered in the sauce but paired with the bok choy, shiitake, and the smokey tasting daikon in one bite, it was delicious.

Buddakan is my fave restaurant, and people say Philly is the best. We had a reservation, so we were seated right away. We ordered a lychee martini and Buddha's Cup. Lychee martini was not good. Tasted like straight vodka. Not much of a lychee flavor at all. A far cry from the lychee martini of AC which is the best I ever had. Buddha's cup was better, but needed something like more citrus to give it some life. We also ordered a Zen-gria later on, and it was the best drink, but still lacked a little something. Was definitely pretty though. For appetizers, we ordered crispy calamari salad, edamame dumplings, and peking duck buns. Crispy calamari salad was great, and edamame dumplings never fail. Peking duck buns I thought was a waste of stomach space, calories, and money. The point of peking duck is to get a piece of that crispy duck skin which didn't exist in these buns, nor much of any duck. I could've bought literally 12 of these buns in NY that would've tasted 100 times better. But hubby wanted it.For entrees, I ordered the dungeness crab sticky fried rice, and hubby ordered the char grilled aged beef. They were definitely both great, but hubby's dish was orgasmic. The szechuan fries and all the flavors were amazing. He always orders the better entree on my bday dinners.We were stuffed, but we had to have dessert. We ordered the dip sum donuts because I saw it on \"Best Thing I ever Ate\" on Food Network. They put a sparking candle on it for my bday which was nice. It came with 3 dipping sauces. They were pretty good. I wouldn't say the best thing I ever ate. So overall, a good experience. As for the service, the waiter was attentive, but at the same time it wasn't like he cared. Kinda like ask you something, and is gone before you can answer. But he gave me complimentary chocolate truffles to take home for my bday which was nice. I've tried all 3 Buddakan restaurants, AC is #1, and Philly makes #2."]]}
