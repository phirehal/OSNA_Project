I took the strategy of one at each stop which was pretty ambitious. Here I wound up ordering the al pastor taco. It is one of my favorite styles of taco, and I hadnt tried it yet that day, so I gave it a shot. I also ordered a classic margarita, because my friend had told me they were his favorites in town.While I cant say it was my favorite, (see my review on Sancho Pistolas), it was a very well done margarita. Again rocks all the way, and always salt on the rim. I sucked down another two of these bad boys quickly. I also scarfed down the taco. Thank god it was small because I had 9 others inside me already. The flavor was really good though. It had really nice sweet a spice to it. The little tortillas were packed full of al pastor goodness. The decoration was really weird and not at all what I was expecting, but I am glad I the name makes more sense now...Pez dispensers everywhere. Its a really fun atmosphere.I would definitely come back again."], ["Kaysey W.", "I absolutely love this place, great atmosphere, staff, food and drinks! What else is there?

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place tonight. We got the beef nachos, a chicken quesdilla, a beef burrito and a shrimp taco.the food was very good. The staff is very attentive and nice. The reason why I gave this place a four star is because I was kid of disappointed with my shrimp taco. I was expecting a hot crispy shrimp on a delicious taco but the shrimp I got was cold and soggy.

The quesadillas are the saddest looking things anyone has ever seen. \u00a0I'd actually prefer a Taco Bell quesadilla over the one served at Loco Pez. It was basically a tortilla with a little smattering of melted cheese and shrimp so tiny they could be mistaken for sea monkeys. The lettuce, tomato, and sour cream are on the side, so you essentially have to make your own quesadilla.I ordered a shrimp burrito which was aight...but I have had better burritos at chipotle.Drinks are pretty good, if a little on the expensive side.

Basically got one of every taco, and my favorites were no surprise for me since I am such a meat fan, but I'd bet chorizo was my top. I was filled when I finished eating, but honestly I could eat those little Mexican salads on a shell all day if \u00a0had the time (and it wouldn't have hurt my wallet too much to boot).

Navigating the baffling seating procedure is the first hurdle - there's no hostess, but tables are always reserved. Good luck finding how to get on the secret waiting list; there's no one to help you and your best bet is to be yelled at by other patrons when you skip the line. The yelling will at least tell you who to talk to.Ok, you say, I'll sit at the bar. Well, unfortunately, there's usually only one bartender and she/he is constantly overwhelmed. No barback to help, and frankly, it's a big bar. So it's completely hit or miss whether you will get served in anything approaching a timely manner, and if you do, don't expect anything more than a gruff, passing \"you doing ok?\".I can't say much about the food - never had the stamina to actually stay there long enough to order anything. But what I've seen looks pretty basic: anglicized tex-mex, heavy on the squeeze bottle sour cream.Drinks are watered down, and not particularly flavorful. Avoid the michelada especially.Finally, don't forget that Loco Pez is cash-only. Which would be fine if it was a regular taqueria. But people tell me it's tough getting out of there without spending $40 per person, especially if you have drinks.If you still insist on going to Loco Pez, good luck."], ["Gina M.", "I went here on a date a few weeks ago. \u00a0Even though he turned out to be terrible, the food was amazing! \u00a0This place is tiny and really easy to miss. \u00a0When you go inside, you'll realize it's like a rowhome just with a bar and a lot more people in it. They definitely cram you in there but hey. It's worth it. I'm not a fan of spicy food so i was worried about going here and hating it and looking like an ass on a first date, but he ordered me the chicken quesadillas that were absolutely incredible. There was definitely a little kick to them but it was doable. The service kinda sucked and we had to sit at the bar and the bartender just didn't care about us whatsoever but we had each other's company which worked...for that night. I would definitely go back.Sometimes when the food is so good, you can overlook bad service! And maybe if we were sitting at a table it would have been different! \u00a0I'll be back though! :)"], ["Sarah P.", "I'm a fan of this place. Other than the import, the service is generally sub par. I've had better Mexican food, however I'm into cheap tacos, the 70's living room dive bar atmosphere, and it's a short walk from my apartment. Dollar taco night is always fun to stumble upon. Tune into their twitter account for what night they decide to have it. If you want authentic Mexican food you've come to the wrong place. Their garbacho taco is the classic hard shell taco you had at your friend's place after school. Ground beef, lettuce, pico, and cheese - I'm a sucker for it. The rest of their tacos are served the more traditional style on a small soft tortilla.I'm a big fan of their happy hour: $4 for a huge plate of nachos, $4 house margaritas, and $3 drafts. Good for a cheap dinner alone or with a friend and some cheap drinks to drown your sorrows from the day."], ["Cheryl K.", "I went here for the second time last night, and it's definitely becoming one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the city.Yesterday's special was a scallop taco that was absolutely to die for. I had two and a whiskey ginger which definitely satisfied me. Honestly the only thing wrong with the place is the abundance of pseudo-hipsters and ex-sorority girls on their phones, but that's only to be expected in Fishtown.Do yourself a favor and stop in for some giant nachos and reasonable priced Mexican grub.

Yes... and convenient for me, this some-kinda- Mexicali-foodstuffs-and-drinks-yellin' tick.So yeah, Loco Pez supplies tequilas a-plenty and some lovely margaritas, from the classic style Impala, to the blood orangey Coupe De Ville. There are abouts six or so beers on tap, and many cans and bottles, including your Mexican favorites along with the crafty. The nachos are grande and come highly recommended by me, as they are loaded, well-layered, and not skimpy in the least, even if you order the o.g. non-meatsy ones...but try those Nachos de Kenzo some time if you do dig on chorizo and carne asada, cause that's likely all you'll need outta life.I love that the tacos here at Loco Pez are lil fellas on smaller sized corn tortillas, cause that makes em ripe for the makings of a personal taco combo fiesta for yourself. I'm sayin, a la carte and mix n match that mutha.My favorite tacos of theirs include the super flavorful shredded pollo- if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times; I love a tasty Tinga! I found the mash up of chorizo and potato to be delicious, tambien. The cochinita pibil of roasty, juicy pork with pickled red onions are straight up lip smackin. I'm tellin you... Love the mushroom tacos too. For a place called Crazy Fish, I've still yet to try a fish taco here. Strange. Hmm. I should get on that.Make sure to try every salsa in the bucket. To these salsas I do the international hand gesture of chef kissy fingers. Good stuff. I'm a fan of lotsas salsas, ya know.I enjoy. This Loco Pez is a fine, fine example of the kinda neighborhood bar I'd like to have in me own. They have a goood jukebox too- always appreciate that. We've always gotten good service here t'boot.

I will add a picture of my plate. My rice was garnished with cilantro sprouts, there was chayote in my veggies and the there was a little bunch of steamed veggie sticks tied together with a little corn husk leaf. \u00a0This meal is not served with tortilla so I had to ask for those. The torillas are home made :D are brought in a little basket without a lid or wrapping so they got cold quick; I had one hot tortilla and by the time I got the secondit was cold :( \u00a0They should \u00a0wrap them. Also they should consider making an additional Salsa, the one served with the over toasted chips is too mild and the other is a habanero sauce that is TOO hot.

I waited a while and he came back and asked the table next to me if they would like their bill (I was still waiting for mine) he brought their bill, (where's mine?) he walked away \u00a0came back -they paid (where's mine?), they left and as I sat there growing annoyed because I could have left before them or had another margarita he finally brought my bill! \u00a0Later he returned for my card and cashed me out....

No need to delve into my love affair with Tequilas. Lets focus on the tangibles, this is a disclaimer I am only rating on the tangibles, I would give this place a 5/5 based on sentimentality. Food is very good but nothing really stands out, its typical mexican food (enchiladas, ceviche, guac etc) but priced way higher than mexican food should be priced at. Mexican food is awesome but I don't think it should be super expensive. For example I paid 20.00 for enchiladas at Tequilas, the same enchiladas (way more authentic) at one of those south philly mexican restaurants costs $12.00. I really believe the atmosphere is what drives the cost and the additional $8.00 you pay for enchiladas you get a classy atmosphere with really friendly service. I'm ok with that on a Friday-Saturday night. You get the point right? Good food over-priced. Great dining atmosphere, great service, a little too expensive though."], ["Kelly P.", "Delicious food but truly hurts the wallet.

We still gave it try since it was cinco de mayo weekend and because it got decent reviews.I hope my review is helpful. After we walked through the bar area which had a tangible excitement about it, the server brought us into the main dining area which was low-lit, but seemed to have a full room with the staff busily moving about between tables.The server was helpful and pleasant, but the service was a bit slow. There was a bit of a mix-up to start (probably because it was starting to get loud in the place and they couldn't hear what we ordered). The timing of the dishes was a bit off as it seemed that dinner took them a little while to bring out, but it was expected since it's probably the busiest time of year for Mexican restaurants. The variety of cocktails was delightful - and they do have some real top shelf tequilas and mescals. \u00a0The fresh guacamole and chips were a plus (our party added the crab and mango - which I recommend, but they do have other options). The pickled peepers, salsa, and rojo sauce that were served with the chips could've been left in the kitchen. They lacked flavor and actually, there wasn't anything special about those items at all. The main entrees were good and were presented nicely. Even the rice and re-fried beans had good flavor and texture to them. Usually, I find that the side items are overlooked, over-cooked, and unpleasant. \u00a0I had shredded-roasted pork with fresh tortillas and fried plantains which was tasty for the most part (with the exception to the plantains, which were over-cooked). Some of the other dishes looked pretty good too. The dessert got the highest marks. We had a delicious chocolate-flan layer cake. The tres leches cake looked delicious. \u00a0I recommend the coffee as well (you'll need it after the drinks). If you're looking for a casual night with good drinks and appetizers or if plan on having a fun dessert and coffee, try this place. The main entrees are just ok and not that impressive. Also, forget decent dinner conversation in the main dining room unless you plan to yell all night. This place is good for casual dinner conversation for sure. If you want some intimacy, try taking a table outside."], ["Matt D.", "I'm ambivalent about this place. They have great margaritas. The guacamole is delicious. However, overall the food is good--not great, but good. I've had the pork tacos, and they are extremely sweet--beware. I've had the steak that comes with a sampling of other dishes--a tamale, a chicken taco, etc., and that was good--just not particularly memorable. It's a relatively upscale-feeling restaurant with relatively high prices for what you get, and admittedly--it's just not my style. Mexican food can be so delicious...and the food here just isn't as good as it can be."], ["Arielle H.", "I was just there for Valentine's Day. Our seats sucked (by the door and the curtain really didn't help with the cold) but the service was very friendly and never left us waiting.

My beef entree (it doesn't seem to be a part of the regular menu) was seasoned well and perfectly cooked. I asked for medium and got medium rare (yay!) so if you like your meat more done (why?) be sure to be specific.

It is a large restaurant for the city so it's perfect for large groups. The first two times I was here was for Center City Restaurant Week and I ordered off of their pre-fixed menu for $35 for a three course meal.

Drinks- We started with a round (or two) of drinks. I had the Roses margarita and enjoyed every sip. It's a bit on the sweet side though so for my second drink I had the Skinny Margarita which was just tequila mixed with lime juice and a little bit of agave so it's not as sweet. Both were served on the rocks with salt. Course 1- For the appetizer I ordered Ceviche and it was so good. The portion was really large and could have seriously been my entire meal. It was perfectly seasoned with cilantro, lime and tomatoes. Course 2- The main entr\u00e9e that I ordered was something I can't pronounce in Spanish so I just referred to it as the 'Hot Lava Chicken Bowl'! It is chunks of chicken swimming in a hot sauce topped with cheese and served with tortillas and a side of refried beans, guacamole and salsa. You are supposed to make tacos with everything and I did that for the first one but then \u00a0I just put the check on a plate and ate it alone because it was so flavorful. Course 3- There were so many dessert choices but I went with a classic Mexican cake- tres laches. It was creamy and moist just how it should be. The wait staff also surprised me with a 'cocaracha shot' made of tequila, Kahlua and sprit. It was tasty but I was very startled with the waiter came outo f now where and started slamming the glass on the table to make it fizz!

The first song was one of salsa's classic hits but then after that, they played too much bachata (salsa social ?) and played none of the classic or current salsa hits. We were there until closing and only heard one merengue, and not even one reggaeton. I have better salsa on my iPhone. Go and enjoy, buy be prepared to hear as much bachata as salsa."], ["Stephen D.", "Love the drinks especially the tequila and margaritas but it can get very loud.

In fact, each time I've been previously had been during happy hour, so maybe I was too harsh in my first review. This place is really popular on a Friday night. I got there late, but my friends had to wait a half hour to be seated. I had their enchilada dish and a few house margaritas....yum! Much better experience than the meal I ordered previously, the steak salad. So, my impression of this place has gone up; I'll probably be giving it a few more chances."], ["Brianna K.", "Disappointing. I really wanted to get the cactus burger when I went here, but it turns out that even their bread is non-vegan so I got mushroom tacos instead.

Nope, sorry, I know what OJ tastes like (I'm from Florida). The margarita tasted exactly the same as my boyfriends.

The guacamole was medium spicy, so you might want to skip it of you're not a fan of a little zing. It honestly wasn't great. We didn't eat much of it.I got the cactus burger, which allegedly had real cactus in it. That's kind of fun and funky, so I thought I'd try it. It was very salty. The vegetables were cut into think strips and then scooped into the bin, but the stings were too long (IMHO). This made it incredibly difficult to eat \u00a0without making a huge mess. It also could have used some sauce, as it was pretty dry.My friend wasn't a big fan of her pulled chicken wrap, either. Everything was just too salty. It's a very vegetarian/vegan-friendly place, though. They always offer a vegan soup (hard to find, sometimes).I liked that the servers didn't wear any particular uniforms.

LiterallyThe cactus burger is an interesting concept but not well executed I wouldn't recommend it. My friend did say she thoroughly enjoy the wine sangria though!Happy hour has drinks for 5 dollars including sangria and mojito among others.

I also ordered a drink that never came that they tried to charge me for at the end. My meal to say the least was gross. The tortillas were hard and difficult to cut, it had barely any beans inside it and the entire dish was DROWNING in mole sauce. So much sauce that I couldn't taste my dish. My boyfriend ordered tacos which he said were tasteless. The sauces they use for the chips and salsa are sauces to add flavor to main dishes, not your traditional dipping salsa. I don't think they really know how to make mexican food, even though they advertise that it is 'traditional.' I'm from Chicago and have lived in California (home of the cali burrito) and we saw that this was the best place to get mexican food in phili, I am in shock.

My only complaint was that the breakfast burrito was made with a wheat tortilla, which isn't my favorite.

He ordered the huevos rancheros and a cup of coffee while I ordered the huevos motule\u00f1os especial and the chocolate oaxaca. The chocolate oaxaca (hot chocolate with cinnamon) was rich and delicious, although I would have preferred it a little less sweet. The huevos motule\u00f1os were very tasty and the poblano rajas were a nice touch. The service may be a little slow if there's a large crowd, but you won't be waiting too long and the prices are really good.The servers were a little lax here and there with attentiveness, but they were doing like 5 different things each and were very nice, cheerful and helpful--it happens sometimes in small restaurants and it all turned out perfectly fine.Cafe Con Chocolate also sells baked goods near the entrance, which I was too full to try.

I ordered the tofu scramble and dare I say it gave Sabrina's a run for their money. Served with black beans and oh so incredible Delish. My husband guy huevos rancheros and liked his a lot too. The second time we returned we came with the kiddos and splurged. Ordered a ton of goodies. They got fruit smoothies which they downed in seconds. Hubs got a meat burrito he loved, I stuck with my tofu scramble, kiddos split a veggie breakfast burrito and we all got chips and guac. This time I got a Mexican coffee and was so happy they had soy as an option. Love how veg friendly they are. Tiny place which I understand is now cash only. Perfect little brunch spot. Never had to wait. Super random location. Nothing but a positive experience all around, every time. Service was pretty quick and nothing to complain about.

There's nothing I can do for you.\"And then he hung up the phone.

This place is awesome! Seeing as I only work about four blocks away from here, we've been more than a dozen times, for lunch and dinner. Anything you'll order from Quetzally is going to be absolutely delicious. Super fresh and homemade. They don't cater so much to the overly cheesy, sour cream ladened idea that Americans have of Mexican food. Everything here seems very authentic and is dressed perfectly with just the right amount of cheese or avocado crema(beyond delicious). I usually have the grilled tilapia tacos($7) or tilapia burrito($9). The tacos, two per order, are very light and wrapped in delicious, light corn tortillas with a bit of crema on top. The burrito, the larger of the two is plenty big enough for two meals! It's drizzled with the avocado crema( mix of avocado and cream) and stuffed full of whatever meat or veg you choose and loads of beans, rice and cheese. The best thing I've had on the menu , so far, are definitely the tortas; fried corn tortillas topped with choice of meat and loads of lettuce and crema and a bit of cheese. There is even a bit of their marinated cactus salad in there. To die for! And it is HUGE, with three tortas per order.Also, get the guacamole. You will NOT regret it.Yesterday we had a taste of the horchada they've just added to the menu, and I so wish I could have taken a gallon home with me! It's a rice milk based drink, full of milk and cinnamony goodness! The guy that owns the place, (Jorge I think is his name) is so so nice. He says it's been his dream to own a little Mexican restaurant. He comes from Mexico City and the place is actually named after his daughter, Quetzally. He's a gem of a man.I really hope this place is in it for the long haul. The menu is constantly being updated with new, absolutely delicious items. Go for dinner and bring your own beer!

I think the fried ones fell short, so stick to that tasty glaze they have going. The pork one also had a lot of great flavors. They didn't skimp on the meat either. There is a high level of detail that goes into these from the tiny chopped chives on top to the thin cabbage or pickled radish that gives these tacos some style.

It was busier than expected for a Sunday evening, but we were given free beer samples while we looked at the menu, so I have no complaints.I ended up with a fried Mahi Mahi taco (you can have the option of not-fried as well) and split an order of nachos. The taco was on point, and I'm not even a huge fish lover. Although, slather pickled veggies on anything and I won't complain... The nachos had a perfect amount of toppings too. They aren't piled high and are more spread in a single layer, but I would rather have that than a bunch of naked chips any day. For three tacos and nachos, it was $20, which was definitely fair. I will definitely be back with a bigger appetite to try the non-seafood tacos and the supposedly delicious prickly pear margarita."], ["H D.", "Spent a day in Philly and stumbled upon this place while leaving the $1 $2 $3 dollar book store around the corner. Got the Mahi Mahi fried taco and jumbo shrimp. Both so good! They have green/red sauce at each table, yummy. Beautiful outside seating. Tacos were $3 (pretty standard). All of this was great but I decided to write this review about the service!! Blown away at how accommodating and great the staff was. Overall an amazing experience and would definitely recommend. Which I got the nachos after seeing all of these amazing pictures. Will definitely come back and enjoy a drank"], ["Sara B.", "We stopped in here on a Wednesday night after hitting up the Art Museum. At first, I was apprehensive because there was quite a line BUT the free beer samples and streamlined system made the \"wait\" non-existent. The staff here is accommodating, friendly and \u00a0fast. They answered all of our questions and were very helpful.The food is amazing. We had the marlin mini tacos and the salsa & chips as appetizers and the frozen prickly pear margaritas. Delicious!! For the tacos we had the house special Mahi Mahi, the fish of the day (which was perch), a pollo and a carne. All four of them were incredible. The carne taco was one of the best tacos I've ever had, but all of them were amzing. Not a loser in the bunch.We will definitely be back to Buena Onda!"], ["Kieran M.", "BUENA ONDA is my go-to place. I absolutely love everything.. from the tacos to the quesadillas to the margaritas and the beer on tap. I love how fresh everything is when I walk in. I actually love it so much that I tell all my friends about it.I've probably gone and eaten here 4 times or so. However, I did order pickup last week and I was not as impressed this time around. I was told it would be 20 minutes for the food to be ready. I arrived 5 minutes early. I got back to my place (I live 5 minutes from B.O) and the tacos were cold and the quesadillas werent the same fantastic quesadillas I've gotten prior. They didnt have rice and other veggies that they had before and lacked chicken. I'll keep ordering for sure, maybe not pickup though.. I hope they didnt change what goes into the quesadillas because that would be a huge bummer for me. That was just one bad experience, the rest have been great."], ["Jourdan W.", "This is easily one of my new favorite taco places. The laid back, chill vibe of the resturaunt brings you to the beach even in the middle of the city and the menu has just enough delicious options even including beer, margharitas and wine.The prices are extremely reasonable, I got 3 tacos for about 10 dollars and a free cup for water (I actually used it for water too!). I chose the shrimp (glazed), Mahi Mahi (fried) and the Carne tacos. The glazed was much better then the fried option, which you can do either with the fish, and the Carne was so moist and deliciously seasoned!!! The sauce in the shrimp taco was hands down the best. It was my favorite taco, and I could probably down 3 of them alone. It took maybe 5 minutes for our food to be delivered to the table after we ordered and they had them in these handy taco holders to keep everything inside. If your in Fairmount area it a needed stop by location for lunch."], ["Jenn W.", "I'm a fan, Only thing let me down is the wait at register to order for little longer then anticipated, but the menu was great, We were at the Manayunk Arts & Crafts festival , so we were hungry & decided to get something , spotted this place & we went in.If it wasn't for the wait, probable be 5-stars..but Lets see how they are next time.!!!.We ordered 2 -Mahi Mahi & 2 Carnitas, Guacamole & chips..So YUMMY!!!! They are pretty decent variety & Loved the jicama& pickled cabbage on top for the acidity & texture!! The sauces at the tables were fabulous. Very well made , taste the smokiness from the pork & mahi-mahi was cooked to perfection!!! Go back!!Return factor:Yes, & btw ..liquor license, from beer to Margaritas. The place is small but its really good!!tDefinitely!!!"], ["Kelly K.", "The tacos were good - mahi mahi delicious (we got fried) and the fish special, swordfish taco was so good! Guac okay and I would skip on the kids tacos, cold cubes of chicken on a tortilla with a teaspoon of cheese - they did fix this but still super boring/bland kids item. Guess that works for some - other than that everything was great!"], ["Georgianna J.", "These are not your average Taco Bell, Moe's, Qdoba, and dare I say it Chipotle (sheesh I really love Chipotle) tacos. Took a suggestion from a respected fellow Yelper, Christian S., and tried this place. Well let's just say I only got 3 tacos and boy did I want more. I already knew what I wanted before I got there. Online menus serve a purpose people, if nothing else it helps you narrow down your choices and if you're like me, it pretty much helps you walk into a new place looking like a pro. Back to the matter at hand, I ordered 3 shrimp tacos, fish of the day was perch, no thank you. And Mahi Mahi, is a little too strong for my subtle fish palate. So 2 glazed shrimp tacos and 1 fried shrimp taco it was for me. Took it to go. First I definitely appreciate the care they place in their to go containers. They serve their tacos on these taco triangle thingamajigs in the restaurant which help the tacos to stand up. Well lo and behold they have a cardboard version of it for the take out tacos. Major points for that, they seriously take tacos serious... So I ordered my tacos and a drink and I waited. A girl at the bar who was eating told me to place my number in the holder. That's how they identify you. It was appreciated but probably not needed only because the restaurant wasn't busy and when the lady bought my tacos out she called me by name. But the hospitality was gracious. Got to my car cause I had somewhere to be, opened the box of tacos and one side of the cardboard taco holder had flattened and my fried shrimp taco was all over the place. No biggie I just put the taco together. First bite, the glazed tequila lime, or whatever shrimp taco. It was good, two nice sized juicy, sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp in the taco. I was in love. I had been searching for a great shrimp taco and I think I found it. I had one at El Camino a few weeks ago and it was abysmal, lacked flavor and totally disappointed my taste buds. Not this taco at Buena, was fabulous! The chipotle crema was really tasty and had a nice zing. Now I love hot sauce and was about to put some on mine but I'm glad I didn't because the crema provides just enough bite. Now onto the fried shrimp taco. Batter beware, really good breading and batter on these shrimp. Kind of tempura style so the shrimp aren't buried in the breading. It was a smidge salty but I am really averse to any salt at this point in my life so don't take that as a cautionary measure from me. I forgot to mention that they have Boylan's soda on fountain tap. Umm yesss because this is my favorite soda ever, well that and Frank's and Dr. Browns, but these sodas are so yummy it was nice to see it somewhere as a fountain drink as opposed to the big box soda dealers...My side notes and suggestions: They should increase the size of the soda cup. It's small for the $3 they charge, even if it's Boylan's. If you're hungry order more than 3. If it's your first time order 3, then order more if you like them because you will be hungry. I forgot to order the corn with mine so that may have helped stave off my lingering hunger after I ate my tacos. Finally, they have a rewards program. Really nice to have for a non chain establishment. Finally, I expected these tacos to be good. I mean come on, it's from Jose Garces who had like the best taco truck, Guapos Tacos, in the city for a while. Plus pretty much everything he, Stephen Starr, and Michael Solomonov seem to touch or open in this city you can pretty much guarantee a good meal. Went on a Wednesday night and it wasn't crowded. Municipal parking lot right across from the restaurant if you struggle finding street parking.Very good uptake on fast, casual dining."], ["Gary L.", "We come here at least 3 times per week for tacos and guac. Delicious mahi, shrimp, pork, and beef. The managers are super friendly and accomodating. This place is very consistent and tasty."], ["Wellington C.", "Mis tacos preferidos en Philadelphia.

Great tacos, especially the fried Atlantic Mahi Mahi (add a hit of hot sauce!) and Carnitas (adore Garces's pineapple and j\u00edcama slaw) and nachos (baked to the point at which some of the chips were very brown/crisped and the cheese crunchy, which some dinner mates adored). Loved the casual ambience and, as many have said, the free beer while in line made the wait bearable. Will definitely return when the craving for tacos hits!"], ["Matt G.", "Not bad, clean, restaurant. Food wasn't as great for me as some of these other reviews suggest.

Buena Onda had a great beachy vibe, which felt like an escape from (at that time) the cold Philly weather. Buena Onda is definitely fast-casual, unlike the other Jose Garces restaurants. The servings were very generous here, which my friend and i definitely appreciated. Everything was also quite reasonably priced. When we went, my friend and i ordered the Nachos, Veggie Quesadilla, Jumbo Pacific Shrimp Tacos and the Esquites. Everything was delicious but for me, the winner of the night was the last one. The corn was extremely tasty, creamy with just a hint of spice. The nachos were extremely cheesy and tasty, but to me, it wouldn't be what I'd consider the best nachos ever. All-in-all, I didn't think the restaurant was life-changing though it is a solid option for fast-casual Mexican food."]], "Nora's Taqueria and Grill": [], "El Vez": [], "Distrito": [["Sara M.", "Came here for dinner on Saturday night and it did not disappoint. Great staff, great margaritas, really awesome atmosphere overall. The way the place is decorated is authentic yet classy. I'm only giving it 4/5 stars because the food is really good and well priced but it didn't floor me in its goodness. I had carnitas (pork tacos) which were so good! The Guac was great as well. Others at our table had chicken tacos, queso fundido, and nachos. No one was disappointed with their meal. It is tapas style so the servings are smaller but it was perfect for us. We also ordered margaritas by the pitcher which were strong but not overpowering. Distrito is also very reasonably priced. There were 8 of us, we ordered four margarita pitchers and the price was less than $40/person. I would definitely recommend this place!"], ["Karina R.", "I don't understand what the hype is about? My friend and I arrive around 8pm on Sat and the girl at the front desk quickly told us that there was no availability on second level and we can only eat at their taqueria. We were seated promptly and our server was attentive. I went back and asked what the wait time was to be seated on the second level (not offered initially) and the girl stated about an hour, so I put my name down. Chips were cold, guacamole and salsa were bland, and my taco was dry. I did get the pozole and it was VERY GOOD. My friend got the carnitas tacos and stated they were good. The veggie quesadilla was pretty tasty as well. About an hour and 15 min later and my name was never called. Front desk service needs work. The girls did their best to do the bare minimum with guests. Maybe because I'm Mexican and have high standards for \"Mexican\" \u00a0food, I was disappointed.

The chips were light and crispy, and the salsa had a nice spicy kick. The chilango chop salad was meh, and there were too many tortilla strips! I was picking them out by the end. The tacos were decent, though the tortillas were sad and kind of limp. The al pastor taco was the good - the pork was flavorful. The mahi mahi taco was disappointing - it was overcooked and rather dry.The music is a bit loud downstairs, and it can be hard to hear at times."], ["Casey S.", "Nice atmosphere and decor but I don't really see what all the hype is. Ordered the guacamole which was a small bland portion with almost no flavor. It was covered with equally flavorless cheese. Chips were crisp and well salted though. Prices were way too high considering the portion sizes. I got the chicken enchilada which was literally one enchilada. It had good flavor and I loved the sauce. My boyfriend got the tacos suerdo with beef which he loved but he remarked \"is this the starter portion?\" \u00a0Service overall was good. Food was yummy but definitely not worth the price. Neither of us left full or satisfied but refused to order a second entree! I decided just to snack on the complimentary spicy peanuts even though they didn't do much for me either.

Some dishes were tasty and others were rather blah. All the dishes were really serving size for 1 or 2 people. It rather elevated our pockets of $218 and some change. We tipped $45 to the server for her services.After this meal, my friend mentioned to Caitlin (our server), who brought the manager over. She took off our drinks. Which brought our bill down to $178 and some change. Changed our dessert to the Torte de Queso (coffee cheese cake). It was a nice gesture but did not fulfill our dinner disappointment. Was still hungry after I left. Food is my thing and I don't discriminate. This had to be one of those moments where I would rethink my food options of a famous eatery vs a local fav.

We were all disappointed when we left and I felt a little embarrassed. We all ordered the Frida Khalo. The description says, \"elevate your experience with a selection of inspired Mexican plates & original off-menu, interpretations crafted by our Chef.\" But everything we experienced was straight from the menu, almost all appetizers, with only 1 actual entr\u00e9e, the chicken. There were 3 of us and we had to share 1 small chicken entr\u00e9e? Where's the beef, duck or lamb? We were given crab guacamole, pico de gallo, tuna app (not the yellow fin), a small frisee salad, mushroom flat bread, octopus app, a cup of corn with mayo and lime, a cup of refried beans, fried plantain with black bean mousse, pork tacos (3) and the 1 chicken entr\u00e9e in a container not much bigger than a cup. I understand the concept of tapas and of sharing, but there wasn't enough to share. This was a meal for 2, but we ordered for 3! I was going to let it go, but then the dessert came out. Can you guess what that was? If you guessed Churros, then you are right! So I ask you, where was the creativity? Where was the rest of my food? I let the server know that I was underwhelmed by the chefs selections, especially the dessert. She brought out a much nicer dessert, a cheese cake with a nice ice cream and some kind of flaky pie crust on the side. That was the best part of the meal, but she only brought 1, so we each took a bite and asked for a check. Just as we were about to pay the check, the manager came over, explained that selections change daily and took the drinks off the check. I thanked her for her concern, I thanked the server for her good service and we left. I'll get to my point. I didn't want to complain, I didn't want a discount, I just wanted the creative menu promised! And I wanted enough to feed 3, not 2 or 1 dessert. Churros? Really? Creative?

I made a reservation and we showed up early for our reservation, she said we couldn't be seated yet. No sweat, we left & came back a bit later. When we got back she said, \"I can seat you in 4 minutes\". There was not a single other customer there. So we stood there and waited 4 minutes. Right before the 4 minute mark was up, a family of 4 came in and were seated right away. What's the point of making a reservation if we can't be seated 1 minute early on the slowest day of all time but anyone can walk in and be seated right away? While we were waiting for our 1 minute to pass we got to listen to one of the male servers discuss \"butt selfies\" and talk about how \"they're all the rage\". mmmm, appetizing. We're finally seated and someone comes over immediately. He asks if we know what tapas are. We say yes. He then explains tapas, and the ENTIRE MENU in great detail. Why ask us? He then asks us if we know what ceviche is. We again said yes, and luckily didn't get a definition. I'm all for a helpful server, but not only did I mention that I had been there before, it really doesn't serve you well to treat your customers like they're stupid. Other than that, he was great. Additionally we had lots of different people bringing out our food/clearing our plates/refilling our water; all were friendly. I asked about happy hour and was told there was not a happy hour. We were there within their advertized happy hour time frame but learned that you can't order off of the \"real food\" menu and also get happy hour specials, despite being there at the correct time. If you want happy hour items you have to sit in the bar area and eat from a limited menu. Pretty dumb.I ordered the mahi tacos and a watermelon margarita. Tequila is my favorite spirit but whatever they added to it didn't do it any favors. I didn't like the cocktail at all. The mahi tacos were good, but not only did he not mention that they were fried, neither did the menu. Authentic Mexican fish tacos are generally not fried and so I didn't think to ask, but I wish I had; I'd have gotten something else. Also the torillas were like tiny micro tortillas. They were smaller than the tortillas on other tacos we ordered and I couldn't close them around the food so it fell out all over and got on my hands. The yellowfin ceviche was good but totally NOT worth $14. The salad was meh. The carnitas tacos were good but nothing to write home about. We did enjoy the guac, though.

I absolutely love their frozen margarita (for $5)--they're perfectly tart, cold, and alcoholic for such a low price! I've tried their happy hour wines and normal margarita too, and didn't enjoy them as much, so that might just be me. Distrito's chips are the best I've ever tasted; perfectly crispy and salted, the $2 salsa complements them perfectly and the bowl they give you seems unlimited! I also love the chicken tacos and fish tacos (maybe 2 for $5 is a bit pricey, but they're definitely a tiny bite of culinary goodness!). Steer away from the carnitas tacos though, as the grease drips through the tortillas.

This experience made me question if I ever want to eat at a Garces restaurant again."], ["Alesandra L.", "My fiance and I are obsessed with this place. \u00a0We started our evening off downstairs in their Taqueria with a Cucumber Marg. \u00a0It was to die for! \u00a0Our reservation was for upstairs. \u00a0 The server was very attentive as well as the other staff. \u00a0I have a gluten allergy but the server was super knowledgeable and gave us plenty of GF options. \u00a0Everything from the food to drinks were great. Can't go wrong with the El Jefe. We can't wait to go back. :) :)"], ["Lindsey G.", "Came in for lunch on the day before Thanksgiving. \u00a0Food and service were great! Get the al pastor burrito yum."], ["Tiffany T.", "Happy hour review: Monday thru Friday from 5 to 7 pm bar area onlyDuring these times you can snag 2 for $5 tacos (chicken, fish, or carnitas) , $5 Sangria/ Wine/ Margaritas $4 Dos Equis Amber and $3 Modelo or Tecante cans , $2 chips and salsa and $5 for guacamoleKeep in mind the $5 guacamole is a \"happy hour\" size, so if you have come for dinner before don't expec that portion, it's much smallerBartender was good -- let us know when a spot open up (it was two of us hovering over 1 seat during HH), came over to check on how we were doing on drinks and food at appropriate times and everything was timely and professional.The quality of drinks and food are no different during happy hour. The margaritas were just as strong as I remember, so it's good that they don't skimp during happy hour.. not that I'd expect that from a fine iron chef establishment (but unfortunately I've been to other places that have had different experiences during dinner vs happy hour!) Solid happy hour joint in University CityPS don't forget they have $2 tacos on Tuesday.. to save you that 50 cents haha"]], "Lolita": []}
