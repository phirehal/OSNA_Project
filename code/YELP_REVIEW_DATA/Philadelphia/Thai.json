I'm not even kidding you! \"Only the soup\", \"just the soup\",\" just to make sure, you only ordered soup.\"It didn't take long time for us to got our Three Drunken Noodles ( With chicken, duck and jumbo shrimps.) She didn't get her soup yet. At that point I wasn't sure if he did it in purpose to be funny, or he really forgot. One of the people in my group has a really low tolerance for spicy foods. He asked the waiter about the heat level in his dish to make sure it was the right for him or to even lower it for him. His Duck Drunken Noodles was so spicy he couldn't eat it. \u00a0Our water glasses were not filled unless we asked for refill, which took forever. \u00a0We even asked for a water carafe to make our life easier. The waiter didn't know what a \"carafe \" was. So we asked for a \"pitcher\" which came after we asked him for the second time. Prior to ordering, we asked the waiter if we can get separate check, since we were carrying only cards. The waiter said of course, it won't be a problem. Well, it was. The waiter, brought us the bill before even asking if we need anything else, some dessert for example. Anyway the bill was NOT separated!!! He said he will figure it out. 10 minutes later, he came to pickup our payment. Another 10 minutes before he came again, and asked us to go to the cashier and tell him what we got and pay it over there.

Second off, the noodles are just OK -- and priced at $13 ( with delivery comes to $17) it's not something I'd get again. It's not terribly authentic -- they use American broccoli and eggplant in the dish.. and as some of you may know it's traditionally made with Chinese broccoli but of course, never with eggplant that is kind of an odd addition. It's also listed as \" crispy tofu\" and let me tell you that was not crispy tofu.. it was soggy.. The food was pretty okay, but nothing that blew my socks off to make the money worth it.

Their website prompts you to order through Grubhub so the ordering process was easy and pretty prompt. Everything came to us warm and neat. \u00a0The vegetable samosas were probably our favorite part of the meal. They consisted of potato, edamame, veggies, spices and came with a Thai peanut sauce. There were two large samosas which were really easy to split between two people. I wasn't overly impressed with the rest of the meal. I thought the portions of the fried rice and Drunken Noodle to be fairly small. The rice was a little dry and we had to add our own hot sauce to help the consistency. The duck was sparse and a little fatty. The Drunken noodle was standard but nothing special.

Salty, sweet, savory, and slightly sour - the Thai flavors were all there.Pineapple Fried Rice [$12] with Chicken [+ $1]Jasmine rice, cashews, pineapple chunks, Madras curry powder The GF was itching to try the pineapple fried rice, which had a nice creamy, gluttonous texture to each bite, which was studded with bits of fresh veggies, cashes, and tomatoes. Despite the creamy texture of each bite, you could still make out the bite of each grain and the bits of chicken were plentiful and juicy.Trio may be our new go-to Thai place and I'm looking forward to trying some of their more authentic dishes - as well as some pad thai, natch.

We also tried the beggars pouches and the seafood hot pot with glass noodles which were both good too. Our server was nice and didn't judge us 3 small ladies throwing down every kind of bottle alcohol comes in, so that was cool.

The sweet chili dipping sauce was absolutely amazing, and the pouches served perfectly to get us hungry for our meals.We all split the Green Curry, Seafood Hot Pot, and the Drunken Noodles.The green curry was absolutely my favorite. Perfectly spicy and came ladden with veggies, chicken and rice. So refreshing and such a delicious sauce. I ended up putting the sauce on every dish cause it was so perfectly coconuty and spicy.The seafood hot pot was really great! Tons of shrimp, scallops, and calamari. Veggies on the side with rice were carrots, zucchini and squash. I wish there was a sauce involved but the lightness of the noodles with the seafood was really delicious, plus, the green curry was seeping into everything :)The drunken noodles were also delicious! Very gingery and lemon-grassy. Perfect compliment to our carbo loaded meal.Definitely coming here again as it was moderately priced and a BYOB!!One and only one downside: no chopsticks :("], ["Beth D.", "Ordered the pad Thai and the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were awesome, the perfect amount of spice. I would definitely order that again. The pad Thai on the other hand was a little disappointing. There just wasn't enough sauce to go around, I felt like they ran out of sauce or something. That is usually a safe go to when ordering Thai, I won't order that again from here.

Maybe he was just standing outside because it was a nice night? We were seated upstairs at a private little table, which was really great. Our server was Victoria and she was extremely warm and very helpful- I would give the service 5 stars. After reading reviews, we got the beggars pouches appetizer. The main flaw with this meal was that it took over 30 minutes for these to come out. Our server apologized and said there had been a large party downstairs that had their order in right before us. We weren't too upset because there were a couple drunk girls in the restaurant that were hilarious. It was seriously like dinner and a show listening to their commentary, and they ended up giving us their half-full bottle of wine when they left. Score! I just hope they didn't drive home... After the appetizer, it took still a little longer for the entrees to come out. My boyfriend and I split the pad woonsen glass noodles with tofu and the fried rice with lemongrass meatballs. I was too worried to try the pad thai again after how lackluster it was the last time. The glass noodles had tons more fresh veggies than before and the flavors were really good in both dishes.

Spectacular!I've been notorious to only get the aw lao, a lemongrass and eggplant soup dish over sticky rice. So delicious. Friends have been known to get green curry, the pad-kee-mao, and sweet basil fried rice with rave reviews!

There's the usual assortment of curries, seafood, and rice plates. Fresh spring rolls ($3.95; vegetarian; cash only, last I checked) come with a side of sweet plum sauce and a pleasantly tart fish sauce. Try the pad kee mao ($10.95; with beef): While it could be spicier and the beef is almost dangerously dry, the sauteed rice noodles are moist, and the mix of onions, carrots, broccoli, chili peppers, bean sprouts, and basil give it flavor and color."], ["Wendy W.", "i love the renovations! \u00a0the restaurant is now more spacious and seats more people. \u00a0lots of hits and misses here. \u00a0love: \u00a0homemade sausage (well seasoned and great to share with a group); duck curry (this is the largest portion of duck that i have ever been served for a duck curry. \u00a0the meat is meaty and not overcooked), deep fried catfish (hit or miss, when done right it is crispy but not dried, when done wrong, it just tastes bad); the sticky rice that comes with your entree (served in a small bamboo container that keeps your rice warm and fresh).meh: \u00a0paneang curry (i love peanut butter, but not peanut butter curry); cornish hen (looked and tasted like chicken than cornish hen).the service is always spot on. \u00a0i love the family business feel and they are always accomodating to large parties.overall, a good place to go with the family."], ["Mickey A.", "This is my go to restaurant!

The driver accidentally switched my order with someone else's, so I had to wait for him to come back, which wouldn't have been a huge deal if the food had been decent, but...Also, it seemed slightly odd to me that the delivery guy took the food from me when it had been in my possession for a full half hour. I totally could have poisoned it or something. I'd never do that, but I'm just sayin. Seemed like a bit of a liability.Onto the food. We got an order of chicken fried rice, spring rolls, a spicy tuna roll, and a spicy salmon roll with avocado, both with brown rice.The sushi came with white rice instead of brown, which is a huge pet peeve of mine when I'm trying to trick myself into thinking that I'm being semi-healthy. The sushi was by no means the freshest I've had. The chicken fried rice was dry and really lacking in that delicious MSG flavor that I've come to know and love.

I should've known better, since most places that attempt to do two separate types of cuisine (like Thai and Japanese) are very rarely any good. Service was fine, though. From ordering to delivery it took about an hour. I ordered the vegetable Roe Yaki Udon, which was listed as one of their \"chef signature hot dishes.\" Admittedly, I interpreted that as meaning it would be spicy, so I was extremely disappointed when it arrived and it had zero spice whatsoever. The noodles were salty and greasy, and the tofu was in such small pieces that it was difficult to taste it. The portion definitely wasn't worth $10.95, either.

I ordered a Lunchbox which cost more than 15 dollar. It came with one dumpling with really dry meat in it and a little curry. I chose shrimp in my green curry so I had to pay two dollars more.

Only a little bit of vegetables in little amount of curry sauce.?Dishonest business. Worst customer service ever. It was the receptionist's fault that she didn't tell me earlier that my address is 3 miles away from their restaurant when I ordered the \u00a0food. After waiting for more than half an hour, I was expecting a phone call that asked me to pick up the food downstairs. However, she called me to pay 3 dollars extra or they will not deliver me food.Bad customer service. I called the restaurant and reported the problems to the receptionist.She didn't feel sorry at all. \u00a0She said that the lunch box is what it should be.

After telling him how disappointed I was I offered my order number so he could know what order I was talking about. He said \" I'll talk to staff and I got it\". I was even more disappointed that he didn't apologize nor did he offer a refund or gift certificate to try them again.

Their miso soup is good and has these little mushroom things in it that I haven't seen in other miso soup I've gotten. My favorite is their Pineapple rice. It actually comes inside a pineapple! It has saffron and pineapple in it. It's a little bit more mild on taste (verses traditional friend rice) but it's not greasy at all and it doesn't feel heavy the way rice usually does.Every time I've been here I get one of two women waitresses. I wish I knew their names because they are amazingly sweet! Even when a costumer at the table next to us was asking her questions I would have considered were a bit on the racist side, she handled it well and never lost her composure or politeness (I feel bad I didn't call the guy out on it like I should have).I've never tried their pickup/delivery, but for in-house eating I definitely recommend it!"], ["Andrew W.", "Ordered from here on Valentine's night, my order was never delivered and they told my multiple times that i would receive my order within 10 mins that the driver is on the road.

Do I need to go ask someone? Very confusing. When I walked to the back, a few of the servers smiled, but didn't ask if I needed help or if I needed to be seated. So I'm left standing, awkwardly, among other diners. The food was... Meh..... It looked pretty, though. The server was very nice! I liked her, but we only saw her twice. Once when she took our order and second, when she left the check.  They were also playing two different types of music. I heard hip hop in one area and some traditional Asian music in another.

Prices were cheap, but I thought that portion sizes were a little small... kind of reminded me of the small space of the restaurant. However, that being said, I didn't feel ripped off. Prices were adjusted for the smaller portion sizes. A friend and I split the Panang Curry with just veggies (unless tofu is fried I don't want it) and the drunken noodles (Pad Khimao) with chicken. I was happy to split two dishes so I could try two of my favorite staples at any run-of-the-mill Thai place, but I was just coming off of post workout and the hunger was real (talking borderline hangry) and I just wanted more food than what was in front of me. Thank god it was a BYOB and we had ample wine to deal with that issue.I think they way they served the curry at this place was super strange though! It was served on a flat plate. Makes it a little difficult to eat curry. I had a spoon and I couldn't ladle any of the delicious-ness on to my plate, which made me sad. The only other thing that was weird was that our food was brought out at different times. We had all ordered dinner portions and for whatever reason, they brought out one person's much earlier than the other dishes.

Their Thai Iced Tea is good, just a classic. \u00a0I liked it to go and in the restaurant, so no difference there.Their Chicken Pad Thai is pretty huge - when I get it as take out, it usually lasts me two full meals, and by full, I mean that I'm really full after eating about half! \u00a0It's just your typical Pad Thai - nice rice noodles, great sauce and some peanuts sprinkled on top. \u00a0Mostly, I just find the quality to be really good - no MSG or any gross aftertaste that I've been fighting to avoid with take-out. \u00a0My roommate still prefers Circles in this department because theirs is more garlicky and has more of a kick, but I prefer Jasmine Rice's milder take, so it all depends on your preferences. \u00a0I think I get a bigger portion at Jasmine Rice too, so that makes a difference! The Chicken Massaman curry is a really tasty - it's has potatoes, carrots, chunks of onions and sprinkled with peanuts. \u00a0The sauce is tasty, mild, although don't get it if you aren't a fan of coconut. \u00a0I loved it because I can't handle anything very spicy, but do enjoy rich flavors. \u00a0This was a great dish for someone who doesn't want to compromise on something bland, but isn't in the mood for something super spicy! \u00a0FYI - Order it with rice - when my roommate ordered it as takeout it did not come with rice, so it wasn't something she had leftovers for the next day. \u00a0But it's still worth it, delicious flavors that don't overpower the veggies and chicken. \u00a0The Green Curry with Chicken was spicy, but not too spicy. \u00a0It wasn't anything super exciting in my opinion, I much preferred the Massaman to it!The owners are also very nice - and the service is great. \u00a0It takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be ready if you order for take-out. \u00a0I've generally waited a few minutes when I got there right at 20 minutes during peak dinner hours, so I might give them five more minutes next time. \u00a0But they're very friendly and make it easy to pay while you wait.Just FYI - it's BYOB if you go there, as their website suggests! \u00a0So don't forget to bring your own wine!"], ["Raj D.", "We went there yesterday based on the (mostly good) reviews on Yelp. The service was very courteous and that is the only reason why I'd give it 2 stars instead of 1. They can prepare dish, according to their menu, at different spice levels. So, I selected one of the dishes that looked interesting (The King and I) and I ordered it to be prepared at medium spice without the pineapples that apparently came with it.The dish came stocked with pineapples tasting like shrimps in sugar syrup ! I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a fuss of it, but regardless, when the host came by to ask how the dish was, I mentioned that it was too sugary. He explained that somehow his internet system had gone down when he was sending the instructions to the kitchen. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but with only 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant at the time, perhaps a little more attention to what is happening in the kitchen and how the food is being served would do well.I'd accept their apology, but to be a great restaurant, you need to look at various aspects of the experience and simply being courteous to guests is only but 2/5ths of task at hand."], ["Luke D.", "So I've been here twice now, and I have to say it is really just OK. Positives include the service and a great guy who may or may not be an owner. Also, the veggie dumplings were really very good. On the other hand, both entrees I have had were mediocre. Most recently I tried \"The King and I\"--\"Jumbo shrimp & chicken saut\u00e9ed in prik khing coconut curry paste with fresh string beans and bell peppers.\" The shrimp were anything but jumbo, and the coconut curry paste was bland, lacking any distinguishable flavor. Veggies were fine. Asked for 4/5 spicy and didn't receive (a recurring problem in Philadelphia Thai restaurants it seems). Before that, I had the Jatujak Stir-fried with chicken--also bland-ish and not very different even though this was a thai basil paste. Will probably go back because of the area, and hopeful for an improvement."], ["Kat S.", "Had dinner here last night with a friend. It's a small, quaint place. It wasn't too crowded last night around 7. My friend got the chicken satay skewers and I got the ginger dumplings. The dumplings were delicious and crunchy. The sauce for the satay skewers was also very tasty. For our entrees we both go Chicken Pad Thai. It was ok. The portion was a little on the smaller side and it didn't have as much peanut flavor as I prefer. My friend had been there before and got the Duck dish and said it was amazing. The service was good and prompt. I would try Jasmine Rice again and try a different entree."], ["Elizabeth M.", "Ordered take out after hearing rave reviews from friends and on Yelp.

I'm personally a huge fan of Thai food, and really wanted to find a good BYO spot to satisfy my cravings. Was so happy to find Jasmine Rice! It's a super small space-- probably the best for parties of 4-6 and nothing bigger. The food is quite tasty-- tried the green curry, pad kee mao, pad thai, basil tofu, green tea mochi dessert, and fried banana + ice cream dessert. I actually loved every single dish-- (would probably not recommend getting dessert just because it's nothing TOO special, but still a great way to finish a tasty meal). Ended up staying in the restaurant for around 4 hours-- felt no pressure to leave by the servers. This place will 100% be top-of-mind for me when planning my next BYOs. I feel like not that many students know about it, but it definitely should be more popular!"], ["Kay T.", "The food was very good. The reason for the three stars is the noise level. I was with three other people in a corner table and we had to shout to hear each other. If the restaurant could work on the noise level, it would absolutely get more stars. The pad see ew got great reviews from the person who ordered it. I got The King and I (veg/chicken/shrimp stir fry) and it was excellent. Nice heat and curry flavor. The pad thai was a bit sweet I thought, but the person who ordered it really liked it.Portion sizes are not enormous. We had some leftovers but also didn't come in starving.Good service, very attentive. The noise level was the only negative."], ["Andrew B.", "A pretty small place right around the corner of 16th and spruce. It's a good place to get Thai take out.

The owner/manager was very nice too."]], "Thai Singha House": [["Robert B.", "Very happy after our meal.Our spring roll appetizers were served quickly and eaten just as quickly--crisp, tasty, with a delicious dipping sauce.I had my usual green curry--excellent rendition, spicy and fragrant. My spouse experimented with ginger chicken (and asked for a light hand with the salt). All conversation stopped as she devoured all but one little piece given to me (a little reluctantly). Usually, I get about a third of any entree. We were almost alone in the cozy restaurant & hope more folks will try it. Certainly we'll return and enjoy the food and friendly service."], ["Jemi J.", "Dependable local thai. Wow. Words I thought I would never say in my time here in University City.I LOVEEE their drunken noodles. Can be a bit oily, especially when you order take out. But not too spicy, just perfect. Their spring rolls with the sauce are delish. I especially love how they were a part of University City dining days, so I was able to try things off their menu I never would have originally thought of, like their fried ice-cream ( not too bad), and a drink I can't seem to remember. It's a tight squeeze inside the restaurant though, so if you really want to eat here, probably get a reservation."], ["Roopa S.", "This place is 10x better than Pattaya. So glad it's here and super convenient for when I'm craving greasy and delicious thai food! I've tried a couple of the noodle dishes here, all of which have been fantastic. Service is great as well. Prices are very typical prices that you would find at a thai restaurant-- not too expensive and not too cheap either. Place is kind of small so not super ideal for very large groups, but it's a BYO and so definitely make use of that!Overall, great thai place near campus.

The place is very well-kept and clean, which is always a good sign. Lovely ambiance!Their menu is extensive and serves up your typical Thai dishes. I wanted to try something I usually don't order so I ordered their seafood lemongrass noodle soup. I'm so glad I did because it was just delicious. The soup was great, and the lemongrass flavor was perfect and not overwhelming. It was slightly tangy and went really well with the seafood. Included in the noodle soup were shrimp, squid, fish balls, and fried wontons. Everything was very good, and I left impressed with the taste of their food and their quality. Great Thai place in UC!"], ["Elise M.", "Thai Singha is back! I've been a long time fan of Thai Singha, and was so sad when it closed about a year and a half ago. But now it is back, and I couldn't be more excited. It moved to a location just down the street from the original location. The decor and ambiance are brighter and livelier, the food is still delicious, and it is now BYO! I prefer Thai Singha over Pattaya, which is just down the street. At Thai Singha, the specials are better and the food has more flavor. I highly recommend having dinner at Thai Singha if you are looking for a casual, enjoyable dinner with yummy Thai food."], ["Jinsol L.", "I had heard wonderful reviews about the original Thai Singha before it closed, so I was pretty keen on checking it out when it opened. My first impression of the establishment was that it was super small, with only one or two waitresses who were doing everything - seating, taking orders, serving, etc. As such, service was definitely below par in the evening when it was pretty crowded. It took ages for anyone to seat us, replenish our waters, or even take our orders. When our orders finally arrived, I couldn't help but notice that the portions looked somewhat small compared to most Thai places I've been to, so don't expect to be super full/take any home from one serving.That being said, the ambiance is nice, clean, and cozy. The food was also deliciously flavorful! Definitely enjoyed each of the different dishes I've had including the standard pad thai, drunken noodles, green curry, penang curry, etc. Plus, when I had take-out from this place, it arrived much earlier than the prediction on Grubhub, so that was excellent.I was really wavering between 3 and 4 stars, but I'll favor the good food over the small(ish) portions/sub-par service. And okay, it is nice to have more than one option for Thai food in University City!"], ["Victoria L.", "I really hate giving places 2 stars, but my experience here could have definitely been better. My sister and I came here for the lunch special. Oh boy did we feel completely ripped off! FOOD:We began our course with the coconut soup and wonton soup. Both were very bland and extremely watery. For the coconut soup, it almost tasted as if we were drinking coconut flavored water with chewy chunks of chicken. For appetizers, we had the dumplings and friend wontons. Two minuscule, quarter-sized dumplings came out on a plate that looked too big for it. It was so sad! The fried wontons made up for the dumplings, but only JUST a little. Our main entrees were the shrimp pad thai and the chicken red curry. The pad thai was a nice surprise and it was pretty good! The red curry was okay. I've also ordered vegetable pad thai take-out from here. Excited for my pad thai, I was thinking it would taste as good as it would the last time I was there. BUT the pad thai was COMPLETELY pink. It was almost a salmon pink and extremely flavorless with too little ingredients.SERVICE/AMBIENCE: The service was attentive and friendly. Our waitress was sweet and nice! The inside is very nicely decorated and has a very casual atmosphere. It's also a BYOB, so that's a plus! Maybe if the food improves I'll venture here again to give it a third chance!"], ["Lawrence L.", "Figures that for under $11, I'll do the dinner special. The 3 piece fried tofu was a littl disappointing, sauce was okay, the soup was average (little on the salty side) & lastly, the shrimp pad thai, now having eaten at plenty of thai joints, the pad thai is either ketsupy (tomatoey) or just right. It was the former; not too bad, won't really come back for their pad thai anytime soon. Either case, what do you expect for $11 then again, had I ordered the pad thai as a normal entre, will have been disappointed.

Making the order over the phone was easy and I was thankful they delivered to us when some others feel we're too far out. Despite being near 52nd and Baltimore, food came in 35 minutes. The Pad Kee Mao Gai - Drunken Noodles with chicken - was solid and the medium- spicy that I requested was right on target. My partner's Pad Thai Tofu was so-so, she knew it wasn't going to be above average when she saw it had a bit of a pink-tint to its sauce. The Tom Ka Gai - Chicken Coconut Soup - was perfect - better than Circles! Ordered a quart and am so pleased. For us, this is better than sitting down at Vientene or ordering from Lemongrass Thai. Solid option."], ["Steph V.", "My sister and I came here for dinner late one night. It's in a building where you walk up a small set of stairs, and the lobby is shared with another restaurant. It's not confusing though, don't worry. It's very clean, has great service, and is not loud!I ordered the pad see ew, and I really enjoyed it. What a good amount of food, and I didn't finish, so it was enough to bring home to make another meal! My sister ordered the lemongrass noodle soup. She really enjoyed it. I tried a little bit of it, and I really liked the lemongrass taste that complemented the seafood in the soup. I would say it was a little bit on the sweet side, so maybe ask for it a little spicier, but other than that, I really enjoyed this place."], ["Grace L.", "I may have to adjust my rating for Pattaya after coming here...I really missed this place after it went away from campus 2 years ago, and was excited when I passed by on a route I take frequently everyday--so it's a very convenient location for me! My boyfriend and I walked in here on a snowy night, at around 9:30 PM; relatively empty since it just opened, but we didn't mind at all. We were seated prompted, attended to quickly, and our food came out in record time. I got drunken noodles with tofu like I usually do at Thai restaurants, and it was the best drunken noodles I've had so far! The tofu was perfectly crisp, and the noodles were not too greasy. My boyfriend ordered chicken pad thai, which I also preferred over that of Pattaya; not too greasy, ample amount of meat, generous heaping of peanuts. I'm definitely a fan and would come back for a nice dinner or BYO!"], ["Sneha K.", "I was very excited to hear that Thai Singha is back in business! The Chicken Drunken Noodles here were a staple of my diet and I was so excited to have them back in my life. The restaurant has moved to a smaller location but its food is delicious as ever and it is now a BYOB. I came here for dinner a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised by the dinner special menu they offered ($10.95 for a soup, appetizer and entree). While Thai Singha's food isn't the best thai food I've eaten (I prefer Vientiane or Bangkok Thai 9), I think it is one of the best around University City. I am also a little disappointed that it now imposes a delivery fee on Grubhub when Pattaya right next door doesn't."], ["Kimberly Y.", "Apparently no one knows about Thai Singha's return, as it seems to be quite empty these days. They have relocated down the street to 39th and Chestnut in a corner of a building complex. Even from the outside, you can tell the interior is super clean and well lit, unlike Pattaya's more dimly lit vibe with ethnic music. The service was not the most attentive or well-staffed, which makes sense given the few people inside. My server was slightly impolite, but in reality probably just new and awkward.I had the chicken pad see ew, which was tasty and large enough to take some leftovers back home. Although some of the more exotic dishes like lamb and duck had scarily high prices, I was glad to find the other dishes were reasonably priced and competitive with Pattaya.

Really, my new favorite, and as close to 5 stars as any Philadelphia Thai takeout has gotten for me, tbh.Tonight was now my second takeout experience, and second time happy. My first go around, I got a wrong item in my order which was quickly taken care of with a no questions, no stress refund for that item. No wrong items tonight, thankfully. Everyone loves a good pad Thai and a good Thai curry. These two items were verified by my recent orders. Vegetable pad Thai was an absolutely huge portion. It had a ton of veggies, but a good balance between noodles, sauce and veggies. So often, the rice noodles are over cooked, or there's way too much or way too little sauce, or the veggie:noodle ratio is wayyyyy off. These are all rookie mistakes for pretty much the most iconic Thai dish (in America, anyway) that you can get. No sir, none of that here.Tonight, I ordered Salmon Thai Curry-perfect spiciness level with a nice thin sauce to soak up that rice. I was honestly shocked that the salmon was not even the least bit overcooked. SHOCKED. I ordered it just assuming that it would be standard overcooked salmon, that's how much I wanted salmon curry. My only complaint would be to add more veggies to the salmon dish-it was pretty much just a (good sized) salmon filet with 3-4 red pepper matchsticks and a few basil leaves. A surprising appetizer that I ordered were the scallion cakes. Holy oh my goodness, these are damn good! NOT what I was expecting. A large amount of cooked chives wrapped in a soft, fried dough, with a ridiculously good sweet soy garlic dipping sauce. Get these!I will order from here again.

With a new and even more convenient location, Thai Singha has started the conversation as to which is the top Thai restaurant around.The menu is none too different from that of Pattaya, with the conventional pad thai, pad see ew, drunken noodle, etc. There are also additional vegetarian options for those of that diet. In general, the portions are just right and the ingredients and flavors are done right. I can't say that the dishes are much different from Pattaya or better, perhaps because I haven't been to Pattaya since Thai Singha reopened.

I actually really enjoyed the picked veggies underneath, which were crunchy and tart. My two friends both ordered the fried tofu, which came with three small tofu triangles and was served with a plum dipping sauce.For the entre\u00e9, I ordered the chicken red curry, which came with white rice and some boiled, seasoned cabbage/carrots. The curry was flavorful and quite spicy, and there were basil leaves, bamboo shoots, and slices of chicken breast thrown in.

A short walk from my house, I found this teenie tiny little Thai \"hut\" with friendly people behind the counter and the scents of some delicious Thai food filling the room. How have I not been here before?I opted for an item that wasn't on the $6 lunch special list, but I only paid $7.50 for it, so I wasn't feeling particularly bad about the extra $1.50. Especially after I received my meal and it was a HUGE steaming hot portion of noodles, veggies, and chicken. I got the Pad Sui Ew, one of my Thai go-tos, it was perfectly prepared. I also have an entire second meal in the fridge for lunch today.This seems to be the perfect lunch spot. There are like 3 stools in the window, but this is really a true carry out place (hence the \"to-go\" in the restaurant name). If you go just past peak lunch hours you will not wait at all, I walked in without any line at all. Plus I called ahead.

But, you can't really blame them for this. I mean, come on - they have like, 5 minutes to cook your order before you get angry that it's not ready, because it's a take out place and that stuff should get done top speed!Again, totally worth it.

The difference - popular items like the Pad Thai and Curry are kept in heated trays and other stuff is whipped up when ordered. Everything is still super fresh, regardless.My favorites are Drunken Noodles and Lad Na, both regular lunch options.

He also gave good vegetarian recommendations (shout-out to my fellow herbivores), as well as informing us of what's popular at the restaurant. I ended up ordering the Panang curry with brown rice on a level 3 spice range, with 1 being the mildest and 5 being the spiciest. It was PERFECT. Everything, from the appearance to the spices, was just sublime. I was a bit upset that they took away my dish with a few bites left (I planned on finishing all of it!) when the cake came out. However, everything else was just so nice and I knew I was going to come back, so it didn't affect me toooo much. Since we had a large table, I wasn't sure what everyone else got, but it all looked pretty good. Can't wait to come back here on Friday for their lunch specials!A special mention has to go out to the manager/Xiandu queen Nancy. She has got to be one of the coolest, kindest managers I have ever interacted with! She kept the place open well past their closing time to make sure we were well accommodated and not rushed out. This is just one of the many examples of true customer service.

Just a kind note for readers. The waiter kindly brought over some coconut milk that's used in the curries which I put on top of my noodles which alleviated the spice and actually added a nice flavor. I brought most of the noodles home which I added a zillion vegetables to to dilute the taste, and in retrospect (my stupidity for ordering the 3..YIKES), the food was really good, and same with the service. Every night they have a specialty cocktail for $5 which is really cool too, just make sure to ask!

The flavors were good, but the flavor just isnt deep enough. There isnt enough seasoning and the dishes just arent spicy enough. I know they probably tone it down to make it more approacahable for the non-Thai customers, but thats the beauty of Thai food, the sweat on your upperlip, hot flash kind of heat. It doesnt burn deep, but it definietly leaves your mouth tingling and makes your body temperature rise a few degrees. It was a common theme through all the dishes. The flavor was good, but not enough seasoning or heat in the curry, papaya salad, or the Khao Pad Ka Paro Gung. The best executed of the dishes was the Tom Yum soup. The traditional sour and spicy flavors were there, again the heat was a little lacking, but it wasnt as missed in this soup. This was actually some of the better Thai food I have found in Philly so far. It still isnt up to snuff in my opinion in terms of where the flavors should be, but it was a pretty decent effort.

So naturally, I'm a little more picky because I've tried a lot of it. (Ugh, yes, Thailand is on my list of places to travel!)We only split a Panang curry and it was good! Personally, I wish it was a little more creamy (more coconut milk) not to reduce the spice level, but to just add some richness. It was a good portion to split since we got two rices.

Only upon repeated questioning into the status of our sticky rice did he even make an effort to go back to the kitchen and place the order. Five minutes has now turned to 20 minutes.

Probably because of the green walls.Started with the Tao-hoo-taud, crispy fried tofu that was light and the perfect texture, served with a peanut sweet and sour sauce. Loved it. The Tom-kha was a bit different than I'm used to. The broth was perfectly white, with vegetables, coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and mushrooms. Not at all spicy, but really flavorful. Had the Pad-kee-mao-gai for my entree, and it was crazy delicious. Stir-fried flat noodle with veggies, bell peppers, thai basil, garlic, and chili. The sauce was ridiculously flavorful. I should've asked for it spicy, but didn't, so I added chili powder, and it was perfect.

I got \"spicy\" and they weren't, really. So, you know. I also had the Green Curry which is something that I always get at Thai places. I don't like Pad Thai, so Green Curry is my staple.

It was night two of my Thai cravings and I had to satisfy the beast. The hype of Sawatdee's opening has definitely waned and we were able to score a table with no problem. Service was notably better than my previous two experiences at lunch and dinner. Water glasses were kept filled and everything was cooked just the way we asked. For a starter, we shared the grilled chicken skewers with peanut sauce and cucumber relish. A nice little bite before the meal and not too heavy, either. I ordered chicken pad Thai sans tofu for my main, and I opted for a two star level of spiciness out of three. At first, the dish didn't seem spicy, but it was a deceptively slow burn. By the time I was three quarters of the way through, I was chugging water and had to tap out. Next time, I'll go with one star of heat. Truth be told, I'm kind of a heat pansy. But my meal was damn good nonetheless. I don't know what they do at Sawatdee that is different from other Thai places, but the noodles are just so much better. They easily swirl around a fork and are never stuck together. And the flavors of all the ingredients really pop. That was especially true for my dining partner's dish, the pad kee mao gai. Wow, was that good. I'm not positive that my cravings for Thai have truly been satisfied at this point. It probably won't be long before I'm back for another fix."], ["Joyce R.", "We found this restaurant by accident and were pleasantly surprised.

I do not understand how \"not too much ice please\" translated to \"don't fill the drink to the top\". Seriously, how much can you save by being stingy to your customers. So I left with my drink, filled 3/4 of the way (picture attached), since I requested less ice. I even made a comment regarding to how much was filled, and they merely just added more ice. If you eat here, don't order your drink to go because you will be left feeling jipped. Also, their thai ice tea is terribly sweet!"], ["L R.", "The good news is that even mediocre Thai food makes a great take-out meal and its made even better by pleasant speedy delivery service on bicycles at 9:30pm. I'm curious where all these great reviews came from and Im wondering if maybe we just had a bland experience because its late on a Monday night. Maybe they ran out of the fragrant Thai basil, lemon grass, kefir lime leaves and galangal that make me love Thai. \u00a0Or Perhaps the people writing these reviews haven't experienced thai food on the streets of Thailand. \u00a0Anyhow... The service is excellent and remarkably pleasant so we will return. This restaurant is adorable. Every time I walk by I make a mental note to give it a try - We finally got around to it this evening. Authentic Thai? No...not so much. The green curry and panang definitely don't have the flavor punch I'm used to in Thailand, they both lack a spicy kick and sadly the sauce is so so thin. \u00a0Both the green and panang have the same exact veggies (carrots, green beans and green bell peppers) and i may have come across 1-2 basil leaves. \u00a0Spring rolls were good. Tom yum didnt have any galangal or kefir lime leaves and had more fish sauce than any spice. \u00a0The mushrooms they chose were great in there though. \u00a0We were looking for another Thai option besides Circles and our favorite Cafe de Laos but this didn't cut it. We will give it another try before giving up. \u00a0Perhaps they're better for an eat-in afternoon lunch at their adorable green and blue restaurant.Update: **Ya know... I should know better. Of course we can't find an \"authentic\" tasting Thai place that tastes quite the same as the food on the streets of Thailand. \u00a0 Its like trying to eat American or Italian in Asia.

Otherwise, they all hovered, refilled water if our glasses were even an inch lower than full and generally made it hilariously awkward/amusing for us.

No one ever asked if we wanted another.Multiple mistakes were made (I'm not kidding, more than 10). When we clarified they make additional mistakes on drink order clarifications. These were not complicated drinks.They forgot food for 2 of 12- 84% isn't too bad. It came AFTER 10 of us had finished our meals!Summary: Open up a food truck, retrain your staff or find something else you might be good at. Recommendation for you- RUN, fast... Elsewhere.

We found Baan Thai via Yelp. It seems most other reviewers were on-point! I highly recommend the duck salad, which is a non-obesity-sized portioned salad generously mixed with crispy duck, onions, tomatoes, mint, spinach, etc. Probably the most satisfyingly protein-rich salad I've had in a \"nice\" restaurant. Worth every penny of the $8. We also had the combination appetizer platter, which was tasty too. We washed it down with our own wine. Oh did I forget to mention that it's a BYOB? Glorious.I was hoping to find their carousel of authentic Thai spices, but they didn't have it. The various sauces provided with our order were nice, but did not include anything hot, so I had to ask for hot sauce. They brought me a mild sauce. It was no good. I called some random waiter and insisted that he bring me back \"authentic, original, real Thai hot sauce\". He didn't understand much English, but he understood enough (based on my intense facial expressions, I suppose). He brought me something appropriately fiery. It wasn't what I'm accustomed to, but it was flavorful and fiery enough. We left a nice tip, because it was earned.If you're looking for a place to \"dress up and be seen\" and to blow tons of cash on bland food for the privilege, Baan Thai is not for you. It's a family-friendly, mom-and-pop outfit, with decent decor, decent prices, great service, attentive wait-staff, lots of casual guests, and TASTY food.

After eating a few pieces of \"weird chicken with skin on it\" my friends pointed out that the white chunk I was eating was indeed tofu. I will definitely pay more attention next time. le sigh. The noodles were tasty and there was a great abundance of bean sprouts (which are my all-time favorite component of Thai food). Basically I need to come back. Soon.BYOB, by the way.

I can understand if Baan Thai omitted those ingredients to satisfy western palates unfamiliar with those flavors.Pad kee maoThis was excellent. Spicy and a little sweet, the way it should be!Massaman curry Ugh. This dish made me so sad. Massaman curry is my favorite food in the entire world. It should be beef stewed for a long time in a rich curry. The beef was cooked to order rather than stewed.

The vegetarian pad thai with tofu and vegetables was good. Honestly, not great, but good. Lots of veggies, lots of peanuts, lots of tofu, decent flavor. Totally worthy of late night delivery/pick-up.

All are very yummy - Tom Yum Soup is great for when you're not feeling well or it's just a bitterly cold evening.
