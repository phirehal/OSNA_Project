He quickly rattled through the specials, not really giving us time to decide and would disappear for longer than necessary. But he was always at the other table's beck and all. \u00a0Probably because they were a bunch of nice blonde girls. He brought them out free samples and generally just chatted them up. There was even a few times that he sat down at their table to chat some more. When we asked for the check, Andy casually threw the check on our table and walked away.

Service: very professional and made great recommendations. Here are some of my favorite menu:1. Special monster rolls (my favorite. It is so good that we ordered the second one) 2. Tuna (in small platter section)3. Surf and turf ( this is a special menu and it was awesome!!! It consist of perfectly cooked medium rare wagyu beef and seared scallop) 4. Seared scallops (in small platter section)5. sunomono (good for light appetizer but some may think that it is not that great compared to other alternatives but I still like it) 6.uni sashimi is awesome. (But if u don't like sashimi then u might want to skip this. Their scent can be strong for those who are not used to uni) 7. Pan seared scallop (large plate section. I think this menu is good but not great as compared to other menu I just recommended but if u are a scallop fan like I am, you will like this menu too since the scallops are served with mashed taro blended with potato and some vegetable pur\u00e9e which is so good) However, there are some menu which I think is so so:1. Passyunk avenue roll2. Tuna wasabi salsaAs for dessert, their chocolate bread pudding served with coconut ice cream is superbbbb. Love it!! We also ordered lychee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which is also good but a little too sweet in my opinion.

By 'nice' I mean classy decor/ambiance and fancy-looking food in minuscule portions. I understand this is sushi, and sushi comes at a price. But when you spend $60 for two people and still have to stop at Wendy's on the way to the movie theater afterward, the tiny amounts of food better be pretty amazing to be worth it. The $25 sashimi platter comes with precisely 15 small and pretty thin but artistically cut slices of 5 kinds of fish. Two were your standard salmon and tuna, and the other three were fluke, mackerel, and something like snapper or yellowtail, I don't quite remember. While the sushi here was marginally better than many less-expensive sushi restaurants, I'm not sure it was worth the price markup. For me, there's a threshold where, once sushi is reasonably good, I care more about being able to get full without breaking the bank over minute improvements in fish quality. That being said, the sushi here is pretty tasty (especially the spicy tuna maki and the mackerel sashimi). If you want to impress someone with a fancy sushi place and spend a lot of money in the process (I would guess ~$100 per couple to get full), then this is your place (or Morimoto, I guess).

I was impressed with the sushi plate arrangements. I liked how they actually took time to arrange your sushi into a nice pattern on your plate and make it look fancy no matter what you got.I also liked how the specialty rolls here are actually worth your money and are twice the size of a regular roll with twice the fish and beautiful presentation as well. A lot of other sushi places scam you by covering a regular roll with a bunch of mayonnaise or cheap toppings and charge you extra by calling it a specialty roll. My only minor complaint about their sushi is that for the cucumber in my Alaska roll, they did not julienne the cucumbers to thin spaghetti-like slices. Instead, the cucumber was just one whole piece. It ruined the texture of the roll. Cucumber skin is tought when you have to chew through a whole piece.Service was okay during lunch, nothing spatacular.

I had the room booked for two hours but there was no one booked after us so we were able to extend it for another hour. Since our tab exceeded $500 the room rental fee was waived.

And the food menu touted the decent sized portions of the sushi, dumpling, and noodle dishes that you'd expect.The one issue I could give was that the karaoke book was listed by song title instead of artist, making them harder to navigate through. I was also sad to see some essential songs that you'd expect to see in such a book like \"White Wedding\" by Billy Idol and \"Psycho Killer\" by Talking Heads missing. And while it was completely weird and perfectly random, I did love the odd vignettes that played during the songs, and wondered what romantic yet tragically awkward situations we could lead the characters in them through.

Usually people order delivery because they CAN'T come pick up the food. So I said \"no unfortunately I can't pick up the food\" and the response I got was \"ok let me talk to my manager\". A minute later the lady gets back on the phone and says \"I am sorry we don't have anyone that can deliver the food but next time you order delivery we can give you 15% off.\"I am still trying to decipher what's more ridiculous, the fact that the restaurant would not go out of their way to deliver food to a loyal customer who waited for over an hour despite the restaurant's self-acknowledged mistake or the fact they think its appropriate to offer someone 15% off the next time you order from there after the restaurant made an egregious mistake.An intelligent restaurant manager that genuinely cares for his customer base would make every concerted effort to deliver the food (ie. make one of his employees drive 10 minutes to the customer's place) and deliver the food at a significantly discounted price (if not free). 15% is 3 dollars of the order. Thanks but no thanks.Fortunately, Philly is a haven for foodie's. Zero necessity to ever come back here."], ["Amy M.", "Doma is consistently delicious.

We found Doma and decided to go try it. We've been there 5 times since. The most recent experience was last night and it was phenomenal as usual. First off, we've sat at the same table every time we have eaten there and it is my favorite table (the first high top towards the back of the restaurant). We brought a bottle of wine which our server uncorked and put on ice for us (it's BYOB). We got the Yakuza, Medusa, Island, and Naked Tuna rolls along with a salmon skin hand roll and the octopus ceviche for a starter. The ceviche was excellent (better than I was even expecting) and the rolls were delicious as always.

The interior is chic, without seeming overdone, consisting of a white and beige d\u00e9cor accented by metallic details, as trendy IKEA-esque decorations adorn the ceiling and walls.Though advertised as a sushi place, the extensive menu, consisting of both Korean and Japanese dishes, provides plenty of alternatives for those in your group who are not up for eating raw fish. And even if you're a hardcore sushi fan, don't just stop at that. After all, where else can you have bibimbap and sushi in one sitting? \u00a0Oh, and if you're one of those super picky people who has to know exactly what they're eating -- they do this nifty thing where they have code letters; \"i\" for inside and \"o\" for outside, conveniently letting you know the ins and outs of each roll.Conventional sushi rolls pale in comparison to the signature rolls here. With quirky standouts like the Pachinko Roll ($15), which has shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber on the inside and tuna, kiwi, mango, eel and wasabi mayo on the outside, and the Triple Spicy Double Tuna Roll ($13), which combines spicy sauce, sriracha and sichimi peppers for a real kick, Doma certainly isn't afraid to experiment with offbeat ingredients.Rolls aside, the rest of the menu stands well on its own. The entrees, also referred to as \"kitchen dishes,\" consist of a range of hot traditional Japanese and Korean fare. The bibimbap ($15) was excellent and certainly filling for one person, though is best if shared and enjoyed in accompaniment to other dishes on the menu.Overall, Doma is a great place to go if you're craving good Japanese/Korean food and either not down to drop big bucks for Morimoto or simply bored of Pod sushi after one too many lunches with parents. \u00a0Just make sure to make reservations in advance -- the place seats no more than 50 people at a time, so it may be harder for larger groups to find a place to sit."], ["Ben G.", "I first walked in and was greeted by the host and he walked my family to our seats, he was very polite and he listened to what we wanted to eat and explained perfectly what was what.

There were two \"pumpkins\" per order, each slightly larger than a large egg. The lobster salad was cold, fresh, succulent, and moist. The Bluefin tuna on the outside was equally fresh and delicious.Seaweed Salad: 5 out of 5The seaweed salad had a nice balance of crisp, fresh-tasting seaweed, light dressing, a sparing amount of white sesame seeds; and sat atop a bed of skinless cucumber spears. It arrived very cold (even in 80 degree weather) and was refreshing to eat. In terms of portion-size, it filled the better part of your standard small square plastic salad container.

No matter the time of the year, I would get cravings more that vinegared rice with that Omega-3 rich piece of raw fish on top. Sometimes, I'd get cravings for that perfectly plump tamago or the grainy sweetness of smelt roe or the perfect crunch of milky squid or that sweet, rich smoky eel sauce. So more often than not, when I pass by Sumo Sushi on my way home, especially on days that I've worked really hard and really late. I stop in and give myself a treat. I have been dining here since they first open and I have to say there's a obvious drop in quality of their sushi and their service. I mean, it's not like it's horrible now, but the skill of their owner/chef is obviously better than their sous chef who helps prepare sushi as well. I remember being wowed at the owner/chef's knife skills from a piece of Ika, but now the sous chef plop the Ika right on the rice without so much of a cut. Service is really a bit odd. The new hire speaks with a very strangely flirty voice while I was on my iPhone playing the almighty Candy Crush while waiting for my food, the waitress came over asking me how long I was playing and how far along I am, and while I reluctantly told her that I just started, she laughed and told me that her husband is already in the hundreds. She then left and told the other waitress about my game progress. It's not something I enjoy especially after a long hard day at work or any day actually.If you enjoy raw fish as much as I do, you'll do well ordering the sashimi appetizers first. It's 8 large piece of fish for $10, which round out to $1.25 per piece. A regular order of sashimi is about $4 for 2 pieces. The fish is mostly fresh and their selection is great. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to sushi and not a big fan of their Americanized rolls with the different spicy sauces or mayo and all those things but if you are and I don't know you, I won't judge.It's usually easy to find a table, I never really seen it being fully packed.

I'm not sure which one I enjoyed more, as they were both solid sushi, well-prepared and flavorful. We ended our meal with the Tempura Ice Cream (Green Tea and Vanilla in a Tempura crust).

They had pretty different types of rolls with lime or crunchy pearls, many types of wraps besides seaweed. Thought they had some really cool ones going that were much cheaper than other special places like this. Our rainbow roll came with a very generous amount of fish, we got a delicious pyramid shaped roll, their special of the day that had pulled crab, tempura, and eel on top was so tasty.

Be warned, their crunchy is not your typical crumbled tempura batter, but it's more like small rice things. My boyfriend wasn't a fan, but I loved the texture of it. A nice break from the fish texture. Like eating Rice Krispies on sushi, but you know, it's not cereal. We also got ice cream for dessert which was vanilla, green tea, and red bean.

The Naruto roll had great fish--it tasted fresh. The ratio of cucumber to fish was a little high for my taste.I've had cucumber wrapped rolls before and here, the cucumber definitely masked the freshness of the fish, which was disappointing.

With my craving amped up to 11 I hit the trusty Yelp app which led me to Kai and a decent surprise.Kai is located in one of those locations that I've been unable to figure out throughout the years, That has taken on a hard to count number of Asian inspired restaurants despite being just a couple blocks away from Chinatown and the many similar and oftentimes better options that lie within. Its also a weird location for any restaurant in general given that its within close proximity to a McDonald's, parking garage, church, and all the random Market Street shops that don't exactly point you towards the direction of grabbing Japanese cuisine. But out of the many spots that I've seen come and go at this location, Kai could be the one with the most staying power due to its eclectic sushi menu and well rounded selection of other options.Since its been so long since I've had sushi at that point I was craving ALL THE FISH! So I was especially drawn to the Dragon Roll that combined spicy tune with shrimp tempura, eel sauce, jalepeno, and spicy mayo; and the Tiger Roll that touted spicy salmon and shrimp with masago, avocado, and cucumber. And while the Tiger did have a bit of a weird presentation, both packed some serious flavors that left me intrigued. Had I have known that that their was a Yelp Deal for a free edamame appetizer with a purchase sooner, I wouldn't have paid for mine (D'oh to bad timing!). But it still delivered the salty soy flavor that you'd expect to come with it.While you won't find better sushi options in Chinatown, you will still find them within a somewhat close proximity to Kai. But with the inventive special rolls, good lunch deals, and other not so fishy offerings; its still a good spot to dine or do take out at on a casual afternoon."], ["Allison B.", "Four stars? You've gotta be kidding.While the interior of Kai is bright and clean, and the service was swell, the sushi was, well, sad.My yellowtail roll was fishy (!), my seared tuna roll was smoky (?), Zack's pork belly app was not actually pork belly (it was just...pork?), the veggie dumplings were soft and wet with flecks of red bell pepper (?) and the worst part of all- too much mushy, unseasoned rice on all rolls.I would not recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys high quality Japanese food."], ["Liz H.", "Awesome place! As soon as I walked in, I started to like this place. It was my groupon purchase try, but I think Im def coming back more often. Sushi is fresh and delicious but my favorite part was their takoyaki and nabeyaki udon. The closest tasted to original Japanese food. The staff is extraordinarily polite, they use some kind of phone? To put in your order so it comes out super fast too! If youre a doubtful person, buy groupon and give it a try!"], ["Katiey C.", "Tried this place out with my boyfriend this evening and definitely felt like it needed to be reviewed.I give them an A-plus for their decor and for making you feel like you're really in a Japanese restaurant while even playing some J-pop. Kudos. Their food, however, needs some work.Given it was the Monday after the Papal visit and they were closed all weekend, I don't blame them for having their fish frozen in that duration. But, then again, shouldn't they have ordered fresh fish to have been delivered this morning? Just a thought. We started off with the agedashi tofu, one of our favorite dishes, and it was beyond despicable. The tofu was on a separate plate from the sauce.... what.... I don't understand? Why call it agedashi tofu if you're not even going to prepare it like agedashi tofu! It was just fried tofu with a side of dipping sauce! Ugh, still makes me angry just typing about it. After receiving the dish, we had to soak each individual tofu piece in the sauce for about 2 minutes each just to eat it without it being horribly dry!I got their sushi platter which comes with a roll of my choice and 8 pieces of chefs choice nigiri as well as complimentary salad and miso soup ($20, awesome deal). Their tuna was completely tasteless and was just all around awful. I've had terrible tuna in the city and this was by far the worst. Tuna is almost always a miss so I can't say I had high expectations for it. Not only was the tuna bad, the yellow tail and shrimp were just as tasteless and also rubbery. Their salmon, however, had been frozen for way too long which caused it to be dense and chewy. Disappointing! Also, this isn't really a big issue, but for the roll of my choice, I chose the spicy tuna maki and assumed it would just be spicy tuna. They, instead, gave me cucumber and spicy tuna? Could be worse, but unexpected and not what I wanted.My boyfriend got the chirashi, which is probably the best deal they have. The rice was properly seasoned and had a great variety of fish for him to eat. No complaints there. Besides the fish which I've already explained above.Overall, they could order better fish and focus on the freshness and maybe they'll have more customers coming in and out. [My boyfriend and I have walked by many times before to take a peek and it is ALWAYS and CONSISTENTLY dead] Sorry, but that's the harsh truth.To end on a good note and why I decided to give them 3 stars instead of 1 was because their presentation was exceedingly wonderful. The way they made the chirashi and their ability to make proper nigiri (so the fish isn't falling off the rice) made the experience a bit better.Probably won't be back again."], ["AJ A.", "Uhhhh.. okay so let me start that the place looks great and customer service was A+ but the sushi needs to have better quality fish.. I'll leave this as my initial review because I will give this restau another chance, looks like they have potential. Menu has a lot of offerings btw"], ["Jessica R.", "The place is clean with a pleasant decor, the staff is polite and attentive. We had the squid and the fried calamari for starters, \u00a0which was very good (my favorites). The volcano sushi rolls were very well prepared and had great flavor. We also had the yellow curry dish with rice and it was delicious as well. I would definitely go back amd eat here again."], ["Nadia T.", "This spot used to be Tea Talk 2, which was pretty dead (that could be an understatement). Now it's Kai Japanese Cuisine, a huge upgrade!I've been anticipating their opening for almost 2 months now, and Kai was well worth the wait. This place is small, not unexpected though for the location. But small as in there's a sushi bar and all the tables only seat 2 except for one that seats 4. I guess it's good for dates. We started off with the salmon tartare ($8). It was definitely worth more than the usual $5 for what, 2 pieces of sashimi? It was a pretty sizable pile of raw salmon on thinly sliced cucumbers topped with avocado pieces, scallions, and ponzu sauce. Definitely get it. There's also a tuna tartare option. We went with the White Tiger and Spider rolls. Each roll was 8 pieces, $10 each which I think is a good price for special rolls. The spider roll is pretty standard: soft shell crab, cucumber, etc. The White Tiger contained spicy tuna, cucumber, masago, and was topped with a generous amount of white tuna. Super tasty. I ordered a chicken katsu bowl ($12) for my little brother. When it came out, they didn't bring any miso soup or salad like the menu said it comes with. But it was whatever, I wouldn't have had room for it anyway (brother didn't even finish this dish so I gratefully ate it). The chicken was perfectly crispy and delicious!Surprisingly, only an appetizer, 2 rolls, and a chicken katsu was enough to fill us! Everything was extremely fresh and tasty! The menu isn't as extensive as most sushi places, but I don't mind that really.The service is good, although it's nothing particularly exceptional or memorable. This week they're doing a grand opening special: 25% off your entire meal! My friend and I only had to pay $20 each, including tips! I've been looking for a sushi spot in Philly and I think I've found it!"], ["Khanh V.", "I came here during the grand opening weekend and did take out. I ordered grilled squid and okonomiyaki. (I just love squid and seafood in general).. The food tasted fresh and was flavored well. The grilled squid was tender and juicy. Waiting for my order, I checked out the interior design felt in love. It is simple, clean with modern touch and a hint of Asia. Too bad the space is small or else it would be even better. This location used to be Tea Talk 2. I am glad something else opened up here. Overall, a good experience and would like to come back to dine and try other food on the menu."], ["Lisa Z.", "Considering that I was in Philadelphia for a few days, this was one of the spots I decided to have dinner at with people. The restaurant itself I hear is new and they even offered a \"grand opening discount\" to your check. I had no clue what I was in for, but I came here with four other members of my family preparing for what was ahead of us. Well boy oh boy, Kai Japanese Cuisine definitely left a positive impression on me. First of all, have you seen the furniture in this restaurant? Dang, the chair sure was heavy... but if you take notice of the design and its interior, it's fabulous! I looked passed the weight of it for its fine comfortable seat. Fasting forward to several months later, this is my second time here (considering that i am from New york). I love the concept of being able to see the sushi chefs make my sushi and how my fish is prepared. Their sashimi has yet to come out not fresh -- it's always fresh. I haven't received anything that isn't good. Here are some of the dishes that i would recommend for people to order, only because I can vouch for it : Unagi don, eel and cucumber roll, pork belly w/wasabi and soy sauce, and a salmon skin handroll. PS their salmon skin handroll is probably the most unique and strangest handroll i have ever tried. The wise one would always mention \"quality over quantity,\" and honestly, it's true about this restaurant. They not only have nice chairs, you should see the teapots they use to serve tea. On top of that, the chopsticks aren't the disposable ones. It may be a little pricey, but i'd suggest to give this place a try. Must I mention their B.Y.O.B. policy with no cork fee?"]], "Vic Sushi Bar": [["Jenny G.", "You cannot go wrong with this place when you're craving sushi..or not! The ambience is very intimate, and it's a wonderful experience to sit at the bar while your rolls are prepared by deft hands.They have a 3 basic roll deal that can't be beat. We've tried different specialty rolls each time and liked them all. Wouldn't recommend the miso soup though, the broth is flavorless, and it could definitely use some more nori and tofu.Don't forget to bring your wine along since this is a BYO!!"], ["Avelina A.", "I really like this place because it's extremely unassuming! The restaurant is a tad small and I believe that the majority of their orders are take-out lunch, but if you're looking for a cozy place for lunch, I would recommend coming here-early! They have a 3 roll special ($10.95) that is not only for lunch, but can be ordered at any time of the day, which is unique from other sushi joints. Their ingredients are fresh and delicious!My only complaint is the use of disposable dining ware. Call me a hippie, but I appreciate when businesses are conscientious of their carbon footprint. But to fair, I'm not sure if they have the dishing capacity in their tiny little spot! Anyways, with a try! Give it a go!"], ["Tara E.", "Two words- delicious sushi!

The 3 roll special for 10.95 comes with 24 pieces and is both filling and delicious. Last time I asked for fluke and avocado instead of the salmon for the alaska roll, and they were more than happy to accommodate.Two must try items on their menu: 1) the tuna dumplings (they can be pricey but worth trying at least once!) and 2) the sansom special roll."], ["Natalie K.", "YUM! Just finished take out from Vic Sushi. I've had the opportunity to dine in and take out and I recommend skipping dining in if you have the opportunity. The space is really tight with seating for 10 at most and you can't really see them making the sushi the way it's setup. Seating is first come, first serve, with a relatively quick turnaround of guests. The space is clean and they are pretty friendly with how busy they can get between take out and dining in (some times a little overwhelming to witness). The take out option is just as good quality and you can eat your (soon to be) favorite sushi roll in the comfort of your own home, free of judgment when you end up covered in sauce because you can't handle chopsticks (this may or may not have just happened to me). If you are here for the first time you HAVE to get the tuna dumplings. Promise me. I tell everyone I can about them. I make people go to dinner here with me just for them. I some times dream about them (OK, an exaggeration but you get the point). They are on the pricey side, but if you're eating with someone, it's worth splitting the cost (2 about the size of my palm to an order for $10). They make the dumpling \"skin\" (is there an actual term for this that I am unaware of?) out of sushi grade tuna and fill it with the most delicious of avocado salads. Then they drizzle it with Sriracha mayo and eel sauce (salty and tangy) to top it all off. \u00a0My favorite roll is the Sansom roll. It's a seemingly standard tempura shrimp roll on the inside, but on the outside it's topped with salmon, tuna, masago, scallions, and avocado and then drizzled with Sriracha mayo and eel sauce (I see you're picking up on a theme here). I've also tried the Holiday roll, which is a nice alternative if you don't like the typical seaweed roll. But I usually order the same roll every time I go here - it's that good.If you're craving sushi, I suggest this place! It's my favorite sushi place in Philly and any time anyone asks for a sushi recommendation I tell them to go here!"], ["Christine V.", "Three rolls for $11. That is all. Okay but really, you seriously cannot pass up a place that sells three rolls for $11. Granted there are a few other places that sell these special deals, but Vic delivers A+ quality and quantity for the prices they offer. The restaurant is very small, offering mostly only bar seating and one table that seats around four to six people. It's definitely more of a take-out/grab-n-go type of place. If you're considering dining in, it is a BYO! Their three roll specials is probably one of the best in the area. A lot of rolls to choose from that fits that special, and sushi chefs don't skimp out on the quantity. My favorites include the spicy salmon and the spicy tuna amongst these rolls. Their special rolls are also great - definitely filling and their menu will have something for everyone. This isn't a fancy sushi restaurant so don't expect the freshest fish. But for what you're paying and for the amount you're getting, Vic is a great place to come to. Note: tuna dumplings are apparently a must-try here. I came here with my boyfriend, and the people sitting next to us made us promise that we order that next time we come in! Looks yummy!"], ["Mallory S.", "Vic Sushi Bar is the perfect hole in the wall no fuss sushi restaurant. There's barely seating for 6 people, most people do take out. BYOB is always a plus.

TIP: Get the tuna dumplings!"], ["Shereen C.", "Disappointed by my last visit to Vic Sushi, which was definitely not as good.The maki rolls were not well-formed. Special rolls were smaller. There was very little eel in the Yellow Dragon roll. The Black Dragon had a bit more eel, but he roll was malformed, perhaps because it wasn't filled properly (almost like it had been rolled with too much empty space inside, and then collapsed).Service was not good. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff the whole time we were there. \u00a0There were also problems with payment. First, it was difficult to get her to give me the itemized receipt. When I finally got it, there was a mistake on it -- they had overcharged. I can't say whether it was a genuine mistake, but when you overcharge customers and make it difficult for them to see the discrepancy, that's definitely a service problem (at least)."], ["Sarah S.", "I ordered 3 rolls for $11. \u00a0Great deal! \u00a0i don't know just from those 3 rolls I could tell how great this place is but its super convenient for me, a quick stopover on my home from work when I'm in the mood for sushi."], ["Gia M.", "Jared J and I had some time to kill before going to a comedy show and decided to have a platter.

Every single part of my experience here was wonderful, from the ambiance to the food to the entire establishment. Firstly, Vic's is a hole-in-the wall sushi joint with only 8-10 seats. I came here around 2 PM with a friend and brought a bottle of wine. We sat down, hassle-free, \u00a0at the (only) table, picked up a menu from the bar, and started searching for what sounded good. Meanwhile, we were sipping our wine and water, slowly working at the entire bottle. We ended up picking 3 specialty rolls and an order of tuna dumplings. The tuna dumplings came out quickly, and it was my first time having them but I'd heard so many great things--my expectations were not disappointed. Yes, it's very pricey ($5 per dumpling!), but the delicious combination of tempura flakes, avocado, and tuna wrapping is completely worth it.Our sushi order came out quickly, set in beautiful formation. I especially liked the spicy combo roll, as it had the most ratio of fish in the roll. The other two (Sansom Roll and Lucky Roll) were also delicious, but I think I was craving pure fish rather than avocado after those tuna dumplings!Overall, a perfect experience. Bring a date or a friend (just one!), a bottle of wine, and prepared to be transported to Japan."], ["Jared J.", "All good ol' uncle Vic.So I decided to host a sushi party and I hit up Vic Sushi Bar for a large order. Something along the lines of spicy salmon, spicy tuna, Alaska roll, California roll, futomaki, yellowtail role, and eel role with a couple of sides of seaweed salad.Kudos for them to getting the order together. However big the order, the sushi crafts were lack luster. Many rolls fell apart when my guests were eating them. Also, many roles that we had were misshaped, contained ingredients which they are not supposed to be made of, and utterly smashed in to go containers. Yes the sushi was tasty, no it was not supreme. Finally, they forgot to give me any chopsticks. We made due, yet that was still a fatal error of the sushi bar. PROTIP: They do not accept american express."], ["Marie S.", "I hate to be such a sushi stickler, but yet again I'm failing to understand why sushi restaurants serving overpriced, low quality fish can get such high ratings.Tuna dumplingsA tuna dumpling is essentially a flattened piece of tuna stuffed with a premixed avocado filling. My problem with this appetizer is when you flatten tuna, a usually firm fish, you end up with a mushy product. The avocado is very soft, leading to a dish that is mushy on mushy. This is not a good deal at $5/dumpling.White dragon rollThis is a basic roll topped with white tuna and drizzled with thick soy sauce. Having worked at a sushi restaurant before, I can assure you that dragon rolls should be topped with eel sauce. The white tuna did not have a firm bite nor the usual oily feel. The temperature was uneven - room temperature fish topping, but cold roll underneath.I am being really picky in my review because I left hungry despite paying $17 after tax and tip for lunch. For this price, I would expect Vic to deliver on either quantity or quality. I will not be coming back and I definitely would not recommend Vic to anyone."], ["Danita R.", "I FINALLY made it and oh was it well worth the wait.

You should just get that because you can and then add whatever else you want to it.

I personally got the Alaskan, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna roll being a salmon and tuna lover.For specialty rolls, I highly recommend the Sansom roll - it will not disappoint! It's popping with a fusion of sweet, savory, and refreshing all in one bite!

We were in time for the lunch special, which meant $4 normal rolls; my friend and I both got two rolls each, and I ordered a specialty roll for $12 on top of that. For a place that is known for its decorations, I was disappointed that saving money on lunch specials meant no fancy plate decorations. I've been here for dinner before, and you definitely pay for the sushi plate to be pretty! All three of my rolls were subpar, and was especially not impressed with my specialty roll.

Whenever I get sushi no matter where it is I typically will order a spicy salmon or tuna roll and I was very pleased with Crazy Sushi's version. The Ichiban roll was one of their \u00a0house specials and had a really cool presentation.

Stopped by here after visiting the museum nearby and craving sushi!We ordered shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, and some sushi rolls that I don't remember the names for. The tempura was okay, crispy and fresh by oily compared to NYC standards.I didn't like the salad that accompanied it because the finger dressing was too thick and chunky and desperately needed to be watered down and added with mayo. The sushi rice was well seasoned and fresh. The fish was questionable and atmosphere was unimpressive. It was Chinese owned and run, which I find to be a bore when it comes to authenticity, but our waiter was super kind and made small talk with us and made us laugh and smile.

The atmosphere was a little off for my personal taste - too quiet but still a great setting nonetheless. It's super tiny though, so big groups- stay away."], ["Mike K.", "Great sushi spot. Friendly staff, decent prices, delicious food. Went on a Sunday afternoon and it was a quiet and calm environment (not many customers at the time).

When you start seeing fish or seafood that has been mulched into tiny pieces or turned into goo, it cannot be called sushi. \u00a0I also got sick here. :-(Location and Ambiance:Location is great, but the ambiance is okay. \u00a0There is a staleness about the place that is seems more fresh than their sushi, sadly.Service:Great, attentive service."], ["Hiya R.", "Always the most innovative rolls, a must try for sushi fanatics.

Only drawbacks were that one of us didn't get the miso soup he'd ordered, and it seems to be a haven for large groups of underage, overdressed, screaming girls.

It wasn't greasy, which is a common complaint that I have about tempura- so this was a great surprise!The ONE bad thing is that the appetizer (tempura) came out about 5 minutes before the main meal, which is always awkward. I won't hold it against them though, because the sushi was great.The presentation was beautiful! There were the cutest little plastic trees on the plates! I had the white tuna roll (fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but it's just a plain roll), and the magic salmon roll. It was seriously the best sushi roll I have ever had in my life.

I've lived down the block for a few weeks now, but visited Crazy Sushi even when I was living up in UC.To start off, the food is good. The rolls are priced fairly, and the veggie gyoza compares to the best of the same that I've had in Cali (full disclosure: I think Cali has the best Japanese food in the country). The plates are beautifully decorated, and I think the decor inside the place, bar the color changing effects, are absolutely beautiful (I'm a fan of contemporary design). In particular, the sweet potato roll and the cucumber+avocado roll are my favorites, although I'm looking forward to trying the mango one soon too.In any case, I really want to like the place, but the constant finding of hairs (not ours) in the food during our two visits and the subsequent 'not-caring' of the wait staff has been somewhat disappointing. Further, the lack of attention to detail - not bringing over new soy sauce containers when the other one is empty, not refilling water, etc. is disappointing as well, and in all, costs Crazy Sushi 2 stars.With that being said, the food is still good, but if they just wore hair nets or whatnot and kept things more hygienic, and improved service a tad bit, that would definitely go a long way!"], ["Ashley O.", "This is my favorite sushi place in Philadelphia.

I tried the spicy tuna roll, it had some crunch to it, I liked it."], ["Megan L.", "I ordered delivery from here and it was weird. I got the chirashi and it was really good but the miso soup tasted like feet and the soft shell crab appetizer was the worst thing ever. It had wayyyy too much batter, 3 times thicker than the batter on a corndog and the crab also tasted so old and bad and I had to spit it out. I couldn't even swallow it."], ["Morgan C.", "My go-to place for delivery sushi when I'm on campus. I have ordered from Sakura on Eat24 many times, and they never disappoint! Everything I've ordered is always delicious, and it comes very quick!"], ["Lauren C.", "Love it here! Tea is delicious and a variety of rolls are available at affordable prices. I've never had one I don't like.The eel avocado is my go to. Mexican roll was almost as good as a taco!!"], ["Brett R.", "After having just started working on Spring Garden Street, I had to go out to explore to find where I could get my favorite lunchtime indulgence: SUSHI. This place is directly across from one of the largest office complexes in the city and offers a great lunch special deal: 2 rolls, a salad and Miso soup for under $9.00! Wow! So far, I've had California rolls, Philadelphia rolls (duh), tuna avocado and spicy tuna. All have been great, and they haven't been wrapped in excessive amounts of rice. The fish is tender and flavorful, and I ALWAYS get more than enough ginger and wasabi, which is a must for me. The staff is pleasant and efficient and have delivered the lunch orders for the entire office across the street multiple times. Definitely plan on going back many more times. It's sushi, and it's good - what's not to like?!"], ["Megan R.", "The rolls were the highlight of my experience, but even those were subpar. Today I ordered three rolls for delivery, and one of the rolls wasn't what I ordered. I'm not one to complain, but I called the restaurant to ask them to deliver the correct one in their own time, and they told me that I would have to give the incorrect roll back to the driver... These rolls were all smushed together in a small box that I had already started eating out of, and I asked several times for clarification - How do I give it back? Is this sanitary? Are you going to sell this to someone else? And the driver replied that it was \"the manager's business\" and that she just needed it back. Having worked in the restaurant service industry for 4 years, especially working with resolving individual customer issues, I think this was completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Since they insisted multiple times, I put the roll in a plastic bag, because that was all I had. I really hope it wasn't rearranged and served to another customer."], ["Elise M.", "I have ordered delivery from Sakura a few times. It is not horrible, but is not that good.The most disappointing item I have ordered is the vegetable tempura. I don't think that their tempura could even be classified as tempura! Tempura batter is supposed to be light and flaky. But this tempura had a heavy, thick coat that was really gross. I did like the gyoza I ordered once though.I don't think I will be ordering delivery from Sakura much in the future. I may occasionally order though because I sometimes need to break out of my usual places to order-in from."], ["Toni M.", "DO NOT eat here if you don't want your debit card charged freely. They charged me twice and when I tried to dispute with my bank, they have receipts showing that I signed for both when I only signed for one receipt! I will never eat here again - it's not like their food is one of the best of Philly."], ["Collin B.", "Fresh and friendly. I get sunshine roll (sweet shrimp) and hamachi (yellowtail) consistently and its super fresh and flavorful."], ["Justin Z.", "We had a couple rolls, 1 bento box and chirashi plate. The rolls were fresh and very tasty. The teriyaki bento box was plain, there was no real flavor on the chicken. I may have received a grilled chicken bento box instead of what I ordered. The chicken still tasted pretty good though. The chirashi tasted fresh but I still suggest sticking with the rolls at this restaurant. The restaurant is small but had really good service."], ["Anthony S.", "I used to live at 12th and spring garden, which is right by this place. It's great if you're in the area and want some decent sushi, but it's not worth traveling across town for. As I said, the sushi is just decent. They have the standard rolls available anywhere and a couple specialty rolls. There was one time I ordered through grubhub, and they gave me sashimi instead of sushi, which was annoying because it's the same price but is actually like half the amount of food. It was like two pieces, as compared to a roll which usually has five or six. Now when I'm in that part of Philly and decide to stop in! I usually get the udon noodles, which is better than their sushi."], ["Joanna D.", "Paid 20 bucks for pretty lousy sushi. Didn't come with accompaniment I asked for and was pretty bland. Would have been better off ordering from Kansai."], ["Racheal C.", "I'm in love with the tempura here. Perfect fresh food is the definition of this place. Service was great. Prices were not to shabby. We will definitely be getting takeout from here one day."], ["Kimberly S.", "really really great sushi at really great prices. The place is a BYO and the takeout is quick. Try the sushi pizza - it's amazing!"], ["Hannah J.", "Had the eel and cucumber role and ikura sushi. \u00a0The food was made fresh and the hot green tea was delicious!"], ["Dan S.", "Sakura serves some typical Japanese fare, including a variety of sushi, noodle soups, and stir fried noodles. \u00a0They have a ton of sushi options, which are good. \u00a0None of them really wow me but if you're going out for a nicely priced lunch I'd say go for it. \u00a0I'd certainly recommend the udon noodles over their sushi, as their nicely stir fried and come in three options: vegetables, chicken, or shrimp."], ["Krissi S.", "Great for the price and convenience. It's nothing fantastic but my picky 7 year old and my boyfriend loved it. I got the avocado & cucumber rolls (once had better...but they were good) and my boyfriend enjoyed his California rolls. The seaweed salad wasn't bad either. I've finally found somewhere that would deliver to me in Port Richmond though! Lets hope they will still deliver after having discovered how \"far\" it is (supposedly NOT outside of their delivery zone though from other reviews I saw elsewhere)."], ["Susanna L.", "Not the best sushi I ever had, but i I was in the area I'd be ok to come a bite here. I had the christmas roll, spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll. The prices are a little more than what I usually see, but this is close to the city so the taxes must be high. I really liked the christmas roll, there was a good amount of fish wrapped on the outside and the avocado was pretty fresh. The fish however is just ok, I've had better. I didn't like the shrimp tempura roll though, it was drenched in I guess soysauce and isn't what I am used to eating. The pieces are big though i you are looking for something filling. The spicy tuna had nothing special. The fish is just ok quality. Overall meal was not bad, if you are around the area and want sushi, go or it."]], "Dasiwa": []}
