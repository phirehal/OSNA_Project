{"Zesty's": [["Michael H.", "Came to this restaurant after peeking at the menu online while looking for good dining in Manayunk. First off, the name Zesty's reminds me of some cheap wing bar. When you walk into this place, it's a mess. The decor is cheesy, unwelcoming. The restaurant seemed confused. However, the food was decent. My girlfriend is Greek, growing up in a family who owned a critically successful restaurant in Greek town of Baltimore. My expectations are somewhat lofty. We have both had a lot of great Greek food. Zesty's was good. The octopus was cooked and seasoned well. The hummus was great. My girlfriend ordered the crab cakes, which were solid but not spectacular. I enjoyed th Arni Souvlaki. Rice was just what I expected and the lamb was juicy and flavorful. Our server came off as pretentious and rude when my girlfriend tried to relate by telling him she was Greek. The food also took forever, and we were one of three tables in the entire restaurant. Not sure if I'll be back. Even though the food was decent."], ["Laura B.", "$5 sangria Saturday (huge, delicious sangia), and the best calamari I've ever eaten. \u00a0Cute church pews for booths. \u00a0Definitely good."], ["Dave H.", "Zesty's[1] is bigger than a breadbox.A bar dominates the left dining area, which is surrounded by booths and light tables.

The place is well-lit (a plus, for me), and windows provide an expansive view of Main Street Manayunk, perfect for staring out in an angsty manner.Last I was here, I co-hosted a happy hour, and didn't run into any issues. Bartender Sophia served our crew with a smile, getting us appetizers (try the mussels), shots (Jameson, of course), and drinks (heard their vodka and Red Bull was potent). Runners moved food from the kitchen to customers with nary a delay.Thanks to owner Tom for his hospitality![1] Supposedly Munk & Nunn now - half the place is church-themed in a non-kitschy way - but Zesty's web site still exists, as does their signage from the street.

Besides the Greek salad that I always get, the rest of the menu is great. \u00a0A few good vegetarian options and a ton of fish. \u00a0The decor is horrible. \u00a0It's like they can't decide what they want to be.

They are very disorganized. Our waitress was nice but very slow and could not multitask well, which is important as a server. They were out of several bottles of wine we were interested in and didn't actually get drinks until being there for 45 minutes!! Then the food took forever even though the place was empty.

The bartender CANNOT be friendlier if he tried.. truly, probably the friendliest bartender we've ever had in Philly.Decor is cool, runway lights on the ceiling.. and a classy bar. You're thinking typical Greek Sandwiches. No, this food is Authentic. I highly recommend sticking to the Greek, and order many plates.. you won't regret. The quality is A+.

We began with the hummus, which was as good as others have stated. For the main course I went with the Chicken Lefkadas, which is chicken breast stuffed with fresh spinach & feta cheese, served on top of mashed potatoes and green beans, with mushroom cream sauce. Amazingly tasty. My guest had the Liga Apo Olla, which while filling was a bit less inspiring.For dessert we tried the baklava cheesecake, which was good, but I would have preferred straight baklava, as cheesecake to me is a bit tired.The atmosphere/decor was quite inviting, with inventive use of lighting, including colored lights of the ceiling. Our server Sophie returned often to refill our glasses. I don't understand all the losers here complaining about it being overpriced - one joked about going to Burger King instead - maybe that tells you something. (FYI the nearest Burger King is on Chelten Avenue in Germantown.)Final note - there are two bars here, making it a fine place to imbibe your favorite libation in style. I had not seen it since the renovation but I am sure I will return soon."], ["Lia L.", "We eat out very frequently and this was by far one of the worst experiences We have EVER had. I ordered a special grilled shrimp salad and when it came out it was completely rancid. Nice, serve a pregnant girl bad shrimp. When the waitress sent it back to the kitchen, she said the kitchen agreed it was bad and that it was \"the dressing\". Since when do you use dressing that smells like bad shrimp? So I ordered an appetizer instead. It took 45 minutes for my appetizer to come out. Obviously everybody was long done with their meal. The worst part was when we got the bill, they overcharged us for the app! We asked to speak to the owner who came to the table to introduce himself at the beginning of the meal, but he refused to come out!!! Can you even?!?Also our waitress never refilled our water a single time. Why I don't like to say all bad things, everybody else enjoyed their entree once the smell of bad shrimp dissipated from the table. Also after we complained about the overcharge for the app, the waitress removed the item from our bill altogether (why was this not done immediately or at least a dessert sent out after the terrible meal/experience??)Overall, weird decor, weird smell, bad service, very very very overpriced too. Not sure how this place survives with all the competition and the way they do business. I would never recommend anybody go here!"], ["Tabitha S.", "The level of service at this restaurant makes it abundantly clear why there were only 3 tables of diners on a Friday night. Actually, using the word \"service\" for what we experienced is a stretch. This restaurant doesn't have a wine list. They have a clunky plastic clad iPad that you have to pass around. The waitress had zero knowledge of said clunky wine list. When one of my dining companions asked for a dry Greek red, she had to go ask the bartender. When she brought the wine however, she didn't even bother to inform us what wine she brought. In addition, she shattered a wine glass across our table. I had glass on my plate and on my lap. No apology. She even tried to minimize the situation by saying, 'oh well, you only have one piece of glass in your lap'. For future reference - the only acceptable number of glass shards in my lap is ZERO. The entrees came out extremely staggered. Three came out, then about 4 minutes later, three more. Mine came out about 15 minutes later after all of the other people had finished their meals. I would have canceled my entree at that point, if I could have found our waitress. No apologies for the appalling service were made. No manager ever came to our table. Nothing was comped. The decor is hideous. They have massive fish in these tiny little tanks. It is sad. The place looks cheap, but the food is so expensive. The real shame is that the food was actually good. The char grilled octopus was amazing. The hummus was great - smooth, creamy, flavorful. No one at our table had any complaints about the food. But after that horrid service, I will never eat there again. And you shouldn't either."], ["Nadia B.", "I went to the restaurant on a Saturday night and now I know why they were only 3 tables in the whole place. The service sucks more than a vacuum!! SLOW.

Therefore, I would like to express my sincerest apologies to my palate for this unnecessary deprivation of deliciousness. We decided to stop into Zesty's at around 7pm on a Friday night, after visiting a few neighboring establishments for pre-dinner drinks. In fact, the plan was for Zesty's to be but another of our one-drink stops on the way to have dinner someplace else. It was the warm, inviting environment that caused us to stay and finish our night here with dinner. The space is actually pretty beautiful, and boasts a kind of religious theme. There are large posters of interior shots from St. John's (the huge cathedral-esque church in Manayunk), and the booths actually look like real wooden church pews. This accompanied a rustic aesthetic, with hints of modernity, all in a dim lighting. It's really the sort of place where you want to hang out for a long time. The beer selection was pretty good, and most of the beers on tap were decent imports, along with a couple of local crafts brews and the requisite Miller Lite. I had a Franziskaner (properly served in a hefe weizen glass) and a Palm, which I believe is a Belgian ale. My wife had a simple mixed drink, which was made well. The high point of the experience was actually the food. The menu is fairly extensive, with the highlights being Greek specialties and seafood. I made an uncharacteristic decision and went with the seafood special. The special, which was a little pricey at $32 (but was intended for two people, to be fair), was a whole Dorado fish that weighed about 2lbs. It was spectacular. The fish was charcoal grilled, fileted, and had most of the bones removed. It was in a very subtle buttery sauce that just served to accentuate the flavors of the fish. It was finished with capers and a little too much fresh flat-leaf parsley. I generally don't go this crazy with my orders, in fact spending that much on a dish is kind of anathema to me, but I would totally order this again. Finally, I should note that the staff was exceptionally pleasant, and I really liked everyone we encountered there. You should definitely check this place out."], ["Rick M.", "You have to order the mussels, I think they might be the best I've ever had. \u00a0Also, if you get the chance, since I believe it might have been a special, get the asparagus soup with crab meat. \u00a0It's incredible.The bartenders are awesome, and extremely friendly as well. \u00a0Definitely worth a try on Main Street."], ["Natalie B.", "So, I'm not sure whether to review this place as Zesty's or Munk and Nunn, because the menus, business cards, and discount cards refer to it as both. The website is Munk and Nunn. The signs outside are Zesty's, which really confused my friend and me when we were trying to find Munk and Nunn.The inside is very pretty. The tables look like they have marble tops and the seats are pews. There are pictures of beautiful churches, and fish tanks divide the first room and second room. \u00a0There's a big bar in the middle of the first room, and the ceiling is decorated with small Christmas lights. The bathrooms were clean and had cool faucets.Their beer selection isn't great and our soco and lime shots tasted pretty watered down, but the bartender was really friendly. My friend and I shared some delicious grilled calamari covered in balsamic vinegar.I had an overall good experience and will definitely come back again, but I can't give it four stars. I only tried one thing, and it bothers me that they won't decide on a name. It's unprofessional and confusing to be both.

The huge windows allows for entertainment because you get to people watch which is always amusing. The food is pretty expensive. However, it's really high quality. The mussels are cooked perfectly. They were so tender. The sauce they were cooked in was different from the usually tomatoes type broth I am used too. But, it was nice. The greek salad was made with great quality vegetables and a decent sized portion. The hummus plate was also delicious. I do question how one can charge 10 dollars for some hummus and warm pita. The only negative to the meal was the calamari and the bread basket. It's insanely tough. It was pretty disgusting. Most restaurants that give you the olive oil garlic dipping sauce have warm bread. This wasn't warm at all and was extremely tough hard beard. It wasn't appetizing. We finished the meal off with a baklava cheesecake. The cheesecake itself isn't bad. I had high expectations for a nice combination of baklava with the cheesecake. However, I was disappointed. The phyllo dough wasn't even cooked right so it lacked the flaxy texture of a real baklava. Overall, it was a nice meal with enthusiastic waitress who knew the menu \u00a0fairly well. I also appreciate the fact they market vegetarian dishes on the menu.

Were waiting for more than 45 mins and the restaurant was not even fully occupied yet. By the time we got our food, we just wanted to eat, as we were starving. Guess what NONE of the items ordered had any flavor or spices and was not at all good. The salmon was dry and over cooked and the side couscous an vegetables had no flavor. That was the same case for all 3 salmon orders. The falafel sandwich and the crab and the chicken all had the same problem.I have eaten in many Mediterranean places and this is the worst I have ever tasted. Everyone was disappointed and decided not to go back ever again. I have a basic rule - if a restaurant can not grill salmon that proves something !!!

Usually, before I take them to a restaurant, I like to try it out first. This time, I didn't and I really regret it. First, the appetizer was good. We ordered the Aya's Taster, which included falafel, hummus, baba ganoosh, bruschetta, kalamata olive hummus, and stuffed grape leaves. For the entree, my mother ordered a medium-well cooked kofta meat dish. After waiting almost 30 minutes, she received it burned. When she addressed it to the waitress, she looked at her and said \"sorry, I told them to make it medium well, but they didn't.\" That's it- no \"we are sorry, we'll take it right back.\" The waitress just went around the other tables and completely ignored our table. My mother was forced to eat the burned dish and my father and I ate mediocre salmon dishes. You would think things couldn't get any worse. Wrong. When the check came, the waitress wouldn't honor the coupon I had because we had ordered a special although she said initially that she would. At this point, I'm arguing with her. My mother is upset.

The calamari is fried to perfection, and Aya's did not skimp on the amount of calamari. The veggies were all fresh, and the sesame vinaigrette was light but delicious."], ["Justin S.", "Visited Philadelphia last weekend and got caught up in the wonderment of the stunning architecture which comprises the city. Lost track of time and the fact that we hadn't eaten in close to eight hours. It was around 4:30 PM, we were hungry but picky and refused to settle and let our appetites get the best of us. We ventured past several eateries on our ten-minute trek to Aya's Caf\u00e9, which opened at 5 PM. When we arrived there was one other couple waiting for them to open. When they did finally open we were a party of five and second in a line of four parties total awaiting dinner. Everyone was seated and we were the last to be acknowledged despite the fact that we were the second party to be seated. Our order was as follows:Calamari SaladCaesar Salad with ChickenGreek SaladChicken Kabob DinnerCheeseburger and FriesHungry but patient we basked in the disappointment as plate after plate emerged from the kitchen and was set on every table but our own. The waitress returned to refill our drinks at around the thirty-minute mark but said nothing in regards to the status of our food. It grew increasingly disheartening as two of the other parties had finished dining and the third had already received their bill and was preparing to leave. We remained hungry and patient when at around the fourty-five minute mark the waitress approached our table to ask if we wanted the pita to come out ahead or with the salads. It was at this point that we politely asked if there was a reason for the delay to which the waitress replied curtly, \"We were preparing food for the other tables, we are preparing yours now.\" Not an inkling of compassion or any gesture resembling an apology for the obvious delay. It was at least another ten minutes before our dinner arrived. As much as I would like to believe that good things come to those who wait, in this particular scenario it was more like mediocrity comes to those who wait. The food was average at best and nothing to write home about. I guess I just expected more considering the wait. The entire dinner was anticlimactic. Salad is Salad and hard to ruin given the amount of time they had to prepare it. The chicken Kabobs were not awful but they were a little dry and the Tahina sauce was bland and tasteless. I will forever be left wondering why it took close to an hour to prepare food for a table of five when three of the dishes were salads. I'm also left with the unanswered question as to why we were so blatantly neglected when compared to the other patrons. Could they tell that we were from out of town? Was it due to our large party? Despite the wait and the neglect we remained polite knowing that our discontent would be reflected in our gratuity.

The food and the service were great and I will definitely be returning!"], ["Holly T.", "Aya's is our favorite place for a Middle Eastern lunch. It's a little off the beaten path, but it's very close to the 22nd St trolley station.So far, we've really enjoyed the Aya's sampler platter (bruschetta, hummus, kalamata hummus, falafel, grape leaves, tatziki sauce and baba ghanough), hummus trio (house, kalamata, red pepper & garlic), kofta sandwich, Egyptian gyro, and grilled eggplant entree. I was especially impressed with the tenderness and juiciness of the lamb meat in the gyro. As a bonus, it's always nice to be able to finish our meal with a Turkish coffee. The interior is dark and cozy, and the service has been good in our experience. Aya's is BYOB but we have yet to take advantage of that; we hope to come back for dinner with a bottle sometime.

Gotta love that it's a byob too!"], ["Helene A.", "Yum, yum, yum.... I had the prefix dinner special w/ salmon and it was delicious.

It is metered street parking only, with very little availability of spots because residents of the area also park in the streets. It is not wheelchair accessible. Forget about having a private conversation here because tables are arranged so close to each other that you can clearly hear what the occupants of the next table are talking about. The server who also functions as the hostess greeted us warmly and sat us immediately. The Trio Hummus that we started out with tasted fresh and seasoned just right. It is initially served with only a handful of pita bread, but they will give you more at no additional cost to you if you ask. The Chicken and Beef Dinner Kebobs where tender and juicy. They were not overdone at all. \u00a0All in all, it was a satisfying meal. The only thing I want to bring up is they automatically add on 20% gratuity to your bill. \u00a0I will understand if they do this to a party of 5 or more. But for a party of 2, I feel that is not necessary. It was ok in our case because we had no problem with the service. But if we had a different experience, I would not be giving a 20% tip.

I've seen all types in here, from romantic couples to large groups to parents with children; Aya's clearly attracts crowds of all sorts. The food here has been mostly very good. The khudaar mashwi, a mixture of vegetables with pearled cous cous and tzatziki, is really good. I've gotten it several times. The vegetarian moussaka is alright, but I wasn't blown away. What I REALLY enjoyed was the appetizer- Aya's taster. I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the baba ganoush, kalamata hummus, grape leaves, and falafel. I have NEVER had falafel so good as I did here! I will certainly be back, to get the taster if not anything else. I'd say its a must if you're here. Service is \"no frills\" for sure. I've actually had the same waitress every time I've been here, and my guess is that this is more if a family-run place. All together, I am very satisfied and will be back, probably many times!"], ["Kristin W.", "We were in the neighborhood and decided it was a good time to try Aya's.

The service was a little slow, but I only noticed one woman in the front of the house who was both the hostess and waitress. She was very pleasant and helpful despite being very busy.My BF and I split the hummus as an appetizer, which was pretty good. However, we didn't get enough pita to go along with it. We are on an ongoing mission to find the best hummus in the city and Aya's ranks pretty high. For my entree I had the lamb stew which was awesome and a huge portion. The lamb was very tender and full of flavor. There was also a perfect ratio of rice to stew. I hate getting too little rice! For my BF's entree he got the parmesan chicken, which he loved! There was a hefty portion of chicken on top of a bed of rice. The rice was covered in what was almost a rose sauce. Whatever it was, it was delicious.

The reviews were good, so we went out of our way to try it.When we arrived, the waitress gave us a short menu which was a special valentine's day menu. It was a four course meal (one of the courses was lentil soup, which we routinely make a huge pot of at home for ~$5), altogether $35 per person, tax and tip not included. We mentioned we weren't all THAT hungry and asked if the regular menu was available. She said she would have to go ask the manager, though didn't, and simply just got regular menus. The table next to us did the same thing and the waiter simply gave them menus with no reluctance...all of which suggests they were trying to get us to think it was our only option. Related: when we paid, an 18% gratuity was automatically included, but it was a form receipt, and so there was also a blank tip line below that; if you weren't paying attention, you might end up tipping twice. I've heard of automatically including a gratuity, but usually in groups of six or something; we were only two people.I got the (I think) Mediterranean salad, which wasn't all that bad ($8), it was a reasonable size and had some good ingredients. However, my lady got a kabob chicken plate ($16), which was mainly brown rice. There was a small yogurt sauce, which was actually not bad, but there were eight small pieces of chicken (about 1 breast's worth). Also, once they cooled off, it was easy to tell that the chicken was frozen, not fresh, and it was hard. There were two pieces of onion which had been burned literally to a char at the ends - she said it tasted like ash. There were also four pieces of bell pepper, which amounted to about 1/8 of a whole pepper you might find in the store. These were also burned on the sides. The portions were only average as well. We've both had grilled veggies and chicken, and this isn't how it tastes. We hate complaining about the food, but ended up doing so. To be fair, the waitress brought a small bowl of veggies that had been sauteed, and didn't charge us, which was nice. But if that's not an issue, why not just add them in the first place? It was something like three times what had been included originally. So the one star will be for that.The two of us are genuinely confounded as to the other reviews - the portions are average, the atmosphere didn't seem terribly romantic, and the prices seemed high. This is really going to have to be one of my few negative reviews, but really, pick somewhere else."], ["Liz J.", "This was my first time experiencing Aya's. I ordered take-out and got the chicken kebab salad. They forgot the \"zesty Greek dressing\" they promised (I only noticed when I get back to my office unfortunately), and then upon cutting into the chicken pieces I noticed that they were mushy and pink in the middle.

However, I am not a huge fan of massive portions of meat, so I got the greek seafood pasta (I can't think of the actual name).

I haven't been in a few years, but now that i work here, i love exploring the streets. It was a super hot day out... an iced coffee was needed. The place was a bit understaffed for a late lunch crowd. However, the one worker was not phased and hustled well and didn't break a sweat. The place felt and looked more of a neighborhood'ish spot where people would meetup to eat, drink, chat. I don't think it was wise having the front door open on a hot day, with no central air (only a window unit from what i saw). So it wasn't super cool inside, but not uncomfortably hot. I got my iced coffee and first sip smacked me in my face! The flavor was super bold and jarring. I've been getting cold brews most of the summer, so switching to an iced coffee was a shock to my palette.

Every table was taken and the line was almost out the door for a good reason- they know what the f*ck they are doing. In a city with a cafe on every goddamn corner, Cafe Ole is flexing with their coffee and orgasmic breakfast sandwiches. I literally told the attractive woman behind the counter to surprise me with whatever sandwich she felt like making, and made probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in some time. Well played. Only downside was the woman breastfeeding who casually flashed me while making eye contact and smiled. She was not attractive.

I tagged them along one day and it turned out pretty nice time. Nice sunny weather in summer, we were seated outside and grabbed various salads. They had pre made salads displayed and they were all freshly made. Got myself Greek salad and strawberry/ banana smoothie. Smoothie was gigantic so probably most girls would be for their lunch itself. I am not so I had salad as well. Salad was huge too. I actually had left over. Everything was affordable there.

As I entered, the decor was indicative of any sidewalk eatery in this area. The display case of prepared food inhibited my curiosity, but I made my way towards the waitress who suggested that I try the shakshouka. Divine! It's almost like a tomatoey-broth of many different types of vegetables surrounds the poached egg yolks. The creamy egg works in harmony with the broth, as undertones of garlic and aromatic green herbs complement the dish. I haven't had too much Mediterranean food before; nor have I ever heard of shakshouka, but I will have to give in to my now budding appetite for this type of food."], ["Andrea A.", "You all know of those restaurants that just bring you back to a certain time you've always wanted to relive. I've just transcended back to one \u00a0of my favorite times with Cafe Ole. I came here for coffee only, as I planned to bring with some friends later. I'm a good window shopper, so I looked at the menu just for fun. I was stopped dead in my tracks when I saw 'the' item. SHAKSHUKA. What is it? You ask. Let me explain. This is a middle eastern dish where a few eggs are cracked into boiling hot tomato sauce amazingness. The eggs cook in the sauce, you sprinkle with herbs and then it's a Moroccan festival in your mouth. If you haven't had it, you must. The only time I've had it was on a trip to Israel, which was one of those life-changing events that Shakshuka brings me back to. Cafe Ole brought me back and in grateful.Enough about me... This place is adorable. There is upbeat middle eastern music playing low, but high enough to make you get a sway in your hips. The place is decorated with uplifting colors and they serve on yellow interesting plates--- just reminds you that ambiance is everything. The employees are super nice and the place is usually full. Cafe Ole is a small establishment with character- something lacking in the huge corporate monster coffee joints.

I wasn't familiar with where the cream and sugar was since it was my first time here, so I had to find my way around and through the thick line that had formed to get to the cream and sugar, before returning to my seat in the back to eat my breakfast sandwich.

Though I loved the drinks, I was not super impressed by the food. Ordered a chicken and mozzarella sandwich. They heated it up on a panini press, and served it with a salad (cucumbers, tomato, oil and vinegar).

Since I suffer from an affliction known as 'hanger' (anger resulting from hunger), Lady Mary suggested the nearest geographical place to our location, Cafe Ole. We walked into bright room, full of hippies, and free spirits from the continent. Joy. Apparently there is no table service. We arrived at that conclusion after sitting at our table for 10 minutes with no greeting. The sign directing orders to be taken at the counter was either backpacking across eastern Europe, or was never conceived. We waited in line to place food orders as elderly couples caressed each other, and looked longly into each other's eyes. Nothing to whet the old appetite like a long haired Spaniard snogging his 4th wife. Hanger was rapidly setting in, but I couldn't see my way clear to order any food from this establishment, and opted only for a coffee. Lady Mary, being much more gentile, granted Ole the benefit of the doubt, and ordered the lox plate. Tangential Point: Where does the food come from??? I can't see a kitchen, or any room in the building for a kitchen. Perhaps it is prepared in the basement? This tangent doesn't much matter, as there didn't seem to be much cooking going on anyway. Lady Mary's dish was a crudely assembled miss-mash of lettuce, old vegetables, and a spot of salmon. 'Worth every bit of twelve quid.' I remarked sarcastically. Even my good lady was unable to pretend that this plate, and indeed place, was anything other than bollux. Hanger got the better of me that day, but I shall live to fight again...just not here. \u00a0Perhaps Cafe Ole is the scandal in bohemia to which Conan Doyle referred??"], ["Paul V.", "Initially I wasnt happy with this place but now its my favourite.

I recently tried it again, and the food seemed much better than before. The salads are humongous and consistent, but I'm not really a salad person, so I usually go for the chicken gyros. Sometimes the chicken is hot and succulent, and sometimes the chicken is cold and dry. The fries and vegetables stuffed inside the gyro make it pretty delicious (and this is coming from a picky person!). Furthermore, I've had nice lemon roasted potatoes and then overly salty ones. Overall, the portions are pretty large, and the prices are decent.Beyond that, my biggest complaint is with the snail-paced service at Greek Lady. The cashier lines are generally reasonable. But when it comes to food preparation, I often wait at least 10-15 minutes for takeout here, and even longer when I eat in. They usually have a lot of customers (it's much nicer when they have outdoor seating, but otherwise it's pretty packed), but they also have a lot of kitchen help, so I don't understand why it takes so long... especially when the food sometimes comes out cold!

I got a chicken gyro (which I prefer over the lamb). The wrap comes in a pita bread shell as well as fries wrapped in (my favorite part).I was so surprised to see fries in there my first time eating it that I thought it was accidentally mixed in, but I'm glad it's a deliberate addition. This place is great for catering to large groups if you want to mix it up a bit!

Milk shake - flat out delicious; definitely on the pricier side but who cares when you're feeling like crap after a midterm and this is the first thing on your mind! Mint lemonade tea - a recent discovery; after eating all that greasy food, you might as well fill the rest of the pockets of air in your stomach with this refreshing beverage, and it's pre-made so grab it on the go!On another note, I'm a bit sad that they don't offer fresh Greek yogurt!!! Maybe one day they will, and I'll add another star to this review then!Service and ambiance are great too. Food is served on a single platter so not much service is required here.

It's slightly pricier than other potential options, but usually gives you what you expect. The hits: The Salads- Huge portions of lettuce and meat. It'll definitely fill you up. I generally prefer ordering the plain Caeser salad and adding the meats/other vegetables on top of it, I find it cheaper than ordering the Greek Lady Salad outright. Gyros- Hefty gyros filled with fries and great tzatziki sauce. Fairly standard. Great if you're graving their delicious lamb. However, you'll get a bit more food at Chipotle for the same price. The misses:Brunch- Nope nope nope. I keep ending up at Greek Lady for brunch on behalf of others, but each time I find myself wishing I had just made my own. First off, the individual entrees came out at different intervals. Next, portions are fairly small and of low quality. The sausages and pancakes remind me of what I'd get from frozen packets. Also, last time I went my friend ordered a sausage egg and cheese. What he got was a foot long hoagie, egg, cheese and four tiny (think frozen) sausage links. The Sides- The platter is admittingly a hefty amount of food for a cheap price. The gyro can be expected to be good, but most everything else is tasteless. They almost always fail to include gravy with their bland mashed potatoes. Any sort of vegetables you order on the side come out tasting like they were just boiled for a couple minutes.

I ordered chicken with feta cheese, chickpeas, artichoke, and lemon tahini sauce in a black rice bowl (see pics)... SO GOOD! I was somewhat like, \"Will this combo even go well together?\" But credit should go to Agno for their menu item selection, because the bowl was delicious! As was my friend's who had a completely different combo. Seems like any combo will make for a great meal.Also what works is that every item tastes good individually. The chicken was perfect. The chickpeas were not too crunchy and added a great texture to the bowl. The artichoke was very tasty and the tahini sauce tied everything together magically. The black rice is really good and kinda calms down the bold flavors of all the other ingredients. Ohh and it was less than $9.00!Unfortunately, I ordered in so I didn't get to check out the place, BUT I did a driveby the other day (in a non-creepy way!) and the place looks super chic.

It was a dough ball, not a falafal. It was unappetizing to the point that it was left in my bowl afterwards which I rarely do. \u00a02. Portions are very small, I was still hungry later. 3.

But when all is said and done, I still love getting food from here- sometimes even crave it- and I forgive many of their shortcomings. Agno serves the sort of food that I like to make for myself at home- wholesome, nutritious, veggie-heavy, and environmentally-conscious. That said, it's not going to win any flavor awards or convince any carnivores to introduce some more greenery into their diet. It caters to the already health-nut granola types who want something that jives with their food philosophy when they can't cook at home.My go-to is the wrap with falafel, carrots, spicy cauliflower, greens, and lemon tahini sauce. The wrap is a little spongy- a little reminiscent of the Ethiopian injera- which is a texture that I happen to really like. And their falafel should really not be called falafel because it's a far cry from the crispy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside fried balls you can get down the street. With a name like that, they're just setting people up for disappointment. They should be called spiced garbanzo herb balls because it would really make everyone's expectations a little more realistic. Name not-withstanding, I actually kind of like the little bean balls, especially when crumbled in the wrap and doused with lemon tahini sauce.The things that would normally irk me if I wasn't so keen on their food offerings are that they are often out of a food item or two that I want and I have to wait for it, their wraps are sometimes a little stale around the edges which makes them a bit chewy, their chicken is a little dry, and they sometimes skimp on the veggies.

I usually go for the spinach.PROTEIN: I like the baked falafel, I had the lamb meatballs and thought they were a bit dry, the meat is not the standout for me.TOPPINGS: Big fan of the beets, the quinoa tabbouli, cucumber tomato salad, and the artichokes, which they often have as a special. These for me are the best part.SAUCE: I usually go for the tzatziki or lemon tahini, sometimes switch it up with the hummus. Second best part.The pita chips are really great too if you feel like cheating a little!They have limited drink offerings but you can ask for water, which they'll give you in a tiny cup. They take credit card (via ipad thingy) and I usually get my receipt emailed. Seating is casual, some large tables, some spots by the window, and some outdoor seating. It can get pretty crowded around lunch time.RECAP: Overall a solid 3.5 lunch spot, and I know I'll be coming more in the summer. Just wish it was a touch cheaper.

Not sure if they just were sold out of their sodas, or were trying to sell their iced teas.

The thought of the wrap scared me for a second because I had noticed that it was gluten free. I am not gluten intolerant by any means and honestly feel my experiences with gluten free products have been pretty disappointing, but I decided to go with the wrap regardless. The guy helping me did mention that because it's more fragile than most other wraps, to make sure I eat it wrapped up and peel back the paper as needed. Thank goodness he warned me!

Unfortunately, Yelp has led me astray. The people here were extremely friendly, but the service was a bit slow. Regardless, the food was just okay. it was pretty average and generic Middle Eastern. I think there was a vague Tunisian theme going on, which would have been great had they offered anything specifically Tunisian. The Greek salad was overwhelmingly lemony; and if I'm not mistaken, real Greek salad does not generally contain so much lettuce, and is not so stingy with the cucumber. Also, their pita bread is the thin papery kind, and is quite obviously store-bought. Fine, a lot of places don't make their own pita, but they could serve something better than that. I'm not sure why everyone on Yelp so far has said something like, \"OMG the food here is SOOOO cheap!\" It's not really that cheap. I expected the $18 combo platter to be huge, and while it looked pretty huge, there actually wasn't all that much meat on it. Certainly not $18 worth, and the quality of the food didn't make up the difference. The smallish piece of salmon was dry and flavorless, the minuscule kofta link was oddly spiced, too chewy, and strangely gamey, the 4 bite-sized chunks of kabob were average. The singular tiny lamb chop was pretty good, though. Also, the hummus was quite good as well. For better and more cost-effective Middle Eastern, I'll stick to Kabobeesh or Saad's, which are both closer to home, or Divan for nicer ambiance. Heck, I'll even take S&H Kabob House or any of the other places on South Street (South Street Souvlaki, or the one with the Disney's Aladdin window painting) over this place.

I called to postpone 30 minutes and the hostess said that kitchen closes at 11PM. Show didn't finish until 10:45 and we were starving. My boyfriend would not go anywhere else because he was craving hummus and pita bread. Ugh! Most likely, we were one of the first few people to go down the steps from the amphitheater. We were quick. Made it at the restaurant at 10:48. Obviously, the hostess notified us again that the kitchen would close in a few but we were able to sit. God knows how many servers were mad at us when saw that we grabbed a table. However, one of the managers made sure that we got served, left happy and satisfied. Immediately, they brought the fresh pita bread and hummus. We devoured on both of them and ordered our main dishes as fast as we could. They brought us a second round of very warm pita with hummus. We felt a little inappropriate since it's not like we wanted to have them work extra on a Saturday night which is the busiest day of the week. But as I mentioned above, our food cravings were too strong. My boyfriend ordered a fresh Louvraki (This fish made it's way from the Mediterranean all the way to Philly! Yay!). He liked his dish very much. I ordered a moussaka since I haven't had this dish in a very long time. \u00a0I couldn't finish it for three reasons: I ate too much hummus and pita bread, portion was a little too big, and it's a heavy dish from all the ingredients stuffed on top of each other.

We had the Estia chips to start - crispy zucchini and eggplant served with a tzatziki sauce. I thought they were really good! I would recommend that for an appetizer for the table. For my main course, I had the crab cake burger. I thought it was pretty good and it was a nice, lighter option for lunch time. My dad had the beef souvlaki and he thought it was OK, but not the best. My mom had the Arugula salad, which was fine. The bathrooms are the floor below the main dining room and so you got to check out the private dining room that they have for large parties downstairs.

It reminded me of a play on congee rice porridge which was ok tasting overall but I wouldn't order it again. BF's salad was very simple and plain: greens and balsamic vinaigrette. The winning appetizer would be the crunchy fresh delicately coated calamari. The tile fish entree was bland to our group as well as the lamb pita. The dessert was our least favorite as it was a very simple slice of almond cake with a teeny butter-sized scoop of ice cream that honestly overall felt like an afterthought but I grew up in a bakery so my standards are a bit pickier for dessert. With some extra sauce or salt the entrees would've been more satisfying. We ordered off the restaurant week menu an appetizer which our waiter forgot to put it. That was the only dish that seemed up to par quality-wise with our expectations however it arrived way after we finished our entree's and by then it only added to the downhill experience here. Service was fair despite our forgotten appetizer, being splashed a bit of water during a refill, and once when the waiter dropped the butter knife next to my foot (luckily I was in rainboots and he had \"poor aim\").

It was particularly busy in there considering the light snow fall that evening but we were greeted warmly and seated fairly quick. Our server was pleasant, she introduced herself and provided water, immediately. She was able to provide a great cocktail recommendation that we thoroughly enjoyed. We informed her that we were doing the restaurant week menu and she suggested that we order different items to share, which was a great idea. We started with Spanakopita and Octopodi. The Spanakopita was ok, not the best I've had and definitely lacked some taste. I loved the grilled octopus, perfectly seasoned and cooked. For our entree, we had the Kotopoulo, an organic roasted chicken over orzo and Lavraki, a whole grille Mediterranean Sea bass. These two were great, seasoned well, deboned and great portion. Both of these items were perfectly cooked and moist. For dessert, we had the Yogurt Mousse and Ekmek, a Kataifi phyllo topped with custard, pistachios, whipped cream and more pistachios. I wish we would have ordered two Yogurt Mousse because that was worth the entire dining experience, alone. We did not care much for the Ekmek. I think I would come back again but in this city there are a lot of competitions for amazing Greek food. It wasn't the most amazing Greek food but at the same time, we had a great time, the server was wonderful and the meal was decent."], ["Jenna H.", "Octopodi and the pan-fried cheese dish (don't remember greek name) were incredible. The lavraki was so flavorful. The baklava was unforgettable - not too sweet and syrupy like it is sometimes. A little pricey but perfect for restaurant week!"], ["Shirl C.", "Very clean restaurant with GREAT food!! I have probably been here almost 15 times or more, and I am rarely disappointed. The price is just right for the quality of meal...Great variety and superb service."], ["Flavia C.", "Another rest meal at Estia. I am on a cleanse and can eat so few things. I was trying to figure out if there was anyplace I could go. It was the perfect place! Ordered Bronzino, when you order the whole fish it's so delicious you don't miss that there is no marinade the lemon and olive oil are perfect! Grilled veggies & lots of water. Healthy great meal. Jessica was a delightful server, so friendly & helpful and didn't even look sideways when I listed all the things I couldn't have:). Definitely returning soon."], ["Susan M.", "Presentation is everything at Estia! The decor, the waitstaff, and the plating - the entire experience is meant to impress! It's an excellent choice for a pre Kimmel Center or Academy show! They have a broad menu, as well as two Prix Fixe options including a $30 business lunch, and a Sunday Brunch. We opted for the Sunday brunch. I highly recommend the poached eggs with spinach and bacon. It was beautifully plated and savory! The breakfast potatoes were crispy and well seasoned and the filo cup made for such a beautiful plate I almost didn't want to eat it!Seating is plentiful, but different levels and rooms help keep the noise to a minimum. Sometimes it's packed, and others not so a reservation is definitely recommended! The bathrooms are stunning and well worth a visit even if not necessary! The service is friendly, and handsome to boot!"], ["Chris S.", "Everything on the menu is great, but try our faves: The grilled octopus and beet salad for starters. The roast chicken and the salmon for the main. The staff is friendly and quick -- I wish they knew a bit more about the culture and food, but they were very courteous and the food remarkable."], ["Christine F.", "We dined at this restaurant to celebrate our daughter's college graduation. \u00a0It was especially meaningful because she had studied abroad in Greece. \u00a0It was a gorgeous May evening and we \u00a0were seated at a fantastic table in the front with the window panels open to the street. \u00a0Our daughter was thrilled to sample so many of the foods she had enjoyed in Greece....especially the fried cheese, the spread pikilia and the grilled pita bread. \u00a0Never tasted pita like that before.....delicious. \u00a0 The a la carte menu is pricey but they also have a $30 price fixe menu which had a good selection. \u00a0The service was excellent! \u00a0This is the perfect place for a special celebration!"], ["Giuliano P.", "Estia is top notch! Fresh amazing seafood where you know you pay for quality. Took my father here Monday for Father's Day since we all work on Sunday. Staff is friendly and accommodating and we we're very comfortable. My father is a stickler for food and it's hard for him to go out to eat, but estia delivered.Started with the octopus salad which was so good we had to order 2. Flavorful and cooked perfectly. Also had the fried zucchini chips which were so light and fresh and not filled with oil. We also had lagostinos which are probably my favorite thing in the world. My mother had the lamb which is incredible; nice size portion tender and juicy and the greatest part not overally gamy which most lamb is. I have the lavarki which was a massive whole fish but it was perfectly cooked and not dry. My father had the black seA bass and my brother had the halibut. They seemed to enjoy it very much. Dessert was balaclava and a chocolate suflee. Although they can't make an espresso (most places can't) it was a great evening and I'm so glad that I finally got to try the place.I recommend 100%"], ["Marthy S.", "Center City Restaurant Week brought my date and me here for dinner.Upon walking up to the restaurant I noticed they have outdoor seating which is always a nice option for diners. \u00a0The restaurant architecture on the outside is brightly lit up like a classy broadway theater.Inside however the restaurant decor takes on Greek charm that I perhaps would expect to see if I was actually in Greece. \u00a0I loved the blackened steel gate that opens up to the restaurant.Had to wait about 10 minutes for them to clear our table even though we had a reservation and we were the only ones waiting for a table. Oh well no worries. Just an observation to point out.As we walked to our table we noticed their fresh seafood on top of ice, on display for all to see. (Nice detail Estia!)The restaurant itself is romantically dimly lit. (Hopefully I didn't distract too many patrons with my camera flash....SORRY! I was doing it for the love of Yelp!)Service was spot on. \u00a0Server was attentive and friendly, offering up suggestions and keeping an eye on us, making sure we were good on drinks.FOOD TIME! \u00a0Really loved their selection of dishes for their RW menu.FIRST COURSE:Date ordered Soup of the day - a spin on Italian wedding but \"Greek style\". \u00a0The meat balls consisting of beef, lamb and rice and were in a chicken broth. Waaaay too salty for either of us.I ordered the Octopodi which is grilled octopus served over red and sweet onions. \u00a0After eating this I realized the only way I like octopus is sushi/sashimi style. \u00a0The flavor was lost in the grilling but the texture of the octopus was there. \u00a0SECOND COURSE:Date and I split the Lavraki (whole grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass topped with ladolemeno and capers - this dish does not come with sides and the server let us know that which we appreciated) and the Arni Paidakia (lamb chops servied with roasted potatoes and tzatziki sauce)Both were very good. \u00a0The Lavraki comes de-boned, and is very light and fresh. (I think most people might be used to a fattier Chilean sea bass. \u00a0The Lavraki is lighter almost like tilapia) \u00a0Definitely needed the lemon to add that acidity and the capers also helped to add more of that flavor. \u00a0The lamb chops were a bit too fatty and I wouldn't order this again if this is the case, off the menu. \u00a0They were also more overcooked than we'd like them to be and we did ask for them to be cooked medium rare. I'm guessing they rested too long. The potatoes were nothing special and the tzatziki was really good...more creamy than what I'm used to but flavorful. THIRD COURSE: DESSERT!!!!!We each shared one of each: Yogurt Mousse (Greek yogurt whipped with fresh cream served with figs baked in samos wine) and the Baklava (layered phyllo with almonds in a honey syrup). \u00a0BOTH WERE SOOOOO GOOD! \u00a0One of the best Baklava's I've had..nice and simple. \u00a0The Yogurt Mousse presentation was a bit wonky but the flavors were all there. \u00a0Good combo to have both desserts.Overall I don't think I would come back here but it was a nice dining experience since my date and I both love Greek food. \u00a0I would recommend this restaurant to people who love Greek food and want to take someone on a classy date."], ["Heather V.", "Yum! Very high-end Mediterranean place! It was a nice change of pace from the mom and pop restaurants. Although I do like the family touch to meals! Great service and awesome audience! Oh and the food was amazing! Yum yum!"], ["Sarah T.", "The atmosphere very romantic! Feels like you were whisked away to the Greek islands. The food is okay, I wasn't blown away. We went as a big group and got a good table. The drinks were very good but service was a little slow. Its a nice spot and would maybe give it another try."], ["Neen J.", "Delish and delightful! The food is always great quality and each morsel even yummier than the one before. It is GF friendly with several options and the staff are so helpful and obviously enjoy their roles. The greek salad is one of my favorite dishes and the tomatos were divine. I also loved the roast chicken that was served with grilled vegies for me (to make it a GF option). The servers at the bar have a generous pour and they have fun educating their diners on wines. Totally recommend it."], ["Kelly A.", "Recently visited with some friends for restaurant week. We had the octopus and pan-fried cheese apps along with the lamp chops and whole fish for our meals. The meal was lovely and our server was pleasant (although not very attentive which we attributed to restaurant week). The lamb chops normally would have been $42 and their entrees are all $30+ without sides generally. It's not unreasonable for the area but it does seem a little pricey \u00a0for a meal we thought was not very special. Cocktails are standard for the area $10-$14. We probably won't be back but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying it at least once."], ["Angela A.", "My husband and I ate here, for the first time, last night, before going to the Ballet. We had a reservation for 5:30, and we were seated right away. My husband and I ordered the Greek salad, and the Lamb Chops. The salad was very fresh, and seasoned perfectly. The lamb chops were very tender, almost melt in your mouth, and had a great seasoning on them as well. My husband, who doesn't even like lamb, enjoyed his dish and said it was the best he'd ever had. The service, however, left much to be desired. We didn't order alcohol or dessert, and we felt like our server was not interested in waiting on us and we felt rushed. He didn't communicate with us, and every time we needed something, we would have to hunt him down much to his sour look on his face. I agree with a former yelper when they said that the wait staff just seemed very unhappy to be there so I deducted a star for the poor service.All in all, we will be back. The food is delicious, but the service has a lot of improvements to work on."], ["Jennifer C.", "This restaurant is absolutely stunning. There are a lot of components to the design and layout and I wish I had more time just to look around and appreciate the decor. We came here after my college graduation and were seated at a beautiful table by a window. It was very intimate and allowed for privacy without having us feel like we were forgotten by the staff. Our waiter was very very attentive and friendly but bordered on being a little bit too attentive. The food was great but I think I was expecting it to be a little bit better. I had the business lunch - Octopodi was fresh tasting a beautifully played. The whole fish, Bronzino, was perfectly cooked. The best part of my meal was the dessert - baklava. Overall I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Greek food or is looking for a really lovely dining experience."], ["Anne K.", "Came here for Restaurant Week last month with a girlfriend. We were shooting for variety and ordered the following:Spanakopita (spinach pie with feta, leeks baked in homemade phyllo)Octopodi (grilled octopus served over red and sweet onions)Arni Paidakia (lamb chops served with roasted potatoes and tzatziki)Galactobourico (Semolina custard wrapped in phyllo with orange, lemon zest syrup)Baklava (layered phyllo with almonds in a honey syrup)I don't have that much experience with Greek food and it's not one of my usual go-to cuisines, but I had a really enjoyable dinner at Estia. The octopodi was my favorite dish of the night - it was perfection! I could have easily eaten another plateful. The spinach pie was good, but if you need to choose between one or the other - I'd recommend the octopodi. The lamb chops were excellent as well - the creamy tzatziki sauce really mellows out the stronger flavors of the lamb. Our only complaint was that the roasted potatoes were over-salted.The other dessert was okay, but I LOVED their baklava. I've never had good baklava before (it's always been too soggy for some reason...) and I was really pleased with Estia's rendition. Just the right amount of nutty and sweet, and the flaky phyllo really held up against the syrup."], ["Aniece M.", "Okay.. so I recently got into Greek food and let me just say, I'M HOOKED! Estia was my first real taste of it and it's honestly where I always compare other places to. My first time was around Christmas 2013 after watching a show right across the street. We picked food from the theater menu cuz it seemed like the best deal. The food was amazing. I can not stop thinking about the delicious fresh hot pita bread and hummus they serve you as you sit down. Ugh! I've been back a couple times since December and it's been a hit each and every time. I've tried different things from their lunch menu and those are also very good. I honestly think that the best burger I've ever had was from Estia. Yes, even their burger is amazing! Their prices can be pretty steep.. but honestly, I'd pay it for some really good food. The atmosphere and ambiance is very soothing and just so beautiful inside. If you are ever in that area and want to try something new, check this place out."], ["Therese M.", "Greek was my boyfriend's cuisine of choice for his birthday dinner this year. His bday also happens to fall during restaurant week and I knew Estia would be the perfect place to take him. \u00a0We took advantage of the RW menu and really enjoyed what we ordered. This was the grilled octopus and sea bass for me, salad and lamb chops for him. Grilled octopus on a menu is a no-brainer for me and they do a great job preparing it here. The sea bass was delicious.. it was light and pretty much just melted in your mouth. Judging by his reaction to the lamb chops, he was more than happy with his meal. As far as RW goes, Estia is definitely somewhere you get your money's worth and then some. So worth it. Another successful bday / restaurant week dinner for the books!"], ["Michael M.", "Went in for luncheon with co-workers. \u00a0Slow. Slow. Slow. \u00a0We must have had the new servers because they were running around like it was their first day. \u00a0A simple lunch for 4 people took almost two hours. \u00a0I had the lunch express: soup and chicken souvlaki (skewers). \u00a0The meal and tip was $23. \u00a0Food was expensive and unexceptional. \u00a0I will be passing on this one in the future. \u00a0C-"], ["Renee B.", "Beautiful restaurant! \u00a0I dined here during restaurant week and enjoyed it. Chose the vegetarian options that were offered on the tailored menu, which were delicious. Would like to go back when I can choose from the full menu."], ["L S.", "I FINALLY got to try this place. I've been wanting to try Estia for MONTHS! On Sunday my fiance asked me what I \u00a0wanted for dinner and I said \"Estia!\" We got there around 8:30 PM, it wasn't very many people which was fine to me it made the experience that more initmate. I ordered from the Theater Menu ( Appetizer-the spankopita, lamb meatball, spring salad. Main Course- Chicken. Dessert - Fresh Fruit). My fiance got the steak. He devoured his steak. My meal was very enjoyable. The Service was really great too. As a side note this may be one of the few places where I didn't really want to leave the ladies room it's so unique and kinda welcoming lol."], ["Jordan H.", "Food good. Service sloooow and they forget a ton of stuff. Boo. Still waiting for my 2nd course"], ["Reem C.", "I've always loved Greek food and looked forward to dining at Estia for the first time. I decided it would be a great place to take my wife for her birthday. We began with Spanakopita, which was excellent. It was large enough to share between two people. My wife ordered Plaki, which is sea bass in a sweet and savory tomato sauce, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers, carrots, potatoes, capers and thyme. It was very delicious.I ordered Arni Piadakia, which is lamb chops that have been marinated for three days in olive oil, lemon and fresh herbs. In my opinion, Estia has the best lamb chops I have ever tasted. If you like lamb chops, I highly recommend this selection. You won't be disappointed. My only suggestion is different potatoes. The potato tiganites is basically French fries. For dessert, we shared Karidopita, which is a traditional honey walnut cake. It's very sweet and tastes like it was soaked in honey. We both loved it. It was accompanied with a scoop of vanilla gelato. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the great service our server, Mark, provided. He took the time to explain a lot, made recommendations and much more. It made our great dining experience even greater. I definitely plan to return again. Next time, I'll take advantage of the theatre menu."], ["Shauna G.", "Despite what its somewhat cheesy looking sign and kind of awkward location might lead you to believe, Estia is quite fantastic. \u00a0I've now had two phenomenal experiences here (one during restaurant week and one on Valentine's Day) and I have to say... yum.So what's delicious? \u00a0Well, everything I've had is great, but a few things rise to the top...Appetizers - Saganaki (this is a no brainer... fried cheese? Duh), Estia Chips, SpanokopitaMain Dish - LAMB CHOPS, all the wayDessert - Chocolate Souffl\u00e9Drink - Who knew Greeks made wine??? There was a Greek white that tasted very much like a Sauvignon Blanc that I enjoyed. Also, the bourbon cocktail on the list is a winner.The moral of this story? \u00a0Don't judge a book by it's cover... or a restaurant by its signage."], ["De C.", "Beautiful dinning space, but just so disappointed with the food. \u00a0The meat in the mixed grill plate was either too dry or over cooked, then French Fries were dumped on top of the plate. \u00a0No appeal, no quality, the Chef has no respect for their food. \u00a0Also slow service."], ["John B.", "Great service. Excellently prepared. Interesting ambiance. It's great to go to before the ballet. We've come here a lot and are never let down. Opa!"], ["Frank H.", "Preshow dinner at six. \u00a0The room was spectacular. Was not expecting anything like it.So we were seated at six. Took the waiter 10 minutes before his first visit to our table. We ordered a bottle of wine and waited another 10 minutes before it was placed on our table but un \u00a0opened for another 10 minutes. So a half hour has gone by and all we have done is opened a bottle of wine. Our waiter Kevin had three tables. One of the tables was a six top, and did seem to be high maintenance. Service did not get any more attentive as the night went on.We had the grilled octopus. Fantastic! And the three humus spreads. Very good. For dinner we had a whole grilled fish. Very good. The \u00a0salads and the sides are Alacarte. We split the romaine salad and the roasted potatoes. Both were decent.So now it is 20 minutes before showtime and we have no time for coffee or dessert.This does seem to be a common theme for preshow dinners at Estia. That is why I thought I was giving us plenty of time by making my reservation at six. Wrong! \u00a0They are very busy. But when you are dropping $250 on dinner I expect really good service. Not excuses. With all that said, I would go back."], ["Kate F.", "The complimentary bread and hummus is the perfect way to start the meal. I am used to eating store-brand hummus, so their homemade hummus was definitely a treat. The spanakopita tastes like the spinach pie that I tried in Greece, and the country salad ranks as my favorite offering on the menu. The highlights of the salad were the imported tomatoes, which were bright red, juicy, and sweet, and the feta cheese. The grilled salmon, served with wilted greens, was great as well, but I prefer to order an appetizer and salad. I am absolutely in love with the decor - stone ceilings with chandeliers, wood floors, and booths with pillows. I recommend making a reservation, as they get quite busy around dinner time, especially after shows at the Academy of Music. They also serve brunch, which I look forward to trying."], ["Ann V.", "Estia is beautiful and has the perfect ambiance.They makes me best octopus appetizer I've ever tasted. It was tender and juicy! I could seriously have 10 plates of it. Yum yum yum. Octopus...."], ["Maurice S.", "To begin with, the service was great from the time we walked in the door until the time that we left. \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0We all ordered from the restaurant week menu and every course was great. \u00a0I had the Octopodi, Arni Paidakia (lamb chops), and Baklava.Everyone that had the fish said that it was amazing. \u00a0I will be trying that next time."], ["B K.", "I have been here twice, first time was okay nothing that great. Second time we went with our seven year old and I was very pregnant and we were told that it would be hours before they could seat us. I felt something wasn't right I assumed it was because our entire wasn't the typical fancy restaurant(keep in mind I was huge pregnant and nothing fits right). We left and I decided I'd call just to see what their wait time was and was informed they would be able to seat us right away. Never going back. Didn't even taste like authentic Greek food and for that price it better taste like yiayia's!"]]}
