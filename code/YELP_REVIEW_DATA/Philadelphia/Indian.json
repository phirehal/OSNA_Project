There were so many delicious options, I didn't know what to choose!! We got a few items on the menu and shared. The spice level was accurate, I asked for about a 6 on a scale of 1-10 and it came out just how I like it!! The service was excellent, we weren't in a rush and he was very patient. He was very understanding of my line of questioning when asking about gluten free items. After our meal we stayed a while longer to finish our bottle of wine. I am very pleased with this restaurant and will have very high expectations for Indian cuisine in the future!"], ["Nicole M.", "This was our go to spot for Indian food. We order at least once a month. I was extremely disappointed in our delivery order this time. \u00a0We ordered through eat 24 and I marked my order as not spicy and added special instructions of not spicy. I know it's Indian food, but they have giving me this request many times in the past. My dish was extremely spicy. We called to explain the situation asking for a new dish that was not spicy. They argued with us that we said medium spicy. I have the ordered receipt indicating that I did in fact order not spicy. They were extremely rude to us. We asked for a refund on just my dish and they hung up on us.We called Eat 24 and they told us that our order went through as I asked. They tried to call the restaurant to discuss it with them, but Eat 24 said the restaurant is not even answering the phone.It's a shame that a restaurant with good food is losing regular customers due to horrendous service."], ["Ariel W.", "Holy moly is their delivery FAST. I placed my order around 6:09 and the driver texted me at 6:13 saying my food had arrived AND this text came after I missed his call. I'm not exaggerating, these are the literal time stamps on my phone!All the food was piping hot and the garlic naan smelled amazing before I even opened the foil. When I did I saw that it was SMOTHERED in heavenly garlic (just the way I like it) and also bigger than my face. I also got chicken tikka which came with a good sized portion of basmati rice. Though it was on the pricier side, it definitely hit the spot and will now be my go-to for those once in a while Indian comfort food cravings."], ["Aria S.", "After reading the glowing reviews, I have been wanting to try either of their spots for a while so when I saw a groupon, I snagged that baby. \u00a0I ended up going alone for dinner last night (lol) and here are some comments...The shahi paneer & bhaigan bartha were decently spicy and fresh and not oily. If you can handle it, I'd suggest going for the extra spicy instead of spicy.The paneer wasn't that gross frozen stuff and actually tasted like paneer (cheese). Yaass! Bhaigan (eggplant) is one of their house specials and I'm glad I got it. It is generally really hard to make any eggplant dish without putting a ton of oil it in, but they did it well. Raita was also good and not sweet. Garlic naan perfff. Highly suggest getting some in addition to the rice provided. All in all...I'm really excited to eat my leftovers for lunch.

As a Philly newbie I did not aware this restaurant was far from Rittenhouse square. We had to drive to Northern liberty to eat since I already got the coupon. Food better be good.... Two of us got samosa chaat and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and mango lassi. Apparently yelp review www pretty accurate. This was 4 star restaurant for me. Samosa chaat was huge as appetizer. Probably most girls would be ok for their main dish itself. Chicken tikka masala was creamy, buttery and meat was tender. Delicious. We ended up having whole bowl of rice with it. Lassi was thick and amazing. I hate watery lassi and this place wasn't one of them.

We decided to try some take out from Mood: chicken tikka masala, bainban bharta, lamb vindaloo, and the naan and garlic naan.The portion sizes were similar to other Indian restaurants.

Wasn't very impressed but it was worth a shot."], ["Felicia C.", "Mood came to our office for Fooda today, and they had a \"buffet special\" for the introductory price of $6! It included lamb rogan josh, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, mutter paneer, rice, and naan! They even had three different delicious sauces: yogurt, tamarind, and mint. It was wonderful! The lamb was very tender, and everything was just spicy enough, somewhere between mild and medium.

It is tucked away inside a residential complex on 4th St in the Northern Liberties \u00a0neighborhood. Got Samosa chaat and a chicken Malabari for appetizers. The Samosa chaat was nice and fresh and the chicken Malabari was pretty good too. For the main course we got a Tandoori Salmon, a Baingan Bharta and a Chicken Makhani. All three dishes were slightly on the sweeter side (read a little more creamy) but nice nevertheless. The only bit of a let down was the salmon which turned out over done.The bread basket was adequate for three people. We went with the laccha paratha, onion kulcha and garlic naan and all three turned out pretty good. Portions are fairly large and filling. We would give this place 3.5 stars (rounded to 4).

When 95 South was jammed south of Girard, I was able to jump off, zigzag my way to Spring Garden, make a left on N.4th, and start looking for my destination. \u00a0There it was, but at first view it seemed to be behind bars. \u00a0Fences and security everywhere. \u00a0Reminded of prison gates. \u00a0Quickly realized all that parking was for residents, and the street meters were the only nearby option. \u00a0At 12 minutes for .25 on a Saturday night, I fished out all my quarters and fed the hungry metal mouth. Then located the narrow opening in the fence and the walkway leading to the resto. \u00a0I hoped I had all the necessary credentials to get through customs. The boss was squeegeeing his front windows as I walked up to the door. \u00a0I was impressed that he had not delegated the work, but took pride in his shop's appearance, knowing that first impressions are so important. \u00a0Stepping inside after confirming I had arrived with Ali, I was taken by the crispness of the white linen tablecloths and red napkins. \u00a0The space had high industrial ceilings, giving an open sensation. \u00a0I was shown to the table and sat down to await the arrival of my friends. \u00a0I was alone there at 6 pm; thinking that Indians/Pakistanis prefer late dinners. \u00a0I liked the vibe as I perused the menu and took in the details. \u00a0After V & M arrived, we ordered several dishes to get a cross section of the kitchen fare. \u00a0Samosa Chaat, Chicken Malabar for apps; Salmon Tandoori, Chicken Makhani, Baingan Bharta(Eggplant), a Bread Basket mix, and Basmati Rice as entrees. \u00a0 Mango Lassi for me, and Sweet Lassi for M. \u00a0 All were good to excellent. Most memorable were the Chicken Malabar which was grilled and breaded with Coconut, the Samosa Chaat, which had all the ingredients of a Samosa, but reformulated into an open dish full of Potato, Peas, various crunchy chips and spices. Additionally, the Baingan Bharta was very well done with a complementary heat/sweet texture, and the Makhani was tender in a Tomato base curry that was requested hot spiced and delivered fully. \u00a0The Salmon Tandoori was the most colorful dish (see photo), but the fish was a tad dry and the veggies and spices so overpoweringly good, that the mild taste of the Salmon was somewhat hidden by its pushy roommates. All in all, a very good meal in a pleasant environment. \u00a0By the time we left around 8, the room was full, along with our stomachs. \u00a0We ended up taking a large portion home with us. \u00a0I will definitely return once they let me out on parole."], ["Chris W.", "These Folks are genuinely very nice, but the space is really tough to make work. The food is middle of the road - several notches below Ekta and the other pacesetters in the city. Very friendly staff and ownership.

Would be great eaten like a salad on a hot summer day.Lamb Chops were unfortunately a single note dish - lacked depth and layering of flavor that separates really good Indian.I am mixed on whether I would go back."], ["Rebecca F.", "Good food. Not as good as Ekta, I will say that, but it's solid Indian food that is on part with Tiffin. Okay, enough comparisons. Let's talk about what we ordered.The chat papri was VERY satisfying. The palak paneer and vegeterian kofta were also very tasty as well. I was happy with the level of spice - I think I got a 4 out of 5 and my nose ran appropriately. The naan was fresh and they had interesting varieties, including one with dried fruit and nuts. The atmosphere is very casual, with the restaurant situated inside a condo complex and facing a parking lot. The service was very friendly and helpful, the restaurant large and clean.

Don't be deterred by the weird location in the ground floor of a loft condo building. Their service is obviously pretty good considering there's never anyone in the place. \u00a0I've always received delivery orders in a timely fashion and my take-out is always ready to be picked up when promised. The owner is super friendly if you start a conversation with him and the last time I was in he thanked me for my patronage and gave me all sorts of coupons. \u00a0Now for the food. \u00a0I've eaten at almost every Indian restaurant in the city. \u00a0While I've certainly had better Indian food in other cities, Mood is pretty darn good for Philly. I've tried all of the vegetarian appetizers and they are all pretty tasty. The mint chutney is crave-worthy. \u00a0The vegetarian entrees are all flavorful and the portions are a good size. My favorites are the dal makhani, malai kofta, mutter paneer, and shahi paneer. \u00a0Don't be afraid to ask for it medium or spicy if you like some heat. The raita is fresh and a good addition to your meal to cool things down. Also, I was in during lunch hours recently and their buffet was a little disappointing, only because it only had two vegetarian entrees and I'm used to Indian buffets being pretty vegetarian-heavy. \u00a0It is a flat price for take-out instead of weighted, though, so you could definitely stuff your little styrofoam container to the max. The highlight of the lunch hour at Mood is their \"vegetable wrap.\" \u00a0It has been listed as a lunch special every time I've ever been there. \u00a0It's basically a piece of naan lined with raita and some chutney and stuffed with strips of seasoned paneer and vegetables.

For appetizers, you can choose a chaat, salad, soup, or one of their super yummy fusion plates. Appetizers I like:-The drums of heaven (battered chicken wings with blue cheese crumble, garlic, tomato, chili and scallions) are so perfectly flavored. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. And you get 4 of these amazing things-Naan pizza! They have different flavors all the time.

It comes with a super yummy dipping sauce of tamarind barbeque and blue cheese wine.-Stuffed long hot peppers. You get 2 big ol' smoked green peppers, stuffed with house-made paneer, mozzarella, deghi chili, spring onions, with a fresh tomato sauce on the bottom.-Aloo makkai tikki are these 2 yummy spiced potato cakes with corn and apple chutney. ALL SUPER TASTY!Entrees:-The best one is chicken tikka makhani (butter chicken). The chicken is apparently free range, and obviously delicious. the sauce is beautifully spiced, and tastes right. Not like the nasty overly creamy ones I have to eat in New Jersey :( It's served with fenugreek, black pepper, saffron rice, which is so delicious, but still needs to be drowned in the beautiful makhani sauce.- Lamb rogan josh is also really good! It's a less interesting tasting sauce in my opinion, but still delicious. Kinda like a lamb stew but spiced with an Indian flair. The lamb had a great, tender texture, and the sauce was so hearty and yummy. This also came with the awesome herb rice.Overall, an awesome date place!!

Our waiter was very knowledgeable so his recommendations were spot on."], ["Courtney J.", "I've been in love with the IndeBlue in Collingswood for a few years now, so I was excited to hear they were getting a location in Philly.A couple of friends and I went to Happy Hour here last week, and we were impressed with the food deals. \u00a0The happy hour is from 5:00-7:00 Monday-Friday at the bar. \u00a0The food prices range from $3-$5. \u00a0The veggie samosas were only $3 and came with two large ones in a chickpea sauce. \u00a0They were stuffed full of potatoes and chickpeas. \u00a0I also ordered the nan pizza ($5), which is just what it sounds like, a large piece of nan with pizza toppings. \u00a0This particular one came topped with paneer, mozzarella cheese, spinach, and peppers. \u00a0The type of pizza changes daily though, so ask before ordering. \u00a0I was stuffed after having only those two appetizers.The drink I had was less impressive, but at only $5 it was alright. \u00a0It was the Chikini Shandar. \u00a0This is basically sangria with an Indian twist as chai and cardamom are added. \u00a0However, I didn't taste any of these wonderful flavors. \u00a0It was sweet and just tasted like regular sangria. \u00a0Since the appetizers were good, I'll be back. \u00a0I'll try a different drink next time, and hopefully it'll be better."], ["Emma M.", "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia! The food is superb. The service is attentive and seamless. The venue is elegant and beautiful, and the prices are uber-reasonable. Moreover, it caters not just to carnivorous diners, but to vegans and gluten-free acolytes alike. Yay!I like to sample as much of a restaurant's offerings as I can. Indeblue's menu certainly encourages that. I'll typically get the smaller versions of two entrees, throw in an appetizer and naan bread, and order one of their homemade desserts. They also offer a tasting menu, which I highly recommend.Since it's conveniently located near the Kimmel Center and other performance venues I like to frequent, I'll often come here for dinner. If I order before 7 pm, I've asked for my drink at Happy Hour prices even though my meal came from the dinner menu. Bear in mind that Happy Hour restarts at 9 pm! So indulge in a sumptuous meal, walk a few blocks to your performance, and return to Indeblue afterwards for a post-show drink.It's a great place to bring a date, enjoy a pleasant business dinner, or have a nice evening out with friends."], ["Vidushi B.", "This review update is for the brunch - dinner is still a solid 5 stars for me! I also enjoyed my brunch, but I still think dinner here is better. The ambiance obviously does not change from dinner to brunch -- but they do have live sitar and tabla at noon, which is a nice touch. To start, I ordered chai, and obviously loved it. I don't mean a chai tea latte, I mean real, milky, overly sweet chai, which is just the way I like it. We got the spinach chaat as an appetizer, which you'll know from all the other reviews, is the best dish at this restaurant. I am getting hungry just thinking about it.For my entree, I decided to have the paneer bhurjee, which is one of the more traditional items on the menu. It came with a small chili cheese naan. It was very flavorful, and I really liked it. The awkward thing was that they naan was pretty small, and I had so much bhurjee left over at the end. I took it home, and tonight, I ordered take-out naan to finish it with...My friends got the dosa and the french toast, and both were impressed. However, I think that getting the more fusion dishes is the move here, because that's what IndeBlue is good at - putting a new spin on more traditional dishes!"], ["Farha A.", "This was by far one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever encountered - and I am an Indian. What I appreciated most is the uniqueness of the dishes while still maintaining an authentic taste and reverence to South Asian cuisine. I went during happy hour to eat and the happy hour foods were served in generous portions for only $3, $4, or $5 max. My favorite dish was the Spinach Chaat. It was composed of crunchy Spinach flash fried in chick pea powder with other various spices and sauces typical to a chaana or samosa chaat. It was a very light yet satisfying dish and it took a lot of restraint not to order more as I still had plenty more coming.The drums of heaven, hot long peppers, veggie samosas, and shrimp with chilli aoili were also things I tried and loved each and every single one. The bartender serving my food was very kind and informative, offering explanations and recommendations and the food arrived promptly.Best part is all of this came out to be only around ~$20 so if you are a student like me wanting some delicious, gourmet food with a unique flair, I HIGHLY recommend Indeblue. One of my top 3 favorite restaurants in Philly!"], ["Mandy D.", "IndeBlue is one of my go-to happy hour spots. The location is great for me and they have wonderful food and drink specials. Their drinks are different and interesting and tend to include cardamom, which sounded a little weird to me at first, but I really enjoyed the indebluetini, which has mango, cardamom, citron vodka, and lemon juice. It just works. They also have a delicious spinach chaat. I don't know how they keep the spinach as crispy as they do, but it is so crunchy and perfect with a mix of salty and sweet spices. Definitely try it! The naan pizzas are always a safe bet and the drums of heaven are the perfect cure for hankering for buffalo wings. At $4-$5 a piece during Happy Hour, its not a bad deal at all. I will be back!"], ["Adrienne D.", "I love this place! All is great....from the happy hour to the customer service! My current favs - the rib samosas and the drumsticks. Want to try out small plates and good drinks at a reduced price? The happy hour is a sure bet. Get here on a Monday or at 5pm sharp to get a good space. Reservations recommended. Overall, been here four times. Between me and my friends - all the dishes have been great.

The atmosphere was on-point with great service and even live music to put you more in the mood for Indian food!

So I'm just giving my opinion on what I've encountered..Our waiter wasn't as helpful as I had hoped. I told him it was my first time trying Indian food, and he didn't offer any type of suggestions. We went with the chefs tasting menu. I wasn't wow'd. \u00a0If it's a \"Chefs Tasting Menu\"... shouldn't the \"chef\" put it together? Why am I selecting all the options.. I wasn't getting a \"pre fixe'd\" meal.. Anyways.. after what it seemed like pulling teeth out of our waiter, \"MONICAs TASTING MENU included: spinach - i enjoyed. it was crunchy and delicious. something i've never had. \u00a0scallop - nothing special. ONE medium size scallop in a puddle of sauce.lamb chop - too salty.chicken - chewy and a bit on the dry side. goat - very tender and moist. ....dessert (which the chef finally decided to put together cuz their was no option). it consist of homemade ice cream, something like a fried banana dough, which i didn't taste any banana. rice pudding which was very waterdown...MAYBE i would come back for their lunch since there were items there that i did want to try which is not offered during dinner."], ["Marcie K.", "This place just blew my freaking mind. Everything we ate, \u00a0and I do mean everything, was PERFECT. \u00a0The service excellent, and the atmosphere really pleasant. \u00a0The spinach chaat - I'd push my mother in front of a train if I had to choose between her and the chaat. The seafood moille was superb. I would have liked a bit more variety in the seafood (90% shrimp) though. Just go there. \u00a0Eat everything on the menu. Be happy."], ["Jonathan S.", "I came here a year ago and had a good experience, so I took a friend here tonight. The food was okay-- nothing to write home about but not bad. However, the service was atrocious. The server wasn't rude exactly, but he clearly didn't want to be there and showed absolutely no enthusiasm. More importantly, I basically had to beg to place my order. When the food came, one of our two breads was missing-- as was the rice. The bread that did come was cold and overcooked. After we had clearly finished eating (they had cleared our plates and packed up the leftovers), we waited for at least fifteen minutes for the check. The only reason we got it was that we finally got the attention of the server. There must have been a computer problem or something because it then took him ten minutes to bring back my credit card. I can't recommend this place after having such horrible service."], ["Kal P.", "SPINACH CHAAT! That is all. Ya'll NEED to try this. I've come here multiple times for Happy Hour and once for dinner. The drinks are unique (one was super spicy which I wasn't a fan of) and the food is tasty. I was raised in an Indian household so I am a snob when it comes to Indian food - I highly recommend this place! Note: Not all the Naan Pizzas are yummy - they change them daily. Choose wisely."], ["Joel R.", "I love indeblue! Great Indian food, but on the expensive side. You can't go wrong with most of the menu. I believe they have live music on Thursday nights which is really well done, at least the night I was there."]], "New Delhi Indian Restaurant": [["Sophia H.", "Buffet. What more can you say? :) Good food and good atmosphere. I've talked with some people, and they all say New Delhi is the best of all Indian buffets around here. Also, 10% off for students with college IDs."], ["Sarah T.", "This is a solid Indian buffet with fresh and delicious food. They have a salad bar and small dessert area but the main pull is the hot foods bar. Veggie pakora and naan are included in the buffet. Biryani rice (not that flavorful and not the best I've had) and basmati rice (average) serve as the bases for the delicious entrees. The selection on the day that I went included tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, paneer masala, dal makhni (very bland), chicken curry, lamb saag wala, and mixed vegetables (in mild thick sauce- my 2nd favorite). I sampled the vegetarian items and my coworker sampled the meat items (we make a great team!), and we enjoyed all of them. My favorite was the paneer masala- the sauce was on point. The staff was constantly putting out fresh food and stirring the hot foods to ensure fresh taste. My only complaint is that it costs $9.95 plus tax for the lunch buffet, which I do think is a little bit high. They do offer delivery as well as vegan and gluten free items."], ["Kate G.", "I am a fan. If you want a buffet full of an array of choices, this is the place. Plus, as a person with gluten sensitivities, I really appreciate their marking the dishes with a GF on the buffet signage. Thank you for that. Indian food is one of those cuisines where it is hard to tell sometimes. Any time I \u00a0encounter delicious sauces, I take a chance. And their sauces are oh-so-good. Their chicken is tender, not overcooked. The buffet is continuously refreshed, stirred, and replenished by the friendly staff. And the hallway to the bathroom feels like you're headed on a space mission. New Delhi can get pretty loud, which creates a college cafeteria sort of ambience. I'd give them 5 stars but there is one Indian Restaurant in Philly that's my truer favorite."], ["Will C.", "Great Indian buffet for lunch. They have everything- samosas, chicken, lamb, rice, naan, salad, condiments, chai tea, and dessert. For 10 bucks!

Personally for me, I love their spiciest Saag dishes (either chicken or paneer) with garlic naan. If you're not too big on curry dishes, I would recommend my second favorite option - Chicken Tikka Biryani. Their chicken is very moist and delicate - similar to what you would expect from pulled chicken. Regardless of eating in or taking-out, their helpings are generous and the food is served at a perfectly warm temperature. Their buffet option is also very solid - multiple variants of curries with either meats or vegetables, samosas, plentiful naan, fruit for dessert, etc. If you're financially constraint, but still looking to get a good, hearty meal, I would recommend the buffet. Service is average... however, they are very attentive at ensuring you always have water available. \u00a0Sometimes they'll even leave the pitcher at the table for your convenience. Ambiance wise, the place is dimly lit so be prepared to get a bit more intimate with your dining partner(s). If the restaurant becomes a full house, be prepared to bump elbows/shoulders with people.

I first noticed New Delhi on my way to next-door Pattaya, and I assumed it was on the pricey side since the decorations were so nice and the lights were dim! But no, you get a spacious and swanky atmosphere, plus an all-you-can-eat buffet experience for only $11 and even less with a 10% student discount (EDIT: apparently they upped the price to $13 for dinner buffet and reduced their hours... boo). Service is attentive enough for a buffet, and they're pretty polite. Now hear me out, Sitar fans, I think New Delhi has many more options and less spicy food (aka more options for me) than Sitar for the same price. And I don't drink mango lassi anyway. Plus, the food is really great at New Delhi -- and possibly very Americanized, but I dig that! The fried chicken is surprisingly yummy, and the naan is usually just the right amount of cooked/burnt. I'll pass on the tandoori chicken... but I cannot get enough of the chicken tikka masala! Half my meal is usually just rice drenched in the stuff. They also have an extensive salad and chaat bar with great samosas to boot. When you get take-out, they charge it per pound and it ends up being much more expensive than dining in. We tried to fill up our take-out trays all the way and then ended up paying $16/person instead of $11 (at the time). Rookie mistake."], ["KJ S.", "Consistently good for years now! Hands down my favorite Indian buffet in the city. Every time my dad comes into town to visit, he insists on going here for lunch.

You tend to get either good food and poor service or vice versa with sometimes both poor service and poor food. This place however, is the exception.Friendly staff and a long narrowish dining area with bar at the back.The variety and quality of the food is good. I've eaten at the \"curry buffets\" around the US from NYC to Bay Area and frankly speaking this is probably 3rd place in my mind (btw number 1 = Rasoi in Iselin). That's really quite amazing for a city which overall disappoints for Indian.You get the standard tandoori chicken and tikka masala etc but additionally theres great vegetarian, lamb and paneer saag options too. Variety is significant factor it really is just right level for a buffet. Just enough to give you a wide variety of veg and non-veg options. There's even samosa's which is, surprisingly, not that common in the \"curry buffets\".The one thing that upsets me more than anything at buffets is skimping on the naan or trying to make it too fancy. Naan isn't the main event, its only meant to be the foundation. Just keep the damn tray full and hot and do not make me order naan selectively (yep, this is why I never went back to Ginger in Freehold). Not an issue at this place though - the naan options are good too with continual refills. No one will leave this place disappointed and it also has cheap beer!!!!Value of money is what really gets it to the 5 star though. For the price you pay this is simply outstanding.

I've never found their accents to be a problem but some people find it hard to understand. Biggest complaint is the wait time for food - they will wait until every item is ready and bring the food out all at once, which is terrible when you are starving. An empty plate will be placed in front of you about 10-15 minutes after your order, and food will follow another 15 minutes later. Waiting half an hour is not fun if you are hungry - they should bring the naan and other small appetizer items out first.Cheque also takes forever to come and process for some reason.

Another good note for New Delhi is the attentive staff who is there is refill your water (pitcher! They bring you a pitcher!) and clear your plate as quick as can be. And for $12 or so, you get the dinner buffet, which is more than enough for that price, as well as a small dessert! What could be better? If you're in, near or around University City, get your butt to New Delhi for some amazing eats. I believe they're open for lunch and dinner, so don't despair, daytime tummy-grumblers."], ["Saeed A.", "I am a cook for indian and Pakistani food.

I always find myself craving the same dish from New Delhi: Paneer Masala. It is perfectly orange and spicy, and the flavors are on point. Even though it is a little pricey for the amount you get, I still think it's worth it for when I'm craving a little taste of home while at school.The buffet is also great for dinner. Though the selection of vegetarian items isn't as extensive as the meat-based options, there still are some gems (though the paneer based dishes are always my favorite). The naan is usually really soft and tasty as well, and I definitely find myself eating tons and tons of naan during the buffet (so watch out carb-avoiders!) The only negative I'd say is the delivery service can sometimes be a bit slow. My friends and I order from New Delhi about once every two months or so, and usually it takes at LEAST an hour for the food to arrive (even though the distance between New Delhi and where we order from is so, SO small). Another warning-- the food tends to be a bit on the spicy side. Though I can handle a fair amount of spice, I order the medium Paneer Masala dish and I'm still pretty much in tears by the end of my meal. Thus, I'd probably order one spice level BELOW what I typically order (which is medium, pretty much every where I dine). Thus, when I order Paneer Masala next time, I'll definitely say MILD with my order instead of MEDIUM.That being said, it's not uncommon for me or a friend to text one another and ask \"New Delhi delivery tonight?\" It's been the source of a lot of happiness over the past year or so, and I'm glad to have this establishment with me for the next two years!"], ["Hab G.", "Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Philly.

It's heaven. The halal chicken is served freshly cooked on a tray with fresh naan, a mint chutney with it, and a sprinkling of salad. You eat with your hands -- pull off a piece of naan, grab a piece of the chicken with the bread, maybe grab a little lettuce, and dip in the chutney. It's a little crunchy on the outside and juicy inside. This is not overdone -- it's supposed to be that way and it's addictive. We always order a few extra pieces of naan.My husband is from a small village in Pakistan and said he thought the owner might be Bangladeshi but he said they make it just like in Pakistan. I could tell -- there's nothing like this anywhere in the whole area. About what people said about the samosas being dry.... I didn't find this to be the case at all but Kabobeesh makes homemade samosas while most of the places I've been to, just heat up commercial, packaged samosas and then add sauces on top... and I work in food. So if commercially-made samosas are what you're used to, you might not appreciate them when they're homemade.I usually want to eat the vegetable side dishes but they've all been way, way too spicy for me so I really wish they could at least have a way to control the spiciness for those. They do tend to be oily but my husband said that's how they make it over there. The one I find we can eat (not too too spicy) is the peas and potatoes and it's very good. You can ask for more salad with the barbecue chicken if you can't eat the spicy vegetable side dishes.I also always get a sweet lassi which is made like an authentic traditional lassi -- slightly sour and sweet. The first few times it was so good we ordered another one right away. The third time it was too sour, but these things happen when you're making homemade food in an authentic way. I don't mind if something isn't exactly perfect here and there.Try the frozen kulfi for dessert! They also have other authentic Pakistani desserts.I'm not usually one to care what a place looks like if the food is great but it could really use some brightening up. It's a little too dark, I dislike hearing television while eating, and a few times we've been there parents don't seem to do anything about their loud kids... and some of the patrons are super noisy too so I wish the people working there would tell them to be a little quieter so others could enjoy their meal... so expect to eat out-of-this-world chicken at a divey place... and you have to sort of compete for your place in line with taxi drivers who sometimes try to get in front of you... but the food is divine."], ["Syed A.", "The best pakistani food in philly there best kabobs and delicious food I love it all the time this service is pretty good and quick I love to come here all the time free parking in Philly"], ["Julie F.", "I feel blessed to live within walking distance of this amazing foodery.

The chickpeas are totally awesome, although they don't seem to be as good as they used to.The naan is great without falling into the floppy trap a lot of other naan seems to.

My husband had one conversation with one of these cricketers which rekindled his latent fascination with this sport and now we have Willow, the Cricket cable channel and a beach Cricket set for down the shore. Random Kabobeesh side-note factoid over.)I really enjoy the flavorful grill-fired tender lamb and tasty chicken kabobs, but I think that their tandoori chicken is my favorite favorite. This bird is stained bright red on the outside and kissed with char, while inside is bright white, juicy and delicious chicken on the bone. It's served with the most excellent naan- really the greatest. You also get to choose your side vegetables. Now, sometimes you choose one side and have a salad bag salad as your other option, but other times we've been able to pick two of their sides- Not sure what the rules are bout this, but two veg sides always beats the bag.And let is never be said that I am not one to appreciate a perfectly cooked chickpea. Kabobeesh's chana has never been mushy murk, in my experience. Instead the legumes are all incredibly in tact; firm plump fellas and all creamy inside, and swimming in well-spiced sauciness.

My Mango Lasi was good alsoMy daughter got a Kati Roll which she liked. The fries were surprisingly good. The inside was really pleasant and clean and hip. Sort of a fast food, good quality Indian restaurant. Not a bad choice for lunch or a quick meal plus Federal Doughnuts is right next door!"], ["Yash M.", "This place has the potential to be one of the hottest casual eateries in center city, but it does not live up to that potential. South Indian food is quite uncommon in the city, and this place could definitely have been the best dosa place around. However, I would have to say the dosa at some other Indian restaurants is significantly more fresh and tasty. The food at Chutney Co is innovative, but it seems like the kitchen is not executing these ideas too well. Dosas are too sour, and leathery. An order with goat cheese ended up having a few specks of goat cheese. I will continue to eat here since it is one of the few places serving dosas in the city, but if something new and better came up, I wouldn't end up going to the chutney co too much."], ["Veronica K.", "While the decor is dark and the music choices are a bit odd (Indian dubstep?) I can't complain too much about the food. For ten bucks you get a hefty meal, and this is a great place for a quick lunch. It's somewhere between a real restaurant and a take out place, so just be warned its not overly fancy or a good place for a formal date.I got the Mysore masala dosa and it was decent and very large, though I feel it could've used a bit more heat to it. The cilantro chutney was fabulous and my only gripe is that there wasn't a larger portion of it. However I did not care for their sambar, it was a bit too thick for my taste and also lacked the heat I was looking for. As far as I can tell, you don't get to pick your level of spiciness either. (I'm not sure if this is something you can even choose for a dosa, so pardon my ignorance if it's really only found with one certain taste.)The old school type of dosa was decent, but \u00a0I get the feeling the true stars are the build your own kind. Hopefully I'll get to try that soon. Not the best South Indian food I've ever had, but not bad."], ["Rahul M.", "The place is not that expensive but as far as the food goes, it has been disappointing each of the 4 times I've been here."], ["Kevin P.", "Meh. The dosas are below average. I think that if a place specializes in dosas, they should be better than this.

With all of the other good restaurants in that area, I don't see a reason to go back here when I'm in Center City."], ["Himanshu S.", "I am giving this place five star reviews for three reasons - value for money, good customer service and creative menu. Where on the earth do you get a good combination of veg chicken (soy) and dosa! The collection of chutneys is impressive, with my favorite being mango and curry chutney. They also stock the great Indian cola - thumbs up which is a must have!!! Their Besan Ladoos (which they should make more often) are the best! I like their Masala chai. They have recently expanded their menu to include value meals like Dal tadka, chicken etc.. They are in the process of adding newer stuff. I wish the young energetic staff all the best, and I hope yelp customers have an awesome time here."], ["Aria S.", "I would give them a 3.5 (Yelp! When are you going to let us give half stars??)As a South Indian, I was raised eating dosas on the reg so naturally, I'm going to be more critical of PCC. -Innovative creations! Choose from fillings like avocado & arugula.-Can also choose traditional fillings like potato masala (potatoes/onions with spices)-$10 to fill you right up and comes with sambar (a soup to dip your dosa in) and a chutney (a dipping sauce)Tips for the chef---The sambar needs more salt, and I think they should offer to make it more spicy if you want-The chutneys need some work. I love coconut chutney but this one wasn't strong enough. The tomato one was too tomato-y. And the mango one was like a lassi! I would recommend trying this place since there are no South Indian places in Philly & it's something new for the adventurous eater!

I was greeted kindly when I walked in, and the gentleman behind the counter seemed perfectly happy to be there.The food: Really tasty. I've had dosas many times before, and these stand up to them all. A perfectly crispy lentil crepe, filled with perfectly spiced potatoes and that madras spice. Mmmm...really quite excellent.A few times my mango lassi has been forgotten in my order, so that's a bummer.

Try the mango chutney - I could eat it with a spoon!"], ["Ammara K.", "Best papdi chaat around.. The much talked about dosas were not that good though. The outer crust of the dosa was not crisp which I expected it to be, although I am not a regular dosa eating person so I don't know if it is like that for every dosa."], ["Katie K.", "I take this place as it is- a chipotle style South Indian place. Meaning it's not the most authentic, but it's quick, cheap, and good. The dosa are very filling. It's a win-lose on the chutneys. The coconut one is weak in flavor, but the cilantro one is very good though. The sambar they are served with is very salty on its own, but it good to dip the dosa itself into. Overall it's somewhere I like to come to when I need a quick filling meal."], ["Mohana B.", "This place is a disgrace for chutney. All the chutneys are frozen and it's definitely not fresh. If you are trying Indian food for the first time \u00a0- please don't start here. South Indian food tastes nothing like that they serve. It's their own version and it was very disappointing. We ordered masala Dosa - Potato was uncooked, Idly - it was like brick and Kati Roll - Chicken was cold. Dessert -was old. The only thing edible was \u00a0madras coffee."], ["Luba P.", "First time trying Indian food and pretty good! I tried the Chicken masala which was really flavorful and not too spicy with huge pieces of chicken, I just wish there was less rice but maybe more salad instead. Everyone else got the crepe wraps with different combo of chicken w/avo or the veg w/portabello. Both were OK, but I'm confused why the crepes are so huge and all of the stuffing is in the center so the edges are just dry and empty. Maybe you have to fold it or break off the edges to dip in the sauces? Not sure. The free soup was super bleh. The service was pretty fast and not too packed for lunch. Overall OK experience!"], ["Rachel A.", "I am a vegan and this is my fav dish in philly: veggie chicken dosa with avocado tomato arugula and I substitute mushrooms instead of cheese.

Then, you get your choice of chutney w/ some seasonal varieties! I think I tried the strawberry one, which was too sweet and not flavorful / powerful enough for my dosas. I remember the mango one tasting really good.The first time I went, I had the real chicken dosa, but I tasted a friend's and quickly realized that the mock chicken is so much more flavorful! So, I got that the second time and will continue to get it in the future! Yum!This place is veg friendly!

I came across this place with all the good reviews and had to give it a try. I decide to go traditional and ordered a Dosa with spicy potato filling. I would say a dosa is an Indian version of a crepe. The filling was pretty spicy, and sort of like mashed potatoes. It was pretty good, but not really as amazing as I hoped.My friend got a dosa with chicken and jack cheese. His looked better than mine. I assumed the more traditional dosa would be better, but maybe not. We both got the cilantro chutney, which was very good.Seating here was limited, but it was not crowded (about 4pm on a Saturday). The only weird thing was there was a homeless guy sort of peering in most of the time we were there.I would maybe go back here if I worked in the area for a filling and reasonably priced lunch.

This Indian buffet restaurant has a good variety of foods, from the typical curries and paneer, to the tandoor chicken and naan (and salads too, if you are looking for something light or trying to make yourself feel better after eating all the other rich foods). You can't really go wrong with any of the dishes there, they are all rich and satisfying and you will want to go back for seconds, thirds and even fourths. The best part, in my opinion, is the mango juice! It's sweet and complements the savory Indian dishes. What's more, Sitar is a BYO, and the mango juice is a perfect mixer to whatever you decide to bring! Since it is a buffet, the service isn't that great - basically self service and sometimes you have to wave the server over so that they will bring your plates away and clear room for your next round of food.Tip: students get 10% discount! This makes the ~$11 dinner deal even better and worth your money."], ["Sheila D.", "In my opinion, the best Indian buffet in University City - and there are quite a few.

The biggest plus for Sitar is its CONSISTENCY. Sitar's buffet has a pretty wide selection for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians with tasty curries, rice and snack items that are reproducibly great in taste, and very affordable.As I mentioned in my tip previously - I make my own yummy samosa chat using the samosa, chutneys, chole (chick pea) masala and raita (yogurt sauce). :) Among the sides/curries, my favorites are the palak paneer, baingan (egg plant), aloo matar (potatoes n peas) and the mild yet flavorful dal. The chai (at lunch) or juice (at dinner) is an added bonus, love them both although I do wish their tea were less sugary. I like their fruit custard and rice pudding for desserts, surprisingly they do not contain artificial coloring/flavoring agents added in many other places.The service is good, the staff doesn't come across as friendly but do their job efficiently cleaning up empty dishes off the tables, given the tables are tiny and you need more space to fit every round of buffet items ;)"], ["Omnom N.", "I'm Indian and a student.And therefore, this place's lunch buffet is the best in terms of how much you pay (with student discount of course!) and what you get.Granted their buffet items remain the same - and you might get bored of it.

Just right! Worth the $8-9 fare alone.Saag Paneer was great as well. I can eat that stuff for days. The Samosas were perfect!They also had something I've never seen before. I can't remember what it was called but it looked like a Samosa except it was not stuffed with anything. Tasted like a zeppoli. Just fried, sweet dough. Very good desert.

The place was packed when were got there--that's a good sign, I think. With 3 good Indian buffets in close proximity, being busy is generally predictive of good things to come. We were seated at the last available table and headed up to the buffet, which had a nice array of options, including vegetarian and meat options. My favorite is the chicken tikka masala over jasmine rice with nan. I also love the saag paneer here. Unlike New Dehli where they serve a dessert, the desserts here are on the buffet. The good part about that is that you can fill every remaining free square inch of stomach real estate with awesome rice pudding (made with raisins and cardamom pods). The servers are pleasant enough and efficient at clearing plates. The one thing they could do better is to keep water glasses full, but that is minor. I also like that you can go up to the front to pay and everyone can pay individually for their food.
