After seeing that it made Philly Mag's top 50 restaurant, we were excited to try this restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. But the excitement ended very quickly. Love it: ricotta ravioli - I'll give them this much, the ravioli was wonderfully fluffy and was dressed well with pickled red onions.Leave it: the service! \u00a0It was horrendous, get ready for this rant.After we were offered 3 measly pieces of bread, I asked for more bread and the waiter said she had to check in back to see if they had enough to spare for the rest of the night. She didn't even come back with an answer! Really? you may not have enough bread??Although the idea of an BYOB is appealing, how about the waiters offer to open the wine? or after opening the wine, offer to pour some for your guests? It took her 30 min to return with champagne flutes. As dessert was being brought out, I had to ask the waitress (from across the room) for some coffee. As I asked for my coffee, my other friend had to ask for one too. How about you walk back to the table and ask if anyone would care for some coffee? For those who did not get a cup of coffee, consider yourself lucky - instant at its finest. Overall, the atmosphere is sweet and cozy. The bathroom was disgusting and the service even worse. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The 2nd star was only given for the wonderful ravioli appetitzer and apple tart dessert. I am officially calling in a formal complaint today. They need to work on their hospitality."], ["Erica S.", "Horrendous service. My husband and I Took our Dads there for Father's Day today. Its BYOB, we had our bottles on the table but we had to ask for glasses for the champagne then again for wine. The waiter literally was no where to be seen after he took our order at 1:15. We saw him again at 2:15 when they brought our lunch- which was when we had to ask for wine glasses. He never came out to ask if we needed anything. He only came out to drop off the check, not asking if anyone wanted coffee order dessert. The food was good but not extraordinary and certaily not worth having to tolerate the poor service. It was empty, only 1 other table, which made the bad service even more inexcusable."], ["Kristina C.", "Russet offered a one night Paleo \"cook out\" menu which a group of 6 of us went to enjoy. I had never been to Russet before and was really surprised at how great it was. The place itself is kind of an easy place to walk by and Inside doesn't seat many people, it looks like a converted house so you feel like your at a friends house dining almost. The service and staff was very accommodating and seemed to all work together and the thing I loved is that an no time did I every feel rushed...this really was a great dining experience. During this dinner we had this prefix menu...oh and its BYOB! Round One~~ Beef Heart with heirloom tomatoes, hot pepper and basil. Now I admit I was skeptical of this as I have never had heart before... but wow was it amazing! The flavor was a little like teriyaki and cooked perfectly.Round Two~~ Scallop and Tuscan sausage spiedino with smokey eggplant puree, roasted cauliflower and green coriander. This course was also delicious, we weren't sure how the eggplant puree would turn out but the entire dish and flavors worked together wonderfully. Round Three~~ Whole roasted beef with grilled summer veggies and salsa verde. It's had to really pick a favorite but I think if I absolutely had to that this beef dish might be my favorite. It was so unbelievably tender and juicy and tasty...I mean my mouth is watering just thinking about this. Dessert~~ Summer stone fruits. The only part that we weren't too much a fan of was the fruit in \"foam\" which the fruit wasn't ripe enough and didn't have much flavor...however it kind of felt intentional.

Instead they gave us the same burnt biscuits but flipped them over! Who does this? Did you think we wouldn't notice? I immediately noticed this and declined to eat the food. A manager never presented themselves to the table to address this. After asking our server (who was a pleasure) a woman (who served us the burnt biscuits, then same burnt biscuits but flipped over) stated she was the manager, and told us the biscuits were removed from the order, in a very \"we helped you out, be thankful\" kind of way.

I'm going to start packing spoons in my purse. This time it was bothersome because our dishes had sauces and I really like a bit of the sauce with my pasta, meat or fish.

My wife and I met some friends in the city and ended up going to Russet for dinner. We were looking for a fresh farm to table restaurant, and this was a gem!

I love everything that the restaurant stands for. The ambiance definitely gets an A+ in my books. Stunning lighting, awesome coloring...the place is definitely on the smaller side, but it adds to the charm. Love the naturey and rustic feel. Kind of autumny too, which always puts me in a good mood.I ordered the SWEET CORN RAVIOLI, EGGPLANT PARM, and ALMOND NECTARINE CAKE for my three courses. My favorite was definitely the sweet corn ravioli. So rich and tasty in a creamy white sauce. The eggplant parm was cooked well, and I liked the smoky quality about it. The skin was left on the eggplant, which I liked. The sauce and cheese to top it all off were both also great. The cake was only so-so. A pretty standard cake with some plate art. Nothing to rave about.2/3 stellar dishes from the restaurant week menu. I liked how they had vegetarian options for all three courses (+1).

It was busy! Still, we should have seen the intimations then, at the very beginning. Only after the meal, did we see: Russet is one of those high-minded places that neglects the value of service. We felt they really did not care about our patronage at all. After we were seated, we waited another ten minutes for our server. When he arrived, we expected the normal experience: maybe he'd open our wine, pour our water. Nope. With an unopened bottle of wine and two empty water glasses before us, he asked us, first thing, \"What do you want to eat?\" It was only then that I had the feeling: this is going to be a bad experience. The prix fixe menu looked good, so we ordered soup, gnocchi, and rib eye steaks.Only after we ordered, did he open the wine. We poured, which I suppose is fine at a BYOB. But we also poured our own water for the entire night. I can do that at home.The soup arrived after twenty minutes. It was cold. \u00a0After speaking with the manager (I had no idea she was the manager; we spoke to her three times before), we sent the soup back. The new soup come back nice and hot, with an appealing mix of apples and raw red onions on top. Unfortunately, the soup finished with a raw red onion taste--a little overpowering. The second course, butternut squash \"gnocchi\", came out in one orange pan seared lump. I had never seen gnocchi like that before. It was full of this mushy, pasty, squash mixture. Honestly, it was terrible, the furthest thing from a gnocchi. I don't usually say this about restaurant food: but it really was straight-out terrible. Thank God we had wine. The final course, rib eye with roasted root vegetables, was cut from a prime rib--not a steak, seared and cooked to order. OK. I had expected a seared steak. You live, you learn. Anyway, I like fat and flavor. This is why I ordered a rib-eye. This rib eye was way too fatty, hardly edible. The root vegetable were somehow undercooked and burnt. Didn't know that was possible. \u00a0I took a few bites and stopped eating. A piece of what Russet calls \"bread\" came with the steak. \u00a0It was some sort of puff: burnt, hard-as-rock.We took dessert to go. After another conversation, the manager agreed to take 20% OFF the bill. I had the feeling she hated me. Honestly, ask my friends: I'm a pretty amiable guy. I hardly ever complain. I've written a review--or anything remotely like this--let alone a bad review. \u00a0I wish we would have left after the soup. It was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. Only after I told my Russet-friendly friend this story, did he say, \"You know what? I didn't really like that place too much either.\" He was confusing the place with Pumpkin."], ["Regan A.", "We joined friends for dinner on a Friday night. Overall the restaurant was good. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and very efficient.My one gripe with the food was the lamb- internationally I have always been told that lamb is served medium rare for best taste.

I tried beef heart for the first time which was pretty cool (for those of you who aren't that adventurous they didn't have other weird things on the menu but beef heart looks like think bacon and tasted amazing). The main menu was a lot of fish and I didn't really see any other meat so I'm not sure I would go back unless the menu switched up (I don't like fish) It's also byob which is always a win in my book and there's a store where you can buy cold beer right next door."], ["Crystal W.", "I'm not sure what happened. \u00a0I heard such good reviews from friends, and they always seem to have a good crowd. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9 and I made a reservation for dinner here for Valentine's day. \u00a0I think at most places you can expect slightly better service on Valentines day since they have more expensive pre-set menus, and they expect more tips. \u00a0It took the hostesses (3 of them, standing 3 feet away, facing us), a full minute or two before even acknowledging that we had walked in. And not to take us to a table, but to ask us to wait longer, so that they could finish their seating plans for the night (we were probably the first dinner seating time at 5:30pm, and arrived on time). \u00a0Granted, a minute is not a long time, but when you're just standing there in front of them and they don't even say \"hello\", it's kind of a long awkward minute. \u00a0Bad start already.We disliked the food so much, that for the entree, we actually stopped a waiter to ask if it had been cooked properly (the \"gnocchi\" entree was a gigantic looking single gnocchi, and was a raw batter consistency when you cut into it. We were worried it wasn't done). \u00a0Disliking the food could be due to our more pedestrian palettes (we're definitely not professional foodies), but we've been to tons of restaurants in philly, from hole in the wall bars, to Starr and Garces restaurants, and have never experienced anything quite as awful as this.Out of our 3 course meal, the waiter only stopped to ask us if we were \"doing ok\" once, during the entree course. \u00a0Dessert was the only course we actually ate willingly. Even then, nothing amazing.We went to iHop the following night, and my fianc\u00e9 and i both agreed we wished we'd gone to iHop instead of Russett for Valentine's day.

They change the menu frequently, so be ready for some surprises, but my meal was delicious!"], ["Shauna G.", "So for me, any restaurant that has a seasonal menu and sources their food from local farms starts out at at least four stars in my book. \u00a0That's not always easy to do and I admire chefs and restaurant owners who avoid short cuts and make this a priority. \u00a0That being said, there were a couple of things about Russet that almost, ALMOST make me want to give it three stars. \u00a0The first - slow service. \u00a0The staff is very nice, but also very inattentive. \u00a0We sat at our table for a good long time staring at our waiting-to-be-corked bottles of wine before anyone ever paid attention to us. \u00a0Getting in the way of me and wine on a Friday night is never a good way to start a dining experience.The second - One order of our table's ice cream came out as what was basically ice cream soup. \u00a0It was delicious, but it was soupscream, not ice cream.So our meal was bookended with two not so positive experiences, but it was Restaurant Week, so I cut them some slack. \u00a0Outside of that, everyone loved what they ordered. \u00a0The stars of the evening seemed to be the garlic ravioli, bull's blood beet sformato, loch fyne salmon (with a special yum for the oyster mushrooms that accompanied it) and the blueberry ice cream.Russet, you're so close to being one of Philly's best BYOs. \u00a0So close. \u00a0I like your style though, so I'll come back if the opportunity presents itself."], ["L H.", "Awful, just awful. Let me preface this review by saying I've been here before - twice, in fact although both visits were over a year ago. Maybe ownership or chefs have changed since...? Regardless, these previous meals were both enjoyable. Which is why when my girlfriend booked a large party of 14 this past Saturday for her 30th birthday dinner, I was amenable to going and actually looking forward to the meal (as opposed to if we were going to several other BYOB restaurants in the area popular for booking oversized dinner parties, which are all admittedly subpar - think La Viola). From the start, everything was off. They had us jammed in an overcrowded, overheated back room with two other parties both greater than 10 people each. There was one (repeat, one) waiter for the entire room servicing more than thirty people. Not surprisingly, service was extremely disjointed throughout the meal as the one waiter was running the show solo. The appetizers were average and probably the best part of the meal, food wise - the gnocchi had nice flavor from the ragu however had a soggy/mushy consistency. The house cured pancetta served atop a radicchio/apple salad was far too salty (the radicchio salad was enjoyable though.) People who ordered the roasted cauliflower w/ kale salad seems to enjoy it although I didn't try it. Everything quickly went downhill after the appetizers. Most people on my side of the table ordered the duck -- 5/6 plates appeared to be sliced nicely and cooked appropriately to medium rare. My plate however was raw. So raw in fact that I had to send it back. Without apology or surprise, the waiter whisked my plate away, then within moments reappeared with the same duck I sent away, this time mottled in color (a distinctly unappetizing purplish-grey hue with intermittent raw bits) and curling on the ends of each slice. I am fairly certain they microwaved my plate. I attempted to eat said microwaved duck, and found the texture so fibrous and unappetizing that I took two bites and stopped. Since I was there for my friend's birthday and not on my own accord, it was less upsetting than it would've been for a regular meal. For dessert, I had called the restaurant earlier that day to let them know this was a birthday dinner and if they could please send out a dessert with a candle for our friend it would be much appreciated. I was assured this would not be a problem. We subsequently all order desserts for ourselves at the end of the meal. My friend's dessert comes out, no candle. We try to subtly take the waiter aside and tell him it is her birthday and we had asked for a candle. As quickly and unapologetically as he had dealt with my duck, he henceforth came back to the table with something just as unappetizing and ridiculous - a bread plate with two skinny candles stuck on the plate. Without dessert. Please refer to posted picture. Horrified, we sang a half hearted happy birthday, then quickly went to find the manager/owner/someone to blame for this absurdity. Whoever I spoke to seemed unphased by this story (which is almost as alarming), however a few minutes later came to the table and told me all of our desserts would be comp'ed for the inconvenience. Nice gesture but really can't believe that happened. A bread plate with two candles in lieu of a simple dessert with a candle. Summary: please don't come here with a large group for a celebratory dinner. They are clearly incapable of handling this type of volume and either become so overwhelmed that simple details/instructions get lost in translation or they just don't care about delivering quality service and food. Either way, you'll walk away feeling unsatisfied (and hungry)."], ["Abby I.", "I really wanted to like Russet after reading the good reviews, however, service was terrible and food was good but not excellent.I came to Russet on a Sunday night for Philadelphia Restaurant Week. I was seated immediately and there were only 2 other tables of 2 inside of the restaurant at that time. The table they gave us for a party of 3 was tiny. The third person in our party had dropped us off because it was hard to find parking. When he arrived, no greeting, no questioning of what he'd like to drink but instead, waitstaff walking back and forth for a good 10 minutes until a waiter who had never communicated with us asked if we were ready to order. I thought it was a little rude but at this point in time, we had waited for so long for someone to acknowledge us that we immediately ordered.We tried one of each item on the appetizers and entrees list for restaurant week and 3/4 desserts being offered. After the appetizers came, the empty plates sat there for awhile before being collected and entrees took about an hour later to arrive.

Russet is a BYO (Points! Points!) so you can bring a bottle of wine and enjoy a quiet dinner without the ridiculous markup that you get at regular restaurants. What's neat about Russet is that it is locally sourced, organic, and farm-to-table. They have a seasonal menu that they rotate, and though it can be frustrating to know that your favorite dish will be leaving soon (cue single crocodile tear), the prospect of trying new things is also exciting. I went for dinner, and I had the lancaster pork chop with creamy polenta and cannellini beans. It was delicious, and they were lovely enough to box it for me when I couldn't finish it. (Yes, it was just as good the next day.)My date had the aged duck breast, which came with stuffed swiss chard. I'm a huge swiss chard fan, so I approved immensely. Duck is also one of those things that can be hard to do well, and Russet performed admirably. I want to return for brunch. The ambiance of Russet is lovely. It's small, cozy, with wooden tables and dim lighting to give the place a rustic, local feel. The seating is a bit close, but all the better to lean in and have a good conversation with your dinner partner."], ["Danielle T.", "I ate here about 10 months ago and again 2 months ago but just joined yelp and had to comment on this GEM.

The bread to start was very bland, just like store-bought mini slices of whole wheat bread, slightly warmed. Butter was good though! Nice and spreadable. First course: fruit salad was so mustard seedy it overwhelmed every other flavor. Beef tongue was pretty decent, nice sauce to accompany it. Second: the gnocchi was unlike anything I've ever had. Instead of small pieces it was one huge potato latke-looking mushball. The inside was basically just raw liquidy batter, like bisquick before you drop it into the griddle. I fllagged down the waiter to ask if this was how it was supposed be served as no one had checked on us up to this point. It was exactly what they had intended it to be evidently. Gf's duck with noodle dish was good I thought, though she thought it was mostly stewed cabbage. Main: Ribeye was fairly tasty, but I had to basically tear it using my fork and knife since cutting through a fatty cut of meat like that with a butter knife is impossible. Couple next to me had the same problem. Other dish was a vegetable pot pie, and we can't even describe the flavor. \u00a0Despite being a menagerie of veggies, it somehow just tasted like nothing discernible, and not enjoyable. Dessert: chocolate cake was good, but very basic. Basically a molten cake with no lava. Pear tart was pretty good. And unfortunately for my gf, I can't stop farthing very loudly (not smelly somehow though!!). Never really happened before. Hopefully no updates will be necessary."], ["Michelle C.", "After hearing so many great things about Russet, I happily accompanied my boyfriend to his media dinner invitation last week. The restaurant was larger than I expected, and tables were spaced comfortably. The dining room is very pretty. We brought a bottle of crisp white to go along with the menu that evening. The menu changes often according to what local ingredients are available. The house-cured lonza was brought out for us to start our meal, and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best cured meats I've tasted, with hardly any fat (my preference) and matched perfectly with some greens. It was a great start to our meal, and when our neighbors heard us raving, they ordered it for their table as well. Next up for me was a cuttlefish ink pasta that was totally different from anything I've had before. The pasta was very nice and all the ingredients in the dish went well together. My dining partner enjoyed his mortadella ravioli. \u00a0My entree was unfortunately my least favorite dish. I went with the scallops, which were presented beautifully with roasted cauliflower, snap peas and crisp bacon, all in a buttery broth. I'm somewhat particular about scallops - I prefer a heavier sear. These were seared very lightly and were quite big, so the texture was a little too soft for me. Also, though all the components tasted very fresh, they didn't wow me all together. The duck entree across the table had nice, hearty flavors.Desserts at Russet should not be missed. We sampled the mint chocolate ice cream, the strawberry mille-feuille and a thick chocolate and caramel torte with flecks of sea salt. The latter two were my favorites but all three were delicious in their own right. \u00a0Russet is definitely worth a visit and it's a welcome addition to the growing BYO scene in Philly."], ["Christina D.", "We were very excited to visit this restaurant, but were disappointed with the slow service. \u00a0For an early evening seating, there were only a few other tables. \u00a0Had 4 courses with significant lulls before, between and after all courses: each time was 15 - 20 minutes of us staring at our dirty dishes, napkins on the table, cutlery turned away as if that wasn't enough of a hint. \u00a0No one explained the slow service or checked on us.When food arrived, it was okay, but what we will remember was the final 20 minutes with glasses and plates empty just waiting to get our check and pay. \u00a0Spent more time waiting than actually eating and drinking, so left disappointed."], ["Emily W.", "5 stars for the food.1 for the service. Totally absent waitress. Not just not attentive, but she disappeared for 20 minutes after she filled our water, reappeared to take our order, and then only reappeared to deliver the check. Someone else delivered our food.But the food was soooo good, I can hope the waitress was having a bad day, forgive the service, and round up....a lot.My fam came here for brunch, and we were also licking our plates clean. I ordered the \u00a0breakfast panino of the morning and found it bursting with flavor. It hit all of the brunch high notes- salty, a little sweet, totally umami-y, but not greasy. The egg oozed a gorgeous yellow-orange when I bit into it, and I was in heaven. The cheesy grits were creamy and rich enough to share amongst \u00a0the 5 of us for just a few tastes each. My family always orders dessert, so we ordered the tart of the day, a semifreddo, and another dish whose identity escapes me. There were no leftovers.I appreciate the seasonal approach of this place, but even more so, I appreciate the quality of execution of each dish.

Not an extensive menu but the options were a good mix of seafood, poultry, pasta and meats.

The service was excellent as well! Will return for sure!"], ["Kathleen K.", "I was really impressed by this delicious little BYOB. Its got a very cozy atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in someone's house (mostly because I believe it was previously a house... ha). I felt like I was in an episode of Portlandia, in a very good way. When I asked about one of the dishes, the manager told me \"well that's a very special dish for us because the corn comes from \u00a0(blank) farms and we then dry it ourselves and grind it in house to make the corn meal\". \u00a0And when we asked about a meal with duck in it, we got a similar response to where I almost expected to hear the name of the particular duck in question.It was great to be eating at a restaurant where they were really passionate about their ingredients and where they came from. I won't go into specifics on the meal since their menu changes daily and I'd hate to make you salivate over something you can't get anymore. But I will say, we enjoyed every course. It's not an inexpensive place, but we were there to celebrate and it was a wonderful place to do so."], ["Micayla B.", "Russet is one of my all-time fav restaurants in Philly. The food is always of wonderful quality, prepared with love, and frequently switched-up depending on what's fresh. It's a great place for an intimate dinner between lovers, friends, or family. The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because of the noise level. It is often hard to hear one another speak- which is surprising since it's such a small space.

By the end of the evening, we did too. As she searched fruitlessly for our reservation (the one a perky young thing named Emma called the day before to remind us about) the hostess glowered as if she suspected we were trying to trick them into giving us a free meal to tide us over until our Social Security checks arrived. When she finally found it, she offered us a table in the doorway, and when we declined, seated everyone in sight before stashing us us in the back where every server slammed into the back of my husband's chair. After greeting us with \"Can I help you guys?\" our waiter never said another word, other than the obligatory, \"everything OK?\" He brought our water then stood next to our table like a six-foot tall ficus tree, apparently expecting us to pipe up our orders on our own. Since there were five appetizers and three entrees to choose from it didn't take long. And the appetizers came out right away--they were plopped on the table along with the bread. They were nothing special. \u00a0I'm not sure why the menu made a point of enumerating every component of my pasta appetizer when everything was slopped in the bowl together so you couldn't tell the slow-roasted tomatoes from the garlic confit. After that, it took forty minutes for the main dish to arrive. Again, nothing special. Fish was fine and sat on a bed of tasty vegetables. Some were warm and others were stone cold, which made for an odd experience. I'm not sure why we ordered dessert--maybe I wanted the full monty, since I pretty much knew by then that I was never coming back. The lemon panna cotta was the best thing I ate all evening, but took so long to come out that we were almost late for our concert. I thought that eating so close to the Kimmel would be a plus, but Russet has too many minuses to even consider an encore."], ["Michelle L.", "Atmosphere: 5/5 Has a quaint, rustic feel which I really liked. Came here with 6 friends close to 9pm on a Thursday night so even though the restaurant is pretty small, it wasn't crowded at all. Would definitely recommend it for a date or something intimate.Food: 5/5 Ordered the beef leg which was HUGE. I was not expecting the portion to be so large, especially looking at my friends' dishes around me (they all ordered either the Artic char or the bass) which were all considerably smaller. My beef was a bit dry (could've used some sauce or something) but was otherwise good. Also tried my friend's bass which was really delicious - I liked it more than my beef. We also ordered three desserts to share (chocolate budino, coconut tart, and apple feuille cake) - all of them were incredibly yummy. So 5 stars for food!Service: 5/5 Good, no complaintsPrice: 3/5 The only thing I'd give a less than perfect rating on.

I've heard quiet rumors about Russet over the past few months but absolutely not enough to be as blown away as I was with my meal and dining experience. I'll start by saying that this place was adorable. It's nestled in the living/dining room of beautiful townhouse with high high ceilings and simple/inviting decor. Next, all of the menu items are based off of the ingredients the chef gets that week...which leads to a constant changing menu with the freshest of ingredients.On to the food...The appetizer winner had to be the chestnut pappardelle with guinea hen ragu. The pasta was paper thin and melt in your mouth. We later learned from the chef that not only did he use these native chestnuts mixed into the dish but he made his own chestnut flour to make the pasta. Talk about impressive. Not to mention, he shared the most incredible story with our table about how these chestnuts came from a 150 year old american tree which is very rare of chestnut trees. This story just made me love the restaurant even more. \u00a0The main course winner was the goose leg confit. I had never had goose before and I am quite certain that I will never have it any better than at Russet. It was cozy and rich without being too heavy. I loved every part of this dish including the spaetzle served underneath. I can not wait to get back to Russet. I know the dishes I loved so much won't be there, but I am absolutely looking forward to trying a new creation on the menu that week. One more thing, it's BYOB so make sure to bring one of your favorite wines and enjoy!"], ["Charles W.", "The restaurant is inside an old residence. \u00a0We were there for brunch on a Saturday and there was not much of a crowd. \u00a0If you go during dinner hours, I suspect that carrying on a conversation would be difficult with the tables packed in. \u00a0Our server was very attentive. \u00a0We had the omelet and pancake and we were very happy with our food and the prices were very reasonable. \u00a0I would recommend you stop in."], ["Aaliyah P.", "Russet way more than just potatoes. I'm perplexed by Russet, and you can continue to read to find out why.Ive dined here on two occasions , once for brunch and once for a not so memorable restaurant week experience. Dinner- The service, atmosphere,first courses and dessert were fitting for a restaurant of Russets caliber. The mains left me and my group wanting more. I started with a beet salad and ricotta cheese that was to die for. The semi sweet beets and creamy ricotta worked so well together. My entree was a mis communication on my part. Full Disclosure I dislike salmon a lot , unless its smoked and on a bagel with cream cheese. So when the trout style fish arrived to my table and tasted like salmon i was sad. Our server rectified the situation immediately and offered to let me substitute the vegetarian options. A potato terrine, which was good just a few too many Russets.My other dining companions \u00a0all did the pork shoulder and some got more meat that others. I know pork shoulder is on the fattier side but one of the girls literally cut off two pieces of meat and the remaining amount of the shoulder was fat. She decided to not send it back since we had reached our quotas of complaints. Luckily we all shared and no one went too hungry. Dessert made me smile again.Brunch -As a group we ordered various things including the Normandy style crepe( bacon on the side) ,croque Monsieur , ginger bread pancakes and the loma platter. Everything was amazingly good and i couldn't have asked for a better experience. Service was up to par and since were a pretty rowdy bunch i was glad our server wasn't a judger.The gingerbread pancakes came out piping hot with a large dollop of marscapone cheese and a few pear halves. There was syrup but just a tad I usually prefer my pancakes to be less sweet anyway. They were fluffy, and had a great amount of ginger flavor. I would for sure order this dish again.The Normandy style crepe was my favorite of the things i tried. A rich buttery crepe filled with saut\u00e9ed onions, apples and a square of taleggio cheese. All of the flavors worked so well together and it was in the words of Christian L \"an explosion in my mouth\" It was satisfying both in size and flavor. We wrapped up our meal with the coffee ice cream sundae and 5 spoons.I think brunch won me back over and I will for sure make Russet another to do list for dinner. The service has always been stellar and they are a BYOB. Check them out for brunch for sure you wont be disappointed."], ["Megan S.", "Ah, I want to love Russet but I just can't. I went there tonight and while the food was delicious, the service was horrible! There ere two of us and we shared a 1st course and each ordered a 2nd course. All there dishes were excellent! Here's the bad news, our 'server' (although I'm not exactly sure who that was) didn't greet us, didn't clear our plates and when he presented the desert menu, didn't return for over 30 minutes. The inside in cute and the atmosphere is sweet, but he passed by our table SEVERAL times without a peep. Hello, we actually wanted to order desert. By the time the hostess of all people came by to ask if we wanted desert, we decided to leave and walk to capaggiro. Huge disappointment. I was just talking to a colleague about how even when you get bad service, you tip 20% and it doesn't give any signal that they need to improve. So, I decided to leave a 6% tip which was reflective of the service received.

With a menu that changes everyday, you may not know what's for dinner but you can count on it being fantastically delicious, fresh and creative.

Five appetizers, four main courses, and five desserts were offered on this particular night. From the scallops to the beet ravioli to gnocchi to the lighter-than-air dressing on the salad there was nothing to complain about and everything to rave over. We spent at least a half hour slowly savouring each bite. Sadly (because we couldn't sample each other's plates), all 3 of us ordered the duck. Having eaten and rejected duck around the world, we were hopeful that, based on the first course, the duck would be fairly tasty. Our expectations were blown away. Perfectly cooked duck on a bed of heavenly vegetables had us nearly moaning with joy. And then there was dessert. We each ordered something different, again with sampling in mind. The chocolate mousse was light, rich, deeply chocolate without being bitter. The sesame shortbread was topped with a light flan type of sweet. Marvelous was the first description, exotic, enchanting, and may I have more followed. The cheesecake with oranges and Gran Marnier was ordered by the non-cheesecake eater of our group. \u00a0She was none too keen to share. \"Sex on a spoon\" was the only way to describe this dessert. We splurged and tried the peach sorbet (lovely, light, fresh) and the spicy chocolate ice cream. As fans of chocolate and chilis we were amazed. The spice came as an afterglow to the rich chocolate and that is no easy feat.The worst we could say was that the cookie on the top of the peach sorbet was the least tasty thing we ate all night and that was merely great. The best we could say is that there was no clear 'winner' as every dish was prepared and served with quality and class.

Even the take on Mexican flavors was more mild and subtle than I would have expected. That being said, the flavors were well-balanced, and the food was beautifully presented (although the pyramid of rice that accompanied my entree made me ask myself, \"did I forget my shoulder pads?\")I went with the mushroom flan (reminded me of a mushroom pate that I made at home once, although much richer) and the rest of the party all went with the corn bisque. For our entrees, there was a the venison (a giant, manly hunk of meat) and the red fish, that was beautiful to look at, but not as flavorful as one would hope. My duck breast was pretty good (I love duck, and it's wrapped in bacon, so it's got that going for it), but the caramelized shallots inside the breast, that I was so much looking forward to, were underwhelming. The desert menu is extensive, so save room if you can. We filled up the space that we had left with the Mexican brownie.

Blatant examples of this included us having to ask if there were any specials, to which we received 3 word answers--whereas the table next to us got mouth-watering descriptions of each of the nights' offerings (including at least 2 that were not event mentioned to us).After placing our order, we never saw our server again--or at least did not have an opportunity to speak to her (since we saw her at other tables throughout the small establishment). Our meals were delivered by food runner or the like and no \"how is everything\" was even attempted. Overall--I would rate it a C- of an experience.

The portion on the salad was generous.I had a 12 oz New York strip in a red wine reduction. \u00a0The chef recommends medium rare, and I heartily second that. \u00a0This dish is fantastic. \u00a0My date had the salmon glazed with hoisin and chipotle, which was also a really great choice. \u00a0Any dish will likely be of high quality.Bottom Line: I can almost taste my food again by just writing this. \u00a0Bella Vista BYO offers delicious food with one of the city's best \"bang for your buck\" deals. \u00a0Get here soon."], ["Lilly R.", "This restaurant is absolutely a must go to. \u00a0Great service and the chef is incredible. \u00a0Definitely do the mushroom flan."], ["Jenny T.", "Are you looking for a place where the food is soo good it blows your mind?!

This place is a great spot for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. \u00a0The noise level is low and you can hear each other speak. Which is great! The servers are very attentive, and patience. I had the best crab meat at Paloma. We ordered the crab Castillo, \u00a0wow it was amazingly good. I wish we would have ordered two! For entr\u00e9es I had the chili relleno, \u00a0the best one I've had EVER! It wasnt over cooked and the puff pastry on the outside gave it a really nice touch. The medley of flavors and veggies inside the relleno were so good it was like opening a present! My guy ordered the branzino which he let me try and I was totally blown away on how delicious it was. Lastly dessert, \u00a0I ordered the Mexican brownie. It was sooooo good and warm I wanted MORE. \u00a0It was paired with a gelato which I was not crazy about. It had a strong taste of amaretto and I hate amaretto. Next time I'll ask for the Mexican vanilla. \u00a0We also tried the sorbets, I was told the the strawberry habanero was pretty epic! It was cold and sizzling hot at the same time. I didn't try it, \u00a0too spicy for my liking. \u00a0Paloma is a byob so we brought tequila with us. I'm not big on tequila but my margarita was really good. It was the perfect balance of tequila and sour mix. The pastry chef is the wife of the owner/chef, what a friendly, warm, welcoming lady!!

It was a very upscale atmosphere, and not cozy and intimate like the BYOBs that I'm used to. The staff was very nice and service was well done, but the bus boy(?) was a bit odd. No big deal there though.As others mentioned, the sour cream \"butter\" that is brought out with the bread is different and fantastic. We had the crab salad appetizer which wasn't amazing but no complaints. My boyfriend had the rack of boar special and that was really good and it came with a great risotto side . I had the duck which was surprisingly dry and unexciting. My duck also came with some sort of veggie rice side dish which was rather bland.For dessert we got the orange cranberry bread pudding with vanilla cinnamon gelato. It was good as well but not outstanding.The thing I found most odd was that we were originally looking for a reservation for 4 and couldn't get one until 8:30. When our friends weren't able to make it, we were able to get a table at 7. Throughout our whole meal, the place was practically empty on a Saturday night.

Heck we were SITTING at a four top table."], ["Grant B.", "Delicious and incredible flavor combinations. \u00a0We had the red cactus soup special and the \u00a0tuna tartar special as appetizers.

We went with a group of six and were blown away by how fantastic the food was. As others have noted, this place is not nearly as full and hyped-up as it deserves to be, in part b/c they aren't part of the mega-restaurant marketing machine and b/c they are a bit out of the way. The good part of that is that you can enjoy unhurried service and attention, easy reservations, and it's actually possible to hear the other people at your table. I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant. The service was so professional, friendly, and knowledgable. We brought three bottles of red wine and the waiter (perhaps also an owner or manager?) examined each one, and recommended an order and pairing. \u00a0He then walked us through the menu and the specials, patiently answering all of our questions. And then the best part - the food! The tuna ceviche was outstanding and the Ensalsa Conchita was refreshing and delicious. The best, however, was the Fettucini Tres Colores. So yummy. For entrees we had the wild sea bass, the dover sole, and the branzino. Every dish was perfectly balanced, sophisticated, and super flavorful. There aren't a ton of meat options - only rack of lamb - and only 6 entrees (plus specials), but it's clear that someone has really thought through this menu and the ingredients, and is making sure that each dish is well-executed. For dessert we all shared several sorbets (the mamey is awesome!), the biscotti, and two of the pound cakes (banana walnut was my favorite), which were absolutely delicious.

It's too bad things didn't taste as good as they sounded.The Margharetia salad sounds like an amazing blend of flavors, but it was very bland with almost no taste at all. The Caesar was way to eggy tasting. I love Caesar salads and while the presentation was nice, the dressing was so heavy that it was too heavy and didn't have a good blend of ingrediants to it.The Talapia was very fluffy, not sure how they did that, but \u00a0it was tasty and fresh..The duck was also good, and came with a nice rice pyramid.Tried the sorbets, and the trio we picked were all good, but the Mango Haberno and the coconut-lime were the best.The staff was pleasant and while the presentations are very nice the food itself could use more flavoring. This is the second Mexican restaurant I've been to in the past couple months that really disappointed with seasonings. Maybe they try to keep in the middle of the road to appeal to everyone. It's BYO, no corkage, and they take all plastic. Parking is street, which in the Italian Market area can be problamatic.

We didn't leave undo-the-belt-buckle stuffed, but we left very satisfied and excited to see what they will do to their menu for the fall.Favorites: Chilled corn soup- bursting with flavors of summer and the crispy quinoa took it to a whole new level...not to mention the tender lobster nugget. Roasted Maitake/ Hen of the Woods- there's a reason this thing has been on their menu for so long.Beef with Escargot- beef was perfectly cooked, although greedy us wished the portion could have been a little bigger. The little lobster mushroom bites were much appreciated.Chocolate Bouchon- After my first bite, I stopped talking to my boyfriend and became totally absorbed in this totally awesome dessert. One of my favorite chocolate desserts in the city.Banana Pot de Creme- they got the texture of this spot on. I'm thinking I'll have to learn how to make this to get my boyfriend to eat more bananas...The octopus and dorade were nice tasting dishes, but just didn't stand out like the rest. And I love octopus so I had pretty high expectations. The portion was just a little small and a little too sweet. The dorade was cooked nicely, but the sauce could have used a little zing from some acid. I also had some really salty bites of radish and pepper.Overall, a delicious and fun experience!"], ["Beth S.", "Had an unexpected free night a few weeks ago and decided to check out Will BYOB. It's a shame I'm just now getting around to writing a review, but I couldn't go without giving props where props are due! We did not have reservations but called ahead, and they were able to accommodate us immediately. The person on the phone was very friendly. We dined on a Sunday night (perhaps that's why they had room for us), and they offered a pre-fixe menu.The service was great, and they obviously worked well together as a team. It's always nice to see that. They were knowledgeable about the menu items, and explained the pre-fixe menu very clearly. Attentive without being overbearing. My boyfriend guzzles water, and we didn't have to wait for more. They were great about pouring our wine, and made sure to keep us both at an even pace (we don't necessarily care about this, but some people are crazy about that so it's nice to see they make the effort to do so!).We both got different items for each course and shared so that we could taste more things. We also opted to add the tasting pasta course, which was delicious just like everything else. Highly recommend adding this course, it didn't put us over the edge. All of the portions were just the right size and the flavors worked together very well. The chilled soup was perhaps my favorite. Presentation was gorgeous for each dish. Dessert was divine.There was no price listed on the menu (except the supplements), or at least none that we noticed, but it turned out to be very affordable! A great little gem we stumbled upon.

Just in time for fall, we went for the pumpkin tasting menu! Every dish that came out was beautifully plated, tasted delicious, and wasn't redundant in flavors or taste. The tiny restaurant is BYOB, yet wasn't uncomfortably cramped. Personally, I loved the appetizer with pumpkin, apple foam (I am pro foam everything), as well as the consumme with mushroom. Quail stuffed with pumpkin stuffing, and kampachi sashimi in a stone bowl with some pumpkin seeds and asian pear, cut out in little stars.

It is as nuanced and inventive as any in the city. I hope to go back many times. The service at Will was the only slight blemish on our evening.. We dined on a busy night, so it's perfectly understandable that there would be a level of hustle. Unfortunately, our waitress rattled through intros without taking a breathe, barely paused to let us ask questions, was incomprehensible during presentation of the dishes, asked us about the food before we could take a bite, and forgot an entire course.

And there is nowhere to wait, so try not to go early for your reservation, especially if it's freezing outside. I did not have this problem, however I feel like it could make some people chilly. Needless to say, super cozy, but not ridiculously close tables. The service was very prompt, casual and helpful-we were both opting for pescetarian dishes and got great recommendations. Honestly, the menu is very short, about 5 options for small places, 5 options for mains, and 1 or 2 specials. I liked my dishes but wasn't blown away by them. The escargot dish didn't have enough actual snail. Maybe 3 total. \u00a0In the world of upscale BYOBs in Philadelphia, I would probably pick somewhere else to return to before returning to Will. Don't get me wrong, this food was excellent, but honestly this review stems from the level of competition out there."], ["Leve S.", "This restaurant offers great food prepared and presented with exquisite technique. Unfortunately, the dishes I tried just did not work for me. They involved too many ingredients that did not all blend well as if someone put a lot of notes on a music sheet but did not manage to create harmony. I visited this place twice. Once I had the Foie gras/rabbit terrine. \u00a0The rabbit terrine was great and the presentation was beautiful but my taste buds were overwhelmed. I had shaved celery, some spicy green leaf I can no longer recall, rhubarb pickle, another pickle made of something else, sweet coconut puree, sweet hazelnut preserve, thinly sliced beets, and plums on my plate, and I am sure I forgot to list something. While everything was done really well, this combination somehow reminded me of my wife's meals before we leave for a holiday: everything from the fridge must be used up!Another time I got a dish that had a tiny piece of lamb steak wrapped in lamb sausage placed on a bed of lamb stew. All of them were superbly done. \u00a0Any of them would have been grand on their own in a larger portion so that I could have enjoyed them longer. The three presented together like this were just crying for some lamb schnitzel to complete the list of all possible ways lamb can be made.The staff was great both times. I did not like the pretentious ways of our waitress, though, and how she started walking away as I was trying to make up my mind about what kind of water I wanted. I know, simple question, but waiting staff should, well, just wait. I think the ambiance is nice for an intimate dinner or a night out for a group. If you dine with someone to whom you are not that close, however, you may find yourself uncomfortably squeezed between them and the wall."], ["Sara N.", "Great find!A modern take on french flavors.

Very good service and an atmosphere that isn't at all unfriendly to someone dining alone. My only real complaint is that the by-the-glass wine prices are fairly outrageous. Fortunately, bottles are much more reasonable (many about the same as two glasses) and you can take them up to your room to enjoy later."], ["Dave G.", "In the depths of a cold, gray winter, one can find refuge at the Meridiene's hotel bar and restaurant, Amuse. The hotel is chic place, done in a mod-hippster style, but without the snobbishness. You enter through a pair of pink, vertically zebra-striped doors into the bar. Reception for the hotel is tucked around to the left. Your first thought is, \"Now THIS is hospitality.\" They offer a good selection of premium liquors and beers. Their cocktail list is terrific. I had a Boulevardier (for the bourbon lover) and and their Amuse Old Fashioned. Wonderful. For snacks, the sweet potato croquettes were delicious. You should not leave without trying the pretzel bites. They are served with a butter-mustard sauce that has an addictive ingredient in it. A note on the service. Efficient. Friendly.

Neither the food or the service lived up to the billing of a top restaurant. The staff was courteous, but clearly undermanned for a Saturday night crowd.

Amuse is a French restaurant and beautifully integrated with the hotel almost as an extension of the lobby. We were able to sit close to the large windows which provided snowy scenes of townhall. I liked the food at Amuse a lot actually. I would give 3.5 stars if I could. Here are the reasons. The food was really good. The bread and butter as terrific - the bread crusty and soft and the butter salted slightly. The \"amuse bouche\" was an oyster with pineapple that was fresh, creamy and had a nice citrus kick. Our mains were the lobster bouillabaise which was fantastic - the soupy sauce was wonderful and the shellfish were saturated with it. I had the artic char which was also excellent and included some terrifically prepared and crunchy how choy. The \"ok\" of the meal was the charcuterie and cheese plate - which was tasty but we weren't told what was on it - which is a miss in my book especially at a french restaurant. The desert of homemade ice cream and ricotta cheese came we ordered were also just OK. I loved the butterfinger - but the cheesecake was crumbly and bland. The wines by the glass were also just OK - would have liked more French wines-how about a Bordeaux? Lastly the price was pretty hefty. I think that's OK for a french restaurant but you can get as good or better for less in New York so maybe I'm a little biased. Overall i did like Amuse and would go again but would like to see the changes I mentioned."], ["Randy G.", "Rather having lunch from the conference buffet, I thought I would abandon that ship and sail off on Amuse. This single experience at Amuse made me want to go back and try everything.After placing my order, the server starts me off with their Chef's Welcome Palate Cleanser, sliced radish with supposedly salted butter. They could have saved this and would have received a five-star rating on the sandwich. This was a disappointment. I don't believe it offered any kind of cleanser. Presentation was nice, but it was just a raw radish slice with unsalted butter. Yikes.The Pulled Pork Sandwich gets five star, no questions asked. The pork is deliciously marinated and extremely tender, served on a brioche bun. It doesn't have any of those fried onion strips that other places use to add texture. They use house made giardinera vegetables that are in a vinegar marinade. \u00a0These vegetables alone make the pork and the whole sandwich sing. You'll take a bite and you'll get the perfect marriage of vinegar crunch from the vegetables to the bbq tender pork. Seriously, I wish this sandwich could come in a foot long version, I would eat the whole thing.The sandwich is served with Pommes Frites. Although presented attractively and spiced adequately, they were a bit soggy. Either they sat in the back, it wasn't cooked to order, or under cooked, they didn't have a nice crunchy outside. Too bad, after the sandwich, I had extremely high hopes for everything else."], ["Lisa G.", "Love this place in a race with le Cheri atmosphere a 10 food is splendid. Went for restaurant week two in a row perfect"], ["Alexis J.", "The food here is AMAZING! Period. I'm not sure you'll score better steak-frites anywhere else in Philly. Did I mention that the food was amazing??!! I went here a few days ago for Restaurant Week and this place definitely lives up to the hype. The meal was great from start to finish. I ordered one 1063 cocktail, which lasted me the whole meal (that signals a good (i.e strong) cocktail, which is always a plus!) The amuse bouche that accompanied it was a chicken cordon bleu salad & it was simply divine! \u00a0I had the sunchoke & apple bisque for appetizer. It was creamy and satisfying and went fabulously with the bread they have there. I had the steak-frites for my entr\u00e9e. This was perfection! I don't think I've ever tasted a french fry that good in my life. Seriously, if it's your first time here, ORDER THE STEAK-FRITES. You will not be disappointed. For dessert, I ordered the nashi pear crisp. It was a little sweet for my tastes, but the cr\u00e8me that accompanied it offset it so nicely that I ate nearly all of it even though I was stuffed! One thing that I appreciated about this place is that they make sure that you leave FULL.Throughout our meal, the servers brought us complimentary items and accompaniments, which I believe were also from the RW menu. (An additional appetizer of the winter greens salad, and an additional dessert- the chocolate pate tray w/the only pistachio ice cream I've ever liked!). The service here was good as well. My friend thought her drink too strong and sent it back for a remake, but still didn't like it. She then ordered a white wine, and the server gave her a larger pour than normal. Those are the types of things I like to see when I go out. Bottom line, you can't go wrong eating here. I'll certainly be back."], ["Naim M.", "Came here for date night w/ my wife. First impression, it's small! It was a Friday at 7 and there was basically no one there, though bar had a few people. Server wasn't particularly personable if you care for such things.The drinks were strong, they didn't skimp on alcohol. I had the duet of lamb, it was cooked perfectly, could break with fork and portion was just right. My wife had the beef tenderloin, medium well, it too was cooked perfect, good flavor and portion, the side of brussel sprouts were very good as well. I like light crowds so I'd go again but overall not special."], ["Monica S.", "Ate here last week with my husband. The lobster salad was great! \u00a0The reason for 2 stars-service was not friendly. Our waiter seemed to rush us and took my martini that was only 65% finished. He didn't even bother to ask if I was done with my drink. He also never refilled our water glasses. We had to ask for more water after one glass was completely empty. I didn't expect this lack of service at a nicer establishment. I really enjoyed the food but got a bad taste in my mouth due to the poor quality service."], ["Hoang T.", "very nice restaurant in a hotel.. usually hotel restaurants aren't anything to write about, but i had a nice time. had a deal/coupon for amuse and went on a Wed night with reservations. The restaurant itself is small, but definitely not cramped. The view is pretty awesome too, city hall at nighttime isn't that bad to look at! The interior design was very nice, modern, clean lines, with some dark wood. the menu i thought was missing some key french dishes...escargot and rabbit being something i look for at french places. They did serve an amuse bouche which was duck and lingonberry. good flavor. the bread and butter were good. the drink i ordered, \"With Love\" was a decent cocktail. We ordered the scallops for appetizer. 3 decent sized scallops, cooked nicely. I liked the carrot puree, but the cashew for the texture (crunch) was a miss for me. I thought it should've been fried/crispy onions or even something generic like crispy bacon bits. But overall, the app was good, everyone in the dining area seemed be ordering it. Entres, I ordered the rack of lamb, my date had the lobster bouillabaisse. The lamb was cooked nicely, medium rare on the rare side, just the way you should be eating it. The lamb came with beans and some roasted vegetables. I didn't think they were anything special and almost had one note in flavor. I would probably order the dish again because I did honestly enjoy it. I guess i was expecting some crazy pops of flavor restaurants seem to be trying to infuse in their menus...but this was a good dish to me. I tasted some of the bouillabaisse. I know it should be salty, but this dish was absurdly salty, even for me (i like salt). The proteins were cooked nicely, but i think the sauce was reduced/concentrated way too much. I think it was a HUGE oversight on the chef/line cook. They just needed to taste it before they plated it. If they seen it was salty just add some stock to it to thin out the salt flavor and everything would be ok. I saw another diner order the bouillabaisse and saw that they did not dive into the dish. The service was OK for a Wednesday night. I think there was one main waiter with 2 runners. The waiter was attentive as possible and social, but he was juggling 7 tables. Putting our order in did take time, but this is \"French Dining\"... long dinners. In our American standards, the wait time to order would be almost \u00a0considered \"unacceptable\". Overall, i liked the meal. Expect Steven Starr prices. I'd go back for a special occasion."], ["Kurt W.", "Great food horrible service. \u00a0Perhaps it was that I ate at the bar but the girl working at 8 pm on 4/10 was horrible. \u00a0She had a couple people there she knew and spent more time chatting them up then doing her job. \u00a0I'd give the short ribs I ordered 5 stars and the service 1 star"], ["Eva C.", "The food was very, very good. Crab and lobster salad was perfection. Big pieces of lobster and delicious crab meat with crunchy crostini alongside. Spinach salad was fresh and bright. Succulent Scallops were seared beautifully and served with a delicious pur\u00e9e of celeriac and crunchy veggies. The steak frites was delicious. The mixed berry Napoleon was light, fresh and a perfect ending to our meal. Everything was cooked well. The ambiance is quiet and romantic with an awesome view of Philly city hall. Only down was our waiter who rushed from table to table--there were two waiters for about 7 tables--the rushing around took away from the experience, but he was perfectly pleasant and service was fine.

Meh... Since it was Restaurant Week, we got to choose from a few items for a three course menu. \u00a0I started off with a tomato and fresh mozzarella salad with basil crystals. \u00a0You have to see this salad to believe it. \u00a0I will upload a picture, but you have to realize the plate was dinner entree size. \u00a0It was loaded with lots of tomatoes and a HUGE ball of fresh mozzarella. \u00a0The basil crystals were sweet, crunchy, and full of basil flavor that of course complimented the tomatoes and cheese. \u00a0Some of the tomatoes were better than others though. \u00a0I appreciate the big portion size, but the big ball of cheese was a little overwhelming after I got through half the salad. It was about the size of what you'd buy when you buy the mozzarella in water at a store...so about 6 to 8 ounces. \u00a0No one person should probably eat all that in one sitting. \u00a0Tasty, but I was full after my first course! \u00a0I think this dish would be much better to share with a few people. \u00a0I also would have preferred the cheese to have been cut into smaller pieces or smaller balls of mozzarella used instead. \u00a0After my first course, I decided to order another cocktail because the first one was so good. \u00a0I got the, \"With Love,\" which had my favorite vodka, Kettle One, with ginger, passion fruit, and champagne. \u00a0It was fizzy, slightly sweet, and garnished with a raspberry. \u00a0It was just as good or even better than the first cocktail.My main course was scallops, and I'm glad my appetizer was large because this portion was a little on the small side. \u00a0I wasn't that surprised though because that's usually how it goes when you order scallops. \u00a0I got three and I wasn't a fan of the meyer lemon sauce. \u00a0It was a little bitter. \u00a0The scallops had a little grit in a few of the bites, and that was really disappointing and a big turn off. \u00a0My husband did enjoy his fish though.The last course was the reason I'd chosen to go to Amuse for Restaurant Week. \u00a0I got the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e \u00a0because it said it was \"with lavender.\" Well, I made the mistake of amusing there was lavender in it, which I have loved ever since eating lots of lavender based sweets in Hokkaido, Japan. \u00a0However, it was just a garnish. \u00a0I guess it would have just said \"lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" if it was lavender flavored. \u00a0Oops.. Anyway, it doesn't matter because it was actually really made well and the top was nice and crispy and the custard was set correctly. \u00a0It was one of the better cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es I've had. \u00a0Good stuff! \u00a0The pretty little dark chocolate mints that the server brought at the end of the meal were also a nice touch.So, I'm confused about how to rate this place because the atmosphere is lovely, but the first two courses weren't great, but I loved my cocktails and dessert. \u00a0I think I will come back for happy hour or sweets, but with so many other places in the city, I don't think I'll rush back here to dinner any time soon."], ["Brian M.", "Dined here for Restaurant Week which we took the same way we do Sips; slightly off the beaten path choice where it's not overcrowded, you get a good value for the deal, and try somewhere you might not go otherwise.

What a choice that turned out to be. Our party turned up at the appointed hour and were promptly seated. The ambiance is cozy brownstone that is not over-decorated. The kitchen is small and open. We started with charcuterie and Moules Frites, both were perfectly prepared and served in ample portions. The highlight for me was the duck liver pate which was velvety and delicious. On to the entrees. What really shined was the quality of the meat and fish used in the simple but elegant preparations. The venison was like a fine fillet of beef but smoother and perfectly. Crusted with coffee and accompanied by tasty brussel sprouts. The duck was another winner, a large breast perfectly cooked with a sweet/savory jus. The sea bream was delicate fresh, presented on a bed of French lentils. At this point I thought the best part of the meal was over but we had some Sauternes to drink so we ordered four of the desserts and a French press of coffee. All the treats were incredible but I felt the standouts were the brandied cherry cake with pistachio ice cream and the apple frangipane tart. The cherry cake was crispy on the outside and delicate on the inside balanced by the smooth nutty pistachio ice cream was delightful where as the tart was fresh and apple-y with a tender crust filled with semi-sweet almond paste. The duck egg creme brulee was a wonder of richness that was not overburdened with sweetness. The sweet treats we balanced by the strong yet smooth carafe of French press coffee. Total bill around $150 for 4 which seemed quite fair but don't forget that they are cash only. Based on our experience, \u00a0I can't recommend the Pickled Heron highly enough.

I was in the area for another function so we decided to eat dinner. I had heard rave reviews from locals in the area, but was none-the-less disappointed. Food: App: Mussels with fries - delicious and definitely a good app to share. The portion for this appetizer seemed ridiculous when we got our mains. It's very filling and could be a meal on its own. Me: Quail with mushroom (and foie gras?) risotto - The risotto was rich and nice but didn't make up for the dry and flavorless quail, which was rather messy and difficult to eat. Her: Grilled steak with some greens and what I believe was a yam pave drenched in truffle oil. Compared to the mussel app, this dish was absurdly proportioned. There were four bite size pieces of delicious steak done perfectly next to a gigantic slab of yam pave. My sister polished off the steak and greens, but barely touched the pave which filled up half the plate. I like truffle oil as much as the next person, but this was overwhelming. One thing to note is that unless you can find a very recent menu before visiting, it is likely that the menu in the restaurant will be different. They change the offerings frequently, and none of the dishes I had been hoping to try were actually on the menu.Service: Our waiter started out great at 6:30pm, we were one of two tables eating. Nice and observant, maybe a little too much. By 7:15, a few more tables had come in with larger groups and he couldn't handle the rush. We had finished our meal and were staring around us, it was too loud to have a decent conversation without shouting, but the waiter wouldn't stop by for another 15min to bring us the dessert menu. It took him another 15min to come around before we could tell him we didn't want dessert, and just wanted to leave. Final notes: The food is hit or miss and so is the service.

We forgot our wine, and they very quietly poured us a couple glasses from their own stock. The bread and homemade butter to start wet my bill. Then came the mussels... oh my the mussels! I honestly have never had them prepared better. They melted in my mouth, just enough sauce, and the flavor was incredible.We had plate after plate of fantastic dishes. The highlight for me was the lamb. It was prepared just rare enough. The last time I tasted lamb so fresh, was when I ate a freshly slaughtered one. No lie... For me, a good peice of lamb is better than any cow steak.We finished with dessert that was just enough to fill my giant belly. The right amount of sweetness combined with bitter rich dark chocolate.This meal was filled with multiple foodgasms."], ["Chris S.", "Great dinner, nice atmosphere.

Wife has french onion soup and a crepe with kalamata olives, goat cheese, tomatoes, and eggs. Both were wonderful. For a treat we split a crepe with bananas, nutella and hazlenut ice cream.Everything was wonderful.

I also loved the cheese sampling with fruit appetizer. The appetizer was served with 3 types of cheeses and as well with sliced up pear, apple, strawberries and grapes.

The service here was also friendly, when they forgot to add the egg to his crepe, they came back and give him 2 eggs instead of 1!After coming here, I'm more open to trying savory crepes.

Yikes! We spent more money on a few morning beverages than we did on food. \u00a0This was certainly our doing, and not any fault of the restaurant, but still a shock and hit to the wallet!Everything that we ate was wonderful though I felt like it was slightly over-priced. \u00a0If you plan on going to Creperie Beau Monde, expect to pay the premium, or abstain from alcohol during your meal and then head to any other establishment in the neighborhood with some more reasonably priced beverages!"], ["Farha A.", "This place is A-okay! The crepes are good/yummy and the atmosphere is enjoyable but, in my humble opinion, the food is highly over priced.I've had many delicious crepes for less than $10 and these were comparable in quality (if not a tad bit dry) for over $15 for even just 1-2 ingredients depending on what you got.Also I went on a day that was 90+ degrees outside and it felt really hot inside the restaurant I'm not sure if they had air conditioning or not but if so it was set pretty low and the heat might have dampened my experience. The crepe i got was carmalized tomato and smoked salmon which was pretty good and a pretty big serving - I would definitely go back and have it again were it not so pricey.

But there was NO WAIT and there were even lots of outside tables available. I think maybe because it's the summer and a lot of people are on vacation? Don't know-- but that part was surprisingly nice. It's a little more expensive for a brunch place, with food averaging in the $18 and we shared a savory and a sweet crepe and coffee which ended up being $50 bucks. That being said, the food was very good. If you allow me to be snooty for like ten seconds here: we just came back from France and I have a new appreciation for french food/crepes in general. This place hits it on the head pretty well even with lots of duck options for the real Francophiles out there. A good place to take your parents if you want something a little more upscale.Little things also make me smile: the matching beautiful dinnerware, the cute ambiance in side, the umbrellas dutifully blocking the sun outside, the fun and sweet waitress...

Yes it's a little out of the way from University city. But you just can't beat sitting in a small, warm restaurant near the window, watching the snow fall, eating fluffy, rich and delicious crepes and sipping on cocktails to warm up after. Sound perfect? It was. My friend and I stumbled in here after getting caught in a little more snow than we expected. We ran to the restaurant and were so happy to be inside that we didn't notice that it was pretty packed on a Saturday. We asked the waitress for the wait for a party of 2 and she accommodated us in nearly no time at all! Thankful to just be inside from being so cold, this hospitality and great service made our great experience even better. Food: We decided on one sweet and one savory crepe. We made our own for both (I recommend this, considering how steep some of the prices are for the pre-made crepes). We got an egg, mushroom and mushroom sauce crepe and a nutella, strawberry and banana crepe. The egg, mushroom and mushroom sauce crepe was great -- the crepe was light, soft and the mushroom sauce pulled all the flavors together. The dessert crepe was even better, if that's possible. They added powdered sugar and a small swirl of whipped cream (flavored whip cream..what do you call that? it was almondy and delicious, whatever it was) to our plate, which was a nice addition. The crepe was softer than the savory crepe and the nutella amount was just enough -- melted perfectly with the warm bananas and strawberries. MMM definitely one of the best dessert crepes I've eaten. Tips: \u00a0+Come here on a cold day, get a table by the fire, eat and be merry and then go to the bar across the street and warm up with some wine :)"], ["Sonia S.", "I came here a few weeks ago with 2 friends for what I thought would be a casual Saturday morning brunch in the middle of a snow storm, spending over an hour and a half to get there, find parking, and trek through the snow. By the time we got there, it was close to an hour past our reservation time. The hostess was very accommodating and we were seated right away. I was surprised that it was so crowded on a snowy day like that, but now I understand why.... There is truly nothing that could have beat the winter blues than a warm sweet crepe and cappuccino in a cute little place like Creperie Beau Monde.The sweet crepes range from $10-15 while the savory ones are more expensive $15-25 depending on whether you are getting a crepe with meat or not. The sweet crepes are great for brunch or even a shareable desert, but the savory ones are definitely the better choice if you're looking for something more filling.If you're having trouble deciding between sweet or savory, I say GO FOR THE SWEET! I promise you will not regret it. I ordered the apples, toasted almonds, brown sugar, and caramel crepe with vanilla ice cream. It was literally like taking a bite out of heaven. I probably would not mind eating this for every meal every day for the rest of my life. You are making a big mistake if you leave here without trying this crepe! My roommate got the classic banana and nutella crepe with hazelnut ice cream... Sounds basic, I know, but it was anything but basic. The hazelnut ice cream so perfectly complements the warm bananas and nutella. Oh, and if you're wondering what chantilly is that comes with every crepe, it's like a very light, sweetened (but not overly sweet), whipped cream. I normally don't like whipped cream but this was good!My friend got the cappuccino (excellent!) and of course, I had to try the bloody mary. While it was good, not the best that I've had. While the search for the best bloody mary in the city continues.... this place is hands down the best creperie in the city I've been to."], ["Lindsay W.", "I really enjoyed our visit here. They are crepe experts and have a very large selection of different flavors/varieties. It can be a little overwhelming but in the end I chose a savory ham/egg crepe. It could have used a little bit of sauce but other than that I was satisfied. My husband got a crepe also and he really liked his.Overall, the decor is average and the service was average, but I would definitely return if I had a craving for crepes. I want to try a sweet crepe, maybe that's what my experience was lacking.

The other fillings were also sparse - the crepe was nearly flat when brought out.

Ten years later, they still have the best crepes I've had outside of France. Unfortunately they still also have the most inattentive service I've ever experienced...Beau Monde has a great selection of both sweet and savory crepes. I can never pick between the two, so I usually split one of each with a friend. Their buckwheat batter is unlike any other crepe place. They crisp it up really nicely and it has a nutty flavor that goes well with both sweet and savory fillings. There's a good amount of House Recommendations, but if you don't like any of those combinations, you can make your own, which is what I typically do. I'm a fan of their ratatouille filling, although it was a bit heavy on rosemary last time. The prices at Beau Monde ($10-$25 per crepe, depending on the types of ingredients) may seem high compared to other crepe trucks or small creperies, but the price is worth the quantity of food they serve. I can never finish my entire crepe because of how filling it is. I recently took two of my friends, who were visiting Philly, to brunch at Beau Monde. I was expecting a good hour wait given that it was prime brunch time on a Sunday, but to my surprise the restaurant was practically empty! My friends were very pleased with the food. The service, not so much. But what matters is, now, whenever they go to another creperie, they long for Beau Monde. During this last visit, I noticed that the interior at Beau Monde looks like a has-been. The once glamorous wallpaper, accented with gold hand-painted flowers, is fading; the velvet curtains are starting to look patchy. It feels like the owners have really let go.The crepes at Beau Monde definitely deserve 5 stars, but the service and the decor need a revamp desperately. I would recommend going here if you have a large group because the space is huge compared to many others in Philly, and apparently it's not popular as it once was."], ["Yun W.", "A cute spot for brunch. \u00a0Spacious interior and nice fenced-in outdoor seating. \u00a0We tried one of the seasonal crepe special with chicken, tomato, cheese (yelp.com/biz_photos/beau\u2026) \u00a0and a build-your-own smoked trout and leeks crepe - (yelp.com/biz_photos/beau\u2026).The service was generally friendly. \u00a0However the waitress seemed disappointed when I wanted to build my own smoked trout crepe instead of ordering one of the suggestions. \u00a0The savory suggested crepes run ~$20 per crepe, and build-your-own can be cheaper or more expensive depending on the ingredients. \u00a0Overall I thought the crepes were good but they were definitely kind of pricey for brunch given the amount of food."], ["Jacob A.", "We came here during a brunch crepe craze and boy did they deliver!We each had 1 crepe: I did the savory Chicken Fricasse while my date had the sweet Mixed Berry. \u00a0SO DELICIOUS! \u00a0 \u00a0The price was ~$15.00 for each crepe, but they were large enough to fill us both. \u00a0They have a wide range of sweet & savory crepes so the hardest part was feeling like we made the right decision with our choices. \u00a0This was an excellent meal, especially sitting outside on a beautiful day. \u00a0We will certainly be back to try more crepes on the menu!"]], "Pari Cafe Creperie": [["Maidhc v.", "Just now, I was about to have a friend meet me here because it sounded like a yummy place, \u00a0but when I got here, the guy behind the counter bellowed out to a customer \"Ma'am, I just want you to know that was rude of you...you're supposed to ASK.\" I'm not even gonna try this place and that guy needs to get fired. -To that very rude guy behind the counter: Way to make a first impression, a-hole!

I've also tried a couple of the sweet crepe varities (fred's special with cheesecake bites, the nutella and peanut butter with fruit one, etc.) and all have been extremely tasty. It would usually bother me to spend around $7 on a crepe, but the crepes here are GIANT and can easily be portioned into two separate meals. I love how thick the dough batter is (some people prefer thin and light crepes, but I love how almost tough the texture is) and I love how much they truly stuff the inside of the crepe with ingredients. The vegetables with feta cheese and olive oil crepe is flooded with mozzarella cheese and feta cheese, and it is loaded with vegetables. The servers do not skimp on the nutella or chocolate sauce for the sweet crepes either, which I love!TIP: Ask for whole wheat batter for your crepe! It tastes great and is slightly healthier than the normal!"], ["Ari B.", "This little set up in the basement of Houston Hall has exceptional and well-priced fare.

The portion sizes are massive so you'll always have some to enjoy later. All the savory crepes come with some vegetables as well. The crepe itself was soft and chewy, although it quickly becomes inundated, but not soggy, with the sauce of the filling.

All of the savory crepes come with a very large helping of vegetables and meat, so you're sure not to go hungry afterwards. I've tried almost all of the savory crepes here, and the only dish I didn't really enjoy was the one that contained lamb and greek yogurt. The whole dish was entirely too dry, and there wasn't enough yogurt to balance the dish out. All of the other savory crepes here are fantastic though, and if you want recommendations, try the Chicken Pesto, the Buffalo Chicken, or the Meatball crepe.I don't usually get the sweet crepes here because I normally don't eat dessert, but I've tried them before and they're pretty good if you have a sweet tooth.The only thing that I don't really like about this creperie is the actual crepe itself. It seems a lot thicker than the other crepes I've had, and it's dryer and chewier than I would like it to be. This is kind of understandable though because they need the crepe to be strong enough to withstand the sheer amount of vegetables, sauce, and meat they stuff into each one.The employees working here are very nice and efficient, although one of the cooks is incredibly talkative. It's nice sometimes to talk to him while you're waiting for your crepe, but it can also get kind of annoying when all you're interested in is getting your crepe and getting on with your day.Overall, fantastic place to fill your stomach if you're looking for a hearty and savory crepe."], ["Sarah S.", "Had the lamb gyro crepe, it was very big and quite good."], ["Jim P.", "This place has been one of my favorite places to eat in Philly for over 10 years, since back when they were still a tiny lunch truck. \u00a0Over the years they've kept the recipes the same, and added several more options.

They filled it with chicken, blue cheese, various vegetables, and I believe tomato sauce.

Service is really fast unless there is a huge line which has been a common sight if you go during the lunch hour. Also, you get to watch as your crepe is being made; and they are always generous with fillings almost to the point where there is too much and it becomes one gooey mess (I usually don't mind).

A honey-dijon chicken crepe and a small soda cost about $8.50, which, while not exorbitant, is not particularly cheap either. When I opened the to-go container, I was greeted by a sloppy mess, albeit a delicious mess. The crepe was monstrously large and overflowing with chicken, vegetables, and sauce. Literally, it would have been inedible had I not gotten a knife and fork. I ate about 1/3 of the crepe and was full -- it was seriously mammoth.

For a creperie that misspells Paris (what else is it supposed to be?) and which calls their mustard sauce Dijon (it's delicious but certainly no actual Dijon mustard), Pari Cafe doesn't surprise with a mere average crepe. Certainly the whole point of these crepes are the fillings, but I think a crepe should be able to stand for itself. I couldn't actually care less whether this is authentic or not - pancakes come in so many different shapes, and many of them are delicious. But this one would be inedible with just sugar and cinnamon - the batter is way too thick and the borders are still not crispy enough.- Overcooked chicken. Chicken breast is easy to overcook, I suppose, but if it wasn't for the vegetables and the sauces, I will have to wonder whether you can eat this without drinking any water.- Service is... okay."], ["Hank C.", "Sadly to say, this used to be a great food cart behind the Gimbel Gym.After they moved into the student union center, though, I've been less impressed with the quality. \u00a0The crepes are drier and the toppings inside have less sauce than before... although the sweet crepes are almost alike (aside from the dry crepes).Usually manage to get one of each of the savory and the sweet, and always ask for extra sauce. A bit more expensive now that they're settled (and no longer three eastern European guys running a cart).The honey Dijon chicken is probably the best savory, and my favorite sweet is strawberries, bananas and the ever-delicious nutella (so good, yet probably so bad for you! :P)."], ["Anh C.", "A creperie in a Houston hall of the University of Pennsylvania... How I came across it, I don't even recall but I'm so happy to have stumbled upon such a place. Hidden in the hall, Pari Creperie looks kind of dingy but it is so beyond the looks. There is a variety of sweet and savory crepes that you can choose from and all deliciously prepared. There is plenty of seating as well outside and parking is a block away and easy to find as well.I have continually returned here on many trips whenever friends have asked where they can enjoy a satisfying lunch that won't break the bank. A definite yes in my book."], ["Nicole L.", "Used to go here ALL the time when they were a Cart. The prices were good, the ingredients were fresh and plentiful,and the wait was totally worth it.Once they moved into the student center though... I dunno. Something was missing. It's not so much the service, it's not so much the food, it was just something intangible. Don't get me wrong. This place is still very good, as can be attested to by the long lines. However, when deciding between the many dining options around campus, getting a savory crepe was no longer was the default option. The honey dijon chicken is the most popular savory order, and be sure to get extra sauce because it's finger-lickin' good. Any sort of dessert crepe will be good since you can add your own ingredients."], ["Alex M.", "The best..I was a student at Penn, and I bought from them while they had a lunch truck on the outside..it was $4.75 for lunch - $3.75 for the crepe and $1 for the snapple..fast forward 10 years and raise the prices by 2, but it's all good..they still make the best crepes I ever had..never go cheap on you, never take shortcuts..the best!"], ["alexis g.", "Monday after class ritual: go to Creperie. \u00a0Order veggie crepe with feta. \u00a0Sit in comfy Houston Hall chair and eat veggie crepe while reading for Tuesday's class. \u00a0Ahhhh...By now the crepe guy (whose name I now vow to learn...) knows me and knows was I like to get, \"veggie with feta!\" \u00a0Bonus: if you get there before 11AM, there's a breakfast discount. \u00a0Yay!"], ["Faye S.", "I got a chicken tomato pesto crepe and it was WATERY and messy.

Huge portions, healthy (if you order right - or decadent if you order *really* right), and cheap. I like the vegetable omelette (around $6), which is exactly what it sounds like - a giant omelette made with fresh veggies tucked inside a crepe. Be forewarned that for some inexplicable reason there's always excess liquid in the omelette that makes the crepe soggy. I soak it up with a napkin before it can do too much damage. Clearly we're talking \"fine dining\" here."], ["Michael C.", "Massive selection of de-licious crepes.

Next was the amuse bouche, a truffled mushroom soup, which was divine...except for the piece of glass in one of the party's serving, much to our dismay. When Matthew was alerted go the issue, he immediately apologized and gave her a drink on the house.The escargot and salmon appetizers were excellent.

The calmars appetizer was pretty good - the piperade that the squid sat on was by far the best part of the meal. The lamb shank was...a decent braised shank. Tender and coming off the none, but not very flavorful. The biggest disappointment was the tarte tatin which, simple put, was not a tarte tatin. It had none the carmelizing that defines that delicacy - instead it was a small open topped apple pie, essential, with some cinnamon and some vanilla ice cream. Nearly pushed the rating to two stars - but we had an enjoyable \u00a0meal overall."], ["Jason S.", "Seriously hands down this was the best lunch experience I have ever had. I took advantage of Restaurant Week and decided to try the Bistro for lunch today. As others have said the location is a little strange, but once you're there you understand that you need to \"be in the know\" to know its there. it's quiet and secluded and has a beautiful view of the Schuylkill River, 30th Street Station and the Cira Center. I arrived at the end of lunch service and was shown to my seat. I dined by myself and took a seat at the bar overlooking the window. The drink I ordered, the French Waiter, was good. (Gin, St. Germain, and bitters). It was accompanied by three rolls with pesto and a glass of water. I ordered the Escargot, Artisan Salad, Saumon, and Chocolate Mousse for dessert. I have never had escargot before, but let me tell you, if you only order one thing of the menu, it has to be this. I savored every bite. They were buttery, moist, and delicious. The salad was awesome. It was light and had just the right amount of dressing. Just enough to tell you it was there. The diced apple and cheese paired well with the walnut pralines. The main course, Saumon, was served with a carrot puree, and pepper reduction. I loved how the saumon was wrapped in phyllo. It gave it a good texture and a bit of crunch. The Chocolate Mousse for dessert was very light and a perfect finish to the meal. I have never been overcome by a meal like I was at Bistro St. Tropez. Breathtaking is the best word I have to describe the food. I am planning on returning for dinner while I can still take advantage of Restaurant Week, but even after the promotion is complete, I bet I'll turn into one of the regulars here.

Yes I gander, I check out each and every plate that I can while being seated and with the very close knit tables, I do mean tight, it doesn't take much to admire the neighboring tables choices. They have two nice sized bars as well as two dining rooms, both allow you to take in the views. The service is spot on with team work, you are greeted immediately and drinks are asked for and brought promptly. Michael had coffee and exclaimed how good it was \u00a0and I ordered a bloody mary, if you like them hot and spicy, you'll love theirs! It was a bit too hot for my tastes and I followed each sip with a sip of water. Bread is a $1.95 charge but so worth it, delicious and dense sourdough rolls served with an amazing garlic and basil pesto sauce. As the food comes up in the kitchen it is immediately brought out to your table, so there is never a wait, if your server gets busy.I started with the saut\u00e9ed Burgundy escargot and wild mushrooms in a herb garlic butter and cream sauce, so many tender snails and freshly sauteed mushrooms and the sauce was incredible! I would return for this dish alone!I then had a bowl of the creamy wild mushroom soup, finely chopped mushrooms in an excellent creamy both It was well seasoned but missing that little dose of sherry? that is served at The Terrace Restaurant at Longwood Garden's, a mushroom soup that I will always use as comparison to the best I've had. It is still worthy indeed and I would order it again.For my main course, I went mini with an express lunch and had the Moules Marinieres with hand cut fries, well so much for mini, so many mussels, with halved cherry tomatoes, onions, garlic in an amazing broth and enough hand cut fries to share indeed. The mussels were hit and miss, so much flavor, but a few of them or more were shriveled and dry, not plump and tender like the rest, but I guess that can happen.Ha, what did Michael have? Well he had a huge omelet \u00a0saucisse and a nice sized side salad. The sausage inside was a smoked kielbasi and was accompanied by swiss chard and a sharp provolone cheese. The sausage was quite large, instead of slices or chunks and the omelet was dry and very brown on the outside. Some folks like their omelette's well done, I like mine cooked but I detest having my eggs browned and why I no longer order them out. He ate it all, but was not thrilled, which is too bad, because it certainly reads well on the menu, there is a fine line between an omelet that is done and one that is too well done.My experience was great, Michael left a little less satisfied than I. 3.65 stars."], ["Alyssa M.", "The view of the city is beautiful and the wait staff was friendly. \u00a0I went during restaurant week and the selection and portions were decent. \u00a0The food was good but it wasn't great."], ["Heather B.", "I returned for Mothers Day with my mom.

Sips places get notoriously crowded and the specials are usually pretty limited and uninspired.Cue Bistro St Tropez! The random, off-the-beaten-track location ensured it wasn't crowded at all; there were only about 5 or 6 people at the bar and a few scattered at tables. Getting there was really strange- you have to walk through this design mall and then hop in the elevator to the fourth floor, wander through the mall a bit more, and then you find yourself delving into this strange back corner and all of a sudden you're in the restaurant! Trust the signs, they will get you there.Once I met up with my BFF at the bar I was disappointed to learn they were all out of Newbold IPA (one of the big reasons I picked the place, because Sips beer selection usually sucks). It was replaced with Yuengling. Boo! Not even close to a 1 for 1 substitution on any level.Instead I opted for a blueberry cocktail, which isn't my usual style but it was only $4 and sounded not too sweet. It came a bit sweeter than I would have liked, but it was pretty tasty and VERY strong. The second one was even stronger and by the time we left I was 3 sheets to the wind. It was essentially a flavored-vodka martini with a small splash of juice. Two may have been excessive.Total damage for 4 drinks was only $18. You can't be serious. We'll be back for Sips again soon, that's for sure, but I doubt I would come here for any other reason."], ["Kelly A.", "My boyfriend and I had an awesome meal randomly one Saturday evening. We went in not knowing what to expect but absolutely loved the experience and will most definitely go back. We both got the 5-course tasting menu and chose the hanger steak as our entree.

I was very excited to try a new sport that had seemingly great reviews and it was a giant let down! First the location and decor: while I have been told not to judge a book by it's cover it's hard to get over the fact that it is in a furniture showcase. Not to mention the fact that once i walked in I felt like I was experiencing something out of a bad 90's movie! The decor and music was very Night at the Roxbury with neon lights leopard print booths and multi colored track lighting. I also spent the night freezing due to a hole in the window we were sitting near.Even still, I was willing to put that aside as I was anticipating a great meal. It was a prix fix menu as it was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I elected to have the chef selected wine pairing with each course. The amuse was a lobster pastry that was more like a frozen puff pastry with a microscopic piece of artificial lobster on top. As an appetizer I had the escargot and my boyfriend had the frois gras. The escargot were like rubber bands and the frois gras was more of a pate. It was a mushy square monstrosity. The entrees were perhaps the best of the evening, but it's easy to be the best when everything is so bad! My duck was drowning in so much sauce I thought it might sink! The cheese course was an absolute joke! Basically It was a slab of borsin garlic herb cheese with some poorly poached pears and stale melba toast. Our meal was so terrible that we were most looking forward to the wine as we thought that perhaps having a little buzz would help us forget how bad the food was. Again, we were wrong. As each glass came to the table i tasted more and more of a dish water taste. It was terrible! My boyfriend and I were in tears from laughing at how bad this place was!! The worst part of the night was getting the bill....that horrendous meal cost $200!!! We have paid much less for MUCH MUCH BETTER!!The only redeeming quality of this place was the service.

I mean, I like French food but I usually go to Parc for that. This place is really quaint, reminds me something out of old Paris, not that I've ever been to France but that's how I would picture those small mom and pop shops. The soups are always amazing, get one if you go, you will not be disappointed. The sandwiches are always freshly made to order and satisfying.

Don't mess up your order or \u00a0you will hear her in that tiny kitchen complaining but not directly to you. She just doesn't come off as friendly but her husband seems super nice. If this place is busy, forget it, you may not get a table for awhile but on warm days they do have outside seating.

I've only driven by it a thousand and one times in my life. It always appeared to me to be the type of place where you could get lost in a good book. The cafe is remarkably tiny and simple. If it is made out of flour, it is probably on the menu - bagels, baguettes with ham and brie, croissant, muffins, etc. Simple as it is, I quite enjoyed my ham and brie on a baguette. I don't know how you would make something so simple any better than to serve it on good, warm crusty bread with quality meat and cheese, which is exactly what Cafe Lutecia does. They also make an astonishingly good cafe au lait. I am not a coffee snob - if it tastes good to me, I will drink it. I thought the cafe au lait that I had was a creamy bit of heaven. Way better than most places that masquerade as \"coffee shops\". Don't come here to do your work, though. This is not Starbucks and you cannot spread out as if it is your own personal library. Also, it is a neighborhood place. Children will wander in and out on the hip of a parent and will jabber to the owners and you will look like a jerk if you scowl or complain. Meet a good friend or a new friend and catch up at a tiny table as if you are in Paris. Throw your New Year's resolution out the window and eat ham and brie and a croissant or even on a croissant. Cafe Lutecia is owned by an incredibly warm and friendly couple who are an integral part of the neighborhood. It is so nice to go to a place where you can interact and engage with other patrons and not be thought to be a loon or nosey.I only wish the chairs were slightly bigger.

When my sammy landed it was something I could have gotten at a Chestnut street lunch cart for $2.50. Really pedestrian amaroso's style roll, overdone eggs, no seasoning. Plus the eggs burned the roof of my mouth in the way that over-microwaved food usually does. Not saying it was microwaved but I have my suspicions. While I was eating a couple was sat next to me and given a list of specials, including a couple of really yummy sounding quiches. I was not worthy of receiving the sacred list of specials I guess.

I wish I was kidding when I say I have thought about this soup at least 3 times a week since tasting it a few weeks back.

I came in to buy a gift certificate for them for Christmas (yes, they do have gift certificates) and decided to treat myself to a hot lunch on such a cold day.I ordered the bisque on a whim, just hoping for something to warm me up, and a brie sandwich. The soup came out first and I tasted a spoonful while waiting for my sandwich, which I had every intention of dipping into the bisque. Um.. \u00a0I barely saved a quarter of the bowl in time for sandwich dipping, it was that good. The cafe is a definite local hangout, where people come to read the paper while grabbing a bite to eat. But there is no feeling of exclusivity. The staff was really laid back and good-natured and really made you feel at home.

I had heard about its authentic French cafe feel, which immediately made me think that I would not only not feel comfortable there but also that I would pay an exorbitant price for medicore-tasting but cute-looking pastries. Well, I was wrong. With lines too long at our other brunch staple, Ant's Pants, my boyfriend and I reluctantly ventured here. Let me just start by saying that I have mixed feelings about the place, but that overall, the place is worth going to (again and again). On the one hand, it seems like a real settled cafe with a strong local following. On the other hand, things sort of feel a lttle unsettled. The menus are just pieces of computer paper, the windows are a little dirty, and the place feels a little dingy with cheap tables and chairs. It's not that the place is dirty- it's just could use a good airing out and some decor changes. That said, the atmosphere was really chill with some people just enjoying their Sunday paper and other just catching up with friends. But about the food- because this is what makes me want to go back. It's simple food, but they do a great job at it. We ordered the tomato bisque to split, and it was some of the best tomato bisques that I've ever had. It was tomatoey but not overly acidic, it was creamy, but not heavy, and it was smooth, but had some natural tomato chunks to give it just a little bite. Most of the time, tomato soup tastes like pureed pasta sauce, but this was in an entire separate class on its own. Next time, I'll get my own bowl. I ordred a swiss cheese and tomato baguette- something that I have totally made for myself at home, but for some reason, this one just tasted better than my versions.The bread was yeasty and soft, and they have really mastered the timing of the melted cheese on toasted bread thing. My boyfriend loved his quiche, although i thought it strange that it came with such a brown and crusty top. I ordred a latte to go because I had heard good things about their coffee, but it was pretty awful. I probably should have asked for another one, but I was already out of the door and on my way home. It tasted like burnt coffee with lots of milk and that's always a little hard to stomach after a long night out.I'm anxious to try their pastries and even more anxious to make it there for lunch since I hear that they make some great sandwiches."], ["Christine B.", "I stopped in for a cup of coffee and a slice of quiche. \u00a0The coffee was only okay, but the quiche was amazing. \u00a0It had tomato, basil, and goat cheese in it. \u00a0I live around the corner, and will have to stop in more often."], ["David M.", "This is the definition of a neighborhood place. Not in the exclusive-y way that some dive bars can get, but in the down-home \"small town in a big city\" sort of way. When I left today (I was one of the last people to leave before closing), everyone in the restaurant - the waitress, the cook, the owner, the cashier guy/owner, even the two remaining customers - said goodbye. What the heck? I've been a few times over the past couple months, but I'd hardly call myself a regular. I wasn't even talking to anyone while I was there. It was like I was on Cheers or something. Again... in a really good, comfortable way.Anyway, this is the perfect place to sit, drink coffee and chat or read or whatever. Something about the layout and level of noise is just right, soothing with energy. The food itself is quite good. The quiche and the sandwiches seem priced just right. A quiche and a coffee is $7.50 (which includes tax, but doesn't include tip), and that feels pretty good.The food may not be as high-end as Parc or something, but then, you're paying a good several dollars less for it. I mention Parc because it's near by and presents an interesting contrast. The difference isn't necessarily in taste (they both taste great) but feel. Parc feels a bit more high-end... the ingredients taste more expensive, the atmosphere feels more chic, whereas this place tastes a little more homemade and feels way more down-home. I couldn't see myself meeting a casual acquaintance at Parc for a quick bite or settling in there to sip coffee alone and read the newspaper, whereas Cafe Lutecia feels tailor-made for life's little social transactions and moments.It's funny, when I started writing this review, I originally had it rated at four stars, but as I thought about it, I had to bump it up to five. Yeah, the food/price aspects are just good rather than excellent, but there's something about this place that makes me unbelievably happy. Whenever I go, it's always planned out in my mind at least a day in advance, and in that preceding 24 hours, I just can't wait for that lunch.

The hot sandwich, on the other hand, was delicious. As the boy put it: \"it tastes like a pizza.\" I'm glad I asked them to omit the pecans; it would have messed with the texture too much.

The soups were absolutely phenomenal - warm, thick and absolutely perfect. The sandwiches need separate mention. The croque monsieur was good albeit a bit heavy, though not surprising considering the ingredients. The brie with basil and tomato sandwich was full out awesome. It was super simple but the ingredients were extremely fresh and wonderful. The brie was so perfect and cut into the perfect thickness; not so thick it was all I could taste and not so thin I wondered why I paid the money to taste it.

And thought I LOVED Rittenhouse Tavern, I was excited to try out the new French menu in one of my favorite venues in Rittenhouse. I had a relatively easy time making reservations for prime Friday night dinner about a week or so out, which was nice. I pondered why it was a relatively easy reservation, but remembered that the restaurant is fairly new and large at that. We were seated right away and had excellent service the entire night from first interaction with the hostess, to the bussers, to our head waitress. The space is identical to that of Rittenhouse Tavern-I have to assume since it's a historical building there isn't a whole lot of leeway for renters to change the decor, nor is there any reason to. I noticed immediately upon sitting down that we were by far the youngest couple in the restaurant (being in our late twenties). Don't know what that means, but it was an interesting observation to me, anyway. The tables are all very spaced out in the large main dining room overlooking the adorable back patio-I will be looking forward to the weather warming up to try that out, among other reasons. We started with three appetizers. My guy had to pick the escargot, I chose a special baked scallop wrapped in spinach, and another special whipped fish ravioli-what can I say, I'm a sucker for the specials menu. The escargot was not all that exciting, honestly, but that's kind of why I didn't choose to order it. Both of the specials were delicious. The baked scallop was perfectly rare and the ravioli were fluffy and flavorful with a light lobster bisque sauce coating them. For main courses we shared the arctic char and the rabbit-both were solid. I'm not typically a meat eater but I really enjoyed the rich favors of the rabbit, which included chestnut, small dumplings and foie gras. It was really earthy and not at all subtle. The fish was a perfectly seared portion over a nice root vegetable puree-very good.Topping off dinner with a nice puff pastry filled with espresso creme and the complimentary macaroons and homemade marshmallow (I think?), we were very satisfied. Notably, we chose to bring our own bottle, which comes with a $20 corking fee, and we brought a very nice California Cabernet Sauvignon (probably frowned upon in a French restaurant? I don't care), it kept the price tag manageable, about $80 per person including tip. Not a huge splurge but definitely a treat for us. And a very nice one at that.

After making the reservations, I looked for pictures on their website and I was a little skeptical that this place would be fitting for a romantic dinner venue.

We shared the entrees to some degree and the stuffed quail was perfectly moist, the rice was different but very flavorful (in a great way), and the sauteed spinach was done very simply, but not so simply where it seemed like it was just thrown on there just to have a vegetable. The combination of the rice-stuffed quail and the perfectly sauteed spinach made this dish incredible. I hope they can find a way to put it on their normal menu. The Onglet & Frites was equally amazing. I got a medium rare hanger steak with a unique twist on fries. The steak was perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly, I mean I had to stop eating to show my girlfriend how perfect it was. I, personally, love my red meat to be medium rare, but most restaurants have a hard time giving you medium rare because they're always closer to medium doneness. Le Cheri, however, nailed it perfectly. The steak was served with a sweet-ish au jus and this unique side of fries. They took shredded potatoes or hash, formed them into a mozarella stick-esque shape and fried them. The result - a perfectly cooked and flavorful potato stick (in some sense). All in all, the steak needed nothing but itself and whatever seasoning they used for it to taste so phenomenal. I was impressed. For dessert, we had the honey-almond creme brulee and the white chocolate ice cream - both were fantastic. Their espresso and french press coffee is also very good.For a tiny little restaurant tucked away in an area of Rittenhouse that many are not familiar with, this place gives you everything you could ask for in a French restaurant. It was just nice to go somewhere authentic. If you want good French, you can always go to Parc, up the street, a Steve Starr restaurant. While the food is amazing and the atmosphere is bustling, you miss out on the intimacy of a dinner experience - the one you get at Le Cheri. Not to knock Parc or Steven Starr, because by all means they are successful for every good reason, but I would highly recommend Le Cheri for French cuisine if you're in the hunt for something just slightly right off of the beaten path or just good food."], ["Mike D.", "First time at Le Cheri. Experience was great from start to finish. Friendly greeting and excellent service. We started with the French onion soup and the lobster ravioli for apps. Both were very good...just small portions. We decided to order the escargot app along with our dinner. Pretty good. Main course was excellent. I had the Artic Char..cooked perfectly. My girlfriend had the Hangar steak, also very good. Finished off with dessert with the Strawberry Frasier and the special(forget what it was called). Also the coffee was excellent. I would definately recommend."], ["Leo B.", "This was our second time eating here for dinner! \u00a0Very accommodating staff who handled our group of 7! Very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of the menu!! This was their last night before closing for vacation so they they had limited numbers of the entrees-only one lamb dish and two chicken-so we had to opt for the veal medallion. \u00a0It was slightly over cooked to my liking, however the side dish was excellent. \u00a0Pork cheeks with pasta was outstanding along with the chicken. \u00a0Kudos to the hostess as she was able to secure the large group for outside seating even though they do not take reservations specifically for that area! \u00a0 Will definitely be back! \u00a0Felt special as the head chef came out to spend some time talking to us and thanking us for our business!!"], ["Mike Z.", "Came here on a date during a perfect weather evening. \u00a0We sat outside, the lighting and atmosphere was perfect.

Portions are small but fulfilling. \u00a0For entree we had Crab-cake and their fish of the day. Both were phenomenal. We drank wine with our food. \u00a0We sat here for 3 hours and didnt even realize how quickly the time flew by. \u00a0I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an awesome, relaxing, slow pace environment with great food."], ["Lisa G.", "Best French or maybe best restaurant in Philadelphia Food, atmosphere, and people are amazing."], ["Bebilov G.", "I went to this restaurant for the first time yesterday. We sat outside on the garden, the atmosphere was beautiful!! Service great as well. As far as food, I don't know what I liked more...everything tasted amazing. We had appetizers, shared the special of the night whichever was fish for two, and dessert. Everything was soo good. I'd definitely return."], ["Elliott B.", "To sum everything up for you, the experience we had at Le Cheri was nearly perfect, if not perfect.There were ten of us on a busy Friday night in June and the meals came out promptly, were still hot, and delicious - something that does not happen very often at a restaurant. Not only was the service on point, the food itself was enough of a reason to go back.I had the steak tartar, which was one of the better tartars I've had. The accompaniments were well done and I had no complaints. Some of my table mates also had the foie gras. Now, I've had my share of foie gras and I must say that it may have been the best foie gras I've ever had.For my entree I had the scallops which were large, fresh, and tasteful. Again, scallops are hit or miss - you either get fishy tasting rubber, or you get an epic mound of buttery-like goodness. I'll let you guess which version they plated.The restaurant itself had a nice neutral atmosphere, nothing to trendy or impressive, but it fits the bill for a French cuisine restaurant. Of you're looking for an authentic French experience, look no further. It's not a Stephen Starr restaurant trying to recreate a French menu (cough Parc), it's a restaurant with French owners who know French food and fine ingredients. Can't wait to go back."], ["Jen L.", "Le Cheri is a great option if you are looking for a peaceful place to enjoy a delicious meal. \u00a0Sure, you don't necessarily feel as if you're transported to France when you first walk in the door, but the crisp white table cloth will do just fine for a dinner out with foodie friends, a nice date, or dinner with parental units. \u00a0The menu seems to change with some frequency, but the staples are great. \u00a0The escargot was truly delicious: balanced rich flavors with potato and a buttery sauce. \u00a0Steak tartare was also flavorful but maybe not quite up to Vernick standards. \u00a0The table side quail was excellent. \u00a0Tender bird stuffed with foie gras, accompanied by perfectly cooked asparagus and homemade gnocchi. \u00a0$34 but worth it. \u00a0Desserts were also scrumptious, although the pot de creme does not quite live up to the other options on the menu or the one at Zinc.Overall a lovely meal. \u00a0The wine list has reasonably priced bottles. \u00a0Split appetizers, entree, dessert, and split wine amounted to $54 per person ... Not bad for French food in Rittenhouse!"], ["Bill W.", "The meal started out ok. \u00a0The appetizers were pretty good - steak tar tar (the special) impressed, fennel soup was done well, and the goat cheese ravioli was good (though pretty standard if we're being honest, I mean cheesy pasta in butter sauce is always good, and I was hoping for more). \u00a0Things went downhill with the entrees - my unbelievably dry cassoulet overshadowed any positive comments I could make about the rest of the dinner course. \u00a0Dessert was good. \u00a0Service was passable.But it was the confusing encounter at the end of this meal that quickly and definitively turned my opinion of Le Cheri from \"has some issues\" to \"NEVER AGAIN,\" because what happened was so unusual and off-putting that I'm still angry thinking about it a month later.Quick timeline:1. Made reservation in November, called to inquire re: bar/wine status, told to bring our own wine to the restaurant.2. Brought our own wine to restaurant (duh).3. Informed by the waiter (after the third bottle no less) that there is a per-bottle corkage fee.4. We explained to the waiter what we'd been told, and he told us he'd try to look the other way on the fee for the last bottle. \u00a0It wasn't a big deal to us, we brought nice wine and we weren't upset about the fee, just the lack of communication (though I know plenty of people who would have had a major issue at this point, and with good reason). 5. We finished dinner, and got the bill, which only had one corkage fee charged for 3 bottles - we figured our waiter took care of us, good guy. \u00a0Gave him the credit card.That's when things got bizarre. \u00a0A few minutes later the owner shows up at the table with combative body language, rudely interrupting our conversation to begin a one-sided argument about the number of corkage fees on the bill. \u00a0Your guess is as good as mine why we were getting yelled at for the bill the waiter prepared, but whatever. \u00a0We explained to her that we were unaware of the fee, (not even trying to make an excuse, but genuinely trying to help her understand the nature of the mistake).Well she didn't like that. \u00a0She proceeded to call me a liar, stating there was \"no way\" I didn't know about the fee (even though I learned soon after that they received the license less than a week before; maybe I was supposed to call everyday and check?) \u00a0Then, she told me in an accusatory way that I'd received a confirmation from Opentable the day before. \u00a0Before I could begin to contemplate the relevance of that comment, she asked directly \"Well, did you receive the confirmation?\" the insinuation being that Opentable must have informed me of the corkage fee \u00a0(The first thing I did when I got home was check the Opentable email, which of course made no mention of anything related to liquor status, why would they?)Long story short, she made her scene, she adjusted the bill, and we left. \u00a0Everyone else seated within 20 feet of us was now painfully aware of the corkage policy, so mission accomplished I guess.Just got your liquor license and now there's a corkage fee? \u00a0No problem. \u00a0Miscommunication about the bill that needs to be corrected? \u00a0Whatever, no problem. \u00a0Owner going from zero to CRAZY for no reason, and seemingly doing everything she can to make a scene? \u00a0No excuse.I know I'm just another idiot writing an online review, \"he says, she says\" applies, I get it... but there was no justification for the attitude. \u00a0If it had been handled any number of different ways I wouldn't even be mentioning it right now. \u00a0In fact, even though there were some significant issues with some of the food, it was decent for the price point, and I probably would have given them another shot once they worked out the kinks. \u00a0But what she did is just bad business. \u00a0She's lost my future patronage as well that of several friends who value my opinion. \u00a0I hope it was worth the $20.And since I've already burned the bridge I might as well say - I never really liked Bibou either. \u00a0I tried them early in their run, and was always confused by the high rating they receive. \u00a0I guess I always will be."], ["Steven H.", "If I could leave negative stars I would. \u00a0I have never felt so mistreated as we were by the owner last night. \u00a0We went to Le Cheri to celebrate a birthday, since we are big fans of this and their other restaurant, Bibou. \u00a07:30 reservations - arrived on time. \u00a0The kitchen was so slow that at 9 we were still waiting for our entrees. \u00a010 minutes later we finally told them to cancel the rest of our meal. \u00a0(FWIW, the table next to us did the same thing, so it wasn't just us being impatient or difficult.) \u00a0On our way out we spoke to the owner and told her how unhappy we were with the experience - both the wait and the lukewarm way they had handled it. \u00a0(No real apology - just a shrug and \"the kitchen is backed up. \u00a0What can I do about it?\") \u00a0 She lost her cool and told us to \"get the [bleep] out of my restaurant.\" \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Stunned. \u00a0Needless to say I will never patronize either of their restaurants again."], ["Juliana K.", "Le Cheri is delicious (4.5 stars).

Though in truth, I love Bibou more."], ["Tam V.", "It took me a really long time to work up the desire to write this review because I enjoyed Bibou so much it felt terrible to speak badly about this restaurant...Anyway, boyfriend and I were invited here by our other couple friend for our regular double date nights. This is the same couple that introduced us to Bibou and a few other fantastic eateries in Philadelphia. We went sometime during the grand opening month, so perhaps they've improved since. Le Ch\u00e9ri is roomier and has very beautiful ambiance as compared to Bibou's cramped yet intimate setting. In short, the food was decent. Not the greatest I ever had for the price that I paid. I believe boyfriend got lamb and I got the special for the night - dry aged steak. Our dinner mates got scallops and dry aged steak as well. The two dishes came and were served to the appropriate guest and our two dry aged steaks were brought out and cut table side. My friend received his steak first and as it was being served to him I noticed it looked more medium as opposed to rare, as he enjoys his steaks rare. I comment and say perhaps our steaks got mixed up. They switch and give me his steak which was still too over cooked for my liking but I didn't want to cause problems. They then cut open the second steak and it looked even more well done than the first steak. Since we aren't high maintenance, we would've just sucked it up and ate it anyway but the waiter removes my plate from on front of me, takes the second steak away as well and holds it right up to his face into the light and exclaims that \"no, the second steak is more red... SEE?!?!\" And pushes the plates into my friend's face, pointing at the two overcooked steaks (for our likings) with the knife. We nod, smile and say \"ok just place them back down I'm sure they will taste amazing.\" Dinner continues and little things start to bother me..... The servers are a little confused and I'm watching them as they move throughout the space and it didn't look like there was a proper flow to the service. Granted, I'm not that high maintenance but if I'm told to expect greatness in a Rittenhouse restaurant (since Bibou received four bells in the Inquire) with these prices, I have higher expectations. The servers were slow on refills on water/drinks and then as I continue eating I notice too much juice running from my steak - from my knowledge, dry aged steaks aren't supposed to have that much run off especially since it was cut prior to being placed onto my plate. Regardless, my friend finished his steak off by himself and I eat most of it myself as well. Fast forward to the end and the bill arrives. We notice $45 each for four steaks, totaling $180 just for steaks. I mention to the server that we ordered two steaks, not four, and they proceeded to tell us that it is $45 per person, as each order of the steak is meant to be shared for two people. So, my friend who finished a whole steak by himself that THE RESTAURANT deemed MEANT to serve two people, that didn't actually do so and pricing that wasn't mentioned during the \"specials speech,\" cost $90. For like.. A 32oz steak. Ridiculous. \"Meant to serve\" isn't the same as \"plate sharing\" so this place must be out of their mind, especially with a place literally right across the street (that has received 5 stars from me...Which is a feat in itself) that has real dry aged steaks ranging from $40-$60 each steak, not this ridiculousness.The steak tartare was fantastic, though. Probably the best in the city, so they've got that going for them."], ["YelpHatesMe Y.", "One of the cities best, hands down.Our table was ready right away. The ambiance is overall pretty decent although it was a bit loud. I think the architecture makes noises bounce off the walls a bit but given the tables were spaced out enough it didn't seem too much of a problem.The food was some of the best I've had yet. I had the quail, which was a special and my GF had the arctic char. The quail was the best I've ever had and the foi gras and mushroom sauce/puree it came with was some of the best tasting stuff I've ever had. Hard to explain, so you'll just have to try it for yourself.I had the foie gras and my GF had the steak tar tare. While the foie gras was delicious, the tar tare stole the show. Up until now Stateside had the best in the city (IMO) but Le Cheri now wears the crown.The wine list. Actually a VERY reasonably priced wine list with some good wines on it. Most wines were around $50 to $70 each with the higher ones just over $100. I think I'd still prefer a BYO, but since its Rittenhouse, I'm sure the extra (profit on wine) goes towards that rent :)The only issue I had was water. We waited for over 10 minutes to get a refill and had to eventually flag down a random waiter (not ours) to get some refills, but I'm certainly going to ding them for that based on everything else.We'll be returning here often. As far as quality of food, I think Le Cheri and Avance are leading the Philly restaurant scene."], ["Tia A.", "Best French cuisine I've had in a while!This restaurant easily compares to the most renowned locations in New York, and it doesn't get more authentic French than this.First the wine list is impeccable.

The ros\u00e9 that was recommended was perfect.We went in for late dinner and had the foie gras, the cheese plate (with \u00e9poisses!) and the cheese ravioles. All delicious and with strong authentic flavors that made us very nostalgic.The charlotte dessert was a delight, especially because it wasn't too sweet. Complementary exquisite macaroons and surprising chartreuse marshmallows which I will now dream of at night.The owners are adorable, prices are reasonable and the decor is beautiful.

The Seared Artic Char was the \"winner\" of the evening, with the fish cooked perfectly and the skin seared to the point that it just slid off the fish, almost like a potato chip. \u00a0It was very very good. \u00a0I was a little disappointed in the rabbit dish, which had more foie gras than rabbit.I have to say I guess we're spoiled. \u00a0Most of the restaurants we go to in Philly are BYOB, which helps to reduce the sticker shock when you get the bill. \u00a0Le Cheri now has their liquor license, so if getting a bottle of wine with dinner (although there are other options), you know that the bill will be increased by at least around $50.The setting is a little more subdued (read elegant, dark, old world) than most of the restaurants in town, including Bibou, the other restaurant owned by the same couple running Le Cheri. \u00a0This shouldn't stop you from trying this beautiful location but we both thought we would return to Bibou before returning here,Before tip, with a bottle of wine and no dessert, we paid around $138."], ["Tom G.", "My friends and I were excited to visit Le Cheri and, upon arriving were impressed by the building and the surprisingly spacious interior (definitely large when compared to Bibou). Armed with three bottles of wine, we got seated. We order food, waiter opens (with some difficulty) the wine and pours it (again, surprisingly, with some difficulty). We order and then a bread basket is dropped off. Cold, hard bread. Almost frozen butter. Not really what I expected. Before we got our appetizers, our Chablis was done so the waiter asked if we should open the next bottle (a Chateauneuf Du Pape). We said yes and asked if he could decant. He decants the bottle and we say \"can you open the other bottle as it doesn't need decanting?\" He opens it and then says \"you know we have a corkage fee, right?\" No, we did not as when we called in late November they told us we would need to bring wine as they didn't have a license. We told this to the waiter and he said he couldn't do anything, then said he could waive the 3rd bottle. Okay, whatever - it's not a ton of money for corkage ($20/bottle). Appetizers were okay: fennel soup was flavorful, goat cheese ravioli were well-prepared and the steak tartare was good but unevenly chopped. Entrees followed after a pretty long wait (we finished another bottle in the interim, to give a sense). Rabbit ballotine was the best of the dishes, moist and well-seasoned. The cassoulet was unbearably dry. The duck confit on top was literally like jerky and the beans were very overcooked and dry. The short rib dish was well-prepared and flavorful. \u00a0Desserts were all well-made and creative. Whoever is prepping the desserts has a deft hand with odd flavor combinations and most of them worked out well. So, to sum, the appetizers were mostly average, the entrees were good and bad, and the desserts were good. I'd say the food was a 3-out-of-5 since most of the dishes were just good and nothing was great (or approaching mind blowing). Service was a 4-out-of-5 (wine service gaffes aside).So, why 2 stars?Upon getting our check, we see they only charged us for one corkage. We think \"oh, cool, they are giving us even more of a break. Classy.\" We give our credit card. They charge it. We sign the slips. ...then the owner, Charlotte, comes out. She literally dresses us down in the middle of the restaurant, loudly, saying it doesn't matter that we were told before that they didn't have a license and now they do. That we should have called before to make sure they were still BYOB (who does that in Philly?). And that we received an Open Table email confirming the night before saying it is no longer BYOB (not true and we forwarded the email subsequently to the owner to show she was wrong on that).Then she says she's going back and charging us another corkage fee and brings out a new, higher credit card receipt. Seriously, what kind of shit is that? We brought 3 wines, the total of which dwarfed our meal in cost, so the corkage issue (which wasn't really an issue until she made it one) wasn't about cost on our end. We simply didn't know and felt it was odd to be reminded after our 3rd bottle was opened. There are far too many other good restaurants for us to visit the few times we make it back to my hometown every year. I won't be going back to Le Cheri (or Bibou for that matter).So, 3 for food. 4 for service. 1 for ownership. 2 stars overall. And I read they just fired their head chef. Maybe that cassoulet won't taste like it came out of the food dehydrator anymore."]], "The Good King Tavern": [["Abby B.", "Finally tried the food, after hearing so many people rave about it. \u00a0My final thoughts?

While I was at first skeptical of this French restaurant (not the biggest fan of traditional French food - I find it too heavy), I am glad we went!They had a deal on wines today - 50% off all bottles. Such a great deal! A group of four of us ordered the cheese plate and grilled artichoke to share for appetizers. I highly recommend both of these as they were delicious! I loved the selection of the cheeses, paired with seasonal fruit, honey, olive tapenade, and hazelnut brittle. The artichokes were wonderful dipped in a garlic aioli sauce. It also came with a few bites of grilled cauliflower which I also enjoyed. If I ever come again, I might just order these two alone as my meal.For the main course, I was super hungry and was looking for something filling. While the duck confit looked good (my friend ended up ordering it and enjoyed it), I recently had a bad experience with duck and so passed. I finally settled on the TGK burger, and asked for medium. The burger was nicely done, but I didn't find it mindblowing. What I really enjoyed were the side of fries, garlic aioli and pickle (sweet-ish in flavor). The fries were thick cut and tasted very much like duck fat fries. I ate them with the garlic aioli and finished it all!

We started out with a few openers, the escargots, spicy octopus, and the lobster deviled eggs (from the brunch chalkboard.) EVERYTHING was delicious but the hit was the octopus, which was perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful. The coffee is served in a small or large French press and we opted for the large coffee with a side of Bloody Mary's. After our openers left us in a culinary coma, our main entrees came out. I opted for the Open Faced Croque Madame which came loaded up with pork, cheese, a fried egg and a mustard mornay sauce. My other companions ordered the poached eggs with sausage, and the omelette with ratatouille and baguette. Everything was incredible.

Check out the chalkboards posted for their specials."], ["Melissa D.", "Came here on a Sunday night and they were offering 1/2 price wine bottles. \u00a0We had a really good unfiltered riesling (unfortunately I forgot the name!)To start, we had the socca, pea croquettes, and the escargot. \u00a0All were excellent, the escargot had a killer pesto-y sauce and the pea croquettes and a really wonderful flavor. \u00a0Grilled artichokes came compliments of the house and this was a fun dish to share.For entrees, my husband got the morteau sausage. \u00a0These were very good and the sausage tasted so fresh (made in house)! \u00a0The salad nicoise was very light and refreshing. \u00a0For the amount of food and the quality of the food, the price is fantastic. \u00a0The wait staff were very friendly and helpful with the menu. \u00a0Definitely will be coming back to try some of the cocktails and other menu items."], ["Julie Z.", "Went here this morning for brunch. \u00a0I will say the bartender was courteous and attentive. \u00a0He stayed on top of our drink orders and refilling the water which was great. \u00a0I ordered the fizzmosa and it was $10 ,not worth the money. Did have a small selection of craft beers, but nothing special for Philly. I ordered the French toast served with ice cream, blueberries, \u00a0and whipped cream. My boyfriend got a sausage dish with red sauce and pieces of baguette. Both dishes I found to be totally average. \u00a0For two small brunch plates, one cocktail, \u00a0and one beer the check came out to just about $50. This is a cute little place but for the quality of the food and price, \u00a0there are many other better brunch options."], ["Katie L.", "I had visited Good King Tavern a while ago for drinks and snacks, so I as eager to make a trip back for a proper meal. We were in a grazing mood, so we stuck to their openers and small places. The specials board was calling to us, and the duck hearts in particular were quit delicious, but the highlight was the grilled artichoke off of their regular menu. The accompanying smoked shallot aioli was the kind of sauce that you want to slather every sandwich in and maybe use as a face cream or something. Heaven. Their cocktail menu is thoughtful (Le Diable is a highlight) as well as their rotating wine selection. The ambiance is definitely a big selling point at Good King - this is a great date place."], ["Hoang T.", "I can see how this place receives a high rating. My girlfriend and I were out for dinner and decided on some \"french\" inspired food. The restaurant itself is really charming and they offer outdoor seating, which I would have opted for if the wait wasn't so long. We came on a Friday night with no reservations but luckily there was a table in the back, albeit next to the bathroom, which wasn't really an issue with me. The menu had some french inspired dishes and there were also some specials on the board. The prices are fair and the portions are nice. We ordered the spicy octopus salad, brusselsprouts, sweetbread (special), and escargot. I also ordered an import belgian beer (saison something, in a can..). The beer was good, but it wasn't that cold, forcing me to drink it quicker and without my meal. As for the food...i though the food was flavorful and good, but I wasn't blown away. The octopus had a nice char to it, the escargot had great garlic flavor but a bit salty and the crostini that came with it was a miss for me..the sweetbread was something i haven't tried before and enjoyed it. however, i thought the temperature of the chickpea ragu was too cold... probably because the kitchen was waiting for the sweetbread to finish. The brussels sprouts were nicely done and probably the winner of the night. the sauce may get a bit heavy for some (including me) but wasn't a bad thing. I would totally go back for brunch or dinner again. Our server was on point and very good. He explained the menu and options and was attentive given it was a fairly busy night. PS. A diner next to me ordered the duck confit which looked amazing...if i wasn't stuffed, i would've ordered it!"], ["Scott L.", "Came here for brunch on a Saturday. The place was packed but we got our table right away with our reservation. For being so busy the server was still very attentive and helpful. We didn't have to wait too long for our food either. My mimosa was solid with a lot of champagne and fresh squeezed OJ. The Banh Mi sandwich on special was absolutely fantastic. It was made with their house made lemongrass sausage and packed tons of flavor. A few bites from everyone else's plate was enough to confirm everything they made was very good.It's a little tiny inside but aside from that this place is great and we will definitely be back. Nice servers, great food, and a pretty cool atmosphere in a great Philly neighborhood."], ["John W.", "I recently visited the the Good King for the first time to have dinner, and loved it so much that I came back the next week with a different group. I often leave a restaurant with no strong opinion one way or another, but I loved everything about the Good King. It has a casual, unpretentious feel all while serving delicious French food. The duck confit was the best I've ever had. The duck came in fingerling form and was juicy and delicious. My next meal I got he Morteau Sausage which I also thoroughly enjoyed. The accompanying potato gratin was excellent too. The best part is the value - for eating delicious, hearty French entrees I feel like I should've been paying in the high teens, low 20s for each dish, but at $13 this is a steal! The first time I went was a Wednesday night and I was seated right away. The second time was Friday at 7:30pm, and my 2 friends and I enjoyed a drink at the bar until our table was ready. It was crowded there but not at all loud, and there is the right amount of lighting so that it doesn't feel dark.

The menus is adventurous but not overly fussy. Lastly you can get a good, solid, constant cocktail. And the bartenders specials are often surprisingly good.

The brussel sprouts were amazing, probably some of the best I've ever had, but also probably some of the unhealthiest (I wont' describe it since a picture will probably be a better source of explanation). I got the house made falafel for an entree. It wasn't bad but it didn't blow me away either. I'd definitely had better (and for cheaper).Dessert was bread pudding with lavender ice cream. I thought it was very good but I'm also a sucker for anything sweet (the ice cream was not significantly lavender-y). Overall it was kind of underwhelming. I wasn't outraged because the prices were reasonable and I enjoyed the atmosphere, but I won't be coming back for the food if I do come back."], ["Sabrina G.", "Had the cheese table and it was fantastic.

Everything here is cute and compact, from the small yet efficiently-packed space to the carefully arranged plates. I've tried the chickpea pancake and the falafel platter so far, and both dishes had great flavors. What prevents GKT from being a 5-star spot for me is the fact that they're a bit heavy-handed with the salt. I am not particularly sensitive to these things, and the fact that I noticed it means the food was definitely over-salted."], ["Dan F.", "Lovely vibe but my meal was disappointing. House whites were a step above Barefoot. (They offer house wines in three grades, good/better/best, and best was not so great.) Steak quality was below par. If the color gray was a flavor, that would describe the meat. The menu called my dessert chocolate but what I was served was drenched in caramel - tell me that before I order it."], ["Nina S.", "It doesn't get any better than this neighborhood gem!!!! Every single dish I have tasted here was delicious. \u00a0My favorite dishes are the Arugula Endive Salad and the Felafel Pattie. Falafel was a surprise to see on the menu but the dish is actually very complex with a spicy yogurt sauce and pickled beets, complete with a side of pomme frites (aka fries). The atmosphere is very welcoming and warm. \u00a0Music selection adds to the inviting and comforting setting. White linen napkins on the table give it an extra touch to make you feel special dinning there. Servers are friendly and the \u00a0kitchen team is very talented. The daily menu has a lot of great options but their Executive Chef Paul Lyons creates daily specials that add to the delicious choices. Must try drink: French 75 - Trust me - I get this every. single. time. A bonus is the location off of South Street because it's quite when seated outside but still around a lot of buzz so easy to walk to from Center City or Queens Village. I live very close so I get the luxury of walking here and visit as often as I can. See you soon, Good King!"], ["Julie S.", "The Pros:Great drinks, reasonably priced bottles of wine, and a lovely atmosphere but...The Cons:Overpriced food like the meat board which was tiny and had zero creativity.

We went there for brunch as a rare treat sans kid. The location was a little secluded compared to the cluster of options near Christian but it was easy enough to find. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful. The decor was warm and cozy. It's a small restaurant but we luckily got a table immediately. They also do reservations for future reference. The menu is not too exotic but the steak and eggs were savory and well prepared. Their brunch specials are more unusual and equally delicious. I had the Bahn Mi, which was a pork belly and pork liver pate served similar to a Vietnamese hoagie. It was phenomenal. I highly recommend giving this place a try."], ["Nissa G.", "Nice little spot off South Street. Nice ambiance, booth and bar seating, little dining room in the back area.

It has a great cozy upscale feel with wonderful food. We both started with some tasty bubbly cocktails. If you love some bubbly than this is the place for you. They have plenty of options. We then split the grilled quail with wilted arugala and a sherry au jus and it was lovely. Yes, quail is always tough to eat because it's just so tiny but the flavors were really tasty. It was a very fall dish. My only wish was that the quail came with more of a grilled texture but all and all, great start. I should also mention that the bread and butter was awesome. I loooove a french baguette and they serve a great one!For our entrees we went with the seared duck breast and the butter poached salmon. The duck was perfect. I love a seared duck breast and this dish had every component I love in a duck dish. Perfectly medium rare, sweet and savory with a creamy puree to pair. Great. Very rich but well worth the richness! The salmon was also a winner. It was more on the rare side which is fine by me with the perfect buttery flavor. The other components all paired well with the dish and didn't take anything away from the salmon. With the cold winter months upon us, absolutely check this place out!"], ["A B.", "Tremendously inviting space, staff hustling, lots of energy. The bistro fare is deliciously simple and done extremely well. Bravo, Chef Kenny - loved the red socks!"], ["Amanda T.", "Love love love this place. I am in love with their homemade bread, which blows all over bread out of the water, and all their small plates. In particular I LOVE the oeuf du pecheur and it is a staple in all my meals here. In fact, I may just order a bunch of oeufs the next time I come as my full meal. Another impressive appetizer is the terrine de food gras. \"Grape jelly\" is an understatement and it never tasted so good!The main plates are incredibly heavy so if you are not starving they may be difficult to finish. I had le gasconade de jarret d'agneau the most recent time and housed the entire thing because the lamb just fell off the bones and the prunes and cornmeal were the perfect accompaniment to the bold flavor of the meat. Again, not recommended if you had a late lunch...I have to mention the mac & cheese side dish, or \"gratin de pates facon peggy.\" I am a voracious eater of mac & cheese and this ain't my first rodeo. Nonetheless, Bistrot la Minette had the best mac & cheese I have ever had hands down, regardless if you like the potlucky four-real-cheese mac & cheese or the powdery goodness of Kraft's insta-mac. The mac & cheese here will fulfill all your cheesy fantasies. Bistrot definitely did their French culinary magic (technical term) to this basic dish and elevated it to divine."], ["Anthony S.", "Sadly, this year I could only go to one place this year for restaurant week. Fortunately, I ended up at Bistrot La Minette. I happened to tell some friends I was going here, and they said if you haven't had escargot that this is the place to try it. Never having tried escargot, I felt obligated to get it as my first course. The flavor was buttery and garlicy, and who can complain about that?! For the main course, I had the lamb shank. It was ridiculously tender, served in a little broth with root vegetables. We got a carafe of the house red wine, which was perfect to wash down the delicious hunks of lamb. And finally, for dessert I had the poached pear (in red wine and with black currants--are you kidding me??! Yes please!). If you know me, you know how much I love pear. And this was definitely the perfect dessert."], ["Schmidty W.", "A restaurant week success!! I went here with my mom and sister for the first time last night, and I can definitely say that I'll be back.

Additionally, the decor is very beautiful and french, as it should be since this is a french restaurant, and the wait staff was AMAZING and very attentive, brining us complimentary cheese puffs before our meal and then complimentary chocolates to finish it off. The best part of the whole experience though had to be the absolutely delicious bread! We ate probably three baskets of this stuff, and it's made in house! Unfortunately, they don't have enough to sell, but it's worth it for the bread alone to go to this place, that's how good it is. :D"], ["David T.", "I agree with the reviewer who talked about saltiness, but am not sure why that (and the Illy cups?) merit two stars for \"La Minette.\" Maybe the coat check was too cool for her...So it's not the \"Best place in Philly\" but it's very good. It's some of the most authentic French bistro food you'll get in the US. Yes, some dishes are quite salty, but you'll get that in a nice place in Paris, too. The restaurant has beautifully flavored dishes and excellent drinks. It's expensive; but again, so is just about anywhere in a big city where you have great service and fine dining. So now that I've taken on the Yelpiverse, let me just say that this place is absolutely worth visiting; especially if you're missing your favorite little restaurant by the Seine. I had my own small quibbles (yes, salty, and they should carry classier sparkling water or make their own, and the food took just a little too long to get to us) but it's darn good and you can't go wrong there, which is more than one could say about most places."], ["Rene L.", "This place is amazing.

Food is seasonal (as it should be) but luckily for me the gorgeously garlicky escargot, to their Oeuf de peucher (mussels in tarragon cream with a poached egg) have permanent residence on the menu, which is a very good thing.An they do brunch that should make the surrounding eateries hang their heads in shame..Peter Woolsey's food and culinary reputation have seen him \u00a0branch out to La Peg, but Bistrot will always have a place in my heart for great service and fabulous food that after eating, imbues me with a sense of sated bliss."], ["Kendrah R.", "Atmosphere is wonderful. \u00a0Food is average. \u00a0Bread is excellent. \u00a0 If you are looking for a cafe in this neighborhood to have a nice long hang out lunch to catch up with friends, I would consider going here. \u00a0It is the kind of place that makes you want to sit and talk for hours. \u00a0If I were looking for excellent French food, this is not the first place that comes to mind. \u00a0 I went for lunch so cannot comment on dinner. \u00a0I had a lyonnaise salad that was not good. \u00a0I couldn't finish it. \u00a0The frisee was wilted, the egg tasted soft boiled slimy rather than nicely poached, the dressing was nothing, there was no zing. \u00a0My partner had trout that was good. \u00a0 I noticed they had a private little dining room which could be great for events."], ["Adam K.", "Wonderful French Restaurant, 1.romantic, 2. great service, 3.

The bathroom was also very sophisticated and neat in style.As for our service, it was perfect. Our server (his name may have been Andrew but I forgot) was incredibly helpful and polite. He explained the best dishes and was always coming around to refill our water, clean up, and offer more bread (which we ate 2 bins of!). The other waiters were also very helpful and polite!The food was phenomenal. Aside from the tasty homemade bread, we began with the poached egg/mussel dish and the escargot. Both were AMAZING and very unique! Our entres, the duck and the rabbit, were mindblowing, as well. I preferred the rabbit, which was perfectly tender and was coated with a delicious sauce with a side of pasta. The duck was crispy and delicious, but less of a standout to me. My boyfriend preferred this, so to each his own! The desserts, the raspberry cream dish and the chocolate cake, were perfect. They even served us chocolates upon leaving.One thing that really stands out is that we did not feel rushed.

Incredible restaurant and I would certainly return!"], ["Natalie D.", "We visited this past Valentine's Day, and after dying to try it for over a year, I was very excited to go. That said, I left feeling let down.I must say the food was absolutely delicious. I got the grapefruit salad to start, and the salmon for my meal as well as the 11-layer cake for dessert. That's about where our nice night left off.The girl at the front handling coat check was extremely nice and friendly, and seated us promptly. It was a struggle to get into our seats as the tables are so close together, we were practically on the laps of the other diners. Our waiter, Seth, then came over to ask us what water we preferred. When he returned to take our drink orders, he seemed a bit put off that I ordered a soda (I do not drink very much, and not with a meal like this). Next, we ordered our appetizers, and my boyfriend attempted to pronounce the French names, trying but joking a bit as we do not speak French. Seth was not amused and proceeded to correct every single word my boyfriend said with his nose basically turned up in the air. Good for you Seth, you can say \"mushroom\" in French. I am not worthy of your presence (never mind that I do speak other languages). I didn't even try, ordered my grapefruit salad and was done with it. The grapefruit salad was delicious and refreshing, and my boyfriend's puff pastry with mushrooms was out of this world.It came time to order dinner, and when I placed my order for salmon, Seth asked me what temperature would I like it at. I had one of those moments of confusion where a common question didn't make sense for some reason, and I asked him for help. \"What do most people choose?\" I asked, and he replied with \"well, that's why I'm asking you.\" .......okay so you can't even politely recommend something? I was clearly confused and instead of assisting me, he decided he needed to lecture me on how their salmon is sushi grade and only the 6% of the finest salmon exported from Canada. Then he actually said to me \"if you were to go to a fine dining restaurant, you would know what temperature you like.\" EXCUSE ME?! I DO go to fine restaurants, but God forbid I had a momentary lapse.The second he left the table, I was ready to leave. He had made us both feel like unwanted children the entire night, when we had no reason to be treated in such a manner. After finishing my salmon and saying it was delicious, I got another lecture on how it's sushi grade and the finest to be imported to America. I \u00a0then told him I do not order fish out a lot (which is true) because I have a stomach disorder that can ruin a night due to the wrong meal (which is also true). \"Oh...well it's sushi grade from Vancouver!\" .......Yes, Seth, I think I got that the first time around. Another young couple our age was then seated next to us, and the way he treated them made me even angrier. He attended to their every whim and need, and spent plenty of time talking with them quite friendly. Us, not so much...I guess our money - which we spent plenty of - was not good enough for him. We could not wait to get out of there, and honestly despite the amazing food, I am turned off from ever going back. Sorry, sir, but you are a damn waiter on South Street, not in the finest restaurant in Paris. You can get off your high horse now.Also, the 11-layer cake was so rich and sweet I could barely finish it. Oh well, it got me out of there faster."], ["Leslie P.", "YAY, I AM A FAN!Bistrot La Minette is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. My new husband and I went last night for Restaurant Week based solely on reviews (and availability, thank goodness). When we pulled up, I thought, \"Oh, it's one of these places.\" Right off South Street, I had driven and walked past Bistrot La Minette and Beau Monde et al, but for some reason, they never appealed to me. Well, I was wrong. The ambiance is so cute--warm, friendly, but romantic, too, without being stuffy. I think Yelp says the attire is \"casual,\" which I think it is, but you can dress up if you want for sure.The menu for Restaurant Week is very similar to their regular menu. I know this because I asked the waitress for the regular menu after the main course because I thought, \"This is one of those restaurants you bring out-of-town guests to.\" I was so pleased to see mains in the 20 dollar range and appetizers around $12. What an excellent price point for such deliciousness. This place is what Restaurant Week was designed for--try something you wouldn't normally try and then become ardent followers.We shared everything, so we had two appetizers, two mains, and two desserts. The fisherman's poached egg appetizer (has a much cooler French name this Spanish speaker cannot come close to type nevermind pronounce) was very tasty. We also shared the escargot. Their escargot is the real deal and tasty, so if you've had some lame escargot in the past (looking at you Bistro St. Tropez), don't let that keep you from the snails here.Our mains were so tender and rich. We shared the rabbit and the duck. I thought Ms. Potter was going to whack me on the head with a children's book, but they were so great. The duck, in particular, with its wine reduction was out of control good.The chocolate mousse dessert/cake was soft and rich, but not that kind of lock-jaw-rich, so, unfortunately, we ate the whole thing! We also shared some yummy dessert course cheese. Every plate was licked clean.Definitely going back and bringing friends and family. Yay!

The service is amazing, The floor manager immediately attended to us, made us feel welcome, seconds after we were seated. \u00a0That's not one of the reasons \u00a0I visit a restaurant, and fortunately they knocked all the reasons I do out of the park. \u00a0Every course was incredible, engaging, and the perfect amount of food. \u00a0The favorite familiar items were there, along with perfectly chosen items for the occasion. The cocktails followed the same script. It's the kind of place, where you feel like you owe them a favor when you leave. The service and food is that good, with zero pretentiousness. You've had such a good experience after you've left, you want to go back for every meal, and think of them as great friends."], ["Ramon F.", "We were greeted upon arrival. The restaurant was empty with the exception of a private party in the next room. We were sat in the center of the restaurant and I could see that if this restaurant was full, that the seating would be so close to other tables, I would be forced to hear and smell the next table. They even had to move the table out and to the side for my friend to get in, she's on the petite side. I've been to many restaurants like this in the past, so I don't know why I was surprised. All that being said, I thought that the service was very good. The timeliness of food was very good as well, as I did not feel rushed nor did I feel like it was moving too slow. \u00a0The appetizers were the quail and the escargot, both were very good, I would recommend both. For entrees the lamb shank and the beef bourguignon. The lamb was ok, but not great, I guess you could say it was average. The beef was extremely salty and inedible, I wanted to send it back, but my friend told me not to. The server asked if we wanted it boxed up to go, but we politely said no thank you and left it at that. I personally think the chef would have like to know, as it was more than likely a mistake. we then had dessert, If you're in the mood for a heavier chocolate the mousse cake was perfect, served with coffee ice cream, which tasted like it was made in house, definite plus. If you want light and simple go with the raspberry and cream layered cake (sorry I don't know the exact name/description), both excellent though! My drink with dinner was sparkling lemonade which was very sour, but tolerable. With dessert I had an espresso which was of very good quality. Overall, I would have to say that this was more of a fail than success, as there are times that I go out and only have 1 course, not 3. Had this been true tonight, my night would have been ruined. The stars I give are for the great service, sorry chef :-("], ["Lin Z.", "Amazing classic French cuisine. And very nice service. I had the oeuf du pecheur for the first course, and truite meuniere for the main course, and almond cake for dessert. Superb! My friend had escargots for the first course, and mustard-braised rabbit for the main course, and mille meuille aux framboises for dessert. We also got Swiss chard as accompagnement. Very creamy! Best French food I've had so far. Highly recommended!"], ["Eunni C.", "Cute French bistro in neighborhood. Warm ambiance and good service. \u00a0The portion of dishes are generous here even for bistro. Had lamb shank and brisket dishes for main. Both were pretty good but they were really salty.

Tartare de Saumon : Salmon tartar, mustard vinaigrette, Puy lentils, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, blood orange vinaigrette , unlike anything I've ever tasted, very well balanced with a good kick of citrus4. Escargot-not the best I've ever had, but very good. It was perfectly garlicky, but I wish it was more rich5. Cassoulet with duck confit was super heavy...i should have seen it coming but it was really overly rich. a good dish to have if i hadn't ordered appetizers and dessert too... 6.

The main courses were also delicious I only wish they had crepes."], ["D. B.", "This was by far one of the best meals I ever had in Philly. From the great service. The very reasonable prices and the quality of the food it was a great experience. Every bite was a delight. From the escargot to the main course. it was prepared expertly. I had the trout which was crispy, melt in your mouth with fingerling potatoes like no others. The pork chop my partner had was the tastiest ever. The prices were incredible for the meal and cant wait to go again. this truly is a not to be missed restaurant in the city. Ate outside on the deck and it was perfect. We had 3 courses with drinks. They have a happy hour during the week and it made it even a better value but would pay full price for this meal.

When I heard Bistrot La Minette was starting happy hour specials, I couldn't wait to check it out. The specials are available at the bar or outside area. \u00a0My friend & I sat at the (tiny) bar. At our 5:45pm arrival time, the outside area was already full. The happy hour wine was $3, Kirs are $4 and beer is $2. \u00a0All appetizers are half price and HH goes till 7pm. You also get some complimentary warm baguette slices & butter. I went with the wild mushroom puff pastry which was delicious. The escargots were tasty and presented in cute little individual pots with a crouton on top, but it was hard to get them out of the little pot without the crouton falling off. \u00a0No big deal, more of a mild annoyance. Service was great and we were asked in what order we wanted our food to come out...even though we were just having happy hour snacks at the bar (classy!).Our bill was less than $50 and that got us 6 glasses of wine and 4 appetizers total. I'll be returning for happy hour and will absolutely be back to check out dinner."], ["Kelley H.", "I've been here twice for Restaurant Week and each time was outstanding. In fact, my food was so good the first time I order the same appetizer and main course when I went back. My appetizer, the Oeuf du P\u00eacheur (Fisherman's Egg), had a delicious tarragon cream sauce, and way more mussels than I was expecting. My main course, the Lapin R\u00f4ti \u00e0 la Moutarde (Roasted Rabbit with Mustard), was amazing. Tender rabbit, handmade tagliatelle, and a divine mustard sauce. My tastes of the Flammekeuche and roasted duck entree were also delicious. The desserts were not quite as amazing as I was hoping they would be (this time I tried the Mille Feuille and chocolate mouse cake), but they were still very good. Bistrot la Minette's ambiance is also spot on. It's chic and French without being stuffy or pretentious. Basically, I can't wait to go back."], ["Judy T.", "My friend and I came here because I've been wanting to try Bibou for the longest and failed to get a reservation both convenient for him and I because it's always booked. So I looked for another French inspired restaurant and much to my satisfaction it lived up to it's high reviews. I love it here. The decor and ambiance is rustic and sweet.The menu is just big enough to see some items that I definitely wanted to try but not so big I wouldn't know where to start or what is worth tasting.At first after being seated for our reservation, we weren't greeted with menus or anything for at least 10-15 mins, which was a little confusing because it wasn't busy but the waiter explained there was confusion as to who was assigned to our table...It's ok Things happen, the meal made up for it We had the foie gras which was nicely prepared and very enjoyable.Truffle Mushroom soup special was amazing!! Every last bite was just as good as the last, light with delicate flavors.A beef tartare was soooo very good. I'm vietnamese so it reminded me of a vietnamese beef carpaccio just a different preparation but it was so good. Not chewy the beef tasted tender and fresh, the only way you should if you decide to venture out and have raw beef. Our main courses were the mustard braised rabbit which I was very apprehensive about eating, I'm an adventurous eater but some dishes make me second guess, let me say with the homemade pasta was so delicious. It had a similar taste to chicken but better! Some white meat and a lot of tender dark meat but not so.. Fatty tasting as chicken.We both decided it was our favorite dish!!! He had some sort of braised beef dish which was nice and tender but the rabbit was still our favorite. The dessert was the chocolate mousse cake which was heaven in your mouth for any sweets lover and it ended our spectacular dinner. Couldn't have been happier!"], ["Natalie M.", "I was really looking forward to trying this place and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. However, our appetizers were delicious; we ordered the mushroom starter and butternut squash soup, both were incredible and the bread was also very good. For an entree I ordered the halibut and while it was good, there was something missing and it just wasn't flavorful enough, also it was on the dry side.The warm lighting and decor creates a pleasant ambiance, but the tables are pretty close together so the waitress was often bumping into my partner. Bonus: the chocolates provided at the end of the meal are great! Can't say I'd go back."], ["Abbie D.", "Great food, great ambiance and exceptional service. The chestnut foie gras soup was incredible.. Poached egg with mussels = rediclous!

I had the foie gras special for a main, as I knew with the richness I wouldn't want or need anything else. \u00a0Fabulous! \u00a0The others had Truite Meuniere and \"the chicken\", and both said they were great. \u00a0Unfortunately we did not have dessert, which I'm sure was also excellent.The ambiance was lovely, and quiet enough that we could talk, since we had a lot of catching up to do. \u00a0Overall, a great evening!"], ["Andi S.", "I ordered the escargot with garlic and olive oil and the goat cheese omelet. Even the bread and butter were delicious. The high quality of ingredients used as well as the knowledge of preparation are what makes this place. The excellent service and ambiance doesn't hurt either. Our server was very professional. I look forward to returning."], ["Elva L.", "i think of our meal here the other night as one of the best i've had in at least a few weeks, maybe months.to start, we received a little gift from the chef: a cheese ball, eh, okay. i am impressed that they coaxed some complex flavor out of whatever cheese they used and rendered it ubiquitous in the puffy dough. that must be harder that it looked/tasted. anyway, it was unexpected, but i didn't feel like it changed or enhanced our dinner.complimentary bread and butter: not much to say here, only that the bread was served warm and the butter soft. surprisingly many restaurants cannot manage to serve bread and butter properly. BLM did, good for them.starters: The Boy had pea soup, which I did not taste. I'm pretty specific about what color things have to be before I can eat them, and green soup is not on my list of acceptable color/texture combinations. I had the burgundy snails to start, um, gorgeous plate! insanely buttery, salty lead and a healthy trail of herbs per bite and the cutest little disc of CRISPY crouton in EACH container. you can very much see the amount of work put into each bite. additionally, it was served in TINY individual ceramic cups, rather than the kind of ramekin-like dish you normally see with escargot holes. main course: the special was a fresh caught halibut. our waiter explained it was only caught the day before, and i made up my mind that i couldn't not try it. i mean, this is probably the closest any of us will get to playing god-- to eat something that was alive only the day before?? sign me up! the halibut was cooked perfectly-- masterfully browned to a crisp on top, and a milky, tender flesh that was piping hot under. there is a difference between blasting a piece of fish on high heat for a short amount of time and letting it rest to near room temperature and cooking some more so as to Not overcook it, and what i got, which was a delicate filet cooked and served at impressively controlled doneness and temperature. The Boy had lamb shank which was just about melt in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating it, was already full, and did not want to offer up bites of my blissful fish for trade... it was rough.dessert: i will always go for creme brulee as long as it's available, so i forced the chocolate mousse cake on the boy (who didn't want dessert, I KNOW! blasphemy!!). the creme brulee was denser than i am used to, but the amount of sweetness was the perfect complement. As in, the sweetness matched the texture divinely so that the custard was still an absolute delight. The chocolate mousse was well executed, but not remarkable in my biased opinion. My only gripe was with the pistachio ice cream, which tasted to me rather like how some hand lotions smell. I did not care for it though it came at the recommendation of our waiter and I was excited to have it.speaking of whom, when we asked to have the lamb shank bone wrapped for our dog, he informed us that bones that have been cooked are likely to splinter and cause harm. this is something i did not know about, and i am glad he brought it to our attention and deterred us from making a potentially devastating mistake. kudos to this guy."], ["Alessia K.", "This gem continues to be our favorite place in the city to get an amazing meal in such a wonderful atmosphere. \u00a0It is such a charming restaurant with a friendly staff and the kitchen turns out some serious food. \u00a0We met the chef at a Cook event and he was gracious enough to come over and say hi to us during our most recent dinner. \u00a0I will continue to recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"], ["Tina K.", "The BEST dining experience I've had. 'Nuff said.The service was impeccable.

They gave a basket of bread, which was also very tasty. Hands down the best bread I've ever had--better than from bakeries!I ordered escargot and foie gras with a side of pommes anna. The foie gras was simply divine. I would go there again just to get more foie gras (and bread!). The raspberry mille crepe was also delicious.The atmosphere was upscale but still pretty casual. I really liked the soothing ambience and the clean-and-classy bathroom. Yay to clean bathrooms!Overall, I really recommend Bistrot La Minette.

Although I've never been to France.. I've studied the language and culture for years. The house red (wine) was delicious and not too light given it was a happy hour special. We ended up ordering snails, AMAZING AS ALWAYS... First timers must order this. Especially escargot lovers. Beef tartare... Not the best I had but definitely a very good dish if you like beef served this way. The scallops were cooked well and were just great. The mussel with poached egg was prob the highlight for me.

We finally got to try it this past weekend for our anniversary. The wait so completely worth it! Let's break down the review based on the dishes we had!OEUF DU PECHEUR: This is a must try! I would come back to Bistro La Minette just to eat this dish. I may actually go back for happy hour and order 5 of these. The tarragon cream was delicious and not too heavy. I mopped up the sauce with the complimentary bread! ESCARGOTS: The dish came with 9 escargots topped with crouton. The escargots were tender and had the perfect amount of garlic. It was also very tasty but not more impressive than escargots at other French restaurants in Philly.CASSOULET DE TOULOUSE: So, this dish was a lot larger than I expected, which was a delightful surprise! There was so much meat with the duck confit sitting on top of beef stew (with a whole lot of beef), sausage, and a sausage patty. The duck was tender, and the skin was crispy. However, I wish the skin could just be a little crispier. My favorite part was actually the sausage lying underneath the duck. Yum! I had enough leftover for another meal.PORK T-BONE SPECIAL: My husband had the pork t-bone with ratatouille, which perfectly complemented the pork. The t-bone was cooked to perfect. The meat was tender and juicy, even when we heated up the leftover. GATEAU OPERA: This 11-layer almond cake tasted amazing. It was very rich and chocolate-y but not overly sweet. The whipped cream was so light and fluffy! I wish they gave us a bigger slice because I could definitely eat more of this!We came here on a Sunday night, so the restaurant was not busy at all. We had a nice and relaxed dinner without feeling rushed by the waitress. It was a wonderful evening!"], ["Lianna N.", "I havent been to France, but IF I did go, I imagine it would be a fine experience like this one.

He teased and played with us all night, and his rich french accent didn't leave anything to be desired.The setting was intimate, and queens village off of penns landing was a perfect location to tuck this little gem of a bistro. Parked a block away in a lot that costed $15 for after 5pm. I didnt want to circle endlessly looking for parking. It's also across the street from THE best creperie! Anyhow I digress. The food was excellent, and I was most looking forward to the escargot. The little pots of creamy garlicky butter toast bits with the escargot leaves my mouth watering in it's memory. I dunked chucks of the free bread into the delicious butter till I greedily devoured every cholesterol ridden morsel. And then I did something really unclassy. I licked the edge of the pot. I hope no one saw. The rest of the meal unfolded less eventfully. I did the duck confit/lamb stew which was rich hearty and filling. I sampled off everyone else's plate to make sure I had a well rounded experience. I captured most of the dishes we tried in photos. I left floating on a little cloud.

Everyone who works there is pleasant and knowledgeable. The manager Brett, really knows his stuff. Very professional. I could go on and on commenting on the food which is highly varied, but always French country. This is not a hoi polloi type of French restaurant with the very rich sauces etc. it is classic French country, exactly what you would expect to get if you rented a car and went through the French countryside and stopped at a little bistro.

I practically licked my plate. That's normal right? What do you absolutely have to order? Escargots, Tartine aux Figues et Fromage Blanc (figs, bread, cheese and dips), and creme brulee. My party also had the fish and a chicken dishes. \u00a0I'm convinced you can't go wrong with ordering at this restaurant. We even got a table side visit from the main chef himself.

We arrived just in time for our reservation and were seated promptly. They also have coat check (yay!). Our waiter gave us some time to decide on drinks (I got a glass of pinot grigio and M got a Kronenbourg 1664), then proceeded to take our food order. I ordered the mussels with tarragon creme and poached egg and the mustard braised rabbit. M got the root vegetable soup and boeuf bourguignon. Before our food came out, we were served cheesy profiteroles, compliments of the chef!The mussels were TO. DIE. FOR. They were incredible. I couldn't stop fawning over them. I would have licked the sauce from the plate if I were slightly less classy (let's face it, I'm not too classy to begin with). I am normally not a big fan of egg, the taste always turns me off, but I ate that whole poached egg. It was wonderful.The rabbit was good. I've never had rabbit before so unfortunately, I have nothing to compare it to. The pasta it came with was perfectly done and was served in a nice, buttery sauce. M's soup was really good and surprisingly light. His boeuf bourguignon was especially tasty, too, but it was a small portion. For dessert, M order the opera cake and I ordered the puff pastry with raspberry sauce. My dessert ended my meal perfectly -- the raspberry sauce provided enough tartness to cut through the richness of the rest of my meal. M's opera cake was tasty, but heavy. I'm glad I didn't order it. The service was great. Very knowledgeable and accommodating. In our past Restaurant Week experiences, it seemed like the waitstaff was turned off by us, which made for an awkward experience.

IT WAS SO GOOD) and the Daube provencale (the gnocchis were like little puff of heaven,and the meat-SO TENDER).The cheese plate for dessert was so good we packed half of it to go home. The flourless chocolate cake was great too.Can't wait to go back when I can afford it any not worry about the prices!"], ["Stefano D.", "I'm not a huge French cuisine fan, but I must say this restaurant is spot on.

Many restaurants provide mediocre bread and butter when you order, but when you taste a freshly toasted slice of baguette at Bistrot La Minette, topped with thick, delicious, creamy butter, you know that BLM is bringing a taste of France to your palate. This place offers the most authentic French cuisine I've tasted in Philadelphia. I've been here twice now. I'd come here more often if it were closer to my neighborhood. BLM offers great 4-course prix fixe menus on a regular basis, exploring cuisines from all regions of France. My most recent experience was their 4-year anniversary dinner, which included a $30 menu (4 courses) and $4 drink specials:Drink - The Kir Royal au cassis and Lillet were both very goodFirst Course - The Vichyssoise Glac\u00e9e, a chilled potato and leek soup, was very light, silky, and refreshing. Second Course - The Terrine de Foie Gras (Duck liver) was very tasty and buttery in texture. The fig compote went very well with it. I thought the toasted brioche could have been replaced by a more firm toasted bread to provide more texture, but perhaps the dish was meant to focus more on the foie gras... The Bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine was also good, but I thought there was too much puff pastry and not enough sauce. As a result, the puff pastry was dry, and its taste overshadowed the taste of the wild mushrooms. Third Course - Both the Daube Proven\u00e7al (beef stew) and Coq au Vin (wine-braised chicken) were tasty, though the beef and the chicken in these respective dishes were a bit too dry. Fourth Course - my favorite course! - The Mille Feuille aux Framboises was just as tasty as it was during my last visit, though not as well assembled. Gateau de Mousse au Chocolat and the strawberry sorbet that came with it were both delicious. These desserts were pretty solid. I've had similar desserts at above-average patisseries in France. While they were not the best I've had, the entire meal was a great deal for the quality of the menu. Forget about Restaurant Week when you can get 4 delicious courses here for $30-$35 on a regular basis."]], "Girard Brasserie & Bruncherie": [["Jess B.", "LOVED THIS PLACE. I was visiting friends in Philly for the weekend and we'd been planning to go to a Mexican place instead, but when we walked in, it was so loud and noisy and sports bar-ish that we decided to find another place.Luckily we found Girard!! Every dish that came out of the kitchen was beautifully prepared, served with a smile, and, most important, *delicious*. The seafood was so fresh, and the preparations were lively and inventive. The waitstaff were extremely courteous and attentive, but not so much so that you felt like they were hovering. The ambiance was clean, busy but quiet enough so you could hear your fellow diners, and overall just happy. Think a bistro in Sweden. The owner was just adorable and obviously has a lot of pride in his restaurant being a success (it will have been open for a year this Thanksgiving!). Two other great things: The restaurant is BYOB, so you don't have to deal with the whole long wine/cocktail list ordeal; and the restauranteur is a leader in that he adds an extra 15% to the bill in order to cover a higher salary for its staff (this is covered in the menu so there's no confusion). We need more places like this."], ["Angela W.", "[3.5 stars for taste, 4 stars with service included] Beautiful and friendly ambience, perfect way to start my weekend brunch! I was overly excited to try this place.In terms of presentation, I \u00a0thoroughly enjoyed the creative layout and colors of each dish, as well as their unique pairing of ingredients (honey with avocado, charred grapefruit, yum!) You can just tell by the aesthetically pleasing photos posted on yelp. However the taste did not blow me away, personally, but it did not disappoint either. \u00a0I tried the...- Croquet Madame with ham: beautifully prepared and I enjoyed it. Only thought I had was that the ham was a bit dry in my opinion, and would have preferred it to have some type of vegetable to have balanced that out. - Duck Egg Benedict: disappoint for me, the meat was too gamey so I couldn't finish it even though I love duck. What are boyfriends for? Glad he came and didn't mind it too much! On the other hand, the homemade potato chips are to die for - get it. - Avocado toast: what everyone has been raving about, had to try! I loved the honey and grapefruit with it, very fresh."], ["Marla S.", "I wanted to love this restaurant. Based on most reviews it seemed really promising. I really enjoyed what I ordered, which was the ancient grains bowl, however there were other issues that really missed the mark here. \u00a0There were 2 servers taking orders. One of them seemed to be fine. I believe our table dealt with the owner. By the time we received our menus, the other tables were almost finished their meals. I finally asked for the menus, and he said \"we're bringing you fresh menus momentarily- No apology for the delay. \u00a0One of our diners on our group of 5 ordered eggs, and very specifically requested them over easy-very light. He was quite upset that it was too well done. The owner/server came over about 10 minutes later and scraped them off his plate, instead of just giving him a new plate. Our friend said \"This meal has taken forever\". We were there almost 1 1/2 hrs.This would have been a perfect time to apologize for the timing, and getting his order wrong. Instead , the server flippantly answered\" That's because it took so long to get your eggs the way you wanted them\"  \u00a0 This really pissed me off. Totally unprofessional! He seemed annoyed with us that we weren't considering staying for dessert. I would not recommend this place. I understand that sometimes places have off days.

We were able to get a reservation at a decent time using the Yelp SeatMe feature.Girard Brasserie is located on the corner of Girard and Marlborough Streets. After a few minutes driving around I was able to find street parking close to the restaurant. The space is open and clean, with yellow washed wood walls, wood floors and wood tables and white chairs. The ceiling has this funky white and black pattern. \u00a0The kitchen is open also and the place is not huge but still has a decent amount of tables. There was also some outdoor seating.The service was outstanding. They were helpful with suggestions and always right there to fill water or if we needed anything else. They really seemed to appreciate their customers. GB&B also follows the European concept, that their staff is paid a fair wage so the prices include a 15% tip. It is also a BYOB restaurant.We started with the Avocado Toast. This was really good with a combination of ingredients (chipotle honey, mascarpone cheese and grapefruit) that really worked well together.For our main courses we had the Char-Grilled Piri Piri Chicken, the Brasserie Burger and P.B.C. Commonwealth Dry Cider Maine Muscles. The nice thing about eating as a small family, we all share each other's food and in that way we get to taste everything. The Piri Piri Chicken was a winning dish. The Piri Piri sauce was full of flavors without being overly spice. The chicken was crispy and moist and the side salad was also very good. The burger was outstanding, one of the better burgers we have had. I wasn't too sure about the English muffin but it worked well with the Gouda cheese and bacon jam. The burger was juicy without the muffin being soggy either. The Muscles were also a good dish and the sauce was with bacon, garlic, herbs and sea salt had us asking for more bread for dipping.For dessert we had two very nice items, a lemon poppy seed pound cake with berries and a blackberry tart. Both were excellent and not overly sweet. Girard Brasserie also serves French press coffee.We were about $30.00 per which includes the 15% service charge. We left a small tip on top of that because everything was so good.

The food is fresh, light, airy, and just awesome. We had the omelette du maison which was very fresh and tasty. The eggs were especially flavorful. Love when an omelette is simple and needs only 2-3 ingredients as that shows the true essence of the quality of the eggs. \u00a0The avocado toast on pumpernickel bread was a nice starter. The elixir drip coffee was super smooth and supple on the taste. The service and interior/decor were terrific as well. I especially enjoyed the fact that the waiter took his time with our order so we did not feel rushed like we were in a factory. Very European approach to waiting. Definitely coming back here."], ["Nataly N.", "Did I just have the best brunch EVER today? Quite possibly so. From the friendly service to the impeccable food execution, there is no way to describe this experience other than \"pure and simple perfection.\" I had a wonderful Chai Latte with my Croque Madame, which was perfectly made with fresh Sourdough, ham, and Gruyere, and a side of fresh, house-made potato chips. My friends had the Eggs Benedict with Salmon Gravlax and the Gin Salmon Gravlax. All were very tasty and perfect in portion. The ingredients are locally sourced, and it looks like the menu changes seasonally. I also wanted to try just about every other item on the menu, but there wasn't enough room. Some items that stood out were the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl, the Smoked Royal Trumpet + Lentil Salad, and the French Toast. There is definitely something for everyone. I also highly recommend bringing your own champagne to complement your food with mimosas. This is a BYOB, and although it's perfect for brunch, it looks like there is a dinner menu as well. For a restaurant that pays its staff higher wages than the typical $2.83/hr + tip, the prices are still comparable to other good brunch spots in Philly. Also, the decor is awesome. You really feel like you're in a different world while you're inside. It's kind of a hike for downtown city dwellers to get to, but it is within walking distance of the Girard Ave. stop on the blue line and it's totally worth it once you're there. I can't wait to be back!"], ["Megan M.", "So pleasantly surprised. A couple of friends and I came here for dinner last night. We shared the avocado toast, cheese plate, and crab cake appetizers. The crab cake was incredible, no filler. \u00a0The avocado toast was comprised of a thick toasted piece of pumpernickel metropolitan bakery bread piled high with smashed avocado, seasonal pesto, and a dollop of ricotta. I detected a hint of dill which I wasn't thrilled with, but when all the flavors combined in my mouth I couldn't stop taking more bites. I would definitely come back for more. The cheese plate featured 3 cheeses, marcona almonds, honeycomb, and miniature grapes. Crostini was served with the cheese plate as well. All of the appetizers were fairly priced, the cheese plate in particular was a steal. For entrees my friends enjoyed the vegetable mezze plate and the bacon Gruyere omelet. I had the Piri Piri chicken which was juicy, flavorful, and served bones intact. It is fairly spicy, which I loved, but if you are sensitive to spice this is a fair warning. Served with a fennel slaw, it was a delicious entree and a generous portion.I loved the way that the server presented the check. Three bite sized pieces of dark chocolate were presented to us on a plate with the check underneath. Clever and a sweet touch.We used a Gilt City voucher and had no problems at all. The staff was incredible and though gratuity is included we left a little something to show our appreciation. The staff mentioned that brunch was worth coming back for, and I will definitely be back for both brunch and more dinners. Surprised it took me nearly a year to try Girard as I live so close. Definitely worth repeat visits."], ["Anthony S.", "I've been meaning to try Girard Brasserie since it opened, and thankfully had the opportunity to today. We split a 4-cup french press pot of Columbian coffee that was quite smooth with just a little bit of milk added. The coffee cups are petite, but the 4-cup was more than enough for the two of us. There were two other types of beans available, including one that was described as kool-aid-y (which sounded too strange for coffee, so we stayed clear of that one). For food, we split the croque monsieur + egg and the eggs benedict with duck ham. The croque was an open-faced sandwich with a thick slice of white bread, ham, cheese, topped with an egg and drizzled in a jus sauce. It was quite wonderful and rich. The eggs benny was also pretty great--the crust on the bread was a bit tough but I give extra points for the duck ham because I haven't seen that anywhere else in Philly. We also tried the salted-caramel doughnut for dessert, and honestly I wish we would have skipped this. I didn't enjoy the flavors and thought it was a little dry. A disappointing end to a great meal. I'll definitely be back once it gets warm outside--I noticed that all of the windows open up and I love eating en plein air :)"], ["Vanessa T.", "So I really want to rate this place a 5 star, I think I will once I get to try their dinner. \u00a0Ok first things first, this restaurant is called Girard (per giant yellow sign). \u00a0Brasserie and bruncherie seem to be subtitles (nowhere to be seen in the front door aside from being on the menu). \u00a0Not a big deal, just technicalities. I came in for brunch with my boyfriend and sat outside. \u00a0I kind of got a diner vibe once I walked in the restaurant, however, make no mistake, the food was far from diner quality. \u00a0We started with the tomato gazpacho (morr puree than creamy but certainly was filled with flavor). \u00a0I normally dislike puree soup but this was really good. I had the smoked duck benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side while my bf had the country style breakfast with bacon, charred grapefruit. Ok, so I was actually expecting a thicker piece of duck than sliced beef like duck. However, it was overall very good without being too salty which is normally the reason why I don't like smoked salmon on my benedict. \u00a0Glad I got to try the duck version benedict. \u00a0My boyfriend really enjoyed the hike fries which were a fusion of being a chip but filled with potato filling. We ended our meal with the banana granola coffee cake, served warm and moist. No complaints there. The granola were toasty and crunchy, loved it. Oh for our drinks. We had the ice cafe Brulee (I thought was a little disappointing because it tasted like a cold brew) and coconut Chai lemonade (one word, INTERESTING but not my cup of tea). \u00a0Overall, a very enjoyable meal outdoors because the building was on the side where it was shaded so not too hot on summer days. I'd definitely come back for their dinner menu and review again. But I'd really give this a 4.5 star for brunch in fishtown."], ["Patricia H.", "Quick update on the review. \u00a0I have visited this restaurant three times now and went for bunch this past weekend. \u00a0I really loved the brunch service (the dinner service was great, too!). \u00a0The portions were reasonable and the service was attentive but not rushed. \u00a0We were able to relax and not feel like the restaurant wanted to turn over the table and get you out the door. \u00a0Also, I highly recommend the coffee! \u00a0The elixir coffee is great and they kept brewing fresh, hot pots to refill coffee. \u00a0I want to come back and try the bloody mary mix which someone else ordered and looked great. \u00a0The other nice thing about the restaurant is you can make a reservation for brunch, which is somewhat unusual in the city. \u00a0All in all, this is a great brunch or dinner spot and I would highly recommend it."], ["Jerry T.", "Even better than we expected! \u00a0A perfect Valentine's Day dinner . . .

Everything was amazingly prepared and savory! The French press offerings were aromatic and delicious (for you coffee lovers)! Service always sets off the mood and atmosphere of our dinning experiences and I have not one critical thing to say about every person who was present during our brunch. The vibe and energy are worth going to the restaurant alone.

Super cute decor. Servers were welcoming, friendly and timely. We had the chai (very good but could have been a little spicier, maybe just preference?) and I tried a sparkling cold brew (\"sparkling\" was due to addition of club soda or brewed with it? can't remember) - definitely different but I think I'll stick to the good old regular cold brew for the most part. Had the avocado toast as an appetizer, it was DELICIOUS - topped with goat cheese, grapefruit and some other goodness that I'm probably forgetting. Also tried the wings and prawns; both were good but just a little overkill on the lemony flavor. Main course was the smoked duck benedict dish and the salmon benedict, good reports on both of those also! Will be coming back to try a couple other things for sure."], ["Kelly C.", "Summary: Beautiful space with friendly, attentive staff and deliciously flavored meals. A great concept for a restaurant in this generation--no tipping required. I love the idea that the owners are giving their staff a living wage and benefits to boot. (Tip anyway! Everything is great!)I visited with a party of three others on Girard's second night open--11/22/14. The entire place was running like a well-oiled machine, which can be suprising for a place that just opened. The only hiccup of our visit was that there seemed to be some kind of misunderstanding for my friends order with the waitress... But I have to chalk it up to it being the restaurants second day.I ordered a prixe fix meal because it was a great deal-- App, meal, dessert for fair price. I had celery soup to start--the flavor was amazing and not what I was expecting. It tasted like amazing thanksgiving day stuffing somehow. There was not a drop left in my bowl. I had the roast beef as my main--very tender--and the horseradish sauce was amazing. For dessert I had the chocolate tart. It was very good! But if you're not a huge fan of chocolate, I would either share it or get a different dessert as its one of those chocolate desserts that leaves you full after a few spoonfuls.The rest of my party savored and \u00a0enjoyed their food as well. We all tried \u00a0a little of each other's. The avocado toast was sooo good! The flavors are so tasty--it was even a little spicy. The burger was amazing and the potatoes are so so good! I've been craving the burger and potatoes since we've been there. The philly muffin the burger comes on is so nice and crusty. I also tried my wife's pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was amazing. It was smooth and light. We all also shared a charcuterie plate--amazing!!I can't wait to return to try their breakfast foods--they're served all day! The atmosphere was lovely: the decor is modern--I like the yellow and black color palette. The space is cozy, but you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other diners--which I hate.

For a $60 brunch tab I expect the kitchen staff to put on a hairnet. The other hygiene issue which my girlfriend pointed out was one chef was texting the going back to work without washing her hands. I am imagining them texting with that phone on the trolly right after holding the nasty rail.Other than hygiene however, I was impressed by the food. I wasn't blown away because it was trying to seem exotic but when you break down the dishes its kind of ordinary often inexpensive ingredients. The execution was on point though and they showed creativity in how the ingredients were paired. I liked the pistachio butter and banana sandwich the best. I was underwhelmed actually by the pistachio butter - i thought it would be more catchy - but the sandwich pulled it off by being fried and the bananas were fried too and there was a side of dipping syrup that was good. I also had the Quinoa for my main course and it was good but it couldve used more of the additives like poached egg or berries and less of the quinoa. My girlfriend had the eggs Benedict with salmon but it couldve used some pickled red onion on it.Overall a lot of just slightly missed marks. Good meal though."], ["Jill R.", "This place never disappoints me.

Very little filler, if any, and just an overall really yummy taste. For the main course, I had the vegetable mezze plate, which was beyond words.

It was an absolute pleasure learning about every ingredients origin, how it was prepared, and the history of the silverware I was using. Best whiskey sour I've had in this city. Incredible appetizers. Charming atmosphere. My favorite Passyunk venue."], ["Mike W.", "My wife got a big promotion at work, so I wanted to take her somewhere special to celebrate. Townsend was at the top of my list of places to try, so I figured this was the perfect opportunity to give it a go. We arrived and were taken to the back of the restaurant space to our table. I have to say it was one of the most quiet restaurants I have been in in philly in recent memory. We were actually able to converse easily without being hard of hearing from the noise of other parties. We ordered up a few cocktails to begin. Both were expertly crafted and very tasty. I had the silent alarm, bourbon, Benedictine, lagavulin, maple shrub and lemon bitters, and my wife grabbed the color me criminal, a concoction of generver, rose, Campari, grapefruit, lemon and club soda.The ingredients were high quality and you could tell them were made by a deft hand. I'm always a sucker for a big hunk of ice in my glass as well. It melts properly and prevents the drink from getting to watery while still keeping it nice and chilled.The menu is laid out well, with great options for all courses. We decided to do two appetizers, an entree each and one dessert. It was the perfect amount of food for us as the portions are not overly large. We started with the beef tartare and the escargots. While my wife is not a huge fan of tartares, I found this one delightful. As rich as it was, the meat was chopped to the pefect size, seasoned beautifully and paired extremely well with the charred bread it was served with. The escargots were extremely different than any preparation I have had elsewhere at other French restaurants, but they were spectacular. They were served with fava beans and in a bacon creme fraiche that was stunning. The sauce was addicting and the snails were super tender. THe preparation was great because it really lightened up and otherwise heavy dish when its prepared normally.For our mains, I was shocked when my wife ordered the chicken entree they had, but was super happy about it because it sounded delicious. I went with the rabbit pot-au-feu. Both were really complex and interesting preparations of the animals and they were both beautifully presented. With the rabbit, we got a roulade made with the loin, braised rabbit and a rabbit liver mouse. It came in a beautifully flavored broth that was both rich in flavor and super tasty. Her chicken dish also featured a beautifully cooked chicken breast, leg and a stuffed paillard of sorts wrapped in proscuitto. It was served with a chicken jus, artichokes and carrots. The entire dish was a hit with us. The execution was perfection. I especially loved the paillard. It was super tender and moist and it had great seasoning from the ham. I always look for souffl\u00e9s on the menu of French restaurants and it's rare that I actually find them, but as soon as I saw the chocolate souffl\u00e9 on town sends menu, I knew we had to get it. It came with a cannel of goat cheese ice cream that was perfectly paired with the crusty and gooey souffl\u00e9. It was an outstanding preparation. Sometimes with souffl\u00e9s they can get eggy if they aren't cooked correctly, but this could not have been cooked anymore properly. A stellar end to a fantastic meal.This was one of the better meals I have had recently. The food was expertly prepared, and although I found it a bit pricey, I would glady go back anytime to eat or drink, or both.

First water service and then bread service promptly thereafter.The bread service was nothing to write home about. \u00a0In fact, the most memorable thing about the bread service was the stainless steel basket it was served in. \u00a0The bread...not so memorable however. \u00a0With the exceedingly high quality of the other components of the meal, I was actually surprised the good people at Townsend did not step this part of the meal up a notch.For the first course we both got the Andalusian Gazpacho. Basil Oil and Croutons. \u00a0Fantastic. Well chilled and the tomatoes were so fresh. \u00a0The basil leaves while adding some flavor I could have done without. \u00a0Maybe strain them through the soup and leave them out next time. \u00a0I'd rather have a hint of basil than get full basil leaves stuck in my mouth. \u00a0Just my preference though.My second course was the Potato Gnocchi. \u00a0Roasted beech mushrooms, oven dried tomatoes, caramelized onion, thyme. Well done. No complaints here. \u00a0Perfectly executed.My uncle got the Jumbo Lump Crab Risotto. \u00a0Truffle asparagus Salad. \u00a0Pretty tasty as well. I will say the portion sizes were not the largest however. \u00a0But three courses and a dessert later, I found myself pretty well satiated.Rabbit Pot-au-Feu. \u00a0Loin Roulade, braised rabbit, carrots, potatoes. Our server informed us this was the chef's favorite dish to prepare. I was pleasantly surprised at how tender the dish came out. \u00a0Rabbit tends to be on the drier side of meats, so this was a nice treat. \u00a0Pot-au-Feu is a French beef stew and the loin roulade is the center piece of the dish with a wonderful creamy filling.For the main course, my uncle got the roasted organic chicken. Leg Galantine, speck, artichoke barigoule, carrots, lemon. A galantine is a French dish of de-boned stuffed meat, most commonly poultry or fish, that is poached and served cold, coated with aspic.For dessert, I got my standard creme-brulee. I have had creme brulee at at least 20 restaurants so I consider myself a bit of an expert. \u00a0Well executed, perfectly torched, and the creme was of decent consistency. \u00a0A well executed dessert.For dessert my uncle got the lemon torte which was a nice finish to his meal. \u00a0We both polished off our desserts in no time.Of Note:My cocktail of the night the Hotel Nacional: white rum, apricot liquor, pineapple, lemon, lime, angostura bitters. \u00a0Fantastic. Must try."], ["G C.", "Yum! What a place. The menu is great, and you can find animals from the air to the sea to the land here. The foie gras was very delicious, one of the best i've ever tasted. Was interested in the sweetbread, so we ordered it. It's a gland of a cow i think, and it's interesting. a bit more salty than i prefer. The boiled oyster was sooo good. It's served on a bed of salt so don't try to taste it. The escargot was also good. For the main we shared the branzino which helped breakdown all the rich food we have been eating before. Very well made. Dessert was the chocolate souffle which was excellent. It takes a bit more time to make--just 10 min more.

They even wrote \"Happy Anniversary\" on the menu, which was a nice touch, along with a glass of champagne while we were looking over the menu. The service was phenomenal and the waitresses were great. Someone was always around to check the water and bring more bread, clear plates quickly, etc. The food was absolutely fantastic. This isn't a restaurant that you will want to come to if you're starving and just want a huge plate of food. This is all about the taste and creativity. We had crab risotto and gnocchi to start and both were very good, although the gnocchi was pretty basic. We also had the rabbit and duck for our entrees and they were both amazing. The rabbit came 3 ways and each were very tasty and different and each bite was just amazing. Another thing I wanted to mention was the bread and butter! Wow, so good. Just simple bread and butter but the butter was absolutely delicious. We had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert and honestly it was just ok. Nothing that will blow your socks off and it was very pudding like in the middle, only a small top layer of traditional souffl\u00e9 textured dessert. It was still good, but just not wow.

I think their food menu changes pretty often so can't recommend anything in particular, but have to say everything was done with PERFECTION.

The restaurant is on the smaller end so it may be harder to get reservations for large parties. I would definitely recommend booking a reservation. The place was pretty packed on a Friday night.

I easily made reservations through OpenTable for dinner time about 2 weeks ahead. We live in the area so it was a short walk to East Passyunk Avenue. They may have valet parking service in the front and depending on the week night, you may be able to find metered parking along the avenue. There is a bar area in the front and there is a second dining room upstairs where the bathroom is also located.It was a relatively slow night as there weren't many tables filled while we dined. A romantic setting with a table by the window where you can look across at Capogiro patrons and in the back you can see the kitchen staff go up and down the spiral staircase. We placed our drink orders and I got to sample their delicious cocktails while my date drank red wine. We were served bread and butter which was good. I would prefer bread that was a little warm. It was nothing worth raving about. But we were asked if we would like more, which was nice.First course was the foie gras which was DEEELICIOUS! I always order foie gras when I can, despite feeling guilty about it. It's just SO GOOD. The apricot topping really worked well. The oysters and hamachi were also very good.Second course I picked the escargot which I also highly recommend. The bacon sauce it was served in really complemented the dish. I notice that the chef is particularly skilled in dishes where the flavors blend together really well. The scallops were also quite tasty and served with a corn veggie mix.My entree was the skate which was nice and light with a nice sear. It was served with corn as well. This is great because I happen to absolutely love corn. By this time I was already full! For dessert, we shared a chocolate souffle which was piping hot and incredibly rich in flavor.Overall, it was a great experience! Our server was incredibly knowledgable about everything on the menu and was catered to all of our needs. I can go on and on about how great the food is here, I only wish I could visit more often. Great place to celebrate a special, intimate occasion with friends and family."], ["Abby W.", "Simply fantastic. This space used to be Sophia's and I was heartbroken when they closed, but delighted to hear such a stellar restaurant had opened in its place. I came here on Saturday evening with my boyfriend for a well-deserved splurge after a day of moving and couldn't have been more satisfied with the choice.I had a cocktail with bourbon, amontillado, and pineapple syrup called the Bizzy Izzy that was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It was sparkling and refreshing with a very unique flavour-profile. I don't typically go for bourbon but I was very pleased with it. I continued the theme of trying things I don't usually like by ordering the broiled oysters for my starter. I hate raw oysters because the texture skeeves me out, but the broiled preparation was absolute perfection, with tiny cubes of bacon and fennel plus spinach and a pernod cream. They were fantastic. My boyfriend went with the special smoked salmon carpaccio and it was also really excellent - very fresh and light. We skipped the second course in favour of saving room for dessert, plus it was too hot of a day to be that full. I had the speck-wrapped icelandic cod and he went with the rabbit. The cod was perfectly cooked and a very light dish. I could have asked for a little more oomph in the tomato broth, like a bit of spice or something, but I have been suffering from allergies lately and it's entirely possible I just didn't have my taste buds in full working order. I followed my cocktail with a glass of rose on special that night and it was an excellent pairing with the fish. His rabbit was absolutely heavenly. That sauce! I could have licked the plate.The dessert selection is minimal - only 3 options - but the two we tried were truly exemplary. I had the creme brulee, a very standard rendition but expertly done. He got the pavlova and really loved it, it was a really special dessert and an unusual option one doesn't often see. A table nearby got the chocolate souffle and it's aroma filled the room; it smelled so good!Service was impeccable, and the meal was well-paced. We enjoyed our requested table in front of the window on the second floor, which makes for spectacular people-watching along the Avenue. The bill was also surprisingly reasonable (which was fortunate because I was having technical difficulties getting my Opentable gift certificate to load and I gave up!), only $123 after tax for 2 drinks and 3 courses each.My single complaint is that I wish the menu had been a bit more seasonal. Many of the courses sounded heavy and \"wintry\" and I wish they had updated it more to bring in some of the spring season. There were a handful of dishes with seasonal ingredients, but the entree selection in particular leaned heavily toward bold and comforting dishes with few lighter options."], ["Bri H.", "I was lucky enough to be taken to Townsend for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint! First of all, I loved the cozy feel of the place. \u00a0Service was perfect. \u00a0I ordered a cocktail that I didn't really like. \u00a0I took a sip, (apparently) made a \"yuck\" face, then tasted my friend's cocktail and (apparently) made a happy face. The server came over to say that she noticed my facial expressions and was having the bartender make me a new drink! Now THAT is great service. The server was also able to pick out a great wine to go with my dinner based on what I like (dry, bold).The food was great too. \u00a0Beef tartare was delicous (although Vernick is still my favorite). \u00a0Poached halibut was tender & flavorful.

Of the 3 courses, I think this was my favorite. \u00a0For the 3rd course, my speck (bacon) wrapped cod was also really good but I think I liked my friend's braised halibut a bit more, which was perfectly moist w/ a side of \u00a0kohlrabhi, which was much tastier than any kohlrabhi I've ever had. \u00a0 Also, leave room for the chocolate souffle which was divine!This was a wonderful dining experience, and I will definitely be returning again!"], ["Hana C.", "I took a couple friends who were visiting me from DC. \u00a0We started with the hamachi, tartare, and gazpacho all of which were good. I had mentioned to the restaurant that one of my friends is a chef at Blue Duck Tavern and I believe for this reason they sent out a complimentary app, the oysters--a thoughtful touch that I greatly appreciated. By far the oysters (grilled? with pancetta?) were the best plate out of the three with the tartare coming in second. For our second courses I had the scallops and my friends had the escargot and the sweatbread. The scallops were perfect. I wish the escargot was more flavorful. For some reason they fell flat and I'm not sure why. I did not try the sweetbreads; I was trying not to be greedy but I wish I had--I love sweetbreads. My friends had no complaints in regards to the sweetbreads and I believe finished it all. For our final course I had the skate, my friends had the rabbit and swordfish. I thought the rabbit roulade was a little over cooked but my friend thought it was balanced well with the ingredients in the center of the roulade. She must have liked it because she finished it all. Her boyfriend stated he enjoyed the swordfish which was a huge helping and he felt so bad he could not finish it. I thought the skate was just a little over cooked but it was still a delicious and well balanced dish. We had no room for dessert at that point. Service was excellent. Each of our cocktails were well done and very tasty. The waitress was quite helpful with the wine list and the Vouvray she picked for me was delicious. The ambience is quiet, simple, and intimate. The space obviously was a home in its past life and gives a more comfortable feel to the relatively fancy food (you're not coming here if you're \u00a0craving burgers or pizza). I will come again with my husband who has been wanting to come here for some time. And I would recommend it to any one looking for a nice meal out in Philly."], ["Daniel P.", "The two of us went for a date night on a Thursday. It's a nice space, and the service was attentive and friendly. I don't have anything negative to say about the food - it was all well prepared and lovely. The menu is set in \"first, second, and third\" course sections and we got one dish each, from each section (for a total of four small plates and two larger ones). Oysters were probably the low point but still good - the hamachi was a high point, as was the roast chicken... among the best chicken I've had.The downside, to me, is what I feel is a common facet of dining out in Philadelphia: the web site describes the wine selection as \"value driven\" while the least expensive bottle on the list is $60 (there might have been one selection in the $50's, but I'm not sure). I like good wine and it is a shame that the vast majority of selections were more toward the $70-90 range. For the food and two glasses of wine each, the total after 20% tip was $200. Good, but not a repeat for us."], ["Sebastian H.", "Ok. I will get right to it since there is plenty of food to talk about! ;) we decided to start with the broiled oysters and the hamachi apps. The starving kid in me instantly grabbed an oyster. I clearly should've tried they hamachi first, which was served in a marinade of cucumber, sesame, lime, and cilantro. Delicate, clean, and a delicious way to prep your pallet for what's in store. The oysters are broiled with spinach, bacon, and a Pernod cream sauce. They serve 4 per order. I will just say this. We instantly ordered another round. YUM! For the 2nd course we had the jumbo lump crab risotto and the saut\u00e9ed sweetbreads. The risotto was my lady's first or second favorite of the night. It was creamy and cooked to perfection. The sweetbreads were served with a potato aligote, olives, and oven dried tomato Proven\u00e7al. This was one of my favorites for the night. Neither of us like olives, but they just played part of a delicious harmony in this dish. Again, everything was cooked perfectly. Sweetbreads were slightly crispy on the outside and soft and tender inside. Perfection. \u00a0Finally we had the duck breast and the rabbit pot-au-feu (stew). The rabbit loin was served in a roulade over braised rabbit with carrots and potatoes. This is where the technique of French cooking shines. They managed to transform a traditional family dish that essentially is a stew and elevate it to much greater proportions. Another success. The duck breast was was cooked to perfection and served with a cassoulet of white beans and a port reduction. \u00a0For dessert we had to chocolate souffl\u00e9 and the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. From start to finish this meal was well prepared, presented, and quickly devoured!! Go eat at Townsend. ENJOY!!!"], ["Jordan P.", "I've always been a little wary of restaurant week. My inner cheapskate breaks down the numbers of the restaurants offering everything from special dishes to old favorites to one-off dessert experiments, and weighs this with my typical levels of hunger. Most often, the result is a decisive Nahh, I'll just wait for the crowds to die down and order the exact amount of food I want for the price I expect/am willing to pay. That said, when I saw that East Passyunk Avenue, Philly's hottest nook of up-and-coming dining spots, was hosting their own neighborhood restaurant week, I immediately raced over to OpenTable to make a reservation for my two girlfriends and I. I gotta say that, while I was A-OK with the mandatory phone-in reservation at Zahav a few weeks ago, there's a remarkable ease and convenience to being able to filter using number of diners, date, and time when we were looking for a Monday night out on the town. We spotted space at Townsend and booked it post-haste.We made the right choice.Since there were three of us, we figured we'd try one of each course. Then we saw that one of the first courses was a foie gras butternut squash terrine. And since I'd just binged on terrines last week.... looks like we're doubling up on Brandades!Course one (served shortly after a DIVINE bread basket [that may have been divine or may have merely been 'good', we were pretty hungry]) included a creamy parsnip veloute with brown butter chestnuts, a hint of black truffle, and just enough brussels sprout leaves to leave us wanting more (hee hee). The brandade, a dish I'd never had before, was a crunchy brioche topped with a quail egg, shellfish bouillabaisse, and pernod. How such a tiny little toasty brioche could be so full of flavor.... well I don't (per)nod, but it was incredible. The veloute was rich and creamy, a nice complement to the light fluff and crunch of the other appetizer. But the best was yet to come...I'll shoot you straight, the pasta/vegetarian dish was a little cold by the time it got to us. Flavor-wise, it was fairly unremarkable, and the tastes of caramelized onions and fennel, while there, were hints. If you were only getting this dish, I would not consider your experience worthwhile. BUT if you're lucky enough to have some dining pals, perhaps they'll slip you bites of the glorious speck-wrapped cod (bottom right) atop Tarbais bean garbure with tiny cockles (that came with their own fork!) This fish fell apart the moment your fork touched it, delicate... dare I say exquisite?Oh, if I dared, I'll repeat that word for the venison en crepinette (different from the online menu, description here). Exquisite. We nearly came to (fork) blows over these half-dollar sized medallions, each soaking up the jus and pairing perfectly with the parsnip pure\u00e9. This dish would bring me back again and again.Somehow, we had room for dessert. Luckily, it was both light and a delight.The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, flawless. Visible vanilla bean is my jam. The blue cheese plate was a nice tangy option for those without a sweet tooth. And for those WITH a sweet tooth: enter pavlova. No, she's not your exotic, sexy neighbor (maybe she is, I don't know where you live). She is actually an it, specifically a crunchy meringue dish topped with mixed berries and strawberry coulis, speckled with fresh mint.Yup. Imagine the finest cotton candy you can even fathom. And then make it fancy, and French, and bury it in berries. We couldn't get enough.Take your dates, your dads, your dudes, your dames, yourself, take them all to Townsend. I'll be back soon to try out their take on rabbit.... I've only heard (read* since I practically live on Yelp) the best things.Thanks, Tod and team, for the tasty treats."], ["Jonathan D.", "Went here with my parents last night. I didn't know much about it, other than that they had gone once before and had enjoyed it and thought I'd like it. Townsend didn't disappoint. We lucked out to find a meter right out front (only $1/hr, which is great!), and in we went. The building appears to be a former townhouse/row home that's been stylishly renovated. There is a bar downstairs, along with a dining area set back from it, and then an upstairs dining area. The stairs are somewhat steep if you're older (a little challenging for my mom, but she managed). The upstairs dining room is lovely, light and airy. Service is attentive, knowledgeable and enthusiastic in a friendly but not obtrusive way. Our primary server in particular was fantastic and engaging, and ready to answer any question.But as I often say, if the food isn't up to par, none of those things matter. Luckily, the food was stellar. The menu is divided into two courses of appetizers and then the mains. It's not huge, but since everything is appealing, that was just fine. I started with hamachi, which was chopped into small cubes and served in a little \"brick\" with cucumber, sesame, lime, cilantro and other accoutrements. It was delicious, as were my parents' oysters with fennel (which came with a wonderful creamy sauce). We also shared an even better beef tartare, which was extremely well-seasoned and came with parmesan topped crostini. Wonderful. While my parents opted for the duck, which I (and they) enjoyed, particularly with its lovely vegetable accompaniments, I was even more delighted with my swordfish. Before I ordered it, our server told me that people marveled at how moist it was, and she was not wrong. It was extraordinarily moist, perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful (bit of a Mediterranean vibe), accompanied by pearl onions, asparagus and an asparagus puree. Foodgasm is an overused term, but this truly was. We finished by sharing a pair of desserts, a Vahlrona chocolate souffle (yum!), and a lemon curd, which doesn't remotely do justice to the delicious combination fresh fruits, pastry and lemon cream.Townsend isn't a cheap date (especially with wine), but it truly is a superb restaurant that I'd return to in a heartbeat."], ["Elizabeth T.", "Exquisite food and service. The hamachi was over the top. The quality of the Tina was mind boggling. The presentation was spectacular. The best chicken I have ever had bar none.

PS loup de mer is the same thing as branzino, European sea bass, whatever but sounds so much nicer this way, doesn't it? \u00a0Yeah, it's just what they call it on the French Mediterranean coast.Chocolate souffle - 15 minute wait for this but of course it's worth it. \u00a0Only complaint - not a huge fan of the cream they serve with this, kind of like regular old vanilla ice cream so you can mix it with the warm center, make a gooey mess then eat it. \u00a0Maybe that's low brow but if you don't enjoy melting ice cream on warm chocolate cake then f*ck you you're lying.Service was totally fine, no issues there from us. \u00a0Wine I had tasted rather young (forget which it was) but that's likely my fault and I'm not a regular enough wine drinker to have that sway you, please. \u00a0Overall a very pleasant meal."], ["Charles R.", "The gnocchi appetizer, although nicely presented was too salty.

Megin - VrMan XLnt!! One of the BEST meals EVER.Sublime , la d\u00e9monstration classique et moderne de la gastronomie Fran\u00e7aise.I have literally just returned from Townsend and I must write this review.For my second birthday dinner this weekend, I chose Townsend and while I had initial reservations about the compact menu but I saw enough on the menu that the two of us would want to try for dinner. I am SO HAPPY that I went ahead with the plans to dine at Townsend. \u00a0It was a perfect - a truly perfect - experience from beginning to end.We were greeted warmly and seated promptly upon arrival at table 34 (tucked into the bay window) on the second floor of Townsend. \u00a0The immediate ambiance was calm, elegant and understated yet warm and welcoming.Megin was our server and she was phenomenal. \u00a0Knowledgeable, pleasant, professional and engaging, truly someone who know what she is doing and knew everything about the food and drink menu (including the cheese plate designations of P, R & T) that is offered at Townsend.We started with a couple of Townsend's signature cocktails - I had the 'Bizzy Izzy Highball' at Megin's recommendation and it was refreshing and yummy. \u00a0I could have a pitcher of them on a lazy Sunday. \u00a0My partner had the Pimms Cup and loved it. \u00a0I am not a gin drinker but I could have had a pitcher of these too...!! \u00a0I think the ginger syrup and lemon really smoothed out the Christmas tree taste I normally get from gin and made it magnificent.For dinner, I had the Cidre Bouch\u00e9 Fermier de Normandie (a favorite) and next time I will try a bottle of the Isastegi Sagardo Basque Cider. \u00a0As a cider drinker, I was thrilled to see these on the drink menu.For my first course, I had the Beef Tartare. A very generous portion of fresh, quality beef, perfectly minced and seasoned. \u00a0It was served with Idiazabal toast which gave a feathery umami kiss to every bite - delicious. \u00a0There was enough for two of us to enjoy although I would have had no trouble polishing off the whole thing.My dining partner had the marinated Hamachi and it was also delicious. \u00a0I do not have any raw fish outside of Japan as a rule; but at the insistence of my dining partner; I had a taste and I could have eaten an entire portion of this myself too! \u00a0Fresh, touched with sesame oil with a furikake finish that seems so perfect and makes such sense that you wonder why it isn't a common pairing.My second course was the foie gras mousse with pear-ginger marmalade. \u00a0VrMan XLnt! \u00a0vraiment excellent!! \u00a0Foie gras mousse perfection. \u00a0Again, plenty to share if you are so inclined.My dining partner had the sweetbreads and they were cooked perfectly - slightly caramelized crisp outside and creamy soft juicy inside. \u00a0The accompaniments of parsnip puree, pearl onion soubise and the truffle madeira jus were spot on. \u00a0I think my dining partner would have licked the plate clean if he could have!In between the second and third course, we added the handmade gnocchi special with tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. \u00a0Pillowy, light, gnocchi in a beautiful bit of pan sauce accented with some sage (?) roasted cherry tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. \u00a0We devoured it.For my entr\u00e9e (normally the third dish, but my fourth), I had the lamb en cocotte - again, recommended by M. Megin. \u00a0Beautiful dish, an updated, elevated cocotte dish with lamb two ways. \u00a0Lamb loin roasted and thin sliced and the lamb shoulder braised (en cocotte) with the most unlikely cocotte-fellows of plum/plumcot, zuchchini, squash, apples and saba. \u00a0Incroyable!My dining partner had the Rabbit pot-au-feu and it was actually a rabbit roasted loin roulade and braised rabbit with a liver mousse crostini amongst the diced carrots and potatoes. \u00a0I just cannot eat rabbit (no, not even taste it!) and so I had to take my dining partner's word that it was indeed a superb dish. \u00a0We ended with coffee and dessert, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the pavlova. \u00a0Both were perfectly executed. \u00a0Townsend's cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is the one I like to make at home. \u00a0Thin, silky cream base, flecked with real vanilla and a crispy, crackly burnt (actually carmelized - not burnt) crust which was garnished with strawberry and blueberries. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0The pavlova was equally perfectly executed - beautiful snow white meringue with a crisp exterior and light as air interior floating on a pool of strawberry sauce lightly accented with pernod. \u00a0To execute such a perfect pavlova in 72% humidity is the work of someone who know what they are doing.Mademoiselle Megin - mr6 (merci) thank you for a thoroughly enjoyable evening! \u00a0Chef Wentz - thank you for an amazing meal - vraiment superbe!!"], ["Doug H.", "I thought this place was good, but not great.

We had the Gnocchi, rabbit, fois grois, risotto, and oysters. I tried all of them and, while they were all good none wowed me. I can live with trying five dishes and only a couple are very good to amazing but none really knocked my socks off. I wanted to love it but I thought the food should be on another level.

Price was not bad, we each spent $50 but didn't get any alcohol. Highly recommend this place!!! Good for foodies, date nights, parents. Not recommended for big groups since the space is pretty small.

We selected the swordfish and skate wing and both of our fish dishes were cooked perfectly. \u00a0We thoroughly enjoyed both dishes and the contrast between the two types of fish. \u00a0The steak-like swordfish was meaty and the accompaniments showcased this. \u00a0The skatewing was lighter and its sides set this off. \u00a0Both were A+ dishes."], ["Lindsay H.", "Another fantastic addition to South Philly! Some lady friends and I had enough listening to all the buzz about Townsend and finally decided it was time to go and thankfully, we were not disappointed. First off, the place is adorable. Cozy and casual yet elegant. Lovely. My other first impression was the immediate fantastic service. We were greeted immediately and our server was over quick providing suggestions, etc regarding the drink menu. She even brought us a Rose to taste without even asking. Nice touch! We decided to try a few apps and all got entrees but what I particularly love about my dinner dates is that we're all happy to share so I got to taste many items on the menu. I love being able to try a lot! The highlights for me were the hamachi, beef tartare, the duck, the skate and the cod. Just about everything we ordered of course. :) The menu seems to change a lot so hopefully some of these will stay on! The hamachi was so light and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer night. The beef tartare was combined with bone marrow. Nuff said on that one. It was like butter. On to the mains....the cod fell apart the second your fork hit it and rest on top of a lovely tomato broth. Then, onto the duck... I have to be honest...I can't remember the details anout the dish but I just remember it being rich, perfectly cooked and delicious. :) Lastly, we tried the skate wing which was again perfectly cooked with peas, lardon and a lemony broth. The perfect combinations with skate. To sum it up, YES! Yes yes yes. I really loved Townsend and honestly can not wait to get back asap!"], ["Eric W.", "Another great Philly restaurant. It seems to be a pattern here; a number of excellent restaurants, many of of which are BYOB, where it's great food in a really small place. While Townsend is not BYOB, although the wine list is eclectic, it's is a nice but small space. Not a drawback for me because I think it's a more intimate dining experience, but I do not know how the economics work for the restaurants. In any event, you chose a three course selection, where the biggest challenge is what gets left out. Not as big a problem if you come as a foursome but tough for two. We had the lobster and beef tartar, both were excellent. \u00a0Then we had the Brandade, which was stunning; followed by the lamb and rabbit- wow!! \u00a0Then a cheese course with Sherry followed by the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and coffee. What a great meal!! The wine list is challenging but we had a good red burgundy that was a perfect choice.

Chef Townsend Wentz is a genius and he makes some absolutely wonderful food. Dined there when it was Sophia's and wanted to like it so much but it just wasn't memorable. I am glad that it was replaced by a place like this that is a real addition to the neighborhood. If you went to Sophia's when it was open, the space will looks exactly the same. The menu is divided into 3 sections not including dessert and we went with 1 selection from each section. Started off with the marinated hamachi and the broiled east coast oysters with fennel. Both were exceptional, I have always been an oyster guy but these were just amazing, the addition of the pernod cream made them just silky smooth. The hamachi was equally as stunning, with the ingredients it was almost like a ceviche but one that hadn't been allowed to sit and \"cook\" yet the flavors were so fresh. Next on the to the seared sea scallops which were cooked perfectly and the addition of truffle is always welcome and the escargot and brussels sprouts \"mange tout\". This was the star of the show right here, the snails were perfect and the bacon-sherry creme fraiche they came in was just amazing and I made sure to sop every last drop up with the bread on the table. For entrees the artic char and the lamb en cocotte. Again everything was as close to perfect as it could be, the lamb though was just on another level. The loin was perfectly cooked and sliced very thin, the braised shoulder though stole the show. It was fall apart in your mouth tender and was just delicious there is no other word. Save room for dessert because you have to get the chocolate souffle here, I did and there was nothing else that I would even consider ordering. It was divine, rich, chocolately, soft, and crunchy all at the same time. It takes about 15 minutes for it to come out but it is worth the wait.

I know others at my table were thoroughly displeased with the meal (they ordered a dish they typically order at Bibou, so that's pretty stiff competition)I see this as a place where people go when they can't get a table at above mentioned spots...

Chef Townsend Wentz's roots show through in presenting dishes that on one level seem simplistic yet have a complex backbone. Four of us went there on a Sunday evening and the only blemish was a heavy hand with salt on the sweetbread second course (which I still completely scarfed up!). The appetizer of oysters with a hint of fennel was spot on; and I almost asked for seconds of the rabbit pot-au-feu main course. The reviews of the chocolate \u00a0 souffle are all correct - rich, not heavy sweet, and enough for the table to share.

On the other hand, bad food is not something I expected at a fine dining experience. I got the 3-course prix-fixe. Everything started well enough. \u00a0My first course of parsnip veloutte was rich, complex, sophisticated, tasty and exactly what one wants in a restaurant meal--something you could never replicate at home. Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there. First, they simply did not have the lamb which was the whole reason had made a reservation and driven across town. Lame. Second, the venison crepinette which I got instead (for a surcharge) was completely underwhelming. The cr\u00eape was of mysterious composition and added nothing to the deer medallions. But that was nothing compared to the simple, obvious, and disastrous mistake made in their preparation. The meat was simply over-salted. By A LOT. It was a bad rookie error and it made the entire course barely mediocre. But even *that* was no big deal compared to the dessert \"pavlova.\" That thing was an \u00a0inedible disaster. I enjoyed the accoutrements--a generous dollop of homemade whipped cream and a strawberry coulis (sauce) well enough--but the Pavlova itself was a vile insult to my palette. \u00a0I think it was made of a mixture of air-dried sugar and sawdust. \u00a0Instead of three(3) courses of fine dining, I got one(1) course of first class food and two(2) courses that ranged from bungled to utterly ill-conceived.

You do not find them on menus. A three course meal was in the offering. My wife ordered oysters that were broiled and she thought it was wonderful.I went with the beef tar tar. It was slightly spicy and sweet. It had bread with it. A wonderful balance of flavor. Although, the horseradish flavor began to overpower other flavors. But, it was wonderfully done. I went with a duck and pasta special for course number two. It was simply divine. Rustic meaty flavor that was broken up with sweetness of cherry tomato and goat cheese. I simply wished for more of the cheese and tomato in the course. The pasta was good and the duck cooked to perfection.My wife had a warm salad that she enjoyed. She especially liked mushrooms in it that were like meat to her. The main course, my wife had a halibut course that was a large portion. She enjoyed it. I ordered the lamb en cocotte course. It was lamb loin and shoulder. It was flavored well. Two applications with the lamb and two flavor profiles. I enjoyed the stewed in bowl with fruit and vegetables portion best. It was flavorful. The cut pieces of loin on the side was delicious with the sauce, but I found it slightly rubbery or chewy. I was not certain about that. On to dessert and a chocolate souffle. They prepared us well by indicating that it takes 15 minutes to cook. We were fine and shared this heavenly dessert of chocolate richness. It was well balanced with a cream on the side. A few things to mention, it is a quaint little location. The staff are helpful but not overly intrusive.I'd suggest curtains on the main floor dining room.

I've been drinking wine for a long time from all regions of the world. Their wine list has about 5 whites and 5 reds, and every one of them are from lesser traveled and less touted about vineyards and regions. All of the reds were sweet.

My only slight quibble with this lovely wintertime dish was that it was a bit aggressively salted for my taste~COAL ROASTED STURGEON: Onion Soubise, Miner's Lettuce, Red Wine Bouillon--It's a bit hard to describe how good this was (my #1), in fact I give up... \u00a0After a couple of red burgs with the rabbit, most of the table went back to white, but I thought this worked quite well with the reds~BANANA POT DE CREME: Not on the menu, but one of our group doesn't like chocolate (Oh, the humanity!)...I don't know if this was Tod's or Chris' creation, but it was mighty tasty and much appreciated.~GATEAU VICTOIRE: You had me at \"This is a Julia Child recipe\". \u00a0Dense, rich chocolate and contrasting textures, but a modernized presentation that I think Julia would still love.Wines:~1996 Bollinger Champagne La Grande Ann\u00e9e~2009 Simon Bize Savigny l\u00e8s Beaune~2007 Dom. du Ch\u00e2teau de Chorey (Germain) Beaune 1er Cru Les Cras~2011 Alain Hudelot Noellat Chambolle Musigny~NV Jean Bourdy C\u00f4tes du Jura Galant des Abesses--From one of the oldest wineries in the world, an unusual and rare wine, not even really a wine, made from grape must boiled down with 25 secret spices and fortified with old Marc (recipe dates to 1579)Service, as always at Will, was perfect (thanks Eric & Gustavo), and at the end we made a quick visit to the small kitchen which was packed with 2 or 3 more cooks than usually squeeze in.I have to say that I was extremely impressed with Tod's cooking, which certainly epitomized the concept of wine-friendly foods. Combined with Lauren Harris' wine-pairing expertise, Townsend is something for Philly wine lovers to really look forward too...[Unnecessary rant: Too often, in Philly's BYOB-centric, sommelier-less restaurant scene, chefs spend little or no thought on how or even if their food can be paired with wine, despite the fact that most of their guests are bringing some with them. \u00a0I wish more restaurants would follow the lead of Talula's Table in making wine pairing suggestions ahead of time (which means they have actually thought about it when designing their menu).Food without wine is like sex without... well it's like masturbation!] NOTE: This was the first in a series of collaborative dinner's that Will is doing with some noted Philly chefs: March 13: Ben Puchowitz of CHeU Noodle BarMarch 20: Mike Santoro of The MildredMarch 27: Greg Vernick of Vernick Food + DrinkAll are five courses for $70 (Vernick is sold out).philly.com/philly/blogs/\u2026"], ["Mommy G.", "Recently returned from a trip to Provence in France and needed a French fix. This was outstanding and updated French cooking - We thought divine. Oysters and Hamachi first course were outstanding. We ordered the special foie gras to share for middle course, outstanding French style roasted chicken and my husband loved the dual preparation lamb cassoulet. \u00a0We initially were not sure we wanted to go when we saw the limited list of entrees..... but, \u00a0there are so many other delectable choices in addition listed under the first two courses, you may not even need to order an entree. \u00a0Dessert was Valrhona chocolate souffle - we visited the Valrhona \u00a0factory and store in Tain L'Hermitage on the Rhone river, and brought some of their amazing chocolate home - so happy to see this on the menu - best chocolate souffle ever.The bill was quite expensive though once you add in some cocktails and glasses of wine and very expensive wine list. I would not try to order a conventional cocktail - that is not their thing. We did not like our Manhattan or whiskey sour (yes I recently started to drink them - they are hip again) \u00a0and they were very small. My only comment to the restaurant would be to hire a decorator - we sat on second floor which is a lovely space but it is screaming out for some COLOR - so tentative and bordering on drab...I could see some large paintings with big red poppies for example - a punch of color in the timid black white and beige stuff that is already there. Curtains look too amateur and home-made also.There is a large cabinet where the wait staff gets plates and such, \u00a0and the large door practically hits the unlucky customer sitting near to it - easy fix - change that single door to two French doors that swing out from the middle... Not sure why they have not thought of that.On the plus side - they do NOT SQUOOSH the tables together and you can speak to your dining partners and not be on top of other people. This is easily equal to Bibou - do not agree with other poster that stated otherwise. Among the best in the city in our opinion and we dine out a lot in Philly and abroad.I do feel badly for the wait staff - they have to continually go up and down three flights of stairs - owner needs to install a dumb waiter or elevator for them at least. \u00a0They do not need a gym membership."], ["Margeau N.", "This was literally one of the best meals I've ever had!

Townsend was my first, and I have to say, if it is a portent of things to come, I really think that Philadelphia has crafted itself as a major food destination among the powerhouses of the US. That's not to say that it was perfect. We arrived early just prior to Valentine's day, right around second seating. We were told that it wouldn't be possible to seat us early, but we were able to camp out at the bar while we waited.Townsend is very clearly a renovated house, turned into a restaurant. This is not the first time that I have been into something of the sort, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed it as much. The small bar in front, set into the old house gave a Prohibitionist vibe. The cocktails were priced fairly standard for a high end restaurant, which usually tends to be a bit over, but they were tasty and packed a wallop. We were seated more or less on time. First course was salt baked oysters and beef tartare. The tartare was the winner by far, as it was a well balanced dish which had some good meatiness to it. The oysters were tasty, but very light and were gulped down greedily in no time at all, with little to leave you.In my opinion, the second course was the best. My date got the escargot and I the sweetbreads. For one, I have to give credit for doing hard to find French dishes. The escargot wasn't overly chewy (as I've seen many times) and the sprouts made it nicely earthy. For me, the star of the show was the sweetbreads. The breading added some nice texture, and the truffle jus and vegetable puree tied really, well well into the intrinsic flavor and combined with the protein for a wonderfully umami symphony. I would come back for that alone.We shared the rabbit pot a feu, and that was the most divisive dish. My date loved every bit. For me, the roulades were crispy bits of perfection, but the braised rabbit and vegetables definitely needed seasoning.We each shared the creme brulee and chocolate souffle, which were solid desserts, but nothing to wax poetic about.Service was pretty good. Our waitron was attentive but not overbearing, and was useful when we decided to hash out what to order. There was a noticeable lag between courses, but again, this was during prime time: Friday night, prior to Valentine's day weekend, and the small place was packed.Overall, I think there were some rough moments, but the overall quality was high, and the fact that they do things that few places in the city will do makes this a destination worth visiting.4.5 stars, erring to 5 on rounding."], ["Jennifer L.", "My boyfriend and I had a \"date night\" at Izumi last Friday night then as we were walking home, we spotted Townsend. We decided to stop in just for a drink since we had already eaten.It turned out it was the first night that the restaurant was open to the public. It was a soft opening so it wasn't crowded. It's a nice space -- warm lighting, a bar made from gorgeous wood (reclaimed maybe?) and great service. We each had a cocktail and you could tell the bartenders took their jobs seriously. They were easy to talk to as well and seemed happy that we were there. The manager, Lauren, came over and chatted with us for a while, which was great. She explained that the concept is French, which is unique for East Passyunk Ave.My boyfriend and I are both vegetarians but most of the upscale places on EPA are geared toward those who eat meat. That makes perfect sense since most people do eat meat. And there are usually a couple of things I could find to order, but they're not necessarily things I particularly want to eat. It sounds like Townsend will fall into the \"I could probably find something on the menu there\" type of place rather than a spot that has thoughtful menu items that vegetarians would truly enjoy.But that's okay. I would stop in for drinks again just because the staff was so friendly and welcoming.

The cuisine was imaginative, flavorful, brave, and delicious. Our experience was only furthered by the knowledge and kindness of our server, Steven R. We started with the oysters, they were incredibly delicious. In fact, they were so good I had no time to stop and take a photo. The same could be said for the deliciously fresh bread and clearly homemade butter. We also got the escargot with Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, speck, & a cream sauce. It was delicious, the sauce was amazing. The second course was the lobster and shrimp mousse; I was concerned it was going to be too gastronomic, but it was absolutely perfect. For the third course, I got the lamb. I personally preferred the sliced rare lamb on my plate as opposed to the stewed lamb with the fruit that came along with it. However, my dining companion preferred that so it's entirely subjective. We finished our meal with the chocolate souffle, which was incredible. Definitely give it at least 5 minutes to cool off! I couldn't wait, so burning my tongue was completely my own fault. Best drink I had was the champagne, it is crisp and uniquely delicious. It's a pricey meal, but a dining experience you won't soon forget."], ["Eileen T.", "Our reservation was made weeks before the restaurant received a James Beard Foundation nomination for best new restaurant, but our dinner last night made apparent why it was nominated.We were told our table would be ready in a few minutes, and two seats had just become available at the bar, so we decided to have our aperitif there. The bartenders were charming and very helpful. We prefer to dine at the bar when we can; it provides insight into the culture of a restaurant, so we declined the table when it became available.First course: The sweetbreads were tender and moist with a crisp crust, accompanied by a creamy onion soubise and parsnip puree. Sumptuous. The foie gras mousse was rich and smooth and heavenly light and creamy. Stunning. Main course: A tender and juicy roasted breast of chicken with slices of perfectly executed galantine from the leg, accompanied by a tasty aigre-doux (sweet and sour sauce) flavored with rosemary. Exquisite. The rabbit roulade served with root vegetables was moist and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Luscious.For dessert we shared a perfect cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, ethereal in its smoothness and light as a feather with a perfectly thin and crunchy broiled top.They have no espresso machine.

We also ordered a pitcher of OJ for mimosas and an iced coffee, both of which were perfectly satisfactory.

I was greeted upon entry with a genuine smile and hello and told to sit wherever I wanted. A cold bottle of water was left on the table so I could refill my water at will (which is awesome, since I drink water like crazy!).

My wife ordered So French, which included swiss cheese topped with ham and two sunny side eggs.Maybe we both made the wrong choices because we were thoroughly disappointed. My crepe was basically a spinach salad with about eight of the tiniest shrimp I have ever seen in my life.

They were both delicious; the So Riviera resembled a salad on top of a crepe, and the So Washington came with a classic apple filling, caramel drizzle, and vanilla ice cream.

We came for brunch so the classic question was: savory or sweet? I opted for savory and ordered the So Florentine but asked for some blue cheese in it as well. I can vouch for the deliciousness of this crepe because everyone at my table was asking for a bite of it. The serving size is perfect because I felt full but without being stuffed. As I write this review, I actually really want another one of those crepes. The prices are super reasonable and great as a BYO option as well. We brought some Verdi (sparkling wine) which we mixed with their orange juice to create a great drink to accompany our crepes.
