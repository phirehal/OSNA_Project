The hummus and calamari were fine, nothing bad but nothing special. \u00a0Berenjana Ahumada (smoked eggplant) was my least favorite, it was entirely too smokey. \u00a0Albondigas (Spanish meat balls) was the one thing that our server recommended; I would give that 3-4 stars. \u00a0The Paella Valenciana was actually my favorite, and the only thing I would consider ordering again though it was rather expensive for the tapas portion size.By the time we finished eating, we were the only people left in the restaurant but we still had to wait for the check and then she was confused by how we asked to pay (2 credit cards and some cash).There are a lot of restaurants in Queen Village and on South Street; I don't see this place lasting very long unless they make some serious improvements. \u00a0I don't intend on returning any time soon."], ["Robert K.", "Horrible. \u00a0The menu advertises manchego cheese and Iberian ham. \u00a0They brought us cubed cheddar and ham that was clearly store-bought, then told us they were \"out of manchego.\" \u00a0They insisted that low-quality cubed cheddar was a Spanish cheese, even though it clearly was cheddar. \u00a0Usually when I order something from a menu, I expect to be told if I am being served something else. \u00a0The chicken was decent, but served over what seemed like microwaved boxed rice. \u00a0The calamari was mediocre at best.

Something about Pine St (OK, maybe a few things) makes me really happy, so finding this spot tucked away on a quite spot at 11th and Pine was special. Very minimal decor, but cozy enough to feel like you're dining at your family holiday dinner. I think it would be a great spot for a small group to celebrate a special event. I'm currently eating pescetarian with my man, and they did not at all disappoint if you are looking for seafood or vegetables. We shared 2 1st courses, 2 2nd courses, and 1 main course which ended up being perfect to share between two hungry people. Starters were seared tuna and quinoa salad and chilled sweet corn soup with crab cake. The corn soup was FANTASTIC and one of best of the evening. Really sweet and thick, without being too heavy. The bloody beet steak is absolutely to die for as recorded by roughly every previous reviewer. SPOILER ALERT: Maybe I'm not first on this, but if so I need to share that the waitresses outed this to me while I was here - starchefs.com/cook/recip\u2026Anyway, I must continue. The baked egg/cheese/eggplant was not my favorite, but made up for by the sea bass over polenta. Fish-perfectly cooked, paired really nicely with the polenta. The chocolate mouse napoleon with fried phyllo dough was a little naughty. Perfect to close it all out.

The restaurant's intimacy begs for discrete, efficient and friendly service. (\"Friendly service\" should a redundant term.) However, at the F&F, our waitress gave the impression that - having scored a reservation - us patrons should be made to tolerate her condescending demeanor.

In stark contrast, the other waitress's doting attitude to the neighboring table was pretty annoying.

Josh Lawler does some really incredible things with seasonal ingredients. This was showcased especially in the first course: grilled eggplant with burrata, and a slow roasted squash. Both plates were filled with vibrant colors from the ingredients and accompanying sauces. The flavors were wonderful, and every bite was different. Next I had scallops, which were served with pastrami and sweet corn. On point. Now that it's a couple weeks later, I don't remember what my dining partner had for his second course, but I do know he enjoyed whatever it was (helpful, I know). My main course was a grilled tri tip steak, which was very lean and very tender. It was served with lima beans, which I really liked as an alternate to the usual potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his bacon-wrapped quail. Who wouldn't love a teeny bird wrapped in bacon? For dessert we shared a lemon tart which was perfection. I'm literally shaking my head at the memory. Get the tart.This was our second visit to this restaurant. The first was nearly a year ago, after they first opened. I have to admit, I enjoyed this second visit so much more, and I think it had a lot to do with the seasonal fruits and veggies of late summer.

I hope in time they will be able to deliver.The menu is essentially set up as a three course tasting menu, with dessert as an optional. Changing daily, based on what they are able to source, it is clearly a surprise what is on the menu.As it was a blustery fall night, I opted for two dishes that felt like they were fall to me.. a delicous butternut squash soup, that also had sunflower seeds and a bit of speck in the bottom. Great,,, a taste of the season. I followed that with acorn squash ravioli, served with hazlenuts, and gala apples in a brown butter sage sauce. Good but not as flavorful as I was expecting. This course they also messed up my DC's order, forgeting to put his lobster in. That threw off the whole pace of the dinner.The third course we both opted for lamb shoulder, served on a bed of spinach, and turnips. Felt like the dish was a bit salty, and not sure if this was a result of over salting, or whether the sauce reduced while cooking extra long while the lobster dish was fired.We passed on dessert as the choices were uninspiring (creme brulle and an apple struedel,,, ). We also had a hiccup with the final bill as they under charged us, and wanting to be honest, we brought that to their attention, which then resulted in an additional ten minutes to leave the restaurant.I love the place, the staff, and the concept.

The calamari was crisp and not too heavy with a great tomato based sauce on top that caused me to scrape every last bit off of the bottom of the plate! The spreads were a nice sampler of different Mediterranean dips, but the garlic hummus definitely beat the other two. This was absolutely the best hummus I have ever tasted.I had meat paella for my entree. The other reviews on here are correct. It is absolutely DELICIOUS with heaps of meat including some amazing scallops and hearty chorizo. There was so much that it took me a while to eat it all, but it was a marathon of pure bliss.

We're definitely glad we came here, even though I wasn't sure how tapas would fare with the little one. From the start, Jessica at the hostess desk was lovely, making conversation with my three year-old before the table was ready. Once seated, in the back room under the skylight, the three of us settled in. Our server, Reese, was just wonderful. He was charming, engaging and didn't seem put out that there was a preschooler in a restaurant that clearly had no children's menu. We started with the house-made chips and guacamole and the crispy Brussels sprouts. The guac was good, but not the best. I personally thought it could use more spice but it definitely didn't disappoint. The sprouts were AMAZING and I'm planning on trying to replicate them sometime this week. For dinner I had the Mahi Mahi special with creamy polenta. Sooooo goooooood. The fish was tender and juicy and the polenta was so very delicious. My husband had the burger and annihilated it completely, which I'll take as a good sign. My son had the lobster and crab Mac and cheese and ate a decent portion, which tells me he liked it. For drinks, husband went with the Manhattan but made with rye. Reese made this drink himself and my husband was impressed. I went with the rum julep and happily sipped on a few of them. Delicious! Overall, a great experience and we'd definitely come back."], ["C T.", "Basic comfort food with high quality ingredients. Big menu everything tasted good not sure if its worth the price.

And I really enjoyed the sauce that complimented - it was aged balsamic when I inquired. \u00a0Highly recommend it!The Porkbelly Slider Cubans were pretty good too. \u00a0Simple but excellent execution and great proportions - you got just enough pickle to the Canadian bacon and cheese. \u00a0Don't skip the Fried Goat Cheese!! By far the best menu item we tried. \u00a0(See posted picture- we couldn't even resist eating one each before taking a picture of the last one on the plate). The honey just goes so well with the tangy yet creamy goat cheese, but the bell pepper marmalade adds another exciting layer for your taste buds. \u00a0Heavenly!Service was good, although we were literally the only customers sitting outside on a nice summery night. \u00a0And don't forget to check in on yelp for a complimentary wine/sangria (if they still have that offer)!"], ["Gena N.", "Myself and a few gfs weren't impressed with our visit here recently.

Overpriced average food, even worse all of us experienced gas and stomach issues for 24 hours after dining here. I'm giving 3 stars only because 1. Sever was nice, 2. atmosphere was nice & 3.

It was so much food but we ate it all because it was so incredible!!For dessert 7 of us split the delicious warm Oreo beignet covered in ice cream and caramel (actually heaven on earth, no joke), a strawberry tres leches cake, and a chocolate coffee mousse. I personally highly recommend the bacon wrapped scallops, the baked brie, the calamari and the Oreo beignet. My friends said their chicken saltimbocca, and the lamb burger were also really delicious! The drinks were strong and delicious. The service was great. The waitress perfectly explained the varying portions to us so we knew what to expect.

Not only was the food absolutely delicious, the staff really made the experience a night to remember. Ask for Cody or Reece and they will be sure to take care of you. Food wise, I was there with five others so we tried a variety of items. I had the figs in a blanket and was blown away! I'm not one for blue cheese, but in combination with the figs and bacon...seriously one of the best items I've eaten in a very long time. I also tried the truffle fries and kobe burger and both were very good. A couple people got the brussel sprouts as well as the bacon wrapped scallops, the butternut squash salad, and the scallop dinner. Everyone in our party really enjoyed it.

We had the Level One dinner package (valanni.com/menus/recept\u2026) since we were more than 10 people. Jenny organizes all the large reservations and was great to work with. She was kind enough to add the Bleu Salad to our set of options as well since many of us are vegetarian. The atmosphere is very young and trendy so it was well suited for the occasion. I am a sucker for good Vegetarian Paella and I can confidently say Valanni's is great. While it is not the best paella I have had, Valanni's saffron rice was definitely flavorful. The Trio of Spreads was fairly standard - nothing special but not a downer by any means. I got the Oreo Beignet which was delicious! Almost our entire party ordered it and it certainly did not disappoint. The red sangria was also quite enjoyable and went very well with the paella.I docked off one star because the service was a bit slow and they accidentally billed me for a much more expensive dinner package than I had arranged (but they quickly corrected it after I pointed it out).

It all was fantastic and the Paella was such a generous portion. Did i mention the oreo beignet? Outstanding ! The cocktail list was extensive and everything looked delicious.

The lamb burger was decent but only ordered it because we were still hungry after eating the flatbread, brussel sprouts, chicken empanadas, calamari, and shrimp fideos. Do not order the shrimp fideos. The noodles tasted boxed with an oddly vinegary taste and spicy after note.

The bartenders know what they are doing.Also, the music... it's at a 10 when it needs to be at a 5. It is so loud in this restaurant (from the music, not the patrons or staff) that you cannot - CANNOT - have a conversation with a person sitting 2-3 feet from you.I do not recommend for a date night; unless to get 1 drink... or to get completely shitfaced and scream as loud as you want; ain't nobody gonna hear ya'."], ["Farha A.", "My experience here was mixed. I read some Yelp reviews and reserved a table here since my friend was in town, but upon arrival we ended up having to wait over a half an hour despite the reservation. We kept asking when we would be seated and the staff seemed confused and were not able to communicate with each other or us to give us an approximate wait time.It was a Saturday night so I understand that the restaurant was crowded, but in my opinion it was a little too loud and crowded initially. I was looking to have a yummy, fun dinner not be overwhelmed in a night-club atmosphere.After waiting a half hour when we were finally seated, from here on out the experience improved. The server was helpful, kind, and prompt and the music was no longer drum-blasting in the area where we were seated (others closer to the front weren't so fortunate and I could hear them screaming at each other in an attempt to converse over the loud music)The food was really good, especially the Kobe burger which was cooked and seasoned just right. The fries were also very well crisped and flavored just the way I like it with plenty of dipping sauces - something I desperately love.So, great food but not so great ambiance if you're looking to converse over dinner. Also don't expect to be seated on time."], ["Sheila D.", "Absolutely LOVE this place. Came here for restaurant week, and it has got to be one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia that I've tried so far in terms of its food, ambiance, and service. Let's start with the food. Even though restaurant week venues usually have extremely limited menus, Valanni had a very extensive list of options that made us spend quite a long time finalizing our orders since all of the descriptions sounded so mouth-watering. I ordered the Crispy Shiitake Polenta, which looked almost as good as it tasted. I was actually pretty surprised how much I enjoyed the dish because it had a lot of feta, and I'm not usually a huge fan of cheese, but in this dish, it just worked. I was also able to try the Quesadilla (very rich, cheesy, and inexplicably classier than your typical quesadilla), the Baked Brie (deliciously creamy), the Crispy Brussels Sprouts (very unique dish that reminded me a little bit of kale chips - light & refreshing with a slight crunch), and last but not least, the Black Truffle Arancini, my ALL TIME favorite of the night. The Arancini itself had quite a lot of flavor, but when dipped into the rich cream sauce, it became a piece of heaven that melted in your mouth. If I had to recommend one tapas dish, it would be the Arancini - I promise it won't disappoint.For my entr\u00e9e, I had the Sesame & Pepita-Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna, which I thoroughly enjoyed. There was a circle of wasabi around the dish, and I'm not a huge fan of wasabi, so I kind of just avoided it. Next time, I'll remember to just ask for the dish without the wasabi. I was able to try a bit of the Crusted Porcini Day Boat Scallops, which were just scrumptious! Again, the sauce 100% delivers and makes the dish.Finally, the dessert. Not much to say except for the fact that there could not have been a better way to end the night. Milk Chocolate Mousse was so silky and not too sweet, so it was a very refreshing treat. The Oreo Beignet took me back to all of those state fairs with delicious fried Oreos, and the Bread Pudding was to DIE for - crispy on the outside, and when you smother ice cream all over, it makes an undeniably tasty end to the meal.The atmosphere had a very modern vibe and had some elements of a club including neon-ish lights. I thought it was a very cool environment to dine in. Service was just impeccable - we loved our waiter and all of his lovely food suggestions. He was very nice and personable and made sure that our trip to Valanni was amazing. I could not have imagined a better restaurant week experience - will be coming back (and raving about this place) for sure!"], ["Caroline S.", "3.5 stars... I came with 3 others during Restaurant Week to celebrate a coworker's birthday. We made reservations via OpenTable without issue however it seems they overbooked for that random Tuesday evening and we ended up waiting about 25 minutes on top of our reservation to be seated... We dined outside where we could hear each other and enjoy the crisp fall air. It was nice. We started with drinks... I ordered the lavender margarita - awful. I mean it got worse with each sip. However others ordered different cocktails and loved them (ie: coconut mojito.. I had a sip of this. It's amazing!). I ended up ordering the sangarita and enjoyed that.The RW menu had some great picks.. I started with the baked brie (grand marnier-soaked cranberries, pears, hazelnuts, toasted baguette). It was so so good, I highly recommend. For my entree, I opted for the scallops.. These were a bit of a disappointment as only two scallops \u00a0(& relatively small in size) were on my plate. It was one of those moments where you take a look around the plate to see if your eyes are deceiving you... Nope just 2!

It was a nice experience and I'd go back for drinks and appetizers just maybe not during RW."], ["Sophia L.", "The food is decent but I've had better for cheaper prices.

However, dive is almost a bit harsh of a description, as the place has clearly been renovated recently, sporting nice floors, crisp drywall, and tasteful lighting accents. Anyway, the food itself.

When informed of the celebrations, they made sure to take note and upon our arrival that evening we were surprised with customized menus congratulating all of us. This was a welcome, personalized touch. Our captain was polite and friendly, however despite his seemingly attentive nature we weren't offered any cocktail refreshers after our first beverage (aside from those of us who opted for the wine pairings). I particularly enjoyed two courses - the salad course featuring delicious curried raisins, duck skin, and goat cheese 'dirt' all of which together created very interesting notes and textures, followed by the live sea scallop dish with a tasty croquette in a ham broth. I thought the first course (caviar, a selection of hams including iberico, and a play on a deviled egg) was nicely plated but nothing stood out to me. Likewise, the fried squab course was extremely average - no interesting flavors or highlights to this dish, and the breading was very loose on the meat. The waygu beef was also lackluster. If the entire meal could measure up to the complexity and combination of flavors of the garden salad and scallop, I would've been far more impressed. I do think this restaurant has something unique and special to offer to the Philly dining scene. Worth trying out."], ["Russ K.", "Disappointing is my first reaction. In short, it was \"nice\", but not what you'd expect from Chef Jose Garces. \u00a0You have two options for dinner: \u00a01) a six course tasting menu, or 2) a 12 course tasting menu. \u00a0We had the 6-course tasting menu. \u00a0CREATIVITY, PRESENTATION & ATTENTION TO DETAIL | **EXCELLENTTop notch on the creativity, presentation, and the attention to detail. \u00a0The open kitchen gives you insight into the teamwork and precision of this brigade, and they are top notch. \u00a0Plates are meticulously assembled with chop sticks, tweezers, and precision placement of various drops of sauces, micro-greens, etc. \u00a0Each plate was a work of art, and the creative combinations of sauces, foams, mouses, accent spices, dressings, etc. were well done - each meticulously placed on the plate.FOOD TASTE | **GOODI would place this in the \"good\" category. \u00a0Some items were just OK, meaning I was not overwhelmed with a \"wow\", but out of the 6-course item, I'd say 2 were like that. \u00a0The rest were nice, good to pretty good, but not \"wow\". \u00a0The flavor profiles of the dishes were very good in and of themselves, in the sense that there was a great mix of textures, good use of fresh ingredients, and creative seasonings when items were pre-combined on the plate. \u00a0There were several plates where there were droplets of various sauces or accent items. \u00a0Overall, I expected more pop, more \"holy crap this was the best thing I ever tasted\" type of experience, and I unfortunately didn't have that at all.FOOD PORTIONS | **POORI don't mean to be harsh or seem ill informed on the notion that this is a tasting menu, however the portions were incredibly small - too small. \u00a0No one was looking to \"fill up\" on any single dish, but there was just not enough on each plate to satisfy your palette or your hunger. \u00a0For example, we were served a sashimi course with 2 slices of sashimi placed in a mouse-like horseradish sauce. \u00a0The amount of fish was a normal slice of sashimi that you would get at a sushi restaurant but cut in half - that's it. \u00a0Another example was a piece of filet mignon that was grilled, but the piece was a little over 1\" by 1\" in size, sliced from a larger piece - in essence, one filet was split amongst our entire table of 6 diners. \u00a0Lastly, we had deep fried squab, two small nugget sized pieces about the size of a large marble. \u00a0What is missing here are two items, 1) in order for the diner to appreciate the flavors and textures of the food, it's difficult to get that in two bites. \u00a0So while the squab or sashimi was good, it was hard to experience the food because after two bites it was gone. \u00a02) I was actually hungry still and when dessert began to be served, I was still hoping for another couple of dishes. \u00a0One more \"bite\" per plate would have gone a long way I believe in not only enhancing the food taste rating, but the satisfaction of the guests.SERVICE | **EXCELLENTThe service and staff are top notch. \u00a0Very attentive but not disruptive, they keep pace with the pace of your party, they are considerate of various dietary restrictions (we had a couple of vegetarians in our group of 6), and the know the menu very well.DRINKS | **EXCELLENTIf you are into wines, cocktails, etc. they have an excellent selection for both. \u00a0Top notch wines and a wine pairing option with your dinner. \u00a0Cocktails are unique and very well done. \u00a0------------------------------------SUMMARY - OK------------------------------------A well executed \"downtown experience\" with an up-scale, european ambiance, excellent service, and well presented and creative dishes. \u00a0Where Volver misses the mark is in the execution of the food itself, from the portion sizes being one to two bites shy of expectations and the flavors, although well done, don't overwhelm the guest with wanting more."], ["Daniel W.", "Jose Garces set out to make every course \"experiential\" and in that sense I will use broad strokes, so as to not reveal elements that one should experience for themselves. My thought is that other yelpers should include spoiler alerts, like any critic would do for a film, book, or \"theater\" show ;) We did the 8-course pre-theater tasting menu on a Wednesday. You can tell that the price was a considered decision when you start to research other tasting menu price points throughout the city. The 12 course is another story and another review.The design of the dining room lends itself to excellent service.

Even if he wasn't there, it wouldn't have detracted from the experience, it only added to it."], ["Mandy D.", "I came here on what I thought was just a fabulous night out in our neighborhood with my then boyfriend a couple of weeks ago. It turns out it was more than just your average night out for many reasons. We bought tickets a couple of weeks in advance for the pre-theatre seating, which includes 7 courses of meals, and we also opted for the wine pairings. I won't give away all of the amazing, inventive plates that chef Jose Garces has put together for this experience, but I will agree with some of the other reviewers who have said that the milk and cereal was so surprisingly incredible. It was definitely my favorite dish. The food was like art. Every placement on the dish was precise and calculated and was there for a reason. It was incredible. The service was superb as well. Our captain and our server worked seamlessly with bringing and removing plates and the sommelier was extremely helpful with explaining all of the choices that went with every course. I will admit that I was a little skeptical of this new fine dining \"experience\", but for a fancy night out, Volv\u00e9r is a great place to take someone you want to impress. I found out later that night, after my boyfriend proposed nearby in Rittenhouse park, that the restaurant was extremely helpful in keeping things moving along as he had a specific timeframe to get out of there, packaging up our petit fours to go while I was in the bathroom because it was 7:00 on the dot, even though he didn't propose at the restaurant. I thought that was a nice extra touch too."], ["Amanda Q.", "Sure, I'll write the first review of the tasting menu. :PFianc\u00e9 and I booked tickets to Volv\u00e9r for the Sunday after its opening. This happened to be Easter Sunday, and that fact in conjunction with the adolescence of the restaurant contributed to us being one of three tables dining there that evening. We opted for the Performance Tasting: $175 per person, plus tax and gratuity paid prior to our arrival in our ticket price (I believe it was ~$450 total for the two of us). Drinks were surveyed and purchased at dinner and paid for at the end of the meal.First thing you'll notice is the space is quite beautiful. No stuffy white on white on white - the design and color palette you see on the website translates to the space inside Volv\u00e9r; calming shades of dark blue/grey and silver with hints of white. The space is dark in that sense but not unwell lit. You'll first walk past the bar/lounge area, then enter the dining space. The open kitchen amounts to almost half of the space: it's a rectangular setup with an inner island. Here you can watch the staff as they prepare, cook, and plate your meal. The kitchen is quiet, portraying a discipline expected of a restaurant serving food of this caliber (read: price). The rest of the space displays a spacious 34-seat floor plan, with full floor-to-ceiling window panels spanning the length of the room opposite the kitchen. We were seated at a two-top next to the glass windows, where I could people-watch on my left and kitchen-watch on my right. My coat was hung, and when I was about to put my purse on the floor, our waiter, Geoffrey, came by with a Volv\u00e9r branded purse hook to hang off of our table. How cute.Drink list was offered via iPad. Waiter had great suggestions on cocktails dependent on our base liquor of choice, and drinks were offered at weaker/stronger mixes if we felt they hadn't come out to our liking. I had the Sugar Snap (it tasted like the BluePrint pineapple mint juice with a hint of vodka, which I suppose is neither a good nor bad thing), and my fianc\u00e9 had the Basil Chile Smash (he approved) and the Bancock Gibson (a little strong for me, but he enjoyed). I opted to have a single glass of wine to be served during the heavier portion of my meal, and requested the waiter simply recommend and serve as he found appropriate (we went for a medium-bodied French Pinot Noir). Cocktails were $12 each and my glass of wine was $20. Weren't incredibly impressed with the drinks, but weren't unhappy with them either. However, I do expect something with more wow-factor at that price.The Performance tasting menu, originally publicized as 12 courses, was presented to us as 14. My shellfish allergy was taken care of with no problem (ok I lied, my throat itched just a bit during/after the squid dish which originally had some kind of shellfish foam, but it was so minor I didn't need to say anything). Plates were set down in synchronization and our waiter told Garces' story and concept behind each dish. Standouts include the Milk and Cereal (very well thought out and wonderfully executed. My favorite of the night), the KFS (a play on KFC, my fianc\u00e9's favorite), and the deconstructed carrot cake, with a presentation eerily similar to Grant Achatz's end dessert at Alinea (instead of the plastic table cloth with the ball of white chocolate and goodies dropped and shattered into a million delectable pieces, the carrot cake components came on a wooden board encompassing the entire table, with a coconut mousse in the middle, smashed open by our waiter. Similar effect, similar share-able presentation). Did not find myself disappointed in any one dish, though was incredibly full (it started with the Petit Pois, which while deliciously smothered in butter, was too large a portion of something that tastes the same in each bite). Couldn't even finish the end of the savory courses (fish and beef), despite both being very good.At the end of our meal we received a printed copy of the tasting menu signed by Chef de Cuisine Natalie Maronski. We left full and tipsy, walked up 15th street back to our condo, and found out we were fortunate to have mentioned to our waiter where we lived since it was so close to the restaurant: 3 blocks into our walk home, Geoffrey tapped my fianc\u00e9 on the shoulder, having run after us in his full suit and tie in the cold weather, my fianc\u00e9's forgotten credit card in hand. Service was at its best, during and after the meal.Overall, we're pleased that Garces has ventured into such a high level of dining for the Philadelphia scene. Not entirely sure the target market in the greater area is large enough to sustain the restaurant and its business model, but time will tell. If I had friends visiting from NYC and I wanted to impress them, I'd happily take them to Volv\u00e9r (though the lack of flexibility in changing tickets would make it a bit stressful). Great ambiance, acceptable drinks, pretty good to amazing food, and fantastic service. 4/5 would recommend."], ["Steve W.", "Went to the bar at Volver last night and was blown away by the experience. The sophisticated atmosphere could only by topped by the superb drinks that Scott had artfully prepared.

Beautiful space...large bar with lots of different types of seating. Drink menu is extensive, with a large selection of wines, champagnes, beers and specialty cocktails. Got some snacks, the triple cream cheese and the iberico ham. The cheese slice was surprisingly large for such a high end place, which was much appreciated! The ham came thinly sliced on 4 pieces of focaccia. Both delicious. At the end they rolled over a desert cart (!!!) covered with amazing pieces of chocolates and other small house baked goods.

I read the menus before going and thought it looked interesting and was encouraged by the many positive reviews I read beforehand. What I found was a one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Starting with Pablano with caviar soup it offered the perfect combination of spice , heat and creaminess. My entree was a veal chop with red wine reduction that was fantastic. My wife had fillet of brazen with a habanero Chardonnay sauce that was as good as it sounds unique. The entire menu just as interesting and the service was as good as the food. \u00a0We will absolutely return and if you are looking to break out from your normal dining routine this is a great way to do it."], ["Ky T.", "The food here is great. \u00a0Didn't understand why it was so empty. \u00a0The crab ceviche was excellent. \u00a0The crab cake was also very good, huge lumps of crab. \u00a0Sorbets were wonderful too.I thought the best item on the menu here was the orange chocolate ganache cake. \u00a0Would definitely come back just for the cake.Service was a little slow. \u00a0It looked like there were just 2 employees running the whole restaurant."], ["Alex V.", "I'm really shocked that Paloma doesn't have more reviews. The place had a decent amount of press when it opened, and I believe the chef is nominated for a James Beard award. The dinner we had Paloma was excellent. All the dishes we had were extremely fresh and the presentation was amazing. Every dish looked like a piece of art when it came out of the kitchen. Unfortunately, the dim lighting prevented me from taking pictures. I highly recommend saving room for desert. The cheesecake and sorbet were both great."], ["Jenn V.", "I wish I could say this place blew me away... and I really wanted to be impressed by it- but it just wasn't there. Maybe we went on an off night...but we probably won't be back to figure that out. We arrived to a relatively empty restaurant on a Friday night at 7pm- unusual but not too odd for Philadelphia during the summer. Our first server was really soft spoken- made him difficult to understand and made us feel kind of awkward straining to hear him and asking him to repeat himself. A new waiter came over a few minutes later and was a big improvement. I normally don't rave about the bread and butter places give you- but wow. They start you with a bread basket with this amazing sour cream \"butter\" (although no butter in it) - slight kick to it but soo good. Next we the crab avocado appetizer and the Tortilla Soup- the soup was probably one of two highlights of the night. It was absolutely delicious and we soaked up the remainder with the bread. The crab and avocado appetizer was okay- i think the presentation of it was better than the flavors of it. We both found it to be somewhat bland. For entrees I got the crab cake wrapped in phyllo dough and don't get me wrong- it was really good. But I also think that crab cakes aren't too difficult to mess up (especially when paying $25 for it)- and I tend to like anything that is wrapped in Phyllo dough. The carrott-curry sauce definitely added to this good dish- it was a unique flavor that I never would have thought it went so well with crab. My boyfriend got the duck. It was incredibly dry and if they didn't serve enough of the red wine reduction with it- it would've been difficult to choke down. Have definitely had better for a similar price at other Philly establishments. We finished the meal with the trio of sorbets and the cheesecake. We both thought the cheesecake was amazing - actually crave-able. Very dense with great flavor. The sorbet was different - we got the strawberry-habernero, the mole, and a third flavor that i can't remember. The strawberry-habernero had some real heat to it- which was an odd surprise for a cold dish. I didn't find the prices to be as bad as other reviewers had mentioned (total bill for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts was about $90) and was on par with some Top Quality BYO's in Philly- except for the fact we didn't think the quality of the food was on par with those Top Quality BYOs..."], ["Craig D.", "(4.5) ~ This is a Hidden Gem!OUR MENU:* Corn Chowder w.

Seriously, they don't serve food at Paloma. They serve cuisine. Every fiber of every dish placed in front of me was a gift. The soup du jour was a squash soup with shrimp. Loaded with shrimp. Incredible. BYOB, BTW. Oh yeah, the waiter, who I would prefer to call a gentleman rather than waiter, gently pressed me to order a salad that sounded particularly boring read from the menu. However, I was astonished by the flavor of salad dressing at the ingredients chosen for the salad. I mean it was a really good salad. I had a pork loin as my main course, and my wife had crab meat baked in phyllo dough. TV food critics are always talking about \"presentation\". If you want to eat somewhere where you can talk about presentation, and go to Paloma. To quote the gentleman mentioned above, \"parking can be a challenge\". It's worth the challenge.I do agree with the other reviewers, it's a surprise to spend this much in a BYOB, but worth it.I'm not sure, but I think they actually bake their own bread for the table. What we asked for more bread, I was surprised it took so long, but when it arrived, it was obvious."], ["Shannon G.", "Menu sounds incredible. \u00a0I was pretty psyched to go here. \u00a0I hadn't eaten good Mexican in a long time. \u00a0Atmosphere is pretty typical of a small upscale restaurant, not bad. \u00a0Service was extremely attentive and they did a good job conveying the menu.I got the mushroom flan everybody is raving about. \u00a0I love mushrooms, and it was interesting to see it presented differently. \u00a0There wasn't really much depth to the flavor though, just kind of seemed like pureed mushrooms and cream mix shaped to resemble flan. \u00a0It was good but begged for a little something else to be added. \u00a0Wife had the Poblano-Smoked Salmon Terrine, which she thought didn't have enough poblano in the layering. \u00a0They brought habanero sauce out for her which she said made the dish much better. Entrees were inexplicably mild / boring. \u00a0My sole, as a fish, was well cooked and good. \u00a0The serrano-vanilla sauce was about as hot as Anna Verna. \u00a0Wife had the same comment about her fish dish. \u00a0What gives? \u00a0Both dishes were pretty bland. \u00a0A friend had the rabbit tenderloin, which after trying a bite was easily the best dish at the table. \u00a0Surprisingly not gamey (this was my first encounter with food rabbits) and good flavor on the sauce.Dessert was good, we ordered two of the layer cakes and they did not disappoint. \u00a0I had the chocolate-orange and it was rich and delicious.Overall pretty seriously disappointed. \u00a0Good presentation, good dessert, and being a BYOB helped them out a bit."], ["Barrett L.", "The BF and I came here last night using a gift card from Rue La La. \u00a0I didn't do too much research ahead of time except that I knew that Paloma is BYO and that you can bring your own tequila for Margaritas. \u00a0I expected it to be kind of fun, hip, younger, etc.., but instead I felt like I was eating dinner at an older relative's house. \u00a0On the whole, the food is very good, but there was nothing that truly made me want to return for a second visit.First, I'll agree with the other reviewer here who mentioned that the decor needs a serious upgrade: it's dated and stodgy. \u00a0The service was also a bit slow in the beginning (at least to take our order), but after that, the food came out at the perfect pace: not too fast, and not too slow either. \u00a0To start, we split the crab ceviche and the mushroom flan. \u00a0The former was our favorite of the two: you actually get a decent amount of jumbo lump crab meat on top of thick tomato and avocado slices. \u00a0The mushroom flan was interesting, but wasn't really something we would want to eat again.For dinner, I ordered the filet mignon while he ordered the duck. \u00a0I thought my filet was actually pretty good and cooked really well, especially with the red wine reduction and mushrooms. \u00a0Plus, the sides were pretty tasty (very buttery mashed potatoes, crispy potato slices, and sauteed spinach). \u00a0The duck, on the other hand, while aided by the addition of smoky bacon, didn't really stand up as well. \u00a0The BF lamented how the duck could have been more tender.Finally, the desserts were terrific. \u00a0I had the kaluha cheesecake which was served with a mexican dark chocolate crust (excellent, especially since the crust contained hints of cinnamon that elevated the cake to a whole new level). \u00a0As for the trio of sorbets and gelatos, I wasn't as impressed. \u00a0Much to the BF's disappointment, I couldn't get into the concept of a spicy sorbet (the strawberry-habanero sorbet, to be exact), and found the heat to be too overpowering for dessert.So while the food was actually really good, my main problems are with the concept, decor, and pricing. \u00a0It's a little too expensive for food that's just good and nothing that is going to want me coming back for more. \u00a0Aside from the cheesecake (which is apparently made in house), you could easily get any of the other dishes at any other restaurant in Philly, and probably at the same if not better quality. \u00a0Also, I don't understand why the restaurant advertises itself as \"haute mexican\". \u00a0It's really more of a European fusion concept, and aside from some nods to Mexican/Latin American cuisine (ceviche, horchata ice cream, blue corn gelato), there is little evidence that you're actually at a Mexican restaurant. \u00a0And finally, if not for the gift card, this definitely would have been much more of a splurge than a simple dinner out. \u00a0Overall, good food, but the atmosphere, menu, and concept need to be improved to match the quality of the cuisine."], ["Candice E.", "This is a review of the new Paloma location on south 8th Street. \u00a0I was excited to try this new restaurant in my neighborhood, but I doubt I will return. \u00a0The food was overwrought, not very tasty and wildly overpriced.Entrees range from about $28 to $35. \u00a0Appetizers are $9 to $15 or so. \u00a0We had two appetizers, two entrees, and our bill was $85.Our first appetizer was the mushroom flan, which was the best item we had. \u00a0It was interesting and flavorful. \u00a0Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. \u00a0Next came the Caesar salad, which was presented as a bunch of romaine lettuce stalks arranged vertically on a plate with a crouton shaped like a napkin ring holding them together. \u00a0It needed to be knocked over before it could be eaten. \u00a0It tasted ok, but the presentation was just bizarre.My entree was the crabcake, which was $30. \u00a0It was totally overpriced and unexceptional. \u00a0It was also presented vertically -- crabcake on top of mashed potatoes on top of spinach in one odd pile. \u00a0My husband had a bronzino, which was $28 and slightly overcooked.Overall, it felt like the restaurant was trying very hard to be a formal, fancy restaurant. \u00a0For instance, our server scraped our table for crumbs. \u00a0But, in reality, it is a BYOB in Bella Vista. \u00a0If this place wants to make it, I think it should reimagine itself as a casual neighborhood restaurant with lower prices and more straightforward food and presentation. \u00a0I doubt it is going to survive serving

I've tried a variety of flavors, usually from the Taco and Burrito sections of the menu. I unfortunately cannot offer much advice to vegetarians, as most of my menu choices involve meat. However, I can tell vegetarians that the guacamole is super fresh, well portioned, and the house made corn tortilla chips are fresh and usually arrive to my SW CC home warm.As a repeat Mexican food offender, I can offer a few of my favorite dishes from this taqueria. The Mexican sausage/beef tacos are delicious, as are the Al Pastor tacos. The taco platters come fresh with sliced radish, slices of lime, and two corn tortillas per taco (3 tacos per order). I also have enjoyed burritos of the same variety. I can say as a man who enjoys marinated meat and Mexican food in particular, those two flavors are delicious and sure to give you your money's worth. The burritos are large, and absolutely enough for a satisfying meal (unless you're like me in which case you'd prefer a burrito and an order of tacos). The burrito comes with pintos, rice, shredded lettuce, sour cream and pico de gallo packed in with your choice of meat/vegetable. The tortilla used for the burrito is fresh and chewier than it is crunchy (when I sampled burritos along the Mission in San Francisco tortillas were sometimes fried or made crispy before wrapping). Also, try a Jarritos Mexican soda alongside the food. A beer would work just as well."], ["Ari N.", "Just received a bistec (steak) burrito and tinga de pollo quesadilla from Iztaccihuatl, which I ordered via seamless tonight. First thoughts: it's just about midnight so I'm managing expectations.The steak burrito isn't \"bad\" but there wasn't an easy way to customize the ingredients. Not a fan of onions. Aside from that, it's a basic burrito, nothing special.The quesadilla tortilla on all three pieces was so stale and hard, it was arguably no longer edible. They used some type of cheese that resembles an abbazabba with shredded chicken. Essentially this choice sucked, I wouldn't order from this place ever again based on the lack of a quality control I witnessed tonight.I'm writing this review at approximately 12:18am the same night, in case I die of food poisoning in the night.

What makes this place all the better is that they deliver...YAY! \u00a0Used GrubHub to get some delicious dinner and it was here within 45 minutes. If you know Philadelphia you know delivery under an hour, on a weekend, during dinner time, is almost unheard of. Plus the delivery guy called me senorita when I greeted him at the door...Bonus Points! The chicken enchiladas with red sauce were the perfect amount of heat and the corn tortillas just soaked up all the deliciousness. The hubs had the burrito pastor and it was a MEGA sized burrito filled with yummy yummy goodness. The only star they lose is for the guacamole. While the serving size is huge and it's served with a healthy amount of fresh made tortilla chips, I thought it was just slightly lacking in flavor. I like a more complex tasting guac, this was a little creamy and flat. I added some fresh sea salt and that seemed to help. All in all this was some great mexican, and it makes it all the more better that I can enjoy it from my couch!"], ["Danny B.", "I have been on a Mexican food pilgrimage as of late, and I learned about Iztaccihuatl from Philadelphia Midtown Lunch (which, by the way, you should bookmark if you truly love good food).Now, because I had just eaten at this place, my stomach is getting in the way of my ability to type and think coherently, so let me summarize my thoughts:1.) Bistec Fiesta Ozolco Platter: If you need to have variety in your life, I recommend this meal wholeheartedly. You get a parade of grilled beef, chicken, and pork in addition to a chile relleno (fried pepper with stuffed cheese), extra cheese, rice, guacamole, beans, and salsa. \u00a0Price? $13 dollars. Not bad at all, and arguably you can eat this with someone else. But really, why do that? Eat the whole thing yourself. 2.) Tacos de Carne Enchilada: I have not seen tacos stuffed to the brim like ones here at Iztaccihuatl. Sort of reminded me of Korean marinated spicy pork, but you get to add salsas, cilantro, onions, and lime on top. Price? $6. Okay, now that is a deal. Seriously, the pictures don't lie-- they are hefty.Overall, I had to give this place 5 stars. Very nice people, and the food hit the spot."], ["Sarah F.", "As Christina G and Nina S have yelped, we were all here Saturday night. I didn't partake in the pork tacos or chicken fajitas, but I had my shrimp fajitas and loved them. So much, in fact, that I took the boyfriend back tonight and ordered the same thing.Unlike Christina, he was brave enough to try the super spicy sauce from the back. He was sweaty from it. We took tequila with us this time, and tried two different margarita mixes. The first: cherry, orange, and lime blend tasted like fresh squeezed juices and was just sweet enough. The latter, pomegranate, was great initially, but a bit too sweet after a glass or so.Because my boyfriend is obsessed with tres leches, he order that for dessert, and it was the best I've ever tried, I think. He also ordered a Mexican Coffee and enjoyed it.This isn't a fancy joint, but the food is yummy and it can fit you and all your friends at once."], ["Panharee T.", "I love this place so much! It is byob AND they don't charge anything to make margaritas for you. Food is BANGIN' and the server is very friendly.

As a vegetarian, I usually get the vegetarian enchiladas with green or red sauce (both good) or the sopes. Both are great. It's also a lot of food for a good price. My favorite part is probably the side of red spicy sauce that comes with every meal!"]], "Bar Ferdinand": [["Ben H.", "Have been to this place multiple times now and never once been disappointed. It's a little more expensive than some other places in the area but worth it (at least in my opinion). I'm a big fan of pork belly and the way that do it here is outstanding. My roommate goes nuts for the baked goats cheese. But really there's nothing bad on the menu. Only once have I had cause for complaint here - I ordered churros for dessert and they came out way underdone (I'm talking liquid in the center). Sent them back. Twice. And subsequently lost interest. On the upside I wasn't asked to pay for them and was offered a drink on the house as compensation. Safe to say they handled it excellently. And I'll be back. Many times."], ["Zerina G.", "First time I went to Bar Ferdinand, it was with a group of friends from work. It was in October and still surprisingly warm for Philadelphia. It was great because we ate outside and sipped on a pitcher of white wine sangria. Went again last night but my friends and I sat inside. All outside seating was already taken..,bummer. But it was still very nice. Decor is lovely. Reminded us of some of the restaurants we went to in Barcelona. But our eyes were on the prize (we arrived famished!), so we proceeded to order a bunch of different tapas and raciones. I love tapas restaurants and how things come out as soon as they are ready. Timing between the dishes was spaced appropriately. The croquettes were wonderful and we had to order another round of that dish as it wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for them. The patatas bravas was nothing special. It was basically home fries with two kinda of dip. I was a bit disappointed in that. \u00a0 \u00a0I tried the Spanish flatbread with mushrooms and goat cheese and it tasted really good but a bit oily. I think the best dish was the chorizo. It arrived at our table in a flaming ceramic pig holder. WHAT?!?! It was remarkable. The chorizo itself was quite tasty, very juicy, but I still can't get over the presentation of the dish. Very nice, Bar Ferdinand."], ["Nikki C.", "Great vibe. Loved the tile artwork on the walls...very cool bullfight scenes. For a Saturday night I was a bit surprised at the small crowd, but we did get there around 8 for dinner so maybe it was busier earlier. In typical tapas fashion...the food came out sporadically, hot (when supposed to be), and quick. Which was just what I needed with a grumbling stomach!As for the food itself, nothing was bad, just not traditional like the waiter claimed. The tortilla was potato heavy with little egg unlike the many I had when in Spain. The goat cheese spread was very oily and tasted more like the rind than the cheese. The best menu item was the jam\u00f3n croquettas - so good I ordered two helpings!!!Some of the larger plate portions were much smaller than expected for the price...a chicken leg for about $14...no thanks! And the chorizo was one link for a similar price (although I do recommend ordering it for the unique presentation!)I'm not from the Philly area so I don't know if there are other tapas options in the city, but if you're ever in CT hit up any of the Barcelona restaurants."], ["Tony W.", "Consistently consistent, This review comes after a minimum of 5 times dining here.The most recent was just 01/17/15 for a brunch.

There's no reason not to come here. Octopus with salt roasted potatoes and salsa verde - This is a great preparation of octopus. \u00a0A decent portion of octopus with fingerling potatoes. \u00a0Many restaurants have gotten into the octopus trend over the years but not all are able to prepare it correctly... Bar Ferdinand does.Pixin Con Pancetta - monkfish, porkbelly and rosemary Really good. \u00a0I know porkbelly is on the list of items people rave about... not always for me. So the porkbelly in this item wasn't the reason I thought to order it. \u00a0My friend ordered it - I was pleasantly surprised. The porkbelly was slightly seared on one side to add a bit of crisp texture to it while still preserving the soft nature of the ingredient. Monkfish was a good compliment to the porkbelly. \u00a0What I really enjoyed was the rosemary flavor that tied the dish of two skewers together.Datiles Rellenos - Fried dates stuffed with marcona almonds, jamon serrand, cabrales yogurt Absolutely amazing. I will admit that I didn't know it was an almond in the middle and mistook it for a pit (therefore not eating it). \u00a0I've come to find that you can rarely go wrong with ordering bacon/jamon wrapped dates. Get this. \u00a0Although small (four dates) it is the correct amount (unless you have a larger party size)Tosta De Yema - Truffled eggs, toast, asparagus, tetilla cheese (picture uploaded)  I love a good asparagus dish with egg and truffles. \u00a0This was awesome and completely different than what I had expected. \u00a0Think extremely fluffy large box toast (quasi biscuit but not really). \u00a0The egg is not noticeable until you slice into the yolk. \u00a0Cheese is also minimal. Pimentos Del Piquillos Rellenos - Stuffed piquillo peppers with zucchini, squash, eggplant, red onion, goat cheese puree A nice dish for the vegetarian at the table (depending on the type of vegetarian at the table (note goat cheese). \u00a0Wasn't a standout in my mind. Mejillones Con Chorizo - PEI mussels, white wine, chorizo, garlic We were looking for another dish that would not be heavy. \u00a0Excellent mussels in a delicious broth. \u00a0I suggest ordering extra bread to snag the broth with.

El Sol del Membrillo - Plymouth Dry gin, Absolut vodka, St. Germain liquer, quince syrup, fresh thyme Awesome. \u00a0Thyme is a great herb with gin. I fully suggest this be your first cocktail of the night.Palomino - Sauza Hornitos Tequila, fresh grapefruit juice, muddled cucumber, honey A very good cocktail but I happened to like the above drink better. \u00a0Ansill - you're doing a phenomenal job and the city loves you.

For $35 per person you get to watch Chef Ansill prepare the house special seafood paella in a giant pan out in the courtyard, plus eat said paella and bring home a goody bag filled with calasparra rice, seafood stock, chorizo, and a recipe. I felt it was a good value for what you got.The experience itself was... interesting. The chef is, as most chefs are, a fairly egotistical man. He was mostly just interested in hearing himself talk while one of his sous chefs did the cooking, and enjoying his wine of course. I think he had a little too much wine by the end of the session. The other interesting part of our own experience was having the dubious pleasure of being seated next to two older suburban yuppie couples who are Ansill groupies and they thought that made them about the coolest thing to happen to Philly since the Piazza. They've been going to \"David's\" restaurants since his Ansill days, blah blah blah. You could cut the pretension with a knife. The paella itself was tasty but honestly, mine is better. It didn't get awesomely crusty on the bottom like it should, just a bit burnt instead, but the house-made seafood stock they use really does make a huge difference. I'd say that's the only one-up they've got on my paella. He uses way too much garlic, in my opinion. The seafood got a bit overcooked because \"David\" kept yammering when he should have been serving the paella.

Initially we were seated at a booth with no over head working lamp which made it difficult for us to see the menu. We moved. Nice menu broken down into tostas tapas, flatbreads, raciones, paellas, etc. The house marinated olives were great; as were the 3 tostas (especially the house cured salmon and the mojama) You only get one slice of each; which I though was kind of skimpy for10 $(for 3 0r $4 each).Also hard to split 4 ways. I ordered the organic. chicken which was quite tasty. It was a leg/ thigh which was kind of small; served with crispy potatoes thinly sliced which also were great. Only complaint was there were only about 6 slices of them.The mushroom flabread was delicious, even though I am not a huge fan of goat cheese.The potatas bravas were ok. Too many items had saffron in them, not one of my favorite flavors.We initially wanted to get the paella, which the waitress said takes 40 minutes to prepare. What she didn't tell us was that everything else we ordered would come out in 30 minute intervals. There is no excuse for this food to take so long.

For example, which were so small that two would be better for our group...and they were spot on each time! One person in our group is currently on chemo and she wasn't quite feeling well. The restaurant only had one soup prepared in advance that she wouldn't be able to enjoy and the chef actually came out (not knowing about the chemo) to ask her what kind of soup she would like.

These items would all make my list on a return visit. Items that left me less impressed were the empanadas, which had so much potential but ended up tasting kind of bland.

Not to mention, the pulpo (octopus), olives and sardines (part of the cold tapas), and the shrimp sandwich we got were just perfect. The octopus is a bit steeper, but you WON'T regret it; the texture, temperature, and flavor was among the best I've ever had.Considering that the house wine was the cheapest drink on the menu, it was extremely delicious, and I'll definitely stock up on it at home. Terrum pinot noir, for those who are taking notes.Oh god, their Bloody Mary and carajillo (espresso with anise liqueur. THIS is what I recommend for caffeine addicts) gave us just the kickstart we needed to run errands on a dreary Sunday afternoon.

I know we were there on a Saturday night at 8, so I expect the restaurant to be crowded, but the acoustics in the room were terrible (so much so that my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other talk as we shouted). It did not help matters that our server was very soft spoken and we had to ask her to repeat everything at least twice. The service was also a bit slow and ill-timed, though I assume this is because the kitchen was backed up. We had ordered a variety of tapas plates, yet we sat without food for approximately 30 minutes, and then four of our tapas showed up within a two minute window. The sporadic service continued throughout the meal with our waitress disappearing frequently. Not that we minded terribly though, as we were enjoying our night out. The food was terrific! We ordered the bacon and date empanada, the manchego frito, and the croquettes as our starter plates. All were delicious! The manchego frito may be been my favorite; the apple puree on top of the fried cheese was mouth watering. I only wish the plate provided more than 3 skewers! My boyfriend was a huge fan of the croquettes and raved about their stuffing. For the larger plates, we split the frito misto (that day included shrimp, clams, calamari) as well as the octopus. The octopus was definitely the most visually pleasing plate of the dinner, but both were quite tasty. We will definitely be returning, but next time I would suggest sitting outside if you want to be able to have a conversation. All in all, we had a few cocktails with higher end alcohol (Hendrick's and Ketel One) and 6 plates and our total bill came to under $100."]], "Jamonera": [["Ainsley A.", "I was really looking forward to trying Jamonera based solely on the fact that Marcie and Valerie are culinary geniuses and incredible business women.We decided to dine here because my roommate and I were looking just to go out to eat and get appetizers.

Our waiter was attentive and was constantly circling around to see if we wanted to order more tapas. Olives to start were a nice touch- very fresh and salty, just the way they should be.We ordered the tortilla espanola, the mushroom coca and the crab/manchego croquettes. Everything was wonderful- the mushroom flatbread stole the show with its salty cheese and sweet honey. If it wasn't for the price, I would go back to this restaurant. My roommate and I SHARED these tapas and my bill with tip still came to about $20- I didn't even have any wine (maybe I should have to ease myself when the bill came). For the amount I spent on food, I shouldn't have walked away from the restaurant still hungry. You can go to other high end restaurants around 13th street and walk away $20 poorer and have something to show for it."], ["Michael T.", "came here on busy Thursday for late night.

She'd been dying to go, and I never say no to products of the pig.

Even without, it was a whole heck of a lot of food, and I love leaving restaurant week feeling like I've gotten my money's worth.One of the highlights that appears on their regular menu were the bacon-wrapped dates.

They were able to sit us right away on a Saturday night for a table for two (but i would recommend reservations before you go). The place was very small and you are very close to the tables next to you. The menu had a huge variety of options. My favorite thing that i ordered there was the mushroom coca (mushroom flatbread) it was absolutely fresh and delicious. My second favorite was the shaved salad, which was light and filling so definitely order them both if you can. This place suggest 4-6 tapas for a table of two and the portions are small but you will leave feeling really full! The waitress was really nice and friendly. Also i loved that they give you a full glass bottle of water per table and you can refill it as you wish. I really think more restaurants should move to this method of serving water."], ["Jennifer M.", "My boyfriend and I tried Jamonera last Friday on an overnight trip to Philly. \u00a0It's not your traditional tapas establishment in flavor, but still very well executed and pleasant to your taste buds. If you're a lover of cheese, oddly, there seems to be a lot of it on many of the tapa dishes. I think their PAPA FRITA, HUEVOS SUCIOS, and BRANZINO are all excellent. The entire dessert menu was on a whole different bracket. I would have bought EVERYTHING, except we were so full from the savory tapas, I didn't have the room for desserts. But did that stop the inner fatty in me?! NO. The CHURROS were fresh and more pillowy than crunchy. And their PEAR SORBET!?!?

It was pretty crowded when I got there, especially since it was quite a small (but cosy place).My friend and I got two small plates and two large ones to share:- Papa frita: the potatoes came piping hot, which is always a plus! I especially enjoyed the house made sherry vinegar hot sauce, which was more sweet than spicy. It complemented the saltiness of the potatoes perfectly.- Warm Medjool dates: the best dish of the night! It was stuffed with valdeon (a strong blue cheese, but not too overpowering) and wrapped in smoked bacon. The dates were sweet and plump, and the bacon is, well, bacon. Always delicious, and grilled with crisp edges. I would go back just for this!- Grilled octopus: two big tentacles of pulpo, yum! It was chewy - just the right texture. However, the sauteed peppers and onions that accompanied the dish was a little plain- Skirt steak: the steak came medium, which is what we requested for. Props to Jamonera for that, because usually, if we ask for medium rare, it would be closer to medium well. Other than that, the steak wasn't anything extraordinary. The fingerling potatoes were well done, with the skin coming off easily with a bite.The service was a tad bit slow, as my friend and I waited about 15 minutes in between the small and large plates. We didn't mind much though, since we were catching up.Overall, it was a pleasant experience at Jamonera! The dates were amazing and I would come back for it, but everything else didn't blow me away."], ["Konstantin N.", "My fiance and I came here for restaurant week, and every course was perfect.

I couldn't have asked for a better meal."], ["Catherina D.", "La comida deliciosa! I went here during restaurant week earlier this year. I was so excited to taste the delicious tapas menu for the event. I was in heaven and it made me miss living in Spain. The papas brought me back to a tapas bar I went to all the time while living in the beautiful city of Seville. The albondigas were on POINT, the skirt steak was dreamy, and the bread pudding was phenomenal. I would absolutely come again to taste and reminisce in the authentic flavors of Espa\u00f1a.

The staff was attentive and provided solid recommendations (namely, everything on the menu). We went with the Warm Medjool dates (4 bacon wrapped dates) which provided a great mix of sweetness and salt. The Vegetable Tapas Board also provided a tasty mix of greens. The Pan Seared Bronzino was delicious and provided the most bang for your buck by portion. The Albondigas (meatballs) were huge and very flavorful.

These badboys were served with a chocolate/salted caramel sauce for dipping. They were....Smack your momma, delicious! There appeared to be a light sauce in the middle of the churros also, or maybe our batch was just slightly undercooked. Doesn't matter either way though cause it completely added to the deliciousness. Yeah, you NEED to get them if you go there. Just saying!

All three were great but we especially loved the mushroom coca, and ordered another round...Which turned out to be completely unnecessary, once we saw the gargantuan plates containing the fried cod and patatas bravas. Wow. I don't know how we did it but we managed to put a hurting on this course, though there were still some leftover potatoes that we just couldn't finish. Total Wine Week win for us. If Jamonera ever features this dinner again, I'll be making my reservations immediately. The fish was perfect, the potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the dry wine cut right through all the heaviness of the food.

Turns out it was hard, so we ordered the papas frittas, I wouldn't say they were much like anything we had in Spain, I mean, they were fried potatoes, but not a bravas. They were kinda a miss for me, $7 for legit a potato, cut into pieces, fried with some mayo. Meh! Next up we got the eggplant fries, this was a 5 star dish, plus they had a version of romesco, which is quite hard to make perfect. THE fries were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, perfect! I ordered the pig egg($7), I'm not a fan of deviled eggs, but these were great, nice thick slice of pork belly and a creamy deviled egg! We also got the vegetarian tapas platter, fried artichokes, roasted beets, some type of squash, roasted fennel with goat cheese spread, \u00a0and shaved turips they were all amazing and this seemed worth the $16 price. So the happy hour starts, and I see the pig egg, now only $2 per order, damn... I know it was partly our fault for coming so close to happy hour, but I feel a bit cheated that I spent an extra $5 for 1 extra piece of pork belly.

I especially liked their cheese plate and thought there patatas braves (goes by a different name here) were maybe the best I've ever had! I will definitely return"]], "Alma De Cuba": [["Grace H.", "Alma is one of the coolest places to dine in Philadelphia. Its ambience is dark and sexy and there's a really great bar/seating area downstairs below the restaurant if you're just looking for a chill place to grab drinks one weekend. 5 stars for aesthetics.In terms of the food, I wasn't a huge fan, myself, but that may just be subjective. The jalepeno corn bread for the table was actually surprisingly tasty. The ceviche flight we got as our appetizer all tasted somewhat fragrant (in a floral way), and the lechon my boyfriend ordered was like having a farm in my mouth - super pungent and really fatty. But I think some people like that, so I supposed to each his own. Just be prepared for a whole lot of flavor. The vaca frita skirt steak was much more familiar to my taste buds, but the texture seemed a little off. And my cocktail was \u00a0really strong, so much so that I had to ask the waitress to dilute it (twice).Overall, the ambience of this place is really awesome and its location right in the heart of rittenhouse makes it a great place to dine or go on a date!"], ["John K.", "I first dined at Alma de Cuba a year ago, after the weight of a Michigan Christmas' week of meals. The GF and I decided to do a sampling of some of the smaller tastes from Chef Rodriguez. It wasn't too packed when we stopped by before an 8PM showing of Elf at the Walnut Street Theater. We were on the 3rd floor, which was more of a private space.Bread ServiceChimichurriFresh pandebono was on offer, delightfully crisp and sweet on the outside with some yeasty cheesiness within. The classic South American bread was made of yucca flour, manchego, and queso blanco, resulting in a gluten-free fluffiness. Who knew gluten-free could actually test good? It came with a wonderfully garlicky chimichurri which tempered that initial attack of sweetness.CornIn ordering the ceviche tasting, we also received a duo of corn - salty, savory, fried corn kernels and buttered popcorn. Ceviche Tasting [3 for $28]Alma de Cuba offers several ceviche tastings - we went with the smaller on this particular night. You can also opt for 5 for $45 or all 7 for $59. Interestingly enough - they don't offer a tasting of all 8 that are on the menu. Tuna Tostone [$17]Tuna, crispy tostone, avocado puree, pickled shishito pepperThe first of our trio offered fresh slices of tuna ceviche that weren't overly marinated, on top of a puree of avocado. While the tostada was chewier than crisp, the pickled shishito offered some acidity and helped to meld a nice balance of flavor.Rainbow [$16]Tuna, salmon, black bass, jalapeno, lime, sweet potatoThe heat of the jalapeno and the pop of the line highlighted a nice mix of lean tuna, fatty salmon, and toothsome black bass. The fried sweet potatoes offered some additional texture to each bite.Sea Scallop [$16]Celeriac leche de tigre, pomegranate, elderflower, hazelnutsThe scallop was a clear favorite - clean, with the leche de tigre providing classic ceviche flavors. The weight of the hazelnut balanced the acidity of pomegranate nicely. Alma Sampler [$13 pp]Smoked albacore tacos, royal palm dates, empanada de verdeIn the trio spirit, the GF and I decided to try the Alma sampler, which comes priced per person.And with the arrival of a tower of appetizers, we were instructed to eat in the following order.Empanada de Verde [$14]Spinach, manchego, artichoke escabecheThe empanadas were perfectly fried, with a nice mix of spinach and salty manchego within. An artichoke escabeche was nicely pickled and offered some acidity to the savoriness of the empanadas.Smoked Albacore Tacos [$14]Iceberg, pickled jalapenos, malanga This was an interesting take on fish tacos, with the smoky tuna coated with a tangy, rich mayo. Pickled jalapenos brought the heat, with the malanga providing a nutty flavor.Royal Palm Dates [$13]Almond stuffed dates, bacon, Cabrales blue cheeseThe fattier than crisp bacon had heft, which balanced out the bitterness of the endive nicely. The funky, salty cheese was a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the date.Gloria's Black Bean Soup [$9]Crema fresca, croquetta de arrozAnd if there's black bean soup on the menu, the GF will probably order it. And I'm glad she did! I don't know who Gloria is (Chef Rodriguez's mother?), but she might have the best black bean soup out there. Not overly salty, the soup was seasoned nicely and the texture was spot on. The rice croquettes offered some additional substance to each bite, with the crema providing some cool lightness. Oxtail Bone Marrow Croquettas [$16]Roasted bone marrow, pickled onion, natural jusI tried one of their newer additions to the menu. The marrow heightened the richness of the oxtail within the crisply fried croquettes. The pickled onions providing the countervailing acidity to balance out each bite. Nice.Chocolate Cigar [$9]Almond cake, chocolate mousse, dulce de leche ice creamAnd if you have dinner here, you almost have to order this award winning dessert. An ode to Miami and Cuba to be sure, moist almond cake is wrapped in chocolate mousse and dusted with even more chocolate. The matches are made of sugar cane doused in a bit of alcohol to light, with a cracker serving as the match box. A scoop of the dulce de leche ice cream provided sweet richness that complemented each bite of the cake nicely.So if you're looking for fresh ceviche and thoughtfully executed dishes, look no further than Alma de Cuba. It's clear why Iron Chef Jose Garces has become the force that he is, thanks to the mentorship under Chef Douglas Rodriguez. Texture, tastes, and balance are all there - in a Stephen Starr setting no less."], ["Sarah K.", "Such a great place for private dinners. I went with a group and tried all the food. My favorite is the chicken dish. The portions are filling and every dish was tasty. A steep in the wallet but it was a enjoyable experience."], ["Samy M.", "Went here Friday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday. We had high expectations for this place because it came highly recommended and because the reviews were amazing. We were all SO disappointed with the food. I will say that their bartenders make amazing drinks, we got an off the menu mango mojito which was exceptional. Got the:Lechon AsadoVaca FritaChicken imperialArroz PegaoPineapple guacamole The guacamole and the drinks were about the only good things that came out of this. I personally ate the arroz pegao and it tasted like the rice was soaked in oil for about \u00a030 mins before being served. I also tried some of the chicken and it was dry as a bone and tasted like 3 week old meat. This was probably one of the most disappointing meals i've had in Philly. The food is just sub-par and more for show than anything else."], ["Allison T.", "Beautiful restaurant with a cool vibe. We went at 8pm on Friday without a reservation and were sat right away. The service was great and everything was flavorful and delicious. I had the crispy pork with white rice. It was perfectly cooked-crispy on the outside and tender as could be, the sauce was unbelievable. \u00a0We went here based on a recommendation of a friend and were not disappointed! I wish we had enough room for dessert because it looked amazing!"], ["Jennifer K.", "Get the trio ceviche sampler...the al fuego one was spicy and delish. Sugar cane tuna was great.

The service is attentive. The food is fresh and filling. The interior decoration is upbeat. Although the bar on the first floor is very energetic, the noise doesn't transfer to the floors above. The stairs from the first floor to the second are very steep and dimly lit, so use caution.

That puzzled me as Yelp has their \"Veggies go crazy for this spot\" stamp on the page. The empanadas verde was a great starter and I ordered a beans dish as my entree. All yummy but just a little over priced. Seating here was difficult to get even though myDate and I waited at the bar with our handcrafted mojitos for nearly an hour.

I live from miami so i know a lot about this type of food and have had very high quality latin food. The fish was good but perhaps not my fish of choice and as for the lechon asado, it lacked a bit of more innovation. I can have that plate at any corner in miami for 1/2 the priceBesides that, it was very nice environment and very good service. For someone who has not tried latin food before it is a very good option. Enjoy"], ["Sara S.", "Overrated. Just like all of Steven Starr's restaurants. I would have appreciated a lot more flavor, and authenticity- and less pretense. Everything on the menu was tasty- but nothing special. Nothing exciting. I feel as though a lot of the meal was heavy. Not enough brightness. Cuban food always has a splash of something bright or acidic to cut through the starches and fats that lovingly dance together...like the Cuban Sandwich. It's not a Cuban without the mustard and pickle to marry the fatty ham and cheese and buttery crust on that flawless bread...that my friends is magic. Sadly, Alma de Cuba possesses no magic. And no love.Though I would like to say that if I could I would give five stars for service. The staff is friendly from the moment you walk in until your step out the door. I had the sangria roja, it was good. The tiny rolls were interesting- the dipping sauce that accompanies it, well- it's got a nice flavor- but not something I would want as a condiment for a roll. We waited 8 minutes for butter.Next we had the empanada verde, which was tasty, but for 14 dollars I could buy the ingredients to make my own empanadas.We shared the Dorad and the Steak. Both were cooked well, but lacked that magic I was talking about before. The rice that accompanied both was tragically overcooked. I'd love to have had some specials. AND MAGIC. AND LOVE. Steven Starr why don't you want people to have love with their food? Where is the love in your food? Everything is so corporate, so one dimensional. Is it pre-made from Sysco and you guys just sou-vis it? Sad. I suppose if you have a hard on to go to a Steven Starr restaurant this will do- but just don't expect it to blow you away."], ["Clark A.", "After my recent visit here, I'm downgrading my review from 5 to 3 stars. \u00a0The appetizer (current special) was some sort of special flan topped with foi gras and served with toasted bread ... the net impression was of slimy tartness, with nothing to recommend it. \u00a0I ordered the duck again, as it had made a very favorable impression at my last visit, but found it chewy and flavorless. \u00a0Had two drinks, including a mojito, they were just okay and didn't seem to have much alcohol. \u00a0Didn't feel motivated to try the dessert. \u00a0Oddly, I walked out of here still feeling hungry. \u00a0Hopefully this occasion was an anomaly, as this had previously been my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia."], ["Diana H.", "Sigh, I really wanted to like you more, Alma de Cuba! I made last minute reservations, and we were happy to get a spot on a busy Saturday night. Upon arrival, I could see two types of crowd: a younger (30ish) urban crowd, and an older, pretentious crowd. We were seated upstairs, and I thought the chairs and tables were too low. I'm only 5'2\". The food was good enough, but I wasn't that impressed. The bonemarrow croquettes were pretty bland, as the bonemarrow wasn't seasoned enough. The duck main course had a weird ratio of too much duck and a lack of sides, in this case a mash. The scallops were overly seasoned and turned out incredibly salty. The almond stuffed dates were pretty tasty. Desserts were nice, but you can't really go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. Service was good, though at some point someone asked us if we'd like more bread. We answered yes, and never saw bread again."], ["Julie W.", "I came here for a business dinner, so I feel a little spoiled as I tried a lot of different foods. Here's what we had:- Tuna/Watermelon ceviche special- Royal Palm Dates- Octopus Escalivada- Tostones- Sweet Plantainsand the entree that I had was special of seared tuna with a coffee rub, over a wilted greens with a creamy puree of something I can't remember (oops). There's not a dish we didn't love, and everyone was ooh-ing and ahh-ing over. Service was excellent. The wait staff and manager were amazing, handling our group of 12 with ease. Loved the atmosphere - music, decor. \u00a0Oh yeah, and it was so good we came back another night for cocktails and appetizers with a smaller group. When I'm in Philly again, it'll be at the top of my list."], ["Patrick J.", "You won't be disappointed by the menu. \u00a0Wonderful ceviche and seafood. \u00a0Try the tostones - fried plantian \"chips\" with fresh garlic. \u00a0So aromatic and delicious! \u00a0I've visited a few times and enjoyed the Hemingway daiquiri, sangria, and Dark and Stormy. \u00a0I had one of the best meals of my life there at the bar, so it's a great venue to try. \u00a0Their chef is outstanding.

Service was great and food was delicious. Having traveled extensively through Latin America, it's a bit pricey, but you are paying for high quality preparation, ingredients, and service. Ambience is lovely as well. Recommend ending your meal with the chocolate cigar - it's amazing!"], ["Maisha R.", "During a recent trip to Philadelphia for a conference, a couple of friends and I were looking for a great place for dinner close to the convention center. Alma De Cuba kept appearing on the lists of excellent restaurants. Getting a dinner reservation around 7 or 8 proved to be difficult but an option that I was offered was to come in and sit in the bar/lounge area. We opted to do that. When we arrived, there was a wait for that seating as well but a table quickly opened up for us.We started with the ceviche tasting (5 for $45) - The presentation was beautiful with five small plates of ceviche displayed on a large platter filled with ice with a dish of mixed, seasoned nuts in the middle. While the ceviche plates were indeed \"tasting\" size, the dishes were very inventive and the flavors were complex. My favorites were probably the Thai Mixto which consisted of crab, shrimp, octopus and fluke with coconut-leche de tigre, mango and tomatillo, as well as the Rainbow which was comprised of tuna, salmon and black bass marinated in lime juice and jalapeno with roasted sweet potato slices.I ordered the ribeye with chimichurri and yucca. The steak was tender, juicy, nicely charred and very flavorful even without the chimichurri. My entree was perfectly complimented by the side order of plantains, which were sweet and delicious. I also tried the oxtail with bone marrow, the duck and the stuffed dates with blue cheese. \u00a0Everything was outstanding.While the food was of top notch quality, the service was subpar. We had difficulty getting our waitress' attention on multiple occasions and the wait for the food was unbelievable. Everything took forever to come out of the kitchen! Thank goodness for the highly addictive, complimentary cheese bread balls with a sweet dipping sauce. They were much appreciated as we waited an interminable amount of time for our food. If you're looking for outstanding food and a great, dimly lit restaurant with gorgeous pictures projected on the walls, definitely give Alma De Cuba a try. But, be prepared to wait. Of course if you get too impatient, you can just check out another place, given the prime location on Walnut Street's Restaurant Row."], ["Ed U.", "It does seem a shame that I only pass through a city as great as Philadelphia and always for work. Whenever I finish whatever business I have there, I usually bolt out to the 30th Street station and take the Acela Express to the glamour of Gotham. So I have to say it was quite a treat at last to have a fine dining experience in the heart of the city near Rittenhouse Square. Recommended by colleagues who know the town far better than I do, this is one sleek, hip and popular place but surprisingly, I didn't feel trapped due to the spaciousness of the multiple floor layout and the attentive service. Ricky Ricardo could have sung \"Babalu\" here though it still would have been a tight fit for his entire conga band.My colleague and I were fortunate to be there during Restaurant Week because hey were offering a $35 three-course Prix Fixe menu that looked awfully appetizing from the selections. But first things first, we needed cocktails, and this was clearly an excellent excuse for a mojito even with the below-freezing temperatures outside. I tried the $12 El Jefe Mojito which mixed 10 Cane rum, lime, mint, sugar and bitters into a tantalizing treat that was clearly muddled and shaken by an expert pair of hands (photo: bit.ly/1nCkPAi). The Cuban bread rolls were warm with a nice chew thanks to the cheese inside, quite addictive and they replenished our little plates with little provocation (photo: bit.ly/1kuBUZy).This gave us a good head start on the first course, the Sea Scallop Ceviche. It was the standout of the evening s there were quite a few grouped artistically together, marinated gently with celeriac leche de tigre and topped with pomegranate seeds, hazelnuts and elderflower (photo: bit.ly/1gOxkFO). There was a lovely freshness to the scallops which was enhanced by the rest of the ingredients. Denying myself the Pork Ropa Vieja Tacos,the other appetizer choice, I felt it was also light enough for me to get away with the second course, the Lechon Asado, which was a ridiculously huge portion of crispy roasted pork pieces mixed with congri rice and sour orange mojo (photo: bit.ly/1oFowoa).What should have been a sure thing turned out to be a near-miss as the inherent greasiness of the fatty pork somewhat overwhelmed the dish. It is rare when I cannot finish a pork dish. Really rare. For dessert, I bypassed the Alfajores and the lure of dulce de leche in favor the Coconut Tapioca, which ended the meal on a high note with a hearty serving mixed with brown sugar syrup, pineapple jelly and coconut espuma (photo: bit.ly/T0smev). It had just the right level of light sweetness to offset the pork I just had. Service throughout the evening was quite consistent and not too unctuous for such a popular spot. If I find myself in Philly again - and i will - I may just return to this stylish Cuban culinary find.FOOD - 4 stars...ceviche is superb but the fatty pork may be just too much of a \"good\" thingAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...very hip and modern, spacious but also a bit dark and quite loudSERVICE - 4 stars...quite helpful without the attitude you would expect in a place like thisTOTAL - 4 stars...not too authentic but awfully tasty all things considered"], ["DJ D.", "The food and atmosphere was outstanding.

I went here for a birthday dinner with a party of 10 and the restaurant was very accommodating. Was seated upstairs and it was perfect - perfect amount of noise to make it a fun and vibrant place (in addition to the decorations!) but quiet enough we could hear everyone at our table. We had an incredible waiter, who we asked many questions to (such as portion sizes of ceviches, tastes of certain entrees, etc.), and he answered each question with great detail and respect. He also gave us a run-down of the top items in the menu from each category and was very attentive with our waters/drinks. Our actual food items were great!! Every person at my dinner said they had an excellent meal. I can speak to the scallops dish, which was superb. It's a great restaurant if you want to try something different, any pick you make will be excellent. They even brought out a GORGEOUS and DELICIOUS birthday dessert, a chocolate cigar - light with candles that were edible.. to make it look like the cigar was lit! Could not give a better review for how this dinner went. Excited to celebrate a special night here again."], ["Rizwan A.", "Unique but not amazing food, tiny portions, and prices that are too high for quality that has slowly but SURELY declined over the years, and clearly preferential treatment to higher paying or perhaps just douchey crowds, alma de cuba has lost the majority of their points with me.I brought my wife here for her birthday and had mentioned several times, through opentable and also over the phone that my wife and I are newly married and are coming here for a birthday dinner and would like to be treated well, something I would have happily shown my appreciation for. Instead, when I spoke to the manager over the phone who called me to confirm our reservation, she was very dismissive and trying to hang up the phone while I was still explaining our situation. She hastily assured me that it would not be an issue. I saw it as a bad sign and was worried, but brushed it off.Arriving to the restaurant last night, our hostess seated us upstairs right between the smallest tables in the front end of the section between two other tables. For a private evening dinner, something to celebrate, I really disagreed with her seating choice and had to ask for something more secluded. Thankfully she was kind enough to re-seat us. Our server was friendly but hardly around. Yes, we did not order any alcohol so maybe she didn't feel like waiting on us much, but she really took very long between coming by, didn't mention the specials to us, and waited very, very attentively to both tables on the left and right of us. It was a little beyond obvious. With the prolonged waits between her short visits, we probably spent an extra half hour here. It was a little irritating. To top things off, she wasn't exactly super informed about the menu either.Anyway, we ordered the alma sampler, plus a ceviche to start along with the yucca. The yucca was probably the best out of the bunch. Ceviche was tangy and sweet and had corn or pine nuts in it, which seemed extremely out of place. It doesn't go with the dish at all and just seems like a far reach to try and add something unique in a place where it just doesn't belong. The textures are completely different and so are the tastes. If you can put corn nuts on it why not a freakin cracker jack? Makes just as much sense.The empanadas are good, and contain exactly two bites. The tacos, very very powerful taste of tuna and cheese, just OK. Nothing great here. Yucca was probably the best appetizer, a sort of denser version of a garlic tater tot.We actually ordered a lot of virgin drinks btw, which are still pricey and tried at least 4-5 of them. They were inconsistent. Some were filled to the brim with ice, others were only half full. Not surprising. Our food was also just alright. The black lentil cake was made well and tasted good too but was the only highlight of the dinner. The Arroz con pollo was okay. Plantains seemed out of place too, but were cooked well. Fried egg on top was also sort of random. I wasn't having a hangover burger, and it wasn't a quail egg, so what was it doing there? You have guacamole in the rice already. Adding a egg will not really add any creaminess to the dish, but it will make it runnier. Rice was undercooked. Flavor was not really bold, just subdued guac + chicken taste.The bus boys and food servers were very polite and friendly. They've somehow managed to avoid the bougie air emanating from the establishment. \u00a0If you believe yourself to be a 5-star restaurant, then you need to treat your customers so that they think the same thing, not show them your superiority."], ["Jessica S.", "Came here a few weeks ago with a friend for some drinks and appetizers. I've been before for dinner 2 years ago and was excited to come back. We sat in the downstairs lounge area which has nice ambiance and comfy chairs, though just be aware that you can't make a reservation for this part of the restaurant. We started with drinks, I got the picante pina which had a good kick to it that kept me wanting more. We were then served the bread.. now I distinctly remember salivating over these cheesy morsels a few years ago and was looking forward to tasting them again. I am not sure if they changed the recipe (were they always gluten free?) or if my expectations were just too high, but I was mildly disappointed.. they just weren't as good as I remember! The sauce was still delicious though. Oh well, moving on..We ordered the empanadas, the sweet plantains, the marinated beets, and we each got a tasting of 3 ceviches. The empanadas were delicious, but I wish the portion had been a little larger for a 14 dollar appetizer. Both the plantain and beet sides were flavorful and a good size portion for the price. For my ceviches, I got the long island fluke, the lenguado \"el fuego\" and the yellowtail. All 3 were fresh, light, and tasty. The lenguado was super spicy and I couldn't get enough. The long island fluke was pleasantly salty and well balanced with the ginger and sesame. The yellowtail was my least favorite but had a nice texture with the puffed quinoa. The ceviches came with a little bowl of popcorn and corn nuts. Definitely recommend coming here, but be prepared to spend a pretty penny, even if you don't get an entree. I'm sure I'll be back for dinner soon enough."], ["Mamta P.", "Good food..Good service..Beautiful space..Their pre-served bread and cilantro-garlic sauce is too good :)I think they can be little more generous in their serving portions but I guess choose quality over quantity. \u00a0Overall a good place for a dinner date or a group friends/family dinner."], ["Michelle B.", "Stopped in on a whim and sat at the bar.

He really went through the menu with us in detail, from drinks to apps to entrees. Drinks were good. Mojitos are well done. Bacon dates were very flavorful. I liked that it was on an endive lettuce leaf which gave a nice crunch. Well balanced.Sea scallops were perfectly cooked. Crab and corn quinoa was exceptional! Vaca frita skirt steak was amazing! Tender like brisket yet had a crisp crust. Well accompanied with rice, beans, avocados, and tomatoes.Golden beets with pumpkin seeds were wow!Cigar dessert is so whimsical! A must try.Vanilla flan was very good.

Great place for date night."], ["Liza K.", "A friend and I have been on a quest to find the best happy hour in Philly and this might be it. $5 apps, $5 drinks (including mojitos, sangria and wine) and $1 ceviche.We got there a little after 5 on a Tuesday and the restaurant and bar area had only a handful of people. \u00a0It was a nice change from fighting for a seat at the bar. \u00a0Instead, we sat at a cozy table and still got to take advantage of the happy hour specials. \u00a0Our waitress was attentive and helpful (we couldn't decide between some things and she gave us a helpful and honest answer - recommending the empanadas over another item).We had their two mojitos - and found that they were virtually the same. \u00a0Both were garnished with raw sugar cane, which added a little special something to drinks. \u00a0The Mojito Suave was a tad sweeter than the Classico, and was served in a bigger glass so I'll have that again next time. \u00a0Sounds like a better deal to me!We tried their smoked albacore tacos, which were really light and flavorful. \u00a0The menu says they are rum-cured and served in malanga boats - which just meant the fish was really creamy and light. \u00a0While they were topped with jalapenos, the real kick came from a spicy sauce. We also tried their Empanada de Verde. \u00a0They were remeniscent of fried raviolli on the outside, with a spinach and manchego cheese filling and served with and artichoke escabeche. \u00a0Even though they were fried, they didn't feel super heavy, but were the right amount of richness and creaminess. \u00a0I also tried the hamachi and rainbow ceviche - each $1 only! \u00a0Totally worth it. \u00a0They came in a shotglass with a small fork to make it easy to eat. \u00a0The hamachi was spicy - and the rainbow ceviche was a bit milder. \u00a0Both were excellent - fresh fish and good flavors! \u00a0Definitely a steal.I want to go back for dinner to sample their plantains and other dishes. \u00a0Alma de Cuba was a great find!"], ["Justine J.", "Great place to just lounge around.The drinks here are amazing! \u00a0I tried the Suave Mojito, Black Cherry Caipirinha, Passionfruit Caipiroska, Dark and Stormy, and Havana Old Fashioned. \u00a0All were amazing. \u00a0The Suave Mojito was nice and sweet with Barcadi Limon, lime, simple syrup, and mint. \u00a0The Black Cherry was pretty tart. \u00a0It is garnished with cherry preserves. \u00a0The Passionfruit was also great - with vodka, passionfruit, lime, and sugar. \u00a0You can really taste the passionfruit nectar. \u00a0It was like \u00a0a delicious passionfruit limade. \u00a0Dark and Stormy \u00a0with Gosling's Black Seal, lime juice, and ginger beer was also really good. \u00a0The Old Fashioned was also pretty tasty - you can really taste the bitters. \u00a0Can't come here without getting a drink or few! \u00a0It's also fun to sit at the bar and watch Christian make drinks. \u00a0That man is literally his own machine-operated assembly line.Watch out when you sit on the booth at the ground floor - the seats are so soft you sink right in. They give you two pieces of bread per person with their homemade dipping sauce that tastes like awesome chimichurri.Thai Mixto Ceviche (crab, shrimp, octopus, and fluke with coconut leche de tigre and mango) was AMAZING. \u00a0It was so smooth and nice and coconutty. \u00a0This is definitely a must try.The Oxtail Bone Marrow Croquettas was a wowwer too. \u00a0There was a big chunk of bone slicein half with marrow, topped with three generous croquettas topped with pickled red onions. \u00a0This was so delicious. \u00a0They could have cut back on the sauce that came with it. \u00a0This goes really well with the bread the give you! \u00a0 The Royal Palm Dates were OK. \u00a0It was probably my least favorite of the starters. \u00a0It's almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon with cabrales bleu cheese.As for entrees, the ribeye was AMAZING. \u00a0It was not fatty and it was so tender it melts in your mouth. \u00a0It \u00a0was drizzled with green onion chimichurri and came with yukon potatoes. The Crispy Roast Pork was okay. \u00a0It was rather fatty, but if you avoid those parts, it was flavoful. \u00a0The skin was nice and crispy, but it doesn't beat the ribeye!The Shrimp and Grits I could have gone without. \u00a0It was served in a bowl, and the grits were topped with baby shrimp which I was not particularly fond of. \u00a0I was hoping it came with grown ass shrimps. \u00a0I understand their logic however - many baby shrimps = shrimp in every bite. \u00a0But I still rather have big ones and cut them into smaller pieces."]], "Cuba Libre Restaurant & Rum Bar": [], "Tinto": [["Sten S.", "Have to give this place 5 Stars due to the delicious food and the wine list.Please bear in mind that I sat at the bar and only had wine by the glass but still took advantage of the full menu.Jamon Serrano / Manchego / Veal short ribs (going out of season so get here quick) and the duck...!Had the White Grenache (Glass) and 2 glasses of the Tinto Fino (2012).Doesn't get much closer to actually being in Spain than this. Here's hoping for gazpacho on the menu sometime later this summer!"], ["Alex L.", "Contemporary, urban tapas-style bistro in the Rittenhouse district.A friend and I came in early on a Friday evening. The place was still pretty empty. Tinto's dimly-lit environment is enhanced by generous wood trim and candlelight, which lends the place an upscale vibe. If I had one complaint here, it would be that we were basically seated elbow-to-elbow with our neighbors. Definitely not the best setting for a private conversation. We quickly picked several random items off the menu. While we were waiting for the food, our waiter brought out a plate of fresh-baked bread. Each bite-sized bun was buttery and warm, reminiscent of a soft croissant. The accompanying dip was a smoky, creamy chipotle sauce that really shined! Needless to say, this really got our appetites going.Our first dish was boquerones, marinated sliced anchovies wrapped around a mixture of pickled vegetables and pine nuts. The fish was tender and didn't have a fishy smell. But the pickled vegetables overpowered any subtlety the dish might've had -- I couldn't taste the pine nuts at all, only feel them crunch in my mouth. The entire dish was only three small bites, but I didn't want to eat more of it anyways. Next up was a seared pork belly canap\u00e9, thick slabs of seasoned and pan-seared pork on crisp bread topped with sliced green apples. Yum! The dish's sweet-savory flavors and crisp-soft textures contrasted nicely, and each bite came together perfectly.For our third dish, we chose patatas riojanas, crispy fried potatoes dusted with savory chorizo powder and decorated with caramelized onions and smoked paprika aioli. Think of it like french fries' rich Spanish uncle -- exotic at first glance, but the secondary flavors were too mild. Potatoes are pretty bland on their own and these definitely needed to present some stronger flavors to really stand out. Next, we sampled the green beans topped with dates, almonds, and orange. Everything was delicious in both texture and flavor... except for the beans themselves! They were tough and undercooked. Paprika sherry vinaigrette might have been a nice finishing touch, but these beans were practically drowning in the stuff. My friend and I forced them down so we could move on to the next dish.For our main dishes, we selected the braised short rib sandwich and organic herb roasted chicken. The sandwich came topped with tender slices of beef, chopped bacon, asparagus, and celery root aioli. Each flavor was distinct and the rich steak came through flawlessly. Everything was wrapped up nicely in a fresh-baked baguette. The chicken was tender and flavorful, but nothing special -- I've had equally good chicken many other places and wouldn't justify ordering this tapas-style again. We opted to skip dessert since the menu options are rather limited -- but fortunately, both Capogiro and Yogorino can satisfy your sweet tooth just a block away.I usually love Garces, but Tinto fell just a bit short. Each dish was paced perfectly and presented beautifully. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. But the food was hit-or-miss. In particular, the overwhelming use of pickled ingredients and vinegar tended to overpower some of the more subtle dishes. I won't be in any rush to go back to Tinto, but might be willing to give them a second chance."], ["Richie R.", "Disappointed. I had been waiting to dine here for a very long time. And when I did, I left dissatisfied and disappointed. Dishes are tiny, over-developed and overly-complex, especially for something that is usually delicious because of its simplicity. Decor and service were good, but the food was simply not very good, especially at the prices being charged for them. Will not be coming back."], ["Krystal H.", "Went back for a late night dinner with my guy. \u00a0There was a short wait so we grabbed a drink at the bar in the meantime. \u00a0The bartender was not at all friendly. \u00a0The hostess was.We were seated downstairs in this cute little romantical candle lit corner couch; felt like a speakeasy. \u00a0We got the following:1.Serrano Ham-Wrapped Figs2.Prawns: Shrimp, Chorizo, Grape Tomato, Espelette Chile 3.Diver Scallops: Quince, Uni Emulsion, Parsnip, Crispy Serrano4.Lamb Loin: Eggplant, Bacon, Sherry Jus5.Green Beans: Haricots Verts, Almonds, Dates, Orange Segments, Paprika Sherry Vinaigrette6.Brussel Sprouts: Crispy Guanciale, Black Truffle & Pine Nut Escabeche, Meyer Lemon, Idiaz\u00e1bal7.SOPA DE CASTA\u00d1A: Truffled Chestnut Soup,Duck & Mushroom Hash, Fried Quail Egg, PistachioThe Brussel sprouts were good but not great. \u00a0Boyfriend doesn't eat cheese so those were out for him. \u00a0I wasn't a fan of the green beans. \u00a0The parsnip that came with the scallops had vanilla in it and tasted exactly like a fire toasted marshmallow. \u00a0Server was great and we had a really nice night here."], ["Tiffany X.", "Tinto is a real treat. I've dined here twice for Restaurant Week and happy hour, both experiences have been superb. From the service, to the ambience, to the tapas, it's 5 stars all around.This is a great setting for an intimate meal with a small group of friends. You can each order 2-3 small dishes to sample a hearty variety and enjoy a filling meal. If you enjoy charcuterie & cheeses, order the mixto. Of the main dishes, we ordered and loved the pulpo (a small plate of marinated octopus), the pork belly (two succulent slices on bread, absolutely divine), the brussel sprouts (crispy and flavorful), and the albondigas (spiced meatballs served with a runny poached egg on top). Everything was delicious and beautifully plated, and more importantly, our waiter had a good understanding of pacing out when he brought our dishes, so our two hour meal over conversation had a nice cadence. Overall: A+ culinary experience, romantic atmosphere, attentive and personal service"], ["Grace T.", "Great place! The food was really good. My friend and I shared tapas. We got the sopa de castana (truffled chestnut soup), octopus, lamb brochette, duck, and pork belly. Everything was really good. My favorite items were the soup and octopus! Would definitely recommend trying those two dishes. The lamb came wrapped with bacon in 3 shooter glasses. There were two pieces for the duck and pork belly dishes. We also got a pitcher of the white sangria. Our bill came out to ~$130. Pricey dinner, but very good."], ["Taylor G.", "We made reservations at Tinto so we could bring relatives from out of town somewhere nice, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was awesome, with wine bottles lining the walls and an exposed brick interior, and the food was incredible. I loved the duck confit and the pork belly in particular, but noted that all of the meat was tender and flavorful. Other favorites were the brussel sprouts, the patatas riojanas, and the marcona almonds. The charcuterie was a delight, too, and my parents seemed to enjoy the sangria greatly. I will definitely be coming back here--I love a good tapas restaurant, and Tinto's Basque influence really sets it apart from the rest."], ["Anton Y.", "Took my family here for a birthday celebration. Great food, every single thing we ordered was incredibly delicious. Staff was very friendly and attentive."], ["Vivian T.", "I love Tinto before tonight's dinner. I booked dinner for tonight bc it was the only day not on restaurant week, I want a la carte not pre fixed menu. \u00a0All of a sudden I found out there doing rest week tonight, uggh wat a disappointment. We went to dinner and had these super tiny tiny tiny mini apps as our app and main course:- Serrano ham wrapped figs/chorizo sausage: blah you can make this at home - French onion soup - which was deconstructed and was basically beef stock and BOOORING!- chicken skewers w grapes - smaller then their normal night size and not in the shooter glass... So disappointing-free range chicken: u usually get two Brest but they only gave us one for restaurang wk... Not cool- octopus was yummy but soooo tiny-pork belly crusti was super good but two tiny pieces -meatball w poached egg: B+ I'm disappointed and sad that I no longer love and rave abt this place bc they participated in rest wk and skimped on portions.I give the a A+ for service and a B- for food and D for portion size. After dinner, we went to get sticky rice bc we were still starving ! If u go to Tinto go full lol or better yet stay home bc you're not missing much."], ["Abby W.", "My sugar momma brought me here for a girl date night with a $100 gift certificate she had kicking around. We were both thoroughly pleased and satisfied with our meal, with only a few small gripes here and there.We opted for a la carte rather than the tasting menus, and I think that's the right choice for this place. Unless the high-end menu includes the jamon iberico, MP that night was $35 for 1.5 oz, then I really don't think either tasting is worthwhile. We ordered 5 plates to share and that was more than enough, with a little room to spare for a shared dessert at the end. The server provides a good guide for selecting dishes - the ones on the top half of the menu are smaller, while the bottom half are larger. We opted for 1 pinxto (pronounced peen-choh), 1 vegetable, 1 seafood, 1 soup, and the paella. You MUST order the sopa de castana if you like truffles. It is a very rich, creamy, satisfying chestnut soup with a lovely duck and mushroom hash and a pronounced truffle essence. One of the best things I've eaten in a long time. I just found a recipe and will be trying my hand at it over the holidays. Next came the dungeness crab croquettes, which are nothing like a true Spanish croqueta but were delicious nonetheless. I loved the tomato jam and avocado puree under each crispy little sphere, and they were packed with crab meat. This item is from the bottom half of the menu but is on the smaller side, which I expected. Definitely worth trying but not an item to chose if you're trying to add a lot of substance to your order.After the dungeness came the brussels sprouts, which I enjoyed because I pretty much always enjoy brussels sprouts, but it wasn't super special. The citrusy gremolata on top was a nice contrast to the richness of the cheese, and the sprouts were perfectly caramelized. I wished that it had come with some more substantial rendered chunks of guanciale rather than just the thin, crispy shaved pieces, but they did add a nice crunch and porky flavour.Next came the lamb loin pinxto and holy sh*tsnacks, Batman, that was the most delectable lamb loin I've ever eaten. It was served on skewers, standing up in a shot glass filled with parsnip puree and sherry jus. They were nice a crisp on the outside, tender and juicy inside, and the shot glass mixture was perfection. That sherry jus would make an old shoe taste good. Very rich, and a bit salty, but really really good.Our final course was the paella, and this is where they sorta lost me. I really should just stop ordering this at restaurants because I make phenomenal paella at home, and it's so much better when it's fresh. It was good, don't get me wrong, perhaps the best restaurant paella I've had in Philadelphia, but it was lacking on a few key points. While the cast iron dish does a good job of developing some of the soccarat that is the best part of any paella, the rice was a bit too mushy and it was obvious it had been made many hours earlier, which makes sense but takes away a bit from the flavour. It also only included two of the tiniest pieces of rabbit I've ever seen, albeit tasty, well-seasoned, and not dry and one big shrimp, served head-on which was nice but still a bit stingy. This is an $18 dish and contains primarily rice, which is fairly cheap, a miniscule portion of rabbit, and a single shrimp. It's good that it serves as a filler to round out your meal in a way that isn't super rich like the other dishes, but it was a bit of a let down.We saved a little room for dessert, which was a fine choice. We asked the server to pick for us from a narrowed-down selection and he suggested the chocolate tart. This was probably the best course of the meal, for me. It was a rich, thick dark chocolate ganache in a chocolate crumb crust, with a streusel crumble, smoked marcona almonds, and nutella ice cream. The ice cream was pure perfection, so smooth and creamy, and the salty crunch from the smoked almond crumble was the perfect contrast. It hit every note- sweet, salty, smooth, crunchy, cold, creamy. Next time I come here I may order just the soup and this dessert.Our subtotal for 5 dishes, a pitcher of sangria (get the red!), and a dessert was only $118. That's about $55/person but included drinks, so I feel like we definitely got a better value than with the tasting menus. I could not possibly have eaten more food. Service was excellent- we never had to pour our own refills, water was kept full, and the pacing was perfection. The entire meal was a little over 2 hours, which was just right for the number of courses and gave us a chance for a really nice catch-up session."], ["Ashley O.", "This is the best Spanish tapas I have ever had! This is by far my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia, and the food is absolutely to die for! It has a great romantic ambiance, and the food is relatively priced for the quality. I think Amada is higher regarded but I would recommend tinto over Amada. It's less expensive, better service, and better food!"], ["Dan C.", "Great spot for Restaurant Week. \u00a0Every one of the 10 plates I had a bite of was delicious. \u00a0Highlights included the ham wrapped duck, the gazpacho, and the creme brulee style dessert. \u00a0Service was quick and efficient. \u00a0Pricey no doubt, and the portions were small, but it is a tapas style place so that's to be expected. \u00a0Definitely worth a trip for some of the best food in the city."], ["Jada L.", "I keep thinking and going back and forth about which Garces restaurant is my favorite: Tinto or Amada? Tinto or Amada? I think Tinto is winning in my mind.My date and I came here on a Sunday night. We had the pleasure of having Michael as our server. He was very friendly and voluntarily explained the menu in great detail to us. The food came out in a timely manner; we never had too much food or not enough food on our table.I am not going to list everything we ordered and ate; everyone has already done that and I cannot add anything that has not been said! The musts to order are Figs, Albondigas and Lamb Brochetas. I would be willing to go back within a month of my first visit to try more off the menu!"], ["Cynthia X.", "Came here for restaurant week with a few friends and had a lovely time. While the restaurant weekend menu was small, it allowed us to sample several of the items on their full menu. 3 star food, 4 stars for a good environment and a good time. Verdosa salad: fresh, though nothing spectacular. Figs wrapped in serrano ham: though it sounds delicious in theory, it tasted strange when combined. I took mine apart and ate the pieces separately.Chicken brochettes: Juicy, tender, love the grilled grapes, but can't really taste much of the truffle jusChorizo Pamplona: Very thin cut, but very deliciousAlbondigas: flavorful with a delicious poached egg. The meatballs themselves were a bit tough.Pork Belly Montadito: My favorite of the night. Melt in your mouth pork belly. Yum!Pulpo: Also delicious and extremely flavorful, a close second to the pork belly. Cut into very small pieces, it has a great texture. Duck Montadito: This paled in comparison to the pork belly. The duck was tough, dry and way over-cooked. I did not enjoy this at all. Felt like such a waste of stomach space.Organic Chicken: My friend ordered this because she figured no place can mess up chicken. But, this was the worst dish of the night (though the largest). Actually, I can't decide which one I liked less, this or the duck. It was so dry, and the skin was burnt (not roasted or grilled, but beyond that). The only redeeming factor was the tiny side of brussel sprouts and potatoes. The desserts were fine - a good way to round out the meal especially since I still wasn't full yet."], ["Kyle C.", "I am thrilled to finally be able to write a stellar review of Tinto. \u00a0I live in LA now, but when I used to live in Center City Philly I would take my girlfriend at the time every few months. \u00a0It was and still is her favorite restaurant, so when I found out years ago that Tinto had a private dining room upstairs, I kept it to myself and decided that someday it might be a good place to propose. \u00a0Sure enough, last month I did just that during our visit to Philly, and the Garces Events staff spent the prior 6 months helping me to plan the perfect proposal and celebration there. \u00a0The food was delicious, the wine was wonderful, and it was truly a night to remember. \u00a0Special thanks to Stephanie at Garces Events and the whole Tinto staff for helping me pull it off as a complete surprise to my fiancee! \u00a0They even through in a free round of bubbly for all 22 of us in the room. \u00a0Tinto is unquestionably one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia, but most people don't know about their ability to host events/parties upstairs. \u00a0No matter the occasion, Tinto is the right place to go."], ["Laurice S.", "Good sangria and OK sized portion tapas for sharing for 2 people. It was good but wasn't memorable enough for me to say I want to return. However, I tend to be picky w/ tapas only bc I've been to Spain to experience real tapas and eaten a good amount at my Spanish friend's homes. There was something about these tapas that didn't feel authentic. Chef Garces' other tapas restaurant - Amada, is much better!"], ["bill m.", "Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Jose Garces restaurants. Tinto really blew it for me. We happened to go during restaurant week and we were only able to choose from a very small menu. The normal menu was not offered for the week.The apps were embarrassing, the figs wrapped in prosciutto were lame, my 10 year old can make them. The chorizo was simply 8 slices of chorizo, it tasted like salami. The onion soup had good flavor but wasn't anything special. Chicken brochettes were terrible. Dried out tiny bits of chicken with a flavorless sauce. Entrees were better. Octopus was very good. Kale rice bomba was ok but boring. Duck and pork belly breads were good but again underwhelming. Skipped our already paid for desserts because we just wanted to get out! Will try again when it's not restaurant week just because it's a Garces restaurant and hope this was just a bad night!"], ["Joyce B.", "Went there with one of my favorite girls. Love this place. The waiter has a great sense of humor."], ["Rosa C.", "I took a girlfriend to Tinto for her birthday, and had a wonderful dinner.One confusing point: the brochettes are skewers and the canapes are like bruschettas. But our server was kind enough to explain that before we ordered. Before our orders arrived, we were provided with a complementary appetizer. I wish I could remember what it was because it was oh so delicious, but it was basically small cheese bread poufs. They were fresh out of the oven and the warm and soft cheese bread just melted in your mouth. \u00a0The kobe beef canapes were oh so tender and delicious. The duck canapes were cooked perfectly. We also ordered the green beans, which was good, but nothing too special. This is the second Jose Garces restaurant that I've been to (the first being Distrito), and I must say that Chef Garces really knows what he's doing! I will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu!"], ["Irakli N.", "Very classy. Each and every tapa looks and tastes like a work of [culinary] art.
