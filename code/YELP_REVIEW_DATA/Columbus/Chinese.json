On top of that, the menu here is absolutely enormous, and that's not even including the sushi bar selections. Although it's billed as a Chinese restaurant, you'll also find a healthy dose of Thai food on the menu that's definitely worth checking out. Maybe it's me, but a lot of places have recently been adding Thai entrees to their menus (like Pad Thai, for an obvious example) with little luck. No worries here- Peking Dynasty does it right. If you enjoy spicy chicken dishes that are heavy on fresh, crunchy veggies, the Summer Chicken special may be right up your alley. This may not be a rare dish in most regards, but this is certainly the first time I've ever seen it on any menu in Columbus, that's for sure.The sea food entrees are tremendous as well. Like the Thai dishes, they're loaded with fresh veggies and have more than enough meat to lend one to believe that they were made to be shared amongst two people instead of just one. Classics like Kung Pao or Sweet and Sour shrimp make a showing, as do a couple more interesting dishes like Hunan scallops and Curry shrimp. The latter is likely to burn your mouth off, but if you love spicy food then you're definitely in for a treat. \u00a0If you're looking for cheap eats, the lunch menu here has what seems like an endless selection of options that will rarely ever run you more than $6.45 per dish. Nothing here is too out of the ordinary, but then again the portions are generous and everything incredibly well. The price of the combo includes an egg roll as well.One thing I wish I could comment on is the sushi bar, but unfortunately I've never made an effort to give it a try. I hate to admit it, but I generally only get sushi from trendy sushi lounge places like Haiku, Shoku, or Lemongrass. It's all part of the experience for me, I suppose.

If you've ever been around the neighborhood, you'll know that there are well over a dozen options for Chinese; Yet none which I would consider palletable when I'm sober. Moys does the exact opposite of what the other \"options\" do with their menus. Moys provides a variety of dishes ranging from the classic Americanized general Tsos, sesame chicken etc, To unique and authentic dishes I have never even heard of, and costs a few bucks more (you get what you pay for). I settled on the Mongolian beef with fried rice after having it recommended by a friendly member of the staff. All I can say is well done moys, well done. The sauce had real depth and the fried rice was actually made correctly! (If you've had hibachi you know the value of well-cooked fried rice).

That's when you just stick with pf chang, Panda Express, or food courts at a mall.We always come for the weekend lunch buffet bc 1) it's different every time we come here and 2) quality of food is very similar to that from the a la cart menu. Because the food are cooked with attention to detail, they do tend to come out in much much much smaller portion, and they are gone FAST.

I can't say how authentic or not authentic the food is, as I've never been to China, nor lived anywhere with a real Chinatown, but to my American (gorilla? cough) palate, the food was great.

Still, the servers were friendly and accommodating, despite the fact that they were clearly busier than they expected to be. Helen herself was on the floor, taking orders and bringing out food. Our server was able to split our check effectively without making it overly complicated, which we appreciated.The things I would have changed: more water refills (please!); getting our to-go orders for absent menfolk in a little earlier, as we had to wait a long time after our meal was done to get them (we told them when we were ordering that we were going to have to-go orders, but they didn't get put in until we were done eating); a drink menu at the table to streamline our imbibing of alcohol.

He was very helpful even bringing an extended authentic Chinese menu out to us. He patiently answered all our questions and gave his suggestion on what he liked. We were very impressed with his professionalism and knowledge of the food. We tried the Hot Pepper Chicken, Low Mein, Orange Chicken and Empress Chicken. It all came out hot, crispy and oh so delicious. After eating till my poor stomach hurt we still had enough left over for another meal. So the portions are nice and large.

It's a little alarming.Sometimes I just want to sweat. Awkward, I know. I'll open a restaurant's menu, search around a little for whatever insignia indicates hot & spicy, and see what strikes my fancy. Hot food isn't really a Columbus specialty, but some Asian restaurants in the area let you vary the level of heat and offer a fair number of inherently spicy dishes. Imperial Garden has a few that come in at a slow, satisfying burn, along with a wide assortment of traditional Chinese dishes and what I've heard is one of the best Chinese buffets in town.Let me fall face first into a Yelp stereotype (even featured on The Simpsons) by advising you to order off the Chinese menu rather than the standard one, specifically if you want some spicy fare. The Szechuan peppercorn variations featured there (pork, chicken, beef, fish fillet, and tripe) are my favorite spicy option on any of IG's menus. Szechuan/Sichuan/however-you-want-to-spell-it-uan peppercorns, which look like little Pacmen with tails, are unique Asian pepper variations known for causing oral numbness and a tingling sensation. They aren't spicy on their own, but instead are augmented by hot or chili pepper to create a mess of stress and confusion for your mouth. They're fantastic. My tongue's all a-tingle just thinking about them.The first time I went to Imperial Garden, I ordered the chicken peppercorn variation. The dish isn't excessively spicy; the Szechuan peppercorns actually make your tongue a bit more susceptible to the heat of the chilis and spice blend, which doesn't overwhelm the palate. It's truly delicious, and one of my favorite Chinese dishes in the city. Their eggplant in garlic sauce and red hot diced chicken are also excellent, rounding out a great set of spicy dishes, with many more yet unexplored. Compatriots who've dined here have been generally impressed by their meals, ranging from moo shu pork to chop suey to cashew chicken.The buffet is my next adventure. Reports are that it's one of the best in the area, featuring more authentic Chinese dishes than many others, and at a reasonable price. Oh gluttony. On top of that, there is a portion of the Chinese menu only written in kanji, and a similarly indecipherable Taiwanese menu. The menus are online in PDF format, so you can get some coarse translations of the individual dishes if you're ambitious. Of course some translations will border on useless, unless Garlic Mud White Meat is in fact a traditional Chinese dish and Pickle Factor One Hundred is in fact a traditional Taiwanese dish. Wonder what the dishes actually are? So many food adventures yet to go."], ["Rachel B.", "Please note, we did not dine here! We visited with the intentions of dining but did not recognize the majority of the items on the buffet.

The venue was nice and service very friendly!"], ["Christina A.", "So for New Year's Day a group of us decided that we should have Chinese to get our pork and sauerkraut on. Due to the high reviews on here, we decided to hit up Imperial Garden's buffet. I will say that I am not a super adventurous eater particularly when things are not clearly labeled. So with a slight New Years hangover, I bring my plate up to the buffet as I look forward to some comfort Chinese, egg rolls, to ease the pain. There was not an egg roll in site. Also, I was extremely disappointed to find that \u00a0I could not really identify anything but the fried chicken and white rice(which never seemed to be full and what was left was cold). I attempted what looked like beef and onion, which was also cold and not very tasty and what looked like sausage and onions. Most everything else looked too much like some kind of seafood, especially the thing that appeared to be squid, tentacles and all. \u00a0So after an extremely unsatisfying meal, our group of 10 took our 1 bill to the register to pay. Friend #1 goes up says \"I am only paying for 1\" hands the cashier his card, Friend # 2 goes to pay for his wife and himself and says \" I am paying for 2\" and hands off his off. I then go up and say \" I am paying for 3\" (myself, husband and step-son) to which the woman asks me if I am sure. I look puzzled and say yes and at this point she puts her hand on her stomach and say that the don't charge like that. I am apparently a little slow, but my husband sees what is happening and replies \" You think my wife is pregnant, she is not. You just insulted her!\" And now unsatisfied and quite embarrassed, I wait to sign for this horrific experience so I can start my not-eat-anything-new-years-resolution.

To my disappointment though, they told me that delivery was not available to the apartment complex I live in, even though it was just about 2 miles west of them. It was a bit of a let down, but I made the drive over there in about 6 minutes on a Friday around noon, so it was not too bad.On a side note, for anyone wondering where the plaza is that they are in, it's the same one with a local BMV office, on the North side of the street, just a little west the intersection of Hayden Run and Sawmill.The service was fast and staff was friendly, and the place was pretty full.

I especially enjoyed one chicken dish with what tasted like coriander leaves on it. Dessert was included, and was authentic. There were other clientele, all of East Asian descent or origin. I'm guessing this is what Chinese food in China tastes like, for all of these people to come here. While I was getting dessert and dumplings, kept in another part of the buffet room, I spied some of the owners and waiters eating the same food we were. That's ALWAYS a sign of quality. In fact, before the waiter took from the buffet for lunch, the owner asked us if we were done eating from there. At the end, she asked us to tell our friends about it. We definitely have.

You walk in to Sun Tong Luck, and there is really no ambiance to speak of. There's news articles dating from 1984-current about the restaurant, and some random cliche asian prints here and there.

I was greeted by a very friendly lady, who I believe is one of the owners. I decided to try their signature dishes: Singapore Noodles with a side order of freshly prepared to order Hot and Sour Soup. I ordered it to go, and the owner brought out the soup immediately after it's ready, \u00a0because I told her that I wanted it since it's prepared per order. \u00a0The soup was spot on, loaded with bean sprouts, tofu, and surprisingly a large amount of tender chicken breast bits. While I was waiting, the owner told me their noodle supply is carefully selected to make sure it does not absorb all the grease and oil while cooking. After tasting the Singapore Noodles, I must say I agree with her. The noodles taste very refreshing and chewy, not soggy or greasy at all. \u00a0Unlike some cheap Chinese restaurants, the dish was bursting with \u00a0fragrance and flavor, yet the curry taste was not extremely strong. The portion was also great, with plenty of veggie, chicken and shrimps.I am very impressed by the history of Sun Tong Luck, and am happy to see they continue to serve the local whole-hearted. It's one of those places in the neighborhood that you know you are getting the real stuff. Their dedication to their food is much appreciated."], ["Meg B.", "This was our first visit to Sun Tong Luck after adding it to our \"places to check out\" list upon moving to OH. \u00a0We were not disappointed. \u00a0Helena is incredibly nice and is very proud to use :no hydrogenated oil, HFCS, food coloring, or preservatives (rightly so). Very vegetarian and vegan friendly! We ordered from the vegan specialties list: Tofu black bean sauce and Spicy garlic tofu, both full size. First, the portions are very generous! We both (very happily ) had enough left to pack away for tomorrow. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the sauces were unique and delicious, and the tofu was lightly fried to golden brown. Helena also suggested we try a vegetable spring roll, while promising that the next time we came in we'd order two, right again. The wrapper was light and crispy (even after the car ride home) and we greedily ate our respective half and hoped for more.  I can't wait to come back , this is a stand out place that really cares about their customers and menu. Next time, the vegan singapore noodles and TWO vegetable spring rolls, please."], ["Andrew J.", "I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and it has easily become my go to Asian restaurant \u00a0in north west Columbus. It isn't flashy on the inside but that's ok because the food is top notch. The ingredients always taste fresh including the shrimp!

The food is high class, what you would expect at an expensive Chinese restaurant \u00a0but their pricing is much better . One thing I want to point out , although you can eat at the restaurant , it's more of a carry out restaurant if that makes sense .The Szechuan chicken is excellent, curry chicken is excellent , and the lo mein noodles appear to be homemade and are the best I have had . On top of almost every dish being excellent , the thing that keeps us coming back is Helen . Did I mention this is a family business , husband, wife , and Son n law .

The owner takes you in and makes you feel like family. She makes all her food without preservatives and is msg free. Best Chinese in town! A must try!"], ["Vin R.", "I want to love this place based on the other reviews and the very enthusiastic owners. \u00a0However, I felt the quality of the food was a step behind that of Hunan Lion (also on Bethel). \u00a0On the other hand Sun Tong Luck is quite a bit cheaper.My main issue was that the owners decided to take their phone off the hook for about 45 minutes on a Saturday night (ostensibly because they were busy), making it impossible to call in an order-- forcing me to drive over, order in person and wait for our food. \u00a0Not a good situation if you have a very hungry and very pregnant wife with chinese food cravings. \u00a0Kind of an odd business model, but I guess it insures quality for the customers they already have.We'll probably go back, but I'll need to know if they're answering their phones first."], ["Neal W.", "Helena at Sun Tong Luck serves the best Chinese food I've had in Columbus and quite possibly, ever. All of the ingredients are of exceptional quality and the flavor is hard to beat. Pair this with her excellent customer service and you've got a winning combination.I generally keep it pretty simple with General Tso's chicken or lo mein but everything on the menu looks pretty good. If you're in the area you should be sure to check this place out. I guarantee you'll likely want to come back for seconds. If so, Helena will likely remember you are a repeat customer and greet you with a smile.Seriously, this place is great. A+"], ["Edy D.", "I haven't had any luck lately. Here's another place that I wanted to be good because of its perfect location, right by a 'cheapie' movie place. It had good reviews but unfortunately I can't give them one. \u00a0It's a typical humble Asian establishment and the owner was super friendly, called each patron by name...however the food was not good, bland and uneventful tastes. Sadly, I won't be back! \u00a0 :-("], ["Susannah E.", "If Sun Tong Luck's food doesn't win you over, their friendly customer service will.I wouldn't even call myself a regular here, but Helena always calls me by name and asks me how I'm doing. If I'm calling in an order on a night that the movie theater is busy, she makes sure to remind me that I can park in the PNC lot. Frankly, I don't think I've ever gotten better customer service from a takeout place.Sun Tong Luck isn't fancy on the inside -- the lighting is unflattering, and the last time I was there, they had put a lonely stick of bamboo in a scratched-up plastic water pitcher and used it for a betta fish habitat -- but this is the only place in Columbus that I can get Americanized Chinese food takeout that doesn't make me feel really sick afterward. I should note that though I'm not vegetarian or vegan, there are some great options for both here. I often order the sesame tofu with extra vegetables thrown in. P.S. I love that there's a bowl of fortune cookies on the counter, but a little sign says not to eat them (hydrogenated oils!).EDIT: OK, I was in here the other day and they now have a legit fish bowl for their betta."], ["Andrew B.", "Service was great. The lady working the counter was very friendly. Good prices. The food was fresh, but the General Tso's recipe was a little too bland for me."], ["Janna B.", "It's so rare to find amazing customer service anymore, and Sun Tong Luck has re-defined it. I go out of my way to get their food and to visit with their fantastic owner. I HIGHLY recommend this spot!"], ["Todd B.", "Excellent dim sum and a great overall dining experience!"], ["Robin R.", "I chanced on this restaurant while out running errands today and decided to just give it a try to see what it was like. I loved it - and will definitely be eating there again!The first thing to note is that the dining area is about what you would expect from any inexpensive fast food/takeout place... nothing fancy. Don't judge the place on initial looks though, while it may not have the ambiance of a higher end sit-down restaurant, the food is right up there with the best at reasonable prices. What makes them stand out in my opinion and was responsible for my 5 star rating was the combination of the personable service, the healthy food and the great preparation/taste.Helena makes it a point to learn all her customers names and seems to be a genuinely friendly person who makes you feel right at home. They also make it a point to use no Hydrogenated Oil, Preservatives, High Fructose Corn Syrup or Food Coloring in their foods. Finally, when I told her I liked spicy food and opted to order the General Tso's Chicken and Crab Rangoon, she let me know she would make sure to dial up the heat a bit more for me. It was in my opinion perfectly done - spicy enough to my taste, but also very flavorful. The other flavors were not drowned out by the peppers. The Crab Rangoon was also the best that I have had so far in Columbus - a light and crisp shell, not oily at all, and with a very well balanced filling. I was in heaven!If you find yourself near the intersection of Bethel and Sawmill and want to have some great food, give them a try. You won't regret it."], ["Kurt S.", "This place is awesome! I only wish we lived closer so I could have it more often. General Tso's is amazing. The lady who owns it is so nice and personable. I really wish they would open a second location on the east side."], ["David L.", "Dine in: lady was very nice..place could use a little cleaning...the smell from the restroom was overwhelming, I did not venture in there I was too scared. I had cashew chicken half size and an egg roll and small Pepsi. Cost $10.59 and was not worth it. Food was mediocre and egg roll was burnt. Will not visit here again"], ["Rich S.", "Sun Tong Luck is my favorite restaurant on the NW side of Columbus. The food and the owners are enough to bring anyone back.Sure when you walk in it looks like most Chinese carryout joints, but the food stands far above your average takeout place. It's made from scratch by an actual Chef, not rehydrated or fried from frozen or mixed together \"semi-home made\" style. You can taste this in their dishes. They have a TON of vegan selections, most everything can be made vegan so just ask! The owners are amazing too. Just go there a couple times and Helena will know your name and what you usually order. She will often throw suggestions my way to try and they are always delicious, though I always come back for the spicy garlic tofu. This place is a treasure Columbus! If you haven't been here, come check it out! You will be super happy!"], ["Michelle S.", "Great crab rangoon, it never fails me! I'm a crab rangoon critic too. My dad has been going there for years and we always get the steam bun, dim sum, soups, crab rangoon, etc."], ["Kevin R.", "As seems to be the trend with my wife and I when we go out to try a new place for lunch each week that we're off together; We found ourselves in the Carrige Place vicinity pushing the late lunch early dinner time frame by the time we got done with our chores/errands (we both work predominantly second shift hours any way so we're used to eating later than most). It was between Bollywood Bistro and Sun Tong Luck and we weren't really feeling indian food. So we gave Sun Tong Luck a whirl.I have to admit I rolled my eyes a little after looking at the menu posted on the door that was complete with questionable use of english (kinda like my reviews) and a typed up paper sign below it claiming their General Tso's and Sesame Chicken were the best in the city. We almost turned around and walked down to Bollywood Bistro. I am very glad we didn't.When you go inside it looks just like any one of hundreds of other chinese take out places in Columbus. It's got a small dining area with a mix match of different style tables laid out in front of a counter that leads directly back into a small kitchen. Above the counter is the typical menu board with pictures of popular items printed out on computer paper. It's no Hunan Lion when it comes to dining room ambience. When it comes to the food it's more.What sets this place apart is what's going on in that small kitchen behind the counter. The food is excellently prepared and very fresh. As the owner enthusiastically put it when I went back to the counter to compliment her on how great my meal was: \"We take no shortcuts!\" If that doesn't seem like a big deal to you then you're probably one of the people who assume (wrongly) that most places you eat (except for fast food) are preparing most things from scratch. They aren't. The chef as well as ownership of this place are not only very friendly, but they also clearly have a passion for what they are doing that shows in their food.Even though I didn't really take it seriously at first I was still pretty much taunted into ordering the General Tso's by the sign on the door. The sign is not false advertising. It is the best in the city that this Chef has had. The chicken is hand cut and battered chicken, not the processed pre-battered chunks most places use. It fries up to a nice and thin but crispy shell on the tender pieces of chicken. Given the thin nature of the batter I'm not sure how well it would hold up if taken for take out, but it'd still probably be better than most. The sauce was delicious as well, not as spicy as I'd like, but thats an easy fix. It didn't taste like the corn-syrupy pre-made brown sauce based sauces that many places use.This (and the last review I did for Taste of Bali) are a reminder to heed the old saying; \"don't judge a book by it's cover\". A restaurant may look like a cookie cutter strip mall joint, and if it does, it probably is, but it never hurts to try it out anyway. You never know when you're missing out on a gem of a place like this one."], ["Kevin C.", "My first venture to this restaurant was just yesterday and I'm thoroughly impressed. \u00a0My wife and I are vegetarian and vegan, so when I heard that this placed catered to vegan and non-vegans alike, I decided I had to go. \u00a0For me, I was completely blown away by the lady behind the counter. \u00a0 I assume she's the owner. \u00a0She was extraordinarily nice and really interacted with us. \u00a0Most restaurant employees I run into are usually kind of in robot-mode and go about doing their job with little interest and with even less personality. \u00a0The lady had plenty of suggestions for us, was extremely articulate, and had just a wonderful demeanor. \u00a0Personally, I've never run into an owner who had such a wonderful personality. \u00a0Anyways, you're probably thinking, \"That's great and all, but what about the food?\" \u00a0The food was excellent! \u00a0Upon ordering, the owner said that all of their sauces are prepared vegan-style, that way, anything on the menu can be adapted to be vegan. \u00a0I never really thought about it, but she said that \u00a0many restaurants may have sauces that have been prepared with certain meat juices and then sold as vegan...because there is no meat, per-se, in the dish. \u00a0I also liked how we had the choice of steamed or fried tofu. \u00a0So while I can't comment about the meats served with the dishes, I can say that the two dishes that we tried - General Tso's Tofu and Mapo Tofu - were excellent. \u00a0The General Tso's was sweet and spicy without being too spicy or sweet; it was just right. \u00a0The Mapo tofu was a steamed tofu (so it should be a bit healthier) and the sauce was mild and tasty. \u00a0We also ordered some extra veggies to go along with the dish. \u00a0I'm used to going to restaurants and having an extremely limited selection of foods to choose from. \u00a0It's very refreshing to know that Sun Tong Luck can prepare dozens of dishes without meat! \u00a0Downsides: parking is kind of weird in this strip mall. \u00a0I had to park quite a distance to get to the restaurant, but as I was leaving, I believe that there is customer-only parking that I overlooked. \u00a0The interior is also plain and typical of a carry-out, but that's not something that I mind. \u00a0If you were planning a really sit-down dinner, you probably would want some place with slightly nicer ambiance.Overall, I'm a big fan! This place has super-nice employees and super-great food with a ton of vegan options."], ["Big Baby Jesus C.", "Wow! \u00a0I think I just ate the best Chinese take-out I've ever had. \u00a0I don't know if I'd call this place a restaurant necessarily, more like a take-out place where you can also eat-in. \u00a0The cashier/proprietor was SO freaking sweet and nice. \u00a0I ordered a half order of sesame chicken and an order of crab rangoon. \u00a0The sesame chicken I picked because it said \"best in city\" under it in the menu. \u00a0It was the best sesame chicken I've ever had, although, I don't think I've ever ordered sesame chicken before. \u00a0It was lightly battered \u00a0really crispy chicken breast pieces, and it wasn't the usual tempura-ish batter I usually see at Chinese places. \u00a0Then the pieces of chicken were sprinkled with sesame seeds when they were still hot out of the batter, and then covered with a very thick, earthy, dark, and pleasantly sweet sauce. \u00a0I opted for steamed rice with that. \u00a0The crab rangoon came 4 to an order, and they were big triangles of wonton wrapper with the usual filling. \u00a0They were nicely browned, crispy, and not real greasy, despite being deep fried. \u00a0~$10 total.I also got to taste the best hot n sour soup (each serving made to order) I've ever had, and the crispy chicken loin was freaking amazing. \u00a0The crispy chicken loin doesn't come with a sauce, so if she asks you \"fried or steamed rice?\" \u00a0I'd probably go with the fried next time so the rice wasn't so plain.Highly recommend this place for Chinese take-out."], ["Sarah R.", "BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER!!! \u00a0Honestly, Helena at Sun Tong Luck serves the best Chinese food I have ever tasted. \u00a0The ingredients are high quality and always fresh! \u00a0The flavors are amazing every time I visit! \u00a0My husband and I crave her carefully created dishes - and sometimes even wake up thinking about eating Sun Tong Luck. \u00a0Helena's is so warm and inviting, you can't help but smile the entire time you are there! \u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend Sun Tong Luck to anyone wanting excellent Chinese food!"], ["Emily U.", "Friendly staff.

That's kind of a problem when neither of you eat meat. I asked the server who said no, that's just egg and tofu. But after further investigating, there was no doubt, so we called the owner over, who confirmed and apologized. She said she would replace them and cook up some veggie ones. Spoiler alert, we never got them.This place became more and more packed and hectic the later we were there. I was actually kind of surprised they remembered to bring out my boyfriend's side of rice he ordered later on.The rice hit the spot and the dumplings were plump and flavorful, tasting especially nice dipped in their soy sauce.In the end, we were there for about 2 hours. Just trying to get the check and then give it back easily took the longest as they ran around trying to seat people and get carryout orders together.Overall, I appreciate the authentic handmade food, but I could do without the atmosphere (or lack thereof) and general stress of the place and I'll just order to-go from now on. Also, it's \u00a0not ok to mix up meat in a vegetarian order but I'll keep it at 3 stars because the food I was supposed to eat was good."], ["Bill Y.", "No frills place. \u00a0Basic 60's style tables and chairs.Very authentic food, ordered pork eat sandwich and dumplings.Surprise was their spicy pork sauce noodles. \u00a0it was very good, good hearty sauce and their noodles had excellent texture!"], ["Xiaoran J.", "The waiting time is so long.

Yum! \u00a0They even have lamb noodles although they were out when I was there last. Also have interesting appetizers like \"smashed cucumber\" with garlic and rice vinegar and something called \"Mixed Shreds\" which involves rice noodles and other \"shreds\".

The meat inside the dumpling is not just pork and chive but also has shrimp and other veggies. The dumplings are soft and fresh. I'd eat them every day any time.

Well, let's just say I was about to lose hope on ever eating Chinese food in Ohio again until I came here one day after work. As I've mentioned earlier, we ordered the dumplings, potstickers, and orange chicken. All were very good except I felt I've had better dumplings (again, Cali girl talking).

The food came out fast and hot, and you can't complain about that. My major gripe is that the service is nearly non-existent. I know that some people say that you should expect slow to poor service in a Chinese ma and pa shop like this, but there are limits. Our server did 2 things, bring us water once and bring our food. We didn't get any napkins, no chopsticks (or spoons, forks, knives), no plates to share dumplings and no bowls to share the fried rice or egg, tomato noodle soup we ordered. There is a table along the back wall where they have take out containers, spoons and knives. No chopsticks and no plates or bowls to be found there. I was tempted to take some to go containers and use those as our bowls. I'm not asking for nonstop refills of water or every 5 minutes stopping by our table to ask us how the food is, I'm just asking for the basic tools needed to eat and share noodles, soups, rice and dumplings. We literally had to pass the bowl of noodles and the plate of rice back and forth between us to eat. Ridiculous.One other thing that irked me. The space is relatively small, fits roughly 8 tables. So on a day when it's 15-20 degrees freezing-mini-polar-vortex-cold outside, they decide to prop the front door open to air out the kitchen heat. This door is literally 5 feet away from me. The cold air flooded the restaurant fast. Everyone at my table had to put our winter coats back on. How about just propping open the back door of the restaurant? So to sum things up, great food, non existent service."], ["Wen G.", "the dumpling just feel normal. The food comes so slow!!! I wait in the store one hour for a plate of dumpling.

Maybe it was because of the snow, maybe it was because it was the weekend. Whatever it was, I wasn't impressed. They had a 4.99 lunch special, which includes a can of pop. Great deal! I have it a try, and being on a tight lunch schedule got it to go. \u00a0I ordered a combo of sweet and sour chicken, and asked if the rice that came with it was pork fried rice (my favorite). She said no it was just fried rice. Ok, said I, because after all, it's still fried rice. I also ordered an order of potstickers. After waiting 40 minutes (my lunch break was only supposed to be 30 minutes), I received a plate of sweet and sour chicken with white rice. Not to go, not fried. At this point I just wanted to go and eat my food. She boxed it up and handed it back. Still had to wait another 5 minutes to get the potstickers. While the dumplings are indeed hand made (saw Jie rolling them through the curtain), they were only good, not great. Definitely better than standard food service pot stickers, but not the best homemade ones I've had. I expressed my concern about how long it took and that I needed to get back to work, and she apologized."], ["Randall L.", "Was in Grandview planning on going somewhere else for lunch. Noticed Jie's, which is new since I've last been in Columbus. Decided to try. I was very pleasantly surprised. Easily some of the better Chinese I've had in Columbus, and I've been all around. The hot and sour soup was maybe the best hot and sour soup I've had. Recommended. Got the Yu Xiang Chicken for entree. Very good. The customer service was great, but I did come at an off time (around 2 pm), so I was one of only two customers in the restaurant. I had leftovers and asked for a box, and they offered to give me more rice to take home in the box, which I gladly accepted :). I will definitely come back to this place and I recommend it. Always nice to find hidden gems like this."], ["Allison M.", "I am skeptical about any new Asian restaurants but was drawn to Jie's based on Yelp reviews and the menu which includes homemade dumplings, pork buns and hand-pulled noodles. \u00a0I have only found similar food in China and China Towns in NYC. \u00a0My sister-in-law is from northern China and the food is the style her family eats. \u00a0I cannot pronounce it properly, but the Za Jing noodles with tofu are my favorite and I was glad I ordered the tomato egg noodle soup - which was not on the menu but they seemed pleased when I ordered it. \u00a0The pork buns are authentic and delicious; I am under the impression that the restaurant has x amount per week and when they are out they are out. \u00a0Pork buns are typically a breakfast food and not eaten with dinner, but I will get an order from Jie's anytime I can. \u00a0The restaurant itself is small and very minimal, if you go on off hours some tables are taken up by staff and it has the feel of waiting in someone's home while they prepare food. \u00a0I have not eaten and the restaurant and would not necessarily recommend dining in; take-out is best with the family-style portions."]]}
