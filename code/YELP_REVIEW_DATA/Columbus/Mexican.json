I only had the al pastor gringas and the ingredients looked and tasted very fresh. The hot sauce they had on the table is amazing! I kept piling it on my food with every bite. It had a strong kick, yet does not overpower the taste of the food. I'm drooling just thinking about it. We will definitely be back!

That was my first issue. Second, the tacos weren't that great. Perhaps the experience is different when you dine-in.

I found a place that makes fish tacos as good as I do (not bragging, just fact!) :) My daughter had the Torta Al Pastor & saiid it was like heaven in her mouth. My son had the Taco de Lengua & the Taco al Pastor, & my husband - three Tacos al Pastor. I too had the al pastor and the grilled fish taco. Everything was fresh & perfect. Even the kids meals were over the top excellent. We were the third order just after opening & I thought they took a little long, but it was so good we didn't care.

This place is the bomb - huge portions, huge fillings, all for a small price. I ordered the Burrito Vegetariano for $5.95 and oh my goodness, I started struggling half-way through because there was just SO MUCH. This burrito was my Mount Everest. I am so surprised, proud, and disgusted at myself all the same time because I SOMEHOW managed to finish the whole thing. I don't know how, but I did. The burrito also came with fresh tortilla chips, guac, and complimentary spice/lime sauce. The best part, however, is the melted cheese that envelops the entire burrito and slowly mixes in with the peppers and beans and salsa as you cut open your burrito. Everything is wrapped up perfectly in a warm soft tortilla shell...yes, it is quite possibly the most memorable Mexican burrito I have ever had in my life. Also, service is super fast. My friends took me her around noon time and we waited in line for maybe 2 minutes and all got our orders within 5 minutes. The servings are, again, HUGE. I must emphasize this because do NOT underestimate the portions. If you're a girl, I recommend splitting an order with someone because it was just too much .For dudes, you might find this the perfect meal before a workout (or maybe not...). Definitely recommend come here and ordering their tacos and/or burrito - it beats Chipotle by far.I'm actually glad Los Guachos hasn't opened in New York and/or Maryland yet, otherwise I'd be dying from food coma every day."], ["Kathryn C.", "I've been doing a \"taco tuesday\" with some coworkers to try out all the taco/mexican places in town.

The prices were great, loved that they had extra stuff on the table and enjoyed the actual place. But we were not that impressed with the actual tacos. They weren't bad, but we we under-whelmed with the actual flavor.Maybe it was the day we were there, but really wish we enjoyed it better.

And he's from Mexico who runs 5ks so that he can eat more pastor so he must know what he's talking about, right? I think he is. I got two and then ordered a fish taco, a veal head taco and a sudera (beef). All of the tacos were good but once I bit into the gringa, I wish I had ordered 5 gringas and nothing else. The gringas are a flour tortilla with vegetables, cheese and shaved Al pastor. The Al pastor is roasted on a spit which you can see when you walk in. It has amazing flavor and some crisp from the roasting. Blended with the cheese and vegetables, you get some amazing flavor. We got our food to go but when we walked in, all of the tables were filled with people so you may have to wait a bit if you want to sit. After trying it, they probably do have some of the best Al pastor that I've tasted."], ["Elizabeth K.", "It must be the fact that I've been so deprived of real legit tacos that I'm actually giving this place a 4. If I have to compare it to the options that I have back in LA, Los Guachos wouldn't stand a chance! But to be fair, I won't even go there.Los Guachos are famously known for their Al Pastor. It's the same exact meat, but I preferred the Al Pastor on my nachos than the tacos. Al Pastor Tacos: The tortilla's flavor is too strong and it overpowers the taste of the meat. It just didn't seem to mesh well for me. And dare I say it? The Al Pastor wasn't greasy enough! I just laughed at the amount of pineapple on the taco. It was cute. A thin shaving of pineapple. Carne Asada: The asada was extremely bland. It had no flavor whatsoever. Good texture, though. Nachos: Good portion. The ingredients complimented each other a lot better than the tacos. I was actually able to enjoy the meat!Chicken Torta: I had NO expectation for this because all my hope was in my tacos. After being utterly disappointed in them, the torta was the saving grace of this meal. AMAZING! Chicken was tender, moist & seasoned deliciously. Avocados were perfectly ripe too. The service was great. The woman up at the cashier was helpful & gave plenty of recommendations."], ["Stephen P.", "Went for the first time yesterday - amazing! Will head back today. It's quick, but not fast food. I had never had al pastor tacos before, so I was a little intimidated, but ended up having a great experience.I would recommend reading over their menu online prior to stopping in; this way you can familiarize yourself with all of their different offerings. I chose 2 al pastor tacos and the al pastor juanas. Both were excellent!If you're taking carryout, they put all of the side veggies and sauces in the bag for you. I really like when places do this, as I love all the extras. It was nice not worrying that I was missing out on something. I also hate when places give you the bare bones at carry out, forcing you to stock up before you leave. No worries about that here.Probably headed back today for dinner! I highly, highly recommend this place. I'll be back quite a bit!"], ["Cheli C.", "Went here yesterday. The place was packed. Very hot. I was excited to try this after all the awesome reviews.

I hadn't returned to Los Guachos in quite a while, but I remembered now why I frequent the other joints popping up everywhere. Los Guachos may be the first to offer great and authentic Al Pastor tacos in the central Ohio region, but they need to step up their game if they wish to continue contending with new creations like HAAS, Charritos, and the plethora of trucks starting up in the region. First off, the cashier totally did not want to be there, and rushed us.. BIG time. It was borderline rude, and there was no line. We were the only ones there. Even the cooks had to yell for her when others came in, because she was nowhere to be found.The past two times I have came to Los Guachos the meat is overpowered by Onions and cilantro on just about anything you order. As I sat there enjoying my Lengua Torta.. comparing it to others in the area... everything was spot on perfect, and cooked to perfection, but the onions just killed it. I even overheard people ordering and asking for no Onion and even remarking they put too many on previous times. Why so many onions? WHA-Y!?The husband remarked that the Al Pastor on this trip was very skimpy, and extremely dried out. Perhaps you have to be here during the rush to get fresher meat on your tacos, but Los Guachos left us a little unimpressed this time. The review is 3 1/2 stars, teetering four... it's a decent sit down place for tacos and street fare, but they need to step up their game. It's not a one man's Taco world anymore in C-bus."], ["Brianna M.", "I cannot believe that I've never heard of this place until tonight! There's a reason why this place is rated so high. It's Mexican at its finest, the absolute best I've had in Columbus. I knew I was in a happy place when I saw the glorious spinning cone of marinated porky goodness. My friends highly recommended the gringas, basically a flour tortilla taco with the al pastor pork, cheese and a little shaving of pineapple. This is for real the best thing I've eaten in a while. Super fresh, simple, cheap and delicious. I also ordered 2 chicken tacos. Those were unimpressive and a little dry, in fact. If they weren't so dry this place would have easily gotten 5 stars. There was a plentiful sprinkle of cilantro and fresh onions on everything. On each table are bowls of limes, spicy marinated onions, red sauce and cilantro sauce. Oh, and they have that addicting and delicious Jaurritos pop! The feel of the restaurant is causal and open. It was super busy when I was there, full of people happily chowing down. They have a pretty extensive menu to please even the pickiest people; there's tortas, tostadas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas...everyone can find something they like! I can't wait to come back and try something new. Whatever menu item I choose \u00a0it's definitely gonna contain that awesome al pastor pork!"], ["Kaoru M.", "I think this is one of, if not the best place to get some tacos in the city of Columbus. I personally prefer their gringas (soft taco with al pastor style pork, grilled pineapple, fresh cilantro) and torta (very similar to a panini). When I come here for dinner, at least half the customers seem to be Hispanic folks, so I assume they're pretty authentic. Doesn't matter either way though, the food here is way better than anything I've ever had in Mexico. A couple points of caution however. First, the parking lot is tiny, and there's limited seating inside. Their other location on the East side off of Morse & Cherry Bottom is more accessible for those on that side of town. Second, they do not serve alcohol, at least at this location off of Bethel & Godown. If you need a margarita or a Corona with your Mexican food, you can just eat here then hop across the street to the Winking Lizard for your boozing needs."], ["Melanie A.", "Went there for lunch this past Monday. Ordered tacos al pastor, as usual, and was charged full price for all of them.

So did my husband, who actually ordered it (since I don't buy meat for myself--just took a nibble to compare).The upside to Los Guachos is that they're open late, in case you want tacos and it's past ten or so. I find their tacos to be so-so. My burrito was also so-so--pretty unmemorable.The menu is pretty authentic, but the execution could be better.I also find their dining room to be super weird. I mean, okay--I'm used to eating in actual Mexico, and the big, ornate wood furniture wouldn't really be totally out of place in a sit-down restaurant there . . . but most taco places in Mex aren't sit-down restaurants. I'd be more comfortable in a less froofy dining room. Which... this wouldn't matter at all, if their tacos were the most amazing, I'd eat them sitting on the floor or on a throne made of ebony or on a chair made of nails, but they're not amazing.PS: If you can't do habaneros, don't eat the chunky salsa from the bowl that's on the table.

Luckily, that was not the case for me, as we went there Sunday afternoon, and the place was basically empty. The only other Local Cantina I've tried is the one in Gahanna, and the Grandview spot is just not as good. Besides the fact that there's less space, which is not something they can control, the service was just not that great. Like I said, it was empty, so they really didn't have a whole lot to do at the time.We were looking for a quick meal, so I just ordered some tacos, and my girlfriend had the Monterrey quesadilla. I just wanted to grab a few chips and some salsa for a snack, but the chips were pretty stale and not very appetizing. The food came out fairly quick, and the BBQ beef brisket tacos I had weren't nearly as good as the Gahanna location's. The grilled chicken taco was pretty tasty though, and I really like their homemade hot sauce they have on the table as well as the other two hot sauces as well. The quesadilla was pretty much what I remembered from the other location, and it was really good. I'm not sure what they do to it to make it so damn crispy, but it's like I'm eating a giant stuffed tortilla chip that's just slightly soft with gooey cheese everywhere. Yum.This would be a spot I'd go to again but really only if I'm in the area and walking around Grandview Ave. It provides a quick spot for some good craft beers as well as quick eats, so maybe this one mediocre occasion doesn't speak for the place.

They are served with a \"jalapeno slaw\" and \"chipotle cream.\" A little too much sauce, but extremely flavorful nonetheless with a good balance heat, sour and sweetness.

But consistently the service is just horrendous. Slow, forgetful, slow, inaccurate, slow, unresponsive, slow.... So why do i keep returning you ask? The foooood!!! It's great! Trendy micro-taco establishments are all the rage now apparently, so since I can't escape it I'm going to embrace it. And I've never been disappointed in the food. I think the prices are fair too, in comparison to like-establishments. The mushroom quesadilla is actually my favorite, and the self-serve chips & salsa, I mean come on... DUH what a revolutionary concept that should have been implemented when Mexico was founded. Another reason why the staff has no excuse to suck -they're not constantly running back and forth serving tables their complimentary chip refills. The queso is amazing - it's the white kind for those of you that are biased. Skee Ball too! Strong margs. Negative points for taking the mustache fad a little too far, but otherwise I'm a fan.

Their beer list is huge and consistently has tons of beers I've never heard of, even if the breweries are familiar, which is great!

Margarita's are on point, decent specials and interesting selection. Now the Frustration: 1. Every time I've been there, my party is frustrated about the quality of the food. Mexican food is classically easy to produce, but somehow it ends up being sub-par. The taco shells are - somehow - bad. I think they'd be better if they'd just snag some off the shelves of Kroger. 2. Their version of queso is the least appetizing I've ever had at a Mexican joint. I'll continue to give this place a shot, wish it was better and hopefully it will change."], ["Paul F.", "What a great meal!! \u00a0I couldn't fnd a thing to say bad about this place. \u00a0It was easy to find; right in the middle of Grandviews litlte shopping center. \u00a0And there was plenty of parking, all for free.As for the food, everything was just great, from the chips to the drinks. \u00a0I started with the chips. \u00a0They were thin and crispy and the taco sauce was very good. \u00a0I then ordered three tacos: one carnitas, a tempura shrimp, and a brisket. \u00a0And they were all just great! \u00a0 I also ordered a regular margarita, heavy on the salt. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0Maybe the best one I've had. \u00a0And my bill was reasonable; $15 before tip. \u00a0It's nine o'clock and I feel like going back over and doing it all again!"], ["Gabby S.", "Seems to be always busy but tacos and margaritas a really good.

Had high hopes for the bufallo chicken nachos and steak burrito, but ended up being a 100% let down. Burrito smelled and tasted awful. Steak tasted old and dry.

I stopped in after a meeting on night around 8pm and it was pretty dead. Although, it was a Monday. It was seat your self and self serve chips and salsa from a bin on the outside left of the front door breezeway. The chips are not kept warm, the salsa was pretty good. I ordered the taco salad with fajita chicken. It was OK. a salad served over chips in the same type chip bowl you get from the self serve station. The salad was not bad at all. It was fresh. Just not fabulous in any way and I'd likely not order it again. My friend had a couple tacos and said she would not order the veggie taco again, but said the chicken was good. Overall, we had a fine time at Local Cantina. I have a friend who just loves this place for their margs, but seeing as it was Monday, I wasn't planning to try one. Am I rushing back? No. Would I suggest it? No. As long as El Camino Inn exists, there are no other Mexican restaurants for me."], ["Abigail S.", "I love this place! You can't beat the Cantina Fish taco and free chips and salsa. The rotating draft list is usually pretty good too. Only giving it 4 stars because service can be pretty slow when sitting at a table.

They have a decent selection and chips and salsa are free! There margaritas are good, but their other mixed drinks are just okay. The food is nothing special, but cheap and fast so that bumps it up a notch. The reason that this place gets a 4 star instead of 3 is because of the neighborhood. Clintonville needs some bars and Cantina is bringing a decent bar to a great neighborhood."], ["Walt S.", "First stop at Local Cantina in Grandview was a winner. The visit happened to be a Saturday and around 2PM. \u00a0What I learned was Local Cantina has a weekend brunch menu that runs from 11AM - 4PM. \u00a0What I liked a lot was it was huevos, Huevos and more HUEVOS! \u00a0But first the location and place.Local Cantina is a bit hidden and parking on a Saturday was horrible. \u00a0So what's new for Grandview if you're not parking near the theatre. \u00a0I managed metered parking quickly and strolled over. \u00a0So I'm okay with that. \u00a0Just a door past Aladdin's, Local Cantina (in this humble marketing whiz' opinion) needs a logo upgrade. \u00a0It's name is the logo and you don't see it,... even with a sandwich board on the Grandview Avenue sidewalk. \u00a0Look. \u00a0FInd it. \u00a0And go.Inside it's restaurant and bar which I liked. \u00a0Big enough bar to handle, I'd say 20 - 25 guests comfortably. \u00a0Plenty of tables, too. \u00a0I chose the bar. \u00a0A big barrell of corn chips with salsa is a freebie. \u00a0Muchas gracias, Local Cantina.My order was for huevos rancheros, home fries and some queso (for my chips). \u00a0Out came two sunnyside up eggs on corn tortillas, potatoes with spicy cheesy drizzle. \u00a0All good. \u00a0Way good! \u00a0The prices are not bad for the brunch and there are at least 6 - 7 huevos creations.Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'll swing by Local Cantina for tacos - good looking selection. \u00a0And a marguerita. \u00a0There will be a next time, too. \u00a0Mi nombre es Walter y yo soy un YELP'r."], ["Claudia F.", "Food here has improved since I last ate here.

Went today to try the brunch, and could not have been more disappointed with everything from the service to the food to the temperature in the restaurant. \u00a0It is no exaggeration to say that we were shivering with our winter jackets one. Our drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive, and the food took over 45 minutes. \u00a0Once it did arrive my huevos rancheros weren't even lukewarm. My friend's chorizo skillet was a bit warmer, but it definitely tasted as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp. Informed waitress that dish was incredibly cold, and instead of re-firing the dish, they stuck it in the oven. By the time I receive my dish, my companions had finished their meals. \u00a0The waitress asked if it was any better, to which I let her know it wasn't and she removes the dish. She did ask me if I wanted them to make me a new one, but since we had already been there for over an hour I told her no. Our bills arrive split incorrectly (only two bills, three diners so not rocket science) with the huevos rancheros (of which I had three terrible bites) was still on there. During the nearly hour wait for our three meals, they were out of salsa, and as we were leaving they were out of chips. I could forgive bad service for good food, or bad food with good service but I can't forgive both.

I feel there are better restaurants out there that give a better product of Mexican street food. Maybe this is a place is for a younger crowd and I am getting old. The best part of my experience was a Blood Orange margarita, \u00a0though I didn't end up finishing it due to the sweetness. As for food \u00a0I have a Quesadilla \u00a0that I could have made at home. Prices seemed high and I feel I could have gotten a better product a a food truck.

The Migas and Carnitas tacos are fantastic. \u00a0You can't go wrong with their queso or their quesadillas either. As far as their margaritas go, the Mustache Ride, Blood Orange and the House are all great choices.

He looked at us several times, but no response. We were about ready to leave when he finally came over to us and asked us if we were here for dinner. We replied yes and he sat us at a table. Our waitress came over to us and took our drink orders. We ordered the Nadarita and my wife had \u00a0the blueberry drink. Both were great . We also ordered the guacamole with chips. Both were very tasty! I ordered the shrimp tacos for dinner and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The order came very quickly and we both enjoyed the tacos. The combo of shrimp, avocado, arugula, and lime was amazing. The tacos were temperature hot and wonderful. Our waitress though never explained to us the sauces on the table so we were clueless. After dinner, I saw the couple next to us looking at a dessert menu. Our waitress never offered us the dessert menu so i had to ask for it. We shared the chocolate cake with the banana foster ice cream. Very nice. the ice cream was very good. The cake was a chocolate lava whic is always nice. The decor in the restaurant is exquisite. Very lush. The food was excellent. For what we paid, I thought that the service could have been more personal. We really didn't feel like we were appreciated. Not sure we will go back which is too bad."], ["Amy F.", "I'm a sucker for good Mexican food... and Nada had me at Hola.I've eaten here three times now and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my meal. My favorites: - The Salsa Tasting Trio: The chips are light, flakey and unlike any chips I've ever had. The salsas = amazing! - The grilled salmon tacos- The carnitas tacos- The pastor tacos- All of their margaritasI'm pretty sure that once I make my way through the rest of the menu, the entire menu will be listed as my favorites. Everything is fresh and flavorful. The service is always great as well! Today, we stopped in for lunch and Griffin was our server. My friend has an allergy to onions & peppers that made it hard for her to order from the menu. Griffin had the chef prepare a special batch of guacamole for us that had no onions or peppers. It was delish! He also helped her to create an order for tacos that weren't on the menu so that she could enjoy the Nada flavors without any worry of an allergic reaction. We will definitely be requesting Griffin to be our server when we visit Nada again. He was the sweetest !The Atmosphere is funky and fun, but the bathrooms are probably my favorite of any restaurant. My next visit will be for brunch after seeing the pics of the pork belly & fried egg taco!"], ["Carol N.", "Came with my husband and a friend for a late lunch after my husband had a good first visit and after reading all the positive reviews. We were not disappointed and this may soon become one of my favorite restaurants. The place wasn't busy for lunch on a Saturday when OSU football was away and the Jackets didn't play until later so we were immediately seated. The hostess was more than willing to accommodate my request for a booth to place my daughter's car seat, and offered a sling but I declined. Service was quick and attentive, taking time to describe the ingredients and offerings. Each of us ordered 2 tacos and loved all the flavors. I had the pastor (perfectly spiced and delicious) and arrachara (my favorite; sirloin cooked perfectly with fresh avocado and spicy salsa), husband and friend had the barbacoa. We split the 3-salsa sampler and had to get another basket of chips, they're so good! I also had the tequila mule which was excellent.

That being said, it is in Arena, so everything is going to be priced a little higher than my normal stomping grounds in Clintonville."], ["Gus W.", "Watch out, Bakersfield, Nada's here and contending for the top trendy, upscale Mexican in town. Actually, forget Mexican, this place is just snazzy in general. We were there on Saturday for lunch before most of the customers started filing in, so we got to get a good look at all the interior and funky decor. The girlfriend and I loved it.Our server, and I forget her name, was super helpful and enthusiastic in going over the menu and making recommendations. She was a bit slow at times with the refills, especially since it wasn't busy at all, but I can forgive her for that, because the food was incredible.I decided to leave the pastor tacos for the girlfriend and went with the bacon and egg (pork belly) tacos. In the meantime, we got the guacamole, and it was delicious. My girlfriend liked it more than Bakersfield's, but I'd say they're about on par with each other. However, the homemade chips may have a slight edge here. They were awesome, and I like the fact that the guacamole actually comes with salsa as well.Our food came out pretty quick, and I was not expecting an over-easy egg on top of my pork belly tacos, but I like where their heads at. As soon as I folded it up, the yolk spread out all over the pork belly, combining with the pickled peppers and onions and diablo salsa, forming an incredible taste sensation. The habanero salsa on the table was combined with carrots to form a bright orange color, and it was fantastic on the tacos, giving them a huge kick. My girlfriend now wants to make it at home, because she loved it so much. She was also a huge fan of her pastor tacos.Along with the tacos, we split an order of Mexican mac 'n cheese, and I'm a huge fan of anything with roasted poblano and jalapenos, so that was a winner for me. I thought the two tacos wouldn't be enough food, but I was pretty full by the time I started eating mac 'n cheese and really had to muscle it down.The pricing here is my only gripe. You're going to pay more than you would at Bakersfield, and you're quite far from the trendier area of the Short North. However, I feel the tacos at Nada are slightly bigger and edge out what I had at Bakersfield but only slightly. I'm not sure how busy this place actually gets, but I doubt you'd have to wait nearly as long as you do at Bakersfield. My girlfriend officially loves this spot more, so I'm sure we'll be back, and that's not a problem here, since I thoroughly enjoyed the meal."], ["Breanna B.", "A nicer take on Mexican fare - Nada fancies it up. Their guacamole is hella good. Seriously, eat it with the jicama. It's the perfect fresh crunch to go along with the guac. Always order the double ($12).A margarita is a requirement, I kept my order basic with the a classic 'rita, salt on the rim. It comes in a high ball glass and one lasted me through dinner.Baja battered fish tacos were my meal of choice. $15 gets you 3 hearty tacos with corn tortillas (no sides) but I was full to the max after that meal. Loved that they paired it with some guacamole. I haven't had that with fish tacos in the past and it's a good complement to the overall flavor.The decor is all intentional with little surprises tucked inside the seemingly elegant wallpaper and fabrics. It's like an adult version of the game, \"I spy...\". Plus, their secret party room is unreal. I'd book that for a birthday party or bachelorette in a heartbeat."], ["Douglas G.", "Went to Nada today because my lady is seriously obsessed with tacos, and it was some seriously good mexican! We went for brunch and it was unique/delicious.I ordered the eggs benedicto, with crab + avocado holindase sauce and it was teriffic and very fresh. I did not taste as much crab as i was hoping but that was perfectly fine. My lady got the egg and pork belly tacos, and she was the winner. They were some of not only the best breakfast tacos but tacos ive ever had in general! So good.The portions dont look that large when youre served but thats deceiving, i was very full and satisfied when we left. We also got the guacamole to start, and it was as good as id expect from a restaurant like this.Its a pretty nice environment, not your run of the mill mexican restaurant but a little more up-scale and i enjoyed it! A good change of pace. But be careful... They have pretty fair prices but with a couple drinks and sides we racked up a pretty nice bill in a pretty quick time!"], ["Donna O.", "Nada es muy bueno, and a great place for whatever you're looking for in an upscale setting. Dark wood, low lighting, backlit bar separated from the main dining area, semi-open kitchen, tequila on tap. Both the setting and clientele are, as fellow diner Lori put it, \"very nouveau-Short North.\" (I have another term for this, but she is much better at polite wit than I am. Ahem.)Anyway. We made a reservation for 8pm and were seated quickly by a rotating staff of hosts. Our server, Molly, was friendly and answered our questions and made suggestions for combinations. The tacos come in threes, and they are mix and match - the menu is a little confusing, as prices are listed for three-of-the-same rather than a la carte. There are also non-taco options.But, back up to the appetizers. We got the salsa trio and of course, we ate all the chips because no matter what you tell yourself, once the chips appear, it's nom time. The salsas were delish! Most especially the habanero salsa - hot, spicy AND sweet. I'd eat that with a spoon, no chips required (and to be honest, I did dip my spoon in a couple of times, just 'cause).I ordered the pescatarian options - shrimp, salmon and Portobello mushroom tacos. The shrimp taco came with arugula and a chipotle aioli, and with a little dab of the habanero salsa, was pretty darn close to perfect. The Portobello taco was also great, and all of its ingredients gently enhanced the flavor of the mushroom - which I like. The salmon was cooked to near-dryness, and overcooked salmon is extremely pungent. There was no way I could even consider a second bite. However, two tacos paired with chips and salsa are plenty to fill you up at Nada. They were happy to bring more habanero salsa for us, and refresh water and drinks regularly.Drinks - they do have the aforementioned tequila and all associated drink combinations. They also put tequila in the sangria, which made me sorry I'd ordered beer. The cerveza here is all bottled, gotta save those taps for Mexican gold!Overall, it's a great upscale experience that won't break the bank, staff are efficient and friendly, drinks strong, and the food is good. It's worth making a reservation in order to check it out."], ["Catherine J.", "A-OK, in the best way!The Arena District needed a restaurant with a little more flair than the chainy offerings that have haunted the area (not that chains are bad, and I know this isn't the only Nada -- but I think you know what I'm saying). I think Nada mostly delivers on a promise of something different. Tacos are fun, and everyone loves guac. The cocktails are imaginative. The interior is festive and feels upscale. I enjoyed my tacos and the plating. It was the perfect stop before catching a show at the LC Pavilion. Good for groups, too.I was initially annoyed when I heard people complaining of the price here -- you can't compare Nada prices to a taco truck when you consider the full waitstaff, gorgeous and creative interior, and location. Apples to oranges and all that. However, after visiting, I did have a little bit of sticker shock... cocktails felt a dollar or two too high for comparable restaurants in Columbus. I'd agree that other fun full service taco restaurants are significantly less expensive. I'm sure Nada sets prices at what they need to be to cover costs and still be profitable, but it's just a bit spendy to do on a regular basis.So, Nada won't be where I think to go if I just want a fun taco night, but I am happy to make this a stop before or after attending other entertainment in the area."], ["Emma L.", "Nada is definitely a welcome (and much needed) addition to the Arena District. Bf & I decided to try Nada for a fun boozy brunch. I was already familiar with the prices and portions before walking in so I was prepared to spend a bit more than the typical brunch. I made a reservation via Open Table (through Yelp), called an Uber and we were on our way.The building exterior is really gorgeous and I'm obsessed with the red stained wood. It smelled over-the-top smoky, which I didn't like but once we got inside it was fine. The interior is well done and suitable for groups large or small. We got lucky and got to sit in the semi-private seating at the back of the restaurant, perched a bit above the main floor so we could spy on everyone.Every host and server we interacted with was top notch. Friendly, helpful and the right amount of conversational.We started with Chips, Salsa ($2) & Guacamole ($7). The chips are thicker and a little greasy, but I was into it. Unfortunately we must've gotten the bottom of the barrel because we had tiny little miniature chips. The guacamole is very good and I love the slices of jicama they serve with it. I would like about 12 of those instead of 2. For our mains, we each ordered Barbacoa tacos (2 for $10) and split a side of Mexican Mac & Cheese ($8). Everything was so so tasty and I liked the tacos much more than I expected (there weren't many veggies and I usually load it up). Honestly we couldn't tell the difference between the regular and the spicy, maybe they forgot one was supposed to be diablo style? At first I was afraid we wouldn't have enough food (he's a vacuum) but we had the perfect amount. Also, the Mac & Cheese was addicting, I could have slammed my face into the bowl, but I'm a lady. Ah, yes, the cocktails. We ended up on a little tour around the cocktail menu and loved every. single. one. Run down:- Bloody Maria ($7): Bloody Mary with Tequila. Great twist on a standard. - Sparkling Grapefruit ($7): Small, but tasty. Sweet, but not overly so.- Tequila Sunrise ($6): Thought it was weak at first. Nope, just well made.- Peach Fuzz ($6): YUM THIS TASTES LIKE VACATION GET ME ON A BEACH- Velvet Underground ($8): Most interesting cocktail of the bunch.

It's a solid five star experience: great food, great drinks, beautiful restaurant, and our server was awesome.It's just. It's really hard for me to pay $15 for three tacos, no sides. Yes, they were good tacos. No, they weren't significantly better than $1.50 tacos from a good taco truck. And while I understand that Nada has bills to pay that a taco truck clearly doesn't have, I also feel like the food should be elevated enough to reflect that and give me an elevated experience.(Also . . . I mean, just saying, you couldn't throw some rice and beans on the side? I don't think a cheaper-yet-still-delicious food even exists.)Maybe I'm too simple; maybe other people put enough stock in being able to eat in a beautiful setting instead of at a picnic table outside a beat-up truck that they want to pay that much for tacos. I'm not EveryYelper, for sure.I can see myself going back and having a cocktail and some chips and guac on a night when things are slow in the Arena District (because for real, I'm not trying to be anywhere near Arena when there's a game or a concert or a confluence of bros getting their Friday night on).

Starting off with the easy stuff, our waitress Sophia was highly attentive and informative. She helped me make the right beer choice, and I was not disappointed in my Stiff-Arm IPA in the least bit! The set up of the restaurant was really classy. I felt positively important just from eating there. It reminded me of how grand the Cincinnati location was last I visited. I ordered Papa's Ceviche as an appetizer, and it was delicious. The fresh seafood flavors were pronounced at the beginning but it was capped off with a nice spicy finish. Very balanced. I had the pleasure of trying \u00a0both the veggie tacos and the baja fish tacos. The former was very savory with mushrooms and cheese while the latter was fresh yet not too strong of a flavor. I was highly satisfied and can't wait to go back!"], ["Arvid Y.", "Nada is a new addition to the Arena district restaurant scene. It a modern, dare I say \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant that's been successful in Cincinnati for quite a while now.My first impression after walking into the restaurant was \"wow.\" The interior is modern and luxurious with an abundance of warm lighting and wooden trim. The atmosphere is both classy and cozy. The bar area is particularly impressive with illuminated liquor bottle cabinets and hexagonal mosaic tile backsplash. Fist bump to the interior design team.The food was good. We sampled a variety of appetizers and I pretty much enjoyed everything. The guacamole was fresh and the queso was tasty. However my favorite appetizer was the haba\u00f1ero \"kreeper\" salsa. It's truly addictive and is a must-try if you enjoy spice. It comes with the salsa tasting trio, but perhaps you can just request it with your regular chips and salsa.I ordered the grilled salmon tacos, which came recommended by the waiter. They were excellent - moist and full of flavor without being too fishy. The cilantro and chipotle crema complimented the fish nicely, adding a bit of heat and sour. $19 is a bit steep for fish tacos, but it does come with 3 good sized tacos and you are paying for the atmosphere as well. I believe the pricing is less for lunch.I was very impressed with the service, especially since they just opened 2 weeks ago. The staff was on point and there were absolutely no hiccups.

At our server, Adams recommendation,I ordered the pork belly and salmon tacos. \u00a0I also ordered the fish (I think cod) tacos. Let me tell you...the fish taco was very good but the other two beyond delicious! I mean totally over the top so good! I loved them and can't wait to go back for more. We also had chips and salsa and guacamole...all very good as well, especially the guac. Someone ordered soup...pumpkin or squash that looked really good. I would like to try that too.The service...these guys really went all out to take care is us. And I don't think it was because we were a group of yelpers. They all, especially Adam and Molly, seemed to genuinely want to take care of us and make everything perfect, which it was. In talking with Molly after most of the group was gone, I learned of the restaurant's customer service philosophy and hiring practices.

One thing I did notice was how clean it was. The place seems huge and there was no dust on the (fake) plants or visible grease in the kitchen, floors were swept, bathrooms were spotless. Our server, Roberto, was friendly and on top of it. Kept our glasses full without being buggy, which is sometimes rare for restaurants like this. Much appreciated!I ordered the Burrito Carnitas ($11.50), which oddly did not come with carnitas, but your choice of chicken, steak or pork. I went with the chicken and it was pretty delish. The flour tortilla burrito had grilled onions and peppers and sides of Rice, Refried Beans, Sour Cream and some surprisingly good Guacamole. The only thing I was meh about was the cheese on my burrito. I had hoped for melty white queso sauce and got melted shredded cheddar instead. Still, really good.Bf had an order fail. He got something with rice, chicken and mushrooms in a red sauce ($10.50). Oddly, there was a lot of celery in his dish which really overpowered it and made the whole thing taste a little off. He was definitely a fan of my burrito though...One kind of nice thing about Casa Hacienda is that they give you a little plate of beans and slaw to accompany their spicy salsa and chips. It was nice having a little variety to start the meal, though I did feel like the slaw was a little bland.

But if you get the right ones, you're going to be impressed. I absolutely love their empanadas, which come in a fried dough that has just the right touch of crispiness and sweetness. I highly recommend any beef dish as well, as the beef they're using is extremely tender and has a great slightly-sweet marinade.For some reason, they thought it made sense to grill my quesadilla with the lettuce and the tomatoes already on the inside. Why would you do this? It was positively disgusting. My quesadilla could have been good, but all I could taste was this warm, floppy, greasy, stringy lettuce shitting up the entire thing. Get the Baleada instead. It is almost the same thing, with delicious and flavorful beans instead of the nasty \"cold\" ingredients. It also comes cheaper. In fact, you'd be remiss to miss out on it if you ordered from here. It is simultaneously one of the most delicious, filling, and cheap items on the menu. The tortilla is thick, floury, buttery, and slightly browned, and the baleada comes packed with gooey cheese and plenty of the aforementioned tender beef.I have to strongly advise against the tamales; instead of wrapping the tamale in a corn husk, it is coated and fried in a greasy corn slurry resembling polenta or grits. The corn coating completely overwhelms the flavor of the tamale, and it's so greasy and unseasoned that it hardly tastes like anything. The inside wasn't any better though - the chicken was dry, and its marinade's taste resembled Campbell's soup.The plain arepa was just okay, but for the most part it didn't taste like anything, it lacked salt, and it wasn't worth what I paid for it. It's just a boring little grilled piece of corn patty, so be sure to splurge for the cheese and chorizo if you expect to get anything good out of it. To end on a positive note, there's the fried banana/plantain dishes. Fucking phenomenal. I got a special mixed up with soft chicken, flavorful and crispy sausage slices, and decent Spanish rice. The sweetness of the plantains works surprisingly well with the mix of meat, rice, and veggies, and the thing adds up to at least a pound of Latino spice goodness.I've definitely eaten from better taco trucks, but El Manantial can provide a great meal, especially for the experienced customer. I'd suggest staying away from the common crowd-pleasers and getting a sampling of the South American cuisine that they have to offer. They've figured out the latter, but the former is just cringe-worthy."], ["Alex D.", "I went there at 2:30 on a Friday and ordered a steak burrito. I had heard great things about this place.

Then she comes up and says \"burrito\" and the guy who ordered after me sheepishly steps up, turns to us, and says \"you didn't order burritos did you?\" and I said no. Not that it is a strike, but come on. First come, first serve. It made everyone look around like what is up?So I finally get my order and I say \"can I have more of the red sauce than green\" Why? Because I was there not 2 days earlier and it was awesome. Truly hot. That woman had the nerve to open the box, look at what was in there, and say \"you have enough.\"YOU HAVE ENOUGH. Yep. That was actually said to a paying customer who tipped preemptively, got shafted on service, and requested more salsa. I would have paid for it! Or, given back the green ones which I don't care for. Guess what? It was not enough. It is 3 little red salsas for an arepa, empanada, 2 tamales, 3 tacos? The green ones went unused.The food is still good, but I will be hard pressed to be back with that type of response and attitude. I hope someone tries to orders a lot of food and is willing to pay for it and she tells them they have enough.

Why!? I was very disappointed, as the thought of a chicharron taco was making me salivate. Their only options were tacos, quesadillas and tortas. Meat options were steak, chicken and al pastor. This was very disconcerting as they had a very large menu that included far more than these paltry options. I opted for an al pastor taco, al pastor quesadilla and chicken taco. I was literally shocked when he told me I owed him $18.00 for three items from a taco cart in the parking lot of a convenience store. My jaw may have hit the floor. I handed over my cash as I though \"I only ordered three items, right? Did I order more than three items? These better be the best *$**@*@#&*@ tacos and quesadilla I have ever had.\" They were not the best. They were not even good.The taco base price was $1.50. That means I spent $3.00 on tacos. Was the quesadilla $15.00, or were the toppings they gave me worth $9.00? You see, I made the mistake of saying yes when he asked me if I wanted everything on my tacos. These tacos were fit for any gringo who's never had a real taco. They were piled with cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream and onions. What happened to onion and cilantro with a slice of lime? This math really isn't adding up, and 24 hours later it is still confusing and offending me.The meats were greasy, gristly and flavorless. The quesadilla was so soggy with grease it was inedible. The tacos I can't really judge because all I tasted was the plethora of toppings.The 14 year old who was handling the window was rude and not at all helpful. I asked when they have empanadas and chicharrones and his answer was \"sometimes\" Seriously? \"sometimes\"? He came back to me a few minutes later and inaudibly said \u00a0something about some Wednesdays when so and so mystery woman brings the something or another (i.e. authentic food, I hope?).I will come back here on a Wednesday with hopes of trying their empanadas and chicharrones, but I can't say that I have high hopes.

The smokey red sauce on the table was pretty tasty, but the tacos really didn't need them in my opinion. I'd say the braised pork (Cochinita Pibil) was my favorite, but the other two were cooked about as perfect as they could be.

The tacos were just not good. I had the corn, chile pork, and shortrib. First, I did not know corn truffles was basically corn mold. So, that was a shock as I was imagining yummy fried corn fritter bonbons. Regardless it was a total grease bomb along with my other two tacos. The chile pork was so greasy it dripped down my face and hands staining them orange, like a child whose parent didn't supervise them with their kool-aide glass.

As with most locations in this area, parking can be tricky in the Short North.2) Go on an odd day of the week at an odd time. Primetime on the weekend can be difficult to find a table. You may have a 2+ hour wait. Been there, done that. Not entirely worth it. Fear not! Go on a Sunday at 8 p.m. We went and had many seating options, but decided to hang at the bar. Quicker to get your margarita! 3) Since you may be sitting at the bar, you are required to order a margarita. Margaritas are served in a mason jar, which is always a cute touch. They are fairly strong so one may be enough. They are pretty yummy so you may order a few.4) Once you've had a few margaritas, you probably should eat something. So what should you eat? Order some chips. Yes, I said order. Chips and salsa are going to cost you $3, but they are well-worth your bucks. You get two varieties of salsa - one is green and mild, the other is red and smoky. And, those chips are pretty darn tasty too! They give you more than enough for sharing between two people.5) Finally, when you start to get serious, you'll want some more substantial food. Get the tacos. They have a nice selection of choices. In my opinion, the fish taco is the best. But, honestly, I can't complain about any of the tacos.

I started with a margarita. It was really fresh - no sweet and sour mix here. We shared the chips with guacamole and the cheese dip with chorizo. The guacamole is very chunky, so beware if you prefer a smoother guac. I loved all the huge chunks of avocado and the acidity from the lime. It pairs really well with the salty tortilla chips. My bf loved the cheese dip with chorizo. The chorizo was a little sweeter than I like, but the cheese dip itself was delicious and creamy. It's not the artificial, smooth white cheese that you would get at other Mexican restaurants. The cheese dip had some texture which I actually really liked.

Come to Bakersfield! This is the place for you - drinks are light so don't worry about having too much fun, and you'll likely lose a few pounds from standing around waiting for a seat and emptying all of your cash out of your pockets into their register. The tacos are actually awesome - 2 whole bites of awesomeness. Actually about one and a half because you'll lose the residual as the corn tortilla crumbles in your hand. It is nice that they leave squirt bottles of salsa on the tables to use at your unrefrigerated convenience. I think the queso is baked, which sounds potentially awesome but it's lumpy and sticks to the bowl everytime. In all honesty, I do love the skinny margarita because it's straight tequila and lime juice so you know you're getting actually what you pay for and I prefer my drinks more strong/sour than sweet. Though the service has been mediocre at best, usually messing up at least one item on the bill, I guess it's succeeding as one of the newer short north hot spots. And although cynical, I think Bakersfield will continue to improve in service and quality when the hype starts to die a little bit.

Cool atmosphere, and I'm a sucker for a place with those industrial roll-up windows that make you feel like you're eating on a patio (but inside!). Magnificent 7 was playing on the television, Johnny Cash was playing on the speakers, and Wild Irish Rose was the shot of the day; definitely consistent with the message they are trying to convey. Our server was very attentive, and everyone got exactly what they ordered. I had the short rib taco and the pastor taco, and we all shared some chips and salsa. I'm assuming the salsa was a salsa verde, as it was green with a lot of cilantro. I typically prefer the traditional tomato salsa, but I'm pro cilantro and it had a great flavor. Watch out though, because that heat will sneak up on you! Both of my tacos were delicious, and the short rib was tender and flavorful. I had a house margarita, which was strong and tasty, and not syrupy sweet.Overall, I would say that this place is worth checking out. I think that the prices are reasonable ($3-4 for a taco) but you might end up spending a bit more than you expect if you want to walk away full. El Camino has cheaper tacos, but less variety. There doesn't seem to be any discernible happy hour, so that was a bummer, but the prices are affordable enough that you could come here after work and spend less than $20 for a few drinks/tacos.

I think they were missing something... maybe some fresh pico de gallo or something. \u00a0Other than that, they were okay.I had the guacamole. \u00a0It was tasty. \u00a0A little overly chunky (and I usually love chunky guac) but good. \u00a0I also tried the queso... it was interesting. \u00a0Not bad. \u00a0Just different. \u00a0My honey got the short rib sammy and raved about it. \u00a0I can't lie- I tasted it, it was deeeelicious (sorry to my beloved cows).My margarita was delightful. \u00a0It reminded me of lemonade... very very good.Overall, with a little expansion in the taco-size and taco-options arena (maybe some more veggie options-- the current options are a little boring), I think this place could be awesome. \u00a0Just needs a little work."], ["Rakesh M.", "This was my second visit.

The guac and chips are phenomenal. They're guac is one of the best I've had. I've also had their queso before, it's good, but the guac is definitely better.

Pretty good beer selection, too!"], ["Kyle L.", "Easily my favorite place in Columbus to get tacos. Everything from scratch, amazing fire roasted salsa, and a perfect house margarita. One of my favorites are the fish tacos with the citrus slaw. So delicious, light, and filling. They also have some of the best salsa I've ever had. They fire roast everything according to one of the servers. I generally order some with my meal and then some to go. I snack on it throughout the week. Great price points. I often go here for dinner before going out. I have never had a bad meal. Always packed on the weekends so I've been going here for lunch more often.

The only real downside besides fall apart tacos, is the noise level. I feel like a granny saying this but we literally couldn't hear anyone at our table when they spoke/shouted, It was that loud. So we all basically sat there in silence eating. No Bueno. Your guests want to talk about your food and what's new with their lives.

Their margaritas are also great.I'll be back!"], ["Claire D.", "Despite my 3 star rating, I visit Condado pretty regularly because it's within walking distance of my apartment and the atmosphere is pretty nice. Also the tacos are pretty substantial portion sizes, so I can get a meal for less than $5 typically. I usually go for happy hour, which is from 4pm to 7pm, so you can actually eat at a normal dinner time (rather than your typical super early happy hour) and still get a fairly good deal. Note: You have to sit at the tall bar tables to be eligible for happy hour prices. You can't sit at the restaurant tables.Condado is known for its tacos. There are pre-set options, but I usually build my own because they're the same price and you can get exactly what you want on your taco. Each table is given paper checklists and you go down the list and check off what kinds of tortilla/wrap/bowl, meats, cheeses, veggies, sauces, etc. you want.Last time I went to Condado, I got a flour tortilla with thai chili tofu, red cabbage, jicama slaw, tomatoes, queso fresco, and chipotle crema on it, along with a prickly pear (\"tuna\" cactus) margarita. The tofu was fried and was coated in a very sweet, yet spiced sauce. I've been pretty disappointed by Condado's carnitas, which has been pretty wet and flavorless, rather than the greasy pork-filled goodness you'd expect from your carnitas. The tofu had a good flavor, but it was definitely reminiscent of bastardized American Chinese food (think sweet and sour sauce). I also got homemade chips, queso blanco, and guacamole on the side. The homemade chips were fried in-house and salted to perfection. The queso and guac were pretty standard (nothing too special, nor bad enough to complain about).The atmosphere is lively, but I've never had to wait for a table. I almost always see other grad students in my OSU program when I go to Condado (I think because of the location?), so it seems to be a popular place with a lot of regulars. Expect Condado to be more restaurant-y than bar-y like some other Short North taco places Bakersfield. The Dia de Los Muertos street art on Condado's walls adds to the artsy/alternative feel and it reminds me of some of the murals when I used to live in the Mission district of San Francisco.TD;LR The tacos are fusion/alternative and not traditional Mexican."], ["Kristin C.", "This place had fun, affordable tacos of a decent size with cool combinations of ingredients. \u00a0I hear their happy hour is amazing, but everyone has discovered it so word is it is almost not worth it. \u00a0It can get a little loud in here since it has a huge warehouse feel to it."], ["Gwen W.", "Nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, not even worth TALKING about :( Too bad, too. Several things that were off, leading to the one star. But first, the positives. I do like the decor of this joint. I'm a big fan of wall art - especially graffiti. So yay for that. The long communal tables are always a hit for me. The more meeting new people, the better Timing and taste were the major low points for me. First off, it took the servers way too long to get orders. They wanted to spend too much time explaining the concept of this establishment, rather than just letting us figure it out, and answering questions if anyone gets confused. Almost 35 minutes? Really?What'd you order, Gwen? Chips and Salsa Verde to start. The chips weren't bad. Basically, fried slices of flour tortillas. The salsa, however, did not get the same respect. All I could taste was sweet sugar. No tomatillos flavor. No spices. Just green. I decided to make my own tacos, since that's what a majority of Yelp Reviews suggest. One House Made Chorizo. And a Chicken. I couldn't get over the chorizo's metallic taste. It was very pronounced. Not good at all. No sausage taste :( The toppings on that taco didn't help to hide the taste. The grilled chicken was ok, in comparison. Nothing spectacular, but I could taste a hint of the protein. The extremely mediocre taste did not leave a lasting impression."], ["Michelle B.", "Hands down, my favorite taco joint in Columbus. The service was pretty mediocre at first, but I think our bartender just needed to get caught up. Once he did it was all good. The menu is slightly confusing when placing your order, but they'll walk you through it. They also gave us some suggestions. You can keep it simple or get a little exotic with your fillings and salsas. You've got to try the ones with the flour and hard corn tortilla- stuck together with either warm queso or guacamole. I was seriously day dreaming of it at work yesterday. I've got to get my Condado fix soon."], ["Gus W.", "I had the awesome opportunity to try Condado tonight, and the atmosphere and food was fantastic. They aren't quite done with the decorating, but the place looks fantastic so far. They have plenty of great draft beers and high-end liquor behind the bar to let you know that they mean business in the Short North. You get to create your own tacos or choose from pre-made favorites that were put together, and all of the options that we were able to try were delicious. The chorizo and brisket were fantastic, and their sauces were so tasty. Considering this was a soft opening, the service was pretty stellar, and our server in particular had a great understanding of everything on the menu, We were able to meet the owner and manager, and both were able to take time to chat with us about everything on the menu, and their ideas for the future of the bar.I expect this place to be a new favorite in the Short North scene and draw a good amount of attention from Bakersfield and many other bars in the area. By the time we left, the restaurant was packed, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves knowing it was their first real night in service. I could see this place being a great hangout late at night or being a spot where Short North goers start off with a good meal before they get the chance to explore the rest of the neighborhood. This is another great step in connecting the Short North to the South campus and should draw a great following in the weeks to come."], ["Christopher L.", "I've been here a few times and usually have a 3.5/5 experience. Last night was by far one of the worst experiences I've had. To their defense, there was 9-12 of us last night and a few people joined a little later. However, simple customer service isn't hard if you take the time. We sat at a table that was never cleaned off.

Then, he offered everyone \u00a0complimentary drinks which Turned this 1/5 to a 2/5. Look, I get it...

Note - if you don't like \"hipster\" style places, this isn't the restaurant for you!Upon walking in, we stood there and waited for about 5 minutes before a server came over to greet us. Except, it wasn't a greeting. It was more like getting seated by a mime. Total silence. In addition, we went right at dusk, and this place was very, very poorly lit, I could barely see my order form (more on those below...). We were seated at our table and looked at the menus we were handed. They were drink menus. And while extensive, we had no clue how to order food. The teenage waitress finally came over and explained that you must use these \"scantron-esque\" forms to order food (see pictures). A long order form that basically makes the customer do the work of the wait staff. You mark what you want, what you want on it, how many you want, and give that to your server. Okay. Individual item ordering, I kinda liked it. As opposed to most other places, that you have to order \"meals\" (of which sometimes I don't want the full meal).For my drink, I ordered a banana margarita and expecting it to taste horrible. To my amazement, it actually ranks as one of the best margaritas I've ever had! The only disappointing part was that it was $7 and came in a small mason jar, half filled with ice of course.I ordered 4 tacos (more than enough for the starving customer), and my friend ordered 3. We waited over an hour for the tacos to be made and brought out, which was absurd. But before that, we had some chips and queso. The queso dip was awesome, really thick and very flavorful. The chips were the exact opposite though, they were horrible. Over salted and over fried. Not to mention we pretty much got a basket of crumbs from the start. But, this is a matter of personal taste.The tacos were indeed amazing, as all the other reviewers have noted. Full of flavor, and I have some comments on the ingredients. The plain hard taco shells will fall apart with something runny (sauce, salsa, etc.). I had a shrimp taco that had only two pieces of shrimp. The pineapple salsa is a must try. Get cilantro and onions on your taco, it adds a light, airy flavor that just makes all the others seem bolder and more flavorful. And all the meat is good, I tried each one, and they were all awesome, unique in their own sense.The worst part of the whole experience, the young waitress that came over to clear off our table halfway through our meal, took the plate that was under my taco, out from under me, while I was holding and eating my taco! I just sat there, face full of taco, looking around, before using the chip bowl as my plate (you do need one as things tend to fall out, that's not a knock on the taco though). Also, I ordered a side of sour cream (since everyone skimps on the sour cream), it cost me a dollar, and I got a teaspoon full, which rubbed me a little the wrong way.TLDR - good experience. I'd go there again, and I'd recommend other people give it a try. Go for the food, but don't expect good (or even decent) service. If they had a drive thru, it'd be perfect."], ["Jonathan B.", "People kept telling me about this place but I kept dismissing it because of the location.

The ambiance is unique with a variety of table settings from booths to traditional tables and high tops. The food menu can be a bit confusing your first time around, but servers will likely help you. I am a huge fan of their taco options that have both a hard shell and soft shell with queso. While these options add $1 to the price, they also add some premium toppings even with meat, so I find it to be well worth the price. The tacos are also much larger than tacos you will pick up almost anywhere else in the short north. I'd recommend just getting two and maybe a side - it'll be more than enough. The drinks are fairly good and I will say service is fair but nothing to write home about. Bottom line - definitely check this place out for the tacos."], ["Aly S.", "This place is a gem!

First visit: walk in, yes it was a beautiful galley hop Saturday night, so it was very loud and busy. With that it was overwhelming and nerve racking. The host was very nice and took my name and also offered the bar. (I prefer the bar because it's faster and more attentive service). We get this guy who is busy yes, but very nice and helpful. We are newbies here, he could tell. So ordering is different, it's like a sushi place were you write down what you want on a piece of paper. And you Build your own taco.

So yes it was amazing, and the service was prompt and welcoming. PLUS they were really busy, so for that they for a little behind, but they recognized that and gave everyone free salsa and chips.

It reminds me of a place that I used to visit in Atlanta called The Great American Burrito Company which was a build-your-own burrito place that had every topping that you could think of. I also thought it was VERY economical. I mean, where else can u get a decent meal for under $10? With that being said, my only disappointment was unfortunately, the food. Maybe it was just my selection or maybe they were having a bad night, but everything lacked distinctive flavor. It all kinda tasted the same. And I'm used to flavors that \"pop\"! The chicken could've been seasoned and chargrilled, and the pulled pork and the brisket should not have tasted similar.

I love that I can get a $3 taco with a ton of toppings with a full bar and table service. It made a delicious meal into a nice dining experience. I ordered 3 tacos: pork, chicken and portobello mushroom. The pork was great, the chicken was good, but the mushrooms were AMAZING. I've never had mushrooms in a taco before. The way they cooked them made them taste almost meaty. Big ups for the pineapple guacamole, too. My friend, a big Mexican food lover, just kept saying \"my life is ruined...in the best way possible!\" With so many ways to customize your order, you could come in every day for a year and never eat the same thing twice. I love that novelty! Plus, they have a full bar and great taps. I had a margarita with prickly pear flavoring. So delicious without being crazy sweet. They really put a lot of time into decor and atmosphere. It was pretty dim inside with incredible murals covering the walls. There was a range of seating, including a large high top table with connected stools. Here's where my only complaint comes: it's so loud in here! I understand restaurants can get loud during the busy dinner hour. But those aforementioned high top stools? They squeak like crazy, just adding to the high volume.

The ordering system is a bit stressful if you are worries about the perfect taco but every taco that we made was so good that I'm not sure you can really go wrong. They also have some suggestions of combinations. You start with a shell or a combination shell that has some items included. My favorite was the Goody Goody. The \"crunch\" and the guac in it make an amazing combination. The peezler was a close second with refried beans between the soft and hard shells. The chicken was tasty.

You recognize that she has problems, and she's a little embarrassing, but you love her anyway. It's a bit tricky now, though, since most Mexican places aren't open on Easter. Even though I mostly avoid chains now, I do have a special place in my heart for Abuelo's. Mostly, I really like this place. The guacamole is fresh, you can get a decent margarita without any sour mix, and the food is pretty darn tasty. But I would be an irresponsible Yelper, if I didn't warn you all about the ribeye. Abuelos makes a big deal out of their prime rib. I've had it a few times, and it's pretty good! But...the ribeye. It's partially my fault for ordering a steak at that price. I should have known it was too good to be true. Do you remember Ponderosa? I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to Abuelo's. I think it's a terrific value all in all. \u00a0Just don't order the ribeye. And the new Do It Yourself POS system is pretty tacky.I think the family is going to Abuelo's this Easter!

That being said, I have to say the overall taste of the food is just okay. \u00a0I tried the chicken and fish fajitas. My meal was decent, still satisfying, and the portions were huge. The rest of our group got everything from steaks, enchiladas, tacos, and seafood. \u00a0By the looks of it, everyone else's meals were hooked up too. There's a huge selection on their menu so finding something to settle on isn't too tough. \u00a0The dessert menu is also extensive.My only issue has to be with the service. The crew here is very nice, but took some time to take our orders and even longer to serve it. They serve baskets of chips while you wait for your main dishes. Our group had their chips refilled at least 3 times because the food took that long. Plus, their chips are so light and addicting that you can't help but kill it while you wait.Even though I'm not a huge fan of this type of Mexican food, I thought that the waiters and waitresses were great.

The servings are large portions and I did not finish my meal. I did, however, see other selections I would rather have had, but this was after my selection.Once again this is a good restaurant and typical of national chains, but it does not compare to the small Mexican style, Mom and Pa restaurants I have been to over the last several years.

They have a pretty quick turnaround, and we weren't waiting a long time for our food. The woman taking my order rushed us and had a really bad attitude. I went up a second time to order a couple more tacos, and she acted like I was interrupting her, like a child or a nuisance. Fix the attitude, and I'd gladly come back. (2) Taste and quality -- Taste and quality was ALL there. I highly recommend any one of the tacos. The food was extremely fresh. When you order, keep in mind that tacos are at least $2 for one. I would recommend getting one of each taco and then going from there to see what you like best. \u00a0The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the steak burrito (I cannot attest to any other kind of burrito). Although it was fresh, the taste was bland.(3) Space -- This is a come as you please establishment. When you go inside, there are several high top table with stools and regular tables (fit up to 4 people, but I'm sure you could push them together to accommodate your party).

Next up, I found out about Los Gauchos Taequira and that was my favorite for about 3 weeks. That journey continues as just recently I discovered......Hass. Think of it as Los Gauchos with more seasoned food minus the peppers and onions on the table. Larger space, smaller menu, and slightly more flavor all lead to a wonderful dining experience"], ["Michael M.", "This place may have been having a bad day when I ordered food, but this first visit to Hass is not going to change up my routine. Los Guachos still reigns as the best taquieria, followed by the Taco Loco. I don't explore the Eastside as much compared to the west side of town so maybe there are taco trucks on the east side better better or as good and I just haven't found them yet.I went ahead and ordered the burrito Hass with Pastor, and well everything tasted good nothing was outstanding or different compared to some of the other businesses I named. Also the meat had too much gristle that was inedible and made it harder to enjoy my burrito because the last thing you want is to pullout something you just got done chewing on from your mouth. Even the gristle is something I would let slide but I took my order to go and the salsa cups that they use are very small to begin with and both of the salsa cups were filled up about halfway meaning for a good size burrito, I only had about an ounce of salsa for the entire burrito. It's little things like this that might make somebody not return especially when there're other taco places that are more convenient for me and are better.I will give this place another try but just not anytime soon. The only real positive I can give this place is the layout of the seating, big ample space and plenty seats unlike Los Guachos which is extremely cramped at times."], ["Mary B.", "Stopped by after seeing good Yelp reviews. This is a fast causal mexican restaurant. \u00a0Grab a few different tacos, quesadilla, \u00a0burritos without breaking the bank. They serve beer and margaritas too. I ordered a margarita and it wasn't too sweet and rather delious. We ordered queso dip, salsa and chips while we waited. The queso was really runny but had a slight kick of jalape\u00f1o. \u00a0Not my favorite but the homemade chips made up for it. I got the shrimp tacos. Lightly battered and fried shrimp with a crunchy slaw and a creamy sauce. It was amazing and a must try. The service here was excellent and helpful since it was our first visit. We will be back for sure."], ["Fred B.", "ARE YOU FU##ING KIDDING ME...?!? \u00a0HOW HAVE WE NEVER BEEN TO HASS...?!? \u00a0(thank you, Tina!)OMG it's so good. \u00a0Every one of the 4 meats we tried - carne asada, carnitas, al pastor and fish were all absolutely delicious.Most great taco places do 1 kind of meat very well, and others decently. \u00a0HASS does all of them incredibly well.We ate their meat in tacos, burritos and tortas - all great.Maybe the best $5.99 margaritas in town.Excellent. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Wonderful. \u00a0I'm stuffed from all we ate, and I'm already thinking about the next time we'll come back...!"], ["Vin R.", "Once again, the best Columbus ethnic food is found in random strip malls.Hass is no secret to foodies, but was a pleasant surprise for me as I rarely venture outside of 270 when dining out. My wife and I split several tacos--our favorites being the fish taco and carnitas. \u00a0A rarity for us, we actually finished our entire order in one sitting."], ["Zach T.", "This is one of the better taco places in the city. Al pastor is my favorite kind of meat, so I judge all my tacos off of that. Personally, I think Los Guachos has the best pastor on the city, but this place isn't too far behind. The meat itself is well seasoned and has a nice texture to it after they throw it on the grill. One thing I didn't like was that the pineapple comes diced. I prefer having a nice big chunk of pineapple, but to each their own PPP. Besides that tho the taste is on point. These tacos are kinda pricey tho ($2 for al pastor) which also knocks it down. \u00a0I will say tho that I liked the horchata here a lot more than Los Guachos, so be sure to order a cup of it! \u00a0Finally, the salsas here are also pretty good so experiment with those. Happy eating!"], ["Gwen W.", "I organized a Yelp UYE at this joint last night. It's had been a several months since my last stop in here. The food hasn't changed. But the actual strip-mall space that Hass was occupying is now bigger. Hass has aquired the shop space next door. They've knocked down the dividing wall. This was the perfect move, in my opinion: It's so much bigger of an eatery, now!! For our UYE, Hass was able to set up several four-tops; a giant, long table so everyone could chat!! The management was awesome, too! The GM gentleman was great: hilarious, sarcastic, knowledgeable out the store's water source **hehe**!out orders where brought out pretty fast, considering the place was full with hurry patrons. Oh, and yes, the food was tasty (as always)! Great flavors. I tried their fish and shrimp tacos. The light batter was nice and warm. The ocean tastes did not taste like freezer - prefect. A personal favorite was the sauce lightly squeezed on top of both tacos."], ["Arvid Y.", "I visited Hass last week for an UYE organized by Gwen W. I live in the Arena District, so driving past the I-270 Outerbelt to get to Hass is quite the trek for me. Even after factoring in the long commute, I still left impressed . \u00a0Since moving to Columbus, I haven't had the chance to try many taco joints. However, I can safely say that the tacos at Hass are some of the best i've ever had. I haven't tried Los Guachos yet, but these ones are comparable to the awesome tacos I had at El Tuzo Taco (taco truck).A combination of great taste and fair pricing make these tacos great. Each taco runs about $2. They are good sized with plentiful toppings, but you will still need to order 3 to 4 tacos in order to be full. I tried the chorizo, al pastor, shrimp and fish tacos. My favorites were the al pastor and fish. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was well-seasoned. I particularly enjoyed the pineapple and avocado sauce in the al pastor. Despite all the toppings, the consumption of these tacos were surprisingly mess-free. \u00a0 \u00a0My other Yelp colleagues were a little less impressed with their Bronco Burrito. They thought it was \"missing something\" and they ended up drowning their burritos in hot sauce. I also sampled their mini quesadilla, whicc was just okay. My advice would be to stick with the tacos. Overall a very solid taco joint. $9 and change got me 4 tacos and a beer. The only negative point is their location and how far they are from my home."], ["Staci R.", "Excellent shrimp tacos. Who am I kidding everything I've had at Hass is delicious! Authentic and affordable."], ["Neil B.", "The tacos are really good, but the service and atmosphere is a little lacking."], ["Gus W.", "Why is this place not closer to me? Not remotely close for that matter. When my buddy said he was going to watch his nephew play hockey at Dublin at 10 in the morning, I jumped on that opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: go to Play It Again Sports and check out Hass, since they're in the same plaza. We're both huge fans of authentic Mexican fare, so I knew he'd want to try it.Wow, the tacos at this place are amazing, particularly the pastor tacos. The meat is cooked on the spit perfectly, and they give you a lot of it with a nice green sauce on top along with pineapple, onions, and cilantro. The red and green sauces on the table were delicious as well. I also got a pastor quesadilla, which was pretty good but incredibly small. I loved the taste of it, but I don't think I'd get it the next time. It was the same price as the tacos at $1.75, but as soon as you add meat to it, it bumped the price up to over $3 when it was literally the same exact ingredients as the tacos plus cheese but with less meat. They even use the same small corn tortillas to create it. You're not foolin' me! Lower the price or make the quesadilla bigger.Anywho, I'll forgive my minor gripe, because the meal tasted so good. This place needs to expand closer to downtown, or better yet, my street, so I don't have to make the 20 minute drive every time I want these awesome tacos."], ["Katye M.", "I've been here once and it is now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town! Location is a little out of the way and is tucked in a plaza, but it's worth checking out. They have a larger place than expected -- some \"bar\" tables and some short tables, with maybe about 20 tables in all. The employees were very nice. You order at the front and then they bring out your oder to your table."], ["Shuo F.", "After seeing many great reviews of this place, I had to come and try! I ordered four al pastor tacos and a Burrito Bronco. Both tasted amazingly! The taco is topped with pieces of pineapple which brought out the savory seasoning of the pork. The burrito is big and it's not so cheesy that it covers up the taste of the rest of the ingredients, like other places. The burrito is super rich and makes Chipotle burritos look like something ordered from Taco Bell. Also, I love that they grill the tortilla after everything is made, it only adds to the taste. \u00a0I think what I had was much more flavorful than Los Guacho's.The service was minimal, but everyone was very polite."], ["Ryan K.", "Ah Hass, I met you during a Yelp elite event and from there the fondness has grown. Here you'll find delicious Mexican food and at a price that your wallet will declare is 'nay but a scratch.' Since that fateful first visit I've been back on several occasions for either lunch or dinner. It's really hard to go wrong with their menu. The burritos are fantastic (the Hass one in particular is worth a try), the fish tacos are an obvious go to, and lastly another favorite of mine are the Al Pastor tacos. As you can see from some of the pictures posted here despite the reasonable price you get food that looks excellent, has a varied and delicious flavor profile, and the ability to mix and match a bunch of different items via their a la cart style ordering.The atmosphere at Hass is also pretty cool. It's clean but casual and they'll sometimes have a soccer match going on their big screen for you to enjoy. The staff is very courteous and all in all the place is a fantastic experience. I'd suggest giving this place a try as soon as you're able."], ["Tyler S.", "I love this place. It is a gem for the area that it is in which is a bit like retail/chain madness. If you go here, order tacos. Don't roll the dice on a burrito or on any other menu item, they are known for tacos, so order tacos. If you don't like tacos you are crazy and shouldn't come here anyway. The guacamole is expensive but delicious. The margarita's were pretty on point as well. The staff is nice and friendly and it has a very family centric vibe going on behind the counter. I go here once a month."], ["Naiying C.", "We tried the cactus taco and I thought cooked cactus would be mushy but it wasn't! it's worth trying if you are curious.Also had the burrito hass with pastor and I'm pretty sure this 6.99$ burrito weights 1 lb.! It's the heaviest burrito I've ever held. What I liked: the slight crunchy tortilla, yellow rice option and the avocado sauce that came with it. What I didn't like: toward the end of the burrito got more and more salty! It made me super thirsty at the end, too much salt. P.S- the interior is quite nice!"], ["Munch B.", "Awesome place. Nice food,margarita . Got to try burrito hass and taco verde(cactus with onions and potato.."], ["Rachael B.", "This place is great! \u00a0I pass this place a lot and finally tried it. Now I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. I'm happy to have 3 favorite places to eat at in this parking lot now.I like to order the tacos to go, expect some extra wait time because everything is fresh. \u00a0My husband & I were served nachos while we waited and they were awesome! It was a pleasant surprise but I don't mind waiting for good tacos. Nice menu selection that isn't overwhelming. Gordon Ramsey would be proud!"], ["Justin J.", "Absolutely delish. \u00a0Well presented and flavorful. \u00a0I will be back here at some point, but it is definitely top 5 in Columbus.I ordered to go which I picked up within 10 minutes. \u00a0Prepared quickly and still presented well.Fish and chicken tacos were the choice. \u00a0The guacamole salsa on top is very good as well. ."], ["Ram H.", "This place is very authentic and has excellent Tacos and Burritos. \u00a0The owner takes the time to explain the various foods and makes you feel at home. \u00a0It is very simple so don't go in expecting a fancy place, just great food. \u00a0It's no problem to bring in kids."], ["Michael N.", "We had tacos Al Pastor and the Burrito Pecheron. The tacos win. Hands down. Burrito was good but no match for the tacos! And loved the hot sauce in the mustard bottle. Milder but tasty!!"], ["Chris T.", "Great lunch spot for me in Dublin just off the freeway. Quick service, you only wait as long as it takes to cook your tacos! The burritos are really good too. They can be similar to size and construction as Chipotle, but have the extra grilled taste and crispiness (sp?) to the shell. I wish they had some sides or chips, but that just gives me an excuse to order an extra taco, which is fine by me."], ["Jennifer E.", "My husband and I just found this a couple weekends ago, and wow. We actually went back the next day so we could try more items on the menu.This place is very much like a taco truck and do not expect the normal Americanized Mexican food choices. \u00a0So far we have tried the majority of the Taco variations - the al pastor is by far the best, with the pollo a close second. I really enjoyed the fish taco - though we have yet to try to shrimp taco due to a newly discovered shellfish allergy. My least favorite is was the pulled pork - just not at the same level as the rest of the tacos. The taco verde (cactus and potatoes) was a really delicious vegetarian option. The quesadillas are fantastic as well. I personally wasn't too impressed by the Lorenza, but my husband thoroughly enjoyed it.Pretty much there's not much you can go wrong ordering. We have yet to try all of the menu choices, I think the Papa Caliente is the next on our list to try. I would have to say this is probably the best food I have had so far this year and have already started recommending it to all of my friends."], ["Matt V.", "Wow! The food here is so fresh, and so delicious. The tacos are fantastic. The salsa has great flavor and just enough heat. The burrito is huge, and delicious.The tacos are on the small side \u00a0- expect to eat at least 3-4 for an adult. Try the fish taco. You won't be disappointed.I'll be bringing friends here often."], ["Katherine B.", "Mmmmm. So good.I had a burrito logo with al pastor and pinto beans. It was a little heavy on the beans but I think that is just me....they are the first beans I've eaten in about three years. So probably most would find it perfect. My husband had Papa Caliente.....loved it.We will definitely go back....and pretty soon, too. Can't wait to bring my sons here next time they come home!"], ["Maureen O.", "cheaper than Los gachos. simular culinary gist as los gachos. I got the fish taco, shrimp and el pastor. garnished with radish and pineapple. it was good.the setting was subpar. there was food on the floor and the tables were not wiped clean. the lighting was overhead fluorescents which I'm pretty much always against if at all possible and were bleh and made it easy to see the dirt. we were there at the end of the day where they literally hosing down the stainless steel hood and grill. like, literally, with a garden hose. I'm sure this is typical protocol but I'd rather be in the dark about such procedures b/c I'm a squeamish wimp.best part was the name which is reminiscent of the college friends I went with- one who's nickname was hoss. food was fine, price was better but won't be back."], ["Dan B.", "The most authentic Mexican food I have had this side of the Mississippi River. Wait, which side of the Mississippi am I in . After 30 years in California it has been hard to find authentic Mexican food. They have it here. The tacos are the real deal and delicious. Service is very friendly and the prices are good. When back in this area, I'll be back. Mui sobrozo!!"], ["Holly C.", "First of all, the tacos here were delicious!! I like that for some of them, the tortilla is pan fried/grilled a little bit to give it a nice, crisp texture.I tried each of the tacos: carne asada (beef), al pastor (marinated pork with bits of pineapple), carnitas (pulled pork), pollo (chicken), fish, and shrimp. There is also a taco verde option which I assume is vegetarian, but we didn't get that.My favorites in order: \u00a0al pastor, carne asada, pollo, shrimp, fish, and carnitas. I probably wouldn't order the carnitas again because everything else was much more marinated and flavorful than the carnitas one, which I unfortunately ate last so it was a bit anti climatic. Everything else was so good though. The meats are tender and juicy. I didn't try anything else, but the horchata was awesome! It's a nice little family owned place, and the owner was so friendly when we walked in. They've been open for about a month now, and he didn't recognize us so he knew we were first timers. He chatted with us about the menu and recommended that we try the tacos first. Guys, it's service like that, that will keep your customers and patrons. I bet that everything else on the menu is great as well. I saw that they serve alcohol too, for those that want to enjoy a drink or two with dinner."], ["christin b.", "Just came in for some tacos before heading to work. This place is new and have been wanting to try it for awhile now! I got al pastor (pork), carne asada (steak), and a fish taco! They were all so good and filled with goodness! When you first sit they give you a lil bowl of beans with bacon. It's really tasty. My favorite taco was the al pastor! It had such a good flavor and it was topped off with a mango salsa!! Yummy!! My new fave! I most definitely will be here again!!"], ["Mailin Y.", "Awesome tacos. Carnitas and fish taco were a highlight. Great margarita. And Israel, the owner, was super friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back. Rivals anything in LA."], ["Russ F.", "Great Mexican food . . . fresh and flavorful . . . and fast service. \u00a0The downside is they have no air conditioning (or if they do, it hardly works). \u00a0Eating in sticky heat may be the ambiance of Mexico, but it takes your appetite away. \u00a0For take-away, however, I'd recommend this restaurant!"], ["Jason K.", "Went in for lunch to grab some tacos. I ended up trying both the carne asada and the carnitas taco, as well as a quesadilla. Things were tasty overall but this wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican in the area.

I highly recommend it!"], ["Paul F.", "Second trip and it was better yet. \u00a0The owner is just a peach of a guy and whether he remembered me or not, he sure acted like he did. \u00a0Wifh he was a little closer!"], ["Joel S.", "The food was fantastic but one of the guys who came around to see how everything was made a fat joke at my expense. :~( I didn't put him in a Camel Clutch and break his back like the Iron Sheik would have.
