It's something I have never had at other Indian restaurants and it's been my favorite choice both times I've come. You also can't go wrong with the saag paneer or the chicken tikka masala either. Both of those are pretty standard for Indian restaurants, but I really enjoyed the flavor here. One of the best things with the lunch buffet is that they bring you baskets of naan to go with your meal as well. I pretty much ate my weight in naan, which is not the worst thing. The service both times has been good and the place is very clean. Also, pro-tip: right now, if you check in on the Yelp app, they have a 15% off coupon.

While the look and feel of the restaurant is on par with the American restaurants, but the main purpose, which is the food, is pathetic, I must say. The cooked unhealthy oil, which I believe supposed to be thrown away, was poured very generously over the gravy, made the food completely unhealthy and everyone's tummy was inflated if not satiated. I'm not an opinionated person and do not have anything personal with this restaurant, but in order to ensure that a restaurant is keeping its standard well by not compromising in health and taste, I'm taking this time to post this review.

In the end the lady (I believe the owner) argued that tea was fresh though it was prepared at 5:00 PM (and we were having dinner at 8:30 PM). At a fine dining place you do not prepare tea and store in flask but prepare on request.2. The Veg Manchurian - the gravy was decent but it failed to penetrate the veg Manchurian balls. 3. The Dum Aloo - It was Idaho potato stuffed with a lot of stuffing and it has sweetish gravy. The person who prepared it had put in a lot of effort and could given the dish any name he wanted and it would have been good. But when you put it as Dum Aloo in the menu, the expectation of customer is that they will eat spicy Dum Aloo.4.

If I can pay $45, I can pay $50 as well.Anyways, I always give any restaurant 2 chances to impress me with their food.

The guys running the restaurant are friendly, kind, and genuinely care about your experience. We never wanted for anything; I constantly had water refills, and someone checking to make sure I loved my meal. It was a lot of attention, but it wasn't obnoxious--it was very sweet and thoughtful. One of the guys--I'm assuming an owner?--talked to me at length when I asked about where all the meat comes from. I had roasted chicken, which was the special that night, and it was a special type of hen he buys from a local farm. He then went on to tell me about where the goat is from, the lamb, etc. I could have geeked out on this stuff all night, but I don't think my friend was quite as into it as I was. #FFA4EverMy entree, the previously mentioned roasted chicken, was spectacular.

From the extra delicious cilantro chutney that came with the papadum to the extra entree we ordered because the first two were so delicious, we were very pleased. We thought it was because we were just hungry in the beginning and maybe that was why the free papadum was so good--but no! I think it's because they know how to taste the food. The lamb vindaloo was tender and and the exact spice level I wanted (medium). The bhindi (okra) masala was extra spiceful (not spicy). The palak paneer we ordered in addition had amazing, fresh tasting handmade paneer (cheese). Amazing. The onion salad was spicy and went well with all of the entrees--a little too much on its own. The Chenin blanc (from India, no less) was surprisingly tasty and went perfectly with the food. And finally, the service was fantastic. Our waiter was a sweetheart and though the owner (?) tried to sell me on french cut lamb chops, I took it as a sign of interest and pride rather than selling it too hard.

But on this day, I was expecting a little more than \"thank-you-Apna-Bazaar-for-being-here\" dishmaking. Columbus is no Devon Avenue in Chicago, with its adjacent storefronts of top-notch Indian cooking - but that doesn't mean you don't try - at ten bucks for the special and 2 naans, especially when there are 4 other places within five miles. My friend and I got the beef kofta curry, and another friend a chicken dish. Sure, the meals were savory and richly spiced, the brown hue dense with flavor. But the brown hue also glistened, and the dense spice had to be spooned from a thick veneer of oil. Interspersed from each other, like the humps of two Loch Ness monsters on a break-up avoiding one another, sat the koftas, and one spoon in, we discovered the ground beef was devoid of any taste, a very covert yet conspicuous denouncing of its very identity as a kofta (kofta is a spiced ground beef).Apna Bazaar prices its food from 7-9 dollars per dish, sans rice or bread, which you have to pay extra for. If that's the case, expectations run higher. The last two times I was here, even its meat biryani lacked the minimum amount of meat, the joint pieces instead accompanied by a chewy cartilage. I'm still holding out for the biryani's sake. I'm a big believer in that you shouldn't have to go to Chi-town to eat good meat biryani. Apna Bazaar's biryani has the hard parts down - the color, the flavor, the spice, the sheer skill of presentation. Now, if only it could take care of what's easy."], ["Sam R.", "I normally avoid this restaurant because I had bad experiences with its food in past. However, my craving for a Paki food made me forget about my bad experiences and I thought I could give them one last try. Being from Pakistan I know what an authentic Pakistani food taste like. This time I ordered chicken Karahi $8.99 and two Naans for $4 which is not a bargain price. I don't mind paying these prices if the food was worth it. The curry was greasy with three pieces of bony chicken thigh which has hardly any meat on them. They used the cheapest part of the chicken meat. The naans were better tasting than chicken but they have pieces of dirt in them and when you chew your naan, you chew pieces of dirt in them as well which sometime hurt your teeth. I don't know how they cook their naan in clay oven that collects dirt. I could hardly finish my half a naan and thew the rest of the food. I don't know how this place stays in business. I will not be coming back!"], ["Giovanna A.", "I really liked the food in this place. Unlike a lot of establishments they were not at all shy about giving out full spice to a non-Indian/Pakistani. I thought the food was fabulous, will be back for sure. A couple of things that would help is the ability to maybe order a lassi while waiting, which takes a bit, maybe being able to order an appetizer? All and all not too different from the food next door and while the service isn't the same, the pricing makes up for the difference very well.

My two friends (both white - this is applicable) both received their meals relatively promptly, within 5-6 minutes. I had ordered a kebab roll, and being ethnically Indian, but relatively white bread, I was explaining dishes and spices and whatnot to my friends.The guy who was working the till/taking orders kept giving me rather weird looks, and was really rude when I ordered my food, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Well, the minutes go by, and 25 minutes in, I'm certain that I see my food sitting on the counter (it had been there for a good 15+ minutes by that point) and ask him if it's ready. He said it'd be a few more minutes. Well, I ask the guy every five minutes thereafter if my food is ready, and 40 minutes in (I only stayed because I had already paid), he hands me the food that had been on the counter for a good 30+ minutes already.This is utterly unacceptable. These guys are extremely racist/culturist.Do not give them your business, they discriminate and give awful service based on one's cultural upbringing.

It's authentic, the folks are warm and friendly and the food is so good, it could rub shoulders with the best that New Delhi offers. A friend of mine took me there, swearing by their Biryani. Biryani is a richer, meatier version of a Pilaf or Pulao, enjoyed by everyone from the Middle East, South Asia, East Africa and even Latin America.The place is bare bones and most of the space is dedicated to run of the mill Indian/ Pakistani/ Turkish? grocery items. But behind the shelves is a brand new kitchen with a Tandoor. There are a couple of tables and it's best to order ahead if you want carry out. The proprietors hail from Pakistan and are welcoming hosts. The food speaks for itself. I tried the boti kabab, 4 chunks of marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor, the most authentic naan outside of Old-Delhi and mint chutney with raw thin slced onions, under 10$. I was bowled over. The menu held promises of Halim and Nihari, items that cannot be found in most of the North-Indian themed curry houses here in Columbus.

For the record, I would have been okay with a higher degree of heat, but not sure that my wife or daughter would enjoy it at that level.There also plenty of dishes I didn't get to try, so I definitely will have to return to sample the full range of offerings.Definitely worth visiting if you like Indian food and definitely worth a drive if you have the time."], ["Emmanual S.", "Been there for veg buffet dinner .

I ordered a salted lassi, which was quite salty and so thick it was almost like drinking sour cream. I used this drink to cut the heat of my dish, but I did not prefer it.For dinner, I ordered the lamb hyderabadi, spicy. It went well with the chili naan - quite spicy.

My favorite time to go is lunch because they all have a lunch buffet and it gives you a chance to try many different options. We decided to try Dakshin at lunch time on Friday. Dakshin has a ton of delicious options on their lunch buffet and even has a vegetarian table and a separate buffet with meat options. I liked it, but didn't love it for these reasons:- They didn't have any items made with rice flour. I'm gluten free and can usually get a few items that I can eat because they're made with rice flour.. Eg: Dosas or idli. Dakshin only has naan.- I live and breathe for mint chutney. Their version was a huge disappointment. I would consider it a crime to call it mint chutney actually. - Their yellow dal was way too soupy.But, I did really like their biriyani. They had a veg and non veg option and would say it was probably the best biriyani I've ever had. I would go back to Dakshin if they'd change their mint chutney recipe. Until then, You will find me at Udipi and Maanas!"], ["Gus W.", "The only reason I knew about this place was because the guys show up to our work parking lot in a van, slinging tikka masala out the backdoor. No joke. Not even a food truck, just a van with their name on the side. I don't know how they chose us on the complete other side of town, and I don't even know if it's legit, but I don't even care. Well, I had to look them up and find out where the actual restaurant was, and Wednesday I finally got to try it up near Polaris.As with Aab, they have a buffet setting, and the there really isn't any service minus them removing plates from your table. The guy that was there overseeing things basically pointed out a table for me, where they had a big water jug out, and I sat down and dove into the buffet. I'm sure you could probably get a soda or something else if you asked.Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the choices on the buffet. I had read reviews about it being small, but I thought they had a pretty good spread. They had the usual chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, chicken curry, as well as authentic biryani, which they were pretty adamant about advertising. They also offered plenty of vegetarian dishes, including an okra selection that was really damn spicy, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think the best thing I discovered, though, had to be the Gulab Jamoon. Oh man. These little dessert balls were essentially warm pancake balls except much lighter, and they were covered in a syrup that was flat out delicious. They straight up melted in your mouth. I went up three or four times for more, and the guy working there suggested mixing it with the rice pudding to get a cool/hot thing going, and it was the best suggestion I had all day. I actually ate so many I nearly made myself sick, because they are quite sweet.Apparently the dinner buffet is even larger, but I was fully content with everything they had out, so I can only imagine. Did I mention the lunch buffet is only $6.99? Hell of a deal. If I'm in the area craving Indian, I'll definitely be back.

There were no signs to seat yourself or wait for a server, so we came in and waited at the entrance, trying to figure out what to do, for several minutes, being completely ignored by the staff.We were on the verge of leaving when someone finally came and seemed to realize we were there to spend money at the restaurant, he looked at us, ran back to get someone else, finally took us to a table, asked us what we wanted to drink, and disappeared. A few minutes later someone finally brought us menus and then asked if we wanted the buffet. We said yes, and finally went up to try what they had.The food was pretty good, especially considering the price, but I noticed that the biryani had very little meat in it, and the various hotel pans and trays were slow to be refilled. Getting our check was another remarkably long wait, and if I was a less honest person, I suspect it would have been very easy to just stand up and walk out without anyone the wiser.If the staff put any effort at all into providing decent service, I'd probably be recommending them, but as it is I would strongly suggest you avoid them - there are plenty of other Indian places in the area, and even more lunch options nearby."], ["Anthonni C.", "Review for weekdays buffet, amazing flavors as they're not scared to spice their food up.

In addition, they keep their water pitchers in a corner, our first pitcher had a fruit fly in it. However, a chef came out at one point and was very welcoming, urging us to try the fresh bhatura. He was so friendly and was the only smile directed at us. Pros: Dinner Dosas, tasty chutneys, uncommon South Indian cuisine availableCons: service, lunch buffet, questionable cleanlinessOverall, I would probably not come back for the lunch buffet. Stick to ordering Dosas for dinner. If the service was better, I probably would have given them 3 stars."], ["Tim B.", "Consistently high quality food. 6/10 in service.

I met some friends here last Friday after work to celebrate a birthday. When we arrived, there was no wait for our party of 5. One thing I noticed right away is that the tables are more spread a part than the other location, which I appreciate(I always hate feeling on top of another table). The menu at this location is basically the same as the Grandview location, if not a little bigger. For starters, my boyfriend and I split the vegetable samosas. The dough was flaky and not greasy at all and the filling was flavorful. I always love the condiments that come with the samosas. You can tell they are fresh. For my main dish, I went with my favorite, Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan. The portion size was great for the price. The flavor was great and it was just the right amount of spice(I got a 3 out of 6 spicy, so it has a little kick). The garlic naan was soft and warm and the garlic wasn't overpowering. One thing I want to address is that not all dining experiences are meant to be rushed. A lot of the reviews I had read said that it took too long for the food to come out. I did not find that at all; it took about 25 minutes for 5 dishes to come out. I did not think that was unreasonable and it gave me more time to chat with my friends. I think we are so consumed today with \"We want it now Now NOW!\" and can't appreciate the time it takes to makes something homemade and enjoy a dining experience. I actually appreciated that.

It's located in a strip mall and when I drove up, let's just say I was a little leery. However, I was greeted by multiple people when I opened the door. The staff was friendly and attentive. The server noticed the SciFi book I was reading and we had a lively discussion about various authors. How often do I find someone as geeky as I am when it comes to science fiction?!

In my travels to various cities for my job, I always seek out Indian restaurants. This place is definitely in the top ten percent.

The goat curry was excellent. Just the perfect flavor profile. The sag was very good as well. The tandoori chicken was probably one of the best I've had. Admittedly I caught a fresh batch as it east bought out, but this tandoori had a subtle crispness to it, not just the crispy charred edges. I've only encountered it done this way a handful of times and it is always my favorite. Hot tea included in the buffet for $8.99 weekdays so it is an absolute great deal. All in all one a really great Indian restaurant. Again, this is a budge review, but typically, menu dining is only better so I an imagine this place would be fabulous off the menu.

With regard to the buffet, the food is always fresh, dishes are regularly alternated, and the price is only around $8.50 per person. That's about a dollar more than over at New India Restaurant.

While I won't discount anyone's personal experience, I will say I'm glad we looked past the low ratings and gave Tadka a fair chance, and I think you should, too. The buffet (we came on a Sunday for lunch) is HUGE! Never have I seen a buffet with so many options. Tons of meat and veggie options, and they were constantly bringing out fresh, hot food. I didn't check out what it was that they were making to order behind the buffet line, but I'm sure it was great too, as there was always a line for it. The dinner menu is seriously overwhelming. I love having options, but sometimes, less is more. I looked the menu over for quite a while before deciding on the chicken tikka masala, which is nothing new to me. I think if they were abit more selective about what they put on the menu, I may have been a bit more adventurous. But too many choices leaves me feeling lost and overwhelmed. The food was all spectacular. We started with veggie samosas- loved them. As I said, I had the chicken tikka masala, and it was everything I would expect. Tender chicken, beautifully flavored sauce (and plenty of it to soak up with the naan). My guy ordered the goat rogan josh, and he loved it. With every bite, there was a little sound of delight.

They brought the Tadka Murgh Tikka first, it was sizzling and looked delicious but they did not give us any rice. After we asked for the rice it took the waiter more than 5 minutes to bring out the rice. The Tikka was too salty to eat without the rice.

The hostess at the entrance wasn't very friendly, so I agree with what some of the other reviews have said.A common problem that I encounter at Indian restaurants in general is that they tend to have the slowest water refill. This can ruin the dining experience considering how spicy their dishes can be! Tadka was the first Indian restaurant that I've been to where they actually leave a pitcher of water at the table for you. This helps soooo much!We had their vegetarian starter platter (samosa, veggie pakora, and a few other things), the murgh (chicken) tikka masala, and lamb biryani. They were all delicious, and the volume was impressive. You probably get 30% more food here compared to Aab. We were also pleasantly surprised to get a complementary plate of papadams.

Maybe the best Indian food I've had in Columbus. The palak paneer actually tastes like spinach, not like canned or over-creamed frozen spinach. Layla's Kitchen sautees the paneer so that it's just a wee bit crispy, not all limp and sad.The Chicken Tikka Masala also tasted remarkably real: that chicken was a chicken breast in the very recent past, and the sauce had a deep, rich, vibrant tomato taste. Even the jasmine rice was thoughtfully prepared! I was too busy shoveling it in my mouth to see if that orange stuff in the rice was very thin rice-sized carrot shavings or something else like saffron. But whatever it was, it tasted great. The garlic naan was also yummy and fresh.(EDIT to add: I went back on 9/14, and this time, I added the biryani, veggie samosas, and ground beef curry to my order. Those were awesome too. The biryani portion was *enormous*, much bigger than the orders on other dishes. Maybe that's because it's got so mcuh rice in it, so instead of serving you separate portions of rice + your entree, which is how most of the menu gets served, the mega-sized biryani is actually rice + entree in one.)The only \"miss\" in my order was the ground Beef/Lamb Kebab. It was dry in texture, but the sauteed vegetables that came with it were yummy. I'm looking forward to branching out to the biryani, samosas, goat curry, etc. on future visits (yeah, you know it's good when you're already planning for next time.)Someone else here on Yelp seemed miffed about portion size, but I was fine with the portions. Many Indian restaurants in town serve $12-$14 portions, and it's not really fair to compare a $14 entree to Layla's $9 entree. The entree size at Layla's is little more on par with how much food you'd get at a fast-casual restaurant like Chipotle or Panera: a generous portion for one person but probably not enough to feed two people. My husband and I split the chicken tikka masala + palak paneer + kebab and a single order of garlic naan, and that was a huuuge meal for both of us. I was sorry-not-sorry when we had eaten all the Chicken Tikka Masala and still had ample sauce left over to pour on the rice. Extra sauce is a gravy feature, literally, given that we'd only bought $9 worth of chicken.The setting looks sort of like a fast-food restaurant, but it's a very tidy little place. Picture a counter with a classy-looking iPad + credit card swiper, a hot case of samosas, a big hopper of mango lassi, and an LED menu screen projecting the menu behind the cashier's head. There's enough seating for maybe 25-30 people in the whole place, so it's not huge.As others have mentioned, the owner is a super nice, youngish guy who gives great customer service.

I decided to go with the Chicken Tikka Masala because I had heard it before. I got a mango juice and Masala Chai tea as well and he told me if I wanted to sit he would bring it shortly. I sat down and he brought me a small plate with a crunchy bread like item on it. I tried it and it was very good. A few mins later he brought out my main course. The main course was so huge that it comes out on 3 plates/bowls. The actual Masala was in one, a bowl of rice in another, and a plate of naan. He brought out a separate plate to combine it and eat on. I tried it a couple ways and it was all delicious so I put it all on my plate and dug in. So good. It was just another gentleman and I in the dining area but the owner stayed around and told us about how he got his recipes from his mom and the difference that America is from home. I finished everything and wrapped up and told him how good the food was and headed out. It was nice dining experience with great food and service but I made it to work with 10 mins to spare on my hour lunch. Yu could totally do carryout and be back in 30. I suggest that if you have time that you get the Chai tea as a desert. It def had cinnamon in it and was so good to sit, relax, and sip your tea and you digest. A couple notes:I got all of this for 12.00Even though the owner is from another country his English is great. They open at 9 for breakfast and their breakfast menu has BBQ chicken Samosa as an item. Who doesn't want BBQ chicken for breakfast?Thus place may not look like a 5 star restaurant when you are flying by on Cleveland but it is a must stop."], ["Steven H.", "Really excellent indian food. Ordered it spicy and actually got spicy. Highly recommended!"], ["T C.", "having explored most Indian food places, on moving back to Columbus after being away in Texas for 4 years, it was a pure accident that my wife saw some online pointers to this restaurant. Cleveland Avenue is not a great place in C'Bus...yet, the food served in this tiny neat shack, is worth exploring. They have a drive thru and allows you to call ahead. It will be no exaggeration to insist that this is the best Indian food that i have had so far in Columbus. Their prices are also much lower than most other places. They also package the take orders real well. Today we were served by Kimberly, a very pleasant hostess who loves what she does and takes the time and effort to explain foods to new diners. i thought she did an awesome job. It is not so easy to explain Indian food to some guests who have never tried it, and more so a great challenge for someone unless they know well enough about the cuisine. I was tempted to overhear as she skilfully went about her job with great patience and conviction. I think this is a great piece in promoting Indian Cuisine! Great food...impeccable service!"], ["YellowTurtle A.", "I've eaten here a few times now and I can say with certainty that this is, by far, my favorite Indian restaurant in Columbus, OH. \u00a0In fact, this restaurant reminds me of a similar style restaurant in Arlington, VA (Ravi Kabob) -- people who've had Ravi Kabob know what I am talking about- simple menu, great food. \u00a0Layla's is much cleaner than Ravi however, with better (and friendlier) service. \u00a0Although small, the restaurant is attractive with tiled decorations, lots of windows and tables that don't wobble. \u00a0The menu is simple but the combination of quality and authenticity of the food is perfect. \u00a0Given the quality and quantity of the food, the price range is a bargain. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Below is a list of items I've tried at Layla's that I highly recommend. \u00a0My favorite is the chicken biryani. \u00a0I don't remember having better biryani, maybe because I forgot what it was like to go eat in those big cities, or maybe, because it is the best biryani I've ever tried. \u00a0You be the judge, but definitely try it. \u00a0It is authentic and made right. \u00a0Other dishes that I've tried:Tandoori chicken (I've only tried the boneless) - 5 out of 5Beef Kabobs - 4.5 out of 5Beef Samosas (pastry fried in oil) - 5 out of 5Chicken Biryani 6 out of 5Rice pudding \u00a04.5 out of 5"], ["Isabel S.", "Clean establishment. Cleveland Ave is kinda scary though! Staff is extremely nice and helpful"], ["Daric K.", "I have had curry goat all around Columbus and I have to say Layla's is the best i have had HANDS DOWN.

See Lee and he will get u together."], ["Francis P.", "Reasonably priced ,excellent tasting Authentic Indian cuisine. I will be coming back as often as possible. The surrounding Indian Restaurants better be warned, Layla's is here and will continue to be The Indian restaurant to go dine in or to carry out. So far I've had the chic korma, chic mahkni, goat korma, goat bhuna, vegetable samosa, tandoori chicken, garlic naan, beef sambusa and the Gulab Jamun for dessert and they were all excellent. Delicious!!!"], ["Rob L.", "Okay I LOVE Indian food, but always hated how there were no good places by my work for lunch. This place opened though and I didn't pay much attention given the area and sometimes Cleveland avenue pop up restaurants are questionable in cleanliness and quality. However I tried this place today and LOVED IT. This is probably tied with Aab as my favorite Indian in the city after 1 dish. I ordered the Chicken Makhni and said \"make it the spiciest\"; and they did not disappoint. I was sweating while eating it and it was amazing. Spicier than what pretty much any other Indian dish I order \"extra spicy\" is made. Portion size is enough for 2 meals for me personally and it's a good $2-5 cheaper than most Indian options. Also tried the Garlic Naan and found it extra garlic-y which I prefer. The inside is super clean and renovated and like a nice clean Panera/Chipotle looking interior (again not something you expect in this area.) Highly recommended"], ["Kimberly W.", "My friend moved in next to this place and after helping her paint she offered to buy lunch, neither one of us had ever had Indian food. We were going to simply go for subway when we on the way to the car spotted Layla's and took the opportunity to grab lunch there and try Indian food together. We were welcomed by the staff and were helped in trying to understand the menu as well as the flavor blends. Both me and my friend ordered the chicken tikka masala \u00a0and we loved it! Needless to say we've found a new favorite place to have lunch!"], ["Jodie L.", "Great food!! \u00a0Good price and Lee is super nice. \u00a0We took a nice walk there from our house. \u00a0We will be back for sure!"], ["Andrew A.", "I was in columbus for work and had a craving for something delicious!

Definitely try the wrap, the samosas are amazing, love the korma, garlic naan, and the chai is better and unlike anything you've ever had."], ["Jackie V.", "All my husband could say while eating: \"This is amazing!\" And I couldn't agree more. I was excited to see an Indian restaurant move into an empty restaurant building in our neighborhood. But now I am beyond excited to have such a delicious and friendly restaurant right around the corner. The food is the best Indian food we have had in Columbus, hands down. And the service was fantastic too!We were greeted right away by Lee, the friendly and energetic guy that the other reviewers referred to. We sat and waited in the small but clean dining area while he calmly dealt with an unruly customer who was trying to argue his way out of his bill. After the customer left, Lee apologized for the situation and the wait and offered to explain the menu to us. While we decided on our meals, he gave us a cup of masala chai tea - so delicious and addictive! It made me want it to be fall or winter, so I could warm up with many cups of this tea. I love chai, and this was the best I've had. We ordered the paneer tikka masala, aloo palak, mango juice to drink, and some naan to share, all for about $20. The paneer was clearly made in house, and the sauces were flavorful, and not oily or greasy. The spices were exactly right and made my taste buds dance. The portion sizes were perfect, quite a meal for the bargain price. My favorite part was the little fried onions that garnished the rice - so yummy! As fantastic as the food was, let's not forget about the wonderful service. Lee came and checked on on us a few times to make sure we had all we needed. He really goes above and beyond to make his customers feel comfortable and happy, and it is much appreciated. I just finished my dinner and am so full, but I'm already planning my next trip to Layla's Kitchen!"], ["Leah B.", "Great food with friendly & helpful service!We were immediately greeted by an energetic & kind young man. He was so patient & helpful answering our questions & explaining menu items. We went just after 3pm & their kitchen was closed but they still had plenty to choose from. He said the full menu was not available from 3pm-5pm. That was just fine because this led us to try the delicious Chicken Tikka Masala. It was amazing. The seasoned rice was flavorful & beautifully prepared. The Naan was fresh & delicious. The Tikka Masala was simply delectable. The sauce is velvety & rich with the chicken that is so tender. The portion size was generous. All three samosas were tasty & well seasoned. The green sauce for the samosas was amazing too.You must try the Chai Masala Tea - it was spicy, sweet, & delicious. \u00a0The spices are freshly ground every morning. I could drink that all day.We can't wait to try more menu items. Please do yourself a favor & try this cute little restaurant."], ["Kate T.", "Fantastic service and some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Got the chicken tikka masala along with naan. The chai tea was amazing and unique, too. Will definitely come back again!!"], ["Gina K.", "My husband and I had a rare night without the kids and decided to go out for dinner. We were in the mood for some Indian food but not in the mood for the high price tag of our usual restaurant. I came here to Yelp to read some reviews and this place was highly rated and not too far from home. This restaurant is simple and unassuming but spotlessly clean and tastefully and attractively remodeled. And the food: Wow! \u00a0This may become our go-to Indian spot. The food was excellent, the meal was inexpensive, the portions were generous, and the people working there were amazingly friendly and genuinely interested in making sure we were happy with our meal. If you like Indian food, you will love this place!"], ["Fred M.", "This restaurant is a waste of space. I ordered my dish \"very hot\" and it had no flavor at all. The good reviews on here for this restaurant are either fake or from people who don't know a thing about Indian food. Then again, people think that nasty Aladdin's is good Middle Eastern food, so who knows.The cuisine at Layla's is extremely bland. Besides my Paneer Tikki Masala being extremely mild when I asked for \"very hot\" it had no hint of spice and barely a taste. I also ordered a somosa which was just okay at best. Furthermore, for almost \u00a0$16.00 I barely got filled up. I really should have sent the order back but I doubt it would have come out right anyway as I believe the cook has no clue on how to make food from the Indian Subcontinent. If you like real Indian food look elsewhere. I'll never return to this establishment to eat psuedo-Indian cuisine."], ["Jamell D.", "Excellent customer service and great Indian and Somali dishes to choose from. I stop in at least once a week to get a chicken Kabab Roll and a Chai tea."], ["Dan S.", "I got food to go from here and it was amazing. \u00a0I ordered Chicken Tikka Massala, Chicken Biryani and the Garlic Naan. \u00a0The Sauce in the Tikka Massala was thick and rich with cream and flavor. \u00a0It was not quite as spicy as I had hoped for but was still very enjoyable, and the several large chucks of chicken were tender. \u00a0They do take requests on heat preference so next time I'll ask them to kick it up more. \u00a0Then there was the Biryani which was completely satisfying, both in heat level and flavor. \u00a0This is a rice dish packed with spice, and the chicken buried underneath is very good. \u00a0The gentleman who took my order was very friendly and answered any of my questions and seemed very patient and eager to share information about the dishes. \u00a0Regarding portion size, for me the 2 entrees with Garlic Naan was plenty of food for 2. \u00a0The people who were seated there and eating in the restaurant appeared to be very satisfied and I overheard several compliments directed toward the staff. I will be happy to return and try some more items."], ["Liz B.", "Today was my second time and last time ordering food from Layla's. I have explored various ethnic styles of food, and Indian food is my favorite, being that my family is west Indian, and I grew up eating a lot of Indian style foods. The food from Layla's is a bit over priced when compared to the other quality cuisine restaurants that are in the same area. The food portions are quite small, and the taste seems to be bland no matter what I have ordered from the menu. Today. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and another dish for my two kiddos. I found my chicken tikka masala to be more lonely on the chicken side. There was a bunch of sauce and a minute amount of chicken in the bowl. My little girl enjoyed her meal, I believe, but my son had a hard time with his food. An hour after eating his food, he threw up the food twice. I already was somewhat disappointed with the food, but my son's reaction to the meal sealed my choice. LAYLA'S KITCHEN is now off of the menu for my family. We are use to ordering Somali style food from a new restaurant in the same area. The chicken and rice from the Somali restaurant makes the chicken masala from Layla's seem so bland and impotent. My spouse said this the first time we ordered food from Layla's. I rejected the notion because I love Indian food and I wanted to give the new establishment a fair chance. This time, I think my spouse was right. Layla's will need to do better if they wish to avoid the same fate as the previous restaurant owner who once occupied that very same lot.

Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The chicken Korma I had was so flavorful. If you like spice make sure you ask for your dish spicy and if you don't like it spicy it doesn't come spicy."], ["Doug B.", "I need to say this before I get into reviewing Layla's Kitchen. Typically, I don't post reviews without going to a restaurant twice. The only exceptions are 1) The place just blows my socks off it's so good, or 2) The food tastes like the aforementioned socks. Been to Layla's twice, they should be glad the second experience wasn't the first.First time, with my usual dining companion, was good. Not great, but very good... easily 4-stars. We shared aloo palak (potatoes and spinach) and goat biryani. The naan was good, fresh, and the chai tea was very good. We dined at the restaurant, which was very clean and we were attended to by a very enthusiastic gentleman who was exceptionally attentive and did everything to ensure our visit was top notch. All in all, a very enjoyable and tasty dining experience.Now comes the second visit, again, with my usual companion. This time it was carry-out and there were two things that were the same as the first one. The gentleman behind the counter was awesome, as was the tea. The food was a huge disappointment, though. I got the chicken tikka masala and it would be better described as tikka masala broth w/chicken. It was like soup. I've never eaten this dish prepared the way they do it. First off, it was overly spiced but can't put my finger on it, maybe it was the paprika but it was just toooooo much and it was, at times, overpowering. The oddest part was the soupy broth. I say soupy broth because that's what it was. It should be a sauce that coats the chicken with some remaining portion to flavor the rice. (btw, their rice is very good) What I got was a container of paprika/cayenne soup with very little chicken drowning at the bottom of a carry-out container. I got a $5.99 meal for $8.99. Regardless of price, I am not a fan of their version of this classic dish.The other entree was goat curry. Let's just say I'm glad I ordered the chicken tikka masala. The goat curry wasn't good. I don't know what hard scrabble, weed infested patch of land was home to the geriatric billy goat who gave his life for this dish, but he shouldn't have been butchered for human consumption. Goat is different, I get that, but I've eaten goat many times and this goat tasted like an untended barnyard. Goats will and do eat anything they can get their mouths on, so it is important to know the source. This particular goat was not well sourced. It was grisly, fatty, and overall awful. If we had dined in, it would have been sent back. As if that wasn't enough, the rice pudding was sour. Sour. Not sure how rice pudding is sour and not really sure I want to know. One taste and into the trash it went.Honestly, it bothers me to write this review because I want to love this place. I'm gonna give them another chance, based on my first visit, but there's a very good chance I'll be dining alone the next time. Third times a charm, they say. I really hope so."], ["Bryan A.", "Looking for a good Indian restaurant with friendly staff and great food? \u00a0Interested in one such restaurant that also has amazing tea and quick pick up on \"To Go\" orders? \u00a0Looking not to spend a ton of money on good ethnic food just because it is good ethnic food? \u00a0Then Layla's is the place! \u00a0The food is well priced and delicious. \u00a0The menu is somewhat small, but in a good way. \u00a0The food they offer they do quite well, and it has only been open for about month. \u00a0The owner who happened to greet and serve us is perhaps the nicest person I have met in the restaurant business in some time, only adding to the experience. \u00a0Is is a big fancy restaurant decorated Bollywood style? \u00a0No, it isn't, but it doesn't have to be. \u00a0I will take a hole in the wall restaurant that delivers an amazing experience and great food...just like Layla's Kitchen."], ["Tina B.", "I drive by this place all the time as I live just 2 streets over and finally decided to stop in tonight and give it a try...I'M GLAD I DID!! I've never had Indian food before other than store bought naan (store bought is nothing compared to authentic, by the way). When I walked in, I was immediately greeted and welcomed by a young man at the counter, (the owner, I believe), when I told him that I was new to this type of food and asked what he recommended, he was very happy to explain what Chicken Tikka Masala is and suggested that.
