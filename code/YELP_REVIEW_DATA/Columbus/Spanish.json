Everyone's dish that I have tried was delicious and flavorful. It'd be hard to disappoint! I had the chicken and mushroom ravioli which was tasty, as well as the pistachio crusted chicken which had a bit of an orange chicken hint of a taste. I actually liked my boyfriend's sister's dish more which was some type of pasta dish...I forget, I'd have to find out. The wine was also great. I had the \"Honey, let's try something new\" flight., the third wine from Argentina was the best in my opinion.I think that the quality of the food is great for such a reasonable price. The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is how tiny and cramped it is in there. I'm a small girl but even I thought there was barely any room to walk. You have to be very careful not to accidentally touch someone or knock something down. Tables are pretty small also. I think parking would probably be difficult to find but we got lucky finding parking about a block away but it was such a nice night we didn't care.

I ordered a Martini, salad and a 6 inch pizza all from the happy hour menu. The food itself was pretty good. I thought the pizza was a little burnt, though. The Parmesan Peppercorn salad was awesome! My drink was perfect. My one big complaint was the portion sizes. The deals seem great at $4 a plate, but the portions are SO small. Luckily, I wanted to try more than one thing and ordered two items off the menu, so I was filled up. My boyfriend, however, was not happy with his size. I definitely want to try the regular menu though. The servers and owner were extremely nice. I would definitely stop in if you get the chance!"], ["Christina C.", "My new G' spot! Wait...What I mean is this is my new GRANDVIEW spot. Fooled ya.After my last dining experience here there's no denying this little gem of a restaurant is in my top ten.Vino had a standout Restaurant Week menu last week that beat out many of the others. I opted for the spinach salad (with sliced pear, goat cheese and pecans) to start. One of the tastiest, most satisfying salads I've had in months. The next course was the grilled beef tenderloin with shallot peppercorn sauce - I'm not positive if this is on their regular menu, but it should be. Besides being a tad oversalted (that's all in personal taste anyway) the accompanying grilled green beans and mashed potatoes made my tongue do backflips. I was elated. Although they were out of the advertised Heath bar cheesecake, the substitute Tiramisu was fluffy and flavorful. As per usual the wine list is fantastic as is the service. We were seated next to the door so our server brought over a space heater to make sure we all were comfortable. Nice touch.Perhaps the only thing working against Vino Vino is it's awkward and small space, but that's neither here nor there.

One of my favorite perks of this place is that they share a kitchen with Figlio (which as you can tell from my previous review) which I LOVE.The food on their own menu is decent but where Vino Vino soars is the wine selection, by the glass, bottle or flight there's plenty to choose from! I ordered the salmon as my main course which was good, a bit dry, but it had a nice sauce on it. The risotto it came with was also a bit crunchy but again not bad. This place gets packed and it is rather small so getting a table on a weekend at peak dinner hours can be tough. But if you get in early or late you'll sit right down. Once you get a table you'll get pretty friendly with your neighbor since you'll probably be almost rubbing elbows with them. But again, it's a quaint and charming place for a date.

Here are my thoughts.The service was fine, as good as can be expected since it was fairly busy. Our waters stayed full and we were attended to in a prompt and courteous manner. We each had a glass of wine, I had the Belle Glos Pinot Noir and she had the Chianti Classico. Both were good wines.My major issue and reason behind the two star review was the food. My girlfriend got the roasted salmon and seemed relatively happy with it.I should preface this by saying that I work in the restaurant industry, in a kitchen, so I have a habit of \"deconstructing\" meals when eating and evaluating them.I got the scallops and root veggie risotto. This entree was $18.00 and consisted of about a 1/2 cup of sauteed spinach along with risotto, probably about 3.5 cups worth. \u00a0 The risotto was mixed a sparse amount of squash and red peppers and came with three 1/2 ounce(ish) scallops. Without knowing for sure, we're probably talking about 400-500 calories worth of food. 500 calories for $18.00, this was a generous appetizer sized portion. The scallops, while tasty, were light and completely off base for an entree. The risotto was fine, but needed more cream, and definitely needed more root veggies. Since root veggies was in the name of the dish I was expecting at least a serving of root veggies. I think there were probably 2-4 tablespoons of veggies in this entree that lists root veggies in its name. Can a dude get, like, a parsnip or something? Dang. The flavor profile was fine, and the food was presented well, so I don't want to pin this on the cooks working that night. What we're probably looking at here is cost control gone crazy. I don't mind paying $18.00 for a good entree. I understand the effort and creative energy it takes to create and execute good food, but entree means entree and this entree needed substance. More scallops and definitely more veggies."], ["Allison S.", "Been meaning to try this place since I moved to Columbus a few months ago.

I always am a little nervous when it comes to house wines, but theirs was lovely, and $3 a glass, it really hit the spot. The friend I was dining with had the pistachio crusted chicken and I had the mushroom pizza with Gorgonzola and pruscuttio. Both were fabulous.

Seared ahi tuna flatbread, salads, fish tacos... I can have a light meal here for what it would cost to get a fast food combo! Wine and some mixed drink specials (some martinis) are $3 as well.

However, because many of the plates at Vino Vino are considered \"small plates,\" it's very easy to enjoy excellent fine food without an intimidating check (of course - none of us ever came for wine - I'm sure that could make a huge difference).It's been awhile since I've been, but I remember having a cheese plate, a plate with three small beef sandwiches (with several dipping sauces), an unbelievably good chocolate walnut brownie, a risotto, and the brie bruschetta. I was pleased with every plate.Unfortunately, the restaurant is very crowded - lots of small tables make a veritable maze in the dining room - and I recall that there has always been quite a wait time for food and service.

Tapas are spanish small plates, with things like quail and lamb and mushrooms and more substantial things that you can make into a real meal. I would not say that is true about the small plates here.I would say that the food is closer to an american/italian/mediterranean style. They have a handful of pastas and pizzas, and then some meat entrees. I had a blackened tuna pasta, which was seared and peppered rare tuna with spinach linguine and vegetables, in a puttanesca (caper/olive/tomato) sauce and feta cheese. it was delicious! very unique combination of flavors. my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin, which was perfectly cooked - presumably sous vid, given the beautiful even cooking. We shared a cheese plate, which while not adventurous, was tasty and generous. The prices are very reasonable given the high quality of the food.The service was fantastic. our waitress was attentive, friendly, and courteous without being pushy or annoying. she gave us time to choose out a bottle of wine. lowest priced bottle is $27, most are around 30-40, then there are some high-roller wines too. I like that it is a very diverse list of wines! and the descriptions are really helpful. The timing of the food coming out was great - as soon as we finished the cheese plate, our entrees came out to us. The crowd on New Years Eve was very, very young given the grown-up vibe of the restaurant. the average age was, 28 +/- 4 years. which was fine with me, but also kind of odd.

J and I were celebrating 6 months together, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to test other Yelpers' descriptions of Vino as a great romantic spot. The verdict after round two? I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit at 4 stars. Granted, our evening had a few 5-Star moments, but these were dragged down just a notch by a couple of others. For starters, when we walked in, the room was hopping, the bar packed, likely with happy hour hangers-on. We'd made a 7:00 reservation, but no one was there to greet us. This being our first time dining inside, I'm not sure how this is typically handled, but we ended up sitting at the last two seats at the bar and waiting for the bartender's attention to ask him about getting a table. Call me old fashioned, but I feel like taking the time to make a reservation indicates that I want a special experience and the best seating available. I should've been more specific when I called. There's a lovely back room with low tables where the atmosphere is a little more intimate. I expected that's where we'd be seated; instead, the bartender took as right across from the bar to a high bar table, sandwiched between two occupied tables. If I'd been here with friends, that'd be one thing. This would've been a fine spot for seeing and being seen and people watching and letting loose. So - lesson learned: Be specific about where you'd like to sit. Your experience will depend on largely on this. While the backroom was softly lit, the bar area (this struck me the moment we walked in) was very bright. The overhead track lighting was turned up too high (like they hadn't lowered it from the day setting), and I actually had to give in and ask our waiter to turn them down. (To his credit, he happily and quickly obliged, despite the fact that I felt like a snob for asking). Our server, in fact, was thoroughly attentive, especially considering we decided to try three flights with small plates interlaced. He also kept the water coming and made himself available without being overbearing. Having read the other Yelp reviews before I left, I decided to test some of their comments. The mushrooms everyone raves about? I love mushrooms and I REALLY love some polenta, and the dish was tasty. However, it was also a little butter-heavy and the polenta was not the best caliber I've ever tried, so while I liked this appetizer, I'm not sure I'd rave about it or even order it on our next visit. On the whole, the food was good but not write-home-about-it fare. As to the menu, the owners descriptions of both wines and food are clever, beautifully descriptive and frequently anecdotal. I loved this aspect of Vino's charm - keeps the place from feeling stuffy. I like a restaurant that doesn't take itself too seriously. Vino offers an ever-rotating selection of wine flights, crafted by the owner. We decided to forgo the bottle service, and try out all three of these. Turns out the final flight, \"Trying New Positions\" (and the priciest, go figure) was our favorite - one cab, one cab franc and a shiraz, all uniquely flavored, interesting selections. So - to recap: Do your best to indicate where you'd like to sit. Don't freak out when the mushrooms aren't \"to die for.\" Try a flight (or two or three) to discover new wines you dig, and rest assured you will at the very least have great service. (To top off a fine evening, our waiter ran after us to return the scarf I'd left on the back of my chair. The extra care was not lost on us). ~a"], ["Jaime M.", "I used to live in Grandview and went to Vino Vino all the time! I moved to Los Angeles and miss this fabulous restaurant.

They also have $3 personal pizzas and a handful of other appetizer selections such as soup and salad. I did not order food, but my companions ordered pizzas and enjoyed them. While we were disappointed that the happy hour only lasts from 5-6 (I had thought it was 4-7 from previous reviews), the specials were extremely reasonable and the waitress made sure to ask if we wanted anything from the happy hour menu right before time was up.

I can't overstate how satisfying the experience was. The staff is knowledgeable and diligent; the wine list is meticulous; the menu is elegant; and the food is perfect.I did say \"perfect.\" Being a former Chicagoan, I'm nothing if not a pastime food critic. From the moment my wife and I set foot on Vino Vino's patio, each satisfied moment led to another. For starters, I had the Corn and Crab Chowder, and my wife ordered the Toasted Goat Cheese. Both dishes were unrivaled in the world of appetizers. The Chowder was rather small; and I am a big guy. When it arrived, I was a bit concerned; but I savored each drop, and would recommend it to anyone. The Goat Cheese was ridiculous in all great ways imaginable.The wine selection, while not expansive, was clearly very calculated. I was quick to presume that each and every bottle in their cellar is there for a reason, which the owners could likely recount on command. My wife's St. Michelle Chardonnay was -- without question -- the best Chardonnay I've sipped in my life (and I generally dislike Chardonnay).For the entree, my wife ordered the Pistachio-crusted Chicken, and I had the Seafood Linguine Diablo. Both dishes were beautifully plated, substantial, and downright delicious. Despite being much larger in portion, I found myself intentionally savoring each bite of the spicy Linguine. My wife's chicken was tender, flavorful, and very unique.After such an unexpected and fulfilling experience, it felt a bit strange to \"just pay and leave.\" We felt initiated. Our server \"hoped to see us again soon,\" and we're pretty sure she will."], ["Megan M.", "This place has a great happy hour. $3 mini glasses of wine and baby martinis! $3-$4 small plates!

Though sometimes on a crowded night we haven't been sat at the most desirable table, we don't feel pushed aside or over-looked and the atmosphere is lively. We have gone early sometimes (happy hour from 5-6pm) and though it isn't nearly as full it is still warm and energetic.The absolute best part about Vino Vino is their Blackened Tuna Linguine. I swear this is the best pasta dish in Columbus.I can't even tell you how many times I have ordered this and never once regretted it. Every bite is exciting and perfect and I couldn't recommend it enough. You'll smack yourself.Another amazing dish is their Beef Tenderloin. Very simple dish really but their use of pink peppercorn is delightful. It is also very affordable ($15) if you're interested in a nice portion of meat and potatoes. I love also the crab cake entree salad. Its great to split.(I wasn't so impressed with the Pistachio chicken, less moist and flavorful than I was expecting.)My only true disappointment in Vino Vino is they never seem to \u00a0have specials. This, for me, takes some fun out of dining out. However, the restaurant has a handful of nice dishes you can fall in love with and rely on every time you crave it.Overall, I wouldn't skip Vino Vino if you're in Grandview."], ["Lindsay O.", "Excellent cozy Grandview spot. The wine flights are nice! I had the white then the medium red flight (white was \"eh\" red was \"yum\" and the supposedly 2oz pours were generous!) \u00a0We had the polenta and mushrooms, goat cheese appetizer, and hummus for our small plates (4 diners). They were all sooo good! For entrees, I had the carmelized onion pizza and hubs had the tenderloin. All prepared perfectly and even tastier than the menu suggested. Finally, the best part: dessert! The chocolate trio was ah.mah.gahd yummy. Small place but perfect for a date night or GNO (there were 2 bachelorette groups there). I can hardly wait to go back and try the \u00a0happy hour specials! It's the kind of place where I want to eventually try everything on the menu because I'm sure it's spectacular!"], ["Bill G.", "Our son picked Vino Vino for his pre wedding dinner with his family.

I have eaten here about a dozen times, so needless to say, I really like Vino Vino. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Grandview for several reasons. The first being the ambiance. The restaurant is narrow and deep and can accommodate small or large parties. It has that sort of warm atmosphere that can be festive or romantic, depending on where you sit. The bar is almost always crowded, yet the wait for a table (usually) isn't too bad. I'd still recommend reservations if you prefer to go straight to a table. Waiting isn't a bad thing at Vino Vino because it' a comfortable place, especially if you enjoy just hanging out and sipping a glass of wine. I come for the food, which is stellar! In fact, when interviewed recently by the Columbus Dispatch, I said Vino Vino's wild mushroom and polenta is my favorite appetizer in town- and I stand by that. I'd drive across the city for that starter, but thankfully, there's plenty more to be had! I've had practically every entree on the menu, my favorites being the tuna, seafood pasta and crab cake salad. My husband and his friends swear by the trio of tenderloin sandwiches, which are so popular they sometimes run out. Being a wine lover, I appreciate the research and care that goes into the selection of the wines. The wine is served by the glass, bottle or flight, which are 2 oz. sample tastes of three different wines. It's a nifty way to try new wines before committing to a whole glass. Vino Vino shares the kitchen (and the restrooms) with the owner's original restaurant, Figlio. Vino Vino patrons may order off the Figlio menu (which is quite different), but priority is given to those dining in the actual restaurant, so the wait may just be a bit longer. Quite frankly, there is no need to digress from the wonderful Vino Vino menu. Vino Vino is the sort of place you envision having a romantic meal and falling inlove... if not with your date, at least with the food!"], ["marissa f.", "we went here with friends and a toddler.

It was worth the risk trying this dish!Asparagus BruschettaWOW! The most perfect combination of asparagus, fontina cheese and a touch of prosciutto with a drizzle of balsalmic.

During the warm weather, the outdoor patio is a wonderful place to sit and waste a few hours.We love the happy hour and normally sit and order drinks and a few different tapas. Tonight, however, we came from 5-7pm for Tapas Tuesday, which was phenomenal.We ordered two cocktails, a Sidebar Sidecar and Sangria, both of which were incredible. The tapas came out at just the right pace. We enjoyed small bites of a mushroom salad, fried chicken wings, seafood medley, a fried mashed potato/knish with meat, and a ceviche/guacamole bite.

Went here last night and ate at the bar. \u00a0I think we might have had a more pleasant experience at a table as the bartenders were very busy and the gesticulating and sprinting about seemed like they were at war with their alcoholic creations. Anyway, the drink I got was quite good - black walnut old fashioned. Sweet and strong. We ordered four tapas: fried plantains, spicy potatoes, squid, and beef empanadas. The plantains never came out as there was a computer screw up, but the other dishes tasted great! The potatoes were my favorite as they were creamy and spicy. I would definitely come back here to try some entrees."], ["Anna H.", "I'm glad Gwen W. suggested meeting here for Tapas Tuesday because I really enjoyed it. \u00a0I had not been in this space since it was the Brownstone years ago. \u00a0I was a bit nervous about making the trip downtown from Westerville during rush hour, and about parking. \u00a0My drive was actually not too bad and I found a spot at a meter just down the street. \u00a0Gwen already had a table inside by the window and the place was not at all crowded by the time I arrived around 5:20. \u00a0I started with a Stella, which was the cheapest drink on the menu at $4. \u00a0I was brought a tall glass of cold water. \u00a0The servers started bringing out the small plates and I thought everything was very tasty. \u00a0After seeing other patrons getting pretty cocktails in champagne glasses, I wanted one too. \u00a0I chose the $12 Smoked Manhattan, and I loved it. \u00a0We were there until around 7:20 and had, I believe, 5 different tapas served to us. \u00a0They could have served more, and spaced them out more timely, but I can't really complain since they were free! \u00a0Since it is Chef's Choice, it would be fun to return because you don't know what to expect. \u00a0The service was good, and they kept our water glasses filled. \u00a0I would absolutely return for another Tapas Tuesday."], ["Gwen W.", "Anna H. and I made plans to meet for a chance to catch up at Sidebar. I had not been there before, so I was elated to hear they have free tapas every Tuesday (with the purchase of a drink) - one plus one = two!I've heard pretty awesome things about the tapas here, so I was totally surprised that there was only two other patrons seated. I walked in @ 4:50 pm, so I expected it to already be filling up. But, hey, I won't argue :) Lots of wood and tan tones. Nice layout. 15-16 seats at the bar. \u00a0All the drinks are made fresh, by hand. No added sweeteners. Respectable!The waiter told me how the free tapas thing works: all the small plates are Chef's choice; they bring out all the shabiggalo, and patrons eat it if it looks enticing. After this point, the evening went a tad south. The first tapa came out @ 5:20. The rest came out almost 30 minutes apart. One of the waiters said they were dealing with a party of 50 on the restaurant side, thus the kitchen was swamped. Funny, I saw four people leave the whole time we were there (two and a half hours!). And, when I went to the restroom before leaving @ 7:35, almost the entire restaurant side was empty. Hmm... The tapas? Decent. I really liked the green beans with Brie cheese crumbles and the tomato slices-mozzarella-balsamic reduction drizzle plates. The oyster paella didn't mesh with my tastebuds. Oh!!! And the size of these tapas? No bigger than 1/4 cup.

I'm strictly a beer drinker and they don't have an extensive list, but there are a couple beers that kept me from being disappointed. \u00a0I went with the CBC pale ale. \u00a0A liter of sangria was shared. \u00a0I tried a sip of it, and there was a cinnamon aftertaste which was different from my limited sangria experiences. \u00a0The craft cocktails were pricey at $10-11 each.The pricing was fair for the serving sizes and quality of the food. \u00a0It really gave us a chance to try many things. \u00a0The service was fantastic and the restaurant wasn't very busy. \u00a0The atmosphere was upscale, but relaxed at the same time. \u00a0I felt slightly overdressed in my button up shirt. \u00a0You could come in wearing shorts and still feel comfortable."], ["Natasha K.", "Sidebar is an experience within itself, especially on Tapas Tuesday. We came to Sidebar a few hours before our show started to sit, relax and take in the whole experience. Once you order a drink they then bring you around different tapas plates to try.

They rest were out of this world.The only thing I could slightly complain about was that we didn't really have 1 server, they kind of rotated around the bar. I didn't mind except there were a few times we looked around for awhile before we had to stop an employee to order food or another drink. Time flew by as we sipped exceptional drinks and ate an array \u00a0of amazing food. Before we knew it our show was starting in 10 minutes, we quickly grabbed someone to pay the bill and ran out.

The cocktails were fantastic and you get about 6-7 tapas total (they bring one out about every 15 minutes). I think they have different tapas every week, but these are the ones I had when I was there:- Quinoa salad with tomatoes and peppers- Seared tuna with spring veggies (delicious!!)- Mussels with spicy tomato-cilantro sauce (I was tempted to lick the sauce off the plate, it was so good)- Some kind of seafood casserole/gratin (my 2nd favorite)- Arroz con pollo (pretty average)- A flan-like dessert (very light and airy)Loved being able to try a bunch of different dishes just from buying a drink (if you're gonna get a drink anyway, might as well get some yummy free food).

Tucked away downtown is this low lit South American & Mediterranean cuisine that is truly a gem in the city. After reviewing the menu, I ordered the Beef Empanadas and the Brie Pizza. The Empanadas were delicious and surrounded by crisp flaky dough with just enough cheese. But the Brie Pizza is a show stopper. A combination of red wine poached pears, brie, candied walnuts, and caramelized onions was the most surprising yet perfect flavor I've had in years - a definite must try! After returning several times and receiving the same server (who gives quite the performance), I will say this is a great spot for anyone looking to try someone new in the city."], ["Josh D.", "Amazing food.

The pizza was outstanding as well, the crust was cooked to the perfect crispness and all the toppings were so fresh.I would have given 5 stars but our waitress was a tad subpar. We were her only table and she would dissappear, and always seemed a bit lost.

I ordered only one craft cocktail from the bar, but it was a winner. The bartender actually made a concoction per request. I wanted a bourbon drink with egg whites in it (sounds strange I know) and he delivered in spades. He ended up making this delicious drink called Angel's Share.

They are $10.25 apiece but you are definitely paying for the amount of alcohol they put in them. Wow. They make all of their own fruit mixers in house.

I had the Rio Bravo which is a tequila based bev with muddled strawberries, ginger, simple, club soda, lime, El Jimador. I am not much of a tequila drinker but you couldn't even taste it with the other ingredients which is a small miracle. My second drink was called Cuff Links with a grapefruit theme. Not my fav but still tasty and STRONG AS HELL. They even do artisan ice cubes. Their ice cubes are formed in long tubes so they fit in the glasses!!

Drinks are around $10, and they are worth every penny. Coming from a cheapskate like myself, that's saying something! All their drinks are pre-Prohibition style; meaning no artificial flavors and everything is fresh-squeezed and made in-house. Since there was a group of us, we got to sample each other's drinks, and there wasn't a dud in the bunch. I had the special of the night, which was called 'Bijoux'. A gin based drink with chartreuse and some sort of bitters, with an orange peel. It was strong and delicious. I also had the Black Walnut Old Fashioned, which packed a punch but left you with a smooth, sweet, nutty taste at the end. Throughout the two+ hours we received the following tapas delivered to our table:*Caprese Bruschetta*Mussels (with spicy tomato sauce)*Spicy potatoes*Lamb lollipop with mashed potato and steamed veg *Square of Be'Naye pizza (lamb, tomato, mozz)*Asparagus quiche (that crust, SO BUTTERY)The bruschetta was the least exciting of the group, but all were tasty and a nice little plate of food. That lamb lollipop/potato/veg combo was so good that I could see myself ordering an entree-sized portion regardless of price. It was a great way to taste a lot of the menu FOR FREE.

I ordered the shrimp pasta, which was great, and was able to save half of it to take home.

It's a unique mix of South American and Mediterranean cuisine. And the bar, led by Josh, is out of this world. Themed as a \"per-prohibition\" designer cocktail bar, the drink menu (and talent) is something you would expect in the Waldorf-Astoria! Everything is handmade down to all the syrups and bitters. The Moscow Mule is my favorite. Honestly, let Josh wow you with the history of cocktails and wine and he will blow you away!Ralph is the matradee and makes you feel like a million bucks when you walk in the door. Jennifer is the manager is not only the most professional restaurant owner I've met, but is a very warm and kind person. She's a sweetheart. The staff is top rate! One of the other things I should mention is the extensive wine list. Most restaurants in Columbus (you know who you are) rape customers on wine prices by tripling the retail price or more. Sidebar 122 prices their bottles of wine at just a little above retail. This is truly unbelievably generous and shows that the staff cares more about respect and quality above making a profit and robbing customers on wine. For a truly out-of-Columbus experience, come have dinner and drinks at Sidebar 122 where everything from the food to the drinks show hard work and attention to detail. Everything is handcrafted! The Pizza Del-Mare (with scallops, shrimp, goat cheese and asparagus) is one of my favorites.

Not only did I enjoy the jerky-style bacon placed out for barflys to snack on, but I just loved watching the bartender prepare the drinks.

Although cocktails are a bit pricey, I'm willing to pay more for the artistry that goes into crafting each drink.

That's what I mean about being excited to see this place grow and evolve: it seems self-aware about its potential. Kudos to the owners for letting the joint grow slowly with their clientele (\"in this economy...!\"). As others have mentioned, Sidebar is in a somewhat awkward downtown location, making it difficult to go other places on foot before or after. I agree to an extent-- but it's really not as far from the Ohio Theater and the Columbus Commons as you might think (espcially in nice weather). If you want some more \"efficient\" drinking, the Little Palace/Dirty Frank's combo isn't too far, neither is the Jury Room. Again, if Sidebar can stick it out in this location, I think the southern end of downtown is slowly becoming more happenin'. I look forward to going back again and again, and updating this review.

We had ordered tapas-sized empanadas, calamari, ceviche, quinoa & salmon. Definitely not bar food. I really can't tell if this is a kitchen built around a bar or a bar built around a kitchen.

The wines and the martini were good. After some drinks, we were seated at our table. We started with a side Caesar salad. We also ordered Fried Calamari & Shrimp as an appetizer. The side salad was not good. I'm not sure if they put to much dressing or if the salad was pre made and the lettuce got soggy. The lettuce seemed to be wet and limp. The calamari & shrimp were good. The calamari were in strips. It was served with cocktail sauce & remoulade sauce. We were also brought a bread basket. The bread was descent but the crackers that come in the basket were actually pretty good. For dinner I ordered the Lobster & Shrimp Risotto and my husband ordered the Amish Chicken. My risotto was really good. The lobster and shrimp were cooked well, and the entire dish was seasoned well. My husband said his chicken was descent. He said it wasn't completely as tender as he would have liked and it wasn't seasoned great. Overall it was just good, but not great. The presentation of both dishes were good and made you just want to dive in. After dinner we ordered dessert, we ordered the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. It also had cherries or cranberries, I can't remember. It was ok. I have had better bread puddings. I took about 2 bites and was done. It had to many cherries/cranberries for the size that it was. The bread pudding was small and it just had to many berries. I guess I'm trying to say the proportion of bread to berries wasn't balanced to me.

The potstickers were filled with chicken and served on top an Asian style slaw with a side of sweet chili sauce (my favorite - the calamari went well in it too!). My entree was the Tournedos of Beef. These are two 4oz filets with with buttermilk chive mashers on the side as well as a few -literally- asparagus. Crispy onion straws covered half of the dish. My guest got the Amish Chicken that had the same mashers with it plus tri-color carrots. My guest said it was the best chicken she had ever had in a restaurant. (It was the waitress' favorite too). For dessert we each ordered a sorbet out of a choice of 3 flavors. Each came with two scoops. Overall the meal was appropriately paced and the courses were served in the appropriate order. We did not feel rushed, but the kitchen service was certainly not slow. While the website says business casual dress code, there were definitely exceptions to the \"rule.\""], ["Donna O.", "Lindey's has been on the top of fine dining in Columbus for decades now, and they haven't lost their touch. Having had dinner at another fine-dining establishment on Friday night, and having not been to Lindey's for a shamefully long amount of time, I was excited to see if the comparison and my memories held up.Lindey's did themselves proud from start to finish. We sat at the bar to wait for my dad and his wife to arrive, and Frank took excellent care of us (and even wished my spouse happy birthday after overhearing our conversation). There was a snafu with our reservation, but it was resolved smoothly with an offer to sit on the patio. While the parentals headed back outside, the spouse and I (with our drinks) were personally escorted through the dining area to the patio, where we rejoined our party.Let's back up to the details, here. We got excellent service from the moment we walked in. Our bartender, even though we were clearly having one drink apiece, took care of us like we would be there all evening, and we were able to cash out within a minute or so when ready. Then, rather than allow us to wander and distract other diners, the host took 30 seconds to walk us confidently to the patio entrance and point out our party at a corner table.The patio is large and beautiful, with flowers, trees, and shrubs enclosing the area into a beautiful garden setting. Even though we were on the street side, it was quiet enough to speak at normal volume. The service staff were on point the entire night - drinks, water, bread, soup/salad, entrees - polite, unobtrusive, and quick to get us what we needed. Their sourdough and parmesan cracker breads are lovely. Our waiter was fun, and we discussed his power of recovering from bad tequila nights before he moved us into our dinner orders.I will say: I am PANTS at fine dining when it comes to ordering. Silverware, plates, glasses? No problem. Napkin placement, got that. But, putting an order together and pairing it to an appropriate drink? I'm still seven years old. My order? French onion soup, orecchiette with red sauce, spinach, goat cheese and pine nuts, paired with a glass of Riesling. HOT MESS.All of my choices tasted excellent, however - cooked perfectly and balanced for texture and flavor. Service, again, was on-point - we'd taken a couple of bites, and I looked up at the two-minute mark (the 2-3 minutes after entree service when a waiter should check in to be sure the first bites are right as to order, taste, temperature, etc.) just in time for our waiter to check in. Details.Of course, I made another faux-pas, because martini + bread + soup + Riesling + pasta = take-home box. Faux pas or no, I finished that leftover pasta a few minutes ago, and it was next-day awesome. I might order that on Skip the Dishes for a next-day lunch. Dang.As far as prices go, Lindey's is perfectly priced. There is an atmosphere of winning you over, they want your business, you as a repeat customer, and ideally as a regular. I'm not sure I could name many other restaurants on Lindey's level in Columbus where I've felt that kind of hospitality. (G. Michael's would be one other I can recall.) Very impressive."], ["Jenniver S.", "Great food, atmosphere and service. I started with a wedge salad and the dressing was amazing. I ordered the Grouper with my entree and it was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. The fish was cooked perfectly. It was definitely worth the drive."], ["Gwen W.", "I'd heard that this restaurant has a great Happy Hour, so I was very excited to meet my good friends for an enjoyable evening! I originally got us a table on the patio (wow, was a gorgeous space!), but we had to move inside, in order to get the HH prices. The inside decor is also elegant. White tablecloths. Flowers. Wood. Best part? I never felt out-of-place, or awkward.HALF off ALL drinks and their Bar menu?!! Our waiter, Kurt, was a pleasant man. He gave details were needed, and his personal picks when I asked. I was impressed with the many offerings on the bar menu. I ended up happily munching on two orders of their taco plate and two orders of their Potstickers plate. The pulled-pork tacos had a creamy salsaesque sauce drizzled that only aded to the protein. Very good and quite filling. The Potstickers were the star of my night. The meaty \u00a0taste. The sweet/sour dipping sauce didn't kill the dumpling. The dippers came with their homemade coleslaw, which was one of the two best coleslaws I've ever had enter my mouth - score!I don't recall the name of the drink I ordered, but it was basically a mix or fruits, vodka, and sheer indulgence - yep, it was that good!! I'm sure I could have downed four of those, if I wasn't driving ;) To top it off? $5. Sha-da-wing!I most assuredly will be back here to try more of their HH concoctions. Such a great deal, I definitely recommend this establishment!"], ["Marta S.", "Amazing food with excellent service. Tina Tataki, mussels and salmon was amazing.

The Wedge salad appetizer should be an entree. It's huge and healthy looking ;). The Gold Rush cocktail had the right level of sweet and tangy. The ambience was gorgeous. The neighborhood is adorable. Service was impeccable. And the best aspect - this was completely affordable!!! What?!? Surprises all around. Another Columbus hit!

A true professional would have admitted the \"reply all\" error and left it at that. I told him that simply offering the customer more crappy service and food via an \"incentive\" is not the key to retaining customers. \u00a0Heck, I didn't even expect a refund, just a true apology where the managing partner wasn't slapping his manager on the back and offering zero constructive criticism for a job horribly done.His reply back was that he was rescinding the \"incentive\" initially offered by the manager and that I was welcome to dine elsewhere. \u00a0And that's exactly what I'll do. \u00a0Take your \"incentive\" and shove it! If you like snooty service and average food, this place will rock your world."], ["Michael M.", "I came here the day after M during our celebration weekend looking for classy restaurants. This place was great, start to finish. Its a cute restaurant in beautiful German Village. Valet parking is free (+ tip). Reservations are easy on OpenTable. We were sat in the back basically in a private enclave (party of 7). Drinks were reasonably priced and good (Anyone that makes a drink with Angel's Envy gets a +1 from me). Staff was attentive throughout the meal. And the food was great. The bread (both standard white rolls and this thin crispy \"everything\" thing) were to die for. I know thats easy, but our table went through like three rounds. I had the scallops with pea and potato purees (see pictures). It was not only gorgeous but delicious. A few members of our party went with appetizers for their main meal. The thinking was they weren't hungry and it saved money, but the appetizers were huge. One member's mussels order was easily more food than anyone else's entree! And her side of brussel sprouts was shared amongst the table.I've also been in the summer and sat out on the patio. Worth the wait! Its a gorgeous setting.This place is romantic for a date or classy to impress your family. Its nice and somewhat expensive, but I think its worth and worth going for almost all occasions.For dessert, hit up Jeni's around the corner. Or cap off your meal with a craft cocktail from Curio a 1/4 a mile away."], ["Hillary L.", "I went in craving a steak and a glass of Bordeaux. \u00a0Lindey's did not disappoint. \u00a0Atmosphere is sophisticated but not stuffy.

Overall, great vibe, lovely interior and relaxed atmosphere. The parking is street and since this place is nestled in German village, expect the streets to be a bit tight. As for the service, the service is great multiple people will stop by your table and ask if they can help you with anything. As for the food, we came in a group so we ordered a wide variety of dishes. Everyone was happy and satisfied with their particular plates. We ordered the baked mac and cheese as an appetizer to share with one another, it came out in a sizzling little cup. Cheesy was gooey, it was delicious. I ordered the Ohio Amish chicken which was amazing. The chicken came out juicy, not dry at all. Crispy skin, cut nicely, meat was tender, I could go on forever when I think about it. The mashed potatoes was great with the chicken. The portion was huge, I left full after the meal. If you were on a date or celebrating something, this is a great place to check out!"], ["Erik C.", "This may be my favorite brunch spot in the whole city.

The bussers and other supplementary staff were completely on their game, quickly clearing dishes and refilling water as needed. We were never rushed when we wanted to sip our opening round of cocktails before ordering dinner or when we wanted dinner to digest for a bit before ordering dessert. It was simply the best restaurant service I have had in a while.The food and drinks themselves were also outstanding. I started with a Tennessee Highball, and my girlfriend had a Greyhound Boilermaker. Both were well proportioned and delicious. For dinner I had the rack of lamb and she had the tournedos of beef, of which I ended up quite jealous. The lamb was good yet not great, but her beef was outstanding. We shared solid creme brulee and some Irish coffee to finish it off.If you go when the weather is decent, I highly recommend sitting on their patio. There's a central fountain with cobblestone/brick all around, and it felt like a European cafe in the best way. The ambience out there rounded out what was already a superb experience."], ["Angie M.", "I went to lindey's for dinner. It was amazing we started off by setting on the patio it was so pretty outside. \u00a0We stated off by ordering the ceaser salad and the French onion soup. Both were excellent.

It was very well seasoned it come with not your typical frites they had parmesan cheese and something else I not sure of. They also brought us warm bread to are table.

Steaks cooked to request. I especially enjoyed the frizzed onions and mashed potato. The tacos were also flavorful but the piece de resistance were the crab cakes. Talk about lump crab meat crab cake! Hardly any fillers and just nice pieces of crab meat. It probably is the second best crab cake I ever had. Alas, the first place (in NY suburb) closed down when the owners retired so I guess that would bring this up to number one on the current standing. The lobster bisque, though good, wasn't over the top amazing. The bread and parmesan crusted pita-like chips were good to dip in the bisque. We then topped off with the post mortem since everyone raved about again. Nice moist brownie but all's said and done, still brownie a la mode!There were three of us and we shared everything so we got to taste everything which was great.The service was excellent as well as the ambiance. We chose to sit in the patio and it was beautiful.They have complimentary valet but does take a bit longer than one would think for such an establishment to give/get your car.Anyway, another fabulous food experience in Columbus. Want to come by for happy hour next time, if ever there is another time!!"], ["Chris G.", "Everything was delicious. \u00a0I ordered a homestyle Amish chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and vegetables. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0My wife ordered a filet which she said was also good and she specifically liked the mashed potatoes as well. \u00a0We also ordered several appetizers. \u00a0 The best appetizer was the wings. \u00a0They were fall off the bone good and like no other wings I have eaten. \u00a0I would also recommend the succotash, which we ordered as an appetizer. \u00a0The ambiance was nice and the restaurant was located in the classic German Village neighborhood. \u00a0Overall, this is a must go if visiting Columbus."], ["Jillian M.", "You wanna feel fancy for a night? Get here for happy hour. From 4:30 - 6:30 PM you will be surrounded by half price wine, beer, cocktails, and bar menu items! Their cocktails here are delicious, and normally between $9-11 a drink. I had a pear vodka and St. Germain martini that I could probably drink forever. They have a great selection of bar menu items, including a generously sized margarita flatbread pizza that was really tasty. The pot stickers were more like an eggroll than a dumpling, as they were in a fried wonton wrapper, but still really good. Also, let's talk about the venue. This place is very nice inside, with a lot of hardwood and a super stylish and clean bathroom! Have you seen the patio here?? It's beautiful, and even has an outdoor bar and a fountain! It filled up around 6pm, and got a bit loud, which was probably the only downside. Our servers and all of the staff that I encountered were very friendly and helpful, and didn't seem to mind that we were obviously a bunch of hooligans that were there for the happy hour prices. There were a lot of nicely dressed people in suits.Get here for happy hour and dine like a king for a pauper's price!"], ["Kelly D.", "Great food and fun atmosphere after a Buckeye football victory.

Happy hour is between 4:30 - 6:30 and that was plenty of time for us to destroy some apps and down some STRONG cocktails. I had the Jalape\u00f1o Pineapple High Ball which was only $4 on HH price followed by a glass of chardonnay. The high ball was amazing. Jalapeno infused tequila. All the flavors of the pineapple and tequila went together very well. Who knew?! They make some strong drinks in this bar which is great for the price. They have a huge wine selection and a decent beer selection although most of their beer is in bottles and not on draft. We all shared apps but I ordered the sliders which were delicious. Potstickers and flatbreads were solid too. Everything had a great flavor. There are only about 15 items on the bar menu but they have a good variety of food to try from tacos to potstickers to calamari. You have to sit at the bar area to get these prices but there's plenty of seating in the \"lounge\" area across from the bar. It got pretty busy after about an hour so get here as close to 4:30 as you can. I will definitely try to come back for happy hour and would love to try it for a regular meal too! They have a huge patio that looks like it would be perfect for a night out on the town."], ["GR G.", "Old school charm inside the dining room, great patio/garden area outside. \u00a0Dined in the open air for early dinner, just missing their happy hour which features 1/2 price drinks and apps. Started the meal with a tuna app and kale side salad. Best part of the app was the baked garnish. \u00a0The kale salad had a light dressing and the bacon lacked the crunch I like in my pork. For dinner, tried the grouper with a Cajun risotto cake. \u00a0Was good, but not great. The house libations sounded great on the menu, but the flavors were a little on the sweet side.Four stars for environment, four and a half stars if you catch happy hour, three and half without happy hour."], ["Nicholas C.", "This is a great date night restaurant. Classic cocktails, attentive and well-groomed staff, amazing food. The fresh bread and parmesan crackers are a wonderful starter. Any entree here seems to be carefully crafted, and the menu offers a great variety.

The service and food have been excellent both times. Most recently, I came for a celebratory dinner. I booked the reservation through OpenTable. Our party was seated immediately next to the windows facing the patio. I had a nice glass of Syrah. Other members of the party ordered classic cocktails. All of which were delicious. The gorgonzola crusted filet mignon with chive mashed potatoes and asparagus was phenomenal. Hands down the best filet mignon I've ever had. Better than Mastro's Beverly Hills or Ruth Chris. Will definitely order again and return soon."], ["Kaoru M.", "I've been wanting to dine at Lindey's for literally 2 or 3 years. But since I tend to be last minute with my dinner plans, I've never found an acceptable reservation opening on OpenTable for Lindey's. Fast forward to last week, when my wife asked to go to Lindey's for her birthday dinner on Saturday 11/8. I check on OpenTable on Thursday 11/6 and the available reservation times for a party of 2 were 4:45pm and 8pm. Hmmm. Well, she really wanted to go so we made the reservation for 4:45pm.Upon arrival, we were seated right away. I found the interior clean and minimalist. A good setting for a good, formal dinner. Looking at the menu, I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of dishes along with the relatively sensible pricing. I was expecting Cameron Mitchell style inflated prices with steaks all costing $40 and up, but this was not the case. $28 for Steak Frites or $33 for a rack of lamb is pretty reasonable in my opinion. $10 for a starter of beef carpacchio is also very reasonable. I ended up ordering the New Zealand rack of lamb with a caesar salad, and they were both quite excellent. Unfortunately, we did not have room left in our stomach for dessert.Overall, this was an excellent meal. Now I know why reservations are so hard to get for this restaurant. I will definitely be back... and maybe I'll try to make my reservation a week ahead of time next time."], ["Moses S.", "My wife and I came here last week for a celebratory dinner. We have also been here for brunch on a sunday mid morning.Overall impressions are very high, but if they could change one thing, it would be to install sound dampeners in the facility, maybe along the walls or ceiling? It's REALLY loud. sunday brunch we were seated in the back room and by the end of the meal, my vocal chords were was straining from trying to speak loudly. The dinner we were in the front room, which has the bar near it, so understandably it was loud, but still, install something so it's not ringing in my ears after my meal.OK, on to the meal. The staff is very professional and friendly, on point, and knew the specials and nuances of the menu. I enjoyed that. The food was prepared well and clearly had an artistic flair in the preparation and presentation. Arancini - nice flavor, but you're not getting a lot of fried cheesy gooeyness, just 4 small gumball sized yummyness. I enjoyed the sauce but was hoping for more cheese! (but that's just me, i love cheese)Wife go the kale salad as she wasn't hungry. Kale salad is kale salad. next.I go the spiced duck breast. I thought this was a very good dish, but a little heavy, I needed something acidic or fermented to cut through the rich flavors and heavy starches, but my only refuge was water. Outside of that lack of 'balance' it was a really good dish. The duck was cooked well, but was kind of difficult to cut. I'm not sure if it was poor meat, not cooked properly, or a dull knife, but at times, the duck wouldn't slice well. \u00a0However, the sausage was fantastic and potatoes are potatoes. Definitely would consider this place again, but it's a little too loud of my tastes."], ["Tash L.", "The first time I came here (for an intimate birthday dinner), I was underwhelmed. The second time I came here, during restaurant week, I was overwhelmed. Lindey's definitely redeemed itself in my books on this last outing. The restaurant week menu was fabulous, with great options to choose from. I went with the sever's suggestions and got the cold asparagus and crab soup and the shrimp and grits. My dinner companion got the duck wings and the cowboy filet - all scrumptious. But the absolute winner of the night was the s'more brownie sundae. Holy moly!!!! We were stuffed and still tore right through it. It was so good, it took all of our willpower not to lick the plate at the end! Before this experience, I wasn't looking forward to going back to Lindey's for dinner. I certainly am now!!"], ["Zack S.", "What an extremely classy and romantic place!My girlfriend and I began what was to be a magical evening in German Village at Lindey's for dinner. \u00a0Neither of us had ever been there before, but all of the online reviews I had read convinced me that we should try it.Before I get to the food, I should note that I had made a reservation for 4:00 pm on the 16th, and while doing so, the cheerful person I spoke with on the phone (apologies, I can't remember her name) asked if the reservation was for any special occasion. \u00a0I told her that I just needed it to be played out like it was a Valentine's Day surprise. \u00a0Upon arriving (after admiring that beautiful entrance on the corner of Beck and Mohawk), a hostess greeted us with a Happy Valentine's Day. \u00a0Every server we passed on the way to our table said the same, along with our waiter, who I believe was named Nathan. \u00a0I loved that they all did this!We were seated at a cozy two seater right next to a window. \u00a0While the weather wasn't great for driving, the snow falling outside was beautiful to look at. \u00a0Our waiter Nathan even came by and lit a candle for us at our table, and someone else (I believe it was a manager) dimmed the lights down in our area. \u00a0Onto the food! \u00a0That's what everyone wants to hear about, isn't it? \u00a0We started with the calamari and shrimp appetizer, and it was superb. \u00a0Light, not greasy, and perfectly cooked. \u00a0We especially loved the remoulade, but the cocktail sauce was great as well.I had the spiced duck, and ohhh my goodness was I impressed. \u00a0The duck breast itself was one of the most delicious things I've ever had, and it had the bonus of coming with foie gras sausage, which was tasty as well. \u00a0Even the braised cabbage was perfection; I would have loved just a plate full of that!My date had the \"everything\" crusted salmon, and she enjoyed it. \u00a0I tried a bite of it as well, and it was cooked perfectly with a flavorful crust. \u00a0Normally I would prefer just a glaze/sauce over salmon without a crust, but I wouldn't think twice about trying this again.Bonus points for never having to ask for a refill, every time where I was about to finish my drink, our server was right there with a fresh one for me. \u00a0Something small, but something greatly appreciated.We ended our meal with Key Lime Pie for me, and Bananas Foster for her. \u00a0The pie was delicious, though I have to admit I got jealous after sneaking a taste of the Bananas Foster. \u00a0Even though my date was pretty much stuffed, she couldn't help but eat all of the Foster; that's how incredible it was.Sorry for the rambling, but we honestly loved this place that much. \u00a0I was rather shocked that the price wasn't higher for the quality/quantity of food we received, not to mention the ambiance and excellent service. \u00a0We plan on making this a regular visit!3/1/15 Update: \u00a0Lindey's was nice enough to send me a copy of their menu in the mail for a shadowbox thing I'm planning on giving my fiance. \u00a0I'd give another star if I could, that was amazing of them!"], ["Christine L.", "I've been out of Columbus for 12 years and just returned. \u00a0This place is still the bomb! \u00a0I usually don't eat meat, but got the beef torneados (sp?) with b\u00e9arnaise sauce. \u00a0SOOO good! \u00a0Quality and service haven't changed a bit...still top notch!"], ["Zeeshan S.", "Swanky! Probably the best word I could come up with to describe this fine dining establishment. After being an idiot for about 15 minutes trying to find a parking spot which didn't exist on the brick paved roads of German Village I finally realized that Lindeys offers complimentary valet. So after having my hoopty parked, we finally went in and enjoyed ourselves here. They have a good list of cocktails and their happy hour is supposedly off the chain, so I will definitely have to come back to check that out. We ordered the fish tacos and the Amish Gerber Chicken. The tacos were great, fish was excellent and they were dressed perfectly. The highlight was definitely the chicken though, this dish was phenomenal.

They are tucked away on Pearl Street (more like alley) in downtown Columbus close to where the biweekly Pearl Market is hosted.I don't have much experience with Latin food, so I don't really have any basis for comparison. Based on pictures and previous reviews, I ordered the Tilapia Latina. I wanted a \"lighter\" lunch and thought that fish would be a good idea. Described as \"Fish Latino Style\", I was sold. A generous portion of baked Tilapia came out with rice, a hefty serving of black beans, a sliced avocado & tomato salad and two mini-arepas (arepitas). It also came with a side of their famous spicy cilantro sauce. All this for $9.95.The dish exceeded my expectations and was exactly what I was looking for. The fish was moist and flavorful. Clean tasting and not overseasoned or salty. The avocados added freshness and the arepitas added crispness to the dish. The cilantro sauce was the icing on the cake and just pulled everything together. I wish they they bottled and sold it to the public. $9.95 is an amazing value for a fish dish, especially with all the sides. Needless to say, I was full but not self-loathing. It was a delicious and seemingly nutritious meal. Some plantains would have added a nice sweet touch, but i'll save that for next time.One of the best lunches i've had since moving to Columbus. I wish the downtown El Arepazo was open for dinner. I guess that means i'll just have to visit their Gahanna and German Village locations."], ["Angela H.", "El Arepazo is hidden back on Pearl Alley, but it's surprising large inside. If you can take some time for a sit down lunch during the workday, this place is definitely worth it. I highly recommend you do NOT get their food to go, it really does not compare to eating the food right after its cooked. That said, I had to get my Carne Asada ($10) to go and that was such a mistake. The marinated skirt steak was really flavorful but really tough from being slightly overcooked. It's also impossible to eat with the plastic knife and fork you get when getting it to go. The fried egg that came on top was good. Not a fan of their corn fritters or salad. The salad is just Shredded lettuce.. However their Cilantro sauce makes up for it all. You can dump that sauce on everything and it is instant awesome."], ["Ms. B.", "This is going to be a new go-to for me when I am working downtown. The fish tacos are very fresh and are just delish. I'm always searching for a good fish taco and this is tops in Columbus so far. The cilantro sauce is fantastic. The service is very fast, despite the line being out the door during lunchtime. On my 2nd visit I got the Tilapia Latina and it was good as well. Fish was fresh and you could tell the ingredients were as well."], ["Andy N.", "FIVE STARS FOR SURE! OMG the best Latin food I've ever had!No wonder South America is dominating the World Cup. They deserve it just with its amazing tastes.My friends told me that Columbus was a foodie city. At first glance, I didn't think they would consider this Latin Grill to be one of its staples. If it isn't already on a list, they better start putting it on there, because this is probably the best meal I have had in Ohio!What makes it so good?? Well, let's talk about the flavors and meat that came with my Grande Pandeja Paisa ($13). You get an enormous platter of food, with chorizo, delicious steak, mind blowing \u00a0fried pork belly, plantains, a fried egg, a couple of arepita to munch on, and the usual rice, beans and salad.Everything on that plate was AMAZING. The pork belly was so juicy and the skin reminded me of Cantonese and Filipino roasted pig. Hell yes!! The steak and plantains were my second favorite additions to this dish. The meat was grilled to perfection and the sides gave such a boosted compliment.Their secret though? Be sure to ask for the CILANTRO SAUCE.That sauce was epic beyond belief. I believe they also bottle it up and sell it, and if I had more time to kick, I would totally consider. It was incredible and really fired up each bite I took of my meal.It had been a while since I've genuinely felt such heart for a meal. I'm so glad that my friends took me here because this has risen to the top of my list for must haves in Columbus dining. While it gets busy, it is worth the wait.

Everything was soo good, except for the steak. It was a large piece of flank steak but it was soooo chewy. My jaw was getting tired. The arepa and plaintains were bomb diggity.

I was torn between a few options, but went with this because there is basically no ethnic food in my town. It was a fantastic decision!The restaurant is tiny and busy. Tucked off the main street, there were a ton of people waiting for takeout orders on the porch and the line snaked into a back hallway. The staff were working super quickly and efficiently even though you could tell they were just racing to keep up!I had the Venezuelan platter, which was a great way to sample lots of flavors. It came with shrewd beef, beans (standard is black beans but they subbed pinto beans for me), rice, fried plantains, and arepas. Everything was phenomenal. They serve everything with a creamy cilantro sauce that I basically wanted to pour in my mouth. The portions were crazy generous, especially for the price. I left happy and full and disappointed that I had a flight to catch, because I would have come back the next day!

It's worth the trip up the brick stairway and through the brilliant yellow hall to get a bite of Venezuelan food. I'm a sucker for tilapia, and plantains are a must. Arepas in any form - cornmeal patties formed and fried to make bases for meats or salads, or sliced to make muffin-like sandwiches - make me melt. The patacon is superb. I usually hedge my bets by getting one mild sauce and one hot, as I rarely know how spicy the cilantro is going to run. Oh, and if you're wanting comfort food, pick up an empanada - it's like a monster deep-fried hot pocket made of cornmeal surrounding either shredded chicken, shredded beef, cheese, or beans. \u00a0I'd advise getting a blackberry juice if they have it - they make it on site. \u00a0Yay for locally-made, diversely-sourced, inexpensive food!

The tilapia patacon could be anyone's last meal- it's a beautiful combination of savory and sweet and a generous portion of food, yet somehow still feels light. I was lucky to enjoy a ceviche salad. Even as a take-out dish, it held up. Be sure to get it spicy! The folks here, for the most part, are wonderful. The service is speedy (watch out for the lunchtime rush) and the space is simple. My next visit to town will include this as a first stop."], ["Hannah B.", "The downtown location is probably my favorite lunch spot in all of Columbus.

I had the spicey and mild version and preferred spicy.I'm assuming they make it with cilantro and cream, I didn't notice much else and can't stand cream so this was a bit heavy and simply too creamy of a salad for me.Lesson learned, I like my Cilantro fresh and piled on not whipped with cream.The big mexican no different from your average burrito, not too huge, the man hates pintos so I had to pick those out and alot of rice and other \"fillers\" and lettuce which was strange.My salad had pintos while I would have preferred black beans and after checking the menu again it says you can chose and while we weren't asked they got both wrong, my pintos too mushy and black beans the man simply doesn't enjoy.A descent lunch, one doesn't really want to walk and have to continue working stuffed but for us $20 for a burrito and a salad we'll go elsewhere from now on."], ["Lori S.", "I met a friend here for lunch one day and it was great. \u00a0Tucked away in an alley, it has the feeling of a treasure you've discovered. \u00a0Small and casual, you place your order at the counter and it's brought to you. \u00a0I had the fish tacos, which were delicious. \u00a0I'm giving it four stars because I try to reserve my 5 star ratings for WOW restaurants, but after a few more meals, this place might well get an upgrade!"], ["Emma L.", "OMG.

Like others have mentioned, you order at the counter. It's a small place and clearly meant for the downtown lunch crowd. Luckily we missed the rush (it was 2:15) and there was no line. I ordered the Shredded Beef Patacon, he went with a giant Chicken Burrito. Our food came out in mere minutes. Like, 4 - maybe.Not exaggerating, my Patacon was the best thing I've eaten in a long time. The sweetness of the plantain mixed with the saltiness of the beef, fresh crunchy lettuce, creamy avocado, tangy banana peppers - it all just worked. I had my hesitations toward their famous Cilantro Cream sauce (I'm not a huge cilantro lover). Well, ho-ly shit this stuff was good. In general I could not stop eating, which was making me feel so good and so bad at the same time. Bf said his burrito was good, but he was eyeing my plate pretty hardcore. He said the shredded beef was definitely a better meat choice than his chicken was.Everything is priced around $10 or under - an amazing deal for what you're getting.

Blame it on laziness and on the many other places I can go to that involve less traffic and better parking. So whenever I do get downtown, everything looks darling and inviting. Narrow blocks with varied architecture like Gay St and the itty bitty alleys like Pearl St especially.And so stepping onto Pearl's stone roadway from Gay and seeing El Arepazo's wooden storefront is a reminder of how much more worldly Columbus can be than the northeast strip malls.

Once she actually started eating, there were no more complaints.It's more than nice to get a dish with several types of food on it and for all the little bits to go together beautifully.

We shared the chocolate cake with the banana foster ice cream. Very nice. the ice cream was very good. The cake was a chocolate lava whic is always nice. The decor in the restaurant is exquisite. Very lush. The food was excellent. For what we paid, I thought that the service could have been more personal. We really didn't feel like we were appreciated. Not sure we will go back which is too bad."], ["Amy F.", "I'm a sucker for good Mexican food... and Nada had me at Hola.I've eaten here three times now and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my meal. My favorites: - The Salsa Tasting Trio: The chips are light, flakey and unlike any chips I've ever had. The salsas = amazing! - The grilled salmon tacos- The carnitas tacos- The pastor tacos- All of their margaritasI'm pretty sure that once I make my way through the rest of the menu, the entire menu will be listed as my favorites. Everything is fresh and flavorful. The service is always great as well! Today, we stopped in for lunch and Griffin was our server. My friend has an allergy to onions & peppers that made it hard for her to order from the menu. Griffin had the chef prepare a special batch of guacamole for us that had no onions or peppers. It was delish! He also helped her to create an order for tacos that weren't on the menu so that she could enjoy the Nada flavors without any worry of an allergic reaction. We will definitely be requesting Griffin to be our server when we visit Nada again. He was the sweetest !The Atmosphere is funky and fun, but the bathrooms are probably my favorite of any restaurant. My next visit will be for brunch after seeing the pics of the pork belly & fried egg taco!"], ["Carol N.", "Came with my husband and a friend for a late lunch after my husband had a good first visit and after reading all the positive reviews. We were not disappointed and this may soon become one of my favorite restaurants. The place wasn't busy for lunch on a Saturday when OSU football was away and the Jackets didn't play until later so we were immediately seated. The hostess was more than willing to accommodate my request for a booth to place my daughter's car seat, and offered a sling but I declined. Service was quick and attentive, taking time to describe the ingredients and offerings. Each of us ordered 2 tacos and loved all the flavors. I had the pastor (perfectly spiced and delicious) and arrachara (my favorite; sirloin cooked perfectly with fresh avocado and spicy salsa), husband and friend had the barbacoa. We split the 3-salsa sampler and had to get another basket of chips, they're so good! I also had the tequila mule which was excellent. Had to wait a little longer than normal (for it being completely dead) to get our bill but we will definitely be back!"], ["Anneke M.", "We hit this place up after a Clippers game, and had a great experience. \u00a0 Our server was super pleasant, and wasn't afraid to show his personality beyond the standard politeness of a good server, which I always appreciate. \u00a0Margaritas and chips and salsa were great, and our friends had a blueberry cocktail whose name escapes me, but was also delicious. \u00a0 I had the steak tacos, and my dining partners had salmon and chicken, which they also raved about. \u00a0The fact that it's a *little* pricier than I'd like given the fare is the only thing keeping this place from getting five stars. That being said, it is in Arena, so everything is going to be priced a little higher than my normal stomping grounds in Clintonville."], ["Gus W.", "Watch out, Bakersfield, Nada's here and contending for the top trendy, upscale Mexican in town. Actually, forget Mexican, this place is just snazzy in general. We were there on Saturday for lunch before most of the customers started filing in, so we got to get a good look at all the interior and funky decor. The girlfriend and I loved it.Our server, and I forget her name, was super helpful and enthusiastic in going over the menu and making recommendations. She was a bit slow at times with the refills, especially since it wasn't busy at all, but I can forgive her for that, because the food was incredible.I decided to leave the pastor tacos for the girlfriend and went with the bacon and egg (pork belly) tacos. In the meantime, we got the guacamole, and it was delicious. My girlfriend liked it more than Bakersfield's, but I'd say they're about on par with each other. However, the homemade chips may have a slight edge here. They were awesome, and I like the fact that the guacamole actually comes with salsa as well.Our food came out pretty quick, and I was not expecting an over-easy egg on top of my pork belly tacos, but I like where their heads at. As soon as I folded it up, the yolk spread out all over the pork belly, combining with the pickled peppers and onions and diablo salsa, forming an incredible taste sensation. The habanero salsa on the table was combined with carrots to form a bright orange color, and it was fantastic on the tacos, giving them a huge kick. My girlfriend now wants to make it at home, because she loved it so much. She was also a huge fan of her pastor tacos.Along with the tacos, we split an order of Mexican mac 'n cheese, and I'm a huge fan of anything with roasted poblano and jalapenos, so that was a winner for me. I thought the two tacos wouldn't be enough food, but I was pretty full by the time I started eating mac 'n cheese and really had to muscle it down.The pricing here is my only gripe. You're going to pay more than you would at Bakersfield, and you're quite far from the trendier area of the Short North. However, I feel the tacos at Nada are slightly bigger and edge out what I had at Bakersfield but only slightly. I'm not sure how busy this place actually gets, but I doubt you'd have to wait nearly as long as you do at Bakersfield. My girlfriend officially loves this spot more, so I'm sure we'll be back, and that's not a problem here, since I thoroughly enjoyed the meal."], ["Breanna B.", "A nicer take on Mexican fare - Nada fancies it up. Their guacamole is hella good. Seriously, eat it with the jicama. It's the perfect fresh crunch to go along with the guac. Always order the double ($12).A margarita is a requirement, I kept my order basic with the a classic 'rita, salt on the rim. It comes in a high ball glass and one lasted me through dinner.Baja battered fish tacos were my meal of choice. $15 gets you 3 hearty tacos with corn tortillas (no sides) but I was full to the max after that meal. Loved that they paired it with some guacamole. I haven't had that with fish tacos in the past and it's a good complement to the overall flavor.The decor is all intentional with little surprises tucked inside the seemingly elegant wallpaper and fabrics. It's like an adult version of the game, \"I spy...\". Plus, their secret party room is unreal. I'd book that for a birthday party or bachelorette in a heartbeat."], ["Douglas G.", "Went to Nada today because my lady is seriously obsessed with tacos, and it was some seriously good mexican! We went for brunch and it was unique/delicious.I ordered the eggs benedicto, with crab + avocado holindase sauce and it was teriffic and very fresh. I did not taste as much crab as i was hoping but that was perfectly fine. My lady got the egg and pork belly tacos, and she was the winner. They were some of not only the best breakfast tacos but tacos ive ever had in general! So good.The portions dont look that large when youre served but thats deceiving, i was very full and satisfied when we left. We also got the guacamole to start, and it was as good as id expect from a restaurant like this.Its a pretty nice environment, not your run of the mill mexican restaurant but a little more up-scale and i enjoyed it! A good change of pace. But be careful... They have pretty fair prices but with a couple drinks and sides we racked up a pretty nice bill in a pretty quick time!"], ["Donna O.", "Nada es muy bueno, and a great place for whatever you're looking for in an upscale setting. Dark wood, low lighting, backlit bar separated from the main dining area, semi-open kitchen, tequila on tap. Both the setting and clientele are, as fellow diner Lori put it, \"very nouveau-Short North.\" (I have another term for this, but she is much better at polite wit than I am. Ahem.)Anyway. We made a reservation for 8pm and were seated quickly by a rotating staff of hosts. Our server, Molly, was friendly and answered our questions and made suggestions for combinations. The tacos come in threes, and they are mix and match - the menu is a little confusing, as prices are listed for three-of-the-same rather than a la carte. There are also non-taco options.But, back up to the appetizers. We got the salsa trio and of course, we ate all the chips because no matter what you tell yourself, once the chips appear, it's nom time. The salsas were delish! Most especially the habanero salsa - hot, spicy AND sweet. I'd eat that with a spoon, no chips required (and to be honest, I did dip my spoon in a couple of times, just 'cause).I ordered the pescatarian options - shrimp, salmon and Portobello mushroom tacos. The shrimp taco came with arugula and a chipotle aioli, and with a little dab of the habanero salsa, was pretty darn close to perfect. The Portobello taco was also great, and all of its ingredients gently enhanced the flavor of the mushroom - which I like. The salmon was cooked to near-dryness, and overcooked salmon is extremely pungent. There was no way I could even consider a second bite. However, two tacos paired with chips and salsa are plenty to fill you up at Nada. They were happy to bring more habanero salsa for us, and refresh water and drinks regularly.Drinks - they do have the aforementioned tequila and all associated drink combinations. They also put tequila in the sangria, which made me sorry I'd ordered beer. The cerveza here is all bottled, gotta save those taps for Mexican gold!Overall, it's a great upscale experience that won't break the bank, staff are efficient and friendly, drinks strong, and the food is good. It's worth making a reservation in order to check it out."], ["Catherine J.", "A-OK, in the best way!The Arena District needed a restaurant with a little more flair than the chainy offerings that have haunted the area (not that chains are bad, and I know this isn't the only Nada -- but I think you know what I'm saying). I think Nada mostly delivers on a promise of something different. Tacos are fun, and everyone loves guac. The cocktails are imaginative. The interior is festive and feels upscale. I enjoyed my tacos and the plating. It was the perfect stop before catching a show at the LC Pavilion. Good for groups, too.I was initially annoyed when I heard people complaining of the price here -- you can't compare Nada prices to a taco truck when you consider the full waitstaff, gorgeous and creative interior, and location. Apples to oranges and all that. However, after visiting, I did have a little bit of sticker shock... cocktails felt a dollar or two too high for comparable restaurants in Columbus. I'd agree that other fun full service taco restaurants are significantly less expensive. I'm sure Nada sets prices at what they need to be to cover costs and still be profitable, but it's just a bit spendy to do on a regular basis.So, Nada won't be where I think to go if I just want a fun taco night, but I am happy to make this a stop before or after attending other entertainment in the area."], ["Emma L.", "Nada is definitely a welcome (and much needed) addition to the Arena District. Bf & I decided to try Nada for a fun boozy brunch. I was already familiar with the prices and portions before walking in so I was prepared to spend a bit more than the typical brunch. I made a reservation via Open Table (through Yelp), called an Uber and we were on our way.The building exterior is really gorgeous and I'm obsessed with the red stained wood. It smelled over-the-top smoky, which I didn't like but once we got inside it was fine. The interior is well done and suitable for groups large or small. We got lucky and got to sit in the semi-private seating at the back of the restaurant, perched a bit above the main floor so we could spy on everyone.Every host and server we interacted with was top notch. Friendly, helpful and the right amount of conversational.We started with Chips, Salsa ($2) & Guacamole ($7). The chips are thicker and a little greasy, but I was into it. Unfortunately we must've gotten the bottom of the barrel because we had tiny little miniature chips. The guacamole is very good and I love the slices of jicama they serve with it. I would like about 12 of those instead of 2. For our mains, we each ordered Barbacoa tacos (2 for $10) and split a side of Mexican Mac & Cheese ($8). Everything was so so tasty and I liked the tacos much more than I expected (there weren't many veggies and I usually load it up). Honestly we couldn't tell the difference between the regular and the spicy, maybe they forgot one was supposed to be diablo style? At first I was afraid we wouldn't have enough food (he's a vacuum) but we had the perfect amount. Also, the Mac & Cheese was addicting, I could have slammed my face into the bowl, but I'm a lady. Ah, yes, the cocktails. We ended up on a little tour around the cocktail menu and loved every. single. one. Run down:- Bloody Maria ($7): Bloody Mary with Tequila. Great twist on a standard. - Sparkling Grapefruit ($7): Small, but tasty. Sweet, but not overly so.- Tequila Sunrise ($6): Thought it was weak at first. Nope, just well made.- Peach Fuzz ($6): YUM THIS TASTES LIKE VACATION GET ME ON A BEACH- Velvet Underground ($8): Most interesting cocktail of the bunch. Sour, but I kept wanting more.I definitely can't wait to brunch here again!"], ["Barbara W.", "Came for happy hour. Left happy! Yes, it is pricey. Keep in mind this is all fresh, drinks are amazing. No complaints about anything. We left full. Four people $78. Just know before you go, you are not buying rice and beans :)Highly recommend queso. Sliders were great but spicy and \u00a0although I'm not a fan of spicy because I have a sensitivity, everyone else thought they were mild and delicious.Hoping to go back and try brunch."], ["Susan R.", "I'm wavering on whether to give Nada four or five stars. It's a solid five star experience: great food, great drinks, beautiful restaurant, and our server was awesome.It's just. It's really hard for me to pay $15 for three tacos, no sides. Yes, they were good tacos. No, they weren't significantly better than $1.50 tacos from a good taco truck. And while I understand that Nada has bills to pay that a taco truck clearly doesn't have, I also feel like the food should be elevated enough to reflect that and give me an elevated experience.(Also . . . I mean, just saying, you couldn't throw some rice and beans on the side? I don't think a cheaper-yet-still-delicious food even exists.)Maybe I'm too simple; maybe other people put enough stock in being able to eat in a beautiful setting instead of at a picnic table outside a beat-up truck that they want to pay that much for tacos. I'm not EveryYelper, for sure.I can see myself going back and having a cocktail and some chips and guac on a night when things are slow in the Arena District (because for real, I'm not trying to be anywhere near Arena when there's a game or a concert or a confluence of bros getting their Friday night on). The tacos were good, but not good enough for me to lay down that much money for them again."], ["Amanda G.", "Visited Nada for Restaurant Week and really enjoyed it! They have (July 22-July 25) a $20, 3-course prix fixe menu and it is a slammin' deal. What I ate:1. A big 'ol Nadarita (not included in the $20 deal)2. The warmest, crispiest chips around with some spicy salsa3. A cup of Mexican Mac N Cheese that made me want to cry tears of delicious joy4. 2 tacos that were stuffed with tender grilled white meat chicken and all the fixings5. CHURROSI mean, that's a lot of food for $20. Good food. Don't come here and skip the mac and cheese. Seriously. You will be mad if your friend gets it and lets you have only a taste. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. I also sampled the barbacoa tacos which were very saucy. Almost barbeque-y. They were delicious. So was the flan. Really, everything I put in my mouth was a treat. I'm excited to come back!"], ["JaMalle F.", "My experience here for dinner the other day was absolutely wonderful. My friend and I were kind of hoping we would stop somewhere cheaper, but the quality ended up being worth MORE than the price we paid. Starting off with the easy stuff, our waitress Sophia was highly attentive and informative. She helped me make the right beer choice, and I was not disappointed in my Stiff-Arm IPA in the least bit! The set up of the restaurant was really classy. I felt positively important just from eating there. It reminded me of how grand the Cincinnati location was last I visited. I ordered Papa's Ceviche as an appetizer, and it was delicious. The fresh seafood flavors were pronounced at the beginning but it was capped off with a nice spicy finish. Very balanced. I had the pleasure of trying \u00a0both the veggie tacos and the baja fish tacos. The former was very savory with mushrooms and cheese while the latter was fresh yet not too strong of a flavor. I was highly satisfied and can't wait to go back!"], ["Arvid Y.", "Nada is a new addition to the Arena district restaurant scene. It a modern, dare I say \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant that's been successful in Cincinnati for quite a while now.My first impression after walking into the restaurant was \"wow.\" The interior is modern and luxurious with an abundance of warm lighting and wooden trim. The atmosphere is both classy and cozy. The bar area is particularly impressive with illuminated liquor bottle cabinets and hexagonal mosaic tile backsplash. Fist bump to the interior design team.The food was good. We sampled a variety of appetizers and I pretty much enjoyed everything. The guacamole was fresh and the queso was tasty. However my favorite appetizer was the haba\u00f1ero \"kreeper\" salsa. It's truly addictive and is a must-try if you enjoy spice. It comes with the salsa tasting trio, but perhaps you can just request it with your regular chips and salsa.I ordered the grilled salmon tacos, which came recommended by the waiter. They were excellent - moist and full of flavor without being too fishy. The cilantro and chipotle crema complimented the fish nicely, adding a bit of heat and sour. $19 is a bit steep for fish tacos, but it does come with 3 good sized tacos and you are paying for the atmosphere as well. I believe the pricing is less for lunch.I was very impressed with the service, especially since they just opened 2 weeks ago. The staff was on point and there were absolutely no hiccups. My water was refilled countless times and they somehow managed to flawlessly separate the checks for us individually. I had a great first impression of Nada and I will definitely be returning. The only downside I can see is the parking. There is limited street parking, but there is a parking garage close by. It is also on the pricier side for Mexican food, but as I mentioned before, you're paying for atmosphere as well."], ["Mike G.", "Rolling into Columbus right on the heels of LaRosa's Pizzeria is another Cincinnati favorite called Nada. \u00a0It's a brand new restaurant that just opened Saturday and I'm glad to see them here.My short review first:\"Mexican\" - Contemporary - Eclectic - Cool - It's Downtown - Trendy - Upscale - Chic-ish - Delicious - They Charge For Chips And Salsa - Odd But Cool Men's Room Diorama (not telling what that's about....sorry).And now my full review:This is a cool new spot in the Arena District. \u00a0I came here for lunch today not having a clue what this place was about other than it's \"Mexican\". \u00a0I like it. \u00a0It's cool looking with a very contemporary feel to it. \u00a0It's trendy but not over the top.The food was very good. \u00a0They have a moderate sized lunch menu with plenty of variety for most any taste. \u00a0I opted for the Baja Fish Taco entree which gets you two tacos. \u00a0I also got a side of Black Bean Puree. \u00a0The tacos were really good with crispy breaded fish, lime cabbage, guac and cilantro and I'd certainly get them again. \u00a0I have to give special kudos for the side dish I ordered. \u00a0The side dish, you ask? \u00a0Yeah, the side called Black Bean Puree. \u00a0I really, really enjoyed this dish which is a blend of black beans, tomatoes, onions and rice topped with Queso Oaxaca. \u00a0It was good, so good in fact that I'd go back for a big bowl of that alone. \u00a0The only thing food wise that I'm not crazy about is that they don't give you free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant in the universe. \u00a0They have them but they charge for them.Their Nadarita is their version of a margarita and it was also pretty good. \u00a0Think standard margarita with a slight fruity taste to it as opposed to tart.The service was also impressive. \u00a0Ashley was very nice and had the right balance of attentiveness without going overboard. \u00a0 Jarrod the GM also stopped by to make sure everything was to my liking. \u00a0It was. \u00a0I'm saying this is a 4 1/2 star place and I'm wanting to go back again and try some more things.Anyone with me?"], ["Karen M.", "Nada...can I just say how much I loved this place?

The the private dining areas, especially the \"birdcage\", I could live in there. And the bathrooms...totally cool...can your decorator please come do my house?I ordered three tacos. At our server, Adams recommendation,I ordered the pork belly and salmon tacos. \u00a0I also ordered the fish (I think cod) tacos.

We also had chips and salsa and guacamole...all very good as well, especially the guac. Someone ordered soup...pumpkin or squash that looked really good. I would like to try that too.The service...these guys really went all out to take care is us. And I don't think it was because we were a group of yelpers. They all, especially Adam and Molly, seemed to genuinely want to take care of us and make everything perfect, which it was. In talking with Molly after most of the group was gone, I learned of the restaurant's customer service philosophy and hiring practices. I was super impressed as I know there have been times when a mediocre meal becomes something entirely different just based on the service...these guys really seem to have it together.Looking forward to my next visit...Hope it's soon!"], ["David W.", "I'll cut to the chase: the food is really good, but it's expensive for tacos. However, the better taco places are NOT places you can go for a client meeting (Junior's, Condado, Bakersfield, La Poblanita). So I like it if it's a professional lunch, especially the fish tacos and the salsa sampler which is amazing, but if I want really good tacos for not a lot of money I'd likely go somewhere else first.

The restaurant hadn't even been open a full month. It was an enjoyable evening! Good atmosphere; food; employees. I'll start with the decor. At first glance, this place looks to be quite sophisticated. Later in the night, the Manager took our group on a tour, pointing out what stands them apart: Subtle humorous details throughout the joint that let the customer relax and have a laugh :) For instance: Skulls in the paisley-print chair cloth; a giant T rex head in the men's restrooms. The bold, bright colors used in this place are a personal favorite!!I arrived solo, and was promptly greeted upon walking in. Adam, our waiter, was an awesome gentleman. Very polite and conversational. Good personality, too! He gave a quick gist of the menu, and always seemed to check in with us at the right moments. The establishment provided complementary chips and salsa, guacamole and Queso dip for us to try. I'm impressed. The Queso dip and homemade chips was very flavorful. It had a bit of spicy to it, but nothing that killed the cheese flavor. Mmmm!! I tried some of the guac, but I thought it was slightly too salty of a taste. I ordered the Grilled Chicken tacos. Best thing about em? I could taste the chicken haha. A good amount of strips in each tiny wrap. I was especially drawn to trying this dish because the chicken tacos came with \"black bean pur\u00e9e\". I couldn't really taste it (assuming there just wasn't enough onthe tacos to stand out), and after bringing this up with Adam, he quickly offered to ringer out a complimentary side dish of the pur\u00e9e so I could judge it by itself. Not too spicy hot. I could definitely taste the beans. It had a \"sweet\" lasting taste I my mouth. Overall, this was a fantastic event put together by Mike and my tummy was satisfied :)"], ["Hannah C.", "It's Margarita Monday- aka mom and I go test out Mexican restaurants and judge them by their margaritas. We started with their Nadarita (classic lime margarita) which is $5 for their happy hour (4-6) and is very good. They use honey to sweeten it. Also got chips and salsa ($2)- also pretty good. Chips are fried, a thick, crispy chip. Good salsa. Joe was out server- he was cute, knowledgable and fulfilled our wish for a margarita sampler. Nada has multiple margarita flavors and while we wanted to try them all, we both favor the traditional margarita. We suggested to Joe that it would be neat if you could get a margarita sampler, like you can get a wine flight, and he agreed. A little while later, he came back with our very own sample set! \u00a0 Included was:Chili mango- definitely a different flavor. It's actually really good. The chili powdered rim gives it some spice. It's got mango and pineapple juice in it, giving it a bit more flavor. The little shot glass size was perfect as I'm not sure I'd want a whole one but I'd definitely say it's worth the try if you're looking for something new and like a drink with a kick!Prickly pear- it's \"the pretty one.\" Doesn't have a very bold flavor like the chili mango does but it's tasty. Fresh fruit: Blood orange- refreshing. Would be a good drink for brunch time. Fresh fruit: strawberry- pretty typical strawberry margarita- it was good (they all are though, let's be honest). You can't really go wrong with any of their options but your typical lime margarita on the rocks with salt is still my go-to. Of the options off our sampler, the chili mango was my favorite. It was different with bold flavors- not what I expected. Five stars for their margaritas and great service. Thanks, Joe! \u00a0They also have a great deal for restaurant week (July 20-25): a 3 course meal for $20! Probably going to have to go back this week just for that awesome deal!UPDATE: went back for the restaurant week deal. We had 8:30pm reservations for a Friday night and even though they were packed, still had great service this time too. \u00a0Food is really good but the portions are small. Now for restaurant week, they do 2 tacos instead of 3 and a smaller version of an appetizer and desert- which I expected. But even 3 tacos wouldn't of quiet been enough for me. We also got a quesadilla to share, knowing the portions for restaurant week were a little smaller (my boyfriend and I split everything so we could try as much as possible). It was the smallest quesadilla I have ever seen. The tortillas used are the same size as they use for the tacos, so it's not very big. Technically it's an appetizer but I wouldn't split it between anymore than 2, maybe 3, people. And it was $9. Super delicious, but for $9, I expect more food. At least big enough that one could eat it as their meal if they choose. Overall, they have great margaritas, nice atmosphere, and good food. But food is definitely way overpriced for what you get- knocking it down to 4 stars for that reason."], ["Michael G.", "It's busy and loud. \u00a0The menu is minimal. \u00a0The drinks are small and costly.I ordered the $16 taco dish. \u00a0I got three tacos, no sides, presented very nicely. \u00a0The taco tortilla was cold and hard, it was filled to the max. \u00a0Did I say they were $16 for three. \u00a0I think I'll stick with a taco truck, \u00a0Chipotle, \u00a0or El Camino. \u00a0Our server Jessica was top notch, ask for her!PS. \u00a0We had to pay for chips and salsa. \u00a0Really. \u00a0It was an endless supply however, and the chips/salsa were very good."], ["Alexis B.", "Great ambiance! I love the decor and the whole vibe. I almost forgot I was in Columbus! The service was friendly but a bit slow at times.

He was very helpful in giving suggestions for example: instead of all 3 of us ordering margaritas he told us that the pitcher = 5 \u00a0of them, so we splurged($30). We all enjoyed our meals and there was no pressure to leave, so we stayed a while. The food is good, but what makes it so nice is the atmosphere.

The lunch portion is 3 Enchiladas for $15.The lunch taco was two tacos for $10. That's one expensive taco! :) No sides with any of that. Rice or beans extra. While lunch was very flavorful, some of us left \"not fully satisfied\". While we understand the gourmet style, and location, I think for $10 you should be able to do 3 tacos with maybe a side of rice or beans. For $15 either do 4 Enchiladas or add a rice side."], ["Emily J.", "The decor is to die for. Service is attentive but not in an overbearing way. I got the Mexican Mule which they have on tap for good reason--it was delicious! Definitely not made with well tequila.

I had 3 pork tacos (2 pastor and 1 carnitas with kreeper sauce, although the kreeper wasn't too hot) that were the best tacos I've ever had. You can mix and match your taco selection which is great.

My husband had the Blueberry limonada mixed drink and it was delicious! I ordered the Arracherra which was sirloin and the salsa that I loved. This does come with avocados I asked to hold them but they forgot so I pulled them off. My wonderful waitress noticed without us saying and gave us free churros for dessert!!!!!!!! (Which were out of this world!) My husband ordered the pork belly taco with the pickled red onion and I stole one of his. It was so delicious.The ambience of the restaurant was nice. We both love contemporary establishments and this is the epitome of that.This place is worth the trip while around Columbus!! We will be back... Maybe for brunch next time!"], ["Kim D.", "I went for brunch and instead of getting typical brunch food, I ordered tacos. It was a great decision.

I highly recommend going."], ["Gerry K.", "Good chips and salsa, and some pretty good Pacifico on tap. \u00a0The salads are surprisingly good, along with a good wine selection. \u00a0Wait staff is also quite good and energetic. \u00a0The ish tacos are the best, pass on the corn and chicken enchiladas. \u00a0The butterscotch flan dessert is primo!!!"], ["Kinga M.", "Best Queso I've had!

If I had eaten there after happy hour I wouldn't have felt it was a good value, but during happy hour it was. My wine was good, guacamole was tasty, although it was not spicy at all. Chips were a little oily but crispy. \u00a0Salsa was so-so. My chicken tacos were very good. The chicken was cooked well, there was a good amount of cheese, and the pico and guacamole inside gave it a good flavor.

We have been to Nada before in Cincinnati and waited for over an hour for a table for what I thought was mediocre food and service. However, our experience Nada in Columbus couldn't have been more different. Firstly, this restaurant takes reservations and the wait was zero (although it was late on a Sunday night). Secondly, the server was wonderful, very jovial and informative. The queso was pretty good, although the chips were a bit too fried for my liking. The margaritas were excellent. I ordered the pork belly tacos (the server recommended fried eggs, so I had fried eggs on two of them), which were pretty good. My wife ordered the pastor tacos which were excellent, and my son ordered the grilled chicken tacos, which were very good as well. I wouldn't say that the food is authentic. I don't think that's the point of Nada as it aims to be more of a modern fusion type place, but overall a very satisfying meal for three with drinks and a couple of appetizers for less than $100. Definitely worth a return trip."], ["Mike B.", "I bet this is the place where all the trendy nationwide execs go out to eat lunch. The food is ok, on par with the price if just a bit small on portion. My main complaint is with the sweetness of everything. I got their blueberry lemonade and it was overly sugary, to the point where I watered it down myself. I also thought the tamale was sweet, and even the goetta I got seemed sweetened. It might have been that drink rubbing off on everything but it definitely ruined the balance with the great spicy pork in the tamale.The decor is pretty nice and comfortable, you wouldn't even know this building didn't exist a few years ago. and the service was friendly and fast. Drink, dish and side was just over $25 per person. If you get a few drinks and a few tacos I could see a $50 bill in your future."], ["Liza V.", "A mission to find the city's best queso led me to Nada. There are no words to describe the amazingness that is this queso. Just go get it, Ok?I'll admit, we were here after a night of indulging in many adult beverages, so my memory of the place as a whole may be a bit fuzzy. But I'll give you the basics:-Queso: yum. Do it.-Salsa: also very yum. Nice and smoky with some heat.-Chips: cripy and fresh.-Enchiladas: meh, for $13ish, I'll pass and just eat more queso.-Drinks: sweet and pricy. I'll pass next time most likely. -Churros: pretty much perfect. And I may have eaten the dipping sauces with a spoon when the churros were gone. We were here at the very end of the night, near closing time. Our server was great and humored us the whole time.

And I have gotten a little dresses up and went there for a nice birthday dinner with my partner and spent more on a bottle of wine than we normally would. That wine list is worth it, though. There are also many options for eating and drinking here on the cheap - they have discounted wine nights, tapas specials, \u00a0happy hour, and siesta fiesta. Both the gazpacho and the chilled and spiced peach soup on their lush patio are exactly what I want on a hot and humid day. The ferns and various planters create both shade and privacy at each table, making this one of my favorite patios in Columbus. The goat cheese stuffed avocado and red sangria - with plum brandy - add even more to the experience. So glad this place is walkable to my new place!"], ["Dia D.", "We ordered the Tapas Tasting Menu which was 7 tapas served in 3 courses for $35 per person. The first course included Ceviche de Camarones (shrimp ceviche), Ensalad de Aguacate, and Chorizo y Queso (chorizo and cheese with figs, almonds, and crackers). The second course included Mejillones (mussels), chicken, and chorizo. The third course was pineapple slice with browned sugar on it.In general, I thought that the food was ok, but definitely not the tastiest tapas that I've ever had which may be the result of ordering from the Tasting menu. I liked the first course and the mussels in the second course more than the chicken or the chorizo with potatoes. The food was a 3, but they get an extra star for good service and a nice outdoor patio."], ["Eddie H.", "I drove to Columbus to meet a friend who was in town for a business trip and we decided to head here for dinner since we both love Spain and Spanish food. We showed up around 7:30 on a Tuesday night and were quickly seated. The dining room is long and really well decorated. There was interesting art on the walls and the lighting was dim but not dark. The restaurant was about 75% full and had a lively atmosphere. I ordered an Estrella Damm while we looked over the menu and it got delivered to the table next to us which was odd. Other than that hiccup our server was attentive, had opinions and friendly. Since we had never been there before we decided to split both the tapas tasting and an order of the Paella Barcelona. The first half of our tapas tasting came out with 3 cold items; an artichoke, olive, almond mixture, an apple salad on lettuce and a filled pepper. It was all good. Our hot tapas came out along with our paella and included a potato soup, a slice of sourdough with melted cheese and a single slice of chorizo sausage, two pieces of lamb and a skewer with one scallop and shrimp. All of it was very good. The disappointment was the paella. It looked spot on but it wasn't very flavorful. The saffron was lacking, the seafood wasn't as abundant and most cruelly of all the bottom rice wasn't crisp at all. It reminded me more of a slightly Spanish inspired jambalaya than a true paella. My friend ordered the Tres Leches dessert which she ate every bite of and loved. I passed since my inner fat kid made me eat two donuts at work."], ["Tan N.", "Barcelona, oh how I wish i enjoyed your food. It's walking distance from our house and it's a great space with a nice backyard patio. It's popular so if we liked it, it would be a good hangout. Instead, we find it overrated and expensive to boot. Definitely other options in Columbus. The tapas and food selection is heavy and do not remind me of the fantastic flavors of Spain in the least. I love Spanish food and I guess I won't get to enjoy it l in Columbus. I am also annoyed by tapas places that use it as an excuse to charge more money for less food without actually serving fresh, inspired servings. They figure drinks are more important and we won't notice? The cocktails weren't amazing and I'd rather have one at Sycamoreor Curio nearby. Also, the seafood here is more of what typically is found in the area: calamari, mussels, scallops and salmon. Easily frozen and thawed, I guess. I had the salmon and it was way overdone. My other pet peeve.If you're into uninspired food that's heavy on cheese, sauce and meat and don't mind paying the prices then it's your kind of spot. Many others agree with you apparently from the ratings I've seen. I'm just not one of them."], ["Kaylin C.", "This place is amazing, me and my boyfriend shared 8 different tapas and it was such a fun experience being able to try so many different flavors.

I loved the ambience and decor of the place; it was packed for a Friday night, which is always a good sign.Our waitress was very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable on the entire menu. I had the braised short rib paella after the waitress recommended it -- it was so delicious and flavorful! I ate the entire dish and left nothing on my skillet! My husband had the scallop dish. At first, he was disappointed in its size, but later into our meal, he mentioned that it was surprisingly filling, and then continued to rave about its unique and yummy flavors!Overall, this place provided a memorable and delicious dining experience for us. Prices are a bit high; therefore, I am only giving it 4 stars. Since it's the only high end Spanish restaurant in the Columbus area, they can get away with charging this much, but I think if everything was $5 cheaper, this place would be perfect! I would definitely come back when I visit my husband's family again!"], ["Marni K.", "Eh I don't get it. My paella was bland - I mean seriously flavorless - and I think there was only chicken in my chicken and chorizo version. If there was any chorizo, it was really hard to find.

Service was good and it's a nice space but it won't be on my return list."], ["Jamie M.", "I'm going to be more critical on my rating here than I am usually for restaurants because of the price. When going to an establishment that is as expensive as Barcelona I expect the best of the best. We tried a few tapas, paellas, and some dessert. First the tapas. They were good, I would say the best part of the meal. We tried the calamari, short rib, and fingerling potatoes. The short rib was tender but the sauce was very salty, a little bit too much. The calamari was excellent and I have no complaints there. The fingerling potatoes were good as well. We tried two paellas, one with short rib and scallops and the other with lobster, mussels, clam, and shrimp. Both of these were good but nothing amazing. The short rib had too much fat for my liking. The scallops were amazing and some of the best Ive had (I wish they had an all scallop paella). The seafood paella was decent; I think you get more protein with the other paella that are not the seafood one. I really wanted to love the seafood paella, because seafood is my absolute favorite but I wasnt that impressed. The rice was a little soggy but did not compliment it as well as I expected. We finished with some carrot cake dessert which was ok. It was topped with a sweet potato sorbet which added to the dish nicely. The cake itself was nothing amazing. I would return if it wasnt so pricy. I love the atmosphere, but that's not enough to bring me back here. I would try other fine dining."], ["Katherine M.", "B.E.A.uuutiful patio, with plants and lights and fountains... Really a cool atmosphere - doesn't feel like Columbus. Great romantic setting, or also appropriate for small professional groups.Upscale menu, and everything I've tried has lived up to the hype. Great options for everyone with larger paella dishes down to tasting plates and tapas. Always have a rotating seasonal menu which is usually where I keep my eyes, knowing well I'd be back. Living down the street for about 3 years, my girlfriends and I loved catching retail wine night, which I'm not sure that they do anymore. Instead they have a weekly calendar of tasting events and live music which are also reasons to come to Barcelona instead of the other German Village competition. I'm not as frequent of a visitor anymore that I'm farther into downtown, but the drinks and food always finish under par, and the setting never disappoints.

There were four of us and we started out with an assortment of five cheeses, and three different dried meats (chorizos). The cheeses were excellent, as were two of the three meats. For the dinner we had an assortment of tapas. Everything was very good, but the shrimps in wine sauce and the avocado with goat cheese especially stood out. The mussels were also very good. My wife ordered a glass of red (excellent) while I got the Caipirinha (was just okay). For dessert we shared the chocolate brownie a la mode, which was every good as well.Overall a much better experience and we are likely to try it again soon."], ["Beth H.", "Just may be my favorite restaurant ever.

Definitely worth the wait."], ["Mike C.", "I was a little underwhelmed by Barcelona, but overall I had a good experience here.First off I really liked the building and the atmosphere. It looks small from the outside and is way bigger once you step in. The lighting and general decor are all nice (except it was a little weird to sit across from a giant mirror, I don't really want to watch myself eat.)Secondly, the service was amazing. It was probably the best I have experienced in Columbus for a long time. Very friendly and very attentive staff. I always had a full glass of water.Unfortunately the food was a bit of a disappointment for me. I ordered the bistec (steak) and, while it was a generous portion of meat, it was also not as good of a cut as I was expecting. It was described as extremely tender, however it was often difficult to slice with a steak knife and some parts took forever to chew. The steak was also underdone: my medium rare was closer to rare in some places. My date got the tapas sampler and she really liked it. Maybe that is the way to go instead of ordering off the menu."], ["Divya B.", "This probably one of the nicest spots you could dine in Columbus. It was my second time here and previously I had dined on the patio which was beautiful. This time, we sat inside and tried many of the appetizers. The mussels were good and broth was tasty. The garlic shrimp was so perfect the first time that we had to order it again. The croquettes may have been too cheesy for my taste, if they picked a more delicate cheese this would have been a winner. The breading on the calamari was amazing but with they gave some lemon with it. I tried the scallops with bacon which were both great, i just wish they used something besides Lima beans to go with it. I have very high expectations for paella so haven't yet gotten there but maybe its time so I will be back for the seafood one. The ginger walnut Manhattan and the Barcelona Manhattan were great too."], ["Emily L.", "I have wanted to go here for SO LONG and I finally got to go last night. My boyfriend and I are taking a week of staycation and we wanted to enjoy some of the city's best and this was high on our list. The meal, the drinks, and the experience make this place unlike any other. You have to go here on a nice day so you can sit on the patio. It is GORGEOUS and when you're out there, you really don't feel like you're sitting in the middle of German Village. You feel transported and relaxed. To start, we ordered a carafe of the red sangria. For $25, we got enough for 3 huge glasses of sangria each, so the price was fantastic for the amount (some places, we spend $30 alone on just 2 drinks). They brought us a little amuse bouche, which was a cucumber slice with some roasted red pepper hummus and we knew right then it was going to be a good meal, because that was super tasty on it's own. We just went for tapas for dinner, which is the way I would recommend to go. You get to try a little bit of everything and it was so fun. We started with a couple meats (Pamplona and Salchicion de Vic) and you get a good sized amount for each, just enough for 2 people to share. We also tried the Idiazabal cheese, which was like a smoked Parmesan. We then got 3 tapas: Almendras Marcona (roasted Spanish marcona almonds, which are unlike normal almonds and probably my favorite nuts ever), Costillas (braised short ribs with a blue cheese mushroom sauce and fried leeks...like your mama's pot roast x 1000), and Mejilones, Almejas, y Camarones (this is the best thing I have ever eaten...mussels, clams, and shrimp in an avocado cream sauce with house-made chorizo and bread for soaking up all the sauce...this was incredible). The couple meats and tapas were a perfect amount for the 2 of us, but we also ordered the Tres Leches cake dessert, which was also incredible (dessert is a rare treat for us, so I enjoyed it) and my boyfriend tried one more meat for the road (Picante). The entire meal was a great price. For all we ate (and for the quality of what we ate), we came in at under $100, and we were stuffed to the brim after our meal, so you could for sure come here, have a great meal, and not break the bank.

Everyone raved about the paella, so I figured I'll try something else to see if other dishes were on par with the paella. I ordered a tapas called Bistec, which was one of the items in their tapas tasting menu. Bistec was a grilled marinated tri-tip steak with bleu cheese smashed red-skin potatoes, caramelized onions and sherry vinegar steak sauce. I have to say Bistec filled me up pretty quickly and I don't even need an entree. It was definitely one of the best tapas I've ever tried. The steak was perfectly grilled on the outside, medium rare and tender on the inside. I hope this dish gets transferred to their permanent menu because it's really good!The reason why am I not giving a 5 star: If you're an impatient person or you come really hungry, just go for the variety of tapas they have to offer. My friends who ordered paella had to wait for 45 minutes for theirs to come (it was on a crowded Friday night). Their complimentary restaurant bread was a miss too, since it was pretty cold and hard. Other than that, this restaurant is awesome! My friends love their paella and scallop dish. I ended my night with a dessert called Tarta de Queso - an pistachio cheesecake and it was soooo good! Totally recommend that too!"], ["Brian E.", "I wish I could give more praise, but my first experience at Barcelona was ok to just below. The food is good, however I expected more complex flavors and innovative dishes from a restaurant at these prices and of this caliber. My family and I attended on Christmas eve.

They told us that it was about enough food for one person, but we split it between two of us plus drinks and that was plenty to keep us full. Seasonal tapas tasting menu:Cold courses:Ensalada Belga - Belgian endive salad; blue cheese, walnuts, piquillo pepper vinaigretteHumus de Calabaza - Pumpkin hummus; profiterole, pumpkin seed brittleEnsalada de Rucula - Arugula salad; fried chickpeas, dried cranberries, maple dressingSopa de Calabaza - Butternut squash soup, cinnamon sour creamHot courses:Ala de Pato - Duck wing; dried fruit chutneyManzana Horneado - Baked apple stuffed with house made chorizo and manchego cheeseTosta Berenjena - Toasted baguette with grilled eggplant, herbed goat cheese, and roasted tomatoesThe drink I got was the peach sangria and whee was it delicious. Probably my favorite part of the meal. I guess overall I'm not quite sure what my impression of the food was. The dishes are interesting to say the least, although I wasn't sure what I was eating half the time, and they definitely err more on the side of New American than authentic tapas. Maybe I just prefer familiarity with my tapas, so don't let my opinion dissuade you from giving this place a try."], ["Wenfan C.", "Absolutely one of the few finest Spanish restaurants in Columbus! We were so lucky to enjoy not only its remarkable food accomplishment but also its exclusive live music on Sunday evenings. Barcelona is a diamond in German Village; it sits and shines in the history and accumulation of this place. As usual, we had an extra portion of meal with extra joy at Barcelona. We had Sopa de Cangrejo (creamy crab soup; pepper relish; crime fraiche), Vieras (pan seared sea scallops; bacon, mushroom, baby Lima beans, dates, chile flakes, cream), Paella Barcelona, Paella de Mariscos con Curry. And for dessert, we had Specials of the day and Pastel de Chocolate (warm chocolate pudding cake; vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberry). Every single piece of seafood was perfectly and accurately cooked. And various flavors complimented the basis of main ingredients (e.g. beans and dates surprisingly add sweetness into scallops' tenderness making Vieras a complete combination of flavors). To me, natural sweetness is one of the good signs for fine seafood and Barcelona has it all! This place would be a must go if you want good seafood and Paellla in Columbus! Highly recommend Vieras and various Paellas!"], ["Sofia B.", "Great Spanish restaurant. \u00a0Ordered paella. \u00a0Of course took a while to make, it's not quick, but was excellent. \u00a0Great place for date night."]], "Rossi": [["Datis M.", "Nice space: CheckCool neighbourhood: CheckGreat Drinks: CheckFantastic Food: CHECK! Spectacular service: double check! Out in Columbus for work... decided to head to short north to grab some grub after a long day. Walk past the Rossi and saw thought it looked like a cool spot. Ask a couple locals if they had been there before and they highly recommended it. We all shared some appies: Burrata, Lamb Popsicles (holy sh*t), and Pork Belly. The pork belly wasn't my favourite... wasn't crispy enough for my liking but that may be a Columbus thing, but the sauce on the dish was incredible. The Burrata and Lamb Popsicles were really on point. We went family style for dinner: We ordered the Skirt steak... cooked perfectly rare, seasoned nicely. It was great. The hanger steak was out of this world... I don't personally like fried oysters so I avoided those but the flavour and presentation was just something else. The ham and cheese sandwich was great and the pizza was pretty good. I prefer different styles of pizza but it was definitely tasty. To top it all off, we had a rockstar server (Ashley) who took exceptional care of us and provided quite a few laughs. This is my second time in Columbus, and I can say I've had two of my top 5 dining experiences out here. Last time was at Hudson 29, now at the Rossi. Don't sleep on this spot."], ["Douglas G.", "I enjoyed the Rossi, it had an upscale feel and menu but at a decent price with a pretty good happy hour. We had the pork belly for an appetizer and it was great, but very small going with the upscale feel. Then i had the rossi burger for my entree as it was on the happy hour menu. Cooked perfectly with great fries!My lady had the salmon special and again, a very good plate of food. \u00a0The one downfall had to be our service, which i almost never complain of. Our scruffy waiter was just very lazy it seemed and didnt seem to want to be at work at all. When you have to flag down the waiter every single time you need something it gets annoying.

They've been doing the gastropub thing since what seems like before gastropubs WERE a thing. The menu has a little bit of something for everyone. Two of the most commonly discussed dishes are the pizza and the Rossi burger. Both are quite good. The pizza I'd say is some of the best in the Short North. It has an excellent crust, good quantity of flavorful sauce, and high quality toppings. The burger is thick and comes with their excellent fries. The entrees and small plates are also quite good. \u00a0The poutine is based on the same delicious fries, and comes with perfectly tender short rib. It is fairly light on the gravy however, and uses cheeses that are not cheese curds. So in the end, it's not really an authentic poutine, but is still delicious. They do well when it comes to drinks, with a curated cocktail list. As for beer, your draft options are fairly limited, but the bottle selection isn't bad. I understand that the chef has recently moved on to another venture, and so there is someone new in the kitchen. Not sure if or how things will change, but hopefully they continue to turn out delicious food!"], ["Brandon L.", "I went here once.

I actually was picturing a Lindey's esque style decor, kind of surprised when we walked in. Not \"showy\". The chocolate brown velvet seating for their booths was odd, I thought. And, way smaller than I was expecting. As the evening carried on, it filled up though. The mother and I shared the Ceviche for an appetizer. I'm a bit torn on this dish: Good size chunks of crab, but the lemon (?) hints combined in the creamy sauce made a few of the bites a bit odd. And gritty? Can't put my finger on it... I got the Pistachio Crusted Salmon entree. Magnificently done cut of fish. So moist and full of flavor! The entire dish was a winner. Cooked spinach placed on top of barley? Couscous? Either way, it had a hint of lemon drizzle taste. Good mix of flavors. I had a bite of the Flourless Brownie. Basically a square of dense fudge. I didn't care for the brownie, I like hot and gooey. They weren't serving it with the Jeni's Salty Caramel ice cream, instead came with a scoop of vanilla. But the caramel drizzle over the whole thing was WOW! And I don't like ice cream toppings - that's how unbelievably good it was. Total bummer it was only a drizzle :)"], ["Katie B.", "My friends and I stopped by Rossi on our way to T Swift (best concert of my life) because we spotted the happy hour deal and couldn't resist (and also because it was on our way to Nationwide). According to one of my Columbus-native friends, it was one of the best the city has to offer. You really can't go wrong with $5 glasses of wine and $2 well drinks, can you? I loved the ambiance too: kind of rustic and romantic, and looked more pricey than the menu indicated. It also reminded me of a few of my favorite spots back home in Cincinnati, so that scored them some unexpected brownie points.Aside from the great drink specials, they also had pretty great deals on food. I had the margarita pizza happy hour deal ($7 for a VERY generous size pizza) and my friends all had the $8 burger special. My only complaint was we talked to our waitress about how many portions of the fries and aioli appetizer we should order for the four of us, and even after we had that discussion, she failed to mention that the burger (which 3 out of 4 of us had ordered) also came with the same fries. So basically we had two fries apps and an additional 3 servings of fries. I didn't know there was such thing as too many fries, but I think they proved that was, in fact, not true.Either way, I won't think twice about coming back -- especially since my bill was less than $20 for two glasses of wine and dinner!"], ["Helen S.", "I just ate here for happy hour earlier this evening with my bf since we were looking for something open on Labor Day, and this seemed like a great option.

The poutine has the most amazing fork-tender, melt-in-your-mouth shortrib and fries that have a great texture, considering that they weren't soggy after swimming in all that delicious gravy. This was way too much food for the two of us, so lesson learned to be less greedy next time.Only complaint?

That what happened at the Rossi! I went with the Hangar Steak and I had a delicious meal! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and seasoned very well. There were fried polenta oysters served on the side added great flavor to the dish but were a bit on the salty side for my taste.

I've been here 3 or 4 times in the past few years, just now getting around to writing a review lol - so here goes:Atmosphere: very cozy with the dim lighting at night, large enough that it doesn't feel crowded, not noisy, comfortable tables and booths. They just put up a Christmas tree for the holidays too, really pretty! Also great location in the Short North!Price: apps range from like $8-15, sandwiches/salads/pizzas are around $15, more upscale entrees are $20-28, cocktails ~$10. Overall affordable upscale modern dining imo, well worth the price. Service: never had any issues with service, we were always seated promptly and waiters/waitresses took time to explain the menu and any specials. Food comes out pretty fast too.And of course, food: the menu rotates (maybe every 3-6 months), but all of the food I've gotten here is exceptional. My favorite was a short rib appetizer that is sadly no longer on the menu, but I remember the short ribs just melting in your mouth (please bring it back!). I also have gotten the pork sugo ($22) twice, which is pappardelle with shredded pork, in a buttery hazelnut sauce - very flavorful and filling. I've gotten the seafood of the day twice also - first time was an amazing crab tempura with sriracha glaze and second time was haddock with brussel sprouts and potatoes in a white wine sauce. Overall, one of my go-to restaurants in Columbus for special occasions and when outside friends are in town and I want to take them somewhere nice. Never disappoints! They also have groupons occasionally ($25 for $50 worth of food - great deal), so be on the lookout for those! :)"], ["Carolyn K.", "For me, places like The Rossi are as good as it gets for Cbus nightlife. The ambience is exactly what I envision for a low-key, classy night out with my manfriend or a small group of friends. And the menu - can you say \"party in my mouth\"?

Most recently, I had the tomato and mushroom gallette, which is heartier than it sounds (yet still light and refreshing), super flavorful and surprisingly filling for a vegetarian dish.The drinks are always good n stiff and the bar service is incredibly attentive.

Infusions, fresh herbs, and sugar cubes lined the bar - right then and there I knew I would like this place. I ordered up a take on a gin and tonic infused with thyme and cucumber. They were out of thyme, and the bartender said it was just as good with sage and he was right. It was heavenly! Very balanced and refreshing. The bf ordered a bourbon.

I chose the linguini and clams and my roommate had the lamb as entrees, and I also had a beet salad to start. Every piece of my meal was fresh and I could tell that care was put into every step of the process. The beets on my salad tasted like they had pickled them right in the restaurant which was awesome, and even the butter they served with the bread was flavored by hand in-house.Overall I would recommend this place for a good quality dinner out if you find yourself in the Olde Towne East area, but it's not worth driving a long distance for."], ["Jen R.", "My husband and I saw this place has amazing happy hour deals.

We had never heard of Black Creek Bistro, but their Restaurant Week menu sounded pretty good so we decided to give it a try.The restaurant itself is located in a less-bustling area, a bit southeast of Downtown. I think there was a parking lot across the street, but we found a spot on the street right outside of the entrance. The restaurant is also on the smaller side, so if you plan on arriving during peak dinner hours, a reservation definitely helps. Otherwise, it's totally fine to wait in their bar room and enjoy one of their many beers and wines.Black Creek Bistro advertises itself as a seasonal, farm-to-table restaurant (I believe our waiter says they get most of their produce from a farm outside of Canal Winchester). Because it was Restaurant Week, their special menu had a tropical theme to it. For my courses, I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche, Cabbage Apple and Papaya Salad, Caribbean Rubbed Chicken Quarter, and one of their seasonal desserts (which was described to us as a play on s'mores and moon pies). My boyfriend also had the Caribbean Chicken as his entree, but ordered the Teriyaki Wings, Curry Potato Salad, and the other dessert choice, which was a Bavarian Lime Custard.Everything was very fresh and delicious. By the time we got to the dessert course, we barely had room in our stomachs! The only complaint I have is that the chicken quarters were cooked inconsistently. While my chicken was underdone and had a bit of a rubbery texture, my boyfriend's chicken was a little bit dry and overcooked. Other than that, it was a very satisfying meal.In addition to the great food, we also had a great waiter!

He said the spicy ketchup was different, in a good way. I thought the white truffle aoli was quite flavorful. We were then delivered a variety of fresh baked rolls with their unique, butter of the day-this time being pear butter. It was the best butter we've ever tasted. The hint of pear was so subtle but amazingly delicious.For our entrees, I had the scallops which were served with a unbelievably tasty charred tomato emulsion and portobello risotto. YUM!! He had the lamb shank which was braised and served with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The lamb was tender and meaty, not gamey at all. There was no room for dessert but on another note, the service was excellent, attentive and fast.

When I saw it on the Dine Originals list, it immediately jumped to the top of mine, right above the numerous restaurants I've never tried before. I was glad others expressed interest, and a party of six proved to be about the perfect size for BCB.I admit that I am a green nerd. I go out of my way to consider the environmental impact of my decisions and adjust accordingly.[1] That said, one of the things I remembered most about Black Creek was that they have a farm where they grow as much of the produce and livestock used in the preparation of their menu as possible. In fact, the Black Creek farm existed BEFORE the restaurant. I'll limit my discussion of their sustainable practices to that,[2] but suffice it to say, these practices have influenced my review to the tune of one star. Those of you that follow my reviews are probably aware I am a pescetarian (a fishetarian, as I've been saying lately, or a vegequarium, as the waiter said tonight). You may not know why though. I gave up red meat and pork after my father had a massive heart attack in '03. He passed in '05, and I gave up chicken shortly after, when I moved back to Ohio, where the vegetarian options are far greater than rural WV.My secondary reasons are environmental in nature. I'm not against the killing of animals (sorry PETA, et al.) when it's done sustainably and humanely (given the circumstances). Couple that with the fact that I like to try new things, and I decided to break my diet tonight, something I hadn't done since Burgundy Room a few years back. \u00a0My four course meal:[3] - Roasted Beet and Apple Salad (featuring a nut that definitely WASN'T pistachios [as advertised]).- Bistro Frog Legs- Game Hen Surprise- PB and J Bread PuddingIn addition, I had a glass of Riesling,[4] a featured honey martini,[5] and some bistro fries provided thanks to the generosity of Matt W. The bistro fries were salty/spicy, but in a good way. The beet and apple salad could have used some more apples, but was a sweet, fresh start to my meal. Whatever those nuts were (consensus was pine or pumpkin), they added a perfect, toasted note to the salad. Frog legs were a new one for me. I'd been debating whether they broke my diet or not. From a conscientious point of view, I feel like they did. And when you look at them, I don't care what you say, sucking the meat off a frog's leg bone ain't the same as eating a fillet of salmon. Either way, they were interesting. The meat DID have a seafood-like hint to it, particularly in the thicker pieces. They were paired to perfection with a tomato concasse and a buttery sauce.Once I'd decided on the frog legs, it was easy to solidify the deal with the game hen. The hen was served with some lightly mashed taters (that is to say, they were pretty darn chunky) and a mild chili sauce. It was the highlight of the night, and not gamy at all. Far less creepy looking than the frog legs. Hah! The tender hen was fantastic alongside the soft mashers...I have no regrets!As for the PB and J bread pudding, I'll simply say that while it was good, I've had better elsewhere (Cap City comes to mind). One thing that would help would be slightly more of the \"J\" drizzled around the plate.Overall, it was a fantastic meal. I realize it's a bit steep for some of my fellow yelper's budgets, but I think it's the sort of place we should all support more frequently if we can manage. The fact that you can have food THIS good, and do so in a responsible and sustainable way, OUGHT to be affecting the entire industry on a much larger scale. Change is too slow.

I really cant complain about any of the dishes I've had there. Always impressed. When the bill came around it wasn't that bad either. So all and all I really enjoy my time at BCB. I will be back.

Scallops & risotto were perfect. My friend had duck gnocchi. Both were divine."], ["Maria S.", "Another 5-star review for Black Creek Bistro hardly seems necessary, but I will write one anyway just to pay homage to this Columbus culinary gem. The first time I visited Black Creek was actually for the rehearsal dinner of our wedding, courtesy of my new in-laws. Everyone was extremely impressed by the food (even my brother-in-law, who is a notoriously picky eater), and I was also thrilled with the service. The owner paid a visit to our table to congratulate us, and the servers kept everyone's wine glasses full. I also particularly like that this place has a dedicated parking lot since I am the world's worst parallel parker.My husband and I finally returned yesterday evening with a gift certificate we've been holding on to since Christmas. We had planned to use it to celebrate the purchase of our first house in Merion Village (right down the road from Black Creek), but when that window had passed, we intended to go for our first anniversary. Missed that one, too, so we ended up using it for a random date night!Since we had some \"free money\" to burn, we went all out with cocktails, an appetizer, entrees, and dessert (can't remember the last time I got all that in one meal!). Husband ordered the Thyme Gimlet, which he totally bogarted despite the fact that I generously let him sip my St. Grandview cocktail (Watershed gin & St. Germain Elderflower liqueur). I think it's safe to say both drinks were great! We then ordered the Pancetta Pear Crisps as an appetizer, which were the perfect start to the meal. There are four crisps on the plate, which was great for the two of us. There is nothing particularly Spanish about this appetizer, but it still reminded me of tapas we got in Madrid, and I got nostalgic.When it came to meal time, I ordered the Duo of Lamb while Husband opted for the Seared Day Boat Scallops. I don't get to eat lamb that often (a fact that torments me daily), so I had the server recommend how to have it cooked (medium rare). The lamb was fantastic with the reduction, and came with mashed potatoes and zucchini as sides. I'll admit, I wish the sides were a bit more interesting, but they were not bad by any means. Husband was feeling generous enough to give me a substantial piece of one of his three large, perfectly cooked scallops.I had the rest of my lamb meal boxed up so I could save room for dessert. Our server (who I finally decided bore an uncanny resemblance to Trip van der Bilt of Gossip Girl, but with facial hair), recommended their \"special\" dessert, a bacon bourbon cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was wonderful, though I didn't get the \"bacon\" flavor. A great end to the meal!Our bill came to around $90 before tip with all of that, which I think is completely worth it for the quality of meal and service we received. We will have to go back for the fixed price dinner Monday-Thursday when we don't have a gift card handy! My only regret is that I accidentally left my boxed lamb meal on the table when we left! I've been consoling myself by telling myself it wouldn't have been as good reheated... right?! Sigh."], ["Johnny G.", "It had been a while since we'd been here - big mistake to stay away for so long. We had an early dinner with our daughter and everything was great. It's nice they open at 4:00 and we almost had the place to ourselves. Drinks came quickly as did our appetizer of bistro fries. Firehouse cocktail amazing. Great looking cocktail menu. Diet Coke (daughter) was flat. Bistro fries weren't exactly crispy but they were hot and the white truffle aioli hit the spot. My bistro pasta was really good. The noodles were fresh and the flavor of the tomatoes was excellent. Minor issue: I asked to leave the cheese off but it came anyway. The Bistro salad was great and came out without cheese as requested by my daughter. Her trio of hummus was also very good and the abundance of veggies over pita bread was appreciated. I knew my wife would order the duck gnocchi when I saw the menu and I was right. It was the most unique and complex item we ordered and a big hit. Very well thought out dish.

Fianc\u00e9 loves Brussel sprouts and got their Brussel sprout salad which was nothing impressive and again overpriced for the portion size. Lamb shank was incredibly tender but the flavorless mashed potatoes and unseasoned zucchini ruined the entree for me. How hard is it to slightly season the vegetables? He had a seared duck with risotto which was not cooked well and was a disappointment, way too many cherries in the risotto which ruined what little flavor there was otherwise. Service was poor. Everyone around us was given bread and butter and we were not offered. Server rushed us to either finish our bottle of wine or let the him take it away and put in a bag for us to take it home.

It is one of those, but that is only one small part of the appeal. \u00a0Many restaurants have bars, and some have little storefront areas where one can purchase a few items, but few have a large space with multiple tasting counters - this place has all of the above and is yes, a restaurant, but also a great spot for a Columbus wine lover.Usually for a wine tasting, one has to travel to his/her state's \"wine country\" and show up at a vineyard for a tour and tasting. This tends to take an entire Saturday afternoon for the drive from a major metropolitan area, and if your state doesn't have a wine country, you must add in the time to travel to a state that does have one.Enter Cooper's Hawk. \u00a0Clearly, there's no room for acres of vines in the Easton town center, so they ship wine in from the home vineyards in Illinois. \u00a0There is a wine club - people can join for regular tastings, specials on bottles of wine (there is an option to receive a set number of bottles per month) and the pleasure of bonding with other wine lovers at the tasting counter. \u00a0It's an easy date night idea for those who don't go out that often and a place that I recommend visiting if you are in town.I'm not a wine expert, but there was an interesting variety, and a few that I would get. \u00a0Being associated with a winery means that wine flights and glasses are reasonably priced. \u00a0The staff seemed friendly, and most importantly, the patrons seemed to really enjoy being there. \u00a0A solid execution of an interesting concept."], ["Ben T.", "So, we had a few wine flights.

Nothing to really complain about but nothing to write home about either. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms on the server's recommendation. They were tasty but missing something...maybe a little more heat? The burgers were not bad. The turkey burger was well seasoned but again, missing something. The blue cheese burger was tasty, but not mind blowing. Best part of the meal: the pretzel bread!

They quoted us 30 to 35 minutes, so we decided to put our name in and wait it out. 45 minutes later we're told it will be 10 more minutes because they \"got behind on their reservations.\" Fine, we'll wait. Twenty minutes after that, we're told it will be another 15 to 20 minutes because they're \"just so much busier than expected.\" \u00a0Granted, I don't run a restaurant, but I would expect that those in charge would know exactly how many people have reservations and how many people need to be seated before a party. Quoting an unrealistic wait time three times in a row is ridiculous. \u00a0And doing so without any sort of apology is incredibly annoying and rude.We finally got the text that our table was ready about an hour and a half after putting our names in.

It's so good I bought two bottles to take home. I ordered the crab cakes garlic green beans and Betty's potatoes. I enjoyed all parts of my meal as it's probably the first time I've ever ordered those as my meal. My husband ordered the ginger salmon Asian slaw and wasabi potatoes.

That, in itself, gets 4 stars.But in all seriousness, this is a good restaurant. I've been here a number of times -- for lunch and dinner, and I've been satisfied every trip. For lunch, I love their soup and salad combo (the BEST Caesar dressing and chicken tortillas soup). For dinners, I've gone the sandwich route -- a great burger and a great chicken sandwich.One of the fun parts about Cooper's Hawk is they have quite the selection of wines. And for being known as a winery, the wines are very affordable. The gift shop in the front of the store can get a little pricey but I love doing a little window shopping there while waiting for my party or a table. To me, it seems like there's a sort of upscale feel to the restaurant, but the prices are affordable. It's great for a date night after a day or evening of shopping at Easton. From my experiences here, it's been a great choice each time.

All in all, great tacos but crappy service. I would recommend you try Hass at least once.(1) Service -- Service was definitely not up to par. To order, go up to the register, place order, take a number, and then wait for your food to be brought to your table. They have a pretty quick turnaround, and we weren't waiting a long time for our food. The woman taking my order rushed us and had a really bad attitude. I went up a second time to order a couple more tacos, and she acted like I was interrupting her, like a child or a nuisance. Fix the attitude, and I'd gladly come back. (2) Taste and quality -- Taste and quality was ALL there. I highly recommend any one of the tacos. The food was extremely fresh. When you order, keep in mind that tacos are at least $2 for one. I would recommend getting one of each taco and then going from there to see what you like best. \u00a0The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the steak burrito (I cannot attest to any other kind of burrito). Although it was fresh, the taste was bland.(3) Space -- This is a come as you please establishment. When you go inside, there are several high top table with stools and regular tables (fit up to 4 people, but I'm sure you could push them together to accommodate your party). I think Hass is great for families with children, casual dates, big groups, and for those who want to eat alone. You go up to the register, order, and wait for your food to be brought to you. When you're done eating, take your dirty dishes/tray to the trash.Side note: I noticed that a lot of people were ordering take-out. I think that's what we will do next time."], ["Kevin K.", "We had a bad experience. Drove to this place wanting some tacos. Waiting in line we knew this was a bad choice. Cashier argued with the couple ordering. Wife ordered, I started my order, the cashier walks away from the register. Comes back I start again, cashier again repeats order from people before us. Finally we complete our order, gather our chips and salsa, and drinks, find a seat and wait. Half an hour later, the order before us, goes out the door, the order after ours goes to the table with family with three kids. Our papa, fish taco, shrimp taco, al pastor taco, nowhere to be seen. A few minutes later our food comes out, 40 minutes after we order, I checked our receipt. Papa caliente was good, wife enjoyed it. My taco al pastor had one piece of meat, tasted like the cilantro, shrimp taco was breaded fried, menu showed unbreaded shrimp, it was very good. Fish taco was left uneaten, I could not get past the fish smell. I was so excited about the reviews of this taco. \u00a0I wanted to like this place, service was rude, food was average, cost was high for what we got. $9.99 papa, $2.50 fish taco, $2.99 shrimp taco, $2.00 al pastor taco, $2.00 chips, $1.00 salsa, and $2.00 diet Pepsi.

The pork is cooking right in front of you at the register and it's so delicious! I saw this on Yelp when I came into Columbus for the weekend and I had to try. Brought the whole family! I tried every taco between my boyfriend and I. My favorite was the Carnitas ones. Completely stuffed and topped off tacos! Couldn't have been happier with this place, service was on point as well because the guy behind the register knew the whole menu by heart and explain every inch of it to us.

My choices of Mexican restaurants have gotten increasingly better with every outing. At first, I discovered El Tacoriendo and fell in love with the authenticity of the place. Next up, I found out about Los Gauchos Taequira and that was my favorite for about 3 weeks. That journey continues as just recently I discovered......Hass. Think of it as Los Gauchos with more seasoned food minus the peppers and onions on the table. Larger space, smaller menu, and slightly more flavor all lead to a wonderful dining experience"], ["Michael M.", "This place may have been having a bad day when I ordered food, but this first visit to Hass is not going to change up my routine. Los Guachos still reigns as the best taquieria, followed by the Taco Loco. I don't explore the Eastside as much compared to the west side of town so maybe there are taco trucks on the east side better better or as good and I just haven't found them yet.I went ahead and ordered the burrito Hass with Pastor, and well everything tasted good nothing was outstanding or different compared to some of the other businesses I named. Also the meat had too much gristle that was inedible and made it harder to enjoy my burrito because the last thing you want is to pullout something you just got done chewing on from your mouth. Even the gristle is something I would let slide but I took my order to go and the salsa cups that they use are very small to begin with and both of the salsa cups were filled up about halfway meaning for a good size burrito, I only had about an ounce of salsa for the entire burrito. It's little things like this that might make somebody not return especially when there're other taco places that are more convenient for me and are better.I will give this place another try but just not anytime soon. The only real positive I can give this place is the layout of the seating, big ample space and plenty seats unlike Los Guachos which is extremely cramped at times."], ["Mary B.", "Stopped by after seeing good Yelp reviews. This is a fast causal mexican restaurant. \u00a0Grab a few different tacos, quesadilla, \u00a0burritos without breaking the bank. They serve beer and margaritas too.

The queso was really runny but had a slight kick of jalape\u00f1o. \u00a0Not my favorite but the homemade chips made up for it. I got the shrimp tacos.

Al pastor is my favorite kind of meat, so I judge all my tacos off of that. Personally, I think Los Guachos has the best pastor on the city, but this place isn't too far behind. The meat itself is well seasoned and has a nice texture to it after they throw it on the grill. One thing I didn't like was that the pineapple comes diced. I prefer having a nice big chunk of pineapple, but to each their own PPP. Besides that tho the taste is on point. These tacos are kinda pricey tho ($2 for al pastor) which also knocks it down. \u00a0I will say tho that I liked the horchata here a lot more than Los Guachos, so be sure to order a cup of it! \u00a0Finally, the salsas here are also pretty good so experiment with those. Happy eating!"], ["Gwen W.", "I organized a Yelp UYE at this joint last night. It's had been a several months since my last stop in here. The food hasn't changed. But the actual strip-mall space that Hass was occupying is now bigger. Hass has aquired the shop space next door. They've knocked down the dividing wall. This was the perfect move, in my opinion: It's so much bigger of an eatery, now!! For our UYE, Hass was able to set up several four-tops; a giant, long table so everyone could chat!! The management was awesome, too! The GM gentleman was great: hilarious, sarcastic, knowledgeable out the store's water source **hehe**!out orders where brought out pretty fast, considering the place was full with hurry patrons.

However, I can safely say that the tacos at Hass are some of the best i've ever had. I haven't tried Los Guachos yet, but these ones are comparable to the awesome tacos I had at El Tuzo Taco (taco truck).A combination of great taste and fair pricing make these tacos great. Each taco runs about $2. They are good sized with plentiful toppings, but you will still need to order 3 to 4 tacos in order to be full. I tried the chorizo, al pastor, shrimp and fish tacos. My favorites were the al pastor and fish. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was well-seasoned. I particularly enjoyed the pineapple and avocado sauce in the al pastor. Despite all the toppings, the consumption of these tacos were surprisingly mess-free. \u00a0 \u00a0My other Yelp colleagues were a little less impressed with their Bronco Burrito. They thought it was \"missing something\" and they ended up drowning their burritos in hot sauce. I also sampled their mini quesadilla, whicc was just okay. My advice would be to stick with the tacos. Overall a very solid taco joint. $9 and change got me 4 tacos and a beer.

We're both huge fans of authentic Mexican fare, so I knew he'd want to try it.Wow, the tacos at this place are amazing, particularly the pastor tacos. The meat is cooked on the spit perfectly, and they give you a lot of it with a nice green sauce on top along with pineapple, onions, and cilantro. The red and green sauces on the table were delicious as well. I also got a pastor quesadilla, which was pretty good but incredibly small. I loved the taste of it, but I don't think I'd get it the next time. It was the same price as the tacos at $1.75, but as soon as you add meat to it, it bumped the price up to over $3 when it was literally the same exact ingredients as the tacos plus cheese but with less meat. They even use the same small corn tortillas to create it. You're not foolin' me! Lower the price or make the quesadilla bigger.Anywho, I'll forgive my minor gripe, because the meal tasted so good. This place needs to expand closer to downtown, or better yet, my street, so I don't have to make the 20 minute drive every time I want these awesome tacos."], ["Katye M.", "I've been here once and it is now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town!

I ordered four al pastor tacos and a Burrito Bronco. Both tasted amazingly! The taco is topped with pieces of pineapple which brought out the savory seasoning of the pork. The burrito is big and it's not so cheesy that it covers up the taste of the rest of the ingredients, like other places. The burrito is super rich and makes Chipotle burritos look like something ordered from Taco Bell.

The burritos are fantastic (the Hass one in particular is worth a try), the fish tacos are an obvious go to, and lastly another favorite of mine are the Al Pastor tacos. As you can see from some of the pictures posted here despite the reasonable price you get food that looks excellent, has a varied and delicious flavor profile, and the ability to mix and match a bunch of different items via their a la cart style ordering.The atmosphere at Hass is also pretty cool. It's clean but casual and they'll sometimes have a soccer match going on their big screen for you to enjoy. The staff is very courteous and all in all the place is a fantastic experience.

I made a reservation this morning and received a call in the afternoon to confirm it and let me know they offered complimentary valet. The valet was great as I could see no available spaces open in proximity to the restaurant.Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted, but had to wait a while while the host took a large party reservation/payment. Apparently, they use a computer system to track your seat. We were seated right where we asked and it was lovely by the front windows with a pretty flower box right outside. Like I said, our waitress was great. We ordered the risotto fritters and they also brought our some house focaccia. Both were excellent. I would say the risotto fritters were the best arranccini (sp?) we've had in town. Highly recommended. The bread was great too. Well seasoned. I ordered the veal and pine nut meatball as per the waitress's recommendation and my date got the linguine del mar. He enjoyed his meal with fresh seafood and house made pasta. For me, the first bites of my meal were great until I found the stone cold center of the meat ball. Our waitress quickly took care of it and even brought me a different menu item since I was grossed out at this point with ground meat. In the mean time, she and the host took care to make sure I knew the meat balls are fully cooked prior to being reheated and served. I guess that makes me feel a bit better. I ordered the chicken parm to replace it. It was just ok. It was definitely much hotter than my first dish, which was comforting. The buccatini pasta was WAY over cooked and the chicken was slightly underdone in the thicker end of the breast (which I did not share with our waitress as I didn't want to seem crazy and I was full anyway). They served my date a cute pizelle cookie with chocolate mousse on it for his birthday, gratis. A nice gesture. Oddly, after my second dish was served, the window shades started coming down and the wind blew them into our table knocking stuff over and bonking the guy behind me in the head. Apparently someone \"accidentally\" hit the button for the shades to close. For a higher end restaurant, it was just disappointing.For reference, one glass of wine, an iced tea, the fritters, linguine, and parm it was $60. I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed with the evening despite the effort of service and awesome risotto fritters and my date enjoying his meal."], ["Nick D.", "Went here with a party of 7 for an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday.Despite the whole party having arrived by 8:30, it was nearly 9pm before a server visited our table, and only then to ask if someone else was helping us. Shouldn't she know?After making an order for an appetizer for the table, it was still 40 minutes after we arrived before any food or drink hit the table. Ordering a bottle of wine in this \"wine bar\" was an interesting experience. Firstly, the server seemed confused answering some questions to help me pick between two wines. Secondly, there was another significant wait for the wine to arrive. And, lastly, to top off the experience, when the same server arrived to serve the wine, she brought 7 glasses that she proceeded to arrange on the table in front of my wife. She poured each glass, and in confusion we passed glasses of wine around the table so everyone got one. Surely if you are going to describe yourself as a wine bar, you should teach your servers how to properly serve a bottle of wine?!?The appetizers that came out were pretty good. A flatbread, a cheese board, and a meat board. The portion of cut meats was a little mean. No serviceware was brought with the meat or cheese boards, and bread for the table seemed a distinct afterthought, but was very nice when it came.After ordering entrees, we were informed that two of the orders on the tables were not available. The server explained that the restaurant had had an unexpectedly busy, which maybe explains the other problems during our visit.I had a lamb loin as my entree, ordered medium, came a little undercooked. The meat was good, but the pasta was not. It rather gave the impression that it had been waiting to be served for a while, it was stuck together and a little dry.Towards the end of the meal, the service problems got even worse. First, the server started clearing wine glasses without offering us more wine. She then failed to offer us dessert before asking how she should break down the bill, if it hadn't been for a nice looking dessert appearing for another table I would have thought they had stopped serving.The server seemed to want to get us out of there. She quickly cleared the rest of the table, we weren't even offered coffee. Then, in a bizarre twist, she started to talk to us about our check through a large circular hole that was in the wall behind our table. It is rather comical to keep having your conversation interrupted by a server poking her head through a hole in the wall, but not something that should feature in a good quality restaurant. When the bills finally came back, after a long while, they had been split incorrectly. We paid up and settled the problem between ourselves. We sat and chatted some more, before another server came by and collected the signed card checks from our table as our \"server wanted to finish her paperwork\". It was barely 10pm on a Saturday night, so not late by any extent of the imagination, but we felt rather rushed to get out. Given other reviews here, it seems this place can offer a great experience. On the whole the food and wine was pretty decent, but it was really let down by comically bad service. If I had been offered a dessert, the fabulous display I saw come out for another table may well have made up for my mediocre entree, but our server's rush to get us out left me with a rather bad taste about this place!I hope she enjoyed her Saturday night wherever it was she was rushing to go to, as by choosing to dine at Z Cucina Di Spirito, I certainly did not enjoy mine as much as I hoped."], ["Diana T.", "Came back a second night bc so yummy first night.

Sever was knowledgable well spoken and nowhere near pushy nor did he hover. Was honest when we asked for recommendations. Will continue to speak highly about to my friends."], ["Michelle S.", "We had a great experience dining at Z Cucina for our 15th wedding anniversary. Upon entering the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by Rick (the owner) and sat at a wonderful table. The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful. It's very nicely decorated, the tables are well spaced and not too close to each other, and it's not too loud or too quiet. \u00a0We were quickly greeted by our server, who was knowledgable and friendly but not overbearing. She made wonderful recommendations for each course. First up, we ordered drinks. They were brought to the table quickly. Both the dirty vodka martini and the grape martini were perfectly mixed. To start, we ordered the house made mozzarella and risotto fritters. Both were exceptional. I would return for the appetizers alone. My husband and I then had the spinach and Caesar salads. Both were very good. Lastly, we had the shrimp and spring pea pasta and chicken parmesan. Both were were amazing. We would have loved to try dessert but were too full by the end of the entree course. We will definitely be returning to Z Cucina in the near future."], ["J W.", "Z Cucina - cold patio and maybe racistOur Valentines Day trip to Z Cucina was on a cold evening, and we were hesitant when we were seated on the patio. There are radiant heaters above head height on the wall, so the air temp was passable. That doesn't help though when you are seated inches away from the canvas and plexiglas outside wall of the patio, the 20 degree temp outside was chilling that side of my body. It wasn't bad enough to ask to be re-seated, and the place was packed, so it would have been a long wait. It was just a cheap, half-assed way to increase the seating, and that alone was enough to spoil the meal.The service was good, the food OK. I can't say it was any better than other Italian restaurants in the area. There was nothing that seemed to justify the high price of the meal.I noticed an odd fact as I was eating - there were a number of non-whites seated out in Siberia with me, and I didn't see any inside on our way to the table. On a trip to the bathroom later, my wife confirmed, there were none seated inside the restaurant. Does the Z Cucina have a policy of seating minorities in the less comfortable outside area? The count was 6 outside, none inside while we ate. Maybe that was a fluke, but it was an awfully suspicious one. On our way out, we talked to the couple who had the table behind us, the guy had water dripping on his head during the meal. They asked for a new table, and after waiting 20 minutes for a manager to arrive, they just told the manager to give them the check, bag up the food and they left. The patron was not loud or insulting, but he didn't get treated very well by the manager. I would have left too. Oh, this guy was also non-white.There are plenty of Italian restaurants in the area that don't cheap out with cold drippy patios and don't send the minorities to the back. I'll be patronizing them instead of Z Cucina."], ["Anna T.", "Extremely mediocre place to eat. Sub par Italian food. I got the margarita pizza which just had way too much pesto and cheese on it. Usually margarita pizzas are lighter and refreshing. My mother did not like the lasagna at all.

By no means was I disappointed though! But I do feel as though I can find food on par with Z Cucina elsewhere for a lower price. Honestly, there isn't must else to say other than that either. I will state that I think the appetizers are more creative and tempting to eat than the entrees."]], "Si Se\u00f1or": [], "Spagio": [["Colleen W.", "Dined solo at the bar on a Friday night after a long day of driving.

They offer a decent selection of wood-fired pizza, which was incidentally what I was craving, and I wish I had gone to Hounddog's instead. Their service is comparably shoddy, but at least their pizza is good. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. After all, I only ate a pizza (Jalape\u00f1o if you're wondering what to avoid). They have a much wider selection that apparently encompasses European and Pacific Rim \"cusine\" (as seen on their website). But that's a separate issue from the customer service. Our drinks took forever to get there, and we hadn't even ordered the food yet. It wasn't even busy. And then the rest of the night just felt uncomfortable every time we were checked upon, like the waitstaff was burning holes through our heads. If that person was a struggling actor looking for practice--which is unlikely because this isn't LA--then maybe Columbus is actually the right place because this person isn't ready to head any further west.I'll be back to give them another chance.

We have not had a problem with bad service at all, so I was surprised to read that. Maybe it is a different experience from brunch to dinner, but I highly recommend checking out Spagio for brunch.

In fact, they're the only thing I've ever ordered for dinner (oops!). I love the brie pizza. The pear and brie and the crunchy nuts all on top of that apple butter, it's a sweet little slice of heaven. The spicy shrimp pizza is pretty phenomenal as well. Can't get over that delicious spice rub on the shrimp and how well it really meshes with the other flavors. John C. ordered up the veal meatballs last time and, while alfredo of any kind is normally a huge put-off for me, paired with those savory meatballs and the herbs sprinkled across the top, it's actually really good. I was surprised I liked it. Last time we went, we both got \"small\" starter salads. Word to the wise, those things are not small by any means and you will probably be too stuffed to eat your dinner if you try to finish one. Especially skip that salad if you're a bread lover, they bring you a nice little basket of fresh honey wheat and sourdough rolls and they are both delicious. I haven't gotten myself any dessert yet as I'm always so full from dinner, but I think that's a crying shame. That dessert case they have... just walking by it is like a form of torture.

Oh, and it gets better he's been there 8+ years or something absurd. Anyway, I'd say skip it, save your money and go eat somewhere worthwhile like Matt the Millers or Z Cucina."], ["Michael U.", "Went here with my mother, aunt, and sister for a quick lunch on my Aunt's birthday. \u00a0A mild Saturday in mid-April, this was my only weekend off during the laborious intern year stint in the ICU. Although I feel a bit generous with my 4 star review, I feel bad giving the restaurant only three stars; yelp needs half-stars for sure as this would be a 3.5.To begin, with a name like Spagio it seems as though the idea of Spago may have had some influence on the Italian/Pac-Rim fusion menu and as options were available for both brunch and lunch (spagio.com/spagio/lunch.\u2026) the menu was all over the place. \u00a0 \u00a0As we already had dinner reservations planned at the Worthington Inn for dinner, we settled on a soup, bread, and two Pizzas for the four of us. \u00a0Great choices all around.The bread was crusty and refilled without additional requests, but not overly exciting; just what you want in an Italian Sourdough.The lobster bisque, a must for me at any restaurant with it on the menu, was actually one of the best I've had. \u00a0Somewhat spicy, not overly buttery, with a hint of chives and chunks of whole lobster. \u00a0While not as spectacular as the option once available at the now departed Fisherman's Wharf, it was certainly far above average.The Pizzas were hit and miss; one hit, one miss. \u00a0My mother and Aunt settled on the Tomato Basil Pizza w/ extra virgin olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. \u00a0While good, the the cheese was a bit overpowering and the tomatoes not quite in season. \u00a0A little more basil or perhaps some oregano likely would have helped. \u00a0The wheat crust was perhaps a poor idea in this dish, but for my money, I'd recommend Marcella's version instead.My sister and I opted for more adventure and were generously rewarded with the Brie Pizza w/ sweet apple butter, French brie cheese, pears, and candied walnuts. \u00a0Somewhat salty, somewhat sweet, and entirely delicious. \u00a0The sweet and nutty flavour of the walnuts contrasted perfectly with the creamy and sublime brie while the applebutter and pears provided just the right amount of texture and tart. \u00a0I'm not really sure if this was the best dessert pizza I've ever tasted or the most unique tasting \"normal\" pizza I've ever had, but either way I'd recommend it strongly.While the dessert case looked marvelous, we'd already purchased a beautiful cake for my aunt's birthday and weren't feeling entirely gluttonous with reservations already made for later in the day.Service was prompt and pleasant and the coffee service was wonderful. \u00a0Seating was comfortable and the artwork, while kitchy, was tasteful and clever. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the funky pig cutting through the wall and the interesting option to hang Dale Chihuly's dirty napkin in a glass case.While certainly not 'fine dining,' I'd definititely head back for some pizza, coffee, or dessert and i'd love to taste Mediterranean Pasta or Croissant French Toast."], ["Tracy S.", "Disappointing customer service...would not make any arrangements to seat 8 outside...or help come up with any alternative options even when no one was outside at 4pm....greeter was rude...."], ["Mike K.", "I've had 3 meals here: a dinner and two brunches. \u00a0Dinner was chilean sea bass and polenta which was good but not memorable. \u00a0I honestly can't say that much about it. \u00a0We also had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc which was pretty good but not memorable.The brunches on the other hand, were fantastic. \u00a0Both times I got the New Yorker which has a hearty serving of lox, potato pancakes, scrambled eggs and some type of shredded salad in vinegar. \u00a0There's also a dollop of yogurt. \u00a0The lox is the centerpiece of this meal and it was delicious. \u00a0I think this runs about $13 which is a great value. \u00a0The coffee is also very good. \u00a0I think this is my go to brunch place on the weekends. \u00a0It's never crowded and Grandview Cafe is across the street for some NFL Sunday Ticket afterwards."], ["SE W.", "We had reservations for 6 on a Saturday night and were seated right away. Service was VERY slow. Every aspect of it. I never got my second glass of wine. All courses of food took forever. The check took forever. Food was okay, not worth it."], ["Catherine J.", "I happened to end up here twice within the last week, after not having been for a looong time.First of all, I really appreciate any place with a rotating seasonal menu and events. You will find both at Spagio. There's something for everyone on the menu-- the selection is perfectly eclectic without being overwhelming. Visit #1 : Weekday, a little after 7pm. I sat in the bar to meet a friend who never showed (sad, I know). The service was a little slow and inattentive, but I will chalk this up to the fact that I told them I was meeting a friend...they were probably waiting for my friend to arrive. I got the flambe tart from the appetizer menu. It was delish, but more of a portion to share with a dining buddy (which, I was without). I just missed happy hour (7 pm) by a few moments... but I saw some of the items come out. To read about the slider-sized sandwiches on the happy hour menu I wasn't that excited, but they came out looking beautiful and fun to eat. The deals looked pretty good, too! I think beer, wine, and selected cocktails were half price, with a special menu. I still had fun though, I also ordered a dirty martini and happened to have a good read in my purse.Visit #2 : Weekend, lunchtime. There was a brunch menu as well as a normal lunch menu. I was in a bit of a hurry, so I just ordered the chopped salad and the soup of the day (an AMAZING seafood gumbo that makes eating out totally WORTH it). Although I was happy and pleased with my order, I loved watching other people's plates come by. I wished I had more time to try some of the brunch and seasonal selections. The patio was great, it was one of those perfect late-summer/early fall days. Lots of people watching and conversation eavesdropping, too. I also popped in to the Beer and Wine portion of the establishment and found one of my new favorite brews there: Hitachino Nest. The beers are a little pricey, but worth it for the selection. Service was fast, friendly, and not intrusive. Be advised, Spagio is closed on Mondays.I want to go back soon, as if twice in one week weren't enough :)"], ["Matthew S.", "This used to be one of my favorite restaurants to visit in Columbus. \u00a0My last two meals have been extremely underwhelming to borderline bad. \u00a0By far the best item offered is still the lobster bisque, but even that dish is getting over-creamed causing it to be bland. \u00a0Current app of pretzel dumplings is ok, not great. \u00a0Had the prime rib special which was a bad piece of meat, overcooked, and under flavored. \u00a0\"Garlic\" mash was bland. \u00a0Wait staff could tell I was unhappy with my meal and could care less. \u00a0Dined on a business account, so didn't take the effort to complain but if I was spending my own money I would have thrown a little girl fit. \u00a0Probably won't come back, but if I do and get another bad meal then there will be a Mr. Costanza \"airing of grievances\" for sure!"], ["Jaclyn E.", "The only reason I gave Spagio one star is because I didn't have the option of no star. \u00a0I had heard some good things about this place, so when my friend had his birthday dinner there I was excited. \u00a0Unfortunately, the food was horrible...for all 10 of us. \u00a0I ordered the \u00a0gorgonzola pasta with chicken and it was barely edible. \u00a0My friends ordered the \"special\" \u00a0paella and they compared it to cream of wheat. \u00a0Even the pizza was bad. Something good.......... ummm the decor was pretty cool & the server was okay.So, needless to say, I will never be back."], ["Daniel S.", "Last night. The food was not anything special. Last couple of visits the food was hit or miss with more miss aspects. Cheaper ingredients like tiny shrimp on a $14 pizza where Italian place just a walk down the street uses large shrimp for same pizza. \u00a0Crab cake was not good. Service was off perhaps due to waiter shortage but don't seat that many then. How long have you been in business. For the prices and quality go elsewhere."], ["Christiana C.", "Let me tell you a story. \u00a0It'll be short, I promise.Once upon a time, my sister was hosting a bridal shower. \u00a0But what we really wanted was to eat brunch. \u00a0We had a Battle of the Brunch competition to figure out where we should take our out-of-towners. \u00a0Spagio won by a lot. \u00a0Spagio has one of my favorite brunches in the area. \u00a0Their huevos rancheros are way better than I would ever expect of a place not specializing in mexican food to have and their breakfast calzone is my sister's go-to brunch option. \u00a0If you're looking for a great brunch, look no further. \u00a0It's a little high-end, but it's wonderful and pretty worth it."], ["Liz G.", "Spagio serves up some fantastic Modern Italian cuisine right in the heart of Grandview. They have a variety of dishes, some of which are relatively inexpensive, such as the pizzas. Their patio is a great choice on a nice day, especially during the spring and summer when it is lined with flowerboxes. Their best dish isn't especially Italian -- check out their Sunday evening chicken special: a lemon and rosemary-seasoned half-chicken served with vegetables and the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. It lasts me two meals and is affordable at just under $10. They have a gluten free menu if that's a concern. Spagio could make a few improvements, though, namely additional options for glasses of wine, more seasonal selections, and making sure their (free!) rolls are warm when they arrive at the table. However, on the whole, Spagio is worth a trip and is perfect for entertaining out-of-town guests."], ["Allie L.", "Yum yum yum yum yum. I've eaten here twice now and I'll keep coming back. The first time I ate dinner at Spagio was with my husband. We were a bit under dressed (it says casual but there are white tablecloths and most people eating are dressed in nicer jeans, slacks or dresses). I got the lobster ravioli and he ordered a pizza. Both delicious. We also ordered the key lime pie. Also great. Our waiter was helpful and friendly. For alcohol, dinner, dessert and coffee it totaled around $75 with tip. The second and most recent time we visited was with my parents and siblings. My sister and mom have to eat gluten free and they were given a separate menu and both loved what they ordered. Everyone else was extremely happy with their order. If you don't want dessert at Spagio, Jeni's Ice Cream is right next door so it's perfect for us!"], ["Joseph I.", "Wow! Went there for New Years Eve, and again last night for Valentine's day. Amazing food. I had the prime rib last night, and it was spot on. The service was great too. Our server, Doug, was very polite and knowledgeable. Gave us great recommendations for our meals. As busy as it was, he was very attentive, but not obtrusive. Will definitely go back again and again. Thanks!"], ["Doug O.", "My wife and I have started going to Spagio more regularly since my last review because a couple of our friends are regulars at the bar. \u00a0My experiences at the bar have raised my opinion of the place. \u00a0While the drinks are a bit on the expensive side, there is happy hour every day at the bar with half off of the cocktail menu, and that decidedly makes the place worthwhile. \u00a0There is always a list of eight to ten seasonal cocktails. \u00a0They are all strong and they are all delicious, and at half off, they're actually quite a bargain. \u00a0Although the beer list is kind of idiosyncratic, it seems in keeping with the feel of Spagio as a whole. \u00a0What really brings me back is the service at the bar. \u00a0A young fellow named Laz is a fantastic bartender. \u00a0He is friendly and engaging at all times, managing to mix fairly complicated cocktails with the greatest of ease and speed, all while telling an amusing anecdote. \u00a0There's a limited bar menu that applies to happy hour too, so swing by and have a couple cocktails and a light dinner and you'll leave drunk and happy."], ["Jurgen J.", "Spagio is honestly one of the best restaurant in Columbus. I didn't expect a lot from Spagio, but i was really satisfied with the food.The four of us shared the pizza. It was something with pork (porchetta if i remember correctly). The pizza was good. It was flaky, crunchy and quite authentic.I ordered the lobster bisque. The soup was served on top whipped cream. It was delicious. It had a sizable amount of lobster. I was really surprised.i had the lamb chop for the main course, which was decent. It was what you would expect from a nice italian restaurant. I was a bit burned though. From all the entrees that my friends chose, moury favorite was the pork chop (everyone at the table agreed). And out least favorite was the seafood stew. The stew has a lot of potential. I honestly enjoyed it. But the seafood wasn't fresh, which ruined the whole dish.We didn't have any desserts, but we were surprised and satisfied. I would definitely come back here again! One thing that i want to mention, i spent over 50 dollars on food and wine. I don't think Spagio is a $$ restaurant, rather i think it's a $$$."], ["Sabrina G.", "We have eaten here 2 Saturdays in a row, which means we enjoy it (especially considering we live over 2 hours away). \u00a0It is a very nice place in a wonderful neighborhood where people like to eat and stroll around.The service has been great and the food is excellent. \u00a0I had the braised Kobe beef short rib on the first visit and it was one of the most tender pieces of beef I've ever had - it literally fell apart with the fork like pot roast. \u00a0My wife had a pizza, which she really enjoyed. \u00a0And yes, the dessert case is a sight. \u00a0We did partake and I highly recommend the molten chocolate cake.The next visit I had the scallops and she had the special, which was Corvina (AKA white sea bass). \u00a0Both were delicious. \u00a0She also enjoyed a poached pear Sangria. \u00a0We decided this is a place where you can probably order anything on the menu and not be disappointed.They have a diverse menu so everyone should be able to find something to their liking. \u00a0I would highly recommend this place. \u00a0There is no excuse for residents of the Columbus area to patronize Olive Garden or other chain Italian restaurants when this gem is in your backyard. \u00a0It makes us Northerners jealous we don't have a Spagio in our area."], ["Jeremy L.", "4 stars for the atmosphere and friendly staff. Not the best pizza I've had in the area but it was still good. Good spot to go grab a pizza and a glass of wine or a beer. Good conversation with a few of the bartenders."], ["Pete Donna M.", "World-class food and dining. \u00a0Chef Hubert has cooked for the King of Spain, Presidents of the United States (including the current POTUS), and world business leaders. \u00a0You might see Warren Buffet or Eric Clapton dining at Spagio when they are in town. \u00a0For the past 15 years, chefs from across the U.S. and around the world have come to Spagio for 'Dining With The Stars\", an annual fundraiser for Nationwide Children's Hospital. \u00a0Re seasonable prices. \u00a0Reservations definitely needed."], ["Brigid N.", "For lunch my lobster bisque was cold and my quiche was burnt and cold. \u00a0This was after I had about four amazing dinners here. \u00a0Went back and they redeemed themselves. \u00a0Veggie roll was awesome, as was the crab and avocado salad. \u00a0Ive had the scallops previously and those were great as well. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0Desserts looked amazing but I'm always too full to try them!"], ["Kyle J.", "Decided on Spagio for my birthday lunch this past weekend.From the outside Spagio looked a little stuffy and stale. The blinds are always down when I walk by so I've never seen the inside. What a delight to walk in and find so much color everywhere! This place has a lot of personality.We were seated immediately and greeted by our server soon after. My mother and I started with a bottle of wine and our server was sure our glasses were never left wanting.We started with the calamari and a pizza torte with bacon, cheese and onion. Both were a delight. The bacon was crisp and was complimented perfectly by the goat cheese. The calamari is some of the best I have ever had, not too breaded, tender and had a slight orange tang to it.For our meal I had the gorgonzola pasta with tomatoes and broccoli. I can't even begin to say how delicious it was. The tomatoes were plump and juicy. The broccoli was cooked and crisp. The sauce was spicy and creamy. I've had dreams about it since then.I was surprised and delighted by how wonderful Spagio was. I would definitely return here for a date or work party."], ["Megan D.", "It was a beautiful summer Columbus day the first time I went to Spagio. I got a prime seat on a great patio and the server was even so kind as to let my (small) dog sit with me outside as I enjoyed lunch and brought out a bowl of water for her. I was so excited to see Spaetzle on a lunch menu outside of Germany! It was buttery and cheesy and delicious, just as I hoped. Very very tasty food! I can't wait to come back again sometime for a full dinner and to peruse the drink menu."], ["Sarah T.", "I love it here! It's nice enough for birthday, celebrations, etc and yet casual enough for brunch. The dessert case practically sells itself."], ["Hank's Dad R.", "This is fine dining.The location is a crowded area, seemingly many nice resturaunts in this same area. \u00a0They do had vallet parking.The inside is beautiful, a delightful atmosphere to eat in. \u00a0The room layout is unique, apparently the building has been added onto multiple times, but they've made it work very well. \u00a0Beware walking by the dessert case though (even I was tempted to get something and I haven't gotten a dessert like this in several years).All four of us loved our entree's. \u00a0Mine was the days special, swordfish with a vegetable salad. \u00a0The swordfish was excellent, and of a good size too, with a citrus butter sauce which added to it well. \u00a0The vegetable salad was root vegetables, topped with pickled asparagus. \u00a0The salad hadn't sounded that appetizing to me, but I loved it. \u00a0The wife had the Crab & Avocado Salad, which she said was equisite. \u00a0For her her entree, she had the Shrimp, Lobster & Jumbo Lump Crab Cake appetizer. \u00a0That I tried and can vouch for how good it was.All three of them ordered a dessert. \u00a0He got a molten chocolate one and seemed to rave the most of the three of them.Our server was charming, helpful, and very attentive. \u00a0We couldn't have asked for better service.We'll certainly be back."], ["Richard B.", "I avoided Spagio for a long time and I'm not really sure why. \u00a0It seemed like a place I would enjoy and had a pretty good reputation. \u00a0My one and only trip though here was really underwhelming. \u00a0Everything about it feels dated. \u00a0Like mid-1990s dated. \u00a0I had the meatloaf and it was pretty much the definition of \"meh.\" \u00a0Quite a few better meatloafs around town. \u00a0I probably should give it another try, but I'm in no rush. \u00a0Great location, but I'd go to Third and Hollywood across the street 99 out of 100 times."], ["Sally Q.", "I went to Spagio last night for my friend's birthday dinner. There were 8 of us. Granted we waited 1 hr for the 8th person to arrive before ordering, but then when we ordered at 9pm it took an hour or more to get our food. The service was terrible. Our waitress was horrible, I think her name is Amber but we kept calling her Deb b/c she looked and acted like Deb from Napoleon Dynamite. We had to ask for everything we needed. Often had to ask twice for a refill before getting one. I ordered a brazillian dessert and when I cut into it, it did not cut b/c there was plastic still wrapped around it, with chocolate put on top of the plastic! The waitress commented, \"well I didn't make that dessert.\" \u00a0I ordered a creme brulee instead and the raspberry on top had mold all over it. I told the waitress and she said \"that's a leaf that not mold.\" I was very annoyed to hear her say b/c she did not even look at the raspberry before opening her mouth. She took the raspberry itself back to the kitchen then came back apologized and said \"it was what you said it was\". I said \"what? mold?\" Yes! Mold. \u00a0She told us all that our desserts would be free for the 3 of us who ordered desserts, then still charged the other 2 for their desserts. They didn't mind b/c their desserts were not messed up but she should just keep her mouth shut.What horrible customer service to be given lip every time you said something to the waitress, and there were lots of times b/c she kept messing everything up! My friend ordered 2 appetizers as dinner and told the waitress this yet the waitress brought out the calamari with appetizers and forced her to take it then, and brought out the au grauten potatoes with dinner, so her dinner was just a plate of potatoes by itself. \u00a0The food itself was good but beware if you get a salad you get the whole plant and have to cut it up yourself with a butter knife. \u00a0That's kind of difficult and comical. All 8 of us said we would never come back here again."]]}
