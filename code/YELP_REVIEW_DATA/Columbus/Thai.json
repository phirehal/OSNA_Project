Will be returning."], ["Whitney H.", "I was really disappointed because it's not all Thai - it's more of an Asian fusion restaurant. I took my friends here and none of them really liked their food or the price they had to pay for the dishes. I unfortunately have to agree.

My guy and I have been dying to come here for forever and after getting myself a nice little job promotion we decided it would be the perfect time to go and celebrate.The space is smaller than I thought it was but so warm and unpretentious, but I'm definitely glad we came early on a weeknight. We were seated at a comfortable corner booth against the wall and next to the window of the bar (which is great for me because I'm a big people watcher). Our server was a little shy but made good recommendations and was extremely friendly and prompt. The guy and I each got a drink, started with the fresh spring rolls (my favorite), then I chose the Ka Prow Ped (a duck stir fry) and I was so impressed I don't even remember what my boyfriend had for dinner. It was easy and totally worth the small bill of $50. It was everything I expected it to be and more. I can't wait to come back!"], ["Katie B.", "Start with the spring rolls! So delish. I could eat the pineapple fried rice everyday. Good service too! A cute and trendy restaurant for a quiet meal."], ["Claude S.", "On the off chance of discovering a new restaurant, we found this place tucked close on High Street. Overall the food was terrific, we began with appetizers of Thai Fresh Spring Rolls & Chicken Satay both items were excellent and will try them again. On our main course we had the Gang Dang with the red curry sauce and having it medium spicy was the perfect choice and the Pad Phong Karee which perfect spiced as well and quite flavorful with the soft shell crab and yellow curry. I really don't understand some of the comments about this place, the price is comparable to many Thai restaurants I've been to and in some cases considerably less. The food is pretty authentic, I'm not quite sure what the expectation is from some but ordering cheap Thai food in a Chinese restaurant shouldn't be your benchmark. Thai food can be quite spicy, the rule of thumb is ask your server to dictate a numerical value with 1 being close to \"Milk Toast\" and 10 being the \"Sun\". If you order 1 and its still too spicy than send it back, no need to ruin your meal with an over zealous chef with a heavy hand."], ["vadim d.", "It was a place I liked until tonight. It was two of us and the guy who was responsible for the guests denied to give us a table that we wanted. The place was half full so it was quite unreasonable for the restaurant to have such unfriendly attitude. Nida's was a place we visited frequently - not anymore. Nida's, You just lost a good customer. May, 29, 7 pm. Talk to your greeter and kick his ass."], ["Rebecca H.", "There was nothing about this place I didn't like. The place is cute, huge windows in the front they open in the summer and very friendly service.The Pad Thai was out of this world and everyone at the table loved their food. Better than any of the Thai places I've been to in Madison, WI."], ["Liz M.", "Having worked next to a Thai restaurant for 7 years, I never really had the need to seek out thai food. Now, having moved, I wanted to try Nida's. We met some friends for happy hour. Their happy hour specials are decent. Discounted apps and drinks. I really enjoyed the Thai Iced tea (not on special). Our waitress was nice and explained things as needed. I ordered my favorite Tom Kah Gai soup. The guys ordered sushi and my friend got a curry and we got some apps. The sushi was fine, the edamame was fine, the spring rolls, were fine. The Tom Kah Gai was lame. It was very thin broth, barley any veggies, and not much galanga or lemongrass flavor. It was very delecate comapred to what I am used to. So, therefore, I was disappointed. Plus it was $7.50 (or something like that) and I just didn't think it measured up. In the end everything was OK, but I'll just go back to Nong's for my Tom Kah."], ["Sean S.", "I'll start by saying I like Nida's. I really do. The problem is......well......there really IS no problem, but having said that, there really is nothing extraordinary about the experience here either. It's pretty \"middle-of-the-road\". It's been a while since I had been to Nida's, so I suggested going last night. The Gyoza (pork dumplings) were very good and cooked properly. (You might be surprised how many Asian restaurants I've been to in Columbus that serve overcooked, rubbery dumplings. It was refreshing to get some at Nida's that were soft and well-seasoned.) The only down side to these was that I wished there were a couple more on the plate. After having the dumplings we shared a sushi roll called \"The Heart Attack\", which was an Americanized deep-fried sushi roll with spicy tuna and jalape\u00f1o. While not authentically Japanese, it was delicious. For my entree I chose the Chu Chee Duck, which is grilled duck in a coconut milk red curry sauce with bell peppers, crispy basil leaves and white rice. Before I go on to point out the negatives I should mention that you could put coconut curry on a rubber tire and I'd probably eat it. Oh, I will indulge......but I digress. The flavor of the duck and curry was delicious. My problem was that there wasn't enough duck due to the amount of cartilage and bones that were in the meat. I wound up spitting most of the bites of meat out due to the pieces that were inedible. My other issue was with the level of heat I requested. When asked how hot I wanted the curry I specified \"medium\", but there was almost no heat whatsoever. The person I was with specified that he wanted his curry hot, but he said that the coconut milk's sweetness overpowered any heat that may have been added to the dish. While we were both a bit disappointed with this, it wasn't enough to make it a bad experience.Nida's is a bit on the cramped side. If you go on a Tuesday or Wednesday between 7 and 8:30 you're bound to get a table quickly. We went on a Friday night at 7pm and we waited about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad, but since all of the seats at the bar were taken we decided to get a text message when our table was ready and walk around the Short North. If you're looking for Thai food with a nicer, less-cramped, cozy atmosphere try Basil which is just a couple blocks north of Nida's. Both have good food, but neither is extraordinary."], ["Dublin B.", "I bit pricey but the sushi was good quality. \u00a0If you're in the area it's worth it."], ["Emily D.", "Just had my first experience here and it was delicious!! \u00a0Happy hour means $2 off wine, which helps convince you to get something that will pair well. \u00a0Had a vegetarian dish and the tofu was perfect. The meals are beautifully presented and the ambiance is a good mix of fancy and casual. It really was exactly what I was looking for in a birthday dinner."], ["Al H.", "This is truly a case where I wish Yelp had half stars because I think Nida's sits at a solid 3.5Let me start with the food and service because both are excellent. The place is fairly small but they have plenty of servers for the space and our experience was generally really good. On my recent trip I ordered the sriacha fried rice and again it was excellent! Everyone loved what they ordered so it went great. Normally those two things are enough to earn 4 stars but there are some oddities that irk me about Nidas:1. Only 1 free refill on drinks (what the hell is that?) and no refills on Thai coffee or tea.2. Gratuity added to parties of 5 or more, sort of a weird number to be locked into if the service isn't great3. $17 for fried rice with 2 meats, now I know this place is a little higher-end but at a place like Tais Asian Bistro you could get a double portion of combo fried rice for under $10 and the quality is very similar. I generally felt that the prices were a bit too high for what you were getting.But I digress, Nida's is still a great spot to grab dinner with friends."], ["Bryant M.", "Want good Thai in Columbus? Then Nida's is your place!A friend and I showed up for dinner on a Saturday night, and although they were busy, we were able to find seating at the bar. The bartender was super-attentive and extremely friendly. Our drinks were strong and delicious, but I found myself still wanting to run down the street to Mouton.My friend got sushi (Spicy Thai and Heart Attack), and here are her thoughts:\"It tasted fresh, and filled me up without being heavy. The Heart Attack had fresh jalapenos that made a ton of difference. In the Spicy Thai, the spicy mayo was good, and the whole roll had a good blend of flavors. 3.5 stars.\"I had Pad Thai, and this was definitely the best I've had in Columbus.

The server was helpful with every question we asked -- giving us a \"probably\" answer, going into the back to make sure, returning with a \"yup, right the first time\" confirmation.I don't remember what everyone ordered, but it was a huge variety -- from animal-free to carnivorous -- and no one had a complaint. I know that for my part, I ordered a sushi appetizer and a Thai tofu curry for my entree. I know that the sushi hit the spot and the curry hit even more of them. I know that we passed around glasses with interesting-sounding drinks that didn't taste nearly as strong as they felt.

Word to the wise, prices have gone up on some entrees by a dollar. I got the tofu pad Thai, and the boyfriend got the crispy pork. We ordered the chicken satay as an app, but due to a mix up, they gave us chicken pad Thai instead. The crispy pork was a bit of a joke. There was nothing crisp about it, and it was dry from what appeared to be over cooking. Not very much in the container as well. The side of rice didn't fill up the standard Chinese style takeout container; it came to about the halfway mark. It truly tasted like something we could have made at home - all for $16. The tofu pad Thai was better, but if this was the first time having tried tofu, I'd have been turned off of it for good. The tofu actually was burnt on some of the edges - pretty amazing. It was tough to chew. The sauce used was alright, but on the sweet side, which I thought was unusual. The portion size was good. The price was reasonable at $12. I also got a Thai iced tea, which was pretty flipping tasty. That was the best purchase that we made at $3. We didn't try the chicken pad Thai - boyfriend tried a piece of the chicken and was singularly unimpressed. He reported that it was so over cooked that it was sticking to his teeth. All in all, a disappointment. Maybe it was an off night for the restaurant? I don't know that we'll try it again, simply for the fact that it totaled up to $45. That's pretty expensive for another test run. So far, the best Thai we've had in Columbus has been down at the North Market. Maybe you'll have a different experience!"], ["Tna M.", "Wanted to go for a long while due to the vegan accommodation. Big time disappointment. \u00a0Amazingly overpriced.

After reading the Yelp reviews (and seeing the pictures...eek!), I was a little nervous. But they also seemed to be the only delivery Chinese near my location with at least a few positive reviews, and I was craving dumplings, so I took the risk.I ordered the edamame, the pork pan friend dumplings, and a veggie roll. My total came to be about $10.50, right above the delivery minimum of $10. They also have a $2 delivery charge.The edamame was delicious (though I'll admit it is hard to mess that up). The serving was large and the edamame was cooked to perfection. It tasted great dipping it in the red chili pepper sauce for the dumplings as well. The veggie role was a little disappointing. It was small and smashed from delivery. The flavor was good, but the spring roll wrapper was definitely overcooked and practically fell apart when I bit into it. Finally, the dumplings. I am a huge dumpling fan. The ones I ordered from Taste of Orient were standard, probably very similar to something you could get in the freezer section at the grocery, but the added red chili sauce to dip in spiced them up a bit. The only con was that the dumplings stored at the bottom of the container ended up being slightly soggy when I got to them. Not the biggest deal, but it is definitely not how I prefer to eat my dumplings.Overall, delivery was easy and quick (about 30 minutes). When I placed my order with Yelp, it didn't give an expected time, but I was surprised at how quickly it arrived (I was expecting an hour or so given other Yelp reviews).If you are looking for some quick and easy Chinese to fill a craving in the OSU area, check this place out.

We ordered from here once and it showed up 45 minutes later than when it was supposed to. Opened up my lukewarm container of Pad Thai, which had been drowned in regular soy sauce.

The portion size was huge and was enough for 2 meals. My boyfriend had the pad Thai and he just thought his dish was ok. One of the reasons I can't give more stars was because I ordered a combination(chicken, shrimp, and beef) and when we got home, my order just had chicken in it, but I was charged for the combination on my receipt.

Never disappointed with my meal here. Super speedy delivery too. Awesome place, awesome food"], ["Carol C.", "This is the kind of restaurant that's more than really tasty Chinese take-out. In fact, it's really tasty Chinese, Japanese, Thai, AND Vietnamese take-out! The fare may not be absolutely authentic, and the word \"Orient\" may cause your more politically correct acquaintances to cringe, but any place that offers up your choice of four kinds of Asian cuisine is an uncommon find. Factor in the substantial serving sizes, overall quality, and bottom-barrel price points, and it becomes completely unique.My experience with Taste of Orient is entirely delivery-based, and began (like so many love affairs) the morning following a night of drunken debauchery. The craving for steamy, starchy foods was intense, but I knew I needed vitamin-packed vegetables to truly soothe my belly-beast. The answer? Vegetable Delight. Big branches of broccoli, sliced water chestnuts, crunchy baby corn, and mandolin-cut zucchini with a pretty zig-zag edge, all sauteed in a thick brown sauce that's more sweet than salty. Served with your choice of steamed or fried rice, it's balanced and filling without being bulky.But my favorite so far must be the Vegetable Lo Mein. It's an absurd amount of noodles, more than enough entree for two, so tightly packed that chopsticks don't stand a chance. Some people would disdain such a carbohydrate creation, calling it an unruly nest of soy sauce-shrouded starch, I say pass me a fork and make room for seconds. It's the best tasting Lo Mein I've ever had, a pasta so savory and salty I don't even mind that the veggies are an inconspicuous afterthought. Speaking of the best, you've gotta try the Egg-Rolls. Almost all of the appetizers are delicious, especially the crispy-creamy Crab Rangoon and assorted soups, but the Egg-Rolls are practically perfection. Savory, steamy, well-spiced fillings wrapped in a decadently flaky, crunchy crust - order extras, you WILL want seconds.I haven't explored the many Thai or Vietnamese menu options yet, but I get the impression that there isn't much room for failure. Every entree I've sampled has landed in the good-to-great zone, and the value per dollar is virtually double thanks to the epic portion sizes and leftover-friendly packaging. \"Order Once, Eat Twice!\" - that's my submission for Taste of Orient's unofficial slogan."], ["Kendell M.", "Really enjoy Taste of Orient. \u00a0They deliver which is the best part and it's usually fast. \u00a0I've ordered from here several times and usually get the Mongolian Beef with lo mein and the Hot and Sour soup (comes with egg roll). \u00a0It is always hot on arrival and they give you a lot of food. \u00a0Very cheap but delivery charge is $10 minimum.

Their food is always fast and the prices are definitely comparable to your common chinese places. The reason I like ToO is because I consistently enjoy every item I order at this place. Some chinese places have okay wonton but gross general tsos, or great crab rangoon but crappy lo mein. But I have found that this place has enjoyable versions of all of my favorites. I have tried a lot of their menu but my favorites are the wonton soup, the crab rangoon, and the pad thai [ask for nonspicy]. They have huge portions which I love, and they are always timely and friendly. I feel like Columbus has a sadly small amount of Chinese places, but I would definitely recommend giving Taste of Orient a try!I wanted to also say that, I'm not exactly sure why I gave this place four stars instead of five. It might be because it's so far away from my house now so I rarely get a chance to order it. They unfortunately don't deliver to my area :( :(.

Moral of the story- - - - -Taste of Orient does have good food, however, as a vegetarian of 12 years, I am disappointed to find out that they are labeling NON- vegetarian items as vegetarian. I have come to learn that this is common among asian restaurants. If there are no visible pieces of meat, it goes under the vegetarian section of the menu, (when it is usually not vegetarian at all).

You cant beat it! \u00a0(Even though other restraunts outside of downtown usually give larger portion sizes)."], ["Steve G.", "Pros: .....umm I guess location would be why I've come here twice now.

I frequent this place for Thai Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken etc. It really is middle of the road but it does quench my craving for Chinese food. I would consider a better alternative but Mr. Lee's in the Commons/Mall area is definitely not that better alternative."], ["Catherine J.", "I was torn between a 1 and 2 star review, mostly because of the \"Eek!\" in the \"Eek! Methinks not!\" portion. \u00a0But, the food didn't kill me, so I guess there's that.This place legit freaked me out.I was staying late for work and wanted something warm-- something not a salad or a sandwich. I also didn't want to walk too far away. I remembered walking past Ho Toy on several occasions to other establishments, so I decided to try it, as it was just across the street.Before I ordered, I knew three things: (1) It's in a prime location, (2) I remember seeing this place ever since my family moved to Columbus in 1990 and (2) I've never heard of anyone going there, ever. Uhhh.... red flag?I ordered on the phone so I wouldn't have to wait. I used Yelp, read the reviews and I figured it would at least just be standard American Chinese. Because I was already a tad sketched out, I ordered a vegetarian dish. I'm glad I did, because when I walked in to pick up my order, the place reeked. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned since maybe before 1990. It was dark, dank, and stank.There were also these weird flower pots for sale all around, just as another yelper pointed out. They look like they'd been there since 1972, and came in all sizes-- miniature to large. What is going on here?The people who work there seem sweet enough, if a bit eccentric. The lady who took my order via the phone was super polite, though she sounded super stressed and busy when I called-- even asking me to hold (which I don't mind). However, this confuses me, because when I went in there for pickup, the place was completely dead. There was an older asian woman working the (empty) dining room when I walked in. If I have any reviewer-guilt, it's because these people seem so nice. But it's within their power to be better, you know? Clean the place up a little bit? Make a few changes to re-energize the business? I don't know if they don't care or don't realize what is really going on from the customer's view.I ordered the Vegetable Chow Mein, which was sort of a good and bad thing. Stupid, American me was thinking LO mein, not the chow mein. As soon as I opened my styrofoam carton, I saw where I went wrong-- but this dish is a little weird. There were veggies in a light sauce on one side, and then handfuls of fried noodles (seemed like the canned kind you can get at the grocery store) on the other. It was my ordering misstep, and it was fine, I guess. At least I ate fewer calories than slurping up wet, bendy, sauce-laden noodles... I mostly ignored the crispy things. Considering the crispy noodles were likely pre-purchased and there weren't a lot of veggies, I'd say this dish was a little on the expensive side at $6. I also got an egg roll for $1.25. It was okay.Picking up my order was equally weird. They didn't seem to have a system for carryout. The older asian woman didn't seem to speak English, but she directed me to a counter in the back, where I waited for a while for the woman from the phone to come out from the kitchen. Turns out my bag of food was already sitting on the counter, and Phone/Cook Lady just handed me the bag and told me to go back to the front of the store (where I was originally standing), and told the Old Lady the price of my order about 3 times, very slowly and loudly. I think Old Lady is deaf, because she just grabbed the ticket off the bag to see the price-- and we walked back up to the front. It just seemed like a lot of needless shuffling around and they weren't used to carryout orders. The place smelled so bad and was so dirty that I really don't think I could have stomached eating inside.I'm just really confused. This would probably be a good location for a really trippy indie movie about quirky, adorable, depressed people in quirky, depressed situations. Or at least a Rob Zombie movie. Yikes!"], ["David Z.", "\"Scary\" is the first word that I would use to describe a trip to Ho-Toy on a cold winter night, with \"disturbing\" being a close second. \u00a0Everything in this place has a stale feeling, and yes, that most definitely includes the food.I was craving Asian, but didn't want to walk or taxi up to Short North one night, and so I decided to eat something downtown. As I walked up to the restaurant, and debated internally with myself whether I wanted to find out if they were actually open or not, I decided to just give the door a chance, and, to my slight surprise, it actually opened. \u00a0When I walked in, I found a dark and empty dining room with no one inside, and a lone waitress walking from the back to seat me and provide me with a menu. The food is generic enough, so I tried a chicken and mixed vegetable dish.The chicken had a tough and chewy texture, like they had once been frozen for too long, and then left out to thaw for too long, while the sauce was heavy and flavorless at the same time. \u00a0The mixed vegetables actually weren't too bad, but honestly, I was just hoping not to catch salmonella.As I ate my food, the waitress then proceeded to mop the dining room, at least an hour before they closed. \u00a0Something tells me that they don't expect too many customers at night. So unless you like scary and disturbing food experiences, Ho-Toy is definitely a place to avoid."], ["Brian W.", "We continue to search for a good downtown Chinese take-out option since we moved to downtown Cbus a few months ago. \u00a0Ho-Toy is better than some, but I agree with other reviews, the place is a bit strange. First and foremost, I need to give them props for staying open until 7:00 on weeknights (providing me with a take-out dinner option near home), although it didn't seem justified based on my visit on a Friday night. \u00a0Second the food was okay, with no safety issues we could tell.That all said, we really wonder when you go in this place if they are actually still in business. \u00a0The decor is way worn and dated. \u00a0A single CFL bulb hangs nakedly over the bar, while the adjacent idle hanging fixtures sport outlet adapters (for plugging in what?).

I must have been the dumbest child in Columbus.Let me preface this review by telling you dirty, unkempt restaurants don't freak me out. I've had fantastic meals in some terribly seedy establishments. Ho-Toy falls into the category of dingy restaurants, and unfortunately, their food matches the ambiance.First up: the egg roll. Before it came out, two maple syrup-style pitchers of hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce were placed before me. The pitchers looked in need of a good wipe down and made me wonder about the age and freshness of their contents.The egg roll comes out and it looks perfect. A perfect, sickly yellow that is. I bite in, and I will bet you anything Ho-Toy doesn't make their own egg rolls. Reason: I was only one of three people in the restaurant. When you get a fresh egg roll right out of the fryer, they are tongue-burningly hot. This one was warm enough to have been microwaved, but my tongue went unscathed. Also, the taste was familiar. Reminded me of the frozen egg rolls I used to buy as a poor, lazy college student.Next up: The Orange Chicken. Or should I say weird looking chicken pieces with a brown, tangy gravy. Let's say that term one more time: Brown, tangy gravy. We've now stumbled onto the least appetizing combination of words in the English language.Pretty sure the chicken came out of frozen food box. The vegetables and rice tasted fine, except that they were covered in, let's say it together, a brown, tangy gravy. (Shudder)In summary, the highlights of my meal were the can of Coca-cola and the fortune cookie. So if you love those two things, Ho-Toy is your jam. If not, go somewhere else or go buy some Kahiki frozen meals. You'll be glad you did."], ["Raymond S.", "Its your typical quick and cheap chinese joint. Nice for those that work around the state house to grab a quick hot meal. Decent amount of food for the price, I wouldnt mind goin back if i needed too."], ["Nick L.", "Ho-Toy isn't your normal Chinese restaurant. They don't actually have any of your 'standard' fried-chicken-tossed-in-a-sauce dishes like sesame chicken, but they do have General Tso's chicken and Orange Chicken, both of which I don't recommend.What they do have is good wor sue gai. The egg rolls (pork) are crisply fried to a golden color, and are almost always perfect. Moo goo gai pan isn't great. My dining partners give five stars to the chicken chow mein here, so if you like the dish, come here for that.I've come to this place several times before for lunch, since it's downtown. Parking spaces can usually be found on the metered spots on State Street or a couple of blocks away.Service is brisk and the dishes are brought out with metal covers on them, but the food is prepared pretty quickly.I didn't sample any of the soups this time, but the egg drop soup here is decent. The amount of food given is pretty decent for the price - but the Chinese is oftentimes bland to me. If you order some of the Thai dishes, you'll get a spicier kick.On this visit, I tried the Phad Pedt with shrimp. It was perfectly balanced between being too bland and too spicy. Had a nice tangy kick to it - basically somewhat like a spicy Moo Goo Gai Pan and the shrimp was nicely cooked with the tails on, which I like.In short, if you need somewhere to go for a solid lunch, give Ho-Toy some consideration. Don't expect fireworks, but they serve hot, fresh, reliable, and relatively cheap food."], ["Tom R.", "Now I understand the reviews of this place based on the d\u00e9cor that ranks somewhere between run-down and post-apocalyptic.

It was 12:45 so not too late for the lunch crowd. \u00a0I ordered chicken fried rice but switched it for my boss's General Tso's because it looked better. I think that may have been a mistake - the General Tso's was about 4 pieces of chicken (I don't think it was all white meat) in a sauce with some vegetables. Nothing special. \u00a0The fried rice didn't have any mix-ins. \u00a0Overall I'd say my meal was bland.

They use carrot and chinese broccoli in theirs, which I am not a fan of. I love the fresh broccoli to give it a little texture. The sauce used did not taste like the traditional Pad See Ew sauce that I have had time and time again. The dish was dark brown and very bland.The wonton soup portion was great, but the soup itself was flavorless.

One coworker had the pad Thai with shrimp and she let us try and it was really delicious, Don't eat issue with the dish was that the shrimp seem to be those pre-cooked shrimp and they were really rubbery and not very appetizing. So I'll recommend to anyone ordering from here to not order shrimp as the meat for their dish.

I've only lived in Columbus for about a month and Thai Basils is one the few restaurants that has already made it into my regular take-out rotation.

I usually get that and an order of Thai Spring Rolls. The portions are HUGE. Literally twice the size of Nida's for two-thirds of the price. When asking about Thai in Columbus, the almost universal response is Nida's. I like Nida's too, but the pad thai at Thai Basils is simply better. I've tried their drunken noodles aka pad kee mao, which is another good dish if you like a little spice. The service is friendly and food comes out fast.

They include everything you need for your personal pho party for one--sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime, jalape\u00f1os, chopsticks, etc. I'm no pho king, but I thought it was pretty darn tasty! The broth was rich and delicious, and the add-ins were fresh and plentiful.

I've also had some of their curry dishes, mainly the red curry, and I would recommend getting that for sure (with beef!). I do wish they could make things a bit hotter, because I'm a fiend for spice!As far as other items on the menu go, I can't say that the smaller dishes like the egg rolls or crab rangoon have really blown my mind, but they're tasty enough for a quick meal on the go. You can call ahead, but you'd better have a menu on hand or know the menu by heart, because they don't have a website, and every time I've gone in, they've been out of menus.

The shrimp pad thai is wonderful with a light sauce that doesn't overpower the subtle flavors of lime and peanut. Large portion size left enough for me to have a nice light lunch the next day. My only complaint with it would be the amount of shrimp (5 pieces) given the portion size. Understandable though given that it's under $8 for a huge portion of yummy noodle goodness. I also had the shrimp Tom Yum soup. It lacked shrimp as well and at almost the same price as my pad thai, I found that disappointing. Wonderful flavor with enough spice to make my nose run, which I quite enjoy in the winter months that wreak havoc on my sinuses. I would absolutely order the Tom Yum soup again, though I'd 86 the shrimp and save myself a bit of money. It's not worth the extra few dollars for three pieces of shrimp.

This was the place that started it all: my love affair with Thai food. What can I say?First of all, if you consider yourself a spice champion, able to take on any flavors the chef can bring to the table, you've got to eat here. My mom, sister and I tried many Thai places all over Columbus, always ordering \"four stars\" or \"extra spicy,\" always haughtily chomping down the dishes, never quite spicy enough. THEN we tried Thai Orchid. \"Extra spicy, please\"\"Extra spicy? You sure?\"\"Yup, bring it on\"BIG mistake. We couldn't eat enough rice to alleviate the heat, our eyes watering and nose running from all the spice that was added. We were home. My recommendation: \u00a0Panang Curry with Chicken (Panang Gai)! The best I've had anywhere. And I've been to Thailand. The Evil Jungle Prince is also really good, and my Mom always orders this amazing fish entree I can't remember the name of. Try something new here, it will be amazing! They are very generous with the rice-- almost too generous. They have \"rice boys\" (as I call them) walking around with big pots, filling up anyone's plate who seems the slightest bit low on rice.

We wanted some thai carry out and so we decided to try Thai Orchid. We ordered Pad see ew, general tso's chicken and the vegetable curry. All were just ok. The general tso's chicken was thin pieces of over cooked chicken. Really chewy, in fact I had to spit one out after I had chewed it for awhile and was making no progress. I even asked for all white meat and this is what they came up with. The Pad see ew was super bland, nothing to talk about. The vegetable curry was ok. Good vegetables in it, and once I had eaten those I tossed the rest. We ordered enough to have leftovers and there was plenty left, however, I have no desire to do this meal again so we threw the rest out. Won't be going to this place again. If you want good thai food, go to Nida's Thai in the Short North. For us, it is well worth the drive."], ["Terri R.", "My husband and I discovered this place about a year ago and we've been back about 4-5 times. The food is excellent. I've had the Thai chicken cashew, which is a bit spicy (just right for my taste). Its flavor is refreshingly different than your typical chinese restaurant-style cashew chicken; \u00a0the chicken is very thinly sliced and very tender. I also ventured in trying something called Panang Gai - you can get it with chicken, pork or beef; I got the chicken. At first, when they brought it out - it's served in a bowl because it's kinda soupy; it looked like a very small portion. But actually, once served over rice, it's actually a lot of food, and I had plenty to take home for my lunch the next day. But anyway, this was surprisingly very tasty and different than anything I've tasted - a bit spicy with curry and coconut milk and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts on top. Very good! One time, I ordered \u00a0Phad Key Mow, and it was way too spicy hot for me. I told them about it, they made a whole new dish for me without the heat, so they were very kind about that (even tho the menu states it's a hot dish, \u00a0so I should have asked for it to be mild in the first place). Also, this is a very quiet restaurant, so \u00a0it's a great place to have a nice conversation."], ["Ted D.", "All diners can be ordered to your specification and the service is always uber friendly.

I mean, I live so close I could walk here.Intimidation perhaps? Maybe some nervousness thrown in there?I don't know, but I finally took a chance and checked this place out.We stopped by on a very slow Sunday afternoon. There was nobody else in the place, other than the a lady restocking some produce, and the other workers. We took a sharp right upon entrance and made it back to the food counter where an older gentleman didn't really greet us. I believe he was more enthralled with the rerun of MASH on his TV, but it's cool. We weren't in a hurry and it gave us some time to look. I tried some of the dishes Yelpers recommended. Shrimp Pad Thai (Of course) Spice level 4Yum Woon SenWe got it to go and took it home to devour. There's about four tables in the whole place, so we figured we'd give someone else a chance to sit and enjoy. We live close enough that I couldn't see the food going all wilty before we made it home. \u00a0 I hate to say it, but my husband was not impressed. My taste buds were more intrigued. I'm not a fan of Pad Thai in general, but I found it delicious and the spice level was perfect. I liked what the older gentleman said in reference at the counter \"Any level higher than five is like putting a lighted match in your mouth.\" Good comparison. Glad I took note.Yum Woon Sen was another interesting dish to me. Not a fave, but it proved to tantalize your taste buds with something a little more different. It's a sour/tart tasting dish, but slowly the spices just seems to do something, and you find yourself enjoying it a little bit more each bite. I agree with Mike G. Egg rolls? Delicious. So much fried 'Yum' in those tiny things. The market itself is interesting. There's a lot of really cool things you're not going to see at your local Kroger's store. Duck heads, Beef tongue, brains? Not to mention every staple required in a Asian food enthusiast's cooking pantry. Prices are good, but like others have mentioned... Might wanna check the dates, as some items were a tad bit dusty. It all around was a cool experience. I think we're going to stop back and just work our way down the menu. I'm glad to have this place in the hood. It's a real unique gem to Columbus for those looking to take a step away from the traditional Americanized food we all grew up with."], ["Donna O.", "People, I have met my spicy-food Waterloo at Westgate Thai. I love spicy food: the tasty-hot; not the numb-tongue, strictly by Scoville scale spicy. (Why eat something spicy/hot if you can't taste it after the second bite?) I'd worked my way through 614 Magazine's hottest foods in town list, so Westgate Thai was a must-try. Most of the time, I get softballed at ethnic restaurants - but not at Westgate Thai.When we sat down, the proprietor gave us menus and informed/warned us about the heat scale they use. \"Anything above five is like lighting a match and putting it in your mouth.\" CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.This restaurant is located inside Westgate Imports Market on Broad Street. There are 3-4 tables, huddled around a counter behind which are food photos and menu items. Their menu (they have table menus as well) is varied with lots of curry, noodles, Asian salads, and appetizers - all in large portions. Vegetarian and vegan dishes are plentiful, too.About that spice scale. One to fifteen, with five topping the limit for most American palates. I honestly thought they were messing around with the spice level for effect. The spouse had a pork dish, level three, and our friend Renee one of the meat-based salads at a less-spicy level.Thinking I'd be conservative, I ordered green curry chicken, level eight.But, let's back up and talk about the smoothies here. They're more like milkshakes than smoothies, a very creamy consistency paired with pureed fresh fruit. Definitely a drink spiked with sweetened condensed milk. I'm lactose intolerant and diabetic, so I might have passed on a mango smoothie had I known.ORDER A SMOOTHIE. That smoothie probably saved my tongue and lips from being blistered. It was my secret weapon for what turned out to be the spiciest as well as one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time. Spicy, yes. Hot, yes. Searing to the nose, yes. The broth was perfectly balanced with green curry and coconut milk, and there were lots of textures and flavors of vegetables, all cooked properly before being added to the curry. All the flavors and textures came right through - I still cannot figure out one veggie -rind like a watermelon, inside like a tomato, tasted like a cucumber, size of a large cherry tomato. Not bitter melon, but maybe?WOOOO HOT. Usually, I'd forgo rice and I don't like to drink much with spicy meals but I broke after three or four bites, dumping all the rice into my bowl and taking sips of my smoothie when it got to be too much. Right on the line of pain / pleasure - sadomasochism, culinary-style. No sweating, no crying, but there was plenty of nose action and mouth-tingling goodness. And, by Jove, I finished that curry!We ordered sticky rice with mangoes for dessert, which was exactly the kind of thing one needs to settle down the stomach after ingesting an atomic bomb.(The answer to the QUESTION YOU MAY BE ASKING: A couple of blisters on my lip, and the next day I felt like my insides were being squeezed by a boa constrictor for a few hours, but nothing worse than that. Not even the issues which result from accidental lactose ingestion. I think my body was in utter shock and couldn't even.)We closed the place down (they close to diners at 7:30pm and shut down for the night at 8pm) before we were able to get a good look around the market itself. Next time, because we'll certainly be back. (Much like childbirth, I SWORE I would dial it back next time, but I'm already wondering if I could handle it again...)"], ["Naiying C.", "We had the Lad Na, Ba Boong, Yum Woon Sen and Pad Phirk Khing. All were very good! Lad Na- wide noodles with a delicious brown gravy sauce, choose any meat you likeBa Boong- we never had this dish before and it was surprising good. The noodle is covered in a creamy coconut sauce and you have to mix in the fish sauce, peanut and chili in yourself. Top with tons of veggie and a spring roll which adds interesting texture/flavor. SO GOOD! Yum Woon Sen- sour and spicy goodness! Pad Phrik Khing- crispy beans with beef (your choice of meat) Spice level goes from 1 to 12(or was it 10), I don't usually eat spicy so 3 was good, 5 is where I start feeling the spice but can still handle it.

We chose the Mexican rating, and it wasn't very hot. The noodles were limp, and the dish lacked flavor.The dessert was pricey ($6), and included tiny bits of fresh fruit: young coconut, lychee, mango. And lots of green jello. All in a creamy soup, with ice. It was refreshing, but the ice ruined it - watered the whole dish down to a flavorless, gummy soup.Had my hopes up, but the wait was over 25 minutes for 1 dish.

We should come back \"sometime\"? Yeah... I found myself thinking perhaps I should wander the market until I'm hungry again. Wondering if they serve breakfast. Considered changing apartments to facilitate walking here. It's that good.  It's in an Asian Market, it's small and awkward, though very clean. The ambiance is a big bag of who cares once the food hits your table. We had fresh spring rolls which are shrimp, basil, cilantro, and rice noodles wrapped in a rice paper wrapper. They are not fried, and taste like a crisp spring day. They are served with a sweet sour dipping sauce with crushed peanuts. I had the Pad Thai, at a level 2 spice. It was glorious, sweet, with a taste of sesame oil, balanced with citrus and peanut- best pad Thai I've ever eaten. We also tried the Panaang Curry at a level 3. Fresh beautiful veggies, a complex and balanced broth, and a pleasant heat with tender flavorful juicy chicken throughout- just lovely! Served with perfectly done white rice.  A note on spice levels: our order taker was very good at explaining it to us, it's a 1-12 scale, with 5 and above basically only for those who grew up with it. To determine your level ask yourself this: \"did I grow up in the Midwest with typical American cuisine?\" If you answered yes I'd go no more than a 3. 4 if you like spicy /hot food. We topped off this flavor explosion with Mango rice. This is glutinous rice with coconut milk served with sesame seeds on top and cut up mango. Whatever that pulls into your imagination, trust me when I say that mango sticky rice is proof that God loves us when it's mediocre. When it's done well (and it so was) it makes you believe that everything in the universe is \u00a0good, it's all going to be ok, and we are all in this together. I know it sounds like hyperbole but I really feel this way after eating this absurdly delicious treat. I cannot speak to the \"authenticity\" of this to traditional Thai food, as I am not from there, and have never been there. I have eaten a lot of American Thai food, and I can say with authority that of the Thai food I've had this was out of this world good, and was very much a stand out.

For those who can't handle spice, don't go above a 1 or 2! My date ordered a crazy level of spice and he loved it. She isn't afraid to give you the heat if you ask for it!

Tried the chicken pad Thai and it was amazing. Got it at a spice level of 4/12 which was the perfect level of spice.

It was so good! The spiciness scale is a little weird; scale of 1-12 but anything higher than a 6, they said, is like lighting a match in your mouth. The pad Thai at 5 was quite spicy for me - and I normally eat things spicy. Fried rice was at a 4, and it was perfect. Spring rolls were like anywhere else. I can easily make spring rolls, so I'm not too impressed by them since they're quite simple to make. Thai iced teas were $2 cheaper than other places and delicious- not too sweet!

About two months ago, I stopped in to take a look around and do a bit of shopping. First thing? This place kinda smells. Like, that 'coolers aren't turned up high enough' mildewy smell. I sucked it up though, as my curiosity pushed me farther inside. They have a TON of products, almost all asian things that I was vaguely familiar with. Their prices on dry soba, rice, and buckwheat noodles are 1/3 the price of the ones you would find in the international foods sections of major grocers, for the same brands! I walked away with noodles, canned coconut milk, and a can of green curry paste (that I later found out was SO SPICY I couldn't eat it. RIP curry shrimp). Upon inspection later, both my noodles and curry paste had been expired for several months. Does this matter? Probably not, but make sure you check the dates on the items you purchase. The produce selection looked a little wilted, but the prices were fair. I could see coming here if I needed a last minute item, or if I wanted one of the special items that you can't find elsewhere.
