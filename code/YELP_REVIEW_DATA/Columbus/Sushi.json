{"Moshi Sushi Bar": [["Carly W.", "My husband and I tried Moshi Sushi last night for the first time. We have just moved to the area and have been busy sampling the abundant food options. A friend accompanied us to the restaurant, which was crowded and noisier than I would have imagined for such a small place. I would give the place 3 stars, except the scallop roll saved the day and warranted the 4th star. The rolls are small, about the diameter of a quarter, and only six pieces. The spicy tuna roll was full of flavor, though the spicy salmon I found bland. The rainbow roll was about as average as possible, but hot damn, the spicy scallop roll was out of this world. Fresh, decadent, and unbelievable umami. Miso soup was okay. The house salad was teeny, but the tropical miso dressing shined like a star on the palate. We'll certainly return to try more options (and more spicy scallop rolls, good lord the spicy scallop rolls....)."], ["Allison B.", "Maybe tonight was just an off night for this place, but my husband and I left disappointed. The servers were polite and friendly, but they looked extremely harried- constantly running- yes, I actually saw one running- back and forth. We were seated right away but told that the kitchen was backed up- 25 minutes for food and 45 minutes for sushi. I don't think ours actually took that long, but the table across from us really did have to wait a long time and complained. The atmosphere was nice- we chose to sit inside but the patio looked especially pleasant. Now for the most important part, the food:House salad- small with a miso citrus dressing. Would not recommend. Spring roll appetizer- this consisted of one skinny spring roll cut into four pieces. The inside was very processed looking. The dipping sauces were good though!California roll- standardly delicious. Yum!Trio tataki- the fatty tuna was excellent, white tuna was good, and Kobe was fine. The fish was very fresh and we would highly recommend this!Beef yaki soba- I did not care for this at all and my husband had them remove it from the check. I think this was a personal preference though and was grateful that they removed it. My husband thought it was rather bland but ate his portion with some spicy mayo added. Overall, we noticed that most people got sushi, and the sushi was our favorite part of the meal. Other than that it was too expensive for the meh quality appetizers and entrees. We have not yet found a Japanese restaurant that we really like here in Columbus, but we won't be going to this one again."], ["Monnie S.", "Always a reliable for lunch in Bexley. I'm not a raw fish sushi fan, but the vegetarian options are delicious. Aside from sushi, the rest if the menu provides many great options. My favorite entree choice is teriyaki salmon. lunch pricing very affordable."], ["Daniel B.", "Good but over priced sushi. \u00a0Not the biggest rolls either. \u00a0The taste is top quality, \u00a0though. \u00a0I like to go on Mondays and Tuesdays from 5-6 as they have 1/2 price sushi"], ["Tammy A.", "My sister first introduced me to this place. I liked it a lot after my California roll. We usually get the food to go when we come here. I will update this review once I have actually eaten inside the restaurant to get the full experience and service of Moshi Sushi."], ["James B.", "First time and was impressed with service and food. Had the cold tempura udon and it was great. The appetizer of dumplings, I would call gyoza was very good. Would recommend to anyone"], ["Raul A.", "Great service. I sat alone at the bar (forever alone, LOL) and got to watch TV, mess with my phone and watch the sushi chefs.My sushi was excellent. \u00a0It's a tad pricey but I ordered 2 of their signature rolls, so that's expected. \u00a0I also enjoyed some saki on the side. \u00a0I'd definitely visit again if I'm ever in town."], ["Shea H.", "I was getting my car serviced nearby so I walked here to feed my famished belly. \u00a0I walked in right before 2pm, forgetting that some restaurants close after lunch time. \u00a0I was told that I would need to get my order in quickly but, for some reason, it didn't dawn on me that I might be holding everyone up. \u00a0I put in an order for udon and asked if it might be possible to have the shrimp replaced with tofu. \u00a0They obliged and maybe 10-15 minutes later, my order arrived. \u00a0The waiter even brought me some extra spices that he recommend I try. \u00a0The noodles were delicious. \u00a0It was mid-noodle that I realized that no one else was in the restaurant and the employees were relaxing and cleaning. \u00a0Crap-- this place is closed, I realized! \u00a0Well the staff, in no way, made me feel rushed or unwanted-- which I thought was very nice of them. \u00a0Outstanding service and really delicious food! \u00a0Go get some-- but check the hours of operation first :)"], ["Sara C.", "It was my birthday again last week, and it had been a few years (unfortunately) since we'd treated ourselves to Moshi, so we set out to Bexley on Tuesday evening. \u00a0There's no getting around the fact that the entrance from the interior parking lot is going to be a little awkward, but we were quickly welcomed and seated. \u00a0On Monday and Tuesday, basic sushi rolls are half off, and many drinks are just $5. \u00a0The boy ordered the usual Berry Blossom, which now comes in a short stout glass with diced strawberries and a berry skewer. \u00a0The restaurant offers a free sushi panini on your birthday, and since we hadn't tried it before, this was an opportune time. \u00a0We were both a little skeptical about it having read the description in the menu, but after trying it, we are definitely converts. \u00a0The crispy rice, the flavorful salmon, the avocado -- the blend of ingredients was unusual but the flavor was great! \u00a0For dinner, we went with sushi -- a Philadelphia roll, a spicy tuna roll, an eel roll (all half price), salmon nigiri, and splurged on the Scarlet Craze. \u00a0The basic rolls were good, the salmon nigiri was exceptional, and the Scarlet Craze, though it carried a hefty $17.25 price tag, was worth every penny. \u00a0Taking into consideration the happy hour specials, our bill came to about $55 including tip.We have been to quite a few sushi places in Columbus during our 3+ years here, and Moshi is the best of them when you take into account the quality, service, and ambiance. \u00a0We have never felt snubbed or condescended to here; the service is polite, attentive, and cheerful. \u00a0Granted, prices are a little more than we can afford, but that makes the occasional trip to Moshi even more of a treat."], ["Mark K.", "This is a decent sushi place, but seems to be more about location and decor than stellar food. \u00a0I mean, it was fine, but not great, and for the prices I would expect great...My sweetie and I shared several rolls and an app, the seafood spring roll. \u00a0The spring roll was fair, but almost egg-rolly and incredibly small. \u00a0The spider roll was very good. \u00a0The California roll was good too. \u00a0The spicy salmon roll was meh. \u00a0All ingredients seemed fresh, but nothing really leapt out and the rolls were pretty small. \u00a0We stayed away from their specialty rolls because- wow! \u00a0I don't expect a cheap meal when I order sushi, but the prices are steep for what you get.Service was slow, but otherwise friendly and helpful. \u00a0This was odd since they were barely half full.Hey, at least Jeni's is right next door for dessert..."], ["Jared E.", "I figured I'd write an update since I've been here more so many times since my last review and haven't updated. \u00a0Wow, what a wonderful night in Bexley it was. \u00a0It was a cool 78 degrees and I met two of my good friends for a Sunday night sushi dinner, sitting down on the patio at 7pm tonight. \u00a0As always, everything was top notch and just as perfect as it gets.One thing I love about their sushi here, and each time I come back I remember, is that they don't *overdo* the rice on the rolls. \u00a0There is always just a thin layer of rice--it's all about the main ingredients here, ie, the fish. \u00a0It's always fresh and served cold like sushi should be--and tender, it just dissolves in your mouth, you never have a \"chew, chew, chew, spit-in-to-napkin\" episode when you eat the rolls here. \u00a0It's truly amazing.I started with a tempura appetizer and some hot sake. \u00a0I later switched to a healthy pour of really good viognier and had the crab/seaweed salad which is definitely 2DF (to die for). \u00a0For dinner I had a spicy tuna roll, california roll and a rainbow roll. \u00a0The rainbow roll here is absolutely the best I've ever had. \u00a0So much care and pride is put into the sushi here--it's nothing but a passionate art, and I almost feel guilty eating David's (the sushi chef) creations because they are so perfect and beautiful.The couple I ate with tonight are also regulars. \u00a0I've taken others here before and people often complain about the wait for the sushi. \u00a0Well, what you wait for is what you get. \u00a0And, what you get is good. \u00a0Enjoy your company, order some non-sushi appetizers and kick back with some sake, a house cocktail or a great glass of wine and just relax."], ["Stephanie P.", "Stopped by this place after a family outing. The service was extremely slow. We just ordered basic sushi, California Rolls and Miso soup and it was a forty minute wait. The food was decent but didn't outweigh the wait after a long day."], ["Luan N.", "S=Subjective O=Objective A=Assessment P=PlanS: I was quite hungry and lonely on a cold Friday night. Decided to take a quick escape to Bexley to elevate my mood with some chill beats and tantalizing food.

The crispy coating on the outside with the delicate melt in your mouth salmon on the inside was my favorite dish of the night. I ordered the nigiri to gauge the freshness and quality of the unadulterated fish. To be honest, was not the best showing, and overshadowed by the other dishes. But will mention, this also holds true for my fave jap fusion restaurant in Chicago, Macku. P: My Category A recommendations- I would try the starters and entrees. There are quite a few twists to the classics which you will not find anywhere else. And don't forget the sushi panini! Looks like 1/2 price sushi on M,T 5-6:30pm"], ["Ryan S.", "Always ask for belly. It's a chef's secret. The bartender makes a mean manhattan -- perfect for the end of a long day. David has brought a gem to Bexley, play your part and come admire it."], ["January B.", "My boyfriend and I are not from Columbus and stumbled into this restaurant after eating at Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams next door. We were expecting just a regular Japanese reasturant but got much more.The non-sushi menu is small but impressive. They have taken a lot of non-traditional Japense items and reimagined them to fit their restaurnt. For example, they have Japanese fish and chips (served with sweet potato chips)!We had the most unique and impressive item on the menu, the sushi panini. It's two \"panini slices\" of rice that is panko-crusted on one side and has nori seaweed on the other. In between that, for the \"sandwich filling\" is creamy avocado and your choice of fish, we went with salmon. It's served with a sweet soy dipping sauce. Talk about delicious!We also had the seafood spring rolls, chock full of fish and served with a sweeter chili sauce and a wasabi mayonaise. This was less impressive, we felt like the filling was a bit dry and could have actually used more vegetables in it.We also had what we called their fancy miso soup, which had spinach, scallions, and clams in it. It actually has A LOT of clams in it, enough that we just split a bowl and we both had about 3-4 mussles each! The price was only $4.50 for the soup, which was very fair.Overall, we enjoyed the food and felt the waitstaff was very nice and apologetic of the wait. We would have liked to try the sushi, but wound up falling in love with the sushi panini, so it all worked out! We will definitely go back again if we're ever in the area.Important note: It will serve you better if you make a reservation before going. We went on a Sunday evening around 7 PM and had to wait about half an hour before being seated. We were then told that sushi would take about 45 minutes to be served, due to all of the carry-out orders and other customers in the restaurant. We ordered off the kitchen menu instead and didn't have a long wait at all."], ["S L.", "I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my boyfriend's mom.Great food, but very slow service.

(We should have just made our reservations there!) We are repeat customers so we knew to get the spicy tuna and spicy crab paninis. We had a combination of rolls that were delicious. After this experience, I realized I was overdue to post a Yelp review in their favor. So, I came here and I read some comments that it is pricey as a complaint. It isn't cheap, but it is not that bad when you are talking about quality sushi and other great eats. My suggestion is, that if you are looking for cheaper high quality sushi, check out Moshi's happy hour specials on Monday nights, or if you just want cheap, go to Kroger. Every time I have been there the service and food have been top shelf.

I am always excited to try new sushi places on the outskirts of Columbus as I am constantly looking for hidden gems to frequent. Though Moshi is good, it was not worth the extra drive to Bexley for what it was. I would have given them another star as I did enjoy their drink menu, but was simply disappointed at the lack of diversity in some of their rolls. If I lived down the street I am certain I would probably return every couple months out of convenience alone. I do give them credit for knowing their audience as the menu certainly would suit the general customers of the area, but true sushi connoisseurs would ask for more. This review is based on a trip I made there a while ago, and I would happily change my tune should I wonder by and have a different experience."], ["Diana S.", "As far as sushi goes in Columbus, it's one of the best, and it's fairly priced. For 2 persons, we ordered 2 miso soups, the grilled calamari appetizer, jmynt roll, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, and paradise roll (total 53.00). We could have used one more roll or appetizer, but we were still satisfied. The sushi rolls I had were on par with Haiku. The large rolls are smaller than most large rolls (but they cost less than most large rolls), so you need to order more rolls than you normally would, which I sort of like so that you are not stuck ordering and eating one massive plate of the same thing. In my opinion, Haiku has mastered (ALL OF) their appetizers, and Moshi still has a little work to do (grilled calamari). \u00a0It was good and fresh with excellent accompaniments, just no Haiku (maybe a tiny bit overcooked). We ordered take out, and the server was very helpful on the phone when asking for recommendations, the food was ready on time when I arrived, and the staff was friendly when I came in to pick it up. All in all, a great experience, and I will definitely return."], ["Raeanna O.", "I'd been meaning to try Moshi since it opened, but never quite made it...I went for lunch, and must say I was not that impressed. There were two other tables in the restaurant, and our server was flighty, at best. She approached the table after we had sat there for 10 minutes to ask about drink orders, and when we stated we were sticking with water, she walked away without asking if we were ready to order or if we had questions about the menu. Once we had our questions answered, service was relatively quick, however, when I pushed a plate to the side of the table, she ran across the room to remove it, leaning across my sushi plate without saying a word, her shirt nearly touching my food.As for the sushi, I can see what other reviewers were saying about small portion sizes for the price. Initially, I thought $9 for two rolls was a decent price; however, I didn't realize the rolls would be the size of nickels in diameter, and the flavor was average, at best. The tempura roll was especially salty. My friend ordered her roll without wasabi, but was not pleased to see large gobs of wasabi within the roll. Additionally, her roll was $11, and she received five relatively small pieces for that price. When the server returned to our table to ask if we'd like anything else, my friend said, \"No, but...\" and was left hanging as she was hoping to inform the server of the wasabi error.Needless to say, I doubt I would return here. The nicest thing about the restaurant is the decor, and that is usually free. With several better establishments in the Columbus area, I don't see any reason to go back."], ["Patty B.", "When they first opened this was easily one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus -- awesome food and attentive service. However, I have been less impressed on my last few visits over the past year. Their sushi is among Columbus's best IMO, albeit a bit pricey for the quantity. I used to really enjoy most of their non-sushi dinner items, but the samplings that I've had from their non-sushi lunch items have been underwhelming. And there are some servers - although not all - who seem a little discriminatory towards solo diners (e.g., rushing you out by bringing the check right after serving your food, and without asking if you want anything else, and before delivering the check to groups who were served long before you; refilling the water glasses of the tables around you but not yours; seating you at the bar without checking on your seating preference, when the restaurant has several empty tables throughout the time that you're there). And no, the restaurant was not full or approaching rush hour during those times. I will probably be back sometime for dinner when I feel like I deserve a splurge, and I will hope that their food and service is what I fell in love with when they were the new kid on the block."], ["Andy P.", "The sushi is much better than a majority of the sushi bars around the Columbus area. The fish is very fresh and no roll is ever pre-made and the sushi chef's use nothing but the best pieces of fish. One of my favorite rolls is the Jmynt (pronounced jay-mint) Roll is a shrimp tempura roll with cream cheese and is topped with spicy crab salad.Another favorite of mine is the O-H-I-O roll. The dinner platters tend to be a bit pricey and the serving sizes on some of the entrees could be bigger. The atmosphere is relatively modern but I do not feel that the entire decor really flows well together. It is very laid-back and casual but by no means is a come in your sweatpants atmosphere.As stated earlier, it is definitely one of the finer sushi establishments in the Columbus area. I would recommend it to my friends."], ["Sandy M.", "I can't give the proper review a sushi restaurant deserves right now since I can't eat any fish right now. However, as a restaurant in general, Moshi Sushi is a great find. The ambiance of he restaurant is cozy yet modern; the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the food is tasty. And, from 5-6:30, they have Happy Hour. Traditional rolls such as CA, spicy tuna, futomaki, shrimp tempura, avocado, etc. etc. are 1/2 price, which is $1.75-3.50 a roll! It really is a great deal. Plus, Bud and Bud Lights are $2 and the sake is $3. Really really good deal for a Japanese restaurant.Although I was curious about their sushi, we trekked it down to Moshi for their sukiyaki. We saw their menu in a local Columbus magazine and my husband went gaga for the prospect of having great sukiyaki with KOBE beef! Although the price of the dish seems hefty ($27), it had lots of filling and satisfying ingredients such as onions, nappa cabbage, mushrooms, scallions, tofu and udon noodles. It left both of us very satisfied. The presentation of the dish was great. It came in a casserole pot with all the fresh ingredients on top of a portable stove. The fresh meat was arranged around the marinade/broth in a very aesthetic manner. Once the broth started boiling, we dunked the beef in the sweet broth and savored every bite. I thought it was very good but my husband really wanted it in true Japanese fashion with a raw egg to drop into the broth. We figured it may be because of the risk of salmonella that they can't do this? All in all, the meal was good and the entire experience was great. However, I want to come back here when I can eat fish so I can give a true review that a sushi restaurant deserves."], ["Andrew S.", "dont see what the big fuss is all about. your pretty much paying for the location here and the owners rent. We (2 adults) ordered the 14 dollar roll and the 18 dollar roll expecting great things (sorry i dont remember the name and the website menu is all fuzzy). first off the 18 dollar one was a piddily 6 pieces, the size of half dollars, nothing big at all. and the taste was nothing to write home about. the other 14 dollar roll (sorry cant remember the name, was fried) was ok, but again the size was terrible. it was as big as a quarter. we also got 2 cheap rools , philadelphia and salmon, which were ok. We actually ordered another roll after all of this bc we still didn't feel like we had eaten dinner, which never happens to us when we get sushi. the reason i am giving it 2 stars is because the service was decent. i guess i am forced to go back to other subpar sushi places in columbus even tho those places arent the greatest either. but there at least u get a roll bigger than a pocket full of change. to sum up, moshi either needs to cut down the prices or increase the size of their rolls.chabba"], ["michelle k.", "i stopped by moshi sushi for dinner on a thursday night. i think moshi is the best sushi restaurant in columbus. the interior is clean & modern. the staff are friendly & the owner takes his time to walk around and speak to the customers. that's customer service. we ordered some sashimi and the seafood was fresh....the yellowtail was awesome. we also ordered the jmymt which is apparently their number one seller (i can see why) and the hurricane which is really light and fresh.alot of sushi restaurants are too heavy handed on their sauces but it was perfect @ moshi. you MUST order the sushi panini. \u00a0i know it sounds weird but damn it's GOOD. i can eat that all day long."]], "Akai Hana": [["Adam K.", "I visited Akai Hana 10 years ago at least two times, back when I was a sushi novice, just getting into trying new rolls, plain old sashimi, and of course, the good ol' nigiri \"special\" rolls. \u00a0I remembered thinking it was \"just okay\" back then, but what I remembered most was that I felt like it was \"very gourmet,\" but honestly couldn't remember why I thought this way. \u00a0After hearing more people talk and converse online about how it's \"the best sushi in town,\" my wife and I decided to check it out instead of going to one of our Columbus favorites (Sushi Ko or Sushi Ronin). \u00a0MAN, were we disappointed.So the \"gourmet\" thing I remembered? \u00a0After seeing the first rolls come out, I remembered why I thought this way - SO much sauce added to these things. \u00a0Service was fine, but they put a shit load of rice in their rolls, and it seemed as if the rice was a bit on the large side. \u00a0So either it was old, over-cooked, or over saturated. \u00a0In either case, one of the rolls had SO much rice on it, there was barely (and I mean BARELY) anything inside the roll. \u00a0One of the more expensive rolls we ordered was the Dynamite roll and we opted for crab. \u00a0I had no idea it was going to come out as a small roll with a ton of rice, and then crab - fried to death, with more breading than you can imagine - sitting on top of the meager \"special\" roll. \u00a0I also felt like their Sake selection was on the light side. \u00a0I don't need sake out of a wooden box (not to mention, they were out of one of them anyway). \u00a0I just want plain old, good sake that I can drink out of a shot glass... and then I want more. \u00a0Bottom line here, they get 1 star for pretty good service and another star for the \"okay\" ambiance, but it's nothing to write home about. \u00a0If you're looking for good sushi with lots of choices at a fair cost, check out Sushi Ronin in Dublin or Sushi Ko at Crosswoods in Worthington. \u00a0If you're looking for cute sushi with eyes made out of peas and horns made out of carrot straws with tons of rice and rationed fish, check this place out and write a review similar to mine after dropping $80. \u00a0Akai Hana is either living off their long-standing \"top rating\" or it has some sort of cult following that I can't understand, but in either case, they're clearly skimping on quality, hoping no one will notice."], ["Kaoru M.", "Akai Hana is probably your safest bet for Japanese food in Columbus. Their menu is mostly authentic, but they don't serve some of the crazier Japanese dishes that might otherwise scare away a novice. If you're not very familiar with Japanese food or sushi in general, this is a good place to start.That, along with the fact that it's located next to the only Japanese grocery store in town (Tensuke Market), makes this restaurant pretty busy. I've encountered wait times as long as 1 hour for LUNCH! If they had the space for it, this restaurant definitely should try expanding.If you come here for lunch, their daily lunch special is pretty neat. For around $11, you can get your choice of grilled fish or tempura along with california roll, dumplings or spring rolls, grilled meat, marinaded seaweed or octopus, miso soup, rice, and salad. Definitely very filling."], ["Dan L.", "All I can review here is the sushi, because that's all I had. They do have a full menu though, and some of the stuff other people got looked pretty fancy-delicious.We just ordered a few rolls and individual pieces of Nigiri at the sushi bar. They've pretty much have every kind of sushi you can think of so you're sure to find your favorite. While salmon and tuna are common orders for me, I also got some tako(octopus) and surf clam which were some of my favorites. Be adventurous and order a lot!"], ["Rebecca S.", "My boyfriend and I aren't from Ohio (Alaska and Minnesota) and were worried we wouldn't be able to find reasonably priced sushi that still delicious. We were pleasantly surprised! The wait was a bit long (45 minutes for a table) but definitely worth it.

It has quickly become our favorite sushi bar!"], ["Eileen A.", "Love the food and atmosphere. Place was crowded which is a good sign. Fresh sushi and delicious ramen. The bulgogi was also amazing!!"], ["Amber S.", "Small restaurant in a shopping center that may have the best sushi in Columbus, but they're aloud to be in a shopping center, because the food is fantastic. The service is great, the sushi is amazing, the prices are decent. The hot saki is very good. It is also nice for a group, they have a private room that comes with good service. I make reservations because if you don't on a weekend, you will end up waiting."], ["Sherman C.", "What can I say more! Extremely authentic Japanese Food! I had been there several times and every single time I came out their restaurant with great satisfaction in my belly. I particularly love their Spicy Scallop Sushi, some spicy mayo plus big fresh scallop. This combination is DIVINE! Aged-Tofu is nice for appetizer! Other dishes are great as well! Can't complain! Great customer service! All of the servers are Japanese lady, they are very polite and friendly! Highly recommend to anyone who loves Japanese Food and great customer service!"], ["Michelle S.", "I would have to say this is my favorite sushi restaurant in Columbus next to Edamame...but those are comparing apples and oranges with completely different styles. Both delicious. Edamame has creative and more Americanized sushi whereas Akai Hana is more fresh and authentic...anyway this is about Akai Hana so back to my review.4 stars for good service, the staff is always helpful and friendly no matter how busy they are and \u00a0most of the food is good, what keeps it from being 5 stars is because a lot of things didn't really \"blow\" me away.Their ramen is good, soba noodles with fried shrimp is good (but who could mess that up?) love the dynamite roll, jalape\u00f1o roll, scallop roll, and I think the yellowtail roll (forgot the name). Can't go wrong.The bibimbap and sukiyaki is okay, I've had better.But yeah, this place is definitely for sushi lovers. Now I'm having cravings!"], ["Erin N.", "This is by far, the best sushi in Columbus. Yes, I know how that sounds, but it's so true. Unfortunately for me, it was the place I discovered I loved sushi, so when the craving hits, no other place will do. If you're going for the first time, a call ahead reservation will be helpful, especially if you plan on going during dinner hours on a weekend. For sushi lovers, I recommend the spicy scallop roll, rainbow roll, and for you eel lovers, the Buckeye Roll.For sushi beginners, the Harvest Roll is amazing. Yes, there's no actual meat in there, but the roll is wrapped in rice paper, so the texture is more mild. If you're a little more adventurous, go for the Red Dragon. It's shrimp tempura inside, and salmon on the outside.For non-sushi folks, the bulgogi, ramen, or grilled tofu are also great bets.Now, appetizers. Guys, you gotta try Negima Yaki. It's life changing. Thinly sliced beef wrapped around scallions, cooked, and covered in a light sweet/salty teriyaki sauce. SO. GOOD.I really don't have anything bad to say about this place, because I've never not thouroughly enjoyed each visit!"], ["Niheala R.", "My husband and I go there often. I highly recommend the scallops!!! They melt in your mouth. We also get the dragon roll. Nice combo crunchy tempura with tuna that is sinfully good. I could eat there once a week. Or twice or maybe 3 times."], ["Amit I.", "Nice setup. Food was ok but I was disappointed somewhat as its looks more promising.

The regular rolls are just as good as the specialty rolls and very well priced.

Akai Hana was very cordial in accommodating our slightly large group, which by the way they take phone reservations, which are great on a Saturday evening, because this place is hopping!Our waitress was extremely nice and extremely helpful to those in our group who have never had the pleasure of eating sushi or sashimi. She was also well spoken and didn't rush us when it came to ordering. I can't remember everything our party got, but I will tell you... the Dragon roll.... Yes, I know it's americanized, but it was the BOMB. It was so good. Definitely worth a try. Something I will note, and I don't know if this is traditional, or not, because I'm no sushi expert by any means, but the pieces of sushi (not the rolls) have small traces of wasabi under them. A total surprise factor for those who may not treasure the taste of wasabi. It's almost like a joke to watch those unsuspectingly munching into a nostril inflaming surprise. Overall, the fish was of good sushi quality. The Sashimi we ordered was like butta'. It just melted in your mouth, so definitely some pluses towards that. Akai Hana's pricing might make some cringe, but for the options we have in Ohio.. it's unfortunately the price we pay for not being directly on a coast."], ["Tony S.", "Wasn't impressed by this place. Came here with a large group of 12, service was moderate, not good not bad. I tried many things from my friends, but I can't list everything because I don't know what they were. Ordered the honey roll, didn't taste the craw fish, and couldn't tell the salmon was smoked. Also ordered Wakame and sadly was my favorite part, but it's pretty hard to mess up seaweed in sesame oil.If you think cream cheese and spicy mayo makes good sushi, then this is probably the place for you. My date's roll came with some intricate sauce display, was interesting, Mine was just a normal looking roll. But overall for our table I can say the presentation was sloppy. One dish, what i believed to be a roll, looked like just a giant ball of spicy mayo rice fish and more spicy mayo in aluminum foil.My friend next to me ordered a soup entree, couldn't tell you what it was, but I would never order it. Comparing it to a good bowl of pho, the broth was comparable to watered down Swanson. Not to say anything I tried was bad, but overall the experience was boring, dull, and the food plain.Last me and my date felt a little nauseous for 24 hours after the meal. I rarely get sick, and had to drink plenty of water to prevent from upchucking. It didn't influence my review and I can't know for sure if the restaurant is to blame, but since we both had the same symptons, I do think it was from their fish or something else."], ["H C.", "Have been here twice and was happy with what we got. It's a really nice Japanese restaurant actually run by Japanese people, with both authentic and Americanized Japanese food. Might not be as competitive in other cities with a bigger Asian/Japanese community, but definitely better than other fake Japanese restaurants here in Columbus. This is Ohio after all. Will come back more."], ["Thomas L.", "This place has the best sushi in Columbus hands down. The service here is always top notch and the food is a step above that. I have been here multiple times and I have never had anything that wasn't delicious I would give a recommendation as to what to get but I don't want to retype their whole menu."], ["Andrea L.", "My suggestion to conquer this heavenly excursion through delicious Japanese food is to come with friends. There are simply too many delicious options to choose from- and hard to pass up at that. Not to mention the option to substitute brown rice in any roll! The presentation is spectacular and every time the waitress would come around with another roll I couldn't contain my excitement.The nigiri here is delicious, but they also feature tons of specialty rolls that can get pretty fancy- so I'd suggest ordering at least one of these when you come here. Or 5, whichever. My favorite roll was probably the Buckeye. That topped with the eel nigiri made for an unforgettable Japanese experience.I also got the spicy scallop roll which was an explosion of spicy mayo sauce. If you're not a fan of mayo like me, I wouldn't recommend this one. I hear there's a pretty big weekend crowd- understandable, it's probably the best sushi around town- but we went around 9 on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. Well worth the wait!"], ["Kazz Q.", "Awesome bento selection and very authentic Japanese cuisine. This place is worth driving to for a day trip to Columbus. So far I've tried miso soup, salad, Japan special bento, nigiri sushi, and the special lunch box.

The sushi is pretty solid and the specialty rolls creative, but I need to give a shout out to the bonzai udon noodle bowl. It's a huge, hot bowl of noodles and veggies, and it set off my sashimi appetizer wonderfully.The other thing I most love about Haiku is just how goshdarn pretty it is. Whether you sit inside or outside (weather permitting), the space just feels like its name, like a haiku. Don't ask me to elaborate; just notice it when you're there.The parking situation is much more favorable if you go at lunch. Drive on in to the private parking lot and get yourself a spot. I came for dinner on a Tuesday night, though, and didn't realize there was a valet until it was too late. I can understand it on a busy weekend night when the parking lot overflows, but it's more than a little annoying to hand your keys to someone and watch her drive it five feet to the parking spot.As I said above, the sushi is good, but even while looking at the menu now (which is usually good for sparking my memory), I'm not recalling which specific rolls I've had. The white kamikaze, maybe? I know I had something with sriracha once. It comes out looking as pretty as the restaurant, and you're unlikely to be disappointed. You just might not remember what you had a few months later."], ["Lisa P.", "So I've been wanting to try Haiku for a long time and today I went for lunch with the coworkers. I was underwhelmed and disappointed.The decor is typical sushi place decor. Low lighting, instrumental music, etc. What turned me off a bit was the smell. It smelled sterile and weird but we were the first ones there when they opened so maybe they had just cleaned. Anyway, it's clean and overall a fine space.For lunch, they have complimentary soup and salad. The miso soup was ok and the salad was great with a soy-based salad dressing. Each of us got sushi rolls. I had the High Street roll with cream cheese, salmon, tuna, avocado and spicy mayo. All of my favorite things in one roll! It comes out in six pieces so not a ton of sushi, which was disappointing and quite frankly, overpriced. They were big pieces though with real pieces of fish and it was very tasty. I paid around $15 with tip so I guess it wasn't that bad for soup, salad, and sushi. I guess after hearing all the rave reviews, I was just expecting more."], ["Nate M.", "I am a server and I hate \"professional Yelpers\".But man... I've been to Haiku twice now and it has not beed good either time.We were the ONLY people in the restaurant and it took a solid 5 minutes for our server to come to the table. I hate to be that needy but five minutes feels like an eternity when you are literally the only two people in the restaurant.Our server was adorably pleasant, but the shoehorned \"my loves/my dears\" was... offputting. She was so sweet, and I love hippie-hearted people, but... Yeesh. None of that really affects the rating more than a half star though because I'm not an asshole.The food is what merits the low score. Bland spring rolls, the eel was not great, and they were small portions. I come from a city of 40K people and we have a Japanese sushi place that blows Haiku out of the water. We won't be back."], ["Ry M.", "This place is lovely and so delicious. Staff is so friendly. Of course they operate next to the Union Station so maybe the kindness and courtesy is just average.

I went late at night so it wasn't too many people in the restaurant so that made it even better. There's parking on the side of the building and valet for $5. The patio outside looked like a Japanese garden. I loved the seating but of course, this isOhio and it gets cold quite quickly. I do think that if it was warmer, the seating arrangements outside are to perfection. It is located in the heart of the Short North. On some days, I was told that there's love entertainment like spoken word poetry or music so I'll have to come back for that. I plan on coming back again soon."], ["Gus W.", "I'm a huge sushi fan, but I'd never been to Haiku. I'm in Short North all the time and have been to just about every restaurant surrounding this place, but for some reason, I just never gave it a shot. Well, I was craving sushi the other night and as tempting as Akai Hana is every time I want sushi, the girlfriend and I decided to try something new. It was pouring raining and thunder and lightning, so we had to deal with that walking from the Hub garage. Note: It costs $5 for valet parking in the parking lot next to Haiku; although I'm not sure why, since they don't do anything. It'll cost you less to just park at The Hub parking garage right across the street.I always knew they had a huge patio, and it's partially covered, so you can actually eat out there during the rain, but I had no idea how large the inside of the place was. We were seated at a table toward the back, and our server was incredibly nice and helpful. I started off with the hot and sour lobster soup and a spring roll. The broth of the soup was pretty tasty, but the lobster pieces were pretty small and didn't add much to the dish. The girlfriend and I both liked the spring rolls.For the main course, we went with with two of the specialty rolls and a spicy tuna roll. One was the Urban Meyroll (so clever), and I forget the name of the other, since it's not normally on the menu. They all were really good and fresh. The spicy tuna roll was one of the better ones I've had in Columbus, and the salmon on the other rolls was great as well. As far as the sushi alone, Haiku way exceeded my expectations.This is a great place for a date, and all of the employees I encountered, were very nice and welcoming. The pricing is pretty standard for a sushi restaurant and great overall for the Short North. My only wish is that I had known to come here sooner, but we will definitely be back."], ["Maggie M.", "This place has great patio space in the heart of the short north.

I think had the service even been average, I would have bumped this review up to four stars. We sat at the \"garden table\" which was set below ground which made it really fun to climb into in my dress but I did manage it! I wonder if this particular table is part of what made the service slower - it seemed difficult for the servers to even pour water as they were basically climbing over us to do so. There was at least a 30 minute wait between any type of service, even water refills, but luckily we had a large fun group so the wait wasn't painful at all. The food, once we got it, was all very good. We had edamame, seafood salad, an assortment of sushi, and the chicken pad thai. I also enjoyed the glass of wine I had and they had a normal list of wines, cocktails, and beers. Everything was on point but nothing really blew me away. The highlight for me (unsurprisingly) was the \"crunching buckeye roll\" which was eel with pecans. They do have a really lovely patio and the weather was absolutely gorgeous. I actually didn't set a foot inside so can't comment on the interior decor! Oops. I am told there really is art everywhere though. Parking seemed to all be paid lots - valet, metered, or garages.

However, my sushi this evening was exceptional. The High St Roll was okay - not nearly as flavorful as I would've expected for what was in it - but the Harvest Roll was so phenomenally good, it blew everything else away. Seriously, you won't regret ordering it. I was uncertain if I really wanted squash on a pleasant summer evening, but it was not what I anticipated & exceeded what I thought I could have in terms of vegetarian sushi.

I eat A LOT of quality sushi and know my stuff so I was looking for quality reviews vs. price. I landed on this place, loaded into a cab, and headed out solo. It was raining out but the outdoor area looked really nice. I headed inside and asked for a table by the sushi bar. My server was great. Proactive and offered up good suggestions. Didn't make me feel awkward for eating alone. I ordered some rolls, salmon handroll, and eel,Uni and toro. Toro was listed as market price but I decided to go for it. Started with the handroll which was just plain nasty. The chopped salmon looked more like tuna and had a very off flavor. The salmon was ok so I moved on to the toro. Holy freaking yuck!! I've had sweet fatty melt \u00a0in your mouth toro many times and this was plain CRAP. Color was gray, texture was chewy and flavor and smell was straight up something you would chum the ocean with. I passed on the second piece I ordered and politely told the server that it didn't taste quite right. When he brought my bill he said aloud that he removed the toro and the main sushi chef heard this. He yelled \"what?? Toro is good!!\". I said no disrespect but I did not like it. He then grabbed a hunk wrapped in paper and shoved it at me yelling that is WAS good. The place fell silent and people looked at me. I said again I did not mean any disrespect. He then cut a piece, put it on a plate and threw it towards my at table. I said no thank you and he just kept yelling. I told him I would be leaving soon and again no disrespect. Many of the staff there came up as I left to apologize for him. Very strange and very unprofessional. If I was some ass just ordering crap I might give him a break but come on. I dropped $70.00 just on my own. I will never be back and will tell my whole huge company about this.I'm a foodie and people know it. Take some Midol old sushi guy.

Now that is not really true for a sushi lover - BUT its not horrible and if you go with the expectations of some great cocktails, a cute atmosphere and some tasty food - you will have a good time.I found that when I did more of the classic rolls, miso and some dim sum style items, I enjoyed the place more - I am usually a sashimi and nigiri eater - but that is not really what you want to have here. I would recommend trying some roll classics like the spicy tuna roll, the spider (for something cooked if you like that) and maybe even a phili roll for those who like something tame... \u00a0the butterfly roll was actually not bad.The drinks are strong.

The food was perfect. The service was perfect and the atmosphere and ambiance were perfect. I would not hesitate to to go back again. And if you are in the Short North do yourself a favor and go here."], ["Brieanna H.", "I'm sad and annoyed to write this review. I have been to Haiku many times since it opened, and they have all been okay. It was never my go-to sushi spot, but if I wanted sushi in the Short North or to enjoy a beautiful patio when the weather was nice, I would dine at Haiku. But after last night, I doubt I will return.My boyfriend and I had reservations at 8:30, and we were seated immediately upon arrival on the patio, as I had requested. It was about 10 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, which I didn't care for, so the evening was already off to a rocky start. We finally got our drinks another 10 minutes after we ordered them, so that made it 20 minutes with no drinks. It doesn't matter how busy you are, that is unacceptable. We ordered our food then, and began to drink our saki. The cold house saki was decent, but the hot house saki was better, even in the heat. So we finished our saki, and for another 10 minutes we had no drinks. During this time, it is not just that our server didn't check on us, but I didn't even see her on the patio. Eventually, she came out to give the table next to us their drinks, and I was able to flag her down to order another round as she was on her way back indoors. At this point, it had been a half hour since we had ordered our sushi, so we decided to ask about it because we were supposed to meet friends at 10:00 in the Arena District. Our server came back out to attend to another table, and when we flagged her down to inquire about our dinner, she gave us a laundry list of generic excuses in the manner of a more attentive, better server at an actually good restaurant reciting the daily specials: \"It's a Saturday night; we have a full house; it feels like Gallery Hop; I put your order in, so it will come out in due time\"; etc. She did not, however, have a specific time, and she did not even offer to check. At this point it was 9:45, and we told her we just wanted our check because we had to meet friends in 15 minutes. She apologized and left. Maybe 5 minutes later, as we were contemplating what to because now we had only 10 minutes, a man who did not identify himself, but who I suspected was some sort of manager, apologized and asked us if we wanted this plate of sushi that he was holding. I appreciated the gesture, but I wasn't thrilled by the idea of quickly eating a random plate of sushi. It was also very clear that this was absolutely not our order because the beef dish that my boyfriend, who is allergic to shellfish, ordered is not being offered to us along with the sushi. We thanked the man but reiterated that we had to meet friends at 10:00, so we would rather just have our check. He apologized again, and, to his credit, said that he would discuss the situation with the staff involved. I think this is a very good move because based on other Yelp reviews, this sort of experience seems to be pretty common. I don't believe that makes it acceptable, though. Then our server came back out with what we thought was our check. Half right! Hilariously, it was also our second round of drinks! It was nice that they came out, and we drank them, but it was now 10:00, 15 minutes after we had initially asked for our check. I'm not sure why we were still served and charged for drinks that we had ordered 20 minutes ago, especially considering that we told our server what time we were supposed to be somewhere else. Every other time I've been in a situation similar to this, the server has made an effort to help us get where we need to be on time. I'm not sure if this is obliviousness or blatant disregard on the part of Haiku, but I don't really think it matters. The result is still the same. Closing thoughts:1. Obviously, lovely patio, but not worth the headaches that one must endure to experience it. It's hard to enjoy a patio without a drink.2. Our waters were never refilled, so this might not be a good place for nondrinkers, either.3. Haiku is not the busiest restaurant in the city. How are other busier restaurants able to maintain a high level of customer service and Haiku is not?4. If you tell your tables that the reason for their long wait is due to a crowd, then maybe you should actually look busy instead of disappearing for long periods of time. Haiku no longer really attempts to be great. It is a well-known restaurant in a desirable part of the city with a beautiful patio. Is that enough for you? It is not enough for me."], ["Helen S.", "I came here on a Friday night with a group of 6 for dinner. We each ordered a roll and split with each other, and tbh I don't quite remember what we ordered. Sushi rolls tend to feel kinda similar after awhile if you have multiple options. Most of the rolls were pretty pricey though, especially for a place that is more trendy than authentic. Harvest roll was the only one that stood out for me, since it was the most delicious one of the table (in my opinion) and also the cheapest one that we ordered ($8.50). I would probably come back to order 2 of this and just feast."], ["Emily L.", "I went here with my work group- over 20 of us! I have been here before but not with this many people.

And :gasp: is not one of those fake fusion places that sell you watered down \"ramen noodle soups.\" The place is connected to the Japanese market, which is wonderful because you can grab lunch and finish your shopping all in one go! The food is reasonably priced, and the menu allows for you to choose from a wide variety of rice or noodle dishes. I ordered the pork cutlet over ramen, and a side of gyoza (dumplings). The ramen was good, but not the best ramen I've ever had. I must say, I've been spoiled coming from a big city where ramen places/Japanese restaurants are abundantly around. The gyoza was also tasty, but then again it's just fried dumplings. I would definitely go back again just to try the other dishes and fulfill my Japanese food cravings, so don't let the 3 stars fool you! It is still a good place to eat fast Japanese food!"], ["Yukako F.", "I guess I set my expectations too high for Tensuke and Tensuke Express. Hearing from other Japanese that Tensuke has 3x as much as our local Japanese grocery store, I was surprised in a negative way with the size of the complex. To get into Tensuke Express you need to go through the main (or in other words the only) entrance to Tensuke, which when I went in was too crowded. As it was a Saturday afternoon, and the market being famous amongst the Japanese community, I guess that's fair.You need to wait to be seated, and it seems that there's always somebody looking over the hall at the entrance of Tensuke Express so there shouldn't be such a long wait. After being told which table you're getting, you'll place your order at the counter in the rear corner. They give you a beeper that tells you when your meal is ready, just like those restaurants in the service areas on the highway.I got myself menu no.2-B, Soba with small Spicy Shrimp Tendon and green tea, altogether under $10. Considering the average price for Japanese dishes normally seen in the US I think this is quite reasonable and close enough to what you would expect as average pricing in Japan. The Soba was nothing surprising, an average tasting Soba with sub average amount of toppings (compared to those in Japan) but taking into thought that you're getting this quality here, not in NY City or LA or those fancy places where you can find tons of Japanese restaurants, I'd give a 4 stars.The only thing that really disturbed me was the service. I would expect to see an employee training session take place when there are no customers waiting for an order to be taken, let alone an argument between employer - employee. Also it was late afternoon around 3:30 and the seatings were light, and I saw couple of empty tables and many people ordering take-outs, so instead of taking the bar counter seat that I was initially guided to, I took one of the close by empty table. The lady looking over the hall ran up to me asking if I was alone and insisted on myself taking the bar counter. It made no sense to me seeing so many available seats but I took the suggested space at the counter, took out my cell phone and opened up my Yelp app, and now the lady gives me a table seat, saying that one would be OK because \"it can be moved\". Man, that made no sense AT ALL.I'd give the food a 3 star if this was Japan however giving 4 regarding the location, but taking away 2 for the service and adding 1 because if I don't I'd feel bad for myself driving more than 3 hours each just to get here."], ["Jamie P.", "Great food!

Of the three, the ramen broth was my favorite. The shrimp tempura is delicious and juicy. The curry rice is simple but delicous and savory comfort food. The tonkatsu is nothing special, and the potato croquette was pretty basic. The takoyaki was huge and had generous chunks of octopus in it, though if I could, I would recommend they add Japanese mayo as a topping.

They did have a few tofu options in their pre-made bento boxes, but most of those were sold by the time we got there. When I saw takoyaki on their menu, my inner 17 year old otaku screamed in delight. I've always wanted to try those little fried balls of octopus and dough. And they were totally worth it!

I would gladly step foot here instead of Sushi En after a terrible experience there, but the authenticity of these Fusion joints popping up everywhere proves to be questionable. OK, let's start this thing. Royal Ginger has taken over the shell of some recently dead restaurant, but they have made the inside quite pleasant and enjoyable to look at. You get a nice dark feel for a date night. They also have granite-esqe table tops. (WOAH!)The service here was not memorable. It was neither bad, nor excellent. Alcoholic Drink prices here are freaking ATROCIOUS. The plating here is gorgeous. Someone in the back is trying to impress.Think about how many times you've went out to a sushi place after the pictures looked phenomenal and then you get your plate and it's BORING. Well, Royal Ginger at least surpassed my expectations on that aspect. The Vietnamese Summer rolls we ordered were.... Alright. There was some herb in there just throwing me off, but the rest of the ingredients were good and the spicy duck sauce was the BOMB. We ordered a few rolls including some specialty ones, and everything was good and the quality was decent. I would highly recommend just their basic rolls above their specialty ones. Deep fried just doesn't do it for me and I found my husband's Rainbow Roll standing out above, because of the freshness. You'll probably leave stuffed and your bill will be typical of sushi dinner pricing, but on the moderate scale as opposed to the higher end range. This place is not the greatest in the area, but it is not terrible, either.

This is my second visit here- first visit was just ok, service wasn't that great but went again because of the reviews and the \"sushi\" special. We were unaware that they only had happy hour on Mondays and Tuesdays. The hostess which also ended up being our server came back after a long wait to bring water and then again after to take our beverage order- this is when she told us about the happy hour. I order a glass of wine off the menu as well as my friend who ordered a glass of Malbec wine , the server told us that she will have to check with the bar as the sometimes don't have it- she returned and they didn't have it, probably shouldn't be on the menu if it's a sometimes item that they carry . So she asked for a cup of decaf-hot tea - there seemed to be miscommunication on this so we requested a decaffeinated tea bag, she brought out a tea bag to show and apparently they do not have decaf tea, so she just stuck with water.We ordered edamame to share to start- it came with just a little plate to put the discarded pods on and no serving plates (I do like to have one for soy sauce) I helped myself to a couple of plates at the little table by the host stand as I didn't see there serve to ask. I ordered oshinko sushi and my friend ordered lettuce cups. \u00a0Lettuce cups came out after a bit but no sushi- \u00a0it took 10 minutes before the manager came out and apologized that they did not have that type of sushi, ok fine I ordered a California roll. (We did explain our disappointment about everything thus far in a really nice way- he said the menu will be changing and they aren't ordering some inventory.)Now her lettuce cups are not only cold but were so sweet they had to be drowned in soy sauce and it only helped a little. The California roll arrived- no chopsticks or little sauce tray /ramekin to mix wasabi and soy in- I got up once again and got a little plate to use. The roll was ok as a plan B but honestly the California roll you can buy at Kroger is better. I then ordered the chicken satay it was so tough like jerky, gristly and flavorless, almost like it wasn't fresh- I could not eat it. Throughout our evening the service continued to be quite slow and the manager never offered any kind of compensation- a return visit discount card / free app etc... I have college students working in restaurants- I understand having off nights- but as a manager you should offer some kind of restitution to invite your guests back to have a better experience. \u00a0When we left there was a van now parked so close behind my friends Jeep that she could not get out of the parking spot no matter how many times she tried to maneuver her vehicle she had to finally go inside and ask if they could help find the person to move the van -the manager said \"oh, I will take care of that right away\" because he apparently knew who the van belonged to and it turned out that it was one of his employees. The parking lot had plenty of empty spaces- couldn't he have parked in a different spot as to not block a customer in?"], ["Amanda G.", "On a whim, stopped by Royal Ginger for dinner after a movie one evening.

The veggie combo in the dish was wonderfully unexpected (mainly red bell peppers and butternut squash), and the brown sauce had great depth and flavor. The roasted cashews really made the dish, and I have ordered it again since my first trip. My hubby had Wok Glazed Ginger with chicken, and he also raved over his dish.

Kihachi offers unique (or to the Japanese patrons, authentic) tapas sized Japanese dishes in a somewhat hidden, nondescript strip mall on the northwest side of town.Wonderful little place with normal table seating, a bar, and tatami mat rooms. I've been here twice and I'd take a tatami rooms anyday because it gives you a chance to relax, sit back, eat and really enjoy the food and company in a private space. Since the dishes are somewhat smaller, we ordered quite a bit. They were all very tasty, and the ones I can recall are the mushrooms stuffed with shrimp, the fried rice ball in broth and the grilled mochi for desert. You need to be adventurous and avoid the traditional stuff, no other restaurant that I know of in Columbus serves what Kihachi serves. And the menu changes, based on what ingredients the chef has purchased. They can make rolls, nigiri, etc. but that's not what has made them famous.Service-wise our waiter was pretty attentive. He was caucasian and spoke Japanese. He helped translate the entire Japanese menu for us (the menu had about 20+ items on it). Now realize that you may not come out of Kihachi stuffed like you would coming out of Hometown Buffet. And Kihachi is definitely pricier then your normal Japanese restaurant.

Prior to dining here, i have prepared myself for the long wait of food. One of my friend told me that he waited over an hour the ramen. And his claims were all valid. I waited on average 30 minutes between courses, i order around 6.The meal started with the fluke sashimi and fish liver. I've never had the fish liver before, but it's good. It's a texture is soft and rich, but a lot lighter than duck liver.The second course was steamed duck with sake. It is served with soy sauce combination and wasabi blend. The duck was perfectly cooked and the wasabi blend (i think it was wasabi and mustard) added extra flavor.then another 30 minute wait.....The third course was the pork cheek. This was the highlight of the meal. It was delicious. juicy and so flavorful.The forth course was braised sea eel. This one was one of my least favorite. It was basically unagi, braised with eggs and vegetables. The braising reduces both the texture and the flavor of the unagi. It was really bland.The fifth course was the beef tataki. This one is classic dish done well. The beef was really fresh.The sixth course was one the rice with the. It was ok. In conclusion, some are good, some are bad. If you really want to try this place just remember to eat something first and research what to order.

Maybe all the hype that has spun off from Anthony Bourdain's praises has shrouded some peoples eyes from the reality of the experience. I am also willing to admit that we may have gone on an off night. However, this time, Tony, I disagree.I am not a boring eater. I am an exciting eater. I will eat anything, and I will often like it. I eat a ton of authentic Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese food as they are my absolute favorites. I even like Durian for god's sake!The experience started out pleasant with reservations and a tatami room, stepping in after leaving our shoes outside. Fifteen minutes go by and water is served and menus materialize. Another 15 minutes go by and the waitress comes to take our orders. She asks if we want to specials in English and acts annoyed when we says yes. She then storms out of the tatami room and does not return for another 15 minutes during which time she hurriedly explains the specials in English. At this time we are still excited about the food. If Kihachi was packed or we were slurping back sake I would have easily forgiven these time delays. We proceed to order baby octopus, fermented squid, some fatty tuna, some giant prawns, and multiple other items on the menu including two fish specials. The waitress is incredulous of our selections and asks us several times if these are the things that we would like to order or would we rather have something else. Hello? I think I know what I'm ordering.Another 50 minutes go by and the waitress at long last brings the dishes-- all of them at once. Not one at a time and not appetizer before entree. Yes, it is all edible. Yes, it is all pretty, but so are the things that you can get at kroger's sushi station or fish section. That doesn't mean they always taste good. We eat almost everything, but are left wanting more and not in a good way, hoping that every bite would fulfill all of our expectations and make up for the service which verged on insulting.After all of this, the plates are cleared and we patiently wait another 30 minutes for our bill and are not asked about dessert, drinks, etc. Essentially we are ignored. Then come the bill. Behold! There is an extra charge for the tatami room. We did not ask for the room ahead of time or at arrival. We were also not told there would be a charge for the room. We were seated in the room despite the fact that there was space at regular tables. Ugh. Kihachi I want so badly to love you, why do you do this to me?

For starters, the menu is (hand!)written half in Japanese, half in rather cryptic English, so you're exactly sure what you're getting. But when the food arrives, it's gorgeous, employs plenty of umami, a lot of finesse and little fuss. This, to me, is the essence of Japanese anything.It's a little pricey, but well worth it for the amount of attention and care put into every plate.

No, they are great.It just means that the chefs will serve all of your appetizers first, one by one, before they cook your main course and that is why sometimes it took so long for your food to come out. Imagine this... you came with your friend, you decided that you just want to eat the main course, but your buddy ordered 3 kind of appetizers and a main course. What will happen is you have to wait for your friend's appetizers to be served first before your dinner came out and... there goes an hour of waiting for you. Therefore it is recommended for you to share the food or order for the group so that nobody have to wait for too long. Maybe the idea of sharing food is strange for you, but in Asian culture we usually share food with families and friends. Considering Kihachi is an Asian restaurant, maybe you should try to share the food. So here is my suggestion:1. Come in a small group2. Preferably go there on Monday to Thursday3. Share the food/order for the group4. Sit at the bar that is the best seat in the house5. Have fun, enjoy your food while chatting with your friendsLastly, I often eat in Kihachi, based on my past experiences, the food does not take that long to come out. The last time I ate there, I came at 6 p.m, we ordered 7 appetizers with 2 entrees and we finished in 7.30 p.m. Which is not bad considering the amount of our orders.

All four of us have traveled internationally, and while we are not hardcore \"foodies,\" we do enjoy nice meals and appreciate quality. We had been here once before, in December 2010, for our anniversary and really enjoyed it then also. From the opening dish of sea urchin, sea cucumber, and another tasty treat I didn't catch the name of, my sister-in-laws were in love. We had ordered the Chef's Choice, which must be reserved a couple of days in advance, so each course was a surprise. The chef continually made us ooh and aah with his presentation and the food itself left us often speechless or uuummmming our appreciation. Just some highlights: soft shell crab, the best sashimi I have ever tasted, duck with a dab of hot mustard, fresh water shrimp, and the finish: Hawaiian Blue Prawn with black lava sea salt. All wonderful. As many other reviewers have said, this is a traditional Japanese restaurant. I read the reviews mentioning service issues and didn't really give them much mind, but my wife was a bit irked last night. Her tea was only refilled once and she had to ask several times for water during our nearly 3 hour stay. The rest of us ordered alcohol, and we were fine. I am willing to deal with some service problems when the rest of the experience is as great as it is, but some of you may be more concerned about that. Having ordered the Chef's Choice, which is very pricey $400 for four of us, and ordered off the \u00e0 la carte, I would recommend just ordering \u00e0 la carte items. You can save some money that way. Order a variety and be adventurous.On the other hand, the Chef's Choice exposes you to items you may have never heard of or thought to try, so that should be part of the consideration. To sum up, my wife is perturbed by the service she received but is still willing to go back, and I think the food is so wonderful I'd serve it myself and drink water from the tap if they made me. One last note, sit at the counter. Watching the chef use his knives on fish is like watching an artist paint."], ["Danielle F.", "I have been to Kihachi twice. I was sent with high expectations - neither time was I disappointed.I had similar meals both times. As others have stated, the focus is the appetizers - the appetizer menu is considerably larger than the entree menu. The entrees have large portions and are not that expensive ($8-20 - very affordable). The appetizers and desserts, on the other hand, are very small, pricier, and while the entrees are good, the appetizers and desserts are what really impress.In my two trips, I have tried their edamame, press box sushi (two kinds - a mackeral and snapper), abalone sushi, and tempura vegetables.The edamame is incredible (being so simple, I'm not sure how it was so much better than any edamame I've had anywhere else, but it was somehow a cut above). The abalone was not great - it was just too chewy and without a lot of flavor (characteristic of the dish, not the chef). Tempura vegetables are pretty standard, and these were too - good, nothing extraordinary. The pressbox sushi were highly recommended by a professor, and they exceeded all expectations. It has been to long since I had them for me to attempt to describe them in any detail, but I will say they are pressed with citrus - which really adds something special. The pressbox sushi are in the \"specials\" section of the menu - written only in Japanese - so listen when the waiter is describing them.I've had two entrees - teriyaki steak and a small bowl of sashimi with rice. Both came with miso soup (delicious) and a small salad with a delicious house sesame-based dressing. The steak was a generous size, and very tender. The sashimi was also excellent.I've tried a few of the desserts. I highly recommend the herbal mochi. Mochi is a rice dough, in this case filled with a (sweet) bean paste, wrapped in a banana leaf, and grilled. If you haven't tried mochi, no description will really suffice to describe it - I highly recommend trying it. They offer three kinds of mochi for dessert, the herbal was my favorite.As others have noted, the service is not impressive. Planning on being proactive / slightly aggressive about drink refills will be to your benefit. Do not come here if you are in a rush.

You wonder just how well they can get a mix of Americanized \"Chinese\", \"Korean\", \"Thai\", \"Japanese\" and more. A little too good to be true?That's right. You know that old saying, cheap, fast or good; pick two? That overwhelmingly applies here. Its very cheap and served very fast, so it inevitably lacks in the 'good' department.

The crab rangoon was pretty awesome (but you only get 4!)My problem with this place? The flavor and the tofu. The dishes are either spicy hot or bland with very little in the middle. My first time around, I ordered General Tso's tofu. I like a little spice, but after too much, I just become a wreck of nasal discharge. It wasn't long before I hit that threshold. And the spice was just spicy by itself. No savory flavor backing to even it out. The second time around was the Homestyle tofu. Again, just kind of...blah, like they just used a splash of soy and that was it. As for the tofu, they - unfortunately - reinforce that stereotype of it tasting like a bland sponge. Tofu is supposed to absorb the flavor of whatever you cook it in, but it has to be drained first. To me, it tastes like they just cut it up and toss it in. The pieces are juicy, yet flavorless and never really take on the taste of the dish. Even after reheating, the tofu is just chewy and bland.

The woman who took my order was somehow able to keep track of a variety of customers. The order goes to the cooks, and then they give the prepared dishes back to her. She matches them with the orders, put them together as needed, and brings them to the customers. No idea how the non-takeout is organized.I brought it home, and the sushi (rainbow roll, to be specific) was actually pretty good. I mean, I'm not writing home about it, but it was comparable in quality to what you might find in the Whole Foods fridge (the one on Lane, that is -- the one in Dublin is much better for sushi) and was a couple of bucks less expensive and a lot fresher.The tempura, however, was oily, oily, oily. The veggies inside were good (especially the sweet potato), but there was nothing light about the batter. I can feel it settling at the pit of my stomach even now.In sum, I might return for sushi.

You can also opt for different types of protein (i.e. half salmon, half yellowtail), although keep in mind that they'll charge you for the price of the more expensive option.The quality of the fish isn't too bad either (not amazing, but definitely not old or fishy), and you have a good selection of toppings/fillings to choose from (avocado, cucumber, cream cheese, etc). I never thought that sushi could be a fast food, but Fusian has not only proven me wrong, but also convinced me that it is a brilliant option for fast food!"], ["Lin H.", "I'm really happy with my experience at Fusian! Like everyone else has said, it really is a Chipotle-style for sushi rolls. I enjoyed building my own tuna roll, and found the staff to be helpful when I told them I'd never been there before. One thing I do think they need to improve on is their presentation of food. Honestly, the display layout is just not working in their benefit. It is similar to Chipotle or Piada, but with sushi ingredients it looks meek and limited in options. Also, the way the ingredients were prepared was not appetizing. For example, the green onions were long and cut into 3-4 inch bits and looking wilty, and the avocado was already cut, sitting in the open, and browning. In my opinion, the green onions would look much better if diced up and it would be very impressive if the avocado was cut in front of you. It's the little things that count, essentially!"], ["Jason W.", "Sushi made to order \"chipotle style\". \u00a0Sort of an odd concept and not what I expected under the heading of asian fusion. \u00a0Everything was nice and fresh and tasty though. \u00a0I had spicy tuna and it was very good. \u00a0Side of seaweed salad was just OK. \u00a0On-par quality wise with the kind of sushi you get in a good grocery store. \u00a0The agave flavored ice tea drinks were very good."], ["Jen T.", "I love this place. \u00a0Keep in mind that it's not a full-on sushi bar; they have a short menu of wrap, protein, veg, and sauce (think: \u00a0certain other fast-casual Mexican joint with the same concept :) ) and the idea is to get people in and out the door quickly, which makes perfect sense on a college campus.Conveniently located about a block north of the Campus Gateway, this is a great spot to grab a quick meal before seeing a movie. \u00a0My bf and I were there on a Monday night during OSU's summer break, so the place wasn't very busy. \u00a0We moved to the front of the restaurant and ordered our food right away. \u00a0The people behind the counter were attentive, although perhaps not as informed as one might like--we asked if the tofu was organic and they didn't know. \u00a0We also tried to find out the health benefits of seaweed vs. soy wrappers, but didn't have any luck with that question either (although, asking similar kinds of questions at a Panera, McD's, etc. would probably yield the same result). \u00a0However, the staff was able to tell us what paired well and what was popular with the ingredient of the month--mango. \u00a0I definitely like that they have a rotating ingredient to mix things up a bit.Just like the restaurant-I-won't-name-because-it's-so-obvious, you pick out your wrap, your protein, your veg, and your sauce. \u00a0You can choose to do different combinations of protein, veg, and sauce on each half of the roll if you're looking for a bit of variety. \u00a0The end of the line also involves selecting toppings like tempura and sesame seeds.Prices range from $7-$9 per roll depending on what protein you select. \u00a0I like to fill mine with several kinds of veggies, which makes the roll plenty full and one roll ends up being enough.I love watching the preparation of the rolls--from the assembly, to using that fancy cutting machine, to applying generous globs of spicy mayo and sweet soy sauce. \u00a0The final product is a brightly colored combination, and I think, a feast for the eyes (although, I suppose they could go a tad lighter on the sauces).The dining room itself seats ~50 people, with a mix of small tables for two, to larger rectangular tables intended to seat 8 or 10, so during peak times, be prepared to share one of these large tables. \u00a0The decor is kept simple, sort of a modern industrial look with concrete tables and contemporary chairs and benches.Upon exiting, you'll notice that Fusian has different bins for composting, recycling, and trash. \u00a0At a Yelp Elite event, we had the opportunity to talk with the creators of Fusian, and they felt that being environmentally responsible was part of their mission. \u00a0I appreciate that businesses take extra steps like this to be good environmental stewards.As of this posting (May 2014), this is the only Columbus location, with stores in Dayton and Cincy. \u00a0I think the concept could do well elsewhere in Columbus, should they decide to expand. \u00a0I don't live near campus, but was in the area for a movie, and I was very much looking forward to a quick, affordable dinner here. \u00a0I'm sure other neighborhoods in Columbus would also delight in such an opportunity."], ["Shea H.", "FINALLY got a chance to try Fusian. \u00a0It was good... I liked my rolls. \u00a0It's just that, I thought the rolls were really expensive to be a fast-food, college-student-run, fake sushi shop. \u00a0Four rolls cost about $30 and two of the four rolls were veggie-based. \u00a0 Mind you, this is a make-your-own-rolls type place... so your meal is not guaranteed to be good. \u00a0I don't know what foods compliment each other in sushi-world. \u00a0And there were no recommendations on the menu or in-person. \u00a0The price pretty much ruin the meal for me. \u00a0I couldn't even focus...I just kept looking at the menu and the receipt wondering where I went wrong. Oh- and my rolls fell apart. \u00a0Even with the use of a rolling-machine, my rolls were still poorly made. \u00a0And Fusian offers no brown rice.The sushi-makers literally looked like they rolled out of their dorm-room bed and came to work. \u00a0Wrinkled clothing. \u00a0Messy hair. \u00a0I suppose that I should just be grateful that they used gloves.And hard-as-hell seats throughout the restaurant. \u00a0Narrow walk ways, I would have to stand to the side and wait for others to pass or vice versa.Good luck with parking. \u00a0Street parking can be hit or miss. \u00a0There's a garage not very far away, though. \u00a0Maybe costs a dollar? I can't remember.I wouldn't recommend this place."], ["Chelsea J.", "Hi. My name is Chelsea and I am absolutely addicted to sushi. Haha. No but seriously, let me tell ya, this place is IT. The vibe is very organic/natural. The ordering is chipotle-esk, you go through the line and get your rice, protein, veggies then top it off with your sauce and garnishes. Loved it. The veggies (asparagus, avocado, peppers carrots) are not extra--so pile it up-- but the meat you choose is the price point. It will take you from $7.50-9ish. Very affordable, and I was nice and full after our visit. Fusion gets a.... THUMBS UP :)"], ["Maribeth B.", "Not even close to real sushi. Made me really sick.

The campus location is a bit inconvenient to get to (very little parking) but otherwise Fusian is a great choice!"], ["Emily L.", "I have recently become a big fan of sushi, and as I am a strict vegetarian ( YES that does include NOT eating fish), this place is a WIN! since at some sushi restaurants I have gotten sick since they have made the \u00a0veg sushi on the same plates/ areas of sushi with fish in it, I love that you can see them making the sushi right in front of you. You walk in to a place that looks just like chioptle. You place your order of type of wrap and rice then you just go down the line of what you want to add in. It has interesting adds that you normally wouldnt see at a typical sushi place such as beef, chicken, and tofu. It also has a wide selection of vegetables to add in ( asparagrus, green peppers, red peppers, onions etc) . You can be in and out of this place in 10 mins tops. Also its REALLY well priced, I can get a 9 roll sushi for $6.00, and its large too!"], ["Kenny Y.", "I do like the concept of this place.However, in order to make rolls efficiently, Fusian's sushi rice is prepared in a way such that it is particularly sticky and easily molded. \u00a0By doing this, the sushi rice tastes somewhat stale, kind of like the sushi you would get in a college cafeteria. \u00a0Also, they don't add much fish to the rolls, such that you really taste more rice than fish (unless, of course, you pay extra for double fish). \u00a0As for the price point, I think it's pretty reasonable. \u00a0Get a lot of extra veggies in your rolls to make it worth it.If I was a student here, I might come here for quick, customizable, cafeteria-like sushi. \u00a0But as a visitor to Columbus, not really worth it."], ["Holly C.", "Why wouldn't you like what's essentially a sushi cafe where you can order sushi to your liking as if you were at a Chipotle? If you're a sushi fan, this is definitely a place to check out. The prices are reasonable, and you get a lot of different choices. The variety is what keeps food from being boring and you can enjoy a variety of combinations every time you go. Whenever I'm in the campus area, I like to stop by because I prefer cooked sushi so I get the steak or shrimp as protein, fill it with assorted veggies, and get sauce drizzled on top or on the side in a cup. Certain toppings or additions are an extra charge so be sure to pay attention to that. I love adding masago (+$1) to top it off. It creates awesome texture and flavor!"], ["Lindy K.", "I was really excited to try sushi in Columbus, particularly a place rated so high...but I really don't \u00a0understand the high ratings. \u00a0Maybe this would be a good place for people who haven't ever tried sushi and are kind of nervous about it? Or don't actually like sushi. I don't know. Nothing seemed particularly fresh-which is pretty important for sushi. And nothing was particularly flavorful or interesting. You can get better sushi at the grocery store for pretty much the same price or cheaper. The place is clean and the employees were nice, but since this rating is for the food, my advice is to pass."], ["Andrew W.", "Fusian can be described as nothing shy of...nifty! More and more I see stores branching out into \"Chipotle-style\" restaurants, but I never thought I'd see the day where we had made-to-order carryout sushi.

There's a myriad of options when it comes to picking your fillings and (my favorite part) seasonal veggies! Yum-o, indeed. If you're looking for a fast, delicious sushi entree; Fusian is your place. Is the sushi going to be gourmet? Nah. Are you going to be enjoying your sushi within five minutes of walking into the store? Probably. Will your taste buds tingle and will you be left satisfied with a fresh, locally sourced meal? Definitely."], ["Lea P.", "This is gonna sound weird, but the more I come here, the less I adore it. Weird because if that's the case, why do I keep coming? I guess because I want to get back what I remember from my first few visits.I was first at Fusian for a fabulous Yelp event a while back and was anxious to return and rate it on its own merits. The concept is terrific: build your own sushi roll out of adequately fresh ingredients, including but not limited to raw fish, and embellish it with a selection of toppings. Have it made to order, have it fast, and have it cheap. What's not to love?For starters, not all ingredient combos are fabulous together. I find as a \"seagan\" i have more options here than I have at Chipotle or Bibibop, so I get something different -- sometimes radically different -- every time. And they aren't always awesome. Since I've never had a disappointing combo at those other types of assembly line fast food joints, it would be great if the same were possible here. I could get a five-star sushi roll every time I came here, but even I have a tuna-avocado roll limit when the options are so close to infinite. If I stick to the same thing, it should be because that thing is that great, not because the alternatives aren't.So I'm not really a fan of the shrimp for the sushi, I think. Have yet to be impressed with the sides I've ordered. The miso soup, for instance, is not very flavorful; I've put soy sauce in to jazz it up. The seasonal veggie is hit or miss. Right now they've got bean sprouts there, and those could potentially be spiffy with the right combo, but last fall's sweet potatoes? Well... as I said, I get experimental here. And those things did not belong in my roll. They might have belonged in someone's roll. But not mine. Finally, I'm not crazy about the soy wrap. They recommend it for sushi beginners, but I don't think it's going to \"wrap up\" any sushi converts, honestly. I found it bland, with a texture that did not allow easy teeth-sinking-into like seaweed does.I'm gonna keep going back, though. Because it is entirely possible to get an A+ roll out of the place. The problem is that I've only done that by playing it safe, yet playing it safe is not what a build-your-own place is designed for. And I'd need to admit that there's still something *fun* about building your own. And the price justifies the risk when there's fun involved."], ["Victoria N.", "Restaurant is nice and inviting. Everything is fresh and menu is self explaining. Everyone that works there is nice and kick ass! My boyfriend makes me come here everytime he visits from Terre Haute, Indiana. I do not complain.

If you don't consider this sushi, and consider it a \"rice roll in seaweed wrapper with mixed vegetables and proteins\", then I would call it at least average. It's still less quality then the bento sushi that Tensuke off old henderson road sells.It's not even so much the quality for me, but more the complete lack of regard for the fish IN the sushi.

Smoked salmon is listed under raw, but I'm pretty sure that's not a fish. In fact, I think it might be smoked. Choose a wrap, a protein, some veggies and toppings and you're done. You end up with about two rolls for $6-9; not bad. They have some fancy roll cutter that does the cutting for them, which is kind of lame. And, like chipotle, they should serve beer!!!The roll was just fine, decor is clean like you'd expect from chipotle imitators, workers wearing Columbus shirts.

I never had ramen served in a stone pot before. They have usually been reserved for my Korean rice dishes. Judging the presentation, it was sloppily thrown together. I couldn't even find the eggs at first! They were flipped over making me lose the yolk. When I took a bite into an egg, it tasted like pure alcohol. I was not what I expected in my ramen, and at this point I was already feeling over it. Noodles were over cooked and felt like I was eating baby food.

Overlooked noodles really ruin a dish.I was disappointed, and I am still in search for ramen that reminds me of home."], ["Gina M.", "I was SO excited for Rishi, and unfortunately I was disappointed with my visit. It was my first pick for Restaurant Week 2015, and sadly it didn't live up to expectations. For $25, they had a 3-course special for restaurant week, which seemed like a good deal. I gathered some friends and headed over to Rishi around 7:00 on a Tuesday. We sat out on the patio because the weather was nice; I was pleasantly surprised to see some open tables there. The patio was a good idea until the umbrella for the table fell over and almost killed me. But I can't be mad at them for that, I'll say blame the umbrella directly. But anyway, after the umbrella attack, the server came back to take our drink/food orders, and I chose the 3 courses from the restaurant week menu. An appetizer (salmon sushi panini), a regular sushi roll (California), and an entree (pork ramen). A friend I had with me is a vegetarian and does not eat fish. She wanted to order the chicken teriyaki and replace the chicken for tofu. The server said that was not an option so she requested all veggies in a teriyaki sauce. When her food came out, I was shocked to see a pile of rice with 4 slices of sauteed pepper laid over it, no sauce. Then they brought out the chicken on the side with the sauce on it... Needless to say, it wasn't what she requested and they weren't very accommodating to our vegetarian friend.After our party of 4 put in our orders, we waited for probably 30 minutes before our appetizers were brought out. At this point I was very hungry and hot from having to ditch the shade of the umbrella, so I really enjoyed my sushi panini. One positive note about Rishi is the originality of this sushi panini magic! It looks cool, it's fun to eat, and it tastes good! I would definitely have one of those again. Unfortunately though, the good food stopped there in my opinion.Our sushi was brought out about 15 minutes after our appetizers, and my sushi roll was about half the size I was expecting. It was totally average, nothing special to report. In fact it almost reminded me of the little sushi rolls you can buy from Giant Eagle... not something you would get from an authentic sushi restaurant.On to the entrees, we received those 20 minutes after sushi (we've been here well over an hour at this point if you're keeping track) and I was not impressed with the ramen I had been so excited for. Granted, it might be me, I might just hate ramen, but I thought it was incredibly salty, and it tasted almost dirty. I was expecting a clear broth similar to wonton soup, and the broth was almost more of a stew with a thick, goopy sauce. The pork was fine, but it was very fatty and not very flavorful.Our server did apologize several times for the food taking a while, but if you can't keep up with a full house knowing that it's restaurant week, then you need to re-evaluate your staffing. A party of 2 who came in after us were told that it would take over an hour just for sushi... that is not acceptable.To sum it all up, I was attacked by an umbrella, ate some average sushi and some goopy soup, and my vegetarian friend went home hungry. But I had some time out on a patio downtown with friends so it wasn't a total loss!"], ["Pam F.", "I've only been here for lunch a couple of times, but looking at their full menu, I definitely want to try dinner sometime. The waitstaff are very pleasant, and they have both al fresco and in house dining. The edamame hummus is quite good, as are the Mahi Mahi tacos. Absolutely loved discovering the Sushi Panini!!! \u00a0They are to die for, although must be shared because otherwise, I think I'd go into a food coma if I ate all of them (and this is just an appetizer).

The ambiance is spot on: contemporary, vibrant, inviting, and clean. \u00a0We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, as well as the smiling bar tender as we passed, and promptly by our server, who rocked it out from start to finish. \u00a0He was prompt, attentive, cheerful, and most of all informative. \u00a0He provided helpful information on the sake menu (I never remember what I like, am I alone?!) and described one of the special so well that we decided to take a risk and try a dish we have certainly never tried before. \u00a0We started with a BEAUTIFUL and quite tasty presentation of conch, sashimi style. \u00a0The protein was thinly sliced and fanned out along the conch shell itself along with an orchid. \u00a0It turned out to be delicious, and to make things even better, when we asked the silly question if we could keep the shell for our preschooler who has been asking if someday he can hear the ocean in a shell, he gladly accommodated us by cleaning it out and putting it in bag. \u00a0The things we do for our kids!We also tried several other delicious things on this visit. \u00a0The sushi was on point. It was all fresh, innovative, and delicious. \u00a0What stands out to me is an appetizer we ordered called \"sushi panini\" which is rice patties acting as bread, coated in panko bread crumbs, and fried in a pan with your choice of filling; we went with tuna and I'd recommend you do the same. \u00a0I look forward to returning with my friends sometime soon. \u00a0With 3 different palates and food restrictions, we have trouble finding a place we all like. While neither of us ordered ramen nor burgers, their presence on the menu makes it easier to please a crowd. \u00a0Can't wait to return!"], ["Rachel W.", "I am not a sushi person, but have had burgers here 3 times now. They have this burger (I think it is called Morning something) that has a fried egg and some other shredded veggies on top. It comes with fries. It is really good, though stacked super high and the bun is high too, so don't get it if you are trying to appear neat and tidy/impress your boss with your manners.I have always had good service here, and the interior is really cool. Modern and with the whole wall of windows to watch traffic and people on 3rd, it is a nice place."], ["Arvid Y.", "3.5 Stars.I enjoyed the food and drinks at Rishi, but I was not enamored enough to award them 4 stars. Everything was good, but not great. The interior is clean and modern, but somewhat cold and impersonal. I do like their concept of Asian fusion however. I don't think i've ever been to a restaurant that serves sushi, ramen and burgers all on one menu. Whether they do all these things well remains to be seen, since I only ordered sushi.We ordered the sushi panini to start off. You get a choice of spicy tuna, salmon or crab. We picked tuna and enjoyed the dish very much. It was actually my favorite dish. The crispy panko rice added some much appreciated texture. It was like eating a deep fried sushi roll.We also ordered two sushi rolls to share: J-mynt and Mr. Kim rolls. The names are pretty random. The rolls were just okay. I think the habanero salsa on the Mr. Kim roll overpowered the actual taste of the fish. A pet peeve of mine is overly dressed rolls. But for people who like spicy sauces on sushi, this may be your place.Another reason for the 3.5 star rating is the price to quantity ratio. Even though there are 7-8 rolls per order, the portion size is still on the smaller side. At $14 an order, it may not be the best value. However, their rolls are half-off during happy hour, so you should visit during those times.Rishi's drinks were actually surprisingly good. My friend ordered an Oasis, which she enjoyed. I didn't take a sip, but she said it tasted very \"coconutty.\" I got the Peaceful which was a whiskey-based drink resembling a Manhattan. It was delicious. The fact that it was garnished with a piece of waffle was also neat, unfortunately the waffle tasted a bit stale. Overall, I had a good first experience at Rishi. I wasn't blown away, but i'll be back to try their ramen and burgers (probably not at the same time)."], ["Andy P.", "VERY price for sashimi or nigiri. Just ridiculous. BUT...ramen is amazing. I've had beef and seafood, and they are worth the effort of finding parking. In this downtown eatery. Beer could be colder, medium selection of wine, and sake selection okay at best. Of the salads, LOVE the beet salad with the vinaigrette over fresh pear cubes. This was my second trip, and there will be more, but not to buy sashimi or nigiri."], ["Sara S.", "just ok. Overpriced. This is the only sushi restaurant walking distance from our house downtown Columbus, so we'll probably be back but I wish there was another sushi place with more reasonable prices."], ["John S.", "Great happy hour specials, if you like sushi rolls.The regular sushi is quite good, too.Great service and great cocktails, including one that has a waffle as a garnish - which was really good.I've been here more than once - rasing the rating! :)"], ["Moriah G.", "Something for everyone! Personally, I love sushi. I know not everyone does but I could still bring a friend to have a burger, some loaded fries and Golden Eggs and Ham. Worth trying!"], ["Richard P.", "Rishi anchors a quiet end of Downtown from a dining standpoint, just north of the end of the Gay Street commercial strip. \u00a0It's a welcome addition, open relatively late (11PM) on Friday and Saturday nights, which is nice if you happen to be downtown and hungry, as we were. \u00a0They have valet parking right out front, but honestly folks, this is Columbus, Ohio - as long as you're willing to circle the block a couple of times, there's plenty of on-street parking. \u00a0It's not like you'll have an epic search for a space like in Philly or NYC.The restaurant itself has a young, hip vibe, although that doesn't mean you'll be out of place if you're not. \u00a0One word of warning - avoid the uppermost end of the lower floor in the winter - the staff walks in and out of the doors at that end, and you will freeze when the cold air comes through the doors.The menu is roughly broken into three things - sushi, burgers, ramen. \u00a0Echoing Shuo F., this is Asian fusion food, not traditional dishes. \u00a0So as long as that's your mindset, it's a pretty decent meal. \u00a0My burger was topped with kimchi, Korean doenjang bean paste, and accompanied by truffle fries; basically a burger with an Asian spin, the same way the Crest would give you a burger with a Middle Eastern spin.As for the ramen, how pleased you will be with it will largely depend on your yardstick. \u00a0If you're looking for traditional ramen like you would find at Minca in NYC or Yamadaya in LA, this is not your place. \u00a0If you're looking for a nice bowl of wavy noodles in soup, it's pretty solid, especially on a cold winter night. \u00a0The broth is rich and flavorful, and shows that they care about the way they cook their food.As my wife said, \"It's 11PM in Columbus, Ohio, and I can get a bowl of 'ramen' downtown. \u00a0What is there to complain about?\""], ["Lauren L.", "It really saddens to me write this. I have been to Rishi a half a dozen time, and my partner loves the ramen but this visit was absolutely ridiculous. 4:15 on a Tuesday, for at least 30 minutes I was literally the only person in there. I helped myself to a seat at the sushi bar, and was handed menus (not even happy hour menu, when happy hour started at 4:30) as the server was walking away, without an introduction or anything, I had to yell out can I start with a crab salad please? About 5 minutes later the sushi chef hands it over the glass to me. After I had finished my appetizer, and after about 15 minutes of me looking around and making awkward eye contact with the sushi chef, who was patiently waiting for my order, he said \"uh are you ready? Uh okay here I'll just take it.\" He then proceeded to ring a bell and yell up to the two servers upstairs talking. A server came down and looked at the paper I had handed the sushi chef, went to the computer, and just like that was gone again. I would have loved a glass of wine with my dinner, but was never asked if I would like anything....fast forward about 6 minutes..the sushi chef tries to reach out and hands me my sushi. Never once did a server come over to ask me if everything was good, if I would like anything else, or even fill my water glass. About 7 minutes after I put my chopsticks on my plate indicating I was done, the sushi chef again looks at me and asked if everything was ok. I proceeded to tell him it was fine, but I was waiting on my server to ask for a box and my check. Again, he had to yell to someone (a third person, not the one to lay menus or ring my food in) who gave me a check and boxed my food. I didn't even bother to order dinner to go for my family as I had planned on doing. Top 5 worst dining experience I've had, server wise. The food was mediocre. Waste of an hour of my time and $20+. And for that alone, I will not be back."], ["Lea P.", "I happened to be searching for a business that previously existed at this address when I saw the \"coming soon\" sign a couple of days ago. Sushi. Coming soon. That's even better than what I was planning to find. I'm so there.Rishi had their grand opening last night, and I came in for lunch today. It's a beautiful space, very classy. They do sushi, yes, but also ramen and Asian-inspired burgers. I was here, of course, for the sushi. The hostess asked if I had a preference between the sushi bar or a table. I didn't, so she went sushi bar. It's their first lunch open, so while it was pretty empty at 11am, they probably couldn't know how busy they'd get in an hour or two. The sushi chefs said hi as I sat down, and my server Phil was over very soon to give me a rundown on the restaurant: they get fish in three times a week, so it's very fresh; the ramen is made with a two-day preparation process (that means nothing to me, maybe it does to more frequent ramen eaters); and baked goods come locally from the Angry Baker.I decided to go simple and just order the Sushi Lunch, which is a tuna roll and five pieces of nigiri. I got a seaweed salad starter and a cup of hot tea.The tea came with two tea bag options, genmaicha and sencha, both green types, from a brand I hadn't tried before. The genmaicha was good, and Phil was attentive with the extra hot water when I got close to the bottom of the cup.The seaweed salad was tasty, with grapes mixed in.The sushi was definitely worth coming here for. There is an extensive list of specialty rolls I look forward to trying, but for today I was content with the basic lunch. The fish was definitely fresh, and the salmon in particular felt like silk in my mouth. While the sushi chef was preparing it, he asked me over the counter whether I wanted wasabi inside the nigiri. This made me happy -- so many places in Columbus just put it in, and I'm not a huge wasabi fan -- I said no, I'd prefer it just on the side, and thanked him for asking. He said it is normally put in there; I don't know if folks sitting at tables would end up getting the same offer/question.Mid-meal, Phil came over to check on me and asked if I needed anything else. Actually, yeah... the lunch was supposed to come with miso soup, I thought? He looked upset with himself, apologetic: You're right, he said, it was, and he had forgotten to mention that they didn't have the miso in yet. It was his fault, and he'd see if there was anything else he could get me. A minute later he offered salad, which sounded fine to me. Brand new place, there was bound to be a slip-up, and this was it, but the handling is what matters, and that was hitchless.\"Servers,\" said the sushi chef to me jokingly with a wink when he walked away.The salad was a simple one with a very nice dressing. I'd have preferred it before the sushi, and it was a little redundant since I'd had the seaweed salad, but it was an appreciated consolation for the missing soup. I look forward to having that soup next time!The location is split into several spaces: the sushi bar, the booze bar, and two table seating areas, one on the main floor and another up the stairs to a loft-type area. The decor is chic and modern, and there is a large flat-screen TV on the wall behind the sushi bar, tuned to Fox Sports while I was there (boxing and then poker were on). Everyone I interacted with was super-friendly and interested in providing a good meal and experience.

For appetizer I had the salmon sushi panini, which is basically a spicy salmon roll wrapped in breaded rice patties. This was actually super good! I think I could just order 10 of these to eat! \u00a0For entree I ordered the Rishi burger, which is a 7oz burger patty topped with truffle mashed potatoes, bacon, a sunny side up egg, and brown Japanese curry. The burger also came with a side of truffle fries. The presentation of the meal was very nice. A big juicy burger was placed in front of me and they had to give me plastic gloves to eat the burger! However, the burger lacked flavor. All I could taste was the Japanese curry. At least the meal was filling, but definitely not worth the $14.Overall, I think the restaurant had some good ideas for their menu items. That's a plus since it's a fusion restaurant, but the burger I had lacked flavor and was overpriced.

Seriously though...anything that had kimchi on or in it was so good. Keep in mind that I really like ripe and flavorful kimchi. The oysters were fresh and didn't taste fishy, and the two nigiri pieces that I got - uni and masago - were fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the spicy crab sushi panini, it's quite innovative, and who doesn't loved fried sushi? My friends thought their burgers were fine, and I had a few friends that thought the ramen was just okay. I tried a little bit of the ramen and wasn't very impressed. It's lacking a depth in the broth of traditional Japanese ramen, but keep in mind, this tastes quite fusion to me. The passionfruit creme brulee could've been a little thicker in my opinion, but that's my personal preference.

She also repeatedly tried to take our unfinished food and box it up even though we had only been eating for 10 minutes. If the staff aren't gossiping in corners they are running up and down the stairs and almost took me out when they didn't see me going up them. The table behind us only got half their order because the waitress \"forgot\" to enter it in. The tables are glossy and the busboys clean them with windex.

Of. God. Okay so I'm from the bay area where fried banana/plantain for dessert is on the menu at many an Asian joint. Some with ice cream, some with other dipping sauces, some with drizzled condensed milk....yea whatever.

I'm not sure why no one has ever thought to do that at any of the spots I've been to yet, but damn was MY MIND BLOWN.

Pretty sure that because the \"batter\" for the plantain had all that fragrant coconut oil in it already (as opposed to a more high-water content batter), the whole confection stayed suuuuuuper crispy for as long as it could stay on the plate. Before we devoured it.So. Good. Seriously guys, do it."], ["Farrah F.", "I'm up in Columbus for the weekend to visit a couple friends between rotations (and because I've never been here before)! :] It was a little past 9 p.m. by the time I finally got here, so my friend suggested Lemongrass since it was still open, and because we were in the mood for Asian [fusion] food. This definitely fit the bill! :DWe were seated very quickly. Pretty much everything on the menu sounded amazing (it probably didn't help that we were super super hungry), so we ordered...the Chicken Sate as an appetizer, as well as a Chicken Pad Thai and the Lemongrass Roll (spicy tuna roll topped with fresh salmon + smoked BBQ eel), and the fried plantain dessert (coconut + sesame-coated plantain, fried + served with coconut sorbet--I think the sorbet was subbed with vanilla ice cream[?]) for dessert! We finished everything off, and all the food we ordered was absolutely delicious. The only thing I would have changed would be a higher plantain:ice cream ratio. (4 pieces vs. 1 would have been glorious. I would even have taken just 2!)This is on the pricier end of the spectrum, but since my friend and I are technically \"homeless\" at the moment whilst on 4th-year med school rotations, he's stopped caring about student debt, and since I'm not really paying for cost of living this year, that was less of a factor.Service was very prompt and friendly. Our server came back often to refill our water and check up on us, and struck the perfect balance of being attentive but not intrusive (although he was super good-lookin' so I completely would not have minded the latter, har har har). But I digress.Overall, great place to go if you're craving good food! :] If you're vegan/vegetarian (I'm not, but noted it on the menu), they have plenty of different options to accommodate dietary restrictions! If I lived around here, I'd definitely be back for happy hour to stuff my face with sushi!"], ["Jeff S.", "A great fusion place! Everything we ordered was extremely tasty. The soups are great and the appetizers are delicious. The sushi was fresh and full of flavor. We will be returning to this little gem in the Short North."], ["Tara H.", "Love the food, service from the staff, great atmosphere with family and friends.Also fantastic place to have birthday parties and other events!"], ["June K.", "Needed an Asian fix during a long convention and came across this on Yelp. My friend and I stopped in for lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated, good artwork on the walls. Nicely stocked bar. It was a Sunday afternoon, a bit late for lunch. As some Yelpers have noted, not too many customers.I had the scallops over scalloped potatoes as an appetizer. The lightly coated and perfectly cooked scallops were delicious with the gravy of the scalloped potatoes whose creamy texture was offset by the crispy potato sticks, all garnished with green onions. Though a bit heavy, it absolutely delicious.I was debating between the Kimchi Noodle with Beef in Broth and the Pad Thai. I opted for the Pad Thai due to the rave Yelp reviews. They ask how hot you want the spice level. I asked for 4 of 5. The shrimps were fresh and perfectly cooked as well. The flavors were great but as mentioned above, think I might have enjoyed the flavors more if I hadn't ordered it too spicy. Recommendation would be to get 2 or 3 and ask for Siracha or hot sauce on the side. My friend had the Hawaiian spiced vegetables over rice instead of noodles which they were happy to accommodate. She loved her dish.We were both stuffed but when the waitress mentioned sticky rice and mangos for dessert which did not have any dairy (she's lactose intolerant), we had to have dessert. Hence I ordered the coconut fried plantain that came a la mode. OMG, scrumptious!! Do yourself a favor and don't skip dessert!The food was great and our waitress phenomenal. My tonic water was ever empty. She kept bringing refills before I was even done. Very sweet. She made our experience just so enjoyable.Everyone in or visiting must stop by. It's a nice little walk from the Convention Center too. But if you are driving, parking is next to impossible so do yourself a favor and spend $5 and park on W. Russell. Take a left turn at the corner street where the restaurant is on High (restaurant on left)."], ["Maurice H.", "I have recently moved to the short north and since I work downtown I thought I should finally give it a visit during lunch hour. Lunch menu is very sizable, and reasonably priced. Service was great. Kayla was very attentive with a big smile, and based on her recommendation I tried the Chicken Pad Thai which was very flavorful. She kept my water glass full. I will definitely be back here again and looking forward to checking the happy hour."], ["Erin D.", "Oh wow, why has it taken me so many years to get here? The lunch menu was pretty sizable and I was torn but ultimately went with chicken satay w spinach and rice.The sauce. This is the best satay I've had. Not overly peanut flavor and not uber heavy.My lunch mates went w scallop appetizer. 2 beautiful scallops on scalloped potatoes. It appeared to rival the scallops on dinner menus. I felt a bit envious and looked more delicious than my recent meal at Guild House.Then the zucchini dish with chicken. The sauce was commented as amazing and super large portions.Cannot wait to come back!"], ["Kevin W.", "I've eaten here several times, and the service is always fabulous, whether I'm dining with one friend or at a party with 20 people. Great seafood and sushi. One of the best restaurants in Columbus!"], ["Donna O.", "Lemongrass is a classic. They've been around since sushi and Asian fusion were brand-new and exotic, and they are still executing great pan-Asian cuisine in the heart of the Short North. Their entrance allows a full view of the narrow but deep interior of the restaurant, and the hosts are warm and welcoming. Seating is ample and sitting by the big windows in the front gives a great view for people-watching. Or, you can move to the bar for a more intimate feel (and great drinks).The portions here are ample and are a great value for the price. Lots of fish and seafood entrees in addition to a large sushi/sashimi menu. While Lemongrass' menu has plenty of coconut milk and gentle flavors, the kitchen can change the spice level to suit your taste. The Spicy Hawaiian Duck and the Seafood Basil are especially good, and unique to Lemongrass. This is a great place to dine in the Short North."], ["Martha G.", "Went here for dinner tonight with some of my coworkers. \u00a0We were seated immediately and seen right away by our friendly server.I ordered the New York specialty sushi roll and chicken pad thai. \u00a0the other girls ordered the avocado and almond roll, the dragon roll and the spider rolls. \u00a0I was able to try the avocado and almond roll which was different, but very good. \u00a0A raspberry riesling was ordered, but I wasn't a big fan. \u00a0I did order the grapefruit cosmo which was pretty good!The pad thai that I ordered was ok, but not the best pad thai I've ever had :-( \u00a0I've had better back home in D.C.Sushi here is pretty good, but pad thai may not be their strong suit."], ["Scott J.", "Food is tasty but bar service and hostess/management is the worst I've ever experienced. Our server was great but constantly harassed by the hostess/manager. This women actually interrupted our server while she was taking our order. It took 30 minutes to get a beer. Spicy tuna roll and Lemongrass Trio was tasty and well prepared. Unfortunately the food and prone location cannot overcome the poor service and management."], ["Aron Y.", "We dropped by Lemongrass for dinner one night during our week-long conference. Asian fusion might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you're with 2 Indians and a Bulgarian but it seemed like a safe option for all of us. Actually, we didn't have much of a choice.We approach the place to simply take a look at the menu. But before we could even get to the menu, an Asian lady suddenly popped out from the front door and yelled \"Hello! Come in come in!\" and just shoved us in. It was a total ambush!!! I'm Chinese and I've never been ambushed like this before. So we found ourselves walking towards a table before any of us realized what was going on.As for the food, they were mehhhh. The Pad Thai was only so-so. I didn't think anyone could mess up Pad Thai but this one was below average. We ordered some Veggie Dumplings and a Dragon Roll but both were kind of mehhh as well. Our waiter was really nice but the kitchen switched up our orders and the level of spiciness, put peanuts when we especially said not to, etc. Not too bad overall but not that great either."], ["Mehul A.", "This is the BEST asian food I have ever tasted. Plenty of vegetarian options!!The portion size is jussst right, in such a way that it fills your tummy, satisfies the hunger, but leaves enough room to tempt you for dessert!The entres are packed with flavor. Simply Excellent! Try the Choo-Choi Kabob and Spicy String beans.The almond cream cake is to die for! Also in Summer they prepare a special seasonal mango dessert which the Chef served us personally :D"], ["Jonathan S.", "Went here for lunch one day. \u00a0Was excited to try the menu as it seemed great. \u00a0The staff was friendly and seated us. \u00a0Took our order in a standard time frame. \u00a0Then the wait began. \u00a045 minutes after we ordered, we decided to leave as we were on standard lunch. \u00a0The wait time was completely unacceptable. \u00a0If they expected the wait to be that long, they should have said something. \u00a0I will never return here again and can't recommend it unless you have unlimited time for lunch."], ["Amy S.", "Birthday dinner! Tried the monsoon tofu even though im not a fan of tofu.. Their Miso soup has great spices and flavor the texture was cooked to perfection!!You should try it! Would not recommend the sushi there!"], ["Srebs T.", "Wait.. this place is still open? Why?"], ["Kyle F.", "Lemongrass won out on the most excellent end of the rating scale not only for their food but also their customer service. Their food is impressively crafted but more than that, our customer service experience was beyond stellar. Our waiter (Matt I believe his name was) gave us his honest opinion on the various dishes and wines and even brought us something else when my wife found something not to her liking. All the staff was attentive to our needs and friendly too. We will visit again and hope to have more good food and just as excellent an experience with another member of the talented and friendly Lemongrass staff."], ["Scott T.", "Thought food was really good. Service handled well. Food came out very quickly. Very large gluten free options."], ["Mark S.", "Very nice sushi rolls. Love the Lemongrass especially. Great service from friendly, hospitable and dynamic youngsters. Price wise in line as well. I would recommend this place all the time."], ["Aklilu A.", "Great scenery, love the atmosphere and the servers are great. If seafood is your thing, then this definitely the place for you. The best biscuits I've ever had, and the lemongrass soup goes perfect with the biscuits. I've been here before and had great sushi as well, the duck sauce is a bit different but other then that, it was a great experience."], ["Kathryn D.", "Great service, great food, great drinks! I got the Lemongrass Trio- it was absolutely delicious. The appetizer sampler was great as well. Fully recommended!!"], ["Keida M.", "I am afraid people are gong to start thinking I am a xenophobe reading my reviews on local Asian Cuisine. \u00a0I can assure you I am not, I have family in Japan, a Japanese sister in law, lots of Asian friends, etc...This being stated, Lemongrass Asian Bistro was pretty much a disaster. \u00a0It began with the first step in the door, my nose was assaulted by a cheap rose scented candle, about a foot tall and billowing smoke into the restaurant. \u00a0I immediately felt that I was head dunked into my grandmothers undergarment drawer. \u00a0Not fun, and TOTALLY inappropriate for an establishment serving food. \u00a0Someone needs to inform the owner that your taste buds are 70% dictated by your sense of smell. \u00a0Considering I am not a deer looking for the Park Of Roses for a rose buffet, this is awful. \u00a0What made the situation crazier was that we were sat next to the Kardashians cousins from Grove City, and the gal was wearing her OWN batch of floral hell. \u00a0So needless to say, the whole experience was set to the backdrop symphony of cheap toilet bowl cleaner smell. \u00a0Fuck!The lone bright spot was our waitress Samira. \u00a0She rocked, and knew the menu well, and was sweet and attentive. \u00a0If you go here, I recommend starting off with her!The food was an identical experience to Basil and Nida's. \u00a0Meh. \u00a0Ok, not competitive with mom and pop Asian joints, and twice as expensive. \u00a0We started with spring rolls. \u00a0They were good but small. \u00a0The sauces were nice, and the presentation was pretty. \u00a0Then the fried dough with satay sauce. \u00a0This was the winner. \u00a0It was basically a fresh donut with peanut sauce. \u00a0Simple and tasty! \u00a0The entre was a TOTALLY overpriced modest plate of vegetarian curry. \u00a0The food was tepid temperature, and I cannot remember what it tasted, or even looked like. \u00a0At $15, this is a travesty.We didn't bother getting drinks because we have fallen pray to this a hundred times. \u00a0It will be a weak uninspired $12 cocktail...Also of note. \u00a0White plastic chairs. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Christ, they have nicer plastic chairs at the Blood Bank in Clintonville.Honestly, even if the food were terrific, the scented candle fiasco would cause me to never set foot back in this place. \u00a0Lemongrass is the type of restaurant that would have maybe competed in the 80's when Mark Pi's at City Center was your \"Asian\" experience, and 55 On The Boulevard or La Scalla were your only places to go for prom dinner. \u00a0Columbus has advanced light years in the past 25 years, and Lemongrass doesn't even compete with the Pho place in the North Market.Despite what someone may think, I really don't get much pleasure out of slamming a restaurant. \u00a0I am well aware that this could be someone's dream. \u00a0If someone was sweet enough to cook me a meal, I would be a graceful recipient. \u00a0That said, this engagement is costing me my well earned money, and when I pay for a product, I am now investing. \u00a0A business owner should always keep this fact in the back of their mind as a driving mantra. \u00a0Verdict: \u00a0Something more inspiring needs to inhabit this prime location. \u00a0Just keep Samira when it changes!~ Keida Mascaro"], ["Victoria N.", "Suuuuuupeeeeerrrrr impressed. My mom and sister LOVVVVEEEEE the pad Thai. They are regulars here just for that dish. I always go with the sushi, and today I had the best roll of my life here at Lemon Grass. I got the dragon roll.

Great service on top of a great lunch!"], ["Julia C.", "Lemongrass is fabled among the regulars at the annual TNNA trade show in Columbus. I have never made it to the restaurant myself until this year, but now I will add it to my must do list for any opportunity I have to be in Columbus, right after my obligatory visit to Jeni's Ice Cream. The food was fresh, fully flavored, and perfectly cooked. The owner visited tables throughout the evening to make sure everyone was delighted with their experience, and the staff was helpful to newbies and Thai experts alike. The noise level was a little loud, which is why this isn't a five star review: a small discount in an otherwise perfect meal."], ["A M.", "The food was amazing and our server (I wish I could remember his name) was outstanding!

The tuna had no seasoning on it, and the mango was under ripe to the point of being hard and tasteless.The pad thai, which got great reviews from other yelpers, was decent but my shrimp were VERY overcooked. For half the price I would rather have Tai's Asian Bistro pad thai (on Lane) any day. Our server did a very nice job and brought out some new shrimp, which were better but still a bit rubbery.My girlfriend got the Trio. The sea scallop was very good, and was the only protein on her plate that was not overcooked, but she only got ONE scallop? Crab cake was mushy and didn't have much crab. Not worth the price of the food. Our server is the only reason I'm giving this a 2 star review and not one star."], ["Michael G.", "When they tell you their \"fusion\" is Asian and Midwest, take that to mean \"Thai food done badly\"."], ["Larry S.", "Excellent pad Thai.
