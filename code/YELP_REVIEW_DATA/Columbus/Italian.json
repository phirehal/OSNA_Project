Bourbon Barbeque Chicken pizza2. Peter & Laurie's favorite pizzaWe also tried the Truffled mushroom pizza.Several of the people at the table said their meals were too salty.Overall the evening was a good time with friends, but the food was not impressive enough to recommend."], ["Candace M.", "How had we not been here before? I feel like I'd seen reviews, but not really connected the dots as to where Figlio was or how badly we needed to make sure we stopped by!It was a Monday night and we were looking to have a nice dinner somewhere new. My boyfriend suggested Figlio. Thank goodness he did!When it is an option, I almost always get a mushroom pizza, or some variation of it. Figlio had a truffled mushroom pizza that seemed right up my alley; talk about understatement of the year! It was perfect! It was buttery and garlic-y and salty and the mushrooms were huge... YUM. I can't even describe how amazing it was! I'm planning on eating it again for lunch and I'm practically drooling in anticipation. My boyfriend got the chicken diablo pasta, and he wasn't a fan. It was fairly mild, with the only \"spice\" being a pepper on top. He was also expecting a red sauce, and it was smothered in something like alfredo. He, however, also loved my pizza! We also had the creme brulee that had a surprise dash of raspberry at the bottom; delicious! There were also a few raspberries on the side, and I feel like they were the good, organic ones. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. I loved the atmosphere. I thought it was fairly hip and happening, especially for a Monday night. I was a little confused by the apples hanging on the wall, especially when they were tomatoes on the menu...? But otherwise, loved everything about the decor and feel of the restaurant! Figlio, you won me over. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Jay P.", "We brought friends for our second visit to Figlios, but it was an overall disappointing experience. We arrived and decided to sit on the patio, which is large and spacious. Our waitress came by and I ordered drinks for the table, 1 cosmopolitan, 2 draft beers and 1 bottle of Miller Lite. Our friends arrived just as our waitress showed up with 2 bottles of Miller Lite in hand and the cosmo. Luckily, our friend decided to keep both bottles and 5 minutes later, my draft beer arrived. We then placed our orders. My friends had the Chicken Piccata and the Chicken Alfredo. We ordered the Cesar salad, the Peter & Laurie's Favorite Pizza and the Tilapia on Angel Hair pasta. Here's where the real problems started. Only one dish out of the four entree's ordered was great, which according to our friend, was the Chicken Alfredo. The Piccata was over saturated with lemon and was slightly sour to the taste. The Tilapia was worse. It also had a sour taste, but instead of a sauce, there was a broth of sorts...combined with the sour like taste, we did not finish it. The pizza was ok but was a little cold and not that tasty. It was better then the tilapia though, so we finished it. The Cesar salad was bland and had too much dressing.We were very surprised by the pasta dishes, especially as we had such a great experience on our first visit. Not sure if we will be going back soon..."], ["Edy D.", "The service was wonderful by Holly. Nice atmosphere and the food was Absolutely scrumptious!"], ["Andy D.", "Came here for restaurant week and it was hoppin' . \u00a0We grabbed a table for 2 in their nice outdoor seating area. \u00a0Only downside to the outside area is the tables are a bit close together so conversations aren't very private. \u00a0I ordered the Chop Chop Salad, Pesto Chicken with Feta Pizza, and the Chocolate Silk Pie with raspberry sauce. \u00a0The salad had a good mix of greens, egg, peas, bacon, and red onion with a heavier dressing making it taste similar to potato or macaroni salad, which was pretty tasty if you like those kinds of salads. \u00a0My wife got the crab & corn chowder soup which had amazing flavor. \u00a0OH the bread is awesome, it's a soft and doughy white bread that soaks up the olive oil and seasoning wonderfully.Now the pizza for the main course was delicious. \u00a0It had a nice balance of chicken, feta cheese, and a tasty pesto over a nicely crisped thin layer of pizza dough. \u00a0There were bits of olives scattered on the pizza as well and chunks of fresh tomato. \u00a0I thought there were supposed to be roasted red pepper on the pizza as well but I didn't notice it on there. \u00a0I had a few bites of my wife's seafood diablo pasta and it was hearty and tasty, though maybe a tad bit on the salty side.I had the chocolate silk pie with graham/nut crust and raspberry glaze for dessert--it was OK but not outstanding. \u00a0The pie was not as silky as I was expecting it to be. \u00a0My wife got the white chocolate creme brulee which was pretty standard as well. \u00a0The white chocolate is just a few flakes scattered on top of a creme brulee.Service was very friendly and appropriate. \u00a0We were seated promptly and our drinks were served quickly. \u00a0Our meals came out a bit longer than we expected but blame that on how popular the restaurant was for restaurant week! \u00a0We definitely will come back again to try their full menu sometime."], ["Adam R.", "Nice little neighborhood gem. Has both plenty of good points and other little things that kind of bugged me. Location is pretty easy to miss unless you look for the post office! The staff was receptive, but didn't really seem to care much. Food was fantastic. Pasta dishes were all top notch, but the portion sizes were quite small (for the price). We stopped in during restaurant week, but did not partake since the offerings were very limited. Given the portions I would have felt worse about going that route. It got rather busy in a short time which makes sense given the limited hours they were open. Drink selection was decent, but again on the higher price for such small glassware. \u00a0 Seems like a great place to take your parents when they are in town."], ["Chris H.", "Used to love this place because it was so consistent. But...woo! \u00a0The last 2 times I have been there the food has been beyond salty! \u00a0One dinner went uneaten because it was so salty. Even the olive oil used to dip the bread was salty!!!

And being a Michigan alumni, it's aches me that I found such a great restaurant down in Cbus. Nonetheless, I came down to Columbus for a weekend trip and was amazed to try out this restaurant-- Figlio. Before I tell you about the food, they have this piece of awesome art hanging in the walls of the restaurant--- just a bunch of stringed red peppers hanging & then 1 yellow pepper. it's SO cute and apparently, depending on the holidays and seasons, they'll change the vegetable/fruit that's hanging there. Now to the rating portion:Atmosphere:Loved it! Atmosphere was great, the art (again) was amazing, and overall, it was a friendly ambiance. It was just a tad loud for a romantic evening but a nice chill night with friends would be perfect.Service: I don't really recall the service, which means it was probably mediocre and just what I would expect.Dishes: Flatbread supreme pizza (2)-- my friend got this thinking this is the most famous pizza in the restaurant. Sadly, it didn't satisfy him a single bit. \u00a0The pizza was good, but plain.Wild mushroom pizza (4)-- my other friend got this and just devoured hers like no other. The mushrooms were grilled so perfectly.Shrimp & Scallop Pasta (5)-- YUM! So I got this pasta and probably finished it in 5minutes. It was so good and the pasta was soo unique but simply amazing. It has great texture and the flavors really stood out.Dessert:Cr\u00e9me Brulee (5)-- If i could give this dessert more than 5 stars, then that would be what it deserved. WOW.. the dessert blew me away. The raspberry hidden in the bottom just adds so much more flavors to the creme brulee. The caramelized sugar was fired perfectly and the vanilla bean flavor of the creme brulee blew me off the park. Then, the amount of raspberry to the creme brulee just made the whole meal that much worth it."], ["Curt P.", "I can't tell you how many times we've driven by Figlio and not even really noticed it - despite the large sign- but we finally made it in last night. Having read some of the reviews I was expecting a small and relatively cramped dining space and I didn't find this to be the case. The tables were a little close together as others had noted, but even on a relatively packed monday night, we had a fair amount of room. I imagine on a weekend this would differ drastically.The bread, which was delicious especially when paired with the oil and spices, came out pretty quickly and after making the difficult decision to turn down a second order, the decision was validated as our food came out. I had the Chicken Diablo which was kind of a bust but my girlfriend got the Truffle and Mushroom Pizza which was phenomenal. I expected my dish to come with a spicy red sauce but it was a relatively mild white sauce with a chili pepper on top. The pasta itself was cooked well, and don't get me wrong the sauce was good but not spicy, and what little chicken was there tasted pretty good but compared to the Truffle and Mushroom Pizza, pretty much any dish would be disappointing. The pizza was buttery and garlicky and I think I'm already craving it even though I only had one piece. I would go into more detail but the only other adjectives that I can think of are perfect and magical.As a parting note, the ambience and service were both pretty good, not terribly noteworthy on either count, but if it didn't add anything to the experience it definitely didn't take anything away from it. We will definitely be coming back, but this time I'm going to get the pizza!"], ["Mike C.", "I was sadly disappointed with my last visit to Figlio. Normally a top notch place (better be for the price). I had a subpar experience.Honestly, the pie that I got wasn't very flavorful at all. A bourbon barbecue chicken or some such thing should be brimming with flavors but it just wasn't. The chicken tasted bland and there were scarcely few toppings. Also, the yellow peppers weren't cooked to my liking and not seasoned at all.Also, the service was slow and bad. We were frequently ignored and not presented with our check when it was clear that we were finished. My beer glass was empty for most of the meal and a refill wasn't offered or suggested. And come on people, this is 2013 in Columbus Ohio. Get some more craft beers in the house. I think they had two and nothing on draft.With the plethora of upscale pizza joints in Columbus now (Pies and Pints, I am looking at you) I find it relatively unlikely that I will return here in the near future."], ["Catherine J.", "Super weird that I haven't reviewed Figlio before. When I'm over in UA, it's where we go when we don't know where to go. \u00a0Strictly woodfired pizza, salads, and pasta. There's daily specials in the same categories. Decent wine list. Both locations (Grandview and Upper Arlington) follow the same menu and format.The patio is purdy nice in the warmer months. You'll forget you're at the busy intersection of Fishinger and Riverside Drive.The bread and herb/oil dip at the beginning of the meal is delicious. Figlio is already a carb festival, so before the meal's even begun I usually just throw up my hands and succumb to the delicious, delicious carbohydrates. The ingredients always taste fresh. The waitstaff are young, cute, and helpful. I had several friends who worked here throughout high school. It's usually pretty crowded, and I almost ALWAYS see someone I know. It feels upscale, but its really just well-executed simple fare and the who's who of UA on a weekday night."], ["Collin M.", "My wife and I visited Friday evening, 4/11. First off, the ambiance on the patio is completely different than the inside - the patio is sunny and airy with plenty of room, while the inside is too dark, and they cram way too many tables, that are way too small, way too close together.I had the 'Drunken Shrimp' pasta, my wife had the crab ravioli - the shrimp, as noted in another review, is laughable. Extremely tiny, obviously frozen, and horribly overcooked; like tiny balls of rubber that faintly smell like seafood. You know those nasty super small canned salad shrimp at bad buffets? That's what this reminded me of. The pasta was also overcooked and mushy. The only redeeming quality would be the vodka-esque sauce, which was pretty good.The crab ravioli was cooked more properly - the pasta had a bit of bite, and the sauce was also decent. However, this dish also had the miniscule shrimp scattered over it like tiny shellfish pebbles for some reason. The crab filling was just a solid 'meh'. No lumb meat, fair amount of filler, but not offensive. Forgot it immediately after swallowing.We also had dessert; tiramisu and some ice cream torte thingy. The ice cream torte was frozen rock solid and could stand to sit a bit before serving. The tiramisu is ridiculously good; funnily enough, they're pretty proud of importing it from NYC.The waitress was nice, but pretty inattentive. Overcooked pasta and weird shrimp took 30+ minutes, with plenty of empty tables around.If you sit on the patio and stick to one of the tamer pizza's, I remember it being fairly enjoyable. As it is, not going back again - there's amazing wood fired pizza at Harvest, and too many places do pasta better (read: my kitchen)."], ["Anna H.", "4 1/2 stars, really. \u00a0Yes, I visited for restaurant week. \u00a0Yes, I overate. \u00a0Yes, I loved it. \u00a0I had the crab and corn chowder for an appetizer... it was a small serving, but oh so good. \u00a0The Seafood Pasta Diablo was excellent. \u00a0They didn't skimp on the seafood, as there was a lot of salmon and shrimp in there. \u00a0A few scallops, too. \u00a0Desert was a silky chocolate pie w/ a surprisingly satisfying nutty crust and raspberry sauce on the side. \u00a0I ate all but two pieces of the bread before the meal. \u00a0All, but two. \u00a0(I haven't had gluten in a while, so I went a little crazy.) \u00a0My dining partner got one little piece to take home. \u00a0Our server was very attentive and didn't seem to be annoyed that my dining partner and I talked for 2 hours. \u00a0I didn't feel too bad, since we weren't holding up a table for others as we were there shortly before close. \u00a0Waters were never empty. \u00a0I didn't love the atmosphere, as the tables are so close-- it's difficult to have a private conversation. \u00a0The patio looked super cute, though. \u00a0Best part was, I got 3 courses for $20 (thanks to the sponsors of Restaurant Week!). \u00a0This is a great place to go for good-quality food (and decent selection), but not bust-your-wallet date night."], ["Malcolm R.", "Excellent service. Unfortunately poor product. My wife has been gluten free for years. They do have a gluten free menu. So you can get a gluten free pizza or gluten free pasta. Sadly, I learned that the chicken broth that they use for many recipes has gluten. Their bolognese also contains gluten. Usually I only run into restaurants that use broth which contains gluten in large chain restaurants like Applebee's, ruby Tuesdays etc..... I was very surprised to find it in a family owned establishment. Hopefully they will change their practices."], ["Karen M.", "I love the patio here...four stars for the patio! \u00a0The service was excellent...four stars for the service. \u00a0I had the crab ravioli...they were just okay...the food is what makes the three stars to me. \u00a0My companion had the chicken and mushroom ravioli...those looked good and he really enjoyed them. \u00a0I want to go back and try the pizza and maybe I'll change my mind on the food."], ["Christie H.", "We've enjoyed Figlio's with my in laws many times. Not once have I been disappointed in my entree! Tonight I had the strawberry and arugula/spinach salad.

We had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was creamy, crunchy and sweet. We will be back soon!"], ["Meredith Z.", "The food there was fantastic! We ordered a shrimp pesto pizza, a seafood pasta and a raspberry br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They came in the right portion (not like the huge portion in cheese cake factory, so they are quite healthy in terms of portion) and they all tasted good. HOWEVER, they put in more seats than they should have maybe because the place was very popular. If you got the patio seats, it may be more spacy. My friend and I were seated inside, and my seat was less than 10 inch away from the another seat. I'm far from being fat (my BMI is 22, the normal weight's range is 185-24.9). I could not move even one centimeter because another seat was right behind mine. I'm quite unhappy with this arrangement, even a fast food restaurant have more spacy seats than there. I hope that this comment can somewhat help them improve. And because it's so pact, it may take the waitress a while to get to you though they are very friendly.SO five star for the food and two stars for the dining environment. so 3.5 starts in total which rounded up to four."], ["Zack O.", "My wife and I visited Figlio for the first time tonight.

We will be back!"], ["Julie J.", "The waitress didn't seem concerned as I scraped the dried food off of my glass... I had to ask for a clean one; she did not offer. We turned our wobbly table 90 degrees as she went to get a clean glass so our drinks wouldn't spill due to the uneven legs. We should have taken the hint, but instead we stayed and ordered a margarita pizza and a sausage pizza. \u00a0I have never had a margarita pizza made with pink, flavorless beef steak tomatoes... Roma is the norm. I was informed \"we have always made it that way.\" (Won't be doing that one again.) The sausage pizza had a nice spice, but the flavor of the meat was gamey and tasted like organ meat; I was concerned that it was rancid. The crust on the margarita was good, but not worth another visit. This was our second try and we won't be trying it again.

Plus, sitting inside can be a little tight when it is busy.Semi-Cons: \u00a0Service was a little slow, which was understandable considering how busy it was, but our waitress was great.

They have consistently good food and service.Last Friday night, my husband and I stopped there for dessert. We shared 2 desserts and each had a coffee with liquor drink. The chocolate mousse is dense, but deliciously chocolate, with whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top. Their cr\u00e8me brulee comes with a hidden dollop of raspberry puree on the bottom, which adds extra flavor to the dish. I love cr\u00e8me brulees with fresh fruit or fruit sauce! This week, due to horrible weather, we decided to have dinner there. We had planned to try a new place, which is much further from our house. Again, Figlio did not disappoint. I started with the Figlio Martini, which has pomegranate juice in it and a caesar salad. The salad dressing has a bit of lemony flavor. I chose the chicken diablo for dinner. It had a not-too-spicy cream sauce, with chicken, pasta, spinach and tomatoes. I think mushrooms would be a good addition to the dish, but it was tasty!My husband had the special- a tilapia filet with fingerling potatoes. Also yummy! This night we had the chcocolate mousse again and tried the cheesecake in a jar. The cheesecake is more like a cheesecake mousse, with cherries in the middle. I loved it.

The food was really good, I tried the pizza and the chicken marsala, and the service was alright. Nothing to complain about, but nothing that exceeded my expectations.The staff that is watching the door is not very good. The front door is hard to find, and the people seating us were really awkward. They literally didn't even welcome us to the restaurant. The wait staff was good, but did not come to our table nearly as often as they should have. I ordered a beer before dinner started and was never once asked if I wanted another.The other aspect is the fact that the place is supposed to be fancy. Besides being in a strip mall the place just isn't that fancy. The table cloth is paper, the beer and wine selection isn't that good, and the interior looks cheap.I think the place is good, and I would probably go back, but it really only deserves about 2.5 to 3 stars."], ["Shawnie K.", "I prefer this location to the Figlio in Grandview, but it's just a matter of preference (and it's closer to my home!). The menu is minimal, but I've had just about everything it offers and have never had any complaints. The \u00a0menu consists mostly of woodfired, gourmet pizzas, pastas and salads. The wine list is relatively small, but certainly developed with thought and expertise.The small bar has a lively energy that carries over into the slightly larger dining room. During the summer months, an outdoor patio is opened for dining al fresco. The patio is nothing special as it is tucked between a post office and other restaurants, overlooking the parking lot. They have it fenced in and somewhat protected, so if you like to eat outside, it is perfectly acceptable.The bar area can feel a little claustrophobic in the winter, when everyone is corraled here to wait for their tables, but it's a friendly, social place where everyone seems to know everyone else. \u00a0Figlio's tight table seating is compact and they sure pack 'em in- but with reason. \u00a0The food is great, the servers are young and upbeat and, given the great price points, I always leave feeling my money was well-spent.A friend wanted me to mention the tiramisu, which she can never leave without having. I don't do dessert very often and forget to mention that aspect of dining, but she assures you, Figlio's tiramisu is great."], ["Nadia O.", "A gorgeous location and ambiance with a classy edge, I love the outdoor dining area and inside is just as nice with their huge pizza oven that hints good pizza when you walk in from the patio.

I definitely recommend the Chicken Carbonara, Filet Mignon (which is prepared with a red wine...superb), Salmon or the Butternut Squash. There was not one complaint, only raves from our guests. I especially appreciate the conscientious wait staff who gave honest suggestions on popular menu items and favorites. Everyone was professional and incredibly friendly. \u00a0Being that we took 60+ guests last year for our event, we saw many return on their own this year (separate from our group dinner we planned this year).I plan corporate dinners in Los Angeles to Miami to Las Vegas, Indianapolis, etc. throughout the year.

I would have like some citrus to cut the buttery rich taste and a little more clam. We got the chocolate tort for dessert and it was delicious. Light and rich at the same time, the chocolate and peanut flavors were amazing. Overall, a pricy place with food where other places can replicate for less. Basically you pay for the atmosphere."], ["Stacy P.", "Martini Modern was one of my favorite finds while visiting Columbus. \u00a0 The restaurant is an open concept with the bar in the front and the main dining area towards the back, and you could even see the kitchen. The decor was stunning, especially the three chandeliers, it is something best seen and not easily captured in photo. The dim lighting also adds to the ambiance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered a Gluten Friendly Menu (as they note they are not a completely GF kitchen), pasta included. It surprisingly had a decent amount of options. The food and service was good. The drinks were what stole the show. The Short North Tea, which they had to slightly modify to be completely GF, was phenomenal. I would warn that one could easily drink these too quickly. The sweetness of the does a good job at masking how strong these suckers truly are.Martini's also offered one of the best gluten free breads I have had in awhile. It is the Chef's recipe and he has done a nice job of perfecting the recipe. It reminded me of eating actual bread and not the usual cardboard tasting offerings that other restaurants like to pass off as GF bread.If your looking for a place for romantic date or an intimate dinner with friends or even a chili and relaxing dinner, then Martini Modern Italian is the place for you. If you are a penny-pincher and don't like spending $30+ a person, then this isn't a place for you."], ["Benjamin S.", "We went there for a business dinner. Everything was remarkably over-priced. I'm a chef, I know. We choose to not even enjoy drinks, the reason we went there so early. We ordered food, although descent, was overly rich.Too much so. I had my waitstaff box my left-overs. I threw it away outside. It seemed like the staff didn't care. Maybe they were having a off night.

We had a great little table for two near the back but on a raised up level where we could see the bar and most of the dining area. \u00a0It was a vibrant place, busy but not obnoxiously crowded. \u00a0Our waitress Jonida was warm, let us dine at our pace, had fabulous recommendations and really was like a friend by the end of our meal. \u00a0We knew just from talking to her when we first sat down that we would be enjoying ourselves.We began with a great bottle of Barolo ( which they assisted on selection after we had narrowed it down) that was every bit as fruity AND full as promised. \u00a0I always appreciate when the restaurant actually suggests the less expensive of two bottles. \u00a0Next we ordered calamari - so lightly breaded. \u00a0I think my husband ate every bit of the flavorful peppers on the dish. \u00a0The house bread is also light, not dense, and the fresh house made basil pesto alone is worth writing home about. I usually pass on bread to save room but this was worth the indulgence.We continued to struggle with decisions since the entire menu looked appealing. \u00a0Jonida saved us by offering that we could have half orders of the pasta so our next dish was a half order of the lamb pappardelle. \u00a0Good thing she brought the bread earlier because after we finished this dish, we used it to soak up the fabulous Chianti wine reduction that remained on the plate! \u00a0The braised lamb was so tender and flavorful and the half portion was just enough.Our third course was our toughest decision but we went big with the tenderloin and the scallops. \u00a0Jonida recommended the tenderloin and of course she didn't steer us wrong here either. \u00a0Both were cooked to absolute melt in your mouth perfection. \u00a0The kind of dishes that makes you close your eyes after you take a bite, just savoring the flavor and textures. Some espresso and bread pudding and we were two of the happiest people on the planet! \u00a0As we ended our meal, we decided this is one of the best dining experiences we have ever had, comparing it to some of our favorite meals in Tuscany over the years. \u00a0Really, truly exceptional. \u00a0If we were local we would be regulars and can't wait for our next trip to Columbus."], ["Julianne R.", "The handmade pasta is delicious! I went here on a business trip for dinner. The service is great and so is the food. We enjoyed the calamari and bruschetta for appetizers and they we both very tasty and the two I would recommend.

Overall, I'm glad that we went. \u00a0Our server, Justin and the GM, Alex, were very, very attentive and patient with all of our questions. (We are opening a restaurant and had a lot of questions about product, procedures and their operational and menu choices in general.) \u00a0In regards to service, by far, they deserve way more than 5 stars. In reality, I should probably deduct a star for some minor critiques but since I was kind of hunting for criticism and the small points based on my own personal preference, five stars is well deserved. I'll still include my comments just for the sake of sharing my experience. In general, the flavors, price, presentation of food and drink was great. The pulled mozzarella was a little overworked and tough, but still enjoyable. The carpaccio was wonderful, but I wished for a little more greens and some acid to elevate the dish- the beef was a little lost. Still, very good, though. The jumbo prawns were enjoyable- I don't think they were a shining star, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. We also ordered the lamb pappardelle which I really liked, but my colleagues were looking for a a little more \"lamb\" flavor. I don't really care for lamb so I found it very good. The sauce on the tortelloni and ravioli didn't have significant differences in their flavor profiles and while a bit heavy, the pasta/filling ratio was spot on and flavors pretty well balanced. I'm in love with the lemon tart. I certainly didn't need dessert, but I couldn't stop eating it! \u00a0All in all, it was a great meal and a wonderful experience- I'll surely be back next time I'm in town.

Luckily, there was no wait, so we were able to be seated right away. The Martini staff is excellent and very attentive; there are multiple people always refilling water glasses, so there's no chance of going parch! The food is consistently good. I highly recommend the fresh mozzarella appetizer- freshly made when ordered, this thin piece of warm mozzarella comes with several slices of toasted focaccia, their house made pesto, and the most delicious roasted tomatoes I have ever had!I can also vouch for their beef carpaccio appetizer, which is my absolute favorite. It's hard to go there and NOT order it!!The butternut squash tortelloni was very good, without being over the top rich like I thought it would be. Think massive tortelloni- the shape is a blend of tortellini and ravioli, with lots of creamy squash filling! The cream sauce nicely compliments the tortelloni without over powering it, and the few brussels sprout leaves and crushed marcona almonds provides a nice texture contrast.The short ribs are pretty good- I have to say I rarely order short ribs so can't be too critical. They were a tad on the fatty side, but I guess that's what short ribs are. The creamy polenta was delicious, as was the reduction of whatever that saucy goodness was on top of it. I have had the lamb papperdelle a few times, too- that is probably my staple dish there. AND, if you somehow have room for dessert after the end of the meals, I highly recommend the chocolate bread pudding. OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!Good food and great service, what more can you ask for? The only \"hiccup\" we experienced with restaurant week was the fact that the second and third courses came out together about five minutes after we got our appetizer. We politely asked them if they would mind keeping it warm while we finished our appetizer, which they had no issue doing. They then brought the second course and followed with the third course after we finished. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Michele G.", "The only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars is for the outstanding customer service and the awesome drinks.

It can come off a bit sweet if you aren't expecting it, but as someone who has a deep appreciation for whiskey and whiskey related beverages I approve of it. They also do fairly well at making an Old Fashioned (my favorite cocktail). In fact I usually judge all upscale sorts of places in some part on that cocktail, and they have passed... for now.The wine special on Sunday evenings is something to make a trip for as well.

Service was terrible. Our waiter mis-took our order so the wrong dish came out which we received the corrected dish towards the very end of our meal. Then he charged us for the wrong meal that we did not have which I pointed out during the check. Without any apologies, he said that they are all the same price and you can check the menu.

There were two large thick \u00a0pieces of eggplant, not peeled, atop linguine and tomato sauce, and cooked to perfection with mozzarella on top and baked til bubbly. \u00a0My sister and I split the eggplant, and it's a good thing we did. \u00a0It seemed we each got a full portion. \u00a0 Of course I asked for the fresh parmesan to be put atop, big 1\" curls of the stuff. YUM. \u00a0There was so much eggplant that I ate only a bit of the linguine, which was firm and done to perfection. My sister had chicken carbonara and ate every bit. \u00a0Other sister had butternut squash ravioli, and although I am not a fan and evidently \u00a0neither is she, I am sure that someone out there will like it. It was definitely homemade, not ordered from a supplier.

They literally make it right before they bring it to you. It's still warm. It comes tomatoes and pesto and if I remember correctly some bread. It's one of the simplest and most delicious things I've ever eaten. Second course, we both had the veal and spinach ravioli. Best pasta dish we've both ever eaten. I can't even tell you how good this is. The sauce is the most delicious thing ever.

Even when I'm not buying pasta, I *love* to swoon at the case.Most of the time that I've stopped here, I've had amazingly friendly service with a fantastic product. The service aspect is especially fantastic because I usually want a little guidance -- how much should I buy for my group? What sauces to you recommend to compliment? Usually they've gone above and beyond with helpful answers.Everything from plain cheese tortellini to gorgeous, colorful, ribboned lobster ravioli. I don't often plan on having pasta, and not typically for a dinner party... but when I'm not making it fresh myself, I'm seizing the opportunity to buy from Pastaria.However -- if I were writing this review based solely on \u00a0my last experience, it'd be more of a two-star experience. I'm going with the 3 stars today, knowing that my previous experiences have been 4 or 5 star experience. I definitely wanted to highlight the typical positives \u00a0upfront. Not sure if it's gone downhill or what, but I'll come back and hopefully bump up my review. Here's why I'm concerned, based on my last visit:- Weird service. Not the typical helpfulness. I walked up to the counter and at least three employees looked at me without a greeting or offer to help. Was just about to walk away, when I finally got some assistance, which was flat and minimal at best.- I asked how much of a certain ravioli would be good for 2 people as a side. She suggested 4 - 5 pieces each (this particular type was huge). That seemed a bit large, but I went ahead with it. When I opened my package at home, there were 13 pieces in there, which is not what she recommended nor what I thought I was getting. Considering the bill was over $13, I should have been aware. $13 for a side dish for two. I know ravioli is a labor of love to make, and I'm willing to pay for that. But, I was a little bummed to be over-portioned and therefore over-charged.- Also when I got the ravioli home, quite a few of them were broken. I know they're delicate, but still.- I got the applewood bacon and spinach ravioli. I could not taste (or see) the bacon at all. It seemed mostly like ricotta and spinach. They sure were pretty, though (the unbroken ones, at least) with gorgeous and vibrant stripes of green and red in the dough wrapper.Anyway, hope they were just having an off day, because I think this is one of the \u00a0highlights of the North Market!"], ["Nick S.", "Had the pesto pasta.

Nothing is full of 'wow', but they've not been terrible ever. The soft bread with the killer garlic butter is amazing, and it's almost sad that I look forward to that more often then the pasta sometimes. I've had a few visits where the penne was overcooked, and gotten to that soggy cardboard state. Thankfully those have been rare. It's also one of the few places I can get a good penne putanesca that really has some heat, but depth as well. not just heat for heat's sake.I think the biggest reason though why I gave it three stars and not four is because the prices recently went up a couple of dollars, but I'd have to say the most recent time I was there (just last weekend) the food was really just kind of average. I always hope with a price increase that the food will be better, of not at least the same, but I was a little underwhealmed to be truthful.

You also get some bread and a glob of delicious compound butter that's full of roasted garlic and green onions. For a couple bucks more you can add meatballs, sausage, chicken or salmon. Besides hot delicious take out, you can get the sauces and the butter packaged up to serve at home, fresh mozzarella, and tiramisu.Across the aisle you can find more grocery type items, olive oil, vinegar, fresh and dry pasta, bread, and a rotating menu of prepared foods.

I can't speak to the pastas, etc but the sandwich was very disappointing. I ordered the Monte Cristo because I love Monte Cristos. It looked so good in the case! I give it points for that alone. Upon ordering, I was asked if I wanted the sandwich heated up. The prospect of a cold Monte Cristo sandwich did not appeal so I said yes. As she made her way to the microwave, I immediately regretted this decision. What I wanted was a nice, hot, and crispy sandwich from a panini maker or press of some kind. What I got was a soggy, half hot, half cold mess. I also had an issue with the fact that there were no preserves served with the Monte Cristo. Preserves are a staple of any good Monte and the cashier said that they had been asked the same thing more than once. If the demand is there, why not provide? I would have even paid extra for them!On a more positive note, the service was friendly and everything was nice and clean and well presented.

I spotted Eggplant Napoleon in the case, and this looked like something worth trying.The helpful cashier heated up a serving of Eggplant Napoleon (which is a sliced eggplant, stacked in layers with ricotta cheese and several other veggies, like a lasagna or napoleon dessert, but using eggplant as the main layer divider), and popped into a container with some bread and seasoned butter. The bread was ok, but the eggplant was great! I'd totally recommend it -- not as heavy as an eggplant parmesan, but still with a nice creamy ricotta filling for a few layers - like a light veggie lasagna with no pasta!Plus, while many North Market stalls can have long lines at busy lunch hours (including Pastaria's main stall), Pastaria Seconda was just walk up and order - like a hidden gem of North Market!"], ["Josette B.", "I picked Pastaria for lunch today, out of the many options North Market offers, and I'm very glad I did!

Pastaria is very good, but it isn't knock-your-socks-off amazing. \u00a0it's very good food, and it succeeds in being an inexpensive and delicious option in the North Market. \u00a0if you enjoy pasta at all and find yourself in the area, stop by Pastaria for a quality dinner (and lunch the next day!)"], ["Ann S.", "We'd never eaten here before and were looking for a healthier option. \u00a0I'm not a fan of chunky tomato sauces so I asked the lady what she would recommend in the tomato sauce realm. \u00a0She looked like I'd just spoken to her in Swahili. \u00a0She turned to her co-worker, a Karate Kid wanna be with his red bandana tied across his forehead all Daniel-san style who was eating his lunch from there and he got this glazed deer in headlights look. \u00a0How HARD is this people!?! \u00a0Do you not sample your own menu?? \u00a0I really wanted the garlic one but he recommended the tomato basil. \u00a0Okay fine. \u00a0So I got the whole wheat penne with tomato basil. \u00a0The hubby got whole wheat penne with the garlic tomato sauce, chicken chunks and a salad. \u00a0That sounded good so I got a salad too. \u00a0I asked what dressings they had and she fumbled all over that one too. \u00a0I asked for French, like she said and he asked for Italian. \u00a0She asked me THREE TIMES what kind of dressing I wanted and every time I replied French. \u00a0I asked if the fresh mozzarella could be cut in half into 2 oz because I was trying to watch it that day and didn't need 400 calories worth of cheese. \u00a0She asked Daniel-san if he could do that...insert glazed over look again and conferencing. \u00a0At this point, we were about to leave if very simple requests were being blown WAY out of proportion. \u00a0The hubby says just put the other 2 oz on his. \u00a0They seem to get it together and we head upstairs to eat. \u00a0We pull out our salads and there sit 2 containers full of RANCH dressing for both of us. \u00a0Are you flippin' serious!?! \u00a03x I had to repeat it and she STILL didn't get it right?? \u00a0GRRRR. \u00a0Trying to eat was a treat because their plastic forks are so flimsy and cheap, the two middle tines split in half and you had to keep re-stabbing over and over. \u00a0I was ready to hurl my garlic bread at them from above but I refrained. \u00a0The meal was decent. \u00a0Not anything out of this world, I make better. \u00a0The garlic tomato sauce by the way does NOT have chunks of tomato either so I could've gotten that. \u00a0Thanks. \u00a0The chicken was marinated and tasted really good but the hubby said there wasn't enough of it. \u00a0The butter is really good and probably the only reason I'm giving them a marginal 3 stars. \u00a0Honestly, we probably won't go back at least not if those two are working it."], ["Erin K.", "Alright, so maybe five stars is a little generous.

I don't think I could speak more highly of the butter. Thinking about it now is literally making my mouth water.

This was the most lackluster of my experience. Had the Roasted Chicken Marsala. The flavors were good, but texturally, it was a disaster. The chicken skin, was so flabby and unappetizing. The risotto cake, was worse than I expected, frankly just not good. WINE: Awesome. Decent wine menu and prices. My biggest criticism here is that they should cater their wine list to the dishes being served. Many of them don't pair well in my opinion. A few dishes will pair with 5+ of the wines, but other dishes, you will find it more difficult to find a pairing from their short menu. You can also of course purchase anything from their bottle shop and drink it there. They have a corkage fee, which makes absolutely no sense to me. Charging a corkage fee for a bottle brought from home, makes sense. But charging for something you buy from their shop, is silly. SERVICE: Excellent. This is where they shined.

One is named The Wine Bistro (Upper Arlington, Clintonville, Worthington, Westerville), and then there's The Wine Guy Bistro (Gahanna, New Albany, Pickerington.) I've been to both, and can say with confidence that The Wine Bistro is superior to The Wine Guy Bistro. First, the ambience. The Wine Bistro in Upper Arlington has more of a warm, cozy, classy decor which I prefer to The Wine Guy's post-modern look in Gahanna. I also appreciate their patio seating during warm weather months. Second, the food. The food here in general is tastier, and better suited to a wine tasting in my opinion. On my most recent visit, we had an order of the cheese platter, the antipasto platter, butcher's choice, and chicken pesto flatbread. The butcher's choice hanger steak was phenomenal. While I love seafood, the Wine Guy's menu is too seafood-heavy, which really limits my options when I want to do a flight of red wine. (Red wine and seafood is probably the worst food-drink pairing known to mankind, in my opinion.)The one thing that this place could do better, I think, is to offer a wider variety of wine flights."], ["Emily D.", "Let me start by saying that I have had *exceptionally* good experiences with the Wine Bistro in Clintonville, so tonight's experience was completely unexpected. We decided to hit up the Lane Ave location because it's a blizzard out there and we thought the drive would be easier. \u00a0It's our first dateaversary so we were willing to face the weather in order to get the waived corkage fee and hopefully some gourmet eats.It was unsurprisingly quiet in the restaurant so we were seated immediately. \u00a0When our server came up, she asked about getting us some wine but we knew the drill (if you don't, you get to pick your own bottle and it's fantastic). After she explained how the layout of the wine racks worked, my boyfriend quickly asked about making vegetarian versions of any of the items on the menu. The Wine Bistro is decidedly NOT veg friendly, but the Clintonville location had enthusiastically worked with us before to get something amazing from their menu choices. \u00a0The server simply said, \"Hmmm. No.\" I was floored. She was so curt about it. After a few minutes of considering it, we decided we'd just leave rather than ordering the only option on the menu that would work, which we didn't really want. So we went back out into the snow and frantically tried to find another place nearby. The weather was just too awful to justify driving around for a place so, eventually, we just went home. \u00a0We're now cooking our dateaversary dinner at home. \u00a0I had planned this two weeks ago and didn't dream that we'd be essentially told that the idea of not putting meat in something was unthinkable.

I was not expecting the cozy ambiance, as I drive by here frequently and just kind of assumed it had the same vibe as Carsonie's across the street.Um, hello! This place is so great! I LOVED the decor and big walls of wine and I'm sure much of my joy was just being someplace new. We opted to sit at a high-top by the bar and had a great perch for people-watching. I like that you're able to shop the wall for your bottle of wine (if you don't want a full bottle you can buy by the glass). The best thing was that I saw bottles as low as $10. Kind of a bummer the corking fee is $8, but oh well. I hear the corking fee is waived on Mondays and Tuesdays.Bf & I each got a Winery Salad, which had great flavor. The proportions of ingredients were nice too - just enough gorgonzola to match the tartness of the dried cherries and counter the sweetness of the candied pecans. Really enjoyed this salad. The bread that came with it was hard as a rock though. Kinda tossed that aside.For dinner we split the Fondue Trio and Veal Meatball. Both were amazing and I would definitely order again. The fondue consisted of 3 cheeses mixed with wines. The cheddar and port was AMAZING! It came with italian bread and pita, though I could have done with just bread.The meatball was equally amazing. Tender and flavorful and covered with a delicious marinara and melted gooey cheese. (Yes, there was a lot of cheese going down at our table).For a bottle of wine, 2 salads and 2 small plates our total came to about $65. Is it great for every night? Nah.

We were also told that if we hadn't been late that our table would have been ready. Call me crazy, but as far as I know, most restaurants will take reservations up to 10-15 minutes past the selected time.

I lived in NYC for 5 years, and this place definitely reminded me of a higher end family owned Italian restaurants in NY... Soho specifically. Not overly design/contemporary but \"high end\" materials, etc. throughout.Food was fantastic and menu was unique and diverse. You could definitely tell that the chef was hands on with it's creation as everything had a nice twist to it. The Bruschetta was some of the best I have ever had... second maybe only to my mothers (and that is saying a lot).Why am I only giving it a 4?... Service was above average but not great.

The staff and service were very kind if not overworked (there were several long waits for things like drink orders/getting the check) but that is certainly not their fault, that's a management issue. Our server was more than adequate and our cocktails were good. We ordered two pasta dishes- the smoked chicken ravioli and the fettucine gastrove. The fettucine smelled exactly like a Lean Cuisine, which I tried to put out of my head. The flavor was just blah- the vegetables were indistinguishable from one another and the sauce could have come out of a jar. It had an inconsistent texture and was tossed with overcooked chicken and some basil and garlic. I will say that the pasta was perfectly cooked.The smoked chicken ravioli was just too sweet for me, though I don't have much experience with smoked meat so I don't know if it tends to be sweeter or if this was due to this particular recipe. For dessert, we shared a tartufo chicolate which I thought was just fine, and the birthday boy really liked. It has zabaglione cream, gelato, and is dusted with cocoa powder, so there are a lot of different flavors and textures. Presentation is nice and simple.Overall, I'm glad we tried this place but we won't be back- it's just too much money for unexciting and inconsistent food."], ["Andy B.", "Excellent ambience, excellent food, great wine selection.

(The website states they do not take reservations, but, in fact, they do.) The space is well decorated and feels inviting. We especially loved the bar. We were seated at a tiny two top, which would have been OK, but the other tables around us were so close, it may as well have been communal seating. Even the staff had difficulty maneuvering between tables. It was plain awkward! I'm not sure if extra seating was added to accommodate for Valentine's or if that's the norm. If it's normal. It'd be more comfortable to be seated at the bar. Our waiter was OK. He was pretty attentive, but also, not attentive. Like, he came by often, but didn't care if we were having a good meal. Or he'd clear the empty glasses, but leave the plates. He also didn't offer cheese for on our meals when I saw others getting it. If that helps gage the service we got. Bread service was OK. They serve you an individual ciabatta roll from a basket to your bread plate and deliver a fresh herb butter. I have had better, but as far as bread and butter goes, I like it all. I ordered prosecco and the boyfriend a reisling. Brought promptly with an ample pour, rightfully so, as no glass of wine was under $7. I ordered the asparagus ravioli that was very good with a toasted almond pasta. I'd never had anything like it before.The filing was perfectly seasoned to compliment the mild cheese sauce with ample, but not overwhelming aparagus flavor. The unfresh winter tomatoes garnish ruined the dish overall with their harsh yucky flavor. I'd request those off in the winter. Also, the sauce had a hint of uncooked wine. Like they added it, but didn't cook it long enough to get the alcohol off. A product of a busy evening I guessed as my boyfriend's Veal Marsala was in the same boat. With perfectly al dente pasta and tender veal the dish was overshadowed by runny undercooked sauce. Of course, not horrible, just not the best. I think these mistakes were minor and easily fixable if they'd been less busy. But, then again, no excuse for it, really. So, that's all. No apps, no dessert, as soon as we declined dessert we immediately had our check. $56 total was a little on the high side, but also, not unusual for that type of meal. However, in this price point, Giuseppe's would not be my top choice. Will I be back? Yes! Why?

We sat there as we watched the servers chit chat. We decided to get up and leave. As we were leaving another hostess asked what our problem was. We told her. We did not get an apology.

OK, we DIDN'T have reservations. Once seated, the service was slow and she was not very apologetic. Drinks were also slow in coming from the bar.

I never did receive the Caprese Salad. Once I brought this to the server's attention, there was only a quick \"I'm sorry\", \u00a0and off she went. The meat lasagna entree finally appeared after I sat through my guests eating their soups and salad while I awaited the phantom Caprese Salad that never materialized. The cheese in the lasagna was virtually nonexistent and the noodles had the consistency of wet bread. It as disappointing to try to eat through half the portion before finally giving up. I think that a can of Chef Boyardee Lasagna from the nearby Kroger's would have been a better choice and much tastier that this slop that was served. I left the restaurant hungry and $ 60.00 lighter for a lousy meal and poor service. I'm sorry to have to say that, as I carefully thought about that before writing this review. This might be a \"hoity toity\" place, but in the future, my money my guests and I will go to better eating establishments that make their customers a priority and their food better than one would get at a drive through.

We shared a spumoni bombe and while the strawberry, pistachio and chocolate gelattos tasted wonderful, the dessert was rock hard and we spent several ungainly minutes trying to stab into it with our spoons and hands. Service was not attentive, but that could be because of how busy they were. I would gladly come back for the bar service and appetizers.

If you're serious about good cuts of meat it's Carfagna's or nothin'. Their bacon-wrapped filet mignons are so delicious and well priced at $7.99 a steak. They are the ultimate treat for grilling season and the bacon serves as a fun surprise for guests. Their meatball mix is sold by the pound and begs you to roll them in little balls to then be dunked in their many varieties of pasta sauces. I have the best memories of \"Pasta Dinners\" from elementary school when Carfagna's would provide the meal for a fundraiser. Just thinking about the fresh pasta (also holy moly you'll never want boxed pasta again after trying their fresh pastas!) and steaming plates of meatballs in marinara sauce elicits some serious nostalgic memories for me. Which while I'm at it you must must must buy their pasta sauces. My favorites are the marinara and vodka sauces. After trying this you'll want to toss out your Emerald branded jars because BA BAM Carfagna's are 10x better. When ever I'm home in CBUS I'm sure to stock up on the jars, because I've had friends request it by name. Carfagna's even throws in a free 1 lb bag of pasta with every jar purchase. Now that's a customer-focused business. And, man, I haven't even mentioned the chicken salad. We buy 2 pound containers for my family and they're obliterated in a matter of hours. In fact, since I've began writing this review my stock has dwindled by a 1/4th. Also worthy of mentioning are the BBQ ribs and the very well priced wine selection. Just go, ok?

I first got some freshly cut pepperoni for my grilled pizza and it was quite tasty (I sampled one) and then next got a sausage patty. \u00a0I didn't see that they had any ground up, most were in hot dog type form so I just went ahead and got one patty for $1.50. \u00a0As it turns out it was the perfect size for my 2 medium pizzas I was going to grill (I simply cooked it in a pan and diced it up as I cooked). \u00a0Right as we were discussing pepperoni a manager came over and strongly recommended I check out their freshly made pepperoni bread. \u00a0Being the pizza fan I am I took him up on that and got a loaf for $5.49. \u00a0It's basically a really nice white bread with pepperoni and mozzarella baked into it. \u00a0You heat it up for 7 or 8 minutes in the oven or a toaster oven, then when it comes out drop a piece of cheese, or some shredded mozzarella and enjoy. \u00a0And the manager was right, it's DELICIOUS!! Highly recommended!! \u00a0The loaf was huge so I took some to work to share with my co-workers. \u00a0I definitely will be buying this again my next trip to Carfagna's as it really hit the spot. \u00a0Next, we went over to the chicken. \u00a0They had a weekend special of 25 wings for $10.00 and it was a mix of drummies and wings. \u00a0The only issue was my fiance didn't really want many drummies. \u00a0So the lady helping me was able to sell me individual wings at 55 cents each. \u00a0I got 17 wings and 7 drummies. \u00a0I also got some of their barbecue and buffalo hot sauce which were really well priced and were an excellent marinade for my wings. \u00a0Later on that day we grilled up everything and wow..it all came out great. Carfagna's is legendary in the meat community and for good reason. \u00a0They really bring the best and most fresh ingredients you can buy. \u00a0If you just bought a grill, or have been grilling for years, this should be your first stop on the weekend to stock up for a cook out. \u00a0HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!P.S. as others have said the other non-meat stuff here such as chips and the like are a bit expensive but not too bad if you just forgot something at the grocery store. \u00a0I'd definitely hit up Krogers or someplace though before you come here for your meat as that can add up."], ["Pat B.", "Went to Carfagna's to purchase some chicken sausage the person behind the counter seemed to be new but doing fine and packaged the sausage by type and the price as they were marked, when I get to the check out and about to pay someone from the meat department came over \u00a0opens the paper wrapped raw chicken product directly on their dirty checkout counters and tells me they priced wrong and they were sausage not brauts and some other nonsense as she is counting them and changing the labels and prices.I was somewhat taken back as she acted like I changed the labels and was stealing something I just told her to keep them and left. There is nothing there I can not get someplace else.They also have the saddest plastic display of poorly made fake meat products hanging from their ceiling behind the counter, it must be a sign."], ["Jennifer J.", "We love carfagna's, we go here to buy our meat and we love everything!

Any chance we have to ditch Giant Eagle for Carfagnas we do! Also some incredible prepared pastas and salads!"], ["Dave J.", "The best place to buy red meat and chicken in the city. Not so sure about the fish. This place is always crowded and for good reason: the quality of the food is excellent. I didn't think buying meat I had to prepare myself would make a difference with where I got it since a cow is a cow and chickens cluck. This butchers quality comes through in the flavor even if you completely burn it to very well done on the grill. The steak burgers come out tasting restaurant quality for the price of less than a large fast food chain burger. If you are buying other groceries through their market, be prepared to pay. They specialize in butchered meats, not groceries, so the extra stuff will come at a cost. The only real downside- the parking there is atrocious some days. Between people not caring that painted lines mean take a single space, and the lot being very small for the crowds that are inside, be aware that parking here can be a challenge."], ["Jen M.", "I'm a big fan for reasons that lots of other folks have articulated here. I buy about 90% of my beef, pork, poultry, and deli meat at Carfagna's. The roast beef is to die for, basically tastes just like a good steak. Some other assorted tips and tricks:If you make a lot of soup, don't miss the prosciutto rough-end cubes in the little vacuum pack near the salt pork, in the case across from the chicken department. Carfagna's brings in a special guy just to shave their prosciutto for the deli section, and he saves all the hard ends. They're dirt cheap to buy and add tons of flavor to your food.If you're a frequent flyer at Carfagna's, they have an ongoing \"Buy $100 in gift cards, get $10 bonus certificate free\" promotion. The credit is good at Carfagna's and their restaurant in Polaris, Carfagna's kitchen.This is a full-service meat market, so don't be afraid to ask for specifically which piece of meat you want out of the case, ask for the biggest or smallest piece, ask if they might have a particular cut in the back, etc.They've got half a dozen types of sausage. The meat cutters will gladly help you pick out one that's ideal for your needs. I'm partial to the Festival sausage, which is mostly mild but has a wee little kick to it--just enough to give it personality."], ["Emily O.", "My friends and I went there a few nights ago for the first time. \u00a0We ordered the Carfagna Bread, Italian Wedding Soup, Salad with house dressing, Cheese Manicotti, Eggplant Parmesan, and Spicy Creamy Chicken Rigatelli. \u00a0We only tried the traditional sauce and I am in LOVE! The service was excellent. \u00a0You can buy any of their sauces and dressing in the restaurant and I think it is cheaper there than at the local grocery store."], ["Susan R.", "LOVE Carfagna's. I don't have much new to add to what has been said, but I will chime in with what I personally love about the store in case you, too, are looking for a store that suits these needs.*Meat. MEAT. We do a lot of our grocery shoppin' at Costco, actually (bulk fruits and veg for smoothies!), but I buy my meat from Carfagna's. They have inexpensive sausage that is wicked tasty. I'm loving the Grandpa Carfagna's sausage and I hope that's not a limited-time flavor; it's my favorite. I also love picking up pork shoulder there, which they have at a good price in reasonable sizes, and it's not even cut up into stupid \"steaks\" (SHOULDER SHOULD NOT MAKE STEAKS, BEXLEY KROGER). I'll buy enough for a couple of weeks at a time to save trips, and because they're affordable, I can manage this easily.*Deli items. They have *really* good pastrami for being in Columbus. And they let me try it before I decided to buy it, which is always a plus.*Cheese. Love me some cheese, although I wish it were organized a bit better and the selection was a little more consistent. (One week, for example, I found some good, reasonably-priced domestic parmigiana; it hasn't been in evidence since.) I'd be tickled pink if they had a solid, reasonably-priced pecorino Romano in a fist-sized chunk that I didn't have to pay more than $5-7 to walk out the door with. I would buy it all the time. Still, they have a real-deal cheese section and that puts them far above a lot of other grocers.*I do buy a few produce items here. When their tomatoes aren't gently rotting (which I've been noticing more here toward the end of the season), they are fantastic in-season. Good prices on zucchini, Brussels sprouts. I got some of their mushrooms and they did taste a little weird, though. Not bad, just weird.*Dry/shelf stable goods: If you're looking for an Italian ingredient, go here. They're likely to have it. They have a few other imported European goods, but it's very Italian-centric. And their sauce? AMAZING. Best jarred pasta sauce I have ever eaten.*They stock cold cans of San Pellegrino Limonata. Mmm. SO GOOD. And hubs doesn't like it, so I don't have to share."], ["Matthew L.", "Why in the 9 Hells would you buy steak from Giant Eagle or Kroger, when you could go and get FAR superior steaks for less here??? \u00a0Well, because you don't know it exists, of course!Best kept secret in town, it'd seem, and rightly so. \u00a0Fillets for $7 at MOST, and sometimes on sale for $5 a pop (and let me tell you, these are great fillets!), very good delmonicos and sirloin steaks, their steakburgers are amazing, and the party wings great and a great value.They also have something called a \"hot shot\" which is a pepper stuffed with prosciutto which is a great mix of flavors, and their Italian salad is also a nice treat (chunks of moz, pep and other various goodies). \u00a0Haven't tried their seafood, though it looks good, and their pasta and pasta sauce is also VERY worth it (LOVE LOVE LOVE the Vodka sauce).Their stuffed chicken should be avoided, and I'll admit that the staff though very good does seem to take some time to warm to newbs - I don't think I got a smile for at LEAST four or five visits, though they are good. \u00a0PS, parking CAN be tricky when they get super busy.Great wine and beer selection, and the icing on the cake? \u00a0Zagnut bars at the checkout. \u00a0FTW."], ["Robin P.", "best olive oil !!!! lefas and portoliva !!!!!!"], ["John N.", "THE butcher in town. \u00a0Period. \u00a0When you need quality and really great prices, this is where to go. \u00a0I drive a distance for it."], ["Mindy L.", "I have continued shopping for ALL of my meat at Carfagna's.

I have still been satisfied with the price, selection and quality as well as the customer service every time I shop there. I have also been going about every two weeks since I wrote my first review and even though it's summer I've still not smelled anything \"funky\" like another reviewer reported, nor have I heard anyone else complain of it either."], ["Ryan A.", "great traditional meat market with a surprisingly good wine selection.

The beef is full of flavor and has just the right texture, the chicken is hormone free and Amish raised, and the sausage is fresh and delicious.

There is often a wait, but that's due to the popularity of the place, not poor management, and you're always afforded enough time to make whatever selections your heart (and your stomach) desires. The butchers are very knowledgeable and helpful as well. Just be sure to listen for you number, else you'll get skipped.The deli is equally satisfying with a mixture of fine Boar's Head meats and a selection of imported and domestic Italian meats/cheeses. There is also a wealth of ready to eat specialties. The wine selection rivals much larger establishments, and they have many wonderful choices you'll fine few other places--real diamonds in the rough.

The food, the decor, the service. Everything was just great for us when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. They only take call aheads on the weekends (and only sometimes), but luckily, on a Thursday night it wasn't too busy, and we were able to get seated right away. Like everyone's said, this place probably only has 10-15 tables, so you may want to give them a call just to see if there's a wait. Our server was really nice and very knowledgeable about the entire menu.It's easy to over order here we came to find out. You already get complimentary gralic bread, so keep that in mind. We split the appetizer 'snack' platter which was anything but a snack and comes with two meatballs, the fritto, two big pieces of bruschetta and some salami, mortadella and cheese. The meatballs are so so good and so is the sauce that comes with them. The fritto was the favorite here. It's a bunch of cheese mixed with folded up cook spaghetti and fried, and it's amazing! I'm not sure how traditional this dish is, but it was damn delicious but also extremely filling, so remember that if you decided to go for the full size fritto.For my dinner, I really couldn't decide on anything, so I got the Giuseppe's Sampler. Our server said it's one of the most popular dishes, because people were having the same issue as me in making a decision, so they put their three most popular dishes on one plate: Eggplant parm, lasagna, and spaghetti and meatballs. The eggplant parm was tasty, but the lasagna was so cheesy and rich that I'd easily just order that the next time. My girlfriend agreed that it was the best thing she'd eaten that night.I could barely move by the end, but I did get a cannoli to go. Lola makes her own filling, and as someone who gets a cannoli any time I see, hear, or read about one, it was one of the better cannoli's I've had in Columbus.Forget about the super chic and fancy Italian restaurants in Columbus, because Lola and Giuseppe's has some of the best homecooked Italian I've had in the city at a much more affordable price. The small space is great for a date, and you can tell how much they really care about the food they're preparing. We'll definitely be back again."], ["Rachel J.", "Absolutely excellent! It feels like home from the minute you walk in the door thanks to the wonderful service and, of course, being greeted by Lola herself! My husband and I came here for a date night recently and will most definitely be back. The restaurant is small, but we arrived early and had no problem getting a seat for 2. Gradually we noticed it getting more crowded as we were there, but we would wait for this place. The food is excellent. Homemade, rustic Italian food that you can just feel was made with some love. I highly recommend the Pasta Fritto as an appetizer, so delicious! Don't come here if you are on a \"diet\" for sure! Also we heard upon coming here that you can't leave without trying one of Lola's homemade desserts. We ate a bit too much to leave room but ended up taking some cannolis to go and were SO glad we did. They were amazing! Definitely come here if you want authentic Italian food, great service and to really feel like part of the family!"], ["Vivian N.", "This is a cozy \"mom & pop\" place. There is limited seating and reservations are not accpted. There is call ahead seating (you call them just before you drive over) and carry out. The waitstaff and Lola make you feel at home and are attentive. When regulars walk in, Lola welcomes them in like family (unfortunately, I don't eat here frequently enough to be a regular). I usually like to buy a container or two of their pasta sauce after a visit to give away to my bf's father who claims it's as delicious as his Italian grandmother's recipe. I could definitely eat it plain.Another highlight to my dinners here is their Limoncello. It is housemade, rumour says it's made with Everclear, and it's sweet and creamy.

I believe that fresh ingredients and fresh herbs and spices are the key to almost any dish but, especially great Italian. After reading everyone's reviews on this restaurant, \u00a0I was very excited to try them. As much as it pains me to say this, I was disappointed. Now the decor of the place is very nice, it's a very homey setting and you really do get the feeling that you're visiting someone's home. But that can only carry a restaurant so far. In my opinion, the food there is entirely overpriced. Not so overpriced that you would think not to order it but it just causes you to give pause because you know that you've received the same dishes at other establishments for cheaper. I ordered Giuseppe salad (which was seven dollars!) which was basically a side salad with some pasta thrown in and the spaghetti and meatballs. Now the serving size wasn't bad, I must admit. And I had read other previous reviews were everyone raved about the sauce. As far as the sauce is concerned, I've actually had better at Monjuni's. And the key to almost any Italian restaurant is the quality of the pasta. It's universally known and excepted that pasta needs to be cooked \"Al dente\" Unfortunately, I found that the other reviews that I read were correct, the pasta was overcooked. The sauce had ENTIRELY too much Parmesan and the item that I enjoyed the most on the entire meal was the endless garlic bread. Now I'm not one to visit a place one time and condemn them from that point on. I'll probably give this place another shot later on in the future.

I would've got the one if it was Friday, but I settled on my initial choice of the chicken marsala. The waitress recommended it without hesitation, \u00a0as well.

We got there early at about 5:30 pm and didn't have an issue finding a table. \u00a0They don't have a big menu, but we got some wine & the eggplant appetizer while we figured out our entrees. \u00a0That and the complimentary toasted garlic bread took the edge off of our hunger while we waited for our dinners. \u00a0I got the chicken parmiagiana. \u00a0It was excellent - hot, gorgeous looking, tasty, and just the right size. \u00a0I was stuffed, and had a couple of pieces of chicken to take as leftovers. \u00a0Noticed they had homemade limonicello, so ordered a glass as an aperitif and had the limonicello gelato. \u00a0What a great end to the meal! \u00a0The bill wasn't cheap, but fair for the quality of food - a worthwhile indulgence. \u00a0A terrific meal, and one to recommend and repeat whenever I'm in the area!"], ["Glen S.", "In a world of fabricated ambiance, scent machines and distilled culture, one can easily become cynical when it comes to restaurants that seem to be real... and feel so good upon entry. \u00a0Let me tell you...

It starts with the bistro like setting. \u00a0Add then the staff - both family and friends, and of course the food. \u00a0The food... Ah, the food.Soup of onion with sweet Marsala, carmelized onions, cream... topped with grated cheese and toasted crusted bread. \u00a0You've never had it like this before... And neither had I. \u00a0 I won't forget. \u00a0We ordered two entrees... Chicken Parmesan and a Baked manicotti with sausage and peppers. \u00a0Sublime. \u00a0Neither is a complicated dish. \u00a0Both though require a deep sauce and quality ingredients. \u00a0These had it all. \u00a0Like Firenze... with those shiny doors that beckoned me to admire their craftsmanship years ago, I simply loved seeing the entrees coming from that kitchen... \u00a0I wanted to touch and taste them all. \u00a0Each item obviously made with care and tradition. \u00a0I admire the touch given to the food here...

That day she got my name and every time I've been back she knows me by name and remembers that we drive in from the Marysville area.

I want this review to be as thorough as possible.Saturday afternoon - called at 5 pm to see if they took reservations. I was told no, but I stated that we expected to be there at 6:45, and was told there would probably be a \"few minutes\" wait.We arrived at 6:45 to a madhouse. This restaurant is tiny; maybe 15 tables; and there were several large parties. That \"few minutes\" turned out to be 50 minutes of standing; no place to sit.The noise level was deafening. There must have been 14 people waiting and it was raining so we were all bunched by the door. There is no way to have a \"private\" conversation here; we could overhear everyone around us. Some people will not mind, some will; I am just reporting the facts. If you are looking for intimacy, you will not find it here. Finally seated 50 minutes later, our waitress greeted us and we ordered a bottle of wine, very reasonable at $22. She brought garlic bread which was average. We ordered one Melanzane appetizer and one Giuseppe salad. As a main course, we ordered the lasagne and the veal marsala. We liked the salad but be warned, the dressing is loaded with fresh garlic.The Melanzane took over 30 minutes to arrive, but \u00a0the eggplant was tender and well prepared, although I felt the breading was a bit thick. By the time we finished the appetizer, we had been at the restaurant over 2 hoursFortunately, the lasagne arrived within 10 minutes of the appetizer. \u00a0It was a huge dish and could easily have been split. Now I understand why every finished table had several \"to go\" boxes. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce is a bit salty, but it was still quite good - and it was obvious the pasta was freshly made. But it was when I received my veal that the whole experience went to pieces.I cook. \u00a0I have made and eaten marsala dozens of times. When the plate was placed in front of me, I was truly surprised by what I saw. I order my marsala wine from Italy. It is a light caramel color and slightly sweet; and when prepared well is a delicious compliment to veal or chicken. The plate in front of me had beautiful veal covered in a mushroom sauce that was nearly black. The sauce was so thick that it had completely congealed to the plate and food; there was no movement to it. I tasted the sauce and not surprisingly it was bitter and had no sweetness left. \u00a0The waitress came back to check on our meal and noticed I was not eating mine. I reluctantly explained that this was not what I expected from a marsala sauce and that I didn't really care for the preparation. She offered another dish but I think she didn't know what to do, so she went and got Lola.This is when the night turned into an SNL skit. If it hadn't have been me, I would have been laughing.After I gently explained how I prefer my marsala sauce, Lola proceeded to LOUDLY rebut that Giuseppe travels to Italy to attend cooking school, and that his preparation was AUTHENTIC. Lola was not the least interested in my opinion of the sauce. At her insistence,they brought another plate - exactly the same. Understand, the veal was prepared perfectly - tender and amazing. The sauce just ruined it. She demanded I tell her how I liked the second plate while standing over me; putting me on the spot. I could not lie and say I liked it. She about lost it. She went on, (and ON) about how they BOIL the wine down by 75% and don't use chicken stock; exactly as they do in Italy, (most recipes use stock). She looked somewhat shocked when I told her I have been all over Italy and never had \u00a0it prepared that way; most recipes call for a reduction of 25% to 50% including stock, not 75% without. This woman argued with me, yelled at me and embarrassed me in front of the other patrons, (who were shifting uncomfortably in their seats as she proceeded to BLAST me). But the \"pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" was when she pronounced in front of the entire restaurant that I had made her 78 year old husband CRY!!!I get it about Italians being passionate; I'm married to one; but this borders on psychosis. I actually hope SNL writers use this review to do a skit - the poor unsuspecting patron on the receiving end of \u00a0a tongue lashing by the crazy Italian lady over her audacity to not give 5 stars to the veal . Now I understand why everyone is so effusive in praise of the food - they had better be! How do own a restaurant and not be able to take a little criticism of FOOD? After the fact, this whole situation is funny; a real life parody; but at that moment I wasn't laughing and was a bit traumatized. We paid $110.00 for this disaster of an experience. I could put up with the crowds, the noise, the cramped quarters, the having to walk through the kitchen to the bathroom, the wait with nowhere to sit; but not Lola. It wouldn't matter if this was the best Italian food in Columbus."], ["Carol F.", "Hard to find.,, worth the trip \u00a0 Family italian place that is quaint and cozy. \u00a0Caprese salad was delicious ! \u00a0Fresh tomatoes, perfect mozarella and sweet basil covered by beautiful balsamic vinegar, \u00a0The Sicilian onion soup is worth the trip alone- to die for!! \u00a0Our table had lasagne-excellent , chicken Marsala -perfect meal with risotto and fresh green beans, and baked rigatoni. \u00a0Our only regret was that they were out of tiramisu. \u00a0- so we tried the carrot cake instead---while not a usual Italian dessert option.

After a few Google searches for good Italian I ran across Lola's. On a whim one night I went with my family for a back to school celebration. The space is small & so quaint. I love the individual rooms. The best part for me was Lola walking around & talking to everyone. I am a huge fan of the owner of restaurants being around serving and interacting. If you do not like loud environments, you may not like this. The music overflowed in the atmosphere & Lola's boisterous personality warmed the whole place up. I loved everything about it. When we got there we were given a warm basket of garlic bread which I could have eaten as a meal itself, so great! We ordered the pasta fritta as an appetizer. The best i've ever had. It was made perfectly & again could be a meal in itself. Around the table we ordered all over the menu. From the ravioli (very different- rich, some may not be a fan, I loved it!), to the Fettuccine Alfredo, everything was so great.You get a lot of food, we had quite a few take away boxes. We also ordered Tiramisu for dessert, as I had read you should never go without getting their dessert and we were not dissapointed. It was finished the second we got home & was so delicious in many ways. I am giving Lola's a five out of five. I think finding an authentic Italian restaurant in a neat area of Columbus is hard to find, and is hard to beat with Lola's around. I will definitely be coming back for more! The only disappointing thing will be when I finish the leftovers. I left with such a warmth in my stomach & happiness in my soul."], ["bryan h.", "small mom-and-pop restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall, both of which make it fantastic. everything is made to order and probably the best red sauce I've ever had. will definitely be going back."], ["Sharmeela S.", "Such comforting delicious Italian food. \u00a0Fresh and classics done well with a little bit of a twist. \u00a0The ravioli had roasted cauliflower accompanying it.

It was a generous portion and we ate for a couple days following.Carrot cake was excellent as well; liked that it had cherries as well.Like the other reviews state, place is small and there isn't really an waiting area, so come early."], ["Holly J.", "If you want an amazing Italian experience- this is very quaint and impressive.

How she remembers me I don't know but I have taken every friend I have here that will listen I think you will appreciate the authenticity of the place! Every bite is amazing. Every occasion is celebrated. No matter who I share this experience with we leave with a smile knowing we just experienced the best passionate food venue that Gahanna has to offer.

Luscious tomatoes, fragrant basil, fresh zucchini and eggplant . . . well, you won't find any of that at Lola & Guisseppe's restaurant. Our meal began with bruschetta: hoagie-style garlic bread piled high with bland tomato slices. My spaghetti and meatballs had two huge tasty meatballs but the tomato sauce tasted metallic and acidic. The side order of asparagus was four of the skinniest spears I've ever seen, served tepid with dots of congealed butter. My husband's ravioli was tasty, but it was swimming in a yellow gelatinous sauce. My friend's salmon was perfectly cooked. Except for the asparagus and salmon, all portions are enough to serve 2-3 people. Our server was friendly and efficient, and Lola gave us a warm welcome when we arrived. The bathroom off the kitchen was clean, but oddly enough there was a religious pamphlet, a hairbrush and a lipstick in there. It was like being in someone's house. \u00a0In spite of all the fans, it was very warm in the restaurant, and by 7 o'clock the noise level was deafening."], ["Bob J.", "This place has charm and personality!Authentic family owned and operated fine dining restaurant. \u00a0You will leave feeling like you just had a great meal with friends."], ["Frank D.", "Wow! This is a very cozy place. The place was packed, literally out the door. \u00a0The seating is very intimate and staff is exceptionally nice. Lola actually knew a lot of her customers by name and engaged them in conversation with the new people. I noticed that when she asked each group how many and their name to be seated - she spoke to the female and took her name; adding her own observation. For example: She asked the young girl \"and what is your name, beside beautiful?\" \u00a0Lola did not lie or exaggerate. The girl did brighten the room. \u00a0:o)I came in for carry out on a Friday night. \u00a0Lola explained that due to the volume of people they service on the weekend, they discourage take-away orders on Friday and Saturday. Then she asked what I wanted and I said spaghetti and red sauce. She said OK - walked toward the kitchen and said two meat balls ok? and I said yes. \u00a0Next thing I know I'm walking out with enough spaghetti for two people The garlic bread was very good. \u00a0I'm not a big bread person, but this was good. Just the right amount of marinara sauce. The sauce was really good, as I'm writing this I'm starting to nod off from the food comma.

It wasn't as large a dish as some other at the table like the shrimp fra diavolo \u00a0but that was perfect because it left room for the best part: THE TIRAMISU!!!!

We also ordered the Carmelized Onion soup which was sweet yet rich and creamy and the Caesar side salad which features house made dressing. \u00a0The Caesar dressing was among the best I've ever had.One of our entrees was the Gnocchi accompanied by Italian sausage which was seasoned perfectly. \u00a0The chewy gnocchi stood up well to the moderately thick slices of sausage and tomato sauce. \u00a0The other entree was the Chicken Parmigiana. \u00a0The Chicken Parm was crisp but not oily and was served atop a bed of perfectly cooked al dente Spaghetti. \u00a0The house made sauce was a great blend of acidic and sweet. \u00a0Against my better wishes, I almost cleaned my plate it was so good! \u00a0I hate left overs but took a little bit home because it was too good to waste.For dessert we sampled the Cannelloni, the Bread Pudding, and the Tiramisu. \u00a0 \u00a0All are house made, and all were great. \u00a0The Bread Pudding was dense but not too heavy, the Tiramisu was among the best I've ever tasted, and the Cannelloni was the best I've ever had.For all this food, our bill was 50% less than I would have expected, making this a great value too. \u00a0Lola was exquisite in the dining room. \u00a0She is the type of owner a guest wants to see in the dining room: \u00a0quirky, funny, sincere, friendly, and most importantly hospitable. \u00a0This was the best meal I have had in a long time, and I will definitely be back - sooner than later. \u00a0My next meal will be the Clam Linguini. \u00a0And the carrot cake since it was sold out...Lastly, \u00a0I have never written a YELP review in my life but my experience at Lola's was so great I felt it was the responsible thing to do.

My familiy is Italian and we are serious about our food and so is Lola and her husband who hang out at the restaurant and make sure you're enjoying yourself. It's nice to see how passionate they are. \u00a0It's a very tiny place with two rooms and a total of about 10 tables with some outdoor seating. \u00a0The menu has slight variety. The prices are average. I had the wedding soup which was microwaved (I saw and heard it) to a lava hot temp before I got it and it was just not very good (no seasoning and too few meatballs). I'm pretty particular about my wedding soup and so far, Cafe del Mundo is holding the Wedding Soup award.Anyway, moving on! We ordered the Aranccini (cheese stuffed rissotto ball breaded and fried) and boy was it good! I haven't had any that good again! It was a huge size, cooked right through and through, great cheese, and yummy maranara dipping. Highly recommended. I ordered a pesto salad, which i really enjoyed. Even though it was over dressed, the dressing was so pestoey good I didn't mind. I love inventive salads and this was definitely one! My boyfriend had the pasta alfredo that suffered 'alfredo sydrome' and was all gloppy and blah. I would like to try a meatball in the furute, that's always a good italian food test ;)For me Lola's missed the mark. It just didn't wow me beyond it's cuteness and the aranccini.

Although the restaurant is on the smaller side the front and back of the house can accommodate larger parties. The fare is what I'd consider \"Italian New\" with a good selection of meat, poultry and fish dishes. They had a nice pre-fixe meal too at $30. Also, lovely small plates to share. I had the walleye and it was outstanding. One of the specials they had was a chanterelle mushroom appetizer. Apparently they have someone that goes foraging for them when they are in season. Crazy!

Definitely coming back again."], ["Sara L.", "I was visting the Columbus area and looking for a good restaurant to have dinner. As always, I went on Yelp to check it out beforehand. I saw nothing but great reviews for G Micheal's Bistro so I decided to give it a try. I'm truly not sure why this restaurant has such good reviews because my experience there was quite the contrary.Our waiter and hostess were both very unprofessional and rude. That aside, everyone at my table ordered appetizers (pork, gazpacho, octopus, and salad). The only person who liked/finished their meal was my friend who ordered the salad and even at that he was not impressed. We decided not to order entrees as the service and food was less than exceptional. In my opinion, the food was overpriced and not good. I was disappointed in my experience."], ["Jane F.", "After all these years, finally, by accident we stumbled on to happy hour at G Michaels with 8 minutes left!I will go back. We had octopus, smelt, and pork belly appetizers for the happy hour price of $7 a plate. We also had a HH sazerac and a negroni (a bit too sweet, served with crushed ice).The smelt was good quality but not quite right on the fry. It should have been crispier. The octopus and pork belly were delicious.We ate at the bar and our server was knowledgable and attentive. I wish I had remembered her name to add to this comment. She was very knowledgeable about the wine list - an impressive list.We had a wonderful Alsace cremant followed by a french syrah blend I had never heard of - delicious. We paired the last wine with the flat-iron steak, cooked perfectly, that we split for a $4 up charge for splitting a plate. So \u00a0- happy hour -- really good.

The inside was a little dark (even in a fancy upscale restaurant standard) so we opt for sitting at the patio. The patio was very nice though! The server was very professional and attentive.Food: the appetizers are really good, especially with the $7 happy hour special. We shared shrimp & grits, octopus, and the pork belly. The octopus and pork are fine, but the shrimp & grits are soooo good! I lived in Atlanta for four years and shrimp & grits is always my favorite. But the dish here even beats many southern restaurant! Plus the portion is huge (can't imagine the entree size lol). The lamb entree is not bad.They have valet parking but we easily find a street parking spot."], ["Zach T.", "The happy hour here is pretty dope. Half off the small plates and like $3 for their draft beer is kinda unbeatable. They don't have a huge beer selection here, but the few they do have are solid. And the small plates were delicious. I had the pork belly, which was pretty good tho not as tender as pork belly typically should be. Good flavor tho. And then the shrimp and grits which was my favorite part. Very flavorful, and a pretty big portion for the price. The sausage is also a really nice touch and adds a kick of spice to true dish. Overall very happy with this place, but be aware the happy hour only applies if you sit at the bar, which has only about 10-12 seats probably so get here early before it fills up."], ["Jillian M.", "I don't consider myself to be a fancy person. I rarely go out to nicer, more expensive restaurants around town, and I'd rather be in a dive bar or a diner. That being said, I LOVED this place! I came with a group for happy hour, and it truly is the best way to experience the food and atmosphere of what is otherwise a slightly cost-prohibitive establishment (at least for me). Other reviewers are correct -- place a reservation if you can, as this place has happy hour in the bar area starting at 4:30, and by 5pm it was already filling up. You can make a reservation online with Open Table, and specify that you'd like bar area seating.Our server was very attentive and helpful, and gave her recommendations for the specialty drinks and small plates that she preferred. All of their specialty cocktails are $5, the draft beer is $3, and the small plates were $7! I had an AMAZING plate of shrimp and grits that made my eyes roll back into my head. The grits were cheesy, and so soft that it felt like eating mashed potatoes. I was very excited to have a chance to try a small plate that is actually on their regular entree menu. It's as good as everyone says! The calamari here is also excellent, and the lamb poutine is decadent; with lamb as soft as pot roast. There is another gorgeous room with huge windows off to the side for regular diners, as well as a patio area. I will definitely be back for happy hour again, and I may even consider dining here for dinner on a special occasion. DO NOT MISS THIS HAPPY HOUR!"], ["Carol N.", "Husband and I wanted to use one more of our Dine Originals cards before they expired and I chose G Michael's. We made an Open Table reservation since we had no idea if it would be crowded and we were seated immediately. Our server, Mike, was incredibly friendly and accommodating. He took our drink orders, saw I was expecting, and asked if I wanted a mocktail (of course I did). He brought me the most delicious raspberry lime mocktail and husband loved his Old Fashioned. I had the fried Gerber chicken and husband had the chicken fried steak. Both were cooked to perfection and well-paired with their sides. We didn't order appetizers in order to save room for dessert and we were so glad we did. Husband had the apple crisp and I had the lemon and gingerbread tart. I could eat that gingerbread crust for every meal, every day. We were so impressed with the food, atmosphere and service and will definitely be returning."], ["Kathryn W.", "I am going to go out on a limb and probably say... at this point in my life. This is my favorite Columbus restaurant! I had been begging my husband to take me here for 3 years and he finally stepped up and took me on my Birthday (Props to Derek)!We had a reservation, so it was easy to get in and have a seat. I definitely recommend reservations if you plan in advance, because we went on a Thursday and it was very busy, so I can only imagine on the weekends.We started with drinks, and mind you they have a very large wine list with a wide price range, so if you don't want to break the bank, you don't have to.Our appetizer were the Oysters Rockefeller. They were the best. I always say, anywhere that has Oysters Rockefeller is just trying to tease me, I could eat over 10 of them, but they give you 4. And that's anywhere.After staring at the menu for what felt like 15 minutes, I finally went with the filet with a lobster butter and it was the best choice I think I could have made. It was cooked perfectly and had the best flavor.What I like about G. Michaels is that is has a southern flare. I lived in Charleston for 3 years and the minute I read the menu I could see the Southern touches jumping out at me. It brought me back to the time when I lived in Charleston. It was a nice fix for when Im craving that Southern food. They know exactly what it's all about.And not to forget, our waiter was extremely helpful and very sociable. He was great to have through our dining experience.If your a foodie, this place HAS to be on your list."], ["Bryant M.", "G Michael's is one of those places that I'd heard about ever since moving to Columbus, and I just now finally got around to trying it. Shame on me...Let me set the scene: A winter night in German Village, with snow gently covering the brick streets. On the outside, G Michael's looks like the other gorgeous brick houses in the village, and inside it's dark, rich, and swanky. This is a perfect date spot.G Michael's was one of the pioneers in the modern day Columbus food scene. I think its age and maturity are both a blessing and a curse.On one hand, this place is a well-oiled machine, and everything is absolutely perfect. The interior is pristine, the service is top-notch, and the food is divine. I had one of the best steaks of my life--you know... the kind that make your eyes roll back in your head. They also have an incredible wine selection--my friend and I easily polished off a bottle between us. Oh, and they handled my stupid wheat thing like total pros. Our server was absolutely lovely too. He was a bit formal for me (actually, G Michael's as a whole was a tad stiff for my taste), but he was still warm, friendly, and joked around with us. 5 stars for him.And on the other hand, something about this place felt a little off. When I went to the restroom, they had these placards all over the wall touting awards they had won--about a decade ago. I think that was pretty indicative of any small qualms I had with G Michael's: a little like they were resting on their laurels of yesteryear. While everything was technically perfect, it didn't seem alive. No one seemed excited about being there to provide this stellar experience. \u00a0 But let me be clear: any small negatives I had here were *my* issue--not theirs. It's just about taste preferences.G Michael's is most definitely on the fancier side, and the price reflects it. But hey--when you're talking about perfect, it ain't cheap. I do hear they have an outstanding happy hour, so I'll be sure to come for that soon!"], ["Jennifer S.", "Dined there for my first time to celebrate my birthday. \u00a0Everything from the valet service to the must have house salad with poached pears set the standard. \u00a0 I ordered the seared scallops which were cooked to perfection & lifted by the citrusy 3 bean salad."], ["Michael W.", "Once again this place astounds.

G Michaels has been, I must admit, my go to place for a long time. The food is always excellent, the staff is allowed to have a sense of humor which they use with great abandon and the owner is a tremendous fellow with a smile for everyone and the patience of a saint when the place gets busy. We usually sit at the bar so as to not take up a four-top, as the place is not huge. The crowd is kind of mid-fi yuppie with a smattering of delightful geriatrics and the occasional colorful local, but more laid back than the \"smell me\" crowd as say Lindy's or the Sycamore. The shrimp and grits are, as reported, excellent (if you're nice, they'll find some grits for you as a side) and the pork chop is great. I like the specials as occasionally the chef sees fit to whip up something with sweetbreads. Their pastas are awesome too. Would like to see a bit more variation on their small plates, but outside of that, it is always a fun place to go. Afterwards, take a stroll to the bookstore. You can get lost in there!"], ["Jen R.", "You know when you walk into a place and you can tell everyone who works there is a professional? This is what I love about G. Michael's. From the valet to the host; to the bartender to the server, everyone who works there takes pride in their craft and are nothing less than professional in my experiences. It makes you feel pretty special and excited for the night ahead when the valet recognizes you and welcomes you back after only your second visit. I've never met the chefs, but by tasting the food, it's obvious they are proud of what they do as well. If you want your life changed, order the shrimp and grits. Great cocktails and wine list as well. The clientele seems to be a great mixture of people who have been dining there for years or are out trying a new place. Love that you can get dressed up, or come in for a relaxed dinner. Either way, you feel taken care of here, and it's obvious why this restaurant is ranked one of the best in the city."], ["J.

Muscles were on point each falling out of their shell effortlessly and not a single one had reached that chewy over steamed texture. Next up was the broiled pork loin. Deeeeeelish the bbq sauce they use as garnish was so savory and paired perfectly with the corn bread that came with it. Finally I enjoyed a vanilla tart which was the weakest portion of the meal but coming from someone who really isn't a desert lover, this still wasn't all that bad."], ["Lauren L.", "We had a great dining experience here from start to finish. \u00a0Our server, Daryl, was wonderful, the food and drinks were great, and the ambiance charming. \u00a0The restaurant is one of those cute little brick buildings in the German Village a few blocks from Pistachio Vera and the Book Shop. \u00a0Inside the decor is fresh and minimalistic with a lot of brick showing and plenty of windows. \u00a0As the place filled up it did become rather loud though I noticed they did have a lot of the noise dampening ceiling hangings far out of eyesight.We were pleasantly surprised that we had stumbled into the brand new fall menu (it was on its second day so there were no \"specials\" yet to speak of). \u00a0Husband had the root veggie soup (reminiscent of many french soups I have had before where everything is pureed but the flavors peek thru very subtly). \u00a0I had the butternut squash salad to start. \u00a0I loved my dish- there was a lot of vinegar bringing out the sweetness of the squash but complimenting the salty pancetta and earthy pecans.The food was excellently seasoned, well cooked, and the portions VERY generous. \u00a0Husband did the pork chop with pulled pork- it was perfectly cooked so it had all the juiciness and none of the dry, leathery feel a lean pork chop could end up becoming. \u00a0His mashed potatoes were just so-so, a little watery and without much seasoning. \u00a0I had the trout which was done perfectly- nice and flaky with just the right amount of pecan crusting. \u00a0The sauce complimented the dish well as did the broccolini. The risotto was a little bit of a let down because it was runny and the texture was off: risottos I tend to like have that creamy, richness that makes you feel like you are eating something quite decadent. \u00a0For dessert we split the lemon tart, very refreshing and incredibly tasty.I have to say our server, Daryl, was incredibly friendly, very knowledgable and quite ready to answer any of our questions. \u00a0He gave me a great suggestion for my wines (they have a decent selection). \u00a0I noticed at other tables the servers were also ready to chat with the customers (kind of hard not to notice as the place got more crowded and noisier). \u00a0You definitely were treated well here by everyone from the hostess to the valet staff. \u00a0Overall this was \u00a0great night out and we would love to come back soon."], ["Stefphanie H.", "This eclectic restaurant is located in the historic German Village.

We went for restaurant week and were not disappointed. Wish they would participate in another one. They're fantastic and it was an amazing deal. We come here often for happy hour--it's one of the best in town. The cocktails are delicious and the food is a steal. You can even reserve a table in the bar but it gets crowded so call early. The crowd leans a little older so we were not excited about going at first and it was months before we came here even though we live in the neighborhood. Boy, were we wrong. Don't let that dated neon sign turn you off. It's not a hip place but they know how to cook and you get generous portions of delicious food. TIPS:They have a gluten-free menu available.

I had two specialty drinks from their long list, and three small plates:Buttermilk fried quail -If these were regular chicken wings, then this dish would have been solid, but as a whole fried quail, it was ingenious. The buttermilk batter was light and crispy, and the quail was moist and fresh.Brussels Sprouts -It takes real skill to make brussels sprouts palatable, and the chef delivers. It's almost like a challenge: we know that they're supposed to be good for us, but can you make a dish that tastes good as well? G Michael's answer to this challenge is to add pancetta, nuts, and a creamy gruyere sauce. Excellent choice.Shrimp and grits with andouille sausage and country ham -This was a miss for me. As a personal preference, I dislike dishes that are sour without much else. Both the shrimp and grits are bland in nature, and so the overwhelming flavor of this dish consists of the tomato broth. There was enough creaminess to balance out the tomato, but I would have liked some more flavor to round out the dish.Overall, G Michael's serves fantastic food at a great price point. I'll be back several times after this."], ["Yousra Z.", "Food was good but not great - maybe I was just expecting more. My co-workers really like this place. Def unique ideas - but maybe just to bland for me."], ["Sean D.", "Few times am I able to say a restaurant has achieved excellence in both food and service. G Michaels excels at both. Unlike other German Village establishments, G Michaels is not stuffy and does not rest on their laurels. This has been my third trip in 2 years and each time is better than the last. I especially appreciated the service provided to us by our server. He knew exactly when to be part of the conversation with his attentive service and quick wit without being overbearing. Thank you!

Michael's while visiting my family. We all had a really agonizing time reading the menu, as everything screamed \"Pick Me\"! \u00a0My father usually has their Shrimp and Grits, and is always delighted with it. Not being a grits fan myself, I usually find other choices beckoning me more loudly, but if I come here often enough, I will try the Shrimp & Grits just on the strength of his and others' strong recommendations! Back to my own dinner: \u00a0I splurged on a small plate of Sauteed Brussels Sprouts with ricotta salata, chestnuts, fresh thyme, celeriac and bourbon honey reduction. Oh my gosh, it was just divine! --and that was without ordering it with the additional bacon! I'd order this again in a heartbeat. Next in this splurge-fest was the Griddled Belgian Endive Salad, with toasted hazelnuts, saba-evoo drizzle, roasted grapes, and goat cheeses---also divine. At this point, I really didn't NEED an entree, but....I just couldn't pass up the chance to have the Sauteed Sweetbreads with penne, Swiss chard, white beans, tomatoes, and roasted garlic, served in herbed veal cream sauce and sweet and sour capers. An unusual concoction, I found the combination delicious, but I could probably have done a better job describing it had I not already been fairly full after the other dishes. Also on the menu and adding confusion to the task of ordering initially were a Pheasant Pot Pie, Mustard BBQ Swordfish, and Pork Cheeks (!), and of course, I will still have to come back to try the Shrimp & Grits (LOL). \u00a0Obviously, the chef at G. Michael's is inspired as well as excellent. Highly recommended."], ["Jennifer A.", "Went for my birthday dinner - it was fantastic. We each ordered a special - mine was a perfectly charred ribeye (although it was a little overcooked, it still tasted great) with mashed potatoes and a delicious shredded Brussels sprouts/bacon mixture and 3 delightfully fluffy crab fritters. My boyfriend got the scallops with risotto - they were nice size, sweet and tender. The bisque was excellent for an appetizer, and the house salad was great but way too big (4 people could split it) and a little over-dressed. The lemon custard gingerbread dessert was superb! Service was excellent - we really enjoyed ourselves and definitely will go back!"], ["Sharon T.", "I lived in Columbus for a long time, and this was one of the VERY few places that I would take my LA friends to. \u00a0The food here is seasonal, but consistent and amazing! \u00a0They believe in using local growers to ensure everything is fresh. \u00a0And boy is everything fresh!We always partake in their Restaurant Week offerings. \u00a0Menu is limited but you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. \u00a0Go go go when you see that they're participating in it!Some highlights: \u00a0shrimp and grits, their duck and braised lamb shank entrees. \u00a0These are usual staples on the menu, and they are my usual suggestions to anyone who is a first timer. \u00a0They usually have specials, and pay attention. \u00a0These specials are truly SPECIAL, so if anything strikes your fancy, get it.Service is attentive and well trained. \u00a0Again, I had been going there off and on for the last 10 years, and some of their servers have been there that long. \u00a0Wine list is interesting, but it doesn't change too much. \u00a0Too bad they don't offer up a simple corkage fee so that you can bring your own bottle to celebrate a special occasion. \u00a0I think I would give them 5 stars if they started doing this. \u00a0Since moving back to LA, it's one of the few places I actually miss eating at.

Well worth the price to come here when you can!"], ["Aaron F.", "G Michael's is now one of our favorite go to restaurants. The perfect blend of elegance and yet not stuffy or pretentious. The hostess was friendly and courteous. Our waiter Tim was prompt, always new when to appear to refill a water glass or replace a dropped napkin. We each had a glass of wine (Cab and Zin) both reasonably priced for the quality of wine. Their entire wine list provides a good variety and minimal over retail mark-up. We had the Strudel appetizer and it was terrific. What a variety of flavors in one dish. I took our waiter's recommendation and ordered the lamb shank special (over my intended order of pork chop) which was prepared over whipped potatoes and green beans with walnuts and it was delicious! My wife had the rabbit scallopine and it was outstanding. The food came out in a timely fashion, we never felt rushed but also did not have to wait.

As a frequent drive by, I often questioned the size of this place and ability to service a good crowd, but after being recommended to go I took the plunge. To start, the host stand is WAYYY too far off from the entrance. If you've never been, you risk looking like a lost puppy or insecure socialite without this review (HA) read on....upon entering you will be \"flagged down\" by hostess who will then seat you. The restaurant extends well beyond my initial impressions and offers seating on a back open room situated next to an open concept kitchen. I LOVED this part, but thats definitely personal preference. If you have something against watching expensive food being cooked by 20 something's, ask to be seated in front. This however, was exciting for me. Wine list is nice and server was helpful. Not extremely knowledge but above my level so hey- I appreciated his input. The shrimp and grits appetizer is just as described and tasty. I ordered the duck for my entree; crust was perfect and it was the temp to be expected for medium rare, but just cool and chewy by the time I ate which had me leave the center pieces for scrap. The special that night however was a local ribeye- cooked perfectly and would have me coming back to order just that- oh wait it was a special...All it all it was a solid place. I wasn't impressed per say, but got what was described and friendly service. Decent wine list and had menu options for everyone's taste. Would go back on a weekend maybe, but suitable for a weekday meal also. If your looking for a really impressive dinner, go north to The Refectory, but for a little different and above average close to downtown, nice spot."], ["Brooke W.", "Couldn't be happier with the decision I made to have my birthday dinner at G.

Using a Groupon. Coming in for happy hour. Or, in the case of my visit to G. Michael's Bistro, coming for Restaurant Week 2013 and trying their Prix Fixe menu. I love Restaurant Week because it gives me a chance to try excellent restaurants for a fraction of the regular price, it's helping a great cause(the Mid-Ohio Foodbank), and if it's good, that means I'll be coming back and paying the big bucks later. And for this joint, I will defiantly be coming back. First of all, this place is adorable. It's in a beautiful old brick building in German Village and while it appears small on the outside, the interior is actually really roomy and inviting. The bar is INCREDIBLE. The wine list is out of this world and my boyfriend and I both had a hard time choosing what to drink. The servers and host were very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had and the service was not slow at all. Second of all, THE FOOD. SO GOOD. Since the Prix Fixe menu is one I don't believe they normally offer(or maybe it is and if not, it should be), you might not find these particular selections, but I'm sure the regular menu is just as good. For our first course, I started with the free form ravioli. It was pasta sheets with roasted vegetables(zucchini, eggplant, red onion, and spinach) in a garlic cream sauce. My boyfriend had the braised Ohio beef tongue(as always, he's a little more adventurous than me), but I did have a bite and it was delicious and came with roasted sweet potatoes and red cabage and a sweet and sour sauce. We both had the same entree for our second course. A 6oz USDA prime sirloin with creamy mac and cheese, a lobster and shrimp fritter, and grilled broccolini with a Dijon sauce. It was to die for. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything else on the plate was heaven. For dessert, we both had the Bailey's panna cotta and we had never had panna cotta before and now that dessert has two new fans. It was excellent. Again, I can't emphasize enough how awesome it is that a restaurant, especially one considered one of the best in the city, would treat guests who aren't paying full price as awesome as G. Michael's did. We had a great night and we can't wait to come back and tell friends about it."], ["EJ B.", "meh"], ["J T.", "Meh. Food is ok. \u00a0This was my 4th visit, all roughly about the same experience - including the sewer smell wafting in the air. Fairly lackluster. \u00a0Server forgot our bread basket and was drink pushing. \u00a0I over tipped for the service we received. Lindey's is far better."], ["Laura C.", "It's been a few years since I was last here, and thought it'd be a great place for an Anniversary dinner plus restaurant week. My bf isn't from Columbus so I was excited to show him this gem. Why the lower rating? Read on. I ordered off the RW menu- house salad, scallops with gnocchi and baked apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. Bf got the house salad, shrimp and grits small plate and duck confit gumbo small plate. Our salads came out and his was about twice the size of mine. Good salad but felt pretty jipped. Isn't the point of RW to let people done at your restaurant when it would otherwise be too expensive? Anyways on the the mains. While my scallops were delicious and cooked just right, there were only 3 and the food was a tad too cool. There were about 5 or 6 pieces of sweet potato gnocchi. The dish needed at least a dozen gnocchi - one for each bite of scallop (got about 4 bites per scallop) and maybe then some. The sauce was amazing but again needed some more of that. For the $30 it just felt short changed. The bf's shrimp in the shrimp and grits were super rubbery! Never in my life have I tasted rubbery shrimp - even frozen from the grocery store. Also only 3 regular sized shrimps in a $10 dish. The duck confit gumbo was amazinnnng. Calling it a gumbo is a bit misleading as the texture and resemblance wasn't that of gumbo. I just had a couple bites of it but I could tell it's a pretty filling dish for $9. We both agreed the dessert was very yummy. Bf said it was the best part of the meal. Towards the end of our meal it started to get super cold in our booth (was never warm or comfortable to begin with though). We were in the back room corner. You could feel the air seeping in from the wall and our feet felt like ice cubes. Definitely need to have some more insulation blown in or turn up the heat!! Service was okay. I appreciated the hostess changing out my napkin from white to black (had on black pants) upon seating us. For about $100 with also 2 glasses of wine, tax and tip, it just didn't seem worth the money. It seems like the best value and better food at Columbus' finer restaurants is during their happy hours."], ["Maria S.", "This is probably my favorite place for a nice date. The low lighting, soft music, and, if you're in the front room, a view of beautiful German Village at night make it the perfect place for a romantic evening. It's hard to resist going here every time Dine Originals week rolls around because you get to try so much great food for a wonderful price.My husband and I hit up G. Michael's again a couple weeks ago during DOW. My car had actually died when we stepped out to make our reservations. Rather than cancelling, we hopped on our bikes and pedaled 1.5 miles in the chilly night air from our house to the restaurant. We probably didn't look like the classiest couple, with our helmets slung over the backs of our seats and my face red and glistening with sweat. I ordered beet salad, coffee-rubbed steak with bacon mac & cheese, and a pumpkin caramel tart that was heavy on cloves (a good thing, in my opinion!). I took one bite of that tart, put my fork down and glared at my husband. It was so good, but I knew that the more I ate it, the less there would be. Dilemmas. Needless to say, the bike ride home was significantly more difficult with a three-course meal stuffed inside of me. Totally worth it."], ["Joe B.", "If I lived in the area this would be my go-to for a very nice date night with a special girl. I'd lean towards 4.5 stars but there were a few minor notes that left me wanting.We began with cocktails....I had asked if they had a Sazerac which unfortunately they weren't familair with, but the Booker's Manhattan they made for me was wonderful and the maraschino cherries were homemade from what I could tell which I can apprecaite wholly.For satrters we tried the Brussel Sprouts appetizer which was layered with all sorts of flavors combining into one amazing profile. These were really a solid starter where the almonds and the pancetta added so much to this dish I would've loved to take an order home. Next we tried the Lobster Johnny Cakes which could be described best as a stack of corn cakes with lobster meat and a creamy stock sauce to accompany. These were also a solid appetizer, so much so that my colleague grabbed most of the dish for himself himself before the soup came. These were pretty tremendous and I'd recommend them highly! The soup was a special that day....a chorizo bean puree. It was pretty heavy on cumin and tasted similar to a smooth chili. It was decent but I wouldn't order it again. The entrees that piqued my interests were a choice between the pheasant, the rabbit, the duck, and the surf and turf. I opted for the two-in-one and ordered the Seared Scallops and Ohio Pulled Beef with White Cheddar Grits and Sauteed Spinach. It sounds tremendous right?!...it mostly was. The scallops were perfectly cooked although I would've liked a little darker sear on them, and the pulled beef was flavorful and unctuous as you'd expect. The sauteed spinach was bitter and delicious but where the dish fell short, to my dismay, were the cheese grits. They were still very good but I didn't get any real cheesiness from them nor the flavor of, and more importantly, the texture was wrong. They were tight like a polenta rather than smooth and light like a low country grit. It was one solid mass of polenta that was saved by the beef stock at the bottom of the dish, which was very very flavorful.....so much so that I spooned it up when I was finsihed with the main.The service here was almost flawless. The maitre d' could've been a little friendlier but our server Tim was legit! He took the time to explain everything very well and even added a small explanation regarding their new head chef who grew up in Iowa and learned to cook meat while living on a pig and cattle farm and then moved to Charleston to gain expereince in cooking seafood. He took very good care of us and was a true gentleman to deal with. I'd love love love to come back here sometime.

The crostini was very nice, with some sort of tangy sauce in the micro salad that I loved. \u00a0Like the shrimp and grits, the seafood aspect was delicious and meaty, and it went well with the pimento....of which I'm not normally a big fan.The tart was also good, though I tasted lemon far more heavily than gingersnap. \u00a0The texture was rather interesting... \u00a0 This sounds so ...inappropriate... but it reminded me of apricot baby food. \u00a0You know how super silky and smooth that is? Anyways, it was a bit unusual, with good flavor. \u00a0I especially liked the passion fruit sauce that came with it. \u00a0The best part of the meal (aside the shrimp and grits) though was definitely the main course. \u00a0Two large skewers of super tender, flavorful lamb that just melted in the mouth, with the meat spread by roasted tomatoes and onions. \u00a0Now, I'm not a huge fan of either of these vegetables, but they were very nicely done here, falling apart in a bite and full of both their natural flavors and the delicious sauce. All this was served on a sizable bed of well roasted potatoes and other vegetables with the crunch of almonds.Service was terse but polite. \u00a0Drinks were refilled before we had a chance to notice they were empty, even though we were all drinking water (we all drove separate). \u00a0No problems here.And prices... well, the $30 prix fixe really was a good deal since you get a nice appetizer and dessert. Otherwise, prices for an entree alone are $17~32. \u00a0For a nice meal out or special occasion, though, I would definitely say it's worth giving a go based on this experience."], ["Taylor S.", "What a satisfying meal! I have heard about G.Michael;s several times, but haven't gotten around to going there- we wanted to wait for a special occasion, as it is quite pricey. So for my birthday, my boyfriend and I decided to splurge and go! It was in March, so we sat inside as it's obviously not quite warm enough to sit outside, but the patio looked beautiful and I am eager to go back and sit out there! We went later on a Sunday evening, it wasn't crowded at all- actually, pretty romantic. I also loved the jazzy/Sinatra-type of music in the background. We were seated right away and our waiter, David, was very attentive and amazing throughout the whole experience!We weren't too starving, as we were still full from our birthday brunch at the Pearl, but we just had to try a few things out! Starting with the bread- so warm and delicious, the butter was great, too! We got the mussels and brussel sprouts to start. Both were delicious and I think the kitchen was being extra generous to us since we were probably their last customers of the evening, but I have never been given so many mussels! And they were great! The brussel sprouts also had a great combination of the crunchy, salty and sweet. For dinner, we order the Scallops and Short ribs and wow they were amazing! The kitchen was so sweet and split them for us (free of charge) and I do not kid when I say this, but it was basically 2 full meals for the price of 1! They even gave us extra scallops! The portion was huge and we loved every bite of it- I mean, the scallops literally melt in your mouth! We were so stuffed by the time dessert came around, but David insisted that since it was my birthday that we get the Oreo crusted chocolate tart- topped with a candle! I thought I couldn't take any more after dinner...but this cake was so amazing that we ate the whole thing! So much for not trying to be rolled out! Overall, we were very pleased with G.Michaels- the atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks- everything together made it a great birthday experience! I would certainly recommend it!"], ["Eric W.", "First, the background:I lived in Columbus ages ago, and have visited a few times each year ever since. But this summer I relocated here fulltime for work, and so am \"re-discovering\" much of the eating & drinking scene. In about ten weeks, I have already tried over two dozen spots. We had a reservation at G. Michael's Bistro, and arrived early after a somewhat disappointing cocktail hour at another local spot. The restaurant was full (always a good sign) and no seats at the bar, but after a few minutes a couple got up to leave, so we sat down for another round.The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. One of our party is a chef, and was interested to hear a bit of background on Chef Tetzloff. The cocktail menu has some interesting selections, that were relatively well-done with noteworthy touches such as freshly-muddled ginger, but overall not \"wow\" caliber.Our table was ready right on-time, and it is worth noting that the dining room is on the small side, so reservations are probably always going to be a good idea.The wine list was nice, although (as others have noted) the by-the-glass selections are limited. Fortunately our chef companion just loves Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, so she was very happy.We ordered three starters to share around our three diners, which was our first mistake. This is not a negative, but a warning: the portions at G Michael's are *very* generous! In particular, the shrimp & grits is entree-sized.That dish, with andouille sausage was tasty. The tomato-scallion broth was well-done. Shrimp & grits has become such a trend, but is most often flavorless and forgettable. I would give this version 3-out-of-5. It was well-executed and tasted fine, but if you want a truly amazing take on this standard, try the starter at Hubbard Grille (Short North). I know some would quibble that with the addition of braised short ribs it is barely \"shrimp & grits\" anymore ... but oh, my, is it tasty!We also had the roasted Granny Smith apple with Maytag-fig stuffing, and the 'Knife and Fork Crostini' with pulled braised beef shank. Both of these were good as well. The roasted apple being mostly noteworty for it's uniqueness. The crostini was tasty, but served a bit lukewarm. Overall, the starters were solid, but nothing that really blew us away.For dinner we chose three entrees (yes, more trouble ahead with the large portions!).I selected the Chicken Fried Rabbit Legs with Dijon mashers, spinach, thyme cream sauce, and Vidalia jam. I am a sucker for rabbit dishes, and this did NOT disappoint. Goes on my list of WOW dishes since returning to Columbus, which - I might add - only holds three items at the moment. The breading on the rabbit was crispy, the meat was flavorful and tender, amd the mash & accompanying cream sauce were delightfully paired. The Vidalia \"jam\" just seemed like \"pickled onions\" to me, but I won't nitpick the description because it all tasted so good! Did I mention the portion was *VERY* generous?Our chef ordered the Bacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin with sweet potato, smoked onion, maytag, and grilled summer squash hash, Bulleit Rye and jalapeno reduction, and sweet savory slaw. It, too, had a wonderful flavor, and the smoky flavor of the hash - while it might have been overpowering had it filled the entire plate - was a nice counterpoint to the rest of the dish. She felt the pork might have been a tad overcooked, but mostly was happy with her entree.Our thrid guest enjoyed the grilled Lake Erie Walleye with fried grit cake. We all enjoyed the Moroccan flavors of the ras al hanout compound butter. The fish was well-cooked, and had a nice flavor. Again ... a very generous portion.Needless to say, we were all way too stuffed to even think about dessert. None of us finished our entrees! This is hardly a knock, since it is rare to find such portions in a restaurant of this caliber. Next time, we will either skip starters or share entrees. But it is worth keeping in-mind, because the tab at G Michaels can become quite affordable when you factor-in the wonderfully generous size of the plates.All-in-all, a great experience, and the three of us agreed we would both return for ourselves as well as recommend G Michael's to others.Try the rabbit!"], ["Vin R.", "Great location and nice atmosphere make G Michael's a great \"date night\" restaurant. \u00a0We've been stuck in a rut of Lindey's and Mitchell's Ocean Club for our last few date nights. \u00a0While G Michael's is in the same genre, it still was a nice change of pace.I was initially perturbed at being seated near the kitchen area (I'm not a big fan of food preparation as theater) but my wife didn't seem to mind so I didn't make a big deal of it.The food was quite good, though my \"Giant Scallops\" weren't really all that giant. \u00a0Whatever, there were plenty of them and they tasted great. \u00a0I also recommend the meatball appetizer. \u00a0Meat and fried cheese? \u00a0Yes, please. \u00a0My wife had the fried chicken which was some of the best I've had north of the Mason-Dixon line. \u00a0As is usual, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, so we ordered dessert to go. \u00a0We're still full now, some two hours after dinner, so dessert will have to wait till tomorrow.One other note, I had forgotten how much a competent waiter contributes to a nice meal out. \u00a0Our waiter and service was excellent.We'll definitely be going back again."], ["Angie K.", "The food was great, the service was awful. Filet was the best I tried on the menu. The service honestly kind of ruined the whole experience, though. We ordered slow drinking drinks, ie whiskey on the rocks and martini and she came both times and took them away before we were finished (there was still drink left). Without asking and while we were talking and not noticing. Mind you they were our only drinks and we weren't drunk. This was one example. Also had to ask for things twice, things she said she would check on, ie can I get sweet potatoes instead of normal were ignored and not addressed. I thought maybe this thought was just mine, but it was also agreed on with four other people I asked at our table after the dinner. I am a bit disappointed and sad that such good food was ruined with service.

Michael's made the visit there worthwhile, though. \u00a0What I liked:Nice bar, a very comfortable and friendly wait for our late (our choice) reservations. \u00a0They have very decent wines, pricing like you would expect at this type of restaurant, and a nice selection of liquors.Exceptional food! \u00a0-My husband and I split the friend green tomatoes, a special for the evening. \u00a0There were only two of them but the sauce was exquisite and we did not feel shortchanged. - My husband had the mussels small plate, delicious broth/sauce and very very tender mussels (not an easy feat). - I had the cucumber, mint and English pea Vichysoisse which was amazing, beautifully chilled (great after a 100+ degree day) but still full of flavor.. \u00a0If you order this soup expect it to be very filling as it uses lots of rich cream.-We then split an entree of Sea Scallops. \u00a0A bit disappointed that their special sea scallop dish was sold out but they saved the day by using their standard scallop recipe but cooking the scallops without the jerk seasoning (probably delicious but I am a spice wimp.) \u00a0The result was excellent and we had no complaints.Nice service. \u00a0We had an attentive waiter who was there when we needed him but wasn't overwhelming. \u00a0We mentioned it was my birthday and he offered anything on the dessert menu, on the restaurant! \u00a0I think this was very generous. \u00a0We ordered the Maple Creme Brulee and were not disappointed. \u00a0So many restaurants don't spend time on the custard in this dessert but this chef gets it spot on! \u00a0This was a very rich meal but worth every calorie and every dime. \u00a0Well-done, G.

I expect tiptop service AND FOOD when I drop $100 on a meal for two. \u00a0This place would have to give me at least a $30 gift certificate if they want me to go back to give it a second try. \u00a0For now, I would not recommend going here. THE FOOD:I ordered two small plates and the house starter salad because I wasn't really that hungry and I wanted to sample as much from this esteemed place as possible. I was not able to sample my g/f's entr\u00e9e because of a scallop allergy, but she was not impressed either. \u00a0(1) The salad: I would give it a 2/5. It was average and not special. A fancy place needs to have a superb salad, not an average salad that they have had around forever. \u00a0 \u00a0Why do they serve the same house salad for restaurant week as they do normally? \u00a0Can't they change it up? \u00a0How difficult is it to make a new creative salad? \u00a0If you compare the RW menu v. the regular menu, they just try to make it look like a different salad by naming the SAME ingredients in a different order. \u00a0Literally every salad my girlfriend has made me has been better. \u00a0Just yesterday she made a recreation of a fig salad she had at Deweys. \u00a0Its was wayyy better. \u00a0The only positive about the salad was that nothing in it was wilty or spoiled. Truly.(2) Shrimp and Gritts small plate: \u00a0I would give it a 1/5. \u00a0First, it was served lukewarm at best. It \u00a0came with only three shrimp. Why not 5 shrimp, especially if people are sharing the dish or getting it an an appetizer? \u00a0They probably cost the restaurant like $0.25 each. \u00a0All of those said three shrimp were rubbery and plain tasting. \u00a0I've had better precooked shrimp from Wal-Mart, and no I am not joking. \u00a0The combination of those three things (funny right, three shrimp and three complaints) was enough for us to not even finish the tiny dish. \u00a0It was horrible. \u00a0(3) Duck Confit small plate: \u00a0I would give it a 4.75/5 which is excellent in my book. \u00a0It was properly severed at the correct temperature. \u00a0It had great texture, flavor, heat/spice, and was the perfect amount to serve. \u00a0I would recommend this dish if you are not scared of a tab bit of heat.Overall Food: \u00a07.75/15 or 51%. \u00a0Factoring spending $100 to eat here on a date and being disappointed, exclusive of the fact that it was a 1 year anniversary dinner, I give it 2/5 or 40%.Oh YEAH: \u00a0I forgot to add that although the inside of the restaurant is very nice looking, we were seated in the corner. \u00a0It was freezing outside, minus ten or so. \u00a0We were not seated even remotely close to a door. \u00a0We could feel a very cold breeze coming from underneath the booth, and also around the top of the booth. \u00a0In addition, the bathrooms smelled horrible. \u00a0I noticed it on the way to the table, and was reminded when I walked by it to leave."], ["Amy S.", "We had an amazing dinner before Music in the Round.

You could definitely tell this place had been here for quite some time, and there was quite the age gap between my buddy and I and the rest of the patrons. We were seated quickly, and the server was very nice and helpful and took our orders within the first 5 minutes of us being there. Thank God they give you free bread, because we waited for about 30-40 minutes before they brought out our food. We both ordered Poor Boys (Italian Subs), aka something that should take less than 10 minutes to make, pop in the oven, and serve. I'm not sure what was going on back there, but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why it took so long. Clearly the rest of the of the customers aren't here on a work break, if you know what I mean.Anyway, the sandwiches were decent, but nothing I couldn't find anywhere else. I had to remove the tomatoes, because they were cut too thick and didn't taste very ripe. I can't complain too much though, because the sandwich was under $8 and came with fries. The fries were actually delicious, surprisingly. The seasoning on them was great.I couldn't leave without grabbing one of their cannolis, since it's my mission to try every cannoli in Columbus. They're priced at about $5, which is incredibly steep, but I will say that this could be the best cannoli I've found in Columbus. The ricotta was delicious, and you could tell everything was incredibly fresh. If it wasn't for the price point, I'd have ordered a lot more.Overall, I don't know when I'd come back to give them another shot. The food doesn't come out quick enough for a lunch break, and I don't live close enough for it to be worth my while coming back out for dinner. The pricing is pretty good, and they make everything there, so if I wound up back here again, I don't think I'd mind, but it didn't really WOW me.Side note: I don't usually care, but I did notice that the manager went around to almost every single table asking everyone about their meal, but she never stopped by ours, and we were there FOREVER.

I'm a fan and 3-A-OK), I'd have to score it a 4, and here's why.We were driving around the Main/James area and with the lack of any traditional restaurants nearby, TAT was an easy choice. Why? Location.Whitehall is packed with places to eat: Bob Evans, Chipotle, the Subway at Wal-Mart, Happy's Pizza, Sister's Chicken, but there are no really great places to eat at all. Of course, who comes to Whitehall except those of us hard-working minimum wage earners? Not many.We arrived at 5pm on a sunny Tuesday and were greeted by one of the original owners. He was somewhat frail, but hospitable enough. He led us to our seats midway through the cafeteria-style restaurant.That, however, is a misnomer. The ambiance is 1970s, with clean, white wallpaper and brass-adorned crystal chandeliers. The tables are covered with white linens and 8-piece place settings (3 silver+salad fork, drink glass, teacup, saucer, teaspoon). A crisp white napkin completed the setting.The average dining group ranged in age from 50-80 and were quiet and meek. There was even a gathering of 8 old friends nearby and their expanded seating arrangement was dealt with quietly and quickly.Our server was gracious and pleasant enough. There was no extra infformation, but certainly it wasn't the slightest bit curt or unpleasant. Middling to above-average. I ordered the Paella Salsicha and my friend ordered Veal Parmigiana.Our salads arrived in approximately 5 minutes and it was another 20 minutes for our main courses. Please remember, I ordered a traditional Italian cornbread dish, so this isn't fast food. That being said, the taste: well, it was reminiscent of something out of either a Norman Rockwell painting or an episode of \"The Waltons\".If those are refernces you don't get, then maybe this place isn't quite for you. The taste isn't superb - it tastes like it was made by your best friend's Aunt Francesca. The service is homey and polite, so, too is the patronage.The totat cost for 2 drinks, 2 salads, and two entrees (no sdes) was $29.75 + tip. A little pricey, but still decent and very attainable.

Here's her review:yelp.com/biz/tat-ristora\u2026I won't repeat what she's said (she said it so well), but I'll add some of my own thoughts...My friends and I were so pumped to try TAT. We wanted a night full of nostalgia, laughter, and comforting Italian food. We were all really good sports and totally had the right mindset to enjoy a quirky night out. TAT definitely gets points for nostalgia; this place hasn't changed in a very long time. I actually think that's pretty damn cool. And the service was phenomenal. Our server--Mary--was wonderful. She was just the right blend of sassy, sweet, and helpful. She gets five stars.Now on to the bad part...I really didn't enjoy the food. We started with wedding soup (which was okay) and then we had salads, which were just iceberg lettuce and dressing. Then, I tried everyone's main dish--all four of them--and everything pretty much tasted the same... like salt. I want to find a positive for the food, but if I'm being honest, there really wasn't one for me. I hate giving two star reviews, but I can't bring myself to give it more.

(one passed) \u00a0One of the wedding soups had plenty of the little meatballs, one had none. \u00a0The minestrone was tasteless and not hot. \u00a0Still no wine or garlic bread. \u00a0Then the salad came out and still no wine or garlic bread. \u00a0I asked about the wine and the waitress complained that the bartender was also the pizza baker. \u00a0Finally at the end of our salads she brought the wine. \u00a0She said our entree's would be out soon. \u00a0I asked about the garlic bread and she just laughed and said its coming. \u00a0I guess \"first\" means something else to her.Finally our entree's came out. \u00a0One of us had chicken livers on spaghetti, one had pesto gnocchi, one had lasagna and one had chicken Marsala. \u00a0Still no garlic bread. \u00a0The garlic bread finally came a few minutes later with zero apology, and it was a soggy mess. \u00a0The lasagna was not hot and very salty, the chicken livers were dry, \u00a0the gnocchi was pasty and under cooked and the chicken Marsala came out with just the piece of chicken on the plate with some sauce. \u00a0No vegetable, no pasta, no garnish! \u00a0Horrible.I could go on and on, but deciding which was worse, the service or the food, is like choosing who is your favorite child. \u00a0Can't be done.I can't believe I'm saying this, because I love supporting local establishments and hate chains, but I promise you Olive Garden would be 10 times better.If the owners are reading this, PLEASE call Robert or Gordon and get this fixed, you are harming others at this point. \u00a0It was as disappointing a meal and experience as I have ever had, and I am flabbergasted to see that anyone is able to give them a higher rating than one star."], ["Susan R.", "Full disclosure: When I walked into TAT with Bryant M., Keith M., and Tara B., we were absolutely not expecting modern, exciting Italian cuisine. We wanted kitsch; we wanted to step back in time; we wanted comforting Italian-American classics. So, this isn't a case of expecting it to be something that it was never meant to be.(sigh)First, I must say that our server was fabulous. Exactly the right balance of efficient, friendly, funny, and attentive. Amazing service can cover a host of ills, so it's kind of amazing that the food was so bad that the service didn't bump it up to at least a three-star.The menu was immediately a bit underwhelming, along with being a tad pricey. I was looking for pasta carbonara, but it was nowhere to be found (!); the closest thing was pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese, which, idk, it sounds like something I'd make when I needed to go grocery shopping and not like something I'd pay $15 for. So I went with the Ziti Alla Sicilian, which is like .. ziti with meat sauce and eggplant parm on top. Friends got the \"special\" lasagna, the spaghetti with meatball, and the manicotti.Apparently the soup was pretty OK. I got the \"light\" order, so mine did not come with soup. The bread was lackluster so I only ate a little bit (watching those calories like a boss, yo).Salad was iceberg salad mix. The house Italian dressing was okay. I could have done without the salad and the bread, personally.I had one glass of $8 Pinot Grigio which was, again, just okay. At this point, while it wasn't like, **the best ever**, really amazing pasta could have completely boosted the experience.When the main courses came, we were all totally underwhelmed. Tara had two sad little manicotti rolls on her plate that we unanimously agreed were gross when we shared around; Bryant's \"special lasagna\" was . . . . . \u00a0a pile of wide egg spaghetti with cheese baked on top? And it was ridiculously salty, in addition to not being lasagna. My ziti was . . . . nothing to write home about. And also salty. And the eggplant parm was soggy. And mine looked like cafeteria food.For me, if I'm going to have kitschy retro Italian, it's all about the red sauce*. Theirs tasted like it came out of a foodservice-sized can.. which is fine for me if I'm dumping it out of a $1 jar from Kroger but not fine when I pony up $16 for a plate of pasta.*Unless I get something without red sauce, but c'mon, MOST menu items are gonna be slathered in marinara.So, yeah.

I mean, it's pasta, c'mon!

A small group of friends and I stopped in on a weekend night to enjoy some of my favorite food ever - Italian. Or, American italian of course (noodle, sauce, cheese - I'm good). Unfortunately it just missed the mark for me. The good: our service was wonderful, funny, and personable. The interior was exactly what I expected it to be - kitschy, old school, like your grandma's dining room. Plenty of parking, plenty of seating, no waits. The other diners seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves, and I noticed more than one waitress speaking to customers in a way that led me to believe they were packed full of regulars.The not so good: the food and the price. All four of us got a pasta dish; I got the manicotti (one beef, one cheese), and there was a spaghetti and meatballs, an eggplant ziti, and a special lasagna. The cheese manicotti was edible, the beef was not. The ziti with eggplant was edible but not special, and the special lasagna was about the same. The spaghetti and meatballs was the tastiest of the dishes, but the thing was that all four tasted essentially the same. It tasted like four dishes with the ingredients combined in a slightly different way with the same pasta sauce. Now, perhaps the problem here is that we all got somewhat similar dishes, but that still isn't much excuse for the fact that the ones we did try were all the same. The other sticker was that the cost was more expensive than Olive Garden and possibly more expensive than some of the other more white table Italian joints around Columbus. It was around $30 a plate for soup (the Italian wedding was legitimately good but tasted kinda old), salad, a glass of wine, and the dinner. Way more than I want to pay for the quality of the meal.That being said though, this place seems to have a really strong fanbase with a lot of dedicated diners, so maybe we just didn't try the right meals?"], ["Kate H.", "We go here every year for our anniversary- mostly because it is an amusing experience every time.

Cucina Italia is so bad because I have good memories of wood fired pizza and made to order pasta dishes served in a cozy authentic setting some years ago at the original location on Hayden Run Road in Dublin.Now, at least at this location on Olentangy, all that remains is over processed, fat and sodium rich calorie bombs, offered up in a dirty and cartoonish dining room that seats about 200 people.The best tasting item on the menu is one of the house specialities: \"Pasta Bravo\" which is rigatoni with grilled chicken and mushrooms served with a mildly spicy red pepper cream sauce.

My guess is that it will eventually hit four stars... just not quite there yet. The food is good quality and there are a variety of options. They have recently introduced a light menu, which I definitely appreciate though I somewhat doubt its veracity. I will have to say that , especially for lunch, this place is expensive. It is difficult to get out with less that a $20.00 bill, which is pushing it considering how many less expensive lunch option there are around.The staff is generally solid, courteous and attentive. There seems to be a high rate of turnover, a lot of spills and disproportion amount of dropping of plates (both full and empty) in this place. I don't know why, perhaps the openness and general overwhelming feeling of the space causes lapses in attention. I appreciate that the waitstaff is dress in mostly white, as I think it gives a general sense of cleanliness to most places- but you have to be careful for what you wish for- I have noticed a lot of dirty and unironed clothing. My guess is that most people won't notice, just the former waitress in me. The place is gorgeous, but is absolutely horrible for attempting to carry on a conversation, especially in the tables in the middle. They are too far apart and the restaurant too noisy to really do much more than stunted charades and bordering inappropriate shouting. The good is good enough that the bad has not dissuade me from returning. I think I would like the place more for dinner or a happy hour."], ["Luke T.", "I walked through the doors and was instantly taken aback with just how drastic is the makeover to the facade. The interior looks palatial. I really don't think there's a better word for it. \u00a0You walk in and the host area occupies the same space it did in previous inhabitants of this space. To the right, you'll still find a bar, center-right still houses a staircase to the upstairs, and the restrooms are still off to the left. The similarities pretty much end there.The walls are all textured stucco, the bar features a marble countertop, exposed beams run across the ceiling, columns mark many of the interior entrance-ways, and everything has a very grandiose feeling to it. It's a vast improvement over previous occupants. I honestly can't imagine that Bravo's Lennox location will go OOB anytime in the near or not-too-distant future.With the exception of it taking four minutes for one of four bartenders to acknowledge me at the bar, the service was impeccable. Once a bartender did come up to me, he shook my hand, introduced himself, and asked what I wanted to drink. I placed an order for the onion, portobello and gorgonzola flatbread and asked for a recommendation from the reds list. The bartender recommended Sketchbook, one of two pinots offered by the glass. \u00a0Before the flatbread arrived, I placed an order for a bowl of the lobster bisque. While I sipped the pinot, the man next to me chatted with me about the restaurants that used to be here and what the current tenants had changed. We weren't sure if the bar's wall had been extended or whether it just seemed bigger because of the now-vaulted ceilings. The flatbread came and was quite yummy. The crisp flatbread and the soft onions and gorgonzola paired nicely. Only downside was that it got cold before I could finish the whole thing. The lobster bisque was good, but probably a bit too cheesy and only had about four small pieces of shrimp in it. I ate every bite, but I don't know that I would order it again.Again, the service was great. The bartender was very attentive and stopped by just enough to keep me happy.

I asked whats for brunch, and thats when he noticed we didnt have a brunch menu...the hostess forgot. I ordered the Tuscan Grilled Chicken Sandwich which came with a good salad, but the sandwich was bland and very dry. She got the Pasta Pomodoro with Shrimp, which she complained was too spicy. While I didnt find it too spicy, it had a strange taste over-powered with cinnamon. They werent very busy, but we found ourselves with empty glasses too many times. Also, never did the waiter ask how our food tasted/was. We might give it another try, but its certainly not on our \"must go\" list."], ["Rick C.", "Fun restaurant, great place to stop for after work happy hour.

They have a really good cocktail called a cucumber something gimlet. Ask about it. It's delicious. And I always get the Shrimp fra diavalo campanelle. Although, the more I come here, the surer I am now that the consistency of the food is a bit off. It's supposed to be a spicy sauce, but sometimes it's spicy, and other times it's pretty bland. But for 13 dollars and free bread, it's pretty hard to beat. Great for dates and a group of friends alike. 5 stars (for a lunch spot). Bravo!"], ["Angela R.", "I will be very fair here.

While finishing his lemonade, my boyfriend noticed a lipstick stain on one side of his glass; once you knew what you were looking for, it was like BOOM right there. And he had already had a drink out of that side- gross. Then, I crunched down on broken mussel shells in my Frutti di Mare; just glad I didn't swallow them, that would've been a bit painful, huh?Icing on the cake, we didn't even get our breadsticks boxed up even though we asked for everything boxed. If I had realized this before getting home, \"Heather\"'s tip would've been lower, for sure.My advice to Bravo: Hire new dishwashers. Cook the Frutti de Mare more carefully or you'll have a lawsuit on your hands.

Well the first mistake is to come here BEFORE 5:30 because we were seated in the upstairs section a very good ways from the entrance and the kitchen and we were the only people in the area. Not a good start. Then, no bartender so we had to wait for the downstairs bartender to grace us with our drinks a good 10 minurtes after ordering. To top it all off, the Managment has a pre-dinner meeting so we had in excess of 20 servers saunter past our table as we ate and walked to a meeting just a few feet where we were having dinner. It was a loud meeting and we were treated to all the specials and management admonitions along with dry chicken. \u00a0Ahh the food, it was OK for an Applebee's or a Tee Jaye's, but for the prices that this establishment ccharges, the food doesn't fit the bill. What a shame. I really wanted to like this place. I mentioned this to the General Manager on the way out and he seemed only mildly interested and never apologized for the lack of consideration for the poor seating choices we were given. Again, what a shame, I've had better service and food at Tee Jaye's for only a fraction of the cost. We will not come back and take a dim view of this chain's establishments after the feeling that their manager's really aren't paying that much attention to their stores and really don't care.

We ordered one of each of the bar bites and left stuffed paying just over $30. The bruschetta was delicious, fresh and with a ton of toppings. Along with a salad a prefect little meal on its own. My husband loved the crispy shrimp, great sauce and who can beat a large order of shrimp for $2.95?!! The meatball sliders were our least favorite but came along with very good fries. All of the flatbread were also very good, fresh hot, descent size and all came out very fast. You can watch them being made and can modify your order to the way you like it.

But everything else was pretty lame.Our server was clearly new to the job and awkward. I think ours was the first bottle of wine she had ever opened. It took approximately 5 painful minutes.From the salad on the food was more sizzle than steak. Whoever wrote the menu is clearly more talented than the cook in the kitchen who actually made the food. It was under-seasoned and generally bland.All in all we concluded that for about $10 more we could have had a wonderful experience at Basi Italia in Victorian Village or for the same money could have had much better food and service at Lola's in Gahanna.

Also, when we did get our bill, it wasn't our server that had given it to us. It was just really weird to switch servers up like that.

Anyway, we got there right around 11:30 (which I highly recommend, as this place is tiny and fills up) and were seated by our awesome server. I didn't catch her name, but she was very helpful and super friendly! Their lunch is any 9inch pizza for $7, and the option of adding on one of their 3 salads for $2. WOW! I had the goat cheese pizza and the kale caesar. The spicy yuma was purchased by the majority of our group, and everyone was raving about it. I had tried that one before, so went for the goat pizza, and was super pumped about it. Everyone enjoyed their pizza, and the kale caesar had toasted hazelnuts on it! I never would have thought to have that kind of nut on a caesar salad, but it worked really well. For $9 I had so much delicious, local food that I couldn't even finish it. I will say that their pizza doesn't hold up as well as leftovers, as it gets a little soggy. Also, as previously stated, it's quite small (I prefer to call it 'cozy').

After eating at Harvest, \"good pizza\" has become another new word association.Harvest is a cute pizzeria located in German Village. I can't speak too much about the restaurant's interior, since I ate the pizza at Curio, but the pizza was quite tasty. It's never a bad idea flipping through Yelp before ordering. I did just that and got the Spicy Yuma. Best idea ever. If you can tolerate moderate spiciness, this pizza is for you. It consists of gouda, mozzarella, chorizo, jalapeno, corn, roasted red peppers and a \"chipotle-spiked\" tomato sauce. Don't let the corn throw you off. It's adds a nice touch of sweetness. The pizzas run between $11-15 dollars, but the portions are generous. I'm a big eater and one pizza was more than enough. I think most people would have to take a slice or two home afterwards. It's surprisingly filling for Neapolitan-style pizza with a thin airy crust. \u00a0Anyways, Harvest's positive Yelp reviews are well-deserved.

Each of us got something different. My mother got the mustard trout, her partner the poached cod, and I got the short ribs (an unusual choice for me but - when I asked what on the menu might be a bit lighter...I was going dancing later - I was surprised that this was the server's recommendation). The server was right that the short ribs were surprisingly light and melted in the mouth. They were very well-executed, but I don't think they were the standout dish at the table. The flavors didn't particularly excite me and - since I wasn't really looking for sweet - the corn puree didn't do it for me. It wasn't a bad dish, just not my cup of tea. I didn't get a chance to try the cod (although I heard good reviews), but the mustard trout was delicious (I will definitely be going for that or one of the pasta dishes when I return). It was flaky and perfectly seasoned and had a beautiful, colorful array of vegetables on the side (I just found this dish to be a lot more interesting than the short ribs). It was definitely 5-star worthy.We ended the meal by ordering dessert, and I am so so so so so glad we did. I say this without any exaggeration that the tiramisu was easily the best tiramisu I've ever had and quite possibly the best dessert I've ever had anywhere, of any kind. I didn't even know that I liked tiramisu that much - I've had tiramisu at many other restaurants and it's been good but not out-of-this-world - but I am now a convert and Basi's tiramisu is my messiah. Warning: this tiramisu can easily be split between a party of 3 or 4 (it's gigantic...I think it would be a lot for even two people to share so it wouldn't be something I'd necessarily order on my own). But dear god, if I could, I would. It was the perfect balance of the liquor, the coffee flavor, the perfect creamy cake (without the sponginess I really don't like in most tiramisus). It was almost the perfect balance of tiramisu and creme brulee (my usual favorite dessert). We asked the waiter if it was regularly in the dessert rotation and he said it isn't but it definitely DEFINITELY should be. Birthday cake for this year already set if they have it (crossing fingers)."], ["Robert P.", "The is the perfect place for a romantic night.

The food was just amazing with reasonable price."], ["Chris W.", "Great food! Loved the atmosphere and good was delicious"], ["Melinda S.", "Oh, dear. \u00a0We really wanted to like this restaurant, which had been recommended by colleagues and local publications. \u00a0The positives? \u00a0Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and helpful and the attitude is not at all pretentious. \u00a0After walking around the Victorian Village neighborhood to look around a bit we arrived early for our reservation and received a very friendly reception and were told that we could either have a drink at the bar or be seated immediately. \u00a0Since it still wasn't even 6:00 p.m. we opted for a drink at the bar, which turned out to be a space behind the restaurant enclosed in plastic to protect patrons from the winter chill. \u00a0That was fine, except for the fact that there was a distinct rotten cabbage smell permeating the entire space. Our bartender was helpful and personable, answering questions about drinks as well as food. \u00a0We enjoyed a couple of the special cocktails and then were seated for dinner. \u00a0To cut to the chase, the food was mediocre at best. \u00a0We started by sharing the \"zucchini pronto,\" which was julienned, al dente zucchini mixed with almonds and topped with slices of cheese. It was fairly tasty but a bit watery -- not one of those \"yummy\" appetizers you look forward to ordering again. The serving was enough for four people, so we ate half and asked for the rest to be boxed up. \u00a0My husband then had the mussels (OK) and the lobster risotto, which was a huge pile of food that tasted just like pimiento cheese. \u00a0The cheese was so overwhelming that the chunks of lobster could have been chicken or pork or tofu. \u00a0He could only eat a modest portion of it -- again, we asked for a box. \u00a0I ordered the mushroom gnocchi. \u00a0To be honest, I was already full from the bread and zucchini appetizer so I only had one bite before asking for yet another box -- but the bite I had was gluey. \u00a0Finally, as part of the Restaurant Week prix fixe which I had ordered, we got a dessert, and we selected the butterscotch budino. \u00a0This actually was a delicious, butterscotchy pudding accented with a few small, equally delicious, crisp cookies \u00a0The dessert was the best part of the meal.To sum up, including liquor we spent almost $200 for dinner for two. \u00a0In the car on the way home we thought about how we could have had about four tasty meals for the same price at one of the local taverns. \u00a0We moved to Columbus a few months ago and have tried a number of highly recommended restaurants, but so far the results are disappointing. \u00a0We like Rigsby's (but just for the bar drinks and bar food only, not for the restaurant) and we love Lindey's in German Village. \u00a0We have not been impressed by Marcella's, Mezzo, J. Liu, Tucci's, Hoffbrau Haus, Schmidt's, or The Top. \u00a0The best finds have been ethnic places and unpretentious, local restaurants: Amul India in Dublin, Benny's Pizza in Marysville, Old Bag of Nails (several locations but we like the spot in Hilliard). \u00a0I agree with a local critic who said that Columbus's fine dining scene should be great...but it just isn't in most cases."], ["Ben R.", "Basi Italia has been on my list for restaurants to go to for awhile. Based on reviews, friends, and awards my expectations were considerably high. I took my wife here on a Saturday evening and our overall impression was one of underwhelming and disappointment. The tone was set for the evening when we were rudely greeted by an employee. I can appreciate a small, intimate atmosphere, but the inside of Basi felt cramped. My chair was bumped into numerous times by patrons and employees as they navigated the tight walkways. We ordered 2/3 recommended entree's from our server, the short ribs and the cod, and sat patiently in excited anticipationThe short ribs were very tasty, however the corn mash they sat ontop of what literally mildly mashed corn. For all I know the corn could have been from a can and was punished slightly with a fork, not was a $20+ entree should be. The cod was nothing special, typical white fish that sat on a couple of small potatoes. The meal was better than it maybe should have been because the entire dish was sitting in a pool of butter. I would argue that almost any meal can taste relatively pleasing soaked in butter...miss again. Another $20+ entree that left me still hungry and dissatisfied.The two bright spots were the super cute patio (unfortunately it was too cold for us to enjoy, even though we were recommended to eat there) and our server was very polite and knowledgeable of the menu.We do not often indulge in a higher priced dinner but when we do our expectations are very high and we expect to receive what we paid for. Unfortunately Basi fell short on the quantity and the quality of the meal and we will not be returning."], ["Antoni G.", "I have been there once before but this time it was nice enough out to sit on the patio. I had multiple people in for work and since I knew the area better then anyone else, I went out on a limb and suggested here.I could not have been happier. The ambiance on the patio is amazing! They had wonderful drink specials and one of each was ordered by different people at the table. I had the Perfect Manhattan and it was wonderful.For the apps we had the pistachio flat-bread and the cheese creme brulle. The flat-bread was by far the better of the two and was devoured by the table. Around the table everyone ordered a good variety of main dishes. The Shortribs were raved about. I had the smoked chicken gnocchi and the aroma alone cause the table next to me to ask what it was so they could order it. The food was as amazing as I remembered and no one in our entire group was disappointed.The staff was very friendly and informative. They were happy to explain the dishes to those had not been here before. They gave informed recommendations and suggestions for meals as well.I would tell anyone to go here if they are in Columbus."], ["Jordan W.", "Very impressive restaurant, definitely one of my favorites in Columbus. The place is so small and dimly lit inside that it creates a very romantic atmosphere, while the outside patio is perfect for enjoying a meal in the warm summer air.

Everything perfectly prepared along with a great patio setting. One of the best in C bus"], ["Sean D.", "I wish that I could be writing a positive review about the food, but the service I experienced during my meal tonight marred all expectations I had for Basi Italia.After we were seated on the patio following a short wait at the bar, our disheveled server appeared at our table with a rushed greeting. Acknowledging that we had transitioned from the bar above which the chalkboard with the night's specials hangs, he nonchalantly asked if we had any questions about the specials. He made absolutely no effort to describe the options, and proceeded to ask if we were ready to place our order. We responded with drink and appetizer orders, and although pressed to place an immediate entree order, we managed to hold off our dinner order for a few minutes. \u00a0By the time our appetizer arrived we had to remind the manager that our wine had not been brought. \u00a0Several minutes later our wine arrived at our poorly bussed table, with cork floating in one of the wine glasses. I ordered the salmon entree special, but it was already sold out before 8:00pm. No apology was given, and I was pressed at that moment to pick an additional selection for an entree. By the time our meal was brought out, our server made his first appearance since our initial greeting. At that time he did ask how \"everything was,\" but truly put out the absolute bare minimum level of effort required. It is seldom that the level of service I receive can alter my dining experience, but it is also seldom that I experience such a dismal level of service. I receive better service at diners and fast-casual establishments, and this is certainly not what I expect from a restaurant like this. The food was prepared very well and was really quite good. We maintained a polite demeanor through the entire experience, but left feeling disappointed and disenchanted. It is unlikely that I will be revisiting any time soon. What a shame."], ["Kathryn W.", "We came here one night during the week because we were very interested in making a visit to try it out. We got tired of talking about it, so we finally made it to Basi Italia. We sat at the bar outside, due to the inside being full and we didn't make reservations since it was a spur of the moment idea! We loved the outdoor area, very intimate and relaxing. We enjoyed sitting at the bar, because we got to speak with their Bartender, \u00a0Joe Peppercorn. He is very knowledgeable in the Spirits/Cocktail area, so we had a great time speaking with him. After a few conversations and he got to know the style of drinks we enjoy, he made us drinks that he recommended for us; which felt very personal to us!The food was also very good, I had Eggplant Parmesan which was a large helping; so large I had to take it home. I unfortunately can't remember what my Fiance had, I just know he got something with a lot of meat and a red sauce, which I tried and really liked!All around the experience was great, staff was friendly and enjoyable to be around.

Great service, highly recommend valet parking!"], ["J O.", "My wife and I, another couple were in Columbus for one night and wanted to have a really nice dinner. We asked around and were told that Basi was a place to get a great, memorable meal. We could not have been more disappointed in the experience; although I suppose we will certainly remember it.For starters, we were seated in a corner booth, far away from the front door. This would seem like a good thing due to the butter cold breeze that would flood into the restaurant anytime the door opened. Unfortunately, the heater for the restaurant was under our booth and it felt like a blast furnace pumping out heat directly onto our legs. We were all sweating before our water arrived. In spite of the below-the-waist sauna experience, we were still hopeful that our meals would more than make up for it. They did not. We ordered 4 entrees: Rigatoni: flavorless and not dissimilar to something I have had at an airport Sbarro.Carrot Risotto: undercooked risotto (crunchy rice anyone?), way too much cheese created an orange bowl of mush. The mushrooms looked like sliced toadstools and were nearly as tough.Mustard crusted trout: it was touted as \"lightly breaded.\" It was lightly breaded compared with an actual loaf of bread, but definitely not by normal fine dining standards. The flavor was just ok. \"Very mustardy\" was the description for the unfortunate diner.Poached sea scallops: Our waitress said they would \"melt in your mouth.\" The only only chance these tough and fishy tasting (these were the first fishy scallops I have ever tasted, maybe they ordered that flavor special for us) had if melting was because they were placed mere inches above the ever-present blast furnace. They were more similar to fishy gummy candy. Sound appetizing? We also ordered two glasses of wine, the Dante Cab Sauv and the Charles and Charles \u00a0Red Blend. The Cab was ok, although I have had better $4 bottles from Trader Joe's. The Red Blend was horrendous and tasted as if it was well in its way to becoming a mid grade vinegar. One of my companions did have the recommended gin cocktail with basil and jalape\u00f1o and said it was tasty. The tap water in the bottle was also cold and clear. So we can call the beverage rating 2.5 stars. As I said before, we really wanted to like this place, but so much was wrong, there was no chance. Judging by all the great reviews, perhaps we were just here on a very off night, but I find it hard to believe that the kitchen could screw up every dish so thoroughly. It seems much more likely that this is the norm."], ["Nicolas H.", "A little hidden restaurant with outdoor seating, who knew?! The service was friendly and the food very good. We started with the asparagus with mortadella, a dish I never would've thought would work, but does. The zucchini was good too but the asparagus was the better of the appetizers. I also had the melon and cucumber soup which was nice and refreshing. For my main I had the Porchetta with beans and sun dried tomatoes. The porchetta was good, but my brother's steak might have been even better..."], ["PinkJmmmm M.", "I know it's unfair to write reviews based on only once dinning experience.That's why instead of two stars in my mind, i gave it three stars.I went there in a very very hot day. So we got seat in the patio.I got eggplant Parmesan, very freshly made and tasty.My friend got the ground lamb with pasta. The pasta was overcooked. And other than that i think the pasta was not made in the house. And the tomato sauce was little bit watery and not well seasoned.

The cocktails are fantastic, the service quick and attentive, and the food is generally good.But it's not so great in some respects, which makes Basi more of an A-OK experience, especially since dining there can get very expensive. The indoor seating is small and a bit cramped. There is a table by the door, and it can be an awkward table to sit at with folks coming in and standing nearby waiting to be seated. If you're going to go to Basi, try dining on the patio where the ambiance is much better, but be prepared to wait at the bar because patio seats are popular. The food is generally delicious, but I was disappointed by the lamb sirloin.

The food was soooo good and priced very good! Total was only $55 for appetizer and two starters! We got the mushroom flat bread which was amazing! The mushrooms were huge specialty mushrooms not the small ones that go on pizzas! Before that they also brought out 2 dinner biscotti which were just the perfect amount of crispness!

We sat in the outdoor patio area that was a bit enclosed because the weather was still a bit cold. I didn't understand why they kept squeezing people on the high tables next to us. Even though we elected to eat on the patio, I didn't think it was very nice that everyone was crammed so close together on communal tables. Anyway the food was decent but nothing I would go back for. I found our chicken to be a bit bland and the coolest part to be the fiddle heads.

Each table is given these delicious buttery, garlic biscottis - I meant to only eat one but I had two.. or maybe three. We each ordered something different and enjoyed trying each other's dinners and wines.

I'll never make that mistake again: Basi Italia's backyard, complete with an outdoor bar and other pleasantries, provides a quaint setting for one of the better meals I've had in Columbus. The quality of the care put into my drink confirmed that I was very fortunate to be dining at Basi Italia that night. A \"campfire breakfast\" brought the bartender over to light a piece of a particular cinnamon bark, and then let it smoke into a glass. He then poured the concoction, the smoky-ness the final touch to what was the most scrumptious, memory-inducing drink I've yet tried. it reminded me instantly of sitting around making smores as a child, listening to bad ghost stories and imagining what every crackle in the fire sounded like as it echoed in the woods. Yeah. Damn good drink. The food wasn't as comparatively good, but that doesn't mean it wasn't also freakin' delicious. I had the equivalent of meatballs, only made out of duck; served in a pasta whose name now evades me. I was too mesmerized by the drink. Our service was excellent, to boot, and though we had no time for dessert, I'll be back soon to check it out. You should, too."], ["Christie B.", "When an out-of-town relative was visiting and said that a friend had recommended a place called Basil Italia that was in an alley somewhere, I got pretty excited. I had been looking for a reason to go to Basi Italia for pretty much the last three years. Despite its rave reviews and the fact that I live just a few blocks away, I had never eaten there.So, we walked on down Basi Italia on a lovely Wednesday evening and enjoyed the crisp fall weather on the patio. Let me first say that Basi Italia is pricey. I am a student on a budget, and $20 for an entree is livin' large, to me, but I honestly felt that the food was worth the price. Not somewhere I'd come often, but a great place for a special occasion.We shared two salads- the beet salad, which was beets and goat cheese over arugula, and a kale salad. I was expecting kale that had been perhaps julienned or cut into small lettuce-like pieces, but instead the kale was finely pureed with what tasted like parmesan, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil. It was almost like a pesto-- perhaps just a tad chunkier and not quite as oily. Both salads were delicious, but the kale blew me away with its unique flavor. I had the rigatoni salumeria ($17) for my entree, which is rigatoni with a red sauce of sweet sausage, tomatoes, raisins, fennel, and pine nuts, topped with fresh parmesan. It, too, was amazingly flavorful and the portion was generous as well. We were too full for dessert, but I've heard they make some good ones- maybe next time!"], ["Daniel K.", "Always great food! Patio is an absolute delight. The restaurant itself reminds me of a SoHo bistro. I love the intimate space and the friendly atmosphere. Johnny and Trish are fantastic people. All the team members at Basi Italia are gems. Enjoy!"], ["Y C.", "Please note that I've only been here twice. So take what I have to say with a grain of salt.After 3 years in Columbus and hearing so many of my friends and colleagues rave about how good basi italia is, I was disappointed by my experience there. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high because my friends referred to it as \"a hidden gem\", \" a go-to date place\", or \"the best Italian food I've ever had\". To start, I found the dining area to be cramped. And because it is so small, the volume in there is more bar (minus the blaring music) rather than intimate restaurant. Sure the servers are professional and attentive (albeit underdressed) but the fact that my fellow diners were sitting a few mere inches from me totally destroyed any notion of being an intimate date spot. \u00a0I would much rather listen to my wife than be forced to listen to some drunk stranger try and impress their supposed 2nd husband?? \" Intimate\" would not describe this establishment.Now the food itself and the primary reason I finally capitulated and decided to try this place gave me mixed feelings. We started with the flat bread which was a splendid mix of savory and sweet. Who would've thought that honey and nuts would work great on cheesy, crispy crust? The entrees really threw me off. Now I don't claim to be Italian nor an expert when it comes to Italian food. Hell, I have never been to Italy or Europe for that matter, but Italian is one of my favorite cuisines and I have certainly sampled some very good restaurants (eg daily catch and Giacomo in boston), so I am familiar (at least I think I am) with how good pasta could potentially be.My wife ordered a plate of the short ribs, which was tender and juicy but covered by the most generic Americans tasting barbeque sauce you could find. I'll give them this, though, the BBQ sauce wasn't quite the dollar general cheap-tasting.... Perhaps a little more sophisticated, maybe Trader Joe's quality? I myself ordered a pasta special, a pepper cream sauce with shrimp. Uggh I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was in it. Just overly creamy/buttery sauce that was somehow also bland. I actually can't even describe it anymore because the taste was so forgettable. It wasn't disgusting by any means, just so unspecial that I feel full just thinking about it- I would rather skip a meal \u00a0and go hungry for a night than to have to pay to eat it.. If that makes any sense. The final course we had was dessert. Chocolate mousse. It was rich and chocolatey, something that I would recommend.Anyway, all in all a disappointing experience. Food was over-hyped. None of the foods I tried that night wowed me. I hope it was just an off night and we just happened to order the wrong items off the menu. We did come back for restaurant week and it was once again disappointing."], ["Jordan S.", "Came here for an anniversary dinner. It is actually a nice little place, with a great feel. We dined outside on the patio, which was great and romantic. The service was pretty good, with no complaints there. Overall, the food was okay. My girlfriend had a shrimp and pasta meal, which was very good, although my eggplant Parmesan left a lot to be desired. It was a bit mushy and very bland, and not very good. I am willing to give this place a second chance, and will just try a different entree next time.

Lucky enough for me, Basi lived up to all the good things I had heard! We ate on the back patio, which is a beautiful little niche that makes you feel separated from everything else in Columbus (despite the bugs). I love the big bottles of water on the table, as well as the big chalk board by the bar to remind you of the specials. The 'breadsticks' are these small, dense sticks of delicious cheese bread that crumble and melt in your mouth. Om nom. We started out with the red flatbread which, while delicious, was a flatbread I could get at a lot of other restaurants. I wish I had gone with one of the more original primo's, but this one seemed to be the best to split between two people. Next time, I will be more adventurous -- I promise!I had the rigatoni salumeria, which is \"sweet sausage, tomato, raisins, fennel & pine nuts\" -- the combination of the sweet sausage, fennel, and raisins was incredible, and I found myself guarding my almost-empty plate just so I could try to eat more of the sauce, long after the rigatoni noodles are gone. I could eat this almost every day, I swear I could. I think what I love about Basi is the great combination of fresh ingredients, things I wouldn't normally consider putting together, that ends up being this delicious bowl of awesome. Special occasion coming up? Just want to treat yourself? Go to Basi Italia. You will not be disappointed."], ["Bryant M.", "Delicious, beautiful, and....expensive.We wanted to take some out-of-town co-workers to dinner somewhere special, so I, of course, jumped on this opportunity to try a place that had been on my list forever!I tried to use Open Table to make a reservation, but my party of seven was too big. \u00a0So, I gave Basi a call, and they gladly accommodated us. \u00a0A+ so far!A few of us got there early, so we decided to get some drinks. \u00a0I was not wowed by my riesling, but their malbec was excellent. \u00a0All the wines were about $7 per glass. \u00a0We didn't get any starters because - quite frankly - they were super pricey.When the rest of our party arrived, we ordered our main courses. \u00a0And choosing a main dish was such a tough choice - everything sounded delicious! \u00a0Here's a run-down of what we ordered: \u00a0pork loin chop, lobster ravioli with shrimp, rigatoni, beef something, and trout. \u00a0And the verdict? \u00a0Six said \"delicious!\", and one said \"okay\". \u00a0The one \"okay\" happened to be a Louisiana girl who ordered the trout, so I really wasn't all that surprised that she didn't like seafood in the Midwest. \u00a0My only critique of the food was that I paid $27 for a chop - and nothing came with it. \u00a0We ordered several desserts, but I only tried the raspberry trifle and the cheesecake; both were excellent! \u00a0The food itself was fantastic, but the dining experience is what will bring me back. \u00a0Our server, Jack, was delightful and earns five stars all on his own. \u00a0The ambiance was also lovely: \u00a0dark, intimate, and cozy. \u00a0Basi is a really tiny space, but they make great use of every inch. \u00a0I really felt special at Basi, and that's exactly when I will return - for special occasions.(Oh, and in case you're wondering, my bill was $45 + tip for a glass of wine, a pork chop, and a dessert.)"], ["Christian N.", "A true gem hidden between Hubbard and Buttles on Highland Ave. in Italian Village.

My friend could not eat the bread that came with the appetizers that we got and they brought her fresh vegetables for no additional cost.

I met a friend there about a month ago, it was my first visit, so I took my Garmin along. \u00a0I had trouble finding the place. The \u00a0GPS told me to turn down a back alley that looked \u00a0more like trash truck access than it did a proper street. So I marked my Garmin as defected and refused to take to its instructions. \u00a0After driving around the village a bit, and arguing with \u00a0Garmin that it \"could recalculate all it wants but it's just plain wrong\", it dawned on me that the Victorian village was an older section of town and therefore may have narrower streets. So I turned onto the 'trash alley' to find that Garmin was right after all! The fact that it is hidden down a secluded street made the place all the more charming.As for the actual dinning experience, \u00a0which I can bet is what you actually care about, it is great. The building is unique, though small. The patio is absolutely stunning. The food is wonderful. I love their selection of wine. The atmosphere is relaxing and ideal for escaping the run-around of life. The only complaint is minor, the staff was too on top of you to order. The proper procedure, I would think, is to give your guess some time to acquaint themselves before asking them to order. Other than that I give it 4-stars. I'm a hard grader."], ["Christopher Z.", "Quality of food was excellent. Great experience."], ["Monty B.", "I feel the way several reviewers felt. It was overpriced mediocre food. If the price point weren't so high, I might add a star or two, but it's the food quality relative to the price that made this a 2 star place for me. The flatbread, pork belly and short ribs were good. The smoked chicken bologonese was lacking in both smoke and chicken. We picked through the dish looking for the chicken and it was scarce. I think it would've been better with larger pieces of chicken that had a stronger smoke flavor. The tiramasu was average, but at $13 a pop, that's just crazy. Overall, the food was good though; however, not $50 per person good. The place is small and the tables are close together, but it's bearable. I've been in places where the quarters are even tighter. It was pretty cold inside though as the A/C was on full blast. Save yourself $5 for valet parking by parking along the street a block or 2 away."], ["Meghann T.", "How dainty and cute is this place? I loved the service, I loved the atmosphere, and the food was unbelievable.

It is a lot of fun, but be prepared for this.The food is great, the staff is cheerful. It is a solid must-try at least once if you are in the area.

Basi Italia is this cute, hole in the wall spot and it really is tiny. But the wine list is awesome and the food is excellent. When my boyfriend and I picked it to celebrate Christmas about a month ago, we had one of the best dinners ever. To start, they brought out little bleu cheese biscotti cookies that was a really surprising treat and a little more fancy than just your typical bread and butter basket. For starters, I had the soup of the day, which was a pumpkin and maple bisque and I'm not even going to pretend like I didn't want to lick my bowl clean. It was awesome. My boyfriend had the bianco flatbread, which had such an interesting flavor with just a hint of spice. For dinner, he had the braised pork cheeks and the mac and cheese and it was so rich and delicious and just cooked perfectly. I had another special, which happened to be Osso Buco, which is something I had never had but would have again and again. We had a great dinner and it was really romantic. My only gripe, and it's not really something the restaurant could control, but the place is so small and the tables are so close together that at times, I did get a bit distracted by this loud, obnoxious girl sitting next to us. Again, nothing the restaurant can do about a loud patron, but they could maybe omit a table or two so it wouldn't be so cramped. Other than that, this place was perfect and we even got a gift card for my boyfriend's parents to try it out. I would recommend this place for Valentine's Day or an anniversary or anything other romantic special occasion for sure."], ["Sabrina L.", "While parking is available on the nearby streets, valet parking is probably your best bet if you want to avoid frustration, unless you're poor like me and would rather save your money for dessert!I've been here several times and you can't go wrong with any of the appetizers as far as I'm concerned. \u00a0If you try the Zucchini Pronto you might spend the first few bites asking what the frick your eating, but that will pass into nothing but appreciation for the buttery yum that is on your place.For your main course, I don't think it's possible to find a better Eggplant Parmesan outside of Italy. \u00a0The chef probably sold his soul to the devil for the ability to take eggplant and turn it into this crisp, slightly salty, and absolutely perfect dinner. \u00a0My dining partners and I have tried a few other things from the menu, but trust me, this is what you want.Then for dessert, if they're still offering the pineapple, get the pineapple. \u00a0If they aren't, I doubt any of it could be bad. \u00a0The tiramasu (which I don't normally like at restaurants) was above average if you want to lean that way.A note, they don't serve bread with your meal. \u00a0For some people that's a hang-up, for me that's more room for eggplant. \u00a0Also, when you walk in the first time it can be daunting since the room is so small and you don't quite know what to do, but give a server a wave and they'll get you pointed in the right direction. \u00a0The dining room takes reservations, the patio is walk-in only, and honestly, I prefer the outdoor experience!"]], "Manifesto Tuscan Grato & Scotch Bar": [["Matt H.", "Excellent food in a cozy and warm restaurant. \u00a0The scotch list is pretty good for Columbus and the waitress was very friendly and very helpful. \u00a0Great experience!"], ["Crystal O.", "Ok, let me first just say it sounds like this new restaurant didn't fare well through restaurant week. I won't make excuses for them, but I encourage you to give this place a shot. I had a totally different experience the Sunday after restaurant week -- not enough time for them to have radically changed the experience or the kitchen or the service staff, making me believe it was just the craziness of being a 7-week-old restaurant that garnered so many poor reviews recently.This is a fantastic date night place that will have guys and girls raving. I mean, who doesn't love a quote from Ron Burgundy interspersed amongst the words of great thinkers and Presidents, scrawled on the wall up to 20 feet high? The ambiance here is just killer... we wandered around for 20 min just reading the walls and snapping pics of our favorites. I'm a sucker for cool lighting and this place has it in spades. A huge triple-decker chandelier looks like it was just found hanging there and had been there for the past 90 years. Upstairs there are cool red painted smaller chandeliers and the bar boasts iron cutout hurricane lights. The view of the Capitol out the window from the front of the restroom is really lovely at night, one of the only spots in Columbus that can boast such a great streetview.On the meal:The hubby would drink scotch all the time if I let him, and he adored this place. I had two great wines, one on the recommendation of the server. Hubby got the beef cheek with risotto (sorry I'm not going to remember the actual names very well) and the meat was succulent and fell apart it was so tender. Risotto was creamy with lots of yummy mushrooms. My eggplant rollatini with prosciutto was heavenly -- the outside had just enough breading to be crunchy but not overwhelm and the marinara had an awesome spicy kick. Totally unique. All the dishes served are small plates, not tapas style but just not Olive Garden's greasy-pasta-in-a-dish-the-size-of-your-head. (For the record, I still eat there. I just hate myself later.) Cost-to-value here was pretty great I thought. Many small plates were in the $5-10 range.On dessert: The cheesecake had a hint of lime, as did the creme brulee filling in my chocolate cannelloni. That was probably my only \"just ok\" part of the meal -- cannelloni seemed like it was just out of the freezer and the crusty outside (which I expected) was hard enough it required considerable force to fork it into bite sized pieces.One other small complaint I have with concepty places, which is totally snobbish of me but still worth mentioning... I hate when the bathroom doesn't continue the experience of the restaurant. I thought it might, the entry area is still cool with a posh chair and cool planter, but inside the one-stall ladies room I was a little sad. There was a stainless steel seat cover holder with the actual sheets in a box on the ground, the sink was clearly original to the building (white, ugly hardware, coming out of the wall) and the florescent light made me realize how I actually looked instead of how I felt in the shadowy glow of the downstairs. Hopefully it's on the list to get a makeover soon.Last note, I wandered a little and discovered a great banquet/private party room in the upstairs. Great for a sexy little birthday soiree, hip and elegant wedding rehearsal or even a girl's night out.EDITED following message from the owner:I take back my criticism of the bathrooms - they are common to the building, the owner informed me.

Think dark woods, fireplace, comfy couches and belly-warming scotch.Brought to you by the peeps responsible for De Novo, Manifesto uses the space previously occupied by the questionable Isabella's. There's a selective something-for-everyone specialty cocktail menu, and the biggest scotch list I've ever seen. The menu consists mainly of small plates and a few flatbreads. I think the concept of cocktails+snacks is perfect for the downtown location. You can have a full-on business dinner if you want, but long cocktail hours accented by delcious, sharable grub is in demand.The ambiance is... interesting, and mostly in a good way. The dark colors make the candles on the tables really glow, you feel cloaked and dreamy. The \"manifestos\" from famous peeps, inscribed on the walls, gives your brain some food for thought. I love the U shaped booths. But, the (albeit cozy) fireplace is one of those free-standing faux dealies. Some of the furniture is in really strange locations (like a single chaise lounge tucked in next to the stairs), and overall it feels like there's way too much going on inside of Manifesto. A lot of the oversized booths are so close together that I'm not sure how things function when business is busy. After a little while, some of the decor starts to look a little bit more homegrown than it should be.Our waitress was really awkward, but I suspect this will improve with time. She couldn't seem to remember who ordered what-- and stuck an Old Fashioned in front of my face (literally, just a couple of inches from my nose) waiting for one of us to claim it. I don't think she's waitressed before, \u00a0but hopefully Manifesto will improve some training.The manifesto flatbread was aight. Not the most interesting thing on the menu, but we'd already eaten so this was for nosh purposes only. I appreciate that Manifesto has true FLAT breads, not pizzas called flatbreads. The crust was a tad on the too-crispy side and a little dry, but the fun goat cheese and other toppings made up for it.

There's no sign on the outside of the building and an odd neon \"open' sign that doesn't really fit with the upscale vibe they are going for. Had to drive around the block before I realized you enter through the Fifth Third building. Got seated right away in a cozy booth, loved the moody ambiance. Great happy hour prices (wish they lasted past 6:30). Ordered some wine and the bruschetta and received loads of balsamic-drizzled mozzarella, whole slices of sun-dried tomatoes and paper-thin cracker crisps that couldn't hold the weight of the mozz slices or tomatoes. Weird presentation but tasty on an empty stomach. \u00a0Girl's Night: Wanted a cozy spot to catch up with a couple friends so I thought this was worth a second try. We went for a late dinner (around 10:30) and got seated right away. Shared a couple bottles of wine (their cheapest is $22) and some small plates. I had the arugula & goat cheese salad ($5), which was good but basic and missing something. I would have appreciated some more flavor. The portion was great though. We shared the butternut squash lasagna ($10), Manifesto Flatbread ($12, I think), and the fried mozzarella (around $6). Everything was just so so. The lasagna was good but again, missing something. Pretty one-dimensional all around.Date Night: Wanted to give this place a third shot because I really wanted the ambiance and cheaper bottles of wine. My fault for not realizing they'd be so busy for Restaurant Week - but I was willing to wait 30 minutes. This place is not conducive to waiting at all (and I don't appreciate hearing the staff complaining about being so busy). We were kind of perched on the stairs by the entrance until a spot in the \"lounge\" area opened up and we could take a seat and get a drink. While waiting, the hostess had to ask multiple times for me to stand so she could move the couch (physically move it) so a group could walk through. There is just NO space for giant couches if you can't arrange them for people to walk through. We finally got seated and service was slow, probably due to the crowd. Salad portions had shrunk (disappointing) and the food was again, just okay. We had the short-rib cannelloni ($10), which I was really excited about but it again lacked flavor. We also tried the Chicken flatbread \u00a0(maybe $12) and thought it was good but not amazing. Overall I like the vibe of this place and it's great that new additions are coming to the Downtown area. I wish the food was a bit more complex, but it's okay. I'll probably recommend somewhere else next time."], ["Rachael N.", "Dined here with some friends recently and had a great experience! The food was fantastic, and our server was very knowledgeable - was able to recommend some delicious wine and was very attentive.

Good times! :)We went to Marcella's first and foremost because it was still open, not loud, and yet was still crowded - as it had been all evening and night with well-dressed Columbus(ites?). \u00a0My first question at the host stand was, \"Are you guys closing soon? \u00a0Because I don't want to be one of those guests that comes in right before close.\"Answer? A very friendly, \"No, we don't close till midnight!\" \u00a0(It was a Friday).An amazingly friendly waiter made our trip to this establishment all the better. \u00a0He suggested three of his favorite red wines (all their wines are from Italy, so really, if you know which Italian wine you like just get that, or if you don't, maybe study before you go.) \u00a0We didn't really care for any of them, but ordered a carafe anyway.My husband kept saying Marcella's reminded him of our favorite pizza spot back in Chicago - where we first fell in love. \u00a0It was easy to see why, as it is dimly lit, with a lot of red touches, and a cozy atmosphere.A big difference, however, is that wine is served in carafes here, and the pizza is served on a stand, with stacked plates under it.When our gregarious waiter came back to take our order, I was pretty bummed already as I didn't see the option to make your own pizza.I asked, \"what is the spiciest thing you have?\" \u00a0He replied, \"well the penne arrabiata for sure.\" \u00a0I asked, \"but nothing pizza-wise?\"And then he said such magical words:\"Hhmm... not specifically, but we can make it anyway you want.\"A kitchen that doesn't mind making something *any* way you want? I tested that theory. \u00a0\"Can we make the sauce arrabiata sauce instead of your typical pizza sauce?\"\"Of course! I don't see why that would be a problem!\"(Say what?!)\"Um.. well.. I don't see jalapenos listed on here, do you have those for a topping?\"\"Sure! \u00a0We should be able to scrounge some up for you!\"(Hello? \u00a0Is this place for real?)Then we went about ordering our other typical favorite toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and sometimes black olives. \u00a0The waiter graciously took our order to the kitchen while my husband and I stared at each other, smiling in disbelief.When the pie came out, no lie, it was made exactly as we'd asked. \u00a0The spice of the sauce grew hotter the more you ate it, the jalapenos were perfect, and the crust was just between thin and medium thickness - and crunchy, of course.He also gave us a side of arrabiata sauce in case we wanted more.What a great salvation to the dinner we'd had earlier, and what a wonderful way to end our first (but hopefully not last) night in Columbus, OH.I wish I had gotten the waiter's name - but if you see this and remember a pink-haired girl and dark haired guy ordering spicy pizza, thank you!And thank you, Marcella's!I would love to come back and try your small plates ^^"], ["Bianca L.", "I have been to Marcella's several times and I absolutely love it.

I'd definitely recommend that and will be getting it next time!We only had to wait 10 minutes before being switched to a table. Where we promptly ordered our meals to share. We got the fondue, which is amazing, if you have more than three people consider ordering two, everyone will love these!!!! So gooey and mild and perfect. We got the beef carpaccio, which was lovely and tasted like a rare salty steak. There were only two ricotta cakes underneath, which felt like a bit of a jip there. But the salad underneath was great. I did expect the carpaccio to have a preserved quality (which is what I've had at other restaurants), but it was really just thin sliced raw steak, very good but different than I expected. We ordered the pesto goat cheese shrimp pizza, this was amazing! Not overwhelming in the least and the goat cheese is just the perfect addition! You'll regret not getting this. Also the beet salad; very good! Great healthy option that's tasty enough to not make you jealous of everyone else.

I remembered the 4 stars received on Yelp so I headed this way.1. Melted Pecorino Cheese with Crostini, Apple and Truffle honey ($10)One on of the first reviews I read noted this was a must have so it was the first item ordered.OMG, it was worth all the rave. Deliciously melted cheese with an awesomely crispy 'crostini' which is actually perfectly toasted or fried or baked toast, who cares! It was so crispy delicious. Then you dip it in cheese and then truffle honey, and add some fresh green apple slices, BAM!, what a mixture of texture, sweet and salty and freshness! It's a definite must have. Do yourself a favor though, once it is served, take the apples off the crostini. Beautiful presentation but if you leave it on, the bread will get soggy and you will lose the texture.2. Braised Veal Meatball ($9)Forgot I wanted to order this so I ended up ordering the beet salad and then had to add this. I must say it is one of the most moist and tender, flavorful meatballs I've ever had. Served in a cute mini cast iron pot, it's one of the definites here.3. Beef Carpaccio ($11) with shaved celery and warm ricotta pancakesWell, for $11, they gave a pretty good portion of carpaccio. It was good but the 'dressing/oil' was salty. I forgot there were ricotta pancakes underneath which I discovered a 1/3 into eating. It was a better balance of flavors with the pancake but still too salty overall. The quality of the carpaccio and quantity were great for the value though. What j didn't see much were the shaved celery.4. Beet Salad ($7.50): Roasted Crimson and Golden Beets, wild arugula, goat cheese and candied walnuts.Overall tasty beets and goat cheese. The candied walnuts were the Bomb! Again, however, went overboard with the dressing so things were too vinegary. Overwhelmed the naturally beautiful combo flavor of the beets, goat cheese with the spicy arugula and the texture and sweetness of the candied walnuts. A bit less dressing and it would be fabulous. But then again, a goat and beet salad for $7.50? No complaints, huh?5. And by this time I was stuffed but since my time in Columbus was limited I asked which one, lasagna or the risotto of the day ($17) she said shrimp and saffron risotto so knowing full well I was only going to take a bite and rest to go, I ordered. The portion that came out was especially huge and I had some cheese shaved on top. Again, the dish was overly salty but the flavors were flavorful, especially the charred garlic slices which added a nice depth. Until this juncture, I was a bit disappointed with the service. Granted the restaurant was extremely busy, even on a Monday night so I sat at the bar and the two bartenders seemed overwhelmed so the attention to service I was now expecting at Columbus wasn't there, i.e. no smile to be found on the face. But when she asked how the risotto was and I said it was salty, she asked whether they could do it over and I said it was fine but then she said she'll have them add more risotto to mix in and so I said sure. She brought the adjusted dish out and suggested I try it before I take it to go and I did. It was still salty but the extra effort is all I needed to be satisfied and happy. So the continued wonderful service of Columbus wait staff isn't tarnished after all!Now the biggest Tip ever is to go during happy hour!! I could kick myself for not realizing this before I came. I could've double the number of apps I could've tried for the same money!! ^^Okay, wish there was a way to give it an extra 1/2 stars. The waitress just to the risotto off the bill.

I've never had calamari be fried so lightly that it masked any unhealthyness that came with it. On top of that, the dish had a helping of other fried veggies to compliment the squid. I was in love with this and wish we had gotten another dish!Finally, the Sicilian Pizza was to die for! Plenty of meat for the carnivores, and the crust wasn't too thin nor thick. It was just the right amount for the ingredients on top!The drinks and food weren't the quickest to come out, but our lovely waitress made sure that our waters were filled and our bread basket was replenished. Considering how busy it got in the early evening (and the overall quality of the food and drinks), I'll let that slide.Loved my experience here at Marcella's.

My initial dining experience was positive. This made me excited about the Columbus food scene, hoping Marcella's was an accurate representation. \u00a0I've been back a few times since and I still believe Marcella's is one of the better Italian restaurants in town. There's something formulaic about Cameron Mitchell restaurants, but the formula works so i'm not hating. You can always expect a certainly level of aesthetic in a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. The atmosphere is chic with a bar-restaurant atmosphere. \u00a0The lighting is dim and the \u00a0waiters are uniformed and polite. Marcella is a busy and noisy restaurant, yet still maintains an intimate and romantic ambiance. It's a good date spot. The food, drinks and service have been consistently good. The prosciutto and melon, melted pecorino cheese and braised veal meatball are all great appetizers. Get the prosciutto and melon if you want something light and get the meatball to share if you're more hungry. The pecorino cheese is a fun dish in that you self-assemble your own crostini with apple, honey, cheese and small pieces of bread. As far as main dishes go, i've only ordered their pasta. They have all been good. I've ordered the ravioli mezzaluna, penne alla arrabiatta and the gnocchi con bolongese. Out of the 3, the penne arrabiatta is my least favorite and most bland. The gnocchi con bolongese is the most flavorful, but at the same time the most rich and filling. It comes with melt-in-your-mouth braised lamb and a generous amount of parmesan reggiano. Not for the fainthearted though. The ravioli mezzaluna is a good compromise in terms of taste and quantity. The goat cheese ravioli, bacon and mushrooms will satisfy your tastebuds without leaving you uncomfortably full. My date ordered the chicken marsala and seemed pretty content with it. I usually don't have room for dessert (order too many appetizers), but on one occasion I did have the Tiramisu and it was good. Overall, Marcella's is a excellent Italian option in the Short North. It's busy and trendy for a reason. The food and service are consistently good. \u00a0There are definitely quieter spots out there, but if you're planning a night on the town afterwards, there are not too many better places. I will be back."], ["Ashley M.", "do yourself a favor...get the melted pecorino cheese appetizer.

Great bread and olive oil served in the beginning. I would avoid the olives (extremely salty). Carbonara is best I've had in the U.S. Margarita pizza is authentic. Drinks were great. Although our table felt a little cramped because much of the food was spread out to be shared, the ambience is excellent and doesn't have a \"chain restaurant\" feel.

Treated like I had the plague. Seated next to a curtain. I feel like I am in a hospital, and there is another patient on the other side. Warm white wine, batting away fruit flies. Cold bread. Maybe because it took so long for Chuck to find the table? He's nice- but a little lost. No literally. Maybe a map from the kitchen to the table would come in handy? I feel bad. Sorry. I know it's not nice to be so negative. Side note- The Brussel sprouts could be a little \"cleaner\" for my taste. Maybe Brussel sprouts is code for pork and onions?"], ["Keith G.", "Went with a larger group of people and the food turned out great. \u00a0The table ordered a variety of options off the menu and everyone was impressed with what they had. \u00a0Our server did a pretty good job of making sure that no ones glass was ever empty. \u00a0The only thing that I could ask to be improved was the length of time between ordering and when we got the food but that gave the table time to talk. \u00a0Wouldn't recommend if you are in a hurry but I defiantly plan on coming back."], ["Catherine J.", "It's been awhile since I've been to Due Amici - this was my first time in for a full dinner, though I've had experiences here for businesses lunches and happy-hour-type events in their private room. I was trying to think of someplace girly and central for a low-key ladies' night. Due fit the bill; we took respite from the March Madness basketball games and enjoyed the soft-city vibe of Due.Service was good, nothing bad to say. Some confusion about seating later-arriving guests under my name with the OpenTable reservations (after I'd already checked in). So, 3-stars is not a bad rating, in my book. But what keeps me from going any higher (and from Due being on my regular dining rotation)? The menu. Yawwwwn. I was so so so bored by it. I ended up getting chicken parm, which was good, not great. I was in the mood for something comforting and ate it all, but the chicken was a bit overcooked. The dish was kinda heavy, actually, for how light and upscale the interior feels. I felt like every item was either lame or too expensive for what it was. Their salad special (I think) had something to do with feta and dried cherries? I could be wrong, but it was something like that. Again, yawn. I love the atmosphere, but Due could use a conceptual menu overhaul. I think Columbusites have come a long way with their tastes and preferences, and an update would do wonders."], ["Hannah B.", "Went for brunch because I heard the bloody Mary's were amazing. Well. Amazing wouldn't be the word I would use to describe them. Mediocre. That's better. Maybe it was the lady who was making them. There was so much large chunks of spice in it that it was hard to sip it through my straw. The taste was okay- nothing great. My breakfast was good. But I didn't really like their take on sausage. It was like hard sausage balls. Their home fries were good. Prices were a bit high for what they offer. Overall, I wouldn't rush back."], ["Sandy W.", "Went there last Sunday for brunch!

All I can say is \"wow.\" The backstory: my family and I are season ticket holders to the Broadway Across America plays, so we normally meet for lunch prior to a show. I laugh when they want to meet at noon for a 2:00 performance that is right down the street because there is no way it's going to take 2 hours to eat lunch. I was wrong. First of all, the restaurant was empty on a Saturday at noon when the half marathon just let out. There were four staff members behind the bar and a few more walking around. We were literally the only people in the restaurant. You'd think if it's not busy, we would be waited on hand and foot. Nope. Our waiter was nice, but clearly communication was off. It took nearly 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks (bloody Mary cart, water, and an irish coffee for 7 of us). Way too long for as many staff were behind the bar. I ordered the veggie wrap for lunch. It sounded good on the menu, full of quinoa, avocado, and hummus was the description. At 1:15 (we got there at noon), our food comes out and my veggie wrap is literally a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and onion. Not even stuffed full of it. It just looked like a wrap that was deflated. I actually did laugh because it was that ridiculous and comical that whoever made this never once thought that this would be unacceptable. Most people at our table had meals that were missing one of these ingredients, mainly the avocado (which is delicious. I want my avocado always! :)). Our waiter was nowhere to be found, so I flagged down another staff member (I would have normally waited, but since it was 1:15 I thought I'd get my issue resolved faster than waiting for the infrequent round of service). He barely looked up from his POS system when I told him that 2 of our veggie wraps were just lettuce, tomato, and onion in a wrap for $12. He said \"well, whats the problem?\" I said it's missing 3 of the main ingredients mentioned in the description. He said, \"well, the produce truck didn't come today, so we don't have avocados, hummus or quinoa\". I let him know if that were the case, then it would have been great to know that when I ordered the veggie wrap that I'd be paying $12 for a tortilla and some lettuce and could they remake my wrap with other ingredients. For the amount of time it took to actually get the wrap, they could have been to the store and back 3 times to pick out just the right avocado, quinoa and hummus for the job. He rolled his eyes and said he'd find our waiter. The waiter came around and apologized profusely and said \"so there's something wrong with the veggie wrap?\" So clearly the other guy just told him \"hey, that girl is bitching about something\" instead of explaining the situation, so I had to explain the issue again and on behalf of the other people who also got the same unacceptable wrap. He leaves and comes back and says, \"the chef said there is nothing else we can put in your veggie wrap so I'll just take it off of your bill.\" OK...fine. That still doesn't excuse the train wreck that was lunch. Really there is NOTHING else you can find to throw in a tortilla? Time to get a more creative chef. And we got out of there at 1:50 and that's only because we asked for our bills before we were finished with our meals. Yikes.What's crazy is that I've had a similar experience with slow service before our shows at just about any place we go: Manifesto, Chez Du Bon (which is closed and I'm not sorry), and the restaurant in the Sheraton, but this experience was definitely the worst. At least the other restaurants actually have the food that I've ordered, or have let me know if they are out of something. Why can't this area of Columbus get it together for weekend brunch? This part of Columbus could be so lively on the weekends during the day and these places are not helping. At least put on your game face for patrons of the arts! :)"], ["Karin G.", "My star rating would not be as high, if it weren't for their 2 for 1 happy hour deal. \u00a0From 4pm-7pm on weekdays, you can get two appetizers or two pizzas, 2 for 1. \u00a0We got the calamari and mushroom ravioli, followed by the Margherita and sausage pizzas. \u00a0Each appetizer and pizza is around the $13 mark, so this is a big savings. \u00a0The mushroom ravioli was excellent and the calamari was good, but no the best I've had. \u00a0The Margherita had a bit too much cheese for my liking and it needed some more seasoning - I loved the buttered thin crust though. \u00a0The sausage pizza was very spicy - too hot for me - so my husband took it upon himself to devour that one. \u00a0There is no happy hour deal on the wine, which c'mon!

I heard comments such as 'Give them a menu, after they see the prices they'll probably leave.' and 'Tell them the soup of the day is bad.'

We tried cutting the meat with our dinner knives but it would not cut through. It seems there was little thought in the serving of this plate.The pizza I got (sausage) was good, but a tad bit on the greasy side.

I guess monday is 1/2 off wine night, but I'd rather see lower prices every day. Most wine is $10-15 per glass, $30-40 per bottle.As far as price goes, after a reasonable tip, the cost of an appetizer, two dinners and a bottle of wine rounded out to $110, a bit on the steep side for what it was.This wouldn't really be a choice of mine, but it's one of the only formal dining options downtown (and all the others like de novo and sidebar are also expensive).

Unfortunately for us, it was too much of an intimate feel better suited for romantic dinners. And it attracted more of an older crowd on a Friday night, 50+. But we grabbed seats in the lounge area and got drinks. The host was very accommodating. He helped us order the house specials, when asked. Unfortunately, we were too full for dinner. I can only comment on the dessert and drinks. The tiramisu dessert was probably one of the best I ever tasted. I ordered one of the martinis with pineapple and the limoncello cocktail drink.

My boyfriend and I came around 8 on a Thursday night, and although it wasn't packed, it took about 5 minutes to get a table. The hostess was pretty much their weakest link. She seated next to this huge party whose stuff was sprawled all over the seat she expected me to take. Luckily she had no problem when I expressed interest in the table one down from them. Our waitress was fantastic. Attentive, but not too attentive. Personable, but not too personable. Waiters help each other out and help pick up slack if need be. So, you're never in the lurch. I pretty much had one of the best meals ever here. There chicken saltimboca on polenta was mind blowingly good! It was a perfect combo of flavors and probably the only time ever I have eaten chicken skin and enjoyed it. I am currently obsessed with polenta after having theirs and am actually afraid to get it elsewhere because it might not be as good. I think the dish was $18 and worth every penny. My boyfriend ordered the carbonara and it had better flavor that Martini's (IMO). I still find carbonara a bland dish that always sounds better on paper anywhere you go and even at home. We ordered Zeppolis for dessert and their oil was a little hot and got the outside of the doughnuts pretty dark, but nothing the powdered sugar didn't help. The dipping chocolate was my fav. The manager gave us the zeppoli on the house as we had mentioned in a casual convo with our waitress that we were celebrating. Overall really a great date night and a memorable dinner. I look forward to returning!Side note; To add to Bryant M.'s review...a topic of convo my boyfriend and I had at dinner was the odd music choice at Due. When I was there it was classic rock/drinking songs. I mean, yea, I liked the songs and even wanted to sing some, but it didn't fit the atmosphere."], ["Bryant M.", "Due Amici is one of the most underrated brunch spots in Columbus!I remember going to Due Amici about 7 or 8 years ago - even before I had officially moved to Cbus - and thought the place was entirely too posh for me. Then, through years of mediocre Yelp reviews and little-to-no buzz from the community, I thought this place was just one of those duds that happened to survive because some people thought it was \"fancy\" dining.Fast forward to today when I nervously made a brunch reservation, and what I found was a delightful surprise! When we first walked in, I was a bit confused. There was a bunch of girls standing at the front desk, and they all looked like they worked in an upscale salon rather than a restaurant. I'm assuming they were all wearing the uniform - each had on some form of black on bottom and champaign on top. And then there was the blaring club-ish music. Let's just say that my heart sank and I wanted to run out the door.I'm glad I decided not to.I expected all those blonde girls to be snotty and stuck-up, but they were incredibly sweet and helpful. Shame on me for stereotyping. And when we were seated on the other side of the restaurant, I started feeling even more comfortable: there were casually-dressed servers cheerfully bopping along helping their customers.Now let's get down to the food...The brunch menu is amazing. For $15, you get one brunch entree and a cocktail! Talk about a deal! And I seriously wanted to try every item listed. I decided on poached eggs and local polenta, the Mister got sausage gravy and biscuits, and our friend ordered the vegetable spaghetti and \"meatballs.\" Everything was delicious. We're talking \"lick your plate clean if that was acceptable\" delicious. And our mimosas and Brioso coffee were the perfect compliment to all the dishes.I can understand why people might be intimidated by Due Amici, but I would totally recommend going for brunch first before trying it for dinner - so that you can test the waters. And as a note to the owner or manager (if anybody reads this), maybe re-think the wardrobes and the music to give brunch-time a cozier, more inviting vibe."], ["Ayesha K.", "Went here one lovely morning for their brunch. It is located right downtown and isn't very hard to find, the restaurant definitely stands out. We had a lovely table right next to the large windows looking outside. We ordered their frittata del giorno and the stuffed French toast with the berry greek yogurt. Both items were satisfying and tasted great, but could have used a little bit more seasoning. Haven't tried this place for lunch or dinner but I do recommend trying the brunch."], ["Robert G.", "I was in town recently on business for three nights starting on a Sunday. As usual I had done a little advance work on places ot eat withing walking distance of the (dreadful) Courtyard Downtown. Turned out Due Amici was one of the only places open on Sunday night so I wandered in. So glad I did, I ended up eating there all three nights! The restaurant itself is nice. Exposed brick walls, rich wood tones, nice bar, clean linens on the tables. Being solo I took a seat at the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender. Moments later I had a drink and a dinner menu in front of me. Struggling to decide between the lasagna and the spaghetti & meatballs the bartender recommended the lasagna. Great call. A good size but not ridiculous portion. Bechamel and tomato sauce lightly poured over the serving. The meat was light and \"fluffy\", the noodles just right, the cheese a perfect compliment. You could cut it with a fork no problem. The taste was awesome. Followed up by a rather large tiramisu serving for dessert and I happily wandered back to my (dreadful) hotel around the corner. The next night I went back and had the spaghetti & meatballs. Damn good. For a simple dish they really pulled out some flavor. The sauce was a tomato/basil sauce and you could actually taste the basil. The meatballs were veal and were cooked perfectly. You could cut away sections just by resting your fork on them. The noodles were al dente, and the whole dish was delicious. The portion was probably just right for a normal person, a little small for a big eater like me. But hey, plenty of room for dessert, right?My last night I went big. Pepperoni pizza for an appetizer followed by the lasagna. Yes, the lasagna is that good. The pizza left a bit to be desired. I had hoped for a coal or wood fired more authentic pizza but instead it was a pretty average pizza. Not bad at all, just not on the same field as the other dishes. Next time I'm in Columbus I will stay downtown within walking distance of Due Amici. Its a comfortable place with great food and a friendly staff."], ["SM L.", "This is a very hipster joint, right next door to another hipster joint. The difference for me is that one has reasonable prices and amazing food, and the other has astronomical prices for so-so food. Due Amici is the latter.

For the price, there are other restaurants where I'd spend my money and I suggest you do the same."], ["Fujiwara S.", "Stuffed pepper with tomato sauce was a little bite spicy but very good.

The restaurant is beautiful and the service was pleasant. However, the food was terrible. I had a margherita fritatta, which basically tasted like nothing. The sides of house potatoes and an english muffin were disappointing. The potatoes were alright, but don't belong on an $11 plate. The (half) english muffin was totally dry. No butter, no jelly, no sauce on the meal at all. My boyfriend had sausage gravy and biscuits. He ate most of my plate and had 2 or 3 bites of his own. I am still hungry.

The bartenders were infusing a pineapple vodka and upon request, made a fabulous martini concoction for us - always the sign of a good bartender, when they can be flexible and creative. Anyone can make a cosmo or lemon drop. We ordered the lamb and bacon mac n cheese and the carbonara, both of which were very good.

There's only one, and if the restaurant is busy, count on a LONG wait for your drinks. You may be finished and ready to leave before the cart even makes it to your table.

Brunch at Due Amici on Saturday and Sunday starts at 11:00 and offers a brunch combo for $15 that includes a breakfast drink and a breakfast platter. The breakfast drink, however, is not your run of the mill OJ or chocolate milk. No, Due has revolutionized brunch by creating the most delicious, creative, and innovative drink strategy I have every witnessed: the breakfast drink cart. This wheeled wonder features made at your table and to your liking bloody marys and mimosas. This comment deserves its own line:THE BLOODY MARYS CHANGED MY LIFE! Created with multiple fixins, including hot pepper infused vodka, pickles, olives, celery, banana peppers, and multiple other secret ingredients that come from unlabeled bottles and shakers, their spicy bloody mary is matched by none! If there is a better bloody mary in Columbus, I pledge to eat (or drink) my words. Wait... I'm not quite finished. The brunch platter selections are also astonishingly delicious. My newest favorite is the Due Brunch Burger served cooked to your preference and topped with a over easy egg and strips of crispy bacon. It also comes with a tasty side of hashbrowns. The eggs benedict is also pleasing to the palate and if ever my love for the brunch burger wanes I will surely intersperse it.

What a head turning combination.\" \u00a0I pulled into the small parking lot. \u00a0I sat nervously in my car profiling the establishment: \u00a0nondescript, minimal signage, ethnic (in this case African), matching clientele walking in. \u00a0With it being a cold and snowy day I knew behind those doors would be some form of warm stewy goat goodness. \u00a0Check, check...double check. \u00a0\"I think this is the one\". \u00a0I head inside.The sign says \"Durbo\", but the Yelp site says \"Darbo\" as does some of the items in the restaurant. \u00a0I walk to the counter and look over the menu items displayed with pictures on the wall above. \u00a0I ask the lady working at the counter for her recommendations. \u00a0Sensing my anxiety facing such a crucial decision, she matched me to the goat curry with curry rice and pineapple juice to drink. \u00a0Oh yeah, about the \"Italian\" on the exterior sign - they have two pasta dishes on the menu, otherwise it's Somali fare.I sat myself down in the clean but minimally decorated dining area. \u00a0They're certainly not looking to create any ambiance outside of \"sit and eat here\" which is just fine by me. \u00a0I noticed on a table alongside the wall are complimentary tea and soup for patrons to help themselves to. \u00a0The tea was well spiced but a little sweet for me. \u00a0I believe the soup was made with goat stock, with slivers of white onions, and fat/oil globules floating on the top, but otherwise well strained. \u00a0It was a bit salty, but still tasty and best of all free.I was brought out a small pitcher(!) of pineapple juice, a banana (because why not?), and hot sauce. \u00a0Shortly thereafter my food arrived. \u00a0A heaping mound of curry rice on a plate with a small serving of salad. \u00a0In a separate bowl was a generous amount of curried goat. \u00a0The salad was just iceberg lettuce with a vinaigrette. \u00a0It was a nice contrast, but nothing special. \u00a0The rice had a rich curry and almost buttery flavor. \u00a0The curry goat filled the void I was looking for - bone-in chunks of semi-tender goat in a thick rich broth. \u00a0It actually had a little less of a curry flavor than the rice, and relied on a complex blend of herbs and spices. \u00a0I can't point out all that was in there, but I believe cloves were included. \u00a0The hot sauce was unnecessary for added flavor, but was still nice. \u00a0It had a slight sweetness and was a little hotter than what I would call medium.I was checked on twice by the very pleasant staff to make sure everything was to my liking. \u00a0I was never handed a bill, nor did I order from a proper menu, so when I walked up to the counter to pay I fully expected a $15+ lunch for the sheer amount of what was included. \u00a0She rang it up and it was only $11!!! \u00a0All said and done I was guided by some mystic force to a great meal at a great price, at a fast restaurant that had nice and helpful people working in it."], ["Jaja W.", "Went to try a new african restaurant with my ol lady. I had the grilled wild salmon and my ol lady had the fish sandwich. It was really good we had to order another fish sandwich. The service was really friendly and hospitable. Would return anytime without a doubt."], ["Leah R.", "This is a totally different place than I remember. \u00a0Same menu but altogether different recipes, and overpriced. \u00a0Soooo sad the old cook is hone. \u00a0The food now fated to remain but a memory. :--("], ["Amy S.", "Free Bananas and Pineapple juice.. \u00a0Yes to that!The Area is not the best ... most customers looked like regulars.. they will stare at u when u come in! do not freak out even thu its scary. Food is Good.. Get the Shawarma and chicken KK."], ["Jacinta Y.", "So I went to Darbo last night for the first time, and I really have nothing bad to say about the experience. The people working there were super nice and helpful. They provided free pineapple juice and bananas to each party in attendance. Plus, there was free self-serve tea and soup available as well. I didn't try the soup, but the tea was delicious. My husband and I were both pretty unfamiliar with Somalian food, but what we had (the chicken kk and shawarma) was delicious. We're definitely planning to go back in the future and try some other things."], ["Reaz M.", "Superb food, the people here are very nice. You get awesome pineapple juice as complementary drink. All the dishes are nicely cooked and very tasty. It is economical as well. They serve zabiha halal."], ["Sarah F.", "When we drove by, my husband wasn't sure it was open, it was a hole in the wall place. I ordered take out and it took about 5 minutes to cook. They gave me some sweetened pineapple juice while I waited, it was wonderful! I love African culture and enjoyed the food! The staff was friendly too. We got the KK chicken and it's the best cury chicken I've had since I lives in Germany. We also got a banana and an orange Fargo. The entire meal was plenty for my husband and I to share!"], ["R K.", "So damn good. Best Somali restaurant in town - and also the most accustomed to non-Somali patrons. Every single dish here is good, but get the Somali rice instead of japati or injera bread. The kalankal is similar to Ethiopian stews, and delicious. Seriously, it's so damn good."], ["Karen P.", "This place was awesome. \u00a0Like others, we were given the pitcher of pineapple juice and a \"bowl\" of bananas....which were very fresh and perfectly ripened. \u00a0 We ordered three items as we weren't sure what to order, but it sounded good. \u00a0The Canjeera was very spicy and good, but not as good as the other items. \u00a0The chicken steak with rice was wonderful and want to eat it now-we loved it. \u00a0The salmon was also so good, even my toddler was opening up wide for another bite. \u00a0Definitely need to return. \u00a0The food is great, service outstanding, prices are phenom and people are wonderful."], ["Dadio M.", "Voooooooowwwwww!!!!!! It so gooooood!!!! First, de free Chiqito bandana, den de free pineapple vaghter, den de meat! So. Mach. Meeeeeeeeeeaaattttt!!!!!! And.... riiiiiiiice!!!! I love it!!! I love de goats and chickehns and de cow meat!! and de species de pught on de meat!!"], ["Matthew B.", "I've never been to a place like Darbo Restaurant, but I can't wait to get back.I knew, or had been informed I should say, that the cuisine was a fusion of Somali and Italian tastes- which I did not and do not understand historically, culturally, or gastronomically, but I approve. The joint and its staff were friendly and welcoming, but the place was not very lively custom-wise, save for a brief period when some very excited young men came in to chat with the staff. I ordered the KK Beef Kalenkal which, pardon me, sounds like a Nintendo character. What it is, is, some sort of eerie magic wherein the clouds of heaven are harvested, infused into a cow, and turned into a food that has to be tasted- and wept over- to believe.Spicy, beefy, saucy... and full of \"noodles\" that were like strips of pita bread. Bread saturating in the sauce?! FUCKING. INGENIOUS. It took what would have been a great meal to dip bread into and turned that shit up to twenty-three. WAMMMMMMMAnother nice touch was the free pitcher of pineapple juice. I can't really describe how nice it felt to be handed complimentary and delicious juice, without even asking for it or expecting it. It was very inviting.I have to remember to make someone take me back here. I need to relive my experience. Just writing about it is making my stomach go coyote."], ["MJ L.", "Heard about Darbo from a friend who said it was \"delicious, cheap & a must-try\". I promptly checked Yelp for reviews & among all fantastic reviews, Matthew B's very much entertaining description of KK beef Kalenkal not only convinced us that we just had to go to Darbo but now! \u00a0So we headed out there this past Sunday with great expectations & we were not disappointed! The restaurant looked like it was converted from a brick house, the inside was painted in bright orange/yellow. Just as I read, a pitcher of pineapple juice was brought to us which was refreshing & perfectly sweet! \u00a0While we weren't offered milky tea, our waiter offered us veggie soup - it was lentil based soup, perfectly seasoned & velvety smooth in texture.We ordered grilled chicken steak with curry rice & of course, we just had to order KK beef kalenkal! \u00a0The food was brought out within minutes, we were impressed with such speed! \u00a0KKBK was just as described... Magic cloud & infused cow & all... LOL! \u00a0Think beef stroganoff on crack - jabati strips were textural stars & provided wonderfully chewy \u00a0bites soaked in what I think was tomato based sauce elevated by mixture of mysterious and delicious spices. Grilled chicken steak & curry rice were even better! \u00a0Curry rice was well seasoned & flavored on its own, now add strips of well marinated & grilled chicken (that resembles Indian tandoori chicken but boneless & better) to your bites, now we are talking about ultimate orgy in the mouth! \u00a0Portion sizes were huge & there was just no way we could finish everything. \u00a0When I came home from Darbo, despite being completely stuffed, the first thing I wanted to do was attack the left overs, LOL! \u00a0 All that food for about $8-$9 each, I really struck gold! \u00a0I just wish I had found this place sooner!"], ["Maharaja of Gaipajama G.", "Darbo is my favorite restaurant in all of Columbus. Last time I was here, about a week ago, I had the goat stew. I've had pretty much everything on their menu, and it's all good. I don't recommend goat stew if you're looking for spicy, though.It's clean, well decorated, and has the best tea in the world. And the tea is free, by the way. A meal here comes with a pitcher of pineapple juice. The servings are gigantic, the meat succulent, and the flavor jumping off the plate with spicyness. My friend always asks for maximum spicy, and they will prepare it to the level you want. The owner is friendly and jocular, and there is always community around. The time before last, there was a Somali gentleman hauling away trays of food for a graduation party. You know the food is good when those in the know are paying to have it at home!"], ["G. A.", "Pitcher of pineapple juice. Free banana. Help yourself to soup - goat broth.Service is nonexistent, and KKBeef tastes like glorified hamburger helper, in case you were wondering. It's unique."], ["Julie P.", "Well, I came back to Darbo, as promised. This visit was pretty much the same as last time, so I figured I should elaborate on some of the finer points I didn't' mention in the last review. The atmosphere is hit and miss. On the one hand, its quite cute inside. Looks just like the website - bright yellow walls, natural wood accents, nice art, spacious tables. On the other hand, both times I've gone its been so quiet and empty! It seems that a lot of customers get takeout. A little music would really help it seems less 'dead' - or maybe a TV? I ordered different things - zigni canjeera and goat stew. The zigni was excellent. Spicy veggie and meat stew, topped with a boiled egg, and served on a soft bed canjeera bread (which is similar to Ethiopian anjera). The goat stew was pretty disappointing - chucks of goat meat on the bone, floating in a thin, flavorless broth, joined by a few pitiful bites of white onion and green pepper. Go for the curry goat instead. They serve a spicy condiment in red bottles on the table, and I wish I had asked what it is called. While it is pretty spicy, it has a distinct flavor as well. Be adventurous and give this a try! AND, Darbo has breakfast, starting at 8am. Gotta come back for that..."], ["Nick S.", "In my (admittedly) limited experience with African restaurants I've found that they tend to be kind of stark: Harsh lighting, institutional-looking walls with just a few decorations to remind patrons of home, and functional (read ugly) furniture. \u00a0Darbo, on the other hand, feels almost warm and modern inside. \u00a0Add their really slick website to the mix and you end up with a Somali restaurant far more inviting to outsiders than most of its peers.That said, I've lived right up the street from Darbo for a couple years and have been meaning to try it that entire time. \u00a0I'm not sure why it took my until tonight to finally give it a shot, but I'm glad I did. \u00a0The service was on the slow side, but the food was good. \u00a0While I was waiting for my order (I got carryout) they offered me the soup of the day. \u00a0It was really impressive. \u00a0It was some sort of light broth with some sort of short grain (couscous maybe?). \u00a0For the life of me I couldn't figure out what the flavors in it were, but they were deep and complex. \u00a0I couldn't decide between the Chicken KK and the Shawarma Chicken. \u00a0Luckily at Darbo's prices, I could afford to try both. \u00a0The two dishes combined could easily have made three of four meals, so I'd definitely say the portions here are generous. \u00a0Chicken KK, I'm finding, is one of the most texturally satisfying dishes known to humankind. \u00a0Even when the chicken is a hair tough (like Darbo's was tonight), the pleasantly chewy texture of jabati soaked in that red almost gravy-like sauce is is enough to redeem it. \u00a0Having only had KK once before, I'm not entirely sure how this stacks up, but if pressed I'd probably have to say this wasn't as good as the KK I had at Banadir just because the chicken was a little over-done. \u00a0The shwarama chicken was really different than what I'd come to expect from this dish. \u00a0First, instead of pita they use jabati. \u00a0Second, the chicken is in some sort of red sauce. \u00a0Third, it had mayonnaise on it. \u00a0All that said, the dish works really well. \u00a0Jabati lends itself very well to sandwich making, and the red sauce and mayonnaise played well off each other. \u00a0Unfortunately, like the KK, the chicken was a little tough, but in spite of that I can see myself developing a serious Darbo shawarma chicken habit. \u00a0It was an excellent sandwich. \u00a0With all the Somali restaurants on Cleveland Ave I haven't tried, I can't really say how Darbo stacks up against them. \u00a0But, based on my experience tonight, I'd definitely recommend Darbo to anyone curious about Somali food,"], ["Stuffedtiger H.", "If your'e the type that's looking for a posh sit down place to eat with all the frills, this probably isn't for you. \u00a0If you're looking for damn good delicious food, large portions, and cheap prices, you'll definitely want to check out this place. \u00a0I went here for lunch with a friend and our first impressions on seeing the building looked a little run down and the parking lot a little rough on the edges. \u00a0We sort of took this to mean that the food was going to be that much more amazing...and it was. \u00a0I ordered the Beef Steak with curry rice and was amazed at how much meat was on the plate. \u00a0Flavors were strong but not over-salted and the rice was remarkably flavorful. \u00a0Even though I could have gone with the water, I appreciated the pineapple juice and free banana that came with the meal (yes, that's right, a free banana). \u00a0 I ended up taking home leftovers and eating it for dinner. \u00a0 Payments for the meal are made up front. \u00a0Most of the dishes are less than $10. \u00a0This was one of the best deals in town and I'll definitely be back at some point."]]}
