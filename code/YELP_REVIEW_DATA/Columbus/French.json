{"The Worthington Inn": [["Tia P.", "Nice cozy house-like restaurant that embraces that old Victorian-themed interior. Food was on point and service was great. I would recommend reservations and coming early to find parking. Nice family restaurant and cute little spot for romantic dates."], ["hollie w.", "I booked The Worthington Inn for my 31st birthday dinner with 16 friends. When we arrived for our reservation the room still was not ready for us and we had to wait another 10 minutes in the bar area for them to get it ready. This was fine bc the bar wasn't too crowded and there was a seating area we could relax in before being taken there. Once the private room was ready, we were taken back. The restaurant is essentially a historic older house in downtown worthington, and navigating through the restaurant was a challenge at times. The layout is awkward and very boxy. The high point of my entire time there (besides all my friends and family) was the private room. It was perfectly intimate and away from the rest of the restaurant. This made chatting and laughing possible because it was quieter in this room and we didn't have to worry about bothering other patrons of the restaurant. I was really excited for this meal. Urbanspoon had really high marks for The Worthington Inn and the pictures looked really tasty. Their menu is very brief, which I initially thought would be a good thing, seeing as menus like Cheesecake Factory that have almost TOO MANY choices, food ends up lost in translation. There's a simple assortment of appetizers, salads and entrees. I decided to try the shortrib with polenta and a Caesar salad. The salad was alright, croutons were too big and very hard to chew, but the lettuce and dressing ratio was perfect for me. The shortrib was odd- it looked almost like something Fred Flintstone would eat LOL..very big bones and taking up most of the plate. The risotto was dry and had zero flavor, and the carrots were seasoned alright but undercooked. My husband ordered the duck and thought it was bland and the only high point of his meal were his drinks. Very, VERY underwhelming and almost disappointing..considering our bill alone was close to $200. Another thing worth noting is that once we were brought into the room and seated, the menus we were presented with were abbreviated. If you remember correctly their full menu is already what most would consider abbreviated, so when we were initially given 4 things to choose from, I was not happy. I informed the waitress that we needed the larger menu and she asked her manager Adam, and he presented us with the full menu. Even with these issues me and my friends and family had a great time, but we won't be coming back."], ["Robert H.", "I had a very nice lunch recently at the Worthington Inn, which had been on my list to try for a long time. \u00a0I am glad to finally make its acquaintance. \u00a0One of the reasons I had not visited before was that I expected the place to be too Midwest Victorian kitchy for me. \u00a0While the setting was in an old inn, the service and the menu were modern and polished. \u00a0My one complaint is that the bathrooms, being in the dungeon under the inn, were not up to 5-star standards.My lunchmate had the Nicoise salad with salmon, and reported it as being a solid offering. \u00a0I tried the seafood saut\u00e9 which was a nice mix of shrimp and scallops. \u00a0For dessert, I devoured their sorbet trio which consisted of blueberry, coconut, and raspberry. \u00a0All were crisp and excellent.Overall, the food and the service were top-notch. \u00a0On the way out, we passed through the pub area, which apparently has its own menu and a 3-6pm happy hour. \u00a0I might have to check that out."], ["Vernon A.", "This place has been around for as long as I have lived in Columbus and I've eaten here many times. Without question, this has been an \"up,down, up, down\" deal. One year I go and get a fantastic meal, next time, wretched. Right now, 2013, definitely they have a good chef and the food quality is quite good. When the weather is warm people sit on the front porch, which we did. It is nice, but the street noise was so bad we found it comical at times. Especially when some chuckle-head roars by on their muffler-free Harley or big trucks start up at the light. Conversation-stopping LOUD. If you want quiet, stay inside. We had salads and all were fresh and well prepared. Everyone enjoyed and not one complaint. Beets nice and fresh. Entrees were all well prepared. Two of us had fish and enjoyed. Two had red meat and was very well prepared. All the food was high quality. Good coffee.Service was attentive and not intrusive.It is a lovely old building and if you have not seen, quite nice. And you can wander Old Worthington if so inclined. In all, go soon before this latest chef bolts and they go back to another era of terrible eats!"], ["Kristy M.", "We held a corporate event in the ballroom for about 100 people. The space was tight, but it was a great setting. The entire staff could not have been more friendly or helpful!! Truly the best staff I have worked with at an event. The food we ordered was delicious and well presented. I would only recommend testing the sound system before guests arrive as we had some issues with that and some food being delayed due to mechanical issues in the kitchen. Overall, a great experience though."], ["Rob J.", "Absolutely impeccable. Historic documents and interesting paintings adorn the walls. Many cosy dining spaces. Accoustically - it is an old building and sounds carry.This place is not cheap -- lunch with 2 appetizers, 2 soft drinks and 2 entrees was about $51.00 before tip. This is a great \"celebration\" or special occasion place.The food was prepared very nicely, cooked exactly as we ordered. I had the Nicoise salmon and my wife had a Caesar salad with salmon. The service was professional, friendly but not haughty -- though we were dressed very casually. \u00a0This was a very comfortable fine dining experience."], ["Liz M.", "I came to the Worthington Inn for dinner with some friends when I flew in from Cali to look for apartments. \u00a0I came straight from yoga wearing my comfy post-workout gear, so I was not AT ALL appropriately dressed. \u00a0In my defense, I had no idea what kind of place it was and honestly who brings nice clothes to go apartment hunting? \u00a0Anyway, the staff was all SUPER nice and friendly. \u00a0The meal was amazing, so I was really psyched to go back with my husband. \u00a0We decided to splurge for New Year's Eve.We started with the foie gras appetizer. \u00a0It was pretty good. \u00a0I had an amazing beet salad, but what really blew me away was the lobster dinner! \u00a0They did all the work for me. \u00a0The lobster had been de-shelled (if that is a word?), and then re-assembled on the plate into the shape of a lobster with a mashed potato head. \u00a0It was perfectly cooked and so tender. \u00a0I had a few pear tree martinis with the meal, and then the Cava sparkling split with dessert (a fruit crisp). \u00a0This place has a GREAT wine list and some really interesting martinis. \u00a0 Our server, Matthew, was very attentive, but didn't make us feel rushed. \u00a0He was knowledgable about the menu items and recommended a bourbon cocktail for my husband, which he really liked. \u00a0The bathroom is spotless. \u00a0It's expensive, but worth it!!"], ["Teri D.", "We had been told many times that this was the place to go for a special occasion or holiday. \u00a0Forget trying to get in for a holiday unless you book in advance! \u00a0I took hubs here for his birthday which just happened to be during a restaurant week. \u00a0The offerings for said week were good, but \u00a0we ordered from the regular menu.It is a lovely old house and I found myself wondering where do those stairs lead that are in the main dining room. \u00a0Staff was very attentive and informative. \u00a0I had a spinach salad which was very good and his house salad was appetizing as well. \u00a0The appetizer was a BLT...and yes! It was bacon, lettuce, and tomato. \u00a0But not as a sandwich. \u00a0Unique and yummy. Our scallops and short ribs were very good as well. \u00a0The short ribs were fall of the bone tender. \u00a0It's not a cheap place to go, but you get the full package of ambiance, service, and good food for the price. \u00a0I'd like to go back and try their brunch or the jazz in the pub."], ["Paul F.", "I met Big Baby Jesus and his friend, Steve (a non-Yelper) for dinner tonight. \u00a0We started off with a bottle of Pinot Noir that BBJ ordered for us. \u00a0I should add that the dinner was conducted at a very leisurely pace. \u00a0After our wine was opened we ordered appetizers. \u00a0I chose the field greens salad while BBJ got the butternut squash soup. \u00a0Steve skipped the appetizer course. \u00a0My salad was very good but the scrimped a little on the beets and sun-dried tomatoes.For my main course, I ordered the herb crusted trout. \u00a0It was served with orzo pasta, saut\u00e9ed spinach and Romesco sauce. \u00a0BBJ got the risotto while Steve got the dual filet mignons. \u00a0(These were on the regular menu.) \u00a0I think that BBJ and I agreed that I did better by ordering the trout. \u00a0It was really good.For dessert, I got the cheesecake and BBJ got the chocolate cake (with whipped cream). \u00a0His looked better than mine but mine was delicious.I won't bore you by telling you how nice the Inn is because that's a given. \u00a0But boy are the prices on the regular menu expensive! \u00a0And that's even compared to restaurants that I frequent like the Refectory. \u00a0But it was a good meal and if I ever come into some money....."], ["Doc L.", "Sadly, the Sunday buffet is no longer available. \u00a0I went 8-24-14 anticipating the wonderful buffet selection; but, was handed a menu for brunch. \u00a0The server said the buffet was discontinued because they frequently had to throw away large volumes of food because attendance was so poor except for holidays. I wonder if the buffet will return for major holidays (e.g.: Easter, Fathers Day, Mothers Day, etc.)"], ["Gene H.", "We have enjoyed the Worthington Inn for quite some time as a place to celebrate holidays and special occasions. Sadly that can be no longer. I made reservations and took the kids to The Worthington Inn for Father's Day 2014. We have enjoyed the Inn in the past as a family gathering place because you got quality food that was wonderful for the adults and the children. The beauty of the buffet concept was that the children didn't have to weight 20+ minutes for the meal to be prepared and there was always certainly choices to please everyone. The buffet is gone and the menu is very limited. The food was delicious for the adults but a complete failure for the children. The children were bored and hungry through the entire meal which made the meal less than it could have been, plus afterwards we had to take the kids to I-hop to find food that they would eat. I asked our weightier why the change his response was agitated, probably because he had been asked to many times. I will miss the Worthington Inn buffet and I will take that restaurant off my list of restaurants to recommend as a good family restaurant. It really is an adults only restaurant now and it is possible that is what they want it to be. To the upside normally I would spend in the neighborhood of $150.00, this visit ordering what we had available the bill was only around $42.00."], ["Drew G.", "We read a bunch of the reviews on Yelp, and as we were passing by, saw lots of people dining here. \u00a0We were seated quickly. \u00a0That was as good as it gets.It took our waiter quite a while to acknowledge us. \u00a0When he finally took our order, he actually rolled his eyes at us when we asked for butter (for the bread) and ketchup (for Parmesan truffle fries). \u00a0We ordered the recommended special, which was very dry. \u00a0Furthermore, my wife reports that the bathroom wasn't very clean. \u00a0Overall, not the best experience. \u00a0We were hoping for a lot more. \u00a0It may have been a bad night for the server, for the chef, et al. but that doesn't mean that we will be spending our money or time there again."], ["Monty B.", "Sunday buffet brunch is no more!

My entree was the scallops with bacon lardons, julienned vegetables and saffron risotto. Every bite of this meal was heavenly! The scallops were perfect and the risotto was out of this world. The sauce that accompanied the scallops was delicious. My dad had the seafood stew (a special), and he said that, while his was really good, mine was even better. My sister had the mushroom soup and the caesar salad with salmon, while my mom had the King's Farm chicken. They both greatly enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we had the frozen lemon souffle and the Belgian flourless chocolate cake. Again, perfection. The cake was perfectly portioned so that my chocolate craving was met, but not more than that. It wasn't some enormous slice of cake monstrosity. We were in the dining room, which was quiet until about 7:30, 8:00, when it started to fill up, but we never had to raise our voices to be heard. Our server, Eric, was phenomenal--attentive, polite, and friendly. It was a perfect dining experience, and one I am already looking to repeat!"], ["Nick S.", "I really want to love the Worthington Inn: It's gorgeous inside. \u00a0The service is outstanding. \u00a0The menu is interesting. \u00a0It's got a lot going for it. \u00a0On my two visits, though, I've never been all that impressed by the food. \u00a0My first visit was a couple years ago and my meal was forgettable enough that all I can remember about it is not being blown away. \u00a0I visited again for lunch today and my food was good, but not great. \u00a0I started with a cup of tomato bisque. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0But at $5/cup I expect a lot from a soup, and there just wasn't anything all that special about it. \u00a0Next I had Spaghetti Cassandra. \u00a0It fell flat. All the elements were executed well, but I just don't feel like it came together into into a cohesive dish. My wife had the Carnitas sandwich and it, too, was fairly underwhelming. \u00a0The carnitas were good, but the bun just sort of degraded into mush. \u00a0We both think it would have been better on sturdier bread maybe something more like the buns used to make tortas. \u00a0I feel like I've made the Worthington Inn out to be worse than it is, though. \u00a0Like I said at the beginning, the Worhtington Inn has a lot going for it. \u00a0I'm sure I'll be back. Our food was far from bad and the atmosphere and service are fantastic. \u00a0But, from a place like the Worthington Inn I expect great food and it in my experience it just hasn't delivered."], ["Roy C.", "\"O-M-G!!!!\" This place is delicious!

I couldn't keep my fork off his plate, I think he is now reconsidering his proposal. ;) \u00a0The chicken was so tender and juicy and had not one ounce of fat on it. The potatoes were amazing. I let him have the asparagus, although I am a fan.I ordered the Blue Crab Cakes. Holy mother....YUM. There were two and they were the size of hamburger patties. The crabmeat chunks were big and tasted like they came straight from the sea. We had just returned from Maine that day--and both said how we could have easily eaten the same dish on the coast. I'm all for trying new dishes, but I'd be tempted to get this again on our next visit to the Worthington Inn. They came with a tomato rice that was also excellent, but the crab cakes are what I'd be writing home about.Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert and had to save room for a couple beers with friends afterward.I'd definitely go back!"], ["Cathie D.", "I've been going to the Worthington Inn for lunch and dinner for many years. \u00a0It's always consistently marvelous! \u00a0Everything from starters and salads to entrees and desserts are top-notch and flavorful. \u00a0Among my favorites are the butternut squash soup and the scallops with Applewood bacon.Ambiance is very warm and old-fashioned. \u00a0December is a delightful time to go since they have lovely Christmas decorations."], ["Larry M.", "Went here for lunch on the Friday after thankgiving.

The short rib sliders were also tasty, but special mention goes to the deep fried deviled eggs. \u00a0I never would have thought you could improve on the tasty calorie and fat bomb that is a Deviled Egg, but deep frying it puts it over the top. \u00a0A special pat on the back to both The Walrus and America for continuing to innovate in the deep frying arena. \u00a0Maybe other countries are better at stuff like race relations, clean energy and universal health care; but we'll deep fry stuff and eat it! \u00a0As I'm now in my 40's and have to live long enough to pay off our mortgage and make sure my kids have a decent college fund, I probably won't be indulging in the deep fried deviled eggs too often (especially in front of my wife) but I do recommend you try them next time you're at The Walrus."], ["Brad S.", "Stopped in with a large group for brunch and had a very nice time. \u00a0Service was attentive and casual. \u00a0Coffee refills came often. \u00a0I had the deep fried french toast, which was quite good. \u00a0It's like those french toast sticks you ate as a kid, except fresher and better. \u00a0Amazingly it was not soggy at all, a testament to good technique. \u00a0Everyone else's meals were similarly good.

That's how I felt tonight at the much-discussed Walrus, on my first visit, when I ate a dish of their cauliflower mash. I had ordered it as a substitute for fries with my chicken salad, but I ended up just wanting a big bowl of it. Not that the chicken salad wasn't delicious, because it was. But yummmm, cauliflower.The restaurant, located at a prime spot on Main Street, is pleasantly minimalist on the inside. I found it unusually spacious. Most restaurants are packed with many tables as possible, but The Walrus incorporates large swathes of empty floorspace, with a front dining room and a bar in the back with a live music space (and a pool table!) where tonight there was a lovely jazz quartet playing. There were a lot of comfortable, secluded seating areas. The menu had a lot of interesting items. My dinner companion had the deep-fried deviled eggs (I knooooow) and I tried half of one. It was super delicious but I'm pretty glad that I only ate half. Good drink selection and cocktails. I will look forward to going back."], ["Danielle F.", "Cute place! Love the decor as well.

I noticed a pool table and a stage (guess they have live music from time-to-time) when going to the restroom.

Also, awesome sauce.Goat cheese Marinara balls - basically mozzarella sticks but goat cheese in a ball shape. GOOD! Lobster roll - not so much a fan but a decent amount of meat for price. Candied Grilled cheese - not too bad, not terrific either.. nothing stood out, though the candied bacon was a nice touchBuffalo wings - nothing to write home about.Short Rib Sliders - these were my favorite of the entree items we chose - full of taste."], ["Rachel C.", "Great drink selection, delicious food, lovely ambiance, prompt service.

The crowd is fun but not raucous. I love the exposed brick wall, Edison bulbs, and chandeliers. I had the lobster Mac, my husband had the cauliflower steak with wasabi home fries. We shared the lobster perogies and bourbon wings at the table. There was nothing I didn't like. It was a lobster rich meal and who could complain about that? I would recommend the lobster mac the most. It was rich and creamy, flavorful and decadent. I was drinking martinis but I thought the beer selection looked extensive. I will come back again.

Also their appetizer sizes are a little weak for the price. We only got 3 eggs and then when we had the lobster pirogies it only came with 3 as well. But got the lobster roll for the second time and it was just as good as the first.

They also have a nice, open patio that overlooks Main St. The location is a by itself at the moment on the South side of Main, but it's only a block away from the Columbus Commons and right around the corner from all of the 4th St. bars (16 Bit, Dirty Frank's, Little Palace). If you're doing some bar hopping in the area, it shouldn't be overlooked.The inside is nice and clean at the moment, since it's only been open for a few months, and it's a surprisingly big space. In fact, the area inside might be underutlized a bit with the central pathway leading back to the bar being very wide with no tables in between the booths. It's great for moving around, but if the place is busy, then it makes getting a table slim pickings. Since I've been here, I've seen one act which was pretty good. The space in front of the stage isn't very big, so if they get a popular act in here, I imagine it will be pretty crowded. I definitely want to come back to try the food, since I've heard mixed reviews. The bartenders I've talked to have all been very nice and generous in letting us try different drafts before ordering, so I'll definitely be back for drinks. The downtown area is really blossoming again, and if you're looking for a great selection of draft beers around the 4th and Main St. corridor, then you should give The Walrus a shot."], ["Bryant M.", "Somehow I stumbled into The Walrus on their opening day, but the experience was so great, I would have never guessed they were newbies......that's because they're not new to the restaurant and bar scene. These are the same folks who own The Tavern in Olde Towne East! In fact, the entire staff is chock full of restaurant vets, and their professionalism shows. I had the pleasure of meeting the manager, John, and he was delightful. It's clear how much he loves his job, and he has loads of passion for The Walrus. It's nestled in the heart of downtown on E Main Street, and there's lots of meter parking nearby. And FYI: did you know Main Street used to be named Friend Street? The Walrus created a wallpaper from a vintage map, and you can see the former name. (Can we have a throwback and use the old name?)The interior is gorgeous. I love how they've created very different, very thoughtful spaces. There's a huge garage door that opens up a patio. Then inside, there's a space with booths and tables where the acoustics are purposefully muted so you can have better conversations with your friends. And in the back, it's a bit louder and more of a bar feeling. In a nutshell, there's something for everyone.The Walrus has a huge drink menu, filled with delicious choices for beer, wine, and cocktails. And the food menu looks fantastic! There are definitely some bar favorites, but they're done in interesting and creative ways. They also serve more upscale (but still casual) dishes that'll please omnivores, vegetarians, and GFers alike. A friend and I split the sweet potato tacos, which were super creative and tasty. Picture it: corn tortillas, filled with lime sweet potatoes, black beans, avocado, cheese, and other tasty noms. We scarfed down every bite. I can't wait to go try out more of the menu!If you decide to try to out The Walrus while it's still new (and you totally should), remember that it just opened and all the kinks might not be worked out just yet.

The wings aren't anything special though and the sauce doesn't seem to stick well to the wings. That's just being picky.My biggest disappointment recently was at brunch. I understand it's only been two weeks since it's started (hence why 3* and not 2*), but some things are common sense people.I ordered the Bacon Melt (Waffle sandwich with Cheddar, Bacon and eggs). Firstly, there were NO EGGS ON THE SANDWICH. How can you forget the eggs?! Not to mention when I showed the server/bartender, he agreed and opened the sandwich for the cooks to see. Now here's what gets me...I'm pretty cool with a lot of things, but when a dude touches my sandwich and then they just put the eggs on the old sandwich after he's barehanded touched it, no thanks. They did replace the hashbrowns though...with under-cooked ones.I just don't know. With the high prices and the constant food disappointments, I see might rating continually taking a dive.

The Walrus version is pretty tasty; the bread held up the filling and dress really well and the pastrami was lean. The star of my plate, however, was the french fries. They were so crispy! Overall, I enjoyed my visit here. I am dinging them one star for some construction/repair work that was going on during lunch service. It was pretty loud.

The pricing was pretty fair, what I expected for the amount of food we got.We ordered the deep fried deviled eggs, the big rig burger and the sweet potato tacos. The eggs were delicious, they were wrapped in bacon and went great with the chipotle mayo sauce. The Big Rig burger was cooked medium well, came out like I wanted. It was definitely filling, it came with some fries which were amazing. I usually expect regular steak cut fries but these weren't the usual cut fries, they were a lot better. The sweet potato tacos weren't as good in my opinion, there wasn't much meat it was the vegetarian option I guess. So if you're looking for a vegetarian dish, then you will enjoy.

Towards the back is the bar and a live music stage. Now, I don't really enjoy live music (unless I'm really into the band) but if you're into it, you might want to try this place out. The food was just okay from what I heard from friends. I had a veggie flat bread and it was delicious. I was not super impressed by their drink selections but they have a solid draft selection and they're half off for happy hour. I had a lemon mule which was not the best but maybe it's just not my taste. No food specials though. Our server was great since we had a huge group.

Side note: I've heard good things about the live shows that they have, but I've not been to one. Two weeks after stumbling in here, I came back with some friends for drinks. We started a conversation about the decor. It's very fascinating because they have several different themes. They have some elegant mirrors and lamps mixed in with maps and your more typical bar art. My friends found it confusing, but I love it because it flows. A dew days ago, some coworkers and I decided to have lunch here. This was my first time having food at The Walrus and now I'm completely in love with the place! We ordered the deep-fried deviled eggs and portobello fries to start. Delicious! PLEASE, try these items. I had the maple burger with lettuce, tomato, and onions. Thank you to our server Jason for suggesting the extra toppings!

I did not go for food (which I hear is damn decent so this is not about the food) but went late at night with a few close friends to grab a drink.  We walked in, back to the bar and began to wait patiently. After about 15 minutes of the bartenders walking past us and not even paying us mind (even waiting on other people who'd come up after we did) I made a joke \"do they even server beer here, maybe all the liquor is for show?\". A fella at the bar assured us they would be with us soon (he was sitting at the bar, Shawn (Shaun) was his name I feel). After almost 20 minutes of waiting we decided to just cut our loss and head out. We were slightly outside the bar and Shawn chased us down, asked if we would come back and said first round was on him.  \u00a0 They did finally get us drinks but only 2 out of the 3 of us. One went outside to sit and I waited with the other as he waited patiently for his drink. After waiting another 10+ minutes he was tired of waiting. So I and the other fellow who was served a drink waited outside with out friend who was not.  \u00a0 I am very grateful of Shawn for buying us drinks, it was very gentlemanly of him. I am though \u00a0disappointed of the over all service. I have been to some of the busiest bars in town to where you could barely make it to the bar and order and never had such an experience. Perhaps we were on the wrong side of the bar? I am not sure of that but I am sure that it may be awhile before I give this place another chance. Maybe I will go on a less busy night at a less busy time of night."], ["Ry M.", "This place was really quite special! I loved the atmosphere, the smell, the vibe.

As of now, I feel like this place is just okay. I went here on a Tuesday night with a big happy hour group - like 15+ people. This is definitely a big enough space to accommodate a large group, and our server did a pretty good job of staying on top of everyone's orders. She got all of our checks right at the end of the night, so kudos to her! I like that there seems to be a mix of different areas; an area with open tables, a bar area, a stage area, and a small patio! The happy hour prices are great for drafts, as they are half off. There is also $1 off of wine. Their mixed drink menu seems fairly priced, as some of the cocktails are as low as $6. It would have been nice to have had some discounted small plates on the happy hour menu as well. Where I am hesitant to give a higher score is in regards to the food. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong item, but my sandwich was underwhelming. They have tasty french fries, but the candied bacon grilled cheese fell flat for me. I didn't really taste anything special about the bacon, and ultimately I wish I would have picked something less greasy. One of my friends had the sweet potato tacos, and said they were a bit dry. My fiance had the veggie burger, and it looked more like a sloppy joe than a patty. He thought it tasted fine, but it was lacking in structure and presentation for sure. I'm willing to give it another shot and try something different here for food, as I do like the venue and location. I hope to come back again and add another star!"], ["Jonathan D.", "Unbelievable fare. The atmosphere is great with music that isnt too loud. The menu is incredibly appetizing. We had the goat cheese and marinara and the portobello fries. Both were incredible and the fries came with an amazing sauce. My wife had the burger and it was perfectly cooked and dressed. I had the hot pastrami. I can't stress how good this sandwich was. It easily rocketed into my top 3 sandwiches in columbus.I feel embarrassed that it took us so long to get to the Walrus but glad we finally did. 5 stars without a doubt!

The inside is HUGE, I was there on a Sunday afternoon and nearl had the place to myself, I love the decor, seems to be a dance floor in there as well but that is not a substantiated claim. The bar is bountiful and offers many Ohio beers (both on draft and in bottle/can), I much prefer a bar that provides local brews and the deliver!I didn't eat - so I can not comment on the food, but go for the drinks, the bartender will keep them coming all afternoon!"], ["Luke T.", "Had a really good meal here a few days after it opened (maybe the second day actually?) I really love the decor and ambience. The giant open front wall is great, and the bar that runs along the patio, no tables, perfect for people watching, is a catch. The tables are high tops, which can sometimes be annoying, but made for good visibility up and down the long length of the establishment. This is a big step up from Tavern Old Town for the owners, but they're doing it well! The food was great. We loved the sweet potato tacos, so good! I got the bahn mi and it was spilling off the bun the whole time. Stacked! I also ordered a bowl of the veggie chili. We mentioned passingly that we were going to split it, and the waiter brought us two cups instead of a bowl. Thoughtful!The service was attentive, there were TV screens everywhere (basketball was on...score!) and for goodness sake, there's a frickin' pool table! GENIUS. Will be back. A lot.

I would be a regular if it was closer to my house."], ["Zack R.", "The Walrus is a lot bigger than it looks. It'd be a great place to ear with friends as most of the tables look like they seat 6 to 8 people. The decor is a cross between eclectic and just thrown together. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who let us sit where ever we wanted. It was slow, so we picked one the 8 tops that was a door with plexi glass on top. Pretty cool.Our server brought our beers quickly, and recommended the deep fried deviled eggs as an appetizer, candied bacon grilled cheese, and short rib sliders. Both the sandwich and the sliders were great. The candied bacon on the grilled cheese stole the show. They should call it a CBCT! The sliders were super tasty, and the spicy mayo on the side was so good, we got a second one to dip the already delicious parmesan fries.The reason for the three stars stems from an appetizer issue. The bacon that is between the deviled egg and the batter was basically raw. She apologized and brought us a corrected (and free) order. Still raw. She apologized again and brought out our dinner.After that, I think she was really embarrassed, because she brought the check after 4 or 5 bites. We assured her we weren't mad at her, and tipped 20% so I hope there's no hard feelings. But we did feel like she was kind of mad and wanted us gone. Bummer.Came back the next night to pick up our credit card which we had forgotten. Hostess sheepishly said it'd be a half hour wait before someone could get it.

Want to hear about it? Here it goes.I ventured to The Walrus during my beloved Restaurant Week, determined to try something new, funky, and fresh. The Walrus hit the mark on my requirements, and I was more than excited to visit and check out the scene.As my friend and I approached the entrance, I could tell the vibe was much different that SHONO spots, and LOVED IT! We approached the hostess stand and were told the wait was 25-30 minutes but there was no wait if we sat at the bar. We decided the bar was as good a seat as any other and headed to the back...and things immediately changed. Visually, the restaurant went from large tables with plenty of light to dark and dingy. And the creepers, oh why were there so many creepers in the back? Determined to enjoy the experience, we sat at two open chairs and waited for the waitress/bartender...and waited...and waited. Finally we were acknowledged, provided menus (had to ask for the RW menu - she forgot it was RW on a Thursday...) and began to make our selection for brews and food. One plus is that we were a bit indecisive about which beer to order and were able to sample a couple at no cost. Our first course came, which were salads. I loved mine! Rich greens with apples, dried fruit, nuts, and the dressing seemed to be made in-house. My friend wasn't overly impressed with her salad, but is more of a carnivore. Our second course were sliders and we decided to share, because hey it's RW! We went with the short rib and crab cake sliders, and I gotta tell ya, the short rib is where it's at!! \u00a0Very well prepared and seasoned. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the crab cake. I'm not sure if their prep game was off that evening, but my friend had to spit her food out because her bottom bun was soggy and the mixture of crab cake and carrots was difficult for her to swallow...literally. I cant' say I found the combination pleasing. What turned the experience into a vortex of evil was when another waitress came by, took our plates, and she asked why we didn't finish the sliders. My friend very kindly explained she struggled with the taste and the reply was \"Oh, so it's your problem.\" I interjected that no, it wasn't our problem, the combination was off and her bun was soggy, and I was met with the same response and our food was violently thrown into the garbage that sat at the end of the bar (where we were).Alrighty then... we both hoped this was all some odd fluke and things were going to get better.... they didn't. Our final course was just as bad... we took a few bites and threw in the towel. After the second course no one seemed to care as to why we handed back plates that were 98% untouched and I was so disappointed, we just paid and left. I expected so much more out of The Walrus. I certainly didn't want to leave with an empty stomach, lighter walllet, and the ultimate sad face."], ["Rick L.", "As mentioned in another review, I had to wait and wait to be seated.

Our server was very friendly, but I felt like we were being pushed out the door even when it wasn't overly busy and there was clearly no wait. The check was put on our table after our first round of drinks and two appetizer plates came out, but long before we were anywhere near finishing anything. She stated she could add more if need be.

Lindey's (where I last visited in the early 90's) has an elegant yet traditional brasserie feel to the dining room with all of the beautiful paintings and the long bar on the back wall. The mussels were excellent, as were the grouper and walleye dishes, perfect combination of fresh seafood (although walleye is a freshwater fish), vegetables, flavor, and texture. The service was gracious and prompt. The two wines, one Bordeaux (Margaux) and one red Burgundy (Givry), were two great selections from their list. I would like to see the correct wine glasses for Burgundy - my only suggestion. Well done folks."], ["Matt C.", "I only have been their for brunch, and it was after my first half marathon and I was starving so maybe this review is tilted, but WOW. We got the crunchy, fluffy, light Beignets to start which came with a decedant, definitely high quality chocolate sauce as well as a delicious rasperry syrup to start. Delightful. Their Bloody Mary was also one of the best I've had outside of Wisconson (bloody Mary capitol of the world), made with a nice peppered vodka. \u00a0Also had their coffee, which was rich, delicious, and served right in the french press to your table. Then I ordered the Heuvos Pork Belly, which came with a fried egg over pork belly, potatoes, sauteed peppers, and black beans, which were all incredibly spiced and full of flavor. \u00a0The house made tortillas were just a tiny bit soft on the inside and splendid. \u00a0Honestly, the pork portion itself was tiny, but the rest of it tasted so damn good I really didn't care. \u00a0Thoroughly impressed. My friend ordered their French Toast, equally impressive. Hard to do with such a staple, but again the quality of flavor and spice was spot on, and they stuffed the toast with an amazing banana puree and topped it with thick cut perfectly cooked maple bacon and strawberries. \u00a0And it was only like $9 for a very full plate?!?On top of the food, the ambiance was beautifully classy, and I felt entirely underdressed coming in after a MARATHON! So gross!! \u00a0But I was starving and didn't care, and the staff was entirely courteous and wonderful with a full house. I will definitely be back next time I'm in columbus looking for good food. Can't wait to try their dinner."], ["Stephen T.", "Eating at Lindey's was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Even walking from the car to the restaurant was something to remember as all of the buildings still use gas for their external lighting. The food was prepared by a team that cares about their craft. I decided for something simple, the rib-eye. Now, the steak was damn good, but that isn't what surprised me. It was the side of macaroni and cheese that came with it. Holy crap that was good. Do you know what a truffle is? If you were like the pre-Lindey's me, then you don't. The rush of flavor invokes an expression that my girlfriend immediately noticed. I didn't know such a simple dish could be this complex.The mac and cheese left me wishing I had ordered something more more interesting than rib-eye from the outset. Luckily my girlfriend ordered the grouper. I managed to steal a bite when she wasn't looking and my expectations were confirmed. Complex, fresh, sweet, creamy, flaky... perfect. The only downside is that I can't afford to eat there more often. Some things in life are meant to be rare and I'm fine with eating at Lindey's being one of those things."], ["Maggie M.", "If you haven't been here yet you need to go asap.

One of my favorite restaurants in Cbus. Great for special occasions or to take important clients."], ["K\u0101l\u012b M.", "Let's talk about Lindey's! I was looking for a classy, upscale restaurant to share a night of romance with my love. I also wanted to find a place that was a little more atypical - something special and unusual; outside the realm of the norm. Lindey's was every bit of that and more. And I really hope that they see this review.So, diving right in. The experience started with the valet. I wasn't too sure about parking, so I decided to live it up and let the valet park my car for me. The valet guy was very pleasant, polite, and quick, both when dropping off and picking up, and we made sure to tip him. The outside and inside of the restaurant were beautiful. My guy and I were brought back to our table in a cozy little corner, and the waitress came by and lit a candle for us. I absolutely loved that! Our waitress asked us if we were celebrating an anniversary or just having a romantic night out. I told her it was just a night out, but I didn't elaborate too much. I am actually from out of state. I used to live in Ohio, but I joined the military and ran away from home 4 years ago. The guy I was with, he is more than a best friend, but we're also not in a relationship due to our circumstances. We've been close for several years, since before I joined the military. We do what we can, see each other when we can, love each other as much as we can. We don't get many romantic nights out due to our distance, so that's why it was so very important to make this experience special. And I can't thank the staff enough for making that happen. Our waitress was the bomb, and I wish so badly that I could remember her name - I'm terrible with names. She was very kind and very attentive; very neat and thorough; very familiar with and informative about menu items. She was even kind enough to take a couple of pictures of us after dinner, before we left.For our dinner \"warm-ups,\" I ordered a House Salad and a Lobster Bisque Soup. My man ordered just a House Salad. The salad was great and tasty! So was the soup! One thing in particular that I really liked about their Lobster Bisque was that they also add small chunks of lobster to it. For the main course, I ordered the Salmon plate. It was SOOO good. It came out exactly as described on the menu and by the waitress. Everything was cooked perrrfectly and the flavors were just outstanding. My man ordered the Filet Mignon plate. He was very pleased with his steak and let me try a bite, and I thought it was heavenly. The presentation of both of our plates were also very pleasing. He paired his meal with a Corona & Lime and I paired mine with a Riesling. After dinner, we were both SO STUFFED, but we decided to cram down some dessert. We decided to split a Creme Brulee, figuring that was probably about the only thing out stomachs could manage at that point. The Creme Brulee was the perfect finish. I did note that there was a little bit of a burnt spot on the caramelized surface, but I didn't bring it up to the waitress. I'm sure if we had, she would have been more than happy to correct it, so I don't really fault them for it at all. We were on bit of schedule and didn't have much time left to burn there. The grand total for the evening ended up being around $110 - and worth EVERY penny.Lindey's was absolutely fantastic. It was everything I would expect and more, from the food to the service. I would definitely go again. In fact, my man and I were talking about making it a thing between us to have a romantic outing there whenever I come home from now on."], ["Annie T.", "Seriously lindeys....

We sat at the bar while we waited, there was only about a 30 minute wait for outside. Everyone, except myself obviously got an alcohol beverage. My mom said it was the best Lemon Drop Martini she has ever had. And I'd like to say, she knows her Lemon Drops! :) The bartender asked why I didn't order a drink, so I jokingly said I was knocked up. But being thoughtful, he made me a Chocolate Milkshake on the house! The bartender was extremely nice and I wish I would have gotten his name so give him a shout out!30 minutes passed and we went outside to be seated. Again, the outdoor seating it gorgeous on a summer night. I recommend waiting if you have the patience. It's a great atmosphere for a summer dinner in German Village!Again, since we are first timers, we tried a little more food than what we would normally do! For our appetizer we tried the Heirloom Tomato Flatbread and it was one of my favorite items we had in the evening! My mother and I split the wedge salad as a side and it was a very good salad, I would definitely order it again!For my meal, I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was decent. I felt as if it was a little burnt because it had Gorgonzola Cheese on it, that I could barely taste due to it being cooked for too long. Which, was a slight disappointment, because that's the main reason I ordered the filet. The side of mashed potatoes it came with rocked though! Just wish I could have had more flavor to the filet and the entire meal would have been knocked out of the park!Everyone else with me loved their meals as well! They were all very decent sized portions! They didn't leave you feeling hungry! Even if you didn't get an App or salad.All around, I'm sure we will be back since it's close to home.

Not gonna say Applebee's, but you get my drift, KWIM? \u00a0Don't wanna disrespect this place. Good date nite spot, but, unfortunately, get a cocktail and some bar food and go somewhere else. Tip the valet fellas well, they look out for your ride like it was your own."], ["Shelley S.", "Oh where oh where has Lindey's gone? I'm serious! I have been going to the place since it opened. My last 2 visits have just bewildered me. Both times we sat at the bar for dinner, once outside and once inside. The bartender was so \u00a0distracted by having to make drinks for the entire place , alone. The managers didn't seem to care. Both times the food was delayed and cold. Once there had been a shift change and the new server didn't even realize we had ordered food, till we asked where it was. Of course it was cold and we just decided to give up. The old days of Lindey's being the neighborhood gathering place are gone. Who has taken their eye off the ball?"], ["Sharon P.", "Lindeys is well known and recommended by Columbus locals, and for good reason. I first hosted a dinner here four years ago for twenty people, all out-of-towners. The manager and wait staff were so accommodating, the restaurant has a comfortable sophisticated design and the food was exceptional. Our CEO, who's quite a foodie, and everyone in our group, they raved about each course that was served so much we set our plans to come back the next year we were in town.The following year we returned with special guest Matt Hughes and seventy guests for a private dinner upstairs. I have to thank and applaud this restaurant because they always make sure to have ample wait staff attending to your group - no matter what the size, and they're all professional and friendly. \u00a0The wine selections are terrific and the large spread of appetizers that welcomed the group was astounding from carpaccio to scallops and more. I still remember it well, it was that good, all our guests thoroughly enjoyed the dinner and atmosphere. We returned this year as a group of eighteen and they still remembered us. That says something about a restaurant if they have staff that stays for years, and the reason we will keep returning! The wines were superb, the appetizers of pot stickers and Arancini were to die for and the next course salads fresh and perfectly prepared with light delicious dressing. Our entree favorites were crab cakes and the tournedos of beef. Some of our bigger men (we were in town for the Arnold) ordered two entrees after enjoying the appetizers so much. \u00a0Dessert followed which was fresh berries and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0Lindeys' chefs never miss a beat, each course was absolutely delicious, beautifully prepared and in perfect portion.I just love it here and love the people. I'm originally from Ohio and had family and friends recommend the restaurant to me, I've since told dozens of others to be sure to go here. You won't be disappointed. Lindeys you can expect to see us next year!!"]], "Mouton": [["Joni W.", "Classy joint, great service, solid drinks!"], ["Adam R.", "Decided to give this place a shot after dinner. Got lucky and walked in as a couple bar seats opened up. One guy poured us some water but didn't say a word. Then after staring around a while we finally got some acknowledgement. Ordered a drink and it was amazing."], ["Michael M.", "Some friends and I were in the mood for a fancy cocktail. I've known about Mouton but have never been so we decided to try it out. It was a good choice.On a Friday night around 11, it had enough people there to give it some ambiance, but we were able to get a table for the four of us without a problem. The place is small so while the feel is very cozy, I could see it getting crowded. Didn't happen for us though.When I came up to the bar to order for our group, the bartender said he would come over and take our orders. He was very friendly even though the busy day had beat him up (his words) and he was visibly tired. Drinks were very good. Between our group we had a Moscow Mule, Old Fashioned, Giggle Water, and Welcome to the Club (mine). The first two were good but standard. The Giggle Water was way to sweet for me (and even for the girl with a sweet tooth who ordered it). My drink was great. I would get it again except that I want to try other drinks!Its entertaining to watch them make drinks. One they were using beakers for. Other involved lots of pyrotechnics and basically pouring fire from glass to glass which I think captivated the entire bars attention. Drinks are $10 each, which is pricey if you wanted to get drunk, but reasonable for a nice cocktail if you want to enjoy and relax.In summary, Mouton is a nice place to enjoy a good, maybe unique/new drink, and is surprisingly unpretentious (I mean it is a craft cocktail place). Don't be scared of the price, but certainly be aware going in."], ["Robin C.", "I must admit I've been curious about this place for a really long time. \u00a0I've delayed my visit because of mixed feelings that Mouton simply wouldn't be my bag. How wrong I was. There was absolutely nothing about this place that I didn't \u00a0love!From the jazzy barkeeps, or should I say mixologists, who are weaving together some of the most delightful drinks I've had all year, to the casual yet somehow upscale vibe that was relaxed by the hip hop beats that flowed through the air all night long. It's so complex yet simple that I can't help but to want to go back...and so I did the very next night where I challenged Chris to make me something hot and spicy. I mean, \u00a0we are what we drink right? The drinks aren't cheap so please don't show up looking for a $5 Margarita. \u00a0Be prepared to peruse a menu full of craft cocktails and hopefully walk away with some great memories with good friends."], ["Chris H.", "The year was 2013, I was Columbus for the week I was quite a thirst by the time Friday came around. I used yelp to find a good dinner spot but the place was going to take about 20 minutes to get seated so I decided to walk across the street to this place. Sat down at the bar and ordered a Manhattan, they game me an Old Fashioned instead... yea wrong order, good start right? Lucky for me the two are interchangeable as they are my favorite drinks. Thats when it happened... I had the best Old Fashioned I have ever had in my life. It was not good, it was not great, it was THE BEST. Hell it could possibly be the best whiskey drink i've ever had.Drank it slowly, ordered another and I didn't want to go home. Well Done!"], ["Arvid Y.", "I've known about Mouton for awhile now, but I never got a chance to check it out until last weekend. It's located on the quieter part of Short North across from Northstar. My first impression is that the physical space at Mouton is small. With only a handful of tables and bar seating, it likely has a maximum occupancy for about 25 people. \u00a0The atmosphere is modern and open-concept, with high ceilings and large windows facing High Street. Even though the interior is clean and shiny, Mouton also feels a bit cold to me. Granted the frigid winter weather doesn't help, but I feel like Mouton is lacking the warm wooden tones and lighting that I enjoy in a cocktail bar. It lacks coziness in my opinion. \u00a0The drinks, however, are fantastic! I had a Sazerac and a Whiskey Sour. Both are amazing and among the best i've had here in Columbus. I also like how their cocktail menu lists drinks on scale from lightest to strongest. I think it really helps customers in trying new cocktails. \u00a0I also ordered a cheese and charcuterie board. It does not pair up quite as nicely with cocktails as it does with wine, but is still a welcomed addition. The bread, cheese and meat are all fresh. I also love that they include two different types of jam on the plate, along with olives and peppers. It's nice to nibble between cocktails.Overall, Mouton's atmosphere is a little less welcoming for me as compared to other cocktail bars. However, their drinks are top notch and I doubt you will be disappointed no matter what you order. There are a bunch of good cocktail bars in Columbus. Curio, Denmark and Sidebar 122 are just a few that i've been to. Now I can add Mouton to that list."], ["Mandi S.", "Mouton was a refreshing change of pace for me - it has a saloon feel walking in, but the drinks are so much more!I flipped through the entire menu before landing on the \"last resort\" many because the menu told me to order it & I was immersed into a lime/vodka heaven. My only drawback is the drink prices - but it does keep the riff faff out, so I will continue to pay more for drinks to ensure a quiet ambiance."], ["Josh D.", "Solid drinks over all. Good classics that are done right. I'm a cocktail enthusiast with a home bar but there are some pretty solid drinks at Moutons that just aren't really worth making at home. Some may think it's a silly thing, but their big cubed ice is actually really great. Minor dilution is key for certain cocktails and they do it right. My one downside with this, as others have stated, is better staffing. Obviously you want to have well versed people behind your bar, and a good cocktail will always take a minute to prepare.. but they could really stand to have ONE more person behind that bar. It would go a long way to help speed things up. All in all, I would certainly bring some friends here to show them a thing or two."], ["Amanda J.", "Went in at 9:30p and was told he'd already done last call, a full half hour before closing at 10:00p. We just wanted a cocktail and said that only to be told we could have beer or wine. It's already off of the beaten path and after this we won't make the effort to return."], ["Varun P.", "You know I like this place. The service used to be on point, but today I have a grievance. I was visiting from out of town and I was there with my sister and she ordered a 'bartenders whim' with gin and they brought the on tap Cosmo (vodka). We didn't make a fuss at that time, but they charged the price of the 'whim' and now I am passive aggressively writing this review. They need to hire more bartenders that can better address a larger crowd and actual orders. Honestly, like bartenders shouldn't have to measure the drink ingredients.

Columbus is clearly a beer drinking town so great cocktail bars are worth noting and this is one of them. They've got a drink called, \"The Flaming Moe\" a la Simpson's.

I can't even stand it.You offer my palate a delectable array of (very strong) sophisticated cocktails as well as a veritable cornucopia of edible options (hello, imminent food baby!). All served up in an effortlessly-cool-like-SoHo vibe? Ugh. Yeah. You're kind of le poo.The ONE complaint I might utter is that you are a tad on the tiny side. Which makes me a bit salty when I want to get my Mouton on and there are too many other annoying peeps taking up your valuable table space. Le sigh.That aside, I still totally heart you.Xoxo,CK"], ["Alex T.", "Good cocktails. \u00a0Worst service in Columbus. \u00a0If you want signature cocktails, they can make it but if you don't want to wait a half hour even if the place is empty, better off with curio or side bar."], ["Sabrina R.", "Frankly I don't know much about craft cocktails, but they always manage to get a drink in front of me that I thoroughly enjoy. Absolutely worth trying."], ["Jonathan L.", "If you are looking for cocktails crafted with precision, then look no further than Mouton. I was here on a Monday night, so the bar wasn't too busy. Our bartender Geoff was so amicable and attentive that it felt like I was having drinks in his private bar. Throughout the night, he also offered us a couple of different whiskey samples.Onto the drinks, I ordered the Moscow Mule, which was a draft cocktail and at $10 a cup, it was definitely worthy of that price tag.The bar is fully stocked with fresh ingredients (herbs, eggs, and hand made mixers). I was especially intrigued by the brown eggs, which are apparently used to produce a meringue like texture when shaken in the drink correctly. I'll have to definitely try that the next time I'm back.You pay for what you get, and since these are top shelf craft cocktails, expect to pay about 10-12 dollars for each drink. However, coming from DC, I thought the prices were pretty fair, not sure how it compares to the other upscale bars in Columbus though.Overall, I had a wonderful experience here at Mouton and would highly recommend it for those looking for a unique cocktail experience!"], ["Nicole O.", "One of the main reasons I love Mouton? \u00a0They know how to make a decent French 75 and don't say \"huh?\" when you ask for one!Great cocktails, bartenders who are happy to help you figure out what you want or make you something custom, great atmosphere, and excellent snacks.It's a go-to place for taking friends who are visiting from out of town or stopping for a pre-dinner cocktail!"]], "Refectory Restaurant & Bistro": [], "Bon Vie": [["Bethany K.", "This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. \u00a0We were warmly greated upon arrival. \u00a0I had done some shopping prior to dinner, and we were given a table that had plenty of room for me to place by bags on a seat vs on the floor ~ I am sure this was coincendnce, however, I'd like to think they did it on purpose.The waiter was extremely friendly, and was prompt with putting in our lobster bisque order... YUM!My husband ordered the Chicken Crepes, and I chose my usual, Roquefort Crusted Filet.... both were excellent. \u00a0The crepes were creamy, and cooked to perfection. \u00a0My filet was a large, excellent cut.... succulent. \u00a0The only complaint, my side of mashed potatoes.... they had an odd texture... almost instant like... they paired well with something I already had at home.I defintely will return!"], ["Shuo F.", "We went here with a party of 12, sat at a table with a direct view of the round about in front of Tiffany's. The view was beautiful, especially with all the Christmas lights. However, that's where our positive experience ended. I haven't had too much experience with French food before, but this place was more American than French. I ordered a medium New York strip, and it was definitely cooked medium rare. Aside from that, at least three of us got the wrong food. Two other guys and I did not get our food until everyone else in our party was finished with half of their food! I had specifically ordered my steak with Mac n Cheese instead of mashed potatoes...but what did my steak come with? Mashed potatoes. When they realized their mistake, they brought me their Mac n cheese, which was delicious...however the steak was not flavorful at all and was too rare...but I didn't complain since I was too hungry. The other two guys who got their food late were not as fortunate. Neither of their steaks were done correctly, then it took the kitchen another 20 or 30 minutes to finally bring out their food...so the rest of us just watched them eat. For a restaurant that comes off as \"nice\", I think this is unacceptable. The restaurant manager did give everyone $10 vouchers, lots of free drinks, and free desserts. I'd have to say their desserts were amazing...which bumps the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I honestly don't think I'll be going there again. Maybe if the party was smaller the service would have been better, but I was still disappointed in the steak"], ["James D.", "A decent atmosphere, but far too large for a really intimate meal with someone.The wine list is particularly disappointing. \u00a0In a French-themed restaurant, one would expect at least some French standards on the list (sancerre, vouvray, etc.). \u00a0There were more American and Italians wines on the list, which was a disappointment.The food choices are rather cliche, and represent unimaginative interpretations of French classics. \u00a0I was unimpressed with the offerings on the lunch menu.The Sunday brunch menu presented a few decent options, including Eggs Benedict and a Croque Madame. \u00a0I had the latter, and was pleased--it was almost authentic, although the addition of Hollandaise sauce was a bit off-putting. \u00a0And while most French sandwiches come with a very light salad of a few fronds of a frisee lettuce, this plate was dominated by an American-sized spinach salad that was tasty but a bit of a turn-off just due to its abrasive presence on the plate. \u00a0Presentation was distinctly American.Overall, I probably won't eat there again. \u00a0The waitstaff were nice and attentive. \u00a0But overall I have dined at far more authentic French bistros in this country at less cost and with better quality food and drink."], ["Margaret G.", "Came to \u00a0Columbus for a pleasure trip.

Very friendly servers and great outdoor seating. We first visited Bon Vie when I came to Columbus for an interview, and it was one of the selling points. Lovely area overlooking the main fountain in Easton, gives the illusion of eating out at a wonderful Parisian cafe in France. The martinis are excellent as is their wine selection. The martinis are $5 on Wednesdays. The salt & pepper shrimp appetizer is outstanding, as are their mussels and flatbread. The steaks are not bad although not their strongest suite.

We were told that we would not be accommodated even though all chairs and tables were still set up outdoors. I find it displeasing that a restaurant such as this will not accommodate those with disabilities.

I definitely won't be trying this place again, especially with how rudely we were treated for even asking.We love to try new places and we eat out quite a bit - however, it is places like this that make our lives a little harder and wary to take the little one to new places.

We sat on the patio over looking the water fountain and ate some of the most delicious PEI Mussels we've ever had. The sauce was so killer that we order extra bread to soak it all up and fought with the bus boy who was determined to take our bowl of sauce away from us. I ordered the swordfish which was ok, a bit tough honestly. What struck us was the service. Mostly every seat was taken on the patio and the servers were all very attentive nonetheless giving us the opportunity to relax and just enjoy our dinner. I ordered the sangria, and another one for good measure since the first was so damn tasty. I give this visit a 5 star hands down.Last night we returned, craving those mussels to find that they were taken off the menu. It happens but we were really upset. We probably wouldn't have come here if we knew. We weren't so hungry to order dinner so we picked an app and shared a salad. We got the calamari & shrimp app which was ok. It was cooked properly but the sauce was pretty bad in my opinion. It was a cream base sauce with chili peppers but the sauce was so sickly sweet that I barely ate any. The salad we ordered was the balsamic chicken salad. Before I go on I'll stop by adding that our server was horrible. She was an older lady with short wavy hair and the most bitter attitude towards us. Perhaps our spontaneity which lead us here for a late lunch despite our slightly relaxed clothing set her off? Yet other people were dressed more relaxed then us so that couldn't be right. Maybe it was our lack of hunger that had us only ordering an app and salad that pissed her off? Yet again this happens all the time. So why was it that we were treated so horribly when she was being very nice to every other table she waited on?! I guess I'll never know. But to say she was cold towards us and never came over to see how we were doing was only the beginning of why we never return here. The salad came out on two plates since we were sharing, a nice touch. The negative here was that they forgot to put the balsamic dressing on it and it took us 15 mins to get our waitress to actually stop and listen to us for a min. Then she forgot and yelled at some guy to get it for us; another 10 mins. By the time we got the dressing our chicken was cold and the lettuce was very soggy. The chicken was also very dried out and made the whole dish unappetizing. To make matters worse our waitress never came over to see if things were ok with our salad, not before and not after getting our dressing. The only time we saw her after that was a blur when she ran past us, dropping our bill, as she went to another table. No discount on our bill, no apologies, nothing. I've never been treated so cold in all my life. I've had bad service numerous times but never have I felt unwanted at a restaurant. No stars for this visit. None. I'm horrified that the owner hasn't seen to that this woman be fired let alone demoted."], ["Liz M.", "Bon Vie is probably the my least favorite of the Bravo! Entertainment Group's restaurants. They secured that decision last night. I've been to Bon Vie approximately 5 times and it seems like the food is progressively getting more and more disappointing every time. Last night, my friend and I went to dinner and sat on the patio, which was nice, but the loud cars and motorcycles driving by left something to be desired. Anyway, our server was pretty good. He was respectful and humble. I thought it was strange he asked us if we'd like to order before we had even gotten our cocktails. I think he was stalling because they took FOREVER. We both order the burger at his suggestion. They came out after a long wait, way too long for burgers. They looked so sad. A lowly burger alone on a giant plate. I had ordered cheddar on mine and I swear it was Swiss they put on it, but the waiter said it was impossible and they use white cheddar. I just didn't know what white cheddar tasted like. Well, I'm pretty sure it tastes like cheddar. But, whatever, it's just cheese. The overall sandwich had good flavor. Well seasoned beef and a buttery toasted bun. But it had too much iceberg and the meat looked to be a preformed patty. You know, the ones with the perfect sides. That bummed me out. The fries (frites) came in a paper cone propped in a crock. They looked great but tasted like an entire bottle of Lawry's was poured on them and some of them were inedible. On another occasion at Bon Vie, I had the mushroom crepes during my sad attempt at trying vegetarianism. They tasted great, but that night, made me sick. Now, they have new better sounding vegetarian options on the menu. Last night wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I reluctantly forked over $20 (incl tip) for a sad burger, salty fries, and a good vodka soda and decent service."], ["Jessica R.", "Despite our knowledge of Bon Vie's deliciousness, we had not yet been over for a second time until recently. \u00a0The first time we had visited, for my \"fancy\" birthday, we loved the brie fondue, served with apples, bread, and celery, and the chicken crepes.We finally were inspired to return, and we were not disappointed by the food at all. I ordered the fettucini bon vie, which was probably the lightest yet most well seasoned pasta dish I've had. They saute the pasta in olive oil with sundried tomatoes, asparagus, a small portion of what seemed like rotisserie chicken (it was so juicy and just melted onto my palate), and some bacon crumbles. I was impressed by how much the pasta and oil had absorbed these flavors, and the bleu cheese crumbles on top were a perfect complement.Greg had some fantastic artichoke and brie pork chops that came with a side of delicious mashed potatoes and a disappointingly raw sauteed vegetable blend of broccoli, carrots, and red onion. Greg took it in stride and still enjoyed his dinner.It was funny when the waitress came to offer dessert because we both had only been able to finish half of our respective entrees. I wish we had possessed the digestive stamina to consume one of their chocolatey delectables; rather, we asked her to box up the leftovers and bring us our bill.The dinner was a bit pricey, but a free coupon from Easton for $10 off a purchase of two entrees softened the blow (I can't afford not to be a bit tacky). The only other issue we encountered was that after we were seated (outside), it took 15 minutes for a server to address us. After the initial delay, she was an attentive server. I think our lack of attention initially was merely a miscommunication."], ["Vin R.", "For some reason, my wife loves this place. \u00a0I'll admit the Roquefort Frites are pretty tasty but nearly everything else is pretty average and can be had almost anywhere else.The kicker is we've been here at least 4 times and each time our experience has been worse than the time before. \u00a0Our first visit was fine. \u00a0My wife actually preferred this restaurant to La Chatelaine in Upper Arlington. \u00a0Then we came once with our son who was about 18 months at the time and were hustled through our meal as quickly as possible. \u00a0Our third visit was notable for the table bread arriving during our meal rather than with our drinks. \u00a0Most recently we were seated outside and as the evening turned cool we asked that a heater positioned next to our table be turned on. \u00a0Our waiter informed us that it was broken and he could turn it on but \"didn't want to blow people up.\" \u00a0Ha ha, very funny. \u00a0Rather than leaving a broken piece of equipment out for your customers, why not fix the @#$% thing?It seems with each visit, the portions get smaller, too. \u00a0The Rouquefort Frites are less and less Roquefort and more and more just plain old french fries each time.If it wasn't for my wife, I wouldn't be spending our money here."], ["Teri D.", "Perhaps we just got a harried server, perhaps it was because it was cold and we were tired and a bit lost with this having been our first time at Easton..........or maybe it really wasn't all that!We were seated and had a nice table, but as stated before - our server seemed to be either harried or just not wanting to deal much with us. \u00a0And to top it off, I noticed she took the order of another table who was seated after us before us. \u00a0I take notice of these things!!!Anyway, hubs had a Reuben - over priced and under whelming. \u00a0I had the quiche Lorraine and a mimosa. \u00a0Let me rephrase that - I had something that they charged me $6.45 for that was a bit fizzy. \u00a0The quiche wasn't too bad and the bread and butter they served was rather nice ( I so need to join carbs annon!)

Why not?With a fellow wine connoisseur in tow, I needed to see what the buzz about The Wine Bistro (TWB) was all about. The decor was surprisingly dark and uninviting -- much like the rest of the newer complex. Thankfully, our cheery server was quick to grace us with the food and extensive wine menus.Now here's where TWB falls a little flat: the food menu. I am usually wary of restaurants putting out dishes that are scattered all over the place, and this place was no exception. From the Thai chicken salad to the scallops alfredo to the curried shrimp and mango flatbread, I felt as though the menu was anything but cohesive. The food ordered confirmed my initial hunch. While I immensely enjoyed the trio of fondue, I was not impressed by the juliette flatbread. (Spagio remains stalwart at having -- hands down -- the best brie pizza in town!) The interplay amongst the ingredients listed on the menu simply did not set foot in the realm of good. The triple chocolate pot de creme, however, was a delightful closure to our meal. I'd like to think of it as melted fudge served in a cup. One would be hardpressed to polish off the aforementioned dessert alone.Vino-wise, I was slightly disappointed by the flights. From the flights of whites, I thoroughly enjoyed one of the four handpicked selections. However, my friend fared better, as he had opted for the a la carte menu instead.All in all, a-okay in my book. I blame it on my slightly overinflated expectations given the 5-star average rating here on Yelp. So, yes, I have to go against the grain on this one -- at least in terms of the food.

I'd like to start with the issues I had. 1) With all of the staff wearing 'very nice, but essentially street clothes', it was difficult to determine who was staff and who was wandering or standing around. For instance, I had no idea the hostesses were the two girls chatting at the cash register desk until they asked if I'd been helped. 2) One of our group sat without a glass until I got up to get him one and the table was similarly upprepared with silverware and plates. These things were easliy rectified and really not a problem, but noticed. 3) There was a pricing issue with ourfinal bill. It was corrected after the server verified that she, in fact, did ring it wrong. Again, just a small issue corrected with a smile. 4) The flatbread crust was way over browned, cooked to a hard cracker consistency and the color of dark brown sugar, I am pretty sure that's not typical of a flatbread. It still tasted good and toppings were well dispersed, but the toppings weren't very hot compared to the crust being so over done. Weird!OK, I'm over complaining. Here's what's awesome about The Wine Bistro. 1) Great ambiance.2) Comfortable Environment3) Attentive, friendly, knowledgable service. She was able to suggest and educate without being a know-it-all. She made the experience easy and fun. 4) Yummy Wine Service. So many wines to choose from, you can actually shop for your bottle and the cork is for you for an $8 fee Weds-Sat. Monday and Tuesday, they wave the fee.5) State minmum pricing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The pizza is good but not the best you can get. However, the appetizers and drinks are outstanding, and I have always enjoyed the ambiance and service.Let's start with the pizza. Forno advertises a very hot oven, and the toppings always come out nicely crisped, but the crust can be a little soggy, which doesn't work well with the thin crust style pizza they serve. You really notice this on your second or third slice, once the pie has started to cool. The ingredients are high quality and tasty, but the soggy crust holds back the pizza from being truly great.I have no complaints about the appetizers and drinks on the other hand. The brasato, in particular, is amazing, and all the cocktails I have ordered have been expertly mixed. Sure it's pricier than your favorite dive bar, but I think sometimes it's worth to spring for drinks that don't have the jarring clash of flavors you find in cheap specials.I do find myself wishing the menu rotated. The pizza and cocktail offerings are fairly traditional, and given how good most of the stuff is, I would be interested to see what Forno could do with some rotating novelties. I've already tried most of the dishes that interest me, and while I'm sure I'll be back because it's good, I have to rule out Forno when I am in an adventurous mood.The ambiance of Forno is also very nice.

Slightly salty - Ahi tuna tacos: tuna tasted fresh and loved the avocado cream but could have been seasoned slightly more- Chicken Alfredo pizza: super warm and comforting, with lots of cheese. Chicken itself could use more seasoning- Breakfast pizza: the pancetta made it super salty but it's not too bad if you spread out the pancetta. Loved the brussel sprouts and eggs!

We had a table by the big plate glass windows, which made for great people watching while we ate! Our waitress, Laura, was friendly and energetic, and brought us drinks and food faster than I thought possible (though we never felt rushed). I had the ahi tuna tacos, and my companions both had the chicken and waffles, which they raved about. The taco shells were these beautifully crispy wonton shells that contrasted perfectly with the smooth texture of the tuna and the zesty sauce. I only wish they'd given me more! I love brunch at Forno especially for the half-off cocktails. Both the Bloody Mary and the mimosa are delicious. Always a great time, and we really enjoyed our meal. Thanks so much!!!"], ["Arvid Y.", "I was finally able to check out Forno this past weekend. I had brunch with my mom and we both enjoyed it. First of all, the restaurant's aesthetic is top notch. Even with the bright orange colored theme, Forno still maintains a classic and luxurious ambiance, with high ceilings and large chandelier lamp shades. Another standout feature is Forno's patio. It's directly adjacent to Bakersfield's. It's small, but perfect for people-watching on a warm summer day.The brunch menu was solid. There were 9 items to choose from and you can still order from their regular menu. If you order a brunch item, you can add a mimosa/bloody Mary for an extra $4/5. We ended up ordering a bunch of things (we were hungry). \u00a0Based on the Yelp reviews, I had ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos. We also ordered the pork belly to share. For our mains, we shared the brunch brasato and the wild mushroom pizza. The food was excellent overall and portions were generous. We ordered way too much food. The tuna tacos were fresh just like everyone said, however I think my expectations were a bit too high, as I thought they were good but not great. I'm also not the biggest fan of hard shelled-tacos, so that could also be a factor. The pork belly was fried, which caught me off guard, but they were still tasty, I particularly liked the accompanying butternut squash puree and red cabbage slaw that it was served on, as its acid helped balance the fatty pork. The brunch brasato was quite a hearty dish. It consisted of braised beef with a cooked egg on-top, served with slices of bread. The combination of the pork belly dish with this brasato was just too rich. In retrospect we should have just ordered one or the other. With that said, the beef was flavorful and it's a dish I would order again to share. However, I don't think it's a good brunch entree for one person.As far as the pizza goes, it's good. But not Harvest good, in my opinion. I believe they use cornmeal in their dough, so it's a tad bit chewier and has a little more texture than the typical Neapolitan-style pizza. It's quite a good value at $12-14 for a 12 inch serving. The mushrooms were aromatic and I did not miss meat at all. Overall, Forno is a solid Short North dining option. Their prime location, classy atmosphere and good food are bound to keep bringing customers in. I'll be back soon to check out their Happy Hour."], ["Peter B.", "Big letdown. We were excited for brunch today and it turned out to be very mediocre.To begin, we had a 12:00 reservation and were not seated until 12:40...what gives? What's the point of a reservation if you aren't going to be ready for our group?Furthermore, we ordered and waited for our food for probably close to an hour. Totally lame. It came out and most of it was cold.I ordered the breakfast skillet. Again, the food was very mediocre.I don't think I'd go back for brunch or recommend it to anyone. There are tons of good options in the Short North."], ["Lindsay T.", "We came here for dinner the other night and I was impressed. We started with arancini and it was great. They have a fun drink selection and if you like fruity/sweeter drinks, I'd recommend the kiwi mule! The chicken Alfredo pizza was delicious. The crust is perfect, thick and chewy. The service was great and friendly. My only complaint was that this place is SO loud! I couldn't hear my boyfriend talking to me, and he was sitting a foot away from me. We were even seated in the room in the back, and it was still pretty loud. I know it's a popular place, but it was crazy loud. Would definitely recommend getting pizza here though!Last time we came, we tried the fresh strawberry shots. OMG they were delicious! Strawberries infused with alcohol and topped with whipped cream, can't go wrong with that!"], ["Maurice H.", "I'm glad it replace \"Two Fish\" I believe. Nice prime spot in the heart of short north. Very good drinks and bartenders know how to make them and make whatever you want.I have tried the pizza couple of time and was not disappointed. Standard brick oven pizza like. Similar to Natalie's and Figlio's in the making I believe. First time I tried the pizza it was little on the dry side with burned crispy edges but that was during the first week of opening. The 2nd time around it was perfect. It is obvious they have improved and I'm looking forward to trying food there again. Perfect atmosphere for nightlife or happy hour group outing. The bar area is very nice and trendy with an upscale feel."], ["Vin R.", "My wife snagged our kids' favorite baby sitter on late notice for a date night this evening. \u00a0I remembered bookmarking Forno on Yelp awhile ago as I was intrigued by the concept of a wood fired oven in the dining space. \u00a0The reviews on Yelp were really positive, so I made a reservation on Open Table.The initial impression was very positive--greatly helped by finding a random open parking metered spot about 50 feet from the restaurant (on a Saturday night!). \u00a0I had an Apple Manhattan and my wife had the Pink Rose. \u00a0Both drinks were great. \u00a0I don't usually care for fancy versions of the basic Manhattan, but this one was alright.For appetizers my wife had the Arancini balls and I had the Ricotta and bread. \u00a0The Arancini balls were ok. \u00a0Honestly, Gallo's version is better, but it's hard to mess up fried rice/cheese balls. \u00a0The Ricotta was very unique. \u00a0I'd never had anything quite like it before. \u00a0Sort of sweet, salty and umami tastes all over the place. \u00a0Definitely get this as your appetizer if you go.Unfortunately, the evening started to go off the rails after our apps and drinks were delivered. \u00a0We ate most of our appetizers and I finished my cocktail. \u00a0And waited for our dinner entrees. \u00a0And waited. \u00a0And then waited some more. \u00a0Our neighbor tables got their food (more on that two paragraphs down). \u00a0A server brought us a second round of Arancini balls, which was weird. \u00a0But then he realized he was at the wrong table. \u00a0So about 40 minutes into our wait we hailed our wait staff and asked about the rest of our dinner. \u00a0She went to inquire about it. \u00a0More waiting. \u00a0She returned and said our dinner was \"one minute away\". \u00a0At that point, we'd lost our patience with the process of getting my Ahi Tuna tacos and my wife's pasta out of the kitchen and onto our table. \u00a0We asked for our dinner, some carry out boxes and our check. \u00a0The most annoying part of our evening was the obsequious bar manager guy (business owner?) who kept checking on a table of ladies next to us. \u00a0It was pretty obvious that he knew his customers socially and was maybe even very good friends with them. \u00a0He made sure they had champaign at their table and even personally got them coffee when they first arrived (after us). \u00a0That's all fine and good, making sure your friends are taken care of at your restaurant. \u00a0But eating the food off their plates with your hands while standing at the table in front of other paying customers is a little much, don't you think? \u00a0Yuck.So for our dining dollar, Forno is a For Nope. \u00a0We've got better places to spend our money and time on a date night."], ["Maggie M.", "Awesome happy hour!!! I went with my girlfriends a couple of times and I got the Moscow mule and the calamari. The flatbreads are great too. I ordered the mushroom one. Also they have a delicious salmon cakes and ahi tuna tacos! The happy hour offers 1/2 off apps and shareables also half off beer, wine by the glass and some house cocktails. Definitely worth the stop. Also offer adorable strawberry Jell-O shots with whipped cream. Perfect for a girls night out or date night dessert!"], ["Jen R.", "Nice!!!!! Went there yesterday during happy hour and was super impressed. 1/2 off all draft beers, wine, and cocktails and 1/2 off their appetizers and pizzas. That makes for a very extensive selection at really great prices. My husband and I each had a Seventh Son draft and a Four String Draft, split the Wild Mushroom pizza and the calamari. Excellent draft selection and the pizza was really really fantastic. A thicker crust but still crunchy and just the right amount of cheese and sauce. Our bill was like $24. Wowza. On top of that, our bartender/server was really attentive and I enjoyed watching her mix up what looked like some pretty tasty cocktails. Also, loved the decor. Trendy but also elegant. Felt like I was in NY or LA and not Cbus. I think this might be the best happy hour in Cbus..."], ["Donna O.", "Sheer insanity to attempt dinner in the Short North during the Arnold, but Forno made it worth the effort. It is a lovely space decorated a la Short North - large, diffuse lighting, comfy seating, large backlit bar. We were seated near the front windows, perfect for people-watching. Forno has an excellent happy hour - half-price drinks, appetizers and pizzas. That's really the best reason you need to come here. The second-best reason is that the food is awesome. We ordered various appetizers to share - ahi tuna tacos, served in fried wonton shells; creamy arancini in a clean-tasting tomato sauce; and a pork belly sharable - all executed to fit the dish. Bonus points for the tacos.Our group ordered a selection of pizzas and a pasta dish (tip: the pizzas are reasonably priced. The entrees are at a much higher price point). Plenty of pizza variety and substitutions are permitted. The pizza crust was thin but chewy, able to take both the wood-firing and the heavy saucing without being either burnt or rubbery. Forno nailed it. My mushroom pizza was excellent overall. The spouse ordered the rigatoni pasta with a creamy tomato sauce, and we both thought it was as good as the pizzas.The highlight of the meal, though, was the toasted Brussels sprouts. I like to get sprouts when they're offered and - these things were magical. Like, braised in unicorn tears. We all sampled, and we all put our hands to our mouths at the first taste. MAGIC. So, unicorn tears are made of browned butter, shallots, garlic and chicken stock, according to the kitchen staff at Forno. Just so you know.Although it was a super-busy weekend, Forno has managed to corral their spaces with artfully-hung sheer drapes to keep the bar noise and crowd in the main bar area, so the larger dining room was much quieter, a dull roar. Our server was attentive and we got all of our food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Staff were visible and we were greeted on the way in and the way out. Great job, Forno, for bringing this to the Short North."], ["Amanda G.", "Forno's saving grace was the pizza. It was pretty good. I like the brick oven pies, they've got great texture that you just don't get with other pizzas.I'm giving them two stars because the whole experience was just kind of sloppy. I don't know if it was our waitress's first day or what, but she spilled water on our table, forgot our drink order and then our salads came out before our drinks. It also bugged me that we had a reservation for the patio and then told we'd have to wait for a seat out there even though there was a cleared table available - we could see it through the window.The salad we ordered a Ceasar salad that barely hard any flavor - I don't think they make their dressing in-house and the campari tomatoes were pretty useless. Like I said, the pizza was good, lot's of fresh basil on the Margherita which was nice.I don't think I'll be back nor would I recommend this place."], ["Matt G.", "Great Brunch!We went here for their grand opening of Brunch and it was better than expected (And that's not the mimosas talking)! The service was quick even when it got busier. The menu had a wide array of Brunch specialties. I went with the simple, yet classic, biscuits and gravy. They put a delectable, gourmet spin on it!Everything was alil on the higher price side, BUT totally worth it. I'd say you'd leave this place spending $18-$20/person for Brunch.For all you Brunch connoisseurs, this is definitely worth a stop!"], ["Sab S.", "I swear this corner is jinxed so I'm really hoping Forno is a winner/in for the long haul but I've gone there twice this week and it's a complete toss up of how it will survive in the Short North..

Pretty cool decor, love the pizza oven and open kitchen concept. The drinks are on point and the wine flights are an amazing value! \u00a0Really loved the music too!! Lots of throwback jams that make you want to dance!Pizza, SALMON omg, ahi tuna tacos, calamari, Forno burger were all delish!!! Food came out quickly and all meals were served together even though they said the pizza oven was backed up. \u00a0We made substitutions to a few things but everything was good. I do like the food.CONS: \u00a0on both visits the hostess stand was a complete nightmare!!!! Poorly greeted both times. \u00a0The girl (who likes flashing everyone while bussing tables / bending over in a barely there skirt) is sooo rude. Sorry this is Cbus not NYC. We waited 20 minutes *after* our reservation time only to be offered a BAR Table for dinner which really should only be used for those without reservations. When we said we wanted dining room, it took an additional 25 minutes with NO APOLOGY. \u00a0So we waited a total \u00a0of 45 minutes post reservation/arrival. \u00a0That crap can't last - it's a huge dissatisfier!!! The same hostess had bedroom slippers on with her dress by 9:30 PM - oh come on! This isn't your kitchen at home, it's a restaurant.The service is also lacking. On Wednesday night our server stalked our table so hard that I felt uncomfortable. He literally kept coming by and taking stuff away each time, looking over at us, taking our checks before we got up (that happened Friday too). Just very rushed and annoying. \u00a0Even though the flights were a great value, I think we got bad bottles of wine. I've never seen so much sediment in an empty glass before!! The italian red flight was delish but again I wish I didn't get all the sediment :-(Overall I would recommend giving it at least two chances because not sure they will get it right on your first visit."], ["Michael C.", "While this isn't four star food, per se, it's a four star experience: The food is delicious, the environment is energetic and enjoyable, the service is terrific, and I've never had anything other than a great time at this establishment.

Helpful, knowledgable, attentive, clean. They seemed to care. Atmosphere: new, busy, clean, open, maybe a bit trendy, funMisc: everything was great, but if you're a big dessert person, it may not be for you.

I ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. Which was good, but a bit blander than I expected. But honestly it's big enough to be a dinner. I sampled my friends aracini, which normally I don't like but these were the perfect size allowing for a perfect crust to risotto ratio.I tried the shrimp pizza, phenomenal! Get this! Best idea ever!Tried to hummus, olive, and mushroom platter. Much bigger than we expected and very good. The same goes for the calamari, bigger portion and very good. Drinks came out promptly, lots of good looking drinks, I had the strawberry rose. I asked for a wimpy girly drink and it was tasty and girly. But myself and my other friend who ordered it both felt buzzed half way through. So beware! It's stronger than it tastes!Checks were split up without us asking and promptly taken care of.

My friend and I both had time to walk two blocks to our respective meters before we were even asked about drinks.The food: We decided to share a Four Cheese Pizza, which arrived very timely. I do not understand the small, oval shaped plates they have at the tables. They are not conducive for eating pizza. The actual pizza was VERY DELICIOUS and I would definitely return.Besides the wait, in future visits I would hope they would give the option to sit outside or indoors, and if they are going to show sports talk shows on the television, at least turn on the closed captioning so we can actually know what's going on. Kinda seemed like a waste of electricity.Overall, good pizza and drinks, decent service. I'll likely return in the future."], ["Matthew S.", "Drinks were pretty good, but buyer beware. None of the cooks wear gloves. Even the chef licked his fingers and went to grab a piece of ciabatta, all ready to eat to foods need to be handled with protective hand wear.

If anything this spot would be ideal for grabbing some cocktails. As for the food, I ordered the Caprese sandwich with the glazed vegetables on the side. The sandwich was good, nothing amazing, but also not disappointing. I was expecting more of a panini type of sandwich but it turned out to be a cold version, but still tastey. As for thee side vegetables, they were AMAZING!! delicious. I probably would not go and order the sandwich again, and try the pizza next time, but as for the sides I am impressed!"], ["Roberta L.", "We had multiple recommendations to give Forno a try. We had reservations at 8:30 and waited quite some time to get seated even though there were two hosts. Upon sitting we were pretty much given the worst table in the place.. I guess reservations weeks in advance are taken lightly. The decor didn't quite make sense, mixing wood accent walls to a color changing spot light. Our server was a sweet girl and very helpful when it came to ordered both cocktails (kiwi mule is a must) and dinner (shrimp apps), but all in all it was a very slow service and almost seemed inattentive at times.

With an open mind, and post-happy hour hunger, it was nice to be seated immediately on a Friday night. The atmosphere (aside from those light fixtures that look like they are oversized granny lamps from IKEA) was nice, and they have a bar area with a different vibe than the main eating area. This is a place that balances a nice aesthetic with welcoming environment. And of course the corner view is perfect for people-watching. My server was friendly and helpful. She was honest about portion sizes and didn't try to oversell, which is always appreciated. My cocktail was really good, holding its own with ones I frequently get at Lindey's, Mouton, Curio, etc. Now to the salad: the Italian salad was bland, toppings were sparse, and at $9, it was overpriced. Marcella's is by no means the standard-bearer for Italian food, but I always get the same side salad there (antipasto) and it is much better and $1.50 cheaper. This was a total fail. Finally, the pizza arrived. It looked delicious. My friend took a couple of bites before I did, and he managed to ruin the experience with one comment: \"Tell me that doesn't taste like Chef Boyardee pizza from our childhood!\" Dinner. Ruined. Why? Because although it's been 30 years since I last had it, I instantly tasted exactly what he meant. Although I would not be so obnoxious as to say it was as bad as Chef Boyardee, it reminded me of it A LOT, and it was simply mediocre. At some point, I didn't even mind that about 1/3 to 1/4 of it barely had sauce. They want to be crust-heavy, fine. What really boggles my mind is that this is a place that specializes in pizza. And I love pizza. But one can go down the street, to Rossi, a place that has a diverse menu (i.e. not explicitly Italian or with a massive pizza oven as a focal point), and get pizza that is notably better than this. \u00a0Later in the evening, when walking past the Mikey's pizza truck, my friend said he was tempted to get a slice just to offset his pizza disappointment. \u00a0I definitely have plans to check out this place at at happy hour, and I'll try dinner again.

The crust acts only as a vessel for the toppings; it has a good taste to it, but nothing which stands out. The outside crust has a nice fluffy crispness which cleanses the palate for the next slice. The capicola and pepperoni stand out the most to me. They really give this pizza it's distinct taste. The sausage was the weak spot. Herb and cheese mix is great.

I no longer live in Columbus but decided to give it a try during my recent visit. I noticed the prices went up but I had to get my hands on a Thurman Burger. I placed an order for to go. When I got there I also noticed they expanded a little and added a to go space right next door. The fresh cut fries delicious! But my burger I was a little disappointed. Burger a little dry but the juices made my bun super soggy. The soggy bun really ruined my experience. The massive burger was too much for me to eat, maybe I'll dine in next time and try a different burger."], ["Rami M.", "The Thurman Cafe wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, either. \u00a0I certainly enjoyed my burger, but I didn't find it remarkable. \u00a0It was definitely huge (as are the wings- they're huge!)- so make sure you have an appetite. \u00a0The service was great, and I went during lunch on a weekday so there was no wait."], ["David G.", "Great burgers - Columbus staple.Staff will treat you like family, they've worked there forever together and it shows.If you get the chance, don't miss this jewel!Hold on to your hat, these burgers are seriously delicious - come hungryPrepare to wait in line - worth it!"], ["Aaron C.", "If you want a burger high this is the place to get one.

There, I said it. Their food is gimmicky. Like, here's the biggest burger you've ever seen and let us put a million things on it to make it seem amazing but really it's just a giant, flavorless patty of meat. I just feel like that much food is a little gross. HOWEVER, I feel like everyone should go once just because it is a Columbus staple restaurant. They really do cook the burgers well. I just would like to taste more than ground beef. I enjoy all my toppings too.I'm a plain Jane. I like a cheeseburger with American cheese and lettuce, tomato, onion. That's it. That's what I got this weekend and it was fine. Not great. Fine. Maybe that's my problem in that I don't order one of their other special burgers. We got seated within 20 minutes but it took 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. All the servers share tables so we don't have one specific person. That's nice but annoying when you have 10 different people ask you if you want a refill and interrupt your conversations.Prices are fine, atmosphere is fine except that their waiting area would double the size of their restaurant if they took out all the nonsense like video games to occupy your time while you wait. So yeah, expect to wait about an hour at least during prime times at Thurman's. Anyway, I sound like a hater and I don't mean to be but I'm just not sold on this place. I like it but wouldn't wait 2 hours for a gigantic hamburger. There are just other places that have better burgers in Columbus. Give me Ringside any day."], ["Maricar G.", "I was stoked to try this place but left a little disappointed. This super divey but popular place is known to get packed so we headed to this place on a Friday afternoon at 2pm. We were sat promptly. You don't get an assigned waiter/waitress everyone just sort of helps each other out which is nice. Since I'm from out of town I wanted the full on experience and split the Thurmanator with my BF. This was like 2lbs of meat. We ordered it medium rare but it came out medium. They were cool with taking the slab of meat back and returned with the pink middle we wanted. Jesus this burger was a massive undertaking. Made for some fun pics. Held together with at least 5 toothpicks so this tower does not topple over. I ended up eating it like a meat salad. Just under the top bun was a layer of ham and cheese which actually tasted pretty good on its own too! Pickles and fries accompanied this little beast. I think their gimmick is the big ass burger. For the actual food itself I didn't think it was legendary in taste. We walked here so didn't have to worry about parking luckily but for you car people looks like parking is scarce and may need do a little walking. Bathrooms were a little dirty FYI"], ["Mironda R.", "If I lived in Columbus, this would be in regular rotation. This is definitely says local bar with flair. They call it a cafe, but it's more bar than cafe. It has a separate area in the front for the wait (it can be upwards of forever) with a couple of arcade games and a super fancy jukebox machine.My colleague and I sat at the bar and our multi-tasking bartender/waitress was friendly and attentive. The menu was OVERWHELMINGLY delicious. Yes, they are known for their burgers, but they have a few other things. Me being the person I am.. I asked.. can I have THAT burger combo, but with grilled chicken?! To my surprise they said yep no problem. I am in LOVE. I opted for the Hot & Spicy Salsa Burger (re: Chicken). It was open faced, served on texas toast, topped with mozzarella and our homemade hot, hot, hot salsa on a bed of lettuce with a side of sour cream. It wasn't that hot, but it was pretty tasty! But my favorite this time around was the fries.. yea.. I said fries.. We had the ThurmaGoldiGarlaLina - garlic wing sauce infused with Carolina Gold and bleu cheese dressing. This things were crazy good. Oh my goodness!Totally a fatty-fat-fat kinda day, but would totally be worth it!"], ["Dennis L.", "Knowing my appetite for stupid amounts of food, my co-workers took me here as a send-off for my new life in Minnesota. The Thurmanator is obviously their legendary burger but even I was worried about my ability to devour such a beat - and no one likes leftover burger the day after. Therefore I settled on The Thurman Burger, which is a slightly less imposing dish but nearly as disastrous for your cholesterol. Whatever ingredients you can think of for burgers is here, on top of a 3/4 lb patty and surrounded by potato chips. They really should give you a bib for such a meal because it gets messy quickly. I highly recommend this as a once-off selection to say you've done it, but I'm not sure the novelty of the size is worth a repeat as it was an otherwise typical tasting burger (mine got well-doned rather than medium-rare). 3-stars for the ridiculously long wait (1+ hours) just to be seated and equally long wait to be served. Their kitchen just simply cannot keep up, but perhaps this deserves a pass because of the sheet amount of ingredients in each burger."], ["Mary Margaret M.", "Bottom line:Go for the divey bar experience with dollar bills on the walls and order the biggest cheeseburger you have ever seen in you entire life and order a PBR tallboy while you are at it. To avoid the wait don't go at peak dinner time on the weekends.**The atmosphere**If you want a burger and fries in a place that has real \"character,\" this is your place. If you go for dinner on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait--a while. The place isn't all that big. The decor theme is: bumper stickers galore, old-fashioned beer themed stained glass light fixtures, an abundant number of neon beer signs with license plates & dollar bills on the walls. It's got a \"maybe I should order a PBR tallboy\" kinda vibe. It's really nothing fancy, but the \"character\" is off the charts. **The food**They are known for their GINORMOUS burgers. The burgers are good, but more so a sight to see. They have tasty burgers, not the best I've ever had, but certainly place a worthy mention. Most of the things on the menu are fried. If your counting calories, this probably shouldn't be the place to go. They have all the typical American fare: jalapeno poppers, mini corn dogs, fried mushrooms, cheese sticks, onion rings, wings, salad, subs, pizza, gyros..you get the drift. There's something for everyone.They have some good fries called \"Macedonian fries.\" They are fries topped with feta cheese, onions, banana peppers and a vinaigrette dressing. They are tasty; I'd order them again.**The service**Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He was prompt with asking how we are doing and we always had a full glass of ice water--much appreciated."], ["George D.", "One of the best burgers I have ever had anywhere.

Huge burgers that come in multiple delicious varieties for a reasonable price (considering the amount of food you get), quirky interior, and friendly staff all combine to make this restaurant a winner in my book. I would come here every month if I could, but alas, they are soooooo busy. Part of the problem is that they only have seating for like 20 or 30 people, but it's also a testament to how popular their burgers are. So I get to come here maybe once a year, when I'm off work on a weekday and I can come at 11am to beat the lunch crowd. Who knows, it's probably better for my heart health that I'm not eating a Thurman burger every month! Since I hate crowds and I hate waiting, I can only give The Thurman Cafe 4 stars. If it wasn't so insanely busy all the time, I'd have given them 5 stars."], ["Claire D.", "After hearing about the \"Thurminator\" for months, I finally took the plunge and visited Thurman's this past weekend. I went with a friend at around 7pm on a Sunday night and we were seated right away, although the wait for tables of 4+ people was 1 hour and 15 minutes.For our appetizer, we got the fried burrito bites, which came with onion-chipotle sour cream to dip them in. I wasn't a huge fan of these. They tasted like canned refried beans and cream cheese mixed together, battered, and then fried. You'd think it'd be hard to mess up taking a mini burrito and deep frying it, but Thurman's did. I would definitely not order them again.My friend and I split the cowboy burger. Oh man that thing was massive! All burgers at Thurman's come with 3/4 lbs beef patty, which is kind of overwhelming and overpowers the other flavors in the burger (all you can taste is ground beef!). The cowboy came with cheddar cheese, barbecue sauce, and bacon, as well as fries and a pickle on the side. I enjoyed the good, standard dive-style toppings on my burger. Thurman's did an excellent job of making crispy bacon.I was pretty full by the end of the meal, despite splitting an appetizer and one hamburger between 2 people. With tip, I think the meal was around $25, so not really what I'd call a good deal, but not a huge rip off either.

Though I think it is very worth the wait. The service can be a bit slow, but that is only because it is always crazy busy and they make nearly everything from scratch. The bar has a good amount of liquor, few craft beers but mostly the classic brews. The burgers are large and more than enough for 2.

It will satiate even the biggest of appetites and its tastiness will leave you wanting more. It's no wonder that Thurman Caf\u00e9 has been featured so often in food television programs. I was not brave enough to attempt the Thurmanator. It consists of two 3/4 pound beef patties, ham, bacon, covered in mozzarella, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, sauteed onions, pickles, jalapeno peppers and mayo. Maybe it's possible to finish if shared between two, however it's definitely a Man vs. Food challenge if attempted solo. My buddy attempted the challenge, but failed gloriously. However, he did enjoy the burger enough to take the leftovers home. I ordered the Western Burger and loved it. It consisted of bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The burger patty itself was the star. It was perfectly cooked to order, melt in your mouth juicy with tons of flavor. The thickness of the burger makes it diffcult to eat, but the messy aftermath is completely worth it. The burgers come with some crispy thick cut french fries. I'm not a huge fan of the fries here. They are overseasoned and a bit too salty. We also ordered some Thurman Cordon Blue Balls, which are fried doughballs with ham and Swiss cheese. Simple, but not a bad snack.If you like burgers, then you should definitely check out The Thurman Caf\u00e9!"], ["Sarah B.", "Such a cool lil place. All we wanted was to find corn dogs.

The burger itself was average. The burger is huge and I cant complain about the portion size. I wish Thurmans didn't look for so many ways to save money either.

I started out with a Four String IPA which was really good. For my meal I ended up deciding on the Bacon Cheddar Ranch burger and substituted the onion strings for regular fries.

Also at our table was the Thurman Burger with a big portion of sliced ham on it, and the veggie sub, which was the biggest sub I've ever seen (look at the photos to see all 3 sandwiches). Most of the sandwiches came with chips, so we ordered a basket of fries to share. Not sure we ate one. Just too much food. One of the meals came with onion straws that were very good. On the bar seen, they have a very good bar with some of my favorite bourbons. About 30 beers in cans or bottles, and another 8 or so on tap, including Great Lakes. Service was very attentive.

I came here summer 2013 for the first time, ordered the Thurmantor, then realized too late that it could probably feed a small village. Half a burger doesn't do well as leftovers, so do yourself a favor and ask your server how large they'll actually be. Last time, I tried just the Thurman Burger, which I could split comfortably with my boyfriend. Both are delicious, but with 3/4 lb. of beef per order, I choose them for the quantity over quality.

This place is obviously a staple in German Village, but it's also one of those places that is just really over-hyped (in my opinion, obviously).If you go during a prime-grubbing time, you're sure to have to wait for a seat. But if you are looking for some late night eats (to soak up the booze, perhaps) then Thurman's will usually get you in and out pretty quickly. That's pretty much the only time I go. And I'll echo what hunderds have said: the burgers are large. Also very sloppy. I'd say just keep it simple, but that's me.If you've never been, it's worth a stop, but I don't qualify it as a \"must-try\"."], ["Bridget O.", "Ok...so way over hyped.

Pony tail dude was the worst part of the experience.The burgers were not bad, but I couldn't help but think what must the kitchen look like If the dining area was this gross?! My family and I were always polite when drinks and food were order and served, however not once did our infamous waiter reciprocate any kind words or gestures. We discussed leaving a $0 tip, something we have never done before after finishing our food and waiting 10 minutes for a check. Fortunately a new waitress came up to us and noticed empty plates and cups, she politely asked if we wanted the check and anything else, and even apologized for us having to wait, even though the wait was nothing to do with her.She brought the check, thanked us for coming and is the main reason we have given 2 starts instead of one.

The Thurmanator is ginormous, but the other burgers in the menu are also of very large size. They have a smaller version (5 oz) that you can order to take-out next door. Tip: if you are okay with carry out and don't want or wait in a long line, head next door or call ahead to get your meal to go. I went in and order carry out with a group, and they would have been very efficient (less than 20 min wait) had they not forgotten one of our orders.

These burgers are HUGE and will leave you stuffed.However... this place is very:OverhypedThere. I said it. Many a Columbusite has told me that this is the best place to get a burger in Columbus and I agree. BUT my biggest reasons for removing two stars are the small size of the restaurant, difficulty of parking, price, lack of customization, and the low quality of the buns that are served here.I think that this restaurant could become even better than it is now by possibly experimenting with their patties to make them less tough (literally like a steak) as well as offering more customization in the way of bun choices and toppings (except not charging $1.50 for a fried egg hence price).Overall good burger, but there is multitude of factors in which why I must remove stars."], ["Bre H.", "While visiting Columbus, I always seem to stumble into the same places around campus. I've never gone downtown to eat anywhere besides Short North. That is until I tried Thurman's Cafe. We headed to Thurman's for lunch on a Tuesday so we got seated and orders taken nearly right away. Our order took a little while, but we understood when the burgers that were the size of my head came out. They are most famous for their Thurmanator, a $20 huge burger that only the bravest try. The guy at the table behind us ordered it so we got to see first hand just how big this burger was. I wasn't feeling a clogged artery, at least not today so I skipped that one.I ordered the Jack Cheese Burger. It came with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I also added jalepeno peppers for a small extra charge because I love them! I liked it a lot! Burgers also come with fries.A very good burger & endless refills on the soda! What I enjoyed most about this place was the theme.

Especially better is on sat or sun afternoon when the earth-toned, wooden rooms become more traditional pub, a neighborhood tavern than a university coed bash and binge. The difference is an extra star. For the new: Arch City is named after an attempt by the city to give itself a nickname--trying to brand itself after the black arches looping over High Street, facsimiles of historic ones that once gas-lit Civil War vets on reunion and later supported trolley lines. The black arching fixtures in the bar are a nice touch, as well as the murals and wooden interior that gives homage to the cities and neighborhoods history. As with all g-pubs Arch has a fabulous beer selection. Crafts, imports, novel tastes, the works. Service here is great, and the environment is friendly, soft, and fun. It is a great place to catch a game, or meet a friend to visit, at least during happy hours. For food it is good, but doesn't stand out among its neighbors, except for one item that I love--lobster mac&cheese. It's chewy, flavorful, and has as fresh lobster can get in Ohio. Highly recommend ( unless you are from Boston then nevermind.) As said, a nice place for an afternoon stop, during a crawl. For students, weekend nights are fun for a meet, drink, and hang-out."], ["Belynda H.", "So I thought this place was pretty good. The ambiance impressed me more than the food. When I first arrived to the location, it was still daylight and we sat next to the open window area, which was really nice. It also attracted individuals walking along the street to stop by and ask if you wanted to by things they were selling. Nonetheless, when it grew darker the closed the window and it seem to transform this quant little bar into a seductive restaurant. I had the grilled wings which were very tasty. They also have just a little spice to them. I love spicy food so it was a plus for me. So the corn dogs were ok to me but my boyfriend seemed to love them. They were made with kielbasa sausage and they seem to have made their own crispy breading which was served On top ofSome sort of horseradish mustard. I also ordered truffle wings which were not good as all to me.I give this place three stars due to the fact that the wings were excellent but the back area smelled horrible. At the end of my visit I decided to go to the restroom. The restroom itself smelled fine but you have to walk past through a hallway past the and some sort of storage room and it smelled horrible.I will no longer go to this location. I did not like that, and if I had of went to the bathroom first I would have not eaten there."], ["Amanda W.", "What an awesome place for bar food!!! Highly recommend for a late night hangout (food, drinks, or a combo). Lots of beer options, though I went with a margarita, which was an interesting twist.

Also a must try; very flavorful and not overly 'lamb' taste. French onion soup - loved this too! Unique to them, the soup was served in a huge \u00a0halved onion.Carnitas tacos - I wasn't that impressed, but the two guys I went with loved them.

Actually, I may have had the food once, but it wasn't memorable, so we'll pretend this was my first time. We actually walked in here on Red, White, and Boom as the fireworks were going on and were the only people at the bar. How convenient. The bartenders were very nice, and I ended up grabbing a beer from the decent draft selection. For dinner, my girlfriend ended up getting the Fig pizza and I tried the bison burger with blue cheese and whatever else was on it. This was a special tonight, so you won't find it on the menu. The food was out quick, and the burger appeared to be cooked medium like I asked, but that was the only good thing about that dish for me. It was so incredibly dry, and the blue cheese definitely didn't help that I couldn't even finish it, and that almost never happens. I barely got about halfway done before I had to give up. I don't like saying anything, but the bartender noticed that I wasn't a fan, and comped me a drink. Thanks! The Parmesan fries that was came with it were okay, but I wasn't amazed by them.The fig pizza was definitely better than the burger, and my girlfriend seemed to enjoy. To me, it was also a bit dry, and that may be due to the heavy amount of arugula on it. I felt like a rabbit.By the time we were done eating, the fireworks were over, and the place was packed again. I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here, especially with how busy it can get, but if I wind up here again, I'd give it a second chance.

One whole wall is a mural tribute to old Columbus, and at least one rafter/beam I saw was a miniature scale version of one of the arches you can find right outside the doors. Lots of great natural wood, great tones and colors, and a very sleek and fluid feel that showcases the length/depth of the space. The huge wall of windows is a great improvement over the former occupant (Havana). The second selling point was probably our talkative server who sat and chatted with my friend and I about music and festivals while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. For whatever reason, they yanked her and had some dude who was far less attentive serve us. He had a table of ladies sitting right beside us. Wonder why he wasn't as interested in taking care of the eight top full of guys? They also made no announcement to us that they were switching servers on us. He just came out of nowhere and she was never seen again (although she was waiting on a table two down from us). Actually, I'm lowering a star for how that was handled and the drop in the level of service that resulted. The beer selection was decent, the happy hour is unimpressive though. We only ordered a handful of pies to share amongst the table. We had the margherita and the mediterranean. They were solid, but nothing out of this world. I would return to sample some more of the menu and maybe sit at the bar, but I don't see this becoming a regular destination on my calendar.Addendum: Nearly forgot, despite it being seat yourself (at least at the time we arrived), the manager or owner came over and asked us to move to another table after we sat, informing us that the table we had selected was reserved for a party. Maybe you should have put a sign on it. As it was, our eight top was squished around a six top table. Poor form.

From when you first walk in and see the mural on the wall and the exposed brick you can tell what kind of place this is. The restaurant was pretty busy for a Wednesday night but the tables are nicely spaced so you don't feel like you're in somebodys way. They had a great draft list and their happy hour deals are really good, half off beer, wine, and pizzas. Like many other Short North restaurants their front windows can open, which makes for a nice breezy feeling, if I had one complaint it would be that at times the passing traffic was too loud.So my wife and I both had the lamb shank sliders and the truffle fries, and our friends had a fig pizza and a mediterranean pizza and a french onion soup. The lamb shank sliders weren't dry like another reviewer mentioned, they were very tender and juicy and flavors of the goat cheese and aioli really came together. Truffle fries are thinner than you are used to seeing in these types of places, that's not to their detriment though. The fries were crispy and not greasy or heavy. The pizzas looked delicious and the bite I had of the fig pizza had me questioning my order. The onion soup came out in a hollowed out onion and also looked delicious.Waitstaff was quick and attentive and knew the menu well. They leave a large water on the table which I like, it keeps me from having to flag someone down everytime I run out. Prices were very fair for the quality and amount of food we had.

It's a nice, warm, vibe and display.Haven't tried the food, but this is the kind of place I'd come for after-dinner drinks.

It was too much, to the point where I kinda scraped a bit of it off.2) Seoul Dog with kimchi, mayo, and sriracha - after trying this, I wasn't convinced that kimchi and hot dogs is a good pairing3) Deluxe Taters with meat coney island sauce, jalapenos, tomatoes, and onion - my favorite part of my order (wasn't any of the dogs), but they could be more generous with the coney island sauce aka chiliOverall, I was unimpressed by the food. I also tried some of the dogs that my bf ordered, but I don't remember what they were and they didn't stand out to me. I've been to Hot Doug's in Chicago, which is a place that many people would compare Dirty Frank's to, but I don't think they compare since Hot Doug's menu is so much more creative.

This is a very eclectic city and it's a very quirky, eclectic eating spot. My first visit here was less than extraordinary and I figured I'd give it a second shot. Unfortunately, maybe I should've kept my visit at one try. To begin with, the place is very, very, very small. And for a place that has gained in popularity like it has that always poses a problem because there is always at least a 20 minute wait. And for me the taste of the food doesn't justify the wait. No I will give them credit, there are some exciting combinations that they have on their hotdogs that you would never think of in 1 million years. But it has been my experience that a lot of the flavor is gone or lacking from their food. Maybe it's just the softener in me, but the food just has no seasoning. And for me, that's a dealbreaker. If you'd like to go just to say that you had a chance to visit Dirty Frank's, then by all means make your way down town.

I had the real man. My friend got the Ohioana&columbus crew dog. You know, team spirit. It was delicious!!!! There are five condiments available. The interior has an alternative decor feel. The noise level is not ridiculous. You don't have to shout to have a conversation. The service is fast & the staff are nice. I did not use the restroom. But my friend gives it a 4/5. He also says the bar has a limited selection, from pbr to mccallan scotch--but more than enough to do the job. The forte is definitely their franks. Delish.

I've had the best service at the bar. As far as drinks go, I highly recommend doing the 'Pick Your Poison' for $4 with whiskey in your root beer.

Soda is almost the same price as hot dogs (in a positive way, not negative).The nicola was very good. I'm surprised that combination of greek sauce and hot dog actually worked. The fried leeks was just OK for me, mostly because I felt like it was very greasy and will give you terrible breath afterwards (not that a hot dog wouldn't). It's a nice idea but just not for me.

Its not particularly tasty and is on par with what you could get at a food truck or street stand. They say its Vienna all beef dogs, so I'll take them at their word. Where they excel is in their toppings, which surpass all others in sheer selection, creativity, and quality. For example, the Slappy Pappy includes bacon, cheddar, sour cream, and french fries. Or the Zippity Zam, with the sriracha and red peppers. The poppyseed buns add uniqueness to an already impressive hotdog.On a Friday or Saturday night this place gets BUSY. Some of it is spillover from the very popular 16-bit bar next door, but people in Columbus looking for hotdogs seem to come to Frank's.

It is an impressive plate of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes and fried onions reaching almost half a foot in height.Taste-wise however, I found the dish to be lacking. To be honest, I think I prefer Boston Market meatloaf. Especially for $17.50, I was expecting some sort of twist on the classic or at least more flavor. I found the BBQ gravy to be a little bland and overly sweet. My favorite part of the dish was probably the mashed potatoes. I could also do without the broccoli.My buddy ordered the pork dish and said it was excellent. Judging from other reviews, that's also another popular dish at Cap City Diner.

It's large enough that you get a nice diversity of flavors and prices, but not so large that you become overwhelmed. I chose the steak noodle salad, which was more of a noodle dish with some greenery instead of a salad. This was fine by me, as it was actually quite filling. The portions here are substantial- 4/6 people took something home with them. To be fair, part of this is because we were saving room for dessert, but I'll get to that in a sec. My mom and sister both had the salmon with rice and veggies dish, and it was SO GOOD. I tried a bite and it had this tangy sauce drizzled on it that almost made me hijack my mom's plate. My blackberry bramble drink was strong and just the right amount of sweet. I was told by my parents to save room for their creme brulee, and I was so glad I did!

I visited from NYC on Friday, and my parents were excited to take me to this restaurant. With CM's name on it, they assumed it would be fantastic. I did, too, having enjoyed his restaurant in the Renaissance downtown in 2007. Either the mighty have fallen or are happy to slap their name on any old slop. My dad and I both agreed that the Southern fried chicken sounded great, so we ordered that. I was expecting something that matched the description. What I got was two dry pieces of paillard-style chicken - cheap cuts pounded very thinly and coated in something soggy and slightly sweet. This disappointment was accompanied by mac and cheese (which wasn't macaroni at all, but cavatappi), which I wasn't told was garlic mac and cheese. Avoid it if you're not a fan of inhaling entire bulbs of garlic. The mashed potatoes were some disturbing substance that seemed to come from a powder. It had none of the flavor or texture of actual mashed potatoes. A pale gravy with skin already formed on top was supposed to entice, I guess. It failed.Thing is, living in New York, I've frequented a fair number of diners and a fair number of fine dining establishments. Cap City Diner doesn't even rate in comparison with the greasy spoons in the average NYC neighborhood. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to call this a \"fine\" diner. Either somebody doesn't care about quality or is truly deluded as to how awful this is. One thing's for sure: The manager couldn't be bothered to take care of customers. He hung out with a couple of regulars the whole time, never checking on tables to see if people enjoyed their food or otherwise attending to the restaurant. Seems like he had his hands full hanging out and shooting the breeze.I feel sorry for the waitstaff here, because inevitably they are the ones who have to deal with the disappointment of customers. They didn't cook the food or make the \"fine\" diner promises, but they bear the brunt of the consequences as the restaurant fails on every count.

It's a standard done well. It's meaty and juicy. The balsamic roasted chicken is an upscale version of your basic roasted chicken. Very yummy.The spicy chicken rigatoni has a spicy cream sauce with just the right amount of heat.

For my dinner, I got the crabcake sandwich, which was on an English muffin and the waitress allowed me to subsitute in garlic and chive mashed potatoes as my side. The crabcake was definitely made fresh because of the way it fell apart when I bit into it and the crabmeat was soo good. The mashed potatoes also were very fresh and had a nice, potatoey texture and a tasty, but light flavor. My boyfriend got the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, which I had a bite of, and it was very very good.. especially that horseradish sauce that it came with.. sooo so good. Despite how stuffed we were, we had eyeballed the Big Ol' Cup of Chocolate, \u00a0which was chocolate lava cake baked inside a mug and topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream, and a pirouette. This was absolutely delicious and was not in the slightest too sweet or rich, \u00a0which was what I was a bit afraid of.I feel like this place would be one of those where you could order anything and it would be pretty good and I'll definitely come back again whenever the opportunity arises."], ["Drew Z.", "This is a staple in the family rotation for birthday/anniversary dinners. The menu has a wide variety of options from good sandwiches to diverse entrees. The meatloaf is always and excellent option (if you're not up for the full portion entree, the meatloaf melt is also great). At times, the service can be slow. During our last visit, we had multiple people at our table ask for ketchup several times before it was actually brought, and refills of water never came. Thankfully this isn't something that happens every time (or I'd stop going). In the end, it's a great diner environment for family dinners and the menu has the potential to satisfy anyone's cravings for that day."], ["Sara M.", "Excellent service and food.

We watched plates go by with the flat bread pizza, the calimari and the chips covered with blue cheese and vowed to come back to try them all.

Best part - starting off the meal with warm cinnamon rolls, fresh out of the oven. I order their iced tea, which is fresh-brewed and never runs dry or without enough ice. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari - exquisite with an amazing sweet chili sauce. For the main course, I ordered the chop salad, but substituted shrimp for chicken - very large, well-seasoned shrimp. Also, they have the cleanest and cutest restrooms with mouthwash and other amenities available. Finally, the retro furnishings and art makes for a fun/cool atmosphere. Overall, beautiful presentation and attentive waiter. You get what you pay for, but it is worth it 100%."], ["H J.", "Cap City is a short walk from the Spring Hill Marriott.

Seriously amazing!I have never been a fan of fresh water fish. THIS changed everything!The meatloaf and Parmesan Chicken tied for 2nd place and were both amazing as well. They easily deserve to be in anyone's 1st place.The Pot Roast (thurs night special) got 3rd place. Honestly, it kicked butt, but the others are just kickin' butt harder!Last, to my surprise was the pork chop. All recommended it. Personally, the candied walnuts were WAY too sweet for me, and the meat was a bit dry. I suspect it is normally great, I just got one a bit over done.The tomato soup is superb. Perfect blend of acidity and sweetnessThe wedge salad also kicked butt. The blue cheese dressing was perfect!On my last night, Gabby surprised me with a huge piece of chocolate cake!Be warned. If you are trying to watch your weight.... Stay far away from this cake. It is AMAZING! I travel constantly, I can honestly say this was one of the best eateries I have encountered. So much so, that I saw no need to explore any further for this trip. It was close to my hotel, and offered enough variety to engage me.I did go to Cameron Mitchell's Steakhouse last visit. That was superb.When I return to Columbus, I will be back to Cap City!"], ["Melissa V.", "Slim pickings for vegetarians. Unless you want meat meat meat, don't bother.

They have great seasonal cocktails. The food always comes out fast and the staff is very attentive to their diners. Try the Maytag Blue Cheese chips as an appetizer! They also have a good brunch menu. Reservations are a must on weekends and evenings, otherwise you will wait a little bit because they are always busy. They also have a gluten-free menu. My wife's cousin was visiting and has a gluten allergy. She was able to choose from a nice selection of gluten-free items."], ["Curt P.", "This was actually my second visit to Cap City and I wasn't really excited prior to arriving or looking at the menu, but I was pleasantly surprised by the experience and by the end of our stay it had me thinking why we hadn't been back here sooner. The one standout from our otherwise forgettable first visit was the Prince Edward Island mussels in a white wine sauce. Absolutely delicious both times and any time we come back in the future they will always be the go to appetizer. The mussels are served in a large bowl and while the portion is definitely generous, mussels are only so filling, but on this occasion, the fact that they weren't terribly filling was perfect. For my entree, I had the eggs on hash which ended up being two eggs fried over medium (but they can be cooked however you like them) over breakfast potatoes and short rib tips coated in vermont white cheddar - the short ribs weren't really hash by the true definition - but, I liked it more than if it would have been true hash. I am an ever increasingly huge fan of breakfast, and I could definitely foresee this being a craving. My girlfriend had the fish and chips which she liked. I am not a huge fan of cooked fish outside of salmon and trout so I didn't try it, but as a non-fish eater, it looked pretty appetizing and I regret not trying any now that I am thinking about it. The presentation on the plate was very visually appealing \u00a0(for my dish as well) and if you are a fan of fish and chips, it seems like you'd be satisfied both in taste and portion. Not to be forgotten, but not worthy of higher billing are the cinnamon rolls, a nice homage to what I would consider \"classic\" diner dining, and very reminiscent of my childhood in New Jersey where diners are everywhere. If you are expecting bakery cinnamon rolls or even pillsbury cinnamon rolls hopefully this saves you some disappointment. BUT, the rolls (and when I say rolls I mean dinner rolls) come out nice and hot and the cinnamon topping/glaze and cream cheese icing are more than sufficient to call the finished product a cinnamon roll, even if it doesn't exactly comport with tradition. I have yet to see the dessert menu, but I am anticipating it being good and will probably get something when I come back. The service was good. The waitress was friendly and prompt and the only delay was in bringing the check and this wasn't for lack of attention but simply because she was conversing with other patrons. Overall, this place is definitely solid and we will more than likely be back, and almost definitely so if we're hungry and in the area. I say four stars not five because my first experience was pretty lackluster with the standout disappointment being the blackberry sage lemonade and because I haven't had dessert or a drink (alcoholic) yet. Regardless of this review accounting for past sins, I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are a fan of diner food or american food with a fine dining twist."], ["Katie F.", "Well this is an awesome place you just have to eat here. When we sat down at table the waitress gave us delicious hot buttered rolls yummy. Then for dinner I had the crab crusted tilapia and it was delicious. The crab and tilapia had such a nice flavor. \u00a0The crab crusted tilapia had season red skin potatoes and grilled vegetables. Yummy. Some of the others pole at my table had the crab cakes and blacken salmon salad and everyone said it was really good.

I've heard from a couple people that cap city had a pretty decent fish and chips but decent was kind of an exaggeration. Our service was great and the waitress was super attentive and friendly. Our shrimp appetizer was muy bien but the fish and chips was a flop. The fries were hot, but soggy and far from \"chips\". The fish were more like the spherical chunks we ate in grade school.

The crab cake was delicious. Not too much filler mostly crabMy son ordered the pecan crusted pork chops and the serving was huge. 2 giant bone in chops. Cheddar mashed potatoes on the side. Very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips. Thick batter and 4 large pieces of cod with thin cut fries. Good, not great. It was very hot but the cod didn't have a lot of flavor on its own. I would still recommend it if you like thick pieces of fish. The best part of the meal was dessert. Warm banana bread pudding. Quite the mouthful of awesome sweetness. Honestly one if the best desserts I have ever had. The meals around me looked good too meatloaf and a crusted chicken dish with pasta. \u00a0 Definitely will eat there again if back in the area."], ["Bre H.", "I absolutely loved it here! We were in town moving my boyfriend into school so we were staying at the Marriott right down the street and decided to walk to the restaurant which was about a block away. For drinks I got a cucumber chiller which had rye in it and it was very different and refreshing. My boyfriend got some sort of grapefruit Alcoholic drink and his was good too just very sweet! For an appetizer we got pretzel & beer cheese. The pretzel was amazing. I've been to Germany and it tastes a lot like their pretzels. Paired with the beer cheese was so good! It also came with honey mustard which was pretty good but I'm a honey mustard enthusiast so I've had way better! For dinner my boyfriends dish was by far the best one we ordered. He ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni. It came with mushrooms, peppers, onions, spinach, and tomatos in a red pepper sauce which was to die for. I ordered their famous meatloaf and I liked that as well. The presentation was great it had Texas toast on the bottom then meatloaf, mashed potatoes and topped with fried onion flakes. It also had 2 pieces of broccoli with a sweet sauce around the plate. It was good and I would order it again, but last night the pasta was just the winner! I really love coming to Columbus and trying out all of the food places they have to offer! Next time I come back I will definitely be getting the spicy pasta!!"], ["Myra E.", "Had a fantastic brunch here last week! Service and food were 5 star all the way.

I had the meatloaf that everyone has been raving about and my mentee had the pork chops. The portions were healthy, but the pork chop ones were REALLY big.The meatloaf was very good and the components (toast, mashed potatoes, broccoli, etc.) were all tasty. I would have preferred that it was not all lumped on top of each other in a tower, but I suppose I will have to let that go for the sake of culinary aesthetic appeal. All the flavors played very well with each other and I didn't have to reach for the ketchup!I had a taste of my mentee's pork chops and they were very good! Moist and flavorful, they had a great candied pecan crust that had a nice sweet taste. \u00a0The greens and sweet potato mash were also very good.The only down side to this restaurant is the parking and proximity to other tables. The parking situation is pretty difficult so we ended up parking on the back side of the Ohio Health facility, not sure if that's ok, but I didn't get a ticket, so that's good. \u00a0Also, the tables seem to be pretty close to each other, or at least I felt like the table next to us kept staring at our food, which was a bit weird."], ["Anna T.", "Cap City used to always be a solid choice for me but I think its fine dining food concept is fading. It's hearty and yummy, but this last time I went (first time in a few years), I found the portions unnecessarily outrageous - 2 massive pork chops! And then the pieces of cake that may as well be called just cake. I left Cap City looking like I had gone to the grocery store as I had a paper bag stuffed with leftovers (cake uneaten...to be eaten later) The service was kind of dramatic like the food they serve. Our waiter was so enthusiastic about every dish that it got uncomfortable."], ["Lea P.", "The five stars are for the superb service my mom and I received when we popped in about half an hour before closing. Although I feel a little guilty coming into a restaurant that late, knowing that some of the staff will be working later than they might like as a result, no one at Cap City expressed any frustration or weariness about it.Our server, Jeff, was a doll. He came over and was in the middle of telling us the specials. Soon as he started talking about the meat, meat, meat, my mom broke in, pointed at me, and said, \"Vegan.\" Now... there are more animal products I avoid than those I eat, but I never claim to be a vegan. My mother knows this. I think she was trying to make the moment funny by stopping the server in his tracks. Unfortunately, it wasn't very funny, and it made it too awkward for me to order the very non-vegan shrimp I had my eye on.But what it did do was give Jeff the chance to show how considerate and helpful he and the diner as a whole could be when faced with a customer with dietary restrictions. The menu has a few things on it suitable for ovo-lacto vegetarians but literally nothing ready-made for vegans (y'know, aside from beverages). Anything one might want would need to be modified in some way. As we discovered, they're more than happy to modify. Jeff checked on the contents of the black bean burger for me and reported back apologetically that it has egg in it. Not easily modifiable. But (he noted)! ...the dish uninspiringly called \"Seasonal Vegetable Plate\" gets its dousing of dairy after the food is prepared, and so it might be a good option.My mom and I decided to split this dish. What's more, Jeff asked the kitchen -- and the kitchen complied -- to make one half vegan and one half not. So mom's was slathered in butter and goat cheese and mine wasn't. And let me tell you about this dish. Ok, so if you saw \"Seasonal Vegetable Plate\" on a menu, would it grab your attention and shout to you, \"Order me!\" in a plaintive plea? No, me neither. Despite being the one item on the menu that sounds critter product-free, the name would fill my brain with visions of bland steamed carrots and broccoli, and I would pass right by it. But that's not what this is.It has veggies, yes, but it also has some really tasty hummus and plenty of pita bread. It has a fluffy wild rice side with bits of everything in it, including some flavorful cherries that complement the wild rice perfectly. The veggies are anything but bland and certainly not steamed but roasted and juicy. And if you're not me dining out with my overzealous mother, you get goat cheese, too. This \"vegetable\" plate, which is more like a vegetarian feast, is a secret in plain view on the menu. (As a side note, the lack of butter did not deter from the dish one bit, as far as I could tell.)And the strawberry-basil lemonade was pretty kickass, too.So:* Polite service despite our late arrival.* Server bent over backward to help customer find something she'd be happy with.* House happy to not only split a dish but prepare it differently for each half. (My mom picked up the check, so I don't know if they charged a split dish fee.)* No one rushed us out when we finished past closing time; in fact, our server offered us dessert.If this isn't five-star service, I don't know what is."], ["Will P.", "Big ol' piece of goodness \u00a0Ordered a carryout chocolate cake dessert last night. \u00a0Was ready by the time I arrived. \u00a0The piece of cake almost fills up a to go container it is so big. \u00a0It is very rich with a mousse-like icing. \u00a0Hits the chocolate spot with more cake to spare."], ["Whit R.", "I brought a colleague to Columbus for a meeting recently and we grabbed lunch here on the recommendation of a local. \u00a0It was very good.I had a chicken BLT and it was spot on. \u00a0It was one of those situations where you look at the sandwich, you start to eat it and you're thinking, \"There's no way I'm gonna finish this thing.\" \u00a0Next thing you know, you're 1/3 of the way in to the second half and you figure, \"Well, so much for that plan\" and down it goes. \u00a0Yum!Cap City strikes a good balance between classy upscale lunch spot and good old-fashioned diner. \u00a0Plenty of comfort food and unhealthy stuff on the menu. \u00a0I was definitely NOT the only person in a suit and tie, too, which I always appreciate.One negative - there were fruit flies. \u00a0We had a table by the front window, and maybe there was a little crack or it hadn't been cleaned in a while or something, but there were fruit flies buzzing around us pretty much the entire time. \u00a0It wasn't that many but still, it was a bit gross.The quality of the meal and the experience make up for that, though.I'll be back."], ["Regina F.", "Pro Tip: However hungry you think you are, subtract one dish (including an entree) for every two people and you'll likely still emerge from Cap City a few inches thicker. While the vegetable plate came with warm, grilled veggies, melted goat cheese and fat, scrumptious pita, the hummus was a tad salty...especially when paired with smushy, warm olives. But the rice pilaf is something to bring back to your local diner and suggest to Flo...it's not greasy and is delicately topped with crunchy almond slivers. The pilaf itself is cooked al dente (if it's possible to describe rice that way) and loaded with dried cranberries and raisins, which add a nice sweet kick to compliment the nutty rice. But the real star of Cap City is its bavarian pretzel appetizer. The pretzels are slightly doughy, with a nice, dark amber crust sprinkled with just enough kosher salt. For dipping, these pretzels (two per order) are served with the most amazing beer cheese \u00a0- melted, with a hoppy, earthy flavor - and homemade mustard, which retails a bit of the crunch from mustard seeds.

Our server asked if we wanted anything to drink but walked away immediately after asking so we were not even given an option. I don't see a reason to keep ranting about the service. That should say enough to give you an idea. The pizza was not good. I was surprised because of such nice reviews online. It tasted as if the pizza had been rolled in salt before and after cooking. I was never given a chance to say anything to someone and having had to wait 45 minutes for it to come out, it seemed better to just eat what we could and just leave.

Not sure how often I'll be back in Columbus, but would def go back if I have the chance."], ["Will B.", "Hands down, the most underrated PIZZA shop in Columbus!Thinking of Rossi as the best pizza shop in the Short North puts a whole different spin on it. I mean, it's hard to stand out in the Short North, especially as an American style restaurant and bar. But pizza... that's a key point of difference. The pizza is so good I've only ordered anything else one time. You can create your own pie with toppings of choice, they're comparatively affordable, and the wine list to pair with it is well curated. This is a great place for a relaxed date or a pizza night with friends with great taste."], ["Tan N.", "One of my go-to spots. The food is great, it's open late AND on Sundays, and the service is awesome. They're super nice and helpful there. I've recently gone gluten-free for health reasons and have had to become \"that\" person. But it's gone better than expected in the nicer establishments in Columbus. They have been able to sub out things for me and it's all still delicious and now, healthier! But let's review some of my favorite non-gluten free stuff that's on the menu that I've had because that's what you're most likely to order: Love the french fries. Just the right crisp and texture. The ricotta meatballs were also delicious. I shared with a friend. I think we had the Burrata too but it wasn't as memorable. The golden raisin, cashew and black pepper feta salad is delicious! One of my favorite salads in town. There just aren't enough places to get a good salad though and I wish there were more but this is pretty good for something I didn't have to make at home. From the brasserie, the grilled salmon sandwich is off the hook. Loved it. Huge. \u00a0Enough for two ladies to split and get a large salad and an app. I so miss it now that I can't eat bread. Have some for me, will you? We had a delicious market fish (trout, I believe) that was very nicely prepared as well. I wouldn't hesitate to order the seafood here. They always serve my favorite, salmon, perfectly medium-rare when I order it. Pizza? Well, I lived in NYC for 12 years and this is NOT New York style pizza. I'm not sure why C-bus spots feel the need to always say it's NY style when in fact, a NY slice requires it to be thin--no puff, okay?--foldable, and large. If it's good on its own merits, then great--but don't call it NY when it's obviously not. That being said, I haven't tried the pizza here yet because I've seen the pics and friends have told me if I'm expecting a NY slice, fuggedabouit! I've heard good things though in terms of it just being a good pizza from Columbus. Hey, maybe one day Columbus Pizza could be a thing!"], ["Tash L.", "Rossi can be a busy place, especially on a Friday night. The downside is that they don't take reservations on weekends. We tried going here on a Friday at 7:30pm and the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. I couldn't wait that long so we picked another place and came back the following Friday. We arrived pretty early (before 6pm) and were seated right away. On to the food: the grilled salmon sandwich was moist and flavorful but the fries and lemon basil aioli were the winners of the meal. I'm a fry fanatic and these are some of the best fries I've had at a restaurant. The perfect amount of crisp and grease. I highly recommend!"], ["Paige W.", "I got the Short Rib Poutine and it was so good but their drink named \"on the level\" was horrible. Like drinking hot, spicy rubbing alcohol. Couldn't even take two drinks of it. Not because of the spiciness but because it tasted like gasoline. So don't order that drink and you should be fine"], ["Jessie K.", "Located towards the north end of the short north is a definite short north staple. Quaint, sophisticated, lively, crafty, and cool; this spot fits right in with the locale theme. The menu is simple upscale american bar fair. On a positive note they seem to be open late as well, which is definitely a plus on Sunday's. Ordered: Salmon sandwich: flavor profile: 3.75/5, price: $12The salmon sandwich is great! I ordered it because I saw another lady at the bar with the same sandwich and looked tasty. I also saw her with this same sandwich and has a side mixed salad too and assumed that what I would have gotten, too, not the case. They actually came with fries, which was a restaurant fail for me because typically sandwiches are served with fries and not salads. Nonetheless, the sandwich was delicious and the goat cheese was a nice touch. However, it was wayyy too greasy for my taste. The salmon itself is already a fatty fish, but when you add oil/butter to the toast it came on, and the heavily oiled fries on the side, it starts to look not as appetizing. Also ordered a hot cocktail which was a nice touch to the drink menu. I like seeing more non-chain restaurant offer seasonal menus."], ["Sarita C.", "Delicious pizza !! best crust I have found after 20 years in Columbus. Dortmunder Gold is a smooth and tasty companion to sip along with the pizza. Yummo!"], ["Mackenzie F.", "Great place for cocktails. \u00a0I ordered the salmon and it was pretty mediocre-- overcooked/dry, oversalted, and lacking in flavor somehow. \u00a0This might be why I stopped eating it after a couple of bites and got accidentally drunk."], ["Brian F.", "We celebrated a friend's birthday here yesterday, and it was an overall good experience. \u00a0The Rossi is pretty small, so it seemed really crowded yesterday at dinner time. \u00a0We had a big group, and the staff did a good job accommodating us. \u00a0We managed to get the only big table they had. \u00a0I know it was busy, but it took a long time to get drinks and eventually order. \u00a0Then, after ordering, it took about an hour to get our food. \u00a0The Rossi staff was very up front about this. \u00a0They don't have a huge kitchen, so things take a little longer. \u00a0We expected this, but I find myself getting a little antsy when you've been at a restaurant for over 4 hours. \u00a0Regardless, when the food did come, we were all happy. \u00a0I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, and it was good. \u00a0I even had a few slices leftover that I ate the following day (still good). \u00a0I'll probably try something else next time. \u00a0I had a few bites of my girlfriend's short rib sandwich, which was unbelievable. \u00a0Just melted in your mouth. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0The Rossi has a good beer and wine selection, and we all left happy. \u00a0I'll likely be back, but probably not on a Friday or Saturday night and definitely not with a big group."], ["Kyle B.", "This small restaurant packs loads of surprises. The menu is small but focused. Every item seems to serve a purpose. The Rossi burger has to be the most text book burger in town. Their hand cut fries are an excellent compliment. I'm a huge fan of their pizza's too which happen to feed 2. With such limited space, parties of 6 or more should dine some place else. This is an intimate dining experience and they don't happen to take reservations on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. The Rossi also has a great happy hour where you can feed two with drinks for under $30."], ["Nicholas T.", "Living in the Short North I have to say the Rossi is one of my mainstays.The food that is comes out of that tiny two-man kitchen is amazing. \u00a0Their margherita pizza with prosciutto is my favorite pizza in town. \u00a0Dinners can be expensive but is great for a date night. \u00a0You can also come during happy hour and have some of the cheapest drinks and pizza in town for under 10 bucks."], ["Justin S.", "Great burger great pizza great service ask for Brandy as you're server she is great. The Rossi is our favor restaurant"], ["Marshal R.", "Planned a surprise 30th birthday party at this restaurant for my girlfriend. The staff and MGMT were very helpful in getting everything set up for the event as well as accommodating my various special requests. I forgot birthday candles for the cake I brought but the server made sure they had candles on the cake. The food was amazing and the service was great. I look forward to returning for future meals because all the food looked very good! If you're in the short north you should definitely consider eating here."], ["Alexis S.", "One of my favorite restaurants and a place I bring all friends from out of town. \u00a0Warm and inviting atmosphere, \u00a0a lovely bar, and friendly service make this place a must. \u00a0The Bott Burger I truly feel is the best burger in Columbus!!!! If they have pork belly on the menu get it, truly to die for!!!! Their seasonal risotto is usually a killer as well, the pork chop is one of their signature dishes and worth it as well. \u00a0A great wine selection as well as full bar make this the perfect get together spots for friends or romantic encounters."], ["Robert H.", "Stopped in for a late bite on a recent weeknight. \u00a0The bar was busy, but we were able to get a table right away. \u00a0We decided to stick with apps and tried the foie gras and the lamb lollipops. \u00a0The lamb was juicy and tender and made me want to gnarl on the bone, but since I didn't want to upset my gorgeous date, I shifted my jaw toward the foie gras, which was little slice of fatty liver heaven. \u00a0After the enjoying our tasty apps and waking from the food trance, we sat and enjoyed engaging conversation and a nice Pinot Noir for the rest of our visit, without hassle or hustle. \u00a0A nice cap to the evening."], ["J T.", "I've been to the Rossi many times and every one has been consistently good. \u00a0Last night the manager was our server (cut most staff early due to the 6\" snowfall) and she was great! \u00a0I had the lamb lollipops which were fantastic. The Burger and pizza are my go to items here, they are both consistently excellent."], ["Srebs T.", "I dig this place... it's kinda small, it's kinda mysterious, and it's kinda upscale hipster (yes I know that's an oxymoron). It's kinda like a unknown band that plays at Coachella but doesn't actually suck like every band that plays at Coachella inevitably does. With that said, leave your hemp and flower head pieces, vintage combat boots, and frayed jorts at home (actually just do everyone a favor and burn them) because this place is actually polished and people dress well there (for Columbus... so we're talking Tory Burch flats and Kate Spade clutch not Balmain and Cavalli). The food has always been very good.. but make sure if you're going in on a Friday or Saturday you make a reservation unless you want to hang out for 45 minutes standing in a 0.1 sq foot area by the bar praying the person next to you showered that day. As far as the drinks go... their house cocktails are decent.. it's been hit or miss for me. I must say, whatever you do don't order dirty martinis there.. the last time I tried that one I had to ask them to remake it twice before giving up and even after the second time it tasted like watery vodka (there was ice chunks in my drink both times) mixed with olive juice older than the Greek empire itself. Regular mixed drinks and wine are on par. The prosciutto-wrapped ceasar salad is a great take on the traditional and they have some of my favorite fries. Apart from that the mixed drinks are solid and it's a great spot for a date during the week (especially if it's the dreaded first date off of Tinder where you don't know if the person could be your future spouse or the next Charles Manson) when it's not as packed!"]], "Spagio": []}
