The servers care and the chef/owner (Mr. Lashish, I presume?) takes time to come to the front of the house to make sure everyone is enjoying the food. And he'll gaze around enjoying other people enjoying his food. Adorbs. Plus, I've never been here and not been offered something extra: a small glass of hot tea, small slices of honey cake, or both.The ingredients are very fresh. This isn't fast food disguised as Greek, though you won't be waiting forever or break the bank, either. AND, there's a rotating list of specials. I really wanted to try the blackened grouper from the specials list last time, but went with a more traditional schwarma plate instead. Either would have been excellent, I'm sure. I overheard one of the waiters talking to another patron about their seafood supplier, so I know freshness and quality are high priorities for them.My only gripe-- and it's a small one-- is that the dining room could be a little more comfortable. There aren't many seats, which is fine (I've never not been able to get a seat \u00a0here), but the tables are a tad wobbly and the chairs are a bit stiff.

We went with traditional, but then he gave us the lebanese one for free because he wanted us to try them both!

After walking through the whole area, Cafe Istanbul's Mediterranean menu convinced me to walk through their doors for dinner. White linen cloths, stained glass accents, gold and red colors, and a high ceiling distinguishes the dining room far from a \"cafe\". Groups of tables are separated into different partially enclosed rooms creating some intimacy if desired. Start the meal with a hot appetizer, their Sigara B\u00f6rek. It's basically rolled phyllo dough filled with feta cheese and parsley. It reminded me of cream cheese wontons but more tang to it.I ordered the Mixed Grill Kebab to share between two people. \u00a0It comes with half portions of the Chicken, Doner, Shish and Adana kebabs. The kebabs are grilled and come on a plate with rice pilaf and veggies. The chicken was moist. Doner is the ground lamb and beef that is a vertically hung rotisserie and carved. The Shish, marinated lamb, was my favorite of them all. It was tender and just how I enjoy my lamb cooked. \u00a0Adana is grounded lamb with onions and red peppers - tasty but but after having their Shish, it doesn't compare.

But anyways, the food. I had planned to order a sandwich and appetizer on this trip, but either this branch does not serve sandwiches or it was past the time they are available because I did not see them on the menu. \u00a0That was fine, though - I got an old favorite, moussaka, instead. \u00a0And wow, that's some good moussaka. \u00a0The ingredients blend together perfectly for a fantastic chewy texture with lots of sweet and savory flavors, with the eggplant/mozzerella/bechamel topping being the highlight. \u00a0Not to knock the plentiful and flavorful meat, but it's the top part of the meal that make it work. \u00a0This is served with a plate of tasty, seasoned rice and a piece of roasted tomato and pepper on a bed of creamy sauce. \u00a0Like all meals, it also comes with a \u00a0nice big basket of Istanbul's bread and mild, spiced dipping oil to share with your companions. The bread is seriously good stuff, with a slightly sweet taste, a crisp crust, and soft, super addictive inside. \u00a0It's both a very good and very bad thing they give you such a good portion - good because it is delicious and you will want to eat it all....and bad for the very same reason. \u00a0As to drinks, Istanbul has a full bar and some interesting teas, but I decided on Turkish coffee. \u00a0You can never have enough caffeine after all. \u00a0 However, for $3.25, you sure don't get much caffeine, even considering how pungent the Turkish style of coffee is. \u00a0One little (admittedly beautiful) little cup is all you get, which seems strange since I have been to other restaurants where I can get an entire pot of coffee for less than that. \u00a0...though to be fair, they are Lebanese and not Turkish and not located in Columbus. \u00a0Anyway, I suggest you try the apple tea instead, which not only has free refills, but is apparently very good (I did not try it but my friend who did said it was fantastic).Prices, in all, do seem on the high side to me, though they aren't ridiculous or that unusual for this sort of food in this sort of atmosphere. \u00a0 Also, keep in mind that, as of this review, Istanbul offers a 15% off coupon (per person or per table) on their website that you can print off. \u00a0It used to be offered in the local newspapers as well. \u00a0My friend and I both utilized one without any difficulty. \u00a0Now as to other points - service is a bit mixed. \u00a0The main server we had was.... not enthused with her job. \u00a0It could also take a lot of time to get refills and other things. \u00a0However, there was another man (the/an owner?) who popped in and out now and then and was very pleasant. \u00a0Also, as the place isn't that large, I expect waits are a normal occurrence come dinner time. \u00a0However, there is a very nice area to wait in by the entry, with some big leather couches, reading material, and some items for sale from Karavan (same people as on High Street I presume) for perusal.Anyway, if you're hungry at Easton, I would certainly suggest giving Istanbul a try. \u00a0Good food, fantastic, bread, and a very nice atmosphere."], ["QQ J.", "Nice place in Easton.

Since he took my card before I saw the itemized bill, he had to refund my card and re-charge me the new bill amount. Lastly, he offered me tea to go LITERALLY 5 times saying \"are you sure you don't just want to take it to go? I can get it in under a minute. are you sure? are you sure? I can just bring it to you to go\" OVER AND OVER. Uh, no I don't want to be charged over $2 for a small cup of tea to go when I could have gotten free refills the entire time I was sitting there.

The place wasn't even packed and our waiter (who was waiting 3 tables at most) could not get our order right.3) The gyro meat was cold and fatty. It was obviously from the day before and re-heated.4) There was only one dessert option, which was rice pudding. Both of us are lactose intolerant and unable to eat rice pudding. The dessert is included in the lunch order, which is why this is off-putting.In the end, we didn't get tea. I got my card swiped twice. The gyro meat was old,cold,and fatty. We didn't get dessert.

A great place throughout the years! The owner is an tall eccentric lovable man who will come and thank you each time you come and sit in his restaurant to eat.Food: I will say that I am a bit of a snob when it comes to Mediterranean food. That being said, Naz does not disappoint. The owner is from Israel and has used the same recipes for almost 15 years. The wine selection is great and there is not a better place to enjoy a beer as you watch OSU beat the team of the week. The gyros are perfectly seasoned and the lamb inside is moist and tender. The fries that are served as the typical side dish to most entrees are made in house and very well seasoned. The hummus is also made in house and is perfect. The Hummus and Pita appetizer is great! The grape leaf Dolmas are a little under par but that is the only thing that is underwhelming. Overall, the best place I have found for Mediterranean in Central Ohio after about 20 years living in the area. Service: Exceptional! Exceptional! Exceptional! As I mentioned before, the owner, if he is in will welcome you at the door and usually come greet you at your table as you're dinning. Sometimes he will bring his metal bat with him as a joke, insinuating that if you don't like the food, to not speak up. Don't worry though, he is probably the nicest guy you will meet and his personality is warm and friendly across the board. I have had the pleasure of dining here about 50 times over the years and I have never had bad service. The food is delivered promptly and the service has an excited atmosphere.Price: I am a little biased in my opinion of the price of this establishment. I am definitely willing to pay for good Mediterranean food, but surprisingly, this will not put a big hole in your wallet. Typically, the entrees range in price from $9 to about $14. Definitely a great price for the quality of the experience you are sure to have.Ambiance: As mentioned before, this establishment just moved to the Hamilton Rd location from the far North end. The building they are in is definitely an improvement to the earlier two locations. It is new and clean and feels very open. If you remember and appreciate the old locations, with their Christmas trees year round, don't worry. The tradition has made it's way to the new location as well, with a little more taste this time. This is a great place for a quick lunch or a relaxing dinner. The new location is classy and bright, without making you feel uncomfortable in jeans. The booths have a little higher than usual backs on them as well which adds a little more privacy without making it feel closed in. Ultimately, it is not a difficult decision to say that this place is five star worthy. I have nothing negative to say about this place! Being directly off of Hamilton Rd. near 161 feels like a very natural progression for this Columbus culinary icon!"], ["Craig O.", "Walked in and ordered take out. \u00a0 Food is very good. \u00a0I really like the hummus, lentils and falafel. \u00a0 I agree the falafel is some of the best I've had. \u00a0 \u00a0I also ordered the lamb kabobs. \u00a0They were tender. \u00a0Almost too tender. \u00a0I would have liked a touch more char or crust. \u00a0The sauces were also a bit watered down. \u00a0 Instead of 5 sauces in my takeout, one thick one would have been sufficient.

And we opted for calamari which were claimed to be \"best in town.\" I am not that familiar with the town of Columbus, maybe it has never seen anything better than couple of \u00a0overfried circles of octopus but in Cleveland you can buy something similar in a frozen seafood section in Wal mart. This entire world is divided into calamari eaters and non-calamari eaters. The first group wants a real calamari challenge - with chewy tentacles and small unidentified sea monsters. We really don't care about tiny generic rings. Second group doesn't want rings either. Actually it doesn't want any part of it: even sitting next to someone eating \"this gross thing\". My salad was this small collection of greens thrown into a very large bowl with a very bitter over-fried falafel. Actually I have never tried falafel worse than this in my entire life. I couldn't taste the food of others at my table due to Lent season but they were also uninspired. The waitress did throw a baklava piece after my husband complained about the onions in his dish which he asked not to put. She seemed genuinely surprised and concerned with us not finishing our meals but I found complaining useless: I give up on asking for upgrade when I am starting to feel that absolutely everything in this place is mediocre.

In the end I always feel like I've spent a few more bucks than I should have.I really love their 4 dip appetizer. You can choose from the 5 or 6 dips they offer and get a little taste of everything, accompanied with pita and a few cucumbers and kalatmata olives (more for garnish). The hummus and eggplant dip is okay, but the tzatziki and spicy feta dips are great. It's just a bummer you don't really get enough pita to enjoy it all and there's a charge for extra. Also, the dip sampler is around $9-$10, which just feels a little steep to me.I have had a traditional gyro once, it was okay but not super memorable. I really enjoy their salads and love the one that comes with toasty pita chips tossed in it. You have the option of adding protein (from a pretty extensive list), but I usually just get the salad meatless since I'm usually a bit fullish from the dip appetizer. Their Avgolemono soup is really tasty and should be tried at least once.In the past year or so they've added a patio, which is AWESOME for Short North.

It reminded me of the shawarma over at Pita House, but I have to say, I might like it even better. The spices inside, along with the delicious hummus, were fantastic. The fries that came with the meal had a great Cajun spice on them and were super crispy. Overall, this sandwich combo was top notch in my book, especially at $9.99 for the pita, fries, and a drink.I also had an order of falafel, and it's been awhile since I've found falafel that's really amazed me, but this has got to be some of the best in Columbus. The tahini, or whatever it was, that came with it was delicious, and the falafel was super crispy and not too dense on the inside.

Vegetarian, vegan, halal, gluten-free - you are going to have plenty of options.I've been coming here since they opened, and I am (sorry not sorry) admitting to only ordering a couple of things in all that time - their gyro plate and their falafel sandwich. SO good. The falafel is fried on order, so always fresh, hot and delicious. They put those heavenly little things into a pita shell along with hummus (mmm), pickles (yum), red cabbage, lettuce, onion, tomato, and creamy sauce. A balance of everything necessary for an awesome sandwich experience, that's what you're getting. The gyro plate is a deconstruction, with plenty of spiced beef/lamb...but I really want a falafel sandwich if I'm at the Hut. It's that good.Pita Hut's sides are fresh and delicious. They have the Mediterranean-middle East crack fries (big, soft inside, crispy outside, dusted with spices), baba, hummus, cauliflower & eggplant salads, tabbouli, etc. I like their cauliflower salad better than the fries! Desserts run more to baklava and cheesecake, but there is kunefe and other shredded wheat-based sweets. Drinks are standard cans and bottles of soda, a few fountain options - but there is plenty of variety at their carryout next door (which is owned by the Pita Hut folks) or take your food over to Bob's Bar and pair up with your favorite beer.

The \"meat\" variant is my main choice, specifically featuring lamb pieces as the tasty animal. Ingredients are stuffed into a warmed pita pocket, generally featuring the chosen main ingredient plus a mix of hummus, onions, vegetables, pickles, tahini and optionally hot sauce. What starts as crisp bites of veggies and tahini evolves slowly as the meat mixes in with the toppings, gravity pulling the liquid ingredients and remnants of the others down to the bottom in a sublime melange of sauce, seasoned meat and pita. Don't waste an ounce of that lovely liquid mixture on a napkin or your shirt, or you'll regret it for days...if you can make it that long 'til your next fix.Even though I live well off in Dublin, I find myself braving High Street often for this quick, delicious sandwich, even when I'm not visiting Bob's.

Not necessary..but very nice response. So I went back a 3rd time give it another try (on my dime) \u00a0and was happy I didn't give up on this place. The service was back up to the level it had been previously! I ordered my standard \u00a0tilapia salad and it was full of fresh ingredients and the fish was cooked perfectly. I also got a Mezze plate with spicy feta, hummus and the eggplant salad. The hummus seem like a different recipe- not as oily as hummus can be..really thick and very nutty tasting..I really liked it. The eggplant salad was really good and is my new favorite. I'm glad I went back that 3rd time!!"], ["Jessica W.", "It was great! Falafel was super good.

We even told them they didn't have to, because we weren't all that hungry, but they insisted. Well, I'm not going to argue about free food. It wasn't the absolute best Mediterranean food I've ever had, but it was pretty darn good. The baba ghanouj was delicious. I could take or leave the spicy feta, but I get it that they want to have a gimmick. Falafels were flavorful and crispy, the tabouli was perfect.

For half the price my friend got the shawarma sandwich which came with just as much meat as the entree, but just didn't include rice. I would definitely go back but would order a sandwich next time.

I would say Lavash has some of the tastiest Middle Eastern food in Columbus. The food is always consistently delicious whenever I come here, whether having order online or in the restaurant. I usually get their babaganoush, hummus, falafel, or shawarma sandwiches/platters. Their salad is also very good, seems like they use \u00a0fresh vegetables. It's a very casual restaurant if you want to sit down and eat, therefore I don't understand why their prices have been soaring. It costs about $8 for a shawarma sandwich and that does not come with any sides at all, and a shawarma platter is $15. \u00a0A couple of years ago, you could get a sandwich for almost $6 and a platter for maybe $10 or so. I have not been going as much because despite the quality of food, I cannot justify paying that much money for a light sandwich.

Falafel was really on point, fresh, and crispy."], ["Abby S.", "I got the lamb kabob and it came with one stick, containing maybe 4 cubes of lamb with a sliver of green and red pepper and rice.

I almost dinged them a star for that, but I guess it's probably healthier for me that way anyways, so I'll keep it. I had the lamb kabob lavash, and the lamb melted in my mouth, with the taste and texture of the inside of the sandwich being perfect. I will get the pita next time, as I'm not a big fan of wraps. They had a great selection for both lunch and dinners, an impressive choice of desserts, including baklava, dates, and tiramisu, and a neat little soda dispensing machine with a touchscreen. There was both indoor and outdoor seating, the staff was great, and the pricing was very reasonable."], ["Zeb L.", "This place's food is all over the map in terms of quality. The grape leaves were not very flavorful and did not taste very authentic; we ended up tossing them. The Shawarma and the sandwiches are pretty good but nothing to write home about. However, the baklava is very, very good. The prices are too high for me to go here regularly, especially given that the food is inconsistent, but if I'm at Growl I might stop by for the baklava again."], ["Sharon B.", "We discovered Lavash a few years ago, after reading a listing of some of the top sandwich restaurants in Columbus. This place has never disappointed us. The meats in the cold case - kabobs, raw lamb chops, etc. - look good enough and fresh enough to almost want to eat them raw. The tabbouleh is fresh, fresh, fresh, with plenty of parsley to give it crunch. If I thought it would hold up on the 3 hour drive home, I would buy it by the quart. Their pita is equally delicious; I am not sure if they make it in their own bakery, but the bread chef should be applauded. Portion sizes are quite generous; their sandwiches with one side should be enough for most appetites. This time, I had the beef/lamb shwarma; the meet was a little they this time, but the flavors are still perfect. BTW, one order of fries is enough to serve two people. I can't really speak about the dessert selection; it looks beautiful, but I am not a fan of baklava and the like, so I can't really address that area.When I have to go to Columbus, I often try to figure out how to include a trip to Lavash, no matter how short the visit will be. I wish them a long and profitable future, which gives me ample opportunity to enjoy their offerings."], ["Jeff B.", "Their food is fresh, made from quality ingredients, and is authentic mediterranean food... the best in Columbus I have found so far! \u00a0For some reason, Aladdin's is popular among many people but in my opinion, Lavash is one hundred times better in every way. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable and the food is always high quality. \u00a0I highly recommend it!"], ["John M.", "As someone who lived in the north campus/south Clintonville area for many years, it is difficult to talk about Lavash Cafe, about their menu, their service, their prices, etc, without talking about the elephant in the room. \u00a0And that elephant is called Aladdin's Eatery, which had been a solid Clintonville fixture in Greek/Mediterranean cuisine since I was an undergrad. \u00a0Lavash made its Columbus debut by moving in two doors down from that much-loved elephant, which is a ballsy move by anyone's standard's, and so it got me thinking: these people must be pretty confident in their product.And make no mistake, their menu offers up much of what Aladdin's offers, but where it seems to stand out a bit is the boldness of their flavor palette. \u00a0From their spicy black bean hummus to their falafel (and their fantastic red snapper entree -mon dieu!), your taste buds are sent on a nice little coaster ride. \u00a0What's more, the portions are surprisingly generous.On the downside, however, I was disappointed to see the price increases, some dramatically higher, since my first visit. \u00a0Also, their desserts leave something to be desired. \u00a0The baklava and basma seemed to be a bit stale and somewhat bland, but these are bite-sized and cheap so I let it pass.All in all, these guys have given every Greek/Mediterranean restaurateur a good run for their money, and good for them for doing so. \u00a0Factoring in everything, I can't say that it has unseated Aladdin's in my mind, but if I told you I'd never go back to Lavash Cafe, you could safely call me a liar, liar, pants on fire."], ["Kevin D.", "I enjoyed Lavash Cafe but wouldn't return. The pros: friendly service, nice casual atmosphere, big portions, fancy soda machine with dozens of flavors, food made fresh, big dessert selection. Cons: I just didn't love most of the food. Compared to other middle eastern restaurants that I frequent in other cities, I didn't care for a few of their dishes, specifically the falafel, grape leaves, baba ganoush and pita (very thick and bready). This is just my personal opinion however - I don't think anything was made poorly, they just weren't my taste. I think Lavash Cafe is definitely worth a visit."], ["Tiffany W.", "One of my favorites in Columbus! The food here is amazing and the portion sizes are generous -- I usually end up taking some back with me and it makes for a great lunch the next day. The hummus and pita are absolutely delicious, especially when the pita comes out fresh and warm. =) Their main entree dishes are also excellent. The rice is flavorful and delicious, and the meats are really well prepared. I don't even usually like lamb, but I have really enjoyed their lamb dishes! I've tried their biryani, shawrma, shish kabob, kefta kabob, and fish. I've loved everything I've tried so far! Also, their freshly squeezed juices are amazing! A little pricey ($4 for a glass) but makes for a nice addition to the meal or to take back with you. Their dessert selection that is on display is always super tempting -- I have had their baklava (because I love baklava) and it's pretty good, though I will admit I usually don't have much room for dessert after a meal here. Overall, service is great. Seating and parking are easy to find even during peak times, and food is delivered to you pretty quickly."], ["Bethel T.", "I really love this place! The people here at friendly, all the way from the owner to the staff. The meat they have is just so tender and moist and seasoned to perfection.

My date was pescetarian and had been here before quite a few times so I had her order for both of us. For her the mixed vegetables and rice. For me the Lamb Moussaka. Yellow rice adorned with sliced nuts. Then a mediterranean style lasagna composed of ground lamb cooked eggplant saut\u00e9ed onions. Fi on top a creamy cheesy mixed vegetable topping which had a thick crust on top to give some added texture. I wasn't so sure I was going to like it as me and my date discussed it eating our small starter salads. We were also give pita bread to go along with it. The flavors were interesting and different but also very good haha. The lamb onion eggplant mix was great and the cheesy cream was alright too, although I thought the crust was the best part. I also thought the lamb could have been slightly more seasoned, but that's just me. Everything here is super authentic and pretty damn good. I'd recommend stopping in if you ever find yourself in Columbus."], ["Andy P.", "I recently got into Mediterranean food, and this place was really good. I got the lamb skewers. I really hate dry meet, so thank you it wasn't dry. The rice was a little dry for me though, but they have nice condiments like olive oil \u00a0and other sauces. The service wasn't really that friendly, but they did their job. The decor is interesting with multi-color, and it was definitely different. Very homey feeling to it and great for groups of family where you can share portions. Where you order food also reminds me of a deli style and the wait for the food isn't long.They had a lot of meat on display, which made me want to order everything - especially the kabobs!I want to come back here with a group of people and have a family style sharing dinner."], ["Kent K.", "The main thing I have to say here is that the food is The Taste!! I got the Lamb Mousaka, some kind of lasagna type dish with ground lamb, cheese and fried eggplant instead of pasta, and rice on the side. Plus meals come with a salad and a plate of hummus and pita bread. Unfortunately there is some bad I must add. The food is overpriced, in my opinion. If this is a high class sit down and order type of restaurant it would be ok. But it not. So you see the price and expect more out of the place. Or maybe you see the place first and expect lower prices, but whatever. Plus they had some food pre-made, which is great for take-out, but it makes me question the quality.  And I must mention the Turkish coffee! C'mon, coffee is meant to be consumed alone, not with 30 added spices! I realize though, Turkey is a foreign country and that's fine if they want to make it like that. It's good for 1 or 2 demitasse full. Anyways, it is good food which is hard to argue with.

The process is pretty simple - Pick your base, protein, veggies, and sauce. I always go with the greek chicken salad or bowl. The brown rice with lentils has a lot of flavor so I would recommend that if you are getting a bowl. All the veggies are really fresh and crisp. I love that I can get diced pickles in my salad! Whatever you are getting, top it off with the house sauce and you can't go wrong. The brown to-go containers are very deceiving. I always think the portions are small until I'm actually sitting down and eating my meal. I usually struggle to finish a whole bowl. They give you a good amount of food for the price. Oh, and the spicy feta with pita is amazing. Definitely get that. You must stop here if you are in the area. Even if you aren't, Sababa is worth the drive to the east side!"], ["Taylor O.", "Second time here, and I am definitely a fan. \u00a0This is the \"Chipotle served\" style on Mediterranean food, and it works really well. \u00a0You get a nice warm welcome when you first come in. \u00a0They will start you off with small samples of their rice's, sauces and proteins. \u00a0You pick your base, the Lentil Rice here, I could take pounds of it home with me and eat it for days, I liked it so much. \u00a0Then your protein. \u00a0All of which I liked and it just made it harder to determine what I finally hungered. \u00a0Is that a good thing or a bad thing? \u00a0Finally, all the toppings and sauces you pick.

I mean... your food had better be pretty good when you have the falafel balls to name your restaurant after the Hebrew slang word for 'awesome.'I assure you, the name does not set you up for disappointment.Sababa is the latest brainchild of Johnny Baransi, who -- so graciously -- brought Mezze to our city and our tastebuds. So if you liked Mezze, which he no longer owns, you'll love it here. The food is Mediterranean + Middle Eastern, and Johnny makes everything fresh and from scratch every single day. Vegans, vegetarians, paleos, and GFers rejoice: there are countless, delicious options for you! Here's the scoop on ordering:1. Choose a base. There's hummus, salad, and two types of rice. I've tried everything except one type of rice that has vermicelli and is not GF. You seriously can't go wrong with any of them.2. Choose a protein. I'm a big fan of the chicken shawarma, and the falafel (which is made fresh to order) is my favorite in the city. 3. Go crazy with the toppings. The veggies here are no afterthought; they're outstanding. Some of my faves include: kalamata olives, Israeli pickles, banana peppers, and feta.My order usually rings in around $10, and I always have leftovers to take home. I think that's a total steal for such high quality, fresh food. Add on top of that the stellar customer service, and Sababa is a homerun for me. Sure, it's a bit out of the way, but this food is so craveable -- it's worth the drive."], ["Stephanie P.", "I am totally going to start following Bryant around since he keeps finding awesome places like Sababa.

He was also handing out samples to every person who answered \"Yes\" to his inquiry about whether they've been there before. Happily, there were a lot of first timers coming in last night. I ordered basically the same thing I had on Sunday, the husband had the chicken shwarma on a pita. We also grabbed an appetizer of the super tasty hummus. I stuffed my face of extremely good food and watching Johnny work the crowd. He never stopped moving, explaining the menu and handing out samples. This is one of those places that has something for everyone, feeds you well and is super affordable. I am happy that it is so close to my house because we will back often."], ["Gwen W.", "Johnny (owner), and the staff, are all about one thing it seems: Customer satisfaction!! Not the type of business that relies on profit as their main motivation. Sababa has pleasing the customer front and center, profit margins are not a main point that's stressed. This is why they're so damn good! If you build it good, we will come.My first interaction with Sababa was at a Yelp Elite event Sunday evening. I fell head over heals for their food, so I went back on Tuesday! This time, I knew exactly what I wanted. Salad. Add Chicken Shawarma, pickles, giant tomato and cucumber chunks, crumbled feta cheese and a spread of their house dressing. So freaking good. SO freaking good. The meat was just as juicy as the last time. And the side of fresh, hot, lightly seasoned fries stuffed me. And I still have half off the dish left :)"], ["Tammy A.", "I had this place bookmarked for a while so I wanted to visit it so many times. My friend even told me how great it is. This place used to be a Steak Escape and how I would know that is my sister would come here all the time. I'm assuming she is still coming here even with the name change because my family loves Mediterranean food being brought up with that food in our culture.Let me say I first came in clueless as to what the menu was like and it took me some time to think about what I wanted. I let several people go in front of me as they were coming in just so I could think about what I wanted. Let's just say I want my first experience to be good that I will want to come back no matter what the situation is. I saw Yelper Greg and it looked like he was enjoying his meal. Finally, I make up my mind within 20 minutes and say let's just go with a simple salad. Although I asked for gyro meat inside I don't mind I got the mild chicken. When your a clueless customer anything sounds good as long as the restaurant has left a good impression on you from the service to the food you receive. I was pleased with the service as the man working there apologized for my wait even though I did it purposely to look through their menu and give myself some time to understand what I really wanted.The atmosphere is like a Piada or Chipotle fast and you pick you base of rice, salad or pita . Next you pick your protein of gyro, greek chicken, chicken shawarma, falafel or veggie. You then choose your toppings and sauce. When you pay the dessert is on the side of baklava. Someday, I will learn to make baklava myself so that I don't have to buy it at a restaurant not that I don't like it there. You have your choice of fountain drinks, bottled water, iced tea or San Pellegrino. So you definitely have a wide array of options available to you. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want fresh Mediterranean food.

I have heard so many good things about this place from all my friends and it definitely lived up to my expectations. I am a little sad though that there isn't a location closer to me, I'd be there all the time! This place is also a \"chipotle style\" - choose your pita/bowl/salad, protiens and veggies. There are a ton of veggies, cheeses and sauces to choose from and they were all extremely fresh and tasted great. I would highly recommend trying their house sauce. I went with the pita even though I was warned it would be messy! I managed to eat almost half of it before it fell apart in the bowl and then I switched over to the fork and guess what - it tasted just as great :) Their french fries are a DEAL. $3 for a huge portion and they have a greek seasoning (kind of like a cajuny meets Lawry's Season Salt mixture) make sure you ask for this! I loved their \u00a0spicy feta as well (not sure if they charge extra for this or not).Anyhoo... Sababa you are far away, you are also yummy so I'll definitely be back!"], ["Matt W.", "I really do like this place. I need to say that up front because I do have some criticisms, and I don't want to give the wrong impression.Set up in a former Steak Escape in a little mini-strip mall on East Broad, Sababa is the brainchild of the family that used to run Mezze, and they've applied a lot of the same formulas to create a \"Chipotle style\" approach to Medditerranean cuisine.One interesting twist is that instead of setting prices based on protein, it's based on the style you want it served in. The cheapest option (unsurprisingly) is a Gyro, but you can also get your meal served over rice, as part of a salad, or in a big bowl (well, OK, it's technically a rectangular take out container) of hummus. That last one was a neat option for me on a day I was really craving some extra protein, but you get pretty good value with any of the options.You get your choice of proteins (Gyro meat, chicken, Shawarma, or Falafel) in the spice level of your choice (I found the \"Hot\" to be flavorful and spicy, but not too aggressive) and can add your choice of various veggie toppings or order sides to go with.Things are prepared right in front of you and generally put together very quickly, with things like falafel or fries being dropped to order. It's a good fast casual option, and everyone I've talked to there has been very upbeat and friendly. (After just three visits, I'm getting a warm \"welcome back!\" when I come in!)So where are my problems? Mostly in the pricing.. The base prices for entrees aren't terrible, ranging from $6.75-9, but then you run into a $1 upcharge for feta cheese, and a separate $1 upcharge if you'd like olives.Those are both staples of the cuisine, so why not just bump the prices of dishes by a dollar and make them regular options? Or offer a $1 upcharge for both?Sides are also oddly expensive - When you pay $7 for your gyro, for example, it's a bit daunting to pay another $5 for a side of fries or hummus.A tray of falafel for $4.50 isn't as bad (especially since you get a half dozen falafel to the order, but on the other hand I could just ask for double protein on my entree and have just as many falafel added, and save myself a couple of bucks.The offer of a 3 for $9 plate for appetizers isn't a bad solution if you're going in a group, but it's not really friendly pricing for a solo diner. Maybe they could look at offering half sized sides, and leave the larger portion as stand alone items?Regardless, I obviously think the food is worth going back for, and I do encourage you to check it out - just keep in mind that you may end up dropping a few more dollars than you would at some of the other Gyro shops in the area."], ["Bethany K.", "Not sure what to eat for lunch.... check yelp!Sababa is part of the new trend similar to Subway and Chipotle... pick your base and add the extras. \u00a0The difference between Sababa and the rest, Sababa is FRESH! \u00a0They make the falafel fresh right in front of you, and the rest of the ingredients are fresh as well! \u00a0The house dressing is AMAZING!I can't wait to try more of the menu.. I hope this restaurant does very well, and continues to expand."], ["Susan R.", "I don't go out to Blacklick often. Or at least, I PREVIOUSLY DID NOT go to Blacklick often, because Sababa is so dope that I now get out there every chance I get.When you walk in, if the owner's there, he asks if you've been in before. If you haven't, he feeds you with samples--meat or falafel, sauces, rice, so many tasty things. And everything is tasty. Everything. I don't even like falafel but I LOVE his falafel. (That sounds vaguely dirty but I'm rolling with it.) It's full of real chickpeas and moist and herbaceous and almost creamy in a great way. I also love every meat option. Gyro meat is great. Chicken is great. BOTH CHICKENS ARE GREAT. It's really to the point that I can't even decide which one I like best because they're so good. Their fries? Also good, which you wouldn't necessarily expect because it seems a bit of an outlier. They are crispy and browned just enough to be extra tasty and you can get toppings (FETA FRIES, HELL YES). I crave this food, full stop. So much that I kind of wish they had a sampler platter so I could just get a little of everything, every time. Because I would, and then I would roll myself out feeling so full but happily so."], ["Antonio T.", "Being from The South, one of the main things that I look for when I visit different restaurants is whether or not the food is well seasoned. This place definitely does not disappoint. To begin, Johnny is one of the best owners that you will ever meet. He was able to answer all of my questions and allowed me to sample almost everything on the menu before I made my purchase. All of the food and protein options available are very well seasoned and all of the other remaining ingredients are fresh and at the white church. I'm really enjoying a lot of the restaurants popping up in the city like Chipotle, Fusian, Bibibop and now Sababa, that allow you to pick and choose your ingredients and serve them to you almost instantly. I can honestly see this place opening many different locations throughout the city but, as of right now the only one is in Blacklick, which is close to me so I'm extremely happy. Once you have the opportunity, make sure you go and visit them soon. You can thank me later"], ["Gus W.", "My buddy and I saw a 'Coming Soon' sign for this place a couple months ago in the old Steak Escape spot on East Broad going toward Blacklick and were eager to give it a shot, since we love gyros, falafel, and all that jazz. It looked almost complete, but I don't think they opened until the past two weeks. Well, that's when I started seeing reviews pop up on here, so I knew it was time to check it out. Do you like Mezze? If so, then you will love this place, since it's almost entirely the same; all the way down to the taste and shape of the falafel. As for me, Mezze is one of my favorite lunch spots in Columbus, so I instantly fell in love with this place. The owner/manager was super friendly and offered everyone free samples of the meats without them asking. We didn't have a lot of time, so we opted for the gyro on a Greek style pita (Yes, they have Middle Eastern style just like Mezze). This place is essentially a Mediterranean Chipotle where you pick our your base (pita, rice, salad), proteins, toppings, and sauce. You can add olives, feta, and/or spice it up for a little extra (Mezze?). I went with the spicy sauce. Unlike Mezze, you go down the line picking out the veggies and toppings you want on your pita or bowl, just like in Chipotle. I ordered falafel along with the gyro, and the gyro was way more filling than I thought it would be, and I had to muscle down the falafel, which are served with a thin hummus. Everything was absolutely delicious. My buddy ordered the same thing but had fries instead and thought it was great as well. He made a comment though that I had to agree with saying that if you blindfolded him, he wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Sababa and Mezze. To me, this is a good thing, since I love Mezze, but a bad thing for Mezze, since this is a bit closer to my work.The only issue I ran into, is that they don't offer foil or a piece of paper to wrap around the pita to make it easier to eat, and the house sauce and hot sauce are both pretty thin, and it made a mess everywhere, including my shirt. Be prepared! That is my suggestion to them, and they should really think about it! Parking is super easy to find, since the tiny strip mall they're in has plenty. If you're a fan of Mezze and live on the East or Southeast side, then you'll find yourself having a very similar and tasty experience at Sababa. As for me, I'll be back often (so sorry, Mezze!).EDIT: Apparently this is owned by the same guy that owns (owned) Mezze which makes a whole lot of sense, but why change the name if you're doing the exact same thing ?? I'm assuming he must not be the owner of Mezze anymore, because that makes no sense."], ["Greg W.", "Chipotle Greek food sums this place up in terms of both quality and style.My personal favorite is the white rice base with the gyro meat, with a close second being the hummus base and chicken. One of the other nice touches is you get to pick a level of heat with the sauce they grill your meat in. There are three levels, so if you prefer a spicier meat, go for it. While I typically prefer spicier foods, with the gyro meat I like to keep it on the more tame heat, because it lets me focus more on the flavor of the meat. I like to do double meat too, but you'll get ample food regardless. Out of the five times I've been there, the owner has been there three of them, and he's always very fun, polite and personable. He loves the food and takes it very personally, and his passion shows.The only two negatives that I've had can hardly even be called that (or even their problem). Firstly, lunch time gets VERY busy. If you're not there by 11:30-11:45, don't bother unless you have a lot of time on your hands. A lot of local professionals pack this place because the food really is that good. The other is the parking. There just isn't much of it around that lunch time, once you factor in all of the other businesses in the strip."], ["Ryan P.", "This is my favorite place to eat!!

At most resturant it tastes like hay, but not here. It's made to order, which requires me to wait on my food, but it's completely worth it. As a pescatarian, Greek can be a challenging food type, unless I want to buy a veggie pita or hummus. Not anymore! I've been here twice already even though this location has only been open a few months. I've gotten the dip trio once and the fire feta dip only on my second visit. It was amazing as well. Pass on the baklava though. It's good but the portions are small for the price."], ["Sara D.", "I started with a pita, got the medium spice shawarma, added cabbage salad, banana peppers, red onion, lettuce, cucumbers, and their Greek sauce.

It seemed a bit understaffed the day we went since one girl was in charge of the bulk of the beginning of the ordering process with a long line on a Saturday around noon. I think the oil was a little too hot bc the outside of my falafel was cooked good but the inside was a tad undercooked. There's no kids menu. One order of fries was big enough for our family of 5 to share. With our Groupon and additional costs, it was $45 but I left feeling over indulgenced."], ["Adam L.", "Its essentially Chipotle only Greek, but the Greek fries are amazing but perhaps with a bit to much Feta Cheese, and the ingredients are hella fresh. The atmosphere could use some work though, contemporary greek chill music perhaps. It seems family owed so theres a nice local flavor there. First,Chipotle, then Piada, and now this. Surely someones making a Jamaican street food location? Or at least afro-cuban? Just a thought. Oh and its pretty filling for around $15-$20. I wouldve also liked to have seen a bit of Uzo being served as well. Oh well. Cheers!"], ["Ali H.", "I had no expectations coming in the doors here. I was pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the staff. I am very loyal to a particular greek place on Hamilton Rd. \u00a0Sababa has made me want to explore my options a bit. \u00a0It was so good. My dining partner enjoyed their meal as much as I did. I will say I thought it was a little expensive but the amount of food you get make is worth it.

Heard about this place so thought Id give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by all the selections. The chicken flavored with curry was amazing as was the lentil rice.

I was really excited to see all of the great reviews about the place too. However I was very disappointed. I ordered the chicken with rice all of the toppings besides pickles, feta cheese, house sauce, and I also asked for spicy. I took a bite and I did not taste any spice, I actually think they forget to add it. It wasn't very flavorful to me. Everyone that works there are very friendly. They were very helpful to everyone who had questions about their menu and their food. They even were allowing people to taste things off from their menu before they ordered. I did like that.Will I be going back? Probably not anytime soon...."], ["Lauren M.", "This place is almost a five star review for me- and I have a feeling that eventually it will be. I have been here twice now and feel ready to comment. I love the food, and I love the setup. However, there are a few kinks that need addressed before this place will really be fluid.On both visits I have ordered a pita. On the second visit I was presented with a size choice- a smaller thicker pita (Greek I believe) or a larger thinner pita (Middle Eastern?). I am not sure if this is always an option, as this has not been consistent. I'm also a little disappointed that they aren't made from scratch- but I think I've been getting spoiled by a shop near my work. After you place your order for a pita, you turn the corner and order your meat. Both visits I have ordered chicken- my husband has tried the gyro. I believe they have two different types of chicken- one with garlic and oregano and another with curry. However, I am not clear on this. My husband mentioned that it would be helpful if they had some sort of sign or label denoting choices all throughout this process. This is also the point that you need to speak up if you want spice added. I believe they have three levels of spice- I have only tried the mild. \u00a0The first visit this was offered, the second it was not.Next are toppings. They have an awesome selection, but again, nothing is labeled. Most of it is easily identifiable- but if you are new to this type of food maybe not. The house sauce is delicious, neither of us have tried anything else. I find this place to be a MUCH welcomed addition to our neighborhood, and plan on being a weekly visitor. I really hope the little kinks are streamlined soon, as the food is worth coming back for, and often.I'm not sure if the lack of signage is an attempt at simplicity or if they are trying to \u00a0create a more upscale environment. It would be helpful to have more guidance or more consistency then is presently offered. Asking questions would also be much simpler if the music was not so loud you cannot communicate efficiently with the staff.Also noted:They also have two varieties of rice- but they are not labeled anywhere, and I cannot remember the names."], ["Majida Z.", "It was ok ! it's a take on fast food middle eastern style the chipotle way same type of set up"], ["Jessica V.", "Do yourself a favor and eat here. Not only is the food delicious but the man that owns this place is awesome as well. Such a great atmosphere and so welcoming. Three of us got there about 30 minutes before closing and I didn't feel rushed at all even though we finished after closing time. This was my first experience here and I got the gyro salad and everything about it was amazing. It was juicy and seasoned perfectly.

Loaded up with veggies and kalamata olives (mine only), added an order of fries (great!) and stuffed grape leaves (wow!), but would have had plenty of food with just the pita wraps. The pita wraps are big (think Chipotle burrito), and you get to customise it the way you want it from adding spice to your protein, to selecting your veggies and dressing. The fries are like something from the fair (step up from Five Guys). The grape leaves were tender, full of flavour and delicious. And don't get me started on the baklava! Yum!Johnny (owner) is constantly offering samples. He wants you to know what you want (or what you will come back for next time!). He truly wants to offer great food to his customers.

Chipotle, Bibibop, and Piada are all good once in awhile, but you want to support something locally as well. Luckily, Brassica has filled that void with Mediterranean cuisine that both looks and tastes appetizing. One of my friends in the Short North Running Club opened the place, and invited me to try out Northstar Cafe's newest spinoff.The chalkboard menu is nicely laid out with an option for pita or a salad with plenty of topping options for vegetarians and non along with a professional staff that is very knowledgeable. I ended up getting a pita packed with falafel, hummus, and an assortment of tasty side veggies. What impressed me in particular is that they had both a house dressing mixed in with the greens to give the food authentic flavor. Also, there is a special sauce that are a great dip with the Brassica fries seasoned with sumac. Moreover, for those that choose to dine in, they have a brass ring that holds the pita sandwich nicely together and classy wood trays that match the restaurant decor.Hands down, Columbus is a beer town that loves its microbreweries. Brassica shares the passion for craft beer lovers and has a nice local selection that pairs nicely with your pita/salad. Seating is ideal for couples at Brassica, so be sure to bring your date or significant other for a casual and reasonably priced dining experience."], ["Emily L.", "So, I thought about getting a late snack. I did. I went to Brassica because I enjoy a tasty hummus and pita every so often. This place is quite divine. The intimate space and seating, mostly wood, looked simple and organic yet very elegant. This restaurant has a lovely, romantic appeal with dim lights, a red brick wall, and glass-looking paintings. I especially appreciated the wall painting of a pink brassica! I like that the restaurant used it as the inspiration for its name.The wall menu, a chalkboard, by the entrance, lists the choice of pita salads, sandwiches, and bowls. The food sits behind a glass counter where a server scoops the vegetables, hummus, and sauces to create our to-go order. The pita is whole wheat and tasty! That is amazing. The hummus has a creamy texture with a satisfying olive oil taste. The falafels taste crisp and tender, which I love and enjoy with the hummus. Anyone who enjoys Mediterranean food should come at least once. I find this place a mixed purpose for a date, a friend, or family members. Whatever the occasion, Brassica has friendly people who serve delicious, light meals in a simple, beautiful setting."], ["Lea P.", "After two visits, I'm ready to say, \"Yea Brassica.\" Or \"Yay Brassica.\"I was very unsure the first time I came. I was unclear on what exactly was supposed to come with what. Rather than a buffet-behind-the-counter that other assembly line eateries constitute, this felt more like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" without the page numbers. I ended up with food on my plate, and it was pretty good, but I wasn't sure whether I had been entitled to more veggies (when they said \"toppings,\" did it mean the proteins or everything, for instance?) or why some of the veggies came before the sauces and some came after. I was letting friendly the employees guide me with their \"Would you like...?\" offers, but it didn't keep me from feeling a bit puzzled about how that meal ended up in front of me.So it took a second visit to get all this down. That's often the case with assembly lines, before you know what your food options are. Now I understand that the rice and lentils are supposed to go in the salad (but why? where is the rice and lentil side? can we not have them in a sandwich with hummus?) and I understand that the veggies are all really tasty (not a bad one in the bunch, but I think the weakest were the \"spicy\" carrots and the strongest was the marinated eggplant).Now that I'll be ordering with a little more confidence, I think I'll enjoy the meal more, but I believe I need to work out the flavor combos a bit better, too. I asked for practically everything but the kitchen sink on my salad, and I don't think it really ended up tasting like a salad so much as a bunch of sides all in the same dish. There was no blending, but I'm also not so sure I wanted these flavors to blend. It was like going to a party with a lot of fascinating people who will all talk to you but not to each other.The fries were awesome. I think what was most awesome was that they weren't trying to mingle with the other parts of my meal.Now that I understand Brassica, I look forward to enjoying a lot more of Brassica, but I'm just hoping that at some point I find that combo of food that actually works together."], ["Jillian M.", "All the good news you've heard about this place is true. Came here for lunch on a weekday with some coworkers -- we got there at 11:10 and we were the first in line. By noon, it was slammed, so get here early! There are already a ton of positive reviews for this place, so here are a few of my notes in bullet point style:* Are you a vegetarian or just a lover of all things veggie? This place is for you! I had the brisket, but there were so many delicious veggie toppings on it that I could barely taste it. Get the veggie option -- it's cheaper and just as good!* The iced tea was just ok... it had a weird aftertaste, so go for the lemonade or soda instead.* This place is a bit cramped around the drink station/checkout area. Come early or at an off time if you are looking to dine in.* The fries were good, but not really worth the price point. The pita was more than enough for me to eat for lunch. No leftovers, but also just the right amount of full. *Get the 'hot' cilantro sauce. It's not really that spicy, and it is SO GOOD!* They have a few local draft beer options too!This place was delicious, and I didn't even get to try all of the veggie toppings because I was running out of room on my pita. I had the baba on mine, so I'd love to come back and try the hummus next time. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others, or take guests from out of town here for an affordable meal! I WILL BE BACK!"], ["Nk C.", "Atmosphere- very young and fresh. I like the materials/finishes that they used. The register area can get really congested because the self serve drinks are all in that area. Sitting is limited. They do have a standing bar area, so if you don't mind standing, go for that. Service- A. You can get in and out in 10 minutes. Food- the pita option can get messy so I opt for the salad option. The flavor consistency is good and the eggplant is consistently salty (what's up with that). Brisket has too much fat for me. The lamb bacon is okay and the real winner is the chicken. My advice- get a little bit of every toppings except for the eggplant if it's your first time. You can get your dressing on the side, which I highly recommend. Z'hug and special sauce is worth a try. This place is good for a fast meal."], ["Arvid Y.", "I'm sorry Bibibop, i've cheated on you. There's a new fast-casual restaurant in my life and her name is Brassica. She's healthy, easy on the eyes, classy, but still very approachable.There are a few Mediterranean options in the Short North district (Firdous Express and The Happy Greek) but this is the first fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant in the area. As compared to other fast-casual Mediterranean restaurants (Sababa and Mezze), Brassicca kicks it up a notch in terms of ambiance and ingredients. It's not surprising that Brassica shares the same ownership as Northstar Cafe. The interior design of the restaurant, the attention to detail and food execution is top notch.The restaurant is visually pleasing with its stainless steel assembly line, marble countertops and brick walls. The engraved wooden trays and circular metal pita holders also add some class to this \"fast-casual\" dining experience.From a pricing standpoint, it's a bit more expensive than other fast-casual eateries, but not by much. Wraps start at $7.50, with salads being an additional $2. The portions are also fairly generous.What sets Brassica apart from other Mediterranean restaurants are the ingredients. Where else can you get toppings such as pickled cabbage, sweet beets, cukes, marinated eggplant, jalapeno cauliflower and roasted carrots? Combined with your choice of 5 different sauces and cheese, the combinations are endless!The freshly baked whole wheat pita are amazingly soft and fluffy. So far i've stuck with the brisket as my protein of choice. It's tender and flavorful. With such quality ingredients and attractive atmosphere, I don't mind spending a few extra dollars for this dining experience. And the love affair continues..."], ["Bryant M.", "I wrote an email to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman to ask for a sixth star to give Brassica......No, no I didn't. Because that would be insane. But you get it -- hopefully that dramatic intro proves how much I love the newest concept from the Northstar folks. It's no secret that Northstar (the ShoNo location to be exact) was my favorite 10 years ago when I landed in Columbus and continues to be my favorite today. Maybe it's their clean design... or maybe it's the lovely staff... no, it's definitely the picture-perfect food... wait, it's really how the whole experience is stellar each and every time. And if for some reason it falls short, the staff is proactive and empowered to make it right. Well take all that and apply it to a fast-casual, vegetable-heavy, Middle Eastern restaurant -- and that's Brassica.The first time I walked in, I was mesmerized by the interior. Maybe it was because I was so intimately familiar with the former tenant (RIP Betty's), but this place went through a complete overhaul. Lots of wood, green tiles, and gold everywhere. It doesn't look like everywhere else these days, and in the words of Martha Stewart, that's \"a good thing.\" Sure, the space is small, but they really make fantastic use of what they have. It's like the TARDIS in there. When it comes to the food, it's fast-casual cafeteria-style. I refuse to call Brassica the _____ of Middle Eastern. First, I hate that place (gasp!); second, I think it's insulting to every other restaurant who simply has a similar style of serving. Ordering is simple. You choose:A) A sandwich, made of homemade pita (that's literally made seconds before you walked in)B) A hummus plateC) A saladNo matter which option you choose, you'll load it up with a selection of: hummus, baba, rice & lentils, protein (lamb bacon, brisket, chicken, or falafel), veggies, and sauce.About those veggies... These are not fillers. They are the star of the show! Please allow me to fanboy for a minute: On the shelf at Brassica is a small display of curated cookbooks, which I'm taking to be a sign of inspiration. Several of the books are from the famous chef, Yotam Ottolenghi, who is Jerusalem-born and owns several Middle Eastern-inspired restaurants in the UK. Ottolenghi makes vegetables sing like no one else I know, and I had the best meal of my life at one of his spots in London. So, yeah, I lost my mind when I realized the Brassica-Ottolenghi connection. And trust me, the veggies here don't disappoint. Beets, red cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, eggplant--all beautifully, expertly, and deliciously prepared. And you can add them ALLLLLL to your meal.When you near the end of the line. It's time to make three important decisions. Let me make them easy for you:1. Would you like a side of fries? YES. The fries here are seasoned and cooked perfectly. Some of the best in the city.2. Would you like a side of special sauce? YES. Put it on everything.3. What would you like to drink? There is no answer other than BEET MINT LEMONADE. Trust me on this one. If you can't tell, I'm in love with Brassica. It has already entered my regular rotation, and I crave it so much that I'm willing to play The Hunger Games: Short North Parking Edition just to eat here. TL;DR Brassica is the latest concept from the same people as Northstar. It's fast-casual, Middle Eastern-inspired, with loads of delicious veggie options. Everything is fresh and from scratch, and it's an easy 5 stars."], ["Gus W.", "I've never been the biggest fan of Northstar Cafe, but they've rolled out a pretty brilliant new restaurant in Brassica. The concept itself, fast casual, isn't new, and not even fast casual Mediterranean (see: Mezze and Sababa), but the ingredients are just so much different than other places, it's definitely worth noting. I can see how the lines can get backed up out the door, since the ordering counter is right at the entrance, and the manager that runs it has been giving his spiel about the place to everyone that hasn't been before. I get it. It's an assembly line. Everything's ridiculously fresh. I passed on the story, but I'm kidding, he really is a very nice guy! I imagine the lines will go down after a few weeks, or they'll at least be quicker at moving people through.For my meal, I had to try the sandwich right off the bat, and I went with the brisket, even though both the chicken and glazed bacon looked amazing. There's so many different toppings here like pickled cabbage, sweet beets, onion straws, and a cauliflower/jalapeno mix (which was surprisngly awesome) that it's hard to not have your dish overflowing by the time you get to the end of the line. The house sauce and jalapeno sauce were both awesome, and even though I had all these ingredients in my pita, it held together throughout the whole meal. This may be the only time you ever hear me say this, but I think liked my girlfriend's salad with the chicken shawarma even more than mine. The chicken was amazing, the salad is very fresh with lemon and salt added, and the bottom of the bowl is lined with lentils. It was huge, and she couldn't finish it, but I smashed the rest of it the next day. It was still just as good. There is a $2 up charge for a salad, however. I guess the lentils are that expensive? Don't know.The fries were delicious, but I'm not sure if they're worth $3.50 for the amount you get. I can get really good fries at places like those at Sababa and Mezze for less than that with double the portions. Don't expect to really split this with someone if you're hungry.I was behaved and only ordered the sandwich and the pita, but it really took all of me to not try the falafel and hummus, since they looked so good. I'll definitely be back here soon, and it's really nice to have a fast casual place in the Short North other than Chipotle."], ["Cristin S.", "This place is a great fast casual concept! They have so many different options! I love that there is more than the standard lettuce, tomato, hummus offerings. I really loved the special sauce! I wish I would have gotten it on the side so I could have controlled how much I put on. The only reason I am taking away a star is they were out of brisket. I really wish I could have got the brisket pita with the delicious sauce! But I will certainly be back!"], ["Siobhan G.", "Just went here for the first time tonight! I have been excited to try Brassica. Anytime there is a new, quick, somewhat healthy option that is delicious - my day is made! I loved the decor and lay out. It's a really cute place, even the way the food was presented was clever and pretty. Brassica is not trying to reinvent the Chipotle wheel, they are just adding a new flavor to it. You can choose between the pita, salad or hummus plate. Then you choose your meat - Chicken Shawarma, Brisket or Lamb Bacon. The Lamb bacon looked incredible, I really want to try this! After your meat you start down the veggie, cheese, sauce and dressing line and they really have some neat options here. I don't usually like eggplant but I actually really enjoyed theirs. The fried jalapenos and onions were also delicious and added a nice little crunch to the salad I ordered. Also, make sure you try the spicy carrots those were slammin! The only complaint I have is my salad was a little salty. I am not sure if it was the lentil mixture they put on or another veggie I chose but I think it could have done with a little less salt. The portion size was also really big. I wish there was an option to get a smaller salad that was a little cheaper. I am not sure why the salad is priced $2 higher than the pita? However, for how fresh and flavorful all their ingredients are I am ok with it being a little more expensive than other quick service restaurants.They have a bunch of different sides that all looked so good I had a hard time choosing one. I ended up trying the Brassica Fries that are served with their special sauce. Oh baby.. those were tasty! The special sauce is also really good, went great with the Cajun spices on the fries. They have organic sodas for their fountain drinks, I had the diet cola and thought it was pretty good. They also have juices in a little fridge and I am wondering if they make the juices themselves or get it from somewhere else nearby? Tip - Find the little red hot sauce by the drink station and put it on ALL your food. It's fantastic! I'll definitely be back soon!"], ["Sam P.", "Brassica is awesome and I'm pretty sure that we'll be going there often. Before getting to all of the reasons it is great however, I'm going to list the two negatives. Then I will join in what appears to be a swelling chorus of praise. 1. The salad option costs an extra $2. If you're not paying attention, you may overlook this fact. It's also unclear WHY there is an added cost. It doesn't make sense based on the overall model and I hope it changes. 2. Seating is going to be an issue. There's a little bit up front and a little bit in back. Once word gets out, it's going to be packed during peak times. And, oh is word going to get out. The food here is delicious! The ingredients are all flavorful and of high quality. Start with the pita. It's baked fresh, which if not obvious from taste alone, is confirmed by the very prominent oven up front. You then get your pick of ingredients to fill it. Either \u00a0hummus or baba ganoush can be smeared on the inside prior to the meat options. Having only visited once thus far, I can affirmatively say that the chicken is great and the others (brisket, bacon, falafel) LOOK great. Next, choice of veggies and sauces. The pickled red cabbage and cucumber & radishes are both nice additions and provide a great tang. I skipped the beets, not being a beet man myself. You can choose from a variety of sauces as well. The house sauce is quite good, but there are other options including tahini and red pepper sauce. Also a hot sauce. Then more vegetables! Cooked eggplant, and sweet and spicy carrots are options. I didn't try them, they kind of came as a surprise because I initially expected that all of the vegetables came before the sauce options. Also offered is a cauliflower and jalapeno combination. Get it! It's really really good and provided a great flavor that tied everything together quite well. We didn't try the fries or other sides. Nor did we get a soda. I might have gotten the latter had I realized that they have a variety of interesting options. There's always next time. And there will be a next time. The food is perfectly executed and I'm sure that we'll be back soon. My dining companion proclaimed with no hesitation that Brassica is hands down her favorite restaurant in the Short North."], ["Zeb L.", "One of the best places I've visited in Columbus. Brisket and fries are not exactly traditional Mediterranean fare, but they're delicious, so what does it matter? Furthermore, they mix perfectly with hummus and all of the other fare offered by Brassica. Lines are going to be a problem with this place, but I can't fault a place for being both popular and good."], ["Anna S.", "After my first trip, I already know that I'm going to be obsessed with this place. \u00a0Went here after yoga last week for a pseudo-healthy takeout dinner and ordered a chicken bowl. \u00a0And I totally geeked out over the amazing veggies. \u00a0Roasted carrots! \u00a0Shredded beets! \u00a0Cauliflower salad! Yum! \u00a0Additionally, the chicken was tender (thigh meat) and spicy and the baba tasty. Lastly, I nabbed a pink mint lemonade and while it was super tart/sweet, it was quite enjoyable after I added some water and ice. \u00a0 I can't wait to come back and try the falafel and the lamb bacon. \u00a0A great addition to the SN!"], ["Rami M.", "Brassica is awesica. \u00a0Everything about it is amazing: the customer service, the organization and layout of the restaurant, and of course, the food. \u00a0I got the salad, with pretty much every topping (meat and veggies) and every sauce (and hummus). \u00a0Everything was top notch. \u00a0The lamb bacon was probably my favorite (and most unique) component of my dish, but the brisket, falafel, and chicken were also great. \u00a0My favorite veggie was probably the carrots (perfectly roasted and sweet), but I also loved the cauliflower, eggplants, and beets! \u00a0I think the next time I go, I'll choose only one or maybe two meat toppings. \u00a0The drinks are also great- I got a beet lemonade and it was so refreshing! \u00a0I do want to try the fresh pita next time (and there will be many future visits!)!"], ["Sara C.", "*sniff sniff* \u00a0What is that smell? \u00a0It's not the Mediterranean spices (that's just leftover in my sweater)... it must be hype!I had a lunch meet up here a few days ago and have to say -- the people watching here is stellar. \u00a0I had a pita with baba and the glazed bacon, various vegetables, and tzatsiki sauce on the side. \u00a0I also tried the mint lemonade. \u00a0I think the combination that I had was too much together -- there were a lot of strong flavors with the pickles and the glaze and the eggplant so I ended up mostly picking it apart with a fork. \u00a0Based on the rave reviews I was expecting to be blown away by the bacon, but I wasn't. \u00a0The pita was the best part of the sandwich, though I might go with the salad next time just so I can separate out the flavors (though I'm not a fan of the upcharge for lentils). \u00a0Maybe I'm just too pessimistic about some of the recent additions to the Columbus dining scene (chorus of \"yes, you are\"). \u00a0It is definitely a bit pricier than some of the other fast casual options available, and I'm not too keen on dropping $13-15 on lunch very often; however, this place seems to appeal to plenty of other people, and I'm sure there will be lines out the door for quite some time."], ["Hua R.", "This place is amazing!! Gives off a great vibe as soon as you walk in, not to mention the wondrous aroma from those Mediterranean spices.Best option/deal seems to be the \"sandwich\", a pita with your choice of babaganoush or hummus to be slathered inside; then choose a protein - the brisket is awesome! followed by a wide selection of artisan prepared veggie toppings - I really liked the jalape\u00f1o cauliflower, pile on as many veggies options as you want; finished off by your choice of sauce - I highly recommend the z'hug, it's kinda spicy & oh so good! How are you gonna wash it all down, why the beet mint lemonade of course.. Beets, Bears, Battlestar Galactic Seating can be an issue, so beat the lunch rush or dinner crowd, and grab a spot to nom-nom-nom. Watch out though, this place is addicting.. enjoy!"], ["Amanda G.", "I was invited by management to dine at Brassica again this week.This time we went in for dinner, around 5:30 - just beat the crowd! I ordered a salad bowl with chicken and lots of fixings - I would recommend the cauliflower and jalapenos. It was really good! The chicken was seasoned perfectly: warm, slightly smokey, a little spicy. My boyfriend ordered a hummus plate with brisket which he enjoyed as well.We waited quite awhile at the counter as the couple in front of us ordered falafel and they had to make more. The running-out of falafel seemed to cause a bit of confusion/congestion in the line for both the customers and staff. Though I am happy to report that the flies that pestered us during our last visit were gone.What else did I notice this time around?A noteworthy point about the menu. While I initially likened Brassica to a Chipotle-style system, the pricing system is slightly different. At Chipotle, you're charged by the protein, whether its assembled as tacos, a burrito or a bowl - all toppings are included (except guac). At Brassica, you're charged by the protein - but there is an $2 up-charge for a salad. Also, as we were told last night, if you order the hummus plate instead of a pita or a salad, you don't get the full selection of toppings - but you do get a piece of pita bread.Overall - again, I think Brassica has good food, but I it's not my first choice for quick and delicious Mediterranean."], ["Jen R.", "What a cool place! Have heard so much about it and was in the area on Sunday. Stopped in to see what all the hype is about and left extremely satisfied. I wasn't really sure what to expect. It's kind of like a Chipotle concept for Mediterranean food, which is awesome. Everything behind the glass looked so delicious. My hubby and I split the baba (one of my fave foods) and a brisket sandwich. I requested my sandwich be filled with more baba and a ton of yummy veggies and sauce. Everything was very fresh and flavorful and the brisket was really tender. The homemade pitas were delicious and also stayed together without crumbling under the weight of all the toppings I filled it with. Can't wait to come back and try the same ingredients in a rice bowl or on a salad!"], ["Serena H.", "I've been here twice in a week.Essentially its a chipotle styled Mediterranean joint. Great quality ingredients. I swear your mouth will be watering before it's time for you to pay. I suggest getting the pita sandwich with the chicken and add everything. You heard me right, EVERYTHING. \u00a0Personally I think the chicken is much more flavorful than the brisket. 10 bucks and your stomach will thank you.This is a great place to take visitors from out of town...kinda funky, delicious food, quality service, and in the heart of the short north. I suggest hopping over to Jeni's to top off the meal just right."], ["Stephanie K.", "I was pleased to see the owners of North Star were opening a restaurant with prices that are much more reasonable than those found at Norh Star. \u00a0I was also pleased to find that the food is better at Brassica too!First let's start off by warning you that there is no signage when you try to find this place. I don't get this stupid hipster trend shared by the likes of places like Fox in the Snow Cafe. You want people to spend money at your establishment right? Then help them find the front freaking door. The Mediterranean themed food here is quite good. I had the falafel hummus plate. Really tasty stuff. The Brassica fries were nice seasoned fries served with a delicious homemade ketchup. The serving line to get the food was kind of not well thought out. Tiny trays of brass and cast iron showcased the ingredients in mini quantities of like a cupful. There was a large line because these trays emptied quickly with each customers order. I appreciate preparing food in a fresh manner and in batches, but they really should just have large vats of food to help out with the wait.The restaurant itself has space issues. It's smaaaaall. People were bumping into each other left and right.Decor is hip and modern with touches of wood, brass, and marble found throughout."], ["Katie B.", "As a millennial, I must admit I love these fast casual places where I can build a meal right in front of my face. \u00a0(Bibibop, Moe's, Pizza Cucinova, etc). \u00a0What's better is I popped in here for a late lunch so it was mostly empty except for a few tables. \u00a0I got the hummus plate with half hummus, half baba topped with brisket. \u00a0My only hang up was the brisket was a little salty and \u00a0I could have used a little more pita to mop up the generous helpings of hummus and baba. \u00a0All in all the dips mellows out the salt of the brisket and I was there for a \"light\" lunch so fewer carbs on the plate was probably a good thing. \u00a0I really wanted to dive into some of the other toppings, but that will have to wait for trips 2-999. \u00a0I cannot wait to try more of this bright, fresh , menu!"], ["Jamie S.", "Delicious fast, casual Mediterranean concept.

Delish!"], ["Brutus D.", "New favorite place in the Short North for a casual-yet-very-delicious meal. Ironically, they beat out the Northstar Cafe for this honor.

I'm not a meat eater, but from what I've heard the bacon is unreal. All the vegetables seem fresh and crisp (and are definitely delicious) and the pita is baked at the front of the restaurant so it comes out hot.I naturally opt for the hummus plate because it always yields leftovers in my case. It's also the perfect consistency and prepared with all the right spices.I've seen a few complaints about the prices but in my experience, I think what I pay is very fair.My only problem is deciding between regular hummus and the baba, which is also to die for."], ["Cortney L.", "The food was all fresh, delicious, and organic. \u00a0However the staff is slow and getting adjusted to working the new restaurant. \u00a0I hope the service gets better because the food is great and the interior is beautiful."], ["Shivang P.", "The people who created the hugely popular Northstar Cafe and Third & Hollywood have done it again with Brassica! A higher end, fast-casual, Mediterranean place, Brassica has delicious, clean, and well-seasoned food--not surprising for a restaurant that makes their own pita bread right in front of your eyes. All the components of their food taste fresh and are thoughtfully created. Brassica is the name of the genus to which common foods such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi belong. Some of these are also incorporated in their salads and sandwiches. Not only does one notice the fresh pita bread baking, but also the attention to detail in the design of the restaurant. There is a very profound and exquisite dichotomy in design. The kitchen half of the restaurant has very vivid colors, sharp lines, marble structures and countertops, bright lights, and an openness that highlights Brassica's cleanliness and professionalism. This contrasts the warm and inviting dining area which is composed of beautiful wood, soft yellow lighting, spherical and circular decorations, and brass--a creative and thoughtful play on the establishment's name. I highly recommend going to Brassica, then going again and again and again."], ["Natasha F.", "Absolutely amazing!!

Its atmosphere is a bit too far gone on the sterilization kick, all bleach white and polished chrome and... eck. Too bright, too clean, too unnatural.

I ordered the tuna pita and immediatly remembered the last time I had tuna at Aladdin's. It was just terrible.

The hummos plate is another great option for an appetizer, or if you're just not terribly hungry. The only dish I've gotten from Aladdin's that I wasn't particularly fond of was the chicken schwarma rolled- the chicken was a bit tough and the sauce was somewhat cold, and it overall just didn't rock my socks.

Upon entering, you are pleasantly surprised by how beautifully decorated the dining room is. White table cloths, pleasant lighting, friendly staff that welcomes you like an old friend. I think this might be where some of the disconnect comes on the prices. Typically, we expect ethnic places to be, well, let's just say less than beautifully appointed, therefore we expect lower prices. I think it should be noted that Cafe Shish Kebab is a full service restaurant, not the typical strip-mall restaurant with harsh lighting and wobbly tables.For me, I don't mind spending a few extra dollars to enjoy a wonderful meal in a fabulous setting.I have had the opportunity to travel to Istanbul so I have first hand experience of how wonderfully fresh and delicous Turkish food is. Cafe Shish Kebab does not disappoint. They have an extensive list of mezze (what they call appetizers in Turkey) both hot and cold. My least favorite of all is the pinto bean mixture but my favorites are the cacik (yogurt and cucumber - similar to Greek tzatziki), stuffed grape leaves and tabouli.The entree list is just as extensive, but I can't seem to stray from any form of kebab. Perhaps when the weather gets cooler, I'll be tempted to venture into some of the full entrees like stuffed eggplant, moussaka or some of the delicious sounding stews but for now, kebabs are my go to. If you love kebab or are new to Turkish food, do yourself a favor and go either one of the kebab samplers. There are 2 on the menu, one option is a pick 2, the other option is pre-determined 4 kebab sampler.My personal favorties from the Cafe Shish Kebab menu are the Shish Kebab (marinated cubes of lamb), Kofte (ground beef and lamb), Donor (essentially gyro meat - beef and lamb cooked on a rotisserie), Adana (ground lamb). My next trip I plan to try the Spicy Beyti. I have never tried any of the chicken kebabs so can not comment. I can and do cook chicken about 4 times a week so I rarely order chicken when dining out.All kebab dinners come with a deliciously fluffy, slightly seasoned, white rice and few grilled vegetables (peppers, tomatoes) and of course, all meals are served with delicious complimentary pide bread (oh how I wish they would make the Turkish pizzas, also called pide, from this mouthwaterning bread) and served with a wonderfuly flavored oil based dipping sauce.If you like a little extra kick, be sure to ask for a side of their not-over-the-top hot sauce to drizzle over the bread, kebabs or any where else you'd like to slather it.As I'm not a dessert fan - I have nothing to add to this but I do enjoy ending the meal with a Turkish coffee.Service is attentive but at times a bit \"slow\" by American standards, but for lunch you can still get in and out in under an hour. A full service bar is a nice touch, as is Turkish imported raki (called Lion's Milk because of the milky color it turns when served over ice which is traditional in Turkey), similar in taste to ouzo or sambuca it is meant to be sipped throughout the meal. You can also order Turkish beer (Effe if recall?) if you aren't a fan of the anise flavored raki.Two thumbs up for this fabulous little gem!"], ["Danielle F.", "I am not very familiar with Turkish food, so I have no idea if this is what Turkish food is supposed to taste like. But I can tell you, the food is incredible.First of all, if you have a chance, go for lunch during the week. They have an incredible lunch special. You get your choice of appetizer, entree, and the house dessert of the day for about $10. I calculated it out, and if had ordered what I had for lunch yesterday straight off the menu, it would have cost about $24. My check was $10.62.This restaurant is in a strip mall. It's called \"Cafe Shish Kebab.\" I walked in expecting a cheap little kebab place. I was pretty surprised to see the really beautiful, elegant, high class atmosphere. It's truly beautiful inside.I think I've been to Cafe Shish Kebab four or five times, and I've always left happy. First of all, as pretty much every other reviewer has mentioned, they serve killer bread with an incredible dipping sauce. I usually take it home with me, my grandfather was a huge fan of the bread leftovers!!I have tried their Chicken Lemon and their Lentil soup. Both are excellent. The kebabs, stews, and the Sultans Favorite dish are all great. The desserts are wonderful. Yesterday, the house dessert special was almond pudding. I loved it.The service is always great. They are very nice. Thinking back, I think I've tipped on average 30-35% there because of how exceptionally pleased I've always been.Their turkish tea is also delicious, comes with free refills, and is served in beautiful tea glasses.I highly recommend this restaurant.

Don't be shy about asking for more - they'll continuously oblige. Coming here is worth it just for the bread.I usually get the kebab combo with the chicken adana & regular (lamb) kebab. Comes with rice pilaf and a side of veggies. Chicken adana is my favorite - tender, spicy, and flavorful. The restaurant itself is very nice and classy inside which makes for a pleasant dining atmosphere. Service is attentive too."], ["Courtney A.", "Decent Mediterranean place that I would definitely support if I lived here - Turkish pride! We got the Adana Kebab, some cigora borek and bayti - the last was absolutely the best. Good spiciness to the lamb and nice flavors. Owners were very kind and I even got some free tea as we waited. Some of the entrees seem a little pricey, but I'll be back!"], ["Matthew Z.", "Slightly on the expensive side if you're grabbing a quick bite. However, the food is delicious, and it's unique enough that it's worth the visit.I was there during lunchtime on a Saturday, and it wasn't too crowded. \u00a0(I believe there was a Buckeye game that day, which probably had something to do with it.) \u00a0The service was fast, and the pita bread was scrumptious. \u00a0I ordered some lamb with rice, which had a rich flavor and good texture. \u00a0The entree portion and taste is on par with the other Mediterranean/Turkish restaurants in the area.Overall: \u00a0It's a nice place. \u00a0Give it a try sometime."], ["Morgan D.", "Shish Kebab is kind of the new buzz word with people I know. I got a chance to check it out for myself on Sunday when I attended a birthday dinner.I'm the kind of person who must find an online version of the menu before going in; I like to know what I'm getting into. I was excited to see all the vegetarian appetizers, hot and cold. They also have three veggie dishes, but they were pretty much all cooked vegetables, and for fear of mush stew, I strayed. I couldn't decide which appetizers to gorge on, so I made a meal out of the sampler platter (hummus, Patlican Salatasi, Yaprak Dolmasi, Ezme, Kisir, Pilaki, Haydari, and Soslu Patlican). I'm familiar with...hummus. It took me a while to figure out the rest of what I was getting (Babaganoush; stuffed grape leaves; a tomato, onion, and pepper mix; tabouleh; pinto beans; Turkish yogurt; and chopped eggplant). In addition, I ordered a side of cacik. I love cacik and was excited to go to Shish Kebab for that very reason.The sampler plate was enormous, embarrassingly so. And it came with no carbs - no pita bread, no rices, nothing - just spoons and maybe 4-5 slices of tomato. On the sampler plate was cacik; please note that cacik is not listed under the sampler section of the menu. Alongside my giant sampler plate was a cereal bowl filled with more cacik. Oh my. I do have a way with ordering, don't I? I looked enviously at the swordfish skewers next to me. Needless to say I boxed a large portion of this meal, a very large portion.The babaganoush was the best I've had. The hummus was alright, not much to talk about. The stuffed grape leaves were decent, but I've had better. The eggplant was doable. The tabouleh wasn't very good. I passed on the pinto beans. The tomato/onion/pepper mix was nasty, nasty, nasty.Thank goodness I liked the cacik. I'll probably be eating it for the rest of the week.I also snuck a bite of swordfish, which was delicious.While the food (my food) was subpar, the service was the greatest! I loved our thick-accented waiter. We were a large party, so he broke the checks up by heads of household. All night, when someone would order something, he would respond with the check holder's name: 'You are Ted? No, no, you are Paul? Jim? Ah, yes, Jim.' The waiter made personal recommendations including what was apparently some fantastic wine, and a very good light Turkish beer. Our waiter had a backup team of 3 women who helped with drinks and sides and made sure we were happy all night long.And when it came time for cake, the house lights went down, the best rendition of the birthday song I've heard came on, and the staff waltzed our with chocolate covered with chocolate. Mmmm.That's another thing. The music here was excellent. When we came in, they were playing the theme from The Godfather, which really set the mood. Then, I heard a Turkish version of Hotel California, then Tom Waits. Variety is the spice of life.At the end of our meal, the waiter presented us with gift cards. I'm not sure if we got them because we were such a large, easy going party or what, and I'm not sure how much is on them, but they definitely know how to keep customers coming back. Next time I'm there, I'm flexing for the swordfish."], ["Stephanie B.", "What's not to love about a Kebab? My boyfriend and I spotted the name of this place driving down Bethel Rd. one try, and decided to try it out.And after reading everyone else's reviews, I think I need to give this place a second try. I liked it, it just wasn't the best.We drove up here one evening and they were closing in about 45 minutes or so. They welcomed us, though, and we received very kind service. We were about the only people in the place, and we kind of got the feeling that they were waiting on us to leave so they could be done for the night. Having worked in restaurants, I know what that feels like to just want to go home, but it was a little weird having them sort of loom over us.Anyway, it was a very cute and posh looking restaurant. Seeing where it's located in the strip mall kind of location, you wouldn't think that it was so elegant inside. But it was quite sophisticated. And parking would never be a problem - always a plus! They even have a quaint outdoor patio, although sitting there would only really give you a view of the parking lot and the rest of the strip mall.Since it was so late, I felt quite rushed to order, and just picked the Chicken Kabab, because it was one of the few dishes I saw on the menu that didn't include lamb, which I don't eat. But I didn't really get a good look at the menu. It seemed to offer quite a bit, but I wasn't sure what everything was as it was entirely new to me.Our food was brought out quickly, and it had a very nice presentation. Now, I don't know much about Turkish food, so I can't really say how it was supposed to be. But it was tasty, just kind of dry. I literally just had huge chunks of chicken on my plate, surrounded by huge chunks of vegetables. All good, just not really what I expected, and I wished there was some kind of sauce to drizzle over it or dip it in. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, or maybe I should have ordered an additional side or sauce, but I didn't really know anything about the cuisine and as I said, we felt rushed. The wait staff wasn't exactly helpful, but they were very polite.I had to get a to go box because there was so much food left over, and we kind of ended up eating in a rush because we didn't want to make them stay open for us, because by this point, we were the last people in the restaurant. Even though they weren't closed yet, I think they might be used to people clearing out early so they can get a head start on closing up shop.I didn't pay, but the prices seemed reasonable for a nice dining experience, about $15 per person. When we left they closed for the night and locked the door behind us. It all seemed to happen very fast.I liked the place, but I've been to places that are still quite accommodating even when it's close to closing time. But here, I just felt like they couldn't wait for us to leave the whole time. It was somewhat uncomfortable.Nevertheless, we really should have come at an earlier time, and I think I need to do a better job of reading over the menu. Those things were definitely my fault. \u00a0This place deserves a second chance. \u00a0I'll definitely try it again."], ["Tabitha T.", "NOM NOM!This place is pretty classy looking. Nice wrought iron gates and a big patio. The inside seemed pretty, but being a Friday night it was really crowded. We sat on the patio to take advantage of the relative quiet and fading-summer warmth.The first thing they brought out was a delightful sundried tomato dip, which we demolished using great slabs of delicious fresh bread. They nicely brought out more dip without being asked. I could have just eaten bread and dip for dinner, it was so good. But then I had my lamb shish kebab and it was pretty much the best thing ever. Super tender and flavorful and the rice was buttery deliciousness. The veggies that came with it were not too exciting in comparison - some green beans, bell pepper, and celery.The waiter was friendly and attentive. They have a pretty big food menu and a nice, equally big cocktail menu. The food was reasonably priced, in the $13-16 range for entrees - not a cheap place to eat, sure, but not overly fancy-expensive either.I'd definitely go back. It's a little gem in a strip mall. (Then again... strip malls typically are the places you find hidden gems. Note to self: visit Bethel Road more often!)"], ["Sam K.", "Bread!! I love their bread!!! It really is a gem of a place (in Columbus's quintessential strip mall of course). Dark wood panels, wonderful service, and reasonable prices. I was kinda bummed out that the grape leaves weren't ready for dinner yet (we got there at 6:30pm), but my other choice reminiscent of a turkish mozarrella appetizer was awesome. I forgot the name it, but it's easy to spot on the menu."], ["DARRELL W.", "I've had dinner here twice and the grilled Shish Kebab is excellent! \u00a0The best I've ever had. \u00a0It's always been perfectly cooked; tender and juicy and the right amount of flaovr. We also love the calamari. This last trip, I had the Mixed Grill, which, for a meat lover like myself, was a dream come true! \u00a0It was 4 types of meat with meat on a bed of meat. I gave it 4 stars because, although the prices are reasonable, they are slightly on the high side. \u00a0It's the best Mediterranean I've ever had and will definitely go back there for dinner."], ["Evan H.", "One of the best parts of living in Columbus was discovering Turkish food. \u00a0The food at Shish Kebab is incredible! \u00a0My favorite dish is the shepherd's pie. \u00a0It is not at all like the shepherd's pie that you would typically think of; this is tender, spiced lamb sauteed with onions and peppers in olive oil and is served with rice pilaf. \u00a0My wife's favorite is the mixed greens salad, which is perfectly dressed with lemon and olive oil, with grilled tilapia and a side of baba ghanoush. \u00a0She says the baba ghanoush is the best she has ever had; it is garlicy and silky smooth. \u00a0The hummus is also excellent. \u00a0Each meal is served with Turkish bread and a sun-dried tomato and olive oil spread. \u00a0The bread is pillowy and delicious. \u00a0I always have to stop myself from eating an entire meal's worth of bread alone. \u00a0They always had an excellent weekday lunch special where you could get an appetizer, entree, and dessert of the day for like $9. \u00a0It was an amazing deal for what you got."], ["Jenny G.", "We had an early dinner here today, ordered babaganoush, spicy beyti, and doner kebob. All very good, doner is actually the one of the best we have had. Wish they had a hot paste available upon request though. We will be coming back again."], ["Nicole B.", "I was lucky to travel to Istanbul a few years ago. The food there is amazing, so when I came back to Columbus, I searched for a Turkish restaurant that could match that experience. Shish Kebab is damn near perfect in that quest. The lamb and chicken shish kebabs are fantastic! Definitely my favorite thing on the menu. My body is screaming for it as I type this. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is OK. It's a large room that doesn't offer much intimacy, but once you start eating the food, you forget everything around you."], ["Susan V.", "Thought it was pretty good. \u00a0Bread A plus. Lentil soup C- \u00a0 Shepherd's Casserole CSteak kebab B. \u00a0Would go back for lunch when prices are lower."], ["rafe h.", "Great deal great food"], ["Dave M.", "I've eaten at Shish Kebab Mediterranean Grill and the former Cafe Shish Kebab on several occasions. The food is absolutely wonderful, well seasoned but not over-powered by garlic. Any of the kebab dishes are awesome. I often get the mixed kebab grill and take half of it home with me. Their yogurt sauce is excellent. We usually end up ordering the appetizer sampler as it's too difficult to limit yourself to just one item."], ["L. M.", "I've eaten in the restaurant where the dish with the smoked eggplant puree was very tasty. But carryout is a different story. The food seemed to be prepared at different times, so some was cold while other dishes hot. Aftertaste (freezer burn?) to many of the dishes. And when I got home without one of the items we'd paid for, I was told curtly that we could drive back to pick it up. Really? So then everything we'd ordered would be cold?"], ["Chip B.", "This is a hidden gem in Columbus. In an unassuming strip mall next to a BW3 and cheap Chinese place, you would hardly expect to find a place with as nice a decor, really nice wine list, and fantastic food. The menu is a rather typical middle eastern affair consisting of kebabs, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush etc. The food in general is always excellent. It is one of these places that does few things, but does them exceedingly well. Mix that with great service (I have never encountered poor service as others have mentioned) and you have a 5 star value win. My stand out favorite is the spicy beyti kebab. Other kebabs are excellent as well; simply prepared, well seasoned, and with quality meats. Their bread is home made and addictive. It is one of those things that makes you wonder what have we lost in our modern Wonder Bread world when old fashioned breads like this exist and are light years better. Served with a sun dried tomato, rosemary, and olive oil dip; I could make a meal just out of the bread and dip. Another favorite is their cold bean appetizer. This is simple peasant food in all honesty, but the hearty mix of beans and herbs and vegetables is a rich and \"clean\" feeling dish. This place serves what food should be: simple quality ingredients, a good mix of meat, vegetable, and carbs, basic preparations that are time tested and classic. If we as Americans ate like this every day (you know, unprocessed foods with fiber that were incredibly tasty) we would be better off as a country."], ["Julie P.", "Yet another gem on Bethel Rd. \u00a0Seriously, if you need to eat in C-Bus, just get on the corner of Bethel and Reed, spin around, and point. \u00a0Something is bound to be awesome.Shish Kebab has been on my radar for awhile now, and I'm so glad I finally got to try it out. It sounds totally cheesy, but this is a surprisingly classy place. \u00a0It's definitely perfect for a date or a celebration dinner, but you won't feel out of place coming in jeans with no preconceived notions, as we did. \u00a0The service was very attentive and professional; I get the impression they run a tight ship here. \u00a0Of course, I can't forget to talk about the food, which was amazing. \u00a0Husband and I took a risk and each tried some Turkish booze. \u00a0I had a glass of Turkish red wine and he had a dark beer, Efes. \u00a0Both were fantastic. \u00a0Like others have said, you get beautiful bread (leavened) with your meal and a sun-dried tomato olive oil that is pitch-perfect. \u00a0We ordered a side of Cacik, their homemade (read it: homemade) yogurt with cucumbers, dill, and mint. \u00a0I have to say, I am really, really, very into yogurt, which is kind of weird, but yeah, I dig it. \u00a0This yogurt is hands-down the most delicious thing I have ever had. Seriously creamy, not runny or watery, cools your mouth and cleans your palate without leaving a fatty mouth feel. \u00a0This is yogurt of my dreams! \u00a0I think I have a problem....Also ordered lamb and okra stew and the doner special, which is sliced gyro-style lamb and beef with an eggplant puree, green peppers, and tomatoes. \u00a0The lamb stew was very well made, with a nice balance of flavors and adorable little baby okra that was not at all sticky. \u00a0The doner kebab was nice, but the real star was that eggplant. \u00a0Imagine the creamy texture of hummus with the smoky flavor of baba ganoush and you have this little plate of awesome.We ended the meal with Turkish coffee and tea, which, while not the best of either that I've ever had, was definitely very nice and beautifully presented.I will surely be back here very soon!"], ["Paul F.", "My first impression of Cafe Shish Kebab was WOW, this is a really nice place. \u00a0The whole place was decorated in wood (don't know what kind) and that includes the bar area. \u00a0It is very, very nice.Cafe Shish Kebab was a great meal, even if it was a little expensive for a weeknight. \u00a0The first thing I noticed was the bread. \u00a0Instead of pita bread which I was expecting this was more like a regular loaf. \u00a0And it was great, quite possibly the best bread I've eaten in Columbus. \u00a0Then I had the lamb chops which were accompanied by rice and vegatables. \u00a0The veggies included a tomato wedge, a green pepper wedge and green beans, onions and carrots. \u00a0The lamb was extremely tender, just great. \u00a0I also had a glass of reisling. \u00a0Aften dinner I had a bowl of rice puddling for dessert. \u00a0This was a truly great meal. \u00a0But at $39 including tax and tip, it was expensive. \u00a0But hey, you only live once. \u00a0lol"]], "The Olive Tree Mediterranean Cafe": [], "Yanni's Greek Grill": [], "Firdous Express": []}
