I also orders the chicken lemon soup and combo appetizer plater but put them away due to being full... I'm hesitant about trying them. I love Greek & Mediterranean food, but that wasn't either....

I ordered a regular beef/lamb Gyro with everything on it and a cup of lentil soup.The soup was good but lacked enough salt and pepper. After adding some salt and pepper, the soup was much better. The gyro was absolutely delicious and flavorful! The meat was soft, tender, juicy and the temperature was just right! Hands down one of the best gyros, I've had in a long time. The owner also added to the positive experience. He greeted every customer that came in, checked to see if we enjoyed our meals and started conversations; \"with every customer\".

The food was pretty good, I got an assortment of Kabobs over rice but the vibe I got just wasn't worth the reasonably well done authentic cooking. If the owner/manager/host whomever doesn't want me there, well then I certainly don't want to be there. Maybe I have some sort of persecution complex, but the host/owner (I'm not sure he never introduced himself) seemed like he couldn't be bothered to take care of us and just seemed a lot more invested in the other patrons, even running outside to stop some people from forgetting their leftovers. Make what you want of that, if you're the people who are getting the leftovers brought out to them, then this review has an entirely different character. I guess it comes down to this, it's not that he didn't care (the restaurant was pretty clean and well maintained), he just didn't care about us.Honestly, I don't want to discourage anyone from going here, I don't think that others will be doomed to the same experience we had, but I know this is not the place for me."], ["Andrew C.", "This is a constant stop for me.

Immediately, we noticed the restaurant was really small. We took a seat and, soon after, were greeted by an individual who appeared to be the owner. He didn't seem particularly excited to see us; he wasn't unfriendly, but it seemed like we were putting him out. He was a lot more courteous to everyone else in the restaurant. Before we ordered, we received a lemony chicken noodle soup. It was good, and a pleasant surprise. We ordered the deluxe shish kabob combo and a shepherd salad. Mine came out after about 10 minutes, and my boyfriend's took about 10 minutes after that. We waited way too long for being 1 of 3 tables in the restaurant. Everyone else had already been served, so there was really no reason for ours to take so long.My salad tasted more like the individual parts than a combined salad; I tasted tomato, cucumber, banana peppers, and 4 olives. The dressing and feta cheese were fairly tasteless. My boyfriend's shish kabob was pretty good, but again, took forever to come out. Someone else came in after us, ordered the shish kabob, and got take out fairly quickly; not sure why that took so much longer than ours.Every other table got special treatment; the owner personally brought both other tables something in a take-out box; bread maybe? He even walked one all the way out to a patron's car. We received nothing of the sort. Because the restaurant is so small, you feel like you're right on top of the people next to you. We were unfortunate enough to hear every single tidbit of a rather obnoxious conversation happening at the table immediately next to us. We were unable to have any conversation over their loud banter. We were pretty disappointed. If we were enamored with the food, we might consider take out. However, the food was good, but not worth the experience. The prices also weren't great for what we got. We will not be back."], ["Russell S.", "Excellent quality. Nice variety. Dessert to die for.

G and I knew exactly what we wanted before we arrived thanks to previous reviews. So we set out to split a Chicken Lemonata and a Spicy Chicken Argos.The Chicken Lemonata is probably a safe choice for those who don't want to venture too far in their gustatory range. It's tasty, yet familiar. You can also get it with delicious garlic yukon potatoes. We ordered some veggies on the side. This was good, but I was much more interested in our second dish. The spicy Chicken Argos was kind of like a stew, PERFECT for eating with the pita. Anything I can eat with pita, I will. It was a wonderful level of spiciness, and the taste was magnificent. I would happily get this dish every time I visit the Happy Greek. It also comes with hummus and has delightful veggie pieces. Again...very pita friendly.

Our pita was gone and we still had 2/3 of the dip left, but ask for more pita? Upcharge. I promise I'm not one to write a poor review based largely on the price or value.

Huge chunks of the mixed-in veggies. I couldn't pick, so I caved in and went with the Lamb Schwarma Plate with Tabouli and Matbukha for the two sides that flank the dollop of hummus. I've had moister meats at other Greek spots, but the onions and sauce cooked in with this lamb was a plus. The portions are huge, so I took some of that Matbukha bad boy and mixed it in with the Lamb Shawarma and the hummus. Good? Grrrreat!! I definitely had leftovers.

I also put in a side order of falafel just to try it out.I have to say that I've been to quite a few Mediterranean places in Columbus, and Ohio for that matter, and the lamb here was phenomenal. The sauce was fantastic, and all of the ingredients on the gyro tasted really fresh. The fries were cooked perfectly and had some tasty seasoning on them. They were really nice and crispy with a soft center.The baklava wasn't incredible, but it was free, and it wasn't super sticky like most of the baklava I've had. It wasn't overly sweet either, so that was kinda nice.By the time I was done eating the combo, I barely had room for the falafel, but I muscled a few of them down and brought the rest back for co-workers.

Horrible packaging meant a soup lid busted and soaked everything in the bag. We ordered 2 three dip samplers and they put them all in the same non-divided white styrofoam box that meant that they all mixed together into one gloopy mess. All of the vegetables were freezer burned. The lamb and kofta and the chicken in the mixed grill were overcooked to the point of inedibility. The souvlaki was undercooked and overcooked (it varied depending on which chunk you got). The fish also tasted like it came from a freezer and was so overcooked that even with a fork and knife, I couldn't cut through it. Baked fish should flake easily.

We paid in cash, so it's not anything we can contest with our credit card company.

The tzatziki is the best I've ever had anywhere in town, and the kopanasti is amazing as well. Unlike the Happy Greek in Short North, however, this location comes off as a little seedy at times.

When Thurman's and German Village Coffee Shop are busy, it seems like this is always the third choice.Easy Street is a great place for brunch. They offer a ton of different food, much of which is Greek-inspired. Their breakfast offerings are solid (try the BELT!) and their tzatziki is the best around. I order a side of that no matter what I'm eating - even the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. Oh, and their fresh-cut fries are awesome (especially in the tzatziki). Overall, this is bar food done well.The booths are giant and cozy and easily fit 6. Service is good. The decor is fun with lots of fun memorabilia around, which makes the wait for my breakfast a little easier. Prices are pretty standard, leaning toward the cheaper side. Bloody Marys are solid.

We've never had a huge wait. I think we're usually quoted 20 minutes or so but generally get a table faster than that.Their breakfast menu always looks great, but the only thing I ever end up ordering is the gyro with Greek fries. I'm sure breakfast is good and friends have gotten other things and enjoyed them, but I only want the gyro. And that's because the gyro is just that good. It is gigantic and full of wonderful gyro meat. I've had other gyros in town and usually find them to be mostly lettuce and tomato with some meat. This is excessively meaty and the tzatziki is very good.

Side note, I must admit I was bummed to learn that saganakis are only served up for dinner and not lunch. So thumbs up on the food. Service kinds of dampens the enthusiasm that I have for their greek food. There have been a couple instances of the staff showing indifference to providing at least average service to hints of disgust and confusion to requests. One time my friend wasn't keen on their ice tea, so she asked to have another drink. The server (who I think is the owner), took the tea, looked at it, then looked at my friend, and displayed a look of confusion and irritation as he walked away.

At first we thought it was more of a pub, but once we looked at the menu we were pleasantly surprised by the Greek menu. We decided to try the Saganaki (flaming cheese) and both get gyros. The cheese was DELISH and visually really cool too (they pour 151 over it and then set it on fire!) As for the gyros..I've had many from many places, even other authentic places, and NONE can touch how amazing Easy Street's are! The lamb tastes so flavorful and all the veggies were fresh and crisp! From that point on, it was a weekly ritual. Monday's are half-price pizza nights so you can get a delicious Greek pizza for $6! We loved Easy Street so much that the owner George let me have my husbands 26 birthday there, and provided a huge pan of Baklava! ( He clearly knew we were big Easy Street fans!)

Everyone talks about visiting Easy Street because the line is long at Thurman's which I find amusing as I really enjoy the atmosphere much more at Easy Street.The food itself is a unique blend of quasi-Greek with an American twist. More authentic than Happy Greek and most of the other places I've had in Columbus but with enough twist to make it unique and fun for the masses. Spinach Dip is an absolute joy and has ruined anyone else's dip for me. The Saganaki is tasty and is a lot of fun when they light it on fire! The Greek Veggie (Meat) Pizza is like a Gyro on olive brush pizza crust and is amazing. The Chicken Ceasar Pizza and an interesting idea that combines a salad with a pizza and it works. In closing, I want to take a moment and talk about something near and dear to me. PANCAKES. I'm just going to say this and you can disagree with me but Easy Street has the BEST Sunday Brunch Pancakes in the Village. I love Der German Village Coffee Haus but Easy Street has them beat.

Go to that dreaded Westerville and fall in love with Yanni's."], ["Karen P.", "I love, love, love Yanni's. \u00a0The food is fresh, fast, and delicious. \u00a0It's also nice as those that are a little timid to try outside the everyday \"American\" cuisine, they offer some standards like hamburgers and whatnot. \u00a0 The hummus is great, the gyro is awesome... \u00a0 I mean come on, you get the tastiest gryo I've had in the states (I've been to both the Greek Town in Chicago and Detroit) and this one beats them all. \u00a0 Better yet is that the prices are super cheap and there is tons of food. \u00a0One comment I have to make about a prior reviewer, Falalfel is not Greek, but Middle Eastern (originated in Egypt).. \u00a0You should really only see it on the menu of somewhere claiming Middle Eastern or Mediterranean (and not all as this term is pretty vague when categorizing). \u00a0Yanni's boasts being Greek, they just accommodate American palates as well for the less adventurous or more picky."], ["Jack S.", "simply great food in a small restaurant with personalized service. The lemon chicken is perfect and you must try the homemade desserts and pastries. Exceptionally friendly and, at least for me, a must-stop every time I travel to Columbus."], ["Keiana S.", "I get the gyros at least once a month. I don't even live close by. It's THAT good. And must must must get a cup of chicken lemon soup. If u are dining in, which I would recommend for ur first visit, try the calamari, stuffed grape leaves,and dessert"]], "Firdous Express": []}
