{"The Capital Grille": [["Len J.", "Just exceptional. The food was perfect, the service was friendly, efficient and knowledgable. My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary. I let them know that when I reserved. Our table had rose petals on it as well as a note thanking us for coming. The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella appetizer was very good. It was very lightly grilled and finished with balsamic vinegar. Order it. Do it. I'll sit here and wait while you do. The steaks were great. The sides were more than two of us could share. We had what was probably the best cheese cake I've ever had for dessert. The only complaint I had was the valet parking. It was an absolute mess when we arrived for a 6:30 dinner. Cars on the sidewalk, in the street. No way to tell where to drop the car, or whether we should. But the point if this place is after you park. Our experience was impeccable."], ["Amanda P.", "Delicious food and good service. My friend and I split the lobster macaroni and it was delicious. A decent amount of lobster and the pasta was fresh and tasty. We also shared the generous portion of friend calamari, which was melt in your mouth delicious. My one complaint about the calamari is that they don't serve it with any type of sauce.The service was kind of weird. The waitress was attentive at first, although she didn't provide us with a bar menu and we were sitting in the bar area. \u00a0She gave her honest opinion of the dishes, which is appreciated and helpful when ordering. However, at the end of our meal, I ordered coffee and would have loved a refill on it but by then, the waitress had disappeared. I asked another waitress for a second cup of coffee, which she brought, and then my friend asked for a hot tea. Twenty minutes later, the waitress brought the tea and said \"oh, I kept forgetting to bring this to you because I'm not really your waitress.\"We were a little taken aback by that comment. I completely understand that the waitstaff needs to be attentive to their own tables, but the only reason we asked her for assistance is because our waitress was nowhere to be found. In general, the waitstaff seemed stressed and frazzled - no one was smiling. Perhaps they were understaffed for the night. \u00a0Overall though, it was excellent and I will definitely go back."], ["Binly S.", "I have enjoyed this place very much! The staff was great, maybe the best all around in the Hartford area. I came here with a group of 3 total and among us we had three starters, three cocktails, a bottle of wine, three steak entrees, two sides and two desserts. The setting and vibe was just right. Good music playing in the background and ambient lighting. It was very nice and romantic to say the least, except none of us had our dates. Ha!I myself had the Caesar Salad which I wasn't too fond of since the dressing was a bit too salty for my taste. To even that out the 24oz Dry Aged Porterhouse was absolutely delicious! The creme brulee for dessert was also very good to finish it off. The cocktail I had was the Adults only Arnold Palmer and I feel like it could've been better. Maybe a little sweeter? That's my opinion though.I will be coming back! But this time it will be with my lovely lady. I am looking forward to it."], ["Jena G.", "I came here for an anniversary dinner and this placed delivered. Per usual, I'll start with ambience. We came on a Thursday around 8:30 and the place was surprisingly tame. A few couples were interspersed throughout the main room. I didn't mind because everything was so quiet and romantic I could hear the flutters of my boyfriend's heart (could've been due to the bill, however). I've gotta say, coming from a girl who loves a good glass of vino, this place is pretty genius for making their entryway a glorified wine cellar. I mean come on. Who doesn't love entering an upscale restaurant that greets you with its hefty collection of wine? This place basically had me at hello.Since I came here for a special occasion, my boyfriend and I planned to go all out. We ordered a bottle of red claret which our server came out with promptly. He was helpful in guiding us in the right direction but hands off enough to let us pick a wine of our choice. There was nothing pushy about him; he didn't exude that clandestine message that some waiters do...you know...the \"try this $100 bottle you'll love it.\" We started with the spicy calamari (one of my personal favorites). Every piece was so tender and juicy I swear I still have dreams about that plate. Loved the tempura peppers to accent the calamari too. We also had a balsamic drizzled caprese salad which was fine...but I've lived in Italy so I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to mozzarella. For entr\u00e9es my boyfriend had a 22 oz bone-in rib eye which he finished in record timing. Seriously the Capital Grille should've timed him and put it up as an advertisement or something. He's had his fair share of red meat and this is the only thing he looked at with a more loving gaze than me all night. I ordered the french onion soup and lobster mac and cheese for a main course. The soup was fantastic and the LM&C was so. darn. rich. Just how it should be. I think my boyfriend is still recovering from the dent that the bill made but I repeat, this dinner was for a special occasion. I've been to a few upscale restaurants on par with this one but I only reserve my 5 star reviews for downright TREMENDOUS and PERFECT places. This place is darn near it. But the price tag is hefty."], ["Dan R.", "Valerie R. was right on the money, and I do mean money! This is an expensive restaurant where a drink, an appy or salad, and an entree will set you back no less than a C-Note easy, so it's definitely a special event kind of place.This was our first visit here, and we only went because I had a generous gift card left over from last year's birthday. The level of service was incredible- from the valet parking to the hostess station personnel to the servers. Everyone was amazing- so helpful and polite and courteous and ultra professional.They have a very cool iPad gizmo that serves as their wine list, so you can scroll and sort away to find the exact style or bottle or glass that suits your taste and budget. Most of the wines are north of ten dollars a glass.The bread basket was way above average- a real cornucopia of styles - rolls, dark sweet bread, and thin cracker like slices served with a big slab of butter.The three of us decided to split one of the salads -a $13 beauty of a dish with Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with 15-Year Aged Balsamic. A normal serving has two mozzarella-tomato towers, and we were very pleased to see that they reconfigured the dish into three towers. The salad was so good- fresh tomatoes, incredible mozzarella (made on site) and the balsamic was wonderful.I had a Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip for $48. It was 14 oz of deliciousness served with a black truffle and gorgonzola butter, and cherry cabernet reduction. The meat was perfect (medium rare). The gorgonzola crust was so flavorful and tasted great.My dining partners also had a filet ($44) and the Pan-Seared Sea Scallops with Wild Mushroom Risotto (also $44).We shared two of the sides - Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Smoked Bacon ($12) and the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($11). Both were pretty generous portions and were perfect for sharing.Was the food amazing? Yes it was.Was the level of service top notch? Yes we were pampered like royalty all evening. Check this out- at the end of our meal, the hostess asked if we had valet parked. When we said yes, she asked for our ticket, and carried out our \"to go\" bags to the car for us, so when we walked out the door, our car was waiting for us with our bags in the car. I'll leave it to you to decide if this level of quality and pricing structure is something you're interested in. \u00a0I will say that we were totally impressed with every facet of our dining experience. \u00a0For a special event, it's hard to top the Capital Grille."], ["Shellene O.", "The only thing I'm not terribly fond of at Capital is their prices! \u00a0 I've had nothing but excellent service in both the bar and the restaurant. \u00a0I've been with large parties and for one to one lunches. \u00a0The food is always excellent and the steaks are always perfectly cooked. \u00a0 \u00a0This is the kind of places that makes me wish I had a bottomless stomach so I could try everything! \u00a0I almost never make it to dessert because I'm just too full. \u00a0 Any opportunity I get to have a vendor take me here I don't pass it up! =)"], ["Claire K.", "Amazing! I came here with my boyfriend last night, and we shared an amazing dinner. We shared the Crab Cocktail(perfect), 1 cup of Clam Chowder, The \u00a0Bibb Stack Salad with Pear(nice light salad), The Citrus Glazed Salmon(perfect), and an amazing Flourless Espresso Cake. Worth every cent!Whenever we're in Hartford, we will definitely considering going back to The Capital Grille."], ["Lydell A.", "I was hooked on my first visit. I stopped by here for a restaurant week deal before I knew what I was getting myself into. I didn't realize that it was a larger chain know for it's relatively uncommon dry-aged steak. I feel like dining here caused me to actually learn and was a turning point to as a foodie. \u00a0When a place can do that, you know have to give them no less than 5 stars. Where do I start? I do know what to rave about first, but I think I'm going to go with the service. The level of service here, from the free valet, to the maitr\u00e9 d, to the waiter, was eye-opening. I can tell they put a heavy emphasis on making the experience as perfect as possible. My reservations (and I suggest reservations) were promises kept every time and I was seated promptly after every arrival. Smiles and manners are common almost anywhere but the level of attentiveness and customization make their service shine. When my cup was less than half way full someone came to fill it before I could request it. My napkins were color matched to my pants to (camouflage \u00a0better?!). They swept the table free of crumbs between each course. Service gets 6 starsThe food. Oh the food. I pretty much always get steak from a steakhouse so that's what I've had at most of my visits here. Last time I had a NY Strip and it was cooked absolutely flawlessly and the flavor is what I want every steak I ever eat to taste like. I've never had a filet as tender as Ruth Chris but I've never had any ny strip as flavorful as Capital Grill. \u00a0The sides were pretty good but nothing notable for me. What shone from the dessert menu for me is the flourless chocolate espresso cake. It's not a huge portion size but it is rich, surprisingly filling, and a party for your tastebuds. \u00a0Also, I had a Gorgonzola and black truffle burger from here once for lunch with fries. The fries were decent, but the burger was easily the best I've ever had.This place isn't cheap but that's kind of the point. Come with your stomach empty but your wallet/purse full. \u00a0;)"], ["Kristin B.", "I love coming to this restaurant. The atmosphere is just amazing. They take your coat. Their wine bottles are on display as decor. There's a waiter with one of those waxed mustaches (or at least there used to be). They offer you hot towels at the end of the meal, and bring you a doggie bag (is it too classy to call it that here?) with a personal note from the chef. Yes!The food is so delicious. \u00a0It is well worth the price. \u00a0They are far too generous with the desserts I will say. Bring someone to share with. \u00a0Last summer I called ahead and told them I was bringing my partner for his birthday and they made sure to have a surprise cake ready with his name on it. They also sprinkled little glittery stars on the table next to a hand written card wishing him happy birthday upon our arrival.

The service, food and ambience were excellent in both, although the two locations have very different ambience. The steaks and salmons I've had were superb. They beef is aged and though \u00a0they don't advertise how old, we were given a tour of their facilities and the kitchen and drying refrigerator are impeccably clean and up to date. The servers are very knowledgeable, the list of wines long, and they offer iPads so you can peruse both wines or bourbons at your leisure. \u00a0The appetizers are truly special and even though I hate ordering apps if I know the meal will be large, you'll want to splurge and try them. They have a version of fried mozzarella that is a first for me - it's wrapped in prosciutto and it's crispy. The calamari is fried with hot green sliced peppers. The lobster tails are split and easy to eat, ice cold and delicious. They had a special 16 oz fillet, bone in, served with a light butter sauce. It is possibly the best beef I've ever had and certainly ties with anything at Peter Luga (I actually preferred to Peter Luga's) and the best Ruth's Chris I've been to (West Palm Beach FL). \u00a0Okay, I'll stop here. The restaurant is great, the service is not overbearing but perfect instead. The price, well, if you have to ask . . . that's the clincher. Even though it is expensive, it's a great place to come with a large group because you'll really enjoy yourself. Valet parking. Easy Piezy !"], ["Nichole G.", "The place is gorgeous .. Excellent greetings ... The staff is amazing. Now the food was amazing I had the filet mignon \u00a0with lobster tails . The steak was cooked to perfection. The dessert was also mouth watering we had the chocolate warm cake. The wines we paired was perfect. Overall it was one of the most excellent restaurants I've been too!"], ["Lindsay J.", "We ate here during Hartford's Restaurant Week. Let me start by saying, I am hesistant to eat anywhere in Hartford. Location is a big deal but parking is an even bigger one. Capital Grille has killer valet parking and couldn't be easier. We were seated in a nice quiet corner of the restaurant and the service was simply impeccable. We had salad (fresh, delicious and large portions) for our appetizer. My boyfriend had the rib eye and I had the porcini tenderloi. Both were scrumptious and done very well. The sides were green beans and the best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten in a restaurant. They reminded me so much of what my Italian grandmother would make when I was a kid. Dessert was Creme Brulee with a fresh fruit topping. Out of this world!Everything from service to food was worth it. The prices on their menu are outrageous but, you get what you pay for. I can't see going here more than once or twice a year for special occasions but I know if we were to visit again, we wouldn't be disappointed."], ["Valerie R.", "You have to get in the right frame of mind in order to dine at Capital Grille. \u00a0If you are not there for a special event, then you need to tell yourself that you are going to spend $100 per person, or even more if you are drinking. \u00a0Even if you are there for a special event (Restaurant week, etc) if you tack on the extras, it will be costly. But it will be great food!The first time we went, it was for a Restaurant Week in August 2014. \u00a0They were nice about it, they encouraged you to eat from that menu and still provided excellent service, unlike some of their competitors (cough, cough...Morton's). \u00a0Martha was our server and she was amazing. \u00a0They also had their Generous Pour event going on. This was 7 tastings of wine throughout the meal for $25. \u00a0The wines were fabulous and you were able to get more of any of the wines you liked. \u00a0Seeing as normally you would spend $25+ for a single glass of wine at Capital Grille, I thought this was a phenomenal deal and definitely left with quite a buzz. \u00a0It is a must try for everyone who enjoys wine, apparently they do this every summer and can save you some bucks on the alcohol part of the bill.The second time we went was on 5/2/15, right at the end of the Wagyu and Wine event. \u00a0For $25 they offered one of four featured wagyu burgers with fries, along with a glass of wine with a choice of two red wines. \u00a0This might not sound cheap to the average person, but again, a glass of wine generally runs more than this at Capital Grille, so this is a great deal. \u00a0We had to sit in the lounge to get this deal, though when we called earlier in the day they were very accommodating, saying that they would allow us to have the special in the dining room if the lounge was full when we came in. \u00a0It was not, and we grabbed a nice table by a window. \u00a0I had the featured gorgonzola and black truffle burger with a glass of \u00a02011 Beringer Quantum Cabernet Sauvignon Blend. \u00a0My husband picked the burger with havarti, a fried egg and crispy onions, with a glass of 2012 Etude Carneros Pinot Noir. \u00a0We both loved our own wines better than the other, and both loved our burgers. \u00a0I liked his burger a little more because you could taste the meat and it was good - I liked mine too but gorgonzola tends to overshadow the flavor of anything else.We also added on apps (french onion soup and Caesar salad) and desserts (coconut cream pie and creme brulee) and pre-dinner drinks (mojito and cosmo) and it was well over $100 at the end of the night. \u00a0But the food and drinks were great! \u00a0The mojito was the best I've tasted since being in Puerto Rico, the burgers and wine were fabulous and the coconut cream pie portion size was ridiculous. \u00a0They even let me upgrade to parmesan truffle fries at no extra cost. \u00a0We brought half of our burgers home and had a great night overall.After I've said all of that, I still have to say I prefer J. Gilbert's, because the quality of the food is comparable, and we can get a full meal with a bottle of wine there for half the price of Capital Grille. \u00a0I'm still giving Capital Grille a 5, because if it's a special occasion or it's in the budget, you will have a good experience here. \u00a0Definitely sit in the dining room over the lounge, as you will get more of the experience that is worthy of the price tag."], ["Justin C.", "My god that was an experience. Vowed to never go here unless everything was on someone else's dime (since it's crazy expensive). Sure enough, I finally got lucky. \u00a0PRO:Fantastic food. Everything I ate was amazing. Big Kona steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was killer. Mash potatoes, brussel sprouts cooked in bacon came out great. Hot, flavorful. Appetizers were phenomenal. Oysters and shrimp were incredibly fresh. Calamari was cooked perfectly too. Even got a great surprise at the end when everyone at the table was given a gift card on the house. CON:Expensive. Every entree is going to run you $40, and that probably wont include anything (sides, salad, etc.). Basically everything is a la carte. \u00a0You want mash potatoes? Get ready to pay for it. I'm not a huge fan of that serving style in general... Some other folks at the table had issues. Lamb was apparently chewy, and someone sent their steak back 3 times for being too rare."], ["Jonah Y.", "This in my eyes is the 5 star experience that everyone strives for. I have been eating here for about eight years and have never once had a bad or mediocre experience. I have visited them in Boston, NYC, Pitsburgh, Vegas, and Hartford and have had the same exceptional service and food in every location. This is my go to business dinner location.The drink and wine selection is impressive and the wait staff is always very well versed in all. If you want to impress your customers or a loved one who likes seafood, I recommend the seafood tower. It's nothing short of amazing. Blue crab, lobster, oysters, and shrimp round out this three tier tower of chilled seafood. The fried calamari is always perfectly cooked and the fresh mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto is a very unique and delicious selection.For the entree there is only one selection in my opinion and its the bone in ribeye.The Kona crusted with shallot butter is my rub of choice and have never been disappointed...ever. I should diversify my Capital Grill experience and try something else one time but when the monent of truth arrives I stick to my rock. I did just try the porchini rubbed The sides also make the dining experience. I have two words, Lobster Mac!! The sides are big enough to share with another person but not the lobster mac and cheese!! The aparagus, mushrooms, and scalloped potatoes are also very good.All in all definately one of the best overall dining experiences a person can have, regardless of location.Go there...you won't regret it."], ["Sarah W.", "I enjoyed an excellent dinner here with a girlfriend. \u00a0My steak with gorgonzola crust was amazing. \u00a0The chocolate espresso cake was incredible! \u00a0THe service was very good.

The scallops didn't have a pleasant taste, I was definitely expecting more; as for the steaks, we were surprised to see, that both of them were very different in size, even though, they've asked for the exact same dish, and when I say, different sizes, I really mean it, the discrepancy was very noticeable.To top it all off, I wasn't even offered a dessert for being my birthday, which even the cheapest of restaurants would have done.All in all, I'm very unimpressed, I thought my second experience at this place, was going to be as nice as the first one, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

Our sides were mashed potatoes and green beans. \u00a0For 30 dollars a piece, you really can't go wrong. Our bartender, Tyler, was polite and kind. \u00a0When I didn't know where the bathroom was, the host personally escorted me. I thought that was a nice touch. Overall, we had a great experience.

I stopped in on a whim for a fancy date night and dined outside. The weather and atmosphere was nice but then it started to go downhill from there.Because this was spontaneous, we were not super dressed up but by no means were we severely under-dressed. No telling if this was the case or not, but it took forever for the wait staff to come take our drink orders. It always felt like a task to track them down throughout the evening. I would be more understanding of this service at a lower budget place but I expect exceptional service from any upscale restaurant. I ordered a small lobster for dinner and this order was delivered grilled instead of my requested steamed. Not only that, but the lobster was already cracked and separated for me after I had joked with the waiter that \"cracking the lobster for myself is the best part\" and that I would like to do it myself. I'm not sure if they couldn't let me do that because of the ambiance or if it was an honest mistake. In hindsight, I should have brought this up to get a replacement but I have a hard time throwing out a perfectly good lobster. My date ordered a filet mignon and had no complaints... but also did not have rave reviews like he had for other restaurants. Overall I am unlikely to return. I can spend a lot less money elsewhere and get a better lobster and experience."], ["George M.", "I have now been here three times. I have spent hundreds of dollars each time. There is NOTHING remarkable about this restaurant EXCEPT how UNremarkable it is. The beef is NO better than choice. In fact if you want choice steaks you will do MUCH better at half the price at J Gilbert's in Glastonbury. If you want a truly GREAT prime steak experience then go to Flemmings in West Hartford. I have been there a dozen times and ALWAYS get an outstanding steak (only outdone by Peter Luggar's in Brooklyn).SKIP the Capital GrillAlso, I read a lot of reviews and I believe people give away stars because they just have low standards .

To start, we were brought a bread basket that had a few different varieties, then I had the caesar salad and Matthew had the field greens.

Matthew had the bone-in dry aged sirloin steak--nice flavor and also cooked as ordered. We split the mashed potatoes and the french green beans with shallots and heirloom tomatoes--both were excellent. To top off an excelllent meal, we shared desserts of flourless chocolate espresso cake and cheesecake with fresh strawberry puree--we couldn't pick a favorite!Overall, service was professional but dry, our meals were nicely presented and portioned, and we left feeling completely satisfied.

We sat at a bar table and had a couple cocktails as our table was not ready, they said they are behind. 40 minutes later (FAIL 1) our table was finally ready and we sat down ready to eat. The manager came and apologized for the the delay, and insisted to buy us drinks or an appetizer, and made us feel very welcome and appreciated. I thought that was very nice and moved on to ordering.We ordered the Fried Calamari to share as an appetizer, with the scallops for my wife and the bone in Kona Sirloin for me as our main dishes. In the meantime we had some rolls with a herbal oil and we asked for more oil, that was never brought back (FAIL 2).I don't care much for fried calamari but my wife said the same dish was much better at Max Amore.When we received the entr\u00e9es I couldn't wait to try my steak as at this point I was really hungry (around 8:30) and....FAIL 3 happens. Not only it was cold, but it was VERY well done. I had ordered medium well as I like just a little pink in the middle, and no blod. This steak was completely burnt, dark gray inside and cold. I called the waitress and asked her to touch it, so she can feel how cold it was, and she agreed. However, the truffle oil fries were really good. I was amazed that in literally 5 minutes (or less) they had a brand new steak for me, and it was amazing. Really good.When we left, the manager was at the door and asked us if we had a good meal, and I told him about our experience. I was surprised he was not aware of FAIL 1 and FAIL 2. He apologized many times and was extremely surprised and disappointed to hear about our experience. He gave us three $50 certificates, and insisted we should come back.

The only reason my review isn't five stars is because at this price point, which is high, everything needs to be perfect for a five-star review. I would highly recommend the filet with Gorgonzola and truffle. It came out well-cooked (not well-done). So you know, medium-rare here is a warm, red center and medium is a hot pink center. I know that's how it should be, but I find this varies by restaurant; so I ask. The truffle fries and the mushrooms were good, but I'd probably keep searching for amazing ones. Make a reservation. They are on opentable. Even with a reservation, we still needed to wait about ten to fifteen minutes (and the bar was full so that wasn't great). Also, I think they should up their game with the bread basket. They give lots of variety, but nothing is warm or particularly great. Also, not having oil with focaccia seems wrong to me.

I was a little scared of the growing pains but I was willing to take the risk for Tuesday's business lunch. There was eight of us in their Boardroom.The menu is pretty standard for a restaurant of this caliber... think Morton's, Ruth Chris, The Grill on the Alley.They also offer dry aged steaks which is always an excellent option. After dining today and Tuesday, I can say The Capital Grille provides solid options and it is great addition for downtown Hartford.On both days I opted for the prix fixe lunch. \u00a0 I started with the Porcini Bisque on both days and today I had the Scallops and the Lobster Roll on Tuesday. \u00a0Both were great selections. \u00a0I would recommend the Scallops over the Lobster Roll if asked.Cat was our server on Tuesday and she took wonderful care of us. \u00a0We were able to conduct our lunch meeting efficiently and perfectly on time. \u00a0Today was the more of the same. \u00a0Marissa was attentive without hovering around the table. \u00a0She asked if we had any time constrains, which we did not, and we enjoyed another wonderful lunch.Today our group was too full to enjoy desserts but thankfully Tuesday that was not the case. \u00a0We were delighted by the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0The berries on the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e were magnificent. \u00a0It was a nice refreshing touch. \u00a0Overall, The Capital Grille is an excellent new addition and provides an upscale lunch option while its competitor Morton's does not.Kudos team!"], ["Kitti O.", "So exciting to have Capital Grill open up in Hartford so I don't have to drive to providence anymore for Stoli Dolis. :)I missed lunch time and at 3:30 we were still too early for the 5pm dinner. When I made the reservation the hostess suggested we try out the bar and grab some appetizers and drinks prior to dinner. First impression, absolutely beautiful decor, dark wood some leather detailed chairs, a wall of wine, low intimate lighting. Top shelf liquor and home made chips to share. Our bartender was friendly and right away offered us a bar-bites menu and asked if we wanted sparkling or regular water, we asked for regular and he actually gave us Fiji water not plain tab, at no charge which is nice. He made a few great suggestions for appetizers we can share.Started with a calamari and chilled shrimp. The calamari was nice and light in a spicy batter and peppers. The shrimp was Jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce. Taste excellent.We hung out here until dinner. The atmosphere was cozy, the Friday happy hour rush just started to come in, there was additional seating outside mainly drawing people who just got out of work and wanted to enjoy some sunshine. We were the very first table as dinner time started. Our waitress was very informative about the menu and made some really great recommendations also. We choose to share the Chilean Sea Bass and the basic Filet mignon to not overpower the taste of the fish with a porterhouse steak. There is plenty of sides to choose from, I stayed with the basic good old mashed potatoes. My husband tried a flavorful Cabernet similar to the Sorcerer blend offered at Morton's when they have the Bone-In-Filet.A really nice dessert selection from creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e to flour less chocolate cake, coconut cream pie and so on. I choose the big hazelnut chocolate cake I was eyeing already being devoured at the bar. Big enough for 2-3 people to share. The Restaurant offers 3 different rooms you can bring a group of friends from a table of six to about 25 for meetings or private events. The kitchen is visible and separated by glass, the chairs are as comfortable as the booth seating. The bathrooms is clean and nice... Wouldn't expect anything less from a place this caliber.There is a parking garage if you prefer but they do offer free valet parking during dinner. I came too early so I used the garage, the restaurants do not validate this and it cost 7$ but no biggie next time ill come on time and use the valet instead. Slightly more expensive then Morton's, right up there with On20 up the road. Our dinner for the two of us cost 180$ plus tip. That's 2 cocktails, a glass of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 dishes and dessert. Not somewhere i'd come every weekend but worth the $$$$.Located next to the new movie theater and across from the Marriott. Right off the highway.

I have been frequenting Capital Grille restaurants across the country for the last several years and this one does not disappoint. This restaurant is situated across from the Marriott/CT Convention Center and next to the Spotlight movie theater. There are also a few other restaurants and bars very close by. Complimentary valet parking is available if you are eating at Capital. If you prefer, you can also park in the parking garage located behind the restaurant. \u00a0The atmosphere in the dining area is fairly formal and the bar area is a bit more business casual. There are also a couple of tv's in the bar.  \u00a0As for the food, you will not be disappointed with anything that you order. They have a great selection of steaks. I typically like the filet, most recently I tried the special Bone-in Kona Sirloin. It was very good, but I still love the filet that melts like butter when you cut it. Since I was here to take advantage of \"Restaurant Week\", my steak was paired with mashed potatoes and green beans. Each had its own twist and was very tasty. I shouldn't forget that I had my choice of a wedge salad, caesar salad, or clam chowder. I had the caesar. It was very good. Add the creme brulee or chocolate flourless cake.. What more do you want?!? \u00a0Finally, the service is also fantastic as always. The servers are extremely professional, attentive, and knowledgable (Especially about the extensive wine list!)... I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner, or even the homemade pineapple infused vodka."], ["Matt S.", "Visited the CG for Hartford restaurant week. Server provided sub-par service, slow and did not check with us regarding food. Lots of servers wearing less than formal attire for a restaurant that usually will run $60-80 pp with drinks for dinner. Food was mediocre, and disappointing (although most ordered from special menu so it has to be taken in consideration). Overall, wouldn't go back. I have dined at the Stamford CG a hand full of times and it is much nicer with both food and service. All servers would crumb your table, and would tend to your table in above average time. The Hartford CG isn't worth it. Maxs is much better for the same price point and won't make you wait 15-20 minutes for drink orders to come to table.

I wasn't expecting much, since Mexican food isn't my thing, but I was blown away. Every dish we had was delicious. We started off with chips and salsa. The salsa was really tasty, and the tableside guacamole we ordered to go along with it was some of the best guacamole I've ever had. We also got Santa Fe salads (which were huge) and Ceviche de Atun. It was my first time having ceviche, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I really enjoyed it. There was a lot of fresh mango, so it was on the sweet side, but I like sweet, and the ahi tuna was super tender. My side of the table demolished our ceviche within minutes. For entrees, we got a sampler platter of four different types of enchiladas (pork, beef, chicken, and vegetable). I tried a pork one, and it was yummy albeit not super memorable. We also ordered chicken quesadillas, which were surprisingly flavorful and addictive (never thought I'd say that about a quesadilla), and the Agave Street Tacos, which were my favorite of the day. The pork was so tender and wrapped up in blue corn tortillas; it was the perfect bite. I also had a bite of someone else's steak and yucca fries, and it was also well-prepared. The prices here seem to run higher than your average Mexican restaurant, but the quality of the food is also excellent. The restaurant itself was clean and stylishly decorated.

We waited at least an hour for our meals, granted we were a party of 8, but we were told there was some sort of issue with the printer so that the whole order didn't print out to get to the cooks in a timely manner, or something to that effect. After going back and reading other reviews about how long food takes in this place, or for delivery, I'd be inclined to believe this is an ongoing issue they should really work hard to resolve! I ordered Grassfed Beef Tips from the specials menu. It tasted like over-priced beef stroganoff. It did have plenty of mushrooms and a few roasted onions, but I never did see the roasted peppers that were supposed to be in it. Let me tell you about the beef, I literally spit out the first bite; it didn't seem there was any actual meet in it, it was more like tough gristle that just wouldn't even break down to a point that would make sense to swallow. I didn't get a steak knife with the meal, so I tried to cut into a different steak tip and the butter knife wouldn't even cut through it, so it wasn't just one bad piece I cut into. This was enough for me to send the dish back, there didn't seem to be any edible bites of steak in the dish. Next, I ordered a salad, also from the specials menu. The salad looked great at first glance, it had spinach, strawberries and goat cheese along with a piece of salmon (I added the salmon to the salad). It was SOOOOOOO disappointing to have another and completely different dish that I couldn't even finish. The salmon was the only thing dry on the plate, yes because it was overcooked, and oh so salty. The salad was drowning in dressing. I didn't even care for the goat cheese. I had my friend try the goat cheese, as I know she eats goat cheese more than I do, so I wanted to be sure I wasn't just being overly critical at this point, and she said it tasted like the powdered cheese on smartfood popcorn. I also tried a bar bite that had friend chicken in it, and it was just okay, nothing special, I wouldn't order that again either! There were some chicken quesadillas on the special menu that were better than anything else there that I tried. I'm pretty sure I will never go back. It's one thing to get a bad meal once, but if you can't even perfect the make-up meal to win me over? That's enough of a chance IMO. When I go to Briccos, Chowder Pot or even Bertuccis and get a salmon salad, I don't leave a bite on the plate, however I couldn't even eat half of the salad I was served here. Highly disappointing, I tried. The second star is really only because I didn't have to pay for either of these meals. Oh, there was a whole fish on the menu that two people ordered, why would you only serve fish with basil mashed potatoes and no vegetables or salad to start? Most places serve a starch and veggie with fish, I don't even understand. Two of the three of us that tried the basil mashed potatoes thought there was way too much basil, I love basil, but there was no way that I could have eaten a whole serving of those potatoes with as much basil as there was in them (It was over-powering). Oh, don't let me forget to mention the cucumber jello that came with the Watermelon Salad, three people at the table tried the cucumber jello and hated it, why would anyone think that's a good idea? The jello was actually harder than jello, I heard it was more of a tofu/jello consistency. Meh, good luck! Maybe stick to italian or burgers if you go, but there's really nothing at all positive I can say about the specials menu."], ["Karla S.", "Outstanding!

We wanted to watch the NCAA final game so we chose to sit in the bar. Lots of large TVs which was perfect. Great craft beer and cocktail list. An impressive 24 draft beers. I opted for a cocktail off the specialty menu, a lavender lemon drop and I also tried the strawberry basil tini. Both were great. We shared wings and did half mild buffalo and half bourbon bbq. Wings were good - we both liked the buffalo flavor over the bbq and wished we had gotten all that flavor. For dinner I got the pasta rose which was homemade fettuccine, sausage, chicken, spinach, and sundried tomatoes. It was tasty - a little salty for me but otherwise really good. My fianc\u00e9 got the shrimp scampi. It was really good and had a touch of cream in the sauce which was good and different. Only disappointment was they didn't have any dessert options. I would have tried something."], ["William E.", "Great beer selection. Overall experience was good....they seem to be just getting everything to flow in this new establishment.

There's a dining area, a partially enclosed bar, an aisle with more tables, and an enclosed area in the middle with restrooms. The room itself isn't very warm and inviting and has a commercial, plastic feel to ito There is a wall explaining the Nolita name that is extremely tackyo The restaurant is attached to the adjacent hotel, and it just seemed to us to have a \"hotel smell\"With all that said, keep in mind that the food is quite good.

Found Nolita on GrubHub and decided to give it a try while not really expecting much because other delivery/take-out hasn't impressed so far. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. Food (Nonna's spaghetti and meatballs and the italian wrap) was really, really good. Fries were very flavorful as well although not super crispy because of the delivery time but I can't really fault the restaurant for that. Delivery itself was relatively speedy so no issues there.Overall would definitely recommend and I look forward to checking out the actual restaurant in the near future!"], ["Sonja J.", "Nolitas Restauraunt was a pleasant surprise for us! After reading some of the mixed reviews, we decided to give it a try anyways since most people seemed to express mostly positive experience here. The first point in their favor was the environment itself. It was very clean, and you could tell that daily upkeep was something which was important to them and happened at least a few times a day. All the carpets looked vacuumed, the tables and bar counter were clean, and I would describe the genera l d\u00e9cor as something which would suit most contemporary tastes. The dishes were also clean, and in fact you could tell some had just come out of the dish sanitizer because they were still a little warm to the touch. I have eaten at other restauraunts where even though the dishes appear to have been put through a cycle they still have specks of food or liquid on them. Gross!! However, Nolitas was very clean all around so that was a big plus.Next, I would say the food really was better than I had expected based only on reading the reviews. Some reviews criticzed the food as being somewhat stale or dry. We did not experience that however. My cobb salad was exactly as I had expected it to be: fresh and crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes and crispy bacon. The only thing which maybe could have made it a little better was the flavoring. I'm not totally sure, but I think they might have added in something which tasted like watercress which just has to much of a bitter taste for my liking. To be fair though, I did not let them know beforehand so I cannot really say it is their fault if they didn't know. All said though, I do think it was a great salad and I would still recommend it. As for my husbands lasagna which I tried, I thought the ratio of meat:cheese was just right. He can write his own review though... lol. The draft beers were a little pricey, in fact most everything on that page was kind of pricy. Everything else though was moderately priced and I thought it was a good value considering the portion sizes were pretty large. They also had a good selection of menu items to choose from. I'm sure most people would probably find at least a few things here which would 'suit their tastes.' (Pun intended, lol)"], ["Ms. G.", "I had the bone in pork chop with polenta and spinach.

The restaurant really wasn't that busy for a Friday night. The waiter never voluntarily checked in with my table. We had to wave him down whenever we needed anything. \u00a0I decided to try the Ensalada Mexicana. Romaine lettuce, topped with chicken , crispy tortillas strips, tomatoes, cheese, black beans with a chipotle dressing. Terrible choice. For $19, it was the driest salad I've ever tasted. \u00a0Dole makes clear a way better southwestern salad, and it comes in bag. I asked the waiter for the available dressing they offered, as the chipotle dressing was a little too spicy. The waiter could not have cared less.

As for the meals, I've had a variety of dishes from tacos to enchiladas to mole and I've never been in love with my dish.

Now don't get me wrong, the food is not terrible just not the place I want to go for Mexican food unless it's restaurant week.

There was some eye-rolling at our table over this. The wine menu is not only written out on the menu, but also available on a tablet with more in depth information about the wines. \u00a0No one at our table is that knowledgeable about wines so it was helpful when guessing what to order (with the waiters help, we did well).The food was delicious. \u00a0I started out with the French Onion soup as did someone else at our table. \u00a0The other two people had the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad. \u00a0Although it is a steak house my main course was the New Bedford Scallops. \u00a0It was wonderful, light and sweet. \u00a0My husband had the petite Filet Mignon, and it was also delicious, we shared our meals. \u00a0Another diner at our table really enjoyed the Salmon and the fourth the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon. \u00a0We shared sides of the mushrooms as well as Whipped Potatoes. \u00a0Everyone loved the food. \u00a0For dessert we decided to get one Walnut Turtle Pie. \u00a0We all loved it but agreed it was very rich and sharing it was the way to go.The biggest drawback to Flemings is that it is located in West Hartford with New York Steakhouse prices. \u00a0I \u00a0knew it was going to be pricey when the menu on line did not show the prices for the food. \u00a0We were all a little shocked at the prices. \u00a0We will definitely be back to Flemings but will remember that when we leave while our stomachs will be full, our wallets will be empty."], ["Marleena C.", "YEAH!!

We thoroughly enjoyed the drinks and food offered as part of the Happy Hour. One little criticism would be with the Salt and Pepper shrimp as the shrimp tasted old to us. The Sweet Chili Calamari were very good and the sweet chili sauce on them was very nice. When leaving, I spied a gorgeous grilled medium rare steak on a diner's plate.

Lack of interesting side vegetable dishes is odd, even if consistent with 'classic' steakhouse mentality. Our waiter did an excellent job of pairing wine with our courses.Most importantly is that while the steak was excellent, many restaurants nowadays do steak very well - without me having to pay $45 just for the steak. I am happy we went and do feel its a good restaurant, but I won't feel the need to go back there just to have superb steak that has nothing to really compliment in on the plate. For about half that price I can have steak that is just as superbly cooked, and comes with seasonal and sublimely prepared vegetables and starch.

I've never been here before but it was relatively easy to find with on and off street free parking (in Hartford? awesome!). Walking in, one of my classmates commented that it smelled like church--I wouldn't know, but it definitely has a worn and broken in feel to it--according to the website, the building was originally the Hartford Brick Carriage Factory, built in 1895, so yeah, it has some years on it. We sat at a big long wooden table in the middle of the restaurant and drinks all around were ordered--the Cabana for me--as we toasted to our final semester coming to an end.The menu is a limited, no fuss, bar menu with the usual suspects--burgers, salads, sandwiches and wings. I went with the chicken caesar wrap--the waitress mentioned that it came with potato chips but for an additional $1.75, I could swap to french fries. For me, this was kinda off-putting, but I went with the fries so I could share with a classmate (they were nothing exciting, save your money and stick with the chips!). The wrap itself was good, especially because I asked to have mine with the cajun chicken to give it a little extra kick. Karolina had the buffalo chicken salad--at first glance, she was disappointed that the chicken just had a bit of buffalo sauce poured on it instead of the chicken being coated in it, but after a few bites, she said it was enjoyable. A cup of house chili, an apple gorgonzola salad and a burger were among some of the dishes ordered at the rest of our table, with no major complaints noted.Overall, it was a nice lunch with the girls, but considering the other choices that Hartford has to offer, and the fact that the food here just isn't that exciting, I'd go somewhere else first.

Open layout with high ceilings, stage area in the back with lots of space in front, tables behind the open space, bar to the left, and an outdoor area to the right when you walk in. The whole place is very conducive to a great concert experience. There were lots of beers on tap, including the more interesting, and there were some good $4 specials (Brooklyn Summer and Anchor Steam!), which we stuck to. While there was a crowd, we got our beers pretty quickly. The ladies' room was clean, and while I didn't have to wait too long, there was a pretty nice waiting area inside, which I can appreciate. Parking was a little tough since Arch Street's own lot was full by the time we got there, but we were able to park on the street around the corner for free after 6.

The bartender rudely replied, \"well I'M not bringing it out...\" Rather than put up a stink my husband just politely asked when he should come back in to get it himself... What a you-know-what. Then the \"music manager\" saw us eating and said we didn't have to pay for the food since my husband was performing that night. Hmm... he seemed nice enough, but there was a serious disconnect between the \"music manager\" and the snotty servers. Another turnoff, which I realize doesn't pertain to non-performers, was that the music dude said we were supposed to arrive at 7pm...ummm my husband didn't go on until 11:30pm, so to ask us to arrive at 7pm is beyond ridiculous. We have other things going on in our life and it's unreasonable to expect us to sit around your crummy bar for almost 5 hours. No thanks. We arrived at 9 which is more than enough time to unload and chill out for a bit.

Honestly everything was yummy yummy yummy. They definitely know how to make a cocktail drink.4.)

I'm beginning to believe they don't have signature cocktails and need to update their menus. I would really be interested in someone who has actually gotten to experience their signature cocktails. At first Nix's offered happy hour food specials, now they just offer nachos and buck a shuck. The nachos reminded me of day old Chinese noodles and cheese.

Just to warm you up:I read the mixed reviews, and was always iffy on coming here. I believe a couple reviews noted this place for being bland and not so creative with their cooking. I can be honest, I sometimes like to feed into the hype. But that day I decided to be my own source of truth and reason, and let my taste buds do the critiquing. 2.) What your eyes may see:Upscale. Conservative. A place where ties, suits and brief cases come to for lunch and dinners. A place that people who are more established \u00a0would be able to eat (aka, middle aged and higher). Outside there's a valet parking guy, who is dressed up for business. This area right here almost reminds me of Manhattan, NY. A business professional type of atmosphere. At the host stand I was greeted by two smiling middle aged men with suits. Perhaps the Maitre'D? Perhaps the managers? No pin pointing it because it was lunch time. What your eyes may see is always what your hears may hear, a somewhat pretentious bunch. When you are there, I guess you should do as the romans do there, if you feel your lungs are vulnerable to the toxic air of snobbery. Grab a friend, family member or know one of the staff there and you will be set.3.) Food:The first thing I had was a small bread with butter and sea salt. The bread was soft and butter milky, and the butter was very rich and creamy. I had the veal and meatball panini. It was juicy, it was tasty. It came with parmesan cheese and spinach. Served with a side of parmesan fries, they cooked it to the way Anthony P. likes it which is crispy. I had a Pino Noir. I don't even remember the name.4.) Service:I sat at the bar side. My bartender's name was Scott. He was a very good guy. It was like he was a one man band, being able to gracefully serve food and drinks to the 10 patrons sitting at bar side and for the rest of the restaurant.5.) Impressions:I am coming back here to have some drinks, share some laughs. I'd like to check out more of the lunch menu and explore the dinner menu. I recommend dressing up a little, even if it's lunch time.

A lot of reviews for Max DT mentioned the price, which is worth mentioning on a travel site, but I found it to be a good trade. The staff was very attentive without leaving us feeling that they'd like to rush you through your meal to turn over the table. The food was excellent; a nice selection of entrees (various high-end meats and seafoods) in complimentary combinations with interesting ingredients. \u00a0The atmosphere was condusive to a leisurely, special meal with my two old colleagues who we don't get to see much. Great Martini !"], ["Chad S.", "While traveling around New England, a culinary highlight was to have dinner at Max Downtown - a classy chophouse in downtown Hartford.The atmosphere is classic steakhouse, bar on one side and dining room on the other side. Service was slow, as was the kitchen. The kitchen was so slow that our server kindly provided us with complimentary bowls of leek soup. When our entrees at last arrived, two of our three steaks came out overcooked. I stuck with my steak and just coupled it with lots of horseradish. My mother sent hers back.I was ready to write a loathing review but the management saved Max Downtown by visiting our table and then providing us with two extra side dishes (a value of $15) and a big dessert plate with three different desserts. Job well done."], ["Ashika B.", "Had a wonderful birthday dinner here. Our server was a delightful older gentleman named Bruce who described the Filet Mignon Oscar in such vivid detail that my husband and I both had to have it! Bruce was not exaggerating.

Max's Downtown has great ambiance, a nice clientele and impeccable service. However, the food is lacking. I've been there many times and have never been impressed and, at times, have left quite disappointed. The cobb salad is a mess, the turkey sandwich for lunch had way too much meat and too little anything else (greens, sauce, bread). the burger is fine but nothing special (same for the lobster roll). In all, great place to meet clients or co-workers for a business purpose but I would not recommend it as a place to enjoy a night out of good food."], ["Josh G.", "Very fancy, and good service.

I should have ordered medium well. \u00a0It was okay though bc they took it bad apologetically like it was their fault even though it wasn't and brought it back PERFECT. \u00a0My husband got the NY strip steak medium rare and LOVED IT. \u00a0I got my steak with a side of foie gras butter - OMG. it went very well with my filet mignon.

It was delicious and I highly recommend it.Main Course: I got the smoked salmon and garden veggies, he got chicken parm. The salmon was slightly overcooked so it wasn't as moist, but the sides were really good.Dessert: He got a chocolate mousse tart, and I got strawberry shortcake. Both were equally good.The restaurant is what most would call upscale..lots of snobs judging themselves and each other HOWEVER you could get away with business casual.

We had bacon wrapped figs, calamari, margarita flat bread and Thai wings- all very well done. The calamari was quite exceptional. I'll eat calamari, but generally don't really enjoy it.

I went here for my birthday with my mother. It was a little nondescript; I actually missed it and parked in the medical office building next door. The interior of the restaurant is super cute. It has two floors with an open balcony. Very classy. It also has a nice bar area. The ambiance is sophisticated, but casual at the same time. It's a classy place you don't have to dress up for. I'm all about lazy sophistication, so the atmosphere was perfect for me. From the inside, it would be hard to differentiate this place from a bar in Boston. Service was fast and polite.I ordered a flatbread with gorgonzola, fontina, brie & pear. It was amazing. Although it's somewhat trivial, the presentation was very nice. On first look it appeared to have too much arugula, but it turned out to be the right amount to compliment the cheese. I could only finish 3 or 4 slices and took the rest home. My mother got the truffle mac and cheese which she also really liked. I took off one star because their dessert menu is pretty bad. The only one I really wanted wasn't even available because apparently the freezer was broken (???). So if I was able to have the desert and it was good this could possibly be 5 stars. I think it's a truly hidden (maybe not hidden, i'm not sure. It was hidden to me!) gem in Bloomfield, CT."], ["Eddie C.", "I'm a man of a few words. This place is simply amazing.

Traffic was heavy on I-95 and I wanted to find a place for a quick bite...I fell in love with this place INSTANTLY! The bartenders were all kind and introduced themselves to me and sparked conversation. I was served immediately and felt right at home. As I watched other patrons get served I quickly learned that they treat everyone who comes in like family. They remember the favorite drinks of their regulars and practically have it ready as they sit down.The beer selection is solid, and the whiskey selection is superb!!! The menu had a tapestry of items fitting of a fantastic gastropub at very reasonable prices! I started with the truffle Parmesan popcorn which was AMAZING! It's easy to overdo it with truffle oil, but there's was perfect! Free that I got mussels with frites. The white wine sauce for the mussels was perfect, and the fries were solid and came with their own mini bottle of ketchup. My shells were disposed regularly (almost so fast that I didn't see it happen).This place is a gem, and I would go out of my way to have a drink and a bite at this place!

Usually I travel with a group - a large one- and I usually have to settle for classic American nothing to funky. So this trip I am alone. It's almost blissful to be honest So hubby sends me republic via yelp to check out. So our meeting ended very late and off I go for my little adventure. I arrive the parking lot is beyond packed. But luckily it being past 6 the bank next door has closed and has ample parking. I easily obtained a table for 1 in the dining room. The bar was a little busy. There is multiple dining spaces. The bar, bar high tops, upstairs dining room and a side dining room. \u00a0I was upstairs and next to a window. I ordered two items. First - The truffle onion soup. This arrives with cubed perfectly saut\u00e9ed onions in a pristine white bowl. Where the cream based truffle mushroom cream is delicately poured over the onion. \u00a0Truly delicious. My what I was expecting at all. \u00a0Very very rich, sensuous and heavy. Second - steak tartare. I gotta say am I sucker for this when I see it on a menu. It was a nice amount maybe 3 ounces. Spicy goodness of delicious steak. Served with a quail egg for dipping, a fris\u00e9e salad with quite interesting radish and perfectly lightly toasted baguette points. \u00a0I didn't dip into the quail egg the tartare was on point although I usually prefer it with more texture (more chopped than this one was) it was a very tasty concoction and I will get over texture. I had no room for desert after all that. Nor capacity for a drink. So off to the hotel I went and enjoying my drink writing this review."], ["Susie K.", "This place was solid, but not up to the hype. We did a double date night here last Friday. The place was jamming so we had to sit outside, which wasn't too bad because it was a nice summer evening.The food was good, just kind if randomly priced. Some items were reasonable, like the burgers (my buddy paid $13.50 for a delicious patty melt), but some items were just expensive, like some of the sides and appetizers and my \"big\" plate of gnocchi, which was $17, without the chicken (not a big plate at all, btw). We got the mole nachos for an appetizer, which was enough for the 4 of us. The mix of sweet and spicy was pretty amazing. The cocktails were nice. I had a thyme and nectarine sweet tea and my friend had a Dial L for Lavender. The boys had beer, which Republic had a decent selection of and is pretty difficult to mess up. Overall, not bad. But it didn't blow my skirt up either. If I come back, it'll be for the happy hour, which looks pretty awesome."], ["Jess L.", "Definitely the best bar I've come to in a while. I love the rustic, classy feel. There's light, trendy music in the background but not enough to stifle a conversation. While there are a couple of large tables, most of the tables are set-up for smaller parties. Sitting on the 2nd floor lends a fun, bird's eye view of the majority of the crowd.The wine menu is smaller than the beer menu, but the wines are carefully selected. I had a Matchbook Cab that was stellar ($10/glass).I also was blown away by my salmon burger, which included a miso glaze and kimchi. Loved the flavor, and the fish was succulent. It was probably one of the best salmon burgers/sandwiches I've ever had.Parking in the back is limited, so opt for parking in the Wells Fargo parking lot."], ["Anita C.", "Went for a company happy hour on Wednesday 5-6:30 p. They're happy hour ends at 6 pm so get there before then if you want a discounted price on drinks! It's typical to see professionals dressed in suits and ties as its a nice place to have a group dinner or gathering, especially since it's close to windsor and simsbury where some of the companies are located. It was awesome to have a tall glass of beer for less than $4! Amazing deal! They even had appetizers for half price which we didn't try but definitely looked worth it! They own a few other locations and all seem to be pretty successful. I will definitely go back sometime to try their food!

There are a number of small cafe tables in that area too for couples or for a couple of friends. The bottle and draft beer selection is very nice and the tap system, I must say, provided an unusually cold beer, \u00a0indicative of a clean very well maintained beer system with no off flavor notes due to residual chemical cleaners.

Always fast, always professional, and the food is always on point. I've also been here twice with giant groups of ten or more people.

I had the latter, which, like the appetizers, was prepared and presented a little uniquely, making it that much better than most I've had elsewhere. The beer and bourbon selection was very good.

But with a (literal) wink of the eye one of the chefs brought it out half way through my eating rampage. The loud bartender ...(again this is literal...she talked so loud to the people sitting at the bar I wasn't sure if she knew they were hard of hearing or if she wanted her manager to know people listened to her!) ...had asked if I wanted the check... I quickly told her I could not leave without dessert. And with that one of the line cooks offered me a scoop of their specialty ice cream. It doesn't matter what it was...it only matters that whatever the special ice cream is of the day...it MUST be ordered. Heaaaaavenly flavor. If I ever find myself at the Bradley airport again...

My favorite thing about Republic is definitely their bar menu! A great selection of craft cocktails, wines and local craft beers, and an AWESOME happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm). I'm currently obsessed with their barrel aged manhattan - orange & cherry infused 4 roses bourbon, carpano antica formula, angostura bitters and a luxardo maraschino cherry.

Do you want to take a date out for a nice dinner, but want to avoid talking to her? Are you and your dining companions deaf? Then this is your place.

Plus, they did not seem particularly sophisticated in wine; they could only tell us that one section was bigger bodied while others were lighter bodied - information we already knew.

I have had this place bookmarked in Yelp for about 4-5 years, and the other yelp reviews are spot on. I also stumbled upon the culinary blog of one of the chef's a Cavey's.

I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back at this point but I still hope they start to draw more of a crowd!"], ["Lesley M.", "A 3.5 star review rounded down to a 3 star...The Restaurant.com deal with Laetus prompted my husband and me to try this place. \u00a0Though it was a new restaurant (opened in 2013), I saw both some growing pains (one of the staff's young child hanging out) and potential (expansive Asian-fusion tapas menu). \u00a0Since the dining area was not the warmest (both literally and figuratively), we sat and ate at the bar. \u00a0Luckily for us, Nikki was our bartender/waitress and she was very easy to talk to. \u00a0Having her there was definitely a plus!The menu was very expansive with tapas, pho, and entrees. \u00a0We ordered tempura bacon, steamed buns, spicy beef pho, and an entr\u00e9e. \u00a0I agreed with my husband that the tempura bacon needed a sauce, like some sort of a maple-flavored dip. \u00a0The steamed buns stuffed with egg and Chinese sausage was very novel and satisfying. \u00a0The gem of the meal was the spicy beef pho, which my hubby and I shared a large bowl. \u00a0The broth had a lot of flavor and there was a lot going on in the soup; spices, meat, noodles, and herbs. \u00a0In fact, it was one of the best phos I have had in the Hartford area.The pit of the meal was the mashed plantains with shrimp and avocado puree. \u00a0It was on the borderline of pathetic; the bananas looked rotten; the avocado puree was more liked watered down avocado mix; the shrimp was cheap and we only got five. \u00a0I also would avoid the margarita too.My advice is to order up on the tapas and soup and to skip on the entrees and mixed signature drinks.Bring your Restaurant.com certificate!"], ["Jason M.", "I am on board with the general consensus that Laetus is good, with room for improvement.Nikki took great care of us at the bar... I just wanted to make that very clear first. She's a very nice bartender who takes her job seriously. Makes a mean drink, makes small talk, suggests beverages you may like. I had a \"Black & Red,\" Guinness floated on top of hard cider. Whoda thunk that'd be any good?There were some food flubs. The Tempura Bacon was very good, but would have been better with the sauces it was supposed to come with... a fact we learned after finishing it. Also, the Mangu was a very plain dish. To me, it appeared like little more than a mound of mashed plantains, some thinned out guacamole, and plain shrimp. Which is probably what it was.They're trying to be creative, and for that they deserve applause. Our Steamed Buns (which were cleverly stuffed), and the Spicy Beef Pho were both very good. Their signature drink menu is rife with interesting options. The prices are more than fair; Pho is $7 for a small, $10 for a large, and the entrees are $15 and under.A little more professionalism is what's needed here above all else. There was a small kid in the dining room for a good portion of the evening, perhaps the managers' child. Sorry, hardworking parents of the world, but that's just not appropriate for an adult lounge. The menu's gotta improve some too.We'll see how they do. They're in a great location, so at least they've got the foot traffic."], ["Julia W.", "I visited Laetus late night after a recent Yelp event in Hartford. I'd never heard of it, but it was the one place open that was both open, and served vegetarian options. Sold. My friend and I walked in to a semi-chaotic scene. No one was at the front desk and there was a man who was so under the influence of something that he was literally just kind of floating in the front reception area, and no one was doing anything about him. When we were finally seated, we were then greeted by a server who seemed pretty lost. She took our drink order, and then our appetizer order. She was unable to answer about portion size or ingredients. Our two drinks came out separately. Followed quite awhile later by the appetizer. We ordered the veggie summer rolls, and they were absolutely excellent. We were also served a complimentary trio of sauces with chips. Had the chips not been of the bottom of the bag crushed variety, this also would have been exceptionally good, as the sauces were fantastic. Our food order was taken, and by the time it came out, after checking with our server twice on its whereabouts, we didn't even want it anymore. However, I was with a friend who is not big on complaining so we took a few bites then got containers to take it home. We ordered the fried rice, which was forgettable and flavorless at best, and a salad that was advertised as caprese, but ended up being a garden salad drenched in dressing, with some mozzarella thrown in. Edible, but definitely not good. We ended up giving our leftovers away to hungry friends at a party because we didn't even want them. Our server was so discombobulated that she didn't understand how to even split our bill, and I had to request that she ask someone else for help, after she came back twice to our table, trying to do math in her head. Ridiculous. The one thing I loved about Laetus was the live jazz they had going when we walked in. I would definitely go back for drinks, summer rolls, and jazz. But really, that's all this place has going for it."], ["Rachael F.", "I bought a Restaurant.com gift certificate for Laetus and went with my \u00a0mom for dinner at around 6pm on a Thursday evening. It is billed as both a restaurant and lounge, but I was surprised to walk in at 6pm to find the lights very low with loud music. It's certainly not my ideal setting for dinner, but hey...yolo. There was what looked like an office Christmas happy hour going on at the same time. They had lots of tables reserved with platters of apps and crudite. Other than that, it was empty.Our server was so friendly, welcoming, and helpful. She was such a sweetheart and gave me a complimentary sample of mafongo, a mashed plantain side dish. She explained the menu to us and told us a bit about how the restaurant changed up its overall concept since opening last year.My mom ordered a glass of wine and was not impressed with the pour for $7. For an appetizer, we had the chicken satay with peanut sauce. The chicken was juicy and the sauce had such great flavor. For our meals, I ordered the traditional pho and my mom ordered the Asian stir fry. Hers was slightly bland, but I was quite happy with mine. The sliced brisket was a little tough, but the broth was tasty and the portion was HUGE. $10 gets you a massive bowl of soup that both of us together couldn't finish. The vermicelli was delicious. Our waitress suggested that I try the spicy beef and sausage soup in the future, as it was her favorite. I would absolutely return for some yummy soup on a cold day."], ["Aaron L.", "I went to the restaurant at 5 o'clock on a Sunday to get some pho. I eat pho more frequently than any other food, ranging from 5 times a week to once, so I know when a place is good. The pho or beef noodle soup here was not. The broth was white from not rinsing off the rice noodles. The noodles were overcooked and couldn't be picked up by chopsticks. There was about 3 oz of cooked beef or 3 slices. The beef was marinated in what tasted like Korean barbeque or Vietnamese seasoning, whereas typically the beef served in pho is raw and unseasoned. The size large was smaller than all of the larges I've ordered in the past.The place was nice, but empty. This resonated when presumably the owner came to talk to me about my ethnicity and if I spoke her native tongue. The owners daughter asked me if I played Nintendo 64 and suggested I bring friends to do so. Then she preceded to show me the sound system by turning it up while I eat, hoping I would like it and tell my friends. After I paid and was leaving she said to bring some friends and that she would see me soon. Tldr:Small portion of meat/phoImproperly made phoDesperate and nosey owners"], ["Sanh A.", "Laetus has so much potential! \u00a0The hours are amazing and Hartford needs a pho place that's clean and open late. The staff was amazing! In fact they were out of this world attentive. I went for the pho and nothing more.The pho was okay but I was a tad disappointed with the sides. Iceberg lettuce for garnishing? \u00a0The place was definitely clean. Laetus is a place you take friends who want to try pho for the first time and who you know will be turned off if you bring them to a place with Mitch-match chairs. \u00a0It's a good introduction to pho but it wouldn't be a place I would run to when I'm craving pho. I didn't leave thinking the pho was all that great, I left with a belly full of noodles. If I was downtown more I would stop by but to go exclusive for the pho, probably not."], ["Sarah M.", "Yikes. Found this place on resteraunt .com when i was in town for a meeting. I was the only one in there. Completely alone. The bartender was nice. I think he was the owner? Only reason this is getting two stars. Ordered a bunch of food. Mozz sticks. Burned. How do you mess that up? Plantains. Un-edible. \u00a0French fries. Odd seasoning but I ate them. I almost felt bad for the company and still paid. Little elderly lady severed us. She was nice. Seriously service is the the only 2 stars I'm giving them. I wouldn't go. Good music. Maybe? No one in there!"], ["Bo Ae L.", "Arrived Saturday night and We had a long day. There was a dj which was pretty cool. I came in well knowing this is an Asian fusion restaurant and not a legit Vietnamese/Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant so comparing them to the ones back in my hometown New York would be unfair. My high review is mostly because our waitress Briana was great. She was attentive and sweet and very patient. And the dj was pretty cool too. The food was decent. My group of five ordered the chicken soup, skewers, the pho and the banh Mi. The pho's broth wasn't the delicate savory type of normal Vietnamese restaurants but even the small was filling. Some of the dishes are either massive or tiny. The banhmi was smaller than average and could use some more filling especially the meat and pickled veggies to give it that memorable punch as was the skewers but the large soups were HUGE. The chicken soup my friend had was really quite nice And the free table side sweet potato chips and dips were Wonderful.Another issue was the restaurant tends to have a lot of things sold out but Our waitress apologized so often and was so willing to accommodate/checked us regularly I happily chose other thing off the menu. It's a shame I wasn't in a drinking mood but the money I would have spent I gave as a tip because she really earned it. Thank you briana!"], ["Kerri P.", "Yep, totally a fan. From the SATC reference on the menu to the complimentary bowls of taro chips to the refreshing Flirtinis, I couldn't be much happier. My partner and I split sweet potato fries and summer rolls. He was hungry, I was just noshing to not seem irresponsible while having a few martinis. They will soon be adding some Latin-inspired dishes to the Asian-fusion menu. This is going to be my new place to schedule meetings, no lie. (Though I was a fan of the previous tenants, pizza places, the decor is much tidier and improved now)"], ["Alexander D.", "Stopped by for lunch with a friend. We heard they serve pho and it was a cold, rainy day. Laetus isn't known as a lunch place, so this was an experiment.Laetus was a pleasant surprise. My friend had traditional Vietnamese pho, while I had beef noodle. Both were made to order, fresh. Prices were very reasonable for lunch. Will go back again.Only 3 stars since the atmosphere was Spartan and the service was a tad slow. Good place; check it out."], ["Dan S.", "Came here for lunch during their \"soft opening\". They expect to have their grand opening soon so I'll reserve full judgment (and the extra star) unil then and won't be too hyper-critical because this place has all the makings of a keeper in downtown Hartford.Had the spicy beef noodle soup and it didn't disappoint. It definitely had the spice factor going on. Love when places aren't afraid to kick things up a notch. It'll clear the sinuses and had a nice rich beef flavor to the brother. Wish it had another piece of beef or two in there for the price. ($9.99 for a large bowl). \u00a0But with fresh sprouts (and the usual additions to Pho) on the side, it worked quite nicely.Friend at the pho and also really enjoyed it too. Good deep flavor on the broth, which makes the whole dish.We also tried the banh mi chicken sandwich to start. Well done dish with a fresh baguette. So important. \u00a0So, what are the minor quibbles? The iced tea was good, but refills were charged another $2.50. That seems a little petty for iced tea that can't cost nearly that much. \u00a0And the overall prices are on the higher end of the spectrum. $6.50 for banh mi, for example. \u00a0Not outrageous at all (and fairly in line with what Tamarind does for Thai food a few blocks away) but at that price point, you've got to nail things. \u00a0 And offering water with the meal should be a given. \u00a0But service was friendly and moved well. \u00a0Again, it's still in soft opening and those minor trifles shouldn't dissuade the downtown crowd from giving this place a try. \u00a0Finally, Vietnamese food in Downtown."], ["Dan R.", "So how do I rate this? First of all - the food was freaking great !! Shu Mai and egg roll appetizers were outstanding. The dumplings were velvety, delicate and had great flavor and texture. The egg rolls were stellar- crisp but not oily and very flavorful with nice hunks of shrimp. Our entr\u00e9es both revolved around grilled chicken. We had the Vermicelli w/ Grilled Chicken (Bun Thit Nuong) served w/ crushed roasted peanuts, cucumbers, lettuce, bean sprouts, basil leaves, & mint, and the Grilled Chicken (Com Ga) marinated grilled tender dark meat w/ rice & mixed vegetables. \u00a0The grilled chicken in these dishes was incredible- bursting with flavor and perfectly grilled. The accompanying vermicelli, rice, veggies and sauce perfectly complemented the chicken. Our Taste of Hartford dinner included a dessert. All they had were a slice of carrot cake or Oreo Mousse cake. We tried both, and preferred the carrot cake.So the food was excellent, now for the rest. Our table overlooked the front windows - so we had a great view of a vagrant sifting through the restaurant's ash tray looking for cigarette butts. We had a great view of some random and sketchy guys sitting in the storefront chairs to check their cell phones. The internal atmosphere was weird too. We were there at 7:00 on a Saturday, and the dining room was empty except for an obnoxiously loud table of 12. They seemed to tie up the wait staff, and I use the term loosely because there was one server and although she was sweet as could be and cute as a button, she really seemed lost out there on the dining room floor. Long periods of inattention and unusually long waits for drinks. What's weird is that she did show us some very thoughtful moments- like asking us if we wanted small plates to share our appetizers, and offering to bring us extra sauce when we ran out. But she did have her deficiencies, and her interminable schmoozing with the bartender instead of checking on us was a problem in my eyes. \u00a0I get it that Laetus seems to be more of a lounge or bar that serves great food. \u00a0Sorry, that's not my bag. Maybe a take-out bag would be my best option."], ["Paige N.", "Asian fusion DJ dance parties complete with neon glowing and blinking party cube decorations, here I come! Let's all get off our butts, get downtown and pretend we live in Manhattan. I came for the Taste of Hartford menu, and the portion sizes a little too small for my liking, but this is typical of the \"taste\" menus of this week of restaurant promotions. No complaints really- $20.13 is a good price for three courses. I had the shrimp shumai (served in little bamboo steamer bowls), bahn mi and hazelnut mousse cake and carrot cake (we split dessert). This year has been a discovery of the glory that is Vietnamese food. Forever I will remember 2013---job changes, new apartment, Yelp, pho, bahn mi. Banh Mi- WHERE in the world have you been all my life? Yes, Vietnam, but you've also been right in my backyard. Pho Boston, A Dong, Pho Saigon. So many wonderful places full of delectable culinary treasures. Bahn mi honestly might be the best damn sandwich I've ever had. Seriously. I know I'm an effusive person, but really. Pickled daikon radishes and carrots, mayo, teriyaki chicken (or beef or pork), fresh cilantro (ON A SANDWICH not a taco!), jalapenos, and a crusty french baguette. A mixture of cultures and history all wrapped up into one amazing freakin' sandwich. I've wanted to try bahn mi for so long and for some reason it took me until now. So, lucky Laetus will forever be held in high regard due to my unforgettable bahn mi experience. I've had shumai before, and this was wonderful shumai. Dessert was average, I would have preferred something Asian and funky, something I never tried before, so I could have another culinary revelation and \"what the hell have I been eating all my life?\" moment. So, inspired by Laetus, I headed over to A Dong, Whole Foods and Trader Joes to grab all of the essential ingredients necessary (and then some!) for making my own bahn mi (learning later that you can get all of it just at A Dong- including pickled daikon/carrot mixture pre-made). I'm going to eat bahn mi (spicy tofu from A Dong and chicken marinated in teriyaki sauce) all damn week long and enjoy it. I mostly love restaurants because they inspire me to be a more creative cook. Thanks, Laetus. I'll be back....your ambiance made for some impromptu dance parties, (rockin' to old school rap while relishing in carrot cake [plate garnished beautifully with shaved carrots, might I add] and dreaming about my devoured bahn mi)."], ["Sandra L.", "Tried to go here for dinner on either June 20 or 21st after reading the promising review in the Courant. There was road construction in front and on the side. \u00a0The front door to the restaurant was not locked, so we opened it.

We paid a $5 cover for each of us (5) ordered twice and never got drinks."], ["Kate G.", "This restaurant gets one star - and that's because at least the food was good. My boyfriend frequented this restaurant's bar and wanted to try the food. We thought the restaurant.com certificate was a good opportunity to give it a try. WRONG.We were the only people in the restaurant aside from another couple at the bar for the duration of this experience. The service was on the slower side, but the most annoying part was that there was one woman who was clearly doing everything (cooking and communicating with us) and the older woman usually needed to call on her by screaming for her down some hole in the wall which must have led to the basement. The food we ordered was pretty decent... no dealbreaking complaints until the bill.It took them about ten minutes, together, behind the bar, to get our bill together. They told us they wouldn't accept our resturaunt.com certificate because we didn't print it out and I argued that the agreement with restaurant.com does not require the voucher to be printed (they made a mobile app for a reason! get with the times!)... after much back and forth she agrees to let my boyfriend upload it onto their computer. She then accused him of not showing her HIS voucher, though he was logged into his own account. In the midst of all of this she tells us that she'll do us this \"favor,\" but when we come back we need to print the voucher AND show it to them ahead of time. After being given such a hard time and dealing with their service, I responded that I didn't think we would be coming back. She then threw her hands up and said that if I wasn't coming back to Laetus, that she wasn't going to do me \"a favor\" by printing the certificate. She literally stomped off behind the bar and I felt like I was dealing with a nine year old child. After about 5-10 minutes of this argument including offering to call the police, we told her that we were paying our bill (less the restaurant.com coupon) in cash and leaving. Then she finally agreed to take a picture of the voucher...Needless to say, my boyfriend I won't be back to eat, and he and his friends won't be hitting up Laetus for drinks anymore! Moral of the story - these people need to learn about how to do business because they clearly don't know how to handle issues professionally."], ["Lauren B.", "A friend and I were extremely excited to try this restaurant for the first time tonight, however, we left really disappointed.We put in our order and they were out of 2 of the 5 things we ordered. I was really excited to try the pork buns and the Hong Kong wonton soup, but they were out of both. Very disappointing.We ordered the shumai and summer rolls, which were just okay. The tempura bacon lacked flavor. The pho wasn't terrible, but I've had way better. The place was practically empty and the service was so-so.This restaurant has a prime location in Hartford and it's a shame that the food isn't top notch. I think it is poor form to be \"out\" of menu items when the place is a ghost town. This place needs to shape up! Won't be back for the foreseeable future."], ["Shane G.", "If there were a place near Ann St that reminded me of exactly how sad downtown Hartford is, this place would be a gutsy competitor for first place. The Whalers made the right decision to leave, if you ask me.Sparkly bar, more flat screen TVs than folks who would want to watch them, mediocre mixed drinks and questionable food prep. The place reminds me more of an undersized wanna-be night club than a restaurant. This place is exactly the reason people don't want to live downtown; douchey, half-hearted restaurants who can't even commit to their own hours. The edamame was like rock candy but with soy beans instead of wooden sticks and salt instead of sugar. The spring rolls were weirdly wet with a funky, this-shrimp-may-be-past-its-prime filling and a peanut sauce that tasted like it had old, flat beer mixed in. The bahn mi was anorexic, dripping with honey and starving for filling while still sticky enough to make me want to wash my hands half way through consuming.The one waitress (bartender) working there told us to ask her for our entrees when we were done with our appetizers (mostly because she was ignoring us cutting fruit for the next day). When we finished our apps she immediately brought the rest of the food, meaning it had been sitting there the whole time. If you get a drink with citrus in it, I would say the likelihood that citrus was cut that day is slim to none.As we left, at 5:00pm, there was another couple trying to come in and meeting a set of curiously locked doors. The bartender laughed, chuckling that she closed up already. As we walked out the door, perfectly timed, they asked us if the restaurant was open or not. It's not really my responsibility to disappoint your customers for you, but somehow we were left with the confusing responsibility of doing just that.

I love supporting Hartford and local businesses so we decided to go here on Valentine's Day. We are big fans of Asian fusion restaurants so we were excited to give this place a try. The first indication of a poor customer experience was the attempt to make reservations. It appears that the owners weren't too concerned about providing an experience for their patrons, we called three times and kept getting voicemail. Finally a woman called back and asked why we called. We made the reservations anyway and that evening headed to the restaurant. The restaurant had zero atmosphere and the staff was more focused on hanging out than helping us. When we were finally greeted we were told to sit wherever we wanted, but there wasn't many options. Most of the chairs were missing and the settings that were there were awkwardly placed throughout the restaurant. We sat next to the window, big mistake. There was a speaker blasting dated R&B music, which normally would have been fun had it not been for the entertainment tuning their piano and singing horribly into the microphone. We waited for about 20 mins with no menu or greeting. Finally a waitress came by to give us menus, it was clear the poor girl was the only one on the floor so we really sympathized with her. She immediately brought us water and then disappeared, never taking our drink order or anything. We finally got fed up with waiting and listening to the band tune up to seemingly annoy us.

They come with a side of creamy avocado dipping sauce.- Bahn Mi sandwich with pork, although they run out of the pork a lot. Something I wish they would work on.- Pho soup. I'm constantly craving pho, and yes I've had much better elsewhere, but the broth is amazing and the portion of beef is substantial.I think they should change the noodles they use, they seem cheap and too thin and get mushy very fast. Either way, it still gives me that \"drunk on pho\" feeling that makes me want to take a nap! (Which is a good thing)I look forward to trying more of their entrees next time.
