It was delicious and quite filling, to the point where I didn't want to finish it for fear that I wouldn't be able to eat my entree.The shrimp and pineapple curry was likewise excellent-- well-seasoned, with lots of shrimp. It wasn't crazy spicy, which I appreciated, and the portion was large enough for two people.In sum, my advice to you, prospective King and I patron, is two-fold: 1) remember to B your own B, and 2) consider splitting an entree unless you're famished or want leftovers."], ["Byron D.", "This is a small restaurant in a part of town that does not have much off street parking. \u00a0Fortunately The King and I has a large safe parking lot.

Good quantity and very delicious."], ["Todd A.", "Finally got here. Wasn't expecting much; the feel I got was hype from people who don't know Thai, or who have had a bad experience. Hot Basil was closed, and was craving Thai so....Backing up; the people making this happen for you are Lao. Now, don't jump to conclusions; in my limited experience with persons of other cultures serving Thai, the Lao do a credible job. Only done that place in Blue Back twice, but both times very sweet, which is a trademark of Cambodians. Which is what the people bringing that particular flavor of Thai are. My wife is VN; she said, \"They have a bowl of sugar on their tables.\" And, I asked the hostess at the place in BBSq; she confirmed.Back to K&ITK; I'd stopped in a couple times previously to get a to-go menu. Not impressed; workers were distant. But, this early SAT afternoon, got someone who was all of personable and friendly and helpful. I got take-out; its generally easier, but seems things would be fine in this small dining area, as long as its in off-hours and she can run around w/o getting into too much trouble.A pet peeve are servers who can't make recommends. It can cost up to two stars, in an extreme case.Anyway, Ms Friendly guided me to some good dishes. I generally get the Som Tum; this was a goodly portion and had heat that built on the palate as one got further into the dish. Red curry w/ chix was both spicy and tasty. Companion deemed it her fave. Thai Basil Duck was another fave, notably w/ my toddler. Jungle curry rounded out the meal, and it was tasty. Lots of veggies, but also a reasonable amount of protein defined the dishes. Prices were at or about comparable to other places around, but flavor and portion distinguishes this from many others. East-West is still my fave, but I'll return to K&ITK."], ["Alice C.", "Came here last Saturday for lunch with a friend. When we arrived at 12, there were no one in the restaurant, it took about a minute before anyone realized we were there. The food arrived promptly and the waitress came back to check on us frequent enough. We ordered the green papaya salad, one of my favorite Thai dishes. It was very well done. I ordered the Panang curry, the portion was enough for me for two meals. The dish was also very nicely done. Both the dishes were authentic, and home made good. My friend ordered a Laotian dish, it was a stir fry beef dish with sticky rice. I never had Laotian food before but this dish was a-okay but I love the sticky rice.I have been looking for an authentic Thai restaurant in the Hartford area, although this is less fancier than the Thai restaurants you will find in Blueback square, but to me this is superior for its authenticity and I will definitely be back for more.On a side note, I left my purse at the restaurant and realized it about 15 minutes later, when I got back it was safely tucked away by my server behind the counter. She couldn't have been a better lifesaver."], ["Tianna G.", "Another Hartford favorite. This was my first Thai food experience and whenever I eat Thai now, I usually rate it thinking, \"Yeah, but was it King and I good?\" The place is often overlooked by those who don't know it. It looks like a regular red and white house that happens to have a parking lot in the front. There's a sign out front, but I've lived in Hartford my whole life and never realized that the sign and parking lot weren't for the small restaurants next door.Step inside and there's about 10 tables sitting inside what looks like a living room. The first time I saw it, I thought everyone would be cramped and unable to move, but it's actually very cozy. You really feel like you're eating in someone's home. Adding to that is the friendly service from the staff. You're greeted with warm smiles and hellos as soon as you walk in the door. The menu is very easy to navigate but if you're a newbie to Thai food, any of the servers would be happy to suggest something. My favorite is the drunken noodles (pad kee mao) with shrimp. Best drunken noodles I've had and now I won't eat them anywhere else. Other than some specials, all dishes are available in beef, chicken, pork, shrimp and tofu and are easily modified for the picky eater. They also serve amazing duck! Vegetarians rejoice because there are plenty of options for you and all are just as tasty as their meaty counterparts. You won't just feel like you're eating a careless side dish, but the food stands out on its own. And the portions are fantastic.Another plus that I love is that King and I isn't like some restaurants that have one menu for lunch and completely different, wildly more expensive menus for dinner. Their dinner prices are only about $1 more than lunch which means all day long they're reasonable. It's BYOB, so grab a great bottle of wine before you get there."], ["Rebekah R.", "We were driving thru Hartford, from a long trip thru NY and decided we had a craving for some Thai. \u00a0Looked it up on Yelp (OF COURSE!) and The King and I was suggested. \u00a0I have only had a thai a handful of times, so I can't go on too much. \u00a0I ordered the Pad Thai, which was amazing! I have had a pad thai several other times, and this was by far the best. The servers were quick, and friendly...although we were the only ones there. \u00a0This would definitly be difficult to find, had we not found the suggestion. \u00a0It just looks like someones house with a big parking lot. \u00a0Prices were good. Will be back if ever driving thru town again. \u00a0I would recommend!"], ["Anthony P.", "1.) Introduction:I decided to come here after reading reviews and a recommendation given to me by my Laotian friend. That was enough credibility to eat here.2.) What your eyes may see:a.) Outside:It's located in the Parkville section of Hartford. So just over the lines of West Hartford. This part of Parkville is what I believe a predominantly Brazilian community, though there are some Dominican businesses here, too. They have their own parking lot and it seems pretty nice.b.) Inside:It kinda has that homely feel to it. The rugs appear a little old (I notice stuff like that because I have asthma). The back area, which I believe where the kitchen is seems \u00a0a little cluttered. I definitely feel like I'm in somebody's house. The lighting is dimly lit, but I don't know if that is due to old lights. I like how one of the workers is cutting food in the dining area. Once again, I feel like I'm inside someone's home and I am a guest. This maybe a Sanitary Grade \"A\" place but their methods state otherwise. The glass and dinnerware that were set on the table appears to be the same glass and dinnerware that was on the table of previous guests. They probably figure, if they aren't using it then why constantly switch it out? Well that is not totally true. The fact that this glass was mouth side down yet touched by me when eating, could be applied to the previous guests and their possibility of handling it. Even though I wasn't drinking out of this glass, I still found myself playing around with it a few times to move it out the way.3.) Food:I got the Chili duck. I was in the mood for something spicy. Like my pizza and burger places, I always have a basis for a restaurant I'm new to eating at. With Thai restaurants I always go for duck first. I told the waitress I want it \"not American hot.......but THAI hot!\" She smiled and said okay. She came back with the food and I was happy to see the portion size. Yesssss, now I have a little for now, a little for later, and maybe a little for even later! This duck dish was primarily vegetable than duck. A huge dish, with loads veggies, and not much duck! I'm still debating what the duck's portion size was on this place. Some of the slices had cartilage in it. The chili dish was below my expectations. I asked for it to be \"Thai\" spicy and NOT American spicy. I really feel they underestimate this American's tongue (American with foreigners as parents). They thought by shaking some extra crushed red pepper it was going to make me go \"Wooooohooooooo!\" Crushed red pepper is like Black Pepper to me, it's more of a flavor enhancer than a spice. Also the sauce or curry itself was VERY sweet and salty. I was basically served a dish in an Americanized way......overly salted and sweetened with mild spiciness. Apparently that's what we Americans find as most flavorful, sugar and salt. *Now eat up!*4.) Service:My waitress initially was sweet and smiling. She did not check on me throughout the whole dining experience. Oops, I'm sorry. She did check on me, only when I looked over and she asked me sitting from afar in a dinner table, \"are you okay?\" (Said with an 'oops I'm sorry, I forgot about you, I feel bad' face). When I asked for the check she came by the table and rather placing it, she tossed it onto the table. Wow.5.) Impressions:I don't know if they treat certain customers like this, but I definitely did not feel I was treated well. Maybe they have had certain situations where coincidentally individuals who represented my skin tone have done them bad. What a shame...*tisk tisk tisk.* I paid $18 dollars and what I got was negligent service, with a duck dish overly sweetened and salted with little spiciness. I still gave the darn waitress 20% tip. Forget your stereotypes, I've heard them before. Don't worry THIS Black guy tips........AND........tips well! Please don't tell me how this is authentic poor Thai people food, because if it was.........it should have been cheaper! I definitely would have respected this place more if the dish was $8, because with the service and dish it was worth that much! $18 and i'm definitely demanding to be treated like a well valued customer. More importantly I am not coming back here. I don't keep all of my Duck eggs in one basket. There are bigger ducks to fry. There are plenty of other great places in Hartford for Thai. *lays gavel down, takes off white wig and black gown, then walks out of court room*"], ["Soukkha M.", "The food is authentic and at a great price!

None of that watered down spice offered by some other Asian trucks.The downside is that they can be slow.

Who would have thought this small town would have such a spectacular Thai restaurant? We were immediately struck by how friendly and perfectly attentive our waitress was. She was very pleasant and not pushy at all. The menu is huge and includes many photos if you need help.Dare I say, Mae Kong had the best pad thai I've ever had - and I've had lots of pad thai. Sure, it might not seem like it's hard to mess up pad thai, but theirs had the perfect balance of flavors and quantity of ingredients.I will definitely make it a point to come back here when I am next in the area."], ["Katie H.", "It took us 3 months to use our Groupon, but my boyfriend and I finally tried this place (which came highly praised by our friends), and we weren't disappointed! I ordered the drunken noodles with beef, which were delicious. The noodles were cooked perfectly, sauce was flavorful, and the spiciness just perfect for me. I really appreciated how generous they were with the beef and vegetables too. Each time I thought I was out of beef, I would unearth another slice hidden underneath a noodle. The portion itself was plentiful, and my boyfriend had to help me finish it. He got the pra ram with squid (squid in a peanut sauce), and it was also extremely well-prepared. The squid was perfectly cooked, and the peanut sauce was addictive. The squid portion was a little small, but for the price, I thought it was reasonable. It came with a choice of jasmine, brown, or sticky rice, and of course we chose the sticky rice. It came in a little steamer basket, and it had just the right amount of chew to it. For dessert, we had the fresh mango with sweet sticky rice. It was deceptively small but ended up being just enough. The mango was ripe and sweet, and the sticky rice was again, perfectly cooked. The sauce could have been a little thicker, but that's a minor complaint. It was the perfect ending to a flawless meal.What really made this 5 stars though was the service. Both of the ladies who served us were very friendly and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. The restaurant itself is small, but but not cramped. It's not in the nicest part of town, but we didn't feel unsafe. There's only street parking, so be prepared to feed a meter if it's a weekday. This is the first case I've encountered of a Groupon restaurant that I would be perfectly happy paying full price for.

The machine was down at the time which meant we couldn't use the card and we were told we could come back at a later time to fix the issue... but the machine was never up & running for months. So, blue chip users beware! But, as a regular customer, it really is a little gem in the downtown area. The food is fresh and my favorite has to be the spring rolls. So yummy!

The manager (owner?) came over and refused to take my food back, and suggested I could order and pay for another dish if that's what I wanted. I sat and watched my friend eat her meal for a few minutes, and asked the waitress over and again expressed that this food was not satisfactory, and I could not eat it.

We loved Thai and live in New Britain, but had somehow missed Mae Kong before now. They have been there almost two years so I'm bummed we didn't come here before now. I had the Veggie Tofu soup to start and it was okay. It had lots of veggies, but the broth needed a little spice because it was a little bland. It did have the most veggies of any veggie soups I've had out at any type of Asian restaurant. For the main course, we had Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodle) and Crispy Duck. The drunken noddle had great veggies and noodles, but I did not care for the flavor, which bummed me out, but the Crispy Duck was really good. My husband got that and it had plenty of spice and he likes really spicy food. The house sauce was awesome. I had some on some rice and it had an excellent flavor- I would just have to ask them to make the dish a little less spicy if I ordered this meal. I uploaded pictures of each of our dishes and his Thai Iced Coffee which was delish.For dessert, my husband got Mochi Thai Ice Cream which is three pieces and you get to pick what flavors you want from strawberry, chocolate, green tea, mango, and vanilla. I'm not a huge mochi fan, but my husband is and he liked it. Next time I want to try the taro pearls in hot coconut cream. I've never had that before. I found that the had a large dessert menu- larger than most Thai places I've been to and they had a lot of different options that I have not had before so I will be back to try something else on the desserts and try a different entree besides drunken noodle.So glad to have a local Thai place to frequent!

Anyway, later on I discovered a piece of plastic in my drunken noodles! We told this to the lady in charge and she insisted that is was not plastic and it was shrimp skin! We were fairly certain it was plastic, but in any case finding shrimp skin in chicken drunken noodles is not acceptable anyway. Not wanting to argue, we just paid the check and left.

It was like being back in primary school with cute little trays. That said, the amount of the meal was miniscule and basically MADE for a toddler. I understand that it was a lunch portion, but really? The food itself was subpar and definitely not worth the $8.95. Especially considering I was charged an extra $2 because I wanted beef alongside my meal- which ended up being chewy and nearly inedible. The highlight was the salad, since the peanut sauce was actually good. (The sweet chili sauce was liquidy and almost soupy. I couldn't even stomach it and ended up making my OWN chili sauce. //face palm) The mini veggie egg rolls were decent. I finished this lunch in its entirety.Although this joint is less than half a mile from my apartment, I'll definitely pass.

The decorations are absolutely stunning, \u00a0so are the chandeliers and elephant mural...but the fact that I'm starting with the amazing decorations having not mentioned the food here speaks volumes, at least to me.

However, the food was just BLAND. I'm going to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but there was not one memorable thing about anything I ate, except for the veggie appetizer (they switch things up. Don't expect a bread bowl) because I ate a big piece of ginger thinking it was a raw slice of potato...not fun, but funny. ANYWAY, the Pad Thai noodles were cooked to perfection and everything had a hint of peanut, but it wasn't very well seasoned and not spicy at all.I like my Thai food with a little zing, and was unplesantly surprised to find out I would of had to request it spicy from the waitress while ordering.

I then ordered chili salmon. \u00a0The salmon itself was good, but there was so much chili sauce that it was more of a plate of soup, with lots of green beans and some salmon buried inside. The sauce was just too much - I didn't eat much. \u00a0Another in my party ordered pad thai and was pleased with that.I don't know what has changed here. \u00a0Maybe the the price of ingredients has caused them to skimp on quality ingredients? \u00a0I'll probably give it one more try before quitting.Here is my previous 4 star review:I've gotten take-out once so far and was very pleased. \u00a0I agree with other posts that promptness is not their virtue. \u00a0My take out order took another 10 minutes beyond their 20 minutes. I can live with that because the food was tasty and had good size portions. \u00a0Drunken noodles are delightful and the perfect amount of spiciness. \u00a0Vegetable curry puffs were tasty. \u00a0And a beef dish (forgetting name) of minced beef with lime, chili, cilantro was great. \u00a0I will definitely make this a mainstay for take out and look forward to sitting down and enjoying a meal inhouse."], ["Staci R.", "Came here for lunch and it was absolutely yummy!

My girlfriend and I often come here to do business at the credit union, then follow up with a delicious lunch. Their lunch special can't be beat. For $7.95 you get two spring rolls, soup (the Tom Yum is my favorite!) and an entree of your choice from a large selection. For those of you who like a choice, they also offer an upgrade to brown rice for extra. I try to get something different each time I go, but my favorites are basil shrimp or ginger chicken. I've rarely been let down, though I did go with the coconut shrimp once and I won't make that mistake again. The service is fast and though the staff isn't particularly warm or talkative, I've never been treated poorly either. Coming at noon on the dot can be a little crazy though.

We walked in and continued to stand at the door, waiting for someone to seat us, for about 5 minutes. An elderly woman with a walker and what looked like her daughter walked in after us. Finally, the hostess came to help us and told us, \"They go first,\" and seated the elderly woman and her daughter. We were a little puzzled since we had walked in before them, but maybe they had put their name in ahead of time or something. A little more explanation would have been nice. We were seated and put in our orders. Our soups came out pretty quickly. I ordered the Thai Chicken Noodle Soup and my boyfriend ordered the Tom Kha Gai. Both were decent. While waiting for our meals, we kept hearing a creaking sound and couldn't figure out what it was. Finally we realized that it was the large picture above us - it seemed like everytime a door opened to the kitchen, the picture would move and creak. Kind of creeped us out a little. Our meals were brought out - Pad See Yu for me and Pad Thai for him. We were both a little surprised, as the portions were a little on the small size. But for $8.95, that's what you get. My boyfriend ate all of his noodles but felt that his chicken seemed a little processed. My meal was yummy and I won the clean plate award this time. While we were waiting for our check, some commotion happened at another table closeby. A group of older people had received their food, and apparently they had ordered something else that was taking a bit longer to come out. The waiter told them that it would be out soon and the crotchety old man said, \"Tell him to keep it\". The waiter went away and came back 5 minutes later with some type of fish dish that had such a nice presentation - he brought it to the table steaming hot and the shouting began - the man said, \"Take it back, I don't want it,\" and his loudmouth wife has to chime in and yell, \"He can't eat it, he can't eat it\". The waiter even offered to give it to them for half price, but they refused it. Now...I know that it's poor service to have part of your meal come out later than the rest of it, but if you could see the work that was put into putting that meal together, most people would have still taken it. My boyfriend and I almost told the waiter that WE would take the fish for half price! I was sure to shoot the wife a dirty look on our way out.As for going back to Thai Palace - we would probably go back if we wanted thai but didn't want to drive far to get it.

The Gai Pad Prik King is really good if spicy chicken and string beans are your thing. The Thai Rice Noodle dish is also fantastic, plentiful with chicken and shrimp. It's hard for me to find anything negative with the food, but the only think I can think of is the side of fried rice that you can choose with your order. It's good, but it just has certain taste that gets to me. The inside is pleasant with some Thai art work on the walls and a big aquarium where you wait to be seated.

You really know how to satisfy your customers!"], ["Jesse N.", "Went here the other night, and it was probably one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had, if not the most disappointing Thai meal. There have been very few times in my life that I haven't finished a restaurant meal, and this is one of them. My gf and I barely made a dent in our food, and it came down to little details.Basil Fried Rice - this dish was completely devoid of any basil flavor, and the fried rice itself did not have that \"wok taste\" that you can only get when making fried rice on a restaurant-grade pilot-light stove. It also had string beans and corn, which is beyond me. Basil fried rice is suppose to be full of strong, potent, SPICY flavors and this had none of them.Pad Thai - this was one of the worst pad thais I've ever had. The red hue of the pad thai leads me to believe that they used ketchup as a sweetener, as opposed to sugar. This is something that some street vendors do in Thailand when making pad thai, since sugar is more expensive. It's beyond me as so why they would apply this technique here. This dish was completely one-note, and the shrimp was also overcooked.Massaman Curry - this dish was the least disappointing, but it was still so weird. There were bamboo slices in it (which I've never seen in a massaman curry in my life) and the potatoes used were red potatoes, skin on. The curry itself tasted like massaman, but again, one-note, weak seasoning and the addition of the bamboo/red potatoes was just weird. They didn't taste right and the potatoes didn't really seem to have absorbed any of the curry flavor, like they were tossed in as a finishing ingredient.Basil Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Massaman Curry are my holy trinity of how I judge a Thai restaurant. I am Thai and my family has 30+ years in the restaurant business. On the level of both authenticity and quality, this was just poor food. I have a huge amount of leftovers that I don't even want to touch, which says a lot, because I hate wasting food.I will say that the Thai pupu platter was pretty good, and it did set my expectations high for the entrees, which made this extra disappointing. Top it off with a restaurant bill of $80 with tip, and I'm at a bit of a loss. 1 appetizer + 3 entrees and an iced tea at that final price just seems insane. I've been to the best Thai places in LA and NYC, and I've never even come close to that price for what I ordered.I'll also add that the service was fine, no issues there.I had really high expectations when seeing the 4 start yelp reviews, but I'm getting the feeling that most of the reviews were for the American style brunch. Either way, I won't be coming back. I still can't believe how bad/disappointing that meal was."], ["Jess L.", "I came here for dinner with a friend on a Wednesday night. I was immediate charmed by the old diner feel with Asian flare. Very unique and fun. There were only three or four other parties there at the time. Our waiter and waitress were witty, funny, not encroaching - added to the full experience.Coconut shrimp and tofu skewers were good, didn't blow my socks off but did the trick. My main dish, Raam, had a decadent and delicious peanut sauce and ample veggies. There was definitely enough to make this two meals worth. My friend got the red curry, which was also solid.Solid beer selection too! Includes Sierra Nevada, Naughty Nurse, Singha, and Stella.Really great experience overall. I cannot wait to come back!"], ["Thien N.", "Specializing in Laotian food, I've never had the opportunity to try any of their fusions. So full disclosure: It's been strictly breakfast and brunch for this guy!All breakfasts are served with savory home fries with a touch of sweet potatoes and are accompanied by your choice of bread and eggs. Their 3-egg omelettes are decent. I go for the \"build your own omelet\" ($5) Additional toppings are .50 cents and it's usually a good portion. I haven't sampled their breakfast sandwiches, but they are generally less than $5. Try the whole hog burrito; with ham, american and laos sausage, and bacon - it's a meat-lovers dream. The steak and veggie burritos are pretty good too. My personal favorites though are their skillets, especially the Idaho and East West Skillet! Just the right balance of crispy, salty, and flavors -- these platters are a great start to any morning. They also make home-made pancakes, waffles and french toast too.Though the breakfasts are tasty and very affordable, there isn't anything particularly South-East Asian about them. In fact, it's more of a traditional American breakfast. But what's so bad about a well-made breakfast right?! Parking lot is small so plan accordingly to avoid the line or getting jammed-up!

Everything tasted great, from the hot tea to the Satay we started with as an appetizer. Both the Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) lunch specials were great. The soup and salad that came with the lunch specials were delicious too. The only negative thing I have to say is that some of the pieces of chicken seemed to have a tough strange texture, like maybe they were frozen or something? Not sure, but I will definitely be back to try it out again, the flavors of everything were amazing, there was just a strange texture in a couple of bites, but I'll definitely go try it again and perhaps try a protein in the dishes other than the chicken."], ["Jared K.", "East-West Grille is a gem of a discovery we made en route to NYC from Boston.

The lime cilantro \u00a0was a great complement to the tender pieces of beef. \u00a0The Yarng Kai Noi (Laotian Cornish hen) was a great call.

East West features dishes from Laotian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines. They have an extensive menu that is sure to please anyone. I usually stick to the Laotian or Thai options. I've had a variety of curries, Thai Basil, Pad Sriracha, and Larb Gai; everything has been excellent. All dishes are made with fresh ingredients and are impeccably spiced. \u00a0The cooks are happy to adjust the levelof spice to your palate. The servers are attentive and the food typically comes out quickly. They have great lunch specials that will keep you full till the next morning. Here's the game changer- they serve breakfast on the weekends! \u00a0They have the typical eggs, omelettes, and pancakes, plus Asian style breakfast.

This place is adorable.Found this place passing through Hartford. We had been traveling all day and were starving - and to our delight/surprise, the food was prepared and brought to the table in under 10 minutes.I can't say it's the best Thai food I've had, but it is tasty. Got the pineapple fried rice which was good, but made with frozen veggies which were not up to par with the other ingredients in the dish. Pad thai was pretty solid. Generally good food, fast and friendly service. Would recommend if you're in the area."], ["Phil A.", "Absolutely delicious food for lunch. We had the lunch tray, and the beef salad.

If you like drunken noodles and want to try something new but still have something similar, pad sriracha won't disappoint you. Pumpkin curry is my another fav - def try purple sticky rice if you're into trying new things. It comes in a little tiny adorable rice container. My favorite appetizer is chicken curry puffs. They come with peanut sauce. So delish. They also serve amazing breakfast, both American and Lao/Thai. I had rice porridge, was pretty good. The staff are very attentive and usually there isn't any wait unless on weekend nights. Love the atmosphere too! Cheaper option than Blue Elephant Trail, for sure and I have not been disappointed every time I come here."], ["Katie H.", "What a trip. Imagine a funky Thai place serving traditional Thai and Cambodian dishes housed in an old 1950s diner and you have this place. We couldn't get over the culture clash, but it's an instant conversation starter, and the place has its own quirky charm. The food was pretty good--not standout Thai food in an area with a lot of Thai restaurants, but still a good meal. I had the larb gai, which was refreshing and very light. I don't think I would order it again, but it's more to do with the fact that I've never had larb before and I don't think it's my cup of tea. My boyfriend ordered the yarng kai noi, which was a barbecued cornish hen. It was tasty, but could have used more time marinating since the flavors were a bit subdued. We were also hoping for \u00a0a bigger portion size. There were two pieces of chicken on the plate, and my boyfriend has a big appetite, so unfortunately, he was still hungry. The highlight I would say is the sticky rice that came \u00a0with both dishes. I absolutely love sticky rice, and it was steamed perfectly with the perfect amount of chew to it, coming out in the cutest bamboo containers. My boyfriend's mom had the pad thai, vegetarian style. It was actually my favorite dish. It's one of the sweeter pad thais I have, but it was certainly flavorful, and I would order it if I came here again. For an appetizer, we had the Vietnamese fresh rolls. Not the best I've had and not worth the money. If you're in the area, you'll definitely get a good meal here. It's honest, well-prepared, authentic Thai food served up in a really unique setting. I'm hoping to come back sometime to try the breakfast!"], ["Rob M.", "A very interesting place. An old Fifties-era diner car converted into an Asian Fusion restaurant. What's not to love?I arrived for lunch. A full parking lot, but not nearly a full dining room. The service was prompt and attentive. Kudos for that. The menu is extensive, to say the least. Lao, Thai, Cambodia, Vietnam...if you like East Asian food, this is the place. I had to brush off the server a couple of times just because the menu offered so many choices. I eventually ordered a small beef soup app, only to kick myself because I wanted to try the calamari. Soooo many choices!The beef soup was awesome. It was essentially Pho Tai without the vermicelli. The broth was light and flavorful, not fatty. The flank steak was perfect. Just nothing bad to say. Loved every spoonful.I finally decided upon a Pra Prik seafood dish, as I was informed they could not prepare the Pra Prik bass -- they only had tilapia (from Walmart, or BJ's down the street, I assumed). The Pra Prik seafood was delicious. With some caveats. First of all, they threw in some interesting ingredients. Obviously canned smoked oysters. Totally threw off the flavors of the rest of the dish. Then there was the fake pink \"crabmeat.\" C'mon. You only have to throw in a few chunks, how hard is it to buy real crab instead of that pollack mash-up? But there were nice calamari rings, scallops, and plenty of fresh locally-sourced veggies (at least, according to the table cards touting farm-to-table ingredients). Be aware: my Pra Prik was listed as THREE hot chili peppers. The hottest on their menu. I barely broke a sweat. It was a bit warm, but nowhere near three-star territory. If you like true Thai-style food (or Laotian) make sure you ask them to kick it up a notch. Overall, a true gem, and I will be back. There are so many great dishes on the menu...I can't believe it took so long to \"discover\" this place after driving by it so many times. Yay. I'm a fan."], ["Gladys M.", "Service is fast although they don't check up on you too often while you eat. The food is super amazing.

I've been trying to get into Thai food lately, though I think I lean more towards Malaysian as my preference. It seems like Thai food is always just a bunch of ingredients mashed together and served on a plate with rice. It's so one note, always coconut, always cloyingly sweet, often reminiscent of Chinese food but not in a comfortably familiar way. The cooks here are not making anything out of the ordinary here. It's typical Thai. The rice they serve is not sticky rice, it's just plain old jasmine rice. The curries are all classical, some sour and sweet flavors mixed together. They were all too sweet for my tastes. The bubble tea was kind of gross and the pearls were dry. The coconut soup was watery and the chunks of chicken were kind of scary looking. The fried spicy pork dumplings were really awesome though. And even though the satay's peanut sauce was more vinegary than I'm used to, the chicken smelled deliciously smokey."], ["Sarah O.", "I went here for dinner on a Saturday night with two other people.

Soon a family of three joined us a few tables away.The decor was nice. Chairs were comfortable but overall I didn't get a \"wow\" factor.Our orders were taken promptly. We ordered Spicy Hot Basil Noodle with Chicken and Peanut Stir Fry with Beef. The food came out fast. It smelled great but after my first bite I was not impressed. The portions are skimpy. Presentation was great but it didn't justify the outrageous price tag. If a restaurant is going to charge $16 for a noodle dish I expect a decent portion. The stir fry was $17.I am familiar with Thai food. I've had Thai food in the States as well as in Thailand. What Hot Basil was serving me tasted like food prepared by a novice or an unskilled chef. Our noodles were soggy and too wet. It had a kick but was also too sweet. It reminded me of when I prepare a dish and used too many chilli peppers and in an attempt to savage the meal I throw in tons of sugar and spices.The peanut stir fry was in no way authentic. I have difficulty finding words to describe the dish. It tasted like a fusion between a Chinese stir fry using Thai spices. I would never order their peanut stir fry ever again. Like the noodles, portions were small and the chef added crispy noodles on top which ruined the dish for us, mainly because it was out of place.We didn't care to even try the dessert and I'm usually a fan of coconut ice cream. If you want real Thai food avoid Hot Basil. Dishes are not authentic and portions are small. Drive 2 mins down the road and you can get real Thai food.

I love Thai food, and this place does a decent job of it. Setting/Atmosphere: It's a little odd. Based on the neighborhood and the slightly rundown appearance of the building's exterior you might not expect the inside to be as well maintained and chic as it is. Since I'm going to mention Suhkothai in Manchester as having better food, I'll mention there that Hot Basil is a little classier overall and has a nicer appearance on the inside in general. Food: The food here was good. Flavor-wise I like Sukhothai in Manchester a little better, but this place has one nice special perks too (See \"Drinks\"). The presentation of the rice on my plate looked kind of stupid in it's upside down funnel shaped glory. I also didn't like how they cut up all the veggies, etc. in such small pieces, which to me detracts from the perception of being fresh and a little fancy. Drinks: They don't have a liquor license, so you won't be getting anything alcoholic from the menu. They do, however, allow you to bring in outside beer, wine, etc. for a nominal \"corking\" fee.

I think they might have also watered the coconut juice down. Now you're probably wondering why I rated them 4 stars.... This place makes an AMAZING green curry. I got it with chicken and it was delicious. My husband got the summer noodle which tasted very similar to a Vietnamese dish we like and was pretty good.

The lighting is dim and it seems like a very random place, but don't be fooled, they serve excellent Thai cuisine with a fabulous staff. You'll be warmly invited in with prompt service and soothing, soft music in the background. The lunch specials are a great value. You choose an entree and it comes with soup or a salad. There are many options ranging from curry to pad Thai, noodles and much more. There are many vegetarian options, with or without tofu, so that's a big plus. I highly recommend the Pangang Curry, especially if you enjoy something spicy. Their specials change from time to time, but they're worth a try for a slightly different spin on what you may be used to. The garlic saut\u00e9ed edamame was excellent. This seemingly simple appetizer was bursting with flavor and was easily enough for three people. The veggie spring rolls were very good too, crispy on the outside with fresh vegetables on the inside. Service here is very polite and attentive as well. They're willing to accommodate.

Made with regular broccoli and on the sweeter side. But still pretty solid. 3. Pineapple fried rice: delish! Comes fully loaded; chicken and shrimp --- a meal all its own! 4. Green chicken curry: a little underwhelming, but not bad. The curry sauce was missing a punch I was looking for. 5. Fresh spring rolls: again, a little underwhelming; the peanut sauce that accompanies it is veryyyy strong. Had to mix it up with some spices so it didn't taste too peanutty.
