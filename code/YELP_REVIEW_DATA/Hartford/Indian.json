Great service and fabulous food.they serve lunch buffet \u00a0however dinner is A la carte. The food is very well made at this place. I have tried many dishes there. it is amazing how well they can do sea food, especially shrimp, which I think is a rarity amongst Indian restaurants. the taste and texture of the food are excellent - never dry, but juicy and flavorful. the spice is just right not overpowering and you can taste the natural flavor of the main ingredient. My favorite is the shrimp Byriani. The interplay of saffron and shrimp is just wonderful. I grew up in HK and I know how top notch seafood should be prepared. the chef at this place does a great job with this shrimp dish. The other great dish is the Gobi \u00a0Manchuria (deep fried cauliflower in a spicy sweet and sour sauce modeled after a Cantonese dish made from pork). I also like very much the dosa - light and tasty. the tangy fermented dough made into a very thin crust with mild filling hits the spot every time.Lunch time buffet is also excellent with a great variety of well prepared dishes at a very competitive price.the service is also great, the staff and owner are very friendly. the place is also sparklingly clean and the atmosphere is very pleasant."], ["Kb R.", "Come here!!

I have known the owner for years since his days in Vernon, CT and his penchant for quality is unparallelled in my experience. I find the food to be unusually good, the chutneys are exceptional especially the onion chutney. Perhaps it's just me but the naan at Indigo is one of the very best; I believe it is because it is thinner than most and develops a nice char flavor in the tandoor. There are many dishes served at Indigo Bistro that don't seem to be on other menu's elsewhere which makes this stop always a pleasant surprise."], ["Biota H.", "It's been awhile since I've been back to this place, and sadly, they've done away with my favorite--the dinner buffet. But they still offer a lunch buffet for $9.99 on weekdays and $12.99 on weekends.I stopped in this plaza for takeout and groceries. Deciding it'd be most efficient to place my order before I picked up the couple things next door at ShopRite, I went in and ordered aloo gobi (comes with basmati rice) for $12.49 and chappati for $2.99. I was amazed when they told me it would be 10-12 minutes.I ended up coming back after about 25 minutes, and indeed my food was ready. Based on the receipt that they had already printed, it looked like they had actually gotten my takeout ready in 10 minutes. Very impressive.This was my first time ordering off the menu and not just eating at the buffet, but their food doesn't disappoint. I've been a vegetarian for awhile and recently have started transitioning into vegan, so I really appreciate that they mark entrees containing dairy. For those with a gluten intolerance, they also mark gluten-free options.I'm a huge fan of spicy food and asked them to make the aloo gobi between medium and spicy. I felt like that level of spiciness was actually between mild and medium, so next time I'll just ask for them to make it spicy.I also appreciated that the chappati was put in a paper bag with an aluminum lining to preserve the warmth.Good portion sizes (see picture with my computer mouse in it for size reference).Random Sidenote: The one huge pet peeve I have with this restaurant is their website probably belongs on this list: topdesignmag.com/20-exam\u2026. All of the info that you need is there, but having to look through the site is a little like shopping at Walmart.

The reviews were fairly good, my brother recommended it and the place itself looked pretty classy. I ordered the Vegetable Vindaloo and it really wasn't very good. I don't know how else to put it. The spice was fine, but the vegetables had next to no flavor. The dish wasn't worth 13 bucks. It was very liquidy too. You can get a vindaloo meal that's much fresher, half the price and infinitely better at Tikkaway. The bread and dipping sauces were OK at best.The service was okay. There also seems to be some discrepancies on the hours of operation, plus the buffet or lack thereof. I have a feeling this changes depending on the day and week. (Some reviews state buffet only, but both times we came here for dinner there was no buffet in sight) *Note: The hours on Yelp now appear to be more accurate and specific about lunch vs. dinner*Since the menu clearly labels what's vegetarian and what has dairy, I'll give them 3-stars.

However, I have a staple dish, Chicken Tikka Masala, that must be good for me to return to an Indian restaurant. Now, IndiGO is a buffet and it has a decent variety of items, from goat, to chicken, to vegetarian, and vegan options. They post on their website and on Facebook some of the main dishes they will be having that day at the buffet. Sadly, Chicken Tikka Masala is only available on Friday nights (at least from my observations of following them). So the first time I went there it was some random weekday for lunch and there was no Chicken Tikka Masala. There is no doubt that the food is fresh and the dishes were all pretty good. However, I made a point to come on a Friday night the next time and the Chicken Tikka Masala was not great. The chicken appeared to have been cooked in a way that had some blackened charring on it and the sauce was too tomato-y and not very creamy or spicy. Although the food was good that I tried, and it is very authentic, I think it would be hard for me to keep track of the new dishes I tried and liked and make sure I get it again at the next buffet. Therefore, I think you have to be fairly adventurous or have an excellent memory + follow what they make. Sadly, as much as I like to try other dishes, I must also have my Tikka Masala! and IndiGo just doesn't satisfy that craving. Another favorite of mine is the green chutney and Indigo's version of it was not as flavorful as I've had it or as spicy.The waitstaff was courteous and attentive though.

I took my cousin there on Tuesday for a late dinner. Since it was my cousin's first time having East Asian food we picked items from the Indian side of the menu. I usually prefer their Persian dishes but their Indian selection never fails to disappoint. I recommend the tandoori mixed grill because that comes with a variety of items for you to try. You are guaranteed to find something you will enjoy. The dish is served in a hot heavy dish so the food arrives to your table steaming like a parade of flavors that exhibit interesting aromas. Apparently we were supposed to get two pieces of shrimp but the chef must have been distracted because we got way more, I'm not complaining in fact it made my evening. You can't go wrong with the mixed tandoori. You can't have a proper Indian dinner without adding Masala. We went with the Chicken Tikka Masala because my cousin was afraid of lamb. I asked for the dish to be prepared \"Asian spicy\" and that was a great choice. My lips burned but a sip of ice cold water comforted me with each spoonful of rice. I thought the dish was prepared well, I'm appreciated the fact that the dish wasn't polluted with too much spices. \u00a0Some restaurants make their chicken masala so thick and overwhelming that I smell extra herbious the following day at work. \u00a0I enjoy good food but prefer to keep it to myself, I can't stand it when I stink the following day after consuming dishes that are prepared with too many spices. To wrap up the evening the waiter offered us Gulab Jabun. \u00a0I would have given the place a good rating anyways but the Gulab Jabun makes me confident about bringing others to Bombay Olive. \u00a0One minor complaint was that I had to flag down the wait staff for some more rice.

Of course the building still sort of looks like an IHOP, with the steep roof and distinctive shaped front, but the pancakes are long gone. Bombay Olive is a Indian and Persian restaurant, with a few Nepalese things throw in. Quite an interesting menu with lots of things I've never seen in a regular Indian restaurants. I've been here many times and I'm still exploring the menu. I haven't gotten around to the Persian food yet, but the rest is sure good. All the veggie dishes I've tried such as mushroom shabnam, navratana kroma, malai kofta, palak paneer and aalu chutney were superb, with each flavor standing out and obvious. The masala are known as royal dishes and the chicken tikka masala is fantastic with just the right amount of creamy sauce. I often judge Indian restaurants by their breads and the naan here is great, without any of the toughness found in other naan. One naan in particular, called peshawari naan is filled with nuts and delicious. The Poori is extremely fluffy and light, almost seems like it will float away and is a joy to eat. Between the hours of 11:30 and 3:00 Bombay Olive offers a lunch boofay. I love boofay's, especially Indian boofays and this one is great. Of course you don't get the personalized service and the wide variety of dishes you get during the regular hours but you sure get a whole lot of good Indian food. Bombay Olive isn't the place to go if you are looking for fancy ambiance and snooty decorations. After all it's still looks like a IHOP.

They delivered in 30 minutes.Order:Puri (1 order, 2 pieces) Nepali chicken lollipops (1order, 6 pieces)Lamb vindaloo, extra spicy (comes with basmati rice)Papad (i didn't order it... I don't know if they messed up and threw it in by accident, or if it comes with every order. It says its $2 on the menu, but i wasn't charged.)Disclaimer: I am Oriya. You should understand that my opinions and preferences may not necessarily reflect an average American's taste or expectations of indian food.Puri: Ehh, a bit heavy. But that tends to happen when they sit for a few minutes. They wrapped it in wax paper and aluminum foil to keep it warm and hey seemed to have steamed themselves in the packaging. Puri needs to be eaten within 2-3 minutes of coming out of the fryer, when it is still fluffy and inflated, in order to be enjoyed plain. Pretty good for grabbing the vindaloo though. 100% authentic, and better than some puri I've had in India. Bigger too.Nepali Chicken Lollipops: The lollipop preparation was beautiful to look at, but its kind of gimmicky and i personally could care less about presentation. Lollipops tend to push the cartilage and tendons down into the muscle; which is fine if you're hindu, cuz you'll eat that shit, but it might be annoying if you don't like those parts. With that being said, I fucking love these things. They looked like tandoori chicken, and i suspect they were cooked in the tandoori oven, but they had a very unique flavor. They're bright red and look spicy as hell, but they're really not; not at all. I will definitely order these again, and i suggest you do too. They're perfect for people eating indian food for the first time. Lamb Vindaloo: When i ordered this, the guy on the phone asked me how spicy i wanted it. I Lol'd and told him (in hindi) that i wanted it Desi spicy. This dish should never be served anything other than extra spicy. The flavors won't jive right. Plus, the spiciness serves a very real purpose historically. This dish was created extra spicy to cause the person eating it to sweat. The sweat then cools the person and causes their core body temperature to decrease. Believe it or not, hot foods will cool you down on a hot summer day. So as for the flavor itself, there was a bit too much vinegar. It reminded me of achara. The (boneless) lamb was good, but there weren't enough potatoes. It was also very oily... i am used to it, because this is the way you get it in India, but i was not expecting it. Its probably just the lamb fat that was rendered in the gravy, but still. I dont think most americans would like it that greasy. I think it would have been better with bone-in mutton and twice as much potato. Basmati rice: Amazing 10/10. I wish i could have rice like this every day. Very fluffy, very light, and a slight hint of butter, although im pretty sure they didn't add any. This was the best white rice i have ever had at any restaurant on this side of the world. Period.Papad: i didnt realize this was even in the bag until i was about to throw it away. It stayed crispy for at least 4 hours and was great with the onion chutney. Im pretty sure this is the same brand my dad buys at the indian store. It was a nice bonus. Reminded me of the stuff i used to have when i was little. Also, it was free. In short, order the nepali chicken lollipops and make sure you get basmati rice with whatever you order. The lollipops, rice, and free papad bumped this place from a 3star to a 4.

Around 3:45 they started asking us (twice) if we planned to get anything else from the buffet, particularly the salad and dessert area of it. Felt rushed. They should at least wait until 4 to do this.Aside from that, I like the cool little metal cups and all the vegetarian options. They told me the goat is halal, so I had some and it was good. There was unfortunately no plain rice option on the buffet. Our waiter did ask us if we wanted some, to which we responsed yes, but he forgot to bring it.Everything does seem seasoned with the same seasoning mixture and to the same degree. I hoped for a bit more variation.But the place seemed clean, the food good, and the gulab jamun (chickpea flour dessert balls in syrup) was served warm and seemed softer and tastier than those I've had elsewhere.

The food quality of takeout vs eating in is about the same, nothing really special about either but if you are craving some quick Indian food and live near West Hartford it's in a convenient location. Now for the bad.... The last 3 or 4 times I've ordered from Bombay Olive I've felt like they were blatantly trying to rip me off... I call and order delivery from this place about twice a month - Their website states that they have a $20 delivery minimum - About 2 months ago I called to place an order (my regular comes to about $21 after tax) I was quickly told that minimum for delivery was $25 and they have never delivered for under that.... Keep in mind that I've ordered from this place 2-4 times a month for nearly a year prior to this order. I argued a bit with the attendant on the phone and decided to order from somewhere else that night.On another occasion I was told the same thing, that the minimum was $25 and that they wouldn't deliver for anything less, Craving Indian food I agreed to order the Naan basket - I told the person on the phone that I was going to pay with my card and that I wanted to use a coupon, he said ok - The person took my information and I reminded him about the coupon, His response was \"No coupon, I already charged the card\"................................................... When my food came (rather slow ~45 mins that night) I signed the receipt without giving a tip and handed it back to the driver, He immediately took it and questioned me \"No Tip?!\" I responded that not only is the delivery supposed to be free but the other man who took my information refused my coupon and overcharged me.
