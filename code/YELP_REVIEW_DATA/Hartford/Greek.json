I've been coming here for four years now and have actually never, ever been disappointed. They're really making a name for themselves too- the New York Times recently blessed them with a raving review...a nice nod for a neighborhood eatery. The most charming and redeeming quality about Trin Rest is the fact that it's family run and owned. They'll always make you feel welcome and at home.Trinity Restaurant is also a small establishment. It can't hold more than 100 people at a time and if you come on the weekend without a reservation, you gotta be willing to wait. Once you are seated, however, prepare to be wowed.

But sadly, it has never impressed me. In fact, it's the reason I'm knocking off a star. It seriously is the ONLY lackluster item on the menu. It's chewy and bland...kind of tastes like it's been frozen. So unfortunate, but you guys know how I feel about my calamari.All in all, however, Trinity Restaurant is a super solid, scrumptious, satisfying place to take your friends, family, or bae. A double thumbs up!"], ["Tim M.", "This was one of the strangest restaurants that I have been to in Hartford. Although there was technically free parking across the street, the parking spaces were tiny meaning your car was halfway into the road (didn't seem safe but car was fine). \u00a0I drove by the restaurant twice (it was easy to miss) and the surrounding neighborhood wasn't great. Inside, it was filled with Trinity college students enjoying the BYOB (even though they had a wine menu). The college students were going all out- beer, wine, hard liquor, mixers,etc. At least the corkage fee was cheap ($3)Even though it claims to be Italian, Greek and Mediterranean, the menu was 100% Italian. which was dissapointing. The calamari were just OK, nothing special. The bread was very good. I have to admit that the butternut squash ravioli was REALLY good, however I never seen SO MUCH brown butter sauce on a dish. \u00a0I didn't end up ordering much else since I had expected a much more diverse menu."], ["Kelly T.", "Great food, horrible service. \u00a0Waitress seemed scattered, kept forgetting us. \u00a0Waited on people who came in a good 5 minutes after us before acknowledging us (a party of 6 is kind of hard to miss). \u00a0Not sure we would go back."], ["Mari K.", "I had found this place in my search for local BYOBs and decided to give it a try. It's located right next to Trinity, but we had a little trouble finding it as there's no sign that I could see with the name of the restaurant. There is some street parking right out front. As we approached the establishment we were greeting by a friendly man, and we were seated quickly once inside. \u00a0We visited on a Monday night and it was very quiet; I think there was only one other group there during the entire duration of our meal. However, the space is pretty nice (I added a few pictures of the interior), and has room for a good number of people to sit \u00a0comfortably. The server, who I believe may have been one of the owners, was really sweet. It seemed she was the only one there so it wasn't super fast service, but we were not in a hurry and the family feel was nice. \u00a0If there had been more patrons, they definitely would have needed more help to keep things moving quickly enough, and I'm assuming they bring in more help during busier times of the year. We had brought our own wine since Trinity Restaurant's Facebook and Yelp pages say that they are a BYOB, but I noticed they did have a pretty good wine list. I asked the waitress, and she said they do both (my favorite answer). She brought us two wine glasses. I order the arugula and spinach salad (it had another name that's escaping me). It had a huge piling of fresh greens with a very tasty dressing and four thin slices of cheese (see picture). I always enjoy fresh greens, especially the slightly spicy kick of arugula, so I was pleased. We did have a smidge of bad luck with entrees, initially ordering 2 that were not available at the time (the scallops dish, which looked great in the picture on the wall, and the osso buco, which sounded amazing). She clearly felt bad and apologized for not having them, and explained that the osso buco is always available in the fall, but in the off-season (I'm assuming it's off-season because college is out, and Trinity students and families likely make up a good portion of their clientele), they can't make huge batches of it, as it takes a long time to make, and they would end up with large quantities being wasted. She said that regulars will call ahead of time to order the osso buco, which I thought was a great tip. I totally understand the reasoning and agree that this should be more of a seasonal item (but I do think it would be helpful for them to indicate this on the menu).I ended up ordering the garlic shrimp linguine (it may have been called something slightly different) and my date ordered the seafood paella. The paella was fantastic (it does come with a lot of peas, just fyi); the seafood was cooked just right and the broth was really good. The shrimp linguine was good as well. My favorite part of the whole experience, though, was unexpected. We had already paid and were ready to leave when the waitress brought out a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for us to share, on the house. \u00a0We had told her it was our first visit, and I think she wanted to make a good first impression. It worked! I would not have ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (I was really full from all of the salad and pasta!), but I am so glad I had the chance to try it. It was fantastic! The custard was rich and creamy, the perfect texture and sweetness with a hint of vanilla. The top was torched just right- it shattered like thin glass under the spoon and had a delicious, sweet caramelized taste. After thinking about it, it makes sense that a place called Trinity Restaurant, situated next to Trinity College, would have a great Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e... since it's rumored that the first creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e originated at a Trinity College in Cambridge, England!No matter the reason, the food and overall experience were good, but I would go back there just for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e."], ["Rabbi L.", "OMG, I love this place so much.

Additionally, when we challenged the amount due, we were met with adamant opposition, even following adding up the value of every item and presenting a corrected bill.

The fairly stark interior of Aladdin doesn't hint that this will be anything more than another place to grab late night food for the college crowd. Aladdin is actually really decent. I've been there mainly before 10 p.m. to avoid being around annoying drunks. Each time, the food has been reliable and good. The pizza is not overloaded with sauce or cheese, and a slice is reasonably priced for its size. The falafel is not as good as that from Tangiers, but the price is right and it is decent. I think a main difference here is that Aladdin uses less tahini than Tangiers. The falafel isn't dry...just less tangy. The service has always been fast and friendly."], ["Tony C.", "I come here on my lunch break every now and then. Its not the best pizza, but its not bad either.

My boyfriend ordered a pizza first and the others all ordered Shawarma (they raved about it) I got the veg combo - very good. but the pizza came out after we were all basically done and was burnt on one side pretty badly.

Aladdin definitely filled my quota for great Halal food, with a few gripes.I had a Chicken Shawarma pita and a side salad. The salad wasn't anything special, as expected and advertised, consisting of romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, olives and a \"house\" dressing. The salad dressing was advertised as a homemade Greek vinaigrette, however I would be willing to bet my next pay check that it was Kraft Zesty Italian dressing - a little disappointing for sure.The chicken Shawarma pita came next, and was absolutely spectacular. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and well cooked, and the wrap itself had the perfect amount of lettuce, red onion, tomato, garlic and tahini sauces. It was almost perfect, but I will admit that I was expecting it to be a little bigger; I guess I didn't read into the $4.99 price tag enough.Which leads me to my final minor complaint, which is that I wish they had a more flexible menu. It is very extensive, more extensive than most Halal restaurants I've visited, however the configurations are not that accommodating for solo or pair diner(s). For example, I asked if I could order a \"side\" of hummus, instead of the $4.99 appetizer portion (too much for one person staying in a hotel with no way to store leftovers) - they said they didn't offer a \"side\" size, that was the only way to get it. After my meal, since I was still a little hungry, I asked if I could order a single falafel, they said no, I could only buy the appetizer portion of 4. You get the point. In my experience, these are entirely reasonable requests, especially at a place like this. I would gladly pay $2.00 for a single falafel (vs. $4.99 for four), or $7.50 for a larger pita sandwich with more meat. It's a somewhat difficult place to eat for one, you're likely to either leave a little hungry or with a big container with leftovers - not an option for the road warriors living in hotels.All in all, a very respectable Halal spot with great food, just wish they'd reconsider their menu or be more flexible with their offerings. I will most certainly be a repeat customer."], ["Shameem A.", "my go-to place for late-night delivery; they do mess up orders for me with some regularity when it comes to small details. but usually not huge deals and it still tastes awesome. love their fries, shawarma/shawarfin sandwiches. the halal pepperoni pizza is not my favorite; i'd stick with their middle eastern stuff. i LOVE the baba ganoush and hummus here. the lamb kofta is also great. the fattoush is awesome as well."], ["Adam N.", "Terrible customer service.

We sat with Tiffany's favorite waitress (unfortunately I did not catch her name, but I can see why she's a favorite!) at a table in full view of the chef and his process. We had a Groupon that entitled two people to an entree each and either a glass of wine or a glass of sangria each. You can choose any entree and any glass of wine- it was a pleasant surprise that choices weren't limited to a designated house red or white. They no longer serve their white peach sangria at this location, which is too bad because I've heard it's amazing, but we got the red instead- full of fruit, nice and strong!I got their Greek salad with my entree (minus olives), and it was delicious. So fresh, and their signature salad dressing was amazing! I'm not sure what was in it, but it packed a ton of flavor. It was served on the salad but they also supplied a bottle in case you wanted to add more (and they sell it there).For my entree, I chose the Grilled Swordfish off the specialty board. Didn't even look at the menu (I tend to like getting specials since they aren't available all the time). It was served beneath picatta sauce with broccoli and rice. However, the mashed potatoes offered with another entree sounded so good that we asked if we could trade out the rice for those mashed potatoes. The chef graciously accommodated. The swordfish was grilled to perfection and the mashed potatoes were the right choice- perfect amount of garlic!Ended up getting another glass of sangria and because it was so strong, I elected to soak up some of the alcohol in my stomach with a dessert. The Chocolate Lava Cake was served with whipped cream. We asked about ice cream and were told they don't have a freezer to accommodate ice cream- proof that everything you have here is going to be fresh! The Lava Cake was pretty good, not the best I've ever had but I never say no to chocolate.Overall, I had a wonderful experience here. The Groupon is a great deal, so if available, I encourage you to pick one up.

It wasn't what I was expecting, the description said it had beer cooked beans and fresh veggies, but it tasted like canned veggie chili, very salty, very mushy, and there was not fresh anything. I was shocked and surprised to find a meat substitute (which was not in the description), and I for a few minutes thought I had received beef chunks. The waitress was unsure what it was exactly, some kind of tofu, not a reassuring as I would have liked. \u00a0My boyfriend had the chicken Muffuletta. He has lower standards than I, and is way less picky. He had a really great looking Greek salad. However the Muffuletta was didn't have any sauce, and was a bit bland and dry for him.

I asked if it was under new management and she told me no, she was the GM and it was her family business.

She sent her coworkers over. We sat for a while for the check, and I was hopeful she would have comped something, or offered a free dessert (even just to my son) Nothing!!!!!! She was the most passive aggressive person!!! I do not understand how she can be a manager in the hospitality business with such a chip on her shoulder!!!!!!Soooo bummed!!

And the price was a couple dollars more than what I usually \u00a0pay.So I thought the next time I go to CHIPS for an omelet, I would not replace the potatoes and toast with pancakes. \u00a0SO that is what I did. \u00a0But the omelet was still small and the serving of potatoes was not generous . I tasted better omelets which are bigger and the price more reasonable at several local breakfast.So I debated between three \u00a0or four stars and decided on THREE STARS.Service is good and there are plenty of servers. \u00a0It is just the size of the omelet and the price which kept me giving it four stars.The restaurant does promote over 40 different kinds of pancakes.TRAVEL KAL"], ["Ed L.", "Server was terrible, not very friendly or knowledgeable. \u00a0Messed our order up twice. Pancakes were ok, the sausages were over cooked and dry. Would not recommend."], ["Al M.", "My wife and I had our first, and definitely not last, breakfast at Chips today. We shared their plain waffle which was very light and tasty. They offer real maple syrup as an inexpensive option which I recommend (I'm from New Hampshire so the real stuff is a must!). We also ordered their Bacon, Mushroom, Avocado, and Cheddar Cheese Omelet. It was delicious with excellent ingredients. There are multiple options for sides with the omelet and, wanting to try their pancakes, we ordered 3 blueberry pancakes (blueberry was a small additional charge). They were the highlight of a wonderful meal. Light and flavorful with lots of berries inside and a generous spoonful of fresh berries on top. Our server, Mayleen, was efficient and had a friendly sense of humor. I have no hesitation giving Chips 5 stars!"]], "Shish Kebab House of Afghanistan": [], "Villa Pizza & Deli": [], "Town Line Diner": [["David T.", "Solid effort. Came here and ate at 1230 at night. We were starving after 12 hours of flying and lay overs. \u00a0The waitress, (Violeta) was very nice and sweet. \u00a0Very eager to help us ASAP. \u00a0We ordered a Grecia Hamburger which is just feta cheese and the taco salad. The hamburger was good. Solid little burger. We ordered the big pieces of lettuce so we are gluten free. The taco salad was surprisingly good as well. Solid little effort from the diner. No dessert for us. Got a wedding this weekend."], ["Jennifer C.", "We stopped here late night after our flight. We ordered the Mediterranean taco salad and the Grecian burger. I have to say it was delicious all the way around. Not sure how and why this place got 3 stars but I felt the food was quite delicious for it being a diner. Violete was our server. She was sweet and helpful. We will definitely be back when we fly in next time."], ["Gabriel S.", "Overall the food was good up until the owner started yelling and cursing at a customer for accidentally knocking over the back to one of the booths. \u00a0The owner then proceeded to yell at the waitress for letting the customer lean on the loose booth. \u00a0The yelling and cursing made myself and my wife very uncomfortable. \u00a0I will not be coming back because of this incident."], ["Molly G.", "Havnt even eaten my food yet.... We ordered almost an hour ago.... Wish I had some food I'm starving... Never coming here again. We ordered breakfast... Eggs... That doesn't take an hour.... The waitress didn't even come to the table and attempt to apologize for the long long wait.... It wasn't even that busy. Unacceptable!"], ["Ariana M.", "After re-reading my last review, I felt that it's high time for an update. Some things from my last review still stand, like the food being hit or miss, but I will say that the wait staff has improved a lot. There's one new waitress (her name is something along the lines of Athena, I'll edit the review if I see her again) whom is very attentive and good, and if she sticks around long enough, she'll probably grow to be as cherished and worth her weight in gold as the waitress we call Mom. They also hired a new waiter (I think his name is Chris) whom was also very good about not pressuring people to order if they weren't hungry or just coming to socialize. I also found myself in the area and stopped in for a late night nosh a few months back. It was bizarre seeing the diner on a regular night, but my friends and I were delighted to have Mom as our waitress. She was as thorough and kind as ever! So, the bottom line is that this place, while it's not the be all and end all, has its charm and has decent food. If you don't want fast food and want to go somewhere close to I-91, the Town Line Diner is a great option!"], ["Tom D.", "Dropped in for lunch today. \u00a0We were in the area and very hungry, had no plans to stop at the Town Line Diner, but figured, how bad could diner food be ?Well, the food was borderline OK. \u00a0I ordered a Ruben sandwich w/ fries (my standard diner fare), my fiancee went with the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich.The pastrami in my ruben was a bit tough, chewy. \u00a0Also, they burnt the rye bread somewhat (see my pic). \u00a0Coleslaw and fries were alright. \u00a0My fiancee's Ultimate Grilled Cheese (which is ham, bacon, tomato, American & Swiss cheese) was better, but honestly, I thought it wasn't worth 10 bucks. \u00a0She did like the Chocolate milkshake she had with her meal, was very good.Service was good, didn't get the name of our waitress, but she was nice & attentive. \u00a0That's about it, can't really ever see coming back for sub-par to average tasty food that costs more than it should.An extremely weak 3 Star rating."], ["Kariann R.", "Wasn't the best of food. Ordered an omelette and it just didn't do it for me. Staff is great. Food not so much. Over priced as well. Wouldn't come back. Sorry."], ["Michelle P.", "I used to work there years ago and let me tell you I literally work there for a day and a half if you saw what goes on in the kitchen you would not believe it before the wait staff brings out their food they think its funny to sample what you're going to eat gross .....but who's knows maby it's changed since then?"], ["Sebastian B.", "On my way north on a biz trip I decided it was time to stop for breakfast. I don't eat fast food and will not eat in my car so I spotted the diner close to the highway I was on made the exit and had a nice meal. The service was terrific and the atmosphere was welcoming. The locals make you feel comfortable. If I am passing by at the right time I would definitely stop in again."], ["Alanna M.", "Great local diner. They're open 24 hours to accomodate the late night workers and also the drunken kids. But beyond that, the food is very good for diner food.I want to say the diner is family run. They have the younger kids working there sometimes, and you always see the same friendly faces. The restaurant is also kept very clean and organized at all times. Surprisingly, the reubans are amazing. I say surprisingly because you usually only get great reubans at places who are known for them, Jewish delis, or Irish restaurants. Needless to say, the reubans are a must try. The eggs are amazing, the hash is awesome, the ultimate waffles are a must! I know, i know. A belgian waffle with icecream?? Yes. Just yes. Try it. You're welcome. The pancakes are great, the steak and eggs is good, and the eggs benedict is to die for. You get eggs, bacon, sausage, your choice of toast and jelly for one price. It's everything you want and expect from a diner.It's definitely a must try if you're from the area."], ["David D.", "It's OK and everything here is just OK."], ["Shelly S.", "Great lil place. Glad they redid it. The food was good and the staff was awesome. And I love the variety of choices."], ["Erick F.", "I love love love town line diner, everyone is so friendly and the food is quick and always so consistent. The late night visits, or the early morning breakfasts, they never fail to keep me satisfied and I have been going for a while!"], ["Heather W.", "It's open 24 hours, which is a huge plus. Standard diner food-- I had a delicious waffle, my husband had pot roast. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and service was quick. We will definitely return when we are in need of high-calorie comfort food."], ["Kevin C.", "It pains me to give a one star review because the staff seems nice and I'm a fan of small businesses, but in this case a wake up call is desperately needed. \u00a0Waitress and host were nice, but that's about the end of the positive. \u00a0My wife and I did the Friday night special which comes with a soup or salad, \"vegetable\" , main potato and dessert. \u00a0The reason vegetable is in quotes is because the choices included macaroni salad, and applesauce... \u00a0 Even though this seems like a deal, it's not when the quality was so low. My wife got roasted chicken that came with stuffing. \u00a0It was just a very dry chunk of dark meat chicken that came with the center carcass still attached. The stuffing was inedible. \u00a0I got the shrimp casserole that was marginally better but still not good. \u00a0Then the sides we choose were also poor. Spinach and rice tasted like a spoon full of Rosemary and salt. \u00a0The sweet potato was bright orange and covered with some jello consistency \"sauce\" on top of it. \u00a0 It looked unsafe for human consumption as no sweet potato is that color inside and out. \u00a0I uploaded a picture. I truly hope that improvements are made here to keep this place alive. We had nice hopes when we stumbled upon this on our road trip, and will be sure to avoid next pass by."], ["Jay F.", "Food is absolutely terrible. The worst I've ever had. Service was great and that's the reason for the star.. My God- you couldn't destroy food so bad if you scrapped it off the road. Move on."], ["Vildana H.", "Absolutely best place to eat in the area. Very clean, amazing staff food is awesome. My favorite place to take my family."], ["Tony C.", "I have been coming here for years. \u00a0Used to come when I was younger every Friday and Saturday night after the bars closed. \u00a0I came in last night with 2 other friends for a quick breakfast. \u00a0The place has been updated and looks good. \u00a0I never had any complaints with the food or the service but then again I have only had breakfast here. \u00a0Not a bad choice here"], ["Bill P.", "Great experience for a diner! I went the other day for brunch and split eggs Benedict and Greek eggs Benedict and could not be happier! Also had an order of the thick French toast (made with challah break I think) which was absolutely amazing. I remember going here quite a bit in high school and for some reason the restaurant lost its appeal for several years, but now that I've gone back I know I'll be frequenting it more often!"], ["Bill H.", "We go there a few times a year when our usual places are packed or during inclement weather since they're almost always open and you can usually get in. Service has been ok. Every meal I've had there tastes like it has one ingredient too many that gives it an odd taste that is not like you'd expect, especially anything with a sauce or a gravy. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. Home fries are hardly fried, more like mushy chunks of overcooked potato with a light browning. Stick to pancakes and deli-type sandwiches with standard condiments and you're probably ok."]]}
