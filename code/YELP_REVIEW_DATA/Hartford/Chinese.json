I made it in right before they closed and placed my order for tofu and broccoli (a brown sauce) with white rice. As I ordered standing at the counter, I realized I could see into the entire kitchen, and I was surprised to find how clean and orderly everything seemed. They even have the menus displayed on screens so you can see what's offered while you stand in line. Finally, I think they've done a great job with the branding of the place - the logo is professional, the menus are well-done, and I could totally see myself taking a seat at one of the tables and people-watching during my meal.This place is a local small business that makes great Chinese American food and is owned by a wife-husband duo. It took less than 10 min for my food to be done, and while I waited, I chatted with the wife and watched her husband cook the food. She said they moved from mainland China 36 years ago and the restaurant has been open for 30 of those years. They're open six days a week, and they take a week off in the winter and a week in the summer for vacation and close down the restaurant while they're gone. Obviously they're doing something right if they've stayed open for this long! To address the brusque service that many other Yelpers seemed to complain about, I echo what Jon L. said, \"She knows she has to hustle to serve all of her customers and she knows that her regulars need to get their food fast and get back to work. The way she operates allows that to happen.\" I have not personally witnessed this lunch rush, but the friendly way she treated me led me to believe that she was actually trying to be courteous of everyone's time through the efficient way she runs the place, even if it was interpreted as rudeness.I docked a star because they don't offer free water (only purchased drinks), they use the environmental terror that is styrofoam for their takeout containers, and I wish they had a minimum spend requirement to use debit/credit--instead it's cash only. But for the $7 and some change I paid, the money was well spent for the hot, freshly made food.EDIT: I came back a couple days later and tried their sesame tofu, which strangely has a bright red sauce that tasted a little like sweet and sour sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of this entree and would probably stick with the tofu and broccoli with brown sauce I ordered last time instead.

Food tastes good bc it's so fat, however the Vietnamese lady tho \u00a0she's got the worst attitude in the world! I don't know why people keep coming back I guess it's because of the location and the food. She's the type you would only see in cartoon I have never knew this type of lady existed in real life. I suggest coming back with your headphones on so she can't yell at you. Or just stop by just to check out her attitude, she should have her own reality tv show bc the way she treats her customers are like she treats someone who had just killed her entire family. I think she should sign up to go to jerry springer or something she would win!"], ["Kelly Y.", "This lady is so crazy and mean, it's hard to come here anymore.One more bad experience, and I will vow never to return.She is so mean to her staff. \u00a0I feel bad for them, and it's uncomfortable.She yells at people to stand here, move to the side, do this, which I get to an extent.Also, when you call in an order, you can get the guy, who is very accommodating and nice, or she answers, yells she can't do certain things (like sauce on the side. which is no problem for the guy), and says shes too busy, call again later.The food is good, the cafe is clean. \u00a0I'll give it one more shot, but if she is still on fire, I'm never going back."], ["Emily C.", "Mmm...Chinese comfort food at its finest. This tucked away family run business has become my new downtown favorite for a quick, casual bite. I'd passed it so many times walking from the Market Street Marriott (my secret go to for public parking these days - shhh) to City Steam but only recently stopped in for lunch.Seriously solid Chinese-American food. Give me a heaping dish of perfectly spiced General Tso's, savory pork fried rice and chicken & broccoli (ok, throw in some crispy, delectable crab wontons while you're at it) and I'm the happiest gal alive. It's a casual, no frills atmosphere but it works. Oh, and the nearly out the door lunch line goes FAST, so don't fear! Since my first visit, I've been talking it up to my boyfriend who finally went last week before covering a show at the XL center. He's a new SK convert so I'm confident that we'll be eating there more often going forward. BIG WIN on my end. There don't seem to be a ton of local Chinese places conducive to eating in (other than Butterfly, Chengdu and those white tablecloth type places) so this is a much appreciated find."], ["Jacqui B.", "This restaurant is pretty good. \u00a0The food is tasty and it is reasonably priced. \u00a0It feels a little mall-ish to me (like food court style), so I don't love that. \u00a0My main issue is that some of the staff is a bit difficult. \u00a0The lady who works there and answers the phones is not interested in being accommodating at all if you call ahead and ask for something special. \u00a0I like my food steamed, and she always yells at me. \u00a0I don't like to be yelled at when I'm at lunch, I get that enough everywhere else.It's the only Chinese place in town, so I go there and the food is good enough, but if there was a different Chinese restaurant close by I would switch."], ["Slaine F.", "Just started working in Hartford and one of my coworkers recommended we get some lunch from Saigon Kitchen. \u00a0While the menu was kind of limited, there still was more than enough to find several items I'd want. \u00a0Indeed, the simplest fare -- Pork Lo Mein -- was excellent. \u00a0It was smokey, a little salty, and very oily, but otherwise had a great flavor and I'll definitely order it again. \u00a0Now I'm curious how their General Tso's Chicken will stack up."], ["Wilther M.", "Downtown Hartford's best option for greasy American Chinese food!I do like to be a fatty every now and then though.. so I've indulged and was not blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. If you find yourself in the mood for some American Chinese food, consider Saigon Kitchen!

Nothing special, but good for what it is."], ["Kerri P.", "The salty, smoky veg lo mein really hit the spot! For about \u00a0$6.50 I was able to get about three meals' worth of food here. The line at lunch was to the door, but they have a well-oiled machine. This moves quickly, and I have to admit that even though the cash only policy is a little inconvenient for me, it definitely speeds things along. Fast, good, inexpensive, and a decent vegetarian menu."], ["Neesha B.", "I really like this place. The prices are very reasonable and the hot and spicy chicken is delicious.

For like $6.50 you get a choice of fried rice or lo main with two meats with choice of boneless ribs, general Tao , sweet and spicy and or sesame chicken.
