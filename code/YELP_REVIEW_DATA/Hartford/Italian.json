I never would have tried it but for Yelp (thank you thank you previous posters). Ok, now let me stop swooning over this place and get to the details...Tried two items off their specials menu - the Rhode Island Fried Calamari and the Crab Ravioli with Shrimp. They were both AMAZING. The calamari was incredibly unique - not the usual fried calamari with marinara sauce. It was also huge. The Crab Ravioli was stuffed with delicious crab, but even better, the sauce it was in was AMAZING. It was cream based which is usually too heavy for me but the flavor made it perfect. It also came with some steamed broccoli which was a nice touch. This was ten times better than any Olive Garden variety of this dish. It was one of the best cream sauces I've ever had. My husband had the steak and cheese grinder which he enjoyed. I had a bite and thought it was very good. Nothing extraordinary but it is certainly not a dish you'd try if you want extraordinary anywhere. He exclaimed in particular how much he liked the melted the cheese though. The service was great too. Seemed like the waitress was running the whole place herself and was doing an excellent job keeping up with my husband's endless soda habit. They also serve complimentary bread and oil. The oil had roasted garlic - amazeballs! Looks very nondescript outside and not in the nicest area but go inside - it looks great and clean. Now GO!"], ["Trish L.", "Horrible service. I ordered calimari, soup, fries and potato skins for delivery. They said it would be 45 minuets not a big deal. About half an hour later I get a call from them asking my address I give it to them, they tell me next time to give them a different street, guess I don't know my own address, and the guy then says do you see my car? No! I'm not outzide, no one rang my door bell, you didn't even say you were here, just confirmed the address. So I say ok IL be right out. I go outside the guy isn't at the door so I wait, I then see that he's still sitting in his car. The guy wouldn't even come to the door. I wouldn't have cared if he wasn't so rude. I gave him a 20% tip and he just huffed at me. I go insid3 and realize, they forgot half my order I call back tell them they say that they are backed up and that they can give me ceedit. I tell them no I want m order. So they say ok in a pissy tone and hang up. So now it's ten minuets before they close I just called then asking about my food. Said it's on the way it's really not that far from my house. So rude. I just wanted my food. That's all. Horrible service.

Your regular everyday Italian dishes (lasagna, spaghetti, etc.) are amazing.But on top of all that, what impresses me the most about this place (and I've probably been here 50 times, literally), is that outside of their regular menu, they have a chef's specials menu which change up every few days and anything (and I mean ANYTHING) I've ordered off of this menu has been DELICIOUS!! You're getting the same quality entrees off the chef's specials menu that you would be getting at a well known restaurant in a big city... but at half (if not less even) the price!

Some items are hits like the salmon but others are disgusting (shrimp - hard as a rock).Food wise this place is about 3-stars. Service wise this place is a negative 500. I have been here maybe 3 times but I always get the same rude server. He's a middle aged Italian guy who is very rude. If your food tastes off or weird, don't expect them to change it or try to fix the problem. They just tell you \"it's how we make it here\". So if you get bad seafood, they will 1) yell in your face and 2) expect you to eat it and pay the bill. I hope the servers here know that a tip is proportionate to the service. We got chased down into the parking lot for giving a 15% tip instead of a 18% tip! The server came after us! The owner is a sleezebag and tells people not to come back.

The service we received this evening was by no means unacceptable, but there were some minor issues. First of all, our waiter was, for lack of a better word, weird... Not mean or inattentive, but quirky and unrefined for such a nice restaurant. Also, our meals arrived a bit late. There was a table that was seated well after us, and had their meals served well before us.Again, not huge issues here. Just little hiccups here and there which are quite frankly the major reason Francesco's isn't getting that coveted fifth star.Let's focus on the good things... The food was very, very good. We had a fried mozzarella appetizer, and two really well-prepared pasta dishes. Unique and fresh. Not to mention, plenty of warm bread and olive oil for dipping on the side. The decor is top notch too... a very pleasant environment to have a nice meal, both in the bar and in the dining room.Now without further ado, this review would simply not be complete without mention of the quality evening entertainment! Little did we know, just minutes after we sat down for dinner in the bar, we would be treated to the melodic rhythms of a lounge singer with an electric piano!!!I'm not even kidding. If you go on a Thursday-Saturday night, and sit in the bar, you get the lounge singer at 8PM, followed by dancing at 10PM...I mean hey, the guy was really nice, and came over several times to \"serenade\" my girlfriend and I at our table... But holy heck was this whole thing kitchy! I'm still laughing about it even as I write this... Yeah, we loved every second of it, but I'm 100% sure the owners of the restaurant don't appreciate the cognitive dissonance of this self-inflicted dog-and pony show like we did.Fortunately, you can opt out of this hot mess and just sit in the dining room. But why would you want to?! Oh sure, you came in for a quiet and romantic meal, but you never knew you wanted an off-key rendition of \"Strangers in the Night\" for dessert!Wild stuff... we'll surely go back soon."], ["Thea Z.", "My family and I chose this restaurant as it seemed like a nice option for the Taste of Hartford for 2010 judging by the menu and the reputation. We first had difficulty with the reservations as we called several times and no one picked up. This should have been our first clue. We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation which was at that time and did expect to wait a little bit due to it being the taste of hartford. After finally finding the person to check in with we waited 40 minutes to be seated. Not terrible, but a little frustrating. We waited 20 minutes for our waiter to come over and take our orders and he promptly dashed off after taking them leaving our menus on our table. \u00a0Shortly after that, someone brought us bread. Almost 40 minutes later, without seeing our waiter at all, our appetizers finally arrived. Since our water had run out, we ended up going over to the waiter stand and starting pouring our own water. Other customers took note and took the pepper grinder and did their own pepper because they hadnt seen their waiter either. Fortunately the food had good flavor and gave us hope that dinner would be great. We even ended up busing our own tables and stacked our dishes and were about to bring them to the waiter stand when someone actually took them from us. At this point we had been there over 2 hours and were starving. Many people were complaining and the staff just seemed to run around without a clue and our waiter avoided us at all costs. Some staff would walk into our room in the restaurant with one plate, look around confused, and then turn back, By 9:55pm (2 and a half hours into dinner) we were so frustrated that we calculated how much we thought the appetizers would have cost based on the menu, left that on the table and got up and left. As we were leaving we flagged our waiter down who was wandering around and he seemed surprised and said, oh your dinner is sitting on the window. We all thought to ourselves, if you knew it was done why wouldnt you have brought it over?!?! Too bad we never got to taste our dinner, and will never find out what the food is like there. TERRIBLE SERVICE."], ["Marc M.", "Franklin Avenue was once the hub of Italian-American life in Hartford. The restaurants and bakeries remain but much else has changed. One constant is Francesco's.

Both great and not high cal either."], ["Kathryn L.", "I was curious given the mixed reviews - but I loved this place from the moment I called for a reservation. The man on the phone was cheerful and appreciative of our business. The by the glass wine list was great. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable - when I ordered a spicy dish they told me this batch of peppers was extremely spicy - I ended up changing to the the Capellini which was perfectly al dente and seasoned. My husband had the the veal parm which came with a side of penne ala vodka - all great! No side salads with the dish but the bread is so delicious you won't need one.

The rest of the meal was run-of-the-mill.Red sauce had too much tomato paste in it. It was bitter, cloying and over-cooked, just mildly seasoned with garlic -- and oregano (no, no, no!) -- instead of plenty of basil, parsley and onion. Can't you do better than this for the price?A pasta in cream sauce was over-cooked and pasty, as if the cream sauce had been thickened with flour.

The bartender had extra martini he made me left in the shaker. Instead of giving it to me he poured it into a shot glass and drank it. This to me is very unprofessional and if it were my business it would not be tolerated. Anyway, the service was very good throughout. The prices here are on the more expensive side. I had a Cesar's salad, Italian wedding soup, and chicken scarpiello. Everything was good, hot, and tasted freshly made. I was disappointed to see that they didn't have at least one fresh pasta dish.

My gnocchi, while good, just wasn't exactly what I wanted, but they might as well have scraped the dish clean. The only thing to illicit even a small complaint was a weird cheesy polenta for a side. Dessert for me was a tiny biscuit with a few berries and whipped cream, and anyone who got the chocolate option got screwed - they had the thinnest sliver of chocolate torte that you could possibly imagine, though both were delicious. They have a pretty excellent selection of wines, though the markup is ridiculous. I ordered a dirty martini - very average, but at least it was big. I had a catered lunch from here last year, and there was a remarkable salmon dish that my friend and I still talk about.

I know how to make a Caesar salad, and I can attest that this is the authentic way to do it. \u00a0The only thing I might have done differently is shred the cheese instead of finely grate it, but that's just because I'm used to that way of doing it. \u00a0It did not compromise the taste of the salad to use a more finely grated cheese.We both had the Veal Rollatini, which really benefitted from the smoky, porky lardons in the sauce. \u00a0The mushroom sauce was very good, too. \u00a0The veal itself was melt in your mouth. \u00a0I can see why they have a reputation for veal.I had the pannetone bread pudding, which was everything it should be and more. \u00a0I have made it myself and I liked theirs even more than my own, which says a lot!I have to say that I am very happy to see that Carbone's is going strong on its third generation in the family. It did our hearts good to see it doing so well. Restaurants with such a history should be treasured by a community and it would hurt to see it in a state of decline. \u00a0 Some people complain about the outdated decor, but in my opinion they just don't get it. \u00a0Some restaurants should be a bit outdated to preserve the flavor of their history. \u00a0It's not just about the food, it's about the entire experience and how it relates to their past. \u00a0You have to have an appreciation for history, especially culinary history to get it. \u00a0From the attended coat room, to the wood mouldings, to the tableside preparation, to the style of the bar, this place is history and should be appreciated as such. \u00a0Hartford has too few restaurants in this category, so it is somewhat of an endangered species. \u00a0I think they have done a good job keeping it relevant for today while preserving the attractive aspects of its past. \u00a0We will definitely come back in FAR less time than a decade!"], ["Lauren V.", "This place did not meet my expectations.

Fried Cheese Spiedini - Interesting once again. \u00a0Not your typical fried cheese app. \u00a0It had a real nice flavor and the panko bread crumbs added a layer of complexity to the dish. \u00a0Fried Calamari - Your standard fried calamari with an entire bowl of sauce to accompany it. \u00a0It was well prepared, nicely fried and tender.Tomato, Mozzarella & Prosciutto Bruschetta - Considering that everything else we had was fried, this was a nice compliment to the other dishes. \u00a0Very fresh and tasty app on a hard cracker but the softness of the buffalo mozzarella, freshness of the tomato and saltiness of the prosciutto really went nicely with it..I was pretty much stuffed after the appetizers but for my entree I had the veal and eggplant napoleon. \u00a0Very unique dish. \u00a0Came out piping hot. \u00a0I loved the sauce and the veal was very well prepared. \u00a0Definitely would like to have it again when I can actually eat more than two bites of it. \u00a0I also tried the Fettuccine Carbonara and it was DELICIOUS! \u00a0Heavy on the bacon, sausage and prosciutto like it's supposed to be. \u00a0We were the last patrons in the restaurant and the service was good. \u00a0The ambiance is also very nice, relaxing atmosphere, kind of a homey living room/library type feel - well done.Really enjoyed the restaurant and highly recommend it."], ["T S.", "Carbone's food keeps getting better and better for traditional Italian dishes.

This is based on three visits; one \"okay\" visit a year or so ago, one spectacular visit six months ago, and one very recently.The food quality, overall, is just barely worth the money. There were some high points. Most memorable was a luncheon mixed grill with steak and sausages that was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and absolutely delicious. The dinner steak is not the most expensive in Hartford ($32) but wasn't the greatest piece of meat. The gorgonzola covering it had been over-cooked under a broiler (or a heat lamp). The doneness was perfect medium-medium-rare.Very surprisingly, the tomato sauce \"Pomodoro\" is a bit too acidic, too thin and redolent of burnt garlic. Pasta, however, was good-quality and cooked perfectly.Veal piccata was tender, tasty and served in abundance. A vegetable side (broccoli rabe with beans) was done perfectly and delightfully seasoned.Desserts were a throw-away and over-priced. Coffee was very, very good. First-date people will want to opt for the crepes that are flambeed at table-side. I seem to recall that dish set us back about $18 but by then I had a heck of a wine buzz so don't quote me.Wines were serviceable but expensive. Cocktails were \"meh\" and over-priced. When I want ice water with my meal, please, please don't do the New York thing and push bottled water nor sparkling water, thank you very much.The room is handsome and impeccably clean. Table appointments are of very high quality, in keeping with this level of dining.The bar was uber-crowded with local swells and minor celebrities and we've found the atmosphere somewhat off-putting. No, I don't want to be a member of Hartford's \"inner-circle.\"The most peculiar thing to us is the way we were served, from greeting to farewell, all three times -- each in a different fashion. The first visit, after which we intended to return (someday), the greeting was crisp; we were parked in the bar for 45 minutes, then the service was attentive and pleasant.The second time we went was with a guy who's a friend, and who's a minor entertainment celebrity in Hartford and gets quite a bit of media exposure. Before we even got our drinks at the bar, the owner's wife came careening out of a hallway and greeted us effusively (we've seen her around and she's not like this at all). When our host introduced me to her, she responded \"oh, I know Bob.\" She doesn't. The meal that followed was filled with little extras (some free; some were actually charged - I paid the bill, without complaint, 'cause we either ate it or took it home).The evening continued with a server and a runner committed to our table. This made us a little self-conscious because we perceived that service for some other tables was being compromised. We couldn't talk in confidence 'cause there were all these people hovering around us. The other guy with us is painfully shy and it actually made him extremely uncomfortable, to the point that I nearly got up to suggest that the staff leave us alone.The most recent time we visited was on a sleepy week-day lunch. The effusive greeting wasn't there. The staff was just going through the motions. A soiled knife had been set on the table and was replaced without apology. The kitchen failed to clean-up a plate rim that'd been splattered with sauce. This is just nit-picking and didn't lessen my experience, but all together it showed that they just didn't care.Your mileage may vary. I encourage anyone who's not been here to try them at least once. A restaurant with such incredible longevity must have something going for it.

I had looked forward to what I had experienced before. Rather let down. When I ordered the fish luncheon plate. I specifically asked how it was prepared & if the fish was fresh. I mentioned I did not like fried fish. The waiter said the fish was fresh and would be pan-seared. It came to my table with a light batter, a 'fry' taste and was too salty. Very disappointed. On the next occasion, I ordered my tried-and-true happy hanger steak. [During the winter, I returned weekly for Treva's fabulous sliced steak plate. I often dined with no one in the backroom and just a few straggler diners & their pcs at the small tables located in the bar]. This last visit, my plate had 1/3 the steak, and slices were sinewy, almost un-chewable. Oh, the vegetables are always yums; the service is kind and generous; and the wines are lovely without being prohibitive in cost. However, if a bistro raises the price of luncheon specials, and then does not deliver the same quality and the same quantity, its not as it was. I hope to try it again soon."], ["Andrew P.", "I HAVE to give this place five stars! The bar, which I enjoy, is one of the finer bars in West Hartford. The reason is simple; knowledgable bartenders, great food, great service and an awesome menu! Trev\u00e1 is a little on the expensive side for my taste but, it is definitely worth the price!

It was quite nice. The ambiance and the way the place was decorated was very attractive and fullfilling making me feel like I was somewhere other than West Hartford CT. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer...totally awesome. The watermelon cocktail was one of the best drinks Ive ever had. Then the entre was trout with lentils on the side. I gotta say that piece of fish was totally great, and hadnt had it that good in awhile. Dessert was good too, having the chocolate cheese cake. Service was ok. The guy did his job. But for the overall food experience I gotta say...one of the best places Ive ever eaten around the Hartford area. Im going back soon!"], ["Kristin K.", "Hands down one of my favorite restaurants. Everything is so fresh, great service, and pasta is made in house. I have been here at least a dozen times and my experience last night was no different. My boyfriend and I went out for a midweek date night. We made a 6 o'clock reservation and were seated right away and our waiter came over to us immediately. We started off with a bottle of chianti Classico. We found out from the menu we could have byob with a $20 corkage fee. Our bottle of wine was $50 so that's a good option for the future. Wine was delicious and thanks to our server my glass was never empty. We started with a meat and cheese plate (a must) and picked 4 items for $14. Prosciutto and soppressata for our meats and taleggio (semi soft like a Brie) and Cacio di Tartuffo (a new to me cheese that was made from sheeps milk and truffles, amazing!). The plate comes with pickled carrots and an assortment of olives as well. Warm bread and olive oil were also brought to the table in advance of the meat and cheese. For our meals, I always go with the fresh pasta and I always special order something that's no longer on the menu. However this is what I love about Treva, the Gorgonzola gnocchi hasn't been on the menu for a few years now but they still always agree to make it for me, no questions asked. It is the most delicious pillowy fresh gnocchi with this creamy Gorgonzola sauce with radicchio drizzled on top. SOO GOOD everytime!!! My boyfriend went with the ravioli of the day, stuffed with ricotta, asparagus, and prosciutto covered in a butter sauce. His plate included 6 very good sized ravioli that were so stuffed with filling they looked like they were going to pop right open! I of course tried a bite (or 3) and they were incredible. He is not one to give dishes high ratings unless they're top notch, so when I asked how his meal was and he said, \"very very good\", I knew he wasn't kidding. Needless to say after all that food we did not have room for dessert. Although I have had the ricotta cheesecake before and would definitely recommend it again. All in all it was a great night and an amazing meal/amazing service and I will be back again. Treva if you're reading this, please never get rid of that Gorgonzola gnocchi."], ["Sammy S.", "Came here for some happy hour with some freinds the happy hour menu has a great selection the martini was strong everything is $2 -$5 on the menu this place gets packed so be sure to arrive on time 4-6pm sharp great place totally recommend it"], ["Noelle S.", "Last night two friends and I went to Treva for dinner, and we had an amazing meal. If you haven't been yet, go, TONIGHT.For my before dinner drink I ordered a Bellini, and my friends ordered a glass of Malbec and a Back East draft. Not a big beer selection at all so don't come here for beer. They have a huge wine list, and great cocktail list. My friend said the Malbec our server chose was fantastic. They also serve Nobilo sauvignon blanc which is my favorite.For apps we ordered the calamari, which was breaded and lightly fried with pieces of hot cherry peppers and thin pieces of zucchini also tossed in there, served with a side of marinara sauce.Of course, we had to do the meat & cheese plate. The menu lists 8 cheeses (a variation of hard and soft) and 8 cured meats, and we did the $24 meat and cheese plate where you pick 4 meats and 4 cheeses. For meats we had the prosciutto, speck prosciutto, mortadella, and borsellino. For the cheeses I had our server pick his favorite 4. He chose the parmigiano reggiano, Gorgonzola dolce, robiola, and cambozola. He gave us 2 hard cheeses and balanced it out with 2 soft ones. Perfect. The plate was served with a little bowl of olives and the house bread with olive oil. Yum. We really enjoyed getting to try a little of everything.For our entrees, two of us ordered the Pettine scallops. They were big half-dollar sized scallops cooked perfectly. They were served on top of polenta and wild mushrooms with shaved asparagus. I would order this again even though I want to try everything on the menu.. I'd highly suggest this plate! My boyfriend ordered the rigatoni bolognese pasta dish. The sauce was made with fennel sausage and beef. He said the sauce was really good, but the pasta was too al dente to his liking. We will definitely be back!!"], ["Yuchen Z.", "BRUNCH Update. I previously came to Treva for lunch and I had a 4 star experience. Delicious food, great atmosphere, great service. Today, I went back for brunch and it was way less satisfying... =/ They have a small brunch menu with classic breakfast dishes like eggs benedicts, omelets, fritattas, etc. Small does not mean bad though, they could have all been solid dishes.... However, they were not. We had the eggs benedict with martadella and one with spinach and we also had the fritatta. I think overall, the dishes were just *bland* - which really is the worst thing a dish can be. Everything about all the dishes were under seasoned and one note flavored. The \"home fries\" were like 10 potatoe pieces which were unevenly cooked or rather overcooked. The fruit cup were made with not fresh fruit-or at least it didn't seem like it. The one good thing was their juices were freshly squeezed... but they service it with ice (without asking us) and so it seems we get a lot less than with ice. Service was fine, we had about 3 people serving us, I don't know why really. But they were all nice and friendly. I do like the Treva atmosphere and I do like the lighting and it is classy and all that. Don't get me wrong, I am still a very big fan of Treva's lunch and dinner menus and those dishes are quite delicious. However, I definitely had a 2 star brunch experience this time. I have had MUCH better brunches for a lower prices in the area."], ["Mark H.", "Treva is very fun and feels more upscale than the rest of the locations in WeHa Center. \u00a0The staff is very friendly and I've always had great service there. \u00a0It feels like it's more expensive than other similar places in the area for HH but it's still a great choice. \u00a0My only qualm is that I have often felt that the HH food menu appears boring... in that I have never had the experience that I didn't know what to pick because everything sounded too good. \u00a0That being said, the burger is awesome. \u00a0They also have this fun ice compressor thing that they use to make these spheres for cocktail rocks. \u00a0Neat stuff."], ["Mais S.", "Our experience was amazing! The food was delicious and our server was super nice their polenta was one of the best I have ever had."], ["Michael P.", "Treva is neither pretentious fine dining nor the bastardized cuisine of your local red sauce joint. it is pure, authentic Italian food in its finest form, where flavors are derived not from the addition of unnecessary spices and accompaniments, but from the chef's deft manipulation of simple, fresh ingredients. Had the seared cod with escarole and beans in a light tomato sauce and a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on my last trip. Not the most exotic or extravagant components, but altogether it was incredible, both in taste and texture. And I could eat the mushrooms for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Highly recommend some sliced prosciutto or sopressata as well.Service is on par with the food, have yet to have anything less than an excellent experience. In my opinion, the best of West Hartford, and probably one of the better spots in CT.

Made 1:30 rezzies via Open Table and we were glad we did because Treva was fairly crowded. The interior is beautifuly decorated with light yellow painted walls, artwork and minimalist hanging lights.The Brunch menu runs $12-$14 for a nice selection of french toast and egg dishes -all served with fruit and home fries. We had a Pannetone French toast (with marscapone and bananas) and a Bistecca Panini (steak, fried eggs, mushroom, arugula). Pre-meal cocktails were a terrific Bloody Mary ($10) and a Blood Orange Bellini (with Prosecco for $9).The food was very good. My panini was \"last meal\" worthy. Service started off great and nose-dived after the food was served. No ketchup served or offered for the fries, no check back during the meal, no refills on the coffees we had with the food.Even though they have a vestibule between the inner and outer doors, it didnt work too well as a shot of Arctic air came roaring at us every time someone exited or entered.Bottom line?

This seemingly, dim, small, sort of odd looking joint is SERIOUSLY underrated! I went here with my sister after First and Last told us that they stopped serving Breakfast. The person at the register actually recommended this place to us which was awesome and my God was it a great choice! They make their own Italian bread and serve it with pretty much everything they make there. Breakfast is served all day and I do believe that they close fairly early.Also, this place is a total local hangout, you have the standard Hartford peeps, blue collared hanging out here and minding their own buisness (awesome for two young women who clearly aren't locals) and the little Italy crowd who also come in. Everyone seemed to know the people who ran the place so it gave off a great homey-vibe :).I ordered the brocolli and cheese omellete with homefries and YUM! It was cooked with light salt which I always love because then you can just add on your own. Homefries were crispy in all the right places and while we waited we could see the chef/cook making our food. My sister also really loved her meal and we were floored by the price.

Perhaps she doesn't understand what \"Italian American\" food is and that italian sausage is what you get when you go to breakfast at an Italian American restaurant. Or maybe she doesn't know what good ingredients are. Or her rating the prices of food when she hasn't ordered appetizers of massive portions of deliciousness is not the brightest move. Or maybe she got take out and let it sit and was a poor excuse for an eater. Any of these options are possible. I've been going to the Allegro since I was a child. As a kid, my sister and I would order ravioli and fruit punch for breakfast. It is the greatest ravioli and sauce in the world! Not to mention the bread is fantastic and great for sopping up the sauce. Now, I'm a eggs, bacon and potatoes girl when it comes to breakfast as an adult. Everything is large portions and delicious - get outta here with that no flavor potatoes talk! The french toast is amazing and made with Italian bread so it's thick and great for glopping on the syrup - sorry you couldn't get some Mrs. Buttersworth sugar. My older brother always got the breakfast sangwiches and they're made on Italian bread and stacked with goodness. Grinders are just as good as everything else! Load up the meat, peppers, and condiments, please! And if you're able to get the lemon chicken as a meal, go for it!

I had a bite, but i do not like ITALIAN sausage with my eggs.....would have been pretty perfect if it was breakfast sausage......One egg seems to get lost in the breading, both with the Italian bread and the 'hard roll' used on my sammy. Again, the middle got list in the big bread....one egg, and the bacon was crisy as i asked, but had no flavor and parts of it were just still white...it was almost like it was 'burned, undercooked bacon'' Ya know what i mean? I ate most of the sammy before pitching the rest.....Oh it also needed lots of back pepper for flavor.We got a side order of their potatoes....hoping they would be like Mo's cuz they grill them like that....but they were sadly naked and crying for spice! I added some pepper and a touch of sea salt but they definitely would have been much better with some garlic, onion and paprika, etc!We also got an order of French toast.....Now THAT was pretty great....I had to add some cinnamon at home, and use my own syrup (instead of the low quality packets they give u....total 'NO name' ...not even smuckers or kraft, which is the lowest grade i will accept. I grew up in Northern New England and true Maple syrup is the only way to go!) but the huge pieces of italian bread were soft and yummy with a chewy crust.

Unfortunately, the service was terrible when I went last weekend for an early dinner. We got there at 4:45 thinking we'd beat the dinner rush but the menus weren't printed yet so we had to wait to sit until they were done. Our waitress didn't tell us the specials but we heard her telling tables around us. Our appetizers never came so all we had to eat was a salad and a pizza to split. We had to flag the waitress down when we needed things because she never came to check on us on her own. The service was ridiculously slow. It was such a disappointment since it had been 6 mos since my husband and I last were able to get a babysitter and get out without the kids."], ["Sarah L.", "I had my birthday lunch here today with my husband. I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was terrific. My husband got the baked rigatoni and I got the carbonara. They were both amazing. The calamari appetizer was one of the best we've ever had, and we eat a LOT of calamari. The ambiance is lovely--warm, cozy, and inviting. I got the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream and my husband had the creme brulee. The latter is another one of those things we ALWAYS get, and he said it was phenomenal (although the accompanying chocolate-chip cookie is an odd, if delicious, choice).We'll definitely be back! It's not a place for kids, but I think it would be a great place for a date night or a meal with friends. Thanks for helping to make my birthday special. :)"], ["Doug E.", "Surprisingly, my wife and I got in to Bricco the other evening. \u00a0Usually, we are talked down to by the \"welcome\" staff as we are told we'll need to wait and in a way that makes us feel so foolish for even having tried to come in. \u00a0Once seated, we were finally greeted by a very busy waiter. \u00a0After finally getting our drinks, I asked if all of the evening's selections were on the menu, to which the waiter replied, \"yes\". \u00a0Note, after we ordered my wife overheard that the table behind us was provided a verbal list of additions to the menu by their waiter.I ordered an old favorite, Fennel & Black Pepper Crusted Tuna. \u00a0I say old, as it seems that little changes on their menu. \u00a0Have you seen Dustin Hoffman in \"Chef\"? \u00a0While I guess to Billy Grant's credit he did change up this old favorite, but really. \u00a0Argh! \u00a0There were these slimy potatoes under the tuna. \u00a0The tuna was well prepared but the sauce, usually a nice combination of sweet and savory - it might have come out of some obscure bottle they bought at the local 7-11. \u00a0My wife ordered her old favorite as well, a gluten free Penne Ala Vodka, which she declared as \"delicious\". \u00a0Their GF pasta is our primary reason for dining at Bricco.Overall, West Hartford Center is a great place to walk around. \u00a0Bricco, like many of the other restaurants is difficult to get in to, has rude staff, and okay and sometime good food. \u00a0Add to that difficult and pricy parking, and we'll be looking to head out of the Center for dining. \u00a0Or, we might just order the GF pasta to go."], ["James V.", "Solid to excellent pasta plates.Friendly, not overbearing service.Monday night 1/2 price wine is great deal.Salads are interesting and delicious."], ["J D.", "Never had a bad meal here, or bad service.

Both were very good. \u00a0Samantha told us the calamari was prepared to order. \u00a0Very fresh and not chewy. Perfect coating. We also ordered one of their gourmet pizzas. \u00a0Another good selection but the competition for pizza in this area is tough. Next time we will order something from their plated section.

The food never fails to wow me. The gnocchi are homemade and come in lovely sauces. The bread and squash dip that precede the meal are to die for. The chocolate torte is heaven... so chocolaty and minimally sweet. On a recent visit, my husband ordered salmon and said it was the best he had ever had.

Whenever we pass by on a Friday or Saturday, it always looks so mobbed inside the restaurant. Luckily, it was less busy on a Sunday night. The dining room was full when we arrived, so we had a choice of waiting 15 minutes or just eat at a high top table in the bar area. We choose the bar since we were starving.I ordered the flirtini but wasn't a huge fan. My husband ordered a Cabernet which I think he enjoyed.They gave us some nice crusty bread with a really good butternut squash spread, very yummy.You really can't get any better than a place that makes their own pasta. I had a Bibb salad to start and my husband had a Brussels sprouts and pork belly salad. Both were really tasty salads. For entrees, I had the wood fire baked rigatoni and my husband got the chicken gnocchi. Both dishes were cooked well and I have no complaints. Can't wait to try some new dishes next time. Maybe the eggplant parm that they ran out of by 6pm. It must've been good.Might have to bump the rating up next time after we try some more dishes."], ["Kayla C.", "On a beautiful Tuesday night, I met my parent's here for dinner after a meeting I had in the area. For a Tuesday night, the place was packed!! They have a wonderful patio for enjoying the amazing weather, unfortunately, we were starving and it was ~45 min wait to sit outside, so we sat inside. They immediately placed a basket of fresh, warm bread in front of us with their sweet potato butter. The butter itself was good, however, I probably would have enjoyed it more had it have been more sweet, less savory with ?nutmeg etc. instead of garlic? However, that's just a personal preference- the butter itself was a nice alternative to typical butter, I, for one, stuck to the olive oil for dipping.We started with the warm pistachio goat cheese salad. I was a little disappointed as the salad was pretty bland--there was pistachio crusted goat cheese on the side, then the salad with some apples on top. It was good, it just wasn't as good as it sounded. I struggled in deciding whether or not to go with a pasta dish vs an artisinal pie and finally settled on pizza after asking the waitress what kind of oven the pizza was made in(wood-burning oven= done deal). I went with the fig pie--it was DELICIOUS-- fresh mozzarella, gorgonzola, fig(I was glad there weren't chunks of fig, but it was evenly spread jam-like over the pizza), \u00a0prosciutto, and topped with arugula. The combined toppings blended so well, with the sweetness being perfectly balanced with the peppery/zesty flavor of the arugula. The crust, however, was far too floury/bland with way too much bite, thicker than a neopolitan but still on the thinner side(I prefer a thinner crust-with some crispiness on first bite then soft,chewy flavorful dough- as opposed to just rough/tough to bite through, again a personal preference). I took a taste of each of the other meals-- penne ala vodka(standard, but fresh), jumbo shrimp scampi(delicious!!), margherita pizza(meh, okay, but pales in comparison to my favorite pizza places). Overall, the wait staff were all friendly and accommodating, all of the food was fresh and I definitely will be coming back!"], ["H. D.", "I thought this place was real nice. Very accommodating, waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Clean comfortable, cozy atmosphere.

I've had the pizza, the wings, and a couple calzones from here. By all means, always get the calzone. This place has some of the best calzones I've ever had anywhere.

I live really close by and it's convenient and delicious for take out. Recently, though, I had an experience that left me perplexed and far less willing to regularly eat at nolita's. It pains me to write this terrible review because the food is great; however, the service is bar none, some of the worst I've seen. I've recommended friends and coworkers try this restaurant before, and they always come back with the same reaction: great food! Terrible service! A few friends were visiting and I had raved about Nolita's food, so i decided to take them there. I had never eaten in and always get take out. Our party was only 5 people, and they told us they couldn't seat us for 20 minutes even though half the restaurant was empty. We proceeded to ask why we couldn't be seated immediately and they said it was because a large party was coming in 30 minutes because they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen, and now the wait would actually be 45 minutes. Apparently they weren't going to tell us that the wait was increasing until we asked why we couldn't be seated.We were in a bit of a time crunch, so we asked them if we could order take out. To which they said of course, it will be ready in 15 minutes! Clearly, they were not concerned about overloading the kitchen if they could prepare take out in 15 minutes. 15-20 minutes pass and we return for our food, and the hostess tells us that we need to wait an additional 20 minutes. At this point, there is still no large party in sight that was supposedly coming in 30 minutes from our arrival. We asked to talk to the manager, because at this point we were waiting for almost 45 minutes just to figure out what the heck was going on. While waiting for the manager, my boyfriend noticed on the hostess stand that the large party was scheduled to come in at 930pm; we arrived at Lolita's around 730pm....They claimed that the party changed their reservation to far later. I can't tell you whether they were lying or not, but either way, they repeatedly used that as their excuse even after they aware the party was arriving far later.Finally, we receive our food, and the manager tells us she put \"extra bread\" in for us. Well, thanks, i guess 45+ minutes of 5 peoples time is worth some extra bread... She proceeded to explain that Nolita's i not usually that busy and they were struggling to keep up. I'm not a restaurant expert, but if you can't handle a half filled restaurant on a Saturday night, then you're in trouble. I'm taking the time to write this review, because I really want Nolita to succeed; the food is superb, but a restaurant needs the whole package to succeed. They need to get a new manager and a new staff, or at least train their current staff, because the level of unprofessionalism and confusion from the staff completely detracts from food and experience. Nolita's not only needs to improve their actual service, but how they respond to poor service. \"Extra bread\" does not suffice, a real apology with some sort of compensation would have. As of now, Nolitas is only good for takeout. I didn't believe my coworkers about there service, but now I see exactly what they meant."], ["Jeff S.", "You may not think much of hotel restaurants, but this place may change your mind. I visited here on a chilly Monday night. It was very quiet, but there's a reason for that: the speakers in the dining area hadn't been connected yet. The hostess explained the restaurant hadn't officially opened yet, and that this was their \"soft opening.\" I'd say they're off to a great start! \u00a0The decor was simple but well done, and the tables looked really cool. Linens were real cloth and flatware was solid (that's important to me)There were two menus, one for dinners and one just for pizza. Of course I had to try one of the stone oven pizzas! \u00a0To go with it, I chose a homemade Italian-style raspberry soda. The soda was a rare treat. I'm a big fan of soda, though I find myself less and less attracted to the sugary canned stuff. Topped with whipped cream, the raspberry soda was delicately flavored, not too sweet, and not too fizzy. I'd drink this stuff every day if I could. While I waited, the waitress brought out some tasty bread with marinara sauce to nibble on. The bread \"nuggets\" were freshly toasted with garlic butter, the sauce was warmed and seemed homemade. Now, for the pizza! \u00a0Delish. I like spicy food, so I ordered the \"Fra Diavolo\" - spicy sausage and hot peppers. The sausage chunks were just the right size for a pizza, not too big or small. The peppers were whole rings including seeds, so in other words, full power. Yep, this pizza had some kick. The crust was well done. Thin, but not greasy or soggy anywhere. Good flavor. I didn't have a chance to try any dessert, though I would have been satisfied with another soda, I think!The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, and eager to please. Well, it worked. I left happy! \u00a0Thanks for the great dinner."], ["Dorthy D.", "Tried nolita for the first time today and it was amazing!!

However, the Hot Mary (a spicy bloody Mary) is very good, and the home fries are some of the best I've ever had. The salmon benedict is also very good.

Some in our group were leaning towards the Celebrate food tents, some were pushing to go to Max Burger or something else in the Center, and as we were discussing we walked by Rizzuto's and decided to peek in. They had an open table, a brunch/lunch menu, and air conditioning, so we were set.Our waiter was a little absent-minded (refilling the waters for everyone except the one who had asked for a refill) but he was very funny and personable. He chatted with us just enough to make an impression without overstaying his welcome. He also gave us great recommendations.We had a large-ish group for a walk-in (6 people) so I was impressed with how accomodating they were and how quickly we were waited on and served. We were convinced to have cocktails after initially balking at the price ($8 I think) and then realizing they offered $4 refills. YUM. I had the peach bellini, which was even better than I had expected. The others at my table had the South Beach mimosa and the Maui mimosa, which both got positive reviews as well.The food itself was decent - not amazing, but not bad. A few people in our group ordered from the brunch menu and got mixed results; the cast iron frittata especially got a thumbs down. I think that the waiter and the drinks are really what made our experience positive, whereas the food was just plain acceptable.

I was recently re-introduced to Rizzuto's during a yelp elite event after about a 3 year hiatus. Somehow, even as a West Hartford resident, it fell off my radar. I will have to apologize to them for this because when I went back with my husband after the (spectacular) yelp event, they blew me out of the water in both of those areas. Ive come to expect a pretty high level of service and good food from almost all restaurants in and around Blue Back Square, but Rizzuto's really stood out. I'll start with food and preface this by saying the only reason i didnt give them \"5-stars\" yet, is because I want to go back for a full meal. We only did happy hour drinks and small plates. My husband got the sliders - two mini-burgers that were perfectly cooked and seasoned. For such litle burgers, they packed a lot of juicy flavor, came with onion stick fries, and a deli pickle. I got the flatbread with a sweet a spicy fig-bbq sauce. It has chicken, caramelized onions, and some cherry peppers. Spicy, but not too hot, and really delicious. The fig adds a nice element to what otherwise might be a standard BBQ sauce. Both were a great size for $5. It also came with home-made semolina bread and marinara for dipping--- delish.Now service: this is where they really got me. Our waitor, Taufiqul, was outstanding (he also worked the yelp event i had been to prior). Polite, warm, friendly, well-spoken, knowledgable... he was all of that. You got the feeling that he genuinely cared about your dining experiene and would have gone out of his way to make sure it was the very best. What impressed us most, was actually over hearing him talk to the table next to us. They were new in town (had just moved) and this was their first time at Rizzuto's. Taufiqul thanked them for choosing the resturant, welcomed them to town, gave recommendations, and really set an amazing tone.

So great in fact that I have sat at the bar and had a bunch of delicious apps as dinner many times. I'm bummed that they put an end to their awesome happy hour - free salad/app bar with purchase of drink - but it's because people abused it (you know who you are, shame on you!), although the new one is still good. Oh, and brunch is FABULOUS! The organic kale and grilled tomato benedict topped with pumpkin seed pesto, perfectly creamy and savory hollandaise over toasted english muffins was to die for - all for an affordable $13! I'd bet that dish would go for at least $16-20 anywhere else in WeHa center. The wine list is naturally Italian focused but not novel length and has reasonable price ranges. I love that they infuse their own liquor for their cocktail menu - really makes a big difference in quality and taste! The only aspect that has been inconsistent for me is the service.

However,one of the best kept secrets happens to be their incredible desserts. Creative, seasonal and so many different flavors going on. Key lime torts, Tiramisu truffles, ricotta cheese cake- all top notch.All I can say is always save room for these deserts."], ["Kristen M.", "We have experienced truly outstanding service here.The good: - The ambiance - large, high ceilings, brick oven smells. Very warm and inviting.- Food is great. Italian American dishes. My fave is penne ala vodka and I ask them to add veggies. - We had our rehearsal dinner here. Staff was very accommodating. Prix fix options were affordable and good was great.- also great happy hourThe bad:- nothing bad. Food is good- nothing new and different per se. Overall: great casual place to go with friends for food and drink."], ["Becky C.", "Have been here a few times and the staff is great, especially Henry (an excellent waiter and you can tell he loves his job)! \u00a0They do need to have another dollar sign added for the pricing though. Usually very pleased with the food, although the tuna this time was not up to expectations. I do love that they use local farmers! Overall a great place, just need to anticipate spending a little more than we had expected on entr\u00e9es."], ["Amanda L.", "Came here a long time ago during lunch hours and I was very impressed by the modern decor. Our waiter apparently recognized me but silly me embarrassingly did not recognize him. He was very accommodating though! We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza (mozzarella, EVOO, fig-infused balsamic). This was back then when I was a young college student and didn't know any better and had expensive taste and discovered that I was indeed, not a fan of prosciutto. Personal preference, but I'm sure a real prosciutto lover would love to delve into this pizza. Although, I did not have the greatest first experience here I wouldn't mind coming back and trying a different dish. They have got some fancy Italian cuisine here!"], ["Katie H.", "Came here with a large group a few days ago for their happy hour drinks and food, so I can't comment on the regular food. Although I don't have a whole lot of Blue Back happy hours under my belt, this was my favorite one so far. We each ordered a special cocktail on the happy hour menu and were pretty pleased with our drinks. I got a lemon drop martini, which was nice and strong. Overall, great selection of drinks, and the beers are decently priced too. \u00a0With our drinks happily settling in our bellies, we decided to order a bunch of happy hour bites to share. We got the bruschetta, grilled chicken wings, truffle fries, fried calamari, meatballs, Italian mac and cheese, and one of each of their three pizzas. Portions are small, so if you're here for a full meal, plan on ordering at least 3, maybe 2 if you're a light eater. The truffle fries were great--crispy and aromatic with what was likely truffle oil, though they were mysteriously missing the housemade ketchup it was said to come with. The fried calamari was also well-received. Tender, lightly fried, and with both marinara and aioli for dipping (which I appreciated, since most places just give marinara). The biggest surprise for me was the Italian mac and cheese. I'm not a huge fan of mac and cheese, but this was so creamy and flavorful, and the pasta still had the right amount of bite. That was my favorite, and my friends at the table were saying that's the one they always order as well. The meatballs were soft and flavorful, and both the margherita and prosciutto/arugula pizzas were enjoyed, despite their small size. The chicken wings were no better or worse than your average bar wings, and I didn't get to try the bruschetta.The service was fantastic. Both bartenders were friendly and fast, and our waiter was extremely polite and attentive. The prices are a little high for the portions of the food (most happy hour dishes are $5-6), but the quality was on point, and I would gladly come back for more happy hours."], ["kelly m.", "Indecision took hold looking at both the drink menu and the food menu. The server was very patient and helpful. Ordered the margarita and osso bucco and my friend ordered pinot noir and pasta. Everything was top notch."], ["Abby B.", "The food at Rizzuto's is excellent, but you never know what to expect when it comes to service. I've had excellent servers who go above and beyond, but I've also had bartenders roll their eyes and get an attitude for simple drink orders. I think they hate their own happy hour crowd... Love the patio. They seem to be well connected to local food and can certainly cook. Worth a try for sure."], ["Justin S.", "Steph was our waitress and she was amazing. Great food, excellent selection of wine and amazing customer service skills. Food was timed perfectly throughout our meal. A nice place to bring someone in a date, looking forward to my return."], ["Elena Z.", "Service in bar area is horrible. Totally quiet empty and the bar tender/waitress is seriously neglecting her tables. If it was crowded is get it- but it's not. I could go elsewhere...."], ["Chris F.", "Just came from Rizzuto's for lunch - had the lunch sized Cavatelli which as very tasty and good, \u00a0but was a little disappointed with the portion size for $14. It would be nice if there was a roll or piece of bread if you don't want to change the portion size. I also noticed stains on the ceiling tiles. I understand the Winter was very difficult this year for all of us but get those fixed or painted, it's almost May :-)I understand BlueBack Square can't be cheap for rent - but I was expecting a bit more in terms of value. The Cavatelli was great though, very nice and chicken was tender. Our waiter (Ian) was also super nice and attentive."], ["Audrey J.", "Came here for lunch after graduation, did not expect the place to be as empty as it was. But although there were barely three or four average-sized groups in the place the entire time we were there, the waier/waitresses still took their sweet little time. I don't usually get mad, just annoyed, but this place was genuinely frustrating. It took a ridiculous amount of time for our waitress to come after we were seated. And she left without even giving us a menu. She took forever to come back, at which point we had to ask for the menus to be given to us. Then she gave us both the lunch and dinner menus, which we figured out a good ten minutes later...and when we (confusedly) pointed out that we had two completely menus (unmarked whether one is lunch or dinner) the waitress brushed it off saying that \"the menus just get mixed up sometimes.\" um excuse me isn't it your job to keep them straight? Even the food took forever to come out. The calamari and jumbo shrimp appetizers were delectable, very much on point. The daily special pesto pine nut tomato pizza was decent. a bit soggy from all the oil, the crust was crisp and chewy. the daily special turkey burger was disappointing. it was a sad picture of bun, limp onions, and patty, and the side salad looked unwashed and stiff. the chicken cava-something (pesto cream) was pretty good, but it needed something fresh and crisp and spicy --- so basically kimchi."], ["Ashley N.", "Stopped in for a drink after eating at the Celebrate West Hartford festival. It was so nice walking into air conditioning after blazing in sun, though I'm not complaining...this has been the longest winter and that says a lot coming from a girl who grew up in Wisconsin! I had the summer shandy which they had on tap for about $6.25 (overpriced). The bartender was quiet but friendly...though we were watching some car race and my bf was clearly into it and she switched the channel to a baseball game. Now, that would have been fine if it was a game people were interested in, but no one was. I do look forward to coming back to their happy hour which seems to have gotten an upgrade. Their happy hour used to have a free buffet but from the looks of the chalkboard above the bar, they have changed that to a few items on special. From past experience, their pizza/flatbreads are pretty good but don't want to review too much on the food since I haven't eaten here in awhile. Update will be coming soon!"], ["Larry S.", "It official - we love coming here. We were so surprised to figure out it has been six months since we are hear last. \u00a0We tell friends al the time we like to sit at the bar, enjoy a glass of wine and have an appetizer ( hey, \u00a0shopping is hard work so we need sustenance!). What made it super was the same very nice, very efficient and very \u00a0customer focused bartender. We were glad to see \"S\" again. After a few minutes conversation she remembered us as we did her. Now the food, Loved the meatballs! Love the sauce! Tried the ArugulaSalad - great!! Bread choices were ok...did this change? Still good, especially when allowed to soak in the sauce ( ok thats decadent).We promise to back sooner than months - and we will bring friends. Meet you there mid Sunday afternoon. Quiet and pleasant."], ["Brigit C.", "My family and I visited Rizzuto's for the first time today (Mother's Day). \u00a0We wanted to try something new, and saw Rizzuto's has a very good [regular] brunch/lunch/dinner menu and has been given high praise. \u00a0We were seated and learned shortly after that we could only choose from the short Mother's Day [price fixed] brunch menu, which had about five meals and a long list of cocktails, or choose the buffet. \u00a0We scanned the menu and saw little selection, then scanned the buffet which had food that was picked over (despite that it was 11:30AM) and limited as well. \u00a0When I asked the waiter if we could order off the menu because a member of my family has a food allergy, he stated we could not.We decided to leave and went to a favorite restaurant instead. \u00a0Rizzuto's did not make it clear that patrons had to choose from meals on the Mother's Day [price fixed] brunch menu. \u00a0Other restaurants allow you the option to order off of the special price fixed menu or the regular menu. \u00a0If we did not have a restaurant that would accommodate us, the special day would have been ruined. \u00a0It should have been made clear by Rizzuto's that there was a limited menu, and the chefs/servers should have been more flexible.Though I am not pleased with the experience that I had today, I will hesitantly try Rizzuto's again--on a regular, non-special day--in hopes that I will have a better selection for a meal."], ["Paul F.", "Excellent foodAnd the service from all staff was very accommodating - even sweet. Highly recommended."], ["Adam L.", "Been a fan of this place for several years now. Often come around the holidays during holiday shopping with my wife. What brings us back time and again is the cheese and meat plate. Always above and beyond any in the area with locally sourced cheeses and exceptional meats. A few glasses of Italian wine and you don't need much else. Service was great tonight even though the were swamped as usual on a Friday night. Went for the Osso Bucco tonight with goat cheese polenta-light on the polenta which was nice as I did not leave stuffed and the veal was tasty along with saut\u00e9ed greens most likely kale. Wife had 40 clove chicken - yep there were 40 - still good. My daughter had the penne alla vodka with chicken and it was exceptional. Looking forward to the next visit - going deep on the cheese and meat platter for sure!"], ["M W.", "Came here for dinner with a group of 6 at around 8pm. We called ahead just to make sure we got seated. We ordered the muscles for an app, some of them were a little sandy, so the rest of the group didn't eat them but I did! I was in the mood for a carbonara but they don't offer it, so I was able to improvise. I ordered a pappardelle with Alfredo sauce, chicken and prosciutto, totally hit the spot!!! I love when a kitchen has the ability to be creative for a customer. All of our entrees were satisfying a bit pricey but had a great experience. Would come back again!"], ["Mandy N.", "Their lavender cosmo is the lavender drink all other lavender drinks aspire to be."], ["Cridick G.", "I have been here twice and I have not been disappointed. It is a great place to go for lunch or dinner if you are in the area. They have a decent selection of beer on tap and their ravioli was (insert positive adjective here).

I am looking forward to going back and trying more of what they have to offer."], ["Patrick D.", "Rizzuto's is severely underappreciated in trendy West Hartford, with its ADHD-like attention on whatever restaurants have opened in the past month or two. Somewhat quietly (if that's possible in Blue Back Square), it keeps putting out great food, drinks and dining experiences year after year. I've gone here several times, and it's only gotten better and better. It's a great atmosphere, too...very modern but warm. Looking forward to going back to check out their happy hour specials."], ["Janelle S.", "I stopped in to Rizzuto's with some friends for Happy Hour yesterday (Tuesday) and I was excited to check it out, since I saw so many tasty looking options on my last visit to Rizzuto's. There were still a few tables in the bar area when we arrived, so we huddled around a table. \u00a0We saw people who came in after us and found tables themselves in the bar area, get served drinks way before anyone even acknowledged us. \u00a0After another few minutes of sitting there with no service, we were able to flag someone down for help in ordering drinks. \u00a0After that, every time we needed something, we would once again have to flag someone down. \u00a0Maybe it was because we were a younger group of people, the staff felt that we wouldn't tip well or didn't belong there, but I did not like the vibe. \u00a0After sampling a few of the happy hour apps (which were on the small side - but reasonably priced), we decided that we were still hungry for dinner, so we migrated to a dinner table. \u00a0Unfortunately, the service did not improve in the dining area. \u00a0While we got our food in a timely manner, and it was on the tasty side, it took forever to get our bill and then pay our bill, because our waitress disappeared. \u00a0So, once again, this left us having to search around for someone to help us settle up so that we could leave. \u00a0This was very off-putting to me and I likely won't be back here anytime soon. \u00a0Not impressed at all."], ["Slash I.", "I have been a WH local for a long time and this place is one of my go-to's. Happy Hour is great, and the newer hh menus are delicous. Some of the items need to be added to the regular menu. Love the variety of cocktails and craft beers here, always something to choose from. Bar staff is excellent, always willing to suggest a new concoction they have going. I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to drinks, and this place really has it down. Service is great and bar manager Jen is always at the top of her game. Many happy hours under my belt around West Hartford, but the bar staff and selections make this place my go-to. If you haven't tried this place out yet, you are missing out. Have recommended it many times to personal friends, but felt that this would be a great way to recommend this place to those I don't know."], ["Marisha V.", "Overrated restaurant with hit or miss service. The food is just on par and the menu lacks creativity for dinner services. They have 1 hot meat app, and the rest were fish. The wood fired clams were the most creative that differed from the bruschetta or typical calamari. But, the menu described bacon and shallots with clams; instead, \u00a0it was overwhelmed with carrots and celery. We have been before during happy hour- which is clearly their bread and butter. I recommend going for happy hour- but, that's it."], ["Justin F.", "Good atmosphere, cool layout. \u00a0We really wanted this place to be great because of previous recommendations, but it was average at best. \u00a0The waitor let our drinks run empty (my biggest pet peave) and they messed up our appetizer. \u00a0The dinners were pretty good just a bit overpriced."], ["Rachel F.", "Great food, mediocre service. For me food and service are equally important. Unfortunately for this place, the food far surpasses the service.

Get the antipasto and the meatballs!!!"], ["John B.", "We love Rizzuto's. \u00a0The ambience is really good and our server last night, Henry, is awesome. \u00a0He's attentive and professional, and our 3-year-old daughter loved him. \u00a0Along with Jose they are two of the best servers in the Hartford area.My wife's pasta bolognese was perfect, my pasta with meatballs, sausage and mushrooms, made to order because I'm lactose intolerant, was awesome.The kids' menu is large and fairly-priced.This is one of our favorite places to hang out, either at the bar, which is large and fun, or at a table, and last night confimed it.Rizzuto's does it right."], ["Dan R.", "This review only applies to their amazing Happy Hour.Is $5 more than you would expect to pay for a draft beer or glass of wine in fashionable West Hartford? Nope, not at all. Well, let's sweeten the pot, how about $5 for that cocktail PLUS a fabulously free buffet. Hell, yes, Bubba!! Between 5:00 and 7:00 from Monday through Friday this is the amazing deal that you will find at Rizzuto's. \u00a0We arrived a teense before 5:00 on Monday, were served by a truly delightful young lady named Katie, and ordered two of the $5 beers. I couldn't resist trying a Naughty Nurse - it was reddish and reminded me a lot of Killian's -very good indeed. The free buffet included vegetarian egg rolls, \u00a0pickled vegetables, broccoli in a blue cheese sauce, cole slaw, roast potatoes drizzled with cheese, a pasta salad, an antipasto plate with salami, olives, and hot peppers, and a nice green salad, FOR FREE !!We've been to Rizzutos a few times for dinner, but this was our first stab at the Happy Hour. It really was a terrific deal. The bar is gorgeous and spacious- not too crowded on a Monday. Katie told us that as the week moves on toward Thursday and Friday, the food gets a lot better (how about freebie pizza?) but the bar predictably fills up a lot earlier, sometimes would be Happy Hour participants are stalking for empty seats at 4:30. We had a fabulous time and plan on reprising the evening in the near future."], ["Susan P.", "Enjoyed a good meal on a Saturday night. Made reservations through open table for 7:15. Was initially seated at a booth by windows, was asked to move shortly thereafter as someone reserved that exact table? Strange. Service was good. Fried calamari and bruschetta appetizers. Entrees were pappardelle and linguine with clam sauce. Both were tasty. My daughter ordered a cocktail which the waiter forgot to get after he gave us a 3 minute spiel how great the pink lemonade drink was. He indicated it would be free of charge, but failed to have it removed from the bill. Restaurant was noisy and lively, hard to have a conversation."], ["Eva B.", "We come here a lot and it's always hit or miss. Meat and cheese plate is always great. The wine list and cocktails are also very good. The simple pasta dishes and pizzas are tasty and well prepared. However, more complex dishes are below average. Osso bucco should be tender enough to eat with a fork but I found it to be tough and dry. Some of the pasta sauces are much too oily leaving an oil slick at the bottom of your dish. Meats and fish tend to be either undercooked or overcooked. Difficult for the chef to get it \"medium.\" That said stick to simple dishes - salads, meat & cheese plate, pizzas and you can't go wrong. The waitstaff is always friendly and efficient. I would give them 5 stars!"], ["Patrick G.", "Great meat and cheese!"], ["Sandilynn K.", "What a surprise! The patio is busy on a beautiful sunny day and one server is getting his butt kicked. The meat and cheese plate was good, we first got delivered the wrong selection as it was mixed up with another tables, which was realized about 2 mins after I started eating the olives, which I told them, so hopefully they got rid of them though I feel they should have left the Olives if they were going to toss them anyway. The minestrone was cold, which grossed me out so it was sent back. The Caesar salad was good, I ordered it with shrimp which to did not come out with,so I guess they didn't want my $11. Margherita pizza was good as well, thought the crust was under salted, and the edge was burnt. If I want burnt pizza, I'll go to New Haven, thank you. Our server was nice, but clearly not concerned with us since we weren't complaining to a manager. It was a little frustrating to wait so long for our main meal and then sit there for several minutes with dirty plates in front of us, while the management fawned over one table who complained about getting the wrong cheese plate 2 times. After I sit looking at dirty plates for 20 mins or so, no, server, I don't want a dessert menu after the table sitting less time then is already has coffees and a dessert menu in front of them. Everyone deserves equal attention high maintenance or not. I guess I need to be a jerk to get good service, who knew?"], ["Rosemary M.", "I was actually pretty disappointed. I came for happy hour where you buy a drink and have a free \"buffet\". However the buffet consisted of 4 plates of food that was not heated and just sitting out there. There was a pasta dish, cheeseburgers, and potato salad. I then ordered from the menu. The bruschetta was pretty good and the arugula salad was delicious . However my ravioli was horrible ! It was a huge flat noodle with a tiny tiny center stuffed with barely anything ! Super salty and oily as well. Super disappointed, especially since I paid $20 for it! My roommate ordered the sweet \u00a0potato tortellini and it was nothing special . Our waiter Henry was nice and attentive . The dark chocolate s'mores dessert was good but the portion was small . The cranberry orange margarita was great and the only reason for the 2 star. I do not think I will be coming here again ."], ["Steven T.", "Monifa and I walked into Rizzuto's restaurant this past Saturday for a sweet dinner. \u00a0We were welcomed with a smile and no wait list. \u00a0It was fantastic! I must say that the service, food and experience was a delight and on point. We shared a starter salad with presunto (prosciutto), arugula, artichokes and shaved grana padeno. \u00a0Along with the salad we had the mussels steamed in tomato. \u00a0We agreed that the salad was just ok, but the appetizer of mussels was large and in charge....we loved it! \u00a0It felt like a meal in itself. \u00a0 My entree was the Funghi pizza. \u00a0This had mushrooms, garlic, pancetta, arugula, evoo and I had chicken added to the mix. \u00a0At an additional cost of $2.00 I opted for the whole wheat bread crust. \u00a0This was perfect because I was craving pizza all night. \u00a0It was cooked perfectly and the crust was crisp. \u00a0I would have this again and again. \u00a0Monifa had the Veal piccata. \u00a0It had a lovely presentation and she said it was flavorful and fresh. \u00a0Her meal came \u00a0with a side of tomato pasta. \u00a0I'm not much of a pasta fan, but I was tempted to snag some. We didn't have the best seat in the place, but you know what...it was alright. \u00a0The place was clean, respectable and the atmosphere was comfortable. \u00a0Come down for a drink and enjoy the West Hartford center.Con: Parking is not free.
