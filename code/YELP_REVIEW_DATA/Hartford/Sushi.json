I really liked mine minus the tofu (I hate tofu!) and chopped peanuts (the smell can give my husband a reaction!) on the top. Nowhere did it indicate these items would be part of my meal and were NOT on the menu! I expected noodles with steak period! My husband has a peanut allergy! It was a chilly night and I wanted a cup of coffee. \"No coffee.\" Ok, maybe tea. \"We only serve green tea.\" Really? No other tea choices? \"No.\" Very disappointed! We live in New England! My husband also ordered sushi which he said was pretty good. We looked at the \"happy hour\" menu and the beer selections were not impressive or remarkable. Not a draw for happy hour for us and our friends. The service was good, the staff was friendly and the decor is really nice.

The soup wasn't too salty- it had a nice depth of flavor. The side dishes that came with the soup were also all delicious and complemented the broth well. My favorite was the slice of tofu in the sweet and savory soy sauce. Browsing the menu, there seems to be a great variety!

I loved it so much, the raw fish blended well with the vegetables. Who knew sashimi bibambap could taste so darn good? My eyes got a little taste too. The different colors from the sashimi and the veggies was alluring and increased my appetite when my bowl was brought out. Not only was it good but pretty healthy as well. Everyone around me was surprised as to how I could handle so much rawness at once but when you love something so much, you eat it all and accept the risk of salmonella poisoning...which I did NOT get!!

Very fresh and taste so delicious! it's a good mix of Japanese and Korean food"], ["Angie N.", "I went here for the first time for lunch last Wednesday when I got out of work early due to a snowstorm. My friend and I were both craving sushi and wanted to go somewhere close by. The parking lot in front of the restaurant was pretty small, but that certainly wasn't a problem for us, since when we first got there, there was only one other car. It's possible that there's more parking, but it was hard to tell with all of the snow. There is street parking available, though, so I'd imagine it's not too much of a problem even during busier times.The restaurant has a sushi bar as well as booths. We sat in a booth and immediately ordered edamame as an appetizer. It came out quickly, was well-prepared, and also came with a few slices of sweet red bell peppers, which was a nice addition. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by the lunch menu deals. I know really well-priced options at lunch time are pretty standard, but I don't go out for lunch during the week all that often, so it was a nice surprise. My friend and I both ordered from the Lunch Special Sushi Bar Menu, which offers a variety of sushi/sashimi choices currently ranging in price from $8.50 to $14.95 and includes either miso soup or salad. We both ordered the salads, which were a little heavy on the ginger dressing. I did notice another reviewer mention that as well. We both ordered option C of the Maki Lunch Combo ($9.50 at this time), which comes with a California Roll, Eel Cucumber Roll, and Salmon Roll. My friend goes out for sushi a lot more often than I do and was happily surprised to see eel on the lunch special menu, as she said most sushi restaurants she's been to don't include eel with their lower-priced specials. I loved the sauce on the Eel Cucumber Roll. I do wish they had put a little more on, but that was definitely my favorite. All of the sushi tasted fresh and I ended up taking half of the order home for dinner (there were 22 pieces total - 8 in the Eel Cucumber Roll, 8 in the California Roll, and 6 in the salmon roll, which is why I was so impressed with the deal. I can't remember the last time I got 22 pieces of sushi for $9.50!).For those who care, they do have a few TV's throughout the restaurant. That's never something all that important to me, but it could be a nice distraction for kids or nice if you're interested in watching a game (assuming they take requests for changing channels).I would definitely visit this place again. I'd be interested in seeing what it's like on a busier day or at a busier time, but would also just be fine with ordering lunch again."], ["Lucy L.", "Haven't been here for so long and a sense of nostalgia prompted me to write this review.

The Jam Pong soup is tasty and helps clear up any sickness. If I was just rating their Korean dishes, I would give 4 stars. \u00a0 The remaining dishes range from 3 to 4 stars. \u00a0The noodle dishes and sushi rolls are quite good, but not consistently. \u00a0These dishes are a bit pricey for inconsistent quality. \u00a0The service is also spotty; you have to wait forever sometimes.

Good customer service, the server is always incredibly attentive. Their Chinese food isn't as good as their Japanese food, even though they're Chinese I believe. But their dinner special is a good deal; you get three things for the price of one. However, they taste very \"Americanized\" to me. The place is warm and clean, good place for a nice gathering. Dessert is complimentary with fried ice cream, which is always a plus. I only wish that their Chinese food has better quality.

I'm from New York, so maybe it's different... but usually when you order one order of sushi, it comes with two pieces.

So, in hopes of satisfying my sushi cravings, I was left with just four little pieces of sushi that cost me over $15. So disappointed!!! The only plus about the sushi was that the sea urchin sushi was great. It was really fresh!I ordered the chicken hibachi dinner. It came with soup, salad, noodles, rice, and vegetables. I was not particularly impressed. It's something I can easily forget about. The noodles were soggy and bland. The rice was too hard. And the chicken was overcooked.

The Groupon they made did not note that it couldn't not be used with Happy Hour, nor did it day it could not be combined with other offers. However, my one star rating comes from the way the restaurant dealt with this conflict. The wait staff and manager were unprofessional in their methods. We pointed out the Groupon flaw and the manager just stormed off. He left us at the table two hours without telling us if he would honor the Groupon or not. They mostly stood from afar staring at us until we gave in and paid the full bill.

This meant service was super fast and that was fine with us. The awesome thing about happy hour is $2.50 Sapporos and Kirin bottles (plus some others) and $1 bowls of miso soup! I thoguht the miso soup here was pretty great, a little on the salty side, but i happen to really like mine that was. Had a good amount of tofu, seaweed and scallions. The pork Gyoza appetizer was also good and came out piping hot ($4). After the apps, i tried the spicy salmon crunch roll and the Philadelphia roll. Both were good, and the fish tasted fresh. The salmon crunch roll still had some \"crunch\"...sometimes you get a place which obviously makes the filling beforehand and the crunch has turned not-so-crunchy. Each roll was a good size, nothing to rave about, but definitely solid sushi ($4 each).I would like to try their hibachi one day and live close so will probably go back.

I mentioned that the service is usually good. For example, a while back I had someone named Dan who I still remember, because he was fantastic. Last time I dined in, \u00a0it wasn't so great. \u00a0We were seated quickly, \u00a0but then the waitress kept forgetting about us. \u00a0It took a long time to get drinks. \u00a0We never got utensils - I ended up grabbing some from a nearby empty table. I know it was busy, \u00a0and there were larger parties there, \u00a0but we felt a little neglected. \u00a0The waitress also seemed annoyed when i told her i had a yelp deal i had purchased ($10 for $20). She took my cell phone with her into the back room to check on it, \u00a0which was weird for me. \u00a0We hadn't had great service, \u00a0so I decided to tip accordingly, slightly over 11% on the original total, \u00a0before the yelp deal was applied. The waitress saw the amount and got upset, \u00a0and came back with the receipt to make sure I knew that i should tip on the entire amount, \u00a0not the amount after the yelp deal was applied. She rudely put the receipt in front of me and handed me a pen and stared at me until I changed the amount to 20% of the original total. \u00a0Now, \u00a0I'm typically a good tipper. My general rule is 20%, and if the service is great I do more. \u00a0While an 11-12% tip is low for me, and I'd never tip below 10% regardless of service, \u00a0I felt that my tip accurately reflected my dining experience that night, and the amount of effort/care she'd given us. \u00a0I thought that it was rude for the waitress to push me to change it the way that she did. \u00a0I haven't been back to dine in, but the sushi rolls are so good that I do still get takeout fairly \u00a0regularly. \u00a0Also, \u00a0as I said, \u00a0the service is normally great, \u00a0and this was an exception."], ["Stephen T.", "In a situation like last night where the weather breaks...everyone headed to west hartford!

There is a soda machine, or cooler case with bottles.What really gets me is the good prices and the convenience, which is probably what they were going for. Two rolls for $8.95? At Feng quality?

It's my favorite restaurant in Manchester CT and I come here all the time. Everything I've ordered has been delicious (and better yet - brought to the table fairly quickly). The ambience is fancy without making people who are more casual feel awkward. And best of all, during all the ones I've been to the resultant I've not had any bad food or service. So yeah - I love this place.Wasabi's cooked meals like the Yaki Soba or Yaki Udon are fantastic. The noodles aren't overly greasy and the flavor is wow. The sushi is perfect too, especially their eel rolls. I've had sushi in a lot of places and none of them hold a candle to this place. The sushi is full of flavor and tastes fresh. Wasabi has enough options too that you won't get bored if you want to venture out every one in a while. As far as the restaurant goes, the atmosphere is beautiful. As other reviewers will say the lighting adds drama and there is something pretty to look at in every direction. It's very clean too. In the 10-ish times I've gone, Wasabi's was spotless including the bathrooms. It feels like an upscale lounge but the prices are reasonable. So win. Actually, If you go around dinner time and do the dining area, it's a good place for a date or night out with the girls."], ["Jeff L.", "First time visit and it will probably be our last. There was nothing special about Wasabi. The sushi was good, although the basic rolls were smaller portions than I'm used to (6 pieces vs 8 pieces). The cocktails were not very good.

It did not taste anything like a Mai Tai and was not very delicious at all. \u00a0Her mango martini was better but nothing special.All in all, I think there are better sushi places around, like Sakura Garden in Glastonbury, with great drinks, great service, and similar prices."], ["Bob D.", "This place is really good!

As for the actual restaurant and staff, they are both beautiful. My friend and I ordered sushi to go and everyone in the restaurant was friendly and the service was quick and on point. Bonus for having the waiting area staged in front of the water feature. My friend ordered tempura chicken and veggies, and I ordered a ginger salad, the avocado, asparagus, and cucumber roll (AAC), the avocado cucumber roll, and the sweet potato tempura roll. My friend said her tempura meal was perfectly delicious. My salad was the typical mostly-iceberg vehicle for ginger dressing, and the ginger dressing was forgettable at best. The sweet potato roll was good and on par for what is expected from this kind of roll. The AAC and avocado cucumber roll, however, were horrendous. I'm not sure if it was just because the avocado was severely under-ripe and hard, or if it was something else in the flavor profile throwing me off. I am not very fussy about my sushi as it is difficult to mess up raw veggies and rice, but they somehow managed to do that to the point that I couldn't eat more than two pieces and threw the rest away. Super disappointing. I want to work up the courage to give Wasabi another try, but it was so expensive compared to other places in the area that I just have not been able to justify doing so yet.

When we asked where was the short rib and the marscarpone cheese, the waiter said \"oh we don't have that any more but it's only $6!\" like we should just be happy and not be upset that they didn't update their menu or tell us when we ordered it that it was just a plain scallion pancake. The Peking duck spring rolls had only a few tiny flecks of duck and no promised \" shoestring sweet potatoes.\" We sent both appetizers back, shared one very mediocre \"Special\" chef's sushi roll, asked for our check and left.Might be OK for just sushi and cocktails but you can get better, more reasonably priced sushi elsewhere.

The restuarant itself offers great decor. The bar is dimly lit with a great stone wall, high top tables, and a couple booths. Asian influsences are found throughout and the bathrooms (not that this matters) are gorgeous. Now, the food. First off, I will start by saying that it IS a bit pricey unless you go from 4-6 during happy hour or 10pm-12pm for \"late night.\" Expect to be paying between $16-20 for any sort of specialty roll, or $6-$8 for regular rolls. That being said, the specialty rolls are creative, large, and very tastey. They usually include 4 or more items within the roll, a special sauce, and lots of good quality fish. They do not skimp on the high end ingredients. There's anything from eel, to mango, to lobster. The presentation is also quite nice. If youre not a fan of sushi, they also have a good menu selection (Pad Thai, cooked seafood, steaks). The bento boxes at lunch are served with soup or salad and come with quite a bit of food (california roll, shumai, your choice of meat or sushi, and rice) for just under $10. If youre looking to splurge at dinner, I would suggest the Kobe beef. You order raw Kobe, sliced thin, and cook it at your table on a very ot stone. Not only is it a fun experience, but the beef is outrageous. It melts in your mouth. It's priced by the ounce and i believe its a minimum of 2 ounces, but it's well worth it for a special occastion, or just because.The full bar makes great cocktails, the lechee martini is always a winner. The only other advice I have is that if you order take-out, make sure to check your order when you pick it up. The place can get really busy and they have managed to forget a roll, or swich things around on more than one occasion."], ["Sarah L.", "We had a delicious meal, the atmosphere was very pleasant.

I've eaten at the bar, eaten in the main restaurant, and had appetizers at the bar then moved into the restaurant for dinner. Here is my review.First, it's worth mentioning that Feng is not cheap. If you just want a casual night out, and / or you're not really a fan of sushi, then you'd probably do better at another restaurant. The reason you go to Feng is for their excellent service and their excellent sushi. This is about quality, not quantity. So those who adore sushi will be in for a treat. Those who just want to hang out at the bar while they nibble something might find the prices a bit high.The sushi is absolutely phenomenal. I've thought that afresh each time I go here. I've gone with different people over my various visits and they all adore the food here as well. I like sashimi which is raw fish with nothing else. No rice, no dressing, no nothing. So the fish has to be top notch for it to be tasty. I've always loved the sashimi here. I also eat rolls, soups, salads, appetizers, and all shine.What is even more amazing to me is that even when I eat in the bar the service is top notch. In many places if you eat in the bar you're only mildly paid attention to, and the servers are often busy with other things. Here, it feels as if you get the same high quality experience in the bar as in the main dining area. The staff is polite, attentive, and always watching out for you.There's a parking lot right across the street, and also on-street parking. All cost money. So again, this isn't a cheap night out. But to me it's absolutely worth it.Is there a down side? I suppose if you're looking for large buffet-style servings or looking to save some money, this isn't the spot for you :). They definitely are on the high end side here. But again, that's why I go there. I have other places I go for a cheap, casual night out. When I want to treat myself, and have some of the best sushi I can savor, Feng is it.Well recommended."], ["Mayra V.", "I can honestly say I was impressed with the quick response from the general manager of Feng's when I received an email the day after I posted my initial review.

The general manager was also on site and was able to come and personally apologize for my previous experience.

I like the spin on the dumpling.. it was Lemongrass but Ive had better, fatter dumplings and they were pretty greasy. The Angry Dragon Roll.. great presentation but very little flavor. This can't be the best Hartford has to offer can it? If so, I hate to say the SW kicks East Coast ass in sushi. How can that be?ok came back the next week and they weren't offering the lemongrass dumplings. wtf? Tries the Di Sun and that WAS good. The edamame.. Ive had better.

Among a group of 6 of us we had a few wooden baskets of Edamame with rock salt sprinkled onto it. I thought everything was good, especially dabbling off of my friends plate of sushi.

Another great thing about this place is it's BYOB!!! We ordered miso soup and Kani crab salad to start, they were both delicious. The Kani crab salad had a lot of crunch and was on the spicer side, the best I have had to date. We also got a spicy crab roll, spicy yellowtail roll, and a Philadelphia roll...

The service was top-notch, as our waitress was very patient and friendly with our large group and questions, including splitting the check.

Everything I had was exceptional. The soup was superb- surprisingly flavorful for such a simple soup. The Thai Iced Tea was mixed perfectly, with a greater emphasis placed on the tea and less on the sweet. The edamame was cooked flawlessly in the pod, with no other ingredients added so you got only the bean flavor. Finally, the sushi roll was magnificent. Everything was made fresh and delicious.

I also got a salmon roll and pumpkin tempura roll. My boyfriend is not a fan of sushi, so he got the Chicken Teriyaki.

Well, my inner fat kid on Sundays when they have all you can eat. What a hot new place in Glastonbury. It is in an ordinary plaza but the inside looks nice enough for a lovely date night. Its got some funky/cool decor. As for the food, I couldn't believe the quality and deliciousness of the food for only $22. (on top of BYOB with no corking fee?!). The all you can eat menu is very expansive in terms of their kitchen items (udon noodle, rice, tempura, teriyaki) to their sushi menu (sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, specialty rolls). You get two lists and check off how many of each you want and they are made fresh. For us (group of 5 with very large order) the food came out on a rolling basis. Some highlights: 1) Moneybag. I had no idea what it was but liked the name. Turned out it was wonton wrap filled with delicious crab all deep fried. Flavor explosion. 2) Pepper salmon. Just melt in your mouth. 3) Fried banana. Not tempura but panko crust. Super crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. 4) Pearl River Roll. Really savory unique specialty roll. 5) AAC hand roll. Fresh Avocado, asparagus, and cucumber. Perfect compliment to the more savory rolls. The only reason for not giving all 5 stars is that the food came on a rolling basis in a seemingly random manner. However, I don't know how random it was. We somehow got a lot of \"extra\" stuff, meaning, for example, two of the money bags when we ordered only one. Then, we had to keep asking for the sashimi, probably at least 5 times before we got it all the way at the end when it was clear that we were getting very full, even though sashimi was one of the first things we ordered. So, it sort of seemed like they were holding off more expensive items and trying to get us full on cheaper items. Purely speculative (though quite annoying). In any event, the wait staff was extremely pleasant. On another note, green tea is $1 and free refills. No big deal but just an FYI since some places give tea for free. Anyways, I'll be back.

Our waitress brought over a bucket to chill our sake and poured it for us, while explaining which types of sake are served chilled versus warm. We had an order of edamame as an appetizer, good. My friend ordered a seaweed salad and I tried a bite, that was also good (I've never really had bad edamame or seaweed salad at a sushi restaurant, luckily). I ordered the Mango Tango roll as my main course- eel, asparagus, and avocado inside, wrapped with fresh mango. Delicious, beautifully prepared, and refreshing. Everything tastes fresh. I also tried my friend's Lobster Dynamite roll (Maine lobster, avocado, and mango inside, topped with spicy tuna and sweet chili sauce)- it was so flavorful. The music was a little inappropriate at first (think unedited versions of music that would offend a number of people), but I don't think the staff realized it. Other diners asked for them to change it and they complied immediately, so I wouldn't hold that against them. I do hope they'll be more aware next time, but if not, they were sure to change it quickly upon request.For three of us, the bill came to $67, and they gave us a $10 gift card to use next time.

The mango summer roll is tuna with avocado and a slice of mango, wrapped in rice paper, garnished with some sprouts and situated in a tangy mango sauce.

Inside is nice. Japanese music (Pop/rap) was on. If you watch anime, you'll probably recognize a few songs. BYOB is nice. I noticed that many people were ordering non sushi/sashimi items. They looked really good. Maybe we should have ordered those instead.I was not impressed but that doesn't mean it's bad. Maybe I happened to visit on one of bad days??"], ["Kevin D.", "so decided to try this place again, mainly because their menu intrigued me and it did look like tasty food. got a couple specialty rolls, a dynamite roll and a rainbow roll.it actually was pretty tasty! the fish was fresh and prepared well, their spicy mayo had a nice kick to it, rice was slightly tart which is what I really enjoy in sushi rice. rolls themselves were good size, even had some seaweed salad which was good but not everyone's bag of teaoverall not bad for sushi. if your looking for raw fish you can't go wrong here. staff is still a little green, so they might seem a bit scattered but they are friendly and helpful."], ["Smith K.", "I went to this Japanese restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday. \u00a0The ambiance was retro...New York City style vibe...excellent lightning. \u00a0Most importantly, the food was amazing and the service was on point. \u00a0We will return again for other celebratory events!!!

Roll and drink happy hours (like Ginza) or a Rock n Roll sushi night with a DJ, disco ball, special rolls,etc.... would draw people and make the place stand out from the rest.

I bought a Groupon for this new place, a rival for Sakura and Min Guang. It is the former Ktchen place. Anyway, we brought a bottle of wine since it is a BYOB place without corsage fee. It is one of the few places I know with fee. That is a plus. We had to wait a couple of minutes before we were seated. We had a booth seat away from the entry. I ordered seafood noodle soup. I was disappointed with it. According to the menu, I had a choice of udon or soba for the noodle. I asked for soba as my noodles. What did I get? I got egg noodles like the kind for wonton noodles. I know that because I'm Asian and know the difference between egg noodles, soba and udon. With that price, I expected more than 2 slices of scallops, 2 slices of imitation fish cakes, a couple strands of imitation crabs meat, and 3 medium sized shrimps. Worst of all \u00a0the soup had NO seafood base. Maybe vegetable soup and two lettuce leaves as vegetables. They could have done better to have bak choy leaves instead. The salad was fresh for me and decent ginger dressing in it. My husband had filet mignon hibachi. It was cooked right and the two seasons were okay. However, the fried rice was too salty. They were heavy handed with soy or salt. The vegetables were acceptable. My husband had clear soup and salad with his dinner. The plate he had was not warm so his food was cooled when he was halfway eating. The ambiance of the place is good if we stayed away from the big screen. We would give it a try again but I would not order the noodle soup again. I always believe that if a dish is placed on the menu, it should be up to par for Asians and others. It is the quality that counts, not the quantity on the menu offered. So, I hope the owner would consider making improvements on the dishes rather than concentrate on sushis, tempura, and sashimi."], ["K R.", "Great experience!!

If they chop up nd blend the tuna and the sause rather than just put sause on the tuna and roll it up makes a difference. This place does the latter of the two. Although spicy, it was nothing to go out of your way for. The ambience leaves much to be desired, it's just a long narrow room. The edemame wasn't salted properly.

I am particularly fond of the thai spicy roll. Great combo with the jalapeno and cilantro sauce. Teriyaki chicken was delicious from the entree section."], ["Rob M.", "Being a Saturday night we called ahead and were told we'd definitely need reservations for the hibachi. Not so much for the dining room. I guess we needed reservations just so they'd know how many chefs to have on hand, because we were the only ones in the place. Three people. But the chef still put on a good show for us, and the food was very good. Meanwhile the dining room, which was not supposed to be busy, filled up. Go figure.This location has housed many restaurants and bars over the years but Edo Ichi is definitely the nicest. They've done a beautiful job with the decor and there are plenty of hibachis for even large parties. There is even a nice outdoor patio for happy hours and summer al fresco sushi. I did find the hibachi menu to be limited -- all sorts of combinations of chicken, salmon, shrimp, filet and even lobster tail -- but there is only so much you can grill this way. It all starts with some miso soup and a salad while the chef entertains, blasts some sake into your mouth from three feet away, and prepares heaping portions of fried rice and noodles/lo mein. Fun! Hint: no need to order shrimp as your entree because Chef prepares some, plus wonderful grilled veggies, along with your order. If you're not into hibachi the sushi menu looks absolutely fantastic (and you can order off of it even if you're sitting at the hibachi with other people). Some unique offerings I haven't seen at other sushi places. Unfortunately we didn't get to try any but I will make it a point to come back. It all looked sooooo good! The usual bento boxes and tempura is on the menu as well, including steaks and lobster tails prepared in the kitchen if you choose to sit in the dining room. After the meal (while we waited an interminably long time for our check), we were served a nice plate of watermelon slices and orange wedges. My only complaint, and the reason I'm only giving four stars, is with the service. Despite the place being very quiet, and our hibachi chef being entertaining and attentive, our server disappeared for long periods at a time. Then she'd show up several times in a short span to ask if we wanted more drinks or to clear plates. Then she'd disappear again. After an already long wait for the check we literally had to track her down just to hand her our credit card. That's just not acceptable in any restaurant. Also, the speciality drinks ordered by my wife and her friend were suspiciously non-alcoholic tasting. Sugary sweet, but not much bang for the buck. At $8+ a pop, that's too bad. I ordered a large Sapporo (beer) which came in a 22oz can, overpriced at $7.50 (two 12oz bottles provide a couple ounces more for roughly the same price), but it was ice cold and tasted great along with the grilled stuff. Oh, and the tv in the hibachi room, showing cooking programs, was a bit out of place in such an otherwise nice restaurant.Overall, despite the problems just trying to leave the place, I give Edo Ichi thumbs up. I know service can be sporadic, and maybe we hit it when the stars weren't aligned. I'm looking forward to a return trip to try out the awesome looking sushi menu."], ["HonestAbe R.", "Sushi was okay, I had spider roll and soft shell crab roll.

Best way to access the restaurant is by taking Beaver Road off of Silas Deane. It's a one way, by the way! It is a quaint little spot however, there is a decent size parking lot in the back. I can't wait for warmer weather to come here and eat outside on the patio. Looks divine. We were promptly seated in the back dining room which was filled with some interesting decor. Exposed pipes and wood give this little spot some serious points in my book. Eclectic meets swanky meets comfy casual. Our waitress was exceedingly, over the top nice. We ordered the Shumai, Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Crab Roll and Spicy Scallop Roll. Once our food arrived, the presentation was beautiful. I almost didnt want to touch my food because it looked like a Matisse from the MOMA. But alas, I had to dig in. My boyfriend went crazy for the Spicy Tuna - he said it was \"killer\" and some of the best sushi he has had. My Crab Roll and Scallop Rolls were INSANE. The crab roll which is cooked, is an explosion of texture and flavor when you take a bite. Everything was fresh and delicious. This place vs Feng? You have your work cut out, Feng. So many people hype up Feng (I should know. I am one of them) but I will tell you. This place is small yet exquisite. Friendly and suggestive without being pushy. Service is impeccable and quick. On a completely different note: I like to take a small bit of Wasabi and add it to my soy sauce. The Wasabi at Edo Ichi is mindblowing. Sweet almost. It's a dry heat that is sweet but doesn't linger. I found myself continually adding it (and eating it) to my food. Not dry and crumbly that you get at some places but fresh and delicate. I can't wait to come back. I miss this place already.

Just lovely."], ["Ryan H.", "Went back again last night, and once again John and company did not disappoint!

Big indoor space, bar, and outside patio. The Silas Dean entrance is deceiving. This restaurant is a hidden gem."], ["Amy G.", "Once again, five stars on a second visit. I came here with a girlfriend to get caught up after the holidays. We ordered the beef negimaki appetizer and I had a chilled sake. A little surprise dish appeared on our table from the sushi bar and wow! They call it an \"avocado dumpling\" and it's really good--spicy crab, some kind of really yummy sauce, and avocado, very tasty blend of flavors. I've never had anything quite like it. \u00a0I don't think this is featured on the menu but I plan to ask for it next time I am here. The plump beef negimaki was probably the best I've ever had as it tastes as if they are using thinly-sliced filet mignon for the beef--supremely tender pieces of beef wrapped around crunchy green onions with a glaze similar to teriayaki but less salty than at many places. The gf and I both ordered off the hibachi menu. I like the simple good flavors of hibachi items, but don't much care for the tableside schtick, so it's really great to be able to order those items at a regular seating. (It's also great that there is a separate room for hibachi parties, and then the quieter room that we were in. We chose salmon, filet mignon, and chicken, all really delicious. It's a ton of food, too, starting with a small green salad with a light dressing, miso soup, and then the entree comes with two hibachi shrimp as an extra, fluffy fried rice, veggies AND noodles. We took a bunch of food home, and it's even better the next day, Side note: I've had tea there while waiting for to-go orders, and they have that amazing \"roasted rice\" tea that is really nice. It actually has roasted rice in with the tea leaves.There was a large table next to us of some ladies who seem to be regulars. They were really enjoying the platters of sushi being brought out, along with huge \"scorpion bowl\" drinks. Everyone kind of gets into the spirit of the thing and the ladies even offered me a sample of the beverage. Good vibe and good folks. Now that I've sampled a few things off the non-sushi menu, next time I am going to go all sushi and check that out--and maybe take another crack at that avocado dumpling."], ["Bra M.", "Excellent service and the food is outstanding! The sushi is fresh and the portions are big. Quality is important to us, and they delivered. Price is reasonable. Will recommend to friends and family."], ["Elizabeth B.", "The food is great, the service... odd. I came directly from a business meeting, with a long drive in front of me. When I walked in on a Monday night, the place was completely empty. I mean, I was the only customer in the place at 7 pm. Over the next 30 minutes, only three other customers walked in the door, and they were a weird lot to say the least. At least one of them had never eaten sushi before. As a side note, I ordered a la carte, which was probably a mistake, since it ended up being as expensive as the combo meal with much less quantity. I ordered probably within five minutes, which was fine, but the hot food arrived before the sushi - I thought that was pretty strange, considering that there is no cooking involved for sushi. I actually finished the hot course before the sushi course came. When the sushi course did finally arrive, I realized what had happened - the plate was beautifully decorated with handcarved vegetables. I appreciated the effort, but it did take some waiting.It took a while to get the check - I was not there for very long, so maybe they didn't want to rush me, but I was in a hurry for my long drive home. all in all, the food was very good, but the atmosphere was very strange."], ["Miss R.", "Edoichi's sushi is beyond fresh and incredible, and this comes from a self-professed sushi snob.

The staff is very friendly and hardworking. The Hibachi is the best around. \u00a0The food is always fresh. We love the crazy tuna, lovers and many other chef special roles. We had a fresh scallop one night at the bar and it was out of this world. Nothing we've ordered has been anything less than great. We eat in and take out. Our kids love it, but they really add to the cost so sometimes we put them to bed and order out and hide all the evidence so they don't find it in the morning. We were caught last week so we had it 2 nights in a row. \u00a0Not complaining. Their noodles are very good and we love the miso or broth soups.

The restaurant was very clean and very presentable. The menu was easy to follow and had pictures of most of the menu items which made it really easy to order. I was worried from other reviews about the service but it was really good. Our waters were refilled quickly and the waitress and manager both came over regularly to see how we were doing.

On a lark I decided to stop in for lunch and was surprised to find an actual sit down restaurant behind the heavy wooden doors. They offer both a Korean barbeque menu and a Japanese menu with sushi and sashimi options. On my first visit I ordered from the Korean menu. The food was good, or rather I should say that my palette is not developed enough with respect to Korean food to know the difference.The menu is quite extensive so I plan to visit again to explore more of the Korean menu. On my next visit I ordered from the Japanese side. Now good sushi/sashimi I definitely know, and the fish was fresh but of average quality.

It's very nice and modern-looking inside (although outside, you'd never guess it!). And they give you a ton of banchan with you meal! My only gripe is that the kimchi sides are so small. However, they will usually refill if you ask nicely. :) Just like in NYC! It's comparable to prices in NYC. I haven't yet had the bbq, but the stews and bimbimbap are wonderful! Also the sushi rolls! It's a nice stop if you want something different and are near the Westfarms Mall."], ["Rosanna M.", "I went with my family as we heard all the hype about Seoul BBQ and Sushi. Our first visit was obviously for the BBQ, eventually, I want to try their sushi. We went around lunchtime and were greeted and seated promptly. It was pretty dead when we went, but it was very early in the day. We were served tea and asked if we could also have water, which came a lot later (more on that below). We decided to get the 2 combos, the marinated beef and pork, to share among three people. With the unlimited side dishes, it was more than enough for all of us. Some of the side dishes we liked, some not so much. It depends on individual taste. My favorite was the pork, but the beef was fantastic also. Halfway through, one of the servers came to change our grill grate for a new one. We really liked that. Service was good, but at times we were confused as to who was serving us. We had three people check on us throughout. One of the reasons why our water took forever to come to our table because we asked one person who we thought was our main server. We finally figured out who our main server was and got the water promptly after we asked him. Some lack of communication there but other than that nothing to get all hyped up about. I would definitely come again and try their sushi and other dishes that they have. It's a bit pricey, but good for date night or for the once-in-a-while-let's-go-eat-out-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-cook sort of night."], ["Dana L.", "This is my favorite restaurant in the area.

Yuck it was disgusting.The noodles were stuck together like a overcooked \"noodle bundle\". (It's noted that they did put in effort to assist me when they saw that the noodles was stuck all together, but the food was just poor) The soup, was nothing like I had expected. It was oily and tasteless. They didn't put enough pear juice the soup. They tried to offer vinegar as a substitute just isn't the right substitute as it lacked the natural sweetness and sourness.Note: My friends who came with me liked their fish entrees but the food overall is still below average for a Korean restaurant. Good effort to step it up on the service though."], ["KC C.", "Stopped by here on my way back to New York and was surprised to find a Korean place. \u00a0The \u00a0restaurant isn't in the greatest location, but it's near the highway and once you go inside it's a complete different atmosphere. \u00a0The BBQ was good and what you would expect if you were in NYC, but was surprised by the number of side dishes they offered."], ["Nobbi L.", "So this is our second visit and I'm even more impressed than before. Our server today was Sunny who just started. Another ajumma who is so wonderful. This time we got 20 banchan! I think that's a record. This is by far the best Korean restaurant I've been to in Connecticut. If they had my favorite, yuk hwe, it could stand up to Korea Way in NYC. The dishes are flavorful, the banchan diverse and multidimensional. The Dolsot bibimbap was really crispy reminiscent of a Persian tadiq. Another plus is the Korean waitstaff. I don't like it when I go to an Indian restaurant and get served by a Guatemalan (unless he speaks Hindi or Gujarati or Tamil, etc.) I want the authentic experience. And here you get it. Too bad they have to have sushi."], ["Susan N.", "Ive been here a couple of times. \u00a0The place is clean with nice interior designs. \u00a0It was very comfortable because its very spacious. \u00a0They had private rooms, good for parties.finally we have restaurants like this in the hartford area. \u00a0We can finally grill our own beef inside. \u00a0I love how they served us alot of \u00a0side dishes with the orders, it was very tasty."], ["Steven K.", "Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this place.

Not appetizers but I finish them all (I guess I was hungry..)And I sit some more looking at these empty plates..

My first visit was a disaster and I said I would never return. However, today i decided to give the place a second shot. My first trip here was when they first opened so I decided to stay open minded and try again. This time around they gave me more sides than I could eat. As a matter of fact, they gave more side dishes than any other Korean BBQ restaurant I have ever been to. Believe me I have been to many! The meats were well marinated and certainly great. The service was very prompt and fast. Only draw back really is the price. Sadly you can get the same food at any Korean bbq buffet and pay significantly less. Insanely over priced for those of you who never ate Korean BBQ before."], ["Joel L.", "I had dinner on my own so wasn't able to enjoy the Korean BBQ (most dishes are for 2+ people). \u00a0I had the sushi instead and that was fine. \u00a0The service was polite and ok. \u00a0I wish I had the Korean BBQ, it looked delicious."], ["Dan R.", "Very good food + novelty factor + fun factor + great service = A super meal experience!Our first experience with Korean Barbecue was very enjoyable. They've only been open a few weeks, and I've been watching the very positive Yelp reviews pile up on an almost daily basis. Everyone is right on the money - this is a cool place that gives you a lot of bang for your buck.We all opted for a BBQ dish from the massive menu. Our choices were marinated chicken thigh, beef, and pork bellies. The meals start you off with a tasting of 14 side dishes - all sorts of cubes of this, and slices of that, and shreds of something. I saw kale, bean sprouts, potato salad, kim chi, lotus root and who knows what else. Nothing was outrageously spicy and all of it went. The BBQ concept is a hoot -each table has a mini gas grill built into the table, and one of the service staff goes through an elaborate ceremony of taking off the grill cover, taking off the grill grate, turning on the gas, and igniting the system. If you have kids, they will be mesmerized by this (hell, I thought it was pretty cool myself)!In a few minutes, our server brought a ridiculously large platter of the raw meats we ordered, plus a pair of kitchen shears to cut up the chicken and a big set of tongs to grill our selections at our table. It was so much fun!The marinated chicken was the consensus winner- it was tender and tasty and just delicious. The beef was thinly sliced and cooked the fastest. The pork belly was thicker and semi-frozen so it took longer than the beef to cook. The food came with dipping sauces, rice, and a field green-scallion salad,Being BYOB, we complied and had a few cold ones which really complemented the hot grilled meats.The staff was helpful -and damn -they must have had 15 or so workers running around like crazy. We were asked every 10 minutes if we wanted more rice, more sauce,and more sides (I said \"yes\" to the kimchi and the chewy and addictive lotus root. \u00a0Our BBQ choices ran $23, $23, and $24 for a grand total of $77.41 with tax. \u00a0Now think about that - less than $25 for a ton of really good food, served in a very novel and fun manner.This was a blast!! Thank you Yelpers for turning me on to a sweet place,"], ["Melody K.", "Probably the best Korean in CT. My family and I have been coming here often since it opened. My mom is 100% This is real Korean BBQ- grills in the center of the table, vent on top, and mountains of banchan, mountains. I think 12 side dishes come out when you order. I don't love the frozen pork belly. In a place with that decor and for that price, you expect fresh. However, the menu is great. We love the clay pot soups and they even have street food classics like dukbokki! Great for big groups in fact, I recommend you bring at least four people to split BBQ with- makes it economical- there is a ton of food!"], ["Lesley M.", "Going to a restaurant in its first week of operation is always a gamble because the staff is still trying to figure out the work groove. \u00a0Therefore, as a patron, you are expected to have some hiccups in service. \u00a0However, I see a lot of potential in this place.Despite being new, I really wanted to try this restaurant ASAP. \u00a0When I saw the first reviews on Yelp, I knew that I had to drag my fianc\u00e9. \u00a0After all, I drive by it everyday to work (both jobs) and was anxious to try it!Though located in a crummy strip mall, the location near Westfarms Mall and the interior d\u00e9cor are both perfect. \u00a0When we walked in, lots of tables were occupied and the kitchen was chaotic. \u00a0We were walked to our table/grill immediately, but were not acknowledged until ten minutes after we were seated. \u00a0Our waitress was very nervous and appeared to be new to waiting on tables, but gave her the benefit of the doubt because the restaurant was new and it was busy. \u00a0She was hesitant when she was cooking our meat on the grill.The menu had lots and lots of choices; Korean bbq, noodle dishes, soups, and sushi. \u00a0We were surprised that it was not cheap. \u00a0The Korean bbq was in the $20 and above range and it was a two-person minimum. \u00a0Since we never had a Jewish Christmas on Christmas, we splurged on the BBQ and ordered the Chadol-Baegi (beef brisket that is not marinated) and Daeji-Bulgogi (spicy pork collar, more like paprika pork collar). \u00a0Both were very good, but I liked the beef brisket. \u00a0You got a lot of food and it was like a Korean hibachi. \u00a0As Jason M. reviewed, if you get the BBQ, you don't need to get anything else because it comes with a bunch of different mini appetizers; some were good and others were misses.What was cool was that they didn't have a liquor license so we got a bottle of wine from CT Bev Mart next door, so we saved money on drinks. \u00a0The manager walked around and asked about our experiences. \u00a0There are little rooms for those who want a private party.Definitely be back, but to try a soup or noodle dish. \u00a0Good to see non-chain restaurants open in the West Farms area."], ["Jenny C.", "It's Christmas Night and H and I were too lazy to cook. I searched on Yelp for any open restaurant... lo and behold, a newly opened (12/20/13) local restaurant! The restaurant is not at all difficult to find. It's basically across the way from Chili's and in the same plaza as Subway. Parking was plentiful and packed- a great sign! We were promptly seated by the hostess and were in awe of the setting. It's beautifully decorated- there's so much to look at! H and I have been to our fair of Korean BBQ houses... and this might've been the prettiest to date. Our waitress was quick to take our order (BBQ- bulgogi and kalbi... Adventurous eh?! But it's the staples with which I determine a restaurant's yumminess) and our side dishes came out promptly. They were delicious in terms of ban chan (really, how hard?!) and were really flavorful. Waiting for our entrees, on the other hand, was a tad annoying since we waited a little over half an hour for raw meat (customer usually cooks it on the grill, refer to pictures). One of the staff members took the time to cook each set of raw meat- a nice surprise since I usually cook it for my H and I. The bulgogi was nicely seasoned- not too sweet and not too much sesame oil (which is how I like to make mine- much to H's digress). The kalbi on the other hand was perfect! Also, each of our waitresses were wicked nice!Also, H just had to order Philly and Cali rolls... They were standard fare, but great for the area. Too many local restaurants douse the rice with too much rice vinegar and overload the roll with rice. Yuck! Nothing extraordinary, but not horrible. Overall, well definitely come back. It's a tad expensive (prices are similar to Korea Town IMO) considering the area but the food was delicious and the waitstaff were wicked nice.(As I was looking around at all the beautiful things on the wall, a man spoke with me. He saw how cold I was and commented that it's the vent from the hood, that he was sorry! I thought he was an innocent customer who just pointed things out and thought nothing of it when he say at the next table. Also, our lid for the grill fell to the floor and he promptly picked it up! Should've been my cue that he's co-owner, part owner or the owner- but I was too busy enjoying my food and the atmosphere. Haha. Just a side note.)"], ["Zoe J.", "I loved the place.

I had a Groupon for Sakura, and the Glastonbury location was convenient for all who were joining us that evening.The interior is beautiful, very classy elegantly decorated. We were seated in the dining room, so as to enjoy a more conversation then watch the Hibachi show. The service started out well, but as it appeared to get busier through the shift, certain elements were certainly lacking. Our drink orders were taken, and after fifteen minutes, still no cocktails. The drink order wasn't big or complicated either, two of the signature martinis from the list, and one glass of white wine. Our appetizers had arrived and been eaten before we had to make the second mention of no refreshments. They were soon brought out, but nothing was comped off the check, or even apologized for. Our martinis (once they arrived) were the bright Pink Panther for my friend Stephanie, sweet and pink, and I had the Lychee Martini, which was excellent. A nice new martini to see on a menu, and a perfect balance of sweet lychee and sake. The appetizers for the table included:*Edamame - generous sharing portion*Coconut Shrimp - Very crunchy, very coconutty, and an excellent rich coconut sauce.*Seaweed Salad - Seasoned and with sesame seeds*Kani Salad - Crab, cucumber, and masago in a creamy sauce. Not too creamy at all, really nice rich crab meat flavor, one of my favorite types of salads.*Crazy Ceviche - Mixed raw fish and vegetables, with a seven spice dressing. \u00a0Nice flavor, definitely in the right category under \"New Style Sashimi\" different, reminded me of a ceviche stir-fry.Dinners included:Scallop Hibachi - Perfectly seasoned veggies and rice, nice sized seared scallops.Sweetheart Roll - Cut into heart shaped slices, with a wonderful sweetness with a miso honey sauce.Autumn of Alaska Roll - King Crab with a soybean wrapped with a honey pepper sauce. Excellent.Mummy Roll - Shrimp tempura, tuna, lobster salad, red tobiko, spicy citrus sauce, so many crazy flavors, and it works!! Awesome presentation on this roll in particular. For desserts, we went for a Turtle Cheesecake, I'm sure it was not made on premise, but it still wasn't too bad, and Tempura Fried Bananas, which were awesome, light and sweet, and perfect to share among four happy ladies.The service would be the only reason that we wouldn't return, because it was a bit slow. The prices were reasonable, for 6 people who left satisfied, our bill was under $200, even before the Groupon discount.

There were service problems from the start. We had to talk to the hostess to even get menus and she seemed offended that we sat at the bar without talking to her. There was no dedicated bartender and everything seemed disjointed. The horrible service continued throughout the meal or well lack of service. The next complaint is the food. We got the hibachi lunch without actually sitting at the hibachi tables. Our food was cold by the time it got to our table and simply bland.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is looking for a decent quick lunch."], ["Will W.", "Great ceviche style appetizer, fresh sushi and good habachi. \u00a0Good selection of saki and mixed drinks."], ["A.

My sushi arrived first and was just mediocre. The maguro was a bit of a disappointment and not worth the price. The soup was forgotten by my waitress until she was reminded by the sushi chef. However, the soup was much better than I expected. The miso broth was nice and strong and the soup was loaded with clams, scallops, shrimp, and crab. It was all very substantial and very filling. Give it a try!While not impressed with my sushi order (maybe I caught them on an off-night), the meal was enjoyable due to the friendliness of the sushi chefs and the quality of the soup. If I had more time in this area I would definitely give them a second look. If you haven't been, stop by and add your thoughts too."], ["Stefanie J.", "Happy hour here is fantastic - a great selection, nice outdoor seating, and just really good food. The pork gyoza and vegetable tempura are both great, and of course the sushi."], ["Jennifer B.", "First off, thank god someone actually designed a Japanese restaurant with Hibachi grills with some sense!! I am not a Hibachi fan and was so impressed that the grills are in a completely different part of the restaurant which of course keeps the noise down and keeps me from smelling like fried rice all night. The decor and layout of this restaurant gets five stars. The decor is modern and different which matches the menu. The menu is good but I wish they would explain their modern roll section a bit more. The presentation is amazing. I had the avocado salad which was good. Pretty basic but with fresh ingredients The fish in the sushi was fresh and very tasty! I wish they had some healthier dessert options. The service was excellent as well. The restaurant was not very crowded. We had made a reservation but it was not needed."], ["A A.", "I love this place. Great lunch spot. I get the a lunch box ( either sushi, chicken or beef teryaki whatever I'm feeling that day.) It comes with salad (I love the Ginger dressing) and miso. Then they bring you out a little wooden box with rice, vegetables, California roll, and some little dumplings. It's great and priced to please. Happy hour is a hell of a deal too. \u00a0In the warm months you can sit out on the patio and watch the Aston Martins drive down new London turnpike."], ["L. R.", "Overall, only three stars. \u00a0Here's why:Atmosphere: \u00a0Absolutely stunning decor - modern but not cold - with spots of fun color in the crazy lighting over each table and booth. We sat in a huge comfy booth with high backs for nice privacy. \u00a0This would be an intimate sexy place to take a date. \u00a0(We had 2 quiet, well-behaved kids in tow. \u00a0LOL)The sushi my husband and older son had was 4 stars....fresh and nicely prepared. \u00a0 Husband had sushi platter and older son had a spicy maki platter. \u00a0 The Nabeyaki Udon I had was a generous bowl of noodles, but UTTERLY FLAVORLESS and very skimpy on anything that could have added flavor, like mushrooms or fish cake slices that are standard in that dish. \u00a0A no stars item. \u00a0When the waiter came over to ask how our meal was, I told him there was no flavor in the dish, and he shrugged and told me it was a fish-sauce base, as if that was the explanation. \u00a0He offered no solution at all, then wandered off. \u00a0(Side note: \u00a0MUCH much better Nabeyaki Udon at Natori in Manchester, although you won't get the slick atmosphere).We wanted to order younger son something off the kids menu and asked to change the noodles from what was offered to udon noodles, but that was met with verboten - NO substitutes - so we had to order the adult size version. \u00a0It wouldn't have killed the chef to substitute one type of noodle for another. \u00a0If this place was turning away customers in a booming economy, I might not have a leg to stand on, but we ate there at 6:30 pm midweek and the place had 4 customers, none in the hibachi room. \u00a0A little flexibility brings customers back.As pretty as this place is, I'd go again probably to take a friend for the pretty atmosphere and for sushi only. On the way out, I asked the hostess for a takeout menu, and she gave me one from her secret stash that had a $10 coupon when you spend $50."], ["Rae B.", "i've been here a few times, and i'll come back for a few reasons. \u00a0the food has consistently exceeded my expectations, the drink menu has a very nice selection of sake, and Hibachi is always fun for a crowd! but this over-zealous bussing of tables needs to stop. the service, however, is hit or miss. sometimes i come, and everything is great. the server is nice, makes recommendations (this is how i found the joys of unfiltered sake), allows us to take our time with the meal, and i really enjoy myself. other times, and not when things are busy, around 5:30 on a wednesday evening, everything was very rushed. our waitress checked in with us every two minutes to take our order, even though menus were still open at the table. she rudely reached over my plate to take another dish from the table, that we were not even finished with. \u00a0my friends plate was cleared from under her chopsticks, before her last bite of sushi got to her mouth. that kind of militant bussing of table really turns me off to a place. the times i've been for hibachi everything has been wonderful. the hibachi cowboys always put on a nice show, and the sake flows like water. the food is always great, and i've never been rushed through a meal with the hibachi setting."], ["Sean H.", "The sushi is above average, the hibachi is above average, the service for large groups is below average.If you go in a smaller party 2-4 you will be fine. \u00a0Otherwise you should read about our experience.We arrived on time, even with the constant parking hassle of Eric town square. \u00a0 We were met by a gracious waitress who was good and attentive. \u00a0 We ordered drinks, they came at a good pace. \u00a0We ordered dinner and things went down hill from here.Two of six meals showed up late, one 10 minutes after the other four and one 20 minutes after the others. \u00a0 This was unfortunate but we took it in stride and did not complain. \u00a0 \u00a0No manager came to apologize. \u00a0 We finished our meals, were not offered, and, did not have dessert, paid the bill and talked for maybe 5 minutes after paying the bill. \u00a0 The waitress came and asked us to leave the table and move to sit at the sushi bar. \u00a0 This was uncomfortable enough, I was insulted and really just wanted to leave, but we moved. \u00a0 Not two minutes pass but now a hostess comes and asks us to move to the bar. \u00a0 We were quiet, it was after 8pm and not at all busy. \u00a0We were not drinking, nor did we want anymore to drink, why move us to the bar? Now we are insulted, and embarrassed. \u00a0 \u00a0I will not ever take a group there again. \u00a0 Sakura in Glastonbury will be the last on my list when I visit the town square. \u00a0 Is too bad, I like the sushi, but I don't need to be embarrassed when out with family."], ["Hilary D.", "I recently dined here with a few friends and their children. \u00a0I must say first of all that this place has the BEST sushi I have ever had. \u00a0Hands down.Additionally, I noticed there were quite a few families also dining at the same time - and everyone (including our group) was having a fantastic time. \u00a0The service was great - our Hibachi Chef was Brian and he was funny & great with the adults & the kids. \u00a0 Our server was Dan - he was busy with a few packed tables, but really did a great job attending to every request in a timely and friendly manner. \u00a0Next time I definitely want to check out the bar before dinner!"], ["Eli Z.", "After reading all the great reviews for Sakura we decided to give it a try last night. So glad we did. I was craving sushi and they delivered . The fish was fresh and flavorful. My bother n law and I split the Sushi For Two which came with 20 pieces of assorted sushi and two rolls. My wife and sister n law had the Vegetable Hibachi and Amazing Chicken. After a few Sapporo's and some sake, we all left happy and looking forward to the next visit."], ["Wilawan W.", "Me and my bf when for late lunch , the food was okay and our sever she have no clue what she's doing the whole time... But we just not try to make a big deal out of it until when we ask for the check , we ask for Togo cup for the ice tea than she come back with a Baby Bottle Cup !!! Omg the cup is cute .. But come on is this for real ??? Than I ask her what is just happen ? She told me that they don't have a Togo Cup is that why she gave our a Baby Cup from some where....? who's know ...! And the stupid host she asked me why don't you want a baby cup ?? What's wrong with you guys !! ??"], ["Erika S.", "So I went to Sakura Garden of Glastonbury on a Friday night. The restaurant had maybe 8 tables going. What a shame! The people of Glastonbury do not know what they are missing! This place is tucked into the same plaza that Plan B, Dream Dinners and Sauce are located. I've been to the other two locations, and I must say I think I might be their biggest fan. Fusion Japanese, or \"New style sashimi\" as they call it, is where they shine. I got to witness perfect execution of this on my most recent visit to this location. This restaurant has the same feel as the other two. A very metro feel, but tastefully done. There seems to be different themes throughout the Glastonbury location that perhaps I just didn't notice in the other two; Mt Fuji, the New York Skyline, etc. We chose to sit at the bar which is in the center of the restaurant, mainly because we know Sakura Gardens shines when it comes to hibachi and also traditional sushi, now let's get down to business and hang out at the bar and taste this \"new style sashimi\" My date ordered a hot sake and a sapporo and I chose a Pomegranate martini. The pomegranate martini was perfection in a glass, a true martini. A slight natural hint of pomegranate, not one of those candy flavored martinis. There were two bartenders on that night, Evan, and the name of the other one escapes me, but they were both friendly as can be and extremely efficient. After looking over the menu, we decided to start with Sushi Pizza Fiesta for an appetizer, a Geisha Sister and a Spicy Tuna Sandwich. These chefs take great pride in what they do, each dish was presented beautifully, and tasted even better. -Sushi Pizza Fiesta: Spicy Tuna, tomato and mozzarella cheese on homemade tortilla chips with spicy mayo and eel sauce. -----This was amazing. The eel sauce which can be intimidating to some, shouldn't be. It gave the \"pizza\" a smoky flavor. We asked how this was toasted and were told that the chefs use a hand torch to melt the cheese on top and give each chip a nice glaze. This app was 4 individual pieces....more than enough. -Geisha Sister: Baked, stuffed salmon with snow crab, baby arugula and served with spicy coconut aioli. -----This also beautifully presented in two separate portions, but on one plate. A great choice to get if two people want to share, but a lot of food for just one person. This is a baked fillet of salmon that is stuffed with a velvety snow crab filling. The spicy coconut aioli was good, but a little on the sweet side for m palate. I could however, appreciate why they chose it for this dish. -Spicy Tuna Sandwich:Spicy tuna, avocado, crunch, red tobiko, bonito flakes, soy bean sheet in sandwich shape and served with spicy mayo. -----This was by far my favorite \"new style\" dish of the night. Excellent!!! 4 triangle \"sandwich\"pieces were presented on the plate. This was extremely creative and very tasty. I'm not going to elaborate any more...just go order one. It'll be the best thing you've ever done! While we were sitting at the bar chatting up the night with the bartenders, I ordered another martini, The Rising Sun. A little on the sweet side for me, but that was due in part to one of the ingredients that I didn't realize was in it., This visit goes to show that the food is consistent at all all three locations, consistently excellent. This new \"local chain\" has officially raised the bar on Japanese and sushi dining."], ["Eliza T.", "Wow! \u00a0We were instantly impressed as we walked in. The decor is modern and elegant and romanically lit. \u00a0It was a Saturday night, and we're actually sad to see not to much business going on inside---hopefully they'll do better soon so they can stay in business!We chose to sit at the sushi bar. \u00a0It is a Korean-run place so if you love sushi, you should know what that means...still good sushi, but perhaps not as \"authentic\". \u00a0They of course had the \"creative\" sushi and sashimi options. \u00a0We opted to start with the sushi/sashimi combo for two which had 15 pieces of nigiri, 18 pieces of sashimi, a spicy tuna roll and a shrimp tempura roll for $48. \u00a0We had the Nigori sake with it. \u00a0The presentation of the combo was very very eye-pleasing. \u00a0The fish was all good and fresh. \u00a0Though they served use mackerel (saba) and told us that it was spanish mackerel (Aji) so I'm not really sure if it was an honest mistake or he just didn't know there's a big difference??? \u00a0They did use very little rice on their rolls as well as nigiri, which we very much appreciated. \u00a0I did have a problem with the way they cut their sashimi however....and this seems like the common problem at Korean-run sushi bars....where instead of cutting across the tissue planes, they cut parallel to them so that your teeth end up cutting through the tougher connective tissue and that was somewhat unpleasant. \u00a0 So the order for two would probably be enough food for most couples, but my BF eats a lot! \u00a0Esp when it comes to sushi! \u00a0Hahaha So we had to order a couple more rolls for him. \u00a0The rainbow roll was classic and simply done. \u00a0One of their special rolls is the Naturo roll which has salmon, tuna, and yellowtail wrapped in cucumber and no rice was amazingly refreshing and perfect for the summer! \u00a0Everything was reasonably priced. \u00a0Not cheap overall, but for sushi I can't complain.So overall, we really really like this place. \u00a0It is a bit of a drive from New Haven, but I'm sure I'll be back."], ["B G.", "Wonderful. \u00a0Delicious. Great service and great food. \u00a0Been here dozens of times, never a bad experience. \u00a0Best sushi in Glastonbury!"], ["Nina L.", "On my way home and craving sushi, I Googled my Droid to see where Glastonbury's Japanese restaurants were and wound up here. It was a Sunday afternoon and I sat at the sushi bar. The chef was very friendly. The sushi was really delicious; I had a special spicy tuna roll. I would definitely go back and hope to have the same experience. I felt very welcomed."], ["Adrian W.", "Good standard as well as creative sushi offerings. I have only stopped in for lunch, so I can't comment on the hibachi or dinner offerings. Each time I've left satisfied and found the staff to be very attentive. They also remembered me, which felt nice since I've only been in 3 times. Compared to the other Japanese restaurants in Glastonbury, I would put this one on a higher level. I'm currently 7 months pregnant, so I cannot have any actually raw items. When I've requested tobiko left off of handrolls they've accomodated me, which has not happened at the other 2 sushi places in town. The bento box lunch is larger than similar bento boxes I have had elsewhere - which to a pregnant woman is great! I definitely recommend Sakura."], ["Rod E.", "OK Japanese food, hibachi is VERY pricey.The service is ok, the food is good, but sometimes inconsistent from visit to visit, and the hibachi tables are VERY expensive (something like $22 per person).I've ordered the Yaki Udon a half dozen times, and the two most recent times it wasn't even hot, a big turnoff. \u00a0My wife complained that there was lipstick on her glass, and not hers, so they could pay closer attention to the cleanliness of the restaurant as well.We'll go back, but we'll be on the looking for those negatives I've described.A major complaint of that area (not the restaurant) is that the parking situation is horrible, like they built 50 spots in the lot for businesses that require 200."], ["Julie k.", "This place has really good sushi and sashimi. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plate for two and were not disapointed. The sushi had just the right amount of rice, which was cooked to the perfect consistency and flavored well (dont underestimate the importance of rice texture in sushi), the sashimi was very fresh and cut nicely. Our favorite was the scallop sashimi...mmmmmmmmm. We also ordered uni and it was oh so uni-rific. Overall, it was excellent. Even the rolls were very good! I really like this place. They have hibachi too! If you want some good sushi, try this place out. Dont forget to order some warm sake too. mmmm. I'm very happy tonight =)"], ["Loucindy W.", "This is a great place for sushi. Great decor, ambiance, and of course, wonderful sushi."], ["Moses P.", "A friend and I went up to Glastonbury to visit a friend and his family. We looked at the prices and could not believe how cheap it was in comparison to NYC. The hibachi was absolutely freaking awesome. Still craving hibachi, my friend and I went to Benihana's in NYC a few days later, paid double the price, and the quality of food was half as good. I am dying to go back here. Thanks Sakura!"], ["Mickey Z.", "wait staff always screws up orders and forgets these. The food is tasty but could be better - the rolls could be more creative. tasty drinks though!"], ["Karen P.", "One fateful night, the burger place down the strip mall was way too crowded, so we decided to try this place instead. \u00a0Thank the universe! \u00a0The sushi here is a-MAZE-ing; it's honestly in my top tier of sushi restaurants. \u00a0We tried a volcano roll (spicy tuna with salmon), a salmon roll, a Boston roll, a sweetheart roll, and... oh, I can't remember them all, but they were all so good, \u00a0they rendered us speechless. \u00a0I am at a lack of words for how to describe the awesomeness. \u00a0Just try it. \u00a0Our waitress was great, too-- very professional, friendly, and efficient. \u00a0The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is that, first of all, I'd like to go back just to make sure (yum!), and the decor is... well, odd. \u00a0I noticed a lot of reviewers saying it's relaxing and cozy, and I suppose it is, but it's definitely quirky. \u00a0I say this as one who appreciates quirk. \u00a0Just be prepared to eat amazing sushi while listening to the upbeat 70s station on Sirius radio. \u00a0Also, the parking situation is nothing short of abysmal."], ["Kevin K.", "Best Japanese Restaurant in CT, and I have been to all of them. Wide array of Specialty Plates and rolls. Excellent atmosphere and plate presentation is like art. Really cool drink choices that your date will love. Service is quick and quality is top notch. Bring your wallet."], ["Katie M.", "We went there on a Friday night. It was not very busy at all. We where going to go to plan B, but there was a 40min wait. And am I glad we ended up at Sakura! The decor inside is very nice and the booths were big and comfortable. The food was excellent! We ordered mostly sushi and it was very good.The only thing I can say is the service was pretty slow. It was not very busy and our waitress hardly ever came around. And when the food came out, she brought 3 or the meals and it was almost 10min before she brought out the other two meals. And we ordered the chicken tempura and she brought us a chicken teriyaki instead.If the service was a little better I would have definitely given 5 stars."], ["yes n.", "The worst place I have been to in a long time. That is a bold statement, I have been to hibachi places before but when nobody there speaks proper English it hard to tell them what you want to eat, I ask the server to make me a martini that was dry, pretty easy right 30 minutes later she showed up and said that they didn't know how to make it what!!!!! Its just alcohol with no vermouth and when it came \u00a0to the food I was allergic to shell fish and told the server, but still food came out with shell fish with it in my food, After the fourth time going there I will never go back and the manager does not know what the hell she is doing her name \"Christine\" she was probably the worst of all hire some people that speak English so I don't have to sit there for a hour ordering food to go, I work in restaurants and I tell people if you go there just get fried rice everything else sucks."]]}
