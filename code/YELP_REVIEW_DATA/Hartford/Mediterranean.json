{"The Capital Grille": [["Len J.", "Just exceptional. The food was perfect, the service was friendly, efficient and knowledgable. My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary. I let them know that when I reserved. Our table had rose petals on it as well as a note thanking us for coming. The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella appetizer was very good. It was very lightly grilled and finished with balsamic vinegar. Order it. Do it. I'll sit here and wait while you do. The steaks were great. The sides were more than two of us could share. We had what was probably the best cheese cake I've ever had for dessert. The only complaint I had was the valet parking. It was an absolute mess when we arrived for a 6:30 dinner. Cars on the sidewalk, in the street. No way to tell where to drop the car, or whether we should. But the point if this place is after you park. Our experience was impeccable."], ["Amanda P.", "Delicious food and good service. My friend and I split the lobster macaroni and it was delicious. A decent amount of lobster and the pasta was fresh and tasty. We also shared the generous portion of friend calamari, which was melt in your mouth delicious. My one complaint about the calamari is that they don't serve it with any type of sauce.The service was kind of weird. The waitress was attentive at first, although she didn't provide us with a bar menu and we were sitting in the bar area. \u00a0She gave her honest opinion of the dishes, which is appreciated and helpful when ordering. However, at the end of our meal, I ordered coffee and would have loved a refill on it but by then, the waitress had disappeared. I asked another waitress for a second cup of coffee, which she brought, and then my friend asked for a hot tea. Twenty minutes later, the waitress brought the tea and said \"oh, I kept forgetting to bring this to you because I'm not really your waitress.\"We were a little taken aback by that comment. I completely understand that the waitstaff needs to be attentive to their own tables, but the only reason we asked her for assistance is because our waitress was nowhere to be found. In general, the waitstaff seemed stressed and frazzled - no one was smiling. Perhaps they were understaffed for the night. \u00a0Overall though, it was excellent and I will definitely go back."], ["Binly S.", "I have enjoyed this place very much! The staff was great, maybe the best all around in the Hartford area. I came here with a group of 3 total and among us we had three starters, three cocktails, a bottle of wine, three steak entrees, two sides and two desserts. The setting and vibe was just right. Good music playing in the background and ambient lighting. It was very nice and romantic to say the least, except none of us had our dates. Ha!I myself had the Caesar Salad which I wasn't too fond of since the dressing was a bit too salty for my taste. To even that out the 24oz Dry Aged Porterhouse was absolutely delicious! The creme brulee for dessert was also very good to finish it off. The cocktail I had was the Adults only Arnold Palmer and I feel like it could've been better. Maybe a little sweeter? That's my opinion though.I will be coming back! But this time it will be with my lovely lady. I am looking forward to it."], ["Jena G.", "I came here for an anniversary dinner and this placed delivered. Per usual, I'll start with ambience. We came on a Thursday around 8:30 and the place was surprisingly tame. A few couples were interspersed throughout the main room. I didn't mind because everything was so quiet and romantic I could hear the flutters of my boyfriend's heart (could've been due to the bill, however). I've gotta say, coming from a girl who loves a good glass of vino, this place is pretty genius for making their entryway a glorified wine cellar. I mean come on. Who doesn't love entering an upscale restaurant that greets you with its hefty collection of wine? This place basically had me at hello.Since I came here for a special occasion, my boyfriend and I planned to go all out. We ordered a bottle of red claret which our server came out with promptly. He was helpful in guiding us in the right direction but hands off enough to let us pick a wine of our choice. There was nothing pushy about him; he didn't exude that clandestine message that some waiters do...you know...the \"try this $100 bottle you'll love it.\" We started with the spicy calamari (one of my personal favorites). Every piece was so tender and juicy I swear I still have dreams about that plate. Loved the tempura peppers to accent the calamari too. We also had a balsamic drizzled caprese salad which was fine...but I've lived in Italy so I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to mozzarella. For entr\u00e9es my boyfriend had a 22 oz bone-in rib eye which he finished in record timing. Seriously the Capital Grille should've timed him and put it up as an advertisement or something. He's had his fair share of red meat and this is the only thing he looked at with a more loving gaze than me all night. I ordered the french onion soup and lobster mac and cheese for a main course. The soup was fantastic and the LM&C was so. darn. rich. Just how it should be. I think my boyfriend is still recovering from the dent that the bill made but I repeat, this dinner was for a special occasion. I've been to a few upscale restaurants on par with this one but I only reserve my 5 star reviews for downright TREMENDOUS and PERFECT places. This place is darn near it. But the price tag is hefty."], ["Dan R.", "Valerie R. was right on the money, and I do mean money! This is an expensive restaurant where a drink, an appy or salad, and an entree will set you back no less than a C-Note easy, so it's definitely a special event kind of place.This was our first visit here, and we only went because I had a generous gift card left over from last year's birthday. The level of service was incredible- from the valet parking to the hostess station personnel to the servers. Everyone was amazing- so helpful and polite and courteous and ultra professional.They have a very cool iPad gizmo that serves as their wine list, so you can scroll and sort away to find the exact style or bottle or glass that suits your taste and budget. Most of the wines are north of ten dollars a glass.The bread basket was way above average- a real cornucopia of styles - rolls, dark sweet bread, and thin cracker like slices served with a big slab of butter.The three of us decided to split one of the salads -a $13 beauty of a dish with Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with 15-Year Aged Balsamic. A normal serving has two mozzarella-tomato towers, and we were very pleased to see that they reconfigured the dish into three towers. The salad was so good- fresh tomatoes, incredible mozzarella (made on site) and the balsamic was wonderful.I had a Gorgonzola and Truffle Crusted Dry Aged NY Strip for $48. It was 14 oz of deliciousness served with a black truffle and gorgonzola butter, and cherry cabernet reduction. The meat was perfect (medium rare). The gorgonzola crust was so flavorful and tasted great.My dining partners also had a filet ($44) and the Pan-Seared Sea Scallops with Wild Mushroom Risotto (also $44).We shared two of the sides - Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Smoked Bacon ($12) and the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($11). Both were pretty generous portions and were perfect for sharing.Was the food amazing? Yes it was.Was the level of service top notch? Yes we were pampered like royalty all evening. Check this out- at the end of our meal, the hostess asked if we had valet parked. When we said yes, she asked for our ticket, and carried out our \"to go\" bags to the car for us, so when we walked out the door, our car was waiting for us with our bags in the car. I'll leave it to you to decide if this level of quality and pricing structure is something you're interested in. \u00a0I will say that we were totally impressed with every facet of our dining experience. \u00a0For a special event, it's hard to top the Capital Grille."], ["Shellene O.", "The only thing I'm not terribly fond of at Capital is their prices! \u00a0 I've had nothing but excellent service in both the bar and the restaurant. \u00a0I've been with large parties and for one to one lunches. \u00a0The food is always excellent and the steaks are always perfectly cooked. \u00a0 \u00a0This is the kind of places that makes me wish I had a bottomless stomach so I could try everything! \u00a0I almost never make it to dessert because I'm just too full. \u00a0 Any opportunity I get to have a vendor take me here I don't pass it up! =)"], ["Claire K.", "Amazing! I came here with my boyfriend last night, and we shared an amazing dinner. We shared the Crab Cocktail(perfect), 1 cup of Clam Chowder, The \u00a0Bibb Stack Salad with Pear(nice light salad), The Citrus Glazed Salmon(perfect), and an amazing Flourless Espresso Cake. Worth every cent!Whenever we're in Hartford, we will definitely considering going back to The Capital Grille."], ["Lydell A.", "I was hooked on my first visit. I stopped by here for a restaurant week deal before I knew what I was getting myself into. I didn't realize that it was a larger chain know for it's relatively uncommon dry-aged steak. I feel like dining here caused me to actually learn and was a turning point to as a foodie. \u00a0When a place can do that, you know have to give them no less than 5 stars. Where do I start? I do know what to rave about first, but I think I'm going to go with the service. The level of service here, from the free valet, to the maitr\u00e9 d, to the waiter, was eye-opening. I can tell they put a heavy emphasis on making the experience as perfect as possible. My reservations (and I suggest reservations) were promises kept every time and I was seated promptly after every arrival. Smiles and manners are common almost anywhere but the level of attentiveness and customization make their service shine. When my cup was less than half way full someone came to fill it before I could request it. My napkins were color matched to my pants to (camouflage \u00a0better?!). They swept the table free of crumbs between each course. Service gets 6 starsThe food. Oh the food. I pretty much always get steak from a steakhouse so that's what I've had at most of my visits here. Last time I had a NY Strip and it was cooked absolutely flawlessly and the flavor is what I want every steak I ever eat to taste like. I've never had a filet as tender as Ruth Chris but I've never had any ny strip as flavorful as Capital Grill. \u00a0The sides were pretty good but nothing notable for me. What shone from the dessert menu for me is the flourless chocolate espresso cake. It's not a huge portion size but it is rich, surprisingly filling, and a party for your tastebuds. \u00a0Also, I had a Gorgonzola and black truffle burger from here once for lunch with fries. The fries were decent, but the burger was easily the best I've ever had.This place isn't cheap but that's kind of the point. Come with your stomach empty but your wallet/purse full. \u00a0;)"], ["Kristin B.", "I love coming to this restaurant. The atmosphere is just amazing. They take your coat. Their wine bottles are on display as decor. There's a waiter with one of those waxed mustaches (or at least there used to be). They offer you hot towels at the end of the meal, and bring you a doggie bag (is it too classy to call it that here?) with a personal note from the chef. Yes!The food is so delicious. \u00a0It is well worth the price. \u00a0They are far too generous with the desserts I will say. Bring someone to share with. \u00a0Last summer I called ahead and told them I was bringing my partner for his birthday and they made sure to have a surprise cake ready with his name on it. They also sprinkled little glittery stars on the table next to a hand written card wishing him happy birthday upon our arrival.

The service, food and ambience were excellent in both, although the two locations have very different ambience. The steaks and salmons I've had were superb. They beef is aged and though \u00a0they don't advertise how old, we were given a tour of their facilities and the kitchen and drying refrigerator are impeccably clean and up to date. The servers are very knowledgeable, the list of wines long, and they offer iPads so you can peruse both wines or bourbons at your leisure. \u00a0The appetizers are truly special and even though I hate ordering apps if I know the meal will be large, you'll want to splurge and try them. They have a version of fried mozzarella that is a first for me - it's wrapped in prosciutto and it's crispy. The calamari is fried with hot green sliced peppers. The lobster tails are split and easy to eat, ice cold and delicious. They had a special 16 oz fillet, bone in, served with a light butter sauce. It is possibly the best beef I've ever had and certainly ties with anything at Peter Luga (I actually preferred to Peter Luga's) and the best Ruth's Chris I've been to (West Palm Beach FL). \u00a0Okay, I'll stop here. The restaurant is great, the service is not overbearing but perfect instead. The price, well, if you have to ask . . . that's the clincher.

Excellent greetings ... The staff is amazing. Now the food was amazing I had the filet mignon \u00a0with lobster tails . The steak was cooked to perfection.

Let me start by saying, I am hesistant to eat anywhere in Hartford. Location is a big deal but parking is an even bigger one. Capital Grille has killer valet parking and couldn't be easier. We were seated in a nice quiet corner of the restaurant and the service was simply impeccable. We had salad (fresh, delicious and large portions) for our appetizer. My boyfriend had the rib eye and I had the porcini tenderloi. Both were scrumptious and done very well. The sides were green beans and the best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten in a restaurant. They reminded me so much of what my Italian grandmother would make when I was a kid. Dessert was Creme Brulee with a fresh fruit topping. Out of this world!Everything from service to food was worth it. The prices on their menu are outrageous but, you get what you pay for. I can't see going here more than once or twice a year for special occasions but I know if we were to visit again, we wouldn't be disappointed."], ["Valerie R.", "You have to get in the right frame of mind in order to dine at Capital Grille. \u00a0If you are not there for a special event, then you need to tell yourself that you are going to spend $100 per person, or even more if you are drinking. \u00a0Even if you are there for a special event (Restaurant week, etc) if you tack on the extras, it will be costly. But it will be great food!The first time we went, it was for a Restaurant Week in August 2014. \u00a0They were nice about it, they encouraged you to eat from that menu and still provided excellent service, unlike some of their competitors (cough, cough...Morton's). \u00a0Martha was our server and she was amazing. \u00a0They also had their Generous Pour event going on. This was 7 tastings of wine throughout the meal for $25. \u00a0The wines were fabulous and you were able to get more of any of the wines you liked. \u00a0Seeing as normally you would spend $25+ for a single glass of wine at Capital Grille, I thought this was a phenomenal deal and definitely left with quite a buzz. \u00a0It is a must try for everyone who enjoys wine, apparently they do this every summer and can save you some bucks on the alcohol part of the bill.The second time we went was on 5/2/15, right at the end of the Wagyu and Wine event. \u00a0For $25 they offered one of four featured wagyu burgers with fries, along with a glass of wine with a choice of two red wines. \u00a0This might not sound cheap to the average person, but again, a glass of wine generally runs more than this at Capital Grille, so this is a great deal. \u00a0We had to sit in the lounge to get this deal, though when we called earlier in the day they were very accommodating, saying that they would allow us to have the special in the dining room if the lounge was full when we came in. \u00a0It was not, and we grabbed a nice table by a window. \u00a0I had the featured gorgonzola and black truffle burger with a glass of \u00a02011 Beringer Quantum Cabernet Sauvignon Blend. \u00a0My husband picked the burger with havarti, a fried egg and crispy onions, with a glass of 2012 Etude Carneros Pinot Noir. \u00a0We both loved our own wines better than the other, and both loved our burgers. \u00a0I liked his burger a little more because you could taste the meat and it was good - I liked mine too but gorgonzola tends to overshadow the flavor of anything else.We also added on apps (french onion soup and Caesar salad) and desserts (coconut cream pie and creme brulee) and pre-dinner drinks (mojito and cosmo) and it was well over $100 at the end of the night. \u00a0But the food and drinks were great! \u00a0The mojito was the best I've tasted since being in Puerto Rico, the burgers and wine were fabulous and the coconut cream pie portion size was ridiculous. \u00a0They even let me upgrade to parmesan truffle fries at no extra cost. \u00a0We brought half of our burgers home and had a great night overall.After I've said all of that, I still have to say I prefer J. Gilbert's, because the quality of the food is comparable, and we can get a full meal with a bottle of wine there for half the price of Capital Grille. \u00a0I'm still giving Capital Grille a 5, because if it's a special occasion or it's in the budget, you will have a good experience here. \u00a0Definitely sit in the dining room over the lounge, as you will get more of the experience that is worthy of the price tag."], ["Justin C.", "My god that was an experience. Vowed to never go here unless everything was on someone else's dime (since it's crazy expensive). Sure enough, I finally got lucky. \u00a0PRO:Fantastic food. Everything I ate was amazing.

Oysters and shrimp were incredibly fresh. Calamari was cooked perfectly too. Even got a great surprise at the end when everyone at the table was given a gift card on the house. CON:Expensive. Every entree is going to run you $40, and that probably wont include anything (sides, salad, etc.). Basically everything is a la carte. \u00a0You want mash potatoes? Get ready to pay for it. I'm not a huge fan of that serving style in general... Some other folks at the table had issues.

This is my go to business dinner location.The drink and wine selection is impressive and the wait staff is always very well versed in all. If you want to impress your customers or a loved one who likes seafood, I recommend the seafood tower. It's nothing short of amazing. Blue crab, lobster, oysters, and shrimp round out this three tier tower of chilled seafood. The fried calamari is always perfectly cooked and the fresh mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto is a very unique and delicious selection.For the entree there is only one selection in my opinion and its the bone in ribeye.The Kona crusted with shallot butter is my rub of choice and have never been disappointed...ever. I should diversify my Capital Grill experience and try something else one time but when the monent of truth arrives I stick to my rock. I did just try the porchini rubbed The sides also make the dining experience. I have two words, Lobster Mac!! The sides are big enough to share with another person but not the lobster mac and cheese!!

It was wonderful in every way, except maybe a bit heavy on the bleu cheese for someone who only likes it in small doses (my fault, I should have asked them to go light).On my second trip to Hartford I took advantage of their breakfast buffet not once but twice. At $16 it's about the standard hotel breakfast rate, but this one offers a custom omelet or eggs made to order in addition to the expected items like pancakes, bacon, oatmeal, and cereal. I was really impressed by their fresh fruit selection and I think I probably ate about $16 worth of berries anyway. I'm usually not the type to have a hotel breakfast multiple days in a row as I much prefer to explore, but when it's three degrees out, I'm very grateful when my hotel offers a pretty decent selection. Above all, I was really impressed with the friendly and attentive service. I was expecting to pretty much be ignored once I chose the buffet, but their waitstaff checked on my constantly to make sure I had enough juice, coffee, and tea, and just see if I wanted anything.

Anyway, she finally came back and I ordered a Rolling Rock and an \"ultimate\" gyro. She asked me what kind of meat I wanted: chicken or beef. I said, \"Neither, I want a traditional gyro with a blend of beef and lamb.\" She informed me that they don't have that, adding that they have it as a roadside special during the week.

(The drive does not get that)My math says the order will be $18.00 plus tax and tip. When the pizza arrives I handed the delivery guy enough cash to cover it all. He cashes me to the elevated showing me that I hadn't paid him enough. I gave him another $5.00 because that was the lowest bill I had and told him to keep any extra. Then I noticed that they charged me $19.00 for a $16.00 pizza along with the tax, tip, and delivery fee. The total was $22.21. $3.00 dollars to much. I called the pizza parlor and ask why the amount was $3.00 higher and the guy on the phone tells me that he forgot to take off the olives ($2.00) that BTW he told me as soon as I asked for them that they were out of olives. But somehow he had no problem not only charging me the $2.00's that he just went ahead and made it $3.00. This means that I paid extra tax on $3.00 too. So why the rant over $3.00 and some pocket change. Because when I told the guy to just send some bread sticks over and we'd be fine, he told me no because the bread sticks cost more than the $3.00 and change he owed me. Instead he offered me a discount on a pizza tomorrow. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT. Where is the customer service. There is none there. What's the cost on a few bread sticks to him? $0.50 maybe.

The college students were going all out- beer, wine, hard liquor, mixers,etc. At least the corkage fee was cheap ($3)Even though it claims to be Italian, Greek and Mediterranean, the menu was 100% Italian. which was dissapointing. The calamari were just OK, nothing special. The bread was very good. I have to admit that the butternut squash ravioli was REALLY good, however I never seen SO MUCH brown butter sauce on a dish. \u00a0I didn't end up ordering much else since I had expected a much more diverse menu."], ["Kelly T.", "Great food, horrible service. \u00a0Waitress seemed scattered, kept forgetting us. \u00a0Waited on people who came in a good 5 minutes after us before acknowledging us (a party of 6 is kind of hard to miss). \u00a0Not sure we would go back."], ["Mari K.", "I had found this place in my search for local BYOBs and decided to give it a try. It's located right next to Trinity, but we had a little trouble finding it as there's no sign that I could see with the name of the restaurant. There is some street parking right out front. As we approached the establishment we were greeting by a friendly man, and we were seated quickly once inside. \u00a0We visited on a Monday night and it was very quiet; I think there was only one other group there during the entire duration of our meal. However, the space is pretty nice (I added a few pictures of the interior), and has room for a good number of people to sit \u00a0comfortably. The server, who I believe may have been one of the owners, was really sweet. It seemed she was the only one there so it wasn't super fast service, but we were not in a hurry and the family feel was nice. \u00a0If there had been more patrons, they definitely would have needed more help to keep things moving quickly enough, and I'm assuming they bring in more help during busier times of the year. We had brought our own wine since Trinity Restaurant's Facebook and Yelp pages say that they are a BYOB, but I noticed they did have a pretty good wine list. I asked the waitress, and she said they do both (my favorite answer). She brought us two wine glasses. I order the arugula and spinach salad (it had another name that's escaping me). It had a huge piling of fresh greens with a very tasty dressing and four thin slices of cheese (see picture). I always enjoy fresh greens, especially the slightly spicy kick of arugula, so I was pleased. We did have a smidge of bad luck with entrees, initially ordering 2 that were not available at the time (the scallops dish, which looked great in the picture on the wall, and the osso buco, which sounded amazing). She clearly felt bad and apologized for not having them, and explained that the osso buco is always available in the fall, but in the off-season (I'm assuming it's off-season because college is out, and Trinity students and families likely make up a good portion of their clientele), they can't make huge batches of it, as it takes a long time to make, and they would end up with large quantities being wasted. She said that regulars will call ahead of time to order the osso buco, which I thought was a great tip. I totally understand the reasoning and agree that this should be more of a seasonal item (but I do think it would be helpful for them to indicate this on the menu).I ended up ordering the garlic shrimp linguine (it may have been called something slightly different) and my date ordered the seafood paella. The paella was fantastic (it does come with a lot of peas, just fyi); the seafood was cooked just right and the broth was really good. The shrimp linguine was good as well. My favorite part of the whole experience, though, was unexpected. We had already paid and were ready to leave when the waitress brought out a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for us to share, on the house. \u00a0We had told her it was our first visit, and I think she wanted to make a good first impression. It worked! I would not have ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (I was really full from all of the salad and pasta!), but I am so glad I had the chance to try it. It was fantastic! The custard was rich and creamy, the perfect texture and sweetness with a hint of vanilla. The top was torched just right- it shattered like thin glass under the spoon and had a delicious, sweet caramelized taste. After thinking about it, it makes sense that a place called Trinity Restaurant, situated next to Trinity College, would have a great Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e... since it's rumored that the first creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e originated at a Trinity College in Cambridge, England!No matter the reason, the food and overall experience were good, but I would go back there just for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e."], ["Rabbi L.", "OMG, I love this place so much.

Sorry, Trinity restaurant- I had every intention of loving you but I just couldn't do it. \u00a0First of all, our server must have NEVER worked in a restaurant before. She served our appetizers and entrees simultaneously, and brought our check without even asking if we wanted dessert or coffee. \u00a0Parts of each entree that were advertised on the menu were conspicuously missing, and brought over on separate plates as an afterthought when we pointed out their absence. My bolognese was ok, my wife's swordfish a little better, but still thin and slightly too well done. \u00a0We did like the Tuscan bean soup. Our 9 year old had a cheese pizza which I thought was on the quality level of a frozen box pizza. \u00a0The space is nice, and maybe this was just a bad night, but I left missing Timothy's even more than I did before.

They do not even have a menu item that costs approximately the amount the said that we owed. Additionally, when we challenged the amount due, we were met with adamant opposition, even following adding up the value of every item and presenting a corrected bill. This has happened to multiple member of the party before this, and even credit card statements that showed how this happened and they wouldn't give us a refund.

Two days before, I was unable to stay for the entire lecture because I had to teach a class, so I never got to try the food, but it looked so good, and people were raving about it the next day, so we made the trip to the actual restaurant (easy to find parking, though you need to look for the name under the building's awning or you might miss it.)

On the menu are also dessert pizzas which looked quite amazing. The location is perfect in Blueback. Pizzas take about 5 minutes, which is great for both eating in and taking away. In the inner months I can see myself ordering a pizza and eating it in one of the sitting areas in the center. That being said, there's not too many seats if you do want to eat in. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone visiting the center. It's a great mid-shopping food spot."], ["Rana P.", "Overall very impressed with this place! The pizza is delicious and the vibe is cool. It's very reminiscent of a pizza version of chipotle. The concept made me nervous because I thought it would take a long time, but the pizza came out in less than 5 minutes. But let me emphasize: the pizza is delicious. I got the portobello pizza and it was better than expected. The price is very reasonable. Around $10 for a personal pie. The only downside is that there isn't much seating, and I would imagine that it would get crowded during busy hours."], ["Lesley M.", "Now I know why this place is called Posh Tomato...The pizza is alarmingly thin, just like Victoria Beckham, a.k.a.

Think of this place as a cool, trendy, fast-food joint where you can select from a few favorites or build your own. Originally I was going to order a \"salad\" and the salmon pie because it sounded somewhat healthy and unique. I soon learned the \"salad\" was a pizza salad and the guy behind me told me his fave was the Caesar salad pizza. I ended up ordering just the Caesar pizza and Wow, so happy I switched my order! The crust is paper thin and so easy to roll up and devour in a hot second. The salad toppings were fresh and plentiful but a tad messy when eating on a slice of pizza. The price is what you can expect for a gourmet style pizza located in We Ha. The atmosphere is really relaxing though there are not a lot of seats. Also, expect to wait for a good 5 minutes for your pie but I'm telling you, it will be worth it! Ps. Go all out and order that chocolate dessert pizza too (I will next time)....you know you want too."], ["Diane T.", "Not the best pizza but not totally bad either. As other reviewers said, the crust is really, really thin (thinner than New York style), perfect for anyone on a low carb diet, though not my thing personally.

They have pizza ready for you in 3 minutes.

Perfect quick dinner on a Wednesday night in blue back. Cool concept of very thin crust personal pizzas all done in 5 minutes. There's plenty of different combinations, all of which sound amazing. The owner suggested that the \" best pizza on the menu\" was the ceasar salad pizza, with chicken and mushrooms. Definitely one of the best salads I've had! The pizza crust is so crispy and crunchy and the garlic and cheese and ceasar dressing really make this. It was a great pick for going to a pizza place and trying to stick with a more healthy choice. My fianc\u00e9 even said that he would eat salad only if it was on a pizza from now on. The atmosphere here on Wednesday was awesome! We took our pizzas outside and enjoyed a concert of a drum group.

The charcuterie and cheese plates were amazing, some of the best selections I've had. Those two plates alone would be worth 5 stars, the reason for the downgrade was the salad (it was wilty) and service. We were a larger group, but even so, it took nearly 2.5 hours to get through the meal.The flatbreads are larger than you would expect, don't plan on having one by yourself if you're getting anything else as an app or salad - you'll never finish it."], ["Emily C.", "Besides my visit yesterday, I hadn't been to Arugula in years. My roommates and I used to go for each of our birthday meals - I don't know why I ever stopped! And thankfully now I live so much closer.Arugula is a delight. AWESOME cheese selection and housemade charcuterie plate, gorgeous flatbreads (the duck confit is a favorite), and lovely desserts (think housemade donut bites dusted with cardamom cinnamon sugar served with white/dark chocolate ganache). Yesterday, I stopped in with two friends for a late lunch. It was a BEAUTIFUL sunny day in West Hartford center and they'd never been to Arugula. While we'd have loved to have outdoor seating, the food was enough of a draw.I ordered a glass of chardonnay and a chicken shwarma wrap. Our server was efficient, pleasant, and attractive as hell (that certainly doesn't hurt) and the entire meal was just a joy. One friend enjoyed her Mediterranean cobb and the other LOVED the curried eggplant flatbread. All in all, a fantastic experience. Granted, yes, the restaurant wasn't very busy at 3pm on a Saturday (kinda an off time) but I've always had good luck with the restaurant service. My only gripe is that there's no glass of wine option for less than $9.

Arugula is a relatively small space. You can see everyone in the restaurant from our table at the back corner, near the kitchen.We were greeted quickly and seated quickly, but were a little surprised by how empty it already was at just about 9pm. We ordered wine from their moderately sized wine list and got the Rosemary Polenta to start. Fresh warm bread came to the table after about 5 minutes, and there was oil and pepper to dip in. We ordered the filet of tuna and the pumpkin and ricotta ravioli. Both were generous portions and were very good. The polenta was also excellent. It was honestly a struggle to decide whether to keep eating the bread/polenta, or the main course.The ambience was generally very relaxed, quiet, and comfortable. Not too upscale, but not an Applebees, for sure. Our server was helpful when asked questions about the wine and the entrees, and made us feel at home.My one complaint would be that as it got close to closing time, the staff began to clear silverware off other tables, clean the floors, etc. And when we got up to leave, the door to the restaurant was already locked, so we had to get someone to let us out. Not a big demerit, but certainly odd."], ["Sandra C.", "Foodies of Central CT unite. The mother ship has been found! :))Best food in West Hartford I ever had. Will most definitely be coming back.Friday and Saturday nights are so in demand at this place that you can only reserve for a maximum of four people. I went with a small group of friends and immediately loved the decor inside. It was so cozy and intimate. We watched quite a few couples with no reservations come and have to come back later. It appears that this is a very romantic place for people.The food was outstanding. I got the moules et frites and my friends got the tuna filet mignon. All entrees were superlative. I had never tried tuna before and had a bite...I was very impressed. My friends who ordered the tuna said that the staff knew what they were doing because they asked did they want their tuna rare or medium rare. Salads were large and delicious and the two deserts we got to share were delicious also. Overall an excellent dining experience and this is where I would go to impress someone special or go just to have a really really good meal.And I cannot close out this review without mentioning the staff. We didn't have to pay extra for the comic relief of Mike our server. He's co-founder (shhhhh - he never let's on) and he was cracking jokes left and right. We were rolling in our seats holding our sides from hooting with laughter.Want a convivial Cheers-like atmosphere with some darn good food and drinks? Check out Arugula. Maybe I'll be seeing you at the next table over. Bon appetit!*** If you want to try restaurants on par with this fine establishment, try River Tavern in Chester, CT.

Thanks to the limitation on word count).Before having my tuna, I asked the waitress what wine would pair well with the tuna, in which she responded \"well, what do you like, red or white?\" I said, \"in that case, what would you recommend for a red?\" she responded, \"i'd say a Shiraz.\" She brought me a glass of Shiraz, she didn't tell me what kind, but all I could say was that the pairing of that specific Shiraz did not go well with that tuna. My girlfriend ordered a Merlot. Once again we had no clue what type of Merlot. She never informed us or even allowed us to take a sample, but I initially trusted her confidence in the pairings. I preferred my girlfriend's Merlot over mine. I think it should have been the other way around, the duck with that specific Shiraz, and my tuna with that Merlot. Heading to the bathroom you can see the whole kitchen. It looked small and actually reminded me of a typical fancy restaurant in New York City. It almost brought me back to the times where my naive Connecticut friends and I aimlessly walked around in New York City searching for a fine dining restaurant, only to be swayed in thinking that just because we were in a popular section meant that we would be getting excellent quality food. Yeah, we were just dumb tourists, and after dining at Arugula I kind of got that vibe. After experiencing the service, seeing the kitchen, and having those three courses, I was definitely smacked upside the head with a memory of my tourist trips to New York City. It all came together. And reflecting back, we ordered 4 glasses of wine, the escargot, duck confit and filet mignon of tuna dishes, and dessert. I believe this was a pretty nice check, not to mention that I always tip 20%. So given the price with the dining experience, I believe that there is an uneven balance to this scale of weighing the pros and cons, where the cons kind of outweigh the pros.From this Mediterranean restaurant, my girlfriend and I had a very French type of dining experience. This fine dining restaurant gets an A-OK in my book. Maybe I will come back, but I believe for me it's maybe on to the next restaurant.;)"], ["Melody B.", "Very small and cozy with an imaginative menu.

There's not much to speak of decor-wise (ripped booth seats, random pictures of roosters, slightly exposed kitchen and antique looking sconces) but they do have a patio in front sporting a full bar, which I'm sure is fun in the summer. We started with the cold platter (Skordalia, hummus, get and olives and tzatziki. The skordalia was slightly creamy and incredibly garlicky, but could have used a pinch of salt to uplift the boiled potato. The hummus was amazing- incredibly light with an almost whipped texture, garlicky and smooth. The pita bread they served was slightly crisped in places (possibly heated on flat top), fluffy and chewy. The same pita and tzatziki made up my chicken svoulaki sandwich. The chicken and lamb skewers were both nicely tender and had some char from the grill. For me the chicken was undersalted (seasoned) but my boyfriend loved the lamb (served on skewers with rice, pita and tzatziki). Overall, if you're feeling let down by pizza places with Greek options, try a Greek place with a pizza option!"], ["Lisa L.", "Enjoyed everything we have had here until tonight. \u00a0I found the ratio of cheese to sauce on the pizza not right- way too much cheese. \u00a0I had to cut pieces of cheese off. \u00a0Love the meatball topping but didn't think the bacon on top of the pizza was cooked enough so I probably wouldn't order that again. \u00a0I agree with others that the hummus and the chicken lemon soup are out of this world and cold really make a meal out of those two things and be happy. \u00a0I will try the pizza again and just request less cheese and more sauce and see how it turns out !"], ["Angie Nicole S.", "Amazing food, excellent service and a great wine selection. \u00a0It's the best food on the Berlin turnpike. \u00a0I recommend this place to everyone."], ["Jon G.", "I hate to say it, but we went to Cavo's for lunch when it first opened a few years ago. \u00a0I'll be completely blunt - it totally sucked.However, some our our good friends told us that Cavo's had vastly improved since then. \u00a0I was surprised to discover that they were, in fact, completely correct. \u00a0The Gyro Plate was terrific and the service was top-notch. \u00a0I've almost completely forgotten about our experience way back when. \u00a0Very nice patio as well!"], ["Lauren V.", "My coworkers and I stopped here on a whim while out for lunch. None of us had ever been and I have to admit it looked a little sketchy when we pulled up, but we went based on the good reviews on yelp and were pleasantly surprised with the food. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she suggested the Grilled Loukaniko and it was very tasty! \u00a0They allowed me to order it with grilled vegetables instead of fries and the vegetables were really good. The service was great, the waitstaff was super friendly. I will definitely recommend this place and go back if ever in the area again."], ["Lesley B.", "I have only had a takeout \u00a0for lunch but OmG best gyro I've ever had. Our new favorite lunch place and we will keep going back :)"], ["Jason M.", "Outstanding food, great service and nice ambience. The lamb gyro's almost melted in my mouth and the hummus was delicious. Will go again, great place."], ["Andrew B.", "We are Greek and have had difficulty finding a good Greek restaurant in the area. \u00a0 Recently, we visited \u00a0Cavos (twice) and were very impressed. \u00a0Everything was very authentic and as good (or better) than the homemade stuff our family prepares on holidays.The Moussaka, Spanikopita, Grape Leaves, Lamp Chops and \u00a0Hummus are all very good and highly recommended."], ["Joe P.", "Friend and I just returned from dinner here. We both had a Gyros. For any displaced Chicago or Midwestern folks, this is as close to a Chicago Greektown Gyro as I have found, in Connecticut. They have an actual rotating spit and the meat is sliced off fresh. The meat isn't quite as spicy as the Chicago version, but it is still pretty close. They were served on fresh pita with onions, tomato and a great tzatziki sauce. We were so desperate for a Chicago style Gyro that we were actually considering just buying a spit. Realizing that it probably wasn't the best solution to buy our own spit, we started searching for a place. Finally found Cavos which satisfied the craving.We will definitely return!"], ["Tara B.", "This place is phenomenal! We had greek style pizza (that was awesome), but we are definitely coming back to try the traditional meals!"], ["Steven H.", "Delicious Greek food, a tad pricey given the location and decor. Decent selections of wine."], ["Jim C.", "Excellent gyros! The gyro plate feeds two people no problem."]], "Front Street Bistro": [], "Majorca": [], "Sisson Avenue Pizza House": [["Anthony P.", "I do not care what you say, I LOVE this pizza! Why, do you ask? Maybe it's because it's across the street from a bar, and sometimes late night food is great to have after a night of sipping on brews. I have no issues with the quality of this pizza. I am originally from around the boroughs of New York, so any pizza that's thin crust is at least A-OK with me! I like oil dripping from my pizza. I love the sauce and the melted cheese. Maybe you think it's low quality? Maybe I think it's superb! One man's trash is another man's treasure! The guys who work there may not be Italian (which has been for awhile typical of any of those take-out/sell-by-slice places. God bless these guys. Their pizza place is in an area where individuals walk around late nights zoned out on substances. Here is a low down I got from one of the workers from the Half Door, the bar which is across the street from this place. Buy 4 slices, it's 1/4 sized BIGGER than a large pie (that's a whole pizza in New York talk). On top of those 4 slices being BIGGER than a large pie, you pay $4 LESS than you would for a large pie. So you choose, $12 for 4 slices that is bigger than a whole large pizza, or $16 for a large pizza that is 1/4 smaller than 4 slices? Up to you on how you want it. I guess the con about those slices is it's not as fresh as ordering up a whole large pizza. I could care less, I carry the New York mentality with my pizza. As long as the pizza cheese is melted, the tomato sauce is good and the oil is dripping down the pizza..........i'm fan! I come here a lot, so obviously my brain and body loves this place. So I gave it 4 stars."], ["Byron D.", "I called in order for pizzas and chicken wings. We had people working at our home and needed to feed the workers. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire order was delivered 1/2 hour later. The pizza was fine the chicken wings were good. \u00a0The owners through in a complimentary 2 liter bottle of soda as well. I would recommend Sisson Pizza anytime you need a delivery."], ["Slinky s.", "Wow... So mean there. I am sorry yelpers I've Been raving about their late night hours & menu for selection for so long... Never would've imagined they could be so mean when they mess up your order & ironicLly they gave me more than I pd for... I called & told them my order was wrong - guy on phone said I had to come in In person to voice complaint - so I did & waited do patiently &tried not to let other patrons hear my problem - owner told me to leave!!! $2 my order would cost him - great job ... Been going there once a wk for at least 4yrs spending min$20 so glad you think not remedying my $2 mistake is good service.

Don't bother."], ["Kevin C.", "Sisson Ave Pizza pretty much has a monopoly on late night (after 1am) delivery in West Hartford. I couldn't imagine ordering from here on a normal night when their are plenty of other spots. Since they are known as a \"pizza house\" we always seem to order the pizza. It's pretty gross. Very greasy and I always think the sauce tastes like ketchup. I just about gave up on this place until I tried other things on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised at their grinders and pitas. Word to the wise, if you're home from the bar- skip the pizza and get yourself something else on the menu. You're going to order no matter what, right?"], ["Laura F.", "Its not the tastiest pizza in the world, but I'd say its the tastiest pizza in the neighborhood. \u00a0 I do like it. \u00a0I've had Sisson Pizza deliver to my house many times, but its really good at being a late night snack. \u00a0The restaurant is usually busy with the post-bar crowd between 2-3am, so you may get some free entertainment with that slice."], ["Joe R.", "The longest that I've ever waited for a pizza. Its not like their pizza is anything to rave about either. I'll never order from sisson ave pizza again."], ["Sara L.", "A divinely suitable amount of grease/chees/sauce for post Half Door beer induced cravings of the pizza variety. \u00a0Walk across the street and get yourself some. Go now."], ["J P.", "Too bad I can't rate Sisson Ave pizza zero stars. A couple friends & drunkenly ordered pizza to our Hartford hotel room at 2am. It hadn't come by 2:30 so we called again and were told it was on its way. Long story short, they never came. Assholes! Whatever, we probably didn't need pizza at 3am, but that's not the point!"], ["Michael C.", "Full menu open late, so great stop after drinks. They sell by the slice so always good for a quick bite aswell. Prices a touch on the high side."], ["B. W. P.", "Solid Pizza for the price. Thin dough with a nice, medium crust. \u00a0Just the right balance of cheese. \u00a0They sell slices. \u00a0Check this place out and decide for yourself. \u00a0Just moved to the area (Hartford - West End), and this has been our favorite place thus far."], ["Aleesi W.", "From previous reviews, it looks like the dine-in experience isn't that great, but sometimes, that's just how an establishment works (trust me, I know a pizza place back home with the shittiest service-check my reviews-the dining area is always empty but they're constantly delivering because the pizza is amazing). \u00a0So this review is for their delivery service, which I utilized on allmenus.com and their food.Delivery: I ordered it for a future delivery time of 10:30pm instead of ASAP and got a knock on my door at exactly 10:30pm. Great, because I was starving and they came right on time (I usually find most deliveries to be late, even if slightly).Food: I'm usually very wary about ordering fries for delivery because fries tend to end up being luke-warm and soggy...but I was VERY impressed when I opened up the Styrofoam to-go box, finding my fries hot, crisp, and barely greasy. LOVE. I had ordered the double bacon cheeseburger deluxe which comes with fries and cole slaw. Didn't try the cole slaw, and the burger pretty standard...meaning good, but nothing spectacular. Seeing this is a place for pizza, I'm just happy they have lots of other foods to choose from since I didn't want pizza-I was really making bedroom eyes at the grilled cheese...but was craving meat therefore going with the burger. Also, I ordered the chocolate cake...absolutely delicious. Might be too sweet for some but I'm a big sugar junkie so it was perfect. A good-size single slab of thick, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate cake with chocolate chips and frosting. Overall, the delivery is prompt, the prices are good, and the quality of food that I ordered was excellent. I do plan to order again and try other things on their menu."], ["Julian W.", "I have never eaten there but I had them deliver me food probably over 100 times last school year when I still attended the University of Hartford (luckily I escaped). \u00a0Not sure why the people are saying the customer service was bad, maybe because they weren't getting it delivered to a University and the delivery people didn't know where they were going. \u00a0All I know is that my food was always on time, sometimes earlier than expected and the people would be patient if they got their early and wait for me to run across campus to meet them. \u00a0Everyone at school loved Sisson's because they had the \"best food for the drunchies and the munchies,\" and that's someone else's quote not mine. \u00a0 Though the pizza was great, it's the calzone to blows everything away. \u00a0The large one is crazy big and can feed many people or one person for a few days. \u00a0If you are a university student don't hesitate on getting food delivered!"], ["Ben K.", "Solid pizza, and one of the few places where you can pick up a slice in the area. At $2.50 its a pricey slice, but the fact that its about the size of a German Shepard offsets any complaints. Food is fresh, simple (pizza doesn't need too much make up), not overly greasy and comes at an honest price. I have never had any reason to complain about service, though apparently this has been a problem for others. I live around the corner and usually call an order in to pick up or just pop in for a slice, so my experiences may be different than yours. Sisson Ave Pizza is right across the street from a Subway Sandwich shop and makes the $5 foot long all but obsolete."], ["Ali K.", "You know what Sisson ave was always there for me in college, after a late night of partying, a road trip, or if I needed some food to keep me going for finals. It was normally the first place I turned to call. I would usually get one of the pizza specials with wings and then my favorite the chicken fingers with fries platter. Also a hidden gem that they have, get the fried dough madddd good, I normally order delivery from them, I've been there once late night when I was bored and it was a little bit of a troop. They deliver until like 3:45 am and they close at 4. Soooo sick!"], ["Rolf L.", "Service is always good, delivery is quick, and the pizza is decent. Usually cooked just right. The party size is freakin' huge. Great for late night post drinks. If you live in downtown Hartford, you must have there menu in your drawer. \u00a0they deliver! Not nessasarily a place to seek out if not in the area, but a local staple none the less!"], ["Brynn C.", "Not bad pizza. \u00a0Right on the corner from me, so convenient. \u00a0We got it with feta and bacon, so it was a little salty, but the crust was delicious. \u00a0It really didn't stand out as fantastic, but it was good solid pizza. \u00a0Will probably go again :)"], ["Jeff D.", "This is like the first 1 star rating I have ever given. This place was horrible service .I was staying with Star Power Dance Talent Competition for the Hartford Show at the hilton and they had the brochure for the menu for this place. So we thought about giving it a try. The steak and cheese sub was decent, but not awesome! The main problem came the next \u00a0night when my roommate ordered a cheeseburger with NO MAYO. on it. The delivery took quite a while to get up to the hotel and not only that they put Mayo all over the bun when he had specifically asked for them not to. He also said the fries weren't that good. Anyway he called the manager up to tell them about their mistake and ask for his money back and/or another sandwich to be made and delivered and the guy who claimed to be the manager yelled and cursed at him using four letter words and such and claimed that it was CHEEESE on the bun and not MAYO. That was a load of Crap, we could smell the mayo on it and it was definitely NOT CHEESE. Anyway he kept hanging up on him and wouldn't offer to make a new sandwich or give his money back which most legitimate pizza shops would do if the customer calls and has a complaint about the food. I called back and tried to help by asking him why he runs his business like this and why he can't give the money back and or make a new sandwich? He cursed at me as well screaming like a maniac . I can only imagine what customers in his shop were thinking hearing him scream at me like that over the telephone like a crazy man.Anyway I will never try this place again. I tried Pietros pizza the next night and had no problems Food was great and they had lots of choices, fast efficient service and delivery Whatever you do, STAY AWAY FROM SISSONS."], ["Candice L.", "I don't even want to rate this place the customer service is horrible, I just had voice experience because I couldn't even believe what was going on, and I'm from SE WASHINGTON DC.

The service let out late and we were serving so the front desk recommend this awful place where the man over the phone taking my order was so rude and on top of that my came up to $44.95. And man got my order all wrong. I ask for cheese on the steak and cheese No cheese. I asked for a Tuna Club and I got a Turkey Club and the Pizza was soggy just nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So when i called back to speak with a manager it the same guy who by the way kept calling baby and I told him to stop don't! posed as the \u00a0manager but he wasn't. Still with the same crappy attitude want me to give the turkey in exchange for the tuna!!! I told the front desk and throw away all the circulars.
