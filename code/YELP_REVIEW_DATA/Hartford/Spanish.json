The food was excellent, as were the drinks. My only caveat is that the tapas are very large portions for tapas. We ordered 4 for two people and it was way too much food.I had the jalapeno mango margaritas and my husband had the strawberry rhubarb margaritas (a special). Both were delicious and seemed like a decent portion. \u00a0For tapas, we had the fries (a huge portion!), the fried calamari, the spicy pork ribs over Moroccan couscous, and the mussels with chorizo in a tomato broth.

When they first opened I had coworkers rave about how great it was. Based upon what I had been hearing, I decided to give it a try. I went both times during happy hour. The first visit was a disappointment to say the least. I sat at the bar and the entire time I had to listen to the owners girlfriend bitch about everything and anything. She made it clear she was apart of the staff while she was in the process of their conversation. She happened to be gossiping with one of their distributor friends. Mind you, I have no connection to these people and I was able to pick all of this up during my time at the bar. It was very unprofessional and obnoxious. My cocktail...was okay, at best. I ordered a couple of the different happy hour tapas. The meat and cheese plate was decent. The tapas I enjoyed most was an eggplant rollatini with goat cheese and hazelnuts. But I didn't have anything that made me want to return because it was notably delicious. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. The decor was clean and modern. The service was decent and it wasn't the worst experience I've had. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."], ["Audrey K.", "So Tapas are a \"no-grey-area\" type of food for me. \u00a0It must be absolutely done right. \u00a0I don't expect elaborate garnishment or colorful arrays of plating (which would be nice). \u00a0I do expect small plates, cooked-to-tender meat/seafood, and a good balance of sweet and savory. \u00a0Majorca's tapas are a bit too much - too much sweet on the bacon wrapped dates, too much savory on the grilled pork ribs, too much dry on the spicy pork meatballs, and lastly, too much of everything on size. \u00a0It was nice to sit outside on a warm summer evening, but the outdoor seating area is right by a busy street. \u00a0There were cars blasting loud music - strangely parked right across the street, sometimes right in front of the restaurant - and some people yelling profane words across the street to each other. \u00a0It was all too entertaining that all heads were turned streetside with plates left to turn cold (Ok, now I'm exaggerating a bit). \u00a0 I feel horrible giving a fairly new restaurant only 2 stars, especially since the staff seemed really nice, but I have to rate with all things in mind. \u00a0And the quality of food is pretty heavy on this scale. \u00a0I'm forced to give Majorca another chance with a $20 for $30 deal I purchased on the fly and forgot to redeem. \u00a0Maybe I'll try it out for lunch and sit inside this time."], ["Westie W.", "It was Sunday night over Labor Day weekend so in retrospect I have to wonder if the chef had taken the night off. \u00a0My wife and I arrived at about 5:30PM and proceeded to the bar for happy hour. \u00a0On entering we noticed a sign over the bar indicating the happy hour was limited to weekdays. \u00a0Not a problem, but the restaurant's website does not make note of this.We were soon presented with a list of specials plus the regular menus while ordering Mojitos. \u00a0Our drinks soon arrived and I knew we were in trouble as each contained but a single sprig of mint as garnish with no evidence it had been muddled. \u00a0I did not witness our drink being made by our server, there being no dedicated bartender this evening, prepare our drinks, but I believe it is reasonable to conclude a mix heavy in club soda was used. \u00a0I had reviewed the online menu plus diner reviews beforehand so I ordered our entire meal upfront asking to have it delivered in order of preparation. \u00a0First was La Playsita, a salad of baby spinach, artichokes, roasted garlic, tomato confit, shaved fennel, orange segments and sherry vinaigrette. \u00a0The portion size was generous, but it was over dressed and the individual ingredients did not come together well so much of it was left uneaten. \u00a0 Next were two tapas plates - Datiles Rellenos - dates stuffed with chevre and almonds, wrapped in bacon and Berenjenas Rellenas con Queso - goat cheese stuffed inside slices of baked eggplant that were topped with hazelnuts and a roasted pepper sauce. \u00a0Once again the portion size was generous, but the flavor of the latter dish was inexplicably of one note while the dates proved to be highlight of our meal. Our last dish was Caldo Andaluz - rice slow cooked with mussels, clams, chicken and chorizo in a smoky paprika broth. \u00a0This dish again featured a generous portion of protein, but the broth was under seasoned, the chicken dry and the chorizo bland. \u00a0Based on this admittedly single experience, I came away believing this chef is way too conservative in his blending of ingredients and spices."], ["Erica K.", "Majorca is amazing. The food is fresh, delicious and fun. My best friend and I came for dinner -- we were craving sangria! The white orchid sangria is delicious. It is made with peach pur\u00e9e and pineapple and it comes with a pretty orchid flower. Such a beautiful touch.We weren't super hungry so small plates was perfect for us! The striped bass with spicy rice was phenomenal. I haven't had spicy in a while and I am so glad we got this! \u00a0We also got the chicken empanadas swimming in delicious goat cheese, and the shrimp in garlic. All were delicious.The best part about Majorca (besides the food and drink) is the owner Rich. He is super friendly and nice and makes you feel comfortable. I really enjoyed his company and love how he makes you feel welcome.Can't wait to come back!"], ["Ashika B.", "Majorca is located where the old O'Porto Restaurant used to be. The decor still leaves a little bit to be desired but the tapas are outstanding! This is easily my new favorite Spanish restaurant in Connecticut. Their Pato Con Lentejas (Duck Leg Confit), Gambettas Con Ajo (Shrimp) and Mejillones Salteados (Mussels) are my favorite tapas. The tapas portions are quite generous. Everything is savory and delicious, with all the authentic flavors of the Mediterranean. The service is always great also and from what I can tell there are several social events hosted here as well. I would definitely consider hosting a birthday or other celebration here."], ["Sebastian C.", "Wow...

The dinning area is cozy and open, only 5 or 6 other tables were filled. We were quickly seated and the waitress was friendly enough to recommend some of their signature dishes (Tapas) to my friend and I (completely new to this place and style and had no clue what to order :D )Neither my friend nor I really had the appetite for a big meal, so have asked for something light.We decided to have the shrimp tapa and the ribs tapa right off the bat and we have also decided to have the entree that had seafood and tomatoes sterfried with rice.In addition to these three dishes, we were fortunate enough to have some of the scallops prepped for tonight's service with the chef coming to the table and explaining the texture and the seasoning of the dish to us (it was originally served with eggplant and I hated it so the chef came out to walk us through the possible substitutes; very friendly and consumer oriented.)The shrimp and the ribs were served first. While the ribs wasn't anything special besides tendered, the shrimp was excellent. It was fresh, well seasoned, and cooked perfectly (great texture)!The scallops was even better - fresh, juicy and heated perfectly. The sourness of the cucumbers and onions fits perfectly with the scallops. It wasn't overlooked, burnt, or overwhelmed with alcohol, unlike some other restaurants in the Hartford area. 10/10!The seafood entree, however, was a little disappointing. It was still well prepared, unfortunately, it was slightly too sour and too heavy seasoned in my opinion. Not something that I personally like but I am sure some diners certainly would enjoy it.Up to this point the meal was great and we have decided to have some desert.The cheese cake, like it was described by the waitress, rich, cheesy and smooth. It's definitely one of the best in the area!The mango tart that I had, however, was barely on par with today's meal. The tart itself was too hard and thick, which makes part of it hard to chew. The sorbet on top along with the mango in the tart was nice though.Overall: 4.5/5Highly recommended and definitely would visit again :)"], ["Marcie G.", "We had a fabulous dinner here. \u00a0Shared 6 tapas (actually took 2 home as they were very generous in size) and enjoyed all of them. \u00a0Our server (Michael?) was so attentive and did not seemed bothered by all of our questions and special requests due to allergies. \u00a0We will definitely return."], ["Zoila V.", "Went here for dinner before a play at The Playhouse. I was really excited to try it based on other reviews and the hype built up around it.

Especially the cocktails, I ended up with a glass of Rioja wine, first time trying it! We ordered entrees instead of tapas because we were all hungry and I was going to order a salad to keep it healthy. The food was \"ok\", there was nothing that really wowed me though. The service was a little bit slow when we were ready to pay and had to bring the check up to the be to pay.

Came here With a large group and can answer unequivocally yes. It is true. One of the best new places in the Hartford area. Come here for tapas. About 3 for every 2 people. So many good dishes to choose from with big portions. Biggest hits were the calamari, the ribs (beware though they are spicy), the meatballs and the fries. Though my dining companions loved the mussels (great for dipping bread into the broth) and shrimp too. They had several spring specials while there. We tried the veal sweatbreads with fiddle heads and ramps. Excellent. Service was great and great drinks to boot. We will be back and this is definitely a restaurant not to be missed in the area. Yay!"], ["Jordan S.", "The food was very good, albeit a little pricey. Make sure to pick up the coupon from yelp and also for an additional discount, check in to yelp while paying your bill.

The owner was standing at the front greeting us and we chatted with him while we waited for a table. Our waitress was lovely (even if she was flirting with my partner a bit, ha!) and she took great care of us. We ordered some wine and about six tapas many of which were specials that night and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of all of the food. Dessert was great, probably my favorite part.

The sauvignon blanc was ok ($5). The food deals are small, but they are bound to be tasty. Dinner was quite good and very memorable. Interestingly, the specials they had were the most memorable to me: an asparagus and prosciutto starter and chorizo bread with greens on top. Delicious. The shrimp ceviche was ok; if you want something fishy, the anchovies were surprisingly delicious - simple, elegant, and succulent. Skip the short rib; it was ok, but I think the biggest bang for your buck is in the tapas. Their version of an Old Fashioned was a little disappointing. Our waitress, Zoe, was super cute and friendly. She made the experience quite delightful.Ambiance is simple, not particularly Spanish but fits the essence and classiness nicely.

There's about 20 tapas total, as well as some similarly priced salads, and a handful of actual entrees. This structure makes me feel like I'm having the full experience.Everything was great. Personal favorites included the ribs, the meatballs, and the exquisitely simple papas fritas, with truffle oil and Manchego cheese. These ain't your Mam\u00e1's French fries.Only suggestion would have been to make that salad a little bigger. I expect small portions for tapas in the $6-12 range, but I think you can make a slightly bigger $9 salad and not see it appreciably affect your profit margin.We got a wonderful bottle of Spanish wine (The Las Rocas El Renegado Red Blend), which was $30... sadly typical for a restaurant bottle.

My friends and I have been eagerly waiting to pay a visit since it's grand opening in January. I'm bummed we didn't go earlier because it's worth all the hype. Impeccable service, a delightfully new and authentic cuisine, and the beautiful space in between make Majorca a cool spot locals from Hartford should really check out. To start, we decided to come early for the happy hour. From 3-6pm, you can snag mojitos, margaritas, featured wines, and local artisan craft beers for $5 while coronas and estrella drafts are $4. Come early because while the cozy bar area has a handful of tables, there are only a number of seats at the bar so it can get crowded, quick! When we were finally seated for dinner, we all got a round of the old-fashioned, spicy cucumber margarita, and white sangria from the specials menu (good stuff!). For tapas we had the Cape Cod mussels with chorizo, littleneck clams in garlic and white wine with salsa verde, and the grilled octopus with butter beans and Spanish olives. Everything was beautifully arranged, innovative, fresh, and delicately prepared. I was feeling bold and decided to order off of the \"Bocatas y Platos Mas Grande\". Went with the \"carne con huevos\": grilled and spice rubbed hangar steak with roasted potato and prosciutto and topped with a fried egg and saffron basil sauce, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!With Latin jazz every Sunday (3-6pm), paint night every Tuesday and free salsa group lessons on Wednesdays, Majorca is definitely happening right now. With plenty of parking options (on-street, private lot), parking isn't an issue.

There were a good amount of tables filled for a Tuesday night, I was impressed! I never went to O'Porto when it was open, although I heard it wasn't great, but I really liked the exposed brick and pretty light fixtures inside Majorca. So my first impression was very positive based on the interior and how popular it was (especially midweek).Ordered a drink (I got the white sangria with peaches and pineapple and my dad had a glass of wine) and got 4 tapas for the two of us:- Sardines- Grilled octopus & beans (pulpo y frijoles)- Pork meatballs (albondigas)- Poached artichokes with vinegar on themThe sardines were fantastic, but the portion was reeeeally tiny, the artichokes were 1 large artichoke heart cut into 4 pieces served cold with vinegar and a little bed of arugula, the grilled octopus was probably my favorite, but the pork meatballs were small and there were only 3. After eating the 4 dishes we ordered 2 more, the Pan Catalan and the Shrimp.The garlicky shrimp were good (and there were 6 in a serving, more reasonable for the price I thought) but the bread in the Pan Catalan was stale French baguette...unimpressed...the manchego was good and the tomatoes were too but the bread threw it off for me.The service was extremely slow throughout, although the waitress was extremely nice and helpful when she came to our table. Also the only tapa dish that I saw coming out of the kitchen that was not extremely small was the heaping plate of glorified French fries.

The Majorca team has created an ambient tone like that of a hip lounge in Ibiza, Spain. The Mediterranean cuisine is offers central Connecticut with something different, and is masterly designed and prepared by the renowned chef and CT native Chef Bernie Gorski.Price is a major competitive force for Majorca. The tapas, despite using fresh, local, and imported artisanal ingredients, are priced at an average of $10.00 per plate. Premium drinks are masterly prepared for $5.00 during their happy hour, and their lunch menu is quick and affordable yet authentic to Majorca's Mediterranean theme. Though inexpensive Majorca is far from cheap, but is more elegant and modern.Majorca has quickly developed a popular reputation. In the short nine months that it has been open, Majorca has already been recognized as one of the top Portuguese and Spanish restaurants by CTNow's \"Best of Hartford Readers Poll 2015\". Salsa dance lessons, paint night, and Latin jazz are just a few of the crowd attracting events that Majorca has to offer on a weekly basis. This popularity serves to improve the culture of Hartford in a major way."], ["Dhara S.", "We had the outdoor patio to ourselves when we went on Friday for birthday drinks and tapas.

Now, Majorca, please go teach that to the other restauranteurs who struggle with that concept. I was there for a friend's party which meant basically a ton of people in a small room. If the waiter had forgotten a drink, it would have been totally forgivable, but as far as we could see, everything went perfectly. I had not planned to eat there, just have a glass of sangria and chat. My partner ordered the Alcachofas Marinadas and Papas Fritas, and I ended up poaching from his plates. Both were good, but the fries with garlic, truffle oil, and manchego cheese were the favorite. My glass of red sangria arrived wearing an orchid! I love that they did not totally gut the former O'Porto space. Too many restaurants waste money doing this when the interior was perfectly fine already.

Strange they are out of so much when they just opened. Ordered several Tapas items, 3 per person and they had a nice presentation and were very good.

From the specials we ordered zucchini fritters - i didn't like it s much, My husband loved it. I thought it was too salty and yes I understand because of Gorgonzola cheese but then give something else \u00a0with it to take a note down.

Came for dinner with two friends and we first ordered the pan Catalan and papas fritas to share. The bread was ok, grilled and topped with roasted veggies, but nothing special, and the size was shockingly small. The papas fritas were just regular skinny frozen french fries tossed with garlic and truffle oil. I was expecting actual potatoes, roasted til crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, as I have had at other tapas restaurants - throwing french fries into fancy oils does not make it a nice dish. I've had these exact same fries at Capital Grille... an American restaurant, which is where they belong.Still starving, we each ordered salads that, when arrived, were nothing more than a small bed of spinach topped with what appeared to be canned artichokes, fennel and a few messy fruit segments, tossed with a dressing so vinegary it was hard to finish. There were so few vegetarian options that we couldn't really order much else, not that we wanted to.After that and two glasses of wine each, our bill came to almost \u00a0$120 and we were all still hungry. The service and atmosphere was fine, and our server was kind, but the wine was probably the only enjoyable thing about the meal. If this place paid more attention to quality and authenticity, I'd happily pay for a great meal, but at this point I won't be back."]], "On20": [["Mari K.", "I finally made it to On20! I'd been meaning to come here for so long, and finally did it this past round of Taste of Hartford. I will definitely be back, and will update my review to include a non-Restaurant-Week experience. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to park, since I hadn't realized you could use the lot beneath the building and have the parking validated by On20. We did this, then took at elevator up a few floors to the lobby and a second elevator up to the 20th floor. I'll admit, it wasn't until I hit the elevator button for the 20th floor that the Restaurant name made sense :) We walked in, and were immediately greeted by friendly hostesses and a sophisticated, sexy atmosphere.The dark grey walls and artwork with the rich wood tones were instantly welcoming. There's a coat rack when you first enter, and the restrooms are to the immediate left. Direct ahead is the bar area, which is smaller than I had envisioned, but with a really nice open feel. If you sit near the windows, you get a marvelous view of the city of Hartford. The waiters are super attentive, and there is a knowledgeable wine sommelier, which I always appreciate. We opted for an older rioja, which was reasonably priced and seemed interesting. The sommelier was really attentive, and when he noticed some dish soap spots on my glass he immediately replaced it with a sparkling one. The food was great. We started with the lamb meatballs and the roasted root vegetable salad, both delicious. For entrees we had the prime rib shepherds pie and the skate. I thought the shepherds pie was good, but the skate dish was the real winner- the flavors worked perfectly together for an overall great experience. For dessert I opted for the lime mini doughnuts, and they exceeded expectations (and what a perfectly-sized dessert portion!). I peeked at the bar menu, and would love to come try happy hour and a few items off of that menu. Of course, I also look forward to future delicious dinners here."], ["James S.", "We came here on Sept. 12 for my mother's birthday dinner because this restaurant has received a lot of good buzz. Perhaps some folks would view On20 as one of the best restaurants in the Hartford area, but my experience did not live up to the hype. Any restaurant that touts its status as \"The only Connecticut restaurant with a 29 Zagat Rating for service\" better deliver, but this place fell pretty short of that mark. Here are my issues:--server took a long time to acknowledge our presence after we were seated by the hostess--cocktails took a long time to arrive--bread was cold--amuse bouche of julienned tomato with green hummus was kind of pathetic--when asked how the porcelet entree was prepared, the server was totally clueless--when clearing our table, the bus staff touched the rim of my father's drink in order to move the glass; this is improper technique; glasses should be moved by the base or the side so that the rim of the glass remains sanitary for drinking--when the bus staff cleared our first course, they mistakenly removed a fork without replacing it; then when the entrees came out, the server departed too quickly before we could raise the issue regarding the silverware; it took me a while to flag someone else down to get us a new fork; in the meantime, our food got cold--water glasses were never re-filledIt wasn't all bad, though. On the positive side, my father really enjoyed his porcelet entree even though he kind of took a leap of faith when he ordered it. And the drink menu was varied, with the cocktails made well. But what I'll take away from this experience was how much of a discrepancy there was between the service level expected and the service level received. Not even a mention of \"happy birthday\" or anything like that, despite the fact that it was mentioned in the OpenTable reservation. And there was an automatic 20% service charge included in the bill, which was difficult to swallow. Better options elsewhere."], ["John S.", "This place is kind of like a roulette wheel, some of their offerings are good, some aren't and for what you pay it leads me to believe I won't be back here. We went here for Hartford's restaurant week and we ordered a couple extra items. Their appetizers; Terrine, Chowder and Agnollotti. The Terrine was good, the Chowder ok and the Anollotti was ok too. The sauce for the Agnollotti just didn't really pack that much flavor and the chowder was rather flat as well. For dinner we had the Ribeye and the Chicken. The Chicken dish was very solid, and the Ribeye was cooked perfectly, but there were 2 sauces on the Ribeye plate (one was \u00a0probably an au-jus and the other was probably pureed squash). I say probably because both of them were tasteless so I couldn't really tell and added nothing to the dish. Finally for dessert we had the blueberry crumble and the Caramel Peach. The crumble was fine, but the peaches were rock hard and totally lacked any sweetness. The sauce that accompanied the peaches was tasty, but since the peaches are the star of the dish they should have been prepared better. Pro tip, if you had cooked the peaches IN the sauce I guarantee the peaches would have softened right up and been fantastic (as opposed to putting the peaches on the plate raw and having them detract from the dessert).The service was good, the manager made the rounds and talked with all of his guests. I think this place has alot of potential so I may be back again, but it can be improved upon."], ["Tanisha C.", "When I dine in the Hartford area, I manage my expectations. \u00a0There have only been a handful of restaurants over the years that have been standouts (e.g. Acqua, Glas (both closed)). \u00a0I personally have never been blown away and it's rare that a restaurant in the area offers something innovative. So when I dined at On20, I was pleasantly surprised.I took my mom to On20 for a pre-Mother's day/early birthday dinner. \u00a0First, getting into the restaurant was a little confusing (we entered at the Columbus Ave entrance) and entrance was initially locked. \u00a0Some signage indicating exactly where to find the restaurant would be helpful. \u00a0As soon as you enter the restaurant, you're captivated by the view. \u00a0After living in New York for eight years, very few skylines are remarkable. \u00a0But the view at On20 is so excellent, that you can forgive the fact that it's Hartford. \u00a0The restaurant was dim, creating an intimate atmosphere, and a great juxtaposition to the expansive view.The service was great. \u00a0Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. \u00a0The general manager (I think) checked on us frequently and made polite conversation. \u00a0When our main course was taking a bit long, he offered to comp a glass of wine. \u00a0Now the food . . . everything was tasty. \u00a0The portions were fair, and not overly filling. \u00a0The flavors were subtle and the curious coupling of flavors and textures were like a never-ending happy dance in my mouth.We had: (1) the Peekytoe Crab; (2) the Swiss Chard salad; (3) Duo of Pork; (4) Muscovy Duck; (5) Orange Creamsicle; and (6) the Banana Bread.The Peekytoe Crab was refreshing and the melon was a nice accompaniment. \u00a0The Swiss Chard salad was surprisingly good -- I honestly hadn't had raw swiss chard before this dinner.The Duo of Pork was the low point of the meal for me. \u00a0I love pork . . . deeply, but there was something weird about the pork shoulder. \u00a0I can't put my finger on it, but the texture was more like a pate and certainly not what I expected. \u00a0The Duck, on the other hand, was amazing. \u00a0And I would highly recommend it.We started out with my mom having the Banana Bread and I having the Orange Creamsicle (I'm on sure of the exact names), both were effectively deconstructed versions of their titles. \u00a0The Creamsicle was light and refreshing, but once I tasted the Banana Bread, I had to order another for myself. \u00a0Overall, an amazing experience and I highly recommend On20."], ["Lindsay S.", "It is with great sadness that I right this review. Many years ago, this place was one of the best restaurants I had ever been to in CT. The service was impeccable and the cuisine was innovative and delicious. Those days are behind us. We had been wanting to go here for quite sometime, because it was such an experience the last time we came here. We finally picked a day to go, and dressed up in our sunday best and had hungry stomachs in preparation. We were greeted by a very kind hostess, who sat us near the window so we could look out over Hartford. As soon as we sat down, the Ma\u00eetre d came over and took our cocktail order. 30 minutes later, we had our cocktails. I understand there are a lot of other patrons in the restaurant, but 30 minutes is a bit of a stretch. But I wasn't going to let that deter me. As the appetizers and main courses came and went, I realized they were not as memorable as some other expensive meals I have had, and a wave of disappointment \u00a0came over me. While they were good, they weren't something I would order again. While the cocktails and meals were commendable but forgettable, the service and the desserts are probably what made this a two-star experience. \u00a0The waitress was unresponsive, slow, and kept making mistakes that could have easily been avoided. My husband ordered a $17 glass of wine, and when she came over to pour him the glass, I noticed the bottle said \"Estancia\" on it. Most people know this brand, and that it's about $10 at the liquor store. When I questioned her, she admitted it and said they did not have the bottle of wine he requested. First off, this is a BIG NO NO. You need to come over and tell the customer that particular wine was not available and give them some other suggestions. \u00a0Next, the desserts came. My husband ordered a cheese plate with honey, and you could just about carve a knife into the honey it was so hard. I asked for hot chocolate; the result was a water glass filed with what tasted like chocolate milk with whipped cream on top. When you go to an expensive restaurant like this, you expect a certain level of service and execution in the cuisine, and it was definitely missing throughout this evening. Even the Ma\u00eetre d admitted the service could have been better. I will not be going back anytime soon, unless they do some drastic changes to their menu and service."], ["Emily C.", "I've been to ON20 countless times since my first visit and can confidently say that you receive the same exceptional level of service whether opting for a ten course tasting menu with wine pairings or a simple drink and bite at the bar.The restaurant has seen many changes over the last several years, including Jeffrey Lizotte taking the well deserved lead as Executive Chef. By adding a happy hour and carefully crafted bar menu (the best kept secret in Hartford), in addition to an affordable bistro-style lunch, ON20 now seems more accessible to people who thought they'd have to drop a few hundred on a meal. Happy hour cocktails (sazerac, blood & sand - nice classics) are $6 and house wines and beers are just $3 each. The bar menu is both simple and exceptional with $6 duck confit bbq sliders, truffled risotto balls, burgers and a Waldorf salad, to name a few selections.ON20 has also started hosting events here and there including a high-end BBQ on the night of Hartford's riverfront fireworks and an upcoming event centered around prohibition-era drinks. Oh, and they validate garage parking!"], ["Lan K.", "This is the perfect place for a very special evening. I came here during Restaurant Week so I got a bit of a steal on the prices but the service and food was still top notch. This is the kind of place where they take your coat, push in your chair for you, place the napkin on your lap, etc. The manager also came by during our meal to check in with us and chat which was very nice of him to do. It helped me feel welcome, in such a fancy place that is usually out of our comfort zone. The normal prices here are quite high but you get great service, a great view, and great presentation in return. They do have parking in a garage right beneath it. You have to get a ticket but they will validate so that it is free. Certainly makes it easier to deal with parking downtown. We ordered a number of things, including the pork belly appetizer and tuna tartare appetizer. Both of them were delicious with the pork belly being very savory and decadent with that caramelized fat. The tuna \u00a0on the other hand was very fresh and light. I got the salmon for my meal and it was delicious and filling. My husband got the lamb, done two ways, which neither of us were huge fans of but admittedly don't eat lamb very often. I also was not a huge fan of my dessert, which was a shortbread cookie kind of dessert. It was very dry. My husband's chocolate cake dessert was very good though. The presentation for all of the dishes was lovely. All in all, a really nice experience and I'd come back for a very special event."], ["Jess L.", "Let me preface this by saying I will likely come back here and plan to re-review, as I have a feeling they were just not on their game.I came for a large, private party, and the bar was totally overwhelmed. There were bartenders going in and out, and I believe some of the upper management staff also were trying to cover the area.However, it took me over 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. There seemed to be only one register, which was the bulk of the bottleneck, but also making the cocktail menu available just slowed everyone down. They also did a subpar job keeping track of who was next in line, as they prioritized other people standing next to me for half the time more than twice.Otherwise, the space is classy, and the view is unique. The other Yelp reviews make it a must that I come back. Nonetheless, I was pretty disappointed and haven't had that much trouble at the bar in a long time."], ["Marisa R.", "I'll start by saying that I'm interested in returning to On20 to get a better idea of their overall menu and service. I went to On20 yesterday with my boyfriend. They called to confirm my reservation and told me they were offering their Restaurant Week menu (awesome, right?). We come to find out when we get to the restaurant that they were ONLY offering the limited menu. Nothing on the limited menu really stuck out to me, I was looking forward to having the venison that was featured on the al a carte menu. All the offerings seemed very earthy and, after having them, very rich. I look forward to spring and summer features at On20 to try some of the lighter and fresher fare that comes with the seasons. At first, service was amazing. The server answered all of our questions and we were very pleased. By the end of our time at On20 we were never offered another round of cocktails or coffee with our dessert. We waited about 20 minutes for our check only to find out that a 20% gratuity was added as a \"service charge.\" \u00a0In my experience in food service, 20% is for exceptional service which I didn't feel I was offered. I'm hoping this is just a fluke that happens during Restaurant Week. All in all, I'm hoping to return in the summer with some higher expectations."], ["Addison P.", "Service was great! Very nice. They charged my iPhone for me. The pictures should do the talking. I had the \"beef.\" It was a pretty hanger steak. They didn't ask how I wanted it which I thought was strange. I tasted the pork. Very tasty. I had the green bean salad. Pretty good when you ate all the bits.Had a lot of the desserts and the cheese platter."], ["Eric H.", "Sigh. Double sigh. I had such high expectations for ON20 after they received glowing 5 star Yelp reviews from my respected Yelp friends Anthony P, Anna E, and the Queen Bee herself our Community Manager Emily C. \u00a0But in doing some additional foodie stalking via the interwebs, I see that their famed celebrity chef Noel Jones had stepped down as executive chef back in Aug 2012. Not to discredit the service side of ON20 in any respect, but the award-winning Jones has been internationally acclaimed for his culinary creativity, vision, and expert technique at executing haute French cuisine and it's the food that brought them to the level of competing for the title \"Best Restaurant in CT.\" And this is not to say that his successor, Jeffrey Lizotte, isn't up to the challenge because the food actually was quite good and executed at a high-level. Based on my personal experience, the night just missed the mark time and time again, mostly on the service front. And to justify a mandatory 20% service charge on every bill, you really expect to be cared for in an exceptional way that should surpass every other restaurants where gratuity is earned and not guaranteed. I overheard numerous tables complain about that mandatory service charge, and in my opinion should be something disclosed to every diner so it doesn't come as an unpleasant surprise to end your meal. To me they seemed understaffed, because the service experience here was extremely lacking especially from a place where people throw out the words \"Michelin star worthy.\" Here is how my birthday dinner at ON20 played out. My father in law was in town and we arrived early at 7:40pm for our 8pm reservation. The very sweet hostess informed us that our table wasn't ready yet, as expected being that it was Friday night and they only serve dinner two nights a week, and graciously offered us to have a drink and wait at the bar. We sat down, the server/bartender acknowledged us and dropped off a drink menu, and then went back to mixing cocktails behind the bar. 10 minutes go by and I still see him furiously running around behind the bar. Another 5 minutes go by and he still hasn't come back to take a drink order from us. Now I get inpatient being that the bar is less than 5 feet away so I get up and order two Manhattans and a round of water from the other bartender. Another 5 minutes go by as she mixes up the drinks and it wasn't until 20 minutes after we sat down that we got our waters and cocktails all brought out at the same time. 20 minutes for water seems a little ridiculous to me, especially at a fine dining establishment that prides itself on service. We proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. I did appreciate that the hostess did acknowledge us and was apologetic for the long wait, but we didn't sit down at our table until 8:40pm. Not a great start.We knew coming in that the three of us wanted to go the tasting menu for this special occasion dinner, so we put that order in pretty quickly and clarified my 9 months pregnant wife had dietary restrictions (no raw food, unpasteurized cheeses, etc.). The amuse bouche of raw oysters came out and one was brought to my wife, thus we had to remind the staff to take this back while we waited for a new dish to be prepared. Another frustrating misstep that shouldn't happen when you're paying $100+ per person and tacking on an automatic 20% service charge.Speaking specifically to the cuisine, each plate was artistically plated but the salad starters were quite forgettable. The one standout before the savory courses was the tapioca and salmon roe dish, that had a unique bubble bursting texture with each flavorful bite. Creative presentation in a well-balanced flavor package. The skate and pork belly were also quite delicious and well prepared, although the portion size wasn't more than a couple small bites. Quite the tease. Honestly, the rest of the dishes were pretty forgettable. I'm struggling to remember the flavors, textures, and ingredients even though I had the meal less than a week ago, whereas I can rattle off each dish and individual ingredients from my tasting menu birthday dinner at Millwrights last year. ON20 just didn't give me that memorable, emotional dining experience that makes eating out so special for me. I'm an admitted food snob and eating well means much more to me than the average American. As with all Yelp reviews, take this one with a grain of salt. I'm the biggest advocate to forming your own opinion in life, but after having recently eaten at so many great CT restaurants (Le Farm, The Whelk, Bar Bouchee, Chamard Bistro, Millwrights) my thinking is that ON20's best days are behind them."], ["Jesse M.", "I've heard great things about ON20. Consistently this venue has been the subject of various 'best of' reviews for Connecticut. I was able to find a Friday evening reservation available for my wife and I.First off, the views are nice, however I have worked in tall office buildings for years, so I was sadly jaded. This did however let me see the decor for what it is, minimal and rather dated.The service was professional and cordial, no doubt a carryover from the restaurants club days for the Miners Association. However the tasting menu we were told was 'tailored per table', this was not the case, each table around us doing the tasting menu received the same set of meals. We even suggested our distaste for foie gras, but still received a foie gras dish!Now the food, by far the shining star. Even though the tasting menu was a sham, the food delivered was small plate haute cuisine. Seven plates with a variety of French and Spanish inspirations. All well prepared and of high quality. The cocktails were on spot, my request for Anejo and Stormy's were carried through and refined even though the bartender was unfamiliar, he took great pleasure in refining the cocktail and even produced homemade ginger beer.In summary, good food, good service, good views. I would recommend this place for anyone in Hartford seeking a formal romantic classic dining establishment. My tips would be to save some money and order individual plates to avoid the chef or tasting menu."], ["V C.", "An awese experience. \u00a0I had a tasting menu and had so much food. \u00a0The experience was worth it, the presentation and food was amazing."], ["Naomi R.", "I would totally go back. The food truly is THAT good. HOWEVER.... there are a lot of things to take into consideration to be prepared for...1. The cost. Yes, it's pricey. And honestly, for the price, the decor and staff could use some improvement. 2. The decor. Yes, it's in an office building, but it still looks like it's in an office building. Very drab, outdated, and I'm 99% sure my grandma has the same curtains hanging up. 3. The staff. Very nice, but very slow. They had no problem taking our plates before we were finished or replacing our cocktails to have our bill become larger, but the time between each course (we did the tasting menu) was insane. After ordering, it took almost 45 minutes for the first course- and it was a salad!4. Getting seated. Hostess looked like she rolled out of bed, with the quality of the meals, they should be actually dressed and stylish. Once seated, it took almost 20 minutes for someone to greet us. Frustrating.5. The view. It's downtown Hartford. Really. And when you're next to the Travelers building... ugh. The food is phenomenal. But, to be perfectly honest, the tasting menu is $80. The tasting menu at Milwright's in Simsbury is $75 and substantially better, with an incredible staff and an atmosphere like no other."], ["Freedom M.", "I had such a great time here. \u00a0The service was top-notch! \u00a0We were treated like celebrities. \u00a0 There were at least 6 people waiting on us, all with character and charisma. \u00a0 The bartender made personalized drinks. \u00a0The wine selection was great- mmm...

They had a dessert that night that was \u00a0a take on a creamsicle which was very tasty but I thought the dessert menu in general was a little bit lacking in creativity compared to the rest of the menu.

We also had the cheese plate (hard to screw up) and the crab app. None of these would be what I consider outside of mediocre. We moved to our dinner table. My husband and dad both got salads. My husbands celery root was not seasoned, nor was it tasty. I didn't try my dads but it didn't look or sound all that special. Our meals were atrocious. My husbands plate literally looked like a fish shit a big slimy white undercooked log on his plate. Mine had three bites of rabbit and cold spetzle. This place is focused way to hard on making the food look s certain way and trying to achieve something they can't. Your left with fussy and truly gross food. With a bottle of wine and 1 round each it was over $500.00. Oh and I almost forgot the amuse bouche - it was a chestnut potage (must be French for thick salty phlegm) YUK!

Inside its actually quite nice and the smell of delicious Greek eats hits you before your bottom hits your seat.There were some very decently priced specials on the large blackboard against the wall, but we weren't in the mood for a platter so decided to stick to the menu. I heard the sangria ($5.95 a glass. $14.95 a pitcher) is yumm so I asked the waitress if the red or white peach is most popular. She said the white is sweet and the red is whiney but they're equally popular. I ordered a pitcher of the white. The waitress came pack a few mins later with the news that they no longer have the peach, but she did bring a sample of he white ginger sangria. Too much kick for me but it was nice of her to bring a sample. I settled on a glass of the red. I like my sangria strong. I figure hey if your gonna waste the calories on a drink, mind as well make it count! This one wasn't strong at all but it was tasty nonetheless. I ordered the gyro ($7.99) and my fianc\u00e9 the falafel (7.99) . I wanted a Greek salad and he wanted fries so the waitress suggest we just make his a plater ($6 extra for fries and salad) to save a few bucks. The food was tasty!

The original is situated in the Elmwood section of West Hartford, while it's baby sister lives in a small strip of businesses on the Northwest corner of Bloomfield Avenue and Cottage Grove Road in Bloomfield.Before I go further, and people start accusing me of playing up the home-town favorites, I want to point out that I had not previously reviewed Tapas because I think that the several reviwers before me had given it justice. the reason I write today is because of the later-evening experience I had this past week. After performing an evening service and concert at our nearby synagogue, my wife and I decided to get a bite to eat. It was already past 9:30pm when we drove up to Tapas. The dining room was dim, and we could only see one other couple in the window as we walked in. We were greeted in a friendly manner by the hostess, who seated us and handed us a set of menus, including daily specials. Our waitress again warmly greeted us and took drink orders. Once she returned, she took our food orders. Both of us opted for a couple of appetizers in lieu of a full meal, considering the time of night. Our waitress - I wish I got her name - took our orders cheerfully, even suggesting chopped bacon for the Tapas Cheez Fries, a large mound of waffle-fries, topped with melted cheddar, and feta cheese, accompanied with \"MADD\" sauce, their spicy redition of ketchup. It was a great suggestion because it added a lot to the dish. I also had their Sherried Clam Chowder, which came with both the expected packet of oyster crackers, and an unexpected handful of pita wedges...and not just any pre-bagged pita. You could tell from the first bite that these were premium. The chowder was a bit different than a typical New England style, with the addition of sherry, and a different combination of spices. Still it was quite tasty, and I did manage to finish it to the last pita-swipe.My wife ordered a side if falafel, and two mini Spanekopeta. The falafel plate had three orbs of yummy garbanzo goodness, smartly spiced without being overpowering. It was accompanied by several pita wedges, fresh made tahini, and Lots of chopped vegetables. The spanekopetas were two perfectly browned triangular pastries of spinach and feta.The two things that struck me about the experience were the fact that, not only was the entire menu available at that late hour, but that the kitchen still put out the effort to make sure everything we ordered was cooked and presented as well as if it were in the middle of dinner. Also, our waitress - the one with the name I can't remember - was so bright and cheerful, yet professional enough not to hover or rush our late dinner and let us enjoy every bite. I did not expect to be treated like such a guest, especially that late (we didn't wind up leaving until about a quarter to eleven). Thank you Tapas, for inviting us and letting us appreciate what you do."], ["Lucy T.", "We went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. VERY disappointing, right from the start we should have known. The parking lot was PACKED and the restaurant was pretty much dead. We realized later everyone was at Ruby Tuesday's. Now, that alone wouldn't normally deter us, our favorite sushi place is usually dead. We started off with drinks, one red and one white sangria, those were okay. We thought okay, maybe this place won't be so bad. Next we ordered our apps and entrees. Again, we should have known. When the waitress (who was actually AWESOME btw) described the 'madd greek sauce' as \"kind of like a ketchup but with a kick\". We ordered the Mediterranean salad platter and falafel for apps. The falafel were okay- very plain, the tahini was probably the highlight of the night, the pita was borderline, mostly soggy but I was starving.The tabouli salad was okay but we've made better at home, the same with the hummus. The hummus had a decent taste but was very watery. The sorta red tabouli looking salad platter item- it tasted like bulgur with BBQ sauce, absolutely disgusting, same with what ever the eggplant chunky salad was. Gross. Another reviewer referred the the mad greek sauce as ketchup and duck sauce but this salad thing was the weird Chinese sweet n' sour sauce...Next were the salads, I don't even know how to say it, the 'almost famous' dressing, nasty. It was basically olive oil and oregano. I'm sorry, according to the bottle that we read while we were waiting for our table to be ready said it was made with canola oil... yikes.After that were the entr\u00e9es, I ordered souvlaki and he ordered the platter which had a little bit of everything. Here is where the dinner got REALLY BAD. His chicken skewer was RAW- like completely pink chicken. They took the plate back to the kitchen and brought it back without the chicken skewer- same plate. Mind you my bf had spit out the raw chicken onto his plate. So anyway, then he tried the gyro meat, it was sliced too thick and had a completely slimy texture. The lamb patties were okay, just bland. My dinner, the souvlaki was basically bad Chinese food. It came out looking like a greek stir-fry. I've had chicken souvlaki before (not here), it was a pita with chicken, lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, that's IT!!!! NO BROCCOLI!! NO GREEN PEPPERS!!! Keep in mind I get really sick when I eat green peppers so if I had known it had green peppers I would not have ordered it. So all in all, this place was awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave this place one star was because as I said before, our waitress was so sweet. I just wish she worked somewhere we actually liked because we'd go just to see her.And as a side note/rant, cheddar cheese, seriously. What greek food has cheddar cheese on or in it?"], ["Christopher S.", "I've been here many times and I never leave disappointed! \u00a0A great atmosphere for a casual to semi formal dining.

No, nachos and cheese fries are not genuine Greek food, but Tapas puts there own twist on these dishes to make them unique and outstanding! \u00a0The cheese fries are waffle fries covered with cheddar jack and, yes, feta cheeses, as well as scallions. \u00a0Dipped into their self titled \"Mad Greek Sauce\", (spicy ketchup) this appetizer is something I look forward to every time I visit.I almost always order the ultimate gyro. \u00a0This comes with either the taziki sauce or the mad Greek sauce or a combination of the two. \u00a0They also offer a choice of meats. \u00a0I always elect for both meats.Great atmosphere, great service, great food at a very reasonable price!"], ["Laura P.", "Great spot for lunch on a recent visit.

I ended up with the falafel platter because it was there. There aren't many places I can get falafel. It came with a generous Greek salad to start and rice on the side.

I haven't had such a bad service experience in a long time. \u00a0The place has a callout for sandwiches (add fries for $2.50). \u00a0So we got the fries. \u00a0We get the bill and the server told us that we didn't say platter (neither did the menu platter isn't mentioned it just says \"No Rice? Add Fries - $2.50\") so we get charged an extra $1.50 per person. I said that is wrong, we ordered the fries. The server said tough. We asked for the manager, the server refused (or the manager refused to come out). \u00a0So we said, hey you screwed up here we will only pay what we owe. He threatened us and told us he would call the cops over $3.00.Obviously this place didn't care about us, our service, or the fact that we just ordered over $40 worth of food and he wouldn't to nickel and dime us for $1.50. . .which we didn't owe. \u00a0Stay away. Go some place that values you as a customer and won't attempt to look for ways to confuse you and dime you for a $1.50.** update 6/12/2010 the waiter was acting without the knowledge/approval of the restaurant.

Everything was done in a timely fashion.The pear salad and the salmon with goat cheese, not to be missed. If you're doing a full tapas night, order them! We decided to have them as appetizers, and share a wonderful seafood paella as the main course. For once, a paella that has just as much seafood as it has rice! Delicious, worth $25, and absolutely enough for 2 if you order some tapas.A really nice orange flan completed the meal.

My boyfriend and I get this regularly at many restaurants and what we got was not what we were expecting. It was very fruity- and by that i mean fruit juice. It was orange in color and very peachy. I'm not a huge fan of peach so I really didn't like it. Stephanie very kindly took it back and off the bill. We opted for martinis after that. I got the cucumber cosmo and my bf got the passion fruit martini ($8 each). Both very good. For appetizer we got the mussels- these were very good. And the bread they give you is also very good its like a baguette, however wish they brought a basket because it was a little awkward having to ask for more bread eAch time. Entrees- the options weren't that appealing. My bf actually said this was the first time he didn't really want anything on the menu. He opted for some chicken and pasta dish because it was the cheapest ($15). He did like it but said it was just good, not great. I of course picked one of the more expensive dishes and a special at that - grilled Bronzino over spinach with mashed potatoes. It also came out with 2 fried stuffed shrimp. The shrimp seemed like an odd accompaniment and i think it was how they justified the $25 price. The fish was good, like really good, but Bronzino is very thin and small. I almost wish they gave 2 pieces and did away with the fried shrimp. I actually gave one of my shrimps to my bf (im not a big fan of battered shrimp- if it was grilled he wouldn't of gotten it) and he tried to give it back after a bite...We also had my bf's daughter who is picky but loves salad so we got her a salad. Stephanie was awesome and ran out like 3 different dressings when the first were not to her taste. Again she deserves 5 stars.Lastly dessert, we got the flan. I didn't like it at all. It definitely didn't taste fresh and the flavor was blah. My bf on the other hand thought it was good, but not the best. Stephanie did bring out complimentary ice cream for my bf's daughter. Again shes awesome.Overall, not bad experience but just ok. After 100 bucks I want to be wowed and I just wasn't.

The women's bathroom had a spider web with a spider in it just chilling over by the toilet...yuck! \u00a0and 2.

Not a lot of parking.The food is mainly seafood, one one or two dishes don't have seafood. I had two apps, the Spanish sausage with beans and fig and the shrimp in garlic sauce. The Spanish sausage impressed me because I had never had it before and the sweetness of the fig sauce balanced perfectly with the sausage. I really liked it even though some of the beans were under-cooked. \u00a0The shrimp in garlic sauce was ok. Large shrimp and a bit of a kick to the sauce but just ok. I had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. I have never had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e before.

The exterior and lack of parking leave a lot to be desired, and only two other tables when we walked in. Always makes me nervous when a place is empty on a Friday night. We were a little early though (5:45p), and the place quickly filled up and overflowed. Also, the restaurant interior made up for the auto repair exterior. It was quaint and rustic.Overall, the meal was quite good. The only miss for us was the crab cake, which was a little mushy and bland. The scallop over a risotto cake was spectacular! Scallops were huge and perfectly cooked. The risotto cake was delicious and offered a wonderful textural contrast."], ["Chelsea O.", "I went here for dinner and overall it was very good.

They serve you a small dish of olives and EVOO and hot, fresh bread that you can dip. After that, they serve the lunch which I ordered Penne con Pollo y chirizo and it was beyond good. My mother ordered the lamb inside of red peppers and said it was also amazing. The service was great, very polite and they always checked on us to make sure we were having a good experience. After hearing so many people rant and rave about El Pulpo, we had to try it ourselves!!!!!! I cannot wait to go back for dinner!!! Also, the Flan and Crema de Catalina for dessert were both so nicely prepared (visually) and were creamy and light.

Let's clear things up this is not a 5 star restaurant and not because of the food because the food is VERY good. \u00a0But when you give out 5 stars you need to have the whole package food, service, ambience and location. This place lacks a couple of these requirements. \u00a0Let's start from the beginning the bread is warm crusty with soft center and the olive oil on the table is high quality Spanish extra virgin, let me say when restaurants offer good bread and olive oil you know your in for a treat. The tapas... Tried the baked goat cheese in marinara sauce excellent!...then the grilled baby squid even better. Then on to the entrees, tried the wild salmon with squid inked rice and fresh veggies... Outstanding! Then penne chorizo and chicken in a cream red sauce very good. I honestly did not have room for desert but they looked delicious. \u00a0I will say this...you will like the food even more when you get the bill, I can't imagine the prices will remain this reasonable for this quality food so you better call for a table quick. \u00a0If you are looking for a romantic night out with your better half go to West Hartford center and pay double the price because you will likely not appreciate this place but if you are into enjoying a fun night out with friends and have a nice meal you will not be disappointed.

I suggest you keep asking, because every dish we had had yummy sauces and juices that i just didn't want to leave behind.Service was wonderfully polite and attentive, though never once was intrusive. \u00a0I haven't felt this well taken care of in a long time. \u00a0I also get the feeling that, if this was your very first time eating tapas ever, the staff would go out of their way to patiently explain everything, ensure you understood, and then made for certain you had an exceptional experience. \u00a0I can't emphasize enough the amount of care and attention to detail.I'll spare you my butchering of the Spanish names of the dishes we had and, instead, just describe what we ate.1) Considering the name of the restaurant, i was determined to order squid. \u00a0I was torn between a special that was stuffed with shrimp, sole, and squid ink sauce, or the classic grilled variety on the regular menu. \u00a0I chose the mainstay, and it arrived at our table sizzling, roughly 2 minutes after it was ordered- literally. \u00a0This is some of the best i've ever had. \u00a0It wasn't actually grilled, but the meat was tender, delicate, and juicy. \u00a0I would come back for this alone. \u00a0It was also a good portion: 3 baby squids along with 3 bodies. \u00a0I was very pleased.2) Chorizo with figs and beans. \u00a0While this was yummy, it wasn't particularly great. \u00a0I'd certainly eat it again, but the sauce was so sweet and tangy that it overpowered the flavor of the chorizo. \u00a0To be honest, i was reminded of hot dogs while eating it. \u00a0And the figs and beans were not quite... present. \u00a0Perhaps they were pureed to make the sauce? \u00a0Like i said, i'd eat it again, but it wasn't the most successful dish of the night.3) Baked goat cheese. \u00a0Holy moses this was fantastic. \u00a0It's served with some herbed toast and, when that was gone, i literally ate the rest with a spoon. \u00a0The cheese was herbed and baked in a pool of tomato sauce, both of which possessed enormous flavor. \u00a0Truly divine.4) Artichoke hearts. \u00a0These were lovely. \u00a0They're billed as 'fried' on the menu, but were really just sauteed in a rich (without being heavy) lemon sauce, studded with sauteed peppers, onions, garlic, and capers. \u00a0This dish was light, bright, and a wonderful example of how satisfying vegetables can be.5) While the pace of the first two courses was perfect, we did wait, quite a bit, for the third. \u00a0Not sure what happened, but it was seriously delicious when it arrived. \u00a0We had pork loin medallions served on crostini, with melty tetilla cheese and pequillo peppers. \u00a0These were perfectly cooked and garnished with balsamic, as well as some herb oils. \u00a0I personally would have liked some heat in this dish, but for the general population, it's perfect as is.For 5 dishes plus 1 glass of sangria and 2 glasses of wine, the bill was a little more than $60 ($75 with tax and tip). \u00a0So, this is not a place for a cheap night out. \u00a0You're going to need a little cash to get the full experience, but it is absolutely worth it.In addition to tapas, they do have large plates, but they run in the $16 to $20-something range. \u00a0That's not affordable for me right now, but i think this place is probably best experienced through its tapas, anyway. \u00a0Service was superb, and i will definitely be back. \u00a0In addition to the dining room, there is also a small bar area with a bartop, as well as some high top tables. \u00a0The place was comfortably busy when we went, and was host to some who were clearly regular patrons.I wish this place the best. \u00a0They have delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, and deserve the following they already seem to already have."], ["Anuj S.", "Look, the place looks very impressive and the service was also fine. \u00a0Things started out fine with nice warm rolls and so forth.For an appetizer we ordered some goat cheese with tomato sauce and bread. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0I think they should kind of offer more bread with it. \u00a0Even for the dinner rolls, they bring out like one per person. \u00a0Maybe I'm just spoiled, but I would just expect them to bring out a small basket with a few rolls in it.Now for the main entree, I was pleased that they offered to make me a veggie paella, even though there was pretty much nothing vegetarian on the menu. \u00a0I don't know why people avoid vegetarian menu items. \u00a0Anyway so I ordered that and it was pretty meh... I'd never had paella before, but according to my friend the rice was supposed to be kind of crispy at the bottom? \u00a0I don't know if that would be crispy or burnt rice, but either way, this paella was just OK. \u00a0Not too flavorful. \u00a0Pretty much bland.I thought what really made it strange was we shared this molten lava cake, and it wasn't even like cake. \u00a0It was like this plasticy shell with chocolate syrup inside. \u00a0Kind of weird to each it that way. \u00a0Definitely not what it's supposed to be. \u00a0They did bring out a complimentary apple-something salad. \u00a0It was just OK."], ["N J.", "After many years of visiting family in this area and eating so many \"so so\" meals in Southington, we decided it was time to consult Yelp!

While my husband is a huge octopus lover, I usually pass on the chewy rubber sashimi in the sushi joints, but THIS is the type of octopus i get excited about. Freshly grilled/charred and tender and mild, and El Pulpo delivered just that! Go with any of their octopus dishes and I am sure you wont be dissapointed.We ordered a couple tapas and shared a seafood paella. Before any of them came out we were greeted with a very warm crusty roll and olive oil, as well as a small olive salad to pick at. One of the tapas was the octopus salad, and yes I would order the octopus by bucket if i could. We also ordered toasted bread with pork tenderloin, piquillo peppers and cheese which was delicious. Even on toasty bread we could eat these in a civilized manner with a knife and fork because everything was nice and tender. We also received a bonus dish on the house (i think since we expressed a love for chorizo) which was some squid ink rice with chorizo and calamari. My husband laughed at me for about 5 minutes because somehow I aquired a squid ink mustache... messy but tasty :)Entree size of the paella was perfect for us sharing after our tapas samplings. Very generous for a single portion to boot, and for $20-25 it is quite reasonable considering ours came with a half lobster and lots of seafood. I was also quite happy the shrimp came with their heads still in tact (since they add a lot of flavor) You can tell this place is kinda paving its own way in the Southington area as there is not much to compare it to. The owner/staff are very attentive to the needs of the customers and seem to be open to adapt to the clientele which is nice.I get really happy when i find gems like this close to home, and I try to do everything I can to make sure everyone else knows so our community doesn't miss out on a great find! My one little bit of criticism... no fresh cracked black pepper on the table, anddd \u00a0the logo outside the restaurant.

We ordered a baked herbed cheese tapa to start, which was covered in a a light tomato sauce. On the fresh bread provided, it was amazing, just bursting with flavor. I ordered the paella, which did not have the signature crust on the bottom, but was still spiced and cooked well. For dessert, we got the orange flan, which was a wonderful treat. I was satisfied and felt amazing, a sign that a meal isn't just nourishment but a \"spiritual\" experience that I think only the Mediterranean cultures can pull off so perfectly. My only complaint was that the waitress waited forever to bring us our bill. The manager/owner came to check on us, and I think he could tell I was annoyed because I was immediately like \"Everything is great.

Had I been just driving by it is likely I would never think about stopping in, but after such good reviews on Yelp and from colleagues I figured I better give it a try. My friend and I, both lovers of Spanish food and wine came in on a Friday night around 645pm. It was busy, but we were seated right away at a cozy table. This place is small and when it is busy it can feel cramped, but in a good and lively way. The tiny bar was fully seated and by the time we ordered a bottle of wine (a really decent pinot noir for $21.) the restaurant was totally full. First, let me say that the service is superb, attentive, and friendly. We were almost immediately presented with a little bowl of delicious Spanish olives in a decadent oil and herb mixture. Shortly after that a waiter came by with a large piece of bread which was easily cut into tree pieces for each of us. The bread was hot and fresh and out of this world! My friend and I decided on five small plates to share. We had the shrimp on a savory chickpea mash, the chorizo and figs (omg), the octopus for which the restaurant is named, a glorious baked goat cheese, and the mussels in a sauce that required asking for a bit more bread because it would have been shameful not to sop it all up! The food was beautifully and thoughtfully served and presented and let me just say it was incredible. Fresh, light, and delicious. My guest and I have both traveled in Spain and felt this restaurant to be one of the most authentic tapas places we have tried in the States. And by the way, all this food, including the bottle of wine came to just over $70.00 to split! We were too stuffed for dessert, but the tray the waitress brought over had a beautiful variety of sweet treats! I cannot wait to take my husband and other friends here.

The interior looks completely brand new and the dining room is very elegantly decorated. The owner of the restaurant himself waited on us, and he really went above and beyond. He was pleasant and humble, and generously offered a free octopus salad appetizer and two glasses of red wine, compliments of the house. The octopus salad was delicious, easily the best dish of the night.We ordered a baked goat cheese appetizer, melty chevre swimming in marinara sauce, with toast for dipping. We devoured it in minutes flat.

Hmmm, what is close? Nothing besides El Pulpo. So we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to see a parking lot full of cars on a Friday night. And about a month into service, that is a super sign!We were brought to our seats by the same waitress as last time. I didn't get a hint that she remembered us even though we were one of their first customers. That was over a month ago so I didn't expect her to.Luckily, now they have their liquor license and credit card machine.This time we stuck to one app. We ordered the chorizo with figs sauce. I wanted to try it. It came in a sizzling clay dish. Very good but a bit on the sweet side for my hubby.Ah the waitress came back and recognized us this time. We exchanged some pleasantries.Here is the surprise: the owner came by and greeted us. He put down a complementary app and said he hoped that this time the octopus salad is made to my liking. How did he know I didn't care for it last time?! I didn't say anything to him or the waitress....oh wait, \"YOU READ MY REVIEW ON YELP!\" I exclaimed. He excused that the sous chef cooked it incorrectly last time because the head chef stepped outside.This time there was no mistake the octopus was \"a la plancha\"! Grilled nicely with some char marks and looked liked grilled slabs of cheese (except with rows of tentacles). It tasted tender (as tender as octopus meat goes), not rubbery at all. Close to the dish I had in Barcelona, Spain. My poor hubby was eyeing my plate. He has fish, cephalopod, and bivalves allergies. Not most shellfish, oddly enough. He spared me the lecture this time on the intelligence of the octopus and I felt his eyes glued on my dish. Uh I thought he had an allergy to squid and he loved octopi too much to eat them. Well, maybe they looked so much like cheese, this cheese lover had to have one to make sure it wasn't a piece of cheese. I gave him the smallest piece, and thank goodness he didnt have a throat closing moment. Last thing I wanted to do was go to the hospital during my favorite meal. After a couple of minutes, I saw a fork come across the table to nab the last whole chunk of octopus. Needless to say he had a slight itchy throat and tongue, but no epipen tales that night. He survived to enjoy the risotto cakes in his scallops entree and I really enjoyed my seafood broth. Something in his sauce made his the winning dish. Our two large profiteroles with vanilla ice cream were good. How generous for only $5!They always say never as good as the first time. Never say never.

At busy times, you may need to be patient as good food takes time to prepare. \u00a0While we can't yet say we have tried everything on the menu, we can state that after five visits, and a desire to always try something new, we have sampled many soups, salads, tapas, entrees, desserts, cafe con leche, and of course sangria, both red and white. \u00a0All of our choices have been consistently delicious and presented in a very artful way. One of our most favorite paellas, the paella negra (black paella made with squid ink, seafood, rice, and a small bit of sherry giving the dish just the right hint of sweetness) is available at lunch only. \u00a0When we had it today, it did not disappoint and for a brief moment we both felt transported to our former home in Salamanca, north of Madrid. What a treat and how lucky are we to experience this great dish along with many others without ever having to board an airplane! El Pulpo's chef trained in Madrid for five years and it shows.Fortunately for us we made our visits before reading any other reviews. \u00a0Most were very complimentary but a few were really very unfair and in some cases, false. \u00a0One reviewer complained that on a busy Friday night without a reservation she was put out that no one explained the menu. \u00a0Each menu entry is clearly translated to English, and one has to wonder why she didn't feel like she could ask her busy server for further clarification if needed. \u00a0Likewise this same person also complained that a member of her party ordered a dish containing fish (as stated in English on the menu) \u00a0and when it was discovered the dish contained salmon, the diner stated they had an allergy to salmon. \u00a0Isn't salmon considered fish? Another person complained that they only received one roll instead of a whole basketful. \u00a0I know in America we are accustomed to certain niceties (like baskets full of rolls and bread), but this is not typical in Spain. \u00a0In addition, why don't patrons ask for more rolls if they would like more? \u00a0Lastly, someone complained about noticing some chipped paint on the wall of the dining room where the chair was being pulled in and out. \u00a0Honestly, we never noticed! \u00a0The dining room is clean, cozy, and much like one you would find in Spain. \u00a0We have been too busy enjoying the great food to notice anything else.If you want really great authentic Spanish tapas and meals we highly recommend El Pulpo. \u00a0You won't be disappointed! \u00a0Buen Provecho.John and Wendy R."], ["Nisha S.", "I would like to start off by saying I was really looking forward to this restaurant. After reading the reviews, perhaps my expectations were too high.Upon walking in on a Friday evening we were greeted by...no one. There seemed to be no hostess, only a waitress that completely ignored us. Yes, the restaurant was busy but it takes a second to acknowledge a patron and she walked by 3 times, even bumped into me. I finally walked into the bar to request a table. After being seated we waited another 20 minutes to place an order. Again it was busy, so that excuses the wait but there was no explanation of dishes,no charisma when they finally did take our order and a clear sign of disappointment when we declined to get alcohol. \u00a0It would have been nice to have suggestions as it was our first time there and the menu is a bit overwhelming. Now for the food. Being a foodie I expected to be satisfied at least with the cuisine as the pictures looked amazing. We started with the Croquetas de Bacalo (cod fish fritters). The presentation was excellent and the Croquetas were tasty. We were also served an assortment of olives which were fantastic and bread which was cold and crusty. Instead of ordering a variety of tapas we decided to order 3 main dishes. Vieiras al la Plancha- Pictured on their website and reviews this dish consisted of fontina cheese risotto topped with seared scallops and lobster in a champagne sauce. It did not live up to its image. The scallops were plentiful and seared to perfection. The lobster was very minuscule and 1 out of the 3 \"chunks\" of lobster meat was terribly over cooked. The risotto was the biggest disappointment; there was no creamy consistency or trace of champagne sauce. The top \"layer\" of the risotto was actually burnt and crusty and it essentially was a serving of cheesy sticky rice which had no flavor consistency and was too over cooked to be helped by the heaping of sauce on the plate. If anyone would have bothered to check in on us I would have sent it back. Cazuela de Mariscos- This dish was a Mediterranean seafood stew with fish, scallops, squid, and mussels over roasted potatoes in a seafood sauce. Unfortunately, the fish was salmon and the person who ordered it is very allergic to salmon. Now if the waiter took anytime to explain the dish this mistake could have been avoided; since it was not, an additional wait to our meal was created. Once served, the dish was certainly not a stew but filled with well cooked seafood in a mildly flavored seafood tomato broth.Fettuccine de Mariscos- Fettuccine with lobster, baby scallops, shrimps, mussels, garlic shallots, and sun dried tomato sauce. For a place that totes culinary excellence it was expected to have fresh fettuccine. The portion was decent and the amount of seafood adequate. This dish had no faults except there was nothing impressive about it.Cut to the chase: The service: amazingly unexceptional. The food: the artful, creative, technique taken in presentation does not carry to the cuisine itself. I would have been inclined to come again to try the food if the service had not been so poor."], ["Gloria B.", "Heard 2 good reviews, so we decided to try it. \u00a0Sat at the bar, and ordered 3 tapas and 2 El Patron margaritas. \u00a0Pleasantly surprised. \u00a0The food was delicious and the drinks even better. \u00a0We will be back with family next. \u00a0Wish they had a better location in downtown Southington. \u00a0Great job. \u00a0Wish them well!"], ["Karen T.", "So, we returned and again had a fabulous experience...this time, however, instead of being the only ones in the restaurant it was completely packed...which is wonderful and so well-deserved for the owner!

They swear by this place, so I knew I had to try it. Our first trip was a little disappointing. We went at 6:30PM, and they had run out of most of the entrees, while the food that they did have was cold from having sat out all day. My fried pork chop was overfried to the point where the meat was chewy and tough. Still, what I tasted had a lot of potential flavor-wise, \u00a0and my friend said that they were much better for lunch, so I knew I had to give them another chance. I went back last Thursday around 11:30AM, and what a difference it made! This time they were fully stocked, and I had no trouble ordering my pernil y arroz con gandules. The pernil was wonderful. It's tender, flavorful, and has just the right amount of heavenly crispy skin mixed in. The arroz con gandules was also delicious. I go nuts for arroz con gandules, and this did not disappoint. For $8, I got a takeout box packed with pork and rice. It didn't look like a lot at first, but I was full after eating half a box, and it easily made 2 meals. \u00a0Just a few complaints: The food is really greasy. Yes, no one expects Puerto Rican food to be diet food, but both times I ate here, my food was sitting in a pool of oil and my lips were coated with grease. Second, I wish they did a real dinner service instead of just selling leftover food from lunch. The food I had the first time wasn't awful; it just needed to be fresher or at least warm. Third, make more pernil! It was my favorite item there, and they sold out so quickly.

Never going back there again."], ["Jena G.", "Woooooooow!! Is Barcelona something to rave about. I came here on a double date on a Saturday night around 9:00. We had a reservation for 8:30 but one of us was running late so we called ahead of time and they were perfectly accommodating. Once we got here we were seated immediately. An impressive feat seeing as the foyer was crowded with a dozen people just hoping to find a table. Once seated, our server took our drink orders. I started with a glass of cava which was inexpensive but good. (Pretty hard to find a bad bubbly, amiright?) It took a long time to be served, however, and we had to remind our server that we put a drink order in. It also took about 25 minutes just to have her take our order. Let me reiterate the fact that this place was bumpin' and filled to max capacity. To start, we ordered the calamari which was incredible. It's so ridiculously tender and likely the best calamari I've ever encountered. I'm also the octopus queen and have travelled far and wide to find a decent calamari, so that's that. We also had the sobrasada which was interesting and not like a typical sopressata I'm used to. It was extremely soft and spreadable, \u00a0and orange in color but still good. We paired it with a mild cows milk cheese which was decent. We also had the patatas bravas which were cooked to a crisp perfection but wayyy too over-seasoned with paprika. We couldn't touch some of those delicious wedges as they were suffocated in spices. Since this place was super busy, our food took forever to come out. I'll admit it, we were all a little antsy. Just as I was starting to formulate a bad opinion about this place for their inefficiency our server brought out our food with some complimentary brussel sprouts and cheesy croquettes. Both were savory but I've gotta show some love for those brussel sprouts. I could go on for DAYSSS about 'em. They were so good I even ordered them again. Meaning, out of choice. They're roasted and crisped in some sort of oil and tossed in salt. It's such a simple dish but they are absolutely delicious. Even if you've loathed brussel sprouts since your mom force fed them to you as a kid (hello) you're gonna love these babies. Take it from me. Since we were still hungry I put in another \u00a0order for a drink while everyone else dined. I have a thing for exotic and inventive drinks so I went out on a limb and got a Pimm-enton. It's got Pimm's, gin, cucumber, mint, lime, and ginger beer. There was also some diced red veggie in it that I can't quite place. Like I said, the drink was potent. ;) Absolutely refreshing and so sooooo yummy. A raving success! I usually discuss ambience first but this place was so on point I've gotta save best for last. Not only is Barcelona an unreal dinner spot, it's also got A+ ambience. The art on the wall is interesting and the mirrors throughout give it a very nuance speakeasy feel. The music was so trendy and trance-y; it wasn't overbearing but it was noticeable enough that after our second drink all four of us were moving and grooving. Since Barcelona had its own DJ and is open until 2 am it embodies this cool trendy New York vibe after 10:30ish. The main dining room gets totally packed and I found it hard to leave after just having dinner. A definite redo!!"], ["Nicholas I.", "I'm a huge fan of tapas after spending a week in the ~actual~ Barcelona, Spain last year. ~This~ Barcelona comes very close in terms of tapas options, and all of the selections I had were fantastic!It took me longer than it should have to visit Barcelona. Typically, I wouldn't think about the place until I was already going to Bartaco. Barcelona is sort of tucked away, hidden behind Bartaco in the same building. It could be sort of difficult to notice the place unless you're actually looking for it, and perhaps that's a good thing.The inside decor is very intimate and somewhat upscale; I almost felt under-dressed in there because I had worn shorts with a nicer button down shirt.All of the tapas were fabulous and I look forward to going back again!"], ["Brian E.", "Probably the best all around meal I've had in the area since moving to CT this year. The service was excellent and the food was unforgettable. Below is a list of the tapas we enjoyed:Beef and Chicken Empanadas: super savory with a perfect flaky and doughy taste. The chicken came with this amazing guacamole and the beef empanadas came with a really good red sauce. Best empanadas I've ever had. Calamari: tender and crispy with a mild yet flavorful breading. The sauce and spritz of lemon elevated them even further. Patatas Bravas: probably the most mouthwatering and delicious fried potatoes I've ever had. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with this red sauce and tangy garlic aioli. I couldn't stop eating these. Hangar steak: just perfectly cooked at a medium rare. Delicious natural flavor with the beef, topped with a truffle sauce. The sauce was a bit over the top, and this is coming from someone who loves truffles. I think it may have taken away from the dish as the sauce just tasted like it was made with a cheap, white truffle olive oil. I'd recommend the sauce on the side so you can apply as much or as little as you'd like. Gambas Ajillo: a little delicious iron skillet of shrimp in a sherry sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and was a nice bite before some of the mains. Fingerling potatoes: very good texture but lacked in overall flavor. The garlic was too mild. I wouldn't waste stomach space on these. Suckling pig: a special tapas they had from a pig roast they had done the night prior. The cut was big enough to serve 4 people. The chicharr\u00f3n was not crispy at all as it was saturated in vinegar and other liquids. It was very tough to chew. The meat however tasted wonderful. There's nothing better than a pig roast!Heirloom tomatoes: salt, pepper, oil, that's it. Very bright and refreshing flavor. Great starter. Bread and oil: very warm crispy crust and soft interior. Oil tasted incredible."], ["Naomi R.", "Been here a few times and after going to the New Haven one last night, decided this one needed a fabulous review!

A lot can be said about their service, food, and drinks list. They also do half off bottles on Sunday! I think Monday too but could be wrong but anyways...Hanger steaks, empanadas, Kim chi pork belly, gamba, and this crazy fried cabbage thing are just a few of their superb tapas to name.

Maybe we are just a bit crazy but it is always a good time and never a dull moment. There is ONE major drawback! This draw back is so horrifying that we refuse to step foot into this restaurant on certain days! When we decide we want our weekly Barcelona fix, we will ONLY show up on Sunday evenings - Wednesday. Thursday, Friday, and especially Saturday nights are full of basics, wedges, cheap tacky Michael Kors loving creatures, foul smelling college hot shots, welfare collecting ballas, and the typical \"we only hang together\" Asian squad! It goes from exceptional restaurant experience to ...what are we in downtown Hartford? Come on ladies...grandma heels? pathetic wedges? \u00a0The same forever 21 dress ten others are wearing? Hate to say it but you ugly basics need to go back to the other side of the river. Extremely obnoxious crowd and degenerates who can't hold their liquor. They congregate around acting like fake baller and dressed like they're ready to pick up a couple basics. Overall, i still adore this restaurant! I dump hundred and hundreds of dollars into here a month and will continue to do so as long as their servers continue to be like those mentioned earlier and food remains excellent."], ["Erica K.", "My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year anniversary so we decided to go to Barcelona. Rebecca the hostess was very nice. We had a bit of a wait so they passed out white and red sangria.The food is excellent. We ordered the speck, Manchego cheese and fuet (sausage). The speck was salty and delicious, the cheese was nutty and the sausage was perfect.The eggplant pappardelle was my favorite. It was spicy and sweet and the roasted red peppers were good. The hangar steak was cooked perfectly and came with a nice sauceWe wanted to end our night with the lobster dish, \u00a0it was lobster with toasted pasta and garlic sauce. For some reason we did not like this even though it had everything we like. We told our waitress Hilary and she offered us something different but we were too stuffed. When we got the bill, much to our surprise the lobster dish was comped. The service is wonderful, we had free champagne to celebrate our anniversary. Hilary was great and we can't wait to go back."], ["Kimberly T.", "Wine flights? Amazing tapas? Great service in a lovely atmosphere? Yes yes and yes!! Barcelona had it all on my recent trip and it's safe to say this is going to be one of my new favorites. It was crowded on Friday night, but we were seated pretty quickly. We started with a wine flight, one bubbly, one white, one red. All delicious. Our waitress had no problem letting us take our time with the experience. We munched on the complimentary warm, crusty bread and oil with the smaller first course of goat cheese we ordered. Simple and delish. We then experienced several inventive and flavorful tapas: mushroom and herbed goat cheese, spicy shrimp, and lastly chorizo in fig sauce. They were all good, but that chorizo is a must have if you like figs!! I capped off with a Barcelona Gintonic which was refreshing and fruity but not sweet. The ambiance is really something. It's lovely inside but it was too dark to take photos for this review without illuminating the entire restaurant with my flash. Sorry-- no photos. You'll have to take my word. As with every place in West Hartford get ready to pay for parking and walk to your destination along the fashionable end of Farmington Avenue.

Atmosphere, drinks, food, and service was on point!!!We had reservations and got in right away. The birthday girl came and then we ended up getting drinks right away. She ordered the sangria (white), that was a tasty drink. We then started with the beef empanadas (4 dishes): perfect and tasty (I think I'm a professional); just not much of a fan of the outside shell really.the we all ordered something big; I got the filet mignon, artichoke, and onions with truffle sauce (which was OH MY great). My friend ordered a side of asparagus and the sauce was oh sooo tasty (we need to make a bottle of that and sell it).We then got the amazing dish of tomatoes reduction in a red wine with shrimp, mussels, peas, potatoes, and more. It was pretty delicious (not over salty as most I've had). I've had this dish in Spain many times and they were pretty close.My other friend ordered the hanger steak with truffle sauce drenched, not to much on over the middle and it was cooked to perfection (OH sooo good).Then the \"manly friend\" got a steak with an over easy egg on top. NO butte, no oils, and no salt (potatoes. green and red peppers, onions) with pepper seasoning and it was looking really good from a far.The service is hands down the best. Everyone who encountered our table was fabulous. The dishes were amazing. They came out at all different times which made the breaks between other plates perfect timing. \u00a0The wine selection was outstanding. I love Spanish wine. I heard about the Mario wine (which is a cab sav.), but its only available by bottle.They don't have a menu online at the East Hartford location (I uploaded the wine list for a photoKeep in mind everything is tapas, but the prices are ideal. We got a lot of food for a small price. If I ever come back to West Hartford I would definitely come back to this spot."], ["Jackie D.", "Great food, drinks and atmosphere. The chicken empanadas are very good. The calamari is a lot of bang for the buck as well. Consider the potato tortilla as well. It is more like a frittata than a tortilla. We also had the jamon croquettes which were rockin. If you come on a week day between 5-7 they have great drink specials from wine, mixed to beer and they have some tapas specials that range from $2-$3. This place is a definite must try. We also had the mixed fruit red sangria. It was very good. The chocolate hazelnut indulgence was to die for.

Medium bodied and a little sweet. In terms of tapas, I also really loved the pork/beef meatballs (3 for $3 in a great tomato-based sauce), and the chickpeas with spinach and onions ($3). The Tortilla was also nicely portioned for happy hour ($2). Great vibe. This place was fairly empty at 5:30pm but definitely got packed by 7:30pm. (Happy hour is from 5-7pm.)

The squash a la plancha, eggplant caponata and queso were delicious... Tried the Churros as a redemption dish and these were most disappointing of all.

In 2009, the owner, Fabio Caro, sold La Casona and moved to Miami. The restaurant's new owner unfortunately let cuisine fall by the wayside as he poured resources into promoting the place as a nightclub. As a result, La Casona shut down - but not for good! Fabio returned to Connecticut, and brought with him his experiences in Miami at restaurants that focused on ethnic tapas. He renovated La Casona and turned it into simply Casona, a gorgeous space that serves up truly unique, authentic dishes for both lunch and dinner.I arrived to find the dance floor (Casona still moonlights as a popular nightclub) occupied by a salsa teacher and his students! That's right, Casona offers salsa lessons on both Wednesday nights (6, 7:15, and 8pm) and Saturday mornings (9:30pm). Don't be shy, all levels are invited, and prices are extremely reasonable at just $10/class on Wednesdays and FREE on Saturday (what a fun, affordable date idea!). If salsa isn't your thing, Tuesdays at 6:30pm there is ridiculously cheap $5 Zumba!We were seated in the dining room next to two huge booths, which Fabio informed us are filled on weekends with young customers utilizing Casona's bottle service. The table was set beautifully and our waitress immediately brought over glasses and a bottle of water to keep at the table. I love that - I go through water like mad at restaurants, and it's great when I can just serve it myself.To drink, we selected an Argentinian Merlot. It was WONDERFUL and paired beautifully with all of our food. We started with toasty, crunchy bread with Casona's signature \"sexy sauce\". The taste of this sauce was certainly a sexy thing indeed.Our next course, Piononos, was my friend's favorite (she went back and ordered it for lunch this week in fact) and, after much deliberation, I've decided it was my favorite as well: sweet plantains stuffed with ground beef and Latin spices, topped with sexy sauce. First of all, I loved the presentation of each of the tapas. Secondly, WOW. The sweet plantains were a fantastic contract to the spiced ground beef, and the sexy sauce made them even more amazing. What a unique, well-prepared dish!Next up was a dish the seafood-lover in me was extremely excited to try, the ceviche, made with tilapia! Or as Fabio calls it...Peruvian sushi. Each section of the tray had a different sauce: yellow pepper sauce, rocoto, and virgin sauce. All were wonderful and had a bit of a spicy kick that got to me a bit by the time we'd finished this dish, but it wasn't so much spiciness that it made eating the ceviche unpleasant in any way. The dish was garnished with Peruvian corn - how cool is that? It was so yummy and wasn't even salted, buttered, or anything! The huge kernels packed a flavorful punch. The middle compartment of the tray was garnished with a sweet potato, which tasted so good in that spicy sauce. More yummy contrast!Out of anything I tried at Casona, I'd say the beef and chicken empanadas tasted most similar to other dishes I've tried before, but that doesn't mean they weren't stand-outs. The crunchy outer shell was fried to perfection and not greasy at all. The chicken was shredded, which I prefer so much more to chunks, and that perfectly-spiced ground beef was back again. Fabio called the salsa a pico de gallo, which was a bit odd to me since every other pico I've seen is more chunky and has the least liquid of any salsa variety, whereas this salsa was mostly liquid. I definitely prefer \u00a0a chunkier salsa, but since the empanadas shape is definitely more conducive to soaking than scooping, the liquid salsa was a good choice.The last dish was the Tostones Rellenos, or fried green plantains stuffed with chicken and shrimp (chicken for Rachel, shrimp for me) and garnished with homemade plantain chips. The plantain chips were the best I've ever tasted (Casona should bag them and sell them!) and the rellenos were again not greasy and absolute perfection. We were too full to finish this plate, and that did not make us happy, but we were going to explode with any more food!We are definitely going to be back to Casona (in fact, my friend's already been back), and it's so exciting to hear that they are having success so far in their revitalization."], ["Queen B.", "Love the Latin dishes offered on the menu. It's got a little bit from all over. I've had the Bandeja Colombiana and Churrasco. Loved it!!! I'd go back for those. Ordered the mofongo once but it had like spaghetti sauce (on mofongo???) on it. That ruined it. The food is good but service leaves a lot to be desired. \u00a0Great greeting, prompt delivery of drinks and after that its hard to catch a server's attention. It took us more time to get our check and cash out than the meal itself."], ["Jacqueline D.", "Haven't been for the food, but my girls and I stopped here for the club. Music was good.

The men looked good as hell so I definitely cant' complain. $10 cover?? I mean really"], ["B B.", "One of my favorite Latin restaurants!I love the recent upgrades to the bar and dining area.

If Latin dancing is your thing, you can go on either Thursday, \u00a0Friday or Saturday nights and get your fill of Salsa, Merengue, Bachata and more. On Friday evenings they open up the dinning room floor for more freestyle dancing. The dance floor is one of the best in Hartford. Parking is a little tight so it's best to arrive early.On Wednesday nights there is \u00a0West Coast swing and at least once a month on Sundays you will find a nice mix of Hustle, West Coast Swing, Salsa and more. Occasionally there are live bands but most of the music is provide by DJ's. All of the DJ's are top notch and DJ Louie East is perhaps one of \u00a0the best Latin DJ's in Connecticut.On Friday nights there is often a live Latin jam session with local musicians and singers as well as opportunity for live Karaoke. Except for rare occasions, there is a beginner dance class before each night of dancingThe staff is friendly and courteous.

I called to see if there was waiting list. The man said no but suggested I make reservations. I then asked if he had any reservations left for the night and his answer was \"there are several, the first availability being 7:15\" I then said ok and went on to give my information for a reservation. It was at this point that he interrupted me to ask whether I'd be using any promotions like Groupon. I answered \"yes\" and his reply was that he couldn't honor any more Groupons as they already limit themselves to honoring 7 Groupons a day. With that said, I mentioned that my Groupon would be expired tomorrow and thus needed to use it today, unless he would be willing to honor it tomorrow. His response was that I should've planned better and not have waited to use the Groupon on the last day and that now it was too late to use the Groupon $40 promotional value. Again I asked him how he could turn away and refuse customers that minutes ago he had offered a 7:15 reservation.I was supremely disgusted with the horribly rude host and customer service."], ["Catherine R.", "Best place ever!! Can't even begin to tell you how great the food was here. I had the monfongo. It was delicious. Not many complaints other than I wish that there was more shrimp in the dish.

The menu here is intensely alien. It's the kind of menu that forces you to be a bold regular (or Peruvian) in order to unlock it's tasty secrets. So many choices... \u00a0so little room in my belly.Don't worry if your Spanish is rusty, the waiter will kindly whisper the correct pronunciation to you should you fumble. They were all very professional, engaging and helpful.They start you off with a bowl of cancha. Gringos might identify them as Corn Nuts, but cancha is sooo much better. Cancha is giant corn kernels fried until they become light and crunchy. The sauce they serve them with was good, but the logistics of eating them with said sauce left me a little puzzled. The calamari (chicharr\u00f3n calamar) comes with fried cassava root wedges that we initially mistook for deliciously starchy potatoes. I thought chicharr\u00f3nes were fried pig skin, but apparently it's more of a preparation than a particular meal, and in South America the friable food can vary country to country. Then there's the sopa criolla de la minuta. My favorite proverb is an old Spanish one: of soup and love the first is best. It brings a tear to my eye when I meet a soup that puts real value to those words. The criolla de la minuta (creole of the minute?) is a beef soup with angel hair pasta, a poached egg, a potato and oregano laced milk that must have come straight from god's teet. It has to be said... some of the desserts are a little kitschy. There's some cheesecake I would assume came from a \u00a0box, an oreo mouse cake that also probably spent some time being shipped in from somewhere else... and then there's the flan. Now I know those of us that took Spanish in high school probably spent at least one class talking about how awful flan is. All jokes aside, this flan is the reason Spanish people love flan. Decadent caramel over a perfectly executed custard. My wife quickly abandoned her oreo mess and begged me out of half of my dessert, it was so good."], ["Jenna D.", "I never actually noticed this restaurant, despite going to Pho Boston many times. It was pretty empty on a Friday night, and there was decent parking. There was a bowl of canacha on the table already, with a creamy garlic sauce that was pretty delicious.While the drinks are standard West Hartford prices, the food is not. It's around (or slightly less) than your average chain restaurant prices, but it's sooooooooo much better (two drinks and dinner came to $40). I had the Tallarin Saltado de Lomo, a pasta dish with steak, peppers, onions, and tomatoes over linguine. The meat was cooked exactly medium rare, and was a great cut. The sauce was light, and the veggies were still a little crisp. The portion was enormous - I couldn't finish it. My husband had a sliced rib eye with onions and tomatoes, over french fries with white rice. He ate nearly everything, and his cut of meat was equally delicious.It might be something I don't understand about Peruvian cuisine, where everything comes with french fries/rice/Chinese style? That was the one thing I found a little odd, but Our server was attentive but not overbearing, and was very helpful when I was having trouble deciding what I wanted to eat. She was pretty good with refilling water glasses, too, which is a pet peeve of mine. She also didn't rush us out, as we sat around talking for about an hour after we paid the check. Definitely great service. There are fuzzy Alpaca wall hangings that I wanted to take home with me, and the overall presentation was very nice. It's a small place, so quite intimate.

Tucked away on Shield Street in West Hartford (in the same plaza as Adong and Pho Boston), Cora Cora cooks up a variety of South American specialties that boast the unique flavors and spices of traditional Peruvian cuisine. The menu offers an extensive list of appetizers, chicharrones, soups, and chicken/beef/seafood dishes.After very little deliberation, I settled on the Ceviche Mixto: A fresh, flavorful amalgamation of octopus, mussels and clams marinated in tart lime juice with onions and cilantro- all beautifully garnished with toasted Peruvian corn and sweet potato over lettuce. To complement and offset the tangy ceviche, I also ordered a side of sweet plantains (platano maduro), which were predictably luscious. I then stabbed my fork over into my dining companion's plate to taste the rich, savory Camarones al Ajillo: Shrimp saut\u00e9ed in a creamy Peruvian garlic and wine sauce, served with rice and fried potatoes.Since I plan on returning to Cora Cora sooner than later, here's a peek at some menu highlights that made it to my \"To Eat\" list:I've heard tasty rumors about this \"don't knock it til you try it\" dish: -Anticuchos: Grilled diced cow heart skewer seasoned with Peruvian spices.

Awesome.This was what I had:1.) Ceviche de Pescado - yummy. They put a lot of lime in it. The combination of the regular and sweet potato complimented the citrus and sour taste of the sauce that was on the seafood. Topped with sliced onions, this was a perfect first course.2.) Chicha drink - its like Peruvian Kool-Aid. Sweet, refreshing and tasty!3.) La chaufa de Mariscos - fried rice, eggs, calamari, shrimp, and clams. It was like a Peruvian Chinese dish. But it's true, Peruvian food is considered \"Asian fusion\" food. It was a yummy dish.4.) Cancha - I call it the free bread basket of this Peruvian restaurant. Unlimited. Cancha is toasted and salted corn, it reminds me of that snack you can get in a grocery store called \"Corn Nuts\" except this one has the crunch of a soy nut. Served with a yellow sauce (I forgot the name). All in all Cancha is considered the \"popcorn\" of Peruvian snacks.5.) Rice pudding - served warm, topped with cinnamon.

I was on the fence prior to my most recent visit but they've earned this 4 star review so here it goes. Peruvian food is very interesting: there are some dishes, like Ceviche, that are very complex and upscale and other dishes that are basically chopped hot dogs and crinkle cut French Fries. On top of that you have Asian style fried rice. Due to this it's hard to judge it on one trip/experience. \u00a0My tip is to find someone who has been there a few times and take them with you. (Maybe one day if I have more time I'll go through all of the menu items on Yelp.)If you like Ceviche; get some of that, if you like family style rotisserie chicken; get some of that, if you like Thai/Indian curry they have something like that too. In fact the first thing you should do is order a drink so you can really take your time with the menu and ask the servers some questions.

The hostess and our waiter were two of the warmest, friendliest people I have ever encountered in a restaurant. \u00a0They welcomed us as if we were dining in their home and had a genuine passion for their culture and cuisine. \u00a0They both took time to explain the menu options and cleared up any questions we had about some of the more unusual items (i.e. the purple corn drink...see below). \u00a0The portions were plentiful and prices were reasonable. \u00a0Here are the details:1st course: \u00a0OCOPAThis was very different from anything I have tried before. \u00a0Basically consisted of potatoes and hard boiled eggs covered in a creamy green sauce. Not much to look at but I love to try out new things so we gave it a shot. \u00a0There was a noticeable egg + potato flavour but the sauce was pretty bland. \u00a0Also, the texture was just how one would think: on the mushier side. \u00a0I tend to like stronger flavours so this was not my favourite. \u00a0Glad I tried it but would probably not order again.Main course: \u00a0LOMO SALTADOThis was beef saut\u00e9ed with onions and tomatoes served over french fries. \u00a0It came with fried plantains and rice on the side. \u00a0Meat was cooked well done which I appreciated and the dish was seasoned well. \u00a0The plantains were cooked perfectly and had the starchy sweetness one would expect.Drink: CHICHI MORADAThe purple corn drink. Apparently in Peru they have purple corn and this is a very traditional drink from what the hostess told us. \u00a0What can I say? \u00a0I really really liked this. \u00a0It's very sweet but was like nothing I've tasted before; I can't really describe how it tasted but it was nothing like corn. \u00a0Get this at any restaurant where you can find it; if you like sweet drinks you will love it. \u00a0Also it looks really cool to have a huge carafe of purple juice sitting on your table.**Was I blown away by Peruvian cuisine? \u00a0No. However, it is not bad and I would not mind it on occasion.**Did I enjoy the meal? \u00a0Due to the extraordinary service and the experience of trying something new, YES."], ["Amy T.", "After 3 years of telling myself \u00a0I 'neeeeed' to check this place out, recently I made a trip to Cora Cora and I have nothing but great things to say about the experience. \u00a0I feel my writing skills are just not creative enough to do this place justice so I will just keep it short.

I hadn't ever been to Costa Del Sol, so I was excited about my first pilgrimmage to the restaurant. Upon our arrival to meet a group of friends, my sister and I looked to and fro... hoping for direction from the hostess... a rather surely middle-aged woman who refused to look up from what she was doing and who begrudgingly waved toward the direction of our party and mumbled, \"back there and to the right,\" only after I approached her and asked. My sister scowled and I said, \"Alllrighty then. Thanks?\" Confused by her unwillingness to show good customer service. Seated with the other 6 or so people, at a rather small table (prior arrangements *had* been made), we jockeyed for water refills, the last of the party to arrive had to practically beg for a glass along with silverware, another dinner guest had a rather passion-less Passion- fruit martini - which got passed around like a ten dollar hooker to no avail, because there were no takers... it tasted horrible - and my sister had a mediocre Mojito, which tasted like bland 7-Up. One of the first times I've ever disliked an alcoholic beverage or drink! I played it safe and ordered a glass of Tempranillo and indulged in an after dinner sherry, which was quite good, but I digress... The Calamares I ordered - (A dish of grilled squid w/ spanish paprika, olive oil, and crispy garlic) - took forever to come... when it was finally placed in front of me, I was unmoved by its presentation and even more disappointed by how it tasted. It was chewy (I felt like I was masticating a thick rubber-band), bland, and devoid of any kick. I ate around it, fumbling for flavor and settling on the \"crispy garlic,\" which was extremely salty but the most flavorable aspect of the meal. The waitress would later ask if I wanted to box the rubber up to take home... an offer I politely declined. My sister had the Chorizo, which was supposedly sauteed w/ shallots and Riojo red wine but alas, nary a shallot was present. The chorizo was extremely lackluster and the sauce it was sauteed in tasted like it belonged in a Swedish Meatballs dish. A suggestion to douse the meal in tabasco sauce made it a little more palatable. There were also complaints about the rubbery shrimp in the Paella de la Casa as well. *Sigh* ...There was just so much ... WRONG ... this Friday evening. My friend was still charged for the frigid Passion-tini she sent back, without the offer of a replacement cocktail. Upon seeing the blight on the bill and a refusal by the manager to have it taken off, she demanded to have a replacement one, since she was being charged for it... A very unpleasant experience... which is rare for me. So much so, I'm not sure I'm willing to give it another chance and I'm hesitant to attribute it to an \"off night\" for the restaurant. Not at those prices. Two very generous stars: One for our harried but friendly waitress, the tempranillo, and then the sherry, the other ONE star that I wanted to rate it for being an absolute FAIL."], ["Michael L.", "Came in on a weeknight after picking up my car from a repair shop on a Tuesday night, wanting to let the rush hour traffic pass before heading home. \u00a0I really like this place a lot and the atmosphere is very authentic to its cultural roots. \u00a0I always enjoy the warm bread basket, served with a plate of olive oil. \u00a0Salt and Pepper on the side. \u00a0The Paella is usually excellent. \u00a0However, the pan that my wife and I shared this evening was just \"OK\". \u00a0The seasoning was non-existent...I remember it being much, much better. \u00a0I LOVE spicy food, but my wife does not at all, so she was okay with it, although even SHE said that it tasted a little bland this time. \u00a0I actually hesitated between choosing a rating of 3 or 4. \u00a0Would be a 5 if the Paella was what I remembered. \u00a0I would still highly recommend Costa, and hope that I can recover my experience on my next visit. \u00a0I like the recommendation made by Linda L. for the \"Parrollada de Mariscos\"...wish I had tried that instead! \u00a0They have a very cool bar area with limited seating. \u00a0The owners make it their passion to make rounds to the tables to inquire about their guests experiences. \u00a0A great place to check out....."], ["Heather M.", "I had been dying to go here for years but each time it was closed for one reason or another.

My friend and I were meeting for dinner. (2 of us) I had a reservation for 2. When we arrived the place was fairly empty. We were one of first to arrive. Most tables were three or four tops with one or two two tops. \u00a0There was a sun room patio area, which was so nice and inviting looking. I asked the person seating us (older man....seemed to be an owner) if we could sit in the little sun room area, which was empty...the whole restaurant had more than enough seats. He told me \"NO!\" Can you believe it? I couldn't. He said that he needed to save the three tops for parties of three and he sat me at a two top (one of only ones in the place) so rude! Maybe they need to put some two tops in the nice little sun room why should only parties of three get to sit out there? Ok, I get if the restaurant was so crowded telling me I couldn't, BUT it was dead. When I left and hour later more people had arrived but there were still many open tables left, including in the sun room. Would it of killed to let me sit there?

Food wasn't as good as I expected. To be honest cant even remember what I ordered so not very memorable.3. Desert- I got the flan, which came with the taste of hartford menu. It was plopped on my plate and looked like someone had eaten around the edges. I asked my waitress about that unappetizing presentation and she assured me it was like that because it had been scooped out of a big bowl so that's why the edges were looking like bites had been taken. Ummmmmmm....maybe serve them in individual tart dishes or br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes so its a nice presentation since the consistency is pudding like. That would be an easy fix.VERDICT: down the road is Casona.....much better food! Amazing food there. I've been there three times. It's not as pretty as costa del sol, but food is sooooo good! And customer service ther is great! They were so nice at Casona....they even let me sit in the sun room. Change your ways costa del sol or move over to Casona!"], ["Jon G.", "Went for the Taste of Hartford and a friend's birthday recently. \u00a0Not bad at all, but really nothing outstanding either. \u00a0I had a strip steak that may have come from the local Stop and Shop - a cheap, grizzly cut. \u00a0All of the other items, though, were very good. \u00a0The service was odd - it seemed to consist of a kind of team of three people. \u00a0That would have been fine, but 2 spoke no English at all. \u00a0Finally, we asked that our check be split in half among to credit cards. \u00a0We received the slips to sign, and there was about a $20 disparity between the the two. \u00a0Weird."], ["Tim F.", "I was here last night as a last minute dinner, which is my second experience here, and feel the need to YELP about the food. \u00a0Costa del Sol is known for authentic paella, and is probably one of the best restaurants in Hartford, I mean other then Olive Garden...just kidding, Bricco. Food/Sangria: If you come here you should try the paella and sangria, red or white. It's what they're known for. However, I already tried it in the past & wanted some MEAT this time. I did order the red sangria though... its yummy and authentic and has floating oranges and is very dangerous (I had a buzz on after 4 sips)...and I suspect that the white had the same effect on my friend. The app I chose to start with was the soup Caldo Gallego - which is vegetable soup with potatoes, white beans, collard greens, Spanish sausage and cured ham. It was piping hot, hearty and perfect for fall. My friend ordered the Tabla Iberica, a meat cheese platter with smoked ham, chorizo, and some cheeses...I'm not a smoked meat eating kinda guy so I didn't try it but he was happy and anyway I was busy with my soup and sangria to look up. They brought over a small simple salad between the app & dinner, which added nice touch. For dinner I had the Entrecote, which is grilled ribeye steak with peppers and garlic. It was cooked perfectly rare & melted in my mouth. Clean Plate Club. My friend ordered the Pork osso buco which was HUGE and well-presented on the plate...I think he said it had some sorta sherry demi-glaze...but he kept trying to taste my Ribeye, so I submit that it wasn't as delicious as mine. D\u00e9cor: The d\u00e9cor is simple, maybe a little 90's dated, but warmly painted walls and Spanish pottery...nothing fancy, but well done. Certainly a good place for a romantic dinner. When you arrive there's a small brightly lit shop/deli to the left, which I think is maybe a little weird for a restaurant layout. Cleanliness: \u00a0I can't stress this enough: It is the CLEANEST restaurant I've ever been to. Seriously, one could eat off the bathroom floors. I'm not kidding. It is apparent that the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant show that the owners/management LOVE what they do there. CdS also seems to be a quiet secret.... maybe because it's in the frayed far south end of Hartford? \u00a0I'd have it no other way. I love the fact that unlike Bricco its NOT in West Hartford Center or the G'burbs or someplace else yuppified...the Wethersfield Ave locale adds to the exotic experience of eating really great, simple Spanish food. Of course, the parking lot is filled with shiny Beemers & Benze's so maybe it's not as unknown as I thought."], ["Margaret S.", "This is the first time I have ever written a review. \u00a0My husband and I were celebrating our 42nd anniversary. \u00a0It was also The Taste ofHartford. \u00a0We were served our drinks and then proceeded to wait35 minutes to be served our appetizer. \u00a0Which I had to ask for. \u00a0Wealso had to ask for our entree. \u00a0The service was terrible. \u00a0Everyone around us were served. \u00a0It was such a disappointment. \u00a0Our waitressalso brought out the wrong dessert."], ["Steve T.", "I have been having the food here for at least 15 years. \u00a0I say 'having the food here' because since I was a little kid my dad has been bringing home their paella. \u00a0I have dined here 3 or 4 times. \u00a0You need to go here and get the PAELLA. \u00a0Just do it. \u00a0You don't have to eat in, you can order the paella to go if you want. \u00a0But DO IT. \u00a0What are you waiting for? \u00a0I've had paella in Valencia and it was nowhere near as good as the paella that this restaurant in Hartford has to offer. \u00a0It will blow you away. \u00a0That's all I have to say about Costa Del Sol."], ["D W.", "I feel like I am in Espana! Friendly owners and great chef. Have been going here when I am in the Hartford area for years.

My husband's appetizer - potato and onion omelet - was a bit bland, but 2 of us enjoyed our bread with Serrano ham and tomatoes, and the chorizo sausage appetizer was excellent. All entrees were delicious - salmon, paella de la casa, and shrimp with garlic sauce over fusilli. Flan and rice pudding were good choices for dessert (I can't remember the third choice.) And our waitress \u00a0did her job quietly and well. This was my first visit to the restaurant and we will definitely go back."], ["Paul S.", "Still great. \u00a0Had a fantastic meal there recently from their prix fixe menu. \u00a0The thing I felt compelled to report: they no longer serve Goat Cheese Ice Cream. \u00a0This a major bummer. \u00a0I was told that they weren't selling enough to make it worth the effort or to keep it fresh. \u00a0People were put off by the idea, but I assure you, it's nectar of the gods. \u00a0And as Pepe, the owner, will tell you, it's the only ice cream that you can have with wine. \u00a0That alone should make it worth ordering! \u00a0So I hope everyone who wants the marvelous stuff back on the menu will express their love. \u00a0But even without it you'll find plenty here to satisfy."], ["Catherine J.", "The food was delicious! The paella was awesome! I highly recommend the champagne sangria. I also had the home made raspberry sorbet...DELICIOUS! The perfect end to an awesome meal. It is a bit pricey, but worth it if your in the mood for authentic Spanish food. I need to go back and get some of that olive oil that came with the warm bread. Yummy, fruity, fresh and sunshine yellow. I never thought I'd dream about olive oil... but I am. I will definitely be a return customer!"], ["Mickey Z.", "Food is OK but they need to change their menu. Seems like the owners don't care anymore. Same old thing over and over and not really that good anymore. Bar is fun and the sangria is good although Besito's in West Hartford charges the same for a pitcher and you get about 3x the amount of sangria and it tastes better."], ["Doug B.", "went last night. \u00a0Outstanding. \u00a0Seating was rapid and organized with obviously very attentive management. \u00a0Waiters came over promptly which can often not happen in other restaurants. \u00a0Food was very very tasty. A party of six, one had tenderloin, which was smooth and buttery. One had octopus, which he liked and again was very tender. \u00a0In a summary, \u00a0this place is on its game."], ["Ken M.", "Went there on a Friday night by myself. I was in the mood for some good seafood and I heard they had good paella. Since I was alone they ushered me into the bar: OK with me, I was able to watch sports while eating. The menu came out, and I ordered a seafood soup and it was good w/the bread tomato based.Then the confusion started: I was going to order a squid appetizer but when the bartender/waiter came over I told him I was going back and forth about octopus & squid. He told me that the octopus was better (more money too), so I went with the octopus. Later both apps came out: the squid & octopus. He was confused I guess, thinking I wanted both of them? I sent back the squid & started eating the octopus. There was so much sea salt on it I couldn't taste the octopus. Stupidly, I kept eating the octopus hoping that each piece would be different, and it wasn't. I needed to get that taste out of my mouth the wine and water weren't cutting it, so I asked for the squid I sent back while complaining about the salt. The squid was good and it did the trick. I wanted to order paella, but it is only for two, so I got the next best thing mixed seafood served with saffron rice and salad. This too was good. No room for dessert though. When I looked at the bill I saw both the $9 squid and $11 octopus on the bill. I didn't say anything, but I thought they would taste the potatoes I didn't eat and agree about the sea salt and not charge me. Good customer service would do that. When the manager came over, I told him about the sea salt but didn't complain about the bill. He offered me another glass of wine, which I took. The food is good, but I got the impression the bartender/waiter was trying to inflate my bill. It has good food, but the overly salted dish stopped me from being a fan. May go back for the paella with a friend."], ["Meganarama n.", "Came here with a group of colleagues. \u00a0The staff was very accommodating. \u00a0 (We have a couple of folks who tend to be a bit high maintenance) \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0I had some shrimp dish that was really just so different from anything I have ever had - in a really good way! \u00a0The wine list was very good as well. \u00a0I would go back if they would have us!"]], "Comerio": [], "Bartaco - West Hartford": [["Craig P.", "What a great experience! We were in town for the night and were planning on going next door to Barcelona, came here for a drink and decided to stay. It was the best decision of the night. Amy was our server and she was great! Attentive, explained family style dining and guided our entire meal through dessert. We ordered the Bartaco margarita and Humo y Fuego. The margarita was made to perfection, so cold and great balance of tequila and lime. The Humo y Fuego is one spicy mezcal drink, if you like both of those things you will be in love. We started with the guacamole, salsa Verde and chips and my god they were delicious. The chips are whole tortillas that you break apart and dip that we're salted perfectly. The guacamole was fresh and salsa was the perfect balance of spicy and flavorful. We decided on trying most the tacos on the menu below:Curry Shrimp - shrimp were flavorful, not overcooked, \u00a0and a good size.Baja fish - lightly battered and deliciousPork belly - SO good! Crispy roasted pork with pickled onions.Spicy chorizo - not too spicy and juicy.Wild boar - great flavor.Duck - a little tough but still great, would order again. Portobello - one of of my favorites! Tender Portobello with light queso.Falafel - I would pass on. Probably had the least amount of flavor or just wasn't executed correctly.A major note was the sauces that come on the table. There are multiple hot sauces: roja, jalapeno, and habanero. I'm a major fan of hot sauce and these were all amazing. We finished with something sweet, the churro.It was crunchy, sweet and warm. It could have used a bit more cinnamon and sugar but honestly it was great! It came with a chocolate dipping sauce that paired perfectly. It was one successful night."], ["Kristen M.", "I really enjoy bartaco. It's unique and fun. Ambiance is great and it's not your traditional way/place to eat. The good: - the tacos are tasty - a variety of choices from pork belly, chicken, Baja fish to name a few- the drinks are Delish! Mojitos are yummy!- other dishes like the rice bowls are also savoryThe bad:- you must be in the mood for this type of food- tapas plate sharing styleOverall: Tasty if you re in the mood for a unique and delicious treat!"], ["Tim B.", "Bar taco is always a great choice.

Fast friendly service! Tacos are out of this world. We ordered the variety of taco entree (i forgot what it was called specifically) it came with a type of coleslaw and a cucumber salad and a variety of different tacos. I loved the baja fish taco! Yum! We sat at their outdoor \"patio.\""], ["Mark P.", "Based on two visits, Bartaco has not been my cup of tea. I should make clear that I have a couple of things going against me when I enter any trendy establishment: Number one I'm not a terribly social human being so a buzzy crowd which gleefully destroys plates of visually attractive food immediately puts me off. Number two I despise \"old money\" of which there is plenty in West Hartford and thusly I wonder to myself \"does this place have a vision and a purpose to serve a higher standard of cuisine and drink or are they strategically playing into a growing number of foodies with a growing appetite for 'tapas' and designer cocktails?\" The answer, I think, is a combination of the two. I feel like Bartaco goes out of its way to be trendy, promoting the revival of Cobain-era shirts among the wait staff, using low-hanging, low-wattage lights, and basing their food service on small plates. Don't get me wrong; when I sit down to eat I hate being the only guy who showed up wearing nice clothes when everyone else looks like they just came in from raking leaves. I appreciate being in a sophisticated crowd. That being said, the hipster vibe penetrates this place harder than the force penetrated Anakin Skywalker.My first visit was with my wife who enthusiastically insisted that I try a drink her girlfriend had once ordered which featured fresh jalape\u00f1o. I believe it was a variation of the margarita, which is not on their current menu, but regardless it was tough to swallow. Literally. The jalape\u00f1o, like the cucumber, doesn't belong in a cocktail. \u00a0I moved on to the \"Old Thymer\" which is made with fresh thyme. I fancy myself a pretty grizzled drinker but this one was tough. Real tough. My conclusion: When it comes to cocktails, sweets yes, savories no.Because my wife loves the place, we returned for her birthday. We told her friends to arrive there at a certain time for drinks and showed up an hour early to have some dinner. We ordered 4 or 5 plates. There was a rosemary chicken half which was fresh but very simple. Then there was a shrimp ceviche which was basically a little shrimp, a lot of thin-sliced veggies, and a very minimal amount of acidity. Compared to neighboring Barcelona, the ceviche was inadequate. The chicken was satisfying but unremarkable.Her friends arrived and we relocated to the bar. After several failed attempts to order basic drinks that the vast majority of full bars offer, I settled on some...\"adaptations\" of my favorites. One thing that became perfectly clear to me after this visit is that if you plan on ordering beyond the bar menu at Bartaco, you'll likely be out of luck. And this is something that you have to understand if you're a dense, cantankerous, avoidant bastard like me and someone drags you to Farmington Avenue for a drink and a bite.Go there to accept their version of wining and dining but forget your own. In the meantime I'll muster up the patience to give it another go."], ["Matt T.", "Awesome creative tacos, best margaritas in town, with a really cool ambiance. Food is cheap, drinks are expensive, but overall a great place for lunch or a casual dinner, particularly during summer when the patio is open.

Shrimp, chicken, falafel, all were good. Friendly staff good service - overall very nice place"], ["Sarah C.", "I promise this third review update is worth the read....After I posted my last review, stating that I was underwhelmed with the inconsistency of the food and the suffering service, I got a very nice email from the manager at bartaco, Todd. He is a new manager there and said he is making every effort to insure 100% satisfaction of every guest and fix the problem areas they are facing based on customer feedback. He truly cared about the negative feedback and apologized for the experiences that we're subpar. He invited us back to try again and the service and food were excellent. The food has always been good, my problem was more with the delivery or portions at times. He went out of his way to prove that he, and the staff, were working hard to make everyone's bartaco experience a good one.I can honestly say that is it rare for a manager to reach out and whole heartedly want to correct the problem for their customers. For some reason, if you experience any issues there (which seem to be dwindling), don't hesitate to reach out to him or any of the other managers (Kevin is also wonderful). I wish I had reached out earlier had I known how eager they are to address any customer issues. I value good customer service above most other things. Even great good can be soured by awful customer service. Through reviews, I've learned that bartaco really values its patrons, and that says a lot about the company! Also, the duck tacos (which I had never tried prior) made my jaw drop. 48 hour glaze/marinade before cooking....need I say more?"], ["Ahmed A.", "Great tacos, loud atmosphere, fun trendy crowd, great location. Service was absolutely fantastic! Probably the best in the Hartford area. Maybe we got lucky with our waitress but she was amazing compared to service we've had in the area in general. We would definitely go back just for the amazing service we received. She went through all of our questions one by one, was very thorough with recommendations, etc. Keep it up! Definitely recommended. Hope they can work on their tortillas though! :)"]]}
