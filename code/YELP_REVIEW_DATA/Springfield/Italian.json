Service was good, atmosphere is nice. The food left a lot to be desiring. 1) Gumbo. This is what I ordered. It wasn't bad, it seemed nice and fresh. My main complaint here is that there was zero heat to it. A good gumbo has a slow heat, something that sneaks up on you. The rice on top was also inadequate, and the corn bread was not very good.2) Margarita pizza. Sister ordered this, and I snagged a piece. The crust was crispy but chewy (if a bit overcooked). The one complaint about this pizza isn't even really a complaint. Whenever I've had Margarita pizza before, the basil was cooked on the pizza. On this pizza, the basil was placed over the cooked pizza. It wasn't bad, just different. 3) Cajun pizza. Dad ordered this. Disliked it so much he gave it to me to take home. I took it to work for lunch. This crust DOES NOT hold up to being put in the fridge overnight. It loses the crisp, and just turns soggy. As far as the flavor...it's just awful. There's no other way to describe it. It was like someone tossed some sausage (I can't even call it andouille..it wasn't spicy), shrimp and Lawry's on a cheese pizza and called it \"Cajun\"Side complaint: Someone told me this place was over priced, and on a cursory glace of the menu it did not appear that way. Well, what I failed to realize is that almost none of the meals come with a side. Want a side? That's an extra $2 minimum. If I'm paying $15 for an entree, I should not have to pay another $4 for a side salad. Given that I liked the Margarita pizza, I will probably give this place another go. \u00a0I think the problem here is that the restaurant is simply trying to be too diverse in it's offerings.

As for the brisket, everything was perfect with one error. The fat wasn't trimmed off the brisket. Even after the butcher trims the fat, you have to trim even more yourself.

I had the Philly steak with the Mac and Cheese side. The Philly steak was great and the Mac and Cheese was out of this world though!

Will definitely be back."], ["Greg L.", "Oh, this place is a keeper for certain. \u00a0What a terrific surprise!We stopped in on a quick trip to see family in Springfield and were wowed by their wood oven baked pizzas, and awesome they were.The pizzas are larger than individual pizzas but perfect if you wish to share, or take some home as leftovers. \u00a0The two I highly recommend are the Margherita (fresh tomato, basil, cheese, sauce) and the Cajun (Andouille, peppers, onions, cheese). \u00a0Both are made with love, and have wonderful flavor. \u00a0Loved the Margherita but there is nothing getting in between me and that Cajun pizza next time I go. \u00a0You can keep the menu---that is the pizza for me. \u00a0You have to try it to understand. \u00a0Thankfully I was the recipient of kind sharing...Their Caesar salad is also terrific, and the beers ice cold---I am told that is a Springfield thing, and if true, this place lives up to the local mandate.The menu is extensive beyond pizzas to include fresh fish and several outstanding entrees that we enjoyed watching others enjoy. \u00a0A very busy and obviously popular place, we recommend going early, and being patient. \u00a0Sidenote: \u00a0Drop your guests at the front door and leave whoever draws the short straw with the task of parking the car. \u00a0A large parking lot, if you go during prime time, you will see how popular this place is when you try to find an open, and legal parking place. \u00a0Don't understand? \u00a0You will---trust me."], ["Richard L.", "My favorite restaurant to eat at in springfield. You've gotta try their horseshoe sandwiches."], ["Matthew G.", "I've been there a few times. \u00a0Been there 3 times now and only had one server who was rude (is that good?). \u00a0The food is average. \u00a0It's a place to stop, but not a common place for me and mine."], ["Beth H.", "Everything about lake point grill is on point. Unique menu that offers a wide variety of delicious selections for everyone. I go there probably more than I should. My friend usually gets the same southwestern or apple jack salad.

The Italian grilled sandwich is GOOD!"], ["Brittany H.", "We dined here on Easter Sunday and were very pleased with our food. I am from Springfield, IL but currently live in Saint Louis, so when I come back \"home\", I must indulge and take a few bites of my boyfriend's horseshoe (which is typically a Corner Pub or D'Arcy's shoe). He had the Lake Pointe Grill meatloaf horseshoe from and my gosh the sauce is to-die-for! By far my favorite cheese sauce in Springfield. I had the Apple Jack salad. I planned on eating half and taking the other half home, but I did not leave with a doggy bag. I have been craving this salad ever since! Oh and the pizza is delicious, after all, they are known for their brick oven pizza. Great food, great service!!"], ["Tim B.", "Good music in the background and excellent service from Brittany. \u00a0The garlic cheese bread with sauce was excellent as well as the pizza. (a little greasy but delicious!)"], ["Katie F.", "Lake Pointe isn't phenomenal, but it never disappoints. The pizza is thin, crispy, and good, but I prefer their entrees -- a salmon dish that comes with pasta is really good, though I can't remember the name. They have good toasted ravioli as an appetizer. My family had a special event here last year and the staff was extremely accommodating and wonderful -- and the food was good, too! It's not exactly fine dining, but you can't go wrong here. The biggest downside? Location. It's far from most of the central Springfield neighborhoods, even if you live on the west side."], ["Tom T.", "Excellent! \u00a0One-time shot meeting an interview candidate. \u00a0Restaurant was packed in the middle of the week, seemed to be mostly regulars and everyone seems to be happy regulars. \u00a0There is a wood-burning brick pizza oven and pizza is clearly the main event. \u00a0So imagine my surprise when I ordered a seafood dish and it was fantastic! \u00a0But even more notably the service was fantastic and very friendly. \u00a0Would definitely recommend and if my events take me here again, will definitely eat here again."], ["Lindsay L.", "I think people in Springfield must have trailer park taste buds because this is hands down the best place to eat in Springfield. I moved here from Chicago a year ago and the food is pretty awful everywhere I have been until we stumbled upon this place 3 weeks ago and have been back twice. Between the two of us, we have had the pizza, calzone, pork chop, and almond crusted pork medallions. The food would be good in Chicago and that is saying a lot. People here get offended when you say food is better in Chicago and think that means you are stuck up, but why wouldn't food be better in the 3rd largest city in America?? I grew up in Columbus OH which is a test market for large cities in the restaurant industry and then lived 10 years in Chicago, I know good food when I taste it. I actually read on here where someone complained about the floor at Lake Pointe, to which I say, \"You need to get out more.\" It is very nicely decorated and the waitstaff was excellent. The only complaint would be that they could get some booths, everything seems super out in the open, the 2nd time we set in the bar and that was a little more intimate. Hands down the very best restaurant in Springfield."], ["Isabelle L.", "Well, 7 PM Monday night yet the place is packed and now I know why: full bar, relaxed atmosphere, great food. The wood oven pizzas are usually delicious and will set you back $10 -14. They also have sandwiches, salads and traditional entrees; tuna, meatloaf...all in the $16 range. My little complaint this time: ordered the margherita pizza and yes all ingredients were fresh and tasteful, yet the dough was undercooked and I just didn't appreciate how soggy it was. Free wi-fi and good service also a plus although a few misses like the waiter bringing the bill without asking if we wanted dessert. So overall a good experience but room for improvement."], ["William H.", "Visited LPG recently, and was not impressed. Their pizzas were supposed to be good, and I felt that they definately fell short of that. Also the menu had a small icon to reveal a \"LPG specialty\" Apparently the only 2 specialties were the horseshoe and some bluberry cobbler thing. Would only revisit if someone else was paying."], ["Jeremy W.", "Their pizzas are great! Haven't ever ordered anything else. \u00a0Service is also pretty good."], ["A A.", "A nice addition to South Springfield/borderline Chatham scene, which until recently seemed a little short on restaurants serving real (ie. not Taco Bell/Burger King/Subway/Wendy's) food. Capacious and airy interior, with enormous floor-to-ceiling windows that fill the restaurant with ample natural light. Noteworthy: the wood fired pizzas. I had the Steak and Crimini Mushroom, which was giant, unique--a nice spin on the typical meat/mushroom pizza--and mouth-wateringly delicious. My only complaint was that the juices from the pizza gathered near the hollow center of the plate, \u00a0soaking though the dough and causing the last few pieces to become soggy. Still, a good experience overall. Granted, I've had better outside of the city, but I would venture to say that this is the best pizza I've had in Springfield. I'd definitely recommend it if you're in the area."], ["Eric S.", "LPG is relatively new in SPI; on my recent trip there LPG was highly recommended. LPG is located in a strip mall, next to El Presidente Burrito, in South Springfield. Inside it is very open, with wall to ceiling windows with plenty of seating. We arrived at around 5pm and the place was getting packed. Since they have a wood burning pizza oven, we decided to give them a try. I started off with a small house salad, which was good, the highlights being the croutons and the red wine basil vinaigrette both which were really tasty. On to the pizzas- the menu claims that they are best enjoyed individually or as an appetizer between two people, so we ordered one pizza per person. Imagining that we would be served small sized pizzas, we were shocked at the pizzas that made it to our table. They had to be at least 12-14\" long and were more like a meal for two people, not appetizers (maybe Midwesterners have bigger appeties?). We ordered the margherita, artichoke tomato and a \"build your own\" of red pepper, mushroom and spinach. The favorites were the margherita and the artichoke tomato pizzas; they were both really good. Of note though, the pizzas were slightly different than any other pizza that I've had from a wood oven- the black char and bubbling was missing; the dough was a little thicker than I'd prefer. The wine list was fair with relatively affordable prices; service was amateurish but not horrible. Compared to other pizzas I've sampled, and trust me Phoenix has some phenomenal pizza, LPG was decent and I'd 3 out of 5 considering it's in SPI."], ["Vu N.", "I love this place! \u00a0I wish it was opened earlier when I first got to grad school. \u00a0Great Italian American food. \u00a0Their pizzas are seriously the best I've had in a long time. Good service, easy parking and close to the University of Illinois at Springfield campus."], ["Ted C.", "I have to say the newer openings with Springfield, it can be hit or miss. Lake Pointe Grill falls somewhere in between. I walked in at around 4 and the place was empty and no one was at the hostess station. I thought they might have been closed but I heard people talking over at the bar area and peeked over, there were two staff members one eating at the end of the bar and the bartender. I decided to sit at the bar and eat. The soup of the day, Chicken florentine was quite good, chicken, artichokes, and spinach in a cream based broth. Excellence in a small cup, the marinated grilled pork chops, eh okay for 13.95-kinda pricey for Springfield. I've had better for a few bucks more but really, no complaints. Their beer selection is fairly large but all bottles, nothing on tap, it makes me wonder why. Also, they need to work out some kinks, the staff was definitely a bit amateurish, but it was quiet and I'd imagine some hijinks, just not at that level. Hard for me to take them seriously at this point in time, maybe with some polishing up it can be a place that will be good, perhaps even great."]], "Papa Frank's": [], "Mangia Pasta Steak Seafood": [], "Joe Gallina's": [], "Joe's Italian Pizza": [["Bethany S.", "Our family's favorite local pizza.

Unlike that chain Italian restaurant that shall remain unnamed, this place is fantastic. The inside is reminiscent of an Italian villa. It's not huge, but that's what makes it special. Appropriate dining music and good wait staff helps to complete the experience. The food is excellent, but if your not use to this type of menu, you may be caught off guard. It's not a traditional pick an entree. You get to pick your type of pasta, sauce and toppings( such as chicken, mushrooms etc...). I find this to be superior to other restaurants because it gives you more options. This is real Italian flavor, too. Not some mass produced chain food. Price is medium. It's not cheap, however, it's not over priced either. $12-15 for an entree. You get a good amount of food and a large piece of focaccia bread with it.

No way, the crust was excellent, had plenty of cheese and the pepperoni was tasty (but a bit greasy!).Salad was simple, but plentiful and homemade italian dressing was good.A few downsides; They don't really have the customer in mind that are eating in... We split a large salad and had to ask for plates and were given the 'small' pizza pans that were really huge. We didn't like was that the pizza was too large to keep on the table with 3 plates. I guess not that many people must 'eat in'... They might rethink that strategy, maybe get those pedestals or something that the pizza can sit on while you eat. Also didn't really like fact that we had to bus our own table between salad and pizza otherwise there would have been no room at all.
