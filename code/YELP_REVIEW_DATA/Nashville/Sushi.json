I am not hard to please and fast to praise. But this place... I will never go back.Our server was rude and rushed with us from the beginning, like she had something better to do. I asked for the ginger said but add avacado. She brings me a totally different salad, and when I asked for what I'd ordered, she made a big stink about taking it back and then mouthed off about us to another server. We made it clear that we could hear her and that it was not our fault that the wrong item came out. I did not expect an apology for bringing the wrong thing (I mean, couldn't hurt, right?) but to talk about your table ten feet away from it is rude, especially when we have done nothing wrong.I also asked for vegetables with brown rice. She said they come with fried rice. I said, \"But you have brown rice on the menu, if you can please just substitute it. Even if it costs more.\" She finally says ok. Everyone finishes their salad and move to entrees. It takes ages, but I finally get my correct salad. Everyone else at the table is nearly finished with everything by the time she sets a bowl of veggies on the table in front of me, then hurries away. I did not even have time to ask about the brown rice that was supposed to be with it. Yet another 15 or so minutes later, as she walks by I call her over and ask where the brown rice is, and she rudely says, \"It's coming\" and walks away again, like I'm a huge bother for asking for what I ordered 45 minutes ago. Everyone finishes their meals as my veggies get cold waiting for the rice. Another 15 or 20 minutes later, she comes back to say, \"We can't make brown rice right now.\" (As they were not getting ready to close, they simply did not \"want\" to. But they are the ones who took so long and pushed us to closing time... we were there plenty early. At this point the veggies are cold and I am missing half of my dinner, so I tell her to just take it off the ticket and I will eat elsewhere. No one comes to apologize for the mess ups and bad service. No one offers to discount the table or anything to make it right. And, in fact, she charges my husband an extra $1.50 for some condiment or something he wanted. So they treat us like dirt, then nickel and dime us. I could not leave this place fast enough.

I split two rolls (Alaskan and over the Rainbow) with the friend for $20 (including tax/tip).

We realize that the numerous variates of \"fried cream cheese, fake king-crab and gobs of spicy mayonnaise rolls\" soaked in lower sodium soy sauce are quite yummy. \u00a0But, I am evaluating primarily on the raw fish part, not the deep-fried tapas that passes for \"sushi\" at so many restaurants.With that being said I am sad to report that the quality of the sushi has declined to the point where it is slightly below average, and the service has dropped to well below average.To wit, my yellow tail rolls came with little \"chips\" of yellow tail as opposed to the finger cuts that I had become accustomed to here. \u00a0I suspect these were the remnants from someone else's sashimi. \u00a0Same for the Alaska roll - filled with chips of salmon - not so fresh either. Salad came with only a hint of dressing. Sake arrived with the saran wrap still clinging to the carafe (because they microwaved it to heat it). Carafe was hot, but sake was not. Sent it back...microwaved again, now hot - but they didn't refill the carafe, so we paid $10 for half a small carafe of sake.

The sushiya explained to me the difference in quality of rice that they use. The rice is not dry like most other sushi places. It's moist and has a hint of sweetness to it. Also, the fish is always really fresh here. You can actually taste the fish. Most places hide the fish with mayo and other sauces. Sushiyobi makes great rolls. The prices are pretty good too.

My main complaint about that interaction was the guilt trip I received after the chef said it would be alright for me to order. I said, very clearly, that I understood if it was too late. They're about to close, I get it. If you say you'll take my order, then just take it. If it's that much trouble that close to closing, then say that you can't and I'll be happy to get my food elsewhere. Overall, the quality of the food I ordered was great.

They have the regular rolls you see everywhere, and the cook's special additions to the menu. I'm an Eel & Avocado kind girl, which can either be cooked to perfection or cooked enough then slathered in Eel sauce as a cover up.

They have green tea nestle chocolate and Kit Kats in different flavors.

There it was, dead mouse right at our shoeless feet the whole dinner. Waiter and Management offered nothing but a sad apology.

Surprisingly it's a pureed conglomeration of carrots, apples, sesame oil, sesame paste, onions. Sells for $4.50 next door and makes for a great marinade at home along with just drinking it after you've devoured even the crappiest lettuce. Miso soup- divine. Fresh, crispy tempura. Broiled eel- delightful. Also love the Spring Roll, Futomaki and Nashville roll.

The last two times that I have been (within the last month) I have had horrible service. The food took forever to come out and the waitress barely serviced our table. Our food this past week came out very late and cold. They even didn't divide up the order correctly so there was a bit of guessing at who ordered what. Everyone at the table came over to apologize about the wait and the food, but no one really offered to do anything to fix it. \u00a0Eventually after a bunch of back and forth and them remaking some food- they reduced our bill significantly.

We got 5 rolls- 3 of which I remember Moon special- great roll but had carrot and cucumber mixed around, unsure of it other than filler and seaweed salad. It was a good portion but at 18$ should be. Overall good. The Atlantic roll was well prepared and delicious Get it! The mowie wowie was different and everyone enjoyed it. I could see sushi purists being up in arms that it had untraditional topping of citrus salsa that was borderline hipster. It's worth a try. The overall vibe of the place was trendy and relaxing.

We decided to get a sample of three different choices, one was the Cali roll, one was a avocado type deal, and the other one was some kind of crazy spicy tuna, which was worst one. \u00a0We about puked on the tuna one, which I think the waitress noticed and she removed it from our bill.We ended up going across the street to the Gold Rush to get by bar food, even though we probably got lung cancer. \u00a0It was better than terrible sushi. Nothing is worse than terrible sushi."], ["FoodCritic 6.", "This place was okay! Not all that. Very nice and upscale place. Whet there with a group of friends waiting one hour for our food.

We had 2 appetizers: seaweed salad and tomato/avocado salad. Both were delicious, but the tomato/avocado salad lacked some flavor which was quickly remedied by some sea salt. We had 3 sushi rolls: Cali, Crunchy Shrimp, and Dragon. Would definitely get the last 2 again. Outstanding!! The Cali was a crab and mayo blend, not a whole piece of crab. Had more flavor but not a lot of crab meat. We took our desserts to go: truffles, and salted caramel cheesecake. \u00a0Small portions but divine!!

I figured I would rejuvenate myself and then go home. It was a busy Friday night. I was given an alert buzzer and sat at the bar to have a drink while waiting. It was interesting to notice that many of the people coming in after me all looked a bit alike, blonde hair teenage types with necks craned to see who was there. It didn't take very long until I was seated and was much shorter than initially expected. My appetizer was AgeDofu. It was served in a bowl large enough for bouillabaisse. The nondescript liquid reached halfway up the tofu. I didn't finish it. \u00a0I ordered several rolls off the menu. Out of the three rolls I ordered I ate two pieces of each. I usually take food home after grazing, but none of this was worth it. All I kept thinking was if an out of towner came here to eat they would really think we were backward. The architects get kudos. The chefs? Certainly not chefs but most likely low paid employees who desperately needed jobs. Avoid this place unless you want to have a drink on the patio. Avoid this place if you ever had good food in your life and know the dif. Avoid this place if you don't want to take a cigarette lighter and just burn your money in front of your eyes. Just AVOID this place unless as I said before to have a drink and sit outside. Do you want good sushi?

Keep in mind that we DO NOT mind paying 100 dollars for dinner for two. We usually eat a higher end meal at LEAST once a week. We've been to multiple sushi joints all over nashville. Including places like Samurai, Tenno, and Wild Ginger (HIGHLY recommend). We definitely had high expectations for this place. VISUALLY: VERY appealing. The atmosphere is great, wine list had a good variety. We ordered the ex-girlfriend which was one of our server's favorite. It was pretty good! my boyfriend got some kind of sushi platter that came with a basic roll. The roll that came on his platter was just SO BLAND. It was just lacking that burst of flavor that a roll should have. Not only that, i noticed my boyfriend was not touching his sashimi or nigiri pieces. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that it smelled funny. Being a server myself, i always want to give the restaurant and it's workers the benefit of the doubt. I've dealt with one too many difficult customers that were just so rude. Eventually, i took a whiff of the fish, and WOW DID THAT THING SMELL. It actually smelled like ...well, FISH. Like it had been left out too long instead of in the fridge or something. Just COULD NOT eat it. Definitely disappointed. I think we paid about 70 dollars including tip? but it was not worth out money. Not thinking of going back. Maybe just to try their sweet potato mousse and kitchen dishes? but for the sushi? nope. no thank you."], ["Leslie J.", "I guess my expectations were too high, as this restaurant has been recommended as one of the new hot spots in Nashville, and not just for sushi. Well, I was a little underwhelmed. The sushi was good, without a doubt, but, it's hard to make a roll worth $18. There were also some little things...like the fact that their \"house\" champagne is J Roget?? It's $3.00/bottle at the wine store...the worst. And, they sell it for $7/glass?? Come on, now. Any decent restaurant should not have J Roget in their establishment! The hot sake also seemed bland, with a watered down flavor. The highlight of our meal was the ceviche...oddly! Lots of fresh fish and shellfish mixed with pico, and avocado slices on the side. It came with a basket of chips which were not even needed. The ceviche can stand alone! As far as atmosphere goes, the space is beautiful...large/open, clean, modern, and with an outdoor patio that will be great when it cools off a bit.

It's urban. It's everything a new downtown restaurant should be. On mondays and thursdays apparently they do a few of the cheaper rolls for half price, so we definitely took advantage of that. We also indulged in the crab-asiago w/ Naan appetizer which was good. I give it 3 stars mainly because the normal prices are pretty high for a sushi place, and the service was fine but not great. I'd give it a half star bump if I could. Aw screw it I'll give it 4 for trying."], ["Suz J.", "I just started their lunch club with my Lunch Club card from Nama Sushi. They stamp it when I go for lunch and give me a $20 gift certificate on my tenth lunch visit. The Soy Joy albacore tuna roll is about eight pieces of sushi with crumchy cucumber and my preferred there. It's flavored with horseradishy wasabi and a generous application of eel sauce. Nama in the E23 is a little snazzier than the typical Nashville sushi restaurant. Table settings and service are comparable to the Belle Meade sushi place I go to although the sushi at the west sushi bar is better. Prices match this West End location, so I'll be going in the future when they have their half off / half price specials on the sushi or on the alcohol."], ["Randi T.", "always excited to try a new sushi place in town. \u00a0our usual go-to is Samurai, this place is definitely an upscale version with overloaded rolls.we were overwhelmed with the menu but our server was super patient with us. \u00a0we started with the calamari salad - DELISH. \u00a0thumbs up. \u00a0next was the crab dip - thumbs up again. not sure I would order again, but my husband definitely would...the rolls...fancy scallop roll was okay.... just not that flavor full and full of creamy sauce. \u00a0we did the sushi platter chef's choice ($25) and got to choose what nigiri and sashimi fish we wanted (great plus to that) and also what special roll we wanted - the chef will make anything. \u00a0our server told us to pick one of the expensive rolls and we can alter it any way we want. \u00a0long story short, we got the wrong roll and thank god. \u00a0it was fried (was that a fried eggplant on my sushi?) and was drowning in creamy sauce. \u00a0our server saw it was wrong and came right over and got us a new roll. \u00a0the new one was good but again, 3 sauces too many. \u00a0the sashimi was really good and tasted fresh, thumbs up for that.we would go back, but not order rolls again, sashimi and appetizer orders only."]], "Two Ten Jack Izakaya & Ramen House": [["Austin G.", "Two Ten Jack is in East Nashville and a cool part of East Nashville.

We went on Friday when ramen master Nakamura was in the house. Oh. My. God. It was one of the best meals I've had in Nashville. Hands down, top two. We were offered five courses. They were as follows:1. Edamame and Tsukemono (pickled veggies) paired with a Lovely Rita2. Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi and sushi (a play on a Philly roll) paired with a Riesling3. Kara-age with negi dip (fried Japanese chicken) paired with the Death of Meiji4. Hatsu (chicken heart) and Australian Wagyu short rib with corn on the cob and miso butter paired with a German smoked beer5. Tori Paitan (ramen) paired with sakeHonestly, almost everything was a highlight. If I HAD to pick, I would say for starters the sashimi. Now this is how sashimi is supposed to be cut and taste. Holy moly, I was in heaven. I literally died and woke up in Japan. The fried chicken was fantastic, the miso butter corn was divine and the ramen. Oh my goodness, the ramen. Sorry Otaku, I hope you went and tasted how a broth should be made. It was tasty, not too fatty, and bold. And the pork! it melted in my mouth. I am literally salivating writing this review. Someone please send me a bowl of his ramen! The drink pairings worked as well, no complaints there.As for the decor and atmosphere, the place is slick. They really thought about the concept and made it come to life. I loved the lighting, the tables, the bar, the colors. Can you tell I liked it? Loved it!Based on the first four courses, I have high hopes for the place!

We were led to a booth that was comfortable and roomy for the five of us. Our waitress was nice and relatively knowledgable. Friends ordered cocktails and beers that they were all happy with, and I got a mocktail that was deliciously minty and cheap ($4). I ordered miso soup, which was very tasty, but in light of my ramen experience, unnecessary. My friends and I got a couple of small plates to share. The crispy Brussels sprouts were VERY tasty, if you like Brussels sprouts (and I sure do!). The J.F.C. was alright, but nothing to write home about, and certainly not something I'd pay $7 for again. I ordered the corn yakitori, which was \"half of a half\" of an ear of corn, grilled to perfection, slathered in magical miso butter that I would swim in if given the opportunity, and topped with a small mountain of grated horseradish. I could've eaten about 4 more of them. SO delicious. I ordered the chicken ramen, and it was fabulous. The broth was so hearty, flavorful, and velvety! The noodles had great, slightly chewy texture and were much more substantial than the average noodle dish. I didn't eat the soft boiled egg, because I can't eat runny eggs...it stresses me out. Overall, excellent flavorful dish. I'd definitely order it again.My only issue with this place is the pricing! The portions are fine, and are in my opinion, a refreshing departure from the usual \"eat-til-you're-ashamed\" portions everywhere else. It's just that everything seems to be about $2-$4 too expensive..doesn't seem like much until you order multiple dishes (which is advised) and have a pretty expensive bill. I wouldn't order starters again, as I wasn't impressed, but the service was good, the vibe was decent, and the food tasted great, so I can concede 4 out of 5 stars.

It was like I was in a nice, non-pretentious hipster-landia.The same cool ambiance, rustic-chic decor, and slightly unusual (yet still authentic to its roots) food - in this case Japanese.

We had two servers, one was just starting out, and they were both highly attentive, explained everything perfectly and extremely social with us. This is EXACTLY what I want in a server. We took the Izakaya route and started with the Poke and Shishito Peppers, along with a small hot sake. I have to say that the figs were a perfect touch to the peppers and the sesame chicharron added the perfect crisp to the Poke. Next we tried the Gojira Roll and it came out with a HUGE shrimp head that had the sweetest and juiciest meat, holy cow! SO. Freaking. Good. Then came the Pork Belly and Hotate yakitori. Both of them melted in our mouths but the Hotate (scallop) was probably the best scallop I've ever had. No joke. It was in this buttery sauce that just made you moan out loud without realizing it. Good thing the atmosphere wasn't silent... We ended with the Tonkotsu ramen which was too die for! There wasn't much pork belly and I was happy about that, seeing as we had just devoured the fattiest piece of seared pork belly with the yakitori.Everything was epic! I can't stop telling EVERYONE I know about this place! From the service to the food, we walked out of there pleased as punch.

Parking is no longer a total disaster, so you needn't factor that into your dining decision. We only glimpsed the inside decor for a second because we chose to sit outside, but the place looked really swank. There was even a silent projection of one of Michel Ocelot's stopmotion-style silhouette animations, which means the person in charge of design has excellent taste. As an added bonus, Jeni's ice cream is just a few steps away, meaning you can cap off an excellent meal with an amazing dessert. The server started us off by saying that the restaurant was intended to be some sort of traditional japanese pub, where diners would typically eat several courses, starting with smaller ones and working their way up to a final dinner-sized something (like ramen). I heard other servers parrot this introduction to those that were seated around us, and I have to say, I found it annoying. It was as though they were saying, \"Welcome to our restaurant. If you would like an authentic experience, please order one of everything from the menu.\" It sort of left us feeling like the American assholes that just came for ramen.But we did actually order a smaller plate of sashimi, because it caught our eye. The pastrami hamachi ($10) is topped with mustard roe and rye olive oil, and it is, in a word, incredible. The fresh white fish was the perfect canvas for these bolder unexpected flavors.We then got what we came for, ramen. My husband ordered the tonkatsu ($14) and I ordered the tori paitan ($13). Both soups had incredible depth of flavor. The chicken meatballs in my soup were deliciously bright (were there notes of citrus and ginger?). The broth in my husband's tonkatsu was rich, but not too heavy. The noodles were perfectly chewy.

She was very helpful with recommendations and translating anything on the menu. Their menu is small and not super descriptive of the items. What I mean is very vague. I ordered the sunomono which typically is octopus or conch served with some cucumber and rice vinegar. What actually came out was a small plate with shredded lettuce and just a few small pieces of octopus and scallop. $9 for that. Next I ordered a miso soup which was good but too salty and that's a lot coming from me because I'm the kind of person who likes salty stuff and it was $5 for this little cup of it. Lastly I ordered the volcano roll just to give it one more shot. Ugh. $15 for 4 pieces of ordinary \"sushi\" that lacked so much flavor. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the pork ramen and even he said it was way too salty but he ate it anyway because he was hungry.

For dinner (4pm-Close) prices are $1.25, $2.00, $2.50, $3.00, $3.50, and $4.00.Our server was prompt & asked our drink order & we told him we were going to have the $8.99 lunch special. It really is special. For $8.99 you'll have your pick of ANY plate on the train, except the pricey red plates. It's ALL YOU CAN EAT. The train has different rolls, from cooked to raw. It also has desserts that coast around on it. The sushi. The sushi is good. It's comparable to what you'd get at a good sushi restaurant. It isn't AMAZING, but for the price you cannot beat it. From the rolls I had, only two I didn't care for. One was because I grabbed a \"Philadelphia roll\" that was cooked. I didn't see the cooked part & I hate smoked salmon. It tastes like cat food (I don't know what cat food tastes like). The second one I had was a tuna roll that had been on the train too long, the rice on the outside was dryish. Overall it's a neat little dining experience & a great value for the $8.99 lunch special. I like the freshness of most of the rolls and also the ability to try different rolls & not get stuck with a bunch of pieces. Will I be back again? If I get a sushi craving & I'm in the area, you bet."], ["Beth G.", "Pretty decent for conveyor belt sushi.Service is very good at dinner not sure abt lunch never been. Habachi good too without being crazy expensive. Pretty dang good forLandlocked sushi with entertainer in the train and nice service."], ["Michelle P.", "This is definitely a hit or miss place. I really wanted to love this place...but I couldn't in the end. Yes conveyor sushi is a novel experience but the inconsistent quality of fish (read great salmon horrible sea urchin) and service leaves me ambivalent. The groupon deal did ease the blow a bit. The hostess sat us while taking a phone call (as in she picked up the phone as she was showing us to our seats and then scuttled off). The server was very thorough and genuine with his recommendations and catering to our needs even knowing we were primarily here for the a la carte sushi. They have beautiful presentation for their ordered rolls like the pacific roll, but personally that flavor mix was not to my taste (still beautiful though!). So while I did not find myself in love with the place it is worth say a lunch or if you really really want to catch your sushi with good company it's worth some loving on. Just please don't get the sea urchin. It broke my heart (just a little bit)."], ["Zeb M.", "Sushi Train is basically what you'd expect from its name. It's decent sushi, but not a place I would go to unless I'm pressed for time or want a cheap dinner - which can easily be cheap as long as you're careful about what plates you're grabbing from the conveyor belt. The restaurant is very modern and clean, and it's never busy when I'm there, so it's not a bad place. Just, you know. Okay."], ["Heather R.", "Remember that game on Pok\u00e9mon Stadium in which you had to eat sushi off the conveyor belt? The one where I always thought, \"Wouldn't it be the coolest if this was an actual thing?\"Turns out, that is an actual thing.Sushi Train is definitely an experience that everyone should try once. Sushi goes by your table on a conveyor belt, and it is your task to be attentive and quick enough to grab the good ones as they go by. You are charged based on the number of plates you have at the end of the meal (each color is worth a different amount, going up to $4 \u00a0for the most expensive--prices are eminently reasonable). Of course, if you are not really a sushi eater, you can always skip the super-fun part of this whole restaurant experience and opt to try hibachi or Chinese food off the more traditional menu instead. Now, while there is something delightful about grabbing sushi off a conveyor belt, the delight tends to fade once the food is motionless in front of you, largely because the sushi is only okay. It has a nice personality, but you wouldn't want to go out with it again."], ["Victoria L.", "Sushi delivered fresh to your table via... conveyor belt? Yes it's exactly what it sounds like, my friends. I guess Sushi Conveyor Belt isn't quite as catchy. I love sushi and the concept is really fun. I usually feel like I'm going to explode when I eat sushi simply because I can't decide on one or two rolls and end up over eating due to my severe sushi FOMO. (Fear Of Missing Out). Since the whole concept of Sushi Train revolves around getting tiny plates of sushi samples I don't have that problem here. Anything I've ever ordered off the menu was fresh. However, I know you're really here for the \"train\". If you're going to use the train instead of the menu, you probably want to keep your table to 4-6 people. Beyond that, the people at the far end can't see anything as it whizzes by. This takes away from the experience and could cost you a few friendships if you're not careful. Sometimes the sushi on the train isn't very fresh and they seem to have trouble keeping certain rolls stocked. If you see something you like you better grab it fast because dinner will be over before it comes back around. The restaurant is clean and I've always experienced good service. That being said, the sushi isn't outstanding but compared to what usually passes for sushi in Nashville, I definitely recommend stopping by. Be careful though, those little plates add up quickly!"], ["Alexandra F.", "I don't what it is about sushi train, but it's so good. I've never dined in, but I imagine it's and even better experience.

Everyone is very friendly. They have great lunch specials where you can get two or three rolls and soup or salad and it's very reasonably priced. Every time I eat here I want more. Can't say enough great things about this place.Order the crunchy shrimp roll! It's my favorite of the \"not super expensive\" rolls."], ["Ellen F.", "Chooo choo. I'm a very efficient conductor at the train. Pull them, and eat them. Don't over think it. Here's how it works, the plates are color coded. Unfortunately, they add up QUICK, so the R x R crossing can be dangerous if you don't look both ways. \u00a0There's also an average of three pieces per plate, so if you can, board the train with a group divisible by three.

This one was exciting, but not really for the food so much as the atmosphere.When you walk in, you can't tell if they were going for a nightclub or weird 70's diner feel. The neon and LED lights all over suggest nightclub, but the enormous windows have a screen or something over them, it always looks dreary outside no matter what the weather.The main attraction here isn't the sushi so much as how it gets to you. A waiter brings your drinks, and then, if you're ordering from the lunch menu as I have, you pay $8.99 for all the plates you want that aren't red (the red ones are extra). \u00a0A refrigerated conveyor belt snakes throughout the restaurant, with placards before each dish revealing what they are. When you spot a dish you like, simply lift up one of the tube doors and grab it! They don't seem to restock too often, so you might be out of luck if the dish you want doesn't appear on the first go round...or the second.The sushi itself is all right, but it didn't stand out to me in any way. The dishes seemed heavy on the tempura and spicy mayo, and the healthier options seemed smaller and less exciting on the plate. My verdict: Sushi Train will satisfy a sushi craving (on the cheap), and give you some novelty along the way. Lunch with coworkers, sure - but try something more upscale if you're looking for say, a date spot."], ["Mike S.", "This place is worth checking out with a groupon, esp for dinner. Their all you can eat for lunch is pretty decent as well (apparently just $9!) Some of their entrees are kind of weird, like adding cream cheese to sushi, but I suppose that as a Southern thing ;) For my first time I would just check out the train and not order anything from the menu. The biggest thing about raw fish is that it NEEDS to be fresh, and I be found it to be reasonably so.My only complaint is that there is too many tuna dishes and not enough of the others, but that's a personal thing."], ["Krystal S.", "This place is great.

I think Sushi Train's problem is that the train is too long and the menu is too big! The sushi isn't BAD...it's just not that high quality. I've been here twice and did the train the first time and the hot dinner menu the second. My train dinner was just OK, but was pretty fun to pull stuff off the train. It ended up being kinda expensive for mediocre sushi, but I had a nice time. I opted to try the hot dinner meal the next time and asked our waitress for details regarding a specific tofu menu item (Ma Po) and all she could tell me was that it was a tofu dish with spicy sauce. No other details. So I went for it (was this a mistake? maybe). And, just as she told me, out came a plate with tofu and a red, gelatinous spicy sauce. It was like an entire grocery store block of medium-firm tofu chopped up on a plate with sauce. No vegetables. No frills. Just tofu. With sauce. The tofu was just heated, not pan fried or anything so it was really soft which some people may prefer, but I certainly do not. It was definitely edible. My boyfriend gave me his mushrooms from his Yang's spicy chicken to give me some texture to my mush pile. It just really wasn't my favorite, but it WAS cheap and a huge portion (comes with rice, salad and soup too!), so there's that. Additionally, I never got a water refill. The waitresses were nice and all, but really couldn't give us ANYTHING when it came to our menu questions. \u00a0The restaurant is huge, which I think might be a detriment.

My wife and I have been looking for a sushi restaurant with the conveyer belt system for awhile now, as it creates a kind of novelty dining experience. We've only lived in Nashville a few months now, so when my wife saw their ad in the Scene, we jumped at the chance to eat mobile sushi. The overall atmosphere is semi intimate and somewhat communal with small tables and bright colors.The conveyer belt winds through most of the restaurant offering small plates of sushi at interval pricing. Pricing per plate also varies by lunch or dinner times. We happened to go on my wife's birthday during lunch. When we got there, there were only about 5 other people which was good, because it meant that we wouldn't have to wait long for sushi or worry about missing out by being at the end of the train. During lunch, prices range from $0.99 to $3.25. And if you go on your birthday you get $15 off if you spend $50 or more. It's quite a deal during lunch, because we had a hard time reaching $50 to begin with. My favorite thing about the train is that they offer more than just sushi on the train. They have appetizers like edamame and Asian style salads, and desserts like cheesecake and brownies. Sushi Train also offers food other than sushi. They have a menu with noodle dishes and other items. They also have tables away from the conveyer belt for larger parties. I highly recommend checking it out."], ["Corey W.", "So I've been to this place four times now with mixed results but overall I would give them good marks.First the service. The servers have always been very accommodating. You can tell they are new at it but always very accommodating and friendly. A few of them need to work on their English, but their friendliness always made up for this. All but the first time I went it has had fairly good foot traffic and the first time I went was a week after it opened. Never had a bad wait except on Sunday when they had an all you can eat Sushi train.Now the food. So I have had both off the train and off the menu. All the off the menu items I thoroughly enjoyed. It's mostly Japanese with a few other Asian dishes. If you find the train off putting (your loss) you can order rolls off the menu. Definitely try their tempura banana's and ice cream for desert. Now for the train. The novelty alone makes the trip worth it. Me not being terribly patient love the fact I can sit down and be eating within minutes. I timed it, it does take about 15min for the conveyor to make one full pass but I usually find something I like after a minute or 2. The other thing I love is I can get just 3-4 pieces from 3 or 4 different rolls for the same price I could get one roll of all the same. One issue you will have though, if you come on at a time they are packed and your at the end of the train it will be hard to get something you want. I've gone on a Friday night though and was sat at about the middle and had no troubles. Go on a Sunday and get seated at the end and you'll feel like the guy who went stag to the prom. Sitting by the punch bowl hungrily eying all the rejects no one else wanted.Some are scared off by the thought of sushi sitting around, but it travels in a refrigerated tube, and last time I checked they are touting a score by the local health department of a 98. If you don't like the thought of it being in a perfectly fine REFRIGERATED tube for 30 min or so before you eat it, order a roll off the menu."], ["Abby H.", "This was the first time I had ever been to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant and loved it!

It was more like kabobs than traditionally thin sliced teriyaki tasting yakitori. The chicken was terribly seasoned. It had hues of cinnamon and cumin, I believe. Kids wouldn't touch it and my kids love all foods, especially any type of chicken. We decided to get out while we could and ended up shelling out $30 for hardly anything- we were starving.

I loved the variety of sushi that was offered on the conveyor belt and tried different ones, including the California Roll, the Crunchy Shrimp Roll, and the Shrimp Avocado roll.

Being a sucker for both sushi and all things gimmicky, I had been wanting to check this place out for awhile. Finally went a couple of night ago for dinner before a night out. I can be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to certain ingredients, so I opted to order off of the menu rather than get my food off of the train. I should have known what I was in for when my miso soup came. It tasted like somebody had dumped a whole shaker of salt into it, and had only a single piece of tofu that might have been the tiniest I've ever seen.My friend ordered the tempura appetizer, and the shrimp was not tempura battered, but breaded with panko. Strangely, the veggies that came with it actually were battered, so it's probably a good indicator that the shrimp came out of a box. My boyfriend ordered some Chinese dish of chicken and broccoli, but couldn't eat it as the chicken was very undercooked. I got the Dream Roll without cucumber, and had to force myself to finish it only because I was starving and didn't have time to get food elsewhere afterwards. I kept taking out components to figure out what was making it taste so awful, but I never could pinpoint the culprit. It was all bad. I had intended on getting desert off of the train, I assumed the Oreo mouse pie was probably made elsewhere and therefore might be ok (which it was) but the waitress was really pushy about asking which one I wanted and insisted on finding it along the conveyer belt for me, rather than letting me get it myself, thus taking away even the gimmicky fun of the experience. Also, around halfway through our meal, we all noticed little bits of something floating in our water.

We arrived at 4:37, a few minutes after they started their dinner service.b.) Location. We were seated near the front of the conveyer belt.c.) Attentive service. Coming in early, we didn't have to compete with other diners for the waitress' attention. She filled our waters several times.We're both from the west coast, so the novelty of \"kaiten zushi\" / conveyer belt sushi wasn't what we came here for (although I did find the conveyer belt longer than I expected it to be). \u00a0We both have husbands who don't like sushi so we decided we could go together.Although we got there early, the chefs were still rushing to get the sushi prepared. I'd say it was still a good 10-15 minutes until the conveyer belt started moving. We were in no hurry.Place is new, so it was clean. I didn't care much for the lighting -- it was too low / yellow. My vision isn't the greatest. so low lighting made the large font announcing the food slightly harder to read than it should.We both ordered miso soup from the menu, but we intended to get whatever interested us from the belt. Because they had just started dinner service, the same dishes came around about twice. By the time we left, there were definitely a lot more variety. Unfortunately for my friend, the one dish she wanted (her go-to dish) came after we had settled the bill. We were surprised that the belt started off with a lot of desserts. Maybe they were intended to be there a while. There were a lot of sushi with random fruit on top or cream cheese. And there was the traditional fare, both cold and hot. Because we were there early, I could have confidently tried the hot food; any later and I would have stuck with the cold.The belt was slow enough that you shouldn't miss what you wanted, but fast enough that the food cycled through in time for you to get what you want. I'd say the sushi was good. I still won't question where they source the fish. I've been dying for sushi that I didn't care. Overall, because we were able to get (mostly) what we wanted and got out within 45 minutes, it was an enjoyable experience. Perhaps this review would be reduced by a star had we come in after 5. By the time we left, the place was already filling up quickly."], ["Charles H.", "Okay, this sushi is probably not \"4 star\" worthy but the experience and value deserve top marks.The concept (which I believe is common in Japan) is different than any other Nashville sushi joint. The sushi revolves around the restaurant and diners are able to select which dishes they would like. Again, the sushi is mediocre but the value, concept and excellent service get top marks in my book!"], ["Alice H.", "I agree with some of the other posters--the food is just fine, but you know what? It's a gimmicky kind of place and I had fun. After reading several of the reviews, I was disappointed to be seated near the very end of the train, but perhaps we were there when it was slow enough that it didn't seem to matter. It's not amazing food, but I'll be back for sure. I do wish there would have been some more low-end cost items, but even still, it was good and fun!"], ["Ashley V.", "This is a fun concept, & it gives you the freedom to try a lot of different rolls. Each plate has 3-4 pieces, so you can try lots without getting stuffed. Plus, it's fun to watch all the options come by on the conveyor belt. The one downside: for anything you have to order, the service is slow."], ["Allison B.", "The food on the train is cold, so it's the quality of grocery-bought sushi. & when I went, the food I ordered off of the menu took forever to get, and it was nothing special at all. My advice? Go across the parking lot to Sonobona. They're AMAZING!!!"], ["Monica P.", "Sushi was good, but I've had better. They do have a variety so that's a plus.

It was awesome trying different rolls. The signs are super informative too telling you what's on each roll. Super yum!"], ["Jacob T.", "This place really is the best bang for your buck Sushi restaurant in Town. Being well versed in Sushi, I truly respect the food at this place. They have tastiest, best size servings in Town as well as a full Asian menu. Check it out during lunch time! Very affordable off-the-train Sushi of all kinds as well as the $9.00 3-roll lunch special which I personally always get and I choose the Salad as my side. Their House Salad Dressing is so good."], ["Rachel M.", "Ok, so I noticed that whatever this used to be (it escapes me...was it Chinese?) had suddenly turned into something called Sushi Train when I was running over to Target on my lunch break one day. I was like \"and so close to Sonobana?\" The only reason I even noticed it is because the building that housed Calhoun's is gone and you can see in that direction now. I remember thinking \"Well, I'll look that up on Yelp later and see what other braver-than-me people are saying.\" I'm very particular about sushi...if it's a new place I want other people to have tried it first. So, thanks, all who have written reviews before me. AnywayIt was the Friday before Christmas, and my husband and I actually had the same day off of work (you'd think that since I'm off for a whole week every other week this would happen more often, but it doesn't). We had already had cheeseburgers from Hoss's Loaded Burgers for breakfast-starting the day off right and all that-and we were trying to decide what to do for lunch (to give you a time frame, breakfast was at 1 in the afternoon, so it was about 6:30 when we were trying to decide this). I suggested this place because my husband has always been enamored of kaiten sushi bars as was beyond excited when I told him we had one now. We hopped in the car and made the trek from Smyrna to White Bridge Road. Since it was the Friday before Christmas, I don't know if the crowd there was indicative of a normal Friday night crowd, but it wasn't that busy. The hostess told us it would be about 20 minutes. We were seated in under 10 minutes. We got lucky and got the two seats at the very beginning of the conveyor belt...as in, we were the first ones to see what was coming around. It doesn't take much to excite me. As mentioned in previous reviews, the plates are different colors, and each color is for a different price. Off the top of my head, red is $4.00 (the most expensive) and light blue is the cheapest ($1, I think). When you see something you want, lift the door and grab it. I was elated to find out that the conveyor belt was covered and refrigerated. I have a thing about people potentially breathing on my food. I want as little of it done as possible. I can't stand buffets. Also, no hot sushi. Yay! I'm getting off track...You can have your meal two ways: order off the menu (you can get larger sushi rolls, noodle dishes, rice dishes, appetizers, etc) or grab your whole meal off the conveyor belt. My husband and I had the bright idea that to save money we were going to order something off the menu and then 'supplement' it with a couple of plates of sushi a piece. Yeah...don't do that. After I saw all of the different kinds of sushi go by, that's all I wanted. I think I ate one noodle out of my plate of chicken udon (I didn't like it very much, either...but I think it was me, not the noodles). We ended up grabbing like 8 plates of sushi. I recommend the 'Crazy Girl' roll. It's a $4 one, but it's worth it. There was one roll that looked very interesting, but we were too chicken to try it. I think it was called 'Surf and Turf,' and it had several types of fish and green apple. Their Spider roll is good as well. There was also one called the Naruto roll that went around right when we sat down, but by the time that part of the belt came back to us it was all gone. We waited for it the entire time we were eating and for about 30 minutes afterward. Finally my husband mentioned it to our server, and she was like \"Oh, I can tell them to make it for you!\" So if there's ever something you're craving or wanting to try and you don't see it, just ask for it. The roll was on the conveyor belt in less than 5 minutes, and it was well worth the \"if we had known to ask for it\" wait. Long story short: we loved it. It's a fun thing to do for date night. I totally recommend it."], ["Tripp E.", "Don't diss the train. People smirk at the novelty of conveyor belt sushi but there's something there, it's a great way to sample smaller amounts of many different rolls. There's a silly sense of urgency because you don't know if that one you want to try will come back around but that's the fun of it. I pulled off a salmon and yellowtail sashimi, I did not expect to see straight sashimi choochoo'ing down the line. I went with 2 friends using an Amazon local coupon but blew that $30 value on 2 bottles of Nigori sak\u00e8. We didn't order any food off the menu, no edimame, soup or desserts, just belt sushi. With STUFFED bellies we racked up about $65 of food before tax between the 3 of us, that's seems pretty reasonable to me. We all thought the fish tasted fresh and the rolls used quality ingredients. One of us liked the Snow White (white tuna roll) but did not see anymore coming so we asked the server and she snagged one for us! We also found and ate salmon roe wrapped in an artfully cut cucumber cup, surf clam and octopus nigiri. I look forward to going back but maybe I'll skip the overpriced Nigori."], ["Benjamin S.", "Finally, a kaiten sushi bar closer to home. What was once a ho-hum asian buffet is now an awesome sushi restaurant featuring conveyer belt sushi! The prices for any given plate range from 99 cents (for an all veggie roll), to $4.00.My fiancee and I waited for what seemed like forever for this place to open, and when it did we were not disappointed. They have a great variety of sushi rolls and even some nigiri that circulate on the enclosed, chilled, conveyor. All you do is lift up the door next to your table, and reach in and grab what you want. I will say that this place just barely makes 5 stars as some of the rolls fell apart (never a good thing); but they make up for it with the variety and the fact that each line of sushi is preceded by a sign traveling on the conveyor telling you what type of sushi is next. Their spicy salmon and tuna rolls were amazing as were the regular ones. I did not find one bad roll on the line.So bring your money, cause it can add up really fast, and a big appetite, you will not be disappointed. That being said, if sushi is not your thing, they also have a selection of Chinese and Japanese dishes you can order straight from the kitchen."], ["Micheal P.", "I was hesitant to go to this place because of the mixed reviews, but I'd obviously have to try it at some point... because conveyor belt of sushi!So, here it is. The train is novel. The sushi is just fine, but not stellar. And expensive. Seats are hard to get because everyone is excited about a train of sushi. If you, like me, ignore these reviews and go because this place has the market cornered on trains of sushi in Nashville, then here are your tips.Go early on a weeknight. If you have to wait, ask the hostess for a drink menu and someone will come by and take your drink order. When you get to the train, you'll be tempted to take a familiar roll (like salmon and cucumber), because you're hungry. Be patient. Sushi Train doesn't do basic rolls better than your favorite sushi place (and your favorite sushi place is Ginza, right??), so don't waste your money on them. Instead, wait for the specialty rolls to come around and get the surf and turf. In fact, get all of the surf and turf rolls you see. This is the one shining gem of sushi train. The uncommon ingredients blend to a bright and pleasant flavor twist on typical sushi. If I were forced to return this place, I'd sit at a non-train table and order this roll, even though I stick to bonafide legitimate japanese sushi at other restaurants (If you tell me you usually order pansy-ass crazy fried rolls, I have stopped reading your reviews).choo choo, nashville."]], "Orchid Thai & Sushi": [["Adam W.", "Absolutely amazing. \u00a0I LOVE spicy thai food, and if you order Very Hot (level 4 of 5), it's actually very hot.

We had saw they had 3 for $11 deal. We ordered 6 rolls in total & two ordered of spring rolls. On the menu, it's worded like you just get one spring roll for $3, but you actually get 2 rolls for $3. We used a new app called Favor to deliver the food. We ordered the following rolls, avocado, crunchy shrimp, crunchy crab, spicy tuna, tuna, & salmon & avocado. I liked the tuna, it was a large piece used in \u00a0the roll. I noticed that they are a little stingy with the avocado. There wasn't much of it in the avocado roll or the salmon & avocado roll. The spicy tuna was minced tuna, I prefer when it's a piece that is marinated in the spicy sauce. It also could use a little more spice. The crunchy crab & shrimp was a mistake to get as a to go roll because the panko crumbs were chewy, not the restaurants fault though. The rolls come with ginger, wasabi & a nice little cup of soy sauce & not the annoying packets. The spring rolls were good, a nice crunch to them & were accompanied with duck sauce.

(Lost is kind of my forte).In any case, we were seated quickly and got our drinks. There was great happiness at the table when we discovered the lunch menu on the back page - huge portions still and a great lunch price tag! The options were only slightly pared down from the dinner menu, too so it still took us a while to decide.We ended up sharing an appetizer plate for the table and I got the Basil Noodles lunch portion as my main - spicy level 4 out of 5 - very hot. Per norm, we were treated to the yummy little broth soup that comes out to whet your appetite shortly after we ordered. Our appetizer platter came out fairly promptly after that and was plenty for the table of five even though it was two spring rolls and four dumplings. The chicken was moist and flavorful and he sauces that came out with the appetizer platter were very yummy with one sweet and spicy and another peanut butter-y goodness. We hadn't gotten to the point where hunger means you actually finish off the full appetizer platter before our main dishes came out. I really liked my spicy noodles - they were the perfect spicy level I'd expect when I ask for four out of five - flush to the face, slight sniffles start up and red lips can feel the capsicum. Mmm...I think the decor is a little cheesy, but neon lights aren't really my thing and it wasn't offensive at all - one big plus for dinners is that they didn't overcrowd the middle floor tables and (bonus!) their bathrooms were super clean. Overall, service was great, the place is well-laid out to feel like you can have a nice time here and not feel packed in or rushed - even if it had been busy - and the food was very tasty and a good value - especially lunch!

I had to give out this fact because any sushi restaurant runs by the Chinese is just a no-no for me. It is a very small restaurant, not good for big groups (more than 7). The sushi bar is tiny. I got stuck twice trying to get in and out of the sushi bar (the chairs are too big for a tiny bar). You literally will be rubbing shoulders with the person sits next to you. It could be a good thing if the one sitting next to you is hot! If not...well just enjoy your sushi! :)Keep in mind that Samurai specializes in sushi only and they do a wonderful job. The sashimi here are so fresh (Tip: put an \"S\" next to the item you order. For example: White tuna - S). My favorites are the White Tuna, Salmon, Unagi (get Nigiri - fresh fish with rice), Crab meat (special order, not on menu), and Yellow Tail. They serve the sashimi on top of cucumber salad, which was very crunchy and refreshing. The rolls are also very good. There isn't a roll I don't like from their Samurai Specialty Rolls and World Rolls menu. They have rolls that come with fruit. Very unique. If you like eel and avocado, I suggest getting the Red Dragon Roll.Tip: At the sushi bar, after you have filled out the sushi sheet, make sure to give it to the waiter. Don't put it on top of the glass case (other sushi restaurants do this) or your order won't get in. The only thing that kept me from visiting this place frequently is street parking.

You don't need to put 10 different things into a roll and then deep fry it and then cover it in eel sauce for it to be delicious. \u00a0Some good quality fish and properly prepared rice is really all you need. \u00a0Let the quality of the fish be the star of the roll and for the love of god stop deep frying everything. \u00a0Generations of Japanese are rolling in their graves. \u00a0And what is with this whole strawberry sushi craze? \u00a0I thought I'd give it a shot based on Yelp recommendations and 2 weeks on, my stomach still churns at the memory.It's not that Samurai is the absolute worst sushi in Nashville (you can go to Ken's for that), it's just that the food as a whole is really really mehhh. \u00a0I don't know if it's because TN has to source its fish from the coast and as a result all of its sushi restaurants suck or if its because Samurai just has a really cheap and therefore crappy fish supplier. \u00a0Either way, we wont' be back to Samurai.Pros: 1. the place is cheap. \u00a03 \"fancy\" rolls, 3 normal rolls, about 8 pieces of sashimi, and 2 beers was about $75ish with tip. \u00a02. the restaurant is also cleaner than Ken's though that particular standard of cleanliness isn't really tough to beat.3. most of the food isn't absolutely disgusting.Cons:1. the rolls consist of more ingredients than a Papa John's supreme pizza2. the fish isn't really like that fresh.3. overall just very average food."], ["Danny K.", "Simple and seemingly fresh Sushi, Samurai has nice menu of simple sushi dishes. \u00a0There's not much to speak on in terms of the atmosphere.

Upon relocating to the area from Florida, I'd hoped for more after reading reviews. I cancelled a reservation at Virago, because sushi shouldn't cost $20+/roll, and settled on the hole in the wall experience at Samurai. I ordered 5 rolls and gyoza. Fried rolls were mushy and tasted like flour encased rolls left over from Costco. 3/5 rolls fell apart and while the fish was decently fresh, I had to eat it deconstructed and opted to each by hand. One roll was soaked in sriracha and hardly edible...I think I'm hoping for too much in middle Tennessee and will continue to steer clear of seafood in landlocked territory.

It's not fast, there is a little lady in the kitchen cooking. team of one. don't get in a hurry good things take time. What really makes it a great experience for me is when the staff are willing to answer questions and make recommendations, and these folks are super nice and helpful. Several ladies came by to ask us how we liked everything and help us with the more exotic choices we made (they kept warning us to stir the hot pot so the rice wouldn't brown, but that is my favorite part!). The seafood pancake is an enormous yummy fried miracle. trust me if you like seafood/octopus you will love this. The ribs are awesome but you will have to fight the other people at your table for them. don't say i didn't warn you. If you go on friday night at 7 don't expect to be out of there in 30 minutes.

The teppanyaki that they call \"hibachi\". \u00a0It's nothing like a Benihana since they aren't as fun to watch. \u00a0With the hibachi, you get the meat of your choice (beef, chicken, salmon, and shrimp and you can choose how well done you want the beef). \u00a0I ordered the beef and even though they cooked it to medium rare as I had ordered, the beef they serve though is unfortunately not of great quality. \u00a0On my first visit with my group, we ordered different items and for those of us that didn't order the teppanyaki, we waited so long that our friends who did had already finished eating. \u00a0Our waitress though was quite helpful and did the best she could to keep us complacent. \u00a0On our second visit, we all ordered hibachi and this worked out much better.I haven't had their sushi so that judgement is reserved for another visit.Price: 4Food: 3Service: 4"], ["Matt L.", "I've tried a lot of sushi in Nashville, and have always felt it was a little lacking.

The gyoza was good, typical but good. The mahi mahi was cooked well, I had it taken off the grill before it was overcooked, gotta be careful with fish. I also tried my friend's calamari steak. It was pretty awesome I may have to get that next time. The wasabi margarita was not overpowering with just a hint of wasabi at the end. I was definitely pleasantly surprised.The sushi menu was pretty extensive and not too pricey either. I ordered the Pretty Woman Roll (shrimp tempura on the inside with raw tuna on the outside).

I usually rate sushi based on three criteria. Rice, Fish, and Presentation.Here, the sushi rice is of good consistency and taste. Not too dry, not too mushy. Good overall texture. Not too sweet or too much vinegar, but seasoned right for my palate.Here, the fish is always consistent. Fresh and vibrant in color. The raw scallop is so-so. \u00a0Sea urchin is good. Occasionally, they have specialty fish like Toro. The nigiri fish is sliced appropriately, in terms of size and thickness. Acceptable fish to rice ratio, but could be more delicate.Here, the presentation is average. I'm not expecting much, particularly since the prices are average. Again, not delicate but acceptable.As others mentioned, the location (in a strip mall) is quite deceiving. I would have skipped this place had I not stumbled upon it by accident. The interior is ok decorated with appropriate lighting. If it's busy, it can get a bit noisy inside due to the high ceilings and large interior space. Service is average, friendly. Sometimes a bit slow when busy, but expected. Sometimes when it's busy, they look clueless. They have sake, wine and specialty drinks, but I cannot comment on this since I get water.I love raw fish and shellfish. I love toro, hamchi and mirugai. Sadly for me, people in Nashville tend to favor the more common fish so this place doesn't carry the more selective fishes/shellfish on a regular basis. Ninki sometimes sells the fatty salmon skin, which I HIGHLY recommend. I typically order the nigiri or the chirashi here because ANY specialty rolls tend to mask the flavor of the rice and fish. I realize this may be desirable for some, but I prefer the raw taste. I eat all my raw seafood without any garnish - no cocktail sauce, lemon, nothing. Only wasabi and soy sauce. Sometimes, without it too. If I'm on a budget that day, I'll stick to ordering their maki rolls since it's always 50% off for dine-in customers. The hibachi is so-so. \u00a0Not my favorite, but I come here for the sushi.Ok, so maybe this wasn't a quick review. Too bad we can't do a powerpoint presentation, complete with animation. I'll end by saying this...the place is Japanese owned and operated. Why is this important? Because it is."], ["Amanda F.", "Cute, dark restaurant.

For dinner I had the Hibachi Salmon which was really good. I've never been to another Teppanyaki place that offered this so it was a pleasant surprise. The downside was the absence of Teriyaki Steak for the Hibachi.

Well, don't think too hard about it because Ichiban is here and fantastically real. The warm wood, full bar and expansive menu offers many experiences far past maki, I have found this restaurant to be one of the Music City's finest offerings when it comes to rolls.The only real issue is getting here. Ichiban doesn't have a parking lot and its location on 2nd Ave means that parking is an adventure in frustration. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been able to score street parking anywhere near the joint. So, when planning an evening here, think about transportation well in advance. Otherwise, you're setting yourself up for a bad time. Once you've figured out parking, however, everything else is aces.Whether dining in or eating out, make sure you take advantage of the marvelous maki that awaits at Ichiban. Being that I don't enjoy cream cheese or mayo or any sort on my rolls (come on, Americans; we can do better than that), my taste in rolls falls pretty squarely in the sushi chef's wheelhouse. I've been impressed by the Ichiban roll, spider roll, holly roll, rainbow roll, and caterpillar roll. All five have fantastic flavor, good balance, a nice amount of pieces for the prices, and none of the devil's condiments on raw fish. When feeling particularly hungry, you might even find me ordering a crab salad. While not the trendiest or most fab (location-wise) of sushi establishments in Nashville, Ichiban offers up really good product again and over again. Those 2nd Ave rents aren't cheap, y'all.

When planning his birthday, I decided to go somewhere I kept hearing was \"very authentic\". Ichiban did not disappoint! I must admit, I was concerned by its location... aka tourists. However, this place is one of those great hidden gems and surprisingly did not mimic the hustle and bustle of 2nd Avenue. The sushi was some of the freshest I've had in Nashville and the service was prompt and delightful. Our waitress even surprised him with a huge plate of green tea ice cream and lit candles once they overheard it was his birthday.I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience and food. I will definitely be returning!"], ["Michelle P.", "Surprisingly good and fresh sushi for middle Tennessee. Service was speedy and kind, definitely felt like a little world of its own, situated next to Goorin's hat shop on 2nd Ave as a subtle option for those wanting something different than the typical \"honky tonk\" experience for a meal. I really like their spicy tuna, which I know sounds really basic until I elaborate that I've worked almost 5 years in the sushi industry in the past and have yet to find a quality spicy tuna roll that wasn't caked in \"spicy mayo\". Ick. But they did it :) so for sushi purists, go all out here. From their caterpillar to fisherman roll to even the simple spicy tuna they do it right and well :)"], ["Toni M.", "I visit Ichiban about once a week for lunch. \u00a0The miso soup and salad are always a yummy start. \u00a0I love the lunch box choices. \u00a0The spider roll is my favorite. \u00a0Servers and chef are always happy. \u00a0A great little Japanese place in the literal heart of downtown."], ["Jena S.", "Great sushi spot here in downtown Nashville! There are some other good sushi restaurants here, but this one is legit. Even though it is located on 2nd Ave, it is kind of tucked away and not many tourists seem to patronize Ichiban.

The only thing it lacks on is atmosphere otherwise staff and food is wonderful. Will never stop going. #1 in my book!"], ["Don W.", "Ate lunch here the other day, while in town for a conference. Favorable reviews and walking distance to hotel led me to choose this restaurant from among three or four seemingly comparable choices.In a nutshell, I thought it was great. Giant clam and Uni were not only on the menu, but available. The albacore was phenomenal, and they had sea eel, which isn't always available at many sushi bars. I had these, as well as their Yellowtail, also excellent. They had a number of rolls and specialty rolls that several fellow patrons ordered, but they're not my thing.Highly recommend."], ["Julina K.", "Ichiban is my FAVORITE Japanese Restaurant here in Nashville. They have the Best Sushi, my favorite is the Dixieland roll, even their crunchy shrimp room is good. I ordered it for a friend that doesn't like to be too adventurous with sushi. I so always order the yellow tail fish neck & the soup, I forgot what's it's called but they know exactly what it is because I order it every time I go. Normally it's ramen noodles, but I like the udon noodles instead with pork and veggies. But I guarantee everything there is delicious and fresh. Oh and I love the grateful dead drink, it's a Long Island with chambord liqueur. It's strong, but good."], ["Tom K.", "The Sign is a little difficult to find on this restaurant heavy avenue. Went here for a nice sushi double date where we found decent prices and sushi. The service was great and very attentive. Being from the New York area, I found the ramen sub-par. At first glance, it appeared to have it all. But to be critical, Broth wasn't full of the pork-based masterpiece flavor found in the east parts of world and United States (NYC). The noodles also did not have the same flare. I didn't finish the meal yelling \"Kaedama\"!"], ["Lexie D.", "My boyfriend and I were here visiting and we had a craving for sushi, as we usually do. We stayed at the Renaissance Hotel (which I do recommend) and the clerk at the front desk suggested we go there.Overall, we weren't impressed. My biggest complaint was the service. I HATE being rushed to read a menu and make a decision and within 8 minutes of sitting down the waitress stood over me to make a decision. I hadn't even looked at the sushi menu. My boyfriend ordered his usual and was not impressed with the Spider roll. I ordered the chicken teriyaki and again, not impressed. It was very small portion and the chicken was dry despite being soaked in sauce. We did order the Miso soup though and that was very good.Next time we are in town, we will definitely try something else. Overall, it was expensive for what we ordered."], ["Erin D.", "I and another person were the only ones eating in the restaurant on a weeknight. As I reviewed the menu, two waitresses hovered a couple of feet from me. I found this to be a bit annoying. I ordered the miso soup (tasted as it should), unagi sushi, crunchy sushi, and spicy tuna. The size of the sushi pieces has been one of the biggest I've eaten. The spicy tuna was the spiciest I've eaten, and it was so spicy I had a hard time finishing the sushi. My meal cost about $20.For the price, the restaurant was ok, but ambience could be improved. There's nothing that screams, \"You have to come back again!\" and so I give an average rating. If you're downtown in Nashville and want sushi within a walkable distance off of the Broadway strip, this will suffice. But don't expect anything glamorous!"], ["Steve W.", "I've spent the last 3 weeks trying to convince my wife to get sushi with me. I don't like it that much, but I've been craving it like pregnant women crave ice cream and pickles. Finally, at the end of our long weekend road trip, she caved. Unfortunately she waited until we were in Nashville vs a coastal city, but I wasn't complaining. I opened yelp and as it was freezing cold and we were walking from the country music hall of fame, I picked the highest rated place that was less than 1/2 mile away. They offered a decent lunch special which allowed you to get 2 or 3 rolls, but the selection was limited. It came with soup and salad. My wife got the veggie roll and spicy tuna. I went with the salmon and yellowtail. All the rolls were made fresh and quickly as you would hope for at lunch. The downside of this place was the service. It wasn't bad, but it was borderline abrasive. I know they were probably trying to help the work lunch crowd that was in a hurry on a Tuesday, but we had been seated less than 5 minutes and the waitress asked 3x if we had decided.

The gentlemen behind the sushi bar are friendly as well, and if you're well-versed on Asian culture or the ins-and-outs of the Nashville bar scene, you can have a pleasant conversation with them on slow nights.All in all, it's the best Japanese you will find for now in Nashville. It's Downtown, so you will have to pay for parking. It's on Second Avenue, so it is a little expensive. And it's geared toward a Western palate, so some of the soups hold back on the dashi broth and miso.

They have a huge menu for everyone that loves sushi and for those that want something from the kitchen. If you like less common sushi like uni, they almost always have it in stock.I highly recommend their crunchy shrimp roll, salmon skin handroll, shimeiji butter mushrooms, chirashi, and anything that involves salmon or toro. Their tempura udon is worth a try in the colder months or if you want something not sushi. The Dixieland roll is great if you don't care about your heart and want to really splurge on fried roll goodness. Be sure to try their fried ice cream, mochi, or green tea cheesecake if they have it in!If you're on a budget, be careful with what you order.

I had a colonoscopy today and when I got out I was HUNGRY. I had seen that this place and a sushi buffet. I went with a mission to do some damage. My review is based on the lunch buffet on a Monday at 12:45pm. The lunch buffet is from 11am-2pm (Monday thru Friday) and is $11.50. The lunch buffet consists of \"appetizers, fresh sushi Nigiri, sushi rolls, hibachi grill, specialty entrees and desserts\". So, working from the beginning of the buffet, you have the hot entree items. They had spring rolls, sugar donuts, chow mien noodles, some kind of spicy chicken that tasted more Mexican than asian but was good, fried rice that was a little dry, beans, a teriyaki chicken and mushroom dish that was good, and some tempura veggies. They didn't have labels for the names of the dishes, but they seemed pretty self explanatory, well all but the Mexican looking chicken. Moving down to the Nigiri, they had red snapper, salmon, and shrimp. Next to the Nigiri was the sushi rolls. They were as follows, crunchy crab, crab cream cheese egg roll, tempura roll, chicken tempura roll, spicy salmon roll, California roll, spicy crab, and then special roll 1, 2, and 3. I kind of wished they had write in names for the special rolls, but I still ate them.Next to the sushi is the lettuce bowl, you're able to make a little salad with ginger dressing. They've also got bowls with mushrooms & chives & you're able to have a little bowl of soup. At the end of the buffet is the hibachi grill. The grill is a little confusing if it's your first time. There isn't any toppings or meats to pick out on the plate like some places. The man working the grill wasn't too friendly at all. I walked up to the grill & he said \"what do you need?\" very sternly. I asked what the meat they had & he said \"shrimp or steak\". I picked steak & he didn't acknowledge that I'd said steak so I stood there for about 30 seconds then walked back to my table. About 5 minutes later he started to bang a bell, the kind they use at a hotel front desk. I walked up & got my plate. It was all very odd. The desserts. I didn't see any desserts at all, unless you're classifying the sugar donuts as dessert. Overall, I really liked the experience. The servers were very sweet & attentive. The hot food was pretty good for buffet food, asides from the dry-ish fried rice. I liked the sushi they had. It wasn't the best ever but was good for a buffet. I've been to Sushi Train a few times & I think this place has better sushi, mainly because it tastes a little fresher & more variety. Sushi Train is about 3 bucks less though. The steak & shrimp hibachi was good, not great. I wished I'd gotten a little dessert. FYI - Around 1:30pm the sushi options begin to clear out."], ["Columbia J.", "The whole experience was average. Nothing really stood out. The price was fair and the sushi menu was decent."], ["David L.", "So I wanted to try all the sushi places in Nashville because I'm obsessed with it. And this was my 3rd sushi restaurant and it is my favorite so far. I had pretty bad Asian food here in Nashville so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The staff was very welcoming and it wasn't too busy at lunch time on a Saturday. I ordered the No. 9 and a Sakura roll. I took one bite of the No. 9 and I was in heaven. The salmon was fresh and the tempura inside was seasoned to my taste. I was just so surprised that the fish was so fresh. Then I had the Sakura roll which had crab and strawberries. It was interesting but I wasn't really a big fan of it. Maybe if the strawberries were sweeter cause they were too sour for me. But I had an overall great experience at this restaurant. Omg I love how everywhere in Nashville they split the checks it makes going with friends so much easier.

I've been happy with the sushi and sashimi fishes I've had. The rolls are also done well, with a wide variety options.Their non-sushi options are very good. My wife loves the udon soups.

That being said, my fiance and I started with the gyoza and squid tempura which were perfectly cooked and delicious! As for the sushi it was very flavorful and fresh, but unlike their across the street competition, not overpriced. Moreover, they have a huge variety of combos which for me is almost unheard of to find, and the only other place with that amount of variety is Arigatos (Surprise). Also, the interior was far nicer than that of Samurai and did not feel as crowded.This is definitely a place I will take my sushi fiend friends when they come visit later this year from out of town.

I'm a recent sushi convert and Osake has been my starting place. They have great service, a nice ambience (much less crowded than the other sushi restaurant on Elliston) and a menu with good variety. I love their gyoza, edamame, Dragon roll as well as anything with eel. Their miso could be better and I don't love that they only serve you soft drinks out of cans (and you only get 2). They have great teriyaki and soba too! I've never had bad service and they're rarely crowded when I come in so you get one on one attention from the server & chef. Love it!"], ["Steven S.", "Great sushi, great prices. \u00a0The server will help you to get the best deal based on what you're ordering. \u00a0The sushi is always fresh and extremely tasty. \u00a0We drive up from Murfreesboro whenever we can to enjoy a nice fresh roll. \u00a0The staff is very friendly. \u00a0Parking is fine. \u00a0Usually not crowded and that's a shame. \u00a0This place is better than what I've heard about the place across the street."], ["Harold D.", "Omg since the main sushi chef left I've had 2 bad experiences here! And tonight was my last straw! The miso soup was Horrible to the 10th power! I can't wait till the old chef opens his new bar downtown!"], ["Jessica T.", "Like most people on a budget, I love deals, especially easily attainable ones. So when I had a deal on my Scout Mob app for 50% off of O'Sake, of course I walked over and wanted to take part in some sushi!Looking at the menu, I decided on the two for $9.99. I read the menu thoroughly to see if any where it noted it wouldn't be included in a discounted price, but I couldn't find it (I could be wrong). The server asked if I wanted soup or salad, and I told her to surprise me and she brought me out both! I was happy with that (she didn't charge me extra either). I ordered a crunchy crab and california roll; i figured something a little different and something basic. I was not pleased at all with the california roll. I wish i could note why, but I'm not quite sure what it was. The crunchy crab roll was SO DELICIOUS!! I want to go back and order it again and try the crunchy shrimp.When it came time to get my check, I showed her my Scout Mob and of course, the deal didn't work towards it. I was kinda bummed I didn't know prior, since I wasn't happy with half my order, but the service was really good from the server, and the crunchy crab was so yummy, that I really didn't care.Can't wait to try that crunchy shrimp!!"], ["Mark H.", "Miso was OK. Nowhere near incredible. The sushi was okay, the fish was obviously previously frozen. The rolls were decent I give it 2 stars but give it a shot, it's sushi in Nashville..lol"], ["Mia C.", "This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Nashville! \u00a0I went to Vanderbilt and lived a block away so I came here pretty often. \u00a0It is definitely a hole in the wall and I believe they only have about 3 people working and cooking there so if you're looking for a fast meal, do not come here. \u00a0Because of the lack of staff, the service is actually pretty terrible in the sense that it takes a long time to get your food or anything for that matter. \u00a0However, they are VERY nice and the food is excellent. \u00a0I usually get the Bay Salmon roll or the Playboy roll. \u00a0And this older Japanese man makes all of the sushi by hand. \u00a0He is a very nice man and you can tell he takes pride in his work. \u00a0It is worth the wait! \u00a0They also have good soup, salad, and teriyaki so pretty much whatever you order is going to be good. \u00a0I usually picked it up to go and ate it at home. \u00a0Now, every time I go to Nashville I have to stop here for lunch or dinner before I leave. \u00a0I highly recommend it to everyone."], ["H S.", "Some of the worst sushi I've had in Nashville, including the refrigerated grocery store variety. Really, it was that bad. I went during lunch and maybe this just isn't the time to go, but the rice seemed stale and was not seasoned properly. Most of the \"special\" rolls seemed to rely a bit too much on fried ingredients and overpowering sauces. A friend ordered a special spicy soft-shell crab roll that was actually covered in lumps of fried tempura batter and shredded surimi (AKA fake crab). It was by far one of the nastiest looking rolls I've encountered and may have been responsible for my friend's post-lunch stomachache.The name O'Sake should have been a tip off not to go, you're not going to find amazing and authentic sushi at a place that thinks sushi and sake make a good pair, but I'm the kind of sometime sushi snob that can appreciate overwrought nouveau-sushi when it tastes good. This did not taste good."], ["Patrick G.", "I absolutely love this place! I discovered it soon after I returned to Nashville from an extended stay in Japan. It originally attracted me because it bills itself as an izakaya (a sort of melding of a bar and a restaurant). Inside it reminded me of many of the joints I'd hung out at in Matsuyama, Japan. Since then I've been many times.The sashimi is usually very good and the rolls are excellent. I'd recommend the Cherry Blossom roll most definitely. The Caterpillar roll is also a great one to check out. Wash all of that down with one of their sakes or (my favorite) one of their large bottles of Orion beer. The atmosphere of the place is very intimate. The chef, Jae, will often chat you up, and the waitress is very sweet.I guess I have to put at least one complaint in here... I guess it would be that I wish they seasoned their rice a bit better. Then again, I've been to very few places in America that season their rice well, so c'est la vie."], ["Matt D.", "Good stuff .. Where did this place come from? \u00a0Great service, green tea was exceptional, miso soup was good, yellowtail & scallion was good .. I'll be back. \u00a0If they could just turn down the annoying Japanese pop music .."], ["Valerie W.", "Delicious Sushi!!! I loved it and will DEFINATELY be back soon:)"], ["Elliott C.", "This was some of the best sushi I am sure you can have in Nashville. I used to be in love with Sams however tonight we stopped by O'Sake and was Jay ever nice, and the sushi was amazing. The decor is perfect and you almost felt like you were eating sushi in japan. Must go and definitely try the Arigato Rolls amazing!"], ["Karyn J.", "What a great spot! My girlfriend & I went to enjoy a late lunch & this was the first time either of us had been here. The place is clean & we were immediately greeted when we walked in. Our waitress was very nice & our order arrived quickly. They gave us so much food for such a great price! The food was hot & fresh & I enjoyed every bite! I look forward to going back."], ["Peter C.", "Decent place, a bit quiet for the lunch crowd. \u00a0Nabe noodle soup generous in portion, though the broth a bit light. \u00a0Both rainbow/dragon rolls were delicious. \u00a0Will grow on me, I am sure."]]}
