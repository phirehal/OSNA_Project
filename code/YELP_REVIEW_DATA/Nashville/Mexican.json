{"El Jaliciense Mexican Restaurant": [["Krystal T.", "A hidden Nashville gem. Seriously, this place may not look like much from the outside, but this is probably as authentic Mexican as you can get in this portion of Nashville. As small as their parking lot is, it is overflowing every night with die-hard fans who are willing to wait in line to pick up their take-out orders or wait for a table. The chile relleno is the best I've had in Nashville, and the spice level is more what I'm used to back home in the Southwest. One small downside: El Jaliciense does not have a liquor license, so sadly no margaritas :("], ["Johnny T.", "I should have left it at one visit. I should have gotten in and gotten out, enjoyed my food and kept it moving. I shouldn't have allowed myself to hope for a Mexican restaurant to put in my rotation. I was let down. My times at EJ started strong but it's all in how you finish.Let me begin by saying that I've never eaten here. All my EJ experiences have been to-go. As a to-go restaurant, things make sense. You walk to the to-go counter, open the menu, order, wait, pay, leave. It's pretty basic. At least, it was on my initial visits. I liked the fact that the restaurant didn't try too hard (famous last words). The TV was blaring. Children were running around. Organized chaos was all about. Expected. I ordered a chicken burrito and a strawberry paleta and kept it moving. I was happy with the price, taste and amount of food I received. Much like the praise found elsewhere on this page, I was a fan.And, then I came back.Just like previous times, I parked in the parking lot (deep enough to enable you to back out and not wind up on Gallatin; this is a good thing), walked in, stepped to the 'order here' area, ordered, waited, watched rambunctious children, ignored the blaring TV... and waited... and waited. Wait. Isn't this where I pay and leave? What's going on? As I sat and waited, I noticed three other parties pay and leave, two of which ordered after I did. I asked if everything was alright. I was told it was. The woman behind the register left. She was replaced by an older woman. I waited some more. A bag of food came out from the kitchen. I asked if it was mine. I was told it was not. Two other parties came in, ordered, waited, received food and left. By this time, I am over it. I am not waiting for my food. I am waiting to see how long this will take. The older woman leaves from behind the register. She is replaced by the previous woman. Again, I ask about my food. She leaves (to go to the kitchen?), comes back and tells me that the now cold bag of food that had been sitting by the register is mine.Incorrect.It's yours because I'm not paying for cold food, questionable service and ignored questions. It's too bad. We could have had it aaallllll. Ea-ting bur-it-too-oh-oos... Never again.

It's very simple but perfectly executed with lots of lime juice and just enough salt, tomato, raw onion, and cilantro.I ordered a Coke and was pleased to receive a half liter bottle of Mexican Coke. Their michelada is refreshing, served over ice in a glass stein, mostly beer with a splash of their tomato/lime/spice mixture.For food, I look no further than the tacos, which were authentically presented on two small corn tortillas and topped with cilantro, onion, and lime. The asada, chorizo, and birria (envision Mexican pot roast) are my favorite meats. The chorizo is some of the best I've ever had. The birria is incredibly tender and packed with unexpected flavors - I detected hints of star anise and clove. Also available were chicken, pastor, and for the more adventurous, tripa and lengua. Be aware that the pastor is a little on the dry/crispy side, but that's intentional and traditional. At $1.50 per taco, this place is hard to beat.They get a 4 instead of a 5 because of inconsistency and slow service. Their tacos are a little inconsistent, ranging from pretty good to the best I've ever had. When they take the time to get their chorizo a little crust on their chorizo and toast their tortillas on the plancha, they can't be beat. But sometimes they skip these details. Service is usually a little slow, and I've come to expect this. Even so, I'm rarely in there for longer than 30 minutes.

It's an alright option when on Broadway, but I would not go out of my way to return."], ["Matt D.", "Great feel and atmosphere for lunch. \u00a0The waitress and Manager were very personable and attentive. \u00a0Had the chips and guacamole which were delicious. \u00a0The chicken chorizo tostada had a great little spice and overall great flavor. \u00a0The Cochinita Pibil was also fresh and full of flavor, not the mention that they make their own tacos in house. \u00a0Returned with my friend on the weekend for dinner and unfortunately they didn't have the valet up and running (no pun intended). \u00a0Also, it was much louder around dinner than when I was dining for lunch. \u00a0We ordered both the queso and the guacamole which was a great choice. \u00a0The queso was gloriously thick and flavorful. \u00a0Next time, I would add chorizo to add some depth to the flavor. \u00a0I ordered the Pollo Rojo, Cochinita Pibil, and Bistec tacos and all three were full of flavor. \u00a0While the tortillas are on the smaller side, they certainly load them up for you."], ["Katie I.", "Second time here and another good experience. Love the vibe here and the sliding doors opened and fans give the feeling of being outside, but with a nice breeze. House margarita is delicious and not bad at $8. El jimador blanco, triple sec, agave nectar, fresh lemon/lime. The sangria looks equally delicious and I plan on trying that next time. Great guacamole and I love their red salsa. Has a nice smoky flavor. Didn't care for the green salsa. They have a limited menu of mainly tacos and a few Tortas and Tostadas. I really liked the chicken chorizo tostado. Fish tacos and short rib are also solid. Added bonus, their complimentary valet is shared with etch, so no paying exorbitant parking prices. Thumbs up here."], ["Michelle C.", "Bakersfield was conveniently located right near our hotel for my bachelorette party weekend in Nashville. On Saturday afternoon, we had nine hungry girls and no reservations, which made Bakersfield the perfect option since they take walk-ins only. We didn't have to wait long for a table large enough to fit our group to open up, but we did have to wait until our whole party was there to even put our name in for a table. In the meantime, the hostess kept pushing these standing-only tables on us, but we held out because we weren't interested in standing while eating a full meal. \u00a0Once our name was in, we migrated to the nearby bar to get drinks. The hostess was on us every ten seconds to move out of the way, which we gladly did, once we received our drinks. It was a little weird and made ordering kind of awkward since we knew this woman just wanted us to get out of the way. But how else would we have ordered drinks? Seated at the table, things ran much smoother. Our server was awesome and made some great recommendations. The queso and guac were both delicious and came out seconds after we ordered them. The tacos were also great and I found two to be more than enough after the chip bonanza. Also, the margaritas were on point. Prices are very reasonable, and our server was willing to split our checks without a second thought. I'd definitely hit this place up again though I'd be wary of where I stood to order a cocktail."], ["Casey H.", "After the Indie Ville TV Awards, we were hungry and wanted to try a new place. We came across Bakersfield Nashville and gave it a shot. Parking is pretty ridiculous in that area because of the construction that's currently going on. There was mention of valet but it was nowhere to be found. We found a lot about 2 blocks away and paid $9 for 2 hours (min). The place was pretty empty at 630PM on a Sunday so we were seated quickly. We ordered chip/salsa, 3 tacos (short rib, fish and pastor) and a Milanesa torta. Chips were fresh and the green salsa was good - it was green and reminded me of a tomatillo sauce. The tacos were really good... nice balance. I didn't care for the Milanesa torta; it's not bad. I just don't like battered stuff. I would have given the place a 5 star if parking was more convenient."], ["Tracy B.", "This place was just as good as the other reviewers had led me to believe. It was a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I listened. The inside was beautiful-- it was like a rustic but yet modern feel. And had a very \"cool\" vibe. We started with margaritas which I loved. Half of our group got the spicy margs which I'm not a fan of but they loved them. I liked how they were easy to drink but not too sweet.And the food was so good. We got guacamole, queso, and queso with chorizo. All three were super tasty. I \u00a0picky about queso because I don't like when it congeals because restaurants try to be too fancy, but this was perfect.We all split two salads and then had two tacos each.The salads were great-- I can't even remember what they were because that wasn't the highlight of the meal...And then we all got different types of tacos and by that point, I was barely hungry anymore, but they were really good. I got the pollo rojo and the short rib and even though I didn't really taste the cheese in either one because of the other flavors, they were both great.I'd definitely go back."], ["Brian B.", "Flavourful tacos, but all were a little dry. \u00a0I enjoyed the taste of the pastor tacos, but again wish they had been a little more moist.The waitress told us the guac was really good when we sat down, which I thought may have just been a way to sell it, but it actually was pretty fantastic--and deceptively large."], ["T C.", "Probably the cheapest grub your going to find in the area that tastes great! Few notes to keep in mind... 1. Service is fabulous!  \u00a02. Make a reservation, waiting area has little seating however bar is right there which is handy....  3. Music is very loud so if you want a nice pleasant conversation this is not the place...lol. \u00a0 Who needs to talk when your eating anyway....4. Short rib sandwich, short rib tacos.... OMG. Need I say more... 5. Local brews... Yowza. That's all!  6. If you are looking for more than tacos and chips/salsa you will not be impressed however the choices that are on the menu are all great... Suck it up and get a taco.... Queso is yum too.  Did I mention service was great and food was very inexpensive."], ["Sheena T.", "Man, I was really impressed with Bakersfield!! I came here for dinner and drinks with friends and really enjoyed it! We started out with chips and salsa and queso. I didn't love the queso....I feel that queso indicates liquid form cheese. This was more melted cheese. It was ok, but not quite what I was expecting. The taste was fine, but nothing special. I wouldn't order it again. The salsa was good, pitcher of margaritas was excellent and quite large too! Our whole table ordered tacos and they were really good. All of us had our favorites, but overall they were really tasty. The server told us the different heat levels on each of the tacos, and my favorite was the spiciest one. I believe it was the Cochinta Pibil. Mmm. So good. Service was great, food was solid, and my only other complaint was the noise level was super high. But that is pretty hard for them to control. Overall I will definitely be back for more delicious food and margaritas from Bakersfield!"], ["Liz B.", "What a wonderful time we had at Bakerfield. We had a party of 11 on a Sunday afternoon, the staff accommodated and were \u00a0great. To start the Margarita's have fresh squeezed lime juice and are terrific.

He is a huge fan of mexican food so when I told him about this place he was very excited! The chips and and salsa were AMAZING!!! The beef for my fajitas were the best I've ever had!

They also have a daily deal special every day!"], ["Jason M.", "What a good tex-mex place. First the portions are large so come hungry. We were able to sample all there sauces and they were all good. I gave them 4 stars because for a chain they are above average, the waiters were excellent and they make there own tortillas. So big plus there. I had the Elvis memorial combo on the first eating and it was huge and very flavorful. The chicken is real chicken, the ground sirloin is real sirloin and the corn tortillas, the blue corn tortillas and the flour tortillas where perfection, cooked to just enough charring to where they weren't doughy but weren't dried out either. The sauces were fresh tasting with a great balance of heat. Ask to try the creamy jalape\u00f1o ranch and dip your chips in it. Delicious!!! Price is $9 and up."], ["Elliott W.", "Chuy's still is my favorite teximexichain. The Opry Mills location has delivered on the promise to keep me happy twice with perfectly tender and delicious steak fajitas. And the added bonus is showing up during happy hour for free queso and pulled pork on the thunderbird bar, which we made copious use of. By the time dinner came out, we'd already had a full meal of pork nachos!Chuy's at Opry Mills servers their salsa a little chunkier than other locations that I've visited. I don't know which way is the Chuy's standard, but I'm not complaining. Its great both ways.Always a value. Always satisfied."], ["Joe K.", "This place is great, my girlfriend and I get there about twice a month and split the fajitas for 1!, yes I said 1!

They had a free nacho bar, they offer several salsa's to compliment the free chips they give you when you walk in. The food was not only hot and fresh, but also delicious. I had a combo meal and would have probably cleaned my entire plate if we didn't run out of time. I usually prefer not to eat at chain restaurants when I travel, but we don't have these back home. If we did, i'd be a regular."], ["Millah J.", "The wait was very long...they could be better organized. We finally found a table in the bar area and the service (Shea) was excellent! Shea was attentive and friendly. We were celebrating my birthday and they surprised me with sopapillas - which were delicious!!

I tried the Comida Deluxe Combo (#1) for the first time - my usual is chicken flautas or the chuychanga - and I'm glad I did! I just wish my stomach had more room to fit it all!!

Service was great, making sure they always kept my glass and chips full. They sell funny T-Shirts as well."], ["Armand K.", "Far exceeded expectations.Was staying at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel and after dining at Cascades, supposedly their best restaurant onsite, knew we had to venture out for dinner. Chuy's was not only recommended by some of the Opryland staffers, but also was the top rated place within walking distance on Yelp. 3.5 stars didn't sound terrible, but going to Tex_mex in Tennessee seemed a little odd. Nonetheless we checked out Opry Hills Mall and two-stepped our way into Chuy's.4PM-7PM every weekday is their Happy Hour. Beyond a few drink specials, including their signature Margarita's and the Texas Martini (a Margarita served in a shaker bottle with a Martini glass garnished with jalape\u00f1o stuffed olives and a wedge of lime), the happy hour also includes unlimited house made tortilla chips, queso (nacho cheese sauce), seasoned beef, and their new creamy jalape\u00f1o sauce. After ordering drinks and loading up our nachos, we we're already pretty satisfied, and opted to share the waiter-recommended chicken fajitas. Served on a hot skillet with all the toppings you'd imagine (including guac) they were incredible. Not only was the chicken perfectly cooked, but the home made tortillas make a huge difference in overall taste.The ambiance is a step up from other casual restaurants in the same price range. Unlike an Applebees, Chili's, etc, most of the art inside Chuy's is handmade like the food. We skipped on dessert, but overall had an incredible experience. I know a big part of our satisfaction, was due to the gentleman who was serving us. When we ran out of fajita tortillas he even brought us a few extra for the last few pieces of chicken we had. I'm looking forward to my trip to Austin so I can visit the original.Pro-tips:-Go during 4PM-7PM Weekday Happy Hour-Try the Texas Martini-Portions are large"], ["Jason K.", "Pretty much what you'd expect from a Mexican chain restaurant at a mall. The guac was pretty plain and uninspired...but they fry their tortilla chips fresh...they arrived impossibly thin, hot and crisp. Enchiladas were pretty mediocre as were the sides.

Yelp led me to Chuy's and once I saw green chile dishes on the menu, I was in.This is the first place I've seen outside New Mexico with green chile anything, and they had Hatch chile, too. Reasonable prices + big portions = strong value. My son had soft tacos, which were a bit spicy for him (fine to me), and I had the \"Southwestern\" which is \"a New Mexican tradition. Homemade blue corn tortillas stacked with freshly-roasted, hand-pulled chicken, cheese & Green Chile sauce, topped with a fried egg\"; I really enjoyed it.The ceiling of the room we were in was covered in wheel covers/hubcaps; the rest of the place was similarly adorned.

So five words. \u00a0Let's start with cheap. The most expensive thing you can order is $6.99 (the steak salad). A basket of 3 6\" tacos will set you back $6.29 for the chicken. Fast is next, when you walk up and the line is hanging out the door and every table is full you think, \"this will take forever!\" Nope they move that line right along. Tasty kind of speaks for itself. \u00a0You pick the toppings so if it's no good you have nobody to blame but you. Seriously the meats are all very good. Fresh, all of the toppings are really good looking. No beige lettuce or wilted tomatoes. Lastly they are really great to the customers considering how busy they stay.They have a great patio for outdoor seating but they don't have a full bar. Only beer. A plus for me is that they even filter the water. So many places around town it tastes like they pump the water right out of the Cumberland or a chemical plant.If you are looking for a great little place for a burrito and like me want to keep your business local (I'm looking at you Chipotle) give Baja a try."], ["Barbara S.", "Love the burritos...

The brisket was very tender, juicy, and just melted in my mouth with each bite. Of course eating a torta can become a bit messy, but every bite was bursting with flavors! I even scooped up the drippings because I enjoyed it that much! The pineapple salsa was sweet and goes well with their hot salsa from the salsa bar.

In all honesty, without the above and beyond service, this place is more like 3 stars. The food is pretty health conscience, creative, and affordable. The execution and taste is a little above average. The decor is fun and \"hip\" and it's a nice environment for a relaxed dinner with friends or a casual date. It can be hard to get a table here during dinner hour sometimes and other times you can walk right in but that's most decent places in Nashville.

While I have no opposition to any of those things, it is my hope that heaven will also contain a fantastic patio, margaritas, and tacos. Just in case it does not, I plan on taking full living advantage of the fact that Taco Mamacita offers all three (no death required!). Taco Mamacita is one of my favorite hang-out places once the weather hits tolerable outdoor dining temperatures. Their patio is lovely and shaded, so even when the sun hits its most delightfully brutal Southern stride, I can eat outside without fear of an \"Irish tan.\" Though their drinks are a little light on the alcohol, the atmosphere more than makes up for potentially not being drunk. Now on to the food. I have never had a bad food experience at Taco Mamacita. Let's start with the basics: tacos. But a taco can be so much more than basic, and the Mamacita does everything possible to ensure that you are aware of just how non-basic tacos can be. Go for their $8.95 deal and get two tacos from their diverse selection, plus a side. Highly recommended are the Korean pork tacos and the royal taco grande. Haven't found that the Caribbean jerk tacos were my favorites, but that may just be a matter of taste. If you are not in the mood for tacos, or on some terrible low-carb diet, the next stop on the menu is the Peruvian chicken, which is possibly the most moist, tender chicken I have ever encountered. If you can tear your eyes away from the taco menu, this is also a highly recommended choice.Moral of the story: If you are looking for harps, clouds, and other angelic totems, Taco Mamacita is probably not going to work for you.

However, Taco Mamacita excels at both! They've restored my belief that a great margarita and great tacos can make a great meal!Taco menu is extensive. I went for the baja fish taco and the california club taco. I preferred the california club taco more only because it had more flavor than the fish. Maybe it was because they use tilapia instead of tuna. It was still tasty but the california club stood out more with it's fresh flavor combinations. And while I didn't have it, everyone at the table raved about the Mexican street corn. You have to get on the cob. Margaritas were strong and tasty.

Thankfully he didn't have a reaction, but he could have gotten really sick. He found a couple jalapenos on under the guacamole which is how we knew they just picked them off. Major points lost for that. I got 2 tacos, the SLOPPY JOSE TACO no jalapenos (no mistake made here) and the TACO ROYALE, they were both pretty good with the plantains on the side, they were pretty meh, but I was trying something new. I liked the Sloppy Jose better. I can't recall what my sister got, I think it was the CARNITAS. She really was not impressed and the shaved elote on the side, she really didn't like that at all, it didn't taste like an actual street vended elote that she was hoping for.

You seat yourself and your food is brought to you. I was back and forth between the special of the day which was a play on chicken flautas or the brisket enchilada- I ended up going with the enchilada. My husband did as well except he had the chicken one with the side combo of rice and beans.Start with the queso- it is DELICIOUS! It was spicy too and so so so good. Their chips are the best chips I have had since Don Pablo's closed (back in Buffalo). I was worried that everything was going to come out at the same time but when you ask for it as a starter, they got you covered.The food was tasty. I often stay away from chicken as it tends to be too dry but my husbands enchilada was delicious and not dry at all (I would say it was moist but I hate that word). The side of rice and beans was big enough for us to share as well and it tasted homemade. Often times I find myself at Mexican restaurants going, oh wow, they mixed a bag of frozen veggies into this rice. Taqueria's rice did not leave me with that impression. Do yourself a favor and scoop up the re-fried beans with some tortilla chips. I don't care what my husband says, this is neither weird nor disgusting. This was an excellent choice for lunch and they have an adorable patio outside to enjoy your meal as well. There is a fully functional bar, so if you need to pound a few back on your lunch break, they can accommodate you. The food is top notch and the price can't be beat. For queso & chips, two enchiladas, a rice & bean combo and two drinks we paid $16 for lunch.

I love their cheese enchiladas and beef brisket enchiladas, and I prefer both with their rich beef red chili sauce. These are a safe bet to cure any Texan's homesickness. The tacos are fine too, but the enchiladas are next level.Their salsa trio is pretty darn good, but I usually go for their guacamole and/or \"cheese dip\" (queso blanco with chiles) to start, both of which are some of the best in Nashville.To drink, it's hard to resist the skinny margarita, which is actually just a REAL margarita (i.e. lime juice instead of a sweet/sour mix). On the rocks with salt, please. Choose from dozens of tequilas.The staff are always hustling to provide great customer service, and this is a symptom of a very present, hands-on manager. I wish this was the case at more restaurants. As we know, when the cat's away, the mice will play. But that's not a problem here. They seem to run a pretty tight ship.Finally, I'll address the prices. At first, I thought the prices were a bit high, but I realized that this is a counter-service restaurant.

Whoever makes that rice was sent from heaven because it reminds me of my moms fried rice! SO UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS. Most Mexican or Tex Mex restaurants have dull rice that lacks all kinds of things, even color! Not these guys! The chicken tacos are my favorite.

Queso and guac with hot crispy tortillas. We gathered our drinks from the cashier: reposado margaritas and Sprites for our boyz. Setting a baseline: \u00a0We are very picky.

No weakness or self consciousness and no indulgent \u00a0slacker behavior from the staff. Intense focus on managing a steady and heavy flow of patrons. This place is efficient, professional, and confident about turning out excellent, fresh and tasty food.

The shrimp grits arrived looking forbidding and boring all at once. \u00a0My lip curled. The sauce was such a dark, deep red, I braced myself for over cooked acidic red sauce; the neat white mound of grits in the middle looked pale and forlorn. I sighed and tucked in. \u00a0Oh. My. Sweet stewed tomato-ey goodness. I scooped up some pale grits. Ooo. Buttery. Mmm. Now all together. Shrimp, tomato sauce, buttery grits. More. My bias melted away. This was delicious.

It was wonderful. the churizzo was very spicy. the pork was very tender and the carney asada was not overdone. My friend also ordered the fiesta chicken and said it was awesome. I did not taste his food but the presentation was pretty with very festive use of red and green peppers. Our waiter did his job well by giving me at least 5 drink refills plus refills on the chips and salsa. the only negative was the food took 14 minutes to get to the table after we ordered it but i was understanding because they were just opening. Believe me when i say this is a place that i want to go back to with other friends and say \"LOOK WHAT I FOUND\""], ["Brian N.", "I've been coming to Tequila's now for a year or so, maybe longer. I live very close so I was excited to see a Mexican place that close to home when they opened.I can give a pretty fair review now that I have tried many items on the menu. \u00a0Fajitas - they're always good, with good quality meat, tender, juicy and flavorful. My favorite version is the Parillada Mexicana which comes with chorizo, chicken, steak, and shrimp and a carnita, along with the normal grilled veggies. \u00a0I will say that sometimes the carnita that comes with this is a bit dry and tough and sometimes the shrimp are overcooked, but overall this is still my favorite fajita dish. (When I say sometimes, I would say out of 7 orders it may have happened twice)The normal carnitas however are always top notch. I think the difference may be that the carnita on the fajita plate gets a bit of extra cooking time being in with the fajita mix and on that hot griddle plate)They also have a spinach burrito dish that is excellent if you're vegetarian. It's creamy and rich with cheese. It comes with two and is great with a guacamole salad. (lettuce, tomato, guac)I also enjoy the fish tacos, they are not fried but grilled and have a nice kick to them. If you want it HOT like I do, you can ask them to cook the fish in the diablo sauce which to me, is still not \"set you on fire\" hot, but others would disagree. I have a pretty high threshold for what most would consider hot.For a different type of lunch I ordered the Huevos Con Chorizo (Eggs with Mexican sausage) which comes with rice and beans, and found it to be great! \u00a0Light because of the eggs, but extremely tasty due to the chorizo being scrambled with the eggs.Their guacamole and salsas are always very fresh as well as the chips.Tequila's does a great job of offering the standard Mexican fare those in the US are accustomed to, but also has some items that lean more towards authentic Mexican. The one thing that is missing from the menu (and usually is on most Mexican joints) is a good Mole. \u00a0If they could add a good Mole chicken dish, I would be in heaven. \u00a0As I've said in previous reviews I'm a bit stingy with stars so very few joints get 5 from me, but Tequilas has always been a solid 4.They have a great and friendly staff, the food is never disappointing, and their prices are very reasonable. You can eat for under $10 easily, or you can get a large meal for between $10.00 and $16.00.If you live in, or are close to West Nashville, it's by far the best Mexican place you can find. And if you're looking for entertainment on the weekends, they do music and karaoke. (or at least they have been)They have a patio you can enjoy and a large back room for larger/private parties."], ["Megan C.", "Yum! \u00a0The bf and I came here for dinner on halloween weekend and enjoyed delicious Mexican food. \u00a0I loved the quesidillas I ordered and the chips and salsa were solid. \u00a0The employees were decked out for the holiday and one of them tried (somewhat unsuccessfully) to scare me, which was pretty fun. \u00a0Great service, reasonably priced, and I've heard they make a damn good margarita, though I haven't tested that out myself just yet."], ["Richard C.", "I grew up near Dallas, TX and ate Tex-Mex all the time...this is THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD I've found in Nashville so far.

While she was setting up the table, another couple walked in, and the girl at the cash register asked how many and she sat them immediately while we stood there right in front of her.

This place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Nashville. I think we've tried one of almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed. I always end up going back to the Fajitas Hawaiiana (chicken, beef, shrimp, ham and pineapple) without fail because its that good. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the food arrives fairly quickly. Another big plus is their margaritas are awesome. Thursdays and Sundays pitchers are $13.99. Great food, great drinks, great service and the price is right. If you haven't tried Tequila's yet you really should!"], ["Christy L.", "Food was great, drink was even better.

We got a pitcher of house margaritas on the rocks for $15. Although I loathe Cuervo- sometimes you have to slum it. They were completely drinkable and I dare say I sucked down more than my share.Tequila's has a pleasant atmosphere, it's not expensive, and it's the perfect place to stuff your face full of chips and guacamole, get half drunk, and slump over in a booth shoveling a huge plate of comfort food into your starving mouth."], ["Sara E.", "This place has amazing salsa!

Of course, there's plenty of TexMex and Americanized Mexican food available in Nashville too, and I happen to think that's a good thing. Sometimes you just want to eat something that's slathered in cheese sauce, am I right? U.S. Border Cantina used to be our go-to spot for Mexican food when I was craving queso and margaritas, but now that it's gone to the restaurant graveyard in the sky, Tequila's is our new haunt when we're in the mood for Meximerican (a term of my own creation) food. I think most of these \"Mexican\" restaurants are pretty interchangeable, but Tequila's food is legitimately very tasty (the fajita burrito is enough for two, though it's so yummy you won't want to share) and has lightning fast service. Additionally, while it doesn't serve the best margaritas I've ever had, it does offer up decent incarnations of them, and for a reasonable price, too. For $6.50, you can get a top-shelf marg that will seriously rev your engine. Better yet, they have plenty of drink specials, including $15 margarita pitchers on the weekend (and they're even cheaper during the week), which makes getting your tequila fix all the easier.So not authentic by any means, but still good in its own right.

I ordered 4 items: chicken quesadilla and three tacos (chicharron, asada, and pastor).The chicken quesadilla is relatively similar to the one at Taqueria San Luis--relatively flavorless but juicy. The chicharron taco was a pleasant surprise because it's often not available at most Mexican places in Nashville. It was juicy and spicy, but had moderate flavor. The asada here is more juicy but less flavorful than the asada at Taqueria San Luis. And the pastor is juicy, more spicy than most places, but not as flavorful as the pastor found at food trucks.When I looked around me, I noticed a lot of non-Hispanic clientele. It's a decent joint that's better than most Mexican restaurants in Nashville but definitely not the best. I feel that the food items aren't quite flavorful, but try to make up by adding more spice than you would find at other establishments.

There were about 10 TVs (exaggeration) playing the same soap opera and I wasn't quite sure of the necessity of that many TVs. Oh well. They weren't loud so that wasn't distracting.I've been looking for a place like this for quite some time! Happy to know it is so close! (This could be bad...)"], ["Liam B.", "1/2 chicken and spicy pork tacos with pineapple, delicious. Guacamole and chips are great, too. You have to go here."], ["Steph H.", "This is hands down my FAVORITE Mexican place in Nashville. My husband and I have been going here for about a year now and we have not once been disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, El Tapatio is all you need.For those who have only experienced Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican food, the fare offered at El Taptio might initially seem surprising. The food is not slathered in thick/heavy sauces, nor does it contain very much cheese and sour cream is non-existent here. What you get instead is food that is incredibly fresh and very hearty, but never heavy. The tacos are akin to the ones you would get at the various taco carts around town: two grilled corn tortillas about the size of the palm of your hand filled with onions, cilantro, and the meat of your choice. Sounds simple, but it's so good! My favorite tacos are the lengua (tongue!) and the tripa (tripe!) - if you think you can't stomach stomach, think again! The tripe here is crispy nuggets of pure deliciousness. Still, if you'd like something a little less exotic, you can't go wrong with some spicy pork or the chorizo (the latter isn't listed on the menu, but you can ask for it and they usually have it). If you're looking for something more substantial the tortas (sandwiches) and burritos are super filling and very reasonable at just $5. I love the birria burrito (goat stew), but again, you can get any of the more conventional offerings like chicken, steak, or pork. The burritos come packed with rice, beans and avocado along with your meat, while the sandwiches have the same fixin's as the burritos plus lettuce, tomato and melted cheese. If you come with more than two people they tend to automatically bring out chips with salsa and guacamole--all for free!--but if they don't you can always ask for them to bring you some. The salsas that they bring out are smokey (the red one) and picante (the green one) and very good. Your tastebuds will quiver in delight since it's unlikely that you've ever tasted restaurant salsa that has this much flavor. You can also order beer, various softdrinks (including Mexican varieties), but you definitely need to try the horchata (rice water with a healthy dash of cinnamon). It's so tasty and will help you deal with any spice overload.It's true that Spanish is definitely the preferred language here, but don't let that dissuade you because many of the waitresses do speak enough English to get your order right. The food is so good that a little pantomiming is definitely worth it! There are few places in town where you can get such a delicious and filling meal for under $10, but El Tapatio is definitely one of them."], ["J K.", "I dig this place a lot. Mellow, legit, the half chicken plate is a great deal and as long as the chicken is recently off the smoker you're set. Open late night too, usually til about 2am."], ["Jerry E.", "kind of a dive, but the food is good and loaded with local Hispanic patrons. I almost felt like I was back in Mexico City, which I really enjoy."], ["Winnie L.", "Great Food, fab service, we loved it!!!!"], ["Ben G.", "On the quest for a fish taco, I stumbled into this joint. \u00a0Didn't find a fish taco, but I did find an amazing place to eat!The Ceviche (fish on hard torilla on the menu) is fantastic!! \u00a0The shrimp taco was awesome as well. \u00a0You'll get more shrimp on these $1.25 each treats than you will in entire meals at some fancier places.Guacamole is complimentary (a huge bonus, the trendy places are charing 5-9 bucks for this!) \u00a0though their recipie is a little different than most. \u00a0Chips and two types of salsa (and mole?) come free as well.Cheap eats, spectacular food, and very friendly staff."], ["David G.", "I was quite surprised by El Tapatio given all the positive reviews. \u00a0My girlfriend ordered fish on a tostada. The fish was gray and had a fowl taste. \u00a0I had gorditas. \u00a0While the gordita itself was very good the fillings were pretty rough (the beef was tough and very fatty and the chicken was completely dried). \u00a0We sent the fish tostada back but ate the Gorditas. \u00a0The waitress charged us for the fish and refused to take it off the bill even though we sent it back. (I know Spanish, so miscommunication wasn't a problem). \u00a0I'd probably say this was the worst dining experience I've had in Nashville.Cute building and you get to watch telenovelas which is a plus. \u00a0I didn't order the food some others are raving about so I'll give em 2 stars, but I can't say I'll be going back. \u00a0I don't know if they are under new management, but there are plenty of other options on Nolensville (La Hacienda, taco trucks) which are better choices."], ["Lovette B.", "Alright! So I have been back in Nashville for 6 months and I had not been able to find good AUTHENTIC Mexican food. That was until I tried El Tapatio. It is a small place off Nolensville rd but the food is authentic. Yes its true the staff speaks limited English, so read the menu and order. I had 3 tacos. No this is not that terrible Tex-Mex, it is real Mexican. SO my tacos came with the cilantro, onions, and a soft tortilla. My husband had this huge dish that had three kinds of meat and pineapple...it was surprisingly delicious. He cant stop raving about it. Anytime I need my fix I will be going back to El Tapatio."]]}
