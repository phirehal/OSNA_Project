We ordered: cheese plate appetizer- good.Shrimp and Grits- delicious!Braised short rib- delicious!Filet- fantastic and perfectly cooked!We skipped dessert because we were too full. Food was 5 stars. Why the 4 star you ask? Our waitress was just ok (3.5 stars), she wasn't rude but she also didn't elevate our dining experience. Food seemed to take a while to come out, however we had good company and no where to go, \u00a0so it was ok. Germantown cafe is still my neighborhood favorite but we will definitely be back to the Mad Platter!"], ["Alyssa C.", "I had a great experience here for lunch yesterday 7/17! After 6 hours of flying, we went to Enterprise for a RentaCar and the gentlemen working there highly suggested we go! Started with sharing a crab cake (great flavor, as a new englander I have never tasted one with a little southern touch!) great rolls and fresh butter.Then I got catch of the day! Salmon, Jasmin Rice & Summer squash (so delicious) and for dessert raspberry sorbet! The decor and atmosphere was so homey and I loved all your old fashioned books! Thanks for the great first meal of my trip to Nashville"], ["Susan P.", "The reviews for Mad Platter are mixed and my impression after eating there is mixed, too. \u00a0We really like the Germantown area. \u00a0The service was slightly better than average. \u00a0We were there on a very busy Nashville weekend during Vandernilt commencement with 8:30 reservations and there were only about 3-4 parties in the restaurant which felt a bit creepy. \u00a0We started off with flatbread (really nice but too much cheese for my diet) and a bottle of wine. \u00a0We ordered a wedge salad , the fish special (dry), duck (very nice), the polenta veggie entree (like ratatouille ), crab cakes (ok--kind of mayonnaise-y), and another entree and ravioli appetizer . \u00a0Portions were plentiful. \u00a0We tried to order Elvis chocolate (they were out), then the waiter suggested tiramisu (it wasn't available after all). \u00a0So we ended our evening .I think there is just too many excellent food choices in Nashville for a place like this to survive. \u00a0I would recommend finding another spot. \u00a0Not a bad choice, but there are so many better options in this price range and lower that unless you really need a quiet and low key spot, I would search further."], ["Jerry S.", "We tooke the office staff by The Mad Platter for an informal lunch meeting. Marcia and the staff were very attentive to our needs and allowed us time and space to meet. we never felt rushed and always felt at home. The food speaks for itself.

It was quiet and the service was delightful (Leanna). We started with the wild mushroom ravioli, which was good-nothing spectacular, but good. My husband ordered the bananas foster waffle, which we both enjoyed. It was sweet without being TOO sweet. I had the shrimp and grits. It was insanely good. I loved the gouda and sherry cream reduction. We finished with the trio of brulees. They were all good, but the blood orange soared over the others in flavor. The coffee was excellent and the cocktails were lovely. I enjoyed the spiked spiced tea and the husband had a bloody mary, which he said was excellent. I am docking a star simply because the bathroom really needs a good scrubbing and updating, It wasn't horrible by any means, but it is definitely not up to the standards of the price/class of the restaurant."], ["Candra G.", "Definitely not impressed. \u00a0Service was great, but that's about it. \u00a0I should have known something was up when the placed wasn't packed out on a Friday night in Germantown. \u00a0We started our meal with a cup of mushroom soup. \u00a0Gag - it had a weird after taste and lukewarm at best. \u00a0So, I unfortunately had to send it back (which I hate to do). \u00a0For my main course, I had the shrimp and grits. \u00a0While not the best I've ever had, they were decent. \u00a0My beau had the lamp chop.....which lacked any seasoning whatsoever. \u00a0Needless to say, we tried it - but most likely won't return because there are too many good restaurants in that neighborhood to choose from."], ["Aja B.", "This place was a complete disappointment. Incredibly overpriced for the tiny tiny tiny amount of food you got. The waitress lured us in by telling us the portions were generous, and it was just plain false. They were out of nearly everything and even made substitutions for things that were not on the menu and didn't tell you so we had to find out when we got something different that this was the case. I'm appalled that they are still in business after what was a complete disgrace of a meal that would've cost far less anywhere else and probably have been better. When we complained the waitress acted like she was doing us a favor by bringing out a Dixie cup with more food and said that's just what they gave her. Really? I will never dawn those doorsteps again."], ["Ruiqiu K.", "Finally ventured out to Germantown. Specifically to this place, but it was good to finally try somewhere else in this city.Had the chicken salad, which came on banana bread, which I thought was an odd combination. I've had better banana bread and this was somewhat stale. But I thought the chicken salad was very well seasoned. Fruit consisted of grapes, one which rolled onto the floor somewhere.Not a place I'd specifically come back for, but if I'm in the area and friends wanted to go in, I'd still try something else on their menu."], ["Benji G.", "We are in Tennessee for the first time. We wanted a good place for lunch and tried to go down the street to Mullen's but the wait was over an hour. The front of the house guy suggested a couple places including Mad Platter. This being Father's Day the menu options were a little limited. But they were fine and my family of four was able to choose something that sounded good to them. The service was a bit slow but they were obviously busy for Father's Day.Once the food arrived I was a bit surprised by the portions for the price. Fruit is three small pieces? It tasted good but would've been a much better value for a dollar or two less than they were charging.It was easily one of the most expensive meals we had on our 10 day trip in TN and because of the prices was just not worth it. If it was cheaper I'd go back. Otherwise, when we're in town we'll opt for somewhere else."], ["Tim S.", "Nice homey decor, prompt seating, service got a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush after that. \u00a0We ordered a variety of dishes, all of which seemed pretty decent but all seemed to be influenced by committee rather than a decisive chef. \u00a0My carrot orange ginger soup had a fantastic mix of flavors and a great gingery bite but seemed too lightly based and insubstantial. \u00a0The Rueben (\"best in Nashville!\") had excellent corned beef but was light on sauerkraut presence and I'd be happier if the bread could decide what the hell it was (answer: rye only please). Don't get me wrong, I liked it and will be back but thus far my expectations were a bit higher than what was delivered."], ["Saam T.", "We came through on a food tasting tour. Service was good. We tasted the reuben. I love Reubens and have had my fair share. It was AMAZING. I was full before we ate, but I was the \"gonna eat that?\" guy to everyone that was eating their reuben slowly.

I made it back for the full dinner experience this weekend and wanted to write a current review.We had a party of 6 people, and they were very nice and accommodated the extra two people we brought along. I was bummed that they were out of the one cocktail I wanted, and then I tried to order wine, they were out of BOTH options that I asked for. Eessh... That wasn't great since it was 7:30 on a Friday night... come on guys!They no longer offer the price fix menu that they used to, they now change the menu daily and you need to visit their Facebook page to get a recent menu. Different. Kind of wish that they would post it on their website.Our table ordered appetizers, entrees, and dessert. The shrimp bisque was good but TINY, and the best dish was definitely the mushroom ravioli. It was out of this world. For entrees, the shining star was the duck, but I heard good things about the steak options and the shrimp and grits. I didn't love my lamb, but I think that is more because I don't like the shank part of the lamb. Will order differently next time. Our order of the chocolate creme brule was outstanding and I loved it! We made the mistake of ordering the chocolate Elvis as well and it was a very large piece of chocolate layered cake that was very rich. We should have stuck with the creme brule only, but hey, it was a Friday night so we splurged. Overall, a decent meal but not everything is a shining star dish and they need to stock up on their wine and cocktails!"], ["Gwen K.", "You'd think at the center of the Oktoberfest that this place would rise to the occasion and produce a menu that makes folks want to come back for a nice dinner on another occasion. Our experience was completely the opposite. We went here for dinner years ago, and enjoyed it. Since then, it seems it has not kept itself up - it seemed dirty, the service was slow, and the menu was disappointing. It was overpriced for the amount and quality of the food served, and we will never be back. I'd suggest going instead to some of the many other restaurants in Nashville that seem to care about their food quality, service, and reputation."], ["Scott H.", "Love this place.

The food was outstanding. My husband had the Duck w/ ravioli, and I had a collaboration of many meals. LOL. I have multiple food allergies, and Robin made sure that I was getting exactly what I wanted by explaining my different options and communicating thoroughly with the kitchen. She showed great concern for my annoying food reactions. She could not have been sweeter. I am usually so embarrassed to order food at restaurants, but she actually made me laugh about how silly that is. Our entire experience was amazing. We will certainly be back."], ["Alice H.", "We went for lunch today, not my first time, but I hadn't been there in a while since I used to work down the street. It was holy unremarkable, which is a shame because it is quite pricey for lunch. I give it two stars because the service was spot-on and I like the decor. However, it was far too loud and was a terrible place for a business lunch.I can't speak to the other's food, but mine was very disappointing. It began with a bowl of rolls delivered to the table. They were hot, but not particularly tasty and the butter served with them had a freezer-burned taste. I had the wild mushroom ravioli. It was absolutely bizarre. I love mushrooms, but this was covered in so many sauces (yes, two), that I couldn't taste the filling. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmare, but the pasta didn't taste fresh or homemade. I think that Butoni wild mushroom agnoletti in the grocery store would have been better. Disappointing, too, because Lazarolli's is right across the street and I'm sure they would have provided wonderful ravioli. \u00a0Worst were the sauces. It was floating in a really thin tomato sauce that then had dollops of pesto on top. Both were salty, but then there were the most bizarre spices coming through (for example, dill and cilantro!). A light cream sauce would have been lovely and would have complemented the mushrooms beautifully! It was really, frankly, awful.But to make it weirder, it was served with mushy brussel sprouts that had been cooked with peppers and onions on the side. Maybe that's where that dill came from in the pesto sauce?They had a large sign up that boasted locally-sourced product, such as Noble Springs, but I didn't see any sign that there was goat cheese on the menu! Maybe I didn't read it closely.There are great places nearby that are good values. I wouldn't go back.(I've also had a bad experience with their catering, but that's another story for another day)."], ["Correy S.", "This place seems to want to be better, more tasty and more fancy than it actually is.

I'm not going to try to wax philosophical about the awesomeness of this food; I'm just going to tell you about it and tell you to go there. I'll have to go ahead and admit to my cultural ignorance and say that I had no idea what a pupusa was (nor had I heard of one), but that did not stop me from ordering one. It is meaty, cheesy, tortilla-y deliciousness; that's what it is. They come with slaw, which I normally hate, but this slaw is a little spicy and very good. The tacos are out of this world. Before trying the tacos here, I had recently claimed that another establishment had the best tacos in Nashville. That establishment may have been bumped to second place. They have the requisite Mexican Coke and Jarritos, but you can also get Horchata if that is something you fancy (I haven't gotten up the nerve to try it yet...next time, though). One of the best parts? The price. My husband and I got 2 pupusas, a burrito, 4 tacos, and 2 drinks for about $15. That's right. That's a 1 and a 5 and nothing else after it. We couldn't even eat all of that, either. It's a small place, and the parking lot is small so it tends to get a little crowded around dinner time.

It's absolutely delicious.They have a pretty nice assortment of menu items, and so far everything I've tried has been quite delicious, but I keep going back to the pupusas. The prices are very low (2 pupusas will fill you up and cost just a bit more than $4) and the staff is quite friendly.

My entire meal of two queso con loroco pupusas cost a meager $4.92, after tax. About $2 seems average for most of the pupuseria spots around town, which is mind blowing considering how filling they are. I will say that unlike La Usuluteca, which is still my favorite, they do not give you chips and salsa with your meal. In all fairness, you really don't need those chips because two pupusas are more than enough to put anyone of moderate hunger down for the count.The pupusas here are slightly thicker, lighter, and fluffier than the ones of which I am accustom. They get bonus points for having loroco, which I hear other spots don't have. I was given a large bowl of curtido with my pupusas, which I can never get enough of. It wasn't as fresh or as crisp as I like but even mentioning that is probably being overly critical.Minor tidbits: They don't take cards, so it is cash only.

It was topped with a butter bean puree and sauteed sweet yellow peppers. It was my favorite dish of the night. The beef tartare served with sunflower-topped crisps was very good, but it did have a hint of a spice I don't love, like caraway seeds or fennel. It was not so much that it kept me from eating more than my share, though!Our entrees were a bit disappointing. Both were very salty, and I'm a huge fan of salt, so words I never thought I'd type. We had the garganelli (the better of the two) and rigatoni. I picked the rigatoni as it comes with lamb pancetta and broccoli rabe, and I expected my mind to be blown. It was very, very salty making it hard to eat much of it. I also like noodles cooked al dente, but these were almost too undercooked. The garanelli with pork ragout, while also too salty, was better. The ragout was rich and the noodles perfectly cooked. I wanted to love Rolf and Daughters' food more than I did, but will definitely visit again. They have great, friendly service and a nice variety on their menu."], ["Lawrence C.", "We decided to sit at the bar this time for dinner, \u00a0even though we had a 6pm reservation for dinner.

Enjoy !"], ["Shushu C.", "I had overwhelming expectations after hearing from a coworker that this was one of the best restaurants she went to while visiting in Nashville. Overall the experience was very good, but fell short in a few aspects. \u00a0The atmosphere is very nice...with outside seating and gardens/lighting. The view is not the best...but considering the area there is not much around to look at anyway. We started with bread and seaweed butter and salt. I am not going to say that they 're robbing you..but they're robbing you. The bread was good and the butter was good, but I didn't taste any of the seaweed. The waiter said that the seaweed was added for texture purposes......umm...right. I ain't salty or anything...ha...ha....ok anyway the bread with salt was good. I think with regular butter it would've been the same to be honest. Now charging for bread at a nice restaurant is a nono...Next...Chicken liver pate. It was probably my favorite part of the meal..I just love liver. The seasoning was great..but after 1 bite it started feeling very thick and dry with toasted bread so I think they could've prepared it differently to foil the texture.I got the squid in capellini, which was way too overhyped. To be honest I had a few bites and was a little unimpressed. The crispy fried bits (onions?)were everywhere and was good for taste but just ended up being too much on every bite. The sauce was also too simple, which made the dish just lacking in depth. I've had very good squid ink pasta..so personally I didn't prefer Rolf and Daughters version....But the pork ragu was...amazing. It was perfectly balanced and seasoned and I wanted to keep eating it. I really have mixed feelings about this place. It was just a few steps short of a 5 star review. We ended with the oreo dessert. Whatever the restaurants like jto do it to deconstruct whatever..idk i just still tastes like oreos. They made their own, but tasted a little too healthy. All in all, I was debating a 5 star review but..some points of this restaurant really deterred me. Anyway, this restaurant is definitely still worth revisiting and I will be back to see how they will have changed (if at all)."], ["Ashley T.", "We came here for dinner with my in laws when they were in town visiting. We called ahead on a Friday to ask about reservations and my mother in law was told that it wasn't busy so we wouldn't need one. I found that hard to believe but we went with it. We arrived around 7pm and the patio was packed, as well as the walkway leading up to the restaurant. We were told it was over an hour wait and when we asked about calling ahead, the hostess assured us they don't take reservations on Friday nights. Oh well. We had heard good things about this place and knew anywhere we went would have a wait. So we waited for about 45 minutes and our table was ready. We were seated at a long, community table in the middle of the restaurant with strangers. Not ideal when trying to catch up with family, but it was fine. The service was great. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. He gave us his recommendations and we ordered. My mother in law and my husband both ordered the pasta with red sauce and my father in law and I both ordered the trout. Ha! I don't remember anything spectacular about the pasta, but it did taste fresh. The trout was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully, but the parsley was overwhelming for me. Otherwise, this dish was unique and delicious. The atmosphere is cool and they were playing some pret-ty solid 80s country songs. We could barely hear each other to talk across the table, but the music was a fun touch. Not really what I assumed I'd be listening to while eating the most beautiful piece of trout I've ever eaten. HahaWe ordered 2 deserts on the menu to split, one was some kind of chocolate and coffee desert and the other was fruity. (It's been a hot minute since our visit so I'm drawing a blank). Both were really good. I was full so I didn't have much but otherwise I would have probably licked the plates clean. I would like to go back on a special occasion and try other things."], ["Mitch E.", "I hadn't planned on hitting up any part of German town while in Nashville. After debating where to have my final dinner down there, it was settled. We would be going to German town. Rolf's did not disappoint. It was an amazing meal, at a high quality establishment. Not much of a wait on a Saturday night. Waited by the bar and got a few drinks. Their Manhattan was solid. Once we sat we decided to split lots of things on the menu. All of which was very tasty. My favorite dish here though was their bucatini with octopus. I was skeptical of how well a place in Nashville would make a great pasta like this. They shot down any wonder I had. This was some of the best bucatini I've had. \u00a0My only complaint is that the meal knocked my friends out cold with a serious case of the itis. Come here hungry, and leave happy."], ["Kristin Marie S.", "Oh man, I hate to give it three stars, but there were issues. The food was WAY too salty. Everything, everything, minus dessert was too salty. Without the over-salting the food would have been 5 stars, no doubt. They use sea salt so you really need to use less. We went for our one year anniversary and this is what we ordered.1. Sourdough seaweed butter - not my fav, but I don't like seaweed. The hubbs loved it. It came with salt so I can't comment.2. Beef tartar - fantastic cut, presentation was wonderful! (too salty)3. Garganelli verde - Amazing, I LOVED it! (too salty)4. Roasted chicken - This I especially loved because it's like chicken piccata, but better (too salty)5. O&S tart with PB mousse - Out of this world! (No salt issues here)They accidentally put in an order of liver pate for us so we had that too. Again, wonderful, but too salty.Other thoughts:I feel like they need to expand and add a back room for dining purposes. I felt like I was eating in a bar, which I was. It's great if you want a loud dinner with people milling around you, but if you want a quieter meal this is not the place for you. I hope one day they can build out (obviously this is only if they want to).I loved the space (beyond the noise issues). The staff was fantastic. Our server was attentive and the food came out at a great pace. They treated us really well. I have nothing bad to say. The drinks were great too. They were made well, the bartender was pleasant despite the high-volume of people. He really made us feel welcome.If they can get the salt thing under control I would list this as one of my favorite places to eat in Nashville. I wouldn't necessarily come back for a quiet romantic meal, but I would come back with a group or to celebrate a new job or something. An event where you would want to get lively."], ["Yoonie Y.", "Rolf and Daughters is an amazing \"treat yourself\" meal and experience! I totally fell in love with this place from the moment I sat down. I had called about 2 weeks in advance to make a reservation for a large group at 6pm on a Thursday night. Unfortunately we could not grab a table outside but the inside is just as charming. Our server was so nice and explained the menu thoroughly. Cocktail menu was extensive with cute names like \"The Frank Lloyd Wrong.\" Portions are on the smaller side, so our server recommended a pasta for each person and to share a few entrees. We started with the bread and seaweed butter because I'd heard rave reviews. It was ok... The pork ragu was life-changing! Hands down one of the best things I've ever eaten. The squid ink pasta was also delicious. I can't say I loved my dish (a lamb sausage pasta) as much as I liked the others I tried, but the pasta was still cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back next time I am in Nashville and buy a \"Pasta Manana\" t-shirt! This place is definitely a MUST if you are coming from out of town."], ["alan c.", "Thanksgiving Week 2015: visiting family here for the holidays and we showed up with a big party of 10 for an early dinner. Interesting menu as pointed out by others,...pastas and starters are the strengths. The seaweed butter and salt were interesting but I must admit,...at this price point we are accustomed to getting bread with the meal,..at least on the Left Coast were we live. Charging $5 for a few slices seemed off to me. The desserts were really nothing special and just brewed coffee (no espresso etc) left me wanting more. Good effort and apparently very popular in Nashville,....and in a cool location (old converted warehouse etc) but for $20+ a pasta dish a few more bites in those big bowls and throwing in the bread might be nice. Just saying. Overall solid effort.

Moving on the flavors less subtle, it should seem rather obvious that fried spring onions dressed in citrus and briny shaved roe presented a significant upgrade on standard restaurant rings and, although not exactly large enough to share amongst three as a few bites will only leave the diner wanting more, the tender rounds of sweet potato topped in spicy sausage and those same onions were absolutely brilliant, the heat only arriving on the finish as yogurt tinged in lime presents an up-front bit of tang.Transitioning next to pastas, all made in house with ingredients that sang of farmer's markets in the spring, it was in three plates that appetites were invested and although the gnocchi was a bit softer than purists may prefer the addition of nutty cheese, fresh garlic, and earthy morels provided a depth of flavor rarely seen at 'hip' restaurants, the sweet potato packed pockets of pasta draped in house-cured testa somewhat resembling the flavor of stewed collards while the al dente Campanelle once again found Calabrian pork working its magic amidst a jumble of saut\u00e9ed seafood given extra texture by just enough breadcrumbs to make it all work.More than impressed by savories, and fondly reminiscing about desserts from my Gwynnett St. experience, it was with a 'one of each' order from the sweets section that the meal would conclude, and paired to Stumptown's bold coldbrew the results were nearly on par with the rest, only the slightly over-applied coconut on a chilled plate of strawberries and rhubarb seemingly out of place, while both the subtle citrus tart crowned in nuts and bitter panna cotta topped in crumbles of cookies and sweet milk 'powder' were exactly what I'd expected - a study of contrasts without compromise ready to challenge and surprise."], ["Jean K.", "Half of a chicken is a hefty amount of protein for one meal, regardless of how tasty it is. And yes, the pastured chicken at Rolf and Daughters is delicious, but for $24, a wee bit of vegetables on the side would be nice.The menu was not well thought out and didn't list entrees separately. We were told that the beef sausage was an entree. However, it was served in a salad bowl. One sausage sliced into several pieces and covered with lettuce doesn't seem like an entree, particularly when the chicken entree was half of a chicken, albeit nothing else. I would have called the beef sausage a small plate or salad and the chicken a large plate suitable for sharing since there were no accompanying sides.Perhaps a more thoughtful menu format would have separated entrees from small plates rather than simply listing every item in ascending order by price. An untitled pasta section was separated only by a partial squiggly line. Besides the pasta dishes there were 4 entrees to choose from: brook trout from Florida, beef sausage, pastured local chicken and heritage pork. I wanted fish but since it wasn't local, I opted for the local pastured chicken.The chicken with preserved lemon and garlic confit was delicious. The skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was tender and juicy. Again, it was half of a chicken with no sides for $24. Perfectly cooked and delicious, yes, but it's still only chicken, even if it's pastured. It wasn't even organic. I would have preferred a quarter of a chicken with a couple of sides for that amount.The sourdough with seaweed butter appetizer was tasty but would have been better served hot or at least thoroughly warm. If the bread was complimentary, I would have overlooked it, but it wasn't. I've had complimentary bread, served hot and with infused butters that were better.Overall, the service was excellent, the ambiance trendy and whispers farm to table but in reality may be otherwise (trout from Florida?), the menu needs work, the addition of even one veggie to a $24 chicken entree would be nice and warm tap water in a pretty bottle is still warm tap water.

All the dishes were good, but my favorites of the night were the crostini and squid ink pasta.

In terms of food and interior style, Rolf & Daughters is like most of its \"trendy restaurant\" counterparts. Blank&blank name - check. Badass industrial meets rustic chic space - check. Attractive, tattooed servers - check. Attractive, want-to-be-seen dining patrons - check. Food at places like this is hit or miss, so I was BLOWN AWAY by not only the deliciousness but also the creativity of the menu. I ordered the squid ink canestri, my sister got the gnocchi, and my cousin got the rigatoni. All three were equally delicious; I really was unable to pick a favorite. Hands down, the best pasta I've ever had. Other pastas I have from now on will probably pale in comparison to the three I tried here. R&D was one of the, if not THE experience, that completely made my trip to Nashville. R&D gets 5 stars for being amazing all-around!Tip: If you don't have a reservation, arrive right at opening.

But Thursday night was the first time I had dinner. OHMYGOSH. I ordered the KLD farm burger because I'd been dying for a burger for weeks. Best decision I've made in a long time. But before I get to that, I'll start with starters. I ordered a cheese plate for the table, which was wonderful and exactly what I expected. I also didn't want to drink that night since I was driving, so I asked them to make me a mocktail of their choosing. Don't know what was in it but it was excellent! And at only $5, it was a steal. And now...back to that burger. It came with their amazing fries (score!). The meat was the highest quality, most perfectly cooked meat I've ever had in a burger. I mean, PERFECT. It had slightly melty Gorgonzola, caramelized onions, a fried yellow tomato, arugula, a fried egg, and deliciously salty, smoky ham. I added some whole grain mustard, because burgers need mustard. The bun was perfectly chewy and didn't break or tear even with all the messy ingredients. Best burger I've EVER HAD. Ever. And I've eaten more burgers than I can't count in more wonderful restaurants. It was a wonderful evening with great food and drink, and one of the prettiest and most relaxed environments in the city. If I lived closer, I would be here at least once a week. Keep it up, Holland House! You're perfect just the way you are."], ["Chelsea J.", "I have frequented Holland House for a drink and app while waiting the eternity that is the wait to get seated at The Pharmacy next door. Luckily, Holland House has great bar seating and excellent cocktails. I recently came here for restaurant week and was a tad disappointed. I would give 3 stars for my restaurant week experience, but considering my experiences in totality, I decided to give 4 stars overall. The two of us arrived for our reservation and we were told our table wasn't ready yet, even though empty tables for 2 were visible from where we were waiting. Then other groups of 2 who came in after us were sat before us. This peeved me. As a previous slave (aka waitress) to the restaurant industry, this doesnt make sense to me. Once we were sat (maybe the hostess noticed my unblinking stare at the empty tables) our waiter was prompt and our appetizers quite good. I got the green bean salad and would come back to Holland House for this alone. I ordered the pork brisket and while the sauce, and accompanying mashed parsnips were delectable, the pork left much to be desired. I know how hard it can be to cook pork, and sadly Holland House fell into this trap and served dry pork.We shared the bourbon and pecan cake which was really good but I could have eaten the whole thing in a single bite. For a $10 dessert is it unfair to expect at least two bites? Not sure I'll come here again for a meal, but I do enjoy their starters so I'll be around again."]], "Rumours East": [["Jesse F.", "Went here for New Years Eve, and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. I hear \"remodeled Victorian\" and automatically think \"cramped and awkward\". Though it is a small restaurant, it was more than functional, and I thought the design and decor made excellent use of the dining space. The bar looked like a cozy place to get a drink, although I didn't have the opportunity this time around. I will note that the parking situation worked out great (close, on-street), although I fully acknowledge this may not be the case for non-early birds, residential roads being what they are.I did the NYE menu, which you would naturally expect to be limited + overpriced, and it was. Not that the $55 prix fixe was unreasonable for the occasion; in fact, it was the least expensive option I could find. But the pairings (4) were $35 extra, and the portions were definitely on the small side. As a comparison, a recent meal at the nearby Lockeland Table was similar in price and quality, yet must have been 3x the amount of food. Granted, I didn't go to LT on a holiday, and the menu there skews more traditional than contemporary, but a night at Rumours East will likely conclude with you digging in your pantry when you get home. The food itself was really excellent, and though pricey, the pairings were enjoyable as well. Since it was a one-off menu, maybe it's pointless to recount specific dishes, but I thought the (literally bite-size) fried quail and pilaf was a stand-out. Our dessert disappointed -- the torte was great, but not what my wife expected; hardly Rumours' fault. My carrot cake was pretty dry, though I did eat every bite, so it clearly wasn't offensive. I hope my comment to our server wasn't either, I just thought dessert didn't hold up to the otherwise lovely meal. Rumours East would still be in the \"special occasion\" category for me, but I might not be so afraid to snack in advance."], ["Cheyenne C.", "Low-key place in Nashville. The menu is a bit overpriced considering the food isn't as good as other restaurants in Nashville at that price. The food here is very basic... Long, delicious sounding descriptions on the menu, but the recipes are actually very simple. Cheese plate is just ok. Decent wine selection but not a terribly knowledgable staff. Nice staff, however.

Then it took the bartender who was just walking by and noticed I was waiting on my server to show up 15-20 minutes later for my order to get placed. My server was not attentive at all throughout the night and she would show up every 15 minutes or so but never bothered to refill my water until I asked for my to-go box at the end of my meal.

Well, there were no tomatoes on the watermelon and tomato salad nor was there any balsalmic on the plate. The dessert was bland and not worth finishing.

Rumours delivered and then some. The food is creative, fresh, and has spices and textures you can't find anywhere else in Nashville, except for Etch, maybe. Etch is similar in technique, but sticks to more of a Euro/Asia spice set. (You can tell they cooked together before). At Rumours, you can taste Western Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean, even South America. The food will transport you to the native country for a wonderful, delicious, moment.

Not that the experience was bad by any means, but maybe I expected too much because of the hype from my friends. Moving on........When we entered the front door, we were warmly greeted by the hostess. She was so nice when we walked in, and that, coupled with the fact that we were in an old house with a cozy fire going, felt like we were being welcomed into someone's personal home, and not a restaurant/bar. It was a very nice first impression and start to our evening. She then gave us the option to sit in the bar area or in the dining room with the fireplace. We chose to cozy up next to the fire at a small table. Our server Patrick quickly came to the table, introduced himself and promptly asked if we had any questions about the wine or appetizers. We started with a cheese plate and a glass of prosecco. The cheese plate came with four different cheeses, sliced granny smith apples, two small loaves of bread, candied pecans, and apple butter. I enjoyed all of the cheeses and loved them all paired with the fresh apples and ridiculously delicious apple butter. The prosecco was also a great recommendation from Patrick and worked well with the entire plate. Just as we finished our cheese plate, the entrees that we ordered were on the table. I ordered the lamb sausage with shaved carrot, celery, and apple salad with spiced almonds, and the couscous fritters. I was a little leery of the lamb sausage because it can definitely be a little gamey to me, but the spices in the sausage were a great complement to the meat and disguised any gaminess that might have been present. There was definitely a North African tilt to the meal with the spice combination in the sausage having cumin, coriander, cayenne, etc... \u00a0The almonds had some nice flavor and spice as well, but the couscous fritters were a little bland and dry. There was also a spicy tomato based sauce that was under everything that really tied in nicely with the other flavors on the plate. We decided that we would get our dessert to go because by the end of the meal we were too full to enjoy another bite. It was a dark chocolate torte with a mixed berry coulis and whipped cream. Even though I typically like desserts that are not overly sweet and love dark chocolate, this one was almost salty. Unfortunately, this was a big disappointment at the end of a pretty solid meal. Definitely not enough to turn me off from going again, but worth noting.

For my entree I had salmon, which came with a yummy lemon, asparagus risotto cake. Different and flavorful. The salmon was cooked perfectly. My dessert was a chocolate torte and, well, you just can't go wrong with that.I ordered one glass of wine, which I enjoyed, but my boyfriend got the wine pairings. The wines were all well chosen, including the port to go with dessert. I didn't think I liked port, but it was delightful with the chocolate. There was a surprise bonus - jazz playing in the bar. We were sitting at the bar, because I like sitting at bars, and were worried that the music might be too loud or annoying (having run into that occasionally at other establishments).

I went with some friends for Restaurant Week, which is probably a way for restaurants to increase their average check by a lot... odd that it remains wildly popular. Anyway, if you opted for the \"special menu\", it was $30.12 with $20.12 wine pairing, versus about $16 for the vegetarian entree on the regular menu (gnocchi).The first course was: \"Bruschetta with butternut squash jam, watercress, shaved parmesan cheese, and green chili reduction.\" It was OK. A piece of not-crunchy but not-quite-chewy bread with what tasted like applesauce on top... if there was any green chili reduction or watercress or parmesan cheese, the quantity was so small that I didn't notice any. Not particularly inspiring, and definitely not worth the price... One of the other people in my party had the salad - decent salad, but nothing spectacular.The main course was: Roasted eggplant cheese polenta terrine, arugula, and pickled onion salad. The sauce was overpowering! The eggplant, cooked very nicely and tender, would have been delicious had I been able to taste it better. The pickled onion salad, well, that was also very pungent and far too strong for the dish. But not bad. The portion size also was decent, not just a tiny sliver some fancy restaurants tend to do. Most of my party had the steak option, which they agreed was tender, although one person's cut was less high-quality than the others.The dessert I had was the chocolate torte. No way it was worth the $8 of the menu price. It wasn't bad, but again, nothing super-salivary-inducing. The bread pudding also wasn't bad, but nothing too special either.Thus, this is a charming little restaurant with a cozy inside reminiscent of a coffee shop and a gorgeous backyard grassy dining area that produces decent food, with plenty of vegetarian options, and can rightfully be in the lineup of yummy East Nashville food options."], ["Scott C.", "This was my first time checking this spot out and I was mad that i hadn't been until now. \u00a0 We started off with the mediterranean platter, mussels, and the goat cheese and beet terrine. \u00a0Absolutely delicious!! \u00a0The scallops were to die for! \u00a0Cool spot in the trendy east side, and everyone should check it out if you have not."], ["L G.", "Very disappointed.

I had put a note on my reservation that I wanted to sit outside in the back area and upon arrival was told it was full and would take 45+ minutes to sit out there so that was a bit disappointing. Still sat outside on the side area, but not quite as nice although still enjoyable. Our server was very nice and did a good job overall. Food was excellent, enjoyed every course, we ordered 3 separate dishes for each course so we could share half and half and got to enjoy a lot of tasty food. Girlfriend had the wine pairing which seemed to go well with the dishes presented.

Just down from a commercial hub, the restaurant sits up off the street in an old house. We ate outside in the backyard. It was simply divine, albeit, a tad warm (as it was August), but they set up one of those commercial fans, the kind you'd find in a warehouse or an auto body shop.Before getting too far off track, the food, delicious, inventive and perfect portion sizes. For starters, fried green tomatoes and a shared salad. For our entrees, I had the scallops - seared so they were \u00a0firm, sweet and served over grits with a spinach salad. Husband had the pork loin. Fortunately, he was on a diet so he offered me a bite of the tender meat and a lot of his potato gratin and fresh cabbage salad and chimichurri.A final note, the server was delightful, attentive, but not pushy, knowledgeable about the wines, but again, not pushy and efficient.

We all split a bottle of wine and we could not pass up the chocolate torte made with local Olive & Sinclair chocolate.  \u00a0 The tortes were absolutely awesome and despite the small dessert selection, we all were very pleased with our choice. \u00a0 \u00a0 I would highly recommend this place for drinks and dessert, in relation to this visit."]], "Americano - Freestyle Tapas Bar": [["Ashwin M.", "My name is King Felipe Von Toblerone and I am happy to say that my kingdom of Spain approves this tapas bar and its tastes. I hereby grant it the official El Yummita status which means it's one of the three tapas bars in the world that is authorized to serve food to me (the other two are in the domestic terminal of the Malaga airport) What are the requirements for El Yummita classification, you ask? They are quite simple. One, the el chef must have been trained in the deep southern heartlands of Andalucia, amongst the stone walls of the Alhambra and the narrow, winding streets of the Arab quarters. He must know the poetry of a huevo and how it must rise to a brunchful occasion to sing our glorious national anthem: Tortilla Espanola. The el chef has masterfully grated manchego cheese on the tortilla, and has taken it to outerspatial levels unheard of in our rich heritage of ten years.Two, the el tapas bar must cater to my vegetarian friends, for what is life without cooked and spiced vegetables? Battered and roasted cauliflowers, the roasted mushrooms, and tacos. Ah! What delightful. And what about a tribute to our queen, El Gordita? The el chef's Patas Bravas are so sublime in their crispily crunchily outside and creamily delicious inside, it's a delight to fly Southwest from my capital city, Ibiza, to Nashville just to eat them. I am happy to report that the el chef of Americano has met and exceeded the rigorously high standards of our national country of Espanola, and I, King Felipe Von Toblerone grant him Robinhood status for his congratulations on the El Yummita medal of condor. I don't comprehend why he named the restaurant after a coffee, but our national drink of cerveza is quite ensaddened.

We ordered the garlic shrimp, the Brussels sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, quail, tuna guacamole, potatoes bravas and arugula salad. The quail was dry and needed some salt even although the dressing was quite intense. The sauce for the potatoes was too sweet for my liking and so was the tuna sauce. The sprouts were very good but the tomatoes were simply amazing. They crush their own olive oil which really enhanced the tomatoes and blue cheese and turned it into a delicious dish. Would probably have got four stars but then being completely ignored after the food was served so that I waited about twenty minutes for a drink refill was enough to drop a star. I complained to the waiter when he finally came around and he got me another beer. He was very nice about it but no offer to comp the beer or do anything else substantive to remedy the long dry wait cost them a point on this one.

It is spicy, but it's also delicious. The fried cheese is also amazing. Then again, how do you mess up fried cheese? But the jam it comes with really sends it over the top. The patatas bravas was probably my least favorite. But, I'm spoiled by memories of delicious ones back east near Boston.

I will be ordering this salad again and again!! The manchego cheese on top was truly the \"icing on the cake\".The chicken skewers should really be called \"chicken skewer\" because you only get one. It's plenty for one person but may not be enough to share. The chicken is grilled perfectly and I enjoyed every moment of it. It's served on top of hummus and garlic mayo, which were fine but the chicken really made the dish. The service was impeccable and the bartender was friendly and welcoming.

How is fried cheese never awesome?? We will definitely return!"], ["Kristin W.", "Went here for my bachelorette party. It took an hour for our reserved table to be read, took 2 hours to receive everyone's food (they brought it each plate individually) the girl who received their food first was done eating \u00a0before the next girl received her plate.

The hot cauliflower is my favorite. The staff are super friendly and I love the atmosphere!"], ["Mark L.", "Eaten tapas in Spain and while not authentic to the recipes of the country still very good.

They could use mor Spanish wines to complete the meal."], ["Mark M.", "Unreal good. \u00a0Probably best meal I have had in Nashville so far. \u00a0Had Crispy Brussel sprouts, Spicy Tuna Guacamole, and Blustered Baby Heirloom Tomatoes. \u00a0Has good patio area, good atmosphere, and must have good drinks by the laughter at tables near me ;-)"], ["S R.", "This place is amazing!! I've been here twice for dinner with family members, and the tapas are really great. Both times we tried a bunch of stuff off the menu- everything was cooked perfectly, so there is nothing I don't recommend, but the real stand outs for me were the fried manchego, the dates tapa, and the chicken and hummus plate (this one really surprised me, as I'm not normally a fan of chicken, but it's phenomenal!).

With that out of the way, this place is badass bro! I came for lunch on a weekday. Owner is sooo Miami. Got me the ropa vieja, tostones, arroz y frijoles, basically the whole damn menu. Can you say authentic AF? Cuz I sure can. Like for real though, that shit was fireeeeee. Irregardless, I dropped some Spanglish on the owner to build some street cred. It worked. After I finished ravaging my food the owner brought out some empanadas to go. Respect bro, respect. Oh and to those complaining about the service...welcome to your first Miami experience. Stop being soft and toughen up, you'll get the same service in Miami. You're right about the prices being expensive though but whatever its bomb Cuban in Nashville. I'll gladly hand over the plata."], ["Simon C.", "Ugh. Liked it on my first visit. Second visit a friend and I placed an order and then sat down. We waited a solid 40 minutes and asked about the food. It never came, so we walked out the door having wasted a lunch break. It gets worse from here.. The Owner ran out into the parking lot accusing us of not paying for our food. We explained the situation and she only said that the server must have done a bad job. No offer to get us food, no apology for the accusations. I'd like to have a good Cuban food option, but can't bring myself to go back and voluntarily give them my money after the experience with the owner."], ["Liz C.", "As a Cuban that grew up in Miami, this place is the real deal. The black beans are off the chain! Anything you get here is awesome. Love Alex, the owner. He's your typical, know it all, loud mouth Cuban.

All was AMAZING & totally authentic. For the dessert we all ordered cafecito, rice pudding & flan. Will definitely come back while in Nashville."], ["Miriam F.", "Pretty good Cuban food.

I've had the shrimp plate with rice; the shrimp was cooked well, and had a nice tomato based sauce. It had a side of plantains which was awesome, then it had some sliced avocado (yum), and iceberg lettuce which was just alright, and then slices of tomato (these were not ripe though). I've also had the Cuban sandwich, no complaints there! The sandwich is huge, yummy, and very well priced.

Missed the ropa vieja y Elena ruz, pero they had the essentials! They do have quite a large selection of sandwiches. Everything was delicious. Rice was perfect. Black beans 9/10.

He was so pushy and rude I felt compelled to take my food to go. He almost didn't let me take my food- insisting that their was outdoor seating and I should stay- and then implying that I had seriously \u00a0inconvenienced them.

They do have plates like meat and sides but the sandwiches are where its at. Also fried plantains there and their milkshakes are pretty awesome.

I haven't had many Cuban sandwiches but even the 'eh' ones are still pretty good. The sandwich here didn't disappoint and I came in during a slow period so the counter service was friendly, though a little limited in the English. I ended up with the Cubano with the key ingredient: the crusty, toasted bread-which separates the men from the boys when it comes to the sandwich. I thought it was a little light on the roast pork-part of why Cuban sandwiches are so awesome since it's two types of pig in one convenient package. Still, the crusty, crunchy bread and the satisfying snap and crunch from it is still on my mind even after a few days.

The Yelp lords showed favor via the App to a place near my house. I have been here before, but never had their Empanadas. Shame on me!The order consisted of two empanadas, one beef and one chicken. Both of the pastry goodness delights were encased in large shells. The meat pocket was on the small side leaving a large crimped edge. Each treat is less than two dollars and is packed with tons of flavor.The savory filling of beef was mild and had a green olive in the mix. It was easy on spice and nice light flavor. It paired well with the chimichurri sauce that I asked for because of its herbal garlicky bite.The chicken filling was really amazing. Although I was craving a beef experience, the chicken event stole the show. Wow! The stewed meat was flavor packed with a spicy depth of flavor and just a hint of heat. Good greif, it was good. I tried with the condiments offered on the counter, but it didn't need any assistance. The rich buttery crusts of both treats left behind \"chips\" that that I used to douse in the spicy condiments and herbal chimichurri. For good measure, I enjoyed a Cafe Cubano which was deep in coffee flavor and the sweetness of pure cane sugar. Oh, my, add a slice of their Tres Leches Cake after a couple of empanadas for $10 for the meal, you will have been transported to wonderful place."], ["Katie S.", "I love this place. I just went there for my 2nd visit and can't wait to go back for more. The food, as last time, was amazing, authentic, well-prepared, and I couldn't have been more impressed.

We normally have a no phones at the dinner table policy, but a glance at a message is okay at our table. While I was checking the message, a man, who I could only presume to be the owner, hollered at me from behind the counter, \"No texting, put your phone away at the table!\"My wife and I looked at each other, incredulous. I realize that it is his restaurant and he can run it as he sees fit, however, there was no sign notifying patrons of this policy. Also, if he wanted to make an issue of it, he could've visited the table and discreetly asked us to comply with his wishes. We DID comply, as I didn't want to be asked to leave while finishing my meal, but I will never dine in this restaurant again. It's a damn shame, too. The Lechon Asado was absolutely delicious.

Matt was super. He gave us some time to look through the menu and poured us water which he was super attentive to. My boyfriend asked for something off the menu and he really went above and beyond to figure it out and made it for us and it was wonderful. We had two drinks each and we really enjoyed all four.

We didn't have a reservation and were fortunate enough to get there within 30 mins of them opening and we still had a 40 minute wait. \u00a0Once inside, the atmosphere is like that of an early 1900s speakeasy. Lots of natural finished wood, tin ceiling tiles, bartenders dressed in a way that further portrayed this vibe. I ordered a Southside with a gin that the bartender recommended instead of my original request (Plymouth) and he went into detail describing the finer points of what made it good. He sold me so I went with it - was very good. My second drink was a whiskey sour, and this was executed with perfection. \u00a0 My girlfriend asked for a sweet/chocolate inspired flavor profile and he delivered. Her second drink was a Brandy Alexander which he made for her and let her try it before revealing what it was, which was fun. \u00a0The drink prices weren't terrible - $12 for most. This isn't a a \"rum and coke\" kind of place - go in with a flavor profile in mind and let them surprise you. The food was so-so - my girlfriend got the grilled cheese and tomato soup and I got the wings and the tots. The wings were pretty bad to be honest. To the point where they need to take them off the menu until they figure out how to make wings properly. They were breaded and just not good. Had an odd flavor. The tots were good but who can mess up tots? The grilled cheese/soup was good - but the soup was \u00a0somewhat cold when it arrived.

When ordering it, I asked the bartender if they heard of New York's PDT. He told me yes, and they had gotten permission to make their version of it. I'm so glad they did. It was better than PDT's and that says a lot. My friends and I ordered several rounds of drinks. Sampling and trying different creations that out mixologist concocted.

We were lucky enough to get a booth after about a 15 minute wait but soon after lines were piling outside to try and get in. The Patterson House is limited in food items and we ordered just about one of everything since we'd skipped dinner. The menu is divided by liquor type and it's a lot of choices so be ready to take a minute before ordering since drinks tend to be priced a little on the higher side but they do not disappoint. Favorite food items for the night were the fried brie, the wings and the sliders. Tater tots were a little on the greasy side and the ones at Merchants are way better in my opinion so I'd probably skip it and opt for another choice.

The menagerie of liquors is mind-boggling. I recommend sitting at the bar if you've got a small group and watching the bartenders mix your old-style drinks.The old fashioned is the best in town, and you cannot get a true authentic Tom Collins, French 75, etc anywhere else. The bacon old fashioned gets a lot of hype. Personally, I think the bacon infusion smells like bacon but tastes more chemically on the palate. I would just stick to a classic old fashioned.Ambience has a true speakeasy feel with damask walls, chandeliers, and dimly lit interior with leather booths and seats.

I'm glad we did because there are no signs visible from the street so it would have been even harder to figure out in the dark.We showed up around 8pm on a Monday and there was no wait! Off to a good start. We sat at the bar. I was hemming and hawing at the menu. I didn't want to get something I could get at just any bar but didn't know exactly what I was in the mood for. Plus I had no idea what half the ingredients were so I just ended up winging it and getting a drink with rum. I can't remember the name but I think it's one of the first one's listed on the rum section of the menu...and it was amazing. Big fan. Citrusy and rummy and yum.It is a cool atmosphere and one of those fun places to come and feel fancy.

The retro styling of the bar is much more suited to the newer style trend you see. \u00a0Hit this place up, well worth the stop. Has a Brooklyn, a bacon old fashioned, both were fantastic.

This venu is beautiful, old world, charming. The bartenders are in suit vests. The lights are dim. The drinks are phenomenal! This is NOT the place to order a whiskey and coke. This is the place to try something new. The bartenders put on a great show making their concoctions and every liquor and infusion is the highest of quality. The drinks are fresh, new, different, adventurous. Embrace the concept and trust your bartender. Ours was great. He asked a few questions about preferences and delivered delicious product! One drink came out a little too dry for me, he remade it for me sweeter and didn't charge for the first. These guys are really here to make sure you get quality drinks you love, tailored to your tastes.We ate prior, so we didn't sample the food. But the girls next to us had the tots and brie and were really happy with them. They looked fantastic.I wish I could take this bar home with us. No matter why we are in Nashville next, if we can manage to go here we will! If you are open to a little adventure, this will be amazing for you.

Because we were not in our early to mid twenties (We're very hip and dressed impeccably well- as far as that goes, AND in our late 30's) and were not dressed in popped collars and designer threads, we were shoved to the side. \u00a0The hostess was dumb, and not friendly. \u00a0I'd never recommend anyone trying this place due to those facts alone."], ["Jazmine V.", "I REALLY like this place. I will be back. Let me preface by saying their food/drinks are a bit expensive...even for the thought/dedication that goes into the drinks. $12/drink for most drinks. Apps range from $6-$15. I had the oysters. There were 5 of them. They were very good...but $15 is a lot of money. But lets focus on the positive. You're basically walking into a pre-prohibition bar. The ambience is amazing. The bartenders look...handsome and well-trimmed. They are really good what they do. They will make you drinks that aren't on the menu if you just let them know what your taste is. Be careful, you might get lost and miss this place if you don't know exactly where it is. It's discreet. But it's an experience that you've likely never had."], ["Dennis J.", "Fantastic venue and drinks. Would highly recommend.I stopped by by myself on a Sunday evening around 9 PM, and I still had to wait about 30 minutes to get into the bar, so the place is extremely packed generally speaking. I dropped in to have a few drinks, the first of which the bacon infused bourbon. It was a very flavorful and subtle drink, and the cocktail list is extremely expansive and well constructed. The bartender was very engaging and informative for drink recommendations, and the venue is not too loud and not too dark, making it very conducive for conversation for small groups. It's a great place with great drinks and for small groups."], ["Alice W.", "Nothing tickles my pickle like a $14 cocktail and this place is one of the best cocktail places in the country. The cocktails here are legit and you could tell that the bartenders really know what they're doing. The bartenders are artists that take pride in their craft.My hubby and I had 4 drinks here. One of the standout was the bacon manhattan. Our second round of drinks, our server asked us give him some flavor profiles that we like and he made drinks for us. It was just great talking with the bartenders about bitters and even dough starters. They're so knowledgeable and obviously love what they do. What a gem. Be ware that there's going to be a wait but it's so worth it!"]], "Eastland Cafe": [["Cristina M.", "Great food for our company dinner. Fresh, pretty fast and consistent! Staff knew the food and drinks to pair. Must go even if you don't buy out the restaurant and have a set menu!"], ["Johnny T.", "4.5Eastland Cafe might not get the press/attention of some of its neighbors or comparable restaurants in the city but, trust, it's serving up some excellent food, satisfying cocktails and engaged service -- all in an environment you're going to want to experience. It had been on my to-try list for months and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to go there. Parking's a breeze (street or nearby lot) so don't let that be a deterrent (and, please, don't park across the street).Once you walk in, you realize that the space is a bit bigger than it appears from the street. This allows your group of six (or so) to be as comfortable as you might be on a date. It's homey and inviting but doesn't sacrifice ambiance for either. As is my custom, I began the evening with a cocktail before delving into wine/beer. As an homage to my many years in Chicago, I opted for the Violet Hour: gin, lemon, simple syrup, and lavender bitters. Unsurprisingly, it was a floral yet muted beginning to the evening. I'm not the world's biggest gin fan but I found myself intrigued by this cocktail. I'd, gladly, order it again. As I sipped my cocktail and took in the mood lighting, our waitress brought out a hot bread basket with chimichurri. Pace yourself on this or else it's game over. Because we weren't carb-loaded enough, we ordered the chitarra pasta -- which I liked saying because, Thundercats. It's an addictive melange of: red bell pepper emulsion, sun dried tomato, garlic, shallot, chile, and tapenade crouton. Incredible.For dinner, I thought I'd slow it down with a beer and some comfort food. I was looking for a barleywine but there wasn't any on the menu. I didn't hold it against them. Nashville is still getting its footing when it comes to beer. I 'settled' for a bourbon barrel ale to accompany shrimp & grits. Yes, I came to a restaurant like Eastland Cafe and ordered shrimp & grits. And, you know what? I'd do it again. These were ridiculous. Even though I am a native southerner, I am relatively new to the world of grits. I blame Cream of Wheat and early school days. Now that I know the warm hug of properly-prepared cheese grits, it's a new story. Not only did the plate have an ample amount of sweet & meaty shrimp, the grits were a star in their own right (and not just a side show). To the cheese grits add a healthy dose of mushrooms, green onion and lemon... and, man... don't even know. Again, coupled with my beer, it was the perfect pairing for a cold evening.But, if I was going all in, I couldn't just stop there, right? I had to have dessert. I had to have the granny smith apple donut. I mean, it's apple rings (healthy) fried in a cinnamon dough (donuts) and served with caramel ice cream/gelato/I don't know. My eyes had glazed. My ears weren't functioning. All I knew is that I had to eat every morsel of food on that plate. All else was inconsequential. After dinner, I barely made it home before popping my top button on my pants and passing out. Yeah, Eastland Cafe needs to be in your rotation."], ["Mia F.", "I've lived in Nashville for \u00a09 years, and never gone to Eastland Cafe. I heard great things for a long time about the restaurant so decided to try it. . . \u00a0Honestly, I would give a 3.5 Star review if I could. It wasn't bad at all. . . just wasn't what I expected from the hype and for the money. Husband and I popped in for a quick dinner on a Sunday. We got a table right away, and the service was really good. We both ordered cocktails, but my husband had to send his back - it didn't taste much like the description, and the bourbon was weak (weak enough that I could sip it \u00a0- and I hate bourbon) . . . our server even agreed. We sent it back and he just ordered Bourbon on the rocks. However, my drink was great (gin, lavender and rosemary I believe). We ordered the Margherita pizza and shrimp and grits. We didn't want too much, so we decided to split the shrimp and grits. $4 plate sharing fee. .. .ugh. Really? The shrimp and grits were good, different - \u00a0with a French flare, but good. The decor was nice, service from our waiter was really good, but the food. . . it was just good. Granted pizza and shrimp and grits aren't anything adventurous. . . but still - for the cost of the drinks and food.I'll definitely try it again and order something different. . . . but it took my 9 years to get there the first time."], ["Shannon S.", "Reading through the reviews of Eastland Caf\u00e9 prior to our dinner we expected a mixed bag of experiences. We got just that. The bartender (Will) was lovely to chat with and very accommodating while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.Once we all sat down it took the server about 15 minutes to get to us at all... and the restaurant wasn't even full. We ordered appetizers which were overall delicious: pork belly, charcuterie plate, fried green tomatoes (not so delicious) but then had to pull the waiter back to order our meal.While others complained their chicken was dry and without flavor, ours was really yummy. Seems strange for a restaurant to have so many inconsistencies. They also charge $4 to split a plate which seems ridiculous to me. We had several courses! Overall the food was good but the service was really bad. It would be hard to recommend this restaurant to others."], ["Hilary H.", "This review is merely for happy hour. There were plenty of drink and food options with great prices for happy hour. The outdoor space is very nice and comfortable. There was nothing remarkable about the food- we had the pot stickers margarita pizza and pimento jalape\u00f1o cheese dip and all tasted pretty good...

Will sadly NOT go back I cannot believe how much we paid for Panko crusted rubber"], ["Hall W.", "So I have a mixed feelings about this place.Lets start with logistics - good luck getting a seat on time (even with reservations - we waited about an hour) because this spot has become insanely popular (especially during the winter). They also seem to run out of things rather quickly (i'm assuming popularity has something to do it - then again popularity might be a sign of how they are doing things right).There seems to be an utter shortage of staff and I felt really bad for those that were there, just completely unable to keep up.Now the food is to die for and probably the best I will ever have in Nashville without losing my bank account. Everything from the bread to the salmon to the goat cheese spread is a heavenly experience. The portions may not be French, but they are on the smaller side of things for an American food standards. I will also say that the staff was super friendly to do what they could to take care of us when things died down and give us alternative menu options and comp us for the wait - which I really appreciate."], ["Jake S.", "One of my favorite happy hours ever.

Our server, Nick, was also really great. \u00a0He was helpful and kept an eye on our table without constantly checking. \u00a0When he found out that we had just arrived in town, he made a list of places he recommended that we see while in town and really made us feel welcome. \u00a0He also recommended a sinfully desert - if they are serving the apple/donut/ice cream thing you must get it - especially if you like things that melt in your mouth.

Being a drunk i always feel more comfortable actually sitting in view of the bottles I am knocking down one gulp at a time. This great space located just off the corner of the Hillsboro Center.

A tasty elixir topped with freshly grated nutmeg.In addition to the great bar here what I liked was the scene, yea, its a milf scene. Much like a riverbank can become host to all types of oddities and treasures that flow through the arms of a river, 360 Bar is at the end of Belle Meade, Chickering, Harding and Tyne Blvd, modern rivers of pavement all. What flows through these areas and into the 360 bar isn't the runoff, gravel or sediments that one might find at Applebees or Waffle House, but gems, diamonds, rubies, the lode of Nashville's femininity, sanded and polished at St. Cecilia and Harpeth Hall. Bored housewives in need of a drink. Its a beautiful thing. These girls take care of themselves, no spandex or Lane Bryant here..It seems that it was important to meet the chef, Aaron, a lot of patrons there were visiting with him, a nice enough guy. He's supposed to be a magician in the kitchen, perhaps even a mad sorcerer. \u00a0On my first night here I ventured no further than the 'burger with fries' with a side of Gorgonzola, naturally. It was great, outstanding. I can't imagine how it could have been improved upon..except perhaps one last pumpkin martini for the road.."], ["VIcki T.", "Celebrated a wedding anniversary here last night and the experience was very pleasant. \u00a0Ordered the calamari - which my husband and I considered to be one of the top 10 calamari appetizers we have ever had - and we order it everywhere almost every place available. \u00a0He ordered the halibut special which was great and I had the burger which has a hint of sweet bbq and the fries are served in a miniature fry basket. \u00a0Well worth the $20. \u00a0Unfortunately, they were out of the wine my husband ordered so he substituted and it was not quite up to par at $25 for each glass - the wine was more expensive than our entrees. \u00a0Next time we may bring our own wine even though they charge a $25 corkage fee. \u00a0We would also be able to enjoy the wine at the proper temperature. \u00a0Overall, very good experience and the servers (especially Josh) were very attentive. \u00a0We will be back making minor adjustments."], ["Lyndi S.", "I walked in this place a little bit skeptical. \u00a0Partially because Nashville doesn't do fancy as well as they do dive-y. \u00a0Mostly because when Nashville does do fancy, it's hit or miss with the snooty-factor. \u00a0This place definitely did right by Nashville! \u00a0And by my visiting mother, who was looking for a nice night with a decent cocktail and a light meal.I arrived expecting a somewhat emtpied out restaurant, with 20-somethings crowding the bar. \u00a0I was shocked to find a pretty wide ensemble of people, and a crowded date-night scene. \u00a0The bar was open, so we sat there and got right down to brass tacks. \u00a0The drink menu.Great selection of wines, and a lovely little list of martinis and refreshing cocktails. \u00a0I went with a dry, nutty Shiraz, while boyfriend took on a deliciously spicy and fruity Syrah. \u00a0My mom went for the gold and beat us both with her Pumpkin Martini. \u00a0All were delicious!The food is no sham either. \u00a0We each enjoyed a delicious meal, all sporting very different flavors and varieties. \u00a0I had the Chilean sea bass, my mom enjoyed the salmon, and boyfriend took it home with the pot pie. \u00a0Spectacular plates.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. \u00a0Cheers to the wonderful bartenders!"], ["Carol C.", "The only restaurant worth considering in the Belle Meade area.

I went there with a large group, and was supposed to have a set menu but a few of us went off piste and ordered appetizers. I'm so glad that we did. The beignets were lovely and creamy and the lobster and crab were seriously tasty. The fried oyster had been obliterated by the cooking process and was just a hard lump of batter. The chicken samosa was good. The entrees were not so good. The steak came with a weird sauce and no sides.

Apparently no one else in Nashville ever thinks to stop in for lunch! I have never had to wait for a seat, and the restaurant usually only has a few occupied tables. Makes it a fantastic place if you need something conducive for a conversation with clients or colleagues.

Female lead singer and female backup were both great. Again with the cover songs tho...Shimmied up to the bar. Ambiance is chic and dark... The crowd was a little off-putting, maybe a tad too snotty for my mingling taste. Angie the bartender was great tho and did me a huge favor by making me a slammin' espresso martini. I was on the road all day and badly needed caffeine to perk up. Espresso martinis, when done properly are probably one of my favorite things in life. I don't usually order them tho because being a bartender myself I know what a bitch they are to make. She glady obliged my request and it was delish!My bf got a fancy $12 beer and then had major martini envy when he saw/tried mine.

He was very laid back and knowledgable in the best possible way.The food was very good but the difference in portion sizes between the flat iron steak and the salmon was kind of odd. The band playing the night we were there was unreal! A lady named sissy was singing with them but I can't recall what the band's name was. The only other thing I found odd was the fact that a restaurant this nice has paper dinner menus. Overall, great experience!"], ["Tiffany B.", "Really really good service and a very attentive waiter. On the weekends (Friday and Saturday) they have a live band. When I went it was Al Green and the hard times. Lol. They were really in good though and had the whole crowd enjoying themselves.If you don't want to be close to the music there are quieter areas or a patio outside. The place is really nice. The drinks are on the more expensive side but totally worth every penny. They don't cheat you on your alcohol and they have really taken their time to come up with a creative and satisfying drink menu. Food was great. They serve small plates and larger meals.

Sadly, they said they were booked at the time we needed. So I made a reservation for a different place. The other place fell through so a friend called Sambuca and asked again, and this time they said they had availability! I was really frustrated by the fact that we had been given different information, but my elation at eating here overshadowed it. They were so helpful and accommodating. Some of the most friendly service I've had. The waitress talked with us for a good while and provided great recommendations. We were seated on the top floor on the terrace overlooking the city, and it was such a lovely view and a lovely night. They had little candles on the tables and all these couches around the room and really ambient lighting. There was live music in the level beneath us and people were dancing. It was just such a beautiful atmosphere, everyone was so happy.Prices are high, but the food was worth it. We all got different drinks (around 11 dollars each) - I got the Tennessee Tornado which packed a punch, and was so delicious. My friend and I split a pizza, the name evades me but I know it had goat cheese, italian sausage, and prosciutto. It was AMAZING. And it was only 15 dollars and provided a great meal for two. Many of the girls commented on how amazing the shrimp and crab bisque was, and I also heard the beignets were to die for. Overall, this place was top notch. Great location. Great food and drinks.

My husband and I decided to make a dinner reservation for one of our birthdays. We were blown away at how good the food was! My husband had a really amazing steak here.

It was a Monday night, so it was pretty dead. They did have some live music and a bit of an older crowd. I proceeded t grab a seat at the bar, and ordered a drink. They dont have any draft beers which was what I was wanting. Settled for a bottled beer and ordered the shrimp and crab in lemon butter sauce with linguine. The shrimp was very plump and flavorful. Was a little disappointed by the crab in it as it was more of a crab puree then actually getting crab meat. I told them light on the lemon butter sauce which is the way to go. Too much it may have been swimming in it since it is a very rich dish as it is. I wish they gave a little bread or maybe a side to go with it, but I think you have to pay for that. For the value I would say average, but thankfully the meal tasted pretty good. Barendar was nice, and they had TV's with some games on so that kept me occupied. If I go back may try someplace new, but if you are staying in the gulch this place isnt too bad."], ["Arshbir G.", "Went here on a Saturday evening around 7pm.

The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming; all of the staff I talked to were extremely friendly and seemed happy to be there. This being Nashville, you can always find someone singing/playing and this place is no exception; a singer with a nice selection of Christmas music. Parking is also ample and very easy to find; there are 2 pay parking lots 1 block away - I paid $2 for 2 hours - completely reasonable.

We ordered the bucca beignets, bruschetta, garlic cheese bread, caprese salad, and the house salad to start! All was very very good. The kids enjoyed is all as well. We asked Jordan about the pinot noir selection. He suggested a few but pushed one more so based on our palate. We tried 2 tastings both were good. We trusted our server and order the Meomi Pinot Noir he suggested. He nailed it. It was a delicious bottle! My husband also order a sweet tea, where Jordan told us they didn't have any but could bring some sweetener. A couple minutes pass and he returns with the iced tea and fresh made hot simple syrup! He went above and beyond to get us our sweet tea! He just set the tone for the rest of the night. We were quite stuffed from all our apps but shared the Miso Sea Bass (another suggestion from Jordan) It was Fantastic! I seriously don't know where we put all the food?!

A mixture of flavors you've never probably had, but will want again."], ["Chris K.", "FINALLY - a fine dining restaurant that has just the right ambiance! \u00a0We walked into this hip restaurant, and immediately felt at ease. \u00a0Classy, yet relaxed, decor; Miles Davis playing in the background, waiters and waitresses VERY accommodating and friendly - all fine dining restaurants should take note...waiters and waitresses that SMILE add immensely to a positive dining experience. \u00a0Great job, staff!Now the food - EXCEPTIONAL...really interesting dishes - roasted cauliflower IS THE BOMB. \u00a0Do not miss this appetizer if you are visiting for the first time. \u00a0I know cauliflower isn't the most sexy vegetable these days, but this dish is proof that it's making an amazing come-back! \u00a0The savory and sweet purees pair beautifully to your spectrum of taste buds; the almonds heighten the naturally \"nutty\" taste of the delightfully browned / roasted cauliflower. \u00a0We also had the catfish and coconut chicken curry. \u00a0Catfish was wonderfully crispy, with just the right amount of acid in the salad, sweetness in the strawberry preserve, tartness in the lime crema.The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the coconut chicken curry with quinoa was unfortunately overcooked. \u00a0Some chicken pieces were dry, while others were barely over cooked. \u00a0The sauce was not as sweet and savory as I expected, but I also come from a Thai background, and it likely was not meant replicate Thai cuisine, but be an American twist on an asian dish.Overall - I will CERTAINLY be back - wonderful service, great food, great environment. \u00a0Well done Etch - keep up the positive vibe!"], ["Jennifer R.", "Food is great, but the atmosphere is a bit pretentious. \u00a0I'll probably go again just for the Cauliflower."], ["Louis C.", "Service, food, and drinks were all fantastic. My entire family loved their meal and we were all impressed with the service. Not mention, it was the best old fashioned I've ever had."], ["Deezy P.", "Wow! The food was amazing and so unique . You really can't go wrong with any dish on the menu. Our waiter Mathew was friendly and easy to talk to and very knowledgable about the menu. it was a great experience ! Even the Chef came to talk to us, she was hilarious !!! Highly recommended !!!!!! (Also be on the look out for same celebrities , we saw Mick Jagger !!! )"], ["Robert M.", "Was there last year - ate at the bar. Had read the reviews on the cauliflower, so I tried it, despite the fact I hate cauliflower. The reviews are right - it was spectacular. Pork belly was delicious (hmmm....occurs to me only now that I could have just ordered another one...). The butter tasting was fine (but I should have just gotten another pork belly....) It was enjoyable experience."], ["Cait C.", "We had the cauliflower, beet salad, venison, colbia fish, and lemon tart for dessert. All of the dishes had a lot of interesting combinations and creativity, but sadly there's nothing that I would go back for a second time.I'm giving four stars for creativity and complex flavors. The dishes are contemporary and certainly spark conversation."], ["Jackie H.", "Everything was amazing but the cauliflower is a reoccurring dream!!"], ["Sonia C.", "Etch was memorable. \u00a0The name fits.We arrived early, a good habit that I am picking up (I'm not living up to my name)and the hostess sat us immediately. \u00a0I was not too pleased with the table, it was next to the window, but it was only two of us, so I really couldn't complain. \u00a0The decor was simple yet chic. \u00a0Very zen. Our waiter showed up immediately and introduced himself, and gave us time to look through the wine list. \u00a0We never felt rushed or forgotten. \u00a0We settled on a simple Spanish Syrah ( their wine prices are reasonable). After the presentation of the wine, the waiter went through the menu with us and answered all of our questions. \u00a0To me that is a plus when the wait staff knows the menu.The two appetizers were outstanding!The roasted cauliflower drizzled with truffleoil was amazing and it came with with crema that was blended with feta cheese that was indescribable. \u00a0The pork belly was seasoned and cooked to perfection.The Etch salad was good, but I could have gone for more cauliflower. \u00a0Now the entree, I had the fillet, med. rare, sitting on top of puree of potatoes, and dressed with peeled asparagus. \u00a0The fillet was so good, ate all of my steak and left the sides there. \u00a0Needed room for dessert.After much thought, we finally narrowed it down to the rhubarb and pecan tart. \u00a0One word - delicious. Great food, great service and great ambience."], ["Gabi M.", "As the name implies, my dinner at Etch from a few weeks ago will be \"etched\" in my memory for a really long time... it was fabulous!I was the oddball out being the only non-vegetarian / vegan in the group, so there were many more selections that appealed to me than to my colleagues -- hello -- can you say the entire menu is amazing? Despite our different food preferences, our party of three agreed on more than a few things:1 - Deb Paquette is one of the most talented chefs ever!2 - Etch provides an incredible dining experience with top notch service inside a lovely modern venue.3 - That cauliflower appetizer (even though we ordered it with everything on the side) is perfection.4 - Ratatouille Crudo - mine as it comes and theirs without the cheese - also incredible... I especially loved this mix of healthy and fresh zucchini, fennel, carrots, champignons, basil micro greens, garlic olive oil, eggplant salt, red bell tomato essence, parmesan. \u00a0(Seriously, I could make a meal on this alone!) \u00a0In addition to the above, I had a glass of wine and the scallop entree. \u00a0My veggie mates had the Katafi Pastry entree, slightly tweaked for their preferences. \u00a0We all were extremely content with our selections. \u00a0Unfortunately, with all of the aforementioned food, we had no room left for dessert. \u00a0Such a shame because the entire dessert menu sounded insane in a good way.I only hope for a return visit one day to experience Etch yet again... Thank you Marcia M for suggesting we eat here and for making the reservation. \u00a0For anyone that may be reading this review, if you can get a reservation, go for it. \u00a0I guarantee you will etch some fond memories of your meal there as well. \u00a0Enjoy!"], ["Carl D.", "Delicious! Roasted Cauliflower appetizer was amazing! Split the fillet, medium rare, and it came out to perfection. \u00a0Wasn't excited after reading the dessert menu, but got the truffle and added ice cream and was super pleased. Service was very professional and offered a lot of options to help us make selections.If ur in downtown Nashville, I definitely recommend Etch!"], ["Tarantula B.", "Made reservations, no wait time upon arrival. 1st timers, was with two others and we passed many open tables and were seated at the back of the restaurant,but with a window view. Nice clean eclectic restaurant, our server was nice and very helpful. Nice wine selection. The Ciopino appetizer was very good and can be shared with others. The from the sea creation for us was Halibut, we were told they ran out of the other fish and only two Halibut plates were left. Another guest tried the Cobia and truly enjoyed it. We and others around us wanted to end the evening with the Peach tort but were advised they were all out - no dessert review. Overall enjoyed the experience the food was good and would return. \u00a0Curious on where we will be seated next time."], ["David D.", "Fantastic restaurant with very clean, healthy food in a modern, yet warm space. \u00a0Salads are outstanding and very inventive without being overbearing. I found the service pleasant and since I sat at the chef's counter I was able to watch the meticulous attention to detail in prep, cooking, and especially presentation. They are more than happy to stray off the beaten path should you have any special requests and as a final tip try the coffee. \u00a0It's great."], ["Joi B.", "Exquisite.To the casual observer, Etch is not at all a vegan restaurant. The menu boasts such meaterific dishes as pork tenderloin, venison and steak filet rubbed with smoked duck butter, yet there are vegetarian options, all involving cheese and/or butter. All it took was a simple (not-so-simple, really, but she made it seem simple) request to our waitress to \"veganize\" the salads and vegetarian entree some dishes and voila, we received some of the best vegan food I've ever had! So before I get into the food, I need to give major props for the service. I appreciate that although dinner reservations are hard to come by at Etch, they do make every guest feel like they matter and service is impressive: friendly, polite and approachable. Sometimes trendy places like this one make you feel like you're lucky to be there, you know?Now that that's out of the way.The food:All three of us couldn't pass up that Ratatouille Crudo, so we each ordered our own. And we each devoured it! If you want this salad vegan, just get them to leave off the parm. A delectable tower of raw zucchini, carrots, micro greens, fennel and mushrooms marinated in greatness. It's the perfect light app to get you ready for what is sure to be an outstanding entree to follow. The Katafi pastry. INSANE. I keep looking at my photo and I am not lying when I say that my mouth actually waters with the sight and memory of this fantastic entree. They made this to order for us, leaving out the Fontina cheese. Although I admittedly do think a fine cheese can only make a dish more delicious, I can't imagine that it's necessary here. I believe the vegetarian dish changes according to season, so I'm not sure if the vegetables are going to be the same for you, but last week's dish included a pile of kale, a whole grain and a charred tomato. On top of this lovely arrangement is a bird's nest of phyllo. And there's three different bits of purees (olive? carrot? beet? Some combination thereof that tasted incredible) that compliment everything beautifully. I want some more immediately... only, I won't be back to Nashville for a month.Bravo, Etch. You win the best meal I've had all month award!"], ["Jim H.", "Great place, if you are looking for a break from the drone of steak, fried stuff, barbecue, and the other mundane choices of Broadway. \u00a0Sit at the chefs bar if you are solo and watch the food come out over a glass of wine."], ["Umber A.", "This place has to be the best restaurant I have ever been to. Each bite was a foodgasm. I'm a carnivore however somehow the waiter convinced me to try out their vegetarian options. I ended up getting the roasted cauliflower for app. The combo of goat cheese/ red sauce/ pea sauce was perfection. For my entree I got the rutabaga La Plancha. Very flavorful. I literally scraped the plate clean. \u00a0Can't wait to go back. And the waiter was friendly and helpful! Service was excellent !"], ["Kimberly F.", "I've been wanting to try Etch since they first opened and finally was able to yesterday and we were not disappointed actually quite amazed. We split the beet salad which was delightful. Next I had the grilled lamb loin which is smack yo mama good and my beau had the grilled filet which was equally yummy. We will definitely be back real soon."], ["Ann E.", "Unfortunately, I was not overly impressed with the food here , which I had hoped to be based on other reviews. \u00a0The atmosphere was nice and service was very good. The roasted cauliflower app was very bland, was literally just cauliflower , roasted. The 2 side sauces they had on the platter to accompany it were good. \u00a0I ordered the catfish as my entree and i found it to be underseasoned. It was actually cooked very nicely, but could have been much better with more flavor in the batter. \u00a0Maybe it was the dishes I ordered in particular; I would be willing to go back and try something else. But for this lunch experience, I was disappointed."]], "Flyte World Dining & Wine": [], "Panaderia La Conchita": [["Mike D.", "Oh my... what a heavenly find this place was! \u00a0If you have any doubt about the authenticity of this bakery, then just look up at the ceiling where you will find dozens of pinatas hanging waiting to be brought home to be filled and beaten apart. \u00a0There must have been at least ten little children looking up at the pinatas and pointing as they begged and pleaded with their parents. \u00a0I can only imagine how much fun it would be to come in here with a blindfold and a stick and randomly swing that stick in the air repeatedly until I received a shower of candy!Anyway, I digress... they have a huge variety that includes tres leches, custard-filled delights, coconut encrusted pieces of heaven on earth, and even a few different varieties of donuts! \u00a0You should try them all :)My only knock is that none of the products have a description or tag of any sort to let you know what they are. \u00a0Time to go polish up on my knowledge of latin pastries..."], ["Billy H.", "This place is a true local bakery. I honestly had no idea this place was over here, which is surprising to me because I used to frequent the K&S Market that is the same strip mall. Anyway, this place was pretty busy when we stopped by around 4pm on a Sunday. I think that we were the only non hispanic customers in the store. The bakery is set up pretty straight forward. When you walk inside, the left side has drinks and refrigerated pies and cakes, on the right side is all the different pastries in glass, self serve cabinets. You grab a tray and tongs and pick out what you want. The trays are the same you get at a fast food restaurant that usually have the white paper liner. These trays don't have liners, I guess they clean them, but I wished they had some kind of parchment paper to put the items on instead of directly on the tray. There is a huge selections of conchas, Mexican sweet breads, churros, oreja, and pan de colotes. I didn't know these names until I googled for them. They don't have any names or prices listed at the cabinet area. They don't even have prices listed up at the front counter. We picked 5 different items and the total after tax was $4.46. Not bad at all. The guy that bagged our stuff was nice, the guy that rung us up was on his phone and didn't say the total or the change or anything. Of the 5 items we got, my favorite was the concha. I also liked the one item that looks like a triangle hot pocket that is filled with cream cheese (i think). The large round one with the strips was a little dry, but for the price I think that all of them were worth it. I will be back."], ["Joe C.", "This place is the real deal. So many delicious treats for an amazing price. We had a nice sampling of bread, cookies and pastry, and everything was fantastic. The birthday cakes look really good, and I'm definitely trying the tres leches cake next visit."], ["Jack L.", "My love of Latin American food and culture brought me to this little panaderia of heaven. I grabbed one of the trays near the register and a pair of tongs, then went around to all the cases and picked out what I wanted. A selection of empanadas, sweet bread, gingerbread pigs, and Tres Leche made it into my bag. Six items for $7.23, practically nothing. I asked for spoons right away to eat the Tres Leche and the wonderful woman behind the counter seemed to appreciate that I asked in Spanish, although it was not necessary. Great vibes and a market atmosphere."], ["Nurse Foodie B.", "Happy, Happy to find awesome Tres Leches Cake! Plus, an awesome bakery loaded with homemade pastries. \u00a0Reminds me of home. This California girl is elated that Nashville has a pandaderia!"], ["Laura B.", "Sweet empanadas filled with cream cheese or pineapple. Tres Leches Cake. Those little gingerbread pigs. Conchas, ojo de buey, elephant ears, and other pan dulce galore. Not to mention the little freezer filled with mexican style popsicles (paletas) and ice creams. If this is what you're looking for, go here. If you don't recognize anything from the above list, stop by this little bakery and pick up a bag full of sweets instead of picking up a dozen donuts, you'll make new discoveries and be the hero at work. La Conchita bakery is located in the same parking lot as the infamous K & S Grocery on Nolensville Road. When Panaderia La Abejita closed down in this spot awhile ago, I wanted to cry. When La Conchita opened about a year ago, I wanted to throw a party.The place is clean, neat, and generally friendly. It is definitely a family run business (complete with the occasional awkward teenager), they are very welcoming in both English and Spanish. They also have very reasonable prices (all the different items are about 60-90 cents a piece, and their Tres Leches Cakes are sold by the slice, or a whole cake for less than $20). They also seem good about seasonal items like pan de muerto around Dia de los Muertos, I think they sell Roscon around Three Kings Day. Although there are many hispanic style bakeries on Nolensville road selling Tres Leches and these other sweets, this one is my favorite and gets 5 stars for the friendly clean atmosphere, the prices (especially on the Tres Leches Cakes) and the fact that they have the best darn cream-cheese empanada de mil hoja that I have ever tasted, ever (and believe me, I've been around many panaderias). Those things come out from the back hot, flaky, and delicious and everyone I know that has tried one can't stop talking about them."], ["Eric S.", "I always check out the local panaderia whenever I travel and my son, daughter, and I checked out this one.

Never saw it before , genius idea . I got a burrito and my other half got a quesadilla . Both come with side of chips and we ordered a side of cheese to go with them as well . Food was made to order and fresh . You can tell they use fresh ingredients everyday , or at least quality check things they keep from day to day.
