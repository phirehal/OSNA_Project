The meal is always consistently delicious, and the wine selection is superb. I love sitting outside on their fantastic balcony in the cooler months! I regularly get the pizza, always fab, and enjoy the spiedini as a pre-meal treat (try it, you'll love it!!)"], ["Dax E.", "Great place. Gotta go! Food is locally sourced and high quality. Great tasting dinner options. Haven't eaten there for lunch. Predominantly Italian foods. Pizza is great and prepared in a wood fired oven. Reclaimed wood and cozy atmosphere. My wife and I looked into having our rehearsal dinner here and they are ready for those events but we ended up going with another. Great people. Great service. Good outdoor seating for fall and spring. Parking can be challenging on busy weekends. Great brunch. The cream donuts are amazing. Can't get them anywhere else in Nashville. Awesome mimosas and Bloody Mary bar. Beer selection is small but has good variety. Dessert options are few but pretty good. If you're looking for a place to go when other places are packed with long waits, this is a perfect back up. We no longer go to those places and just move straight here. Small waits when there happens to be. Definitely worth the extra drive into east Nashville. Our guests and we are always pleased."], ["Rachel G.", "I thought it was pretty subpar Italian food, especially for a foodie city. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Or that is what I'd like to believe. Started with some olives and fried mozzarella. The olives were olives. Pretty hard to mess up. The mozzarella was lacking. For my entree I had some butternut squash and lemon pasta and it was really hard to taste anything butternutty about it, which was disappointing. The atmosphere was fine - not too crazy for a Saturday night and the service was attentive. Not sure I'd make it a point to go back."], ["Oluchi N.", "Checked out Pomodoro East for Burger Week with a friend. I'd never been here before and, to be honest, I'd never had an interest in going here for anything. I don't really get excited about Italian food...Anyhow, we came during their happy hour and I ordered a martini that tasted like a mix between a lemon drop and a mojito. Yum! It was a little sweet, even for someone with an insane sweet tooth like me, but it was delicious! Next came the main event: their Italian Burger. I don't even know where to start. It was phenomenal!!! Granted I had low expectations from the jump, but it was probably the best burger I've had in a very long time. Such a pleasant surprise! Here's a description in case you're curious:\"Beef burger served on a brioche bun with sun-dried tomato mustard, red onion jam (freaking amazing), Caesar dressed romaine, provolone cheese and fennel pickles, served with rosemary Parmesan fries.\" @_@ It was soooo good! Who knew an Italian place could do burgers so well?! If they find a way to bring this onto the menu for keeps, I'll definitely be at Pomodoro East way more often. The staff was really friendly too! Unfortunately I've had too many run-ins with rude and blas\u00e9 East Nasty servers, so I was expecting that again. But our host and waitress were great. All together, the food, drinks, and people left me with a great impression of Pomodoro East."], ["Angela M.", "Never had a bad experience here and beg several times, both by myself and with friends. First time I came for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised by both food and drink being $5, and delicious! Dinner is yummy and today I came for brunch and was greated with a different menu: blueberry hazelnut bread pudding with tripled Berry whiskey sauce, tiramisu waffle, Tuscan donuts filled with tiramisu cream, meatball Benedict and what I got: prosciutto omelet. There were so many other good looking things on the menu \u00a0(and it wasn't packed at noon) that I'm already planning when I will be back to try the other things. By the way, the ambiance is great and the outside patio is delightful as well, in a peaceful part of town."], ["Andrea R.", "Very clean and nice atmosphere. The main dining room was a little close set due to several large groups, so when being seated, we asked for a table a little farther away from a large group and the hostess told us they were all \"reserved.\" I wasn't surprised to find that 1.5 hours later, one of the three requested tables was...still available. Nice attempt to appear exclusive - I'll conform and make resos next time I come to Hipsterville. \u00a0Anyway, we had the ahi tuna Caesar salad entree, the chicken Parm, and the tiramisu, and they were all very good. \u00a0The Caesar was the best. There aren't a lot of selections on the menu and not very many traditional Italian dishes, but I don't think you'll have a problem finding something you'll like."], ["Lauren T.", "I had been wanting to try Pomodoro East for a while, so maybe my anticipation had just heightened my expectations. It was ok, nothing too special. I ate pizza and the olives appetizer. I was disappointed that the olives didn't come with any focaccia bread. I assumed it was a norm to serve breads with olives. The pizza was pretty good. My group didn't love anything too much, which is why it was merely an A-OK experience."], ["Cvcvc C.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to try their brunch, and drove all the way down from Clarksville! We were so excited to try their menu. We had a reservation at 11:30 and showed up a little early, but we were seated right away. We both ordered the tiramisu waffle because that was what we based our decision on to come to PE for food. After we ordered, our server informed us they \"ran out\" of the tiramisu waffles. WHAT!?!?!! Does that mean they're frozen waffles? Bleh. We replaced our orders with other items which were delicious, but we were just kind of confused and disappointed.

Since I came for happy hour, we weren't served the cornbread which is fine. When you come, make sure you sit in front of the kitchen, is practically an open area for the most part. I would say the best part about it is that the aroma is one you can't recreate... It just smells soooooooooo good. Everything looks great. Some of the walls are wood panel, brick, or ton... It just depends on where you sit. The decor of great!! Ambiance, atmosphere, libations, and food... All great. That happy hour menu, you don't want to miss it.

We ended up going here on a Wednesday night, it was empty. The waiters and chef were standing around the bar and talking - which is fine when it was slow, but our food came out not tasting well so you think the chef would care more. The service was very nice though, very kind and tried to fix problems. We ordered an appetizer and received bread and fried calamari - both were good, not amazing. I ordered homemade pasta with meat sauce and my husband ordered the steak. His was overcooked and mine was horribly bland. I said the sauce had no flavor and really wasnt seasoned well nor had flavor. They said their sauce isnt different than the typical type of bolognese and some people dont like it. I ended up sending both our entrees back and decided to leave. They brought us out a dessert as an apology- which was really good, and a kind gesture- but I wouldnt go back."], ["Kevin P.", "I have never bothered to write a yelp review before but this place was worth it. Food was out of this world delicious. The dishes were creative and upscale. Our server was of course attentive and knowledgable.

Very impressed and we will return."], ["Jessica M.", "My mom and I went here last night and I think this place is the best Italian I've had in Nashville. \u00a0Nice ambience, very good food (the shrimp piccata pasta was amazing), good service. \u00a0I also liked the very creative menu."], ["Chad P.", "This is a great Italian spot located on Porter and the corner of Eastland.

The service is very friendly and able to point you in the right direction. Happy Hour has some great deals ($5 drinks and apps). I recommend the steak and spaghetti, its definitely restaurant quality spaghetti, I have never had spaghetti was such flavor. The steak was great, cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.

Everything was great! Berry salad, pig and fig pizza, flank steak, and sorbet to top it off.

We had a 7:15pm reservation and the hostess and everyone were very bubbly and quickly found a table for us. Our server was very busy but never once neglected us and made some great food recommendations. I can't remember everything we ordered or the specific names but the Speidini (sp?), onion rings/straws and Trout were exceptional. The pesto chicken pizza was a disappointment but we didn't complain. The server noticed my wife hadn't finished the pizza and comp'd it from our bill. After 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, one side and 4 drinks, we walked out for $75 before tip. Not bad at all. If you haven't tried Pomodoro East, do yourself a favor and make a reservation. We will be back very soon!"], ["Eric B.", "This restaurant is inconsistent at best. \u00a0They have a nice patio, but it's somewhat spoiled by proximity to a busy road. \u00a0Both the food and service are inconsistent: sometimes things are really good, but sometimes they're pretty bad. \u00a0On the plus side, they're open on Sunday evenings when a lot of east Nashville is closed."], ["Russell M.", "Super cool place, inside is awesome looking and the patio is nice. Food was great, we had the hummus, crunchy trout, \u00a0and salmon pizza. Lucky for me my girlfriend and I share. I live close to this place and I'll definitely be back. So if the experience was great why the missing star you ask? We stood at the door and nobody waited on us. We ended up awkwardly going over to the bar.

We sat at the bar and I had a fancy cocktail with gin, fresh juice, and muddled mint, it was incredible! Later I had a glass of the house wine, which was a very fair price for the quality (only $7, and it was a fantastic wine). The chicken and wild mushroom pizza was the best pizza I've ever had, it was full of intense flavors! They make the dough fresh, it's a hand-tossed thin crust pizza. We also tried the potato filled ravioli with lump crawfish meat and lemon sauce. Oh my goodness! It's hard to describe how delicious it was. Everything that isn't from the sea is local, raised appropriately (ie, grass fed beef, free range chicken, local veggies, etc.). So not only are you getting delicious food, it's healthy and conscientious! Oh and I almost forgot to mention, the decor is very tasteful, lots of wood beams. There is an outdoor patio as well. This would be a fantastic place to take a date, or even a large group (there is a giant table for big parties)."], ["Stefanie P.", "Went to Pomodoro East with 2 friends. We weren't sure what bottle of wine we could all agree on so the waitress gave us a few samples to pass around (very cool) and we started with that. We all got something a little different. I got a pizza that was $8-$9 and good. The cheese you could taste was super fresh but the flat bread was plain and simple. My friend got the mahi mahi that had great presentation, and she said was pretty good, and my other friend got a pasta dish half size order (you can get full or half size) the half size seemed like a true real 1 portion of pasta. We got some bread and olive oil pre meal we all scarfed down. It has an open kitchen. Real table clothes and napkins but the prices aren't that steep but I'd also say the food isn't worth more than its priced at. If you're looking for an affordable a bit nicer Italian restaurant this is it, but this isn't a place to propose to your girlfirend. A nice casual restaurant but by no means was anyone dressed up. The staff was nice but seemed a bit 'green' but could just be in part of the 'new restaurant' kinks. I'd likely go back for a weeknight dinner. I recommend making reservations as this place is pretty popular because its new. My favorite out of everything I sampled was my pizza! Hooray for local business!"], ["Jessy Y.", "The interior of this space is almost unrecognizable to anyone who frequented the former Cooper's on Porter. Gone is the wall behind the bar, which now opens to show inside the kitchen. The weird booths in the middle that segmented the restaurant have been replaced by two brick columns, which gives it a much more open feel. We sat in the back, where an open garage door overlooks the patio, allowing in the fresh air while still keeping us out the rain.Their menu design needs a little work, but they have an impressive wine list, though more bottles than by the glass, and several beers in bottles, though only two drafts. We didn't get an appetizer, though they had a nice selection plus a special not on the menu. Instead, we split a Caesar salad. The dressing was really light despite coating the lettuce entirely, but could have used a little extra oomph. The croutons were made from the same bread we were served with olive oil -- nice and garlicky.Speaking of garlic, let's get to the entrees. I ordered the half portion of the potato-suffed ravioli with crawfish tails, butter and lemon. Very flavorful, with a nice garlic-laden broth of some sort as a sauce. The crawfish tails were huge, very shrimplike for what I'm used to (I'm from around here, so growing up I ate my share of \"crawdaddies\" that didn't resemble these at all), and the potato filling in the ravioli was basically creamy mashed potatoes -- smoother than the consistency of the usual ricotta. The ravioli was slightly undercooked on the edges, but I still inhaled it. And a great deal for only $9 ($17 for a full portion).He tried the pizza with lamb sausage, fennel, tomatoes and arugula. Not too crusty, but not cracker-thin (we both prefer a crust on the thinner side), and generous with the toppings, though a little skimpy on the sauce, but that may be their style. No complaints -- and at $11, a decent deal for gourmet pizza.We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night and were sat immediately, though probably just in the nick of time, since there was a huge line out the door when we left. As far as service goes (since I've seen complaints), our drinks took a while to arrive, but our server was very apologetic. And at least two other people (owners?) stopped by during the course of our meal to ask how everything was -- I imagine they just want to make a good first impression, which they certainly did. When our food didn't arrive as soon as she had promised, our server offered to buy us a second round of drinks, even though we weren't complaining. And then our food arrived immediately after that. So ... free drinks for not-really-that-slow service? I'll definitely be back.Although to second another reviewer... where was the hostess stand? And more importantly, this place needs a website, or at the very least a Facebook page. I know it's owned by the same folks who run Eastland Cafe, so I figure they are just trying to do a soft opening for a few weeks before they start heavy promotions, but if it weren't for a food blogger posting about them, I wouldn't have known they were open."], ["Melissa B.", "I'll rate this a 2 only because the drinks were well crafted. Other than that, I can't really say much else was good. I ordered a salad that was never made. The manager didn't seem accommodating.

I had yet to find an Italian place in all of Nashville that I really liked, and now I have this amazing place blocks from my house. The inside has been redone and is much lighter and brighter. I sat at the bar, which has an excellent view of the brick oven and the kitchen. The bartender, Quentin, was fantastic. My water was never less than half full and he was just prompt and attentive with my entire meal. The gnocchi starter is hands down the most delicious gnocchi to be found in these parts. \u00a0The house salad is a nice blend of raddichio and greens with roasted red peppers, onions and olives. Perfectly dressed and seasoned. The bread is fresh and served with flavorful olive oil (I kind of wanted to order a glass of it, neat). I had the crab ravioli as an entree; it was tasty but a bit on the salty side, which is right up my alley, but if you're watching sodium, you may want to skip it. I guilt-ordered my working-late hubby the pork to go and he loved it. Perfectly cooked at medium, excellent flavor and well-complemented with a square of polenta. Nice selection of wines by the glass and the housemade limoncello was the perfect cap to the my meal. If you decide to check this place out, you'll probably see me at the bar. I have a feeling I'm going to be quite the Norm at this place. Kid-friendly too."], ["Amy C.", "Great FOOD, Great Patio and an even BETTER Happy Hour! From the Eastland Cafe family of restaurants, Pomodoro East does not disappoint! I have found a new \"regular\" spot for me and my husband to unwind after a long day st work!"], ["Grace G.", "Let's see. Their background music seemed to be a Kings of Leon Pandora station -- every third song was KoL. The oil/vinegar dip tasted like NyQuil. The Crespelle (crepes) arrived on a very hot plate, but were cold throughout. Veggie lasagna was good, but not amazing. \u00a0The most positive thing I can say was our server was good. I doubt we will ever have a desire to try this place again. I wonder what restaurant will be in this spot by next year?"], ["Wm Z.", "This was our first visit. \u00a0After tasting hors d'oeuvres from Pomodoro East at IL CARNIVALE, my partner decided that this was where he wanted his to have his birthday party. I made the reservations 3 weeks in advance for a party of 14, and called an hour prior to notify them of last minute changes to the guest list reducing out party to 12. I also asked if it would be okay to bring a birthday cake and was told that would be fine. \u00a0They were gracious enough to call me back immediately to let me know about the $1 per person cake fee. I have to admit this was a new one for me, but after a bit of research, I discovered that although most American dining customers think a cake fee is ridiculous, its now a very common practice \u00a0across the country, and has made its way to Nashville. \u00a0As for the cost of $1 per person, that appears to be a bargain compared to elsewhere in the nation, where the going rate is $1.50 to $2.50. Take your bargains where you can. That's the last one you get at Pomodoro East.Although the table tops are spacious and comfortable, its negated by so many of them being in such a small space. We were seated in what seemed like the front doorway and, as the night progressed, became packed in like livestock in a cattle car. The bar was 3 feet behind my chair, and I was bumped and had to move many times throughout the evening, I also could not get comfortable because the location of the table legs required me to keep my feet to the side of my chair.Their beer and wine prices are ridiculously high for the selection. \u00a0I tried to find a more polite way to phrase it, but there is no getting around it. I also observed that those among our party that ordered wine by the bottle received better drinks service than those of us who had ordered glass of wine and then switched to water. Refills were slow to say the least. \u00a0Actually, all service was slow, but we debated on whether that was because of the servers themselves or because of the shortage in floor staff. We had two very friendly servers for our party, but they also waited on other tables with large parties, and it seemed that one didn't know what the other had done. They attempted to take our orders twice. \u00a0It would been better to have had one dedicated server that we could have more easily found throughout the evening.All of the appetizers were unbelievably tasty, but do not order one as your main course unless you ate just prior to arrival. It is truly an appetizer portion. The two people who ordered appetizers as their meal, added a side once they saw the size of the appetizers when they arrived. The salads were also very good, but the FRIED GOAT CHEESE SALAD is really a misnomer. \u00a0There was minimal goat cheese.After the main course, it was the \u00a0table consensus that the food is some of the best we've ever tasted. If only, everything else had been so nice.At precisely the Two Hour mark, it became apparent that they were wondering how quickly we were going to vacate, although one member of the party was still in the middle of her meal because of a kitchen mix-up.When the bills came, they had charged the cake fee. Although I knew about it in advance and asked that the fee for everyone be charged to my tab, the server had no prior knowledge of any such fee, so I'm guessing we may have been the first. The most asinine part of the visit was saved for last: the 20% gratuity added. \u00a0Everyone's jaws dropped! After the lackluster service, I can assure that not another penny was added at my end of the table.As friendly as the staff is, and as amazing as the food tastes, the balance of the visit was mediocre at best.I feel it necessary to reiterate that it was some of the BEST FOOD we have EVER eaten!"], ["Darren L.", "Not my kind of place.Service was not bad but definitely a little preoccupied with getting ready for something or someone else....even though there was only 1 other table occupied in the place at the time.No thanks."], ["Ora B.", "I ate at Pomodoro East for the first time with a friend visiting from Philly. It was recommended by a co-worker and I had been wanting to check it out. It wasn't busy when we arrived which is rare for East Nashville restaurants. We decided to come also because it was $20 bottle of wine night (no brainer). We had a nice server and ordered a bottle of wine and the Spiedini for an appetizer. It was delicious. Then we both ended up ordering the Bolognese. It was ok. Not the best I've had. The pasta was tasty but the sauce was just ok. I was looking for something more because the waitress had said it was one of her favorites. I'll go back, but will order something else. I liked the atmosphere and the appetizer and of course the wine special. I'd like to try dessert next time. I'll probably come for the happy hour menu next time or either the brunch, it sounded interesting."], ["Hannah C.", "Definitely didn't live up to the hype or execute their ambitious menu with any real flair. Service was average, a little awkward and crowded floor. Cocktails were ok, and came after sitting on the bar a little too long, with melted ice and poor blending.They seated us at a table barely big enough for two with our 5th person sitting in the serving aisle even though we had reservations. My chair rubbed against the persons behind me all night and couldn't get out to use bathroom without climbing over people.Food was lukewarm in spots, literally as well as metaphorically, my ossobuco was actually cold in spots. The salads were well done and the cheese good but portion far too small for the money. Wine list is excellent and reasonably limited.Bar service was great and friendly, and appetizers were good but not very imaginative.The panna cotta was a gelatine loaded milk product, not the velvety semi firm creation it can be. The chocolate pave was a little dry and average side sauces. Nothing special."], ["Sean S.", "Last night we had dinner at Pomodoro East after hearing mixed reviews from our friends. The hostess said they had reservations coming in, so we could choose to sit at the bar. One of the first things I noticed were the beer prices. They are the highest I've seen in Nashville! Some examples: $7 for a draught Blackstone or Fat Bottom and $5 Yuengling bottles. We opted for water.For dinner my wife and I ordered pizzas. The pizza prices are reasonable and I'm a big fan of wood oven pizza, especially Bella Nashville in the Farmer's Market (YUM!). I had the pork and fennel sausage, and my wife had the corn puree. Both were too heavy on the cheese and it really dominated the dish. Both were just \"meh\"For dessert, we ordered the bombolini. The donuts were fine, but the dough was a bit dense for my liking. I didn't care for the vanilla gelato, it was very icy, but the lemon curd was good. There just wasn't enough of it!We had an ok time, and ok food. We'll probably come back for happy hour in the future (we live just down the street) but I don't have much desire to come back for dinner. It's just not worth the cost.On a side note, the bartender was great! She was very friendly and attentive and didn't treat us differently because we didn't order drinks. She gets 5 stars."]], "Margot Cafe & Bar": [["Kimberly S.", "This place is amazing, but I always seem to forget about it as an option. I really need to change that. The ambiance is superb, and you feel like you've actually been transported to a small French bistro. The place is straight up cozy. Service is also always professional and smooth. As far as food goes, their menu changes daily to reflect what's available at the market. There are a few staples that stay on the menu such as their potato chips and olive oil blend. The potato chips are insanely light and crispy and served with a delicious, garlicky aioli. The olive oil blend with housemade focaccia does not sound like much but is also a must order.For entrees, I generally order one of their fish dishes or the homemade pasta dish. I've always been pleased with the quality of the fish and the pairings. And let's be honest, fresh made pasta never disappoints.I highly recommend trying Margot for your next date night or special occasion."], ["Abby P.", "My favorite restaurant in Nashville!!I have been here many times with my fianc\u00e9e and various friends from out of town. The menu is always changing but we have never ordered anything that was less than amazing. We always have their fresh focaccia which we love, and as non-drinkers we are obsessed with their unsweetened peach tea. They serve local beef and fresh fish which are both very tasty. The environment is nice but very comfortable, the service is on point. I can't say enough about this restaurant!"], ["Randolph R.", "Went there tonight with my wife and a good friend. We each had a different starter and entree. The food was excellent and the service was very good. I would have given this place a higher rating if the atmosphere would have been better. Do not go there in the summer time. The place was so hot, (we sat upstairs), that we were too miserable to eat much of our entrees. Our server was sweating so profusely his shirt was soaked through. We will try again in the Fall or Winter, but reading other reviews leads one to believe that this has been an issue here in the past."], ["Julann C.", "This place changes their menu daily and is so open to an amazing dinning experience. We so enjoyed the whole dinning experience. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."], ["Lindsey B.", "Wow. Just wow. Such a gem in Nashville! This is such an incredibly well-designed restaurant with amazing food and waitstaff. The owner was so kind and welcoming. The menu changes every day depending on the season and availability of items. Made with love! The dessert menu was incredible, too. Don't skip Margot's on your next trip to Nashville!"], ["Kent I.", "5 stars for the memories, but only 3.5 stars for the food. We loved returning here for our 10 year anniversary after eating here on our first date. Everything is much the same--cute, trendy, and eclectic with good food. But after living in places with better food than Nashville traditionally has had, we enjoyed, but were underwhelmed by the food. \u00a0And parking around there is pretty terrible. \u00a0But we really enjoyed the night and are thankful for the memories.

And at Margot, you can taste that freshness; nothing seems to be prepared ahead of time, but rather carefully crafted each day.I will admit that I have only been here for brunch; each visit was a magnificent journey of tasty euphoria (not to be over the top or anything). Back in the days of my gluten-eating glory, I would order the basket of pastries with brunch--for anyone who has not developed a severe reaction to gluten (and possibly even to those people), this is still a highly recommended course of action. The pastries are flaky, light, featuring an array of glazed, nutted, and fruited confections. The last time I visited Margot for brunch, I indulged in some sort of egg deliciousness--an omelet featuring a variety of seasonal vegetables and cheese. This also was prepared to my order, and tasted fresh, perfectly seasoned, and worth it. Though the menu may be a little pricey here, it is the kind of pricey where I always walk out going, \"Yeah. That was worth it.\""], ["Katherine R.", "Went here for brunch with a friend. \u00a0I'm not sure what our waiter was doing, but it took about 30 minutes for him to take our order. \u00a0(Came by our table four times before we ordered?? \u00a0Maybe it was because we got there at 11 when they opened.) \u00a0Took a while to bring the food out as well, which wasn't a huge deal since it was a lazy Sunday. \u00a0But, hers came out steaming hot while mine was lukewarm. \u00a0I had the steak, eggs, and fries; they were fine, not great. \u00a0On the plus side, I asked if they could do a spicy Bloody Mary, and it was excellent! \u00a0I think if i lived in the neighborhood I would go back some because it is a really cute place, but I don't foresee myself driving across town for it."], ["Anthony S.", "Margot is situated in an up and coming neighborhood of East Nashville. If hipsters make you feel less of a person then it is worth the loss for a meal at Margot. Not only will you surely encounter a hipster or two but you may even have your food served by one. Its best if we comingle people! Margot is a restaurant which offers up a new menu each night for its patrons making the dining experience unique and fresh (which you can taste). If the following items are on your menu then I would highly recommend you order them. First, the homemade chips with aioli are to die for...seriously this combo should be considered culinary cheating its so good! Their assorted olives are wonderfully fresh and marinated. Next up, you should definitely order the roasted cauliflower with harissa - woah! I ordered the steelhead as my entr\u00e9e and its grilled flavor had me making sounds at the dinner table of a business meeting that I should have probably been more reserved about. Margot is a safe haven for anyone with taste buds. Trust me, you're gonna like everything about this joint."], ["Casey H.", "It's been over 2 years since my last visit to Margot's. We came here for brunch this past Sunday around noon and had a very short wait of 10 minutes. We sat in the screened in patio. It started to get pretty warm after an hour.We ordered the Bloody Mary with the cucumber infused vodka, sangria, steak and eggs and fried quail. Great:Bloody Mary $8- The Bloody Mary was fantastic and very well balanced! It was not overly salty, peppery or tomato-ey like most that I have had in Nashville. Additionally, it was garnished with a green olive and pickled green bean. I've never had a pickled green bean before and enjoyed it! Steak and Eggs $14 - Got the steak medium and eggs over easy. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The eggs had a nice crispy bottom and the yolks were runny and bright yellow. The fries were crispy and not greasy. Just wow!Fried Quail $10- The fried quail was fried and the meat was moist and tender. It was accompanied by a pickled watermelon and pepper salad. YUM... Okay:Sangria $8- I wasn't a fan of the sangria. I couldn't taste the wine... it was much more fruity and tasted more like grape juice.I can't wait to go back. :)"], ["Nick C.", "My lovely wife and I shared all of the dishes below:Starters - olives and the homemade chips1st course - tomato soup and shaved foie gras salad2nd course - veal and the clam and gulf black drum boullibaisseDesert - fig tart with honey walnuts and ice cream and a chocolate cakeEverything down to the homemade Rosemary sea salt focaccia bread was top notch. \u00a0I'll put this meal in the top ten. \u00a0Great job Margot!!!!The service was fantastic as well. \u00a0Chef Margot was greeting people as they came in and making visits to the tables.

I'd just eaten dinner across the street at Five Points Pizza when I was literally in the car about to drive home. I had a craving for a sweet tooth, so I turned to Yelp to see what options were available. I saw a picture of the goatcheesecake that someone else uploaded and I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately it wasn't meant to be. The place has a menu that changes pretty often. No worries! I ended up getting something chocolate and whipped cream on top. I also had a pear dessert (it had tartin in the name). My apologies for not getting the names right. Anyway, I devoured those dishes and would've licked the plates if it wasn't considered uncouth to do so. Oh yeah. They offer tea from High Garden!Most of the tables were taken due to reservations. There were open seats at the bar so we were seated there. No complaints here. The staff was really courteous. I really liked the atmosphere of the place. They were playing music that really played to it as well. It was noticeable but it wasn't overbearing or at all distracting. I will be returning with my girlfriend for a surprise date.Brian is a bartender here and I just want to mention him in this review because of his kind words and actions. Here's hoping he has a strong return from his leg injury."], ["Caroline K.", "After being quoted an hour-long wait for Sunday brunch at Marche Artisan Foods, we wandered over to Margot and were seated in a manner of minutes. I have no comparison on which to judge the 2, but we were more than happy with our selection! My friends and I were seated on the covered patio, which made us feel like we were dining al fresco yet still avoiding the outside chill. The table next to us was enjoying the most delicious looking sticky bun, so along with our huge french press of very tasty coffee and bloody marys we started with the breakfast pastry trio: sticky bun, coffee cake, and croissant. The croissant was not bad, but we all agreed the sticky bun and coffee cake were the real winners. Would definitely recommend if you have enoug people to share. As for our mains, my friends had a duck sloppy joe and quiche, and I had poached eggs and pork belly over grits. All I can say is that I would happily eat that every morning for breakfast. Absolute perfection and I practically licked my bowl clean. The other dishes also had high praises, but mine appeared to take the cake (or sticky bun in this case). Do not miss this dish if you see it on the menu!Overall we had a lovely brunch that couldn't even be ruined by the guy vomiting out of his car door as we walked in. Alas, delicious food and bloody marys really do make everything better!"], ["Susan H.", "Another trip to Margot and another amazing meal. \u00a0There are so many options in Nashville right now but this restaurant should be your first stop every time. \u00a0The service is beyond incredible and the food...delicious and so beautifully presented. \u00a0Out of all the incredible choices, this one is my favorite."], ["Christina W.", "I think working and dining at these types of restaurants so often has made me...dare I say....picky. Let's say...good taste. That makes me feel only slightly better. Came here for a birthday brunch. I had a mimosa (one with st Germaine) and a Bloody Mary. Both were good. Mimosas are pretty basic. I've had better bloodys. But it did its job. We shared the bread trio app to start. It was good. But neither it or my entree (which I forget and it lacks relevance because they change their menu) was impressive. Just ok. Service was good. And I enjoyed the aesthetic of the restaurant.

Expensive but worth it if you want to treat yourself. We had the fried eggplant appetizer, a steak and a pork belly dish. The steak was to die for."], ["Maggie H.", "This is place is really good!We came here directly from the airport and made it right before closing. I half expected them to turn us away since it was 15 to 10, but they happily sat us and did not rush us through our meal at all. I tried the quail, the skirt steak, and the goat cheese/mushroom/corn pasta. The quail was served over a bed of arugula with roasted peaches. So yummy. The steak was very tender as well, even though we ordered it medium. I would have to say the pasta was the weakest dish (kind of dry/needs more sauce?), but maybe I just need protein in my diet.We ended the meal with a slice of chocolate layer cake. While the cake looked super ordinary (I didn't even bother taking a foodie pic of it), it tasted SO AMAZING. Super moist, just the right amount of frosting and sweetness, gobble gobble.I don't know when the next time I'll be back in Tennessee, but I sure will miss this place.If you're lucky enough to live close by, don't pass this place up!"], ["Kristin Marie S.", "I always think Marche is the best, then I go to Margot and remember who started it.

How could I not? This joint is about as solid and consistent as it is humanly possible!On this go round, I joined a reservation of 6 for Dining Out For Life last night. My friend Cindy was the host for the night and noshing for a cause was a fabulous excuse to indulge. 50% of our bill would benefit Nashville CARES. I always appreciate business models that contribute back to their community and this generous participation level impressed me!On to the food...Why oh why do I lose all sensibility when it comes to portion control each and every damn time I order the house-made potato chips from here? I become a ravenous Wildebeast over this large bowl of perfectly crisp and flavorful chips. Due to my vegan diet, I don't dip it into the accompanying aioli sauce but from the looks of what was left of it... my friend Rachel certainly approved. Next, I communicated to the server that I was totally open to whatever the chef and kitchen would like to concoct for my vegan dish and was not disappointed when he suggested a vegetable penne pasta dish! He was informed enough to know that the other noodles that they had in stock contained egg so the penne was the right choice for me. Well done, mister. Well done!The pasta and veggies were perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor. And, how could I mention a feast at Margot without mentioning the wine list? I have literally never had bottle or glass here that I didn't absolutely adore. The 2 glasses of \u00a0Malbec ($9.50 a glass) that I enjoyed offered up a robust yet smooth experience. Margot is a cozy and comfortable spot for me where I run into friends and other people that I know each time that I am here. Whether you're looking for a romantic or special occasion dinner, casual night cap, or Sunday brunch, you won't be disappointed."], ["Shaneka L.", "Dined here 12/22/13, it's a hip intimate dining room with an open kitchen, I was sat immediately by the manager who set up my table, dressed it with menus before returning to greet awaiting guests.

So, it's that kind of night, I pulled out 41; Portrait of my father and started in on GHWB beginning his presidency, got to his visit in China before my server returned, offered recommendations, took my order and set off again. Had smoked salmon as a started, was amazing followed by beef \u00a0bourguignon, only several pieces of beef but still very good, my server came over as I worked my first bite into my mouth to ask how it was (haven't seen her since she took my order, another server brought and removed my starter and my entree), waited 10 more minutes after I finished my entree for my server to reappear. Finished my meal off with the Buche de Noel which was sublime, I placed my credit card on the table to speed the process along, as I signed the check my server asked what book I was reading, took a little more of an interest in her guest. I still over tipped because the food was great and it was understandably busy but my server never apologized for her delinquency between courses.

It is the most delicious and lovely brunch experience in Nashville. The menu is always fresh, locally sourced, and made in house. It's the ultimate Nashville restaurant for a romantic date night.

The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but not horrible either. Our table had a pimento cheese sandwich, pancakes, and I had a black bean breakfast dish. The food was fine, but my big complaint is the drink I had.They had an excellent brunch cocktail menu, and I typically go for the champagne drinks (hello mimosa and bellini!) but this time I went for a bloody mary and I wish I hadn't. I'm not sure if the mix was just off or if they didn't combine it properly, but I didn't finish it and everyone else at the table tasted it and it was off to them as well. It takes a lot for me to not drink a bloody mary, so let that stand alone. There were other people drinking them around me, so maybe it was just a fluke that mine was bad.That being said, I loved the atmopshere and I would definitely try it again for dinner to see how that compared to brunch. And next time I'm sticking with champagne!"], ["Mark S.", "It pains me to read some of the recent reviews about Margot's, has it changed recently? I don't recall ever doing a review on this restaurant so I shall now. I've eaten there several times - some strong suits: 1. The ambiance is great! Former gas station, bring guests here and they will love the feel of both the neighborhood and the restaurant. 2. Margot McCormick has an intuitive feel for both provincial and Italian cooking, she is also very welcoming when you meet her. 3. I always love the fried green tomatoes when available. 4. They are good at their house cocktails, I especially liked the cucumber-infused martini and the French Malbec wine (Malbecs didn't do too well over in France - one normally associates that grape variety with Argentinian wines.)One negative - I ordered a tri-tip steak beef entree once. It was cooked to perfection but was more chewy than the gum I got with Topps baseball cards. Later in 2012 I ordered a tri-tip from City House and it was cooked just as well and just as rubbery. Moral of the story - avoid tri-tip, not Margot's and City House! That having been said, both places should stop putting that cut on their menu, it's better suited for the rescue mission or international aid. Great for food cost but bad for customer satisfaction.Another thing that perplexes me - one review was pretty favorable but gave three stars. Doesn't the reviewer understand how much that rating hurts on the Yelp community? Try Margot's out, you'll be glad you did."], ["Queen B.", "I have returned from yet another birthday dinner at Margot's.. \u00a0This time I went with 3 other women that had never been to Margot's.each of us ordered an appetizer, a glass of wine and then an entree.whomever said that the venison was to die for was absolutely correct.My venison melted in my mouth.Salad for an appetizer, one person had the mussels, another person ordered the pizza.From appetizers to wine, to entrees to our waitress, Jordan, everything was absolutely perfect. Our waitress was courteous, helpful, kept our water glasses filled, kept empty dishes off the table, never interrupted our conversation.We sat outside on the porch with a bunch of heaters roasting us from above. It was actually quieter outside on the porch, than inside with all the other people.It's too bad that others say that it's too inconsistent to dine here.This was probably my 7th time dining here and I have yet to complain about service, food quality or presentation. \u00a0I did have a brunch meal here once and my meat entree was very small and I did complain about it, but since then, all entrees are nice American sized portions.All four of us were so full from dinner, none of us could fit dessert into our tummies.None of us had any complaints.It was a remarkable dinner with finesse.I highly recommend this eatery for special occasions, dates, friends family... \u00a0I don't think it would be a good place to bring children.It's more adult oriented.My venison was cooked to perfection, tender, tasty, MR, no gamey taste.. \u00a0It was truly exquisite. \u00a05 stars, hands down!"], ["Blair S.", "As I walk into Margot Cafe, the smell of spices, meats, and seafood that fill the air send my hunger level surging.

For the rest of us, the food is cooked to perfection every time. Perfect taste, perfect texture, perfect temperature, perfect freshness, perfect portions. Margot knows cooking in a restaurant is both an art and a science, and she's studied hard. I've never even a bad part of a meal here.Service is timely, helpful, and not overly intrusive. Drinks never go empty, yet those annoying, pointless half inch water refills never interrupt your meal. Dishes come out in the right order even if you have a large, high maintenance group.

Don't forget to make reservations well in advance on holiday weekends or in graduation season.Prices are high but not undeservedly and not astronomical.

Fresh and local wins me over every time.The salad we split was super fresh and flavorful featuring buttery lettuce and roasted beets. My friend ordered pork, which she said was divine, especially with the accompaniments. My grilled trout with kale and white beans was just ok. The beans and kale was my favorite part. The trout wasn't as flavorful and flaky ask I would've liked, but it was still good. A note about reservations: They are absolutely necessary to get a table here, but don't count on the reservation being honored on time. We arrived early for our reservation, and ended up waiting almost an hour to be seated. There were plenty others that waited quite a while for their reservation, as well. Overall, a quaint restaurant with a kitch-y feel and friendly and attentive service. While the food is good, nothing blew me away, but I appreciate the concept and, honestly, the execution is commendable."], ["Daniel S.", "I like Margot's food, but I don't love it. And for the price you are asked to pay, I would expect to love it. The ambiance is a little underwhelming but the service is very good."], ["Melanie K.", "Daily Rotating Menu = Daily Rotating Star Rating....I had the pleasure of attending this gem for a birthday celebration. Although we had a reservation we still ended up waiting another 15 minutes before our table was ready. I highly recommend that you make a reservation as this dining area is creative, but small. DRINKSOur group started at the bar and tried the Side Car and Pear Martini. I am a Side Car fanatic, but many restaurants have trouble executing this drink. However, both cocktails we received were smooth and flavorful. For dinner you can never go wrong sharing a Spanish Red, although Margot's offered an extensive list of Red, White, Blush, and Champagne.APPETIZERWe were very interested in the rotating menu that Margot's offered. The appetizers were not as elaborate as I expected and the cheese plate ended up being pretty simple and unoriginal, but the Dried Tomato jam was very delicious.ENTREEFor Dinner we shared the Gnocchi, the Venison, and the Flank Steak. The Gnocci was covered in an amazing tomato sauce, there could have been more sauteed vegetables, but the Gnocchi was perfectly light. The Flank Steak was flavorful and was served with great earthy mushrooms. Steak and Potato dishes are more like safety dishes for diners so it is hard to discuss anything more about the dish. Finally the Venison was AMAZING!! Not only did we even debate if this dish was truly deer,since there was not a single morsel of gamey taste, but it was served perfectly. My best friend and I immediately regretted getting the Flank Steak, but luckily her husband allowed a trade in entree dishes so her and I could devour the rest. If you ever see the Venison on the menu you must order it.DESSERTWe shared a chocolate cake dish that was very sweet and rich. It was plenty for the four of us to share after such a decadent meal.REASON THERE IS NO FIFTH STARYou know that adage that \"You can do a few things great but only many things well\"? Well.....Margot's does fit this bill. Although some of the dishes we had were standouts, most were not very memorable to other fine dining restaurants I have been too. Since the space is a gutted garage or home there is little insulation and it can be a little cold in the winter and it is loud all the time. I did love this dining experience and thought everything was very good, but only one dish stood out to me. I know Margot's is known for their daily rotating menu, but I would advise having a seasonal menu instead. With so many rotating dishes you can choose the standouts and consistently deliver a great meal experience."], ["Stephen G.", "Weekend in Nashville and too many choices of great new places to eat. \u00a0This restaurant had the reviews and strong comments from most every one we talked to, so it became our Saturday night out.The menu was simple and elegant, and what a treat to see Margot there in here restaurant overseeing it all. \u00a0Started with a goat cheese and toast points, then moved on to saffron mussels, and finished our appetizers with a great beet salad. \u00a0For entrees we had the house made linguini with squid, and the best meal of the evening, a grilled salmon.All of the food was wonderfully prepared and presented. \u00a0 Our waitress was also extremely well versed in the food she was serving which was impressive...... But somewhere along the ride I got the feeling our server just wanted to show her knowledge of food in general was much greater than anyone she could serve it to. \u00a0It was subtle, but turned what was a damn great dining experience into just a really good meal.I keep thinking what I may have done to bring this on (not wear shoes, order PBR in a can, or blow my nose in the linen napkin) but I just can figure it out.I would recommend this restaurant, and find the food quality very high. \u00a0It just proves again that the wait staff have a very significant influence on dining experience."], ["Cory C.", "What a great little place! I should start by saying our waitress was very knowledgeable of the drinks and menu she was able to answer every question we had and made great suggestions. I could tell she was a pro! The menu changes a lot which is a great idea you always have to try something new. After a long look at the amazing choices on the menu I decided on the duck breast which was prepared to perfection. Perfectly seared! I had a dream about it last night:) can't wait to get back and try something else. Do yourself a favor and come to Margot!"], ["Jon D.", "It's really merely decent. And as much as I dislike being the out-of-towner who doesn't quite appreciate the food ethic of the locale, the food was really a mere three-star experience on my palate. Margot does get the one star bump for a cozy ambiance and service which speaks volumes of homeyness, but the food did balance precariously towards the uninspired.But to begin with the highlights, the dining room is cozy. It feels like entering the kitchen which is open to the dining viewer with all of its hustle and bustle. The hosts are gracious and in particular, our server was very helpful and attentive in explaining to us the offerings of the eve. The potato chip appetizer came with a delightfully light garlicky aioli which was a fine opener. The soup of the day was a sweet potato bisque which was quite delightfully spiced with herbally infused oil, which added the slightest amount of bite to brighten the palate.The entrees were fomulaic and uninterested in execution. A protein, well cooked and seasoned, over a vegetable. The steak went with potatoes. The muscovy duck breast with brussels sprouts. The fish was accompanied by roasted squash. Yes, simplicity is sometimes king, and everything tasted pretty good. But in totality, it was boring. It was something that could have been home cooking. And I love home cooking, but color me uninterested for the evening.It was enjoyable, yes. There is a certain lovable quality about this place. For those looking to be satiated, a positive choice. But for those seeking inspiration? Perhaps seek elsewhere."], ["Erin H.", "You really can't go wrong with a restaurant that changes its menu daily. \u00a0You get the freshest food and good flavor combinations. \u00a0Not sure what I can really add to all the other glowing reviews, but here it goes...Started with the cheese plate appetizer. \u00a0On the day we were there, it was the most delicious blue cheese along with some pickled beets and toast points. \u00a0I'm not typically a fan of beets, but the combination was fantastic. \u00a0Next I had the salad. \u00a0Nothing super special about it, but certainly good. \u00a0For an entree I went with the sirloin. \u00a0Cooked perfectly with fresh green beans and new red potatoes. \u00a0I was stuffed when I was done, but everything was so good I just kept eating. \u00a0I can only imagine how good the desserts were. \u00a0Adding to the outstanding food, was the excellent service and the welcoming interior. \u00a0Margot is definitely a winner."], ["Sarah H.", "The food was really good, but it wasn't the best meal I've had in Nashville. We had the fried green tomatoes with blue cheese topping, a lamb topped flatbread, ribeye, the soft shell crab with a sweet corn mixture and the blackberry lemon tart like dessert.My boyfriend's ribeye was cooked perfectly; it was tender and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were good, but not great. The flatbread was surprisingly flavorful, and the soft shell crab was almost wonderful. It was very warm and flavorful, but there were several small pieces of shell I periodically tasted. Obviously, it's impossible to get every little piece out, but it was a nuisance. However, the corn made up for it, and the portions were large. Our dessert was fabulous, and the couple we ate with's peach bread pudding was even better.Our server was attentive, but had a chip on his shoulder. I am a Sonoma wine girl, and I know little about Italian or French wines. When I asked for something similar to a Sonoma Pinot noir, he snootily told me they don't serve anything like a Sonoma wines. He then proceeded to try to get me to order a Shiraz blend- Thanks but no. Our meal continued in this manner. Someone at our table would mention how good the rabbit looked, and he would chime in and tell us all about it. He made his opinions a little too clear, to the point of almost being forceful. Prices were reasonable. Parking was a little difficult, because the lot was full. I'd certainly dine here again, but it wasn't the \"last meal\" I was hoping for.

I would say the crab meat is expensive, its $9+ for a tiny crab meatI ordered the \"Crab ravioli\" and a \"Champagne shrimp scallop linguini\" for lunch and they are both served in a very good proportion. But the linguini noodles was kind of hard. I don't know if its how they served the food or they just messed it up, but make sure to bring it up when you order it, if you are wanting to have a perfect dinner. And for the win!

The bread was certainly a great base, crunchy outside with a nice chew to it. It was served with a decent amount of fresh sliced beef and topped with tons of cheese.

They don't even try with the bread. Now let us move on to the red sauce. Absolutely no flavor whatsoever. It is almost as though they open a can of tomato paste and just heat it up. I can't tell you how much salt I had to use just to taste anything. The first time I ate here, I don't remember the sauce being so bad. I wonder if they got a new chef or something.The service definitely leaves something to be desired. Last night, I felt as though the servers could have been supported by management a little bit better. There was a very rude family with about five children who were running around the restaurant spitting through straws, and the waitresses and waiters had to maneuver around them. It was really bad, and management should have done something to correct the situation. I certainly did not enjoy my meal because of this family, and as I looked around, I noticed other people who were very irritated. This is a tough situation in a restaurant, but management needs to have the balls to take care of it.The market part is very cute, and I was happy to see that they started making their own fresh mozzarella. I bought some, but I haven't tried it yet. Desserts are okay, but I wonder if they are made in house. Regardless, \u00a0I definitely will not be back."], ["Mike A.", "For me, this is literally as good as it gets. I've driven by this place occasionally for the last handful of years and have always wanted to stop in. A profile of it on the show TN Crossroads finally got me to do it. Had dinner here and could not have been more satisfied. The low-key market style setup really gets my attention. Not a particularly formal place. Definitely not touristy. It has an authentic feel that does not try too hard like so many places in Nashville do. The service was top notch. Our waiter was young but knew the menu very well and all the nuances that go along with serving authentic Italian food. We had the Bruschetta to start and I knew it was going to be a good meal when I tasted this. I could have had a second order of it. Then I had fettuccini and meatballs. My dinner partner had the chicken parm. I tried it all...all delicious and as good as I've ever had. A glass of house red wine was $5. Can't beat that. Portions were excellent size. If you've gotten this far in the review you know I will have nothing bad to say about this place. So just do yourself a favor, cruise on over to Charlotte Ave. and check this place out."], ["Alan d.", "Do no t order the penne al fresco.

We had a great experience, and a great waiter. We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer and they were great. Our Caesar salad was very crisp, fresh and delicious. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and it was just OKAY. I've definitely had worse, but not the best. The Eggplant slices too thick in my opinion. We ordered a side of meatballs and they were GREAT! Best meatballs I have ever had! I highly recommend them!!! The tiramisu was fantastic! When you're done eating or if there is a wait, shop around in their market.

The restaurant is in Germantown, a more up and coming part of Nashville, and it took longer than expected to get an Uber to the bars after eating.

After hearing some good things we were excited to try City House out. When we arrived we had some time to kill so we decided to grab a drink from the bar. We were rudely greeted by the bar tender who then proceeded to take a very long time to make two drinks. The drinks were not very good, considering the other amazing options in Nashville. We had asked to close out once we got our drinks, but she refused to do it then. An hour went by, my wife went a sat at our reserved table while I had to ask two more times to close out. Then they gave me the wrong bill, to the tune of $72.00.... For two drinks...needless to say that was another nail in the coffin. Once we sat down, our waiter was very helpful. However, we ordered a glass of wine and another man who brought it to us quickly said what it was and with it being loud in the restaurant, I asked what he said the wine was because we thought he had said a different wine than what we ordered. He then quickly, with attitude, said the entire name of the wine as it's listed on the menu and turned away. We ordered the clams with white beans, which literally had 5 clams. I counted. The dish was okay, but not great. We also had the Belly ham pizza with the egg. Honestly, there was nothing special about it. It tasted good, but was no where near Desanos flavor profile. After spending $75 on the meal, we were very underwhelmed and left regretting our decision to go to City House on our anniversary. We have had MUCH BETTER experiences and MUCH BETTER food at other restaurants in Nashville."], ["W. John R.", "We dined here with some friends who moved to Nashville awhile back. When your local friends recommend a place as THE restaurant you have to try when you're in town for the first time, you have a high expectation. And this place most definitely delivered.My first pleasant surprise was the cocktail menu. Whenever you see an assortment of bitters, egg whites, citrus zest, and other creative ingredients beyond the standard liquor-and-soda, you know you're in for a treat. I ordered two different drinks just because I was so curious, and both were pour to perfection.We had a relatively late lunch at Centennial Park, so we weren't starving enough for appetizers. Our friends ordered the calamari and it looked phenomenal. My main course was the chuck steak. I was nervous ordering what is generally looked at as an inferior meat at that price point, but my fears were completely unwarranted. The lemon/Parmesan/onion combo was a different take on steak, and I devoured every bite.I felt badly for our waiter, who tripped going up the steps and lost an entire tray full of empty water glasses.Note: be careful if you're planning to hit this restaurant up on the same day as a baseball game. There isn't a dedicated parking lot, and the street parking is completely packed due to close proximity to the baseball stadium. There were paid lots nearby charging money, but instead I found an open street spot - but it was about 5 blocks away and a ten minute walk back to the restaurant."], ["Michael U.", "Items Selected:Frico: Buttermilk Cheddar, Sweet Potato, Chilies, Scallion, Cider VinegarBelly Ham Pizza: Mozzarella, Grana Padano, Oregano, Chilies, EggCornbread Gnocchi: Chard, Tomato, Tesa, Chilies, GMRSConchiglie: Mushrooms, Parmesan Fonduta, Garlic, Lemon, ParsleyRice Grits: Chicken Sausage, Greens, Red Onion, Garum, Grit CrumbsSausage: Rhubarb, Orange, Vidalia, Peanuts, CeleryYellow Corn Grits, Turnip Greens, Pot LiquorStrawberry Ice Box Pie: Preserves + Braccheto Jelly, Vanilla Malt Snickerdoodle Crumbs, Mascarpone CremaCookies + Cream Panna Cotta: Sipping Cream Caramel, Chocolate Toffee Meringue Crumbs, Mascarpone CremaTennessee Waltz Cake: Chocolate Buttermilk Praline, Bourbon Zabaglione, Coffee ButterscotchAlmond Ricotta Pound Cake: Lemon Marmalade, Lemon Ricotta GelatoFrequently named amongst the best restaurants in Nashville, and yet another in the long list of places proudly promoting a seasonal menu focused on Italian accented Southern fare, it was at City House that the trip's final dinner with family would be enjoyed and although some aspects of the night were marred by an exceedingly loud group of bachelorettes and service that seemed far more interested in tables to whom he could push expensive bottles of wine the food itself was mostly quite good, a few significant highs and the rest at least well enough prepared to let the quality of well sourced ingredients show.Situated in an old home with seating spread amidst a large downstairs and two rooms comprising the space above, it was at first that our seating in a small former bedroom seemed a bit unfortunate but once the bridesmaids became well lubricated even the warm, stagnant air was preferable to the shrieks and shouts echoing off high ceilings - our server more than once pulled to assist another young man that appeared to be an overwhelmed trainee as thirty minutes passed between ordering and first courses that never once saw our party checked in on at all.Eventually mentioning the lack of attention to our server, a confronting attitude offered where an apology would have been far better made, it was thankfully here that appetizers arrived, the crisply fried cheese and vegetables offering a slight bit of heat amidst hefty aromatics while the lightly charred pizza featured a crust robust enough to stand up to several unctuous toppings, the signature cornbread dumplings dotted in pancetta, tomatoes, and greens certainly as hefty a plate as would be expected, a dish best shared to be sure as a half-portion would serve smaller appetites as a meal in itself.Onward to entrees, at this point visibly seeing patrons in the larger room wince at the behavior exhibited from the party of twelve, it was another large bowl of pasta that proved the best of three plates for as good as each sausage was the accoutrements leaned heavily on the use of onions with the chicken version all the more confounded by what seemed like nothing more than raw lettuce, an odd choice to say the least, though certainly not as unpalatable as the side of corn grits that was so bracingly bitter than it went almost untouched, a 'your mileage may vary' plate to say the very least.Having heard many positives of the City House dessert program, enough so that the meal would culminate in an order most easily stated as \"one of each, please,\" it was here that I was glad none of the entrees compelled me to overeat for as much as the prices of some savories seemed a tad excessive the $8 sweets were portioned exceedingly generous, the lightly set panna cotta most certainly the lightest of the quartet despite its bold flavors while the strawberry tart melded cream and fruit flawlessly, both cakes far more decadent with the poundcake potentially containing as much as a stick of butter per slice and the layered Tennessee Waltz just boozy enough to tantalize the tastebuds up front before dissipating into notes of coffee and caramel competing for top billing amidst a buttermilk tinge."], ["Sheena T.", "Man...

My dish was very blah and the onions were just not good. My BF had the grits with a lamb sausage that he enjoyed, but again, I thought tasted oddly.

I was unsure if there was some uncertainty about me not wanting the cocktail so when a man brought the wine and I explained the situation, and attempted to hand him my cocktail back. He refused and said he would tell my server. Unpleasantly, that did not happen and instead we were stuck with the icky cocktail on the bill. Even after I explained to the waitress (she approached us when I wrote her a note on the bill). She profusely apologized and then left. Ok.....you are actually not sorry.

The pork belly pizza was one of the best wood-fired \u00a0pies I've had. Their trout was fresh and nicely prepared, with peanuts, raisins and lemon. A standout was the bread gnocchi. I don't know how they did it, but it was the perfect combination - and in their delicious tomato sauce? Wonderful.Service: Knowledgeable wait staff, all of whom have beards that, unlike in NY, are not ironic. Amicable and attentive.Ambience: It felt like a classy hipster joint with high ceilings and an industrial look but with nice woodgrain everywhere. Cool atmosphere.Bottom Line: You cannot go wrong at the City House."], ["Sydney S.", "This restaurant was so unique. We went for \"Sunday dinner\" that changes to a completely new menu weekly. With four of us, we shared salads, some small plates and a pizza. It was all uniquely flavored with interesting combinations that were surprisingly very, very tasty.

A group of my friends went on a Friday night for dinner, and besides the pork belly pizza, the food was average to say the least. On the menu, it was described much better than it actually looked and tasted. Not to mention we waited over an hour for our entrees, and when we spoke to the manager about the situation she condescendingly responded, \"This is a typical wait time in Nashville on a Friday night.\" We thought that was pretty rude considering we were from a much larger city, yet have never heard that particular excuse before. Anyway, I think there are many better places to try in Nashville that have friendlier staff and better food.

We ordered a bottle of wine and decided to each order an entree and share it. We got the fettuccine with lamb sugo, gnocchi, and trout. AMAZING. It was like a mouth-gasm. So so so so SO delicious.The only downfall was the service. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about each food item but she was pretty slow when it came to serving water and getting our wine.

We went Sunday night, which is a unique experience. On Sunday they create a different menu than the rest of the week. I was told the Sunday menu is never recreated. We started with fried summer sausage, chow chow, and buttermilk cheddar. The trick was to get a little bit of all three in one bite. The combination is salt, sour, and creamy was fabulous. For our main dishes, we had the chicken and jalape\u00f1o sausage over cucumbers, vidalia onions, cabbage and a sausage and potato pizza. The sausage had the flavor of jalape\u00f1o without the heat, so my wife could enjoy it as well. The pizza was so delicious I ate most of it myself. Dessert was a peach cobbler and a caramel pecan chocolate mini pie. The cobbler was one of the best I have ever had. I prefer a more pie type crust, this was more a bread type. Not being a fan of pecans I was wonderfully surprised how good the pie was. This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.

This cute place is located in quaint neighborhood. There is NO PARKING. So be prepared to find a spot on the street or nearby neighborhood and walk a few blocks. Don't even think about parking in the 3 parking lots designated for McCabe's Pub. A guy chased us down to move our car after we tried to park there. Food was good. My son definitely had the best dish which was recommended by our server--the Pasta Angelina. It was outstanding. The rest of my kids had run of the mill fettuccine Alfredo. My husband and I split the Cheese Ravioli with tomato cream sauce with shrimp & scallops. Shrimp were over cooked and chewy. Scallops were good. They bring out crusty bread with dipping oil before dinner. We were too full to have dessert but choices sounded wonderful. We sat on the small patio, so I can't comment on the indoor ambiance. The patio was very small but fine temp with ceiling fans (it was a hot night, but sun was already going down).Overall, I would come prepared to search for parking and order one of the top 3 things listed on their menu. The Angelina was great. We didn't try the other 2 (lasagna & pork shank) but it is what they are known for. \u00a0We were from out of town, so not sure if I would come back again just because of inconvenience of parking.

The atmosphere here is also very laid back and welcoming.We started things off with the Tuscan Bruschetta and Calamari. The bruschetta was terrific. The sausage was flavorful, and the bread had soaked up all of the juices. The greens and beans were a nice touch, and the red onions added a good bite. The calamari was also really tasty. It had a very light breading, and the lemon aioli was just acidic enough to zest things up a little. My wife always leaves me the little tentacle bits, which are her least favorite part, but thankfully I love them!I went with their dinner special, which was smoked salmon atop orecchiette pasta, in a whole grain mustard sauce, with assorted vegetables. This dish was sooooooo good!!! I loved the strong mustard flavor, as well as the nice crunch of red onion. The salmon was very fresh and didn't taste fishy at all.

I had the chicken saltimbocca sandwich. Presentation and flavor was decent. I do wish the chicken had been marinated and made of flattened cutlets versus chuncked though.

The restaurant is tiny, and in some ways that makes it cozy. My friend and I were sat up against a wall, where it felt like we were frequently being bumped into. The seating arrangement honestly detracted from the meal a little. I ordered the Mediterranean cheese sticks, which were sticks of feta topped with basil leaves, wrapped in phyllo dough, baked, and served with chopped tomatoes, olives, and capers. It was very salty but delicious! For dinner, I ordered the fettucine with their amatriciana sauce and grilled shrimp. It was delicious! The pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was savory and a little spicy, and the shrimp were tasty. I saw someone order the tiramisu and had to try it myself. To me, it was the best part of the meal. Perfectly sweet and creamy, with just right proportions of espresso and mascarpone. Overall, it was a nice dinner. The price was a little steep and the seating was less than ideal, but it was a darn good bowl of pasta and ther best tiramisu I've ever had!"], ["JC L.", "What can I say? \u00a0This place never fails to impress. \u00a0I almost don't want to write a review because it's like a hidden little gem in my favorite neighborhood. \u00a0Only it's not so hidden I suppose after being featured on Food Network. \u00a0The lasagna is amazing and my husband always gets the chef's feature.

We got there at 7 on a Sunday and they were already busy. They had three servers going about a mile a minute hosting, serving, bartending and busing tables. We had to wait a while to be seated, wait a couple minutes for our drink order, and then about 20 minutes to get our appetizers and another 30 to get our food. We were there just under 2 hours all told. During that time people were still coming in and having to wait to be seated, often even longer than we had waited. That said, it was some of the BEST Italian food we've had and I was surprised to find it at Nipper's Corner, so far from the main hub of Nashville. The dressing on the Caesar salad was flavorful without being overbearingly fishy and my salad was not drowning in it, but well covered. The crab cakes were lemony and garlicky and delicious. The cheese bread was also very good with fresh, flaky bread brushed with garlic and herbs and covered in gooey cheese. My husband ordered their lasagna. Normally to the husband food is food is food and he's mostly indifferent. Not to this. He said it was \"amazing\", and that the noodles did not taste like regular plain ole box noodles. This was the first time I've ever seen him try to continue to eat after stating he was full. He thought it was that good. He normally gets testy about long waits too, but stated he would be willing to visit again, and wait again, to have their food again. I agree with him. So, not your pop in pop out quicky meal type place, but definitely worth it if you don't mind the wait. Or maybe try them on an off hour for quicker service."], ["Phil C.", "Wow! What a find.

It's certainly one of the best restaurants in the area, but that says more about the lack of competition than it says about Villalba's quality. The service was friendly, albeit a little slow. It WAS Friday night during the dinner rush, so I can't really complain. A couple of changes would definitely improve the service experience:One, employ a bartender. The woman who I can only assume to be the manager/owner was manning the bar as well as seating tables and running food. It was no small surprise that there was no one seated at the bar as a result. It's a shame, because the bar is certainly the most attractive seating option in the restaurant. Two, designate or employ a host/hostess, and get a stand of some sort. The tables come right up to the entrance in the restaurant's current configuration. They probably could afford to lose one table near the entrance to allow for a host/hostess and waiting area, considering there was no wait for a table in the middle of the Friday night dinner rush. My wife and I just milled around near the door until we were acknowledged by an employee. We and the diners at the tables nearest the door were slightly uncomfortable with the situation. The food was lackluster at best. The tomato sauces on our dishes tasted as if they came from a can. There was a tinny acidity that doesn't come from home-made sauce (unless you're cooking it in a reactive pan of some sort and leave out some fairly basic ingredients). I certainly can do better at home for less expense. In short, they're better than the Italian chain restaurants in Nashville, but I can't in good conscience recommend them above Molinari's in Cool Springs or Mama Mia's in Crieve Hall. Their price point is SLIGHTLY below those two I mentioned, and they do have a pretty good wine/beer/liquor list, which is certainly an improvement over their independent competition. I'll likely return and order something else (without tomato sauce) in hopes that I'll find something I like, because their location is VERY convenient."], ["Naeveah O.", "So it was late this last Monday and we didn't want fast food.

We sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our order after our beverages were delivered, and another 10 minutes for the bread to arrive. I ordered a chicken Penne pasta dish, but the chicken tasted funny. One of the reviews I read said that they thought that the chicken tasted like goat. I had to laugh because. although I've never eaten goat, I guess that's how I would imagine it tastes.

The pasta was tolerable and the bread was good. To our waitresses credit, she addressed our concerns."], ["Adam Y.", "I quite enjoyed my experience. The atmosphere, as others have stated, is casual and friendly. Their small drink selection consists of wine and beer, which is fine. They're not trying to attract a bar crowd. I will recommend that you try the Forst Sixtus; the only specialty beer on the menu. It's a darker beer, but very crisp and clean. One word best describes the food: hearty. They don't serve you a bread basket with olive oil. No, they bring out their marinara. My friend and I went with some basics for this visit. We started with the baked ravioli, which was well prepared and not dried out on at the edges. My buddy had the chicken parmesan and I went for their evening's special. I forget the name, but it was basically a chicken fettuccine with spinach, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. Both dishes could stand to be a little less salty. Other than that, no complaints.I'm glad to have a decent Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. I will definitely go back to try their other offerings, especially the pizzas and lamb. I was bit too full to try their housemade cannoli, though I was tempted to get it anyway. I will stop by for lunch another time and try some of their espresso offerings. I'm always happy to see a restaurant using a traditional style machine."], ["Jessica C.", "This is truly a great find! The owner is actually from Italy and so everything tastes very authentic.

I like the service too."], ["Debbie C.", "I had the Chicken Marsala, which was unusually sweet; I could only eat a few bites. \u00a0 My husband had the lasagna. \u00a0We had heard from friends that this was a good Italian restaurant so we were looking forward to a nice meal. \u00a0I wish I could say the food was great, but no. \u00a0 The waiter was great and friendly."], ["Kimberly Y.", "Delicious Sunday lunch! We stopped in around 1:30 pm on a Sunday and were shown right to a table. For 2 adults and a 3yo we ordered the Bistec sandwich, a cup of Italian wedding soup and a kid's pizza with pepperoni, bacon and black olives. The Caesar salad side to our sandwich was yummy (uniformly chopped romaine) and bigger than we expected for a side salad. Bistec sandwich was piled with meat and the saut\u00e9ed veggies still had a hint of crunch; no wimpy veggies! The kid's pizza is big! Maybe 8 inches?

The outdoor patio is a converted alley and somehow manages to give the place an old world patina. On occasion there's live music with a guitarist strumming Italian-American favorites. The wood fired pizza is delicious. There are other entrees on the menu but it's a pizzeria so I only ever get the pizza. They offer an equal number of regular and white pies which makes choosing something equally hard. I'm partial to the Parma, Quattro Formaggi, and Salsicca. The pizzas are larger than a personal but not large enough for two so a good rule of thumb is to order two pizzas for three people."], ["Julie L.", "My group at this restaurant on the recommendation of a waitress at another restaurant in downtown Nashville. \u00a0The location was interesting because it was in an up and coming neighborhood, which was neat to see. \u00a0We were seated outdoors in an alley that was very unique. \u00a0The food was pretty good, we had someone try the pizza, pasta, and an entree and all were delicious. \u00a0The pizza we were told prior to ordering is not sliced which we did think was odd. \u00a0We figured out why when we got the pizza. \u00a0The dough is not firm when cooked and the ingredients slide off. \u00a0But the pizza was still good. \u00a0The pastas were oven baked and the pork entree was flavorful with good sides.The reason for the 3 star review was the service by our waiter. \u00a0We were only drinking water and had to ask for refills several times before getting it. \u00a0He barely came by at all during our meal. \u00a0We asked for bread with the pasta meals and it came out halfway through the meal along with Parmesan and red pepper for the pizza which was almost gone. \u00a0I am not sure what the issue was but I would suggest focusing on customer service a little more."], ["Kimberly S.", "I love this place. I used to live on the street behind it and would walk over frequently for meals. The atmosphere here, especially when you can sit outside, is amazing. The outside is set off from the street and surrounded by warehouses with Christmas lights strung above. The service is also generally very good. I've had some incredible service and some just okay.The food is amazing. The pizza is perfectly chewy with fresh or imported from Italy ingredients. My favorite is the Salsiccia pizza, which is perfectly garlicky with broccolini and tasty slices of sausage. The Margarita pizza is a classic and done incredibly well. In addition, their pasta is perfect. I'm a huge snob about restaurants over-cooking their pasta. Every time I have ordered one here, it is perfectly al dente. The Penne Alla Vodka is loaded with pancetta and a perfectly zesty sauce. I highly recommend Bella Napoli for a date night. It's casual but still romantic.My one caveat is that it can get pretty pricy quickly.

Good sauce, excellent crust, and quality toppings. As a neighbor I am constantly fantasizing about their wood fired pizza because the aroma wafts over to my apartment sometimes. My most recent dine at Bella Napoli was impromptu because Taco Mammacita had a 45 minute wait. Luckily pizza and tacos are my main food groups so I was happy to trot next door to Bella's cute courtyard. My friends and I had some Yazoo at a great price, and shared bruschetta for an app. It was delicious-- heavy on the olive oil. The tomatoes were a bit pink, and I like them dark red and juicy. But hey, winter is barely over. For dinner I had the gnocchi. I spent more than I was looking to spend but it was worth every penny. A nice deep red sauce and cheesy goodness hugs the little potato filled pasta so well. So delicious! My friends really enjoyed their pizza and panini as well. The crust is fluffy and flavorful. Our server was very friendly and funny.

What an unexpected surprise. While there's never a bad time to eat pizza, I must say that coming to BN in the summer time is a joy. Why? Because of the alleyway. The alleyway (like someone mentioned above) is reminiscent of a movie set what with the strewn lights, brick facade and strains of live music. It's also fantastically romantic so fellas, if you're looking to charm your lady with a night out... I'm just sayin'. So, when it's warm, come here and eat in the alley (I know it sounds odd; I promise, it's a winner of an idea).But even if it's not warm, come here and eat. You'll have a marvelous time (and I never use that word). Come hungry, ready to explore the menu and be open to a progression of flavors. I started off with a New Fashioned Cocktail -- a twist on the classic Old Fashioned. Not only was it well-made, I was surprised to know that I could find great cocktails at an unassuming Italian restaurant. To pair with it (and whet my appetite), I started with the caprese salad. It was the standard caprese but all the ingredients were fresh and the flavor popped. By dinner time, I'd decided on the penne alla vodka and a bottle of wine. I know, I know... what about the pizza? Well, it wasn't a pizza kind of night but judging from the pies brought out to other tables, you can't go wrong with the pizza selection. My pasta was nicely-cooked, perfectly tossed with sauce and fairly populated with pancetta and onion. If you've had this dish before, you'll love it here. Again, the presentation/dish wasn't anything new but I wasn't ordering 'anything new.' I was ordering a comfortable stand-by and that's what I received. I found the waiter's description of the malbec to be right on the nose. The bottle was incredibly drinkable, fruity with a bit of a nutty finish. It's a great wine. What wasn't so great was the mark up. A glass of the stuff is just about as much as a bottle is to buy at the store. A bottle at BN will run you, about, 3 times what you'd pay at a store. It's a good wine. It pairs well with the food. It's drinkable. But don't gouge the customer on the markup. That was the only sore point of the evening. The service was a bit bumpy but our waiter was so earnest and was trying to so hard, I couldn't hold the snafus against him. Effort makes a difference -- as does ambiance. Would I have been so taken with the meal/evening had we sat inside? I don't know. I do know that the inside belies the quality of the food/drink you could/would expect at BN. And, perception is reality in many cases so... there's that. I wouldn't tell you to plan your BN excursions based upon the availability of alley seating... but I also wouldn't say you would be upset at your choice to do so."], ["Chandler C.", "what else to say? It's got the best pizza in Nashville. The owner is super dope. You should go here... just don't bring your annoying sorority sisters."], ["Steven B.", "Good pizza especially the crust.

It was a Monday afternoon and I had the place to myself until half way through the meal. The staff were courteous and prompt and explained the menu and special options that day.

Not a big deal, it was fairly easy to cut through the delicious thin crust with my knife, and my server kindly warned me that she had just handed me one giant pizza without slices!

I, for one, will certainly be back!"], ["Zoraida K.", "I have looked forward to making a short jaunt to Edgehill Village to visit not only this eatery but a dessert place close by, for which another review will be written.Let me preface this with saying that I have never been to Naples, but have been very close, all Italian areas north of there, and therefore may hold a higher, lets say, expectation, of what to expect in the way of authentic Napoli pizza.First of all I LOVE the outside eating space. I think the entire EV is very cute and cozy but the area that BNP has taken ownership of with picnic tables, Italian music and hanging lights are enough alone for a return visit. Molto Bella!Secondly, the inside actually transports you, rather seamlessly, with the lack of windows and Italian channel T.V., to a small Italian eatery in a village in Italy. So the atmosphere made up for what we found to be a lacking meal for our first visit.I have heard great things and was excited about trying the pizza. My husband opted for the Chicken Parmigiana which I was afraid wouldn't live up to his distant, both figuratively and literally, memories. The waiter was very attentive and the Ruffini Chianti was moderately priced but generously served. We ordered the Antipasti Platter as a starter and all of it was fair. We enjoyed the coupling of two slices of pizza bread with the meats, but could have used more. The bruschetta piece was small and crumpled on impact dropping much of its offering on to my plate below. My husband didn't care of the bologna, which is strange. I found it rather bland but pleasantly thinly sliced.I prefer my pizza unsliced and that is the way it came. It was not soggy at all as I have read in other reviews. In fact it was a bit dry. The tomato sauce was used sparingly and that is my favorite part! The pizza dough was cooked to perfection and therefore I will return.My husband actually left some of the chicken un-eaten, which is unheard of, so I knew without tasting it that it was run-of-the-mill at best. He chose to eat the penne it was served on without it. He said it was \"OK\", and he would definitely order something else next time. Be prepared to pay for parking and plan to sit outside which I think in the upcoming fall evenings will be lover-ly.Overall a slight let down on 1st try, but we will give it another."], ["Qi W.", "Bad pizza; the dough is so chewy that it tastes like gum.

It was fantastic, and except for a few charred areas on the crust that tasted pretty bad was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.Working against choosing to come here is the pay parking. \u00a0I guess Cool-Kid-Ville has to make a little extra money so they converted a dirt lot into a dirt parking lot with narrow lanes.

Maybe it is not my style, but the pizza was watery and mushy. It definitely did not taste the best with all of that mush mixing flavors and the crust falls apart in a soggy mess. I did see a few plates of pasta pass by my table that looked delicious. I may return to try a different dish but I won't be ordering pizza again anytime soon. The outdoor seating is adorable though. Truly quaint and comfortable."], ["James B.", "The ingredients in pizza are basic: quality tomatoes, cheese, flour, yeast, herbs... and at Bella, the flavours of these basic ingredients have the limelight. Their pizza tastes (as far as I can tell) as though nothing has been added that should not be--like dough conditioners to hold the dough together, or silicone to keep the cheese from clumping.Additionally, their marinara sauce is a bit runnier than the uber-concentrated paste that often ends up on most pizza. Thicker sauce generally tastes sweeter as it contains more sugar per volume. Also, thicker sauce has less water, creating a less soggy crust. But, I prefer the Bella approach which is to use a relatively thinner sauce, and create a crust that is crispy, chewy, and YES, a little soggy all at the same time!Overall, the pizza reminds me of the pizza that I had in Naples, Italy 15 years ago. I don't know if I'll ever get to travel back over there, so I am thankful that a place like Bella is so close to home.I think most of the negative reviews on here ( those who complain of not enough flavor, and soggy ingredients) were probably expecting something similar to Mellow Mushroom or Papa Johns, or perhaps pizza with way too much salt added and processing chemicals.I have only one complaint about the pizza. It comes out burnt. This, I believe is intentional. It is a more authentic pizza experience, but I would prefer the bottom of the crust be golden brown instead of black. Not just because charred food is generally considered carcinogenic, but I also prefer the taste. But, in spite of the charred bottom, I come back to Bella Napoli a few times a year to get that authentic pizza experience."], ["Drew U.", "Up front - be prepared to pay for parking.

Great little courtyard when weather is nice.For me though, it's all about the food hence my rating. \u00a0Other reviewers mentioned the \"soggy in the middle problem\". \u00a0This is the big issue here and in my opinion the only thing keeping this place from getting a bunch of 5 star reviews. \u00a0I can guarantee the pizza doesn't come out of that oven soggy. \u00a0It is very hot and gets dropped on a plate immediately. \u00a0That plate traps steam and when it gets to your table it is most definitely soggy in the middle. \u00a0This issue could be resolved. \u00a0In my opinion - this is NOT how pizza should be served (as one reviewer reported that their waiter had suggested).The toppings were good and the non-soggy part of the crust was very good. \u00a0I thought the prices were reasonable. \u00a0I thought the menu was specialized but had enough variety.If they address the soggy crust issue I would be a regular here; otherwise, I won't be back when I could just as easily go to Desanos on music row."], ["Paul K.", "I'll preface this with the wife liked it. \u00a0I ordered the Margherita pizza, a stuffed eggplant appetizer, and cheesecake. \u00a0We were there with 4 of our friends, so we got a pretty wide sample.Friend to my left ordered some sort of pizza with fresh mozz cheese, across ordered a stromboli of some sort, other didn't eat anything cept cheesecake, stromboli, and the wife ordered pizza of unknown properties.Wife likes hers, stromboli was a universal hit, friend with mozz pizza was complaining because it was pretty much water and cheese - entire thing was a soggy mess and she asked the waiter about it and was told that's how fresh mozz cheese cooks, she was not happy.My margherita pizza, I'll say the wife liked it and I would never order it again. We had a conversation about it and I would rather have microwave pizza than their margherita. The only taste to it seemed to be the burned wood \u00a0flavor of it (which was good, if there was any flavor for it to accentuate).The cheesecake seemed like it was out of a box for 10 weeks - kind of dry, but was ok.Liked the atmosphere, but would never order the marg pizza again. After lookiing at the mozzi pizza I would never order anything with their mozzarella as it was a totally liquid mess (cheesecloth, it'll let you drain your cheese and not have a pie that looks like a lake).Value for money was not there, left hungry after eating a whole pizza and cheesecake. \u00a0Wife has said she'll start a yelp account just to counter my review of the place, but seriously, this was slightly burnt crust (which was ok mind you), tomato sauce, and a little bit of cheese... when you picked up a slice all the cheese and sauce left the pizza.Maybe I'm a fan of American pizza too much, but when I want a pizza I want flavor, slices, and something to stop my hunger. \u00a0This came uncut / we used dullish steak knives to slice it and it was unspectacular.Liked the place, but I wouldn't go back for the veggie-edible food... will say the strombolis were a hit"], ["T R.", "Delicious pasta.

We were looking to have some beers, hang out, and eat dinner, and I wasn't sure what to expect. Our wait for a table was estimated at 45 minutes (ending up being closer to 60-75 minutes) and so we ended up spending time in the bar area, which was packed - not surprising considering the deals they had going. By the way, when they say 2-for-1, it's literally that...NOT 1/2 price drinks. You order a beer, you get two. We were seated out on the patio, which was partially enclosed. I don't know if they move heat lamps out there ever, but they'll eventually need to or that space will be worthless. We ordered the garlic bread, fried ravioli, bruchetta, and chicken wing appetizers. I liked the ravioli but the garlic bread and bruchetta breads were weird - thick and block-like, like a cake, and dry. If I had really thought about the 2-for-1 deal, we would have ordered a bunch of slices of pizza, but instead we ordered four pizzas: a plain pepperoni (I think), the brass knuckles (buffalo chicken), the fedora (kalamata olives, mozzarella, and basil pesto), and the last request (veggies plus pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage, and jalapenos for an extra kick). The last request was my favorite by far. The veggies and meat were flavorful and the jalapenos gave it that extra boost. The fedora was bland except for the overwhelming salt from the olives - couldn't really even taste the basil pesto. I'm also not a fan of how thin the crust was...it was the kind of pizza and size of slice that you have to fold to be able to eat (unless you're going to use a knife and fork). Overall, we had a TON of food - no need to order four large pizzas for 7 people. The price wasn't horrible, but that was due to the 2-for-1 drink specials rather than the prices of the pizzas. Again, we had a ton of food, but it's not the kind of pizza I'd go for if I were ordering for myself, and the combos weren't that impressive, with the exception of the last request. Go once for the 2-for-1 and then try something else for dinner."], ["Dagan B.", "The pizza is better than average and the Alfredo was also.

It was hard to give a decent review and not go full on negative but the pizza was truly fantastic and saved the review. We went Sunday evening and there was a good crowd, not busy but certainly not slow. Took 20mins to be seated with multiple open tables that just weren't cleaned yet. But we sat down and it took a good 10mins for our server to finally come see us. We all order, I got a coors light draft and it was part of their 2 for 1. And we all got waters and the water is definetly tap and all had like no ice at all same with the two people who got sodas, barely any ice. We wait like 8mins for our drinks to come, if not longer and my coors light was warm because the wait and because they take the mugs straight from the warm dishwasher and pour beer into. One of the people I was with got Stella and they brought the wrong beer so she had to wait another 5mins for him to bring two Stella's, in a bottle! Wth. The server brings her beer and she asks for a mug and at this point we knew what we wanted but he went to get the mug first and it literally no lie took about 15mins. The mug tasted like straight up dish soap. While she waited for the mug I noticed on my second beer there was some goop on it so I went to the bar to swap it out and that's where another problem laid. Three servers sitting waiting for drinks and a very slow inattentive bartender. Luckily a second bar tender saw me waiting and apologized and swapped out my beer for me. But we had to make a second trip to the bar because of her soapy mug. But finally after waiting a total of like 40mins we finally get our pizza. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and pepperoni pizza. And boy! The pizza made up for the absolute atrocious service. I would recommend this place for takeout but not sit down.

It seems like they make a LOT of cheese slices, throw whatever you ask for on top, and blast it in the oven for a second or two. I ordered jalapenos on my pizza. They were fresh (which is great) but they weren't even remotely cooked on my slice.

As they claim to be a New York style pizza joint, I expected much better. Typically the Margherita has a tomato based sauce. This did not. I get it when restaurants try to put a new fling on an old recipe, but this was horrible. We asked for some sauce on the side which they brought out, but it was pretty nasty too. Neither of us finished our first slice and I called for the check. The waiter was suprised when we didn't want a box to take home the uneaten large pizza. We saw this place after eating at Burgur Up on Saturday night. It was very busy, I am guessing it is a great hang out place. But, I wouldn't call it New York style pizza. My impression is that they were trying to create a theme restaurant, but didn't have the recipe to back it up.

Tonight's pizza unfortunately did not hit the spot and will turn me away for a bit. The center of my pizza had such a thin crust that it tasted chewy and near raw with how thing it was.

So let me start by saying that this is not a chain restaurant. This is an Italian restaurant that is small. Come here to relax and enjoy your meal and your company. Don't come here if you get impatient. My husband and I went here Saturday night around 6:00. There wasn't a wait for a table. It was so nice to have a leisurely dinner and just talk. They first brought some amazing garlic bread. It is wonderful. Next up was a salad. I got Italian dressing on mine. It tasted homemade and had a slightly more vinegar type taste to it. My husband had ranch dressing on his and loved it too. I played it safe and got spaghetti with meat sauce for my meal. My husband got chicken Parmesan. Again, a safe choice for a new place to try. His sauce had a slight sweet taste to it. There was just the right amount of cheese on it. My meat sauce was wonderful. There are small pieces of tomato in it. I will say there was quite a bit of green in it. I wish there had been less or it was smaller pieces. I know this is some spice, just not sure which one. I'm just not a green pieces person. I would have liked to add salt and pepper to both of our meals. I think that would have made them perfect, but they were still great as they were. The portions were very large and we took home leftovers.We shared a tiramisu for dessert. I could have eaten it all myself. It was amazing!!! I have had lots of tiramisu. We had the best ever at an authentic Italian restaurant in NYC. It was homemade. This was right up there with it. They don't drown it in sauce or powder. I can't say enough about that dessert. I will probably just stop in there sometime to have dessert and coffee. In conclusion, this place gets 5 stars from me. Again, it's not a rush in and rush out like a chain restaurant. You will wait between courses. There are only a couple of servers. But it's wonderful and worth the wait. The people are so nice. I enjoyed it. We will definitely be back and bring family.Edit: I forgot to add that this is a bring your own bottle of wine place. We will definitely bring a bottle to enjoy next time.

Part of the allure is how small and intimate the space it. With a wine shop next door it's pretty neat that you can bring in whatever you would like to have with diner. The food is really solid in terms of being true Italian food. Every now and then it's a bit off, but there aren't many other places in Nashville to get true Italian food. Worth checking out for sure, would recommend for a couple on date night or small family get together. Arrive early as seating seems to fill up quickly."], ["Yamille H.", "I was on a long road trip from Miami, Fl to Niagara Falls. I was very very hungry and needed a place to eat. Being with the vegan bf makes it hard to eat anywhere. So I start looking for Italian bc that's actually the easiest for the both of us to find something. We stumbled across this gem. It is in a weird location. It's like behind a gas station, but don't be put off by that. The place inside is great. The walls are filled with artwork and the mood lighting is very intimate. The staff was very friendly and attentive throughout our entire meal. I had the mozzarella sticks. I know it sounds pretty standard, but let me tell you: I was so happy that I ordered these. They were anything but basic. I can't put my finger on it, but there was something so delicious. There was something that made it taste like no other mozzarella stock I ever had. I think it may have been the blend of cheeses and the breading was different and very tasty. The free bread sticks are amazing. They are deliciously buttered and seasoned. The house sauce accompanied the bread. It was a delicious marinara like sauce. I ordered the chicken parmesan with spaghetti and the vegan bf ordered spaghetti with the house sauce and no cheese.The chicken parmesan was a big piece of chicken that was not dry at all. The crust and cheese that was on the chicken was very good. The cheese was perfectly melted and It all worked so well together. The pasta was perfectly done and the sauce was so good. I was happy that it was the same sauce that was served with the bread sticks. I couldn't finish it all. It was a large portion so I took some to the hotel. Luckily the hotel had a microwave... I had it for breakfast the next day. Don't judge me. Oh! Before I forget- talking with the staff I found out the chicken is organic. I told them they should put that on the menu since I think that's a great selling point. It made sense that it was organic though. I was full, but I didn't get the gross feeling of overeating and wanting to die. I just felt pleasantly plump. \u00a0The vegan said he liked his pasta alot and offered alot of flavor for such a simple dish. He was happy they adhered to his request of no cheese and that they were able to recite what ingredients were in his food to quell his nervousness of eating something he can't. Although, he almost broke for the bread sticks. Sadly, the breadsticks are lightly brushed with butter. He was eating them with his eyes! I didn't get dessert because I was so full, but the have a variety of of portions that all sounds delicious. I wish I had access to this place all the time. It would have become my go-to spot for dinner. The food didn't get me sick to my stomach which is always my fear in life since I tend to have tummy issues and I was on a road trip.This place was def a good choice.

But it was totally worth it!To start, you can bring in your own wine, and there is a wine and spirit shop conveniently located next door. We ordered the appetizer sampler and it was very good. I was most excited for the mozzarella sticks (homemade!), but these ended up being the weakest link of the meal. They were mostly all bread with very little cheese. The meatballs on the other hand more than made up for it, as they were top notch! The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, even though this is what I was looking the least forward to! I believe there was even some prosciutto on those bad boys!I ordered the chicken mimmosa which was scrumptious! Too bad at this point I was already mostly full so didn't make it too far into my entree. This is never a bad problem to have though!This might not be the *best* Italian place ever, but for a middle tier option, it is the bees knees!

As appetizers we ordered mozzarella sticked that were huge & good. We also ordered a caprese salad, the tomatoes & the mozzarella was so fresh & it all flew off the plates. The garlic bread is large, buttery & hot. So good. With your entrees it includes a house salad. (No cesar salad unfortunately.) Also, I didn't care much for the house salad & their Italian dressing.

It was also really weird how they brought out our food 2 or 1 at a time & it took a while until we all had our food. Not to mention that we all didn't get menus & it took a long time for her to take our order. Another annoying but about the crappy service is that one of the members of our party had a 3 year old & as soon swear river we asked for a high chair.

So as for the food, the main course wasn't as good as I was expecting for the price that it was. And as an appetizer my boyfriend ordered mussels, which weren't actually on the menu but they had them anyway. We didn't get our bread until the mussels came out and that was a bit of a wait. But when the mussels actually came out, they smelled like my dog, which was a little unsettling. They tasted fine though I guess. I think the worst part though was that when they brought out my water, there was a tiny dead bug in it. So that was pretty gross, I ended up taking my boyfriends water instead, then when they brought me a replacement water, there was like paper or something floating around in it.

That is the bitter part of this review because I have been missing many years of wonderful Italian comfort food. Nonetheless, the sweet is the sweetest because my wife and I have a new favorite Italian restaurant. As we indulged in our meal we quickly realized we were experiencing something special. The food was perfectly executed. Not over salted, the right amount of cheese, and FRESH ingredients...this my friends are the keys to great Italian food. Do not be fooled by the other low ratings that were given for this restaurant...the will only deter you from the true definition of deliciousness. I understand everyone's pallet is different but realize that real Italian food is not \"Pizza Hut\". Fast food Italian is all preservatives, tons of salt and cheese, they do this to mask how bad the food is because cheese makes everything somewhat better. As for folks saying they were slow, that's incorrect. We were informed as soon as we were seated that all the food prepared is made from scratch so it takes a little longer. We were there 1 hour and five minutes with salads, two baskets of bread, mozzarella sticks for an app, our dinner courses, and finished a whole bottle of wine. Again, this is not fast food. This is a restaurant that produces quality, made from scratch food. I do not mind one taking a little extra time in preparing food in order to receive a quality product at the end. Trust me, do yourself a favor and try them out. I battled a while if I was going to write a review because I did not want anybody to know of this place, but it would not be a service to Mama Mias. Everyone should come and be loved at this place. Do something your future self will thank you for later...eat here."], ["Laila S.", "My friend and I have been stalking this place for awhile. we work fairly close by but they were closed for a few months, but we finally got in a few weeks ago. looks like they have remodeled according to my friend who had been there before. So whenevery i try a out a new Italian restaurant, I get a few certain items to judge.1. obiviously the tomato sauce is key, and Mama Mia's has a pretty decent one. Its not the best but in the top 3 of the Nashville restaurants i've tried.2. The bread with olive oil and herbs (and ideally balsamic vinegar too) theirs was fresh and hot, you could tell it was the same they use for the crust of the pizza, but thats ok, at least they presented it3. My favorite is the quattro formaggi - they do theirs right, with italian cheeses (and a lot of them) i had them stuffed into a calzoni and they added basil leaves as well, which made it that much more delicious!Overall a great little gem in Crieve Hall, good for date night or lunch."], ["Dan W.", "Two for the food, zero for service. I arrived a few minutes before noon, there was only a handful of people inside and two waitresses. My order for a meatball sandwich was taken relatively quickly. By twenty past twelve I was ready to ditch this place. The sandwich finally got to my table about five minutes later. Great sandwich done right, meatballs sliced in half and layered thru the Italian bread. The sauce was tangy, the mozzarella melted, and the sweet pepper I requested was cooked perfect.I had to be at the Nashville airport so I had to search out my waitress to get my check. Figures, she was in back yappin with the other one. Of course, the other one gets busy and disappears when I show up. This place has very good Italian food and has been here for 22 years, I can't say I'll return because of the service.Danno"], ["Melissa B.", "I am so sad to have to leave a bad review for this restaurant. I have heard great things about it, but, experienced the opposite tonight. My father owns restaurants and has taught me the importance of supporting family owned businesses but tonight this one puts family owned businesses to shame.I liked the intimate atmosphere. It is dimly lit and is great for a nice date night. After waiting for a while after placing our order, we received our salad (iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, carrots) and breadsticks (breadsticks were pretty good!). At this point, we were underwhelmed but still anticipating an amazing meal.And when I say anticipating...we anticipated a great meal for 25 minutes before we actually received our food. I ordered the Ravioli (can't remember the name but had a cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. When I received my meal, it was luke warm - the cheese that was supposed to be melted on top was hard...I typically do not send food back but I could not handle the fact that it had clearly been sitting out so I graciously sent it back to be heated up, recooked-whatever. When I received it back (within 3 minutes) it was obvious that it had just been microwaved to a molten lava temperature causing the chicken's texture to literally resemble plastic. I had about 3 bites - I could not handle it (I am the LEAST picky person in the world - if I won't eat something, you know it's bad). My husband's chicken marsala was soup. The sauce was runny and flavorless. He had about 3 bites. The server asked us if we wanted to go boxes and we declined. She paid no attention to the fact that we were clearly unsatisfied. As I said, my father owns restaurants, I understand there are mistakes and no one is perfect. But, the thing that bothered me was that we were not taken care of by any means. No manager came out to apologize for the 25 minute delay in our food - let alone apologize that mine came out nearly cold. This is the attention to detail patrons go to family owned businesses for. Our bill was about $45 for 5 bites of terrible food and a sad feeling that this family owned business would treat their patrons this way."], ["Melissa B.", "Don't be fooled by the exterior. When you walk inside you are transported to a candlelit and intimate little Italian nook. It is simple yet romantic. The prices are extremely reasonable and its BYOB. They do charge a small corking fee. The servers have always been very nice and helpful when it comes to suggesting delicious menu items. I know a lot of people on here have mentioned slow service however that has never been a problem for me. These dishes are cooked to order though so that can slow it down a little more! I gave them 4 out of 5 stars because of their menu changes. I actually like their old menu much better. I have had a couple of dishes on the new menu that I didn't love. Their classics like their lasagna and manicotti are great. The seafood dishes I've had I didn't love. I noticed this time they've added some lighter pasta dishes that I look forward to trying. Their salads are always delicious as is their bread basket. This is definitely one of my favorite places in Nashville!"], ["Andy B.", "I would have given this place 5 stars because the meal was really good, we both had their chicken Marsala, the dish I judge every Italian restaurant by, and it was great, but I think they had one waitress for the whole restaurant. I never saw another one. \u00a0Granted it was Tuesday, but this poor girl brought us wine glasses, $5 cork fee which rocks, and my glass was dirty. She didnt remember to bring me a clean one til mid meal, but I don't blame her. She did everything else fantastically. Took our order without writing it down. Great food, good bread, nice meal, but if you are looking for one of those places where they have a guy in the corner with a pitcher scanning the room for half empty water glasses, this ain't it."], ["Melissa F.", "This place is adorable and a great date night spot.

Don't get the Octopus if you don't like olives though. The dish is served with a really good sauce but plenty of olives in it. Great crispy pizza. Got the sausage with broccoli one.

Unfortunately, they're light years apart. Service was poor. They were too slow to clean the table. We had empty drink glasses sitting in front of us for an hour. We both ordered specialty cocktails- The New Old Fashioned. It was not good. Had a strong lemon flavor that was kind of bitter and not becoming of an Old Fashioned. Stuck with wine the rest of the evening. I began my meal with the ricotta meatballs, which were fine. Nothing mindblowing but well portioned and tender. Girlfriend began with the \"special\" chicken cream soup, which was the most flavorful thing either of us had all night. On to entrees. I had the porcini ravioli. I remember having this exact dish three years ago in Las Vegas. It was one of the richest, most flavorful pasta dishes I've ever had. I was so excited to learn it was on the Nashville menu. Unfortunately, it lacked any finesse and all I could taste was greasy butter coating my throat. My girlfriend's entree was where things really went bad though. She had the capellini with Pecorino-Romano, pepper and pistachio. It \u00a0tasted like an obscenely overcooked wad of noodles sitting in the starchy broth in which it was boiled. I think she got about three bites deep.She finished with the lemon tiramisu which was actually pretty good. With other Italian options in the city like Moto and Cafe Nonna, this joint ain't long for the Nashville world."], ["Carolyn M.", "Good food. \u00a0Great atmosphere. Average service.

When asked about the house wine, a five minute lecture on vino followed, with the house Pinot Noir described as \"dirt\" and the house Merlot was described as \"fruitful.\" The problem? Starting off an evening of \"fine\" dining feeling ignorant and scolded doesn't lend to the ambience of the restaurant. Now I admit readily, I am not a sommelier. But I also sheepishly admit that I have sipped a glass of wine...or two. I enjoy a fruity Merlot and I love my \"dirty, dirty\" Pinot Noir. So a tongue lashing in front of a table of eight was more than uncalled for. To round out the picture, my friend also got a scolding for asking about the menu. No lecture. But a scolding she \"did got.\" As for the menu, the food at Trattoria Il Mulino was nice. The pizza's are plentiful, as are the bowls of pasta. The calamari was beautiful, the sausage pizza was delicious and the rigatoni was perfection. We didn't linger for dessert. The food was too ample. My best advice for dining at Trattoria Il Mulino? Spending over fifty dollars a person for a humiliating tongue lashing by the \"Waitress Nazi\", even for food that is great, just isn't worth it. So if you are planning to dine at Trattoria Il Mulino in the future, refer to the review of Trip Advisor's \"NashvilleGal2011z' and ask for server Jason.

Our waiters (Clayton & Derek, I believe) were so wonderful to check with the chef for certain plates and make adjustments as needed. The atmosphere was very nice and intimate. Everything we ordered from the calamari to the spaghettini with the spicy crab and the limoncello tiramisu were absolutely heavenly!

I stopped in with my brother to have cocktails at the bar and the experience was so great that we returned the next night for dinner. The menu is extensive and interesting for an Italian restaurant. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 different dinner specials along with drinks and dessert. We arrived a bit before the standard dinner rush, so the chef prepared some special starters for our table that were't on the menu, simply to try - they were great! They serve serve small garlic breadsticks before dinner, which were tasty. Our meals were exceptional, especially the seafood. My only compliant is that the pizza was a bit salty and greasy for my liking (traditional Italian pizza never has oil over the top), but it was still good and definitely prepared with fresh ingredients and real mozzarella.

It's a big sandwich with 3 meatballs and he said that it tasted better than anything similar he'd ever had by far! I got the gnocchi and I couldn't believe how wonderfully it was made...it was like my grandmother used to make (I'm italian so I know what good italian is) plus since it was so filling, I took some home-which was still awesome later! My husband had the veal piccata and was simply blown away...he's had my grandmother's cooking before we were married years ago and I just about slapped him when he said it was just as good if not better than hers.As full as we were, we stuffed in the limoncello tiramisu and by good were we glad we did.Props to the chef and kitchen staff for competing with my tongue for Italian food that I grew up on and was made sure to know how to be a huge critic about.The atmosphere alone was incredible. With a large restaurant you normally don't get the feeling of privacy we experienced, and the attitude of the hosts and staff made us feel so welcome. Both the extensive wine list and display were very impressive, and we were greatly pleased with our cabernet and merlot. The servers were attentive, offered helpful suggestions and just made our time wonderful.So...If you haven't gone yet, definitely do make a trip!

The menu is very impressive and creates the anticipation of an authentic Italian meal but unfortunately that where it stops. This place is about the same as most places in middle America trying to pretend to be something they are not. The food at Moto is incredibly salty and every dish I had was covered in garlic to a point you could not even identify the food you were supposed to be enjoying. It's a sad but true realism that few Italian cooks outside of large cities in the US have the skills and courage to just cook good food with simple ingredients. Great Italian food is so pure to the ingredients and simplicity of the dish and unfortunately most restauranteurs completely miss the mark with bad renditions of simple foods. \u00a0I really wish more people would travel outside the U.S. because they would likely learn that food can be amazing and not just filling."], ["Mandy C.", "I'm lovin it!

Street First off I have to say that their execute chef Andy Hayes is top notch. Hhe trained at one of my all time favorite restaurants, Gramercy Tavern in New York. M. Street snapped up a good one!The inside of Moto is simply beautiful. Everything has clean lines, warm tones and soft lighting. They paid very close attention to every detail, including the inlaid patterns on the bar. They even have a rock bed open fireplace and a glass wine cellar. I sat at a booth and the booth seats were very comfortable, possibly the most comfortable booth I've ever sat in.To start off, the kitchen sent out four appetizers for all of us to sample. The first one out was duck fat olives. These were served warm with whole garlic cloves and orange zest. They were delicious, but anything covered in duck fat is delicious. I loved the temperature of the olives- just barely warm and very nice on the tongue.Next up was the pork cheek terrine with crispy pig ears. When we asked how this was made Chef Andy told us it was made with the whole head of the pig, and not just any pig, but a pig from Porter Road Butcher. It's good to know Moto gets their pigs whole from my favorite local butcher shop. This gets at least +10 awesome points. The terrine was creamy and spread easily on the crustini. I only wish they had more pig ears added for crunch; pig ears are always such a treat.Next up was the deep fried Apalachicola oysters with peperonata and preserved fennel. The topping reminded me of a lightly spiced chow-chow and added a really nice vinegar flavor to the fried oyster. Even someone at my table who said they don't enjoy oysters loved these!The last appetizer was the raw winter salad featuring shaved beets. I'm always skeptical of raw salads considering I've had a fair few that were disappointing, but this dish was simply divine. The vegetables were sliced so thin that they almost melted in your mouth. Add to that simple seasoning and blue cheese and you have yourself a winning raw salad. We were served two different pizzas: The porchetta and kale pesto with mozzarella, and the mushroom and black truffles with fontina. The mushroom pizza had a woodsy flavor that was enhanced by the sweetness of the shaved truffles. My favorite was the kale pesto slice, even though it was a tad bit too oily for me.First up was the gnocchi with crispy salsify and green apple in fonduta. This sauce was rich and paired well with the fresh crisp apple. The gnocchi themselves were light and pillowy and had a bouncy mouth texture. My favorite part was the crispy salsify, something I never tasted prepared in that fashion before.The next pasta was the black spaghetti with lobster and calabrian chilies. The squid ink pasta was thick and al dente with that sea flavor that makes black pasta so enjoyable. The lobster flavor was mild but the chilies added a nice kick.Chef Andy Hayes was nice enough to bring out a plate of their nightly pasta special. \u00a0The special was a sea urchin and scallop spaghetti in a light lemon cream sauce. This was far and away my favorite pasta dish. The sea urchin on top was so beautiful it brought tears of joy to my eyes and made this my favorite version of urchin that wasn't sushi-style!They brought out the main entree of chicken saltimbocca with sides of brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes. Unfortunately I found the chicken the most un-interesting dish of the evening. Compared to everything else it was just kind of \"meh.\" It was well-cooked, don't get me wrong, but it didn't blow my socks off (mind you I don't normally order chicken at restaurants because on my personal hierarchy of meats, it's on the bottom).The side dishes were so good that they totally overshadowed the chicken. The brussels sprouts were served crispy with panchetta and apple agrodolce. If you dine at Moto you must order the brussels sprouts, YOU MUST. The potatoes were nicely roasted with sun chokes, black truffle and some taleggio cheese. There was just a small amount of cheese, but it was so nice that I wish that they'd smothered the potatoes in it. We had two desserts. Gluttony, Ahoy! First was a Meyer lemon bundino (custard) with pistachio biscotti and a semolina shortbread. The custard was very light and fluffy. \u00a0The final dessert was the Moto take on chocolate tiramisu. It was made with amaretto gelee, chocolate cake and mascarpone mousse and a cookie crumble. T'll fully admit that I was spoiled at Moto. We had tons of amazing food, gracious and prompt service and our fill of red wine. I was very impressed with all of the food and how well-executed the event was. ** While I was provided this dinner gratis, all the opinions are honest and my own.**"], ["Ashley W.", "By far the best restaurant I ate at while visiting Nashville. From the time I walked in, the friendly staff was very accommodating. But the food...I'm still dreaming about it. Let's start with the focaccia bread. I don't think I could get it in my mouth fast enough. It was the right bit of salty and savory. We ordered the calamari and Waygu Beef meatball to start. I had never eaten Waygu beef before but I never want to not eat it again. Just phenomenal. I ordered the gnocchi and it was quite honestly the best I ever had. One of the girls I was with originally ordered the manicotti but our waitress told us it would take longer than expected. So she ordered something else. Well when the manicotti was finished, Chef Luke himself brought it out and apologized. We were blown away! Overall, it was an amazing experience and we left in a food coma. Loved everything from the atmosphere, to the wait staff, to Chef Luke, and to, of course, the incredible food. Go here, now!"], ["Becky Y.", "Moto is now on our \"go to\" list! We had a delightful evening of excellence - both food and service. Our party of 4 shared lots of plates and I loved getting to try so many new flavors. Inventive cocktails are becoming standard for the Nashville restaurant scene and ours did not disappoint. The appetizer that really stood out for us was the grilled artichokes - flavorful, tender but not mushy. The wagyu beef meatball finished a close second. The bread is amazing and I strongly suggest the olive oil flight to accompany it. Two pastas are worth mentioning: spinach fettuccine with lamb and the black spaghetti. Both were perfectly cooked and full of interesting and satisfying flavors. Surprisingly reasonably priced in the ever-competitive Gulch and smack dab in the middle of the insanity that befits M Street row, Moto shines as a cut above."]], "Five Points Pizza": [], "Demos' Restaurant": [["Jeff P.", "When we walked in we noticed a thick crowd. That didn't stop the bartender from serving us our drinks quickly as we waited a few minutes for a table. The restaurant seemed clean tidy and in order, the staff was friendly and welcoming. \u00a0Our server suggested that we order a Greek side salad which was really good. All the ingredients are fresh and the dressing was tasty my wife even got anchovies which she was surprised that she loved! We ordered a loaded baked potato with white cream sauce and chicken it was DIVINE. Also Lasagna which was very good.  Our check was very reasonable and we enjoyed the well versed staff. I feel comfortable recommending anyone in the area to check them out!"], ["Aa A.", "Carry out is simply amazing here. Big pans of food which is perfect for entertaining or taking a meal to a friend. It's a pre holiday tradition. Just wish there was one in cool springs!! Hint........"], ["Kat H.", "Went here past wkend for lunch with some girlfriends from Chicago, ordered the nachos to start with, and I don't know whose kid is in the back cause seriously looked like a 7 year old just grabbed cheap quality tortilla chips, chili beans, chicken, American cheese threw it in the microwave for 15 seconds and topped with sour cream. It was so gross, now that I am writing this review wish we took a pic of how sad it was but at the time didn't think it was picture worthy. I ordered the chicken Santa fe with zucchini and side of salad... the chicken and zucchini were ok, nothing amazing, was quite bland but edible so hey there's that, the 7 year old chef can cook chicken so props to u. My other friends ordered the pepper steak and the other ordered the chicken fettuccine, they both had similar reactions. The only thing that had flavor was the free bread. The star is simply for our waitress who was attentive to our table. Basically don't recommend at all, no flavor, no quality, save your money."], ["Jim H.", "When Jen told me we were going to Nashville TN for my birthday, \u00a0this was first choice. \u00a0 Excellent food and outstanding service. \u00a0 We both had steaks and they were excellent. \u00a0 Cheese toast as an appetizers and was outstanding. \u00a0 Been here 4 or 5 times always and excellent experience."], ["Nathan P.", "I have been visiting Demo's almost every time I come to Nashville for the past 11 years. I travel frequently for work, and am here a couple times a year at least. I'm usually dining alone, and usually because of my work schedule I am stopping in during non-peak times, between 2-5 pm for a late lunch/early dinner before running off to the airport. I read some other reviews here and was surprised to see how many people didn't like it. Maybe they aren't ordering what I do. But I've always found the service fabulous for a casual restaurant. There's a guy named Sully who's a waiter here who is one of the best I've ever had. Everyone is friendly, and my food always comes out super-fast. Here's what I order:Top sirloin (pick your size) - and yes they can manage to cool it medium+!Skip the salad, get the soup. Protip: put a couple forks full of the park cheese in your soul and stir it up. I also have them add the fresh pepper. \u00a0Then also use it to dip your bread in. \u00a0And that break, ahh, wonderful!Then get it with a spaghetti as a side. I actually always order a second side of a different flavor, because I have a big appetite. Another pro-tip: they will add mushrooms to the Brown Butter Garlic sauce for free!That's pretty much all I always order. \u00a0My service is always great and very prompt, and my steak is always perfectly seared and cooked. \u00a0And the price is so good I feel like I'm stealing."], ["Jean K.", "Oh, sweet Brown Butter Garlic Sauce. Get over here. You alone are worth 5 shining stars but the fast, friendly service that brought you to me gets 5 stars, too. And, the sample plate of bread with 5 sauces for newbies? Well, that gets 5 stars. But, wait. The tiny bill for such a delicious meal served up with some real southern hospitality deserves another 5 stars. Unbeatable value. Sweet Brown Butter Garlic Sauce, I think I love you."], ["Hope D.", "If I wanted to eat diarrhea, I'd go to Taco Bell.This place has the largest menu of shit I've ever seen. So many options of culinary excrement to choose from. Seriously, the food is extremely bland. It was like everything I ordered tasted exactly the same...which is bad.Stays in business because back in the day there were very few options to choose from, now old people crowd the place because it's \"tradition\" for them, and tourists go here because they don't know any better."], ["Crystal O.", "We ate dinner here while on our vacation and it was fantastic. I eat at the restaurant each time that I visit downtown Nashville Tn. They have a huge menu and the prices are great. They have great chicken and rice soup and my favorite entree is the seafood alfredo. Our waiter suggested the Resses dessert and it was great! I was recommend that everyone try this restaurant while visiting downtown Nashville."], ["Brett H.", "So I was really interested in this place due to their spaghetti sampler with their different sauces. I'm a big fan of sauces. The ones I had were ok. The one with the blacken chicken was great. The brown butter was meh and the meat sauce was also meh. The girl behind the bar was a bit cooky for me."], ["Will H.", "Pretty good for cheap eats. I ordered the steak and it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. \u00a0The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, however the wait staff made extra efforts to be friendly and provide goos service. \u00a0I did however notice a lot of young kids standing around trying to look busy, but weren't. \u00a0I server was fairly new to the restaurant business and it showed, but she still gets an A for effort.I would definatley go here again the next time I'm in Nashville."], ["Kenyatta W.", "Four stars because our Server , Austin was fantastic. He actually made the evening delightful. \u00a0Some people have a knack for customer service, and putting people at ease, and also being funny; without being over-the-top. Austin has that gift.As for the food it was average bordering on good. The atmosphere was nice, warm intimate and I could tell that people really enjoyed being there. The rib eye was tasty, well seasoned, very nice portion. My lasagna was okay not bad not good and I probably wouldn't order it again. The rolls were a light and fluffy and had a very nice flavor. I also had the chicken rice soup; it was nice light and not to filling. I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip back unless I wanted to enjoy the company of Austin.Give it a try. It's an experience. And the prices and portions are a phenomenal value."], ["Mike R.", "Price wasn't a factor when we entered, but it made up for the 12\" hair on my steak, steak was cooked well and the pasta was fine. A pitiful wine selection, and out of three or four of them. Service was adequate and friendly. Would not return, not bad, just nothing memorable."], ["Holly G.", "My boyfriend and I had some friends in town over the weekend, and they wanted to hit up Broadway (naturally) so we decided to come to Demos before. I had heard a mixed bag of things about this place beforehand, so I went in fairly optimistic. It was around 7:00 on a Friday night, so it was fairly busy and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes before a table was ready. Not terrible.I wanted to give this place a better review, but 2 stars means \"meh\" and that's kind of how I felt about the whole thing. The one thing that was above average was the service. Our server was excellent, super nice, checked in just the right amount of times, seemed knowledgeable. Overall, no complaints there.The drink I got from the bar (something with cranberry and vodka) was pretty good, but it's kinda hard to mess that up. The bread they bring out beforehand is actually pretty good. Definitely high on the butter scale, but hey, butter makes everything better. At least Paula Deen thinks so.I opted to go with the Bacon Wrapped Filet (not filet mignon of course) with grilled zucchini and added grilled mushrooms and onions to the steak. The salad they bring out before the meal is basically the bagged stuff you buy at the store. Hmm.Let me say that this place does not have a shortage of butter. Everything with my entree was soaked in it. Listen, I love butter as much as the next person. But, I kinda don't want a heart attack before I turn 30. If I do ever come back, that's definitely something I will mention beforehand... The steak was slightly underdone (I got medium rare) but nothing crazy, and not enough for me to send it back.This place is just meh. The food is just alright, but the prices are really good. Between my boyfriend and I, we spent about $40 before tip. And that was with my $9 cocktail and a $4 beer. So $27 for both of our meals. Not bad at all. Just wish the quality was a little bit better for the price."], ["Kathy J.", "Read the reviews and decided this was the place for us. \u00a0(We were planning to hit Broad Street after dinner, hence something a little heavier than usual into the tummies!).Our experience was wonderful. \u00a0We sat at the bar and had the best service from Leanne and Lexi that we have had in years.Food and drinks were great.My husband had the pork chop special, loved it! \u00a0I had the two topping spaghetti, wonderful. \u00a0Small, but good salads come with the meal. \u00a0 Did I mention the bread, warm, fresh, excellent.Now that we have extended our visit to Nashville, we will definitely be returning."], ["Eric W.", "Fantastic for large groups. \u00a0They accommodated 18 of us in just 15 minutes without the call ahead RSVP. \u00a0Great value and portion sizes. \u00a0Disappointed in the steaks - the filet cuts were cooked to order, but the KC strips and Ribeyes were cooked to medium/medium well \u00a0and ordered as Medium Rare. \u00a0Recommend go for the pasta and amazing garlic bread."], ["Edith K.", "After hearing many reviews about how \"amazing\" this place was we decided to try it out tonight.... let's just say, we were far from impressed.The one good thing was that we were seated as soon as we walked in the door, we somehow beat the crowd. Although, it did take a bit before our order was actually taken. I ordered the lasagna, my husband got the Cajun chicken sandwich, my daughter ordered the all you can eat soup of the children's menu. I was highly disappointed with the lasagna. It didn't seem fresh, the mozzarella wasn't even \"melty\", it tasted very much like day old lasagna that had just been sitting there. Very, very bland. I make MUCH better lasagna at home. My husband stated his chicken sandwich was dry, not to mention the half a bar of butter they placed on his, not very hot, baked potato. The one person to walk away, happy with their meal, was my little girl. She totally dug the baked chicken soup.We do not plan on going back, and I probably won't suggest it to anyone else. I don't know if we went on an \"off\" night or what, but we were disappointed. Not too sure what all the hype's about...."], ["angela l.", "Chicken salad was kind of over- killed. Chicken rice soup was pretty good. Great Service kind of made up for the disappointment in food though."], ["Kendall B.", "I really wanted to like this place because the people there are so nice but I just didn't. \u00a0The prices are great and so are the rolls. Meatball app is very good as well. We had blackened chicken pasta and lasagna. \u00a0The pasta just didn't taste good and the lasagna was stone cold. I suspect the lasagna had been microwaved. Skip this place for sure."], ["Danny N.", "Giving Demos' four starts for two reasons. \u00a0If you are downtown they get you in and out quickly even if it's super crowded. \u00a0Secondly the food is pretty cheap with meals being around $10. \u00a0The food is good. \u00a0The food is about a 7/10, but based on the price and location it's a good choice."], ["Shawn P.", "Nothing fancy - a delicious 12 oz sirloin at a reasonable price. Spaghetti on the side is a surprising touch. Eschewed a table to sit at the bar - service was fantastic. Total cost - $20."]]}
