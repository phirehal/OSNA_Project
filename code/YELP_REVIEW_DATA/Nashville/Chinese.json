I wonder how much of that is the inner Californian in me speaking. Anyways, we took my parents here last night because they love eating out but hate spending too much money. I figured that this place with $$ and the handy Yelp deal is quite a good offer.The decor is fine but not really something to extensively comment about. There was ample seating and at 5:00 p.m. it did not seem like there were too many people rushing in to eat. I realized we went in for an early dinner and by the time we were leaving, there were quite a few other patrons. There are some booths and a couple of round tables. 'The service was mediocre. Our server looked a little nervous and my dad's soup was dripping on the sides. They were a little slow; for example, we would ask about the soups or to get the check and they would take a while (more than 5 minutes) to get back at us with the answers. Honestly, we did not mind waiting but just felt that it could have been faster given that there were not that many people. We ordered the egg-flower soup which was kind of bland. We also got the hot-and-sour soup which was a little more zesty and yum! I enjoyed their vegetable rolls but felt like it was a little expensive to pay $1 for each of them. Additionally, we got the Kung Pao shrimp and beef and vegetables. I liked the beef and vegetables better because the beef was soft and there was a wide variety of veggies. My family liked the Kung-Pao shrimp more because it had more flavors but I felt like it was filled with lots of celery- something that you either love or hate and I just don't like it.

Yes there was only 2 carts moving around but that was appropriate for the number of tables that were seated at the time. Also, there were a few servers walking around with trays of offerings not on the cart to give you additional options. The food quality was great. I thought it was exactly what dim sum should be.

Usually at dim sum places, they put fresh tea leaves in a pot of water for you. Here, they pre-made the tea. It was not fresh. The shrimp dumplings were nothing like the pictures. They were old and dry and seemed like they have sat in the carts for awhile. The noodles with barbecue pork were also old and dry. The only thing that was decent here were the steamed pork buns because we ordered them to be made.When our check came, the total was $30 for 6 plates. That was WAY OVERPRICED.

Since the rest of the order was what was expected we ate that. Then in less than an hour my stomach got upset. I was so sick to my stomach, I am still feeling the repercussions of eating there. Such a shame - Nashville needs a place with a great selection of dim sum that does not lead to anaphylactic shock or humbling bathroom visits."], ["Kina L.", "I think the only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because my expectations for Dim Sum are ridiculously high given that I came from Atlanta. Yesterday, due to the RIDICULOUS lines at the Hot chicken festival, my friend and I thought the next closest thing to fire battered chicken was clearly chicken feet dim sum (which actually was one of the better dishes).So in regards to their dim sum. The have a very limited variety--sticking to your basics such as your char siu bao (steam bun with chargrilled pork), shrimp dumplings, siu mai (a pork dumpling pretty much), pork crepes, chicken feet, sticky rice and egg rolls (I would not order this). The chicken feet were clearly cooker pressured and heavily sauced..which made them relatively fall off the bone delicious-- the best of the dim sum choices. I was disappointed that the selection was also not very fresh. It seemed to sit in a cart for the duration of the lunch rush. Understandable given the low volume. In addition to dim sum, we ordered the singapore curry noodles. They were very generous with the shrimp and chicken in this order. I thought it had great flavor. Definitely would not call it a low fat dish as you can see the glisten on the noodles. This was my favorite dish of the meal. I will have to come back to try the hot pot that I saw many order. Good points to know: Thursday night for 20 dollars.. you can experience a multi course Szechuan meal- great intro for those not familiar with that style of cooking. Also, Lucky Bamboo is BYOB. WHAT. yeah. I know a lot of people say this is the most authentic chinese in Nashville... they are actually probably right. But that doesn't really say much other then that simple statement. \u00a0I will have to come back again to sample more redeeming dishes.. and hopefully the secret ones off the menu...But as I like to end on a positive note... service was very attentive and great.

I don't go to Asian restaurants for the scenery or service... and if you do.. clearly you aren't looking for some home cooking."], ["Marc J.", "OK. I am Chinese and this was literally the worst \"Chinese\" restaurant I have tried in this country. Where should I start? We stopped by on a Sunday morning to have dim sum.

Their Sunday hours was from 10am but when we walked in at 10:15 was told that dim sum was not ready yet because they \"had to cook\" it. Their dim sum selection was extremely limited and food quality was very poor. They also charged us $11 for a regular-sized tea pot, which was insane.

The dim sum did not taste fresh first of all. Items were lukewarm, probably sitting out for a while. But it wasn't like we went at 3pm. We went right at noon! The soupy dumplings were the biggest disappointment...the shell was dried out and hard. Roasted pork was almost cold and had no flavor. The pork buns were okay, but they were just the generic frozen ones you can get at any Asian market. The spare ribs were extremely fatty and chewy. Some were inedible because they were too chewy. I will give them kudos for trying to be authentic, and offering chicken feet. \u00a0They were okay, but overall waaaay too sweet.Price was not as bad as I thought it would be, but generally higher compared with other cities, which is understandable, I guess.I would never go back for the dim sum, but may try one more time for their regular menu."], ["Courtney C.", "Service was fine, even was nice.

We ordered the sliced tendon cold app, sliced beef and tripe cold app, soupy beef and braised port belly with pickled mustard greens. The owner even threw in a pig ear app for free!

The little town I grew up in had some of the best Chinese food (BBQ spare ribs for the win!) and I was only a short train ride away from NYC's Chinatown. All the dim sum and bean cakes I could stomach were at my disposal. Upon moving to Nashville, all of my dumpling dreams where shattered (well, at least until I found my favorite local Chinese place China Cottage). Lucky Bamboo (recently reopened with the folks from Green Hills' Chinatown) brings a little bit of New York Chinese style down to Nashville. They serve dim sum on the weekends, but on this cold night we went for their specialty: THE HOT POT.The inside of this place is crazy. It almost reminds me of a Disney themed restaurant in the Chinese portion of EPCOT, or something you might find in Vegas. There is a giant rock fountain in the center of the dining room filled to the brim with really pretty koi. Opposite the bamboo covered bar is a full wall mural of pandas. Pandas just hanging out, having fun and watching you eat. I could have sworn that their eyes followed me around the room. The place is big, with only half of it being used for diners. Behind a partition is another large dining space with what appears to be a stage and karaoke setup just begging to be used. I wonder if this part of the space will ever be used to serve diners, or perhaps it's just for private parties.To start we had small BBQ pork dumplings. They took a while to arrive at our table (an appetizer that arrived with the main dishes) but they were solid dumplings. The dough was thick and substantial without being so fluffy that it overpowered the fillings. The special of the day was Szechuan pigs feet. Luckily for me I went with a group of friends that are adventurous eaters like myself and it was a no-brainer to order this. The pigs feet were cooked slow and low and then stir fried with the hottest of peppers, peanuts and celery. Pigs feet, if you've never had it, have a very odd texture- a mixture of skin, fat and cartilage. I loved them especially because they soaked up all the flavor and were super tender. This dish was HOT. If you accidentally ate one of the red peppers your mouth was ON FIRE.The main course was the Ying Yang hot pot (this was half of the mild house soup and half of the scorching hot Szechuan soup). Hot pot, if you're not familiar with it, is similar to fondue or shabu-shabu. You're served a boiling hot pot of broth that is kept at temperature with a portable burner, and you select various vegetables, meats, and noodles which you boil in the broth. This is a fabulous meal for a cold night and an even better meal when you go with a group of friends. Hot pot is communal and it's best when you get to order a lot of things and share!The basics for the hot pot are cabbage, spinach, corn, tomatoes, pumpkin, mushrooms and some crab sticks. In addition to this you're given a menu for what you can put in your hot pot and you pay by the ingredient. We ordered so many things that they didn't fit on the table- but here's a list of all the goodies that went into our hot pot:beeflambjumbo prawnfried tofutarobok choienoki mushroombamboo shootwoodear mushroomudon noodlesWe tended to put the stuff that takes longer to cook into the pot first, like the pumpkin and taro. The meat cooked in under a minute and the cabbage seemed to soak up all of the spice. When things are done you just kind of dig in with a ladle or your chopsticks and pull out what you want. I had fun fishing for things and yelling out \"I found a taro, who wants taro?\" I honestly loved the hot soup better, mostly because I like the punishment of the hot peppers.Overall I really enjoyed the hot pot and I would go back for it any time. Even with ordering all of that food our checks were still fairly cheap (split between 5 about $15 per person). Jennifer, our waitress was helpful, polite, and happy to explain everything to us hot pot novices. When next winter rolls around I'm sure I'll want a hot pot just as frequently as pho.

Hong Kong no coupon. \u00a0Amelica always coupon. \u00a0Amelica no money.\"\"You eat like this. \u00a0Put pork in here like sandwich. \u00a0Velly good. \u00a0I work with chefs so I smart - I know what good.\"\"You want chopstick?\" \u00a0Yes, please. \u00a0\"Ah yes - chopstick good. \u00a0No fork ok. \u00a0Chopstick numba one.\"\"You want dessert? \u00a0Ah yes - I make special for you. \u00a0Taro. \u00a0You know Taro? \u00a0I make for you velly good.\" \u00a0He made us a special dessert that wasn't on the menu and it was fantastic.We will probably return for the dim sum carts on the weekend. \u00a0The single entree we did order was authentically tasty so I'm excited to try more. \u00a0Depending on our future dim sum experience, I may be updating my review, but for now - it was all \"velly good.\""], ["Jack T.", "this is a fantastic restaurant! excellent service and very delicious Chinese food!my wife and I came from Canton and this is one of the best Chinese restaurant I visited in US.

The general was amazing. It was crispy and was packed with flavor. Not like the other places where it tastes like it had been in the freezer to long. It's near my house also! Found my new Chinese takeout."], ["Rick B.", "Disclaimer here: I grew up in New York City, and my friend's grandma owned a nice Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. And the best Chinese restaurants on the East Coast in the 1970s were a subway ride away in Chinatown. When I moved to Michigan, my sister in law was good friends with a family that owned one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Detroit area, and they catered our rehearsal dinner for my wedding. So I've been spoiled.Getting good Chinese in Middle Tennessee is an uphill battle. The ones I've tried all seem to be buying mediocre ingredients from the same suppliers. And Yelp isn't much help because, no offense, but folks around here who haven't traveled have no idea how good Chinese can be when produced with techniques learned in the mother country with the best ingredients. My final complaint (then I'll stop, I promise) is that the favored business model for a Chinese restaurant in Middle Tennessee is buffet or take-out or both. And that's just not conducive to serving the best food.All that said, I walked into Chopstick House on a day when I was recovering from a headcold and just needed something hot and spicy to clear my head and make me feel better. As our family friends in Michigan used to say, in the Chinese culture they believe certain spices are \"good for the breathing\" and I don't care what science says, they have always been proven right in my case. Chopstick House is a counter-service/takeout place, with about a dozen tables and chairs, and they will bring your food to your table if you are dining in.The General Tso's Chicken and a cup of Hot and Sour Soup did the trick. The chicken was cooked right, with a hot, fast heat so it was cooked without drying, and the sauce was complex and flavorful, as it should be. The soup was brothy, not gummy (A gummy soup is a sign they are using thickeners to stretch the dish and cut costs). It was a lunch combo, so it came with pork fried rice which was nice, not greasy, though not as loaded with veggies and pork as I would like.All this for about the same price as a burger combo meal at a fast-food chain, so definitely an upgrade from that.Chopstick House is doing it right so far.

This is the tastiest General Tso's I've had so far; the sauce is just perfect. Typically when I eat General Tso's Chicken, the sauce is either too sweet or too strong such that it's really good the first couple of bites, and the next ones become really hard to swallow. Not the case with this restaurant. Fried noodles and rice were also fantastic. It's great for take away but not good for dine in. The place fits probably only about 20 people.

They use fresh ingredients and leave out the parts that are meant to be left out - I can't tell you how many times I've been served parts of the celery, onion and carrot that should have been thrown away at other local chinese places - Chopstick House has no such issues. Their pricing is also very competitive, especially if you order shrimp dishes. Shrimp main courses feature decently sized shrimp - they use small shrimp for fried rice, lo mein and mei fun. I also think they fry their food well - egg rolls aren't soggy with grease, fried chicken dishes are made to order and not pre-fried.I have one gripe: I am not a fan of their spice scale. They do tend towards the bland side of spicy, which means you should request more spice if you're into it. I don't blame them, I blame Nashville for that one. Totally recommended for take-out Chinese. Also, they have Chinese style sweet tea, which is syrupy sweet and delicious.

But its all in the taste. Each cook is different and some can be bland, but this place has full flavor in their food. I love the fried dumplings and they have really tasty egg rolls and spring rolls. Other places I've tried you can tell it was frozen or they just had the food sitting out.This place cooks to order on the spot. It only takes less than 10min if you walk in to order.

What a waste of money. I went in knowing that I wasn't going to have the best sushi of my life for $9.82, but I didn't expect to leave angry, hungry and not tip. I don't think I've ever done that before. The presentation was the sloppiest I've ever seen. Isn't sushi supposed to be asian art on a plate? There was spicy mayo everywhere and normally, I'm ok with that, but this spicy mayo was not good. It was not at all creamy or spicy. It looked like it came out of a jar for $1. The place looked decent inside, but I was surprised when I walked in and there was not a customer in sight. That should have been a red flag.

The rangoons were unfortunately not what I was looking for; the pastry tasted like frozen pre-made and there was nothing remotey crab-y about the filling. Even the cheese tasted a bit off. I'd have to give 2 stars for the appetizer.Fortunately, the main attraction was considerably better. I particularly enjoyed the array of vegetables which livened the plate up. The noodles, while far from awe-inspiring, weren't terrible either. My big problem with this plate was the proteins.

Just get the Orange Peel; it's less salty than most. -You can get your chicken steamed instead of fried. For some reason they call this \"velvet.\" -The brown rice is much better than the white.

Until then and that said, Chinatown offers up a lot to enjoy -- you just have to know how to order. The restaurant tries to straddle the line between authentic and Americanized and the trouble comes in trying to serve two masters.

The Chinese restaurant that capitalizes off the influx of and demand from foodies (hate that word) will win big.And, again, what you get out of Chinatown is directly proportional to what you put in.

I really like this place. We order pretty much the same thing every time we go. Start with the green onion pancakes and crab ragoons. Both are always hot and delicous. They aren't greesy and are served with appropriate (and different) sauces. For mains, we always order off menu general tso's beef, beef belly in hot pot and either sizzling beef or mongolian beef. The beef belly in hot pot is amazing - it comes out already boiling in this beautfiul stew sauce, large beef chucks braised down and tender and served with baby bok choy thats been still holding its form with a bit of crunch but soft and tender - so delish! For chinese food in Nashville, this is the place to go!"], ["Annabelle A.", "Overall, a solid place for Chinese in Green Hills & very convenient if you work nearby.Atmosphere: Clean, pretty quiet, & nicely decorated.Service: Polite, friendly, attentive.Food: Mixed. I've found a few great dishes that are my go-to (Mongolian beef is my favorite!) Some others have been very average (the lo mein is not that great). You get a lot for the price with the lunch specials & their egg flower soup and eggrolls are good.Note: The last time I ordered online, it didn't work. The order went through successfully online, but when I arrived to pick up my food, the worker informed me that their online ordering wasn't working. I had to waste 10 min. of my lunch break while they made my food. **Always order by phone just to be safe!"], ["Cheery M.", "The owner is very nice to us, we have a good experience to eat there, we will back when we get chance to go to TN again:))"], ["Coco D.", "Egg rolls a joy as always, but....they've gotten smaller so if you're looking for nice size egg rolls this isn't the place.

Now onto the food - good mix of meat vs. vegetarian dishes, generous portion sizes.So for the Nashville area, it is pretty good. \u00a0But graded on my collective experience of Chinese dining - it is A-OK. \u00a0 \u00a0Every time the craving hits, this is my go to place.

I will say the restaurant itself is very well kept and clean and the staff are extremely friendly but the food itself is average. I ordered the Orange Chicken with fried rice and my girlfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken with Lo Mein. The Lo Mein was very good I must say but the fried rice was on the bland side. Both main meals were good but the funny thing was both the Orange Chicken as well as the General Tso's tasted and looked identical. Overall the food was ok but I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food."], ["Shannon M.", "Great!

Dismal, depressing. The workers were morose, unfriendly, unprofessional. The food was just not worth that. I had a sushi lunch, which was expensive, made worse by the quality. $19 for the sushi lunch. Our favorite spot, Sakura in Franklin, is $8.95 for the same lunch, and 10 times better. My son got a fried rice, his usual. He was not impressed. No one ever spoke to us, everything was done with grumpy face and hand gestures. Then it seemed as if they were unsure who would serve us, so that took a while. Our waitress never came back, ever. Despite this I left a 15% tip, and she found out right away because after I filled it out, she picked it up and looked at it. *&#%! Really? Cardinal waitressing sin. That has happened to me one other time, ever. Ironically both times when the waitresses were mediocre at best. I would never ever go back. I would not recommend at all. I like to try to find little independently owned places like that, but that was bad. I will try to find another place for our Green Hills days."], ["Joe C.", "There are not enough words to describe how delicious this place is. I've never tasted a bad dish.

Never have I tasted something so delicious."], ["Kara C.", "The food was pretty good. Bubble tea is great! Service left us looking at each other every time she walked away.

Chinatown Restaurant is for people who are looking for- and appreciate- traditionally cooked Chinese food. Don't go here looking for Americanized dishes like general tso and orange chicken or else you'll miss out on a wonderful opportunity to try excellent Chinese dishes.We went on a busy Saturday night, but I was impressed how helpful and polite the staff was! You didn't get that feeling that they were completely overwhelmed. The restaurant was run very smoothly. The food was absolutely delicious. I tried a little bit of everything my group got, and it was hard to pick a favorite because everything was so tasty! The roasted duck was delicous, and it seemed like everyone was really impressed with an eggplant dish we had. The tofu dishes were excellent. Even if you think you don't like tofu, try it here! Same with the duck! This is a place for trying new things and experiencing different food.Take a look at the menu and do some research before you come so you don't get so overwhelmed that you just order the same old Lo Mein, orange chicken, etc. Don't be afraid to try something authentic!Also...BUBBLE TEA! I was so happy to have bubble tea again! If you have never tried it, definitely give it a try!"], ["Mark S.", "I've been here lots of times but always ended up eating the food before remembering to take pictures! \u00a0Probably because I know how good it is. Went again today and it was the normal experience. Great food. Great service. Was in the mood for a potato dish that I used to eat in China so I asked the server and she spoke to the chef and he made it for me off menu. It's that type of place. If they can do it they will. Also got the chicken and tofu in peppers (can't remember the name in the menu). The sweet pea leafs which is my fav veggie. The scallion pancake and then the mapo tofu. They make my mapo with Sichuan peppercorns which is the only way to eat it as it really spices it up. Ate everything and will be in a food coma for the next day or so but it is really worth it. It might not be Chengdu but this is as close to authentic Sichuan cuisine that you will find in Nashville. Yummy yummy."], ["Tracy F.", "In a town where great Chinese food simply does not exist, Chinatown is pretty darn delicious and the closest we've got.We ate here for lunch today after 18 months of living in Nashville. \u00a0How it took us so long, we'll never know! \u00a0We came after an intense workout and were HUNGRY, so we were able to sample quite a few items on the menu and enjoyed nearly everything we ate.I chose the Mongolian Chicken lunch special, which came with brown rice, egg drop soup and a chicken spring roll. \u00a0It was a great deal for less than $7, and while the portion was small, everything that came with my lunch was freshly prepared and piping hot. \u00a0The soup was nicely flavored and not too salty, but the Mongolian Chicken was greasier than I like, especially because I asked for the dish to be prepared with as little oil as possible.The fiance ordered Black Bean Chicken - a favorite of his from his lifetime of living in NYC - as well as the steamed dumplings. \u00a0He very much enjoyed his chicken, though remarked that something was missing that made it different from what he's used to. \u00a0However, he did like the nice pop of spice that Chinatown added to their recipe and said he'd order the dish again. \u00a0The fiance was also excited for the steamed dumplings, which he thought might be similar to the soup dumplings he misses so much from NYC. \u00a0They were indeed similar, though smaller and less soup-filled than the ones he loves. \u00a0Again, though, he'd order them upon returning to Chinatown.Though we both enjoyed our food, we were a little put off by the service we received. \u00a0We found our waitress to be flippant and unfriendly, and we never received the soup noodles, oranges, or fortune cookies we saw other tables receiving when ordering similar items. \u00a0Considering we ordered from both the lunch and dinner menus and paid a nice (though reasonable) price for our lunch, we were disappointed that we didn't receive the same treatment as the other customers in the restaurant.Regardless, for Chinese food that actually tastes like Chinese food, we'll be coming back soon for more."], ["Dani B.", "It was alright. I ordered steamed dumplings, chicken fried rice, and egg rolls with a boba tea. I have nothing to really complain about, per se, but nothing to really rave about either. It was just... average.Even though I didn't really order anything too adventurous, I was still surprised by how bland the fried rice and the dumplings were. I pretty much had to drown everything in sweet & sour and soy sauce. The bubble tea was delicious, but you can't really mess something like that up.Overall, I probably won't go out of my way to go here again like I did this time around."], ["Charlie S.", "We stopped here after shopping at the mall and Parnassus Books. \u00a0The atmosphere was very pleasant and comfortable. \u00a0The employees were all welcoming, warm, and helpful. \u00a0The food was amazing! \u00a0I had the pan fried dumplings and they were the best I had ever had. \u00a0I also had the General Tso's Chicken which was also great. \u00a0The portions were large and everything tasted fresh. \u00a0Finally the prices were slightly higher than normal Chinese restaurants but this was a much better experience in a nicer part of town so it was definitely worth it."], ["Austin H.", "A year ago I ordered from here and was blown away by the quality and service. Since then I've gone back three times, each time hoping for that same experience. I usually order either General Tso's or Sesame Chicken (basic americanized dishes, I know). A couple little things before I address the food- I always order to-go and haven't been given utensils or napkins since my first visit. It's not a big deal of course, but the little things go a long way.The last three times I've ordered, the meat has either been such low quality that it's tough to eat or so deeply fried and such small pieces of chicken that there's almost no real food. I've gone out of my way to give this place more chances time and time again and I would love to have a reliable Chinese restaurant in Nashville, but I'm left feeling like this is not it. Unfortunately, I don't know of any great alternative.

The service also really pleasant. I agree with earlier reviews that it's maybe a little overpriced, but it's a lot of food, easily enough to make two meals of my one order. I'll definitely eat here again."], ["Mark T.", "Had a horrible experience last time and said never again, but recently, it was late, we were tired, so on a whim we did takeout. Glad we did because the meal was MUCH improved. The egg drop (egg flower) soup was back to normal; temperature was just right, and tasty.

But after visiting Chinatown for my first time yesterday, I am hooked!My fiance and I were both craving Chinese food recently after I finished my shift at work, so we decided to visit Chinatown and have an early lunch. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and I loved the environment of the restaurant. Our waitress took our order (I ordered Chicken Fried Rice and an order of dumplings, and he ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and an order of crab rangoons) and even brought us wonton soup and an egg roll on the house! Wonton soup is one of my favorite soups and it was delicious, and so was the egg roll.Our food was brought to us very quickly. I had never tried crab rangoons before, so I was definitely excited to try them. Both the rangoons and the dumplings were delicious! The chicken fried rice was amazing...I almost couldn't finish my plate because the portions were so big. My fiance's sweet and sour chicken looked quite appetizing, and it was nice to see that they put the sauce on the side instead of slathering it all over the chicken like I see in typical Chinese restaurants.All in all, I had a great experience and hope to visit again soon!"], ["Sam L.", "#1 or #2 for most authentic Chinese food in Nashville. Complementary soup was large portion when we did family style for 6 people. Saut\u00e9ed sweet tea leaves and bok choi was tasty and delicious. Pork belly was a great cut of meat and the fat was buttery smooth. The chitlins with tofu could have used a little more spiciness but overall was well done. Bubble tea is also available and good.The roast duck should be avoided; overcooked and dry. Also more bone than meat/fat combination.Overall, the food is excellent for the reasonable prices. I hope they keep it up."], ["Tennessee P.", "Called in a take out order for sesame chicken, fried rice and an egg roll. Food was ready in less than 10 minutes, and the lady at the front & phone was very courteous and friendly. The fried rice was garbage. The pieces of chicken were really small and hard. Little to no sauce. Finally, the egg roll was like the size of a stick of gum! Now, I could easily deal with all of this for a cheapo price like $4.99 plus tax or something, but this meal was $10 and change! Ridiculous.
