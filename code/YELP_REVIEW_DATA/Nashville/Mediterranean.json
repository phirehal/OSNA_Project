The falafel sandwich had four falafel balls in if - generous, lots of salad in there as well, but it was under filled for the pita they put it in. Something about the normal tzatziki sauce was terribly bitter and sour and off putting as well, so I couldn't finish it and had to separate the pita from the falafel. I'm not sure if this is a onetime issue or if it's a general issue with their normal tzatziki - I've never had sauce that was bitter/sour before. I only paid $5, which made it less disappointing, but I wish I had been able to have some semblance of a lunch."], ["Pat S.", "Good place for Greek fast food!! Had Greek salad with chicken.

Their fries aren't the shoe-string golden yellow fries like McDonald's or wedge cut like at a steakhouse. They are reddish orange medium sized fries (think Arby's but not curly). It is well seasoned and comes made to order so you get them hot. They do get packed especially during the lunch hour but it is worth it. They also have really good falafel.

I was the only customer. The guy working behind the counter was a bit abrasive but was efficient in making my falafel sandwich. I skipped the fries and opted for a side of hummus and some pita bread instead. Throw in a 20 ounce bottle of Diet Coke and you have a little combo meal for $7.50 including tax.

It tasted fresh and alive compared to some bland pastes that I have had from stores and lesser joints.Baba Ghannoush: bright flavors of the roasted eggplant, a bit tart, really good.Grape leaves: made on site the owner said (most just take them out of a can), not too chewy, good vegetarian dolmas.Falafel - made fresh with good spices and flavors, hot out of the oil as they should be. Take the extra time and get him to make them fresh.Kibbe: not as exciting - ground lamb fried in a wheat crust kind of like falafel.So: stick to the vegetarian basics and you will be happy.I didn't try any of the shawarma/gyro style plates, and they were missing some good middle eastern staples, like foul and lebneh.

There's no real rhyme or reason to how they operate, and this can lead to standing in line for a good 8-10 minutes to get your food. Another drawback is that everything is served on styrofoam plates- I shouldn't have to explain how awful styrofoam is for the environment. Honestly they just need more staff and a better, more organized assembly line system for the lunch rush.

Sat with empty drinks for 10 minutes - thankfully we had a great group of friends but the lack of service was difficult to ignore.During the delay, I decided to go inside and \"find\" our server, who was very casually standing, at the server/POS station with the other servers, making jokes/laughing/doing nothing...I asked for a drink order and was told to \"wait a minute.\" \u00a0UGHEventually - 2 pretentious servers later - we got our second round. And food. The food was WONDERFUL, as usual. \u00a0Although IMHO the squid/octopus in the pasta was overdone, and there was far too much salt in (probably) the pasta water...because adding pancetta/seafood to a dish which has already been heavily salted, was a bit too much for 3/4 of us. Just saying :/Finally...I used to serve, I used to run a kitchen; it's just a total bummer when such a place doesn't have the service to keep up! \u00a0TIP: when food hits the table, servers--- CHECK BACK WITH YOUR TABLE(S) within \"two bites or two minutes\" of the food arriving. I will go back. I will expect better next time!!! \u00a0Especially for a $300 dinner."], ["Paul M.", "This restaurant is hands down one of the best i've ever been to. The smoked trout & the pork verde pasta are amazing. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in or going to Nashville."], ["Monica L.", "I thought I was a crusty cynical foodie... and then I had dinner here. It has been a long time since I have been utterly delighted with every aspect of a meal. What a joy to be completely surprised by a first bite/sip.Springfield cocktail: Broker's gin, Pimm's, lemon, orange shrub, cucumber, good people IPALight, refreshing, slightly sweet, herbaceous, fruity, and so well balanced you'd think there wasn't any alcohol in there (oh, but there was). The IPA lends a flowery/hoppy note, the Pimm's adds that herbal quality, and I thought I didn't even like gin!App: Chicken liver pate, currant mostarda, baby brassicas, toastThey should package that currant mustarda. I'd put that sh*t on everything! (Like on a panini with goat cheese or something.)Entree: Squid ink campanelle, FL squid, shrimp, nduja, basil, sourdough breadcrumbsThe squid/shrimp/nduja sausage is completely broken down and there are no discernible chunks - yet the taste permeates the entire dish. The sauce had a slight heat (spice) background, probably from the nduja. The sourdough breadcrumbs added that textural element that you usually don't get in a pasta dish.Dessert: Fresh farmers cheese flan with beet caramel and sorghum crispHad that soft, slight-crumbly texture of a super fresh farmers cheese but in that jiggly flan structure. Beet caramel - where have you been all of my life?? Adds an earthy element that steers the flan dish away from the usual sickeningly-sweetness. The sorghum crisp had the texture of a thinner fortune cookie (words of my bartender!) and adds a nice bitterness that, again, helps to ground the dessert.Side note: If you are a small party, it may be easier to get seats at the bar rather than wait for a table."], ["Pire T.", "I loved every aspect of my visit here. The food is phenomenal. There are so many unique options to choose from and it all tastes delicious. We had a couple of their pasta dishes: the squid ink and lemon pasta. Both were incredible. We also had dessert. A lovely date cake with an ball of whipped topping. Again, everything is unusual but in the best possible way. If you visit, be sure to grab a couple of their signature cocktails. They're expertly crafted and beautifully presented. Aside from the delicious food, the atmosphere of this place is rustic southern with delicate hanging lights, communal tables (but also private tables and bar seating), hanging plants, and trendy decor. The staff is also extremely friendly and attentive. This is certainly one of my absolute favorite places in Nashville. I'll come back here time and time again."], ["Thao n.", "A gem in Nashville, excellent food! Had the broccoli and it might be the best broccoli dish I've ever had. The heritage pork was magnificent! Tender, tasty, and served with fresh peaches. And of course the squid ink pasta was excellent. Ordered the chocolate panna cotta dessert- flavors were good but on the drier side and a bit too much chocolate cake and almost no panna cotta. Good wine list. Mainly communal tables. Beautiful place but a bit loud."], ["Erick N.", "Fantastic restaurant; so happy to have finished my Nashville road trip on such a high note before the long journey back to Chicago. Had multiple chefs recommend Rolf & Daughters as one of Nashville's best venues and in my experience chefs tend to proffer excellent recommendations; when they praise a restaurant it is best to listen. As our shuttle dropped us off outside we were immediately impressed by the charming exterior of Rolf & Daughters. Walking in the interior was equally beautiful. As we arrived well before our reservation we opted to sit at the bar for a pre dinner cocktail, but were happy the hostess offered to squeeze us in early if we wanted (they had just opened, but we noticed that they rather quickly had a full house; impressive for a Sunday evening). \u00a0We ended up finding the bar seating comfortable and the bartenders quite personable so moments later we informed the hostess we would like to eat up to the bar and were accommodated. Of note much of the dining room area has communal tables and seating was somewhat close together, so this also factored into our decision to sit at the bar. For some reason we enjoy the liveliness of bar seating, but when in a dining room have a preference for a more intimate ambiance. The menu at Rolf & Daughters is wonderful. Approximately sixteen savory items arranged from lighter dishes to heavier proteins and a separate section for pastas. Ingredients are fresh, high quality and most of what you are served is made from scratch in house. There is a nice balance of vegetable centric dishes, seafoods and meats. So much on the menu sounded tempting that it was tough to narrow our choices down. The bartender was very helpful answering our questions, making some recommendations and advising on what quantity of food to order (and was spot on with his assistance - as well as did a nice job coursing out what we ordered in a sensible manner). We ended up sharing five savories and of these four were fantastic and one (the octopus) still quite good but just not as stellar. The crostini with broccoli, pistachio and generous portion of shaved pecorino cheese sounds simple but wow, the freshness of the ingredients really shined and there was so much flavor. The sweet potato with nduja, green onion, yogurt and lime had such harmony among the various textures and flavors and also was a huge hit. The dry aged tartare was among the better tartare preparations I have enjoyed and the squid ink pasta with seafood and crunchy sour dough croutons was an instant favorite. The food was nicely presented but not at all fussy. One of those meals where you just really enjoy every single bite and the food leaves behind such a pleasant aftertaste. The only negative food wise was dessert; the individual ingredients sounded awesome - caramel, popcorn, lime curd and ginger (all flavors I love) but the curd was poorly executed (way too sweet and no tartness), the ginger was non-detectable and the caramel had an odd aftertaste that clashed with the lime; the popcorn provided a little much needed textural component but quickly became soggy. My wife made the smart decision of ordering a second crostini for dessert and I was envious but she made quick work of it, feverishly fending off my attempts to snatch a bite with her fork and a menacing stare down. Cocktails were on par quality wise with the savories. We really enjoyed the playful names (i.e. Here Today Saigon Amaro and Pearway to Heaven). For one round of drinks the bartender was adept at making us some nice off-menu cocktails based on a description of what we were seeking.Despite the poor dessert this was an otherwise outstanding meal. Loved the vibe (upscale yet casual), loved the decor, loved the staff (and Rolf & Daughters attracted friendly patrons as well), loved the drinks and loved the savories. We also were pleasantly surprised by the bill; for the high quality and rather generous portions this was quite a bargain! Definitely will be making a return visit next time we are in town and quite possibly will squeeze in two meals since there is just no way possible to consume all the highly appealing dishes on the menu in a single visit, though it might be fun to try!"], ["Sarah E.", "I would have loved to give this restaurant 5 stars, don't get me wrong. The service was great, the atmosphere was super cool, presentation of every dish was beautiful, and the cocktails, wine, small plates and entrees were on point and very very delicious. But... when we got to dessert, it was disappointing. I didn't think you could mess up dessert this much, but apparently you can.We ordered the lime curd dessert. Sounds bright and rich, right? It was a mess, literally. The photo explains it all. WTF? I order dessert every time I eat out, and this felt like we were getting punk'd. Ashton? Where are you?I'll go back here, but I probably won't order dessert."], ["Mirnova C.", "The food was delicious. The sweet potato was to die for. Definitely get the broccoli and the cauliflower dishes. All the pasta dishes were tasty. Definitely go if you're in Nashville. The only reason it us a 4 not a five is the service was okay not excellent."], ["Peter S.", "Great food. The choices were great and everything really sizzled on the palate. We had the romesco, which was really good. It really had a lot of flavored going on. We also had the squid ink pasta, which was the best dish of the night. You really have to try this. We had the rigatoni which could easily be skipped, it was just okay but this is high standards. Lastly we had the trout and it was fantastic. The only downer was that the server was not really on the same planet. Multiple times in had to remind her what we ordered. She delivered the dessert menu and asked what we would like and we were still waiting for the trout. Good thing the food is amazing."], ["Nandini M.", "Quite possibly the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life and I eat a lot of pasta. \u00a0You have to reserve at least a month and a half in advance but it is so worth it. \u00a0The space is small and industrial but very warm and bright. \u00a0We were seated in a corner and I loved that I could observe and people watch in the packed restaurant around me. \u00a0The restaurant was pointed out to us on a tour earlier in the day and by a cabbie the day before, so Nashvellites (?) are clearly very proud of this place and they have every reason to be. \u00a0We split a great bottle of ros\u00e9 and a bunch of apps but my pasta entree blew me away. \u00a0I seriously savored every bite. \u00a0Everyone at my table loved their food too and to our amazement the bill didn't make any of us cringe. \u00a0Affordable fine dining is the best! \u00a0Very friendly for different dietary restrictions and super pleasant staff."], ["Lydia B.", "RAD is a Top notch upscale casual whisky bar with great food. Every bite of food was delicious. We shared the sour dough bread with seaweed butter. Um, what is seaweed butter and how can I get more of it? It was airy and uniquely yummy. We also had the Swiss chard and ricotta cassoncini, lardo. They were bite size canap\u00e9s that were confusing looking but tasted good. I went over board on chicken and was pretty happy with myself. I adored the ample portion of creamy chicken liver with currant mustard, red cress and toast. My excellent server boasted about the pastured chicken \u00a0with preserved lemon and garlic confit. so I went for it! I will say it was in my top 5 best chicken dishes from a restaurant. I loved the super chicken flavor with fresh herbs of tarragon and flat parsley accents. Chicken was served with no sided and it was so good. Just all juicy flattened chicken. My dinner partner tried the heritage pork sauerkraut gala apple with spaetzle. Sadly he was pretty stingy with sharing. The plate offered a few cuts of pork and the sauerkraut spaetzle. I tried a few bites when he was not looking and enjoyed my bites. The others at the table had the Garganelli verde heritage pork ragout, and sarvecchio (their favorite) I tasted it and boy are they on to something... It boasts Gooey, yummy bites of comfort food with style. We also shared a bowl of the squid ink Campanella, fl squid,shrimp, nduja (what ever that is?), basil, breadcrumbs... It was dramatic and also comforting. It did not photograph well but it tasted great. We also shared all three of the deserts and ordered secret desert cocktails. The lime curd, Carmel corn and ginger was odd looking but omg was it a delicious blend of treats for the mouth. We liked the beet and farmer cheese flan but it was not a highlight. The last desert was also unique and yummy but again the lime curd with popcorn took the prize. I was \"forced\" to get a desert cocktail called \"Don't meletti me down\" which was a mixture of Graham's port, meletti, smith & cross rum, Saigon cinnamon and while egg... Talk about a rich glass of yummy booze. I enjoyed a great meal at Rolf And Daughters for sure. It was a warm casual jeans feel too. Obviously I look forward to going back."], ["Caroline K.", "Fresh off the airplane and in need of a drink, my friend and I headed straight to Rolf and Daughters. We arrived around 7pm and the place was packed. Our other friend still hadn't arrived, which turned out to be a good thing since the quoted time for a table was close to 2 hours. Silly me for going to one of the hottest restaurants in Nashville on a Friday night without a reservation. We headed over to the bar to imbibe while we waited, and luckily 2 seats opened up at the end of the bar. The bar itself it quite big, but was very crowded, especially since most people ended up eating there rather than just drinking. My friend got (multiple) Silence of the Lambruscos, while I started with the vey delicious Cynarnold Schwarzenegger and worked my way up to a few R.A.D. Old Fashioneds. The cocktails were great and very strong. They caught up with me later in the night. We were starving so we ordered the sourdough bread with seaweed butter and the chicken liver pate. Chicken liver is one of the few things I still have trouble enjoying, despite how much I try to like it. My friend was more than happy to devour it on her own, while I happily ate what seemed like a half-loaf of sourdough. The seaweed butter and chunks of sea salt to sprinkle on top were amazing. Who doesn't like a good piece of bread?Finally our friend arrived, and our table awaited! A lot of the tables are long, wooden communal benches, and we were seated comfortably at the end of one. All of the food sounded amazing, but our friend had eaten not that long ago and after my practical meal of bread, we didn't need that much food. We shared the Garganelli verde, Rigatoni with lamb sausage, and something else that I am ashamed to admit I forget. Too many cocktails! The food was impressive and we definitely were fighting over the last bite of that rigatoni. Overall, Rolf and Daughters lived up to the hype. It is the kind of restaurant you wish was in your neighborhood, but at the same time don't actually want near you because you will spend all your time and money there. I hope to be back!"], ["Deralyn G.", "This place has incredible food and drinks. My sister and I ate at the bar. Ruben looked after us and made some recommendations, so glad he did! \u00a0We probably wouldn't have ordered the squid ink bucatini (pasta) on our own, and it was delectable. \u00a0We had the broccoli appetizer, which was anything but boring.

Mediterranean Cuisine sits in a small strip mall in northwest Brentwood. It has counter service and the atmosphere is pretty quiet, clean and ordered. The menu is more on the Greek end of the Mediterranean-Middle East spectrum. Service was fast and here is the bottom line.Gyro: Reasonable pita bread, meat with some fresh vegetables. They include some grilled peppers and onions along with olives. Nothing special.Hummus: Good consistency but not very flavorful. Very heavily salted and lemoned.Felafel: Main disappointment.

Recognized by dieticians and nutrition experts as the most healthy and balanced diet, it is nice to have a place offering a variety of wonderful, healthy options in Maryland Farms. I love their platters that come with lamb (or your choice of meat), the BEST rice and fresh Greek salad. On this particular visit, I had the Greek entree-sized salad along with baba ganough and pita. The Greek salad consists of lettuce, diced cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, olives and sliced banana peppers with a Greek vinaigrette dressing. While I liked the baba ganough (first time trying it here), I will likely stick to their hummus in the future. Mediterranean Cuisine is wonderful for catering business lunches in the Brentwood area. Last fall, I had a team meeting and used them. I have a couple people on my team from the Mediterranean region, and they thought the food was authentic and delicious. They are also very reasonably priced, with lunches ranging from $5-$9 a person and offer plenty of vegetarian options. So forget that bland, boxed sandwich lunch for your meeting and go for variety! They are typically very busy during lunch, but don't leave if you see a long line waiting to order. The line moves very quickly, and there is usually plenty of seating inside and outside with tables turning over frequently.Also, for my order this week, I used the Eat24 Yelp app for the first time. I dug it! Very easy to place my order and pay for it, knowing I had a tight timeline between meetings and needed to be able to just run over and pick up my order without spending time in line.

I ordered the Gyro platter, it came out promptly, including Lamb, rice, Tabbouleh, Hummus and pita bread. The Tabbouleh was very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. The hummus was pretty good as well, I've definitely had better but as a compliment to a meal I can't complain. The gyro meat itself was pretty uninspiring, it was good, but it kind of had the feel that it had been sitting in a warmer for a little while. The rice was your typical Gyro restaurant rice, nothing more nothing less. The Tzatziki was good, they kind of spice it up a little here, and I always like my gyro's drowning in it.Overall, I was pleased with the meal, the service was great, the employees were smiling, and the restaurant was clean. The food wasn't anything mind blowing, but definitely good enough for a return trip next time I'm in the mood for some Mediterranean fare.

They aren't playing around, the chef knows his stuff, and that puts them head and shoulders above the goofy gyro/kebab joints that infest this town. \u00a0How all the burgers and fries and shit snuck their way onto the menu is beyond me, I'd love to see a full board of Greek-only dishes if they're all the same quality of the souvlaki.The restaurant itself could really use some updating, but it's on par with the other businesses on that street so they don't stand out as unkempt, the interior just doesn't quite match the quality of the food itself.Don't let the three stars fool you, it was A-OK and I will be coming back to try the other Greek dishes for sure."], ["Billy F.", "Stopped in without realizing this place was \"famous\" (d, d, and d).

I even saw local Greek personality Demetria Kalodimos eating there; I recognized her and she recognized me. Her presence gives the restaurant a little extra clout in my book.I love the big city hours, staying open into the AM hours and round the clock on Saturdays.I will continue to come back to Athens and hope I don't have one of the negative experiences a few others have had."], ["Allie W.", "They serve breakfast all day and are open 24 hours Saturday nights!

I saw the sign in Athen's window, and was intrigued that they had been on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. I was warmly greeted upon my entrance, and quickly seated. The atmosphere is very plain and simple, and I was happy to see that the prices reflected that it is not fine dining. The menu looks pretty good and straightforward. I was starving, so I ordered a meat-stuffed grapeleaf as an appetizer, and Moussaka with Greek salad.I wolfed down the grapeleaf, and greatly enjoyed it. Tender leaves wrapped around a nice ground meat and rice stuffing; I wish the lemon sauce had been a little bit more tangy but still, it was a very satisfying appetizer. Unfortunately, I thought the salad was just awful. It was just plain chopped lettuce, some cucumber and feta cheese crumbles. Very devoid of any flavor or interesting texture. It definitely could have \u00a0used a nice, garlicky or acidic bite, maybe some raw onion and more tomato, some saltiness from black olives... just some extra oomph. I did not like the mayonnaise-like Greek dressing that came with it. Instead, I had to liberally use the vinegar and salt and pepper. The moussaka was okay as well, I liked the ground beef filling, however I wish there would have been more of it - my portion was mostly the Bechamel layer, and tomato sauce (both sauces, especially the tomato, could have used more salt and overall flavor).Overall, not a bad experience, and the prices are very reasonable, especially with the generous portions."], ["Ann N.", "Love this place! We go to eat there once a week. Love their weekend hours. My favorite dish is the Special Lamb Chop that served until 10pm.

Didn't taste like corned beef AT ALL. \u00a0Excited they served it on rye but you'd never know it because they butter and cheese fry the bread a'la Texas toast. Yuck! I'm pretty sure they used pump cheese as there was all sorts of drippy sauce that was yellowish. I did notice some spicy mustard, though the menu said thousand island. Over all- I didn't even eat half. Hubby took one bite and was like.....no.He ordered a gyro. It's a Greek place right? We will stick with the local gyro place. One thick slice of meat...clearly not freshly cut off the rotisserie. It was easy to tell it was frozen and thrown on the grill. Which brings me to my biggest complaint....both sandwiches tasted the way an electrical fire smells. \u00a0 I don't know if they feel compelled to add liquid smoke because it's the south, or if their grill is just dirty....but it wasn't good.Thank goodness we liked the fries. They are over cooked so they are super crispy. Hubs would have been happier had they not sprinkled them with Feta cheese, but that is easily remedied.

He said yes of course and then brought me back a gyro with quite a bit of tough chicken yet hardly any lettuce, tomato and yogurt sauce. So again I had tough meat and, this time, a very dry gyro. And the side that was still available was green beans which were not cooked very well, so they were tough to eat.

She described it as excellent. She let me taste it and I agreed. I'm a big guy, and I usually take up her slack (uneaten portion). She gave me no slack today.I ordered the gyros platter. The gyros was like a lunch meat which was sliced and cooked. Tasted good, but after living in Chicago I'm used to gyros being cut from a large hunk of meat on a rotating spit by a big hairy guy with a BIG knife which made you not want to argue with him. Not to my taste as it wasn't crunchy enough. My meal was well prepared, just not to my taste. I ate all of it nonetheless. The tzatziki sauce was good. The rice dish which came with it was excellent. It was spinach with tomatoes and the fat rice the Greeks are known for. I could have eaten 2 bowls of it.Final verdict, a well run restaurant with excellent food and polite, efficient staff.

I ordered the Pomegranate Chicken Plate, which came with a generous serving of chicken, rice, pita, and salad for about $6.50. The chicken was SO flavorful, but it was a little gristly.

I think the best bet would be the gyro sandwich for $2.99, WHICH IS AN INSANE DEAL. We also tried the stuffed grape leaves (good but not the best I have ever had) and the spicy fries (surprisingly tasty and I'm not a fry fan!). It did take a little while to get our food.

The staff was friendly.Cons- I got my order to go, and didn't check the container before I left. The platter was supposed to come with pita bread to eat the hummus with, I didn't get any. And instead of kalamata olives, I was given black olives. Also, the music was a little too loud. Made it hard to hear the staff as he was making recommendations, and so probably not a place I would sit down to eat with someone and hang out.I still think this place has potential.

We got guava mixed with mint in a pineapple bowl with an ice chamber hose. The blend was great, and the coals were replaced by a pro, so it never got harsh or ashy.

For $5.99, I bought the combination platter that came with both gyro meat and chicken on a bed of yellow right with a tasty little salad mixed in. I chose the cucumber sauce, which they poured over the top of the meat in the perfect portion size. I even felt like what I ate was reasonably healthy as well, for fast food at least.I ate lunch at noon. It's not almost 6pm, and I am still full. Value, people.Normally when I buy this type of lunch, the lettuce is the stale out-of -a-bag variety, the meat is a little dry, and I feel like I have to douse everything in the tzaziki sauce to make it palatable. I was pleasantly surprised to find the meat fresh (and very tasty), while the salad was actual romaine lettuce glazed with a good vinaigrette-type dressing and fresh chopped parsley. There were slices of fresh onion, black olives and banana peppers thrown in as well. If they had only thrown in some feta, it would have been perfection.Don't be tempted to feel dubious about the neighborhood or the exterior of the building.

The tabbouleh is clearly home-made and it is absolutely delicious, with a nice dominance of parsley and mint as opposed to bulgur. \u00a0The hummus is quite peanut-buttery and seems homemade, but lacks some of the lightness that I associate with the dip, while the felafels are at times quite hard to bite down on. As I am disinclined to eat beef, it also bothers me when the water comes with pieces of beef strips stuck on like remoras. Still its cheap, and for the people in Bellevue it gives me a bit more choice than the usual line of fast foods. \u00a0For some reason every time I visited the television was on with some CNN broadcast involving some issue in the Middle East: first the start of the Arab Spring, then the Libyan War, then bin Laden's death, then fighting in Yemen. \u00a0Very strange."], ["Corey F.", "I've yet to have a bad experience here.

The owner is almost always working. He is such a warm and friendly person. We enjoy seeing him when we dine. He delivers personal service, every time. Did I mention the chicken?

The plate came with good taboulli salad, hummus, rice and tzitziki sauce. I'm not sure how many grape leaves came with the order (maybe 5 or 6) because they disappeared very quickly.

Atmosphere was lacking; it's a little dive-y if you ask me. Parking lot was TINY--only a few spots. Not sure if they have parking in back or not.The only complaint I have is that we ordered 2 Turkish coffees along with the rest of our order, and they weren't ready until after we were already finished our whole meal.

Hummus was average at best, we can easily make better at home. Baba ganoush was inedible, a strange smooth consistency and odd color. After first taste we left it untouched, and didn't finish the hummus. Falafel was average and not particularly flavorful. The main courses were dried out, not fresh at all, and as we were hungry we forced ourselves to eat through it with a hefty covering of hot sauce (which was tasty). Tabouleh was a let down, and cucumber salad made for the tastiest bites of the meal (it was cut fresh!)I've had Turkish food in Turkey, and London, and elsewhere, and getting it right just isn't that difficult.

Besides me and a couple coworkers who came to lunch with me, there were maybe 3 other occupied tables in the middle of what should have been the lunch rush. Don't let this fool you into thinking this place isn't great though.I ordered the greek salad with doner meat on it, and it was fantastic. The salad itself was picture perfect; everything was arranged so nicely I almost hated to disturb it. Piles of veggies, piles of feta cheese, and a pile of freshly grilled doner meat in the center. The greens were fresh and crisp, the meat was tender and delicious, and the olives & feta were quite olivey and fetaey, respectively. At first I thought it was a tad pricey for a salad, but it was well worth it. They absolutely did not skimp on the ingredients, and the portion is as large as it is delicious. Unless you're practically starving, you can plan on bringing some home with you.I also had their white bean soup, served with some sliced pita bread. The soup was absolutely fantastic with the perfect level of spicyness. I definitely intend on visiting this place regularly.Oh, be sure to park around the back; the few spaces in front are a pain to pull out of, and the funeral home next to the restaurant has quite a few \"We'll tow you if you park here\" signs."], ["Thomas Z.", "This place is great ! \u00a0Delicious, freshly prepared food with with friendly service. \u00a0I've been to this place four times in the past six months, and have always thoroughly enjoyed my meals. \u00a0They usually have a freshly made juice from several green vegetables.

We started with some hummus and baba ganoush which were both tasty (and we got refills of pita!) Then a round of soup for everyone. I got to try all 3 soups. The white bean was tomato based and tasty, but the least popular at our table (Mildly spicy). The lentil wasn't spicy at all and creamy and delicious. The yogurt soup was super spicy in a totally delicious way and was a hit at our table. Next, most of us ordered a combo platter of some sort (some with shish, some with gyro, some falafel, etc). Everything on my plate was awesome. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have doner available (wanted to try it due to the super reviews on here!) but it was still marinating. Bummer!

Then she brought us some baklava with candles and started up the birthday song! It was really fun and we all felt really well cared for. I'm not sure if she hooked us up with a deal or what, but I paid for myself and the birthday boy and with tax and tip it came out to around 35 bucks (for 4 courses!) AWESOME.

And the other, mine, had the standard, minus tomatoes, plus feta, parsley, and a few other things. And sauce on the side for both.I had no problems at all, it was done quickly, and each gyro is only 5 bucks, normal price. It's also kind of huge for a gyro sandwich - it was very filling and if I'd gotten a side it would have been far too much food.

Don't be scu-red of the slightly run down interior, I prefer to think of it as 'homey' seeing as how they also let you bring in your own beer and wine, like an old friend just stopping in for some lovingly prepared meat on a rotating spit.

I've been going here for 6 years. Lunch, dinner, takeout & even catering. If you want great Turkish( Mediterranean) food and lots of it for a good price then this is your place. Istanbul Cafe is a true family ran business. There is only 2 people you will see that cook here, Memet or his son Yusif. While the wait staff may vary from time to time, you'll be treated like family. Parking is tricky. There is 5-6 tight spots out front, or you can park around back. If you're not sure if you like Turkish food and want to play it safe, then get the 1 pound cheeseburger. Its seasoned and cooked perfectly with very lean beef. I think its priced around $7.00 w/ fries. A coworker killed off 2 of these in 8 minutes 25 seconds on a dare. No small feat. Let me know if you can beat that and wanna throw the gauntlet down. The grilled chicken tenders platter, approx $7.35 w/ (basmatti rice, tabouli & cucumber salad) is my \"go to meal\". The 4 big chicken tenders are marinated for no less than 24 hrs in a variety of seasonings and then cooked on the flat top to the point that they just cut easily with a fork. Their gyro is really the best I've ever had. You gotta try the Tarhana soup. Its a yogurt based soup, but not the kind of yogurt you're thinking of. It has a \"Hot & Sour\" type of taste that's more addictive than most forms of opiates. \u00a0Get the \"donner\" plate or sandwich. Specially seasoned strips of beef that is considered a predecessor to gyro. Make sure you get it with the cucumber sauce, it just goes better with it. Speaking of sauce... what Memet calls \"ranch\" is more like Tzatziki & Ranch combined with a more yogurty base and sour taste. Its always homemade and you will wanna drink it as a beverage. The Mediterranean Salad (romaine, onion, feta, tomatoes,kalamatta olives, tabouli & cucumber) with chicken or gyro for $8.25 is gynourmous. The lamb shank falls right off the bone and fills the plate full of \u00a0\"the best rice ever\" with its juices. Most regular plates can be shared by 2, but you really wont want to. \u00a0Split one of the big \"specials/ combos\" with a friend and have a variety of all the meats they offer and then some left over.Consistency is always there.

The decor is not very interesting, but the people were quiet but friendly. The servers visited our table many times and never let our drink run out. Overall I had a great experience for eating lunch. I can tell they care about the food and is different from our usual diet. The bathroom was run down but clean and I think a clean bathroom tells a lot about what you can expect with other things.

So basically, I knew this was going to be awesome. It's the \"Nolensville Road Effect\". When the place is as ugly as the food smells incredible, my mouth starts to water.Ordered the Shish Kifta. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and did not have the gamey \"Overcooked Burger\" texture and taste that so many other Nashville Mediterranean places have. It was delicious, and complimented my rice and salad well.Be very careful with the Hummus because it is very addictive. The hummus is so delicious you have to take care to not stuff yourself with pita bread before your meal. It's fantastic. Also take care to not load up on the falafel which is superb. Heck, the appetizers are as good as the meal, and you need to save room, because the portion sizes are big enough to feed Zangief from Street Fighter II. Oh yeah, the Yogurt Soup. My lord the Yogurt Soup. I would walk 4 miles through broken glass barefoot up a gigantic mountain while it rains freezing lemon juice just to have another bowl. \u00a0Okay, I'm overexaggerating. But not by much, bro. Not by much.Finally, I wish I could magically teleport this restaurant back home with me to Austin.

I understand that they do things a certain way, but his haughty dismissal was beyond rude. Our server was fine, but definitely had an attitude as well, and kept standing over our table, silently, until we stopped eating and asked what she needed.

We strolled in around 8:30 without reservations and it was quite busy. The host (owner?) went off to see if he could find a table for two as I made a snarky comment to my date who notoriously avoids planning like the plague. Before I could finish my reprimand, we were seated and he was vindicated. Oh, well. He'll learn someday. The ambiance was lively and cozy, with understated decor. There's no art on the walls, but cool architectural details in the wall textures, sculptural ceiling, and wood window lattice provide a cohesive feel. It totally works.The service wasn't memorable, but in a good way. I don't recall wanting for water refills or plate clearing at any point. I appreciated the little cracker snack with herbed oil for dipping when we sat down. The food had great flavor and servings were substantial. We started with Adas Be-silik (lentil and kale soup, with an unexpected lemony flavor) and Labneh (fresh and light, herbed cheese dip). Small peasant chopped salads came next, light and lovely without any sweet or creamy annoyances. I had the Hummos Beyrouti, which was really delicious, but just not what I wanted once I saw it. It was basically hummus with ground beef and pine nuts and I suddenly remembered I'd had hummus at lunch. Oops! This hummus was way better than store bought, though! My guy had Kafta and LOVED it. He had ordered it before, but now declared it his favorite dish in Nashville at the moment. It came with roasted potaoes and veggies, all with lovely spices. For dessert we shared the lemony cheese tart. I can't remember the name of because our server only spoke it to me, but a quick google search makes with think it was Halawet al Jibn and it was really great. Tangy and not too sweet, perfect with a cup of strong coffee.

I'm pretty confident in stating that this is pretty darn authentic. I'm not some kind of middle eastern food expert but I do have several family friends from Israel and Lebanon and this is the food I pretty much grew up on in Los Angeles when I was over at their houses. I like to hop in Epice for a to-go lunch ordered from the bar. I've also had several of their appetizers and samplings from friends plates, when I've actually dined in. I've only been in for lunch and I can't wait to get in for dinner! I loved the atmosphere and they have done a spectacular job with the minimalistic sheik interior. I would recommend calling ahead about reservations and I think this place might be better suited for parties of 2-6. If you're there on a day when the owner is in, you're sure to get a fabulous story about Lebanon and some good recommendations. The warm potato side, which comes with many dishes, is pretty freakin spectacular, especially when you've grown tired of soggy old french fries at every other restaurant in Nashville. I think we, as a city, are incredibly lucky to have such an establishment open up. I hope it paves the road for other similar places. Between you and me, the whole \"new southern\", \"refined southern\", \"reinvented southern\" has become tedious and boring. I'm not saying we shouldn't celebrate those things, or stop sourcing locally, but sheesh do something different! And Epice is definitely different. I think Nashville is ready for these different places, our minds are open and you should come on down and experience something new at Epice!"], ["Anna Y.", "This is an outstanding place. I don't even know where to begin! - Food (they follow the authentic recipes to the letter, won't swap for cheaper ingredients (like pine nuts) and actually a Lebanese friend recommended this place, she is saying she hasn't eaten anything that authentic since she left home. Decent amount of food (not fashionably tiny servings where you feel like you need to order 2-3 courses to make yourself full, and I don't eat a lot). - Prices are really, really reasonable for this type of place and for what you get (and for 12 South, okay).

I could not be more pleased with my experience at Epice. I made a reservation for 2 at 7 PM, and when I arrived at 6:50, I was taken directly to my seat. The decor was minimal, but perfect for the concept. Since I had to drive home, I didn't have any wine, but the selection was decent. We started with hummus. It was the best hummus I've ever eaten, and considering that hummus is practically a food group for me, that's high praise. My friend ordered the special, Chilean sea bass en papillote, and was VERY pleased. I've never seen her eat more than half her food, and she cleaned her plate. I ordered the kafta (some spell it \"kofta\" or \"kofte\"), seasoned ground beef patties with a stack of perfectly seasoned and cooked potatoes and grilled slices of carrot, squash, and zucchini. It was all perfectly cooked with just enough spice to be interesting, but little enough that you could taste the flavors of the meat and vegetables. I couldn't finish my giant portion, and look forward to having it for lunch tomorrow!We shared dessert, katayef, which was DELICIOUS. There was a crepe-like fried pocket filled with a soft, mild cheese and topped with a strawberry and fig sauce, and a spicy/sweet crushed walnut (think baklava) -filled pocket with a FANTASTIC kiwi sauce. There was also a dollop of the most perfect homemade lemon curd. It was a truly excellent ending to a great meal. Last note---the service was OUTSTANDING. Our waitress was very knowledgable, took the time to list ingredients and describe dishes, and had the most impeccable sense of timing. She might be a mind-reader. Overall, EXCELLENT experience.

Over a week ago, I dined there for lunch with 6 colleagues. It was a special celebratory meal and as the guest of honor, I had selected Epice. Shortly after being seated, I uncrossed my legs and experienced a sharp pain by my right knee. I looked and saw a deep cut (gash really) to my leg over 1/2 an inch long and about 2 mm deep. I looked under the table and found a bolt attaching the table top that had a very sharp burr sticking out. This was extremely sharp and was not something tiny; it was easy to see and to feel. We flagged down our waitress and asked for a first aid kit while I held my flesh together so it would not bleed all over. She was apologetic when I showed her the cut. She did not take me up on my offer to show her/have her feel the burr upon which I was injured. She got the kit and appeared to tell other restaurant personnel about the incident. About 5 minutes later she came back with supplies. She waited while I clumsily administered first aid to my bleeding leg. Eventually, a person who appeared to be the manager (he never identified himself) came over. He was completely blas\u00e9 and disinterested in the whole thing; he also declined to feel or view the burr. He stated that a number of their tables had had such issues and they had them filed down but must have missed this one. He then said he had sent someone to get a box of Band-Aids. Apparently that was sufficient in his mind, because he drifted off - only to be seen 5-10 minutes later when he presented me with the box of Band-Aids. For him, the incident was resolved. For me, not so much. I had the pleasure of continuing to dine AT THE SAME TABLE for the rest of the meal!!! I did so sitting diagonally so I would not slice open my other leg. No one seemed to notice/care that they left us sitting at a table with a very sharp piece of metal sticking out. I am not the type of person to cause a scene or be rude, so I was overly nice about the whole thing and I suspect that led them to believe they could be so lackadaisical about the incident.The food was delivered and looked amazing. Well, for everyone except one of my colleagues, who had a hair in her plate. As her hair has a very stark ombre dye to it, it was quite obvious it was not her hair. She said nothing about it initially, but we noticed her face and asked what was wrong. We called the waitress over and she immediately apologized and said they would get her another meal. She also said they would comp this person's meal. My colleague then sat for almost 10 minutes with no food, watching us eat, while she waited for her fresh, hairless, meal. Once that was delivered, we were all happy and very much enjoyed the meal. Only two of the other women in my group had ever eaten at Epice before and the rest were all totally blown away by the food. \u00a0We then ordered four desserts to split between us. Again, the food was great. It was the management's handling of the running of the restaurant that was appalling. We requested the bill and when it arrived, we discovered that they had not comped the dish with the hair, nor my meal (although they never said they would comp my meal, just the one with the hair). Our entire party of seven women was stunned. I certainly was not looking for any grand gesture on their part, but this was not a minor scratch. This was a slice deep enough that it wouldn't stay closed without multiple steri strips. Because we were there for a celebration, we did not make a scene and continued to be wholly gracious. After returning to work, we realized my injury should be looked at by a doctor in case I needed stitches or a tetanus shot. It was properly irrigated, cleaned and glued shut by a doctor. Meanwhile, my boss (who paid for the meal) called Epice to speak to the owner. Immediately apologetic, he indicated he wanted to contact me. When she emailed my contact information to Epice's email, it bounced back. Three nights ago she hand delivered my contact information to him. She explained who she was and gave him the envelope. He simply took it, set it down and returned to a group of his staff. He did not apologize to her in person, act as if he cared about what had happened, or assure her that he had done anything in response to the incident. As of this moment, almost 3 days later and over a week since I was injured, I have not heard from him. I am truly appalled by this new low in customer service. Due to how this was (not) handled, Epice has lost my business and that of the other women with whom I dined. Had I been a squeaky wheel or raised a big stink, I am sure they would have bent over backwards to appease me. That is not how customer service should work.There are too many delicious restaurants in Nashville to waste your time and money going to one where a gracious customer is considered insignificant at best, and a nuisance at worst!"], ["Zoey N.", "Awesome food and atmosphere! Will definitely come back! Their vegetarian Bustan is so good! I heard the mango tea is good too, will def try next time."], ["Diana S.", "Epice is aptly named, for the food at this Lebanese bistro is simple fare elevated by the seasonings of the marinades, rubs and sauces.When a friend and I went for lunch, we started with the Al-Raheb, an eggplant spread which was bright, lemony and light, and served with pita triangles and long, thin, crisps laden with herbs and spices. We were told that the soups are vegetarian (no meat or poultry broths used) and often are or can be made vegan. An example of the \"can be made\" was the delicious roasted red pepper soup, which is a thick puree of red peppers cooked with garlic and potatoes (I think). Veggie has a dollop of yogurt on top; vegan does not. I had a grilled fish sandwich (cobia) that was absolutely spectacular! It had a heavy spice rub on it that was simply killer and kept the fish moist during the cooking. It was drizzled with tarator, or a cucumber yogurt sauce that played perfectly against the sharp spices. it was served with cilantro roasted shoestring potatoes. My friend ordered the Epice salad, greens with goat cheese, toasted almonds and fig vinaigrette. It was delicious. The dessert we order was also delicious, in spite of - or more likely because of - its simplicity. Katayef is two thick buttery crepes, one filled with sweet cheese and the other with walnuts, with berries and a fig along side. As my friend said, \"these are so stinkin' good!\"Dinner on another night began with Labneh. or mountain cheese served with mint and garlic and pickled stuffed peppers. The first was a bit of a disappointment, as the soft cheese didn't have much flavor, even with the mint and garlic. The pickled peppers were fantastic, but the portion (2 small peppers) was a bit on the stingy side. Entrees were Tawook, or a marinated chicken skewer served with the cilantro roasted potatoes, and Batinjan, a sort of casserole of roasted eggplant served with a large square of vermicelli rice. The chicken was tender and flavorful from the marinade. I wasn't a huge fan of the eggplant dish and I love eggplant - I just felt that the flavors were kind of muddled in it.The design of the exterior and interior are very attractive, and almost post-modern. The inside is all either smooth concrete or painted to look like it, with a curved stone wall housing the grill. The only wall decor is a series of flat dishes with a pile of spice on each one high behind the bar. They are subtly lit to highlight them even more.The wine selection is small but each one we tried was very good and complimented what we were eating.The only two downsides to Epice that I see are parking and reservations. There are 3, parking spaces in the Green Pea Salon lot next door (until 6pm when the entire lot is available) and there are some spaces in White's Mercantile lot on the other side.Reservations: make 'em, especially for the weekend. We went once on a Friday afternoon at 4pm for a late lunch and early wine. There was one other table there, and they still asked if we had reservations and told us it would be best if we sat at the bar. ?? \u00a0A few weeks prior, we went on a Saturday night around 8:40, and half the tables were open, but we were still asked if we had a reservation and when we said no, they said \"let me see what I can do\" and walked back onto the floor. FYI the tables never filled the rest of that night, and by the time we finished our 3 course lunch there were two or three tables max seated.For everyone who has mentioned signage, they do have it now."], ["Leah N.", "I recently moved to Nashville from Austin, Texas and my time in ATX made me a bit of a spoiled foodie.

YUM. \u00a0One of the newest additions to the 12 South neighborhood is also one of my new favorite restaurants in Nashville. \u00a0Epice was the perfect place to go for dinner with my friend and her parents tonight - the food was fresh, interesting, different (in a really great way) and absolutely delicious.We began our meal with two appetizers suggested to us by our waitress: Fatayer, a trio of stuffed pies, and another pickled egglant dish I can't remember the name of. \u00a0They were both very good, though the pies were all delicious and the most memorable of the two. \u00a0For dinner, I chose the Batinjan, an incredible roasted eggplant dish stuffed with ground beef, vegetables and pine nuts and served with rice and grilled vegetables. \u00a0The eggplant was melt-in-your-mouth tender and bursting with flavor and juicy ground beef. \u00a0The rice was perfectly seasoned with cumin and butter and served as a wonderful compliment to the eggplant. \u00a0My friend's mom ordered the Sayadeya, a spicy fish dish, which was also tender and delicious. \u00a0Our server was adorable, the prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of food served, and the atmosphere was elegant yet casual. \u00a0I'll be back whenever the craving for Lebanese food strikes!"], ["Lauren W.", "The decor of Epice is very clean and open. There's lots of off-white marble and honey colored wood. It's very chic without trying too hard. I love the open bar and prep area as well as the rock wall in the kitchen pass-through. The building is located across the street from Burger Up, but because it lacks a sign it can be easily missed. As soon as we were seated our waiter brought us some pita bread and oil for dipping. You can tell that the pita was freshly fried and spiced. The herb oil was very nice but I had a hard time putting it on my pita. I think I needed a small spoon or something, but since I didn't have one it lead to aggressive dipping.I have to say that our server was one of the funniest I've ever had. He was knowledgeable about the menu, polite, and at the same time had a wicked sense of humor that kept me giggling. Before we even got our appetizer Epice gave us another free snack. It was a very light salad that was tossed with the perfect amount of dressing. The lettuce was fresh and I especially enjoyed the cabbage and radish that were mixed in. For our appetizer we ordered the kibbeh which is ground beef in a wheat crust. They were charming little balls of meat with a very interesting texture- kind of chewy on first bite, but much like seasoned ground meat in the center. I absolutely loved the sauce that was served with it, which I believe was seasoned yogurt and cucumber. For my main dish I ordered the Batinjan which contained roasted eggplant and ground beef. I wasn't the biggest fan of this dish, mostly because I found the eggplant and meat combination just a tad too mushy for my liking. The stewed eggplant had the strangest consistency to me, but I know that this is a personal thing. I can say that it was seasoned perfectly and had very good overall flavor. My favorite part of the dish was the big slice of fried eggplant. It was like the best potato chip I ever had and I wanted many more of them! Also, the rice was fabulous and the yogurt sauce that I loved made another appearance in this dish. When I mixed the sauce with the eggplant and meat I liked it much better.Since it was girls night out we had to order to desserts. Fist up was the Roz be-haleeb which is rice pudding with orange blossom infusion served with cinnamon-sugar pita. This might be my favorite dish of the night, mostly because rice pudding is a nostalgic favorite of mine. It had a light floral flavor and the pudding was thick and rich. I would highly recommend ending your meal with this.Our second and final dessert was Katayef, or crepes. One was filled with a sweet mild cheese and the other was filled with sweetened walnuts. I loved the walnut crepe because of its crunchy nutty texture inside a soft pillow of pancake. An added bonus for me was the fig served with the crepes. Figs are my favorite!We really enjoyed our dinner at Epice. Although the prices are higher than any other middle eastern restaurant I've seen, I would say that the quality of the food and decor make the prices seem reasonable. We enjoyed our food and the service we received. Epice is another reason to brave the parking nightmare that is 12 South!"], ["Katie I.", "Epice is definitely an elevated Kalamata's- exactly what Nashville needs more of. The build out is gorgeous- modern and clean. Looks like a place that would be in LA or Tel Aviv.Showed up at 12:30 on a Tuesday and most all tables were full, but wasn't that busy. Our server was nice, but already in the weeds. Took awhile to get drinks and then they bring a glass of water for my 4 year old. Note: did not get the kid friendly vibe- so leave the rugrats at home.My friend and I shared the hummus and the fatayer- an assortment of \"pies\" each filled with cheese, spinach and a meat one. The meat one was the best. The cucumber sauce it came with was delicious!The hummus had a smokey taste and was delicious. Better than Kalamata's- more like a doctored up version. It only came with two pieces of soft pita and a crunchier flatbread- definitely not enough bread to mop up the chickpea goodness. We both had the shwarma. The meat was tender and juicy and thinly sliced. It had a pickle relish of onions inside, as well, really kicking the dish up a notch. Super tasty! The potatoes on the side were seriously off the chain. I don't even like or ever eat potatoes. They were amazing! The low point was the peasant salad that also came with the shawarma. I was very shocked and surprised on how awful it was. The dressing was super tangy, and not in a good way. The lettuce was a field mix that was not very fresh tasting. Now their sister restaurant Kalamata's has the best salad dressing. How in the world do they not duplicate that here, or elevate that even. Salad was an abomination and hopefully they will tweek it as they work out the growing pains. While service was slow, everyone was friendly. Parking is sparse. You can park next door at white mercantile (the old gas station) or the 3 spots they have to the left. I was told you can park at green pea salon at night. Like any 12 south establishment, parking is a sport. All in all, this is a great new addition to the neighborhood and a cuisine that Nashville is lacking in. Will return- without kids!*second pic is of fatayer- not hummus. I don't see an edit button :)"], ["Karli W.", "The service was fantastic. The food was incredible. And the ambience is so cool! The owner came to our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal and offered some wine pairings. After a brief description of what kind of wine I drink, he brought me a glass that was just to my liking. We ordered the Al Raheb to start which was sooo yummy and a perfect size to start off our meal. My boyfriend got the lamb shank which was delicious. Their hummus is authentic and fresh. Perfect for a date night or a night out without friends. Overall, LOVED IT."], ["Stephanie S.", "Simply delicious! I had the pistachio crusted lamb and red Lebanese wine! Yummy! Excellent service AND we met the owner Maher who was the coolest! If I lived in Nashville, this would be my favorite restaurant!"], ["Claudia A.", "Yummy! Thanks to yelp \"nearby\" option we found this quaint restaurant. It's tiny and hard to find if you are driving at 15 mile per hour speed (it's really tiny) but omg it's delicious. The hummus is great, the lentil soup is MAGNIficent and the chicken kabobs are good too (according to my fianc\u00e9e). So if you want some good Mediterranean food, this is the place to go!"], ["Rose L.", "All I can say Maher Fawaz is \"Well done sir, well done!\" The girls and I (7 of us) had such an amazing dinner tonight at the new Lebanese Bistro on 12 South appropriately named Epice (French for \"Spice\"). Maher (the owner) stopped at our table a couple times to see how everything was. I am a serious and sometimes picky foodie. I can honestly say in my 20 years in Nashville and out of the 1000's of restaurants I have tried here and around the world - this is my favorite, by far. We tried several apps and three of the desserts - all perfect. I don't know why, but I got really excited when I discovered the pomegranate seeds on top of my Al-Raheb (roasted eggplant pur\u00e9e) appetizer. My entree Sayadeya (spiced barramundi with caramelized onions) - this was absolutely AMAZING. My first experience with barramundi was lack-luster and I was hesitant. I am now a huge fan.At most upscale restaurants, I usually leave disappointed because I almost never feel like I get what I paid for - most don't live up to my expectations. But Epice is worth every penny I spent and then some. Not one single regret - except I wish I could have eaten/tried more. I can't wait for my return trip... We were blown away by the food and the service was phenomenal. Katie was our main server, but others stopped by to fill drinks, clear plates - team work at its best."], ["Rhonda M.", "Beautiful and relaxing location with super fresh food. \u00a0I had the epice salad with salmon which was amazing. \u00a0Get a spot on the open air patio!"], ["Chris C.", "Not bad. A little pricey for what you get."], ["Kim U.", "Overall: tasty but overpriced. Still giving it 4 stars because it was tasty. Pros:*Unique selection of dishes*Nicely prepared food*Solid but small wine selection *Great desserts*Good vegetarian selections*Parking available at neighboring businesses after certain hours (a huge plus for 12 South)Cons:*Avoid doing takeout from here - the food does not travel well*Building materials and design makes it incredibly loud when it gets crowded*Staff aren't very friendly or welcoming (waitstaff were great, staff at front & manager types were not)*If you don't like the main flavors/spices they use, they're in everything - for this type of cuisine, I was surprised at how one note the spices were Good for vegetarians? Yes, but only if they vary their menu periodically. Good for kids? I would not take my 4yo here. Can you get in on a Friday night without reservations? Probably not. We scored a table by showing up early. General comments: We made the mistake of trying Epice first as take out. What a disaster - I would have rated it one star based on that experience. We decided to give it another try in-person this time and the experience was completely different. On this visit, we split two appetizers, each had a salad, and split a vegetarian entree. Very tasty, and left enough room for tasty desserts."], ["Chris B.", "Great Mediterranean food, elegant but causal and the service is outstanding. Worth eating here easily. Great for lunch or dinner. Nice twist on very traditional dishes that make them even better. If you want light fair or full meal they have something for you."], ["Adam L.", "First experience with Lebanese food. Everything was excellent. Stuffed Pies app, ground sirloin hummus and spicy fish. Loved it."], ["tyler l.", "I'm in town on business and figured, what better thing to do in Nashville than go for Lebanese food. I know, it sounds off, but think about it... The locals eat southern food all the time and its great, but I'm sure they like to switch it up.Immediately the atmosphere (inside and out, whether you can tell the difference on a warm night as it is an open concept) transplants you to a foreign place, perhaps Lebanon? I don't know, I've never been there... But from photos I've seen I'd say \"sure\". Kudos to the designer. I sat at the bar which is a large slab of Carrara Marble that made me feel at home in homage to DC. I tend to have more fun at bars rather than the tables, and this bar directly opens you up to the interaction with the whole team. From the hour I was there I got to witness what looked to be a charismatic, passionate, and knowledgable group of workers. The workers clearly care about the food, the facility, and each other. I had to refer to what I ordered as a sand castle, and it took me a little while to start to deconstruct the work of art because well, like most decent people I don't like to kick peoples sand castles over. Lamb shanks leaning on thick asparagus stems towering over a mound of a meaty tabbouleh, with little buttery cripsy garlicy potatoes slivers (I cannot call them fries or frittes because they're in a class of their own). I've had a lot of rack of lamb, but this is at the top of the list. The lamb is Cooked medium, juicy, tender, and topped a crunchy pecan crust. I finished my meal of with a chocolate mousse accompanied by what I could only describe as a rich persons version of a cookie crisp cookie (yes like the children's cereal but if Napoleon had a personal chef design one), garnished with fresh raspberries and a few mint leaves to clean your palette. The dessert was prepared by the gentleman who looked to be running the place. I'm done typing and I'd like to go to sleep now :D"], ["Jihye S.", "I visited Nashville for about 6 days. Among the restaurants recommended by my local friends, this one was my favorite. I walked in after their busy lunch hour (2:25) for a take out, and the server was one of the friendliest (yet not over the top) and most professional ones ever. I ordered hummus and a fish special (Sayadeya), and it was impeccably prepared. Really fresh and simple, perfectly cooked and seasoned food, which I find hard to get at some of the high end restaurants. And hummus was the best I have ever had-I know everybody has different standard and preference, but I like mine very smooth, nutty, and not too sour. The only disappointment was the pita bread that came with the hummus..it was a bit tough and dry. (The other flatbread was good, though)I wish I had more days to spend here so I could have tried their dinner. Oh, and the interior is clean, simple and modern without being stuffy or pretentious."], ["Jon C.", "EPICE is the closest thing to authentic Mediterranean in Nashville. Owned by the same family as Kalamatas (another Nashville favorite) this place won't disappoint. The food is incredibly fresh, staff friendly, and the atmosphere takes you out of the city and transports you to New York or San Fran!"], ["Jeremy E.", "I had a top ten meal in Nashville here. Run to this place if you like Lebanese food. If you haven't tried Lebanese food but like Mediterranean/North African flavors, you will love it. They serve tapas and entrees. The hummus is a must try as is the kibbeh. For entrees, their spicy fish is outstanding, as are their two lamb dishes. The lamb rack is pistachio encrusted and is cooked to perfection. The other lamb dish is pressure cooked and the meat is falling off of the bone. Interior is modern and clean and the service has been outstanding for all 3 visits."], ["David G.", "I called about 2 hours ahead on a Friday for reservations, but they were booked. \u00a0However, patio seating is FCFS - we got there a quarter to 7, and got an outside table. We were greeted by the owner and he visited us several more times during our meal. \u00a0Lively fellow! \u00a0I ordered the Sayadeya - a grilled fish entree, and my wife ordered Tawook, a marinated chicken brochette. \u00a0We loved them both. I recommend you substitute the Epice salad for the peasant salad - if you order an entree. \u00a0The fig vinaigrette dressing and goat cheese are lovely together. Both entrees were well seasoned and beautifully presented. Our server made good recommendations - especially on the wine. We ordered a reasonably priced red and finished it there with desert - the chocolate mousse - made by the owners wife (we were told). \u00a0Delicious. Lovely ambiance. Good value for the price. We'll be back, soon, to try the roasted lamb shank. It sounds fantastic!"], ["Michael C.", "Was taken here for the first time on my birthday for lunch; it was fantastic! The decor is amazing; more reminiscent of New York or San Francisco than any other place I'd been to in Nashville. \u00a0I had quite a hard time choosing between the selections on the menu; so many sounded amazing. Our server was so helpful, going into great detail about the 3 items I was having such a dilemma about. I finally chose the spiced fish (with caramelized onions and rice)... what a great choice! \u00a0This was absolutely \u00a0the best fish dish I've had in Nashville. My friend had the Shawarma (sirloin with pickles and onion relish) and raved about it. \u00a0We ended up splitting a desert: the yellow cake with orange blossom syrup. I can't rave about this place enough; it was amazing. I look forward to returning and trying more of the dishes.(Side note: we didn't have reservations, and got there fairly early, but it filled up quick - I would suppose reservations are recommended at nights, especially so on a weekend)."], ["Patrick P.", "Loved the pickled eggplant, humus and the mountain cheese appetizers. Lentil pilaf for main course was great. The sliced vegetables were very flavorful. Mousse for dessert, yummy and just right. Will come back."], ["Konrad U.", "Great place and delicious food. Worth checking out if you're into lebanese food"], ["Stacy T.", "So delicious! Went here for lunch and had a very flavorful meal. The Tawook was delicious and served with a salad and potatoes. Tons of food for a $10 lunch. I'd highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking for something a little different for lunch."], ["Meg S.", "Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish because my meal was unremarkable and disappointing. I ordered the Hummos Beyrouti. I left a good portion of it, claiming fullness. When I make or order hummos, I expect it will be bright with lemon, a little acidic from good olive oil, a little garlicky, and have that distinctive sesame taste from tahini, but what I got was bland and flavorless. I tasted no garlic, no lemon, no tahini, no olive oil. I've had better grocery store hummos. The sirloin was greasy, (maybe olive oil used to top the hummos? I don't know. It didn't taste like olive oil.) bland, and flavorless. I wonder if they use any seasoning and herbs/spices at all when preparing the food. The pine nuts were not adequately toasted, if they were toasted at all, which meant that they had an acrid flavor rather than that rich, nutty, unique pine nut flavor we all know and love. The only thing I appreciated about the hummos was the texture. It was very smooth. They clearly took the time to husk the chickpeas. A good thing. \u00a0The regular pita that came with the meal was fine. There was some pita that appeared to be fried and was a little greasy, with a daub of za'atar, which again, I expect to be more flavorful, but it was not. I don't know how one manages makes a bland za'atar, which should, at a minimum, be redolent of oregano, thyme, savory, basil thyme (yes, that is a thing) and toasted sesame seeds. Two of my best friends operate a spice business and they make their own za'atar. Maybe, based on that, I'm expecting too much, but I don't think so. The only thing about my meal that I truly enjoyed were the pickles, radish and cucumber, that garnished the plate. They were excellent. Why? because they had FLAVOR! I grew up in suburban Detroit, land of excellent Middle Eastern food, so perhaps I am spoiled, because what I ate today at Epice did not impress me as being any better than the food at Kalamatas, with which I have the same flavor issues and is why I will not patronize that place. Other than the bland and uninspired dish that I had, I have no other complaint. The space is beautiful. It is spare, but in a warm and comfortable way which may seem contradictory, but it isn't. It's quite lovely, almost Wrightian (as in Frank Lloyd) in its design, making use of natural materials and horizontal lines in a pleasing way. The owner was manning the door and he was a gracious and welcoming host. Our server, and the service he provided, was excellent. So, given all the raves, it's quite possible that I just ordered the wrong thing. I am willing to give the food another chance to see if that was the case."], ["Carolyn M.", "We came without a reservation, which was a bold move at a new, popular spot in a trendy stretch of town. Some might even call it stupid. The host was unbelievably accommodating in shifting things around to fit us in. Once seating, our server was equally eager to please. The tabouli is awesome - heavy on the parsley, light on the bulgar. Roasted eggplant is also tasty. I had chicken skewers - perfectly cooked meat and peppers with great flavor. Not a huge fan of the side of potatoes. The spicy fish is fantastic. One star down for the atmosphere - it's very pretty, but all that stone makes it L-O-U-D."]]}
