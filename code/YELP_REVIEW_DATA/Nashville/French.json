Call us cheap but we've been wanting to try this place and we didn't want to shell out $100+ for a sit down dinner.We showed up around 5:30 and headed for the lounge area. It was still relatively empty but after 6:00 it started to fill up quickly.We sat at the bar and our bartender was super attentive and quick (even when it was clear that she had a lot of orders coming in). Our drinks were consistently good. We had a total of 5 drinks off of the happy hour cocktail menu and we also ordered two appetizers: ricotta plate and a hummus with pickled veggies. Both were quick to come out and very tasty. I especially liked the hummus because I could tell the pickled veggies were fresh. Our total bill was around $50 (5 cocktails and 2 appetizers) which we both thought was very reasonable because we had great service, awesome food, tasty drinks and a unique atmosphere."], ["Jessica M.", "Enjoyed a girls night out with one of my good friends. Food, drinks & ambiance were all amazing, but the service was phenomenal! Brett was knowledgable, made great recommendations & paced out our courses perfectly!

Fabulous service and lovely wine list!"], ["Erica A.", "I came back after having a really mediocre experience the first time. \u00a0I thought maybe things had improved. \u00a0I came with a group of work people for Happy Hour on a Monday night. \u00a0We went directly upstairs to the lounge. \u00a0The lounge is really nice in terms of ambiance and comfortable couches and spaces to have conversations. \u00a0The service was so slow and we had to remind the waiter several times about our food and drink orders. \u00a0They were also out of a couple of items that we wanted to order. \u00a0It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a glass of wine. The appetizers that we ordered were good (this was a pleasant surprise because on the first visit, most all of the dinners that we ordered were not great by any means). \u00a0The desserts that we ordered including the \"sugar sampler\" were very mediocre. \u00a0The lounge was not busy at all, but they seemed to be staffed with only one very non-experienced waiter / bartender. \u00a0He didn't understand what \"on the rocks\" meant. \u00a0lol \u00a0It is too bad, because this place could be so cool! \u00a0I am imagining it will go out of business and hopefully someone buys it that knows what they are doing."], ["Jennifer N.", "Sinema is a glamorous modern bistro and cocktail lounge, on 8th ave south, and it is a great addition to the wonderful new business development occurring along that corridor. Sinema welcomes you with chic decor, and a sweeping staircase to the upstairs lounge. The decor is old Hollywood glam, complete with art deco finishes, and pictures of Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Bette Davis and others surrounding the dining area. The vibe is cool, but also intimate and romantic. The hostesses were all decked out in their vintage finery, but I did not feel this was a cooler-than-thou crowd. Quite the opposite- the service was immediately friendly, completely lacking in any pretension, and we felt at home at once. We snagged a reservation on one of the first dates open to the public, but this place has no kinks to work out. Everything was running smoothly and, I have to say, pretty perfect. Her name was Lola....our server. Lola, was the absolute best. She really made our evening- delighting us with her recommendations (all of which were spot on), and being friendly and entertaining to boot. The cocktail menu delights with Hollywood and celebrity themed libations, but there was more than clever names here. We both enjoyed our selections, as well as the varied wine offerings. Lola was again a great help in making our choices. We went all out- with appetizers, entrees and a dessert to share. The octopus starter was a delightful and unusual combination of flavors, but I was most impressed with the amazing potato salad accompaniment. We also enjoyed the licorice salad, which was the most unusual combination of flavors- peppermint vinaigrette is not something I would typically pick, but is apparently a specialty of chef Dale Levitski, and lived up to its reputation. We had the Barumundi and the pistacio chicken. Both of these entrees were sensational- a perfect blend of flavors, well prepared and beautifully presented. The dessert selection- again, thanks to Lola- was Stones, a stone fruit compote, with millet cake topped with chamomile cream. Wonderful, light, and again, unique. I was very impressed with Sinema. A new culinary gem for Nashville. To top off all the fine eating- there was a communal and convivial atmosphere as other patrons nearby were sharing recommendations and their enjoyment of each of their courses. A tip for the skirts- there is a remarkable lounge in the women's restroom that I imagine will soon rival the Oak Bar, in its reputation. Make sure to take time to powder your nose, ladies."], ["J R.", "This place has amazing food! I had the chipotle chilaquiles dish and a drink. The mood of Sinema is cool and calm. I'd definitely come back here again for the food and drinks. I wasn't a fan of a valet fee, but it doesn't have anything to do with the ambiance of the restaurant."], ["Anna L.", "I went here on a double date on a Friday night. The ambience was amazing. So retro chic. Bathrooms were gorgeous made feel fabulous!!! Great for taking pictures. We had almost one of everything on the appetizer menu and it was delish. favorite was probably the bread and butters. Very simple but the great on the palette. I ordered the steak which was what I knew and it was great. Melted in my mouth not chewy and bursted with flavors. My date had the venison and it was good. Everything there was fresh to order but didn't take long to come out. Our waitress was very courteous and our drinks never went below half the glass.Would definitely come back."], ["Robert B.", "Our first visit last night to Sinema and it exceeded all expectations. The room is very inviting and fun. The theatre theme is really well done. A perfect place for a group or date night. The service was top notch at Sinema. Seth was engaging but not too engaging. He had great insight on all the dishes, even an infectious enthusiasm for what the \u00a0team in the kitchen was doing that night. His recommendations were spot on all night. Being served by a Pro elevates the entire experience. \u00a0The food was inventive, beautiful and delicious. We felt like the Micheal Jordan of the culinary World had prepared our Appz and Entr\u00e9es. Every dish was plated perfectly and the flavors were abundant.The deserts were straight out of Willie Wonka's imagination. We will never skip desert at Sinema, never!Octopus App was outstanding. This is the only place that reaches the octopus-Nirvana that City House can reachThe Oyster App special was indeed special. The perfectly fried oysters were accompanied by 6 to 7 very unique and delicious sauces. Wasabi caviar was our favorite \u00a0The Beef stroganoff was like having a huge hug from Grandma! Both braised short rib and portion of New York strip makes this a meat lovers dream. The hand made pasta had me wanting more!The Halibut special was outstanding! The piece of pork belly was such a perfect companion to this dish.The deserts were wildly creative! Rocky Road Killer and the Keylime Pie ( This is Willie Wonka Stuff) were crazy good. The plating was so fun and worked so well.We have a rule not to return to a restaurant until we've visited all the ones we have plans around but this will be an exception."], ["Michael M.", "FlawlessThird time was a charm.

Try the Hell on Wheels mezcal cocktail to start! Perfect spicy/smokey level. If they have the fried oysters on special, GET THEM. The dipping sauces are scrumptious. I could have probably just had a bowl and spoon with their sauces as an appetizer. We also tried the octopus...wonderful. For my entree, I had the beef stroganoff."], ["Caity R.", "Breath taking...both positively and negatively. Coming to Sinema while visiting from Los Angeles I didn't know what to expect. At first,and for most of the evening I was thrilled. Our friend who made the reservation is friends with the designer of the restaurant so we were thrilled to see how beautifully everything was done and maintained. Our server Carly was amazing, the bartender made me an amazingly cute cocktail,as it was my 21st birthday. We loved it so much we wanted to stay after our meal and order more cocktails and were told the lounge/bar upstairs was open until 11! Excited,we headed up at 10:20pm and were greeted by chairs on top of the table-and a manager. This is where my breath was taken away negatively. He turned us away..and hey,I've been in the restaurant business. I have actually run a restaurant in downtown LA,so I get that it has probably been a long day. However,that should NEVER be a reason to close the restaurant early. Paying the $450+ we did an excuse like \"we close when we want\" and \" we all have places to be\" is completely unacceptable for a professional manager to tell someone. I walked in thinking \" I would invest in opening this restaurant in LA\" and walked out seeing red because of the unprofessionalism. Good thing people in Nashville are so forgiving."], ["Dawn D.", "We've been here 3 times so far. Each time the menu was different. I like that they try to go with seasons. Really expensive... I like that their menu is original, and sometimes you can't tell what you're about to get based on the description. I like the unique flavor combinations. Last time we got a Falldorf salad (do NOT order, there were 3 lettuce leaves on a plate - too expensive and not that impressive for the half of a handful of food) for a snack and this ricotta and pumpkin spread bread (absolutely delicious!). Then we also ordered the sturgeon, baramundi and the elk. All were really good. Elk was raw instead of medium raw. The sturgeon was everyone's favorite - the sauce it comes with was soupy and delicious. Definitely comforting. The drinks are very overpriced - $12-15 for a cocktail, but good. We also got this pineapple pie and honey honey desserts. Nothing impressive, and dry. We paid ~$250 for this food for 3 people, so you decide whether it's worth a splurge. Overall, a good experience."], ["Paige F.", "I have only been here in the upstairs lounge portion, never for dinner so I cannot review the food that is why I did not give that final star. \u00a0However, the drinks are top notch. \u00a0The bartenders know what they are doing, and they are very attentive. The d\u00e9cor of this place is really cool! Very glamorous. \u00a0It is a comfortable place to grab drinks and hang with your friends. \u00a0I definitely recommend this place for a special evening with friends. I come every time I have visitors in town. I have also heard that they have a great brunch, will have to try it soon!"], ["Shami K.", "Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the octopus appetizer, which I normally would never order but our server had suggested, and it did not disappoint. Drinks were great too. Service was top notch. It was pricier than we anticipated, but well worth it. I had the barramundi for my entree and it was cooked perfectly. The atmosphere was so great that we went upstairs to have a drink at the bar after dinner. Eric and Dan are awesome bartenders! Will definitely be back!"], ["Suzanne F.", "My dad and I went to Sinema a couple of weeks ago, and our expectations were exceeded! Such a gorgeous, relaxing atmosphere. We loved the old portraits of the Hollywood stars and the overall retro vibe. So cool that it's a renovated movie theater. We went on a Monday night around 6 p.m., and just had to wait about 10 minutes. While we waited, we explored upstairs in the bar/lounge area. We sat down on one of the gorgeous couches. A nice bartender immediately served us two glasses of water. Seriously the best water I've had, no joke. We went back downstairs a few minutes later, and our table was ready. We had a fabulous waiter, Matt. So polite and knowledgable about the entire menu. We ordered the sausage and grits, scallops, and bread and butter appetizers. (Yes, we definitely splurged this night). Everything was delicious. Best scallops I've had. Bread and butter was extremely unique, and the mango butter was my favorite. Delicious sausage served with the grits. For our main dishes, I got the flounder and shrimp, and my dad got the lamb. Both delightful and unusual. Excellently prepared and served quickly. At one point, my dad finished his last bite of one of the dishes, and we laughed so hard because our waiter Matt swiped up the dish immediately before it even touched the table again. Haha. Very thorough. For dessert we had the sugar board. Most unique dessert I've seen! Wonderful homemade marshmallows, hard candy, samoa cookies, chocolate mint meringue and more! Absolutely wonderful, and we will be returning very soon, (and asking for Matt)! Also, be sure to go to the bathrooms! So neat. The women's is more elaborate than the men's. Got to love the retro make up mirrors and flashing Elvis portrait. An overall wonderful experience that didn't miss a beat."], ["Jeff M.", "The entire experience was perfection. We were greated and seated right away ( we had a reservation) for Sunday brunch. The waiter was well informed and took his time to explain the unusual fare. The decor continued to carry out the movie theater theme. What fun that was!! \u00a0I had the seafood, which arrived in a piping hot pastry. My wife had the stuffed, grilled cheese. We ordered a side of new potatoes. All was so delicious. We will return and bring guests with us"], ["Todd G.", "I've been here for drinks and was impressed with all aspects of that visit. Last night was dinner. \u00a0Totally fabulous. Truffle dumplings to start and a fish/shrimp main. Everything cooked perfectly, each sauce was unique and delicious, elevating the dish in unexpected ways. The sauce for the seafood had a smoky component that was super, for example. My wife had the filet and thought it to be 1st rate, equal to big name steakhouses \u00a0Service was perfect, drinks and wine as good as previously experienced. Tables were not slammed together to maximize seats, much appreciated. \u00a0The location is a little odd and I can't forget that the building was a bowling alley and many other forgettable businesses over the last 20 years, so I don't think about Sinema as a choice when planning a night out. But this place is worth keeping in mind..."], ["Zeke T.", "We went for Sunday brunch and were delighted. The atmosphere is stylish and fun. The staff is friendly and timely.

We stopped by the Franklin Farmers Market on Saturday morning. It's been a while since I've been to the farmers market in Franklin, I was surprised with how many booths and people were there. Anyway, we made our way to Crepe A Diem. They were easy to spot because of the red truck AND the long line. If a food truck has a line, you know it's good. We skimmed the menu and decided on getting a couple things and sharing them. We decided on the Louisiana crepe, which consists of Andouille sausage, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and red pepper - Rouille sauce ($8.50). We ordered the garden sausage sandwich, local pork, spices and fresh basil, scrambled farm egg, sharp cheddar cheese on a croissant ($8.50). We ordered both sides, hash brown, potato au-gratin with cheddar and chives ($3.99) and cheese grits, 'Beaver Dam Creek' local stone-ground grits with parmesan cheese and roasted tomato, garnished with sweet local basil ($4.99). And if that wasn't enough, we got the cinnamon and sugar crepe, Hatcher Dairy butter, cinnamon sugar, maple syrup ($4.50). You can tell they really work fast in that truck, it didn't take but ten minutes maybe for all the food to come out. I've always thought that most food trucks usually charge more than one would pay in a restaurant. This might be because of the convenience of it, but I think Crepe A Diem's prices are spot on. You get QUALITY food and it's not a little portion either. This garden sausage sandwich was a monster. I really loved the pork sausage inside, it was seasoned well and paired well with the cheese. Same goes for the Louisiana crepe. The sausage in that was so flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of red peppers or onions but loved this. The sides were great as well. This hash brown is probably one of the best I've ever had. I like this thing better than most places french fries. And the grits, can you say 'cheese'!? I've never really liked grits but this these didn't taste like your average grits. Lastly the cinnamon sugar crepe was a nice way to cleanse the palate after a hearty breakfast from Crepe A Diem. We will be back."], ["Johnny T.", "4.5I haven't had the occasion to frequent many food trucks in Nashville yet (I hope to change that this year) but Crepe A Diem sets the bar very high for the rest of my truck encounters. There's a reason so many people are enamored with this bright red truck of French goodies. From what I've seen, the food truck market might have an edge on Nashville's brick & mortar scene wrt diversity. Maybe.What's not a 'maybe' is that CaD is serving up terrific food. I was hungry when I got to the truck so eating ASAP was on my agenda. I ran across their offerings at the 12 South Farmers Market and it just so happened that earlier I was chatting up the Hummus Chick (seriously. If you like hummus, find her; her product is tEh awesome\u2122) and she told me that the truck was featuring her hummus in the Java Sandwich. Sold. I wanted to buy some tubs of the hummus, but I had many errands to run before heading home and it was a particularly warm early autumn day. I don't know if hummus spoils but I didn't want to take a chance. What I did want to do, though, was eat a sandwich with that hummus. So it came to pass that I stood in front of the CaD truck... and did not order a crepe.However, I didn't choose wrong. My vegetarian sandwich was a rocking journey of flavor and newness. For all those who think that food truck cuisine is greasy, simple and pedestrian, I challenge you to eat from CaD and keep that mindset. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the fact that it took a little bit (not long, just not instant) to prepare. It made me feel as though my order was special and made just for me. CaD has a seasonal menu so I'm guessing my Java is a thing of the past but I have enough trust in the brains behind the butter that the current savory and sweet creations are just as fantastic. I will track them down again. I withheld a half star for the cost of a beverage. My pomegranate San Pellegrino was delicious but at $3, I have admit I winced just a little bit. But still... I have no regrets. Vive la France!"], ["Shawny M.", "Magnifique! This is a wonderful little food truck. I ordered the apricot and brie crepe with almonds and honey. Wow, delicious.

This is not the case at Crepe A Diem, where made-to-order is used as an excuse for a poorly-run kitchen staffed by people who recite all the above catchphrases but have clearly not been trained to multitask when serving food that is only so-so. I recently gave the truck a try at the Franklin Farmer's Market, which is always crowded so you have to expect a reasonable wait. I counted 4 orders ahead of mine, and waited...and waited...and waited. I'm a pretty patient person but when I've waited 20+ minutes, know my order should be next, and am watching my food get cold because the counter server is busy refilling the coffee pot as the one who brings food to the window just piles up the orders rather than passing them out herself until the manager finally noticed and asked her to do so, all as the line grows longer and longer, my patience wears thin. It would be one thing to wait 5 minutes per order if the crepe has been outrageously good, but it wasn't. My lukewarm Parisian was okay, but nothing special. \u00a0It's a glorified ham sandwich on a crepe that's just a little too thick - the batter needs more liquid & less sugar. Not worth the trouble or the $8."], ["Michelle C.", "You cannot go wrong with a crepe from Crepe A Diem. I had the Louisiana-style crepe and it was packed full of flavor.

Every bite was pure heaven. The cheese, ham and flaky, crepe goodness were just magical when combined. I opted for a savory crepe this time around, but the dessert options looked just as tempting, and I know I'll be trying them soon.Also of note, they were nice enough to sell us a loaf of their french bread, even though it wasn't part of the menu. They even gave us some of their house made butter to go with it! Really nice folks!I wish I had photographed the 8 or so jars of Nutella displayed on a shelf inside the truck.

Two of us ordered an French style octopus appetizer. Warm bread arrived about 5 minutes after we ordered our food. I ordered a quail \u00a0dish; that was possible one of the best dishes I've had. My date ordered savory lamb dish. Our entrees arrived in a timely manner. The entrees were enjoyed by all, but the dishes were kind of small. I wished I had more on the plate to enjoy. After diner 2 of us ordered a strawberry and chocolate dish. Again the only negative was the dish was too small for 2 to enjoy. Total we paid $109.00 and that was before tip.

It was good, but I don't think I would order it again. \u00a0This place is tiny, and the menu was somewhat limited. \u00a0Still, we had impeccable service and a wonderful time.

Waaa tha..?!?!As I turned off the main drag of Charlotte, and up the hill past Bobbie's Dairy Dip, I immediately loved Miel's design, including the beautiful patio next to this small structure.Miel's parking is funny though. They have their own lot, but it's further down the street on the other side of a run-down house. While it's not far at all, the house seems so out of place. Wackiness that is West I suppose.The interior decor is modern, simple, clean, and inviting. The bar is small, and seemed a little cramped so close to the entryway, but my little butt has had zero problems hanging out during their great happy hour.My food experiences have been mixed here. My first visit was for full dinner service, and I was not overly impressed with the quality of the dishes for the price. Classic French cuisine? Yes. Executed immaculately? No. My seafood dish was drenched in truffle oil. It was just too much.Despite this, I have returned several times for happy hour and tried other food items - including a few from the full menu. I eventually discovered that any seasonal soups they offer are worth ordering. Each and every one of them have been delicious, created from items grown in their own garden.They offer $5.00 Happy Hour cocktails often topped off with fruits and herbs from their garden, and some of which are grown right there on site!Miel also offers a \"Barn\" for smaller private functions. I have yet to tour it, but it sure does look cozy from the exterior."], ["Katie B.", "I live in Sylvan Park, and since I moved to the neighborhood, Miel has become one of my favorite places to eat on a regular basis. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable, and it's never over-crowded. They remain consistently busy, but I never feel as though I have to fight for a table or a reservation. The only reason I don't give Miel the full 5 stars is due to the service. As I mention above, I've eaten there frequently, and almost every experience with the servers has been either awkward or spotty in terms of attentiveness. The owner, Seema, is wonderful and professional. However, the waitstaff is hit-or-miss. For example, my past three meals: 1.) The server was a little overly-solicitous, gave belabored and long explanations of the menu, and hung around our table to chat for an inappropriate amount of time. While she was very friendly, she seemed a little scattered, and as one of my companions observed, it felt as if we were \"babysitting\" her.2.) A different server, very competent and professional, but very brusque and almost curt. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I don't expect a server to be my best friend (see #1), but it would be nice to have a friendly interaction. Maybe he was just having a bad night.3.) We had yet another server almost ignore us most of the night. We were not a large party, and the restaurant wasn't terribly busy. We *were* chatting quite a bit, so it was nice that he was unobtrusive. However, we would go for long stretches without seeing him at all--when we were first seated, we sat with our menus in front of us for almost 10 minutes without an inquiry about our drink orders, or even an appetizer. And at the end of the meal, we waited for another 10 or so minutes for him to walk by so we could ask for our check.Again, I love this place, and it's entirely possible I've just had these particular servers at awkward times. But it's become a pattern in what would otherwise be a perfect dining spot."], ["Chaye S.", "Stunning experience from the initial reservation call all the way through the dining experience. The service, food, ambience and passion for every detail was simply phenomenal. The server was attentive and proactive in her approach- the kitchen was flexible with dietary requests and executed them as if they were dishes prepared hundreds of times before. Well done! Extraordinary service has not become extinct- it is alive and thriving at Miel."], ["Aaron F.", "We've been twice now, and it's been absolutely stellar both times.We started with the roasted bone marrow with toast and caramelized onions. We were excited as we hadn't ever had bone marrow. It was wonderfully prepared, almost decadent, and that slight hint of taboo of a dish not so common in the US made it all the better. Marrow, onions and the toast made a delicious combination. I had the Duck Leg Confit. I've had duck confit many times, several in France, and that was the best duck I've ever had. Fall off the bone, rich with duck fat, absolutely tender. The lentil and carrot bed was a perfect balance. The turnips were good--not spectacular. My fianc\u00e9e had the Braised Pork Shoulder. With mozzarella, gnocchi, and was utterly mouth wateringly delectable. I had a perfectly concocted old fashioned, complete with marinated cherries and red orange slice. My fianc\u00e9e had the Goose Island Matilda. Wow. It's aged five years, is called a Belgian style pale ale, but has such a perfect sweetness to balance the hops. Must find the Matilda out in the wild. Miel seems like a hidden gem of West Nashville. It's perfectly clear why they've been able to stay open so long and be so successful, it's because meals like that one last night will have me picking Miel over absolutely any other restaurant in Nashville on any given night.Miel is the best of Nashville, at the very least."], ["Queen B.", "8 stars.Absolutely no complaints.From the guy tending bar, to our waitress..A spoonful sample of the chicken liver mousse.Unsalted fresh butter on the table.Linen table cloths.We started with a glass of house burgundy that was absolutely delightful and light..So very good.Then came the lamb fries delicately rolled in panko bread crumbs and fried..

It is charming and intimate and the menu is always exceptional! The owner, Seema is a treasure and her restaurant is not to be missed!

I will be a regular for sure!"], ["Ian F.", "Miel was outstanding from the moment we walked in. *Good atmosphere*Friendly staff*Fast service We started with the cheese plate which was regionally sourced. I got steak and my two lady friends got fish: halibut - trout. Everything was perfect and everyone was very pleased! All the veggies were fresh, in season which made all the difference. Complimentary bread and a chef muse rounded out the experience. Overall, the atmosphere is relaxed and quiet. \u00a0 I would recommend to anyone looking for a new spot to try!"], ["Bridgette C.", "I hadn't been here in years and so when Style Blueprint had a deal for it, I jumped on it. \u00a0I'd forgotten who much I enjoyed this small hidden gem off Charlotte. \u00a0You get an amuse-bouche to start, and they have delicious homemade bread. \u00a0I had their scallops with gnocchi and Brussel sprouts and my mother had trout with sweet carrots. \u00a0Both dishes were amazing. \u00a0Miel is a little pricey but they have great selections and service and the price is worth the meal. \u00a0I recommend getting reservations as it's a small space. \u00a0But it's beautiful, delicious, and fun food to eat. \u00a0It's a great place for a date night!"], ["Jen S.", "Can't say enough good things about this place -- owner Seema is great! Personable, professional, accommodating, smart, and offers incredible food with the service to match. Threw a couple of work events here in the barn/patio/restaurant and everyone was blown away. They make me look good! Next time we'll be sure to personally applaud the chef because he deserves to know how much everyone enjoyed his food. FYI that they are very conscious of using fresh/local foods & avoiding food waste. Highly recommend."], ["Elizabeth M.", "Absolutely lovely in every way. The octopus was divine - large lima beans and colorful peppers and incredibly tender octopus.....soooo flavorful. The trout was outstanding. I never eat the skin on fish, and I ate it all up (as did my 3-year-old son!). The banana tres leches dessert was divine. All of it was elegantly and creatively presented. And the space is so inviting - amazing use of church pews! A contemporary yet soothing environment. We absolutely loved it and will be back. This is a bit of a hidden gem - a little off the beaten path because of its location. Fabulous!"], ["Sadie W.", "Have eaten here 6 times, from soup & a cocktail at the bar to a five-course meal in the barn. Every time is a treat, we are greeted like regulars and the food is exceptional. So of the season, so fresh, and interestingly prepared. Yes, it's pricey, and yes, it's small. But we've never felt rushed, it's always a special evening, even when it's just a normal Wednesday night."], ["Tom K.", "We dined at Miel last week. \u00a0I had the halibut and it was outstanding! \u00a0The food was superb and the service was first rate. \u00a0I highly recommend this spot."], ["Ginger J.", "I thought the food was okay. \u00a0My sister-in-law had fish with shrimp which was super fishy, and my brother had the cow cheek. \u00a0It wasn't good. \u00a0I had the gnocchi with pulled pork which was amazing. \u00a0The cheese plate was really good too. \u00a0Just not the best meal we have had! \u00a0In fact, my brother went over the Hattie B's afterward, so he could feel satisfied that he had a good meal!"], ["Lauren W.", "The moral of the story is: Do not go to Miel with a 12 person party (even if you call ahead and they say they can handle it).I arrived a bit earlier than everyone else so we were able to take advantage of their happy hour deal and snag a $5 strawberry mojito. This drink was fresh and the strawberries were sweet. This might be one of the best happy hour cocktails I've had in a while. Probably because you can't get more springy than strawberries. Later on in the evening I ordered an Old Fashioned after someone else ordered it and let me have a taste. It was a great stiff drink; not too sweet the way some bartenders tend to make them.Miel started us off with an amuse-bouche of pork terrine and cornishon on a cracker. I'm always a fan of chefs that start the meal of with an amuse-bouche. It gives the diner a taste of what is to come and let's us get to know our chef's palate. This was a very simple dish, but it was quite tasty. Everyone at the table enjoyed this.We ordered escargot for the appetizer. We haven't had escargot in years and we certainly aren't experts on the dish. I thought the snails were cooked well and tender. I was also a fan that they came already de-shelled. Steve thought that some of the snails had an odd bitter taste, but he liked the texture. But we both agreed that the herb butter sauce served over the escargot was amazing. I even had to ask for another round of bread so I could soak up all the sauce. I'm a dipper at heart, baby.For dinner I ordered the duck breast (shocker!) and rillette with farro and chow-chow. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium rare with the right color red in the center. I also enjoyed how thinly the breast was sliced. The dish was great, but I felt it was a little small for the $29 price tag. Steve ordered the scallops with truffle and a lemon preserve. Steve loved this dish, mostly because he is a big fan of lemons. Another friend ordered the same dish and she found the lemon preserve just too sweet and didn't eat it at all. For the price, I felt like they should have served more than just 3 scallops. If they served 4 or 5, I think that would be more of an entree size meal.Everything was great until it was time to pay our checks. But to explain this fully, it requires a bit of back story. Miel is a small restaurant and the birthday girl wanted to make sure they could accommodate a 12 person party. After a bunch of back and forth with the owner, they decided that we would be offered a reduced size prix fixe menu. When we heard about this, we were excited. The birthday girl was supposed to get a copy of the menu the week before the dinner, but she never received one. After emailing with the owner and not getting any responses, she passed this task off to a friend to try and handle. So we were all surprised and confused when we sat down and were handed the regular full menu. Weren't we having a set menu at a preset price? NOPE! I guess Miel forgot all about that.Ok, so we moved on and made the best of it which was easy to do because everything on their menu sounded amazing. Our waitress was very meticulous about taking orders and did them clockwise around the table. She even asked each person if their ticket was split or shared at the beginning of the meal. Everything seemed under control until our checks arrived. They were all wrong. I think out of our 12 person party, about 8 people had wrong tickets, including our friend Anna who had EVERY dessert on her tab. So when we explained to our waitress what went wrong, she took all the tickets away and promised to come back with them corrected. THEN A LOT OF TIME WENT BY.She came back and was apologetic and said that the computer had gone haywire and was messing up our tickets. When I got my next ticket, it was also wrong. There was an extra dessert on it and an entree I didn't order. So we told the waitress again, who took our tickets, and then DISAPPEARED AGAIN FOR SOME TIME.The next ticket I got had a steak and something else on it. Not even close to my meal. The waitress then asked me to tell her exactly what I had so that she could start over and run it as a new ticket. They brought back the revised ticket, she said they had already charged it to a card. It wasn't my card, but Steve's. Do we look the same? Do I look like a Steve? So, Steve paid for my dinner and I had to pay for his. When I told the staff that I didn't appreciate it because my meal was more expensive than his and he shouldn't have to pay for what he didn't eat, THEY OFFERED TO CHARGE MY CARD MORE AND GIVE ME CASH TO PAY STEVE BACK. Umm.... nope. A restaurant is not an ATM. Honestly, the food was amazing. The chefs are clearly doing something right. And I would totally go back to eat there, but I would not go with a party larger than 4. They seem unable to handle that."], ["Rachel L.", "I am shocked at how high of a rating that this restaurant has! I was excited to eat here on new years eve, but was sorely disappointed. \u00a0The service was absolutely terrible. \u00a0I know that it was nye, but we ate early at 5:30 for that reason. It took at least 15 min before the waiter took our order, \u00a0then after our appetizers came, we watched the table next to us (who sat down after us and had a larger party) get their meal and nearly finish before we got ours. During that time, my boyfriend expressed his dissatisfaction to who we assume was the manager - a grey-haired man that greeted us- but we still waited for what seemed like forever for our entr\u00e9e. He never did anything to make our visit better. \u00a0When our entree finally came, it was mediocre and bland at best. \u00a0Our waiter forgot multiple things that we asked for, and never explained or apologized for the delay in service... he actually avoided our table!! I have never written a review on yelp, \u00a0but I was so upset after spending a huge chunk of change on a crappy meal, that I had to. I have been a waitress for 10 years, so I know good and bad service when I experience it. I understand how difficult it can be to provide good service, but this place was just disgraceful."], ["Keith S.", "Great ambience and service. \u00a0Best risotto anywhere!"], ["G W.", "Meh. \u00a0Too expensive for what it was. \u00a0Plus the hostess tried to seat the two of us in a dark corner by the kitchen at a high-top table when we had reservations and the main dining room was mostly empty. \u00a0Inexplicable."], ["John L.", "This is the best restaurant we've eaten at in our trip to Nashville. We would eat here again. It's hard for us to judge the atmosphere and noise level because we went on a Sunday evening when only a few tables were seated. The food was excellent, though, and the service was very good as well. My wife ordered a vegetable plate for dinner, which sounds boring but wasn't at all. The vegetables were delicious and the plate included several different preparations. I had beef cheeks with charred cabbage, it was totally delicious. The beef cheeks were incredibly tender. We also had a delicious appetizer of radishes on toast, and the profiteroles for dessert were very good."], ["Christina V.", "My wife and I just went to Miel for the first time since our baby was born. We ate out in the back patio to soak up some late afternoon sun with our meal, and it was the very best choice for our first night out in many months. \u00a0We had: strawberry soup (amazing), olives (delicious and nutty), 1 glass of the vino verde -- all just $5 each due to us getting there at 5:30 for happy hour. We also split a meal -- short rib steak with sunchokes (best I have ever had), kale, an meat so tender you could cut it with your fork. The waiter forgot to fill my water (confession, am a water guzzler), but Seema caught it and filled it when I wasn't looking. We also to extra of their amazing french bread with the salty crust, gratis. \u00a0A very delicious meal...well worth the cost of it & the babysitter."], ["Adam F.", "Went on a Wednesday and it was not very busy which made it more romantic. Our server Scott was perfect: attentive but not overbearing with excellent suggestions. We expected good food and got amazing food. Eggplant toast was legit, a tiny bit too salty, but still very delicious. Seafood stew and pork shoulder entrees were full of bold, yet balanced flavors and serving sizes were medium to large which makes the price easier to swallow. Go there now. Worth it."], ["Karen G.", "I can't wait to visit Seema at Miel again. Fantastic wine list. Seema knows more than a little something about the vine. The trout, smoked quail and the painted short rib steak were perfect prepared and the fresh local vegetables were crisp and very fresh. \u00a0I had okra with my meal! .When was the last time you had okra in an upscale restaurant? The cheese plate was delicious and from local farms It was amazing. We shared the carrot cake which is more like a coffee cake in that it had a nice crumble without being dry. The sauce served with it and the toasted pecan were divine! I love the ambiance of Miel, its slick and sexy yet very comfortable. This is a great place and I'm looking forward to my next trip."], ["Diana S.", "Really good dinner. They do French bistro food very well. The cocktail I ordered was nothing like what I have had before when ordering it (Pimm's Cup) but to their credit they offered to adjust it or give me something else. The green salad was okay - nothing special - the usual mesclun greens, some chopped apple, a slice of cheese- you know the drill.The chicken pate terrine was interesting. The pate was good but there was no terrine, just the p\u00e2t\u00e9. Beet salad was good, but fairly brief, like the green salad. The entrees were where Miel shined. The roasted chicken was juicy and came easily off the bone and was well complimented by Napa cabbage, wheat berries, pecans and a deep citrus sauce. The farro, mushroom and Gouda was like a more toothsome risotto and the trout was fresh and went perfectly well with the rich lemon butter sauce. All in all, Miel provided a nice, upscale dining experience with attentive servers and delicious food."], ["Lou Ann B.", "Another wonderful dinner at Miel. What sets this place apart is the food quality. If you are careful about what you eat, this is the place to dine-- there is nothing on your plate to bulk it up or round it out. Every morsel is carefully thought out and totally delicious. I left feeling that I had been fed through my eye and my belly, as the meal was artful, intelligent and delicious. Smoked quail, short rib steak and pork shoulder entrees were resounding hits. Shaved squash salad was beautiful and tasty. This is Nashville's best restaurant."], ["Linda Y.", "Didn't eat my dinner. We had eaten here when it first opened and really liked it a lot but came away very disappointed this time."], ["Sejal M.", "Great meal and service. I was impressed there is a vegetarian entr\u00e9e, albeit a little oversalted. But hey, it was tasty! Good service."], ["Kira S.", "Having lived in the neighborhood since before Miel opened, my husband and I are horribly embarrassed that we hadn't visited Miel, so we took the opportunity to dine here on a Sunday night before heading to a concert. We made reservations for 5:30 to give ourselves plenty of time and were the first diners through the door that night. We were cordially welcomed and escorted to our seats.Our server got us a decanter for the wine we brought, and we ordered cocktails to enjoy while our wine breathed. My Negroni and my husband's Old Fashioned were very good, very large, and very strong. Nice to know that they don't skimp on the hard stuff.We started with the snail ravioli in a cream sauce and the sweetbreads, which came on an apple puree. Both dishes were divine. The ravioli encasing the snails was so thin it was nearly translucent. The apple puree brought out the sweetness of the sweetbreads while playing off the fried exterior.After lightheartedly arguing over who would order what, I claimed the pork shoulder, and my husband ordered the flank steak. Unfortunately, the pork shoulder was far, far too salty. My husband fared much better. The creamed kale accompanying his perfectly cooked medium rare steak was a twist on the steakhouse standard creamed spinach with the cream cutting any bitterness from the kale.Once again, we couldn't decide on a dessert to split, so we got two. I preferred the Meyer lemon tart, a thin slice of sweet/tart curd perched on a caramel sauce. My husband's profiteroles with dark chocolate sauce were just okay.The restaurant itself is the perfect size - not too large but with enough nooks and crannies that a variety of party sizes can be comfortable. We will not forget about Miel again!"], ["Christa P.", "Has a lot of potential. Went there and out of 2 different dishes we were going to order. Waiter didn't inform us they were out until after we ordered. Ended up doing duck and lamb- both were very good - well seasoned, good temperature, but on the small side. The sauce was really good and the amuse was really delish. We did a scallop appetizer and 2 of the scallops were seared perfectly, while one came out almost on the side of ceviche. The bread pudding was really good. Other disappointing aspect is really bad marketing and promotion. I don't get emails with updates on menu or events, and the events are always behind on their website and never listed on facebook."], ["Meg G.", "We arrived an hour early for dinner and they graciously seated us. Our waitress brought out the menu and told us there were happy hour specials. When we asked what they were, she didn't know and had to get back to us. She asked if we had menu questions and directly followed it up with 'everything is listed on the menu'. I had a nice beet salad and my husband had good warm kale salad with pork belly. There was a delay for entrees, but they came out nice and hot. I had the steak with potatoes and a chutney of some sort. I couldn't remember what it was and asked the waitress (it was delicious). Again, she didn't know and had to go read the menu (it was short ribs, raisins and mustard seeds- very yummy). Asked what a garnish was on my husband's plate- again, no clue. It was a good meal, but the lack of knowledge of our seemingly experienced waitress frustrated us immensely."], ["Joanie B.", "We've been coming here for years and are always so pleased with our meal. Long before the half dozen trendy farm to table restaurants (which we support) popped up all serving variations on the same food, Miel has been there, French and fresh, surrounded by herb gardens, with attentive and knowledgeable staff, superior but not fussy food, and a sophisticated but approachable wine list. What can I say - it makes me happy to eat here. Sometimes we go full throttle, ordering every course and big wine. And, then others its a glass of wine and a bowl of bouillabaisse (delish). Either way, Miel never disappoints. The neighborhood is less than trendy (though slowly improving) but its worth discovering this precious gem. Let's say it together... \"I heart duck confit!\""], ["Mina K.", "My husband and I live in Sylvan Park and we were very excited to not only celebrate NYE but our anniversary at Miel. \u00a0Especially since he had never been. \u00a0From the moment we sat down we experienced horrible service. \u00a0We waited 15 min and then my husband had to go in search of a waiter. \u00a0One arrived without apology and took our drink order which took way too long. I understand it was NYE however this is a small restaurant with a set NYE menu. \u00a0I have worked in the restaurant industry and know how the service should be. \u00a0We were sent several emails and even a phone call confirming our reservation but once we got there its as if we were the forgotten table. \u00a0Since the menu was set they felt the need to add a 20% tip which was basically robbery for the sub par service we received. \u00a0I hate to give Miel such a low rating because the food was good and dishes were creative however bad service can ruin a meal much like it did here. \u00a0We try to support our local restaurants so we will go back and give it one more chance. \u00a0Hopefully the owner will be more selective when hiring wait staff in the future. \u00a0If you are going to serve high end meals then have high end servers that know how to do their job."], ["Rhonda C.", "Web for a wine tasting and stayed for dinner.

The baby carrots I had, for example, were as sweet and delicious as any carrots I have ever tasted anywhere, and that is because they were probably pulled from the ground the same morning and were perfectly prepared.

The chef has truly hit his stride and everything was wonderful! \u00a0We sampled many different things and were wowed by them all. Both the arugula/fennel salad and the white bean /duck confit sald were sensational. The beef cheeks were melt in your mouth good and the rabbit confit farro dish with goat cheese, greens and pumpkins seeds was what food lover's dreams are made of! \u00a0We finished the meal with 3 small mincemeat pies (like miniature fried pies) which were a flaky and buttery sensation. The recipe was from an old 1800's recipe and was both unique and scrumptous! I don't know what is going on at Miel but it is all good. \u00a0Seema \u00a0is delightful as always and you can see her attention to detail everywhere. We have all had meals prepared by chef Uhlhorn in the past but he seems to shine here and is truly making his mark. \u00a0I strongly recommend putting Miel in your \"must go to \" column of restaurants. Even if you have been in the past and had a good experience you will be amazed by it now! \u00a0Miel is truly one of Nashville's finest!"], ["Ed K.", "Consistently great every time. \u00a0Don't ignore the vegetables on your plate. \u00a0Many do and they're missing the flavor of true, cultivated vegetables. \u00a0I mean, you'll look at carrots, cauliflower and turnips in a different light.Update 5/14...still outstanding. \u00a0Their pato is VERY relaxing."], ["Dusty K.", "Oui oui mon ami!Miel is casual dining with upscale food. It's the type of restaurant I really enjoy eating at these days - locally sourced ingredients served from an open kitchen concept where you can really see the chefs in action behind the counter. The aromas, the warmth, I dug this place. It is on the pricier side but it's not stuffy which I found welcoming. On a Wednesday the place was half full and they did a great job of spreading out the diners as opposed to cramming everyone into one small section. And I appreciate the attention to detail as they more than catered to a vegetarian diner.My lavender lemonade was fantastic. Bright and citrusy with the punch of lavender. This is what summer in a glass tastes like. The cheese platter to start was devoured instantly. I loved the uniqueness of the three cheeses, toasted almonds, grapes, honey and thinly sliced fruit. It's what I picture my casual french lunches to be one day when visiting France in the future.I went with the chicken which was tender and mostly de-boned but still juicy and flavorful. I was told it was sous vide for over 12 hours and finished in a pan to crisp up the skin. The citrus flavor came through wonderfully and played well with the richer broth everything was served over. The roasted veg on the side was perfect; potatoes, green beans, cauliflower, carrots, delicious. I was dipping them in the broth and slowly drifting off to another world. I closed with the apple galette and ordered cinnamon ice cream on the side. The galette wasn't an all time favorite but the cinnamon ice cream was so great it gave me ideas for the upcoming Thanksgiving dessert. Expensive but not outrageous, Miel provides a great bang for the buck. The casual atmosphere made me feel at home while eating wonderfully prepared and presented food. If you're skiddish about French cuisine or a holier than thou attitude, Miel is a great place to start."], ["B L.", "A solid 4.5 stars. \u00a0Located on unassuming 53rd st, this restaurant is one of the better in Nashville. Miel is located in a small building across the street from a Krystal. \u00a0You can park on the street or in a lot 2 doors down. \u00a0The decor is perfectly minimal- dark wood and \u00a0white tablecloths. The service was unintrusive, and the servers make their own drinks at a small bar in the dining room. \u00a0The menu has a variety of interesting options starting with a specialty cocktail list. \u00a0The wine list is a little short, but diverse with several rare gems not previously seen on wine lists here. \u00a0The appetizers our table sampled were the cheese plate- an offering of local cheeses and honey, and the beet salad- which Mr B.L. sadly informed me was better than the one I make (which for the record is delicious). \u00a0For entrees they offer lamb, venison, fish, chicken, beef, a bouillabaisse and a risotto. \u00a0We sampled the risotto with scallops, beef tenderloin, and the special of the evening which was pork belly and scallops. \u00a0All were tasty. \u00a0We did all agree that the food was slightly underseasoned, but well conceived and prepared. \u00a0 The portions were a nice size, and where possible it looks like they use local ingredients. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["Steve P.", "Absolutely fabulous...my wife's birthday was the start for the evening. \u00a0My theme was a prep for our upcoming trip to France and this place was spot on! \u00a0The owner is hands on--food is meticulously prepared, quaint and intimate setting rounded out the evening. \u00a0We will be back!"], ["Jeremy E.", "Absolutely delicious. My friend and I went last night with pretty high hopes. We were not disappointed. We had to wait a few minutes when we first arrived as they prepared us a table, and had a chance to chat up the manager. She was very friendly and inviting, and recommended a few of her favorite dishes. The decor is warm and classic. Very fitting with the food vibe they put out. My ONE complaint, is that the music pretty much sucked the entire time. I would have loved some Bossa Nova or jazz. Instead, I got Modest Mouse and something that sounded like a bad interpretation of Nine inch Nails. Moving on....The service was excellent. She was attentive but non-threatening or imposing. We were able to continue conversation as she attended to the table. The food was just incredible. We started with the duck confit salad and the foie gras. Both were made meticulously with a real attention to detail. The pickled pears and salted almond crumbles added a wonderful blend of sweet, salty and crunch to the foie gras. Entrees were the venison and braised lamb shank. Again, cooked to perfection. I have never quite enjoyed lamb as much as I did here. It had great lamb flavor and was falling off the bone as I ate it. Gelatinous, savory, with a touch of sweet. Perfection. I had the profiteroles to finish up. Flaky, light pastry balls filled with cream, and topped with warm Belgian chocolate sauce. It is as good as it sounds....A definite food gem."], ["Adina K.", "We were visiting Nashville for the weekend and Miel was recommended to us. \u00a0I'm so glad we were clued in to this gem of a restaurant, because we had an outstanding evening there.When I called to make a reservation, the hostess asked if we had any food allergies or preferences. \u00a0I have never been asked that question in advance before, but seriously, what a brilliant idea. \u00a0I explained that we don't eat gluten. \u00a0I was told that would not be an issue (a total relief, as living gluten free is new for me and so it's something I am constantly worrying about when I go out now). \u00a0So even before we arrived I had a good feeling about the place.On to the meal...Cocktails:I had an Eagle Rare Single Barrel on the rocks. \u00a0It's a rarity to find that bourbon at restaurants, so I was tickled that they served it. \u00a0S had a gin and tonic with Farmer's Organic Gin. \u00a0She loved the gin. \u00a0I was pleased that they use Fever Tree Mixers. \u00a0It is a personal pet peeve of mine when nice restaurants dilute excellent spirits with mixers laden with corn syrup. \u00a0It tastes syrupy and ruins the flavor of the entire drink. \u00a0Meal:Our server brought out gluten-free crackers and butter instead of bread! \u00a0I was so happy I wanted to cry. \u00a0I had the sweetbreads appetizer, a special that evening. \u00a0It was served with fried red okra and sauteed green beans and mushrooms. \u00a0The fried okra was delicious, and I'm not even a fan of okra. \u00a0Usually I find it slimy. \u00a0The beans and mushrooms tasted like they had been in the ground literally an hour ago, that's how fresh they were. \u00a0The sweetbreads were cooked perfectly. \u00a0There was definitely some soy sauce (gluten-free!) in the dish, and the umami flavor of the soy and the mushroom really brought out the richness of the sweetbreads. \u00a0Several times while eating this dish, I had to pause and just look at S with complete contentment. \u00a0This dish pretty much made my day.For my entree, I had the venison leg, also a special. \u00a0Originally, it was supposed to be served with a galette of red onion and rhubarb compote, but the chef put the compote in a baked apple for me instead (again with the gluten-free). \u00a0I loved that the server and chef were so kind and accommodating. \u00a0Sometimes at fine dining establishments, when you ask for substitutions, even if you NEED them and it's not just a matter of personal preference, they give you some serious attitude. \u00a0The venison was cooked perfectly rare and was exceedingly flavorful. \u00a0This dish was equally as exceptional as my appetizer. \u00a0I was over the moon that in one evening I got to eat offal and some delicious gamey venison. S had salmon rillettes for an appetizer and the roast chicken as her entree (why she orders roast chicken at restaurants I'll never understand, but whatever makes her happy). \u00a0She said both were absolutely delicious. \u00a0I didn't taste them because I was too busy swooning over my own meal. \u00a0We did not have dessert, although there were some gluten-free options. \u00a0I was in a state of buzzed bliss from my meal and my bourbon and I was ready to go to sleep and call it a day. \u00a0However, the server brought out a dab of honey (Miel does mean honey in French and Spanish, after all) on dessert spoons with the check. \u00a0Apparently the honey selection rotates. \u00a0The one we had was a local honey from Goodlettsville, TN and was served with a bit of bee pollen. \u00a0It was mild, floral, and ended the meal on a great note.Service:Our service was very kind, knowledgeable, and attentive. \u00a0Atmosphere:I liked how it was pretty casual and how the kitchen was open. \u00a0I always feel reassured by an open kitchen. \u00a0The tables are a bit close together, so I imagine that when it's packed, noise could be an issue. \u00a0They should install a light outside. \u00a0It was totally dark and difficult to navigate back to the car when we left the restaurant. \u00a0Maybe the bulb by the door just needed to be replaced, who knows. \u00a0It's such a small thing that I feel silly even mentioning it. \u00a0Price:The prices were in line with what I would expect given the quality and preparation of ingredients, as well as the level of service. \u00a0Before tax and tip, the total was exactly $100.I feel a need to address a complaint from other reviewers regarding the portion sizes. \u00a0We both left this meal completely sated and the portions were absolutely on par with what one would expect at a fine dining establishment. \u00a0If it was a true problem with the restaurant in the past, I think they have remedied it. \u00a0I will be mulling this meal over in my mind for a long time. \u00a0Miel made me really miss living in Nashville. \u00a0If we still lived there, I'd go back time and time again."], ["Alejandra Y.", "This place is expensive, but it's the real deal. \u00a0Great for special occasions! \u00a0Unique in Nashville. \u00a0High class culinary experience."], ["Alex P.", "This is a really classy place. \u00a0You definitely have to dress up and bring out the heels. \u00a0The service is very welcoming and polite. \u00a0Dressed in all black and attentive enough to check in on you every few minutes. \u00a0The place is dimly lit with candles and you can see the chefs cooking in the background. \u00a0Its a great place to go out with a date or celebrate a special occassion ... its not the kind of place to take young kids to though. The tables are crunched together and there isn't much leg room, but its very intimate and chic inside. \u00a0And the food is delicious. \u00a0Certainly different.

Its a small building hunched behind a muffler shop and a XXX film retailer. I was here for the brunch. My Nashville friends rave about it so, I decided to check it out. It.It was great. I had the crab cakes with a side of bacon and hash browns. A wise a tasty combination. Everything was done with great care and perfection. This was truly a rare treat for me especially on a NFL Sunday morning. I usually grab some coffee and a sausage biscuit on my way to the sports bar.i don't know anything about the wines or the dinners served here but the Sunday brunch is outstanding.

All our friends who had been before kept telling us that we had to try it. After reading reviews, and perusing the menu, it seemed like yes, this was a place right up our alley. Seasonal produce they're growing themselves, and aversion to aluminum pans, and locally- or state-sourced meats...I like.We had a six o'clock reservation for our party of four and were seated on the patio (which we didn't realize they had, but we requested it immediately as it was a warm lovely evening). No problem. Our waitress was friendly and told us the specials, and after about 15 minutes of deliberating and settling in we ordered.Fresh cross-cut rolls came out first, with an accompaniment of salted butter, then a petite green bean salad as an amuse-bouche. The beans were garlicky and it was a nice few bites.For firsts, we ordered the foie gras, the mussels, and two escargot. \u00a0The foie was awesome, served with a Banyuls-maple gastrique and apricots, though the whole thing was made better with the pairing of a glass of Sauternes. The mussels were solid with a garlicky broth. The escargot were surprisingly rich, served six on a plate that seemed custom-made for serving them, swimming in delicious parsley butter with house-cured ham shaved finely over the top. Yum. Mmmmmmolluscs!For our second courses, we ordered two bouillabaisse, one risotto, and one special: osso bucco with seasonal vegetables. The bouillabaisse was fantastic, featuring mussels, fish, a scallop and a large prawn served with the head-on. The risotto sounded good, though I didn't taste it, served with scallops and a poached egg. The osso bucco was good, too, according to my husband, with a nicely-sized hole in the shank and plenty of marrow, but it was by this time in the meal that the sun was fully set and the lack of lighting became a moderate hinderance. Three of us had \"spoonable\" entrees which we didn't need to be able to see very well to eat comfortably. My husband's osso bucco, on the other hand, was a little more advanced for dimly-lit eating. I'd suggest that Miel consider some additional supplemental lighting (small lanterns, strings of Christmas lights) to bring things up on the patio just a tad. It felt very intimate and romantic, but it was hard to see!Then came dessert and the chief reason why I give them five stars and not four. Our waitress was being assisted by the owner, Seema, who came to take our dessert order. I mentioned that I was interested in the toffee cake with bacon, citing bacon as \"my thing.\" She laughed and mentioned that they were offering something off-menu if I was interested, which featured pork belly with a hard apple cider caramel sauce. I repeat...PORK BELLY WITH HARD APPLE CIDER CARAMEL SAUCE.FOR DESSERT.Giddily and gratefully, I ordered that. We also got a toffee cake and a creme brulee.The toffee cake was excellent, with the sweet and salty element added by the caramel and the bacon together. The creme brulee I did not sample, but it looked lovely (served in a blown sugar bowl meant to mimic Chihuly sculptures) and was quickly gobbled up.But the pork belly...oh, the pork belly...my kryptonite! Six or seven bites, braised (I think) and seared on top, floating in a small pool of hard apple cider caramel with a bit of fresh fruit alongside. Every bite was a revelation. \u00a0Sweet, salty, tart, and absolutely decadent. God bless you, Seema. \u00a0You're awesome.Miel (French for \"honey\") is as sweet a meal as I've had lately. \u00a0Bravo."]], "Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar": [["Jim R.", "ok . first ..

Every night of the week they offer a promo from 5 until 7 pm that they refer to as \"5 for $6 'til 7\". If you sit at the bar, there are 5 wines, 5 cocktails, and 5 appetizers that will set you back just $6 apiece. You can also order the Fleming burger (with bacon & cheese) for $6 too. I ask you, where else in town can you get a better deal?!?I had always assumed Fleming's would be out of my league pricewise, but this promo caused me and a group of friends to visit and I'm so glad we did. The drinks were potent AND delicious (love the Clear Cosmo, and for those counting calories, they also have a 99 calorie martini called Tickled Pink), and the food was also divine. The calamari was both generous and some of the best we have ever had and the burger was really substantial and clearly made of quality beef. I admit that I overindulged, knocking back 3 cocktails, but when my bill only came to $18, I felt my decadent ways were a good investment! I also have to say that the two staff members who waited on us were really solicitous and clearly concerned with giving us the best possible experience, which helped add to our happy buzz.The atmosphere at Fleming's is quietly classy, with a \"good old boys club\" kind of vibe in terms of decor, but hey, this place is a steakhouse, so I guess that makes sense. It may not have that trendy urban feel that I generally gravitate towards, but it certainly doesn't feel staid or outdated either. The biggest downside is that parking is generally a nightmare/non-existant, but thankfully there is complimentary valet provided, which is probably your best bet. All in all, the happy hour here is an experience not to be missed.

The location for this restaurant is weird - you have to go up one level with an excalator.I ordered scallops, he ordered steak. These were not the best scallops I have ever eaten, but were pretty good. We also ordered French onion soup and their Fleming Salad. The salad was disappointing - not much on the plate, and just kind of blah - I expected more from their name salad. Both main dishes though were very good, and the spreads they brought with bread were excellent and flavourful.We also discovered a lovely wine there called Raymond, from Napa valley.

Charred on the outside and medium on the inside. \u00a0So juicy and tender that it is in the top 3 steaks that I've had in my life. \u00a0For the side, I ordered the French green beans, and they were delectable. \u00a0Cooked with almonds, mushrooms, and truffle oil, they were the perfect pair for the steak.Service was wonderful and as a gift to my mom, the server gave her some amazing truffles and a $25 gift card for a future experience. \u00a0Highly recommend Fleming's."], ["Frank B.", "Went for my birthday...great wine list and nice ambiance...service was top notch...steaks were great as well...they took $25 off of bill for reserving online...then gave me 2 gift cards of $50 to use on my next visit...overall I had a pretty good experience...I will definitely return...but I must say Stoney River is still our No #1 spot for steaks in the Ville...have yet to try the other high end steakhouses but they are on our list...think I will hit the happy hour @ Flemings I hear it's pretty nice!"]], "Le Sel": [["Molly R.", "love love love love! \u00a0Service was outstanding.

From the cocktail (The Mercedes, highly recommend) to the wine to the lamb tartare and steak frites everything far exceeded my expectations, which were already pretty sky high.

We came here on a Saturday night with a reservation and it had quite a few open tables. We had read on Yelp that the service was slow, so we expected that when we came in. Unfortunately, we should have eaten a snack first and we got hungry. The first drink came out over 15 min after we ordered, followed by the rest of the drinks about 5 min later (only 3 of us). It was a little ridiculous but the drinks were good!I loved the chicken confit dish that I ordered - the chicken was crispy and delicious, and the polenta was rich. It could do with a little less butter, but also, butter is magic. Can't complain there. We also ordered the three dips - these were good but I'd rather get the cheese plate next time I come!"], ["Chelsea P.", "I'll start off by saying that Holland House is one of my favorite spots in Nashville. However, tonight's experience was not the most enjoyable. We were first faced with over an hour wait to be seated after placing a reservation through open table. At first we didn't mind the wait but the host at the door didn't seem to care about our having to wait or resetting the clock with us as we waited outdoors and indoors. Once we were seated at the bar, in the corner which was great so we could still socialize amongst eachother, we were embraced with Milo. Milo was our saving grace and helped us all order our first drink and food. It was great! He was attentive and suggested wonderful drinks. After we received our food and had our first drinks we were ready for another. Milo was unfortunately the only person really helping customers at the bar even though there was another staff member behind the bar. I hadn't seen this bartender help anyone else other than what appeared to be his friends or fellow bartenders. Finally we got a hold of Milo and his customer service was impeccable once again. He added suggestions and he asked for preferences. We received our drinks and continued on....about 45 minutes later and we had been wanting to close our tickets out. Since Milo was the only one helping customers we didn't want to pull him away from anyone else...and that made this task basically impossible. Finally Milo had given us our tabs and we were able to head out. I will be back to Holland House but I was not impressed with the service tonight. There seems to be a communication opportunity and team player opportunity. Again, Milo was wonderful and one of the best bartenders in Nashville."], ["Cate H.", "Disappointing...While waiting for our reserved tableI ordered a very dry martini...got one with a ton of vermouth.. EwwFinally our table was ready, once seated we waited 15 minutes to finally meet our server and she was very sweet.The food...lackluster, under seasoned & unimaginative.The cocktails...better than averageThe bartenders.. very slammed and more than a little bit hostileOddly whether you are waiting for your cocktail or waiting for your food you always have a glass of water."], ["Taty G.", "Five thousand stars! Visiting Nashville on work and someone recommended HH B&R. First off, I wish I was getting married again so I could use their private room - it is breathtaking! Secondly, I don't drink (I know, I know) and was so envious of the amazing cocktails the bartender was throwing down. I asked if he could make me something fun and he created this cucumber, grapefruit, citrus, sparkling soda mocktail that I'll dream of forever.Next - the executive chef is Armenian! I'm half and finding another Armenian in Nashville is about as likely as finding a unicorn shooting rainbows in your backyard. He was so cool and walked us through his favorite dishes (the pastrami is made in house!) as well as sent us appetizers as a goodwill gesture. The croquettes are OUT of this world (along with unicorns, see, there's a theme!), the jamon iberico charcuterie is phenomenal as are the dips (the lavosh touch clearly being a nod to our Armenian culture, woot!). For the meal, I had my first pastrami in TEN years. Holy moly, it was amazing. I eat like such a fat kid when I'm in Nashville but YOLO, my friends.We tried one of every dessert and each person in my party had a different favorite. My boss loved the dark chocolate pudding with pollen and espresso crumbles. I LOVED the grilled cake with flora and citrus - it was so light and refreshing - very needed after meals in Nashvegas. My other colleague loved the pear dessert and pretty much licked all the cream off her plate - but she was also drunk so that might have been why.Our bartender was Tyler - he ruled - the chef was Hrant - he double ruled. Go go go!"], ["Dan G.", "First, the great part of Holland House. The bourbon with ginger ice cubes was one of the best drinks I have ever had. So balanced, so fantastic as the ice melted. The Montadito Trio was also so great. I am a huge fan of the presentation, and the hen of the woods mushroom piece was honestly one of the best things you can eat. It's a small portion, just three baguette slices, but perfect to share slowly.The bad: I would say that you should avoid the croquettes, super rich and decadent but seriously ham was grisly inside of it.Great place, can't wait to go back for dinner"], ["Kathy B.", "Great food and atmosphere. There had a lot of interesting and unique craft cocktails. This was a nice break from the Broadway craziness with its relaxes but hip vibe."], ["Chris A.", "I went in for a late dinner and met friends. The ambiance is really nice. It is as it says, a refuge. It is warm and inviting. They dimmed the lighting really low! Since it was after 10p I guess. I could barely see anything. I know I'm old, but come on. Anyway, I had the Pan fried half chicken. Delicious. I wish there was better lighting so that my pictures would have come out better. And who is going to use a flash in a dark room? That would be considered rude. I like Holland House. Its not an every day thing. The price point is a bit higher than normal. And you get what you pay for! Lovely meal."], ["Emily C.", "Great drinks! The bartender was attentive (though slightly pretentious) and each thing we ordered was very well made. Didn't get food, but it also looks very good."], ["Krystal T.", "I give Holland House a five-star rating for its bar. If you want high-quality drinks with a classic ambience reminiscent of an old-time speakeasy without crossing the river to navigate Patterson House, the Holland House is a GREAT alternative. I especially love the group seating nearby the bar. Those seats are comfortable, and you can actually hold a group conversation (up to 6-7 people).Tip: if you're waiting for a spot at the Pharmacy Burger, first check in at the Pharmacy to get on the waiting list, then go next door to Holland House for a pre-dinner drink. This is especially useful if you have a large number of people and have to wait extra for a spot to open up."], ["Carly B.", "Lived up to the hype! We celebrated our 2 year anniversary here. If you don't want to wait for hours, make a reservation. Started with the bread appetizer. The green dip was delicious, but there wasn't enough of it.Boyfriend ordered an amazing burger. To our shock, we rank it higher than Pharmacy's burgers. We upgraded the fries to truffle and we're not disappointed by their deliciousness. I went with the filet and potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly and potatoes were seasoned with pure awesomeness; however, without the bread appetizer and stealing the boyfriend's fries, I don't think this would have been enough food for me."], ["Hilary M.", "If I was rating this restaurant just based on the food, I would give it 5 stars!!! I got the pork tenderloin (special of the night) and it was soooo delicious! Extremely tender and flavorful! My husband, parents, and sister loved their selections of the strip steak and short rib, as well! I give it a 3 stars for a few reasons: 1) it was HOT...the restaurant, I mean. Yes, it was 91\u00b0 outside at the time, but I'm sure they've heard of AC! We were suffocating! (and I'm always cold, so that says a lot). 2) the service was poor. Not friendly. Not efficient. Slow. Never got our drinks refilled. One waitress was extremely rude to us, sharply telling us we were in her way as we were trying to get a couple quick photos, along with some other snide comments. That is an unacceptable way to treat guests. 3) my family had brought a surprise birthday cake for me, and after spending $150+ already, they charged us $3 a person to eat our dessert there because \"they offer dessert.\" Like I said...food was to die for! But the service left us disappointed. I probably won't return, as there are many other options in Nashville that offer great food AND great service."], ["Ashley T.", "This is a really cute little spot! The interior looked trally nice, but we had a drink on the patio. They have lights strung up and twinkle lights in the bushes. They serve mostly craft cocktails so if you're planning on having a beer, this probably isn't the place for you. (Head next door to the pharmacy for a decent selection of beer) Our drinks were good. I had some girls (a bourbon drink) and my husband had the Sicilian iced tea. While mine was nice and stiff, it was very lemony. Maybe a little too much lemon for my taste. We both preferred his drink. It wasn't overly sweet but it was just sweet enough and had a nice flavor to it. We only had 1 cocktail each, but we would like to go back to eat and try other drinks."], ["Anthony T.", "Pete, the bartender, knows how to make a true sazerac and also knows his bourbon. Visiting our daughter, who lives on the east side, my wife and I followed her here for cocktails and glad we did. In Atlanta, it is so difficult finding anyone that knows the correct way to make America's first cocktail, like they do in NOLA. I'm no prude, but that drink has to be perfect, chilled glass, with a lemon garnish not dropped in the drink, etc. Only difference with Pete was the use of La Muse Verte Absinthe Traditionelle in lieu of herbsaint or Pernod, which is usually substituted. Excellent! \u00a0And I was convinced to use Bulliet rye first then whistlepig second. And a historic event occurred having my first 12 yr Pappy Van Winkle! My wife enjoyed the golden ticket and my 25-yr old daughter enjoyed the Toronto. We will return. Ask for Pete."], ["Tori M.", "Not only the best drinks in town, but the best bartenders too! Hard to find a place where the menu is good but they're still happy to make things on a whim or change what's shown on the menu based on what you like.Would be remiss not to mention that the food is also fantastic - truffle fries are the best in town but the full menu (though it changes) has always been good any time I've delved past drinks! Been coming here consistently for almost a year and has been good every single time."], ["Emily T.", "Best drink in town. Hands down. They have a beautiful outdoor area that's perfect for summer sipping. Their appetizers are generous and worth your money. Service is a little slow but it's just part of the atmosphere.

Maybe it was the dark and stormy night, but the gothic, Great Expectations environs played up the tired dark wood and brass with creative use of space and clutch design elements. We arrived a bit before our table time, and were met with a haunting ambiance centered by a crowded bar in the round. Sat upon a platform surrounded by negative space and what I couldn't call anything other than a spotlight candelabra. You're on, D.A reputation for brilliant craft cocktails had me diving headlong in to the extensive list of house specialties, classic standards and devious variants. Eyes darted like made before settling on the Vieux Carre (Landy cognac, 1776 rye, punt e mas) on the server's recommendation. It was... sweet. Sickeningly so, leaving me to wonder if rye even made it in to the glass. Tom Waits For No Man (gin, absinthe, dry vermouth, lemon, gomme syrup, bitters) for my second take saw better results.Smoked brisket tacos with quick pickled onions tasted great when they weren't disintegrating under an obscene puddle of oil. Blackened fish fit the bill, and I dug the thick grits and corn salsa/maque choux. However, the chard or collards or whatever braised greens with rhubarb(?) based the plate were, for lack of a more appropriate description, inedible. Overcooked and ultra-bitter, a single bite almost caused a spit take.Didn't experience the service hiccups others have mentioned, and our server's attitude shone even on the most dour of nights outside. His personality and helpfulness, along with a stellar atmosphere, balance inconsistencies throughout dinner, a 50/50 cocktail hit ratio and that horrendous greens side for weak three stars."], ["Ray M.", "Gahhhhhhd, I love the Holland House bar. I really do. The fianc\u00e9 and I always grab a seat at the bar and it never disappoints. As someone who bartended for 10 years, these guys know what's up. And they're into it and like to talk about it, too. The bartender made this girl an egg white drink, and while she didn't like it (she was kinda basic), it's always cool to try new stuff and be encouraged to, too.Some suggestions: -I'd get there early. -Parking can be a little annoying -Feel free to dress up or down--the vibe is eclectic."], ["Jana T.", "Love Holland House! The bartenders are great and know their sh*t. \u00a0The cocktail menu is awesome but if you want to try something different, just let them know what you like and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. \u00a0As much as we go for the cocktails, we usually eat when we're there too and are never disappointed with the food. \u00a0The appetizers on their new menu are amazing and you can't go wrong with the burger and frites (haven't tried mains on the new menu yet). \u00a0My only complaint is that they took the brussels sprouts off the menu.

The ambiance \u00a0was nice and relaxing. I sat at the bar and ordered dinner. I thought the drinks would be cheaper than LA but I was wrong.

Wish the beer selection had more options."]], "Eastland Cafe": [["Cristina M.", "Great food for our company dinner. Fresh, pretty fast and consistent! Staff knew the food and drinks to pair. Must go even if you don't buy out the restaurant and have a set menu!"], ["Johnny T.", "4.5Eastland Cafe might not get the press/attention of some of its neighbors or comparable restaurants in the city but, trust, it's serving up some excellent food, satisfying cocktails and engaged service -- all in an environment you're going to want to experience. It had been on my to-try list for months and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to go there. Parking's a breeze (street or nearby lot) so don't let that be a deterrent (and, please, don't park across the street).Once you walk in, you realize that the space is a bit bigger than it appears from the street. This allows your group of six (or so) to be as comfortable as you might be on a date. It's homey and inviting but doesn't sacrifice ambiance for either. As is my custom, I began the evening with a cocktail before delving into wine/beer. As an homage to my many years in Chicago, I opted for the Violet Hour: gin, lemon, simple syrup, and lavender bitters. Unsurprisingly, it was a floral yet muted beginning to the evening. I'm not the world's biggest gin fan but I found myself intrigued by this cocktail. I'd, gladly, order it again. As I sipped my cocktail and took in the mood lighting, our waitress brought out a hot bread basket with chimichurri. Pace yourself on this or else it's game over. Because we weren't carb-loaded enough, we ordered the chitarra pasta -- which I liked saying because, Thundercats. It's an addictive melange of: red bell pepper emulsion, sun dried tomato, garlic, shallot, chile, and tapenade crouton. Incredible.For dinner, I thought I'd slow it down with a beer and some comfort food. I was looking for a barleywine but there wasn't any on the menu. I didn't hold it against them. Nashville is still getting its footing when it comes to beer. I 'settled' for a bourbon barrel ale to accompany shrimp & grits. Yes, I came to a restaurant like Eastland Cafe and ordered shrimp & grits. And, you know what? I'd do it again. These were ridiculous. Even though I am a native southerner, I am relatively new to the world of grits. I blame Cream of Wheat and early school days. Now that I know the warm hug of properly-prepared cheese grits, it's a new story. Not only did the plate have an ample amount of sweet & meaty shrimp, the grits were a star in their own right (and not just a side show). To the cheese grits add a healthy dose of mushrooms, green onion and lemon... and, man... don't even know. Again, coupled with my beer, it was the perfect pairing for a cold evening.But, if I was going all in, I couldn't just stop there, right? I had to have dessert. I had to have the granny smith apple donut. I mean, it's apple rings (healthy) fried in a cinnamon dough (donuts) and served with caramel ice cream/gelato/I don't know. My eyes had glazed. My ears weren't functioning. All I knew is that I had to eat every morsel of food on that plate. All else was inconsequential. After dinner, I barely made it home before popping my top button on my pants and passing out. Yeah, Eastland Cafe needs to be in your rotation."], ["Mia F.", "I've lived in Nashville for \u00a09 years, and never gone to Eastland Cafe. I heard great things for a long time about the restaurant so decided to try it. . . \u00a0Honestly, I would give a 3.5 Star review if I could. It wasn't bad at all. . . just wasn't what I expected from the hype and for the money. Husband and I popped in for a quick dinner on a Sunday. We got a table right away, and the service was really good. We both ordered cocktails, but my husband had to send his back - it didn't taste much like the description, and the bourbon was weak (weak enough that I could sip it \u00a0- and I hate bourbon) . . . our server even agreed. We sent it back and he just ordered Bourbon on the rocks. However, my drink was great (gin, lavender and rosemary I believe). We ordered the Margherita pizza and shrimp and grits. We didn't want too much, so we decided to split the shrimp and grits. $4 plate sharing fee. .. .ugh. Really? The shrimp and grits were good, different - \u00a0with a French flare, but good. The decor was nice, service from our waiter was really good, but the food. . . it was just good.

We got just that. The bartender (Will) was lovely to chat with and very accommodating while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.Once we all sat down it took the server about 15 minutes to get to us at all... and the restaurant wasn't even full. We ordered appetizers which were overall delicious: pork belly, charcuterie plate, fried green tomatoes (not so delicious) but then had to pull the waiter back to order our meal.While others complained their chicken was dry and without flavor, ours was really yummy.

They also seem to run out of things rather quickly (i'm assuming popularity has something to do it - then again popularity might be a sign of how they are doing things right).There seems to be an utter shortage of staff and I felt really bad for those that were there, just completely unable to keep up.Now the food is to die for and probably the best I will ever have in Nashville without losing my bank account. Everything from the bread to the salmon to the goat cheese spread is a heavenly experience. The portions may not be French, but they are on the smaller side of things for an American food standards. I will also say that the staff was super friendly to do what they could to take care of us when things died down and give us alternative menu options and comp us for the wait - which I really appreciate."], ["Jake S.", "One of my favorite happy hours ever.

As far as good goes, don't expect the goat cheese br\u00fbl\u00e9e flatbread to be a flatbread pizza. It is more of an appetizer style. The chargrilled broccoli lacks and char and is very undercooked. They have a quaint patio with two tables. On a good night, I would always recommend sitting outside."], ["Frances K.", "Fantastic service, food, location, and atmosphere. \u00a0There was nothing that I did not like about our dinner at Eastland Cafe.

Our server, Nick, was also really great. \u00a0He was helpful and kept an eye on our table without constantly checking. \u00a0When he found out that we had just arrived in town, he made a list of places he recommended that we see while in town and really made us feel welcome. \u00a0He also recommended a sinfully desert - if they are serving the apple/donut/ice cream thing you must get it - especially if you like things that melt in your mouth.

I found just that when I visited Eastland Cafe in Nashville's Eastwood neighborhood.This \"trendy\" spot features great \"New American\" cuisine and a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere, which was exactly what I was looking for in the \"Music City\". Their menu was simple and concise, which pleased both me and my partner in crime.We began our culinary journey at Eastland with \"Charred Octopus\" featuring Peruvian beans, minted yogurt and arbol chile. It was simply divine. Tender and full of flavor. One of the best octopus dishes I've ever had. We also ordered their take on \"Agnolotti\" stuffed with winter squash, sage butter sauce and toasted pecans. Another superb dish.For my main, I ordered \"Duck Two Ways\" one seared and the other confit. It was amazing! The dish was complemented with farro, collard greens, chestnuts, fig jam and a laurel enhanced jus. What can I say? It was delcious.My partner in crime ordered their \"Tennessee Hereford Short Rib\" featuring braised carrots, cipollini onions, fingerling potatoes, spaetzle and a superb demi glace.

For appetizers we had the asparagus salad (a special), the pork belly with grits and green tomato jam, the wedge salad, and the hummus. Although each dish was great, the pork belly was the table favorite-- the grits were light, rather than heavy and gloppy, and the pork belly was just darn tasty. For main courses we had the fish special, the root vegetable composition, and the shrimp and grits. The fish was superb-- expertly cooked with a very flavorful setup. The root vegetable composition was unique and surprisingly filling and delicious. \u00a0The shrimp and grits were great-- the best we encountered in Nashville.

On the day of I got a call saying our table had been double booked and was asked if we wouldn't mind moving our reservation. We moved our reservation to a later time (only by half an hour) which wasn't a huge deal, but still a little frustrating. When we arrived there was a huge crowd of people waiting to be seated (there is absolutely NO area for standing around and waiting so I felt bad for the people whose tables were near the door) but luckily our table was ready when we got there and we didn't have to wait! Since we were only two people, our table was \"floating\" in the middle of a walkway which was somewhat uncomfortable. Due to the nature of the building (which looks historic) whenever servers walked by the hardwoods would shake as would our entire table. However the worst part was how LOUD this place was. I could barely hear my mom across the table, it was incredibly frustrating and for the first few minutes we really contemplated leaving. It took about 15 minutes for our server to get to us, and we placed our orders. We got our drinks, free bread, appetizer and entrees in a pretty timely manner.The food was phenomenal; the beet appetizer was delicious, and I had the special of the night- fish with risotto) while my mother had the salmon. The menu had a lot of interesting options and the cocktails menu was fairly extensive. Our reservations were for 7:40pm and finally around 8:45 or so it started to die down and we could actually carry on a conversation. After dinner we ended up shifting over to the bar for an after-dinner drink while we waited for the line to go down at Jenni's. Overall, the culinary experience was awesome but the ambiance (while beautifully decorated) was really ruined by the volume. I would not recommend this place for anyone with hearing problems or vision problems (very low light). There were tables outside which I would definitely ask for if I go back (if it's warm!). I think the trick here is to eat early, or very late. But definitely not during the rush on a Friday or Saturday night."], ["Anna Y.", "Five stars!

The menu changes some and I've always liked their valentine's day menu particularly. I've been 3 times and it's always crowded but the restaurant has dark woods and a warm feel but the food is all but folksy. \u00a0The mussels are actually really good and have been for years... so that's a natural starter for me or just go with scallops, which in the celery root puree is rich and luscious. I've had their NY strip which is basically comfort food and the thyme gnocchi is actually very very good as well. \u00a0Oh and usually they have a special (or two) that usually trumps the dinner menu.

Great spot for locals and tourists, will definitely be back."], ["Chelsea S.", "Made reservations for the bottomless brunch for a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. I rode red the sweet potato hash skillet and it was incredibly delicious. My only complaint is the small portion sizes of the food, but it tasted great.

The poor host was scrambling and doing two people's jobs. Once we were seated we ordered - the server was nice and answered our questions. He also seemed stretched and had too many tables. Once the food came, it was just ok. I got the salmon with spinach. The salmon was unevenly seasoned - A LOT of salt in the middle (almost inedible) and not any on the extreme ends.

The tomatoes were fried in a thick batter and were just okay. I prefer a \u00a0lighter cornmeal batter. The chicken fried chicken came with mashed potatoes and gravy which had a good but rather bland flavor. My daughter liked the shrimp and grits which I thought tasted rather ordinary.

Oh, that's just the coziest bar in Nashville with some of the best cocktails you've ever tasted.I stumbled upon Embers for a Yelp Elite event and had a fantastic time. The vibe really is just cozy. It's like someone pulled this place down from snowy mountains and plopped it in the middle of Nashville. It would be a great place to wind down after work or stop in for a quick bite. The drinks are definitely what you'll write home about. I tried a Lavender Honey Collins and a Green Tea Collins (I'm a big fan of gin.) Both drinks were delicious in their own way and laboriously made with love. These drinks take a minute. No one here is sloppily pour whiskey with a spritz of coke. I saw people peeling fruits, using eye droppers in tiny bottles of oil, shaking, stirring, grinding, dusting - these drinks are not for a the faint of heart. They are art. My favorite of the two I tried was the Lavender Honey Collins. It was fragrant, soothing, and refreshing. It tasted fancy. I don't think it's for everyone one because, in simply terms, \"it tastes like a smell.\" Lavender just isn't something were used to eating/drinking but it's certainly worth a try.I didn't eat much while I was there but I did glance over the food menu.

They pride themselves with trying to have the biggest collection of whiskey in Nashville. This isn't your ordinary honky tonk bar. You will get hand crafted cocktails. My favorite cocktails: lavender bee's knees, margarita (yes it's amazing), and I like their chai-d car. My fianc\u00e9 loved their gingerbread old fashioned too!The service is great! All the bartenders will help you with any questions that you might have. It's a family owned restaurant so they really put care into everything they do.

It's a pretty laid back bar, but their prices don't really reflect that. That being said, it is Nashville and stuff is just expensive!They have a very unique menu of cocktails, and a special winter selection as well. I loved how they incorporated fun flavors into their drinks such as cinnamon and caramel. And their drinks are most certainly a sight to see. They remind me a bit of Merchant's drinks, a bit out there and extremely pretty. Their fries are great and they have a variety of dipping sauces you can choose from. More than anything this feels like a friendly neighborhood bar. The staff is super great and the owner is such a fun person! I will be coming back soon!"], ["Jonathan B.", "Atmosphere:It's decorated like a ski lodge... and it's in Nashville... of course its unique! Family-run and very laid back.

There is a drink for anyone on the menu and the staff was very friendly. \u00a0To be honest, the first time I came here I was disappointed that I could still see outside the window. The atmosphere is definitely like a ski lodge -- They have a \"fire place,\" logs, the walls are painted to look like a ski slope, and they play Winter Olympic clips which is great, but then you can look out the window and see there is no snow and you are still in the great city of Nashville. \u00a0I think I also ate them out of Salmon dip, but if they found some fish hiding somewhere, I suggest ordering it for sure."], ["Nashville T.", "I like embers. \u00a0They have seasonal cocktails and great bar menu. \u00a0We enjoyed the gingerbread old fashioned to celebrate the holidays. Alas, the music is too loud to enjoy the atmosphere."], ["Leighton B.", "I was excited about my visit to Ember's. It's one of 12 South's newest restaurants, and I was sold after reading their background story, food menu, and cocktail list posted on their website.My friend and I went for brunch and it about 1/3 full of customers. To me, that's a bad sign for a 12th South restaurant during Saturday brunch time. Anyways, the waitress (there was no host/hostess) told us we could sit anywhere. So, we sat by the window because natural lighting = better food pictures! After looking at the menu, I was pretty underwhelmed. There wasn't really anything that stood out to me that I thought, AHHH I must get THAT. We asked the waitress a couple of questions about some of the menu items and she had to go back to the kitchen to get the answers. Seriously? With not a very extensive brunch menu I expect the staff to be able to inform me on the spot about their menu. I decided on the Aspen omelet with fries, and I had asked if I could sub out the fries for another side and she asked, \"Like what?\" Aren't you supposed to tell me which sides you have?! I told her fries were just fine. Tried to make it easier for everyone.The omelet was fluffy and filling, and it was my favorite part of our brunch experience. But instead of fries, they served me greasy, soggy potato slices. I asked for ketchup to hopefully make them taste a little better, and she said it'd be an additional $1.25. WHO charges customers for KETCHUP! In hindsight I should have just brought my own damn ketchup packets.Lastly, the location of Ember's is in a prime location on 12th South, but I felt like it was really misplaced. The ski lodge theme just doesn't seem to work for the area. I can't see it sticking around 12th South for very long.Good try, Ember's."], ["Kelly Ann W.", "Quickly becoming one of my favorite Nashville spots, Embers is a ski lodge inspired bar and restaurant nestled in the quaint 12th south neighborhood. Slightly on the pricy side, but with interesting menus choices, finely crafted cocktails friendly and attentive staff and interesting atmosphere, I think it makes up for it.I am in love with their Brussel sprouts. I don't know WHAT they put on them but when they are gone, I want to pour a shot of vodka or saki in the bowl, swish it around and sip it. (I just invented a drink!) The wedge salad is very nice too. 4 smaller wedges with just the right amount of blue cheese and crumbled bacon and a delightful \u00a0dipping sauce. I've sampled the burger which had a real beefy taste. Can't say that for lots of restaurants. \u00a0And the house cut fries with a variety of dipping sauce choices are delish.They have an outstanding list of whiskey- it takes up an entires page of the menu. I opted for one of the choices of craft beers the first time and sidecars the second visit. And wow- they were amazing. Super nice bartender took down a bottled local whisky I was curious about to let me smell it. There was a group when we were there and everyone started yelling out \"shotskis!\". A handful of people standing in a row were brought a ski with shot glasses affixed and proceeded to all take a shot at one time as the ski was tilted to their mouths. So fun! \u00a0Try it yourself. I really really like the place. I'll be back for the Brussel sprouts alone!"], ["Rebecca M.", "This place was seriously disappointing. We had a group of 8 for dinner and drinks. I don't know if the air conditioning was out or if it was supposed to be that warm in there. Either way, it was unbearably hot. We were all sweating and using our menus to fan ourselves. Our waiter came around once to take orders, once to deliver food and once for checks. He never checked on us. The food took over an hour to be delivered to our table and it wasn't even a busy day. The drinks were overpriced and not great. The food was \"meh.\"Cool premise - Not executed very well."], ["Katie I.", "5 stars for drinks, service and overall ambience and vibe. Love the kitschy, casual ski lodge motif. However, with the AC not working, we were a bit hot and steamy on a muggy spring night. Service was great and our server was very knowledgable about the menu. I hate when you go places and the servers haven't tried everything. Kudos to the restaurant for good training. The drinks were awesome. They have a nice variety of specialty cocktails for $12. We started off with a Ski School and The Shim Sham. I LOVED the Ski School. Just the right balance of alcohol and sweetness. The Shim Sham was good, but not as strong as I would've wanted it. Also tried the Ajax which was very good, as well. They have a HUGE selection of whiskey and of course the Shotski which includes 4 shots for $24. For appetizers we tried the Alaskan Smoked Salmon Spread with baguette. I love smoked salmon, and while tasty, it was a little too mayonnaisey/cream cheesy for me. The baguette was deliciously warm and crusty, but not sure I'd order this again. We then moved onto the Nashville Hot Chicken. It consisted of 3 little korean buns with hot chicken a pickle and some tangy sauce. It was good, but there was hardly any chicken on it. The bun to meat ratio was off as you can tell by my picture. They definitely need to be more generous with the chicken.The belgian fries were delicious and I loved the sauces you can add. My favorite was the gravy and yum yum sauce. Also tried the club sandwich with side salad. I really liked the sandwich, solid club. The side salad, however, was boring. Just plain lettuce with maybe a cucumber or two and an almost too tangy vinegarette. I would get fries next time.We wanted to try dessert, but we were sweating half to death with the lack of air. My husband went to the restroom to splash some water on his face and there were no paper towels, just a hand dryer. In the women's restroom there was a double sink and one toilet. That doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of the use of space. The dryer in there was already out of order. I have to say in a restaurant setting I like paper towels. \u00a0If you are on a date or whatever, you may want to do a makeup check, blot the face, etc. Minor stuff, but things worth mentioning. All in all, I'm excited for Embers and will definitely return based on drinks and service. I would like to see how the menu evolves over time. It's a little all over the place right now, but I do believe they are receptive to feedback and plan on working the kinks out along the way. A very nice addition to 12 south indeed."], ["Scott T.", "I went to an event at Embers recently where we got to try a ton of different cocktails.

The staff is genuine, funny, and friendly with stellar customer service. The apps are super satisfying-- we ended up ordering another salmon dip cause we couldn't get enough of the first one (despite decent portions). The fondue has a kick and I like that. The yum yum fish tacos were another big hit at our table. I was very excited about the reindeer sausage. The meat is only a little gamy, so don't be scared to try it! It really is just sausage. The meat was great, but the meat to bun ratio favored the bun too much and took away from the presentation. Caribou is usually free-range and treated better than other future-sausaged animals so that explains the high price. I'm a heathen so I just picked it all apart and ate as I saw fit."], ["Rachael B.", "Love this place so much!!! My favorite place in Nashville! Moscow mule Monday's for $5 a pop with multiple flavors. Delicious and in copper mugs- the way it should be!

Definitely recommend this place and I would like to visit again. Only reason I'm doing 4 stars is simply the pricing compared to serving sizes. Now that's not a negative. The food was very craftily prepared. But if you come hungry be prepared to spend a little more. But overall an enjoyable experience."], ["Jessica C.", "I dined at 360 Bistro recently and had a really relaxing, nice dinner in a very nice atmosphere. \u00a0As they are known for their wine selection I would recommend coming thirsty, and as the space is small I would recommend making a reservation. \u00a0The ambiance is cozy and very classic, and the wait staff were lovely. \u00a0I was a little bit underwhelmed by the food, however. We started by splitting a few starters. \u00a0The simple kale salad was light and basic, but a good way to begin your meal. \u00a0The tuna tartare on sourdough toast was phenomenal, and was what I enjoyed most all evening. \u00a0And we ordered the squid ink linguini with smoked duck sausage and duck eggs. \u00a0What an interesting dish. \u00a0The flavor is hard to describe, though it really reminded me a little bit of a hot dog. \u00a0Ironically my husband, who hates hot dogs, fell absolutely head over heels for this dish. \u00a0I, on the other hand, a person who would gladly enjoy hot dogs for dinner, found this to be a little bit strange and not really for me. \u00a0You'll have to try it for yourself - if nothing else you can say you ate squid ink linguini with duck sausage, and how many people can say that?For our entr\u00e9e, my husband and I split two different things. \u00a0He ordered the steak, which was a nice cut of meat, but which I found to be lacking a little bit in flavor. \u00a0(He disagrees on that point.) \u00a0We also split the burger, which comes with rustic cheese, aioli and a buttermilk bun. \u00a0It's not what you would expect at a place that seems to be more in line with fine dining, but this burger was awesome. \u00a0We kept seeing it arrive at other tables and it looked like it shouldn't be missed, and we were right. \u00a0It was juicy and flavorful, and, in my opinion, better than the steak by a lot (which is something I would never ordinarily say.)One side note: the restaurant's website seems to be down right now, which I hope is an isolated problem. \u00a0You can make reservations on opentable, though."], ["Arthur M.", "We went here with a Groupon. We paid $66 for $120 worth of food. Not a bad deal. We got four appetizers. Cheese plate, olives. Scallops, & duck meatballs. The scallops were crevice not seared which was a surprise but still very good. The duck meatballs were very tasty. The cheese plate was incredibly overpriced and wasn't that good at all. Gave my wife and upset stomach. The olives were nothing special either. After seeing food being delivered to other patrons, I decided on this burger that other yelpers raved about. My wife got the homemade pasta. My burger was excellent and great sized along with very good roasted potatoes. The $20+ price tag was excessive though. My wife's portion of pasta was tasty but seriously not more than 3/4 cup for almost $30. We both got dessert. I got the fig and caramel cheesecake which was very good. My wife got a chocolate ice cream cookie dish. The cookies were very hard and not good at all. She said the ice cream was good though. The restaurant is small and very stocked from floor to ceiling with wine. The staff were very attentive and polite. The food came quickly and we were overall satisfied. The reason for the 3 stars is the size of the portions compared to the portion. The food is good, the staff are very nice and it's an overall nice place, just be prepared to pay $200 if you want to leave full.

The restaurant was EMPTY, and I figured that would only improve our experience in terms of service and food, but that assumption was WRONG.We had a glorious cheese plate and a nice glass of wine, which initially tempted me to throw them another star, but they didn't make that cheese or wine, so I don't really think it makes up for the shitshow that followed. After receiving some guidance from our waiter, I ordered a chicory salad with lardon vinaigrette and poached egg ($13), which I topped with shrimp ($8). That vinaigrette was perfect, but I did essentially pay $13 for them to throw it on a bowl of frisee with a handful of croutons and an egg. Whatevs. Unfortunately, my bacon vinaigrette experience was ruined a few bites in when I took a bite of my husband's lunch. He had ordered the tempura-battered shrimp tacos, but swapped the shrimp for fish, as suggested by the menu. Surprisingly, the fish was not tempura breaded. Even more surprisingly, it was PUTRID. I could barely return to my wonderful salad after a single bite of his fetid, lukewarm, fishy taco. We're not the sort of people that return dishes, but that taco was offensively bad, and I suggested he return it. He told me that he'd mention something to the waiter if asked.Unfortunately, the waiter didn't ask, even though my husband left two tacos on his plate and declined to have it boxed to go. Had he asked, we would have mentioned that we were more than displeased, perhaps even shocked by the level of our disgust at the tacos. I don't enjoy writing crappy reviews without giving someone the chance to remedy the situation in person, but honestly, that fish was unforgivably bad. Any chef should have known that and stopped it from going out."], ["Bryan L.", "About as solid as a 4 star as you can get. The highlight of this place? Best burger i've had in Nashville.

Last week I finally decided to make reservations to celebrate my wedding anniversary. \u00a0I'm not sure why I waited so long.The atmosphere is chic and a little trendy, but not pretentious. \u00a0I wasn't sure what to wear, so I went with the standard khakis and a button down. \u00a0There were others in shorts and t shirts, and they seemed to fit in just fine. For appetizers, there were four that we wanted to try. \u00a0We finally decided on the tuna tartar and the calamari. \u00a0The tuna was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. \u00a0If I were into taking pictures of food, this one was picture worthy. \u00a0The calamari was a standard fried calamari. \u00a0It was nicely cooked, not too chewy, and the remoulade was outstanding.As an entree, I had the tri tip, which was served with bone marrow, sauteed rapini, and a chimichurri. \u00a0The steak itself was perfectly medium rare and with the proper chew expected from the cut of meat. \u00a0The gelatinous part of the marrow didn't add much to the dish, but the rendered marrow fat had great flavor, and tied all of the other components together. \u00a0The rapini was slightly bitter, which went well with the other components of the dish.My wife had a grouper special. \u00a0I was a little surprised to hear another server present the fish as halibut to a table behind us. \u00a0When the dish was presented, there was no mistaking that it was grouper instead of halibut. The fish was well prepared, and went well with the reduction that accompanied the dish. \u00a0This was a fine dish, but probably not something we'd order again.The desserts may have been the best part of the meal. \u00a0I had a vanilla panna cotta with strawberry sauce. \u00a0My wife had the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel and \u00a0espresso ice cream. \u00a0If it wouldn't have cause a scene, I think it's safe to say that we would've licked our plates.The service was prompt and friendly. Our server was nice and conversational, but not too over bearing. She was also very comfortable making recommendations off the extensive wine list, which is presented on and Ipad app.Overall, we enjoyed our experience. \u00a0It was a nice change of pace from the other locations that we typically celebrate special occasions. \u00a0 When a friend asked my opinion after the meal, I told them that 360 would be a great place to drink wine, and nosh on a variety of the wonderful appetizers and desserts."], ["Stephen L.", "This place is classy.

Terrible experience.My bride and I booked the private room at 360 Bistro months in advance for our small wedding reception. We had been there previously to try it out, and their food and service were top notch (if exorbitantly expensive), so we thought it would be a sure thing.Let me start by saying, anyone who has ever been married or planned a wedding knows that there is so much that goes into it. So much planning, so much money, and when things don't go right it can be heartbreaking. Thus begins the tale of our experience at 360 Bistro.About a month out from the wedding, my bride calls 360 to just make sure everything is still good to go. They inform us that the person we had been dealing with no longer works there and they have no idea what we are talking about. So we showed the the correspondence between us and them and they agreed to honor the terms. It seemed like crisis was averted. Fast forward to the night of the wedding.We arrive post-ceremony to find that they had booted us out of the private room. No call, no email, no communication of any kind. They not only did not have us set up in the private room, they put us back in the corner in the server's prep area. They didn't even have enough tables or chairs set up. So here we are, us and our wedding guests wondering what in the heck is happening. Immediately we begin to ask what is going on. The manager never came to us to talk to us. She simply ignored that we were there. The wait staff tried desperately to cover, but they knew it was wrong. They stuffed us in to this tiny corner where I didn't even have enough room to pull the chair out for my bride to sit down.Appetizers were already supposed to be prepared (we specifically asked and had someone come early to make sure they were ordered), they weren't. So all of us had to wait for those. The food was delicious as we knew it would be and the servers, while it appeared that they had never been to a wedding or hosted any sort of party there ever, did an admirable job with the debacle. On top of all of the aforementioned gaffes, they informed us that they would be charging us $2.50 PER SLICE of our own wedding cake that we brought which was not previously disclosed to us. They then proceeded to take the cake without even asking us and cut it into GIANT pieces. This was a cake made to serve 40-50 people. They cut it into 20 slices. Hundreds of dollars down the drain as no one could finish their cake. To top it off, they did not leave any for my bride and I to have! Imagine having to console your new wife who is in tears over all this, and not a manager in sight to even apologize for confusion.To end the night we asked for some satisfaction. We were told succinctly that we would not be receiving any sort of discount and were required to pay the full price. After the huge amount of money we spent, one would think we would get at least an apology from the manager. We did not.As you might imagine, I will not be patronizing their establishment again and will actively encourage others to dine elsewhere."], ["Tracy H.", "I got the special champagne chicken was very good and we roped it off with the chocolate cherry cheesecake yummy!!

We had a meat/cheese tray and it was fun to try the diffrent combinations, and we finished with the lobster flat bread. We also did a burger from the entree and we did a shared plate. What we didnt realize was a shared plate on the burger meant they just split the meat and gave us both a full plate presentation and a smaller burger instead!!!!

It's such a nice and cozy place that allows the interaction between the phenomenal service to be intimate and pleasurable, without being too much conversation. The wine list and wine by the glass list on the Ipad are spectacular with wines from throughout the world. I do believe they have one of the most comprehensive wine lists in the southeast if not the country. We asked the servers and they had a great working knowledge of the extensive wine list and suggest an excellent wine to pair with our meals.

We were very excited to hear that. :) We each had steak with vegetables. The food was mouthwatering! The drinks were delicious as well. The best part of it all was their amazing creme brulee!

I went early to avoid crowds, and was surprised to see people coming in at such an early hour. My server was Justin who presented the menu, wines and specials comprehensively without missing a beat. When I told him I like a certain type of wine and asked for a recommendation he presented a delicious selection. The soup was quite delicate and I chose a scallop special that was unusual, but very nicely done with just the right balance of spice. Portions are generous, so I brought desert home. I had a good experience, but I was surprised that the server assisting a couple close to me could not explain what a tureen is....one of the specials served as such....."], ["Juliana L.", "The service was pretty good.The 11oz. veal chop was ok, overpriced in my opinion.

This was a Sunday night. Sooo many people were there. \u00a0Amazing service. The servers and hostesses all worked together to clear off tables and greet/seat people. \u00a0The restaurant is small so they aren't having to cover too large of distances. They really had a group feel to their work ethic. \u00a0Sit in the heated patio area when it's chilly. that was wonderful.Our server was hilarious, knowledgable, and provided the perfect recommendations. \u00a0He knew all his wine pairings and hit the flavors I liked spot on. \u00a0The wines were amazing, but very expensive. \u00a0At least for me on my poor, college student budget. regardless, I paid my $200.00 with a smile because this whole experience was phenomenal. Anyways, the servers were great. I drank the Oregon pinot noir called Cumming Road and that was delish. had the best dusty/smoky feel at the end. really enjoyed that with my pork chop... which came with pancetta, green beans, apple butter, and goat cheese cornbread. mmmmm. so juicy. the glaze on the porkchop was perfecto. mmmmphf.the appetizer we had was the fried calamari which was okay, nothing to RAVE about. I was starving, as was my friend. We snarfed the whole thing down, but the marinara was nothing special, neither was the fish. very plainly done Italian style. But - I liked it regardless. My friend ordered the short rib with broccolini and parmesean polenta. that was delicioso as well. mmmmm. so tender. sauce was perfect. broccolini cooked just right.and then, we bought a bottle of Kiona to go. mmmm. drank that back at the place we were staying... delish cabernet. I liked the pinot noir, but I prefer much dryer wines. For dinner though, the pinot was fine.dessert was the trio gelato scoops. we had berry, coffee, and mint. \u00a0biscotti came with.

I started off with a tuna carpaccio style appetizer that was passable at best. My \"filet mignon\" was brought to me well done when I asked for rare and was DEFINITELY not a filet. I'm not sure what cut of meat it was, but it was grainy and impossible to cut with the steak knife I was never given. On top of that the rest of the accoutrement was inedibly under spiced. Finally, the kitchen ran out of the dessert item we ordered at the beginning of the meal and we were never told until the end of the meal when they brought out the other options and just dropped them on the table. Don't get me started on how they failed with my girlfriends meal. In addition the cocktails we both ordered were poorly mixed. Over all I was incredibly disappointed.

We were seated in the patio area (heated and cozy!) and given an IPad to peruse the extensive wine list -which is totally what a place like this would need in order for patrons to not feel overwhelmed by selection (or to be burdened by a dense wine list). We ordered our drinks and then I ordered the flounder special, while FH ordered the broccoli soup and Bistro burger. As our waitress began to walk away she remembered that there was a cheese plate on the dessert menu that people often ordered as an appetizer. We took the bait and I'm so, so glad that we did. In all honesty, we would go back for simply a nice glass of wine and the cheese plate. Our plate had five cheeses with the standouts for me being the beer cheese where one could see the beer marbling the cheese and the blue cheese/cheddar combo. It was a great way to start the meal. The soup came out and was a bit bland...it probably was the low point for the meal. Some pepper helped brightened it up, but it was still a letdown in comparison to the rest of the meal. My flounder was cooked perfectly and tasted yummy, though I think our waitress got some of the elements mixed up with the other special when she was describing it, as it didn't have everything on the plate that I was expecting. FH's burger was pretty tasty, though he removed the bacon halfway through, claiming that the fatty portions of the bacon hadn't caramelized leaving him to chew a bit more than he liked. We finished off the meal with a trio of sorbet - strawberry, white peach, and chocolate. All were well-received and a nice note to end the meal on.

I like modern and comfortable atmosphere and the service has always been great."], ["John W.", "Here's why the restaurant only gets 3 stars. First, I don't mind paying a little more for good food; my wife and I like do that every so often, to splurge a little on ourselves. We're not rich and can't do it much, so we seek out places that have strong reviews. That's why we went to 360 Bistro: the reviews are good. The thing is, the restaurant didn't live up to the reviews. Here's why. First, when I pay a hundred bucks for a meal, I have certain expectations. One is that the food will taste good. Bistro 360 lived up to that expectation; the food quality was good. Not excellent, not even very good. But it was good. The problem with the food was the quantity. I don't expect huge portions in expensive restaurants; it's a given that you sacrifice quantity for quality (while paying more, though some restaurants, i.e. Sunset Grill, accomplish both). I ordered the steak of the day. It was a flat iron steak, which I don't think is a 5-star restaurant cut of beef. Honestly, it's what I'd expect at at good Mexican restaurant. The beef had a nice tendon right down the middle and was not as tender as I expect in an entree at that price. But it wasn't the cut of beef that was disappointing. It was the sides. It came with potatoes, squash, and zucchini. I had two one-inch slices of potato, and maybe four or five each of the squash and zucchini. And the side wasn't all that good. My wife ordered the fish of the day, marlin \"caught off the coast of Ecuador\" (an extraneous explanation that I honestly thought was a bit pretentious). It was good, very tender, and she had a larger portion than I did; her eggplant side, however, was mushy and over cooked. But all of that is only worth a one-star deduction. The other star comes from the wine. I like good wine. My wife loves to taste good wine. Unfortunately their Merlot we ordered was old and stale, and at $12 a glass that simply shouldn't be the case. It tasted like something from a $12 bottle of wine and was a big disappointment, particularly in a restaurant with such an extensive wine list and strong reputation in that area. But I've seen this in other restaurants with big wine lists: the wines don't get drunk as quickly, and it's very easy to have a bottle go stale, which was the case with our wines. Overall the experience was okay. We had no reservation (we went because the power was out at our house and we went on a whim) and the staff accommodated that (granted, it was a Thursday night, but they still made room for us). The waiter was very professional and service was excellent. Unlike a lot of places, Bistro 360 is made for conversation; it is an easy place to sit and talk, and I never felt as though I was being rushed through my meal. It wasn't noisy despite the crowd, and the decor was very nice. Bottom line: it was a good place to eat, but simply not worth the money. I've heard that it's a good place to go at happy hour, and they have a good reputation for wine tastings. But we will not be returning there to eat."], ["Clint K.", "Located in the Belle Meade area, you can find it where the old McClures used to be. \u00a0It was a wine bar/lounge but now serves food as well. \u00a0It still sponsors wine tasting events from time to time. \u00a0It has a small bar adjacent to the dining area. \u00a0Soft art everywhere. \u00a0It looks very modern and cozy. \u00a0Dinner was very good as was the service. \u00a0Price was not bad compared to the quality. \u00a0I have always like this part of town so I may be not be as objective as I should be, however, I think you would like it anyway. \u00a0You don't have to like wine to enjoy it as a good dinner locale for a date. \u00a0The only complaint is that the menu is a little short for me, but then again so is Tin Angel's and I love it anyway."], ["Kira S.", "Though my H and I had been to 360 for drinks before, this was our first time having a full meal there, in part courtesy of Groupon. I made reservations at 7 pm on a Friday, but when we arrived, our table was not available, and we were told it would be about 10 minutes. After a quick trip to Harris Teeter next door, our table was ready, and our waiter greeted us with a couple of complimentary glasses of champagne to make up for the wait, which was certainly a nice touch.Because they rotate their wine list regularly, the off-going wines are reduced in price, so we ordered a 2003 Summit Lake Vineyards Howell Mtn Zinfandel off of that list, which was fabulous.The soups of the day were both chilled: a potato-leek and golden beet soup. Neither my H nor I are big soup people, but they sounded delicious, so I ordered the golden beet, and he got the potato-leek. The golden beet soup was very mild and the presentation was beautiful. Little swirled bits of red beet gathered in the center adding some color and bite. My H loved his potato-leek soup as well.For our entrees, I ordered the fish of the day: yellowfin tuna with spring ramps and fiddlehead ferns. The tuna was cooked perfectly. It was probably about 1 1/2 inches thick with a light sear on the outside and almost cool on the inside. I could cut through it like butter, and it was rich and fatty on my tongue. It came with the most complex, delicious sauce which appeared to be made of honey, wasabi or horseradish, and cilantro. The ramps and fiddlehead ferns were a nice accompaniment, and the presentation was beautiful. With every bite, I just wanted to close my eyes and let all the flavors wash over me.H ordered the rabbit, with the meat falling off the bone. It was the most tender rabbit I had ever had. The pieces of rabbit were arranged with some mushrooms, baby carrots, and small onions.We couldn't stop there so we ordered dessert. I ordered the trio of sorbets: mango, blood orange, and blackberry-yuzu. It also came with mini-madeleines, which were tough and chewy; the only downside of our meal. The blood orange sorbet was my favorite, very tart with a hint of sweetness.H picked the Granny Smith Apple and Bacon Fritters. They came out smelling like funnel cake, and the bacon added just a hint of smokiness and maple flavor.The service was perfect. We were in no rush and let our server know that we wanted to take our time and enjoy our wine. The pacing was ideal. The atmosphere is modern but comfortable, and the clientele is mostly Belle Meade couples. We looked to be the youngest ones there. It was not cheap, but it was certainly a fine dining and service experience."]], "1808 Grille": [["Jay S.", "Rachel and I went to 1808 for dinner Sunday night and were beyond impressed with the food, service and atmosphere.As far as recommendations - yes. Just yes. It is all great!We will be back for sure!"], ["Lauren G.", "1808 felt like an overpriced hotel restaurant from the second I walked into the door. I ordered the cauliflower soup, which was really creamy and thick and not that flavorful. I also ordered the asparagus salad, which was ok, but it had a really goopy sauce at the bottom and the shaved asparagus was really bitter. We also ordered the burrata and beets appetizer, which was good, but the cheese also just wasn't great. I expected more from a highly rated and expensive restaurant. The drinks were great, so I recommend coming here for those."], ["Jennifer K.", "My fiance and I live in Nashville and this has sort of become our go to place for celebrations. We tried 1808 based on a listing of the best restaurants in Nashville and have returned a number of times (the most recent being last night). We just love 1808 Grille, for a couple reasons. The first would be the food. They completely change the menu on a seasonal basis, which is cool, but you can pretty much count on everything being unique and consistently amazing. I will say that we've only been to 1808 for dinner, so I don't know how their other meals are, but dinner is fabulous! The second reason would be the attentiveness shown by the staff. Everyone there is wonderful, and I do mean everyone, from Chef Jake Strang to the wait staff. The people at 1808 Grille really care that their guests have a wonderful experience in their restaurant; this level of customer service is something that is often lacking at other places. Every time we've been there the experience has felt so special, and it's been because the staff has made sure we feel personally cared for. I can't say enough wonderful things about 1808 Grille; I highly recommend it!"], ["Torrie A.", "This place is amazing and run tighter than a Viking crew. Service: impeccable. Selection: divine.

good hour discussing where we were going to go for our final night vacation dinner and through Foursquare and Yelp, we found the 1808 Grille. \u00a0Through pages and pages of recommendations and suggestions, we finally found our restaurant... and it was only a $6 cab ride (or 5 minutes) from our hotel in the Midtown neighborhood.This place was DE-LICIOUS. \u00a0Like incredibly good. \u00a0Like the food was so good that we were talking about how good it was during our meal. \u00a0I am incredibly impressed with the quality of the food and the service that we experienced at 1808... especially the food. \u00a0We started our meal with the cauliflower Caesar salad and it was delish. \u00a0The cauliflower was perfectly cooked so it was al dente but not too crispy or raw tasting and that was mixed in with romaine shreds and a homemade Caesar dressing that was outrageously good. \u00a0Served with a parmesan crisp, as if it weren't good enough. \u00a0 We were very happy with the choice.I ordered the chicken \"pot pie\" and my husband ordered the braised short rib. \u00a0I was so, so happy with the choice that I made. \u00a0Even from the first bite, the gravy and vegetables and chicken were perfectly seasoned. \u00a0The \"pot pie\" was a roll of puff pastry placed on top of the dish, which looked good and tasted delicious. \u00a0I broke it up and mixed it in the chicken and gravy and was very, very happy. \u00a0My husband's short rib was literally melt-in-your-mouth good and he ate almost the whole thing, which is rare since he has a small appetite. \u00a0Eating the whole meal is a testament to how good the food really was. \u00a0We had a side of horseradish mashed potatoes which were served in a tiny saucepan, which was cute. \u00a0They were nicely mashed (not pureed) and the horseradish was a nice touch. \u00a0We were stuffed but ordered dessert anyway because the dinner was so absolutely good and we were not disappointed. \u00a0I got the banana pudding and it was well worth it. \u00a0Chilled with a lot of bananas and homemade vanilla cookies, it was a great way to top off the meal. \u00a0Other reviewers said to order the donuts and my husband LOVED them. \u00a0There was a selection of three that included chocolate, fruit, and butter and they were delicious. \u00a0Again, my husband almost never finishes anything and he gobbled the donuts up. \u00a0Super tasty. \u00a0Go here. \u00a0The service was good, the restaurant wasn't packed (even on a Saturday at 8ish) and the food was AMAZING. \u00a0The menu changes four times a year, so if I lived in Nashville I'd go that often just to see what the chef is offering with seasonal ingredients and flavors. \u00a0The prices were reasonable and everything was really great. \u00a0Looks like there's street parking and valet available, but cab it so you don't have to hassle. \u00a0Also, check out the lobby of the Hutton hotel. \u00a0It smells AMAZING with some kind of air freshener that is piped through the vents (literally true, I asked). \u00a0Again, go here. \u00a0Well worth coming to this seemingly out-of-the-way venue (in terms of downtown) and well worth eating here more than once

I stay in hotels pretty often and come hell or high water, I do whatever it takes to not eat in their affiliated restaurants. I'm also one of those rare souls that actually doesn't like room service. 1808 changes all that, though, and I would even go so far as to say I'd enthusiastically eat (and drink-- lovely bar area!) here even if I wasn't staying at my beloved Hutton Hotel. Similar to the superb customer service at the Hutton, 1808 goes above and beyond what you'd expect to accommodate their customers with a tempting menu that they are able to adjust for various diets. There are always vegetarian options. There are always vegan options. They change seasonally along with rest of the menu (ever notice how some restaurants have the perpetual butternut squash ravioli, even when that stuff isn't in season? Are you bored with butternut squash ravioli as much as I am?)Come breakfast time, I'm happily accommodated with a non dairy milk option for my latte. Come lunch time, there's vegetable entrees-aplenty. I love their quinoa dish of the season, but I recently opted for one of the main dishes that came along with three glorious sides. As this dish changes seasonally, all I will tell you is to trust them. They do magical things with vegetables, my friends.Finally, did you know they have their own signature batch of bourbon? Oh it's true and yes, I sampled it, despite not being a brown liquor kinda girl. It's smooth & smoky and best sipped neat.Before ending this review, I must tip my hat to the servers.

My friend ordered shrimp and grits and I ordered soup variety. What we got was essentially the classiest and most flavor balanced (as in not overly butter tasting) shrimp and grits that was elegantly displayed. Whereas too often soups are too salty, or over flavored, it was perfect (and normally pork and seafood don't go well together).Yes the portions were small, but they came with with add on of sauteed vegetables, olives, and etc. Oh and the breadsticks (not traditional breadsticks) were to die for.So yes... this is a perfect place for a date OR go with your parents (it was an older crowd that was there) for some quality dining that isn't as pricey (but still decently pricy - as in going towards the 3 Dollar category vs just 2) or ridiculous as fine dining and still a cultural experience. Definitely not the cookie cutter hotel dining experience I thought it would be"], ["Laura H.", "With an upscale twist on Southern classics, 1808 Grille did not disappoint. We had a very friendly server, and the rest of the staff was very attentive, not letting our water glasses get less than half full at any point during our meal. We started with seared tuna, which sat atop an avocado-cranberry mixture. It sounds strange, but the cranberry gave the tuna a new flavor that really worked, and the tuna could not have been any fresher as it was flown in from Hawaii today. For my entree, I had Hot Chicken, and it was the most juicy and tender chicken I have ever had. The spice level was mild (I would have preferred it kicked up a notch or three), and it was served over bacon with crispy kale strips on top. My Mom had the special, which was the most delectable lightly fried trout topped with a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce. I admit to entree envy, although my chicken was great. The sides came served for the table and were a farrow salad, mango and kiwi chutney and spicy cremini mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms and chutney while my Mom's favorite was the farrow. \u00a0Too full to try desserts, the pink lemonade sorbet was tempting, so maybe I'll leave some room in my stomach for it the next time."], ["BethAnn S.", "Even though 1808 sits just a few blocks away from the Vandy campus, I never think of it as a lunch option which is just cray-cray because I love the hotel. I finally cleaned of my glasses and saw the Hutton just sitting there while my friend and I were pondering where to have lunch around campus without the campus chaos. What a great choice.I was worried that we would need resevations, but at 1 on a Tuesday, the was lots of space. And what a space it is. For the solo diners/TV watchers the bar offers tables and straight up bar service whereas the restaurant has nice plushy couches and tables. I had a moment of panic that the (grumpy!) hostess was going to put me in a table right by another one when were plenty of open spaces but scored a table for 6 (!!) with a couch.The service was happier than the hostess and was totally fine with me waiting with wine for my friend who was running late. \u00a0(Note to my Yelp buddies: it wasn't busy! I'm not a table hog!) The lunch menu wasn't what you would call 'vast'. There were burgers, snappy sandwiches and some 'big' eats of steaks you could have if that's your thing. Both my friend and I got a roasted califlower cesar salad with steak which was good, but not great. The salad was overdressed drowning out the vegetables and the steak was too dry but it was not bad, just not awesome. On the food, I would give it a 3 stars, but I would go up to 4 stars because the wine by the glass was awesome, they had free valet for diners, free WiFi which was super handy while I waited, and a nice staff. The space itself is spectacular. Two glasses of wine, two lunch salads and a flat bread was $60 which was good, but hitting in that same price point with Etch's fresh flavors a few weeks ago makes the food here disappoint. Bottom Line: A great option away from campus to set up and work while having a burger and enjoy friendly service. I'd steer away from their adventure food."], ["Marina W.", "I honestly cannot imagine how this restaurant has so many three, four, and even five star reviews!(?)

They were like those tiny little punk fries you get from steak-n-shake, only smaller. They burger was SO GOOD. The over all feel of the place was \"expensive\" and it was a little too quiet in there.

The first time I visited, my meal was served with a heavenly side of field peas, cabbage, and potatoes. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned and cooked... It was so yummy, I decided to order the exact same meal the next time around. On this particular day the sides were roasted potatoes, red cabbage, and some kind of Asian noodle dish. The potatoes and the cabbage were OK, but very bland. The noodles were crunchy and did not seem to fit with the meal. I love the atmosphere and I already have lunch reservations to eat there again in two days... I'm eating with a group, so they made us place our orders in advance...

They have some fun cocktails on their menu."], ["Jennifer P.", "1808 Grille sets itself apart from a diner by offering delicious coffee. This is where the service stops. My friend and I were visiting Nashville for plain tourism. One thing I need to remember is that when I travel I need to recognize that all kinds of people are writing reviews on Yelp. 1808 Grille wasn't terrible food. It was average food served in a formal atmosphere. Perhaps it's more about the ambiance than the creativity with which the food is prepared, when it comes to the kinds of people who tour Nashville.Unless you're counting Kansas, Nashville was my first experience with the south. \u00a0What do you think the first thing was that I looked for? You guessed it, Southern Hospitality. \u00a0If you are a Nashville waiter serving food in a restaurant where most of your customers are hotel clients; then why wouldn't management factor this into their service ethic? I am not saying I know anything about the food-service industry; but all I am saying is that I was looking for it. Our waiter was polite, but he came across as burnt out and had no desire to make small talk. He asked me if I wanted the newspaper, and he comes back with the Wall Street Journal. I am a former reporter. I want to see the local newspaper. I am not interested in a publication out of New York while I am vacationing in Nashville. Seriously? It only made me mad when I tried to tease him about it and he immediately brushed it off with a sense of, \"Lady, I have other things to do, and no time to entertain your playful banter.\" Oh really? The restaurant was not even busy! I'm telling you, this guy was not hospitable at all. If doctors have to work on a bedside manner; then it should stand to reason that waiters should adhere to a certain demeanor as well. I got the breakfast burrito, and my friend got poached eggs on corn bread. \u00a0I liked how my burrito was encased in a tortilla that was somehow fused together so that it didn't unravel while you ate it. What I didn't like was how bland it was. I understand that restaurants try to please everyone's sensitive preferences; but I definitely did not like how the pico de gallo, hot sauce, and sour cream were all served on the side in stainless steel measuring cups. \u00a0My friend's breakfast was clearly the better choice. The poached eggs were not only on top of corn bread, but there were layers of ham and spinach, which added nutrition and a lovely color to the dish. \u00a0On the side he got skillet-style potatoes. \u00a0I did not taste his meal; but he seemed to like it. However, I did not get a \"wow\" out of him either. If I visit Nashville again, I will not eat here. The staff was either way too positive to the point where you could tell it was shallow; or they were too mechanically polite with no ability for small talk. Coupled with the merely decent breakfast; I just feel like there are better places to explore. \u00a0To the Hutton Hotel, you might want to reconsider who is managing your restaurant. Perhaps have the chef redesign the breakfast menu. The menu also read a little snooty when I noticed the asterisk at the bottom, pointing out that substitutions were not an option. At least remove the breakfast burrito."], ["Roger C.", "My gf and I were searching for a nice restaurant to have our date night and after searching on yelp we settled on 1808 grille. The valet is free if you're eating at the restaurant so you should definitely take advantage of it.The restaurant is part of the Hutton hotel and is decorated very nicely. The restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday night and yet of all the empty tables in the restaurant we were sat right next to another couple who could not stop talking to the waiter about what they were going to do once they got back to their hotel room....Nevertheless the service was amazing.

The Earl Grey adds a delightful aroma to the cocktail.

It doesn't make too much sense to wax poetic about specific dishes since they change seasonally, but I can tell you that 1808 Grille goes beyond the chicken/steak/pork/veg littany that we see on so many menus of restaurants in this price range. I can also say that I have had parsnip soup there several times that was fantastic. Also, (at least 6 months ago when I last went) their policy is to serve daily special vegetables with the large plates. There were three different ones, each served in a mid-sized iron bowl. Those along with the entre\u00e9s created an incredible amount of food to consume, and I am a girl who has been known to pack it away!1808 Grille is a perfect compliment to the beautiful Hutton Hotel, but it has always been a great option for a weekend meal or drinks (when you don't want to wait at the Patterson House) \u00a0for this local."], ["Chase C.", "Took my sister and brother in law.

The second warning should have been the lack of diners on a Friday evening at 7:00pm. The hostess and food runners were great. While our waitress was LOST! We were rushed to order a drink, only to have her disappear for 10 minutes before they arrived. After a few minute lapse she returned to take our food order. My wife asked about the seafood special and mid sentence she paused to read her wrinkled up cheat sheet. My wife chose the scallops, while I picked the short rib. There was never any mention of our side options, as they are chefs choice. The least our waitress could done was present them while ordering. Had she done so, I would have walked out the door. Our food arrived rather quickly and looked wonderful, until the sides hit the table. I have this hate hate relationship with rosemary, not the girl from Shallow Hal, but the horrific tasting herb. Two of the 3 sides contained this monstrosity of flavor. While our entrees were ok, they were not great. The horseradish cream was overwhelming the flavor of the beef. The pea pur\u00e9e base for the scallops had the flavor of sea water. As I finished my beef, I decided to try the sprout salad and was once again disappointed. The last of the utter disappointment arrived with the check. I had just wasted $80 on a meal that left me hungry and searching on yelp for why. Why does this place show 4 stars? Why did I not trust my empty gut feeling when I arrived? Why were there only 2 more patrons dining in the hour since we arrived?So if you skipped to the end of this review to get the cliff notes.

Our sever was very helpful and not obtrusive. Overall a great evening. I recommend anyone in Nashville \u00a0to visit the 1808. My dessert consisted of a key lime martini...yum!

Very practical kids menu: chicken fingers, pizza, grilled cheese. Great beer selection. Service was amazing as well. I had scallops which were huge and perfect with pineapple/red pepper topping.

I started out with the Royal Pimm's Cup which was deliciously flavorful without being too sweet. To name all the dishes we enjoyed would take all day.

There are a lot of food options, so no one should have a problem finding a dish they like. We ordered the scallops as an appetizer - delicious, they melt in your mouth. And then we had the steak and salmon for dinner, both tasted excellent and were cooked perfectly. The side items they brought out were great too (except the cheesy grits, but we don't like grits at all.) Even better than our meal though - dessert! After being told how popular the banana beignets were we knew we had to try them. They were amazing! No wonder every table around us had ordered them as well. If you're not a banana fan these might change your mind.I loved the atmosphere, the decor, the food, everything about this place and we will definitely be back!

My two vegan companions ordered that and I got the scallops. (I'm not going to spend much time talking about the main dishes, beyond just to say they were all incredible.) They had really tasty breadsticks on the table for abating your early hunger and came out with a gorgeous array of olives as well. nom.As soon as the waiter saw I had even a glint in my eye about getting a glass of wine, he offered me a sample *wink* and said that he'd be happy to keep getting me samples until I knew. So I decided to take him up on his offer and ended up trying 4 different white wines (a glass worth collectively which he was fine with) and then got a glass of the 3rd I'd tried (the Sokol Blosser Evolution). The sommelier was wandering around and chatting with the guests as well, so if I'd had some serious questions about wine I could have asked him. One of the main things we were curious about here were the veggie sides. I got the spinach, chard, and escarole saute (vegan) along with the sweet potato rutabaga mash (not vegan). My brother got the 500 degree roasted oyster mushrooms (vegan). The red cabbage and apples were also vegan, but I can't remember about the rice pilaf.Believe me when I say these were some of the best veggies I have ever had in my life. The sauteed greens were beyond amazing, one of those dishes that you eat really slowly and spread out so you can enjoy it for as long as possible. And the mash was incredible. BUT the icing on the cake, the side dish to rival all side dishes, was hands down the oyster mushrooms. Cremini, George. I could eat this every day for the rest of my pescatarian life. Somehow the intense heat they cook them in just brings out every damned flavor the mushrooms ever thought to impart. And it is glorious. In my future I see many returns to 1808, likely with meals assembled entirely from side dishes. As someone who eats mostly vegetarian, I am not above this, and have found that some of my best meals have been had at steak houses where the asparagus and spinach are cooked perfectly. 1808 was no different. The size of the sides were generous and served in little metal pots which kept them warm. Because I chose a mid-plate for my main dish, I had just enough room for the sides. We didn't try the desserts, mostly because the only vegan offering was sorbet (isn't that always the way?), and I didn't want to torture my companions with my tasty treat. For a non-vegan restaurant, they are undoubtedly on the right path and definitely worth trying. I'd say that if they could add one more vegan dish and a vegan dessert, then they'd have my vote for best in Nashville."]], "Blvd Nashville": [["Thom G.", "I haven't been on Yelp in a long time and just recently logged back into my account and realized I never posted this.

I'm not sure. Just a thought. I ordered the burger. I'd had it last time & I really enjoyed the flavor of the meat. This time around the burger wasn't very hot when I got it & was more greasy wet than flavorful juicy. Someone in my party asked for ranch & they didn't have it.I really wish they'd just serve water with a glass of ice.

For $8, you get to choose two (that's right, two!) items off their happy hour menu. Being an individual who likes to be well-rounded, I opted for champagne, grilled cheese, and everything that I could pick off the plates off my nearby friends. This proved to be a solid strategy.Let's start with the wine. To begin with, it had bubbles, always a point in favor of any champagne. Moving forward from these basic essentials, it was slightly sweet, caressing the insides of my throat as it quickly pushed me towards my very low drink limit. I like my champagne slightly sweet, but not saccharine, like my men, and this lived up to my expectations.On to the fontina grilled cheese. Fontina is the best of all cheeses to use for grilling, it would seem, as evidenced by the creamy deliciousness of this meal. I could feel my arteries crying out in moaning, ecstatic agony as I stuffed the entire thing into my gullet. The toast was crispy, the cheese well-melted--no complaints here.Finally, on to my third choice: Everyone else's food (one of the many benefits of hosting a happy hour club). The truffle fries were slightly under-salted (though, being a resourceful witch, I remedied this by using the salt shaker), and the mac and cheese did not impress me--it appeared to be noodles with melted cheese. No pizzazz, no flair, no interest in showing off its potential as one of the most perfect comfort foods ever invented. It seemed to be the only underachiever in a class of Ivy League-headed students.

When we arrived, the room was not yet ready, and when we entered nothing was set up, so plate/dinner ware etc. This wouldn't have been a problem if our server was able to handle a large group and get everything out, but he was not. Seemed like a very inexperienced and short tempered server. He struggled to get us coffee and the basics. He was short with us, and even sorta nasty which was really weird. At one point as we were waiting an hour and half for brunch he asked \"are you getting mad because you all are hungry\". LOL what server in their right mind would treat a table like that??? Apparently Patrick from BLVD would! (pretty sure that was his name). It was so bad that the manager took over the table for the remainder of the time - she was pleasant, much more than I can say about our server.

Well, maybe it's not the restaurant itself per se (although my experience was, overall, positive) but it's the neighborhood. It's the street. It's seeing yet another example of Nashville reinventing itself, making itself accessible to transplants and natives alike and thriving. It's exciting. And, yes, I picked all this up while roaming Belmont/Hillsboro on a warm summer Tuesday.I was in the general area and needed lunch. I used my Yelp app to find me something good. A couple of clicks later, I found myself in the thick of the Belmont/Hillsboro monster (I never know where this huge area ends and begins; it seems to be everywhere), looking at what appeared to be a refurbished home. It gave me good vibes from the start so we went in. While initially approached by a genial young man and seated in the front dining room with a lovely view of the street (seriously; no snark), we were served by a young lady who was distant at best. She barely smiled, seemed distracted and was not at all present. I hoped she was ok but the service experience detracted from my lunch.Staying on my hot chicken kick, I ordered the hot chicken sandwich and a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was pretty messy and difficult to eat but the combo of ranch, habanero, onion, lettuce, mustard, sriracha, and those little cornichon pickles was extremely tasty. I eventually gave up on eating it as a sandwich and opted to use my knife and fork. The mac & cheese was made with gruyere and was a nice side. I would have preferred some heat and/or crunch to the dish but, again, as a side it was perfectly acceptable. I couldn't go with my lunch go-to beverage of an Arnold Palmer... because they were out of lemonade. Um, what? Where are we? Oh, Nashville. Right. And... no lemonade? In the summer? Okay, then.

We would have paid a premium for the inconvenience. Nope. Absolutely zero modifications due to how \"busy\" the chefs were at 2:00.

Served the warm water everyone is talking about and it felt dirty. We weren't drinking because Sunday with kids. Kids didn't like the marmalade under the donut holes, so we had to cut that part off. Biscuits and butter were more savory, less southern style. Meh. Burgers were pretty good, albeit a bit \"over thought\". Fries were crispy and tasty. Kale with chick pea side was awful. Tough, no flavor and hardly any chick peas.

You are such a danger to the comfort level of my pants, but damnit I never can say no to it...Stopped in for dinner and despite having a completely packed parking lot, the tables were not full so we were able to sit in the dining room. Sweet. We ordered some wine and my BF had the \"Sideways\" Wine Flyte with a selection of pinots. Delicious. I had a lovely glass of Cabernet Franc. I swear we get the same waiter every time, Todd, and he's exceptional. He knows the menu and checks up on you. Perfect.For the restaurant week menu, we mixed it up and each ordered something different. Starters were sunchokes and a soup, then we ordered the cauliflower and roasted chicken for entrees. For anyone who doesn't know, a sunchoke is more like a root less like an artichoke. I was confused by that but am happy to report that I adored my sunchoke appetizer. Hey, you are delicious! The butternut squash soup was pretty good, but mine was much better. The cauliflower dish was out of this world with brussel sprouts, shaved cheese, and breadcrumbs. I'm really digging Nashville chef's love affair with cauliflower. Who knew it could taste that good? My chicken was tasty, but I definitely tried to steal more bites of the cauliflower. Dessert was a chocolate panna cotta with some graham cracker type crumbles and an ice creamish substance on top... holy moley... it was amazing. Our meal wasn't exactly cheap due to the wine add ons, but we still got all that food and drinks for about $55/per person with tip. You know, not too bad. Flyte didn't let me down.

My husband basically refused to go here. After seeing chopped on Food Network, he really dint like Chef Matt Lackey. He presents himself as someone who was over confident, rude and demining. Honestly, I wasn't too fond of him myself, but after amazing reviews, awards and recognition - I felt we owed it to try it out. And boy, was I surprised. We came in today, really only intending to do the restaurant week menu. We sat at the bar, greeted kindly by our bartender and proceeded to order the happy hour specials of a cosmo and craft beer. We didn't intend to order appetizers, but felt that evaluating the quality of food from the kitchen that we \"owed\" it to ourselves to try things that were homemade. I really love cheese places, but really anyone can put one together. Instead, we opted for the chaturicre plate. It included (Homemade!) bologna, lardo, summer sausage and andollie. We also ordered the corn dogs. The meat plate was amazing- we almost didn't order because we aren't fans of lardo or bologna, but both were honestly incredible. The homemade pickles, whole grain mustard and bread - all perfect! The corn dogs were rounds circles-Reserved with a whole grain mustard aioli- perfect! Round perfect bites of homemade fried batter with a sausage in the middle- and when topped with a basically whipped whole grain mustard- divine. The house made chips, while not hot or freshly fried, were warm, mild crisp but yet perfectly salted.For main dishes, offered on restaurant week, we ordered the Beer Creek Beef sirloin with charred (well, so the depreciation) onion soup and faro. We both ordered rare and were (pleasantly) surprised they were both perfectly served rare and properly seasoned. This steak was worth more than the $52 dry aged 16 oz bone in ribeye at Moto we had last week. \u00a0Honestly! Better seasoning, cooking and overall flavor. Who to think we paid more for one steak we didn't enjoy than an entire 3 course meal for less money?! The faro was a wonderful grain to hold up against the onion broth. I really enjoyed it. Last, but not least, the delicious (which I normally, honestly hate, but my husband loves) \u00a0cheesecake. The peaches were perfect! Served with ( I think) hazelnut, a sweet peach reduction. Absolutely wonderful! We went during happy hour so were able to get $6 reds that paired with the main steak dish. For appertizer drinks, I ordered the cosmo ($5 on happy hour) and my husband ordered the Rumpo Red Beer (-$1 on happy hour). Overall, we were really incredibly surprised by not only the exceuction of each dish, but the thought. We will be returning. Despite the chef maybe being a little mean on tv, he composes amazing dishes and I cant, just cant, get over great food and wine. Thanks Chef Matt."], ["Kaitlyn M.", "Hate to say I was disappointed by this place. For one, the service was lackluster for the price you pay for the meal. More importantly, all of the food was significantly oversalted - and I'm someone who usually adds salt to all my food. It was disappointing because the meal was *this close* to being absolutely delicious, and we just couldn't get past the saltiness. For all the fine dining choices in Nashville, I definitely wouldn't return here. On the plus side, the menu was really inventive and had a lot of options for people with dietary restrictions. Only one of the entrees could not be made gluten free, and I had a very cool \"risotto\" made out of shelled and cooked sunflower seeds instead of rice.

I'll start off by saying that I will plan to give Flyte another try and re-review at that time. In the meantime I would like to start with positives!The servers were incredibly sweet and we had no issues with them per se. They tried their best I am certain...however the overall experience was not what we were expecting. Myself and 11 other girlfriends decided to treat ourselves to some wine and unwind time and restaurant week could not have been a better time. .. right? Well we made reservations and were quite surprised to have gotten them so easily. They had our table ready and we were seated immediately. Which was fantastic. Now here comes the trouble. When you start spending in the $50+ range per person for a meal.. you really start to expect a certain experience. We all ordered wine and cocktails and appetizers. Like I said.. we came to wine, dine, unwind. There was no wine in any of our hands by the 20 mins mark from sitting down. At one point, someone stopped by and put the bottle of wine we ordered on the table....uncorked... and walked away. That was an incredibly awkward moment for all of us. \u00a0I think my friend said it best when she described our night as just plain \"bizarre.\" I understand it is restaurant week and that they can be busy.. but I was disheartened that they did not even acknowledge the delays. (And honestly, the restaurant had a number of open tables). Now strike 2. Most of us ordered from the prix fixe menu. We sat down right before 8pm, had wine right before 830. Dinner came close to 10. Unfortunately everyone's meal came but mine. That was truly my own fault as they had to adjust my meal for allergies..but I thought they would wait to bring it out all together...as I sat as everyone else ate (never make your Hangry girlfriends wait). \u00a0That time though they immediately acknowledged what happened which I truly appreciated. In regards to the food, we all thought it was good. The carrot soup was far better then the roasted beets. 10/12 people had the steak and they said it was okay. I had the trout and was quite pleased. However, I can't believe I'm saying this.. but the best part of the whole meal was the bread. AND i was not the only person that said that. We all collectively agreed that the sour dough at Flyte was the best thing they served all night. It was truly fantastic. Presentation was spot on and the butter was apparently to die for. Overall, I would say that I expected a finer experience then what I got. Our table easily spent $700 and we did not feel that the price was equivocal to the experience. However, I am certainly open to giving it another try in the future... just not during restaurant week. And I would like to reinforce that the staff was very courteous and kind.

The menu is vague so vague and short it's hard to make any type of informed decision that is apparently by design due to the fact that the waitress took the menu line item by line item... Which would explain its brevity. \u00a0After you manage to make a decision based on the short menu, be prepared to wait. Long over an hour, for a party of 5 to revive the food after ordering. \u00a0It would be important to acknowledge at this point that the food was excellent in regards to the main entree. I had the fillet of trout. \u00a0If you are in to wine their wine menu is vast, far super-cedes their food menu in girth as well as in simplicity. \u00a0The dessert for this nashville girl was also hard to endure simply because of the unsweetened chocolate.Good food not a great experience."], ["Jessi S.", "Not my favorite restaurant in Nashville.

I can't imagine that that could be disputed: perfectly cooked duck, creamy sage risotto and inventive salads -- There's apparently more than one way to make a salad, and this plate involved a warm egg and maple.The chanterelle soup is perfect for an autumn/winter palette, and the chestnut pudding at the soup's center seems obvious in a way I never could have concocted.What's odd, though, is how perfectly the chestnuts were cooked for the pudding and how inconsistent they were in my duck breast with sweet potatoes: Some chestnuts were hard and crumbly, and others had that great bite that you want in a chestnut. But nothing could have ruined the duck dish for me.The service in the dining room is so great that I reached out to the co-owner, a friend, afterward to let him know. We were treated very well.But, we had to be treated well, because we spent a small fortune: For two appetizers, two entrees and one non-water, the bill was more than $100. Thank goodness for the gift card.There's a disconnect between the dining room's service and what you get in the lounge. Granted, it was happy hour on a Friday, but there seemed to only be one server in the lounge, and he was nowhere to be found. We waited about 15 minutes before our order was taken -- two drinks and BBQ pork sliders -- and then had to stand up to catch his eye for the check. I've been to the lounge for maybe five happy hours, and the service here is always the same: slow.It was a pleasant evening, but I would have been on edge had we been paying out of pocket.

The hostess asked if we had a reservation, which was funny since there was only one other group in the entire dining room. Luckily we scored a table! Firstly, I will say the wine was great; absolutely no problems with drinks. and the starter sourdough bread was PHENOMENAL, PEOPLE! Probably top 5 bread experiences of my life.That's where the positivity ends unfortunately. Our food experience didn't even come close to the award-winning reputation we had heard of. I wouldn't call it \"world dining\" when all the ingredients are from local farms. and I normally I wouldn't complain about locally-sourced food, but everything I ordered looked like scraps. I tried the allium soup, because I like a cold soup. This was inedible. Lawn clippings in a bowl. After a minute or so I would try to take another bite, but each spoonful was pushing me closer to a mental breakdown. I almost went into hysterics it was so bad. I know no one asked me, but I think it should be taken off the menu. (My friend had the arugula & raddish salad and said it was great, but over-priced.) Then for my entree I had the spring vegetables. What could possibly go wrong? Well, it was a risotto with a bizarre consistency and REJECT VEGETABLES. It was full of the STEM PARTS of.. what was that even? Artichoke? Mushroom? Something with a stumpy stem. AND I PAID $30 FOR THIS!?

I don't mean this to sound as harsh as it does. Everything was fine. Nothing was bad but nothing was very memorable, either. There was no punch and at this price point, there needs to be some 'oomph' to the offerings.Not finding anything on the entree menu that inspired my appetite or my wallet, instead I opted for a salad and the pork belly. My Chevre Croquette with arugula, candied hazelnut and walnut vinaigrette was fine. I kept waiting for the dish to come together either visually or taste-wise but it stayed in neutral. My pork belly was, likewise, uninspiring. I found the accompanying elements (turnip noodles, Benton's bacon kombu broth, rapini, and oyster mushrooms) to be busy additions rather than satisfying compliments.For me, something just didn't click at Flyte, despite looking like it should have been the entire package. The saving grace of the menu was the beer offerings. The beer menu is small but well-curated. I enjoyed a couple of brews from the selection.

The chilli, the ricotta cheese with the lime juice, \u00a0the different flavors just work so well. I had the pasta tonite, This was the bomb!!!! Move over Rolf and City House. This pasta dish put my last meal to shame. The pasta was perfectly cooked, the tomato fresh, butter beans and the sweet onions.

I was craving brunch on a Sunday morning and went to March\u00e9 (Pending review). People were lined out the door (as expected). So I then walked to Margot and they said the wait wasn't too bad - again this being Sunday morning at roughly 1130. I was very please with the added personal greeting by the owner/manager and I was seated in no time. The ambiance: awesome. decor was nice. And they were playing old school hip hop circa 1988-1990. The music level was low and pleasing. This is what dining is all about. The waitstaff was knowledgable and friendly. The food: was in one word, amazing. I can't recumbent any one thing because the menu always changes. Just do yourself a favor and get thyself to this establishment."], ["Bachs M.", "Lovely, lovely, lovely! I only gave it four stars instead of five because it is so incredibly difficult to be seated comfortably. It is pretty crammed.

I just genuinely love this place and I wish I could afford to go every week, seriously. Interestingly enough, I feel like they aren't as busy as they used to be not because 'it's gotten bad', but because there are so many trendy places in East Nashville opening up. Maybe that's why one time when we wandered in on a Friday night and we were seated at a table right away. But honestly, it's still better than anywhere else I've eaten thus far in it's price range.

Be patient. The stomach rumbles will cease once your first course arrives.Cocktails: Best Corpse Reviver I've sampled in Nashville. It even won praise and orders from diners at my table who don't enjoy gin (absinthe makes the art grow fonder!)Menu: The menu changes daily and sometimes even after printing. No need to echo other reviews to confirm local and fresh, but it does affect availability. Adjustments may be required. There are bound to be some recurring standards, but there's no way to truly critique a dish that may not be on the menu again. Clever! Lamb is reportedly a regular dish in one form or another.If you arrive famished, don't expect a bread plate to tide you over until the first course arrives. The day's artisan breads are served as part of each course. You're all big boys and girls and will survive.A quick round from last night: house chips and cheese plate for the first course. Delicious. Second course: vidalia onion soup (the table's winning choice,) salmon tar tare (good if you like that sort of thing,) charcuterie with pickled beets; all excellent. Third course: the table ran the gamut of lamb (fresh, fresh, fresh!,) every fish species the kitchen offered, and vegetarian. No rumbling tummies to be found.Dessert: The chocolate salted-caramel cake was devoured before the table could share in a sample (it must've been good.) Apricot sorbet had to be subbed by watermelon sorbet (darn it) but more than one of us suffered happily through it. The cookie plate was a hands-down winner.

I half expected them to turn us away since it was 15 to 10, but they happily sat us and did not rush us through our meal at all. I tried the quail, the skirt steak, and the goat cheese/mushroom/corn pasta. The quail was served over a bed of arugula with roasted peaches. So yummy. The steak was very tender as well, even though we ordered it medium. I would have to say the pasta was the weakest dish (kind of dry/needs more sauce?), but maybe I just need protein in my diet.We ended the meal with a slice of chocolate layer cake. While the cake looked super ordinary (I didn't even bother taking a foodie pic of it), it tasted SO AMAZING.

How could I not? This joint is about as solid and consistent as it is humanly possible!On this go round, I joined a reservation of 6 for Dining Out For Life last night. My friend Cindy was the host for the night and noshing for a cause was a fabulous excuse to indulge. 50% of our bill would benefit Nashville CARES. I always appreciate business models that contribute back to their community and this generous participation level impressed me!On to the food...Why oh why do I lose all sensibility when it comes to portion control each and every damn time I order the house-made potato chips from here? I become a ravenous Wildebeast over this large bowl of perfectly crisp and flavorful chips. Due to my vegan diet, I don't dip it into the accompanying aioli sauce but from the looks of what was left of it... my friend Rachel certainly approved. Next, I communicated to the server that I was totally open to whatever the chef and kitchen would like to concoct for my vegan dish and was not disappointed when he suggested a vegetable penne pasta dish! He was informed enough to know that the other noodles that they had in stock contained egg so the penne was the right choice for me. Well done, mister. Well done!The pasta and veggies were perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor. And, how could I mention a feast at Margot without mentioning the wine list? I have literally never had bottle or glass here that I didn't absolutely adore. The 2 glasses of \u00a0Malbec ($9.50 a glass) that I enjoyed offered up a robust yet smooth experience.

Finished my meal off with the Buche de Noel which was sublime, I placed my credit card on the table to speed the process along, as I signed the check my server asked what book I was reading, took a little more of an interest in her guest.

The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but not horrible either. Our table had a pimento cheese sandwich, pancakes, and I had a black bean breakfast dish. The food was fine, but my big complaint is the drink I had.They had an excellent brunch cocktail menu, and I typically go for the champagne drinks (hello mimosa and bellini!) but this time I went for a bloody mary and I wish I hadn't. I'm not sure if the mix was just off or if they didn't combine it properly, but I didn't finish it and everyone else at the table tasted it and it was off to them as well. It takes a lot for me to not drink a bloody mary, so let that stand alone. There were other people drinking them around me, so maybe it was just a fluke that mine was bad.That being said, I loved the atmopshere and I would definitely try it again for dinner to see how that compared to brunch.

I don't recall ever doing a review on this restaurant so I shall now. I've eaten there several times - some strong suits: 1. The ambiance is great! Former gas station, bring guests here and they will love the feel of both the neighborhood and the restaurant. 2. Margot McCormick has an intuitive feel for both provincial and Italian cooking, she is also very welcoming when you meet her. 3. I always love the fried green tomatoes when available. 4. They are good at their house cocktails, I especially liked the cucumber-infused martini and the French Malbec wine (Malbecs didn't do too well over in France - one normally associates that grape variety with Argentinian wines.)One negative - I ordered a tri-tip steak beef entree once. It was cooked to perfection but was more chewy than the gum I got with Topps baseball cards. Later in 2012 I ordered a tri-tip from City House and it was cooked just as well and just as rubbery. Moral of the story - avoid tri-tip, not Margot's and City House! That having been said, both places should stop putting that cut on their menu, it's better suited for the rescue mission or international aid. Great for food cost but bad for customer satisfaction.Another thing that perplexes me - one review was pretty favorable but gave three stars.

For the rest of us, the food is cooked to perfection every time. Perfect taste, perfect texture, perfect temperature, perfect freshness, perfect portions. Margot knows cooking in a restaurant is both an art and a science, and she's studied hard. I've never even a bad part of a meal here.Service is timely, helpful, and not overly intrusive. Drinks never go empty, yet those annoying, pointless half inch water refills never interrupt your meal. Dishes come out in the right order even if you have a large, high maintenance group.

The trout wasn't as flavorful and flaky ask I would've liked, but it was still good. A note about reservations: They are absolutely necessary to get a table here, but don't count on the reservation being honored on time. We arrived early for our reservation, and ended up waiting almost an hour to be seated. There were plenty others that waited quite a while for their reservation, as well.

Although we had a reservation we still ended up waiting another 15 minutes before our table was ready. I highly recommend that you make a reservation as this dining area is creative, but small. DRINKSOur group started at the bar and tried the Side Car and Pear Martini. I am a Side Car fanatic, but many restaurants have trouble executing this drink. However, both cocktails we received were smooth and flavorful. For dinner you can never go wrong sharing a Spanish Red, although Margot's offered an extensive list of Red, White, Blush, and Champagne.APPETIZERWe were very interested in the rotating menu that Margot's offered. The appetizers were not as elaborate as I expected and the cheese plate ended up being pretty simple and unoriginal, but the Dried Tomato jam was very delicious.ENTREEFor Dinner we shared the Gnocchi, the Venison, and the Flank Steak. The Gnocci was covered in an amazing tomato sauce, there could have been more sauteed vegetables, but the Gnocchi was perfectly light. The Flank Steak was flavorful and was served with great earthy mushrooms. Steak and Potato dishes are more like safety dishes for diners so it is hard to discuss anything more about the dish. Finally the Venison was AMAZING!! Not only did we even debate if this dish was truly deer,since there was not a single morsel of gamey taste, but it was served perfectly. My best friend and I immediately regretted getting the Flank Steak, but luckily her husband allowed a trade in entree dishes so her and I could devour the rest. If you ever see the Venison on the menu you must order it.DESSERTWe shared a chocolate cake dish that was very sweet and rich. It was plenty for the four of us to share after such a decadent meal.REASON THERE IS NO FIFTH STARYou know that adage that \"You can do a few things great but only many things well\"? Well.....Margot's does fit this bill. Although some of the dishes we had were standouts, most were not very memorable to other fine dining restaurants I have been too. Since the space is a gutted garage or home there is little insulation and it can be a little cold in the winter and it is loud all the time. I did love this dining experience and thought everything was very good, but only one dish stood out to me. I know Margot's is known for their daily rotating menu, but I would advise having a seasonal menu instead. With so many rotating dishes you can choose the standouts and consistently deliver a great meal experience."], ["Stephen G.", "Weekend in Nashville and too many choices of great new places to eat. \u00a0This restaurant had the reviews and strong comments from most every one we talked to, so it became our Saturday night out.The menu was simple and elegant, and what a treat to see Margot there in here restaurant overseeing it all. \u00a0Started with a goat cheese and toast points, then moved on to saffron mussels, and finished our appetizers with a great beet salad. \u00a0For entrees we had the house made linguini with squid, and the best meal of the evening, a grilled salmon.All of the food was wonderfully prepared and presented. \u00a0 Our waitress was also extremely well versed in the food she was serving which was impressive...... But somewhere along the ride I got the feeling our server just wanted to show her knowledge of food in general was much greater than anyone she could serve it to. \u00a0It was subtle, but turned what was a damn great dining experience into just a really good meal.I keep thinking what I may have done to bring this on (not wear shoes, order PBR in a can, or blow my nose in the linen napkin) but I just can figure it out.I would recommend this restaurant, and find the food quality very high. \u00a0It just proves again that the wait staff have a very significant influence on dining experience."], ["Cory C.", "What a great little place! I should start by saying our waitress was very knowledgeable of the drinks and menu she was able to answer every question we had and made great suggestions. I could tell she was a pro!

And as much as I dislike being the out-of-towner who doesn't quite appreciate the food ethic of the locale, the food was really a mere three-star experience on my palate. Margot does get the one star bump for a cozy ambiance and service which speaks volumes of homeyness, but the food did balance precariously towards the uninspired.But to begin with the highlights, the dining room is cozy. It feels like entering the kitchen which is open to the dining viewer with all of its hustle and bustle. The hosts are gracious and in particular, our server was very helpful and attentive in explaining to us the offerings of the eve. The potato chip appetizer came with a delightfully light garlicky aioli which was a fine opener. The soup of the day was a sweet potato bisque which was quite delightfully spiced with herbally infused oil, which added the slightest amount of bite to brighten the palate.The entrees were fomulaic and uninterested in execution. A protein, well cooked and seasoned, over a vegetable. The steak went with potatoes. The muscovy duck breast with brussels sprouts. The fish was accompanied by roasted squash. Yes, simplicity is sometimes king, and everything tasted pretty good. But in totality, it was boring. It was something that could have been home cooking. And I love home cooking, but color me uninterested for the evening.It was enjoyable, yes. There is a certain lovable quality about this place. For those looking to be satiated, a positive choice.

We had the fried green tomatoes with blue cheese topping, a lamb topped flatbread, ribeye, the soft shell crab with a sweet corn mixture and the blackberry lemon tart like dessert.My boyfriend's ribeye was cooked perfectly; it was tender and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were good, but not great. The flatbread was surprisingly flavorful, and the soft shell crab was almost wonderful. It was very warm and flavorful, but there were several small pieces of shell I periodically tasted. Obviously, it's impossible to get every little piece out, but it was a nuisance. However, the corn made up for it, and the portions were large. Our dessert was fabulous, and the couple we ate with's peach bread pudding was even better.Our server was attentive, but had a chip on his shoulder. I am a Sonoma wine girl, and I know little about Italian or French wines. When I asked for something similar to a Sonoma Pinot noir, he snootily told me they don't serve anything like a Sonoma wines. He then proceeded to try to get me to order a Shiraz blend- Thanks but no. Our meal continued in this manner. Someone at our table would mention how good the rabbit looked, and he would chime in and tell us all about it. He made his opinions a little too clear, to the point of almost being forceful. Prices were reasonable. Parking was a little difficult, because the lot was full. I'd certainly dine here again, but it wasn't the \"last meal\" I was hoping for. I thought it was one of Nashville's better restaurants, but not it's best."]]}
