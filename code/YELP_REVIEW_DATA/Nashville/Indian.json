Also do not eat Idly, vada dosa etc. this place is only for Biryani and not authentic for breakfast items. eat only Biryani and other non veg dishes.I was not happy with my last visit. the goat and chicken were not at all good. upon complaining they gave my money back on the table very unprofessional.

They have a variable menu, not a problem. The have a printed menu that is apparently meaningless, problem. The variable menu scrawled in small print on a neon markerboard (looks like something you would see behind the bar at a frat house announcing the next intramural soccer game time), problem. Said markerboard is in a place where it hard to see from where you order, problem. Said markerboard has obnoxious feature to flash rapidly in different colors - yep you guessed it they had that \"feature\" enabled. big problem.The biryani indeed had some interesting flavors but was grossly over-salted and had very few vegetables in it.

Dhum Biriyani from Hyderabad is their specialty. \u00a0We didn't try it on this visit--nuts are bad for my boys. Bawarchi uses nuts and eggs that our boys can't eat. So sad for us. It restricts a lot of our choices. For this visit, they sweetly made a giant Dosa with cheese for my little one. An Indian grilled cheese. Delicious, crispy and hot. My older son had spicy Tawa fish fry--not their greatest dish--the fish seemed a bit soggy. It wasn't really deep fried like you might think; instead it was pan fried with a crust of spice that wasn't very crispy. \u00a0The Uttapam (a rice/lentil pancake bread) was crispy, savory and delicious, with minced red onion. I had a mutton pepper fry that was very spicy-great for me. I love it hot. Authentic with lots of bones--I think this can turn off the local crowd b/c we are used to getting lots of meat-not bones. My husband had a goat curry. It was served with a side of chapatis. Very tasty. All in all, lots of savory spiciness. Great selection of Dosas and we'll be back to try those. The generous use of nuts here will ensure that with our family nut allergies, we will be eating with a side of frisson, but we will stay on the Dosa straight and narrow.

A tip: \u00a0Try the Dosas. They turn these out quickly. We've only tried one so far but the texture was excellent. High notes: \u00a0Kingfisher and Taj Indian beers. Three stars for now b/c they're still getting organized and I need to visit a few more times and try other offerings on the menu.

I'm going to say I now have no reason to contemplate returning again. I'll stress the food is not terrible, but it's neither plentiful nor a great bargain to make up for it.While in line, a large foreign object (Dr pepper can?) fell into one of their heating buckets, splashing what I think was chicken-based juices across every container... they pulled it out, and resumed... ok, I'll buy an unwashed Dr Pepper can isn't going to kill me regardless of what the internet freaks say, and even as a vegetarian a little chicken juice in everything by accident isn't going to drive me to insanity, but cross-container contamination does ride my goats.They ran out of veggie rice before I got my order in... I asked the woman if she had any more veggie rice and she said yes, I said I would have some veggie rice and... and she turned and walked away while I was speaking so I just kept talking \"I guess the rest of my order will get heard when you get back\" ok random sassy woman, not cool.Rest of my order got plopped onto the plate, I paid and left and realized the plate was actually pretty light... ok, whatever... the food was not-quite flavorless, again... oh, it had one spice, and that was burn. The veggie korma was ok but meh...sad, felt like it was undercooked and overcooked at the same time.I got done eating a $7 plate of food there and thought \"what the hell, I'm still hungry\" - I'll point out I was not horribly hungry when I went there.A bit later (friends had been waiting on food trucks and finally gave up to get food inside) I'm sitting with friends, one of which went there also, specifically stated she could not handle hot, was assured whatever she was getting was mildly spiced... rrr no.

You walk away, it's food coma time. I know this isn't a buffet, but the food tasted like it was from the Shoney's of Indian cuisine, there wasn't a whole lot of it, there was splatter and bleh...I'm just not impressed.

Seeing no vindaloo available, I opted for the two \"wuss\" curries: tikka masala and butter chicken. \u00a0They were both okay, but a little bland for my taste.

The chicken literally still had gristle and two HUGE pieces of bone in it (keep in mind this was a typical chopped chicken in a sauce dish, not tandoori or anything).Here is the kicker. I am a girl who slathers a lot of my food in Sriracha, puts a a few dots of Daves Insanity in her Chili, etc. I love hot food. But all you could taste here was 'OMG - HOT' pretty much deflating any other subtle flavors or nuances Indian food usually has. It was like the Princes of Indian cuisine. SAD FACE! I kept biting into big chunks of hot pepper in my rice. Yuck.The chana masala was alright, but the sauce was very thin and watery not really letting the 'yum' coat the beans. Let down.

The food was generously seasoned with Indian herbs & spices. My colleague & I ordered the lunch buffet, so that gave me an opportunity to sample a few of the many dishes the restaurant has to offer. I started with the fresh house salad; then cased the buffet bar for familiar foods that looked good by sight. I tried the Curry Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Vegetable Korma, Chili Chicken, Bhindi Okra Masala, Rice Pullao, and the Naan bread that was delicious alone no butter needed. I enjoyed it all and to my surprise I was full after one plate. My beverage was water, water, & more water. I must had at least six refills!

I scooped an array of things onto my plate, some of which I've had before and some I just felt like investigating.The naan is always delicious, so definitely load up on that. They had a dish called \"Chicken 65\" (I think that was the name at least) which I'd never heard of. I'm not sure what it was, but it was amazing! It actually tasted better than the Chicken Tikka I normally eat. I also liked the pakora (vegetable fritters), which were fried and lightly spiced. They were very tasty, even for veggies. One of the last things I tried was Baingan Bhurtha, which is some kind of eggplant-based side dish with peas, tomatoes, onions, and other stuff.

Naan here is always warm and nicely buttered. I honestly am not a fan on the tandoori chicken, though.

It's a pleasant spot to hang around in and the servers refill your water at a rate unparalleled by most Nashville restaurants. Furthermore, the buffet means you are in charge of how fast you get in and out of this place, making it ideal for a working day.As for the food...I've had nothing that I didn't find at least mindlessly pleasant, nor has anything been excessively enjoyable either.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was perfect and amazing. (Granted, this was my first time trying it. But if we hadn't ordered it, I'd probably not pick this restaurant again.)The lentils were my least favorite thing. Bland and goopy.

I've not been to dinner there and I imagine it's better than their buffet but I've always preferred to have options when eating Indian food out since I can cook it at home. The buffet is pretty good and has a lot of vegetarian options. It seems to be the trend in Nashville for Indian food to be mostly vegetarian. We've had chickpeas masala, vegetable vindaloo, pakora, goat saag, chicken tikka masala and chilly chicken. We also tried a couple soups and their kheer. The biggest complaint we have is that both times we've had the goat saag, everyone at the table has found bone in it. Just today I found two small bone fragments and my boyfriend found a large chunk. Last time we were there, a friend our ours found about five pieces of bone in his portion. Finding objects in food is the main reason we won't be going back.For the most part, the food is good. It's not awesome but it's pretty good. There just seems to be very little difference between the different curries. I guess Sitar prefers to serve a few signature dishes with little difference between them. Somehow, the goat saag tastes pretty similar to the chicken tikka masala and the variety of vegetable dishes. I've eaten Indian food in a variety of states and tried multiple restaurants in a few areas I've lived and I've always thought each dish was unique. Sitar's food all kind of blends together.

We finally found our way over here this past summer, and I knew I had to try the goat curry. The last time I had it was at a Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant back in Berkeley. I remembered there being a lot of bone, so I was expecting the same here.It was mouth-wateringly good and contained fewer bones. The last Indian restaurant I went to, I made the mistake of asking for medium instead of mild. The dish from that place was so fiery that I couldn't enjoy the flavor of the meat. Here, I made sure to ask for mild, and the dish was excellent.I also had my usual sides of naan, raita, and mango lassi. They were all also good. I had enough leftover to make 2 extra meals (and I don't eat massive quantities).Place was kind of dark inside, even though we were eating in the middle of the afternoon.

He said he loved his as much, maybe more than our favorite Indian place back home. I had never tried dosa before and I'll admit it was a toss up between that and the palak paneer. I almost always order spinach at Indian restaurants because I love it so much, but I decided to try something new. The dosa itself was fine. Nothing mind blowing, but okay. The actual filling was so good but there was SO little of it! My friend ordered a dosa as well and hers came wrapped up like 3 fat burritos with a ton of filling.

Bonus points if you broadcast the fact that your horrible vegetarian friends dragged you here.2) Describe in lavish detail the specific dishes that convinced you that Woodlands is, in fact, a wonderful place to dine, and rhapsodize about how your meal was in no way diminished by not having fragments of selected animal carcasses lurking within it.3) Complete your conversion narrative! Lord, lord almighty, you have seen the light!So yeah, I'm not a vegetarian either, so I guess I'll quit making fun of you now. The reason that Woodlands is so awesome is twofold: first, they have a huge and intimidating menu with everything you could possibly want on it. The descriptions are cryptic, many of them are strongly similar, and you'll find yourself wondering about what will actually come out of the kitchen. I ordered puri there once because I was in the mood for something lighter, and they served me an enormous puffy bread somewhat larger than a football that I cautiously prodded with my knife for fear that it might emit some sort of hazardous spume (spoiler alert: it did not). Second, everything is fantastically prepared, reasonably priced, and very very tasty. The curries with almonds and/or cashews are my favorite--nutty and spicy.OK, so I lied: the reasons are actually threefold--it's also BYOB. Thus, your dinner can be as fancy as you want it to be. Feel like a night on the town? Bust out that bottle of Dom. Want to slum it with your hipster friends? Bring a suitcase of PBR (unless, of course, PBR has been supplanted as the crappy beer du jour, in which case bring along your Genesee or Natty Ice or Night Train or whatever swill the youngsters are drinking these days).Finally, some superlatives: this is most definitely the best Indian food in Nashville.

I left after getting my food a little angry because I had read the fine print on the voucher and it said nothing about ordering a dinner entree. The food was decent.

With Shalimar going downhill at the speed of light, I was thrilled when Zyka opened near my regular B&B. And they would deliver! My first meal was exquisite - shrimp biryani \"Indian hot\", raitha, papadum. My next, lamb korma, was just as good. Sadly, though, the restaurant appears to be pretty uneven. We have ordered from them - and eaten there - seven times now. Three times, the food was fabulous (although a few things were odd - but more on that later). Twice, it was all right. Twice, it was not good.What's most annoying, outside of the inconsistency, is the kitchen's apparent deafness to requests. Last time, we ordered salad \"with dressing on the side\", and instead received salad with dressing, plus an extra side of dressing. Zyka offers \"dal soup\" rather than the customary dal, but we requested that they provide something more like \"dal stew\" (in the words of the gentleman on the phone and at the desk) and were told it could be done. When I arrived to pick it up, I reminded him again and was told it was done. But we got the soup. \u00a0liquid, not much solid. Two friends of mine who'd lived in India for years went there for dinner, and I asked their opinion. \"The naan was strange\", they said. I agreed. When we ordered garlic naan, which normally comes as a whole piece of naan stuffed with garlic, with garlic on top, w were served a soggy naan cut into five or six strips, nothing stuffed inside, just garlic on the outside. When I said I'd never seen naan like this and would have preferred a whole piece of bread I could tear pieces from, I was told if I'd ordered the \"regular\" naan, it would have been like that. But without garlic.The dal is strange. I have never seen dal soup at an Indian restaurant in America, though as a disclaimer I've probably only visited a few dozen in my life. But every other Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at has offered a nice, thick dal, perfect for scooping up with a piece of naan.The lamb is fabulous - I've had the rogan josh, the korma, and one other. If you can convince them you really mean \"Indian hot\", the heat is exquisite - still tasty, not sacrificing any flavor for the spiciness.I would heartily recommend not getting the Tandoori Chicken. I've tried it twice, and both times the chicken (all white meat) tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. Tough, stringy, essentially tasteless. And snd again strangely enough, it's not served with grilled onions, or lemon, as it is everywhere else I've eaten it.The Raitha is good, not terribly flavorful but nice to cool the tongue. Service is nice. They share the space with a pizza parlor (curtained off) but it never smells of pizza, only Indian food. I really hope they're able to make a few changes, like consistency. I'd love to visit more frequently, but after the last Tandoori Chicken, I'm going to try Taj on Nolensville for my next visit to Nashville instead."], ["Val P.", "I stayed away from Zyka for several months (although I live in the area) because of the reviews here, however last week was the first time I decided to go for it and try something from them. They offer free delivery with just $10 min order, so I thought \"what the heck, today's the day!\" I'll have to say that I was quite impressed! The food arrived on time, and was piping hot. The moment of truth came when I tried the Masala Naan ..... tasty, a little crisp on the edges, a little oily but not too oily, a little more spice would have been nice, but hey it was still really good! I haven't tried the other naans so can't comment on those, but the masala naan was really good. Next we tried their vegetable samosa. Note that each order is only 1 samosa, but it's substantial. Samosa was crisp, warm and delicious! Doggies enjoyed it too! (your dog may not be too crazy about it if he / she doesn't like spicy food). Then the chana masala ..... yum! Can't say it's the best chana masala I've had, but it certainly was good, and can't beat the price! The final dish we tried was the Malai Kopta. It was nice and thick, and very tasty, but a little too expensive compared to the rest of the food. So yes it was good, but I think it should have been a couple dollars cheaper. Everything else was priced right. All in all, the food was very good, and we've already ordered a second time from them! Oh and the portions were really good for the price. Note: even the Malai Kopta was a good sized portion, although I still think the Malai Kopta should have been a couple dollars cheaper. But guess what ?

They have a bar snacks menu, which overlaps with the appetizers section of the main menu. Most of the main menu is what many would call fusion cuisine. Many of the small plates and mains are familiar western dishes with Indian flavors and ingredients. They also have a traditional \"Desi Fare\" section of the menu where you choose your protein and curry, but these dishes are overpriced.Rounding out the menu, they have a daily meat & three. Admittedly, I haven't tried this yet, as it's hard to justify the price tag, but I can't imagine this sticking around as a successful staple of the restaurant. It seems like one gimmick too many. Let's delete this and simplify the options.FOOD (4.5 stars):The food has been great. So far, I've stuck with the small plates and bar snacks.The best thing I've tried has been the garam masala pork belly, served with simple greens and fresh apple and radish. The chunks of belly were crispy and caramelized on the outside and wonderfully melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.They have their take on both fish and chips and Nashville-style hot chicken (of course). The fish and chips were okay, but the fish was sadly pretty limp. I expect more of a crunch from fish and chips. The hot chicken is quite good, though hardly authentic - the ghost pepper dipping sauce was the best part.Other good snacks include the tandoori chicken poutine (amazing!), the kale parkora chaat (lightly battered, well-seasoned kale chips), and the black eyed peas tikki (black eyed pea cakes with cucumber raita for dipping).DRINK (3.5 stars):For an \"ale\" house, I was surprised that their beer selection wasn't more extensive. You can enjoy a relatively small array of craft beers and traditional Indian beers (e.g. Kingfisher), but the thing to try is their custom beers brewed in cooperation with Cool Springs Brewery (e.g. Garam Masala Ale, Chai Milk Stout, and Saffron Cardamom IPA). They also have some nice inventive cocktails at the going rate of $10-12 per quaff.AMBIANCE & DECOR (4.5 stars):It's nice in here. The vibe is very contemporary and modern, notably the projections on the exposed brick walls, but it's complemented by traditional Indian patterns and artifacts. Nicely done.PRICES (2 stars):Overall, this place is just a little too expensive, especially for Nashville. If they can sustain at these prices, more power to them. In order for me to become a regular, I know I'll need the prices to come down. Given their north Gulch location and proximity to downtown Nashville, I especially think they should rethink their lunch prices and make a real push for their happy hour.SERVICE (2 stars):Front of house is a mess so far. Both times, I encountered awkward and poor customer service at the host stand.The first time, we walked in at 5 p.m. on Sunday. We were asked \"What's your last name?\" as if we must have had a reservation. We didn't. How about \"Welcome to Chauhan. How many are in your party? Do you have a reservation?\" Our subsequent service was also terrible. It was a trainer/trainee situation, so they get a bit of a pass there. But it was early on a Sunday night, not crowded at all, and we had to wait so freakin' long for anything to happen. The dining experience took nearly two hours for a total of 4 drinks and 4 small plates. Unacceptable.The second time, I walked in with a group of young professionals at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday. We had a reservation, but if you had seen us, you would have known to ask, \"Are you here for dinner or for happy hour?\" After waiting for 1-2 minutes (which was unexplainable because no one was there), we were sat at our six-top in the completely empty dining room, only to find out that happy hour is only available in the bar area. So we had to move, which seemed absurd, because we were literally the only people in the restaurant who weren't being paid to be there. The only breath of fresh air service-wise was our bartender Asher. He was great.As a former server, I really hope to see the front of house improve."], ["Morgan H.", "great cocktails, the mussels were the best I've ever had, I wish the calamari had been more meat than breading...the non veg thali of the night was on point along with the okra!"], ["Steven H.", "We've been Chopped fans for quite some time, so my girlfriend and I decided to try out Maneet's new restaurant.... It was a great decision. The decor is great and trendy, the staff was so pleasant and the food was amazing. We had the garlic Naan for an appetizer, so fresh and light. I had the shrimp moilee and she had the chicken korma. Both were amazing and would recommend both. The chef was even in the building! She came over to the table to chat and take a photo with us. She was soooo nice and bubbly. The whole experience was fantastic and will definitely go back soon!"], ["Kimberly V.", "We had a wonderful dinner here with another couple we were visiting in Nashville.

Her food preserves the dignity and complexity of Indian cuisine, while integrating some of our favorite parts of American eating. Some of the stars of the menu include the Tikka Masala poutine-- why has no one thought of this before!?-- and the korma.Her menu also provides a meat and three option that varies daily. It comes with a side of lentils, vegetables, rice, naan, papadums and of course the meat of the day. My husband orders this every time and he's never been disappointed.As far as vibe, this place is beautifully decorated, the staff is friendly, professional, and interested in making sure they serve everything from the kitchen with dignity.For people wondering if they should venture out and try something new, this is a great place to go.

I have read that others were taken aback about the ordering process and having to tell your server all that you want when you place said order. \u00a0That did not faze me since it was explained that this is to help the kitchen have everything come to you in a relaxing flow of food. \u00a0It was an agreeable pace; neither too quick nor too slow. \u00a0It allowed for plenty of time to savor but not so much that you were left wondering when your entr\u00e9e would arrive. \u00a0The other two at my table agreed.Service was fantastic. \u00a0Our server took the time to truly walk us through the menu and explain items in great detail - down to making flavor comparisons if we were uncertain of an ingredient or flavor profile. \u00a0It was refreshing to have that type of assistance when perusing many dishes which are unfamiliar to me.We certainly were pointed in the right direction as all three of us were hooked. \u00a0I had the daily special ode to Nashville of the meat and three. \u00a0The main course of the evening was tikka masala and while outstanding, my only complaint was that for $20, I only received 4 chunks of chicken. \u00a0Truly, that was my only complaint of the evening. \u00a0But with sides, rice and naan I was more than full.Yes, I am now head over heels with this place. \u00a0I already have reservations for later this month. \u00a0I plan on being far more adventurous this time and branching out. \u00a0So yes, go try this new feather in the Nashville culinary cap. \u00a0Enjoy the ambiance, and the exotic flair that Chef Maneet Chauhan has brought to our fair city."], ["Daniel M.", "Innovative and Delicious Indian Fare wrapped in Southern style!

Have lost count of how many times i have visited the restaurant, but still can't get enough.The lunch menu offers a great blend of indian with southern food options. My fav is the tomato lentil soup served with grilled cheese sandwich. If you can't make up your mind, order the indian thali(platter) that offers an interesting variety of small portion bowls that goes beyond satisfaction. Although i say 'small' portion bowls, the platter as a whole can definitely satisfy more than one tummy!The dinner menu is equally interesting. You can find the blend of cuisines here too. Like the hot chicken served with a ghost pepper sauce on the side, or the mussels in tikka sauce. The ribs on the entree menu cannot be forgotten. Ofcourse, beyond this is the traditional variety of curries and kebabs. And the indian bread....OMG! They actually have a garlic parmesan naan(bread)!!! After all the hogging....there is no way u wanna skip the desserts!And of course..........the Sunday brunch takes it to another level. Could u ever imagine a parantha taco?? Try it!!! n ull thank me for just mentioning it! Its impressive how Chef Maneet can create such tasteful, satisfying and exciting food, that u only want to keep coming back for more. Delicious!!....is just an understatement of the food served here.N not to forget.....the pricing is too reasonable for the indulgence u get with a perfect ambience at Chauhan!"], ["Katie I.", "First Sean, then Jonathan, now Maneet. Nashville is finally getting on the culinary map! It's really hard to find an Indian restaurant that just wows me after having my Indian friend/foodie cook a homemade Indian feast. We have an array of Indian in Nashville, which some are good, however, Chauhan is in a league of its own.First of all, I'm thrilled to see that side of 12th Ave being revived. I hadn't been over to that side of Broadway since 12th and Porter days. The build out is incredible. Indian trinkets meet modern swank and urban vibe. It's got just the amount of class without being too pretentious. We've been twice now, and I have noticed the drink menu has changed a bit. The first time I had an awesome drink which I described in the pic. I mean, how many drinks have star anise in them? This time I didn't see that one listed, so I opted for a white wine, which was ok.The showstopper here is the kale appetizer. It's lightly fried (almost like a tempura) on a bed of spicy garbanzo and mint yogurt. There are so many layers to this, taste, flavor, texture. It's freaking amazing and you should get it. Most unique appetizer in Nashville.They have a meat and 3 changing daily. Several curries to choose from and other entr\u00e9e selections. The prices are very reasonable to me. Most curries are under $18. The saag paneer was pretty good, but my absolute favorite is the chicken korma. It is truly elevated Indian comfort food. They do give you a lot of sauce with whatever protein you choose, so box it up and take it home. I could drink the stuff. Tender chicken, the rice is perfect. Perfect for sharing. Garlic naan- amazing. We tried a side of dal this time, one of my favorite things ever. Sadly, it was just ok. It was a bit soupy to me. I believe the server said it was a 5 lentil dal that day, but looked like mostly white/light colored lentils. I prefer green, red, black. I may try this again as they change it. Was too full for dessert, but I will be back and back again. I truly believe for those of you scared of Indian food, this place may convert you. It's a great place for a date, girls night, any occasion really. I also noticed they will be opening up for lunch soon and there is a happy hour Sunday- Thursday. Also, Maneet has been there both times working it. She is amazing and we are so lucky to have her in Nashville. Well done, Maneet!"], ["Eliza R.", "Chauhan Ale & Masala House was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. \u00a0I was absolutely thrilled with all of the food and drink I ordered! \u00a0To start, I ordered a chai milk stout from a local brewery in Cool Springs. \u00a0It was $10 for a pint, and absolutely worth it. \u00a0For appetizers, my friend and I split the masala dabba and tandoori bread, which came with a wheel of naan bread and a variety of flavored butters and chutneys. \u00a0We also decided to splurge and get an extra wheel of garlic parmesan naan, which was absolutely fresh and warm and delicious. The menu is really interesting and there is a variety of food to choose from, ranging from more traditional Indian (such as chicken tikka masala) to inventive Indian-Southern fusions. \u00a0I ordered the guava glazed BBQ ribs, which came with a cold fingerling potato salad and collard greens. \u00a0The ribs were incredible, with super-tender meat that was falling off the bone. \u00a0At this point, I figured I should just go all out and get dessert. \u00a0I had looked at the menu before coming to the restaurant and I had my heart set on the pot de creme, which they were out of. \u00a0In its place, I had a spiced maple jaggery kheer sunday, which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. \u00a0It had rice pudding, spiced pecans, and some dried fruit. \u00a0It tasted like everything I wanted out of a dessert: sweet and light and satisfying. \u00a0The perfect end to the most delicious meal.So, this brings to me to the Chauhan's only downfall, which is why I only give it 4 stars. \u00a0The service is painfully slow. \u00a0Friendly and attentive, for sure, but perhaps too much so. \u00a0The waiter tended to ramble on about each dish, and give his opinion on it. \u00a0I'm pretty familiar with Indian cuisine, so I didn't find it necessary. \u00a0The food also came out very slowly. \u00a0To put it in perspective, I had a reservation at 7:30 and was planning on seeing a film at the Belcourt at 8:55. \u00a0By 8:45, we still hadn't received our check, even though we were finished with our entrees. \u00a0We decided to just go ahead and order dessert since we were going to be late to the movie anyway! \u00a0We finally ended up leaving at 9:40 or so. \u00a0Normally I like long dinners, but since I had plans afterward, I was a little disappointed that everything took so long. \u00a0I'll end the review here; the food is fantastic, the ambiance is lovely. \u00a0I wanted to go back the next day to try more off the menu! \u00a0Just give yourself plenty of time when you eat here, and make sure you don't have any plans set in stone afterward. \u00a0I'm happy to have this addition to the Nashville food scene - there's nothing else quite like it."]], "Persis Biryani Indian Grill": [["Teresa B.", "I love the food here every time I get a chance to be in Mt.

The first thing you may notice when you go here is that the interior atmosphere is pleasantly sleek/modern and the host will greet you immediately.Everything on the menu can be ordered in three spice levels, appealing to a wide array of taste buds: mild, medium, or hot. So don't be afraid! The menu is standard Indian fare with some upgrades and fancy presentations. Both times I've been, my meal has been wonderful and served quickly. My friend ordered the goat dish and it had a lot of bones in it. He ate around it and said it was delicious but the bones were unexpected. The service is very friendly and helpful and you'll never have to ask for a refill. Unfortunately, they haven't quite nailed the aspect of how often to check in with guests. I think perhaps they are so concerned with providing excellent customer service that they have become a little intrusive. Our waitress left to get us refills, but before she came back two other employees had already interrupted our conversation to ask if we needed water. Normally this would be considered wonderful, however this situation happened multiple times and became disruptive. I certainly hope they find a good balance soon because the food is delicious at a great price and I will definitely be going back!"], ["Aaron J.", "Came here with a large group of 12 people and the service for our party was great.

I really liked the Apollo fish too. The waiters kept the beers coming and we all did family style for the entre\u00e8s with my favorites being the butter chicken, goat vindaloo (its spicy) and the chicken tikka masala, which was one of the best I've ever had.

Malai Kofta: \u00a0I think this was a good curry to order, although it's not the best that I've had in Nashville. \u00a0I can't complain about it, the portion is large, the taste is good, and it's something that most people would enjoy. \u00a0Veggie Biriyani: \u00a0I thought the Biriyani was good, but I didn't like the size of vegetables in the dish, almost all of them were very large. \u00a0I wish they would cut it down to smaller sizes, because the vegetables overwhelm the dish at certain points. \u00a0The taste is good though. \u00a0Veggie Pizza: \u00a0I tried this out mainly because I was just curious as to how they would do pizza, with low expectations, and those expectations were warranted. \u00a0This is something that I would most likely avoid, I didn't like this one much at all. \u00a0I think the best thing about the place is the prices. \u00a0They don't cost an arm and a leg to order out, and the food isn't compromised. \u00a0There is another Indian place I like better than Cafe India, but it's definitely more expensive (almost double), and every other place in the same price range just doesn't compare taste wise. \u00a0They combine very good prices, with excellent taste to give you a really good experience. \u00a0While I was there, I do think they also give you free refills on fountain drinks. \u00a0The people working there have been friendly each time I've visited. \u00a0The first couple of times I was there, the place was pretty empty, but the last two times, there seemed to be way more people there, so maybe the word is spreading about the establishment. \u00a0 I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Indian food, and likes to save money when ordering out."], ["James M.", "I was pretty happy with my visit to Cafe India. It was a good mix of affordable, flavorful, and filling. My fiancee and I went here to pick up some take-out on a random weeknight. I called ahead for some Saag Paneer and Chicken Biryani. When I got there, I was craving some samosas and naan so I added those to the order. The samosas required an extra 8-10 minutes of waiting for the food, which was fine.Cafe India gets extra points for being the most affordable of the Indian options in this little part of Cool Springs. The food itself was good, not great, but good. I liked the flavor of the Saag Paneer and loved the Samosas (potato goodness). My one complaint was that the Chicken Biryani was made with whole chicken instead of chicken breasts or even just de-boned chicken meat which necessitated way too much search for tendons and bones while eating the entree. It's a pithy complaint, I know, but I just really don't care for going through searching for bones in my meal. In the future, I'll just order veggie entrees when getting Cafe India and will likely be very happy with the result!Pros:Affordable-This is by far the most affordable Indian spot in the Cool Springs area. Welcoming- While the decor is nondescript, the people are nice and welcoming. Flavorful- I enjoyed the flavors they had in their Saag Paneer and Samosas a lot. The Samosa in particular was a standout!Cons:Chicken bones in the Biryani. For some, this won't be an issue but I prefer to not have to dig through my meal looking for bones prior to eating it. The decor left a little to be desired but I didn't come for the decor.Overall:This is a decent quality and great value Indian option in the Cool Springs area. My fiancee and I easily made two meals out of our two entrees and one appetizer. It's a great option and we'll be back for an Indian fix, I'm sure."], ["Craig W.", "I have eaten at Cafe India a few times and it is always great!

I also had the potato samosas. Normally they are served with dipping sauce (prob to mask how dry they are) but these were served alone, and it was so flavorful and moist!

Instead after the 45 minutes passed she came up to me and asked, \"Sir, what did you order again?\" I was furious, but I exercised restraint and said the two chicken wraps. I then proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for my food, which was not that great plus it was cold. I know I'm am a person with patients but this was a test of my patients becuase I have never waited over an hour for a to go order.

After going to House of India, I realized it was only because I hadn't had AMAZING Indian food.This place has that AMAZING Indian food. Their chicken makhani is my favorite. I also love the chana masala, and the garlic naan is to die for!!! Get the garlic chili naan if you can handle spice, but beware, it is VERY spicy. I knew this place was legit when we took our native Indian friend here, and he loved it too. The lunch buffet is an excellent opportunity to try several different dishes if you are curious about Indian food or want to try this particular restaurant for the first time. It's also great if you are just craving it all and can't make a decision. They bring fresh naan to the table at lunch, but not garlic naan. Just regular butter naan.

But, it was a Sunday. We were hankering for something that was not from our own kitchen. We rolled through our favorites that were close, in Cool Springs. Was there Indian food here to try? \u00a0We'd been to Biwrachi Biriyani Point. There was Bombay Bistro--hip, clever cocktails, excellent tikka masala. But then we found House of India on Yelp. *Eyebrows up* reviews were good and great. My lip curled. If Swag didn't survive, how could anything come close to appeasing my snobby demands?But, it had been so long since we had the Spice. So, we bundled ourselves up and highed ourselves to HOI. As we walked in the door, I thought, grrrr, this feels a little like the Raj's British parlor. We were seated in a booth with broken down springs. Someone lit the table light that smelled so strongly of petroleum, I wanted to gag. Sounds like it's going to hell from here, right?Wrong. I was so wrong. As one of my sons said, his sadness at missing Siva and Vijay made us feel grudging toward this restaurant. Each of the beginning dishes made us feel disloyal. We were discomfited by being there. But, one by one, we were won over by the food. We asked for the dishes to be super hot--spicy. And they were. My ears were ringing pleasantly. They do not play here. We had the kebab appetizer, the goat biriyani, lamb saag, tadad daal (yellow lentil as), chicken 65, and gulab jamun and masala chai -- hot sweet, redolent with spice. The tadad Daal was absolutely stand out. Very garlicky with strong notes of cumin and arse-kicking heat. The goat biriyani was far wetter than I preferred and heavier on cardamom than I expected but damned if I didn't get a little addicted. The lamb saag was smokey, earthy and delicious. The chicken 65 was not great. Too sloppy and greasy. Here, I missed Dr. Vijay's Chili Chicken. We also missed Siva's meticulous dosas and abundant freshly sliced red onions. Sigh. But, this food was very, very good. The environs don't necessarily appeal to us but the food is excellent. We will be back. HOI has a robust take out business so maybe we are in good company. While we miss the Swag family so very much, we are delighted to find a new Indian restaurant in Cool Springs that turns out exceptional food that is flavorful, garlicky, and highly seasoned.

Chicken Tikka masala, chicken saag pander. All delicious! I highly recommend it!"], ["Lance L.", "Excellent service, very good food. Very nice atmosphere. I came here for lunch on a Wednesday, and was greeted graciously by the host and seated in a peaceful booth. The buffet table had all the \"Indian Buffet Standards\", and then some. It was a very enjoyable meal, because of both the food selection and the atmosphere."], ["Jesse P.", "Mango lassi drink, Lamb curry (Indian spicey) and naan bread. Everything was phenomenal. Lamb curry was perfectly spicy with plenty of exotic flavors. Not overwhelmingly spicy either. Lamb was cooked perfectly and very tender. Now back to my food.

I often get the samosas for lunch because they are perfect to satisfy my hunger but keeping a light stomach for yoga. $1.99 for lunch! Yes!"], ["Rose D.", "I love Indian food and am often dissapointed but this place is AMAZING! Everything we tried was absolutely delicious and the service was great.

Best gulab jamun I have ever had!"], ["Preston R.", "The service and food here were extremely good. We loved using our check-in offer for a discount. The menu said there were no refills on soda/water which had me concerned, but they didn't charge us for refills. I'll be back!"], ["Tony C.", "Absolutely terrible service. Have been waiting 90 minutes and still no food and was given attitude when asked. At least 4 tables around us walked out tonight. Such a shame.

The food was good, but the service was terrible no apologies only excuses from staff and very unfriendly."], ["Brian B.", "House of India is the best Indian Food hands down in Franklin. I ordered food to go for my family if 9. Ordered five entrees, two appetizers and some nan bread. It was enough food to feed my family for three meals. The food is just delicious.

Will be back many time over!"], ["Rich F.", "The food was wonderful, we had the chicken chilly and the shrimp curry. Both dishes were prepared perfectly and the service was excellent."], ["Kathy D.", "I ordered food online and had the food delivered to my hotel room.

We have been to 4.5 star Indian restaurants in NYC and LA that do not hold a candle to this place. We like the other Indian restaurants in Franklin and Nashville but we LOVE House of India. The food is the best we have had. Perfect spice, perfect flavor. Our favorite, of course, is Chicken Tikka Masala. The bonus is that the owner is so accommodating and the servers are friendly and hard working. Cannot recommend this restaurant enough. And, we're eating here tomorrow night, too!"], ["T F.", "We chose to eat here thanks to fellow Yelpers!

S.", "I took my adult son here for a special occasion and for an eating adventure. We had a really nice dinner. The people who served us were very friendly and happy to tell us about the different dishes and to answer our questions. \u00a0If you are new to Indian food ask for the most poplar chicken dish."]], "Shalimar Restaurant": [], "The Clay Pit": [["Derek J.", "The price was a little more than I expected for lunch. \u00a0It runs almost $10 for the lunch buffet. \u00a0I like how they serve the buffet for health reasons, but I also didn't like to wait for a rush of people to be served before I could get a second plate.Food is good."], ["Alex B.", "The food is amazing. Great vegetarian choices as well. The staff are always friendly & welcoming. Unlike many indian buffets, they cook your bread to order. It's always hot & delicious."], ["Rahul I.", "Lay off on the salt!!!!! \u00a0I took my wife, my mother, and my two aunts (from India), here, as we were driving from Chattanooga to Memphis and stopped for Lunch. \u00a0Good grief. \u00a0They need to lay off the salt. \u00a0No one was impressed."], ["Chris M.", "I went here for a late lunch around 3:30PM today. I had been meaning to go by this place for over a year now, and I'm glad that I did. Although no one was there this late in the afternoon, the food was still GREAT.I got the $6.99 special, rice with veggies, lentils, and spinach. Although it had probably been sitting for a couple of hours since lunch, it was still extremely good. I love Indian food anyway, but this place is great... and in Murfreesboro!I'm going to be going by here on a regular basis. You should too.-Chris"], ["Trace S.", "The food at the Clay Pit is super good! And I'd say pretty hard to beat for the price! It's a little dingy but I don't care when the food is that good.

It is very small and far away from Nashville (25 miles). The food is really good. We ordered samosas (very good), fish tikka, chicken tikka masala, naans, sweet lassi, alu parata. I liked the food. They were very friendly and took care of us very well. Nice little restaurant. It is not the best but definitely worth trying every now and then. If you are MTSU student, you can have some discount."], ["Eddie D.", "This place is usually mediocre compared to other Indian buffets I've had. Today, however, everything was much better! If you are looking for something different in Murfreesboro, don't be afraid to give this place a try!"], ["Larry N.", "Pricy and small portions"], ["M. Dinne F.", "As we say up north, the food was \"wicked\" salty. \u00a0Naan was good, pakoras were really salty but otherwise had good flavor. \u00a0Played it safe and had chicken tikka masala and I have had better. \u00a0Not bad, just not the depth of flavor I am accustomed to with Indian cuisine. \u00a0You could do worse but don't give up on Indian if the mediocre food at the Clay Pit is your first experience with the cuisine. \u00a0Keep eating...."], ["Carla C.", "YUM!!! \u00a0The place has great food! \u00a0The buffet is tame so that any newcomer can experience the cuisine, yet it is still full of flavor and thoroughly enjoyable. \u00a0Very bare bones place, but nice folks, excellent food, good prices. \u00a0SO HAPPY they're in the 'Boro!"], ["George N.", "Very basic, they have a good lunch special.

It does not have an appealing exterior so I was prepared for the food to be bad, but it was actually quite good. It was a buffet but not a help-yourself buffet. The portion was adequate and the food was yummy. I would recommend it for lunch."], ["Buck N.", "Bit of a surprise finding an indian restaurant this good in Murfreesboro. Buffet is reasonably priced and they always have a nice variety of items with occasional things like chili catfish that you don't find at most indian buffets. Simple restaurant with a nice attentive staff and they always have soccer on. Always look forward to going to this place."], ["Timothy B.", "I must say I'm a fan. There are better places, but they do have some good food. The price is pretty low and the food is good.
