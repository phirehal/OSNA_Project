It was super empty and we ordered a fried rice, stir fry, red curry, pad thai and chicken satay to go. We had two mess ups with our order - first we asked for a beef basil stir fry, but they gave us two fried rices instead. Second, we asked for no tofu in the pad thai, but it came with it. With take out orders, it can be hard to ensure you are getting exactly what you want (also since a lot of the dishes are variations of Pad Pro Or Ko in them) so I understand the confusion. I was looking forward to the stirfry so it was quite disappointing though. I loved the flavor of the fried rice, we got the one with the stir fried basil, bell pepper and spicy sauce. It was really awesome! The pad thai was pretty good too, great flavor and noodles weren't over cooked. I wish it had some more sauce as it was a little dry though. The red curry was good but different. I am use to red curry having bamboo shoots and pineapple, but this had neither and had lots of eggplant. Also, I has for thai spicy, which normally is extra of the chili powder, but it was made with tons of chili oil and the top had about a half inch of oil sitting when we got home. \u00a0I would go back to try the several offerings they had and make sure we got our correct order.

With two servers you sometimes get kind of forgotten and have to catch someone for a drink refill.The food is good. Sometimes really good. The Pad Ke Mao is my favorite and is very good with shrimp. One constant with Thai places in Nashville, the exception being Smiling Elephant, is that they pre cook the protein and toss it with the dish at the end. That saves time. Problem is that the meat doesn't taste like anything. I guess that the shrimp cooks quickly enough that it can be added to the stir fry. They do take the tails off the shrimp which is a plus.

I've tried the pad Thai, curry chicken, pho, and more recently the duck soup with the egg noodles (I forget the name). All have been delicious. I also like how they offer a variety of spices and sauces to supplement the dish. \u00a0I personally like the dry hot pepper spices. I too my husband here for the first time today, and he was impressed about the cleanliness and also the quality and freshness of the food and ingredients.

The dinning area was little over 1/3 full and there was only a hostess & a sever working. I ordered the chicken pad Thai, boring to some, but I enjoy it. The food took a little while to get out, nearly 45 minutes to get two orders of pad Thai chicken out.

The staff was helpful, patient, and assisted with my many menu pertaining questions as needed. I decided to order the Satay Shrimp Skewer served with fried rice, a salad, and served with this delicious peanut sauce on the side. I sampled from my co-worker's plate 1 spring roll, 1/2 cream cheese wonton, & 1 pan fried dumpling. It was delicious as well. Our orders were ready in less than 10 minutes. The food was hot, fresh, well seasoned, & satisfying \u00a0to my palate.

The service is quick and friendly. While eating in the restaurant with my father and roommate, we saw families, students, and regulars walk in constantly. You order at the counter, and the hostess will speed by with plasticware and paper plates a few minutes later. While popular and near-lightning speed, the food left one a bit wanting. My chicken pad thai tasted a bit ketchup-laden, but still quite tasty with a generous heaping of peanut sauce and spicy goodness. The chicken was a tad too stringy and dry for me. They offer some Vietnamese food as well, though my dad claims the pho is far from authentic (albeit quite delicious).I would say this place is a great deal, but lacks some freshness (ie: lime in the pad thai, variety of veggies in the salad, etc). Otherwise, the speed and seasonings more than make up for some minor issues."], ["Hye Eun C.", "Let's be clear, Satay Grill is neither the most authentic or mindblowing Thai place Nashville has to offer; however, when I'm looking for a quick-thai fix, it definitely delivers. I ordered a small Tom Kha soup and the chicken satay (comes with steamed or fried rice and side salad or spring roll). Both were delicious. The soup was the perfect mix of sweet and sour, and the chicken was moist and seasoned well. The peanut sauce that comes with the chicken was great, as well. I left feeling satisfied with both food and service, with my wallet only $10 lighter. Would come again!"], ["Heidi B.", "I give this place a five because it's one of my favorite restaurants for food. \u00a0There can totally be improvements on the consistency of the shakes (flavor), but that's about it.

The chicken was terrible. Had a nasty flavor and texture. The ordering at the front and then sitting down thing was awkward. I guess they don't have servers?! But it looked like a place that would have servers. It's a shame cause other things weren't too too bad. I went here for lunch with a friend. We both ordered pad Thai which came with a spring roll or salad. The spring roll was tiny and didn't seem too fresh. I say it's a shame cause the rice noodles were good! And I ordered a 5/5 for spiciness and the spice was there! Yum. But the dish was just kinda blah. And that nasty chicken. The place was very small. Nothing special there. Tiny two person tables.

I ordered again just last night (Drunken noodles with Tofu, Spice Basil Chicken, Panang curry bowl) and everything was pretty great. The veggies have been moved up into the fresh category! The tofu is sliced pretty thinly which I really like. The noodles get clumped up, but whatcha gunna do.

Honestly, since Clarksville has nothing even close to Thai food, it's a must when you're driving to, from or through Nashville and i yelped it and we went on our way. I was a little confused at the service of the restaurant because you order at the counter, then go sit down and they bring it to you. I was feeling a little frisky and wanted to try something new (other than the Pad Thai) and when we were in DC, my boyfriend had come across an interesting dish called \"Crispy Basil Beef\" and it was... the best thing we'd ever tasted. Sadly, they did not have Crispy Beef but they did have Crispy Basil Chicken and i got the Panag Curry. The food comes out in paper plates, which, oddly enough is the smartest thing i've seen a restaurant do. The prices are not expensive and honestly the food speaks for itself. When you know how to make Thai Food, you can pretty much serve it on a banana leaf and it'll taste amazing - which it was. The panang curry was delicious and perfect seasoned. The Crispy Chicken, for me, was not the best. It was simply ordinary for me, but my boyfriend liked it. I would still recommend Phooket but this is a close second."], ["Alex P.", "They have bubble tea!!

Yes please!!I decided to call in an order for pick up to give them a try, and ordered the vegetable stir fry, green curry, and tom kha soup. They told me it would be ready when I arrived, so I waited about 15 minutes and made my way over. The girl at the front counter could not place my order once I got there and while trying to figure out what happened she was on the phone with a delivery order who got the wrong food (I'm thinking mine). Confusion ensued, and after waiting another 15 minutes I had my take out order. Someone (I think the manager) gave me a free bottled drink for my trouble. So I get the food home and the portions are small. Granted, these would be good for me eating alone, but I'm accustomed to a Thai feast with plenty of leftovers. \u00a0However, it was only $21.00 for 2 entrees and a soup, so at least it was cheap! My green curry was spicy and had a good flavor, and so did the tom kha soup. However, the veggie stir fry was rather bland, but overall it was a decent meal.

First: they put the salad in the same container as the hot food. It is obvious these people have never ordered delivery or they would know how disgusting warm iceberg lettuce is.

This place has some solid Panang curry, although the chicken is a little on the off side. I'm not sure exactly what it was with the taste, maybe just a slight aversion to dark meat on my part. Also, the preponderance of paper plates and cutlery makes me wonder how their prices are so reasonable, literally everything is paper plates and plastic forks. You would think a restaurant would naturally just use dishes, but it does look like a small kitchen.The egg roll is sinfully delicious, in that deep fried crispy kind of way. So go ahead and splurge calorically on it, you'll enjoy it. I'll be back here again, if not for the Panang, then maybe to try the Black Pepper crab."], ["Grace A.", "I am a huge fan of Satay!

As a vegetarian they had the standard option of ripping apart the meat and delicately substituting it with tofu. I got a soup and noodles, and was rewarded for my bravery. Succulent vegetables in spicy thai curry and lightly sauteed tofu filled me up.I'll definitely be back for dinner at some time. Maybe bring someone special."], ["Anna M.", "The service was great, but the food was terrible. We are visiting from out of town and we wanted some thai food.

It took over a half hour for us to be served our meal. The waitress, while sweet, was unfamiliar with basic questions about the menu, and was rarely seen. The drunken noodles were ok, maybe average. The panang curry was watered down and bland. The dipping sauce for the summer rolls was also watered down and bland. Even the white rice that came with the curry was over cooked and cooked with too much water. If the rice is bad in an Asian restaurant you know you've got problems!

The menu here is more of an Asian mashup than strictly Thai - think crab wontons in the appetizer list - but they cop to that. The food was just blah. I had Pad Thai with shrimp and asked them to throw some egg in it like they did in all the places in Thailand where I had it, and they were accommodating but it had no zip. Thai food is all about the balance of different elements - hot, sweet, sour, herbaceous, salt, etc. and there is really no place (or excuse) for tasteless dishes. The chicken satay appetizer was nicely cooked - juicy, not dried out and the requisite peanut sauce served as an accompaniment. Everything about this restaurant screamed \"adequate\", except the service, which was very good.

It is probably a lunch spot, as they have an extensive lunch specials list at the door and the fact that my wife and I dined for nearly two hours and saw no other customers on a Tuesday night from 5:30 til about 7:15. I previously ate here with my brother at 3 in the afternoon and saw a couple of other customers and evidence of the lunch rush being cleaned up upon our arrival.We began our meal with the Thai fried dumplings and vegetable spring rolls. I subtract a star here, because we ordered the vegetable egg rolls. The spring rolls were excellent, but they were not what we ordered. The dumplings were okay. They are deep-fried, not pan fried, which surprised me, but was an okay change. I thought they were a little too done, but the filling was quite tasty. For entrees we ordered the Pad Thai and the Pad See-ew, both prepared with chicken. We were not offered the option to choose our level of spiciness, so the dishes came out relatively bland. A bottle of Sriracha fixed that quickly. Upon checking with our server at the end of the meal, she told me that the customer should specify their preferred level of spice when ordering, I guess that means they don't prompt you and make it bland if you don't tell them otherwise. Good to know. I won't take a star off for the miscommunication. Otherwise the dishes were good. The noodles were wonderfully textured, not overcooked in the slightest. The chicken was seasoned well and very juicy, not dry or overcooked at all. The service was very friendly, but slow, costing another star, especially considering the fact we were outnumbered by staff at a ratio of 2:1. Maybe they do a great deal of takeout business?"], ["Chuck G.", "Pad Thai was really good, \u00a0Drunken noodles was awesome. \u00a0Spring rolls so-so. portion sixes were not so big that I overate.

I may even be ever so slightly obsessed with it. I have been back to Thai Star several times, and even though it's not my favorite Thai restaurant in Nashville, I still stand by the fact that I think that it is pretty quality. I have gone a couple of times when the main chef is not there, and the food is good but not quite up to its usual standards. If the chef is there, then he will make your food just how you like it; you only have to ask.Last night, (for whatever reason), I decided to deviate from what I usually order (Pad Kee Mao or curry) and I ordered the Lard Nar. I also decided that I wanted my food hotter (spicier) than normal. The only problem is that I usually get it native. So I told the waiter, \"make me cry\". He guaranteed the chef would comply. They did not disappoint. That was pretty close to the hottest food I have ever had (while still being full of amazing flavor), and I loved every minute of it. Even though I did not shed a tear, I found a new cure for all this pollen that has plagued me this spring. It cleared my sinuses right up! Bottom Line: Perhaps this place may be hit or miss as some suggest (as far as service and food), but I have found that this place tends to deliver the majority of the time.

Soon after, our Crab Rangoons arrived. There were 5 of them with a light sweet/sour sauce on the side. We have a soft spot for these even though they are technically an American invention. Thai Star's are some of the most delicious I've tasted as they actually taste like crab.Just as we were finishing them, our entrees came out. My red curry came in a bowl with sticky rice on the side. It was seasoned well and the broth was perfect. The amount of spice was perfect for a red curry as I'd not asked for \"Thai Spicy\" on this trip. My boyfriend's Drunkard Noodles were bursting with flavor and, since he hadn't asked them to be, weren't spicy. Both dishes were prepared traditionally.I will add that we've been here a few times and the only problem we've had is with service.

So we passed this place running errands this afternoon and thought, \"hey, I've never noticed that there before by the tunnel?\" So after a few stops, we head into the parking lot to scope the place out. I jump on Yelp on my phone to check the reviews. Solid reviews... no terrible ones... oh and a Yelp special discount! Oh damn... weekdays only. So we go inside, past the walls of bamboo and have a seat at a table (No booths BTW). Our waiter comes over pretty quickly to get our drinks and greet us. I notice that the sodas on the drink menu used to say \"no refills,\" but the \"no\" has been marked out. The blonde orders a Dr Pepper, and I (the heathen) order a Coke. They bring out a full, iced glass for both of us AND unopened cans of Coke and Dr Pepper!?! WOOHOO! Coke with a Coke chaser! It's the little things that thrill me. After all, if my waiter keeps my drink full, everything else can be crappy and I will still tip at least 20%. We all look over the menu trying to decide what to get. The Vegan orders the Yellow Curry w/ Tofu. The blonde orders the Pad Kee Mau with chicken (Drunkard Noodle). I order the String bean w/ chicken... hold the Jesus. We also got a couple fresh spring rolls. While not the best fresh spring rolls I've ever had, they were pretty good... not as flavorful as say, King Market or PS Noodle Pot.

So we then start trying eachother's food. Seriously... some of the BEST yellow Thai curry I've ever tasted. The drunkard noodles were amazing too. And of course, my string bean chicken was awesome. The service was excellent throughout the meal. We had both a waiter and waitress come around for drink refills and status checks and everything. Not pushy, but very attentive and the type of service that just made you feel welcome. Noticed several people come in to get carryout while we were there.

I could see taking my extended family here as well, 10-12 people sharing dishes. And I'm curious what the chef would do if we ordered a \"regular Thai feast\" in advance. We did that once as a group at Smiling Elephant, and it was revelatory.We wandered in on a very hot Saturday afternoon, and the atmosphere was cool and pleasant. Were immediately greeted warmly, told to seat ourselves - the seats, by the way, are comfortable even at my wife's petit height.The chef himself came out when my wife ordered \"Thai hot\" to make sure she meant it - and for the very first time in Nashville, she was served something truly Thai hot. I asked about Yum Woon Sen, one of my absolute favorite bean thread salads that was not on the menu, and he assured me he could make it. What came really didn't bear much of a resemblance to any YWS I'd had before, anywhere in the world, and though the basic cold noodle salad with some veggies and chicken and shrimp was all right, it was a bit disappointing when I'd been expecting something else. My own personal test of Thai restaurants are the Larb Gai and the Tom Yum soup. His Larb Gai was fine, though nowhere near as delicate as Smiling Elephant's. And at a requested \"seven hot\", it was really really spicy. Almost too much, obscuring the taste of the food. I don't know how Smiling Elephant manages to do lethally hot dishes and retain their delicacy and taste, but this restaurant could use a bit of help in that direction.Service was fine, the girl serving was pretty young but nice. She didn't check back with us at all, though; we had to find her to ask for the check, or motion from across the room to catch her eye when we needed something. But still, she was pleasant and professional otherwise. Unfortunately, Smiling Elephant has set a standard for Nashville Thai that's going to be difficult to beat. I would go back to Thai Star - it was remarkably clean (their 97 food rating hung proudly and visibly on the wall), not noisy, and the food was good. But I wouldn't bring anyone used to great Thai food here, personally."], ["Phillip P.", "I really love Thai food and when one of the people I work with stated this was her new favorite Thai restaurant, I knew I had to try it.

The crispy noodles were in a separate box and were not stir fried at all. \u00a0I decided to live with what I got and I have to say it really sucked. The crab rangoons were passable. \u00a0They had an almost medicinal, for lack of better description, taste to them. Kind of funky. \u00a0The fresh spring rolls were good.Anyway, I hate to bitch.

Between thrifting, ice cream, and all sorts of games and shenanigans, our attention kept coming back to just how good the green curry was. We were so full at the end of it, but we ate every bite, not wanting to waste it. The truck was located near a small park off 21st avenue, and even that was awesome. There was a picnic table under a gigantic tree that we were all able to climb. It was awesome. I don't know how often they park next to the army surplus beside the park, but when they do, go. It's awesome. Overall, the DegThai food truck was the highlight of our friend's 30th celebration, and we will most certainly be back.

That being said, I feel like when it comes to Asian food in Nashville I'm always grading on a curve- Deg Thai tastes good, but the depth of flavor to the curry isn't there and the food is at times oversalted. Then again, it's being served out of the back of a truck and is fast, convenient, consistent, and friendly. So, as far as fast casual Thai/Asian options in Nashville go, five stars.

Occasionally \"hot\" isn't as hot as normal and I have to spice it up when I get back to my office, but it's usually exactly how I want it. The staff is really friendly as well! It really can be a challenge to find good Asian food in Nashville, but DegThai always hits the spot. Plus, it's been approved by my mostly Asian group of coworkers so that must be a good thing! Since the first time I took the group here for lunch they're constantly asking to go back.You sometimes have a wait a while to get your food, but I think it's worth it for everything to be made fresh. They handle a big crowd pretty well and the wait is never too bad.

I deflected meeting invitations from landing on my calendar like a jujitsu master. I planned to go camp out at 4am Wednesday to beat the lines.

My only \"complaint\" is that I would have liked more of them. It seems that they used to charge $7 for their entrees - they now charge $8, but the portions are filling.An added bonus: Rather than the food truck standard paper to-go \"dish\", DegThai serves their entrees in a sturdy plastic take-away container with a snap top - genius!"], ["Ruiqiu K.", "Being a transplant from a more Asian populated city on the West Coast, I find myself craving Asian flavors all the time. But my limited access to wheels has kept me eating boring sandwiches. And I can't even find decent daikon to make homemade do chua for these sandwiches, either!So it is with joy that I found out that there is a Thai food truck that comes to my neighborhood during its rotation. I made sure to follow them on Twitter so that I know when they'll be in the area.While I wish they had more variety, I'm perfectly fine with the choices they have. For the basic rice dishes, you order your choice of protein (beef, chicken, tofu, or pork), a sauce (basil, red curry, or toasted sweet chili), and then indicate how spicy hot you want it (mild, medium, hot, native Thai hot). I had the pork chili and asked for a heat level of between mild and medium. It was the perfect heat setting for this spice wimp.I also had the Thai iced tea. I've had hits or misses when it comes to Thai iced tea (which is why I usually get Thai iced coffee, which they don't offer here). And Deg Thai's version of the tea was a definite hit. Plus, the dairy in it helps cool any heat I can't take.I really wanted to try the spring rolls, but I will have to wait until they come to my neighborhood again. That's when I'll try either their wrap or their beef salad.The food is cooked to order, so perhaps I'll be able to ask them to withhold the basil if I try their red curry.

When I drove past the Rivergate location, I didn't realize they were open because there weren't many cars in the parking lot. Several co-workers ended up informing me that it was open for business. While other eateries in the area have at least 5-10 cars/ 10-20 customers throughout the day, there have been times where me and my party are the only people there.In general, they serve what many other Asian \u00a0restaurants serve: Fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls, etc. These items will run you on average between $10- $13 per meal. However, they also serve different soups and curry dishes which I'd never had before going to the Thai Phooket. Those are also tasty and reasonably priced. There are more exotic dishes that are pretty pricey: They have fish and duck specials that start at $15. Most people, I've noticed, order to-go. My last visit there explained why that is. I went to the Rivergate location with a friend during his lunch break. He got there first and ordered drinks. My drink wasn't delivered until 10 minutes after I arrived. The server stated that she didn't see me, even though there were only two other customers besides myself. Anyway, I put my order in and 45 minutes passed. I'd asked well before then where my food was, and they'd said that they were preparing it. At the 45 minute mark, I got up and asked for the third or fourth time \"where is my food?\" I was informed that they hadn't gotten to it yet! They make everything to order, first-come, first-serve. Meaning, whether you come in and dine or call in, you're queued the same. I don't know if this depends on the hour of the day, but at the time I was struck dumb. I was there for almost an hour only to be told that my food wouldn't be done until 30min. later!

I really like hot food and to me their level 5 is not hot at all however with the ht sauce you get at the table you can definitely kick it up.

It's totally worth the drive. The food was stupendous and it also met my thai litmus test of looks. I firmly believe that if it isn't a sort of a dive then it's probably not going to be a very good Thai restaraunt. Still a mystery as to why but experience has shown that this is true across the US. Anyways, I had the Crab Delight app and Chicken curry entree and it was phenomenal. The appetizer came with 6 so I took some home for a snack later which tasted just as good the second time.

We walked in the most recent visit on a very busy Sunday night. We decided to order take-out and unfortunately our wait was still 25-30 minutes thanks to the huge line of customers and full restaurant. If I had one suggestion, it's order ahead for pick-up. We got an order or Pad Khee Mao and Massaman Curry which lasted two full meals and was very satisfying. The Massaman Curry is a bold, deep-flavored mixture of (chicken for us) carrots, potatoes, and other yummy curry veggies over a bed of white rice. We order 2* hot which isn't too spicy for the normal palette. The Pad Khee Mao is definitely my favorite version of it in town. The noodles were as plentiful as they were flavorful and they didn't skimp on the chicken, peppers, or basil which make the dish for me! I really enjoyed this and was so happy to have a massive box of leftovers for lunch the next day.Pros:Great food and good quality thai choices made fresh. The value is awesome, especially their lunch deals. I usually get one of their lunches and split that with my fiancee, which is plenty. Cons:The decor leave something to be desired. You walk in to a trailer and everything is cramped in and chaotic. To go to the restroom, you have to go by a kitchen with lots of hot dishes coming out the door. Sometimes the service could be a bit more accommodating as well.Overall: This is great Thai food but just order take-out ahead of time if you're going to go.

Both curries were oddly sweet and flavorless at the same time. I realize that neither of these are a spicy dish, but the sauces were as sweet as ice cream. I expected the chicken and veg to have a sweet flavor as well, but they were completely tasteless. I don't even understand how that could happen. Oh, and the potatoes in the Massamun were undercooked.For food I'd give it three stars. It wasn't terrible but certainly not good, but the service knocks it down another star.Short version; the woman I ordered from didn't know the menu, forgot about my order, and argued with me that I need to pay after I already had.

After parking in the worn lot, taking a quick glance at the run-down \"building\", yet seeing business diners walk in, we thought--hey, this place is legit!We were asked to seat ourselves and given large menus. Having a tough time deciding between a few options, we decided to dine family-style with three large entrees: Chicken Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Dried Cry Duck. All the dishes came out very fresh and hot. The Pad Thai, delivered first, was my personal favorite and the only dish completely devoured at the table. I am not a fan of ordering Pad Thai because the perfect Pad Thai, with the perfect seasoning, taste, and texture seems rather difficult to achieve and far too many times I've ended up with a plate of greasy mushy noodles mixed with soggy beansprouts. The Pad Thai at Thai Phooket is probably one of the best I've ever had. It was the perfect combination of all the ingredients Pad Thai should be, balanced with flavor, and not once overwhelming. As if that weren't enough, the larger order is served with a cute spring roll on a bed of dry cabbage slaw. The Green Curry comes in second, bursting with an explosion of tasty flavors. It doesn't measure up to the Pad Thai--and really, how could it? However, it is very delicious and every vegetable in the curry is incredibly fresh. My only qualm is the curry was very, very light and watery, so although it tasted great, we were left with a few slices of chicken and a few pieces of veggies soaking in nearly a cup of \"soup\". My least favorite was the Dried Cry Duck. At $17.95, it is one of the more expensive options of the menu, and we were forewarned it would take much longer to prepare. When it arrived at our table, it was a heaping plate of duck atop a bed of steamed vegetables, topped with unusually large fried wonton strips and garnished with an large orange twist. The care and detail that went into the presentation of the Pad Thai seems to have been completely lost on the duck. Nevertheless, we eat. The duck is quite salty compared to the rest of the dishes. It was boneless, but very fatty although the top layer was crispy. The most annoying thing about the duck is that it was very dry and at times hard to eat without the sauce, which was now seeping in with the watery vegetables. I've had many extraordinary Thai duck dishes and unfortunately this one definitely doesn't measure up.Overall, the food is good--must try the Pad Thai and skip the duck; I'm sure there are better things out there!"], ["Cliff M.", "My wife and I love this place!!!! \u00a0We were introduced to them through a friend and this place instantly became our favorite Thai place in Nashville. \u00a0If you want excellent Thai, eat here!!!"], ["Landon B.", "Highly recommend it!

We ate the F-2 which was beef Pad Kra Prao. This dish was ok for me but my bf seemed to enjoy it more! We also had the F-5 which is beef pad ginger. I personally love because there's so much veggies that I absolutely love. We also had the masssaman curry which was really good. I would highly recommend this to anyone and would order it again. Basil muscles were good to, lots of veggies also I'm the dish! 2 days later we decided to order Siam pad Thai again, simply because we wanted to try the original salads that we wanted. We had the Lao mango salad. It was pretty good. My bf is Laos and he said it wasn't to bad. We also ordered the beef salad....it lacked I'm a little flavor but it was ok. We also ordered two appetizers, chicken wings and fried meatballs. They were very dry and overcook. Looked like they were just refried...they weren't fresh at all. A little disappointing on that.

Being reasonably new to the area and having countless dining options in the area, I'm not sure we would have known of this place otherwise. When we presented the coupon we were informed that management had changed and they would only give us 15% towards our coupon. \"They just couldn't afford to lose that much money to us\" is what our server informed us. That's where I felt extreme irritation, we are a family of 5, they HONOR a coupon worth maybe $8 and gain a lifetime customer seems like a win/win for everyone in my opinion. We now have a good idea of managements attitude and if this is an establishment we would like to support. (Also-they request your coupon to be turned in and I'm curious, since the coupon states buy one get one-what do they claim on their taxes at the end of the year for write offs...just a thought)In discussing this with a neighbor later in the evening, the same thing happened to them and because the server failed to mention it to them the management informed him the server would have to pay for it!! Yikes.Back to the service during our experience, there was one server for the entire restaurant on a Saturday night. It was a full house. Our drinks set empty most of the time and when I accidentally knocked over my soup, I cleaned it up myself and (shocker!!!) was never offered a courtesy refill.Honestly, I'm shocked that this place has such wonderful reviews based on our less than pleasant experience on Saturday night.I hope they will think it over, suck it up and do the right thing.

I got the Tom Kha Gai (Chicken coconut soup) and Chicken Satay. The soup was good. The broth was the best part. The chicken was weird. I don't know how to describe it really. It was translucent and just tasted weird... The chicken satay was so-so. The chicken was much better quality than the chicken that was used in the coconut soup, but it wasn't incredibly impressive and the peanut sauce was so-so too. My husband got the Tiger Tear salad and Chicken Sanibel. As soon as the Tiger Tear salad hit the table, the scent almost made me throw up. I can't think of a polite way to put this, but it literally smelled like poop. It was disgusting. My husband took a few bites but couldn't stomach it. The smell was unbearable, and the beef was almost raw. I had to ask the server to take it off the table before I could begin to eat my food. The Chicken Sanibel made up for it though. Oh, it was sooooo good. I ate a bunch of it off my husband's plate. The chicken was cooked perfectly and so tender. The sauce was the perfect sweet spicy blended goodness, and I found myself trying to eat every single grain of rice that was left on the plate. I would definitely come back here again.

The fried rice was also underwhelming. I'd say the saving grace here is the stir-fry; good sauces and nice vegetables make that section of the menu your best bet.One more thing: the head waitress is nice enough but has a very bizarre manner of speaking.

I eat lots and lots of it in New Orleans, so when I got back to Nashville I figured I'd give it a go. I ordered take out from Lemongrass and will not be doing that again. First, the soup was simply not good; actually it was bad! I had the Tom Gai with chicken and the broth had nothing in it except what looked like a few pieces of boiled chicken and maybe 4 mushrooms. There was nothing else AT ALL in the broth. No vegetables, no herbs, nothing. Which might not be a problem if the broth was delicious, but it wasn't! It almost tasted like it had come from some sort of paste; like a soup starter. I threw it out! The spring rolls were great. I don't think you can actually mess up a spring roll... The Bangkok rolls were good too (like a chicken egg roll), but at $6, I'd pass because they aren't that good. For an entree' I ordered pad thai and also some pork lo mein for my mom. The pad thai was flavorless. I ordered it spicy and it was spicy, but that's it. It only tasted like tamarind and was just simply not good... Super super bland. Will not be ordering that again either. Finally, the pork lo mein was the best thing that we ordered and even it was just okay. I will not be eating at Lemon Grass again. Instead, I will look for a better Thai option."], ["David O.", "An interesting mix of Thai and Japanese cuisine. The menu seems to be split in two with the first part being the Thai and the second part being the Sushi/Japanese dishes. There was a mild language barrier with our waiter who had to return a few times to ask questions he failed to ask the first time (how would you like that cooked, would you like the chicken or the beef, etc.) but despite that, the food was quite good. My biggest complaint is that the Coca-Cola is not fountain, they simply bring a 16.9 oz bottle to your table with a glass of Ice. But the Teriyaki Steak I got was delicious. We also sampled some the Sushi which was good as well."], ["Sasha T.", "I really want to give Lemongrass 4 stars...but I can't just yet.They have great Thai food!

Its taken anywhere between 10-15 minutes after being seated to have our order taken and even took us 30 minutes once or twice to get the check...while there were only a few other customers in the restaurant. While they take their time in that department they will randomly rush by and take your plate up while you're still trying to eat. Thats a big problem with me. Don't mess with me and my spring rolls until I'm done eating them thank you.The only other negative for me is they have bottled soda but if you order ice tea you get unlimited refills...that bothers me a bit but to my husband who can drink a 12 pack of soda per meal that makes him think twice before we come here.Things run smoothly when the owner is there but when he's absent is when the service is a little lacking.I still think everyone should try the food here if they haven't, its very good.

My sister and I have eaten Thai food for years and have probably been to every Thai place in Nashville, so we really do know good Thai, and this isn't it! \u00a0Even though there were maybe 8-10 other diners there, we felt rushed to order even though we had only taken about 10 minutes to look over the extensive menu. The manager or owner stood in front of the food prep area and stared sternly at all the diners, never smiling, kinda creepy. \u00a0The spring rolls tasted like the cabbage was rancid. They brought me the wrong food, which is fine, that happens, no problem. My sister began eating hers and the noodles were glistening with grease and cooked to the point of being mushy. Her sauce had very little flavor, almost like it was watered down, and the cook was too stingy with the spices, but she didn't send it back, she was nice and simply asked for some rice to eat with it so she could avoid the noodles. After 20 minutes, my order arrived and the chicken was almost raw. When I bit into it, my jaw literally bounced back open it was so undercooked. \u00a0I told the stern guy about it, and he actually \u00a0said \"You cannot keep sending back plates of food!\" WE HAD NOT SENT ANYTHING BACK. My sister had merely asked for some rice, kept her plate and tried to make do! So I told him, that I wouldn't have to send my food back if the chicken hadn't been nearly raw. It was such a horrible experience, he spoke so rudely to us, and my sister and I are truly nice, affable people who are respecting of others.

We started with a meatless Mee Krob, which seemed too sweet and a little blah considering the $6.95 price. \u00a0I ordered the Panang curry with tofu (nicely prepared) and the chef substituted a veggie medley instead of peppers at my request. Medium spicy was at the perfect temp of lips burning without nose running. The fella ordered the Pad Woonsen and finished the entire noodley dish with no complaints. Both entrees were served with \"just enough\" rice molded into cute shapes. The dinner prices were reasonable, though I'll probably go back for lunch specials.

I called the restaurant to speak to a manager to make a complaint about the amount of shrimp that I received in my order but instead of assisting me and acknowledging the issue, the manager proceeded to tell me that it was \"impossible\" for there to have only been 2 shrimp. Despite my attempts to explain to her that I had in fact counted and confirmed the existence of only 2 shrimp, she denied the possibility that more had not been included. She essentially called me a liar and refused to admit any fault. I live down the street from the restaurant and I have been there on several occasions.

They have a spice range level from 1-5 but we ended up getting a 3 which is not a medium spice level, but the spicy level where your tongue is burning and you need to sip down some water every time you take a bite of the salad!! I recommend the papaya salad definitely!I ordered the large pho.

We used a new app called Favor to deliver the food. We ordered the following rolls, avocado, crunchy shrimp, crunchy crab, spicy tuna, tuna, & salmon & avocado. I liked the tuna, it was a large piece used in \u00a0the roll. I noticed that they are a little stingy with the avocado. There wasn't much of it in the avocado roll or the salmon & avocado roll. The spicy tuna was minced tuna, I prefer when it's a piece that is marinated in the spicy sauce. It also could use a little more spice. The crunchy crab & shrimp was a mistake to get as a to go roll because the panko crumbs were chewy, not the restaurants fault though.

The place is located kind of weirdly on the side of a building tucked behind some construction at the moment, but the hanging banners and frankly - ginormous - sign along the main street only just prevented me from turning early and getting lost. (Lost is kind of my forte).In any case, we were seated quickly and got our drinks. There was great happiness at the table when we discovered the lunch menu on the back page - huge portions still and a great lunch price tag! The options were only slightly pared down from the dinner menu, too so it still took us a while to decide.We ended up sharing an appetizer plate for the table and I got the Basil Noodles lunch portion as my main - spicy level 4 out of 5 - very hot. Per norm, we were treated to the yummy little broth soup that comes out to whet your appetite shortly after we ordered. Our appetizer platter came out fairly promptly after that and was plenty for the table of five even though it was two spring rolls and four dumplings. The chicken was moist and flavorful and he sauces that came out with the appetizer platter were very yummy with one sweet and spicy and another peanut butter-y goodness. We hadn't gotten to the point where hunger means you actually finish off the full appetizer platter before our main dishes came out. I really liked my spicy noodles - they were the perfect spicy level I'd expect when I ask for four out of five - flush to the face, slight sniffles start up and red lips can feel the capsicum. Mmm...I think the decor is a little cheesy, but neon lights aren't really my thing and it wasn't offensive at all - one big plus for dinners is that they didn't overcrowd the middle floor tables and (bonus!) their bathrooms were super clean. Overall, service was great, the place is well-laid out to feel like you can have a nice time here and not feel packed in or rushed - even if it had been busy - and the food was very tasty and a good value - especially lunch!

Its hard to find a good thai place in the South (period)... but Orchid does a pretty \u00a0excellent job.

Its interior decorating is rather unoriginal and tacky2. Its menu is ridiculous.

There was barely any chicken or veggies I it either- very noodle heavy. I did love that it wasn't weighed down in oil though like some places.The spring rolls weren't anything special, now was the gyoza. The apps seemed a bit high priced. The meals and sushi seemed standard.

There was only 1 server for the entire place! We waited, and waited, and waited before our drink orders where even taken. Then we waited some more to actually get the drinks. Finally we placed our food orders, and couldn't wait to eat our yummy meals. We had heard mixed reviews about Royal Thai, but we know they were voted \"Best Thai\" by the Nashville Scene. The service may have been slow, but we were fully expecting the food to make up for it. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! 5 out of our 8 (including me) ordered the Pad Thai and we were all agreed that it was the WORST Pad Thai ever. It basically was a heaping pile of brown mush...not to mention I had ordered mine medium-hot and there wasn't even an ounce of spice in it! The price was way too high as well. Not to mention that we had to ask our server 3 TIMES FOR OUR CHECK!

Best Kee Mao in town! Get it \"native thai hot\" (if you can handle it). They pretty much have great everything though. I would also recommend the red or green curry.

If your food is not spicy enough, then adding some of those peppers will change that in a hurry. The place looks completely ghetto on the outside but it actually has a pretty decent interior.

Siam.Sigh. I've tried. Really. My friends love it here and I'm not a picky eater, so I tag along. Maybe it's because I usually go at lunch and we usually end up getting something from the buffet. In which case, I feel like a two-star \"meh\" says it all. On the whole, I love Thai food, but this buffet is your standard Asian fare per mall food courts. You know the kind: glazey, breaded chicken... sometimes sprinkled with sesame seeds; fried rice; soupy broccoli with chunks of beef; chewy eggrolls. It's not the kind of food one should necessarily be excited about. Perhaps ordering from the menu is different. I'm kind of hoping it is.Also, lesson learned. No matter how delicious your friends tell you the Thai tea is, do not order it unless you can handle the sweetness in a 5lb bag of sugar. I couldn't finish mine and ended up wasting the $2.50.Free refills on soda though! There's a plus.As others have mentioned, the parking situation is EXTREMELY limited.

When I walked in there was no one at the register so the sushi guy asked me if I needed help and stopped rolling sushi to take my order. I ended up getting some steamed dumplings and fried rice, nothing too special but let me tell you it was delish! Most places here just dabble a drop of soy sauce on a bed rice and call it a day but this fried rice was actually flavorful. The dumplings were fresh, tender, and juicy, just perfect. On my second visit I ended up trying the sushi. I'm not a big fan of sushi but our rolls were made to order. The rolls were super fresh and light something that is essential for me when I eat sushi. The presentation was beautiful as well. The waitresses, sushi guys, and the manager are always nice.

I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that their food is good (although my dish - Sukho Fried Rice - was a bit bland). However, I was really bothered by their lack of service. I am NOT a tough customer, but I think this restaurant is terribly under staffed. They had 1 person (a lady) in the front of the house. She seated, served, bussed, rang up customers - she did it all... Sadly, she could not keep up and because she was clearly overwhelmed, her attitude was far from friendly.

I want to be clear: This is a fine Thai restaurant with traditional Thai dishes, and both the service and food were just fine. However, I guess I was expecting more after the hype, and I found it just to be a run of the mill Thai restaurant that happens to have a nice interior and friendly service. (Disclosure: I lived in the Thai area of NYC, and there are Thai restaurants with many more upscale and innovative menu options than this very typical Thai restaurant). Smiling Elephant in Nashville is one of the finest Thai restaurants I've experienced, and this one pales in comparison if you're looking for something beyond Pad Thai, curry and fried rice.We enjoyed the curry with broccoli, onions and chicken in thick curry sauce that had a peanut flavor (Panaeng), and the fried rice with broccoli, jalape\u00f1o and chicken. I enjoyed both dishes, with a slight preference for the latter because it was unusual.One suggestion: Be careful about the spice here if you're sensitive to spicy food. Mild here has spice already, so a choice of a 3 out 5 will certainly provide you with plenty of heat, and a 4-5 might just be almost unbearable for many diners. We chose a 3, and some of our food was almost too hot for our palate --and we both love spicy food. If I were to return, I would choose a 2 level.All in all, a solid option for Thai food in Nashville. It's just nothing extraordinary or memorable.

Yep, I said it! I have dined in only once, usually I call for take out, but everything here is just so good. The flavors are amazing, and take your toughest spice lover here cause they don't mess around with the heat. If you are unsure, just try the mild and build up from there. To give you an idea, I love spicy food and I have to tell them between medium and hot. They are a popular place and I think that is largely because they are meeting an ethnic food demand in the area (have ya tried to eat at the Smiling Elephant with a big group?!). Keep that in mind if you want to dine in during prime dinner hours. You're gonna wait a bit. I've had to wait some for my take out order too, but usually not more than 10 minutes and I totally give them a break for that since they are typically slammed when I'm hungry. I always thought I was a green curry kind of gal, but they have turned me into a red one. Their red curry with chicken is fantastic. Like noodles? They can make it as a soup too! Want some wide noodles? Try the Malaysian style noodle. Or the Paneang curry is out of this world as well. I will say that their Pad Thai isn't quite my favorite, but I think that is because it's my least favorite Thai dish. Their cocktails are also delicious and Thai inspired. The Lychee martini is really good and a nice palate cleanser after you've scarfed down a belly full of spicy food.

We were delivered our meals within 10 minutes of ordering, both prepared to our liking. The flavor of the pad see we was quite delicious - chewy noodles, rich sauce, crispy but a little chewy beef. The red curry was good - but not fabulous. I am in love with spicy red curry, but I like my curries to be a little thicker (not like paste thick) but not watery. This was watery but still had coconut flavor, fresh vegetables and was made thai spicy. It was really good, but not the best curry in Nashville. We didnt see the server again from the here's your check to the 'can we please have our check now'. Also, their air conditioning was down. We sat in the booth and it was incredibly hot.

Certainly, it seems to be perpetually inhabited by devout followers who laugh when Thai Phooket gets nominated as the best Thai food in town. Well, the Smiling Elephant may be the best Thai in the immediate neighborhood (more or less by default), but I am not yet sold on this place's allegedly exaltation-worthy status.One thing that bugs me right off the bat: the price range. Given the neighborhood and the dishes, everything is expensive: not alert-the-media pricy, but about $2-3 over for every item. Is this for some enhanced quality relative to other Thai dining establishments? Not that I can tell. The assortment of vegetables in my fried rice was pretty mundane. However, I do acknowledge that the flavors/spices were assembled well (although the dish was just a tad dry).A solid (if slightly pricy) dining establishment? Sure. But I don't think the label \"best Thai in Nashville\" is fair to what this city has to offer elsewhere."], ["Lynn O.", "Decided to come out and try it after reading rave reviews online and am sad to say that it did not live up to it's hype at all! The place itself is very quaint and the staff are so incredibly friendly and it really makes me wish that I'd liked the food more. Having said that, the restaurant was quite cramped and I found myself squeezed between a wall and another patron, which was not fun.Onto the food, my friend and I ordered three things to share:Fresh Rolls - These come out immediately because they've been pre-prepared and are just chilling in a little glass case. I was disappointed that they didn't come with any shrimp or pork filling and they were just stuffed with bean sprouts. This is a personal thing, but I hate bean sprouts! And they cost $4! Definitely not worth it.Pad Thai with Shrimp - Ah, the famous pad thai. I've been to Thailand on numerous occasions as my family lives in Malaysia currently and I've had pad thai dishes in Bangkok and Phuket a number of times so I had high expectations for this particular dish. But it really didn't deliver. It's very obviously stated on the menu that this was going to be \"authentic\" and \"not-Americanized\" but compared to actual pad thai that I've had in Thailand, this is not authentic by any means. It is quite bland and filled with bean sprouts to the point where it has me questioning the $18 price tag. Also the bean noodles are so weird texturally and they don't soak up flavor as well as rice noodles would have. The dish was just so whatever. There's no other way to describe it. It's not good but I wouldn't say it's horrible. It's just whatever. It doesn't do anything for me.Green Curry with Chicken - This dish was again, bland and very diluted. I didn't get hit with a mouthful of intense flavor or spices or anything. It was just very milky and the rice on the side was a bit dry and clumpy. The best thing about the dish was that it was filled with beautiful, colorful, crisp vegetables. But the curry itself just wasn't as good as I'd hoped.I really don't think that I'll be coming back here again. It is so overpriced for such bland food and in my opinion, incredibly overhyped. I know Thai food quite well. I've traveled to Bangkok twice and to Phuket every year since I was 12 years old. Thai food is supposed to be flavorful and rich and spicy and this place was not any of that at all."], ["Alisha S.", "Oh..My...God!!!So delicious.

Whenever I have friends come to Nashville from out of town i almost always take them here and I always recommend this place to my clients. However, as a regular customer that brings this place a lot of business, I was very offended by what happened today. My husband and I met my mother-in-law here for lunch and soon after receiving our check the owner came over to our table and asked us if we were done. ( We were still finishing up our teas, digesting, and catching up with each other so we hadn't laid down our card yet.) \u00a0The owner said \"if your done, can you give us the table?\" so RUDE!

Had our tiny table not already been overflowing with food, I would've ordered Panang Curry, which was their 'Curry of the Day' \u00a0Fyi - We dined on a Saturday night. Overall the food was very tasty. Although the place is famous for their 'non-Americanized' Pad Thai, the Thai Fried Rice w/Lump Crab was the true star of the night. \u00a0The entree was truly overflowing with Lump Crab. \u00a0I mean it seriously came with TONS of crab. \u00a0It was really delish. \u00a0I also liked that the Pad Kra Pao came with a fried egg - I thought it was a unique touch that I'd not experienced in a 'basil chicken' dish before. \u00a0Plus, it was darn tasty. \u00a0My Mom wasn't crazy about the fried egg component.

Though we had to squeeze past tables to get to our own, we had plenty of room at our table and I didn't feel like we'd been packed in like sardines.The menu said their pad thai was nothing like the crappy, sticky, sweet American version, which I detest, so I figured I'd better give it a go. I ordered the tofu-only version in spicy form, and it delivered. I can't claim to really know Thai food, but this pad thai was fantastic in my book. It was spicy, perfectly fishy, and flavorful. And the noodles were cut to a perfect size, greatly facilitating the plate-to-mouth-with-chopsticks maneuver, something I'd always quietly wished for but never had received. I had to beg myself to save half the meal in anticipation of my family's Christmas feast, but had no large fooding events been on the horizon, I would have happily inhaled the entire plate. The place was extremely busy and it wasn't clear to me how many servers were on the floor, but ours was rather lackadaisical in his approach.

The pad see-ew was, to me, as simple as it gets. \u00a0the seafood hot pot was my heavily biased favorite but that's because it was that all in one dish paired with Tom Yum. The whole place with its eclectic wood-every-damn where decor gives off a hipster feel... but to me seems appropriate for Nashville, which has a funny spin on the strangest things at times. I prefer to eat at off-peak hours so the two and a half parking spaces never really bothered me (actually there are more than 2.5...but not many) and I'm sure that there's at least 10% of the reviewers who will swear their grandma could cook these guys unto a coma but I don't... and if I did, I'd be at nana's house right now. \u00a0In other words, try the Smiling Elephant out. \u00a0You can argue on authenticity all day, but taste is everything else that matters. \u00a0Smiling Elephant is a divergent take on Thai in a 100mi radius worth the wait."], ["Ali S.", "I really enjoyed my experience here. \u00a0They had a great pad Thai and red curry chicken.

I settled on...drumroll please...sushi and Thai.On the sushi side of the menu, the portions are substantial. The hunks of tuna on the nigiri were gynormous, and the rolls are similarly large--although the speciality rolls have speciality prices. I got a spicy tuna roll and found it to be an average value for the price.For my Thai food, I tried a cup of the tom kha soup, which was OK but not spectacular. If Koi management is reading this, you definitely need more galangal and kaffir lime leaves in the soup to make it more authentic. I also ordered the pad kra prow (basil chicken) and asked for it to be prepared 5/5 spicy, and while I personally would have liked it spicier, I think what I got is at the upper end of most people's tolerances. The flavor was reasonably decent, too, and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.Koi loses a point for authenticity. I find that to be common at many of the \"hybrid\" Thai/sushi places.

Inside was bubbling sauce, shrimp, squid, mussels and glass noodles. They also brought a huge plate of steamed rice, which I wanted them to take back, but the g-parents said to leave it. Why, God. After I demolished the entire thing, there was curry sauce left (and it was the best curry I've ever had), so I ended up dumping all of the rice in it and finishing that, too. I f*ckin' hate it when they bring rice and noodles... I CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH THAT SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY. Regardless of my lack of self control, everything was absolutely delicious. Then, when I was on the verge of not-so-spontaneously combusting, they brought out dessert. Five adorable little egg rolls filled with steaming plantain, drizzled with honey and sesame seeds.

The texture was pretty off-putting, the shell bit revolting and the taste was bland and slightly unpleasant.  My entree, a massaman curry, was much better. The waitress asked me if I wanted extra vegetables, which was thoughtful and really improved the dish. The curry was rich and creamy and the medium spice level was just right.

I'm not a fan of the soup... I usually tell them to hold it and get an extra spring roll."], ["Scott D.", "Thai food in Nashville is a bit difficult to come by. There are choices. Some are better than the rest. This place is possibly one of the tastiest in town. The menu is just the right size and has all the Thai staples from curries to pad thai. Their list of Siam Specialties is must try if you are going to splurge a bit for the evening. The only point of contention that I can muster would be that the service is a little slow in ending the meal. I've waited a while before to be brought a requested check."], ["Sunny Y.", "Siam Cuisine and Thai Phooket are my go-to places for Thai food.I think the food is about the same in quality (depending on the dish, one place may be slightly better than the other) but the ambiance is much more elegant at Siam Cuisine.I always get the pad thai. My favorite. It's very good. The green curry is good too. And the tom yum. Also, I've tried ordering pu pat pong curry off the menu once. They were kind enough to take the order! And it was delicious!"], ["Steph H.", "Lots of people complain about the lack of decent Chinese food in Nashville. I have frequently added my own voice to the mix, but I do think the same concern could also be voiced about Thai food in this town. Yes, there are quite a few places claiming to serve Thai food, but most of them have pretty much the exact same menus and the authenticity of the food is questionable. Even worse, most of the Thai places in town charge an arm and a leg so dinner for two is generally going to cost you.I am not sure that Siam Cuisine really does anything to address any of the above concerns, but I'd still call this one of my top Nashville Thai places because by and large, the food is really quite tasty. I wish that dining here didn't so often set my husband and I back about $50 when we eat in (due to the cost of drinks + tip on top of our food), but the end result is simply that we don't eat here nearly as often as we otherwise would. I think a large reason why the prices here are high is because we often like to order dishes off their \"Specialty\" section (in particular, we love the crispy duck, duck curry, and the kang curry gai, the latter being a mild curry that I've never found anywhere else and that has a broth that is pure ambrosia!) which tend to be pricier because all of the dishes in this section are served with soup, salad, and a dessert. A lot of time I wish they'd knock $3-4 off the pricetag and just serve me the main dish. I guess I should ask if it's possible for them to do so, but it seems a shame they don't have some easy pricing in their menu that does that already.As for the food itself, it's generally decent, while some of it is very good. The curries are creamy and rich, and the duck is some of the best preparation I've ever had! The real flops are the free soup that comes with your meal, that may not come from a can, but is so generic and blah it might as well. I also really love Tom Kha Gai, and I recently ordered a big bowl of it for my dinner alone. The serving was huge (I got enough for two meals!), but unfortunately the flavors weren't there. TKG is so amazingly flavorful, but what I was served had no zing or zip and was instead pretty bland, and I don't even want to talk about the mangy pieces of chicken in it. So if you're a soup lover, maybe go elsewhere.Overall, this isn't going to be the best Thai food you ever eat, but the food is generally very good and the waitstaff is courteous and effective. The atmosphere has always been pretty chill and quiet whenever I've been, but I'd imagine this place is pretty busy at lunch. Calls for pick-up are fast too, as I generally only have to wait 15 - 20 minutes after placing my order before my food is ready. If you're craving a decent Thai experience, check this place out."], ["Hayley T.", "I went here for the first time today during my lunch break since, I never had Thai food and it was the closest restaurant in walking distances from my school/job. I ordered by phone and told the lady exactly what I wanted, which was the Pineapple Fried rice that was suppose to cost $12.95 on the menu, but I got there it was $17 something dollars o_O when I got back to work and opened the bag and there were extra things in there that I didn't ask for like soup, salad, and this mini looking egg roll things that where covered in honey, that didn't taste good at all. But the Pineapple Fried rice was really delicious, it had chicken, shrimp, pineapples and raisin in it, which had me a a little confused, because when I went to the website with the menu, it said nothing about raisins being in it, but it did mention it had cashews, and there wasn't a cashew in sight =/ I probably won't be going here anytime soon.menuism.com/restaurants/\u2026"], ["David R.", "Awesome food.Had authentic Thai spicy and it was delicious."], ["Michael W.", "Meh.Passable Thai food at astronomical prices.

Your request is like asking for no Russian dressing on your reuben or hold the chili on that chili dog please. That they did not honor your request could possibly be in your stupid little head. I eat their pad thai all the time with the fish sauce, and it doesn't even taste remotely fishy. Jesus. Stefanie: What did you order? A CHINESE DISH! GOOD LORD! Yes, they serve a variety of dishes to try to appeal to everybody. Ignore the chinese dishes and get the Thai stuff for maximum flavor. Let's be clear about what sort of place this is. It is a small Thai restaurant run by a Thai lady. The ladies in the kitchen vary all the time, and I don't think they adhere to standard recipes. Some ladies like it salty, others more spicy, etc. I prefer it when the owner cooks my food, but what can you do. She's usually manning the cash register. So it is a bit inconsistent at times. Dining in is usually a safer bet. This is a great place to chow down on the cheap, but you have to know what to order. Anything thai is delicious, especially if you ask for it \"Thai-style.\" This ramps up the heat and usually the care the ladies put into the dishes. Basil Chicken thai style is awesome, with lots of thai basil and a fried egg on top. Pad Thai is a bit pedestrian, but it does the job, especially with lots of condiments on them. They keep condiment trays in their fridge, and they can add a lot of excitement to any dish. Peanuts, sugar, chili flakes, hot sauce and these little pickled pepper bits that will blow your tongue off. \u00a0I mean, really hot man. Watch out for those.

Tom Yum is well-flavored and very tart, which I like, but might be too much for some people.For $5-$8, you will get quite a large entree that ends up being two meals for me.
