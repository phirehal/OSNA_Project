You are my new friend and my new home. We must get to know one another better.

Honestly, if she still likes you by then, you're probably past the point where choosing a bad restaurant could cause catastrophic failure anyways. It does indeed look like it used to be a fast food joint, both inside and out. That's ok, most of my favorite restaurants rely on their food, not the glitz and glamour of the building. (After all, it's what's on the inside that counts, right?)I opted for the Gyro Salad. Im not a \"salad guy\" per se, however I had just been on the road for the past couple weeks stuffing my gut with every processed meat, cheese, and saturated fat various southeastern drive-through towns could offer up, so I wanted something a little lighter. The servings were substantial with several strips of seasoned lamb laid out across a leafy salad bed alongside their significant other, the requiste gyro flat bread. Tzatziki sauce worked its way into every bite, tying together the tasty, inexpensive experience. Good food and new friends in a new place always make for a memorable occasion. The people working the joint recognized my roommate, even making an effort to say hello and goodbye. Familiar faces get familiar smiles and that's a bonus worthy of my fourth star.

My wife ordered a veggie gyro with no sauce or sides and I ordered a chicken gyro. We also ordered the hummus appetizer. The nonsense started when my wife saw there was pesto on her gyro and she requested no sides. The young lady that brought it out to us was new and very nice about the order and tried to explain that sides came with it. Fine. No problem. Then another young lady walks up with a very nasty attitude and appeared to be frustrated that we asked for no sauce or sides for my wife's order. After we acquiesced and said no big deal, the one with the attitude snatched the number from our table and walked off muttering something. I was obviously pissed but decided that it wasn't worth it. I took my wife's order back up and the manager redid the order with no problem. Then she brought it back out to us and really made it worth staying to finish our meal. I didn't mention the experience with the employee with the attitude. I'll let Yelp do the talking for me. The food here is actually great. My wife and I try eating healthy so this place fits the bill. But after this experience I won't be going back.

Fresh, relatively healthy, well-priced, and with plenty of gluten-free options. Back in my younger, care-free gluten-eating days, I was a giant fan of the chicken gyro; now that I am older and digestively weaker, I tend to lean towards their grilled chicken, which is always well-seasoned and tender. I am also a huge fan of their rice, which is slightly, but not overly, lemon-seasoned.

Maybe I was thrown off by expecting the food and prices of my run of the mill Greek places, but I thought it was a bit steep for what we received. The chicken was bland and the lamb was not shaved in strips like most Greek places. The lamb was just OK and I liked the dill sauce but overall it was lacking. I had the tomato cucumber salad on the side that was my favorite part of the meal because it was seasoned well. I also had potato chips on the side, which I found odd.

I love their platters that come with lamb (or your choice of meat), the BEST rice and fresh Greek salad. On this particular visit, I had the Greek entree-sized salad along with baba ganough and pita. The Greek salad consists of lettuce, diced cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, olives and sliced banana peppers with a Greek vinaigrette dressing. While I liked the baba ganough (first time trying it here), I will likely stick to their hummus in the future. Mediterranean Cuisine is wonderful for catering business lunches in the Brentwood area. Last fall, I had a team meeting and used them. I have a couple people on my team from the Mediterranean region, and they thought the food was authentic and delicious. They are also very reasonably priced, with lunches ranging from $5-$9 a person and offer plenty of vegetarian options. So forget that bland, boxed sandwich lunch for your meeting and go for variety! They are typically very busy during lunch, but don't leave if you see a long line waiting to order. The line moves very quickly, and there is usually plenty of seating inside and outside with tables turning over frequently.Also, for my order this week, I used the Eat24 Yelp app for the first time. I dug it! Very easy to place my order and pay for it, knowing I had a tight timeline between meetings and needed to be able to just run over and pick up my order without spending time in line. I'll be using this app more in the future!"], ["Leah L.", "That food was so damn good that it's not even right. I got the Mad Special Platter. It was beyond delicious.

Its a little joint in a strip mall of various restaurants and such. You walk in and order at the counter, we were able to walk right up and place our order. I ordered the Gyro platter, it came out promptly, including Lamb, rice, Tabbouleh, Hummus and pita bread. The Tabbouleh was very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. The hummus was pretty good as well, I've definitely had better but as a compliment to a meal I can't complain. The gyro meat itself was pretty uninspiring, it was good, but it kind of had the feel that it had been sitting in a warmer for a little while. The rice was your typical Gyro restaurant rice, nothing more nothing less. The Tzatziki was good, they kind of spice it up a little here, and I always like my gyro's drowning in it.Overall, I was pleased with the meal, the service was great, the employees were smiling, and the restaurant was clean. The food wasn't anything mind blowing, but definitely good enough for a return trip next time I'm in the mood for some Mediterranean fare.

Thirdly these people could not be nicer. I had an incredibly interesting conversation with the owner's wife, an Iranian family, who is as interesting as the food is amazing.I've been to Israel and Jordan, let me tell you this is straight out of the Middle East. The gyro is the closest I have come to a one I had in Israel. Full of flavor and they do not skim on the meat or fillings. Fries are crispy and delicious. Falafel is not dry and spiced to perfection.

The 6 or 7 people in queue went fast. Friendly older guy took my order of combo plate (rice, gyro meat, chicken, pita, Greek salad). Salad ingredients looked (and were) very fresh. I cringed at first that the meat was coming from a covered tin instead of being cooked fresh. (it was 1:30ish, who knows how long had it been there? Would it be dry?) Turns out the meat was very fresh. Gyro meat was especially tasty, just enough flavorful spice to eat on its own with frequent pauses to enjoy the taste. Chicken was safely tasteful, if not uneventful. Definitely fresh, tender, and a kind of BBQ moist (if that makes sense...all of that a plus) but the \"spices\" seemed to only color the meat, no burst of \u00a0yummy like its plate date, the gyro meat. Rice was perfectly cooked. Firm, moist, a hair more flavor than the chicken (although rice and chicken together made up for their individual blandiness). Pita was a warm, balance of fluffy and dense. Substance without being a brick, also fresh, which seems to be the running theme of the meal. Portions were big, and I only spent $8 for the combo and drink.

I like both of the restaurants, for different reasons.If I had to pick the best take out Greek in Nashville, it would be Chicago Style Gyros on Harding, but it is on the other side of town. Sam's is a close seconjd and much closer to the house. IN Bellevue, Sam's is the best take out, Athens (across the street) the best sit down.Most times I go into Sam's the owner is there, serving food. He greets everyone with a smile and makes you feel at home. The portions at Sam's are ample, perhaps even too much so. If you order the gyro platter, you get a large portion of rice, nearly completely hidden with gyro. It also comes with a side salad and you get to choose the toppings. I would personally skip the ranch dressing (homemade, nice) and go for the tzadziki (cucumber yoghurt -- yum).My favorite is to get a sampler. For a bit more, you can add gyro and you still get more than enough gyro to fill your stomach. The hummus is very nice and creamy. The dolmades are very nice. The falafel is decent enough, although I have had better (I still order from time to time). I am grab some of the spanikopita (spinach cheese and filo) from time to time.The best part of Sam's is the price value ratio. Even the sampler, with meat added anda \u00a0drink will run around $10, which is very reasonable for the amount of food."], ["Mark M.", "Gyro was a packed pita. As others have mentioned sauce seemed like ranch."], ["M R.", "I love Sam's! The gyros here remind me of the ones I had in Greece, made to order and stuffed full. The portions are huge, the gyro meat and chicken are always juicy and fresh. Falafel is good, I've had better, but only because it was fried a little hard for my taste, but I'm also not the biggest falafel fan in general. The hummus is silky smooth with a nice touch of olive oil on top. Stuffed grape leaves are magnificent and perfectly spiced. I always get the gyro platter or gyro salad, both 6.87+ tax. Both options provide enough food for 2 meals! Just as important to me as food quality is service and Sam's never disappoints. I've been a frequent customer (at least a couple times a month) for a few years now and it never fails that the owner already remembers my order when I step up to the counter. I even took my parents in once when they were visiting town (they're requested to go back several times now) they were new to Mediterranean food and \u00a0were unsure of what to order.

This place is also known as \"The Sauce\" because of the way the owner, taking his place behind the employee, will patiently instruct him in the fine art of adding sauce (i.e., tzatziki) into the pita gradually and mix the ingredients about two or three times during the preparation of the sandwich: \"Sauce.\" (Nods. A couple more ingredients.) \"Sauce.\" (A couple more ingredients are mixed in. An approving nod.) \"Sauce.\" etc. The service, to say the least, is friendly and attentive. However, it is advisable not to let one's guard down, or one will be persuaded to accept the \"homemade ranch\" instead of the tzatziki. It is not as good. If you don't want to bust your belly, it is possible to get a light snack here, too. In such cases, I like to get a couple warm, sliced pitas and the smallest-sized cup (about 4 or 6 oz.) of hummus with a little olive oil drizzled on top, and wash it down with an unsweet tea.

Upon arriving I was seated fairly quickly. I was struck by how noisy and how bright the place was. The atmosphere felt more akin to a fast food restaurant, and I would not recommend it if you wanted an intimate or relaxing dining experience. After I was seated, my server disappeared and I was left waiting almost 15 minutes at my table (even though the restaurant was not busy). The server who eventually visited my table was very friendly, which partially made up for the wait. I ordered the vegetarian Greek platter and an olives/hummus appetizer. The olives and hummus appetizer was tasty - the pita was warm and plump, the hummus was not special but good nonetheless, and for the price I thought it was a good deal.The vegetarian platter, however, left a lot to be desired. The moussaka was meh, ok, kind of tasted like some frozen gourmet meal. There was a small dish of vegetables in tomato sauce that I actually thought was quite tasty. The rice was a huge no - it tasted like the kind that comes pre-cooked in a bag. There was a cheesy potato side dish that was tasty - but then again, it was almost pure cheese, so hard to mess up. The portion was big - I had enough to take to work for lunch the next day.As a Bellevue resident, I'm glad to see this place here. The more variety of restaurants the better I say. If you go here, you will probably get something that tastes decent. You will probably not get something amazing though. The service is just ok, and the atmosphere is diner/fast food joint. I probably will not visit this place again. I'd rather visit someplace outside of Bellevue where for the same price the food is tastier, the service better, and the ambience cozier."], ["Annie S.", "I'm sitting here now and I feel so bad for our poor waitress. completely understaffed. she said it's always one person on the floor so it's not just a day where there was a no show. she's running the place by herself which is making for \u00a0poor service. Which is completely not her fault. The food was not very good. Soup was cold, thick and flavorless. It's supposed to be broth based lemon chicken soup. I couldn't taste the lemon at all. Pita bread was wonderful though. My gyro was fine I suppose, it had little meat and the taziki was just plain yogurt it seemed like. Nothing special though. the French fries were straight out of a freezer bag and into.the fryer.

They have a middle easter salad mix with cucumbers, tomatoes and onions, romaine lettuce, feta, cheddar, etc. They you can pick a sauce to top it with. I alternate between taziki and ranch. Both are homemade and awesome. The fries are your usually frozen ones topped with seasoned salt. They make them fresh for each order which is nice that they are hot and crispy. I haven't had any of the other sides.There is also a bakery in this location. They make custom cakes and always have a nice assortment of treats.

You go in, order at a counter and then get your own plastic silverware and napkins and pick a seat. The food is served on styrofoam plates and your drinks are served in styrofoam. This seems like laziness on the restaurant's part. There are no real waiters to speak of so if something is wrong, you have to take it back to the counter--where I've had to wait in line just to get a wrong order fixed.The food itself is okay. I'm not blown away by anything I've had on their menu. A couple of times I've ordered the hummus with pita bread, which is a big mistake. The hummus tastes about as fresh as the Athenos stuff in the supermarket and the pita bread is served cold. Why? It takes so little time to heat up pita bread. Yet another problem that just seems like laziness on the restaurant's part.Ultimately, \u00a0my biggest problem with Kalamata's is the fact that I can get the same meal on plates with real silverware and receive actual service at a couple other restaurants in Nashville for the same price.

Overflowing chicken gyro sandwich and baba ghanoush was plenty of food for two people (or one really hungry person).

Surprisingly, this is the only thing I have ever eaten here. Minus the occasional tomato basil soup if they have it. BUT, the salad is good enough to keep me coming back time and time again. I think it is the combination of the dressing and the garlic knot that comes with it. It's simply just fantastic. Yum. My boyfriend usually orders the combo kabob Greek salad, and he swears that the meat is some of the best cooked beef he's ever had in Nashville. I don't like meat on my salad, but I have gotten the chicken in the past, and it was really good. OH, and you can not leave without trying a baklava. Kalamata's is right in the heart of Green Hills right across the street from the mall. It's convenient and quick, unless you go at lunch and have to wait in a long line out the door. My one complaint is that the prices are a little high, but I gladly will pay a little more for food that is amazing every time."], ["David O.", "A bit awkward having never been there before knowing just want to do. bit the entirely laid back nature makes you feel at home right away. I was surprised to walk up to the counter, order.. get the food.. eat.. and then pay. We weren't even provided with a ticket to say what we had ordered, we simply recited it from memory. The remarkable effect of this is, it makes you feel like family. Sure, you could probably go in there and order something, and then not pay for it, but what would be the point? Why reward courtesy with crime? The friendly nature of the restaurant is second to none. The food, as it is, was good. While I can't speak to the legitimacy or authenticity of this Greek food, but I quite enjoyed it. The beverages are mostly bottled with some \"fountain\" teas. If you are looking for free refills on your coke, you'll be disappointed.

Let me explain. Known throughout many parts of the world as Asian Sea bass, barramundi is a fish species found throughout the Indo-West Pacific region from the Persian Gulf to China; as far north as India and as far south as Australia. It has a white, flaky flesh and buttery finish, and tasted absolutely delicious atop Kalamata's delectable Greek salad. Gyros and falafels are not my thing you see. So when I purposely drive across town to Kalamata's for lunch, I feast on one of their (almost) daily fish specials and always order their delicious hummus. Everything is made to order with fresh ingredients. The staff is always friendly, no matter how busy they may be and the food never disappoints.

The salad itself was picture perfect; everything was arranged so nicely I almost hated to disturb it. Piles of veggies, piles of feta cheese, and a pile of freshly grilled doner meat in the center. The greens were fresh and crisp, the meat was tender and delicious, and the olives & feta were quite olivey and fetaey, respectively. At first I thought it was a tad pricey for a salad, but it was well worth it. They absolutely did not skimp on the ingredients, and the portion is as large as it is delicious. Unless you're practically starving, you can plan on bringing some home with you.I also had their white bean soup, served with some sliced pita bread. The soup was absolutely fantastic with the perfect level of spicyness.

Alexander's, I'd say that this place has done a good job standing out with it's fresh, well-executed Middle Eastern fare.PROS: The falafels are hands-down some of the best I've ever had. They are made to order, i.e., you can watch each of your falafels hand-patted and deep-fried with TLC. The gyros are also quite good. And I thought the guys behind the counter were pretty friendly. (Of course, they're not the world's best conversationalists, but heck, they've got falafels to make.)CONS: This is not a place you go for ambiance, so don't go expecting that."], ["Jason S.", "Wow! This place is pretty great. The staff (I imagine they are the owners too) is super friendly. The food is fresh and can be healthy too. I whole heartily recommend the quail its very delicious. The gyros are great too, and well priced. Be sure to get some grape leaves (dolmas), and the falafel is amazing. I Highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!!!"], ["Sissy D.", "After a few more trips to this place I had to change my review. Umm..the food is ok and seems fresh, but the staff is very rude. The main guy is kinda ok, but his flunkies are total A**'holes. They treat women like 2nd class citizens. They cannot understand what you want even if you point at the menu, and cannot make change or run the register, but they laugh and make fun of you if you mispronounce something. They messed up my whole order (ordered chicken, I got lamb which I will not eat), and when the main guy got back we told him my order was wrong he said, \"ohh, well yes sorry\" and went on. No refund, no new order, nothing. Don't support these rude people, go somewhere else where they know how to treat customers."], ["James E.", "Cheap, Authentic and homely.There certainly isn't much of an atmosphere and you notice it in the price. \u00a0However, I feel at home with Al-Jazeera blaring over Mediterranean men arguing over how to cook my chicken and wrap my grape leaves.Check out their home-made Tzatziki sauce.....Tis the Bomb."], ["Robert K.", "Kebab is a Chipotle style Mediterranean place. \u00a0I have only had the Gyro here, which was decent, but nothing too outstanding. \u00a0The lamb was nothing special, but the veggies tasted fresh. \u00a0It had a bit of a manufactured taste to it, kind of how a McDonalds burger tastes nothing like a burger! \u00a0The pita it came on was pretty good, though. \u00a0Also, my friend ordered a Falafel platter that was really good. \u00a0This is probably a good lunch place, but I \u00a0don't know if I would come here for dinner. \u00a0It is cheap, too!"]], "Kebab Gyros and Pita Bar": [["Calonda G.", "The food was really delicious and fast sufficient service. I was here on a business trip but plan on coming back with my family."], ["Bridget D.", "I've eaten at this place twice now. \u00a0First time I got the Falafel, which was pretty good. (I've had way better, but what do you expect in Nashville?) This time I got a salad. List price for the most basic house salad:$6.95. \u00a0Kinda pricey for lettuce and tomatoes, but I chose to add a protein to it and that raised it $2.95 higher. (It said it came with Kalamata olives. \u00a0They piled it high with black olives instead. blah. The taste of the food, otherwise, was good. \u00a0That is the only reason I came back.The gentleman who worked the assembly line to make my salad was Mr. GrumpyPants. \u00a0He never once looked me in the eye, nor did he raise his voice above mumble-level. \u00a0When I didn't hear one of his under-the-breath questions he got snippy with me. \u00a0\"Tabbouleh, YES.OR.NO...\" still never above a mumble. The gentlewoman behind the register, \u00a0Mrs. I-Have-No-Craps-To-Give, also had the inability to look customers in the face and spoke in a disinterested monotone usually only reserved to DMV employees. Sad.When I go to a restaurant, I like to be made to feel like I am a valued customer. Thank you for choosing our restaurant, ma'am, we hope you'll come back. \u00a0This one has made me feel like I was preventing the staff from having their Union Nap. \u00a0I probably won't be back. P.S. Turn on the AC!"], ["Lisa G.", "The food is NOT good enough for the price they charged me 9.97 for chicken and hummus with a side of cheese...when did the Greek spot start charging extra for feta???"], ["Tyler B.", "I came here for a Spanish Language and Culture Meetup group. Pros:1. It was quiet and there was a large table so we could all speak together and hear each other well. 2. It was clean. 3. Prices are good.Cons:1. It was FREEZING. I was literally shivering it was so cold. 2. My salad was kinda blah. It didn't have much flavor. 2. The only dressings they have are balsamic vinaigrette, ranch and Taziki sauce. I got the balsamic and Taziki, and they were very bland. The Taziki sauce was nothing like Taziki sauce. It tasted more like watered down ranch. I'd come here again if the group meets here again, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here on my own."], ["Linda B.", "The food is excellent and the staff have always been friendly. \u00a0Even when the line is long, they keep it moving quickly. \u00a0Brought my 18-month old here recently and she even enjoyed the gyro and hummus!"], ["Robert B.", "Anyone rating this place with less than 5 stars is eating the wrong thing, or needs to get their taste-buds checked out by a licensed Orthodontist! \u00a0This place hands down has the best Gyro's I've ever had...EVER. \u00a0I get a chicken gyro, with rice, tomato, onion, and lettuce, with some of that white ranch sauce.... CAN YOU SAY HEAVEN ON EARTH??? I've had Gyro sandwiches in many many states, and none can compare! I've been eating at this place well over 20 years... This place is a Nashville landmark. The fact that this place is able to stay in business for so many years in a DEAD location, next to an ABANDONED MALL shows that they have EXCELLENT FOOD that keeps people coming back!"], ["Debbie R.", "The food was good, the place seemed clean and the people were nice enough.I didn't like having to stand in line to pay with everyone else when I had called the order in. I also think I was overcharged. The menu board said $6.95, but she rang up $7.90. They were busy and I was in a hurry so I didn't hassle it. It's a nice change from the fast food around here, so I will go there again."], ["Courtney B.", "Hands down the best Greek food in Nashville. Lots of healthly options, not just your typical rice, meat, bread, ranch dressing kinda place. I usually get the greek salad with chicken or the chicken platter. The food is very fresh."], ["Suzie R.", "This is one of my go-to places in Nashville. I used to work around the corner and came here multiple times a week. Falafel is awesome, the tabbouleh is tastier than everywhere and that white sauce is ridiculous! I almost want to tell people not to come here because I don't want it overrun by tourists!"], ["Bruno S.", "There are a few Kebab Gyro's on here so hopefully this is the right location. \u00a0I'm not overall familiar with Nashville but we found this hole in the wall while driving in the downtown area. There is limited seating on not much of an atmosphere, and it looks like the locals were mostly sitting down for a quick lunch.Parking was hard to find so I ended up just pulling in and getting our food to-go. They had a good variety on their menu but yes it was mostly cafeteria style service. Definitely not a restaurant/dining in environment. \u00a0But I didn't mind it, actually was looking for somewhere quick.The FOOD: I ordered the gyro and it was delicious. Not your typical gyro. They cut the top of the pita bread and \"stuff\" the bread with meat and fillings of your choice. This was the best Gyro I've had in the South and beats a lot of them up North.This place is busy during lunch time and would not recommend eat-in. It is family owned and they were very friendly.I will definitely eat here again and do recommend it to anyone looking for a good Gyro."], ["Karen T.", "Looks can be deceiving, I didn't think this place would be that great based on the location and the looks from the outside, but the marinated chicken platter I had over rice pilaf and house salad was good, and a good deal for the amount of food.Good sign that there was a pretty good line of people from surrounding businesses; you know if the locals like a place, it is usually a good sign. The people were friendly and patient and make sure your order is correct."], ["Nickie G.", "So now that I work at MetroCenter it has come to my attention that there are a paucity of decent restaurants to try in the area. \u00a0In order to avoid fast food we went to Kebab Gyros. \u00a0It is located in a strip of places that includes Neely's BBQ - which smelled so freakin delicious I almost never made it into Kebab.So this place has no atmosphere whatsoever, so don't expect much in that respect. \u00a0Just a bunch of tables where people with limited time to eat can sit and grub down really quickly. \u00a0Also, the trashcans needed to be emptied and there were a ton of gnats flying around them. \u00a0Ew. \u00a0So don't expect it to be very clean either. \u00a0That being said...on to the food!So there will be a line at lunch time but it moves quickly so don't let that run you away (if the gnats haven't already ran you away, that is). \u00a0The menu includes gyro or chicken pitas, platters that include gyros, chicken, or combinations + rice and tabbouleh, or platters where you choose two specialty items (like hummus, greek orzo, tabbouleh, chickpea salad, etc). \u00a0They also have salad offerings. \u00a0I got the gyros platter. \u00a0The meat was plentiful and was pretty decent. \u00a0Liked the yogurt sauce to dip it in and the pita they served on the side was soft and fresh (might have been store bought, not sure, but was still good). \u00a0Price was $8ish for the platter plus a drink. \u00a0And drinks are serve yourself which is good because you can refill right before you leave to get some afternoon caffeine. \u00a0AND it is a Coke establishment so you don't have to drink crappy Pepsi instead. \u00a0Service is fast and efficient - no time for friendliness or banter here.Try Kebab Gyros if you are in the neighborhood and are looking for something different than the usual fast food!"], ["Janet S.", "Sit down place by the lake in Metro Center, outdoor patio, plenty of seating indoors, cafeteria style food. \u00a0Platters, sandwiches, wraps, \u00a0No better No worse than any of its type in Nashville, just simply getting away with it (sigh), beef/lamb mixed together, could not taste the difference, horrible tasteless rice, and the classic watered down ranch, chick pea salad was soggy. \u00a0Had no expectation and none were met. \u00a0$12 for lunch. \u00a0The possee I was with thought it was great."], ["C R.", "Good spot for a quick lunch in an area without many sit down restaurants. Good, not great, Mediterranean fare. Fresh ingredients and friendly people. You can get out for less than $10."]]}
