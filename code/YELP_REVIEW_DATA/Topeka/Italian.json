It just kinda worked out that I was in the shopping center and wanted to eat. The other restraints seemed more expensive than I wanted at the time and wings sounded pretty good. When I walked in I instantly liked the decor. Nothing overly fancy but it's got a nice pizzeria vibe. Obviously my wife and I ordered the wings and they were even better than they sounded!!! The wings were made to perfection! Sweet and not too hot cause my wife can't take it too crazy. The dance was also really good! We have ordered from them several times since and it is always great! The pizza is also great! It's Brooklyn style but not overly greasy like you come to expect. They also have some remarkably good pastas including one dish with stuffed egg plant. All of them are amazing especially for a place where you would normally get pizza!My best experience with them came about a year after my first visit. We ordered delivery and after 50 minutes nothing had come. We called into the store and they told us it was on the way. Well 30 minutes later we still had no food. We called again because it was the first time we had even had a late delivery from them. Turns out the drivers car had broken down and they had to send someone out to get the food from him. They apologized for the delay and refunded our money without being asked too. I think that shows remarkable service and made us very happy patrons. We will be back as often as possible!Go with these folks and you'll be treated well and fantastically fed!"], ["Chris S.", "I was here last Autumn with a friend for a calzone, which was actually pretty well done, so I decided to try it again with my Sicilian-born wife. For a city of nearly 100,000, it is appalling that Lawrence does not have a single decent. authentic Italian restaurant. A Carrabba's would even be a breath of fresh air, but the tight-knit city \"powers that be\" seem to be pretty good at discouraging innovation and \"chains\" in favor of \"mom and pop\" establishments. Unfortunately, none of the moms and pops seem to have a clue how to run a decent restaurant, Italian or otherwise. Anyway, all that being said, Morningstar's is not bad.We tried the garlic knots ($3) which came with a side of red sauce. Baked balls of pizza dough infused with garlic apparently, I could barely taste the garlic and the \"knots\" were not baked long enough, a little too chewy ... too bad!The prices are decent except for the pizzas which are a bit pricey, so my wife ordered The New Yorker calzone ($7.25) with mozzarella, ricotta & parmigiana cheese, no sauce (she is allergic to tomatoes - some Italian!), with mushrooms added ($.50 extra). She was quite happy with the calzone. The dough was baked to perfection and there were just enough ingredients, so my wife (who has lived in Naples, Italy - the home of the best pizza in the World - most of her life) was actually impressed. Bravo!I wanted to try a few different things, so I got the Jumbo Combo ($9.75) which came with chicken parmigiana, eggplant rollatine, stuffed pasta shells, a side of spaghetti, and a meatball. I asked for the baked manicotti instead of the stuffed shells and they were happy to comply. Unfortunately, when my dish arrived I was a bit dismayed to see everything crammed into a casserole dish. The chicken parmigiana was actually cubes of breaded chicken piled on one end of the dish and the manicotti and eggplant rollatine were on the other end, layered one on top of the other. The whole dish was covered with sauce and mozzarella cheese, then baked in the oven. The side of spaghetti was not well drained, so it was a bit too watery. Too bad because the sauce was decent. With no meatball in sight, I asked the server where it was, but she said the dish did not come with one. After informing her that the menu indicated that a meatball did come with the dish, she scurried off and brought me one post haste. In all, the dish was a bit of a mess, but it was actually not that bad. It could have been better presented and would have been much more palatable had the chicken, manicotti, and eggplant been separated on a large plate, but with a name like Morningstar you cannot expect authentic Italian dishes.Alas, still no authentic Italian food in Lawrence, but Morningstar's does a fair job of trying. Their prices are fair and the service is decent, but it looks more like a sports bar than an Italian restaurant. The old world ambience just is not there. As Morningstar's would say: \"fuggedaboudit\", but not just yet. We will likely be back because my wife liked the calzone (as did I on my first visit), so maybe I will try one of their sandwiches next time. I would also offer suggestions for improvement if invited because I will do ANYTHING to help a local business as well as my chances of having a decent Italian restaurant meal without having to drive 4o miles.

More Bombs Are Better!"], ["Sam A.", "Great surprise from strip mall pizza! \u00a0Ordered a combo pizza and garlic knots. Both were great. Knots were only $3 (and we got 9 of them!!). That'll be a go to snack. Next time I'm there I'll get a meatball sandwich. It was beautiful. This place needs another location not in a strip mall"], ["Zach G.", "I really did not expect to like Morningstar's too much. As a Chicagoan, I'm bred to hate NYC pizza. However, Morningstars NYC pizza...well, it isn't quite NYC pizza. First and foremost, they have a menu that consists of pizza, sandwiches, and some other ods and ends. They also offer slices...perhaps all day, in fact. I don't remember seeing something about slices being lunch-only, which is the case at many places. The slices, and the pizzas too, are offered Sicilian Style (thicker, about 1\") and Neapolitan Style (thin crisp cracker crust). For my lunch, Neapolitan slice with sausage, pepperoncini and garlic. The plain cheese slice is $2.50, and each ingredient is $0.50 extra, so my slice was $4.00. It came out fairly quickly. The sausage was the sliced kind and was flavorful enough. The pepperoncini's were not very spicy, which was a bit of a bummer. The garlic was...uh...applied very liberally. I'll be tasting it for years to come. But my love of garlic approves of this. Just beware. The crust was crispy and, as previously mentioned, cannot really be folded like NYC pizza. All in all, I would say it's a cross between NYC pizza and Neapolitan pizza. The only negative with the custom slices isn't limited to Morningstar's - because they're put on over the cheese, any little angle on the pizza allows some of the topping to slide off. In my case, many a pepperoncini ended up back on my plate. #FirstWorldProblems. Service was friendly and efficient, and the space is clean and comfortable. It does have an interesting setup in that you feel like it is a mixture of sit down and counter ordering. It can almost feel slightly confusing for the first few seconds you step in. If it says to seat yourself, just grab a spot and they'll bring you your menu, drink and cutlery. There are a few TVs along the wall. They also do have some bottled beers available (not sure about tap though). Quick, affordable, tasty. I will return for future lunches as it's also fairly near my office."], ["Tony T.", "This place is terrible!!! Do not waste your money on them! I ordered a slice of thin crust with pineapple, ham, jalape\u00f1o and the ham was literally torn pieces of lunch meat. (see photos) they couldn't even cut it with a knife!! The toppings are put on top of cold premade cheese pizza. They didn't even bother to reheat it so the toppings would be hot!!You are better off going to the grocery store and buying a one dollar jenos pizza than to waste money on this junk they try to pass off as pizza. Anyone that gave this place over 1 star rating is friends with the owners or the workers. I would give them a zero rating if it was allowed. If you don't even have enought pride in your product to cut the freaking ham with a knife instead of tearing it with your fingers then you shouldn't own a pizza joint. Sorry excuse for a pizza place. I hope they shut down after people realize they are being ripped off."], ["Terry M.", "What a great place, stopped in while in town picking up my son from Basketball Camp. Nice friendly place, the service was very good and our server was very nice. We met some family there since we were in town, split a couple different pizzas. The ingredients were very fresh and the crust was perfect.Do yourself a favor and stop by, you won't be sorry you did."], ["Scott T.", "Don't get it.Visited twice. Good enough to fill the belly without offending but the claim of New York style pizza quality? That's pretend land. Spend several weeks in New York City every year and this doesn't resemble the great pizza you can get there. Not in the ballpark, not close, missed first base. There's more to New York pizza than thin crust.First off, when you pick up a slice in the city the ingredients don't slide off the bread, which is precisely what happened to us twice. The pizza itself isn't bad, it just isn't New York style, and it's not crafted particularly well. I'd call it we-grew-up-on-Kansas-Pizza-Hut-and-think-this-is-what-New-York-Pizza-is.Pass."], ["Todd B.", "I am giving 2 stars because the experience really fits with \"meh. I've had better.\"The place was really clean. The service was good. The portion sizes were generous. Except for the large order of bread sticks wasn't very large. \u00a0The best part of whole experience had to be the marinara sauce.Never been to New York so couldn't tell you how this compares, but personally I'd rather have a wood-fired pizza."], ["Clarice W.", "I'm don't claim to be a NY style pizza connoisseur, but Morningstar's delivers some no-nonsense, no-frills, thin crust Neopolitan (for those of you even more newbie than me, read: Cheese) pizza that sure seemed authentic to me. Super crunchy crust, thin layers of sauce/cheese, and cut in a large wedge (about 9\" tip to crust), you've got to pick this baby up and fold it to ensure proper eating - which I believe is the \"correct,\" NY-way (please feel free to correct, true NYers).The garlic bread oozes with buttery grease, is heavily seasoned, and comes in a large portion (2 slices about 7\" long each). Stay away from it if you're here on a date - I fortunately was not and therefore was in carb heaven! I dig their marinara...watch it come straight out of a can or something, but that tartness perfectly complemented the garlicky goodness. When I couldn't finish the other half of my bread, our server gladly brought a to-go box for me, all ready with an extra cup of marinara in it. Bonus! I'm a sucker for these little details.On the down side, service is fairly slow and I can't boast about the quality of the cannoli; the filling isn't quite ricotta-y enough and is too heavy on the vanilla. I'm assuming this is what turned the color a displeasing beige instead of the clean, fluffy white I'm used to. The shell didn't taste that freshly-baked as advertised (it didn't crumble the way I'd like it to), but I'm nitpicking at this point. Morningstar's is, after all, a pizza joint. Sometimes you just crave simplicity and this stuff sure does it!"], ["David G.", "Lots of people claim to be \"New York\" pizza places but this is one of the few that delivers! \u00a0If you limit yourself to pizza here though you are missing half the fun.A certain degree of mysticism surrounds what is a New York pizza. \u00a0Is it the water? The cheese? The size? the oven? The sauce? \u00a0Yes, it's all of that and none of that. \u00a0You just know it when you taste it and you roll your eyes at imitators, just like when a midwesterner asks \"Why is it called an egg cream when it has no egg and no cream?\" and pronounce \"Houston\" like the city in Texas.When Morningstar first opened, I thought it was named after the stock report in what I thought was a clever tribute to Wall Street. \u00a0Alas, even though I live in Lawrence, I'm not a basketball fan and apparently this place is owned by a famous KU basketball family. \u00a0I was disappointed in what I thought would be quite the nod to New Yorkers!That is until I walked by and saw Drake's cake in the window. \u00a0Like a moth to a flame I was instantly drawn to the place. \u00a0I haven't had a Yodel since grade school. \u00a0Dad used to always keep them in the freezer and if I was really good I could have one. \u00a0For those midwesterners out there, Drake's is kinda like Dolly Madison or Hostess. \u00a0Except it's better because it's from the East Coast. \u00a0This was a smart move by the owners because unless you put a sign in Times Square, this was the best way to say \"Hey, we love New Yorkers\"When I walked in to decide what I'd eat before I ate my coffee cake and Yodel, I saw Wise potato chips. \u00a0Awwww. \u00a0That aqua green and yellow bag was part of my lunch box for so many years were about as valuable for trading during school lunches as cigarettes are at Riker's Island. \u00a0To top off that New York state of mind, they had Yoo-Hoo drink. \u00a0They didn't try to be a Jewish deli and have Doctor Browns or egg creams (again, use wiki to look it up and stop asking us New Yorkers about it. \u00a0Get some Fox's Ubet and experiment). \u00a0This place has all the trappings of a New York pizza parlour.Another authentic aspect of this place was a full Italian menu with calzones, lasagna, heroes (subs, grinders depending on where you are from). \u00a0Everything tasted as I remembered and nothing gourmet. \u00a0This is all about the basics and doing it right, though they do have gluten-free and dairy free cheeses. \u00a0I'd try some of these modern options, but I'd be afraid my New York taxi cab driving father would rise from the grave and tear up my birth certificate. \u00a0Although I haven't tried it yet, I hear the handmade cannoli is awesome. \u00a0I promise I'll try it but when they have Darke's Yodels and Coffee Cakes, I simply can't make it that far down on the menu. \u00a0No Italian ices though, which is a shame but makes sense since Marinos would melt coming all the way from Jamaica (and if you think the country not the borough you've got some more learning to do). \u00a0Maybe they can serve ice cream with a wooden spoon here and yellow cups and at least try and emulate that feel.What's missing here is the NY attitude, and that's a good thing. \u00a0The fact they accommodate a variety of dietary needs is a good sign. \u00a0No \"soup nazi\" here. \u00a0Everyone was friendly and helpful and generally interested in our enjoyment. \u00a0No paper plates and wax paper. \u00a0Real live silverware!Service was a bit slow, but that's ok because the murals and New York paraphernalia helps pass the time. \u00a0 It's important to note there is all Yankees memorabilia in this place. \u00a0The reason is simple: \u00a0the Mets suck. \u00a0All true New Yorkers know this fact. \u00a0Ok, I might be exaggerating since not everyone from the Big Apple has realized it yet. The Mets/Yankees rivalry makes Mizzou/KU rivalry look like a playground shouting match and I'm glad this place takes sides.The irony though is Jerry Seinfeld is a big Mets fan and the bathrooms have pictures of Seinfeld characters. \u00a0Ed Koch is too. \u00a0These flaws make them human. \u00a0Neither would eat in a place that so prominently displayed Yankees memorabilia. \u00a0That's their loss because they've got dozens to choose from in the five boroughs.For us, in Lawrence Kansas, Morningstar's NY pizza is the only true choice for those that can quote and remember the I \"heart\" New York commercials and had the goofy T-shirt. \u00a0 Native Lawrencians will really get a piece of the action here."], ["Christina J.", "Awesome delicious flavorful NY style pizza. \u00a0Foldable and excellent crust.

First the pizza took a good 45 min to come to the table. \u00a0 Our beer even took an unusual amount of time to come out. \u00a0 There were maybe 3-4 other tables there. \u00a0Some had already ordered one ordered after us. \u00a0 That's it. \u00a0This part is what bothered my husband the most. \u00a0 The employees were more busy chatting it up with another \"famous\" local who came in than taking orders and delivering food. \u00a0 We also didn't get our garlic knots in a timely manner because they \"forgot\" we had ordered them. \u00a0When they did come out my kids didn't want to eat them because they were so greasy and over seasoned. \u00a0The sauce tasted like it came out of a can. \u00a0They were very chewy as well (probably d/t grease).When the pizza finally came out. \u00a0It was just \"ok\" \u00a0My expectations are never high for a good NY pizza in the middle of KS but really this was below expectation. \u00a0I would say the only thing they can claim to be similar to NY pizza was the size. \u00a0The crust was too thick. \u00a0The sausage had an odd taste. \u00a0They didn't drown the pizza in sauce which was a plus. \u00a0 Would not waste a pizza night on this one. \u00a0I'd go to Tad's or JOHNNY\"S of all places for a better pizza. \u00a0 We wish we could have a place like Grimaldi's pizza in Brooklyn near by! \u00a0I know they were just getting started but the service was horrible. \u00a0 Starting with what I said about timeliness above. \u00a0Hopefully they have gotten this part down.

Three hostesses/wait staff and not a single one actually greeted us or asked us how many in our party. One took some menus and said \"follow me.\" Thankfully service improved after that. We explained we were newbies and after our drink order the manager came by and thanked us for choosing Old Chicago and presented us with two coupons for a future visit. Nice!Pizza took a while, but was quite good. Our kids pizza was a pretty good size and not lava like hot. Drinks were readily filled. Had to wait a while after finishing to see our server, but not overly long. Will more than likely be back!"], ["Kristie C.", "Clean, comfortable bar with decent appetizers. Lousy pizza.

First place earns you $50 chicago bucks which can easily pay your bar tab for the night."], ["Scott H.", "I travel 48 weeks a year and eat in all kinds of restaurants all over the US. This place has the worst service I have ever experienced - if you enjoy being treated like a leper, this is where you need to be."]], "Paisano's Ristorante": [["Tobias H.", "Definitely my favorite place to get Italian food from here in Topeka. It has the beautiful interior design of a major chain restaurant but still holds a charm that says locally owned. The breadsticks are vastly superior to Olive Gardens, and on a good night I even prefer their salad. A good menu and decent prices, and the diverse beer selection factor pushes this establishment over the edge. The main dish items are good, not the best Italian I've had but still worth the trip. If you're looking for a romantic place to take a date I'd recommend here, as well as if you're looking for a local restaurant to bring your family from out of town."], ["Sonia M.", "I'm going to assume we just had a poor experience here the day we went but...service and food were both awful!! Loved the ambiance! I think it was a coincidence that what we ordered was not good and our waiter was inappropriately defensive. Servers, not caring for the way our food came out is not a personal insult to you!!, Anyhow, I'll definitely go again and hope for a nicer experience. I think it's a place worth dining at for sure!! Pretty romantic vibe for a date night!!"], ["John K.", "My standby Italian place in Topeka, although both food and service can be somewhat spotty.Some nights the wait staff bugs you by checking on you too much. \u00a0Other times, you can't find a waiter when you need one. \u00a0But love the Sinatra tunes, the quiet booths and a great place for a romantic dinner.The foods is usually good, sometimes excellent. \u00a0I wasn't that impressed with their pizzas, but their lasagna and baked mostecolli is tasty. \u00a0 I usually order something not on their regular menu, which is linquine with pesto and topped with Italian sausage. \u00a0Some nights it is great, with fresh pesto, tasty olive oil and toasted pine nuts. \u00a0Other nights the pesto is swimming in oil, the basil not noticeable and the pine nuts either not present or processed into oblivion.Their salad is usually great, but I find their breadsticks a little to salty for my liking. \u00a0All in all, not a bad place, though \u00a0I haven't been to Olive Garden enough to compare (I detest chains and like to support the home-town places)."], ["Steve M.", "Not the best Italian restaurant that I have been to. Like one of the other reviewers had mentioned, this place is sort of like going to Olive Garden, but not as good as they are. To start with, their menu selection was great if you wanted to eat pasta or pizza. But if you are trying to eat light, and have a healthy meal, then you are going to have a tough time finding anything on the menu. The only non-pasta/pizza dish that was on the menu was the grilled Salmon which came with a side of vegetables. Since I wasn't very hungry, I went with the soup and salad combo. They had 2 soups on the menu, the special of the day which was the chicken tortellini soup, and the usual minestrone soup. I went with the minestrone soup which was tasty, but it seemed to be lacking something. I also felt that the salad was a little bland as well. The dressing just didn't seem to have that kick that I usually get from the other Italian restaurants. The service was good, we were greeted by the waiter when we sat down, he took our order, and the food arrived a short period later. Only complaint I had was that the waiter did not keep tabs on our table regularly, and I had to wait for him to come by so that I could get my cup refilled, or get a refill on my bowl of soup. Prices seemed a little high, but not too extreme. My soup and salad with a soda ran about $11. Overall, the place was good, but I would not put it at the top of my list if I were to go out for Italian again."], ["Kris S.", "The one word I think best describes Paisano's is consistent. I've eaten in both the Lawrence and Topeka locations and the food and service are always good but never great. But in this instance, it's fine because I don't expect much from the place. I consider it an independent version of Olive Garden.My chief complaint about the place is that they nickel and dime you when you split a meal and by forcing all at a table to chip in to cover the cost of the family-style salad, even if you really and truly won't be eating it."], ["Brian E.", "Good God. \u00a0I hate to say this, but Olive Garden has a better grasp on Italian food.Every dish that came to our table was smothered in cheese. \u00a0Just like in Italy...right, moron?"], ["Michael B.", "We ate Paisano's recently for a special occasion, and really came away somewhat ambivalent.The food was not bad. It was actually pretty good, but the service was poor at best. We ordered a bottle of wine, and when the server brought it to the table, it was in two glasses. I pointed out that we had ordered a bottle of wine, and the server's response was that 2 glasses is a bottle. I begged to differ, and she brought out an empty bottle and held up the wine glass and said, \"see, the wine glass is about half the size of the bottle. For the record the wine bottle was not the wine we ordered.After this exchange, the server sent another person to the table to drop off the check.I understand we are not at a 5 star restaurant, but most restaurants that are not out to screw the customer bring the bottle to the table, then pour it. I don't know if we got the wine we paid for, but it would be good practice to actually show the customer the bottle being opened and poured."], ["Sherri G.", "Very disappointing. Took a visitor from CA this weekend and her meal was burned. The waiter apologized and took it away. no replacement or attempt to remove the charge from our bill. When we spoke to the manager we mentioned the woman at the table next to ours ordered the same dish and her's looked completely different, like it should look. \u00a0he said he would go back to the kitchen and look at ours. That was the last we saw of him. Bad move, you just lost customers. We have too many other options and refuse to pay for bad food and unconcerned management again."], ["Jim O.", "Great local operated Italian. \u00a0Monday is all you can eat pasta for $9.99. \u00a0Includes bottomless salad and breadsticks."], ["John R.", "I am not a huge Italian fan, but the atmosphere was nice. \u00a0The food was good and the staff was courteous and on top of everything."], ["Precious P.", "Always good food and service! I get the pesto every visit! It's so good. This is my place for Italian."], ["Lydia L.", "Everything was excellent, their salads are first rate, and their freshly baked bread sticks are the best I've ever eaten, EXCEPT: we ordered the calamari fritta appetizer and it was some kind of faux calamari, not the real thing, not even shaped like the real thing and it wasn't crispy. This needs to be re-thought."], ["Gary S.", "I recently discovered this restaurant while in Topeka on business. \u00a0It is some of the best I have had. \u00a0If manners weren't important the guests would lick the bowls. Yum, yum one of my favorites!!"], ["Matthew A.", "Excellent meal had on New Year's day. The place was dead as would be expected on this day, except for our group and another large group. Everyone's food was very good. Mine was excellent. I had a baked Mostacolli which was probably the best i have ever had, though it could use a little more seasoning. My wife had asiago and spinach ravioli, which she said was very good as well. Paisano's provides large dinner salads for your table to share as well as unlimited breadsticks. Both of these are excellent. The house wine was not very good, I should have had a nicer variety. The service was excellent.

The lady there saw my kids were very cranky from a long day at a water park and not only brought them some pineapple over but also made them some cinnamon rolls. That helped a little bit.
