It's one of the few places in Lawrence that's nice but not too extravagant...a good first or second date venue. The food has never disappointed, but the portions you get have. If I could give them 4.5 stars, I would. It's a bit pricey for what you get...but overall, I highly recommend this place."], ["Sarah D.", "I've been twice to Merchant's. The first time, I was there for lunch with a friend. I had the Mac and Cheese and a salad, and she ordered a burger with a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was great - but the two highlights were the generous pile of delicious fries that came with the burger and the beautiful, golden brussel sprouts.It was the wonderful brussel sprouts that made me push my husband into going for dinner. I told him the fries were great and encouraged him to get them as his side. We ordered Soup of the Day (Crab chowder), he got a Sweet Potato Quinoa Burger and fries and I ordered cauliflower gratin and the aforementioned brussel sprouts. Things didn't start out that great, since our server was clearly completely ambivalent to our presence - preferring to tidy up other tables and chat with other staff members over taking our order.When the food arrived at the table, I was disappointed. The tiny handful of fries that came with his burger was nothing to write home about. Neither was the burger. My cauliflower gratin was bland and had several large stems. The brussel sprouts that had previously been so good were the worst of all. I could tell they were underdone - there was no golden brown exterior to these. When my husband tried to put a fork through one, it bounced off the table because it was too hard. We decided to say something our server, who brought them back to the kitchen. When they returned, they had the sickly-green cast of microwaved brussel sprouts. Seriously - these things were like something from a Green Giant frozen package that makes every child hate brussel sprouts. They were cooked enough to eat now... but uhhh.. pretty gross.So when our server reappeared to ask if we wanted a box, we said that the brussel sprouts hadn't survived the microwave. Her response was a disinterested, \"Oh really?\" She then asked \"So are you too full for dessert?\" I stared at the full plate of brussel sprouts - clearly, since I had not eaten half my meal, I was not too full for dessert, but I opted out nevertheless. She wandered off and returned with the bill. We felt awkward about asking for the inedible brussel sprouts to be removed from the bill at this point, so we just paid and left.My husband couldn't believe I recommended this place. I kept saying, \"I don't understand, it's like this is a completely different restaurant.\" Unfortunately, the second version of it was so terrible that it completely ruined my good first impression."], ["Clarice W.", "What's up with Lawrence replacing old classics (Teller's, Milton's...) with more swanky attempts?Came here for drinks on a Friday night; the crowd here is definitely older. Their signature cocktails are disappointing; I can think of several other places in KC and even in Lawrence where I've had better versions of similar drinks. The Sir Barnum sounded interesting (scotch, cream sherry, smoked salt rim) but was far too sweet and the salted rim did not meld well with the flavors. But most of all, it was so hard to get over how aesthetically unappealing the drink looked - it had chunks floating around in it. Please, bartenders, when working with cream liquers it is so crucial to think about how that cream is going to react with the other ingredients! No one wants to take a sip of chunky cocktail!!I didn't eat here but after seeing what they've done to the place, I can't say I want to. I don't like the open kitchen they've tried to create here - in a small space this works as a rustic reminder of farm-to-table style cooking, but in this large bank space it just looks messy. And for the record, I agree with previous Yelpers: this is no gastropub. It's a restaurant with a bar that has a decent variety of beers on tap. There is very little connection between the two.The one thing Merchant's has going for it is the space - even a paint job can't take away the historic feel of those high ceilings."], ["Anne H.", "We have eaten here multiple times and have always had a great experience!

Meatballs were good but the fries were saltier than the Dead Sea. And considering that I wasn't sober, it's gotta be REALLY salty. It was basically inedible...

The server was Rachel. \u00a0She provided excellent rapid service, but had not been adequately trained. \u00a0When she opened the wine bottle, she left the cork on the cork screw and then took them away. \u00a0Obviously she had not been told that she is supposed to remove the cork from the cork screw and leave the cork on the table.Another oddity is the need for a password for guest access to wifi. \u00a0Most restaurants do not require a password, if the restaurant has a separate guest wifi connection. \u00a0But at Merchants, both the secure and the guest connections require passwords. \u00a0When the restaurant is busy, it is a waste of the servers' time to have to find out and provide that password to customers who request it.I booked the reservations on Open Tables. \u00a0To my astonishment, I got a message from Open Tables (the day after we were there), saying that we had not been there, so would not get credit for the reservation. \u00a0Of course, I told the hostess that we had reservations, when we arrived. \u00a0In all the years I've been using Open Tables, I've never before had this happen to me. \u00a0 \u00a0I have better things to do with my time than having to deal with this kind of mistake by a restaurant. \u00a0Perhaps Merchants should send their hostesses back to school."], ["Farley D.", "I expected something different from Merchant's having read about it first. The night I was there was a night there was a basketball game on, so that may have affected the ambiance, but it was completely silent in there, as everyone was watching the game on television. We ordered through the bar, and the service was amiable, yet distant. They had great happy hour specials, and the menu was large, albeit rather plain. Bison bolognese was a let down, brussel sprout salad was plain, and the plowman's plate was skimpy--where they advertised 'meats' on it, all that came was one grilled sausage. Perhaps worth checking out if there's no other option."], ["Sandra W.", "Please do yourself a favor and go here. Try just about anything on the menu and you'll pretty much have to come back to try the rest.

This could be a huge oops for someone with serious celiac disease. This is something I wanted to mention early in my review because it's important for those who could have a serious reaction to know up front that there may be some level of risk involved in trusting this restaurant to deliver on their dietary restriction requirements.We started out our dinner with a couple of appetizers. \u00a0We had the rabbit sausage appetizer which was incredibly tasty and served with roasted tart cherries and yams. This was my favorite part of the meal. We also had the scallops which we really should have sent back. $14 dollars for three small scallops and they couldn't bother to rinse the sand off first? If you do not know how to prepare scallops, don't put them on the menu. Scallops should never ever be sandy. My stepfather had the angus steak which was a huge portion. He liked the flavor, but it was a very tough cut that was difficult for him to chew. \u00a0My mother had the chicken and she reported it was one of the best chicken dishes she had ever had. The hubby had a hamburger which he said was \"ok\" but it simply didn't hold a candle to his favorite burgers at Blanc or The Burger Stand. My bison dish was served with tiny bits of ground bison meat which was unexpected, and not in a good way. The overall flavor of the sauce was nice, but the dish didn't have enough sauce. The error noted above with serving wheat pasta was unappreciated. It was funny, because at the time, I was a bit shocked that the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente because gluten-free pasta usually doesn't have that perfect bite. Not much later that evening, I discovered that it wasn't gluten-free as ordered. Don't ask me why I know this.The decor is generally nice. I love the old bank building, but I'm not sure what the hell they did to the wall behind the bar. Is this supposed to be artistic? It just looks like a hideous mistake and detracts from the beauty of the space. Our waitress was very quiet in her demeanor and not terribly full of personality, but delivered the food relatively quickly and kept glasses refilled at a reasonable pace.This is one of those places that I think has some promise. I would never ever again order a dish here where I could be exposed to gluten. I don't trust them. I would never order their scallops again. If I happened to be in Downtown Lawrence and wanted a quick bite, I'd be willing to order the rabbit sausage app again. At the prices here, because the quality is such a mixed bag, it's really not worth it to me to come back and work my way through their menu."], ["Denette V.", "This is a really great place. More upscale than the name suggests, the chef does an excellent job in the execution of the dishes. Of the three of us, \u00a0we had their beef steak special, the wild mushroom loaf and the shrimp/chorizo /polenta dish. Fabulous! Each unique with complementary flavors that brought out the stars of each dish. I was raised eating quality beef and find most chefs fail to enhance the flavors of beef. Salt and pepper is all good steak really needs, but this chef kicked it up with a drizzle of chimi churri. Honestly I found the sauce more delightful with the roasted veggies the steak sat on because the seasoning and steak was that good. The other table favorite was the mushroom loaf with a luscious tomato gravy. This dish is just fabulous. The Spanish flare of the shrimp and chorizo dish was good and delightfully balanced. Wine list was interesting with many great pairing choices. Spirits and beers were quite interesting if one wanted that direction. \u00a0Dessert was unique and well executed as the mains.

Free State Brewery ... that is all I have heard since moving to Lawrence in August ... \"Free State Brewery\". \u00a0I have tasted some of their micro brews and they are excellent, but every time we wanted to try the food, the place was jam-packed. \u00a0Now I know why while at the same time wondering ... WHY?The place was full, but not packed, yet the noise-level was high. \u00a0After 20 years in the Air Force working around very loud jet engines, my hearing is not great and I had a hard time hearing my wife from across the small table. \u00a0Wood and glass dominate the large open room, the lighting not too bright and not dim, making the setting comfortable except for the decibel-level.Our server, a nice young man who never mentioned his name, arrived promptly to take our drink order. \u00a0I decided to go with one of two stouts ($4 for an American pint) on the menu, I tried the other later, a flavorful thick, rich chocolaty concoction that was complex, yet smooth. \u00a0The second, an oatmeal stout, was also very tasty and smooth with less complexity than the first, but it was delicious.I ordered the Brewery Burger medium-well with cheddar cheese, figuring a brew pub would have a top-notch burger, especially at $8.25 \"without cheese\". \u00a0The menu states that it is a \"1/3-pound patty of Kansas pride, Creekstone Farms seasoned premium charbroiled ground beef on an onion bun, slice of onion, leaf of lettuce and a pickle spear. Hot fries stand ready to complete the feast.\" Adding Provolone, Blue, Swiss, Jack or Cheddar cheese is an extra 55\u00a2, bringing the price to nearly $9. When our order arrived, I was shocked by the size of the hamburger and not in a good way. \u00a0The plate was dominated by overcooked French fries that sat upon a single flaccid piece of wilted lettuce, NO ONION, and a small dill pickle spear hidden under the fries, leaving the small onion roll containing the meat and cheese. \u00a0That was it, a beef patty the size of a McDonalds \u00bc-pounder and cheese, no mayo, no catsup, no tomato, NO TASTE! \u00a0First of all, the beef patty was medium or medium-rare, pink throughout and NOT medium-well as I had ordered. \u00a0I added some catsup out of the bottle and rather than ask for some tomato or onion, deciding to eat it as is and thinking that maybe they knew something I did not ... that it should be eaten this way, it should not!Based on value, this was one of the worst hamburgers I have ever eaten ... and people wait outside in the rain and cold for this? \u00a0Five Guy's burgers, at less than $6, are eons better than this sad excuse for a hamburger and even (dare I say it?) Burger King's Whopper is tastier, cheaper, and COMES WITH ONION AND TOMATO!My wife had the Gorgonzola and Mushroom Gnocchi - $9.95 - consisting of Shiitake and button mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with julienne red onions, then simmered in a creamy Gorgonzola white wine sauce with fresh made potato gnocchi and finished with sliced black mission figs, local micro greens and toasted rosemary focaccia. \u00a0Her dish was attractive and flavorful enough, except for the fact that the red onions had not only been caramelized, they had been burnt. \u00a0The burnt onion flavor overwhelmed the otherwise tasty, creamy Gorgonzola and white wine sauce which had just the right amount of the strong cheese which can be overpowering if not done correctly. \u00a0The gnocchi were cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too firm, making the dish a decent value except for the fact that the burnt onions ruined it. \u00a0For $10, a side salad would be nice considering the fact that sandwiches come with a choice of potato or salad, but that is not the case.I honestly have no idea why this place is so popular other than the fact that it may have become \"the place to be seen\" by the local college crowd, the same folks that give Chipotle 4 out of 5 stars on Yelp. \u00a0The beer was very good, the food extremely disappointing. \u00a0I live 7 blocks away and wouldn't make a special trip. Their beer is good, but not a huge selection. The food is boring and pretentious. Those who like TO BE SEEN, \"hipsters\" et al, probably enjoy it. Not me.Based on our experience and the few available options on the menu, I doubt if we will be back except to have a beer, but based on the size of the bar and the usual crowds, I also doubt if it will be worth the wait.

Because of that, I cannot comment on other appetizers- that salad cannot be passed up! Delicious avocados and shredded parmesan cheese, tiny pasta shells, tomatoes-- just awesome. Also, their veggie burger is probably the best I have had anywhere, crispy and oaty and sinfully delicious. I have not personally ordered any desserts, but my boyfriend has liked any dessert he has tried. That's not easy to do, because he is a dessert snob! They have a text ahead function, which is very helpful because there is always a wait. No matter when you go, there is ALWAYS a wait.

We got there at the perfect time and didn't have to wait to be seated (typically there's at least a five to ten minute wait for lunch or dinner if you arrive during the rush; it's a very popular place) and they gave us a nice quiet corner booth up on the balcony overlooking the entrance. \u00a0It didn't stay quiet for long, unfortunately; that place reverberates sound like no other, so it's not a great place for a quiet dinner if that's what you're looking for. \u00a0The noise level actually made it very difficult to hear our server, who didn't speak very loudly. \u00a0He was a nice young man, but volume, son; it's important.Pricewise, it's not a bad place for its quality. \u00a0My entree was about $10, and my friend's steak dinner was about $20, so there's a fairly large range in what you might end up spending. \u00a0Drink prices are pretty average. I thought the hummus appetizer was just a touch more expensive than it should have been, but it was also delicious, so the complaints stopped there.Finally, we get to the main dish. \u00a0It was brought out pretty much as we were finishing our hummus, so their timing was impeccable there. \u00a0My friend said the steak and mashed potatoes (with what I believe was oatmeal stout gravy) were pretty awesome, but I have to tell you about the Gorgonzola mushroom gnocchi.Holy cow, that was the best thing I've ever eaten. \u00a0The Gorgonzola sauce was rich and creamy and was perfectly complemented with sweet dried fig and microgreens (I don't really know what microgreens are, but they added a beautifully contrasting crunch to the dish). \u00a0The gnocchi was soft and fresh and the sauteed mushrooms and onions in the dish were pleasant and not overpowering in any way. \u00a0If you have never been to Free State, especially if you're a vegetarian, do yourself a favor and get the Gorgonzola mushroom gnocchi. \u00a0It's the only dish I've ever eaten that prompted me to send my compliments to the chef AND write a Yelp review."], ["Ines S.", "This place not only has great food and beer, they also try to use as much local produce, meat, and bread.

Don't eat here real often, but enjoy an occasional visit and the food and service is always consistent.Happy to report I couldn't detect a change in the food at all which is what attracts its return customers. Same good grub, not high dining mind you and who'd want that out of a place that has rice and beans as their base food in most everything? Hell no, this is south of the border comfort food. It's not central American, it's not South American, it's sort of a combination. It's a solid good meal and a rice bowl is a lot of food for the price if you eat the chips and salsa that come with it.Our most recent visit we had the shrimp & salmon rice bowl and my companion the pork rice bowl. Delicious, plenty left over for carry-out. Packed with onions, green and red peppers and lots of juicy savory rice and meat.Only change is the new digs are a bit fancier but I don't see that being a problem. Waiter/waitress service was good and no delays for the meal. Little has changed it appears, just more room and finally a restaurant for this beautiful space (built originally for a high-end place called Prairie Fire that lasted a year or so) and then went through several painful other attempts.

The stuffed \"arrepas\" a and \"yuca frita\" are great starter alternatives. If you like Cuban food or Puertorican food this is the closest thing you'll have in Lawrence.

(Side note: It is odd that a town like Lawrence does not have a straight-up vegetarian/vegan restaurant.) \u00a0I suppose we figured that it could not be any worse than the first time, and might even be better, and oh boy, were we so very wrong. \u00a0I ordered the Vegan Corn & Roasted Red Bell Pepper Rice Bowl, and was surprised to find that it was actually in stock this time. \u00a0My girlfriend ordered the Locally Made Organic Tofu Rice Bowl after our waitress checked with the kitchen to make sure that it was vegan, which she assured us it was as long the arepa sauce was omitted. \u00a0What was served to us was basically low-grade cafeteria food. In my dish the rice was stale and had clearly been cooked hours before hand, the corn and peas appeared to be rehydrated vegetables (also, what were peas even doing in this dish?). \u00a0This place claims to be a \"Latin American\" restaurant, so where were the diced tomatoes or cilantro for garnish? \u00a0Seriously, there was not a single fresh vegetable on my plate, and this place has the gall to call it a \"vegan\" bowl. \u00a0As bad as my dish was, my girlfriend caught the worst of it with her bowl. \u00a0I am putting restaurants on notice right now, if you are going to offer a tofu dish on your menu, learn how to cook tofu first; you wouldn't just throw raw pork or chicken into a bowl and call it good, so why would you do this with a protein substitute like tofu? \u00a0The tofu was uncooked/raw, which basically means it was a gelatinous mush of cube shapes on stale rice with peas (once again, WTF are peas even doing here?), and some kind of zucchini that had been cooked into oblivion and drenched in butter (no doubt about it this time). \u00a0She took three bites and was done, and we were both done with this place for good. \u00a0By the way, this place claims on its menu to be the \"Home of the Original Rice Bowl,\" whatever the hell that means."], ["Ed C.", "I've been meaning to try this place for years.

I've been two times since then and am really glad that I gave it a third chance!! (something I don't think most people realize is that restaurants are run by human beings, humans who have off days and who make mistakes, and not everything is always going to go exactly how you want it, and you really shouldn't judge a restaurant's service by going there only one time... off soapbox).The last two times I've gotten the salmon and shrimp rice bowl with Oaxacan rice. Absolutely delicious!! I love the little tiny salad shrimp. I couldn't believe how much salmon was in it, and was actually disappointed that there wasn't as much rice! It comes with a pineapple salsa that's really awesome. Although the corn cake they gave on the side was room temperature and left something to be desired.The portabello and goat cheese chimichangas are also really divine. Oooozzing with cheeeessseeee. MMM!!We got the queso dip appetizer and I couldn't tell if it was \"real\" cheese or melted 'cheese food product'. It had characteristics of both which makes me think it might be a mix?

I would say the quality of food was about the same as Chipotle but you have to wait much longer for it to get in your belly. The Carnitas lacked the depth of flavor good Carnitas have and the vegetables were decently prepared. The chips were a bit stale and the salsa a tad runny. The coffee was ok. Overall this place is nothing out of the ordinary and you should not expect more than a standard Latin American restaurant. If you're in a hurry you can get the same quality of food much faster and cheaper at the Chipotle down Mass Street."], ["Jaymie J.", "This is the second time my husband and I have been here. Both times the service has been horrible. Tonight we got sat and it was 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order and another 10 minutes before they took our food order.

Hell, I was once called out on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn by a girl who used to work the counter at La Parrilla. She may have even shouted out my regular order, too. If any of you want, you too can call me tofu bowl. I won't mind.Anyway... there's been ch-ch-ch changes... my first time to La Parilla since the change to full table service. Normally, I'd say such a change is for the better, as I prefer full table service to ordering from a counter and then trying to find a seat. But I'm slightly sad about my recent experience, and I guess I'm missing how it used to be.The positives:I love what they did with the decor! The bar is really lovely and the environment is much more inviting. I love seeing giant jars filled with things pickling and fermenting. And I prefer ordering from a menu to squinting with my lousy eyes to see a menu board so far away.When the K and I arrived the other night, the gal who greeted us seemed disgruntled. It's OK, we all have bad days, but it's hard to deal with such a first impression, even if you know you've been in her position before (I worked years in the service industry. I can relate, girl, but yeah, first impressions and all!) She seated us at the bar, while there were several two tops available. I just don't get why you'd seat a couple at the bar, but maybe that's just a me thing (I dislike sitting at a bar unless I'm alone. Reminds me of sitting at a diner counter or something. Ok, really, this must be just a me thing, come to think of it). If we weren't in such a rush, I would have asked for a table.So, you know that I lovvvvvve me that tofu rice bowl. As in, adore. So many times in Latin/Mexican restaurants, healthy options are scare and everything seems loaded with cheese and creamy things. I'm not made of stone, it's hard to resist and I usually end up feeling gross afterward (especially if I can't control my chip consumption prior to the entree's arrival). I will always be appreciative to La Parilla for having the rice bowl portion of the menu, because these are healthy and do not come with cheese (yay for vegans!)But, they were out of tofu. Ok, it's cool, restaurants run out of things and I'd never lower a star for that. After a lot of hemming and hawing, I ordered a grilled veg bowl. There is one other veg rice bowl option, corn and roasted red peppers. I hate bell peppers, so that was out. The waitress checked and sure enough the grilled veg bowl also has bell peppers and since it's pre-mixed, you can't leave 'em out. I figured I'd pick them out. I don't mind a bit of the flavor, I just can't consume them without feeling sick for the rest of the night. Verdict: it was OK--beans were tasty, rice was bland (one of the rice options isn't vegetarian, I think, so the rice is just a plain white rice with peas and carrots). The squash was quite bitter and the only other vegetables were the damn bell peppers and onions (which I also don't like in stir fry), so I ate about 1/4 of it. Luckily I poured a ton of habanero sauce on the whole shebang, because otherwise the dish would have been just too bland.Our waitress was really nice throughout our visit (same girl who greeted us unenthusiastically) and offered to wrap it up, but I figured why bother wasting to go containers on something I'd throw out anyway. I won't say that I wouldn't return, as I've had too many good experiences here. The menu is really creative and I probably should have just opted for something else, when told about the ingredients in the veg bowl. For now, I leave this review as a reminder to myself and others who also shun bland food (and bell peppers :)And my mouth *still* waters at the thought of that amazing habanero salsa (you have to ask for it--this is not the salsa they serve with the chips)."], ["Teresa P.", "This place isn't 'horrible' by any means, but I've really tasted a lot better latin american food.

But... this is Kansas. So, props to La Parilla for bringing some variety to Lawrence. Still, I expect more.I ordered the chicken mulato rice bowl, which ended up being a huge portion, but honestly, it didn't taste much different from a burrito bowl you can get a chipotle. And Chipotle might actually give a bit more punch on the flavor too. One of the girls at our table who ordered el chile relleno had a super duper sad looking chile relleno.

As I waited on my meal, I watched a server scrape the bottom of a bowl with a knife then lick it. Twice. The menu said the fish was beer battered, but I didn't taste a beer flavor, or any flavor for that matter-the pieces of fish weren't even crispy.

I'm a big fan of their tacos- the barbacoa was excellent. \u00a0The carnitas filling was pretty fatty though, so I likely won't get that in the future. \u00a0The food is not Mexican - I consider it to more like Latin -fusion with some typical offerings with a new twist such as chimichangas with a creamy, veggie-mushroom filling.They have a nice selection of beers, offering microbrews from Mexico and Brazil. \u00a0I tried the Chupacabra amber and really enjoyed it. \u00a0My boyfriend is a huge fan of their magaritas.The seating outside is limited to two tables, but if your lucky enough to get one, you have prime seats for people watching and munching on chips and salsa before your meal. \u00a0 Owned by the same folks that do Zen Zero and Genevese, they seem to have a formula that ensures success in the Lawrence market.They've started offering breakfast on weekends, so I'm looking forward to some trying their huevos rancheros soon."], ["Billie H.", "Have you ever been somewhere and once you were seated and ordered a drink realized you have been there, but another location before and really not cared for it. I was in Lawrence and walked by and noticed the Latin food sign. My interest was peaked so I stopped in. Once seated and after ordering my beer I was looking through the menu and realize I had tried the Olathe location and was not impressed at all. I sat there thinking if it would be rude to just pay for my beer and leave, but decided to try something. I knew I didn't care for the chimis so I went with the pork tacos. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised! The pork was well seasoned, and the platter came with beans and rice. Both were standard Mexican dishes. I still do not understand the billing of this being a Latin restaurant. There are a couple of options on the menu that would be considered more Latin, but the menu is a standard Mexican menu. I will have to try the Olathe location again to see if the tacos rate as good as what I enjoyed in Lawrence. I will say based on my Olathe experience, do not try the fired chimis unless you really like fried tortillas, because that is about all they are. The restaurant in Lawrence is smaller than the Olathe one. When I was there it was not very busy so the smaller location did not seem to be an impact. The wait staff was so-so. I was offended at being referred to as a sir initially. Even though I have shorter hair, I have quite a large chest so I am not sure where the confusion came from, especially in a town with quite a blend of people. TMy waitress was the same person who greeted and served me and she was not overly attentive.

Eating it wasn't exactly a chore, but the process became a bit mechanical -- fork to mouth with little variation to enjoy from its narrow flavor spectrum. Perhaps I should have tried a more representative item, though I liked how the menu offered some creative choices for adventurous diners. The beans and rice were just a touch too cool (temperature) and not especially interesting. The salsa I had was rather mild but with some nice flavors.The service was very attentive, the interior was clean and inviting (I understand that it was recently reworked), and the prices were good.

They seemed understaffed on a busy day, but the service was far less than what might be understood for a busy lunch hour \u00a0- it was terrible. There was zero sense of a \"service culture\" or protocol in the restaurant. The attitude seemed downright snooty. It reminded me of a trip I took to Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union - it felt like the roles were reversed and the customer was there to serve the restaurant staff. We waited excessively to be seated. We waited excessively for service. I had to ask 3 times for the waitress to bring a side item we ordered. I was excited to take a guest there, along with my wife and children. I was shocked when the server (finally) brought our bill - I was automatically charged 18% gratuity \u00a0for the worst restaurant service I'd experienced in years.

It was good, but not what I was expecting."], ["David G.", "Since the move from counter service to table service, the quality of the food and experience has remained the same. \u00a0I was initially worried that prices or selection would change, but for the most part they haven't. \u00a0They still have daily entree and soup specials that, for me, are always a highlight of our visit.This is South American fare, not just Tex-Mex. \u00a0Expect recipe and styles of cooking from all over the region. \u00a0Standards such as enchiladas and tacos are available, but more exotic ingredients are included. \u00a0This place is extremely vegetarian friendly and you can order rice and beans without animal products upon request and the tofu rice bowl is a protein packed and complete treat. \u00a0 If I'm feeling more sinful, I might get a portabella and Roasted Red Pepper chimichanga. \u00a0 Salsas are tasty, but the chips aren't usually very fresh tasting; the guac is to die for!The service is generally speedy and friendly, and above average for a college town. \u00a0 A great choice!"], ["Erin P.", "Mass street got some major cred when La Parilla moved in. \u00a0How often do you get a chance to eat at a Latin American establishment (as opposed to TexMex style)? \u00a0The fact that La Parilla has done so well and has become a mainstay for townies like myself shows that if you know what you're doing and you do it well, people will come even if they're like \"what the hell is Latin American cuisine?\" at first.Interestingly enough, I only gave La Parilla four stars because I really miss the old walk-up counter they had prior to the renovation. \u00a0I think renovating to the waiter/waitress style was kind of a mistake. \u00a0I used to just walk up and get what I wanted rather quickly, but now you have to flag down a staff person who also has to attend to several other tables. \u00a0It takes longer to refill my drink and my chips/salsa than it did when it was less \"fancy.\"Some of my favs include the horchata, the Brazilian lemonade, the portabella and roasted red pepper chimi and pretty much anything they happen to put on special for the day. \u00a0La Parilla, Zen Zero, and Genovese are all owned by the same outfit in case anyone didn't know. \u00a0I appreciate their willingness to bring some delicious diversity to downtown Lawrence and hope that La Parilla continues to do well."], ["Sarah M.", "I have only been here for breakfast but the food was great, service was friendly, and great atmosphere! Prices are not bad either!"], ["Clarice W.", "I really didn't want to not like La Parilla, it was recommended to me by several people and was one of the first places I tried in Lawrence. But after my second disappointing visit I feel more justified in writing about it...I mean, the experience is fine. Nice wait staff, attentive and friendly. I actually really like the remodeling, it's spacious and clean. But the food! The moment my plate came out I died a little inside. It looked like someone had splatted a ladle-ful of refried beans on my plate...15 minutes ago. Because it had hardened and become really pasty in color. There were dribbles of dried bean on my rice. And on the side was my poor little chile relleno, looking all the more limp and sad. I say sad because this is precisely how it tasted - it was so, so boring - bland cheese stuffed in an unseasoned poblano, with an even blander sauce on top. I'm not looking for fancy here, but I need flavor! I guess I should give them credit for underseasoning rather than overseasoning, the more common restaurant faux-pas. Still, it all left a mushy, heavy sensation in my mouth, one that I'm not eager to return to, even in writing. I don't know if I'm just coming on off-days, but part of me is not convinced this is a fluke because of my first poor experience. At the very least, if you want to give La Parilla your own go, I can safely advise that you don't get the dinner specials - maybe opt for a rice bowl instead?"], ["Melissa R.", "To my suprise - La Parrilla has been totally remodeled. \u00a0They have the same tasty menu of Latin American delights but now offer waiter service at your table and a snazzy bar to sit at. \u00a0Everything on the menu I've tasted is delish!-Fave appetizers: guac and friend plantains-Fave entrees: tequila shrimp tacos, beef tacos w/ chimichurri sauce-Fave drink: $12 margarita pitchers on Saturday night"], ["Laura H.", "I've been to LaPa several times and have left satisfied each time but never wow-ed. Their bowls are VERY spicy but you can cool yourself down with their better-than-average margaritas. I want very badly to like La Parrilla more than I do, but I just don't. I would never veto a suggestion to go here, but I also wouldn't suggest it myself, ya know?"], ["Emily M.", "La Parrilla has changed, I dare say, all for the better. The new bar is slick, and now finally there is a (albeit small) place to hang out while you wait for a table, should you need to. The order counter has been replaced by sit-down service. The speed and quality of service are pretty good, all much better than the slow, clueless counter service of yore.Although La Parrilla touts itself as Latin, I would say the vast majority of the menu is derived from Mexico. Tacos, burritos, quesadillas (more American than Mex, obv) dominate, but there are arepas and rice/bean dishes with Central and South American origins. The value and prices are very good. A big bonus: La Parrilla gives you free chips and decent salsa with your dinner. In this day and age, a rarity. And they refill it. Portions are good sized and very filling. The rice bowls are delicious and savory goodness. Gals may be able to get 2 meals out of them -- guys will be full. My personal fave there is the Pork al Pastor quesadilla, with avocado. Creamy, meaty deliciousness on a plate.All in all, a notch more upscale than it used to be atmosphere-wise. But the same yummy Latin-Mexican-whatever south-of-the-border food they've always had."], ["Sarah G.", "I miss spicy food. I really, really miss spicy food.Even after visiting La Parrilla, I still really miss spicy food. Whatever salsa was given to me left a lot to be desired, and I'm wondering if midwesterners can even handle heat hotter than this. I ordered chile relleno, which was pretty damned good, but the rice and beans was so-so. What I really loved though, and what gives this place more than two stars, is the absolutely astounding strawberry margarita!"], ["Rain B.", "This is a great choice for the Gluten-free diner. Not only does the staff know what menu items are and are not safe, but they are also very friendly about it. Even more exciting: many of their items are gluten-free by default, and don't even require substitution. Jon and I both had rice bowls, which were very filling, large and tasty. \u00a0My rice bowl turned into dinner and breakfast for me, plus three meals for Pixel (my puppy), since there was more than I could eat and we were traveling.We were able to sit outside with our pup, which was quite nice, and the atmosphere was pretty good.I would be giving this spot five stars if it weren't for the nearly 40 minute wait Jon and I had to sit down. \u00a0I'm not sure it's their fault, and they were very friendly about it, but it would have been nice to have a spot to sit and maybe some drinks or something while we waited that long."], ["Ben E.", "$2 \u00a0Great Margaritas on Mondays... need I say more?"], ["Rachel M.", "Mmmm, this will always be on my top 3 go-to's for Lawrence! \u00a0The Latin Cuisine is affordable and very delicious. \u00a0I went with a fairly large group, and while it took a little bit to get seating, it was well worth the wait in the end. \u00a0Our group got the queso and the plantain chips with black bean dip for appetizers, all perfect. \u00a0For my main dish, I tried the Beef Flautas and loved it! \u00a0Everyone else in the group liked their dishes pretty well!"], ["Meg L.", "Ya know, I have noticed that this place just isnt as impressive as it used to be. \u00a0I used to love it. We went in this weekend on Sunday, and ordered the Jerk Pork Bowl. \u00a0Literally, I have had more meat in a chicken nugget than what came in the entire serving of this special. \u00a0Literally, there was less than 1 cup of NON rice ingredients, and less than an oz. of meat. \u00a0It was mostly grilled onions. I know this place isnt expensive, but its still 8 bucks plus drink and tip, and I get more bang for my buck and more meat at fricking Noodle and Co. \u00a0My boyfriend ordered the green chili pork bowl and it also, had almost no meat in it.They need to work on things in this joint."], ["Christina M.", "La Parilla (Spanish for \"The Parilla\") was my first dining experience in Lawrence many years ago when I began coming out on the weekends to visit all my high school friends who had started college at KU. It was then that I first discovered the joy of a very special beverage called Brazilian lemonade, and the restaurant has had a vice grip on my heart ever since. A lot has changed since then. They no longer have a walk-up ordering system. You're seated at a table and served by waitstaff, and they now offer a full bar. The atmosphere has also changed from a very casual eatery to one that has become significantly more fancy and/or schmancy. The quality of their food hasn't changed at all, though, and that's a very good thing. It may actually be my favorite restaurant in town, although it's a very tight race between this and the Burger Stand at the Casbah.If you ever talk to anyone in Lawrence about La Parilla, probably the first thing they'll mention is how much the food isn't Mexican. It's *Latin American,* and that's apparently such a big difference that people need to make a big thing out of telling you so. Whatever. That's really so far down the list of things you should know about La Parilla that it makes me facepalm every time someone says it. Stop being a pompous ass and get to the good stuff already. What you DO need to know:1) The food is delicious. They serve a lot of the same things you'd find at a Mexican restaurant, like enchiladas, quesadillas, chips and salsa, and even sopapillas. The difference in taste is pretty easy to spot, though. Much of the food here is a lot lighter than traditional Mexican fare, and the ingredients tend to taste fresher. I recommend the quesadillas suiza and the Salvadoran enchiladas. They also have unique foods, like their rice bowls and their plantain chips with black bean dip (both of which are amazing, by the way) that help to set them apart from other places.2) The beverages make me want to cry. Like, in a good way. Tears of ecstasy. Most of the time when we go out for Mexican food, I get a margarita. It's just what you're supposed to do. Here, however, I always forgo the tequila-y goodness for their non-alcoholic drinks. As I mentioned earlier, the Brazilian lemonade is my absolute favorite. Surprisingly, it contains zero lemon. Kind of like how a Long Island iced tea has absolutely nothing to do with tea, which I didn't know the first time I had it. That came back to haunt me. But that's another story for another time. A Brazilian lemonade here is actually a concoction made of lime juice, coconut milk, and ginger. Since they leave out the condensed milk in theirs, I could still drink it when I was vegan, which almost made me faint with relief. Last night, I also finally got to try their horchata, which is also fantastic. It's less rich than the Brazilian lemonade, but still very sweet and refreshing.3) The prices are super reasonable. The boyfriend and I made it out of there last night for about $30 with tip, and the portions are generous enough that we each had leftovers.I would easily be able to eat here a few times a week and not get tired of it, if that sort of extravagant eating-out budget was within my means. As it is, we probably go every couple of months or so, and that's not nearly enough, in my opinion. Even when we're not making regular visits for dinner, I have been known to stop in just for a Brazilian lemonade to go. However, I will neither confirm nor deny rumors of my having driven from Kansas City to Lawrence on multiple occasions just to get one. (Hypothetically, though, if I HAD done that, it would have totally been worth it.)"], ["Mike H.", "Maybe this place is best not experienced during lunch hour. My first visit was last week on a Thursday around 12:30pm. There were 2-3 people in line in front of me, but it still took at least 5 minutes before I got to order. I ordered their taco lunch combo. Got some chips and salsa to tide us over until our meals came out. I noticed nothing amazing about the salsa, typical salsa to me. My tacos were not quite what I expected when ordering beef tacos. I got corn tortilla, strip beef and some green sauce. Then green sauce worried me most, but it was actually what made the meal edible. While the dry meat and corn tortilla did nothing, the green sauce gave it some tang and spice. The tacos were served with plain re-fried beans and bland rice. My friend commented his tamales were pretty tasteless. There were some other dishes I was tempted to try here, but I don't know if I will bother going back after a completely forgettable first meal."]]}
