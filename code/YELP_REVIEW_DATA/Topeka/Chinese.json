This place has gone downhill since I last had it in 2006. In college, my roommate and I essentially lived on Thai Siam, and we loved everything they cooked up. The place was always a little divey, but it's in a strip mall, so we weren't going to judge. After what I experienced last week, however, I'm more than ready to judge.I walked in to a moderate lunch crowd. Didn't have to wait very long in line before ordering, so I was pleased about that. After filling up my soda, I turned to find a table. In the booth directly in front of the ordering counter was... I'm trying to find a way to describe this, and the only word coming to mind is \"crap.\" Not, like, literal crap, but just a big pile of random stuff. A jacket, some grocery bags filled with who-knows-what, a handful of open vitamin bottles, a couple of bags of candy, some more grocery bags on the seat, some newspapers. It looked like someone had been living out of that booth.I get that it's hard to keep a place clean all the time, but seriously... you can't just shove all that shit in the back before you open? Come on.Then my food arrived... after about twenty minutes. Which seems ridiculous for a place as small and non-crowded as it is. I ordered the same thing I'd always gotten before: tofu pad thai. What arrived at my table looked nothing like what I'd enjoyed so many times a few years ago. It was a big, greasy pile of noodles and some big rectangular chunks of over-fried and oil-soaked tofu. The peanuts in the sauce weren't ground to a pleasing texture. It felt like chewing grit. The sauce itself was oily and bland. I felt like I was just eating noodles soaked in peanut oil with some chilis thrown in to give it a modicum of flavor. In short: it was disgusting.When I got home that night, I sat on the couch for awhile with the dogs, and then it hit me. I needed to get to a bathroom STAT. Everything I'd eaten came right back up. Now, ordinarily I might be willing to blame part of this on being pregnant, but I'm on Zofran. It's the stuff they give to chemo patients to combat their nausea. Since getting that magical, wonderful stuff prescribed, I have had zero problems with morning sickness, so I'm kind of not willing to give Thai Siam the benefit of the doubt on this one. I figure I must have gotten food poisoning, or else all that oil just didn't agree with me.

The hardest part of the Thai curry cooking is to cook until the coconut milk have an oily sheen--somebody may think it is unhealthy but the curry with or without the oily sheen have the same amount of fat and calories (just a different look). They cook the curry well and very authentic. If I pick one from the curry list, I would pick the Thai curry with grilled duck. You cannot find it easily in US (even in Thailand). Their pad Thai is as good as you can get in Lawrence. Sometimes, it is too oily and too sweet for me. The ingredient for their pad Thai is not complete compared to what I had in Thailand. I think the pad Thai from Bangkok Pavilion in Overland Park is closer to what I had in Thailand. Their pad kee mow is good but not one of the kind. Other dishes I have tried are okay.
