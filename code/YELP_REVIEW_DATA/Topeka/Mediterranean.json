We drove the entirety of the city of Lawrence and then found ourselves walking up and down Massachusetts street. We got to the point where we didn't care what we were gonna eat but we just needed something and needed soon. The closest restaurant to us at that point was The Mad Greek. My friend said screw it and just walked towards the entrance and we followed. We walked in and saw an empty restaurant confused I walked back outside to make sure they were open. They were in fact and we were seated immediately. Our server was very professional, she greeted us very warmly and asked what we would like to eat and drink. She was very informative of the menu and even helped us edit our orders to our pleasing. Our food was prepared very fast which was great considering our hunger. My salad was decently good and would have been better but I forgot to ask for no onions. My friends food looked great and they both enjoyed their meals tremendously. My friend complimented the ravioli saying it was some of the best he's had. The scenery of the restaurant was great but was somewhat gloomy and we could over hear the table next to us in a argument and one of the individuals was crying. This was the only bad part of our meal but it's clearly not the restaurants fault. Over all it was a great adventure that I thought I should share."], ["Rick S.", "I reserve one star ratings for fast food quality and abhorrent service. That said, I found it difficult to not go below two stars because I think the quality of food at The Mad Greek has deteriorated nearly to fast food level. I used to love this place. It was where I took guests and dates for a unique dinner in Lawrence. Though the service is average (meaning I have no opinion one way or the other because nothing stood out), I remember when they took much more pride in their food. Sadly, it's clear that they have stopped taking pride in what they serve a long time ago. I took a friend there after taking a break from eating there for over a year to give them a chance to improve. I found it has only worsened. My food was served slopped onto my plate with half of my meat and half of my green beans buried in rice school lunch style. The food was lukewarm, at best. My sliced tomato was so unripened that it was still mostly white, tough, and tasted like paper. I didn't bother finishing it. How does a restaurant in a town like Lawrence with such a great farmer's market right down the street allow that to happen?The gyros dinner, one of their signature plates, came with a few small cut pieces of pita (not nearly enough for the gyro meat). The meat itself tasted old; it looked more boiled than roasted and had about the same flavor. Their infamous green tomato beans came with almost no sauce as it used to and I found myself wondering if they're still made the same way. That may have been the liquid that ran over my plate saturating my gyro meat, pita bread, and an already questionable rice pilaf.The bright side was the toasted ravioli appetizer, which I thought was good but was served without plates for two people--so no way to keep from sharing the dipping marinara which probably matters to some people. This place desperately needs a defibrillation to either get their menu and kitchen working again or start anew. They are surviving on name alone and something tells me that, soon, even their name and history won't carry them anymore. For me, the restaurant I once loved is already gone. I won't be returning."], ["Stephanie C.", "This place is amazing! \u00a0I come here every time I visit Lawrence and it never disappoints! \u00a0Great food-hot feta is my fav, fried ravioli, spinach pie, gyros to die for. \u00a0Check it out! \u00a0Plan a trip!!"], ["Erin T.", "Some plain Jane Greek food nothing special at all, no one is trying hard on these plain Greek staples.

The waiter seemed knowledgeable enough and was able to tell me that a Greek margarita has uzo and blue curacao in it (no thanks). The saganaki came out quickly and was pretty good. However, it was served with a ton of pita bread which is not something I've ever seen before.The gyros dinners also came out quickly and were just okay. The gyros meat tasted like the standard food service quality gyros. The tzatziki sauce was flavorful and fresh and the pita bread had a nice warm chewy but airy flavor. However, the rice pilaf was terrible and tasted like a store bought boxed mix with some dried cranberries tossed in. Equally baffling was the inclusion of canned green beans and one boiled potato slathered in watery tomato sauce. The sauce sort of ran all over the plate and made the pita bread very soggy. I had hoped for some feta cheese and kalamata olives but those were nowhere to be found. \u00a0Overall this place was just okay.

Well I went in with my friend and her little sister (12) and her sisters friends. Our waiter was Cris (yeah I'm calling you out). They sat us in a tiny booth causing us to all have to squeeze in. When he came to ask for our drinks all I said was \"water\" and he goes \"Ok so 5 waters\" assuming we were all getting waters (the other girls wanted sprites so we had to re order when he came back) then he quickly rushed us when we were trying to order. (It wasn't even that busy but apparently he wanted us out of there) Finally he brought our food pretty quickly but we had no meatballs in any of our \"spaghetti and meatballs\" we ordered. We then said \"do you mind bringing a bowl of meatballs\" and he goes \"why didn't you order that when I was taking your orders\" and I just firmly replied \"we did.\" That got his attention and the service for the rest of the time was sub par.

Service was a tad slow for the buffet as well with very slow refills on water and ice tea. I guess I had forgotten what an awkward and cramped space this restaurant has, but just getting in and out with wait staff and other patrons clogging up the aisles was amusing.

I'm a huge fan of the flavors in Greek food and the restaurant seems to have a nice authentic feel to it, regardless of whether or not it is actually in fact authentic.

The high ceilings and darkish wall mural, along with the many planters and other Greco-Roman statues and architecture give the feeling of eating outside in a garden at dusk. It sometimes seems a little dark, especially at the back of the restaurant, but I've never felt it to be unpleasant.The food is also very good, and the prices match the portions well. I typically get the falafel, which is always fantastic. They give you plenty of tzatziki for the gyros, and they seem to have a rotating assortment of sides that come with the entrees. It's often some variation/combination of green beans, a small salad, jasmine rice, new potatoes, etc.They also have an excellent assortment of desserts that, if you're interested, they'll bring out on a huge, delicious-looking tray.

We never got refills on our drinks...she finally gave me the check after I sat there waving her down. I stood up for a second to pay the check and went back to drink a bit more of my melted ice in my empty glass and they already bussed the table. I told him that I was still sitting there and he said \"Oh, I didn't know\" and kept bussing the table and took my \"drink\" even after I told him 2 or 3 times that I still wanted to sit there and was going to DRINK THAT.

Good Greek Cuisine, Moderate PricesMad Greek Restaurant907 MassachusettsLawrence, KS 66044madgreekrestaurantlawren\u2026Phone: 785-843-2441If you like arsenic poisoning, you will love the Mad Greek in downtown Lawrence! Seriously, this restaurant is actually pretty good and reasonably priced. The reason I made that comment is because they seem to serve rice and green beans with EVERY dish and rice has been linked to high arsenic content with recommendations, according to OneGreenPlanet.org and others, to limit rice consumption to once a week among other precautions.On our first visit to The Mad Greek, my wife ordered the spinach pie ($7.99), spinach and feta cheese with herbs baked in a light phyllo dough with tzatziki (a creamy cucumber sauce used extensively in Grecian cooking) and fresh pita bread. The spinach pies were light and flaky with a perfect ratio of filling to crust. For the price, I would think a salad would be included, but you must pay $1.99 to add a Greek salad ($1.59 for \"house\" salad) to any entr\u00e9e. My wife and I both ordered a Greek salad with our meals and at $1.99 extra, not a bad deal considering the quality. Fresh romaine lettuce, tomato, Greek Calamata olives, and crumbled feta cheese in a Greek olive oil and vinegar dressing. I would prefer chunks of feta over the fine crumbles, but the taste is the same either way...very good.Greek \"Side\" SaladI ordered the gyros platter, a reasonable ($9.99 - not abundant) amount of sliced gyro meat (a combination of seasoned beef and lamb), pita bread, tzatziki, green beans, and rice (of course). The gyro meat was fresh and tasty, and the tzatziki delicious, but the pita bread was a little too soft for my taste. The green beans were simmered in a tomato sauce and were \"OK\" and the rice was similarly boring, but I am not a huge rice lover. I ordered a side of french fries ($2.99), which were hot and crunchy just the way I like them, but I will probably ask to substitute fries for the rice and green beans on our next visit.On our second visit it was my wife's birthday, so I ordered the \"flaming\" saganaki, a slab of fresh Greek goat cheese soaked in batter, deep fried, and served in a flaming extravaganza table side. The \"oohs\" and \"aahs\" of fellow customers followed the lighting of the cheese, but at $7.99 the dish was overpriced by AT LEAST $2.00 in my opinion, coming with one slice of pita bread (cut into six pieces). The birthday girl ordered the moussaka, one of her staples (along with Greek salad) during our month-long visit to Greece in 2005. The moussaka - eggplant, ground beef and other ingredients covered with a b\u00e9chamel sauce and baked - looked as though it had been sitting for a while and the serving was small, a cube no more than two and a half inches in diameter and at $9.99, about one quarter of the size of servings we received in Greece. The moussaka came with pita bread, rice and green beans, so my wife substituted french fries at no additional charge. She did not like it and I thought it was very \"average\", being overpriced for the serving size.I decided to try one of the Italian offerings, so I ordered the cannelloni Florentine, pasta tubes stuffed with veal, spinach and seasonings then baked after being covered with alfredo (white) and red sauce. The cannelloni was actually pretty good, but the sauces were both rather boring, most likely coming from a can or jar, not homemade. Again, we had to pay $1.99 each to add a Greek salad and mine came with two small pieces of garlic bread ($9.99 for pasta and bread, $11.98 including the salad, not bad, but NOT A GREAT VALUE).Wine is reasonable at $3.50 per glass for the house wine, a tasty, inexpensive burgundy that went well with both meals. They have a full bar and prices seem fairly reasonable with a decent selection of drafts at $3.99 to $4.59 (stout). Water is served wit a lemon slice, but I had to ask for refills, something that should not have happened considering the small number of customers that night.The Mad Greek has original Greek recipes and decent food, but the value for the price is questionable. Ordering \"ala carte\" should be reserved for restaurants with cloth napkins and severs who take your payment rather than making customers stand in line to pay our bills (as is the case at The Mad Greek). I would recommend including a Greek salad with entrees and maybe increasing the price by fifty cents to a dollar to offset the cost and having servers handle payments as is done in even the cheapest sit-down restaurants these days. People should feel as if they are receiving a \"good value\" for their money and NOT feel like we are eating at McDonalds after having spent $25 each for dinner.CombatCritic gives The Mad Greek 6 Bombs Out of 10 ...

I spent $11 on one piece of lasagna which wasnt any better than Fazolis. My frind spent I think $9-10 on like 10 pieces of ravioli. Placed looked nice until they gave you your food on a plastic plate that looked like it should bebused at ihop. I wouldnt go back again."], ["Gaz H.", "Very friendly servers. Nice dining room. Just one problem: the food for the dinner service is powerfully mediocre. At best. Bo knows Greek food and this kitchen has some significant shortcomings. The taste of the gyros is all wrong. Also, in the one area where Greek restaurants always distinguish themselves the Mad Greek is sorely lacking: roasted meats. The (pork) souvlaki was comprised of some horrifically poor cuts, prepared inexpertly. Side dish of green beans and potatoes was blandsville, population you. There was no redemption in old favorites, either: the moussaka was also bland and completely forgettable. The rice was an abortive mixture of cranberries and other such non-Greek additions. Not to say that nothing they serve is good; the pita and the tdzadsiki (sp?) were just fine. As was the baklava (it's imported from Chicago - they don't make it). I've had a spinach pie there before and it was just fine as well. But. So. Many. Things. Just. Suck. It's unforgivable. Overall, the kitchen powerfully disappoints. And the service was slow. And the servings were small. And the place is overpriced. Too bad, so sad."]], "Mediterranean Market & Cafe": [["Will M.", "A perfect gyro: succulent meat, perfectly crunchy toasted pita bread, and delicious tangy tzatziki sauce. It's the best in Lawrence, and it's worth the trip."], ["Ben M.", "I buy several specialty items in their market area less expensive than online and have never been disappointed with any of them. \u00a0I especially love the Marco Polo sour cherry preserves.. \u00a0I have only eaten there once and the soup was excellent. \u00a0The staff is also very helpful and nice."], ["Alexandra O.", "This unassuming little gem is tucked into a small strip mall. I spent just as much time looking around the wide selection of Middle and Near Eastern and European goods for sale as I did eating my lunch. I had a great lamb and beef gyro with a small side of hummus and a perfectly sized side salad. The ingredients all tasted fresh, the meat was perfectly seasoned and roasted and the pita was warm and soft. This is a great meal for a good price ($10). Lawrence is lucky to have such an awesome Mediterranean market. They have great prices on nuts, especially in addition to a great selection of cheeses and dry food goods. The staff is very friendly as well. I will definitely be eating here again."], ["Fred W.", "One of our family favorites - the pita bread is amazing and will spoil you for other pita breads. The hot feta dip, lamb shawarma, and hummus are all delicious. Take out is fast and courteous."], ["Jessica H.", "Gyros and falafel are great! Friendly staff as well."], ["Scott T.", "Have never eaten here but have made more meals from products purchased from the market than I could possibly count.Note to starving college students: the large bags of basmati rice coming in just over $1 per lb. in the largest bags are a sure way to stay fed on the cheap, and it's hands down the best rice in town in my opinion, priced far less than the Community Merc. Love ya Merc, but your rice at twice the price isn't in the same league. Also a must: the large olive oils in the can. Yea, I know what you're thinking, but again, the quality here is unparalleled in Lawrence. Better than the Merc at multiples over in pricing. Easy decision. Buy bulk, save a ton of money.Other quality staples purchased regularly:Pine Nuts - top notch quality and best price in town.DatesOlives - great selection in bulkCanned Sardines - best in town in my opinionPecorino Romano - again, a surprising option for this store, terrific quality.... and much more. Love this place. The owner is friendly and the service is good, prices reasonable. Lots of interesting food options and spices you aren't going to find elsewhere in town make this a must destination for food shoppers."], ["Teresa G.", "I've been here a few times to eat and buy groceries (olives & pepperoncini, tabbouleh, tzaziki, pita, green cardamom). The food is good, service is friendly, and the green olives stuffed with garlic are better than whatever else I've bought around town. I think the menu prices are a little steep compared to NY (or, NYC for people who call it that), but this place is the only one around in what I consider a relatively barren culinary desert, so there's that. The brand selection for tahini and other groceries is so much better than any of the more general grocery stores -- to be expected."], ["H C.", "I think the stuffed grape leaves are the yummiest thing you can eat in Lawrence! \u00a0And the hummus is beautiful too. \u00a0Sure, the ambiance is off - it is a strip mall - but heck, these guys can cook! \u00a0Once I went in to buy groceries. \u00a0I told the owner what I was planning on making. \u00a0He was so worried that I would get the flavor profile wrong, he mixed some up himself and sent me home with it. \u00a0I loved it!"], ["Charity T.", "This was my first time eating chicken shawarma and I loved it! Will definitely eat here again and recommend it to people."], ["Paul G.", "I go to this restaurant when I come to Lawrence. Been coming for years and never been disappointed. Good food plus a Mediterranean market like you find nowhere else in Kansas. I always get the spinach pie vegetarian \u00a0combination, love the hummus and pita bread. More varieties of olives than I knew existed. You won't believe how many different varieties of things they have from the middle eastern countries"], ["Christina J.", "This place is great! Especially for lunch. I've shown it to many of my friends over the years. Love the food and the little store has nice teas and a large selection of olives. It's not much to look at, so I usually do carry out. Best felafel in town! Lots of vegetarian options, too!"], ["Shibli N.", "The most authentic middle eastern cuisine. I always go for the lamb swarmah with hot sauce. All their food is a reminder of the cuisine I grew up with and is excellent. Their select market has really good olives and cheeses and some.....Too bad I am back in Dallas but be back first place to eat when visiting in march. That' s a given. Wonderful hospitality."], ["Judy R.", "The spinach pie tastes better each time I taste it! The humus can be purchased on site or at The Merc or checkers !"], ["Karen C.", "The food is tasty here, but not the feed middle eastern in town. The baba ganoush was smoky and delicious, but the falafel was spongy and cakey. The dolmas were expensive to come from a can. The red lentil soup was very delicious, but again, very expensive. The ambiance is lacking, but not much can be expected, as the cafe is inside the store. Our dinner for two came out to fifty bucks. That was one entree, two appetizers, two soups and one drink. \u00a0In my opinion, Aladdin's cafe is more delicious, and better priced!"], ["Tara M.", "Tried this place after reading reviews and was not disappointed. The hummus is delicious and the pita fresh and warm. I had the spinach pie; it has the perfect balance of flaky and moist, go for it!"], ["Clarice W.", "This place is off the beaten path but totally hits the spot when you're craving street food. Don't expect anything fancy or exciting, you get standard Mediterranean fare here: gyros, moussaka, falafel, and shawarma, and it's all served on paper Dixie plates. Love it. Their sandwiches are reasonably priced (5.99) but a little on the small side if you have a bigger appetite than me. The falafel wasn't quite as crisp and similarly the shawarma wasn't as rich or juicy as it could've been, but this is not exactly a restaurant with a shawarma spit in the window and a full-time cooking staff so you can't expect that level of freshness. It did the job well enough for me, and still tastes A-ok when folded in with warm, delicate pita and tahini. It makes me sad that so few people seem to know about this place - try it!! It's a nice little find in Lawrence."], ["Nicole M.", "You wouldn't think one of the best gyros ever would be found in an unassuming strip mall. Their market has a wide variety of Middle Eastern food and their lamb and beef gyro is incredible."], ["Scott S.", "Mediterranean Market is a good, solid option for Middle Eastern food in a casual setting."], ["Crystal L.", "When I lived in Lawrence, I loved going to this place. \u00a0I bought the tzaziki sauce by the pint and ate it with their homemade pita and gyros. \u00a0Their moussaka is to die for. \u00a0Flavorful, savory layers of of eggplant and ground lamb folded with a delicious tomato sauce and finally covered with a blanket of cinnamon spiced bechamel sauce. \u00a0My sister and I would frequent this place often when we went on a culinary adventure to the Middle East in our kitchen. \u00a0We would find everything we needed to make our own moussaka, our version of adas polo, our endeavor to make dolmadas, and our awesome rendition of baklava."], ["Barbara T.", "The Mediterranean Market's variety of grocery items alone is pretty nice, however it's their cafe food that I want to comment on. \u00a0We had the lunch gyros combo. \u00a0It comes with gyros sandwich, side salad, \u00a0pita and hummus. \u00a0I did not have high expectations as it has a deli atmosphere, and the food was presented on paper plates and plastic silverware. \u00a0However when I tasted the food, I was extremely surprised and delighted. \u00a0The gyros meat was the best I've ever had. \u00a0It is more flavorful and tender as well as thicker cut than most places. \u00a0The pita was soft and the hummus had \u00a0what I would guess is a more authentic flavor than what I've had before, because you could actually taste the tahini in it. \u00a0The people working in the store were some of the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered in an ethnic grocery. \u00a0We will definitely visit again!"], ["Joe W.", "Best Mediterranean food in town. \u00a0Nice place to stop in and get a meal to go. Hummus is great. \u00a0Also, pick up your goat cheese here, less expensive than the grocery stores."]]}
