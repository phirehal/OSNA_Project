Really, really good and crafted there. Just amazing, and it will mess you up, so watch out!I truly think their appetizers are the best things they offer, not to diss their entrees. The Texas Nachos are SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Huge plate of chips smothered in their slow cooked black beans that have so much rich, deep flavor, and then melted cheddar cheese (no processed cheese food here, sorry queso lovers!) and green onions, tomatoes, who really knows? All I know is that it is awesome and enough to feed an army. Their fried pickles are also the best I've ever had, and I saw they took them off the appetizer menu but next time I will ask because they still make them to put on sandwiches. The stuffed mushrooms, tiger tips, and cheese fries also super good!It is trial-and-error with entrees. My boyfriend loves their BBQ but does not like their sauce, so he has learned to order sauce on the side and go with ketchup or whatever instead. I have learned that some things I love at other restaurants I don't like so much here, like the fish and chips or the fish tacos, but that just means I don't order them.My kids love the hot dogs and corn dogs (which are enormous and made in-house- who does that?) and the chicken fingers and the burgers, the list goes on.

My husband had a chicken quesadilla which was excellent and I had brisket with baked beans and vegetables. The brisket with BBQ sauce was tender and tasty. The baked beans were fabulous!

As a vegetarian, I was alarmed. However, I cut into the tortilla and there was no chicken in sight. False alarm! The guacamole looked like it had been sitting out for too long-and it probably had considering that we sat around for so long!

So I never thought I would ever come here to have a drink and a meal. Well that changed when it was suggested by the gf to dine here.From the outside, it's not much. In fact it looks a bit smaller from the outside. Once you do walk in, this place is massive. It has a lower and upper level seating and it feels like it keeps going on. The lighting is a amber glow, which gives it a darker atmosphere. With the amount of people it seats, it'll be above average for noise level.I ordered the Honey Wheat beer, which honestly was not impressive at all. Light beers are generally easy to drink, but this ranked close to a Coors Light. It had barely any flavor and no resemblance to any Honey flavoring. It was good, but I think next time I'll try a few different beers. From what I saw on some waitresses trays, they had small cups which looked like samples.For my meal, I ordered a 10 oz corner steak - medium rare. I generally do medium rare because most places tend to slightly over cook what you requested. What I got was impeccable. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned perfectly. Out of all the steaks I have ate, this was by far the best one I have eaten. The waitress gave me the option of replacing the salad with another side. I did that and had the vegetable medley and garlic mashed potatoes. Both came out scorching hot. Give it time to cool off before you get a mouthful.Our waitress checked on us every 10-15 minutes, which I think was fair and not too obtrusive. So service was great.I tried out my gf's chicken, which was moist and good. Chicken is fairly difficult to cook, because it can often come out dry and tasteless.Blind Tiger's strength is in their food. It was spectacular. I don't think we waited too long either for our food. After it was ordered, about 10-14 minutes it arrived. Usually this is a red flag for \"pre-prepping\" food that is usually bad. Not the case here.I recommend them highly if you're visiting Topeka and want a great meal at a great restaurant."], ["Joseph L.", "I haven't been to this place in years. Nothing has changed.

May a mistake a took my 8 year old and looked down in to the area in the bottom floor where some of the beer vats are. Near the restroom.

Don't go here expecting anything fancy, but they do have a good solid menu of sandwiches, soups, and baked potatoes (not as big a menu as it used to be, however- they've pared it down significantly,) and a massive beer and shots selections- although they no longer have Stella Artois on tap, which makes me sad. They're also transitioning into their Fall/Autumn beers, so some of their advertised Summer beers are gone- but they still had Boulevard Radler, which is lemon-ginger and sooooo yummy. I ordered the half French Dip with a bread bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. They have potato bacon soup and chili every day, plus one extra selection. The French Dip was one of the best I've ever had, and the soup was delicious too, but the bread bowl was white, bland, and dry- I wish I'd saved those calories and just ordered it in a regular bowl. The staff is friendly enough, and there's tons of TV's on but it's not crazy loud."], ["Jenn S.", "Use to be my favorite place in Topeka. \u00a0Took the Veggie sandwich off the menu and would not make me one. \u00a0Such a shame because you know they could have slapped some lettuce and tomato on some bread for me. \u00a0Please try to accommodate your non meat eaters."], ["David B.", "God, what a dump.

Plus they have Guinness on tap and Jamison on the shelf which meets my requirement for a five star rating -- ability to make Irish Car Bombs. \u00a0With a mix of tables, booths, and bar seats, its a comfortable place to meet up with a date or a large group of friends. \u00a0The back half of the bar has darts set up and there are a number of televisions.

Its friendlier and has a more mellow vibe.) I was totally comfortable sitting at this bar alone waiting on friends for over an hour on a Wednesday night. I would definitely recommend this bar to people visiting from out of town.Quinton's also serves food but I've never tried it (kitchen closes at 10p).

Seems a bit odd, but hey, it works!We arrived exactly on time for our 7:30pm reservation, but had to wait 15 minutes for our table ... STRIKE 1! While we waited, we had a view of the prep area where a server was taking cherry tarts out of a box that looked like something from Sam's Club ... STRIKE 2! The prices on the menu were significantly higher than the menu on their website ... STRIKE 3! Normally an \"out\", I have to admit that we enjoyed our dinner and may very well return to try Chez Yasu again ... MAYBE.I love escargots (snails - $7.95 online, $8.95 in reality) and their buttery, garlicly goodness, rarely having the opportunity to order them in culturally challenged eastern Kansas, so I did (as an antipasto). Sans shells, they came six on a plate accompanied by a couple sliced mushrooms and doused with a savory garlic, parsley, and butter sauce. They were good, but nowhere near the best I have had and definitely some of the priciest at $1.50 a pop.My wife had the potato and leek soup (potage - $3.95/$4.95) which apparently comes either hot or cold because when it arrived, it was ice-cold! We asked the server to please bring her the warm version. The soup was decent, moderately flavorful, but a little too watery for my taste. It could have been thicker with a bit more seasoning, but the bread made up for it. The server brought more freshly baked bread as needed and was actually one of the highlights of the night The Poulet Saut\u00e9, thinly sliced chicken breast served with a light teriyaki sauce ($16.95/$19.95 - also available with an herb or peppercorn sauce), was moist, light, and succulent with just enough teriyaki to flavor the dish without overpowering the poultry. I would have preferred the herb or peppercorn sauce in a French restaurant, but my wife does not appreciate pepper as much as I do and because she was eating it, I happily succumbed to her decision. The potatoes, not plentiful enough to last as long as the chicken, were light, good, and creamy and the green beans crisp with just enough butter and seasoning. In my opinion, $16.95 for a basic chicken dish is probably at the top of the scale, but $20 is excessive. Not a great value.Boeuf Borguignon ($21.95/$24.95), braised boneless beef short ribs, onions, and mushrooms in a red (burgundy, hence the name) wine reduction. Accompanied by the same mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, the plate was pleasing to the eye and very good. The burgundy sauce was perfect, but for such a small and inexpensive cut of meat, a couple mushrooms, potatoes, and beans, the price we paid was easily six times the food cost and again not a great value in my eyes. I believe the advertised $21.95 would be more appropriate and $19.95 would be a much better value, earning an extra bomb, maybe two in my book (or blog in this case).The house wine (Root: 1), a deep red, full bodies Chilean cabernet with intense fruity tones was the perfect accompaniment to the boeuf borguignon, but at $28 it was the least expensive option on a small wine menu with most bottles coming in at $40 or more.Now do not get me wrong, I have no trouble paying top dollar (or Euro) for a top-shelf meal worthy of a Michelin Star or two, but Chez Yasu will not be getting that star any time soon. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world ... Brussels, Paris, Rome, Madrid, Tokyo, Seoul, Budapest, you name it ... and although decent, this small French restaurant in Topeka, Kansas is overpriced in my opinion. By comparison, one of my favorite French restaurants, Le Central in Denver (Colorado) has a much more extensive and affordable wine list, a menu offering a comparable number of options (plus an elaborate offering of mussel dishes, with unlimited French fries by the way, for under $10) all under or close to $20, and superb cuisine prepared by real French chefs. In that comparison, Chez Yasu does not even come close, hence my rating of \"value\" ....CombatCritic Gives Chez Yasu 6 Bombs Out of 10 ...

The scallops were so tender and yummy and I had no shame in dipping the baguette into the sauce leftover. I restrained myself from licking the plate.Next we had soup --my friend ordered what she always orders: the cold potato and leek soup, and I tried the squash soup. And boy am I glad I did. It was so, so good. It tasted like fall season in the summer. So creamy and buttery and yummy! More bread-dipping ensued to get every last drop of that soup off the bowl.And finally, I ordered the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was cooked just right and came with a sweet teriyaki sauce, mashed potatoes, and green beans, all on a bed of rice.

I was really disturbed when I looked at the ceiling fan and saw that it literally had clumps of dust hanging from each wing. My mother would have had a stroke if she saw that mess. The menu had very little selection. I think there were about four or five entrees to choose from.

One of the previous reviews was right on the money. Right off the bat, I had misgivings when I went in and they were putting supermarket French bread into an oven. \"Don't be snobby, keep an open mind\" I told myself. \u00a0I also tried to convince myself to ignore the diner d\u00e9cor and plastic tablecloths, and to just sit down and give the food a chance. I had the pur\u00e9e soup to start, and it tasted like it absorbed a lot of the other flavors in the refrigerator that it was stored in. This is one of my pet peeves, and this syndrome usually stems from having an inadequate evaporator in a refrigerator. A good frame of reference would be when your ice cubes smell like garlic or onions because you keep them in a crappy refrigerator. This was such an occasion. My second course consisted of the saddest salad I have ever seen. It was shredded lettuce with some type of ultra-sour vinaigrette on top. Not even a sprig of parsley or half a cherry tomato to spruce it up. That's okay, maybe the salmon would be better? Nothing gets me more angry than when I ask if fish is fresh, only to be laughed at and told \"of COURSE it's fresh, everything here is.\" \u00a0Well, it turns out that gray salmon is not indicative of freshness. On top of that, it was boiled to death and their \"wine reduction sauce\" was little more than some type of country gravy smacked on top of the fish. Excess water from the kitchen was simply left on the plate, and I'm sure that the fish wished it could come back to life just to kill itself again for being served with such a sad assortment of side vegetables. \u00a0Tip for restaurant: at least get edible baby carrots and snow peas. \u00a0 For a few minutes while I was eating lunch, I fully expected the stewardess to tell me to prepare for landing, because it tasted just as bad as airline food. A very enthusiastic one star. I don't take caustic reviews like this lightly, but I implore anyone who values food and their sanity to stay away from this monstrosity of a restaurant."], ["Nicholas G.", "A basic French restaurant that focuses on doing a few dishes well, this is one of only a few good non-chain restaurants in Topeka. \u00a0 They have a nice selection of interesting wines. \u00a0 My favorite entree here is the seafood served in a parchment pouch with a delicious lemon sauce.The dining room is pleasant but not formal or elaborate. \u00a0 I eat here 4 -5 times a year and ever meal has been a pleasure."]], "23rd Street Brewery": [["Mike D.", "Great local brewery here. Really cool building on the inside. KU everywhere, a big open air silo type roof, and plenty of booths and different style tables. All the girls working were very friendly and helpful.

I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and pub chips for dinner. The house garlic ranch and pub chips are absolutely amazing. The sandwich was great too. My only gripe is the food is pretty expensive. I mean like $14-$15 per meal. Really great place for beer lovers to check out in Lawrence though."], ["Chris S.", "Other reviews were mixed, but you cannot make everybody happy, so we decided to give 23rd Street Brewery a try when some of my wife's classmates suggested we meet there for dinner. For a Monday night, they were pretty busy, why I am not sure because the food was only \"fair\" and the prices rather \"high\". Five of us had to cram into a booth for four, so our meal was rather claustrophobic. The server was very nice and came quickly to take our drink orders. I tried a pint of their Bitter Professor IPA ($4.75) which, by the way, was not nearly as dark as the photo on their website indicates. It was very good with a robust hoppy, bitter taste indicative of a good IPA. I tried their More Cowbell Milk Stout (also $4.75) later in our meal. I love stouts, but this milk stout was not at all \"milky\" or as smooth as some I have had in the past, having a \"burnt\" taste as if someone had left the malt and barley unattended during roasting. I cannot imagine that it was intentional because it was not pleasant. One thumbs up, one down. On to the food. The food is not abundant and the prices a bit high for what we got. I ordered the French Dip sandwich, advertised as 8 ounces of sliced prime rib \"stuffed into a French loaf\" with horseradish sauce, Swiss cheese, a side of beef au jus and seasoned fries. ($12.49). The first thing I noticed was the size of the sandwich, coming on a bread roll about the size of a hot dog bun, not a \"French loaf\". $12.50 for this I said to myself? I think the advertised \"8 ounces\" of beef was also a bit of a stretch, but it did overwhelm the diminutive bun and making it look like there was more meat than there was. The meat was flavorful and the fries crispy, hot and tasty, but the sandwich was a disappointment and the plate would have been a much better value in the $7 to $9 range.My wife went with the Max's Mac & Cheese, advertised as \"shell pasta in a creamy mozzarella, provolone, and cheddar cream sauce ... baked and topped with bread crumbs\" ($12.99). Again, the portion was small for $13 considering that was all she got (a side salad is $3 extra), a plate of pasta with very little cheese sauce. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese has more flavor and I can buy a box of it for about a buck, so that tells you what a poor value this dish was. The dish was dry and flavorless.I saw on their website that they have a \"Mug Club\" and their advertised Monday Night Special was a 24 ounce schooner of draft beer for $3.50 - for Mug Club members. However, I could find no information on this \"Mug Club\" on their website or menu nor did our server mention anything about it. So when she returned with my 16 ounce, $4.75 IPA, I enquired. She told me that for $50 a year \"our regular customers\" get discounts on beer. Well, I am not a regular customer and very likely will not be, so I guess $5 for a pint was not a bad price. Our bill came to a little over $38, $46 including tip, for two beers, a sandwich, and small plate of pasta, a poor value even in comparison to the routinely underwhelming and overpriced cuisine of Lawrence, Kansas.Guess I will go to the liquor store, buy two good $1.50 to $2 bottles of beer ($9-$12 per six pack), and enjoy a couple boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese at home with my wife next time, saving $42 in the process.CombatCritic Gives 23rd Street Brewery Four Bombs Out Of 10 ... More Bombs Are Better!"], ["Scott T.", "23rd Street Brewery has been around for a long time and definitely has found its place in far West Lawrence. If I had my way, there'd be more watering holes like this on the side of town that... well, looks like any other suburb in the country. Miles upon miles of mauve and tan houses, all neatly lined up, indistinguishable from the next.But I digress... the beer at 23rd St. is quite good. It's not my favorite in town (pssst, there's that other place downtown) but it's decent. Good, not great. Service here can range from good to great, another problem. The \"other\" place, those are salaried professionals tending bar and serving that have benefits, insurance, vacation, etc. These are largely college students servicing the clientele. Big difference.Good food, especially the pub grub dishes. Hard to beat a burger and chips with a couple of pints and when the weather is nice, forgo the inside which is uninspiring and try out their patio. A refreshing place to dine and quaff while the sun is going down, and you can catch the Royals on the tube outside during the summer. Who doesn't like that? I rarely get to this side of town for the purposes of entertainment but did so recently and thought it time to weigh in.

I went on the Saturday of graduation weekend for dinner with a close friend and that friend's family. I decided on the alfredo, which seemed like a very safe bet. It wasn't anything special, but it was definitely filling. I should have asked for some added vegetables - my friend did, and was rewarded with probably a half star or full star bump in experience. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up eating pasta and sauce with nothing else (read: mac & cheese), but I really just thought the alfredo sans grilled chicken (read: vegetarian) missed the spot a bit. The service at 23rd Street is always very cheerful, but I feel like they are dressing their wait staff in more tight fitting clothes than they used to.

I enjoyed the pizzas. They were pretty good. I never had anything to drink because I'm not a beer drinker, and the cocktails seemed overpriced. The main problem is the noise. Even back then, when I could eat their pizzas, I hated this place. It's so loud all the time. I've been here maybe ten times, not all during happy hour, not all during lunch or dinner rushes, and every time, even when it seems relatively empty, it's just such a loud environment.

But then I developed celiac disease, and now I can't have gluten. 23rd Street Brewery has an 'allergen menu' which lists the small number of things that people with various restrictions can eat. But for no good reason, they assume that anyone looking at this menu has all of the possible allergies they are trying to provide for. As a result, the items on this menu are very few, very bland, and very boring. As a vegetarian, I can eat almost none of even these few bland boring listed items. I've tried to talk to waiters about possible additional options from the menu that might be safe for someone with celiac but no other allergies, but no one seems knowledgeable enough about the ingredients to give me that kind of information, nor are they particularly willing to go out of their way to find out. As a vegetarian with celiac disease, basically all I can eat here is a few flavorless and overcooked spears of asparagus, an incredibly overpriced avocado half, or a super boring pile of iceberg lettuce.

Unfortunately, my brother's selection did not agree with him. When Handler came to the table, she immediately exchanged it for another beer that was better suited. Everyone enjoyed their beers.When it came to our meals, we challenged Handler with six different selections many with substitutions. Handler was not rattled by our indecisiveness or our silly jokes. The entrees came out soon after the second round of drinks. BBQ pulled pork sandwich, chicken pesto pasta, macaroni and cheese, meat loaf, chicken fried steak and calzone.The portions were enormous! We knew there would be a lot of to-go boxes needed. by the end of the meal. The BBQ pull pork was piled on top of the bun. The meat was tender and the sauce was tasty and tangy. The chicken pesto pizza was perfectly baked on a thin crust. The chicken was plentiful and the seasonings were just right. Our mac-n-cheese expert gave his dish two thumbs up and said it was \"very cheesy\".The meat loaf dish came with two thick slices \u00a0and a mountain of mashed potatos. The brown gravy complimented the flavorful spices in the meat loaf.The chicken fried steak was a little tough and was the only negative mark on our meal. The pepperoni/sausage calzone was the size of a football! Stuffed with meat and cheese and sauce, it was all I could do to eat the whole thing. It was a challenge I was not going to lose.Lawrence is a college town. And while it bothered me to be surrounded by so many Jayhawks, this a great atmosphere to enjoy the game. Dozens of TV's surround the restaurant and bar. The largest was about 12 feet wide!When you go to the 23rd Street Brewery, try the beer sampler to get a taste of their samplings. And don't wear an O-State shirt. You'll get stared at.Handler the server. Pulled pork BBC, chicken pest pizza, mac n cheese, alone, meat loaf, chicken fried steak."], ["Brandy R.", "Decent beer and chill atmosphere."], ["Josh Y.", "This is a sorry excuse for a brewery.Those who feel this is a 3-4 star place, should get out more... well leave Kansas more. As we waited for our flight, which i passed by \u00a0as it sat on the bar on my way to the washroom, the waitress text'd and showed other people photos on her phone. There were 3 groups of people on the patio along with us and there were 3 recently empty tables. I know this because the waitress couldn't be bothered to clean up any of the tables. They sat that way the entire time we were there.Out of the 8 beers on the flight, 2 were decent. The waitress forgot one of the beers so we couldn't try it. She took forever to get us water and the check. She also never cleared any of the tables outside, which I am not a snob, but it was kinda gross. Anyone that likes to visit different breweries, avoid this place. It's not worth the effort."], ["Alexis R.", "Pretty good beer. \u00a0I love that they brew their own with inventive names and specialty beers rotated often. \u00a0Their menu offerings are varied but rather pricey for what you get. \u00a0$15 for chicken and a side. \u00a0Their pizza are a better option. \u00a0Plenty big for 2-3 people and only ~$10, the BBQ chicken is very tasty as is the Thai Chicken. \u00a0Their crust is great too. \u00a0Come after A pint is ~$4 but pitchers ($7) are cheap on Tuesday. The hummus is a good choice too are snacking. \u00a0This is a nice date place. Quiet enough to talk with nice ambiance. \u00a0They have extensive outdoor seating as well for chilling with friends."], ["Nicole E.", "I went here with a group of 7 and while the service could have been quicker, the food, drinks, and atmosphere were all well worth it!! \u00a0I had a martini because I\"m not much of a beer drinkers, but the beer drinkers around me were enjoying the selection and their drinks. \u00a0The apps were yummy and the mac and cheese awesome!! I'd highly recommend this as a stop if you're not in a hurry and want some good drinks and bar food."], ["Joseph L.", "I like this place. Was very busy when we went this weekend (just after a KU football game) but our server was very informative in telling us up front that it might take a little longer than usual for our food to arrive. She brought us free pub chips even though we didn't ask.I had the Bill Self pasta (good stuff), my girlfriend had the Naked Nachos (she loved them), her friend had the Fish & Chips (she was not a fan).The beer was cold and always delicious. You never fail with ordering Raspberry Wheat BeerFor any KU fan visiting Lawrence this is a great place to eat and drink at. Big enough to hold a lot of people so wait time for a table is never too long. I plan on going back more in the future."], ["David G.", "Guess what, there's another brewery in town and it's mighty fine.Ok, it's not as famous as the one downtown and doesn't get enough recognition because it's overshadowed by that 800 lb gorilla that everyone thinks of when they think of beer in Lawrence.. \u00a0I remember this location changing hands many times, most notably before it opened when the place was set to explode and they had to pour all the beer down the sewers of Lawrence. \u00a0Seeing the streets of Lawrence run with unconsumed beer caused a part of me to die that day. \u00a0A few years back this was the second location of 75th Street Brewery in Waldo and eventually they broke away and became a local establishment. \u00a0I missed the beer mug club and the KC Rewards card, but generally the move was the right thing.The place has lots of local flavor, pun intended. \u00a0You can get the Hank Booth Burger or a Bill Self. \u00a0I can't remember what the dishes are, but it's darn fun to go to a place that has sandwiches named after famous people. \u00a0It's definitely a sports bar with games playing on a variety of screens. \u00a0No Langston Hughes salad :(The highlight of the place is the beer. \u00a0It's really good beer! \u00a0Makes sense for a sports bar. \u00a0Decent variety , though it tends to be on the safe side. \u00a0I'd like to see them branch out into funkier beers that have a bit more character. \u00a0Vanilla Stout was probably the best beer I had there. \u00a0I've never been disappointed in the beers. \u00a0What I'd kill for is jalapeno beer in this town just once. \u00a0Food is typical bar food with a bit more variety. \u00a0My favorite is the fried pickles. \u00a0Sinfully delicious. \u00a0They are spears though and I prefer pickle chips. No big deal though. \u00a0I'm only allowed to have them when I've been really good. \u00a0Forget ice cream as an incentive: \u00a0mama's gotta have her fried pickles.The nachos are awesome too and they are EXTREMELY spicy with those fresh jalapenos on top. \u00a0You'll feel them a few days after and I won't go into more detail than that.They've got a new menu now that is about the friendliest I've seen to vegetarians. I'm waiting to try the peppers stuffed with couscous. \u00a0Typically I get a nice calzone there or the goat cheese salad. \u00a0Now, I'll most likely \u00a0get the new Local Burger veggie burger there they sell in partnership with Local Burger in town. \u00a0Mmmm. \u00a0Gotta get the pub chips with that! \u00a0I wonder if they'll name that one after me?Service is acceptable and can be spotty at times. \u00a0It's what I'd expect in a college town. \u00a0Some servers are awesome and some simply phone it in. \u00a0When I've complained on occasion, I've gotten a very accommodating response from the management. \u00a0Overall, expect great beer with an upscale bar menu that everyone can find something they like. \u00a0When you are looking for good food and beer in Lawrence, and don't want to wait an hour for a table, check out 23rd street and be sure to have them name the veggie burger after me."], ["Carolyn N.", "Stopped in for lunch on a Weds on the first day of my vacation...and I sure feel lucky. \u00a0Had the Thai Chicken Salad lunch special, delicious and the Bitter Professor IPA, outstanding!!! If I lived here this would definitely be my go to IPA, wish I could have had two..."], ["Jennifer H.", "My friend and I wanted to try a new place, and we settled on 23rd Street. The nachos were AMAZING. After those, I had to box my mac n cheese, but only after tasting it. Pretty good but not worth $11. Not even close. My side Caesar was a bit disappointing but not bad. Service was great, and the top shelf margaritas (on the rocks) were tasty but watered down. One of the reasons I wanted to go here was because they are listed on the Lawrence GiveBack page as a participating business. I was extremely disappointed when the server informed me that they no longer participate. I am much more comfortable spending money when part of it benefits a good cause."], ["Sarah S.", "Ah, 23rd Street Brewery. So hard for me to neglect for too long because I'm kind of a sucker for beer and pub food, plus it's the closest sit-down restaurant to our place. So we've been quite a few times over the past 2.5 years, and at this point I can give a pretty fair summary.The Good/Average:-Beer. No, it's not as good as Free State's, but honestly, I've never had a bad or undrinkable beer at 23rd. They also tend to be a little more creative with their styles -- for example, today they had a sweet oatmeal stout on tap, and they had a delicious saison on for most of the summer. Their regular lineup is also solid, if nothing crazy delicious. And I appreciate that you can order four ounce tasters.-TVs. This is a really good place to watch just about any game because there are TVs EVERYWHERE. In fact, this might also be a bad thing because I often get distracted when we're there just to eat...-Food. Again, it's nothing remarkable and not as good as Free State's, but it's solid across the board. I've had everything from the burger to the flat bread pizza and never been disappointed, and it's nice that they have a large menu. Definitely not gourmet, but it's a brewpub so I'm not sure what people expect. -Location. It's not downtown! So you can actually park with ease and almost always get a table right away. The Bad:-Service. I've never had a problem with a rude server, but unfortunately you are almost guaranteed to get exceedingly slow service, no matter what time of day you go. Today we went over lunch and it was far from busy, but it still took us over an hour to get out of there. Considering we ordered cold items, I'm not sure why there would be such a delay. Most of the servers give you sporadic attention and it often takes quite a while to have someone show up at your table. There was one really good server there for a while, but I haven't seen him lately and I'm afraid he's left. Moral of the story: if you're in a rush or you're very hungry, you're best off going somewhere else. It's the one downfall of 23rd Street, but unfortunately it's a pretty big downfall. -Prices. Seem a little high. I'd like to try the Bill Self, but the fact that it's $16 keeps me away from it. And the beers could probably be a little cheaper for what they are. Overall, I'd give 23rd Street 3.5 stars, and if their service got a little speedier it would definitely be a huge plus."], ["Sherie S.", "Food is always good here. \u00a0Ordered the tai salad with dressing on the side. \u00a0The salad was weird and bare because I did that. \u00a0(note to self) clients enjoyed their food and the ambiance. \u00a0Service was slow with clearing plates and getting us our check, though. \u00a0They didn't seem that busy."], ["Emily S.", "Food was fine. Tasty and well made. Traditional pub meats sports bar. Waitstaff was superb. Not overbearing or neglectful. We came on Saturday night and were seated (in a comfy booth) immediately. The atmosphere is kind of noisy but that's to be expected with the type of establishment. My husband thought it was chilly inside. I didn't. Pricing was a little high considering the type of food they sell. Fish and chips and a bratwurst and one beer gave us a $30 bill. All in all? A fine place. Didn't change my life."], ["Rich G.", "I' went to 23rd Street Brewery recently on a late Friday. I have to admit, I am impressed with their beers. I tried them several years ago, and the brew was distinctly average...not bad...just not interesting enough to make me drive across town.I tasted a few different varietals on this trip, and they were all solid examples of the style.The food is generic \"american grill\" fare, and nothing spectacular, but certainly just fine if you're there with a large group, or to watch a game on the gi-nor-mous TV(!).All-in-all, 23rd Street offers a solid, place to have a nice local-brewed pint and tasty pub grub."], ["Teresa P.", "Awesome. My first dining experience in Kansas (yohoho, I'm not in Cali anymore, homies), and it was great!Our server was amazing in accommodating the group of about 20 people. Service was fast, and we never had to ask for more chips or water. I ordered a side of the sweet potato fries, which were an insane deal. For $2.99, you get a HUGE basket of fries that could feed quite a few people. The salmon topped with sun dried tomato was amazing as well. The fish was grilled to a juicy perfection, and I loved the pretty grill marks. Good stuff, and would love to come back for more :)"], ["Bill B.", "Went back a year after prior review. \u00a0Encountered none of the prior problems. \u00a0Clearly changed for the better."], ["Clarice W.", "Standard pub fare with standard quality. Nothing flavorful, clean-tasting, or original. Extremely heavy - but they give you huge portions. You need a drink to wash this stuff down. Their beer is pretty good, but does not compare to Free State. Overall I'd say the food is an ounce better (their sweet potato fries are actually great), though by no means excellent. The interior is more pub-like and less crowded/noisy than Free State, a perk. I'd go to 23rd Street on a more low-key night for their fries and decent beer (save Free State for when you and your palate are in for a bolder beer adventure)."], ["Sarah K.", "The pub chips are really good, as well as the beer! Max's Mac & Cheese is delicious, and the servings are generous."], ["Brian M.", "First review after three trips. I've had trouble reviewing 23rd Street so far but have finally figured it out. I can review this place in nine words or less. Nothing sticks out. Nothing too good, nothing too bad. With this goes the caveat that I \u00a0have not yet tried all their beers, the ones I have tried have been good, tasty and typical.Food was average.I'd give them a middle of the road three stars but when I asked for a certain game to be put on the TV, the manager said that they only had basic cable and not the channel for which I was looking. Basic Cable in a sports bar/restaurant/pub! I wasn't looking for anything too obscure, we were talking about the playoffs!"]], "The Shack Bar & Grill": []}
