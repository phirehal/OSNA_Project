One of my new must haves is the Chicken Tikka appetizer, the tandoori roasted chicken breast chunks come out juicy and perfectly cooked each and every time. Complimentary Masala Nan that always comes with a little raita to dip into is always delicious. Both fish curries I have tried have been very good, and the Mattar Paneer is just as delicious as it was the first time I had it. The staff is friendly, but I do have one beef with the waiter, he kept interrupting the conversation we were having, over and over again, to ask if he could remove plates, often we were not quite done with them. It became highly annoying because of the frequency of the interruptions. Step back and let people enjoy their food and conversations, the plates can wait...One thing I miss a little here is ambiance, it does not feel like an Indian restaurant at all, some Indian music and some touches of color in the decor would make the place feel more cozy. I am not lowering my star rating because of the above minor issues, because the food is the star here, it does not disappoint. Another very nice touch is the fact that dessert is always graciously offered for free at the end of the meal, it changes from time to time, so we have got to try a few different things so far."], ["Aman S.", "The food was really good here, but the portions were a tad bit too small. \u00a0My family from India approved this place as the best indian food in miami so far. \u00a0I enjoyed it as well. \u00a0They only serve beer and wine though."], ["Michelle C.", "I love Indian food, it is my all time favorite and living on the Beach would love to have somewere to go for some good food.

The place is fantastic when it comes to decor, simple but colorful. I loved that each table had an individually potted fern, they were so cute and set a really zen mood, not so much romantic as it was comfortable. Usually Indian restaurants tend to get tacky with their decor, so I appreciated the modern touch that they gave the place.Now to the food. The menu seemed pricey, but noting that we were there for lunch, it came out at about 15 bucks a head which is certainly not bad for lunch for two at the beach. The lunch special includes an individual plate with some vegetables (cucumbers and tomatoes) a yogurt sauce, a flat-bread cone and two samosas. Then you get to pick up to 3 entrees samples to share with your partner. We also had a couple of beers, garlic naan, and the jalapeno crab cakes which boosted the price up. I wouldn't really bother with the last, they lacked in flavor and weren't spicy enough for me. But all and all it was a very pleasant experience. The owner personally came to our table and greeted my date who had been there previously, then he turned around and said \"I don't recognize you, is this your first time here?\".... gotta love a man who knows his clientele."], ["Katherine G.", "The lunch specials here are reliably good--flavorful and just the right amount of food to fill you up while leaving barely enough room for coffee.

I have taken out-of-town friends here as well, and they tried new foods and were quite pleased. Still, would it hurt for the owner/manager or staff to thank you when you leave?

I can't really say I know if this restaurants' food was authentic or not, but I can say that everything had amazing flavor and spice. As for the atmosphere, that is something they can work on.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of lamb; should've ordered chicken! Hehe. What I really didn't like was that I came across a bit of fat/bone in the lamb, and that's not pleasant. I don't know if that's to be expected in lamb dishes, but I didn't enjoy that detail. More important for my review is that the service was abysmal. We were sitting for about 10 minutes without anyone approaching our table. It was the hostess who finally took our drink order. Our server was aloof and indifferent. I don't expect anyone to fawn over me, but a modicum of enthusiasm or engagement with patrons would be nice. I don't care if this is South Beach; if you are too \"cool\" to truly wait on people, then you should not be a server. I want to say that I am not very picky when it comes to service either, so for me to point out lackluster service is kind of a big deal."], ["Didi M.", "Went last night with some friends and had great food.

While some fellow diners thought it was good, or even better maybe than their dishes, I still was not sure if it met my match. Why? Well, I had something similar at a Thai restaurant and it blew me away there. But Guru wasn't able to do the same with this similar dish.So was the money worth it? For a gourmand that cares about food and nothing else, then no, the money was not really worth it unless if you're used to eating $15 and up dishes that don't really call to your attention. However, the experience at the restaurant was made up for by friendly staff, nice ambience, and good presentation. Additionally, the portion was good enough for one person (reasonably speaking). This isn't really the type of restaurant you should intentionally try to avoid. You can still come here and have an enjoyable and good experience.It is definitely not the best Indian in Miami, and I'm not sure if it is the best in Miami Beach. On top of that, it is really a nice place to go for a romantic gathering - you probably will get plenty of privacy as this place wasn't really packed during the normal hours for the dinner rush."], ["Raquel E.", "I went out with my friends and husband...baby-less {yay me!!} \u00a0for a nice laid back dinner to Guru!

Indian food in South Beach! (That's 2 of the three stars.)I've lived here for a combined total of about 2 years now, and I had yet to order from Guru due to its exorbitant prices, and I was suspicious. When there's only one Indian place around, it doesn't really have anything to lose. People will go there if they want chicken tikka masala, and if they want it bad enough, they'll pay $16 a plate. Yesterday afternoon it dawned on me that the cupboards were bare, akin to old mother hubbard's cupboard. Dinner would be full of effort and most likely lack deliciousness. It was time for Guru.It was nearly 6pm when I placed the order, just around opening time for dinner at this establishment, and I was famished. My mouth watered at the thought of a smooth and spicy sauces and exotic spices combined with tender chicken and basmati rice. But in my $16 chicken tikka masala I found fairly dry clay-oven cooked tadoori chicken, and a pretty oily mild chili/tomato thick sauce. It was ready 15 minutes after I placed the order, and I think there may have been a little 'let's just use the leftover tandoori from lunch and throw some sauce on it' goin' on. Not sure, just saying the chicken was not tender, not freshly cooked steaming hot tasting. It satisfied my need for Indian, but next time I'll try the vindaloo. Something makes me think they would be more suited to this dish. Also on the menu was my favorite spinach pakora. As I've had it before, this is like flash-fried spinach leaves, like a wild medusa head. Served with a sweet brown chutney and a spicey green chili sauce, this is the only way to eat spinach. The spinach pakora turned out to be small hockey-puck shaped blocks of what appeared to be saag - balls of creamy spinach deep fried on the outside. They were squished and wet and cold in the middle and barely crisp on the outside. They did come with a chili sauce, but unfortunately it was more just a green cream with very little kick to it. And the paratha was pretty good. What else can I say. $30 got me my Indian fix for now, I could buy 6 Ethnic Gourmet Indian meals for that, and be almost as satisfied. Where's my spice at?! I think an indian restaurant with reasonable $7-10 entrees would be a hit around here, and maybe give Guru the kick in the butt they need to make sure every meal gets the attention the price deserves."], ["Lary R.", "Service is excellent!!

Highly recommended."], ["Naty K.", "Zaika is a very welcomed addition to the North Miami area, and Miami itself. \u00a0Like many other restaurants, there's a story behind this one. \u00a0It was opened by three former roommates after receiving positive feedback from guests dining at their house parties. \u00a0The food is mostly southern Indian, as the chef is from Bangalore, though you will also find southwest inspired dishes, like their black pepper seasoned dishes. \u00a0Located in a somewhat crowded shopping plaza, Zaika becomes extremely hard to get to in the afternoons, possibly due to their very reasonably priced lunch menu, drawing people near and far. \u00a0Though they do not offer a lunch buffet, for about $10, lunch consists of your choice of lentil soup or samosa, with an entree, naan, and basmati rice. \u00a0There are both vegetarian and meat options to choose from, to satisfy all palates. \u00a0Dinner entrees will set you back an average of $15-$20. \u00a0I came on two separate occasions, for dinner and for lunch. \u00a0Both times, service was consistent and attentive. \u00a0When I came for dinner with a friend, we decided to share an assortment of dishes. \u00a0We started with the Paneer Pakora, and moved on to the Garlic Naan, Kerala Pepper Chicken, and Lamb Roganjosh. \u00a0We also each ordered a mango lassi. \u00a0I have to say, this is one of the best mango lassis I have tasted. \u00a0It was very thick, with a strong, concentrated flavor of mango, whereas other places water it down, leaving you with a watery subtle flavor of mango.The waiter quickly arrived. \u00a0The Paneer Pakora was tasty, but what really made the dish was the mango chutney sauce on the side. \u00a0They also provide a decent portion of it, considering other places will only give you one or two pakoras. \u00a0The Garlic Naan had a subtle hint of garlic, so you didn't feel like your mouth was burning and pungent. \u00a0It was lightly buttered and hot, so that was a plus. \u00a0The Lamb Roganjosh was delicious, very rich, and aromatic. \u00a0The ginger was a nice addition, which I am not used to seeing, but it worked well with the other flavors such as coriander and tomato. \u00a0There was a good amount of lamb, and it was breaking apart due to the fact it was so tender. \u00a0A true delicacy! Next, came the Kerala Pepper Chicken. \u00a0This dish was also very aromatic and delicious. \u00a0It was a great accompaniment to the Naan, and complimented the lamb dish very well. \u00a0My friend, who is Indian, enjoyed the meal and said it was very close to the real thing back home. \u00a0Of course, we could not leave without having dessert, and the mango kulfi proved to be an excellent choice. \u00a0If you like mango lassi, then you will undoubtedly love this fragrant mango ice cream dessert. \u00a0It's to die for! Put it this way: when I came for lunch with another friend who does not like ice cream, I had to fight said person for the last few portions. \u00a0It's THAT good! So, for lunch, a week later, I ordered the lentil soup and chicken korma. \u00a0The korma was creamy and delicious, and my only complaint would be the soup. \u00a0Perhaps they're trying to put a modern spin on mulligatawny, but it seemed as if it was a watery pureed version of lentils with a slice of lemon thrown in. \u00a0It's something trivial though, certainly not enough to deduct a star, but I hope they will reconsider making it less watery in the future. \u00a0Though Bombay Darbar may have held the first place when it came to best Indian food in Miami, I think now Zaika is the place to beat!

Either overpriced or under spiced, I've always been underwhelmed by most of the options on hand.So far Zaika seems to help fill the void being reasonably priced and good quality, although time will tell as this was my first visit and almost all restaurants in Miami are notorious for starting out great then quickly fall apart.We started with apps, the chicken wings were OK but the sauce that accompanied it was outstanding, the Aloo Tikki was salty and nothing special, and the Paneer Pakora was OK as well but was made much better with the chutney that came with it.The main entrees were very good. I ordered the Zaika Kadale Lamb, my friends ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Kerala Pepper Chicken.My lamb was very good, meat was tender and level of heat was good, the Kerala Pepper Chicken was also very good and was a few bars higher on the heat scale but still maintained good flavor, but out of the three I'd say the Chicken Tikka Masala was the best overall which had depth of flavor that is usually lacking in most Indian joints in the area. We finished everything off with a Pista and a Mango Kulfi.Both were great, but the Pista was the clear winner with great pistachio flavor and rich creaminess.Service was also very good, the staff were very friendly and attentive.

I'm sure their menu items come quite spicy, as usual for Indian cuisine, if you don't specify anything different.

I haven't encountered many Indian or Middle Eastern restaurants here which is a shame, since I would eat it all the time if I could! Therefore, I was thrilled to see a new place open up nearby. Located in a strip mall, Zaika has some outdoor seating but is mostly setup indoors.The decor is charming, upscale, and makes you feel like you've left Miami for a bit. My only complaint with the set up is that some tables are close together, making it difficult to get between them.The food really is as good as it gets. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited, where there are several beer options but mostly wine on the drink menu. Our meal started with complimentary papadum, a crispy flat bread, with a tomato/onion based topping and a sweeter, green sauce to pile on top. It was filling enough that we didn't order naan too. \u00a0My friend and I came for dinner. We didn't make a reservation ahead of time, but many customers do. As soon as you walk in, the restaurant smells incredible. He ordered the Shrimp Biryani and I ordered the Palaak Paneer. There were several spinach based dishes but this is my favorite kind. There are vegetarian, beef, chicken, and some seafood options here, and they have a great lunch special which includes a soup or samosa with your entree. The portions are huge and equally delicious! My taste buds were so happy to finally find a place that fulfilled my spicy needs! \u00a0They have several dessert options, but we were full after our flavorful entrees. I will definitely be back here and am interested in ordering a few dishes next time to share with others.

Staff was wonderful. Everyone was attentive and helpful. They took the initiative to bring out extra hot sauce to ensure the heat in our dishes was to our liking (it was already great, but the hot sauce was so fantastic we ended up using quite a bit of it). At the end of our meal, we received a complimentary dessert -- a rice pudding with raisins and nuts. I thought it was very, very good (and I am not normally one who enjoys such desserts). \u00a0The atmosphere was great. Zaika is a nice, clean, airy restaurant. A great spot for a relaxed lunch. We started with the samosas. These had a perfectly crisp exterior. Inside was curried potatoes and peas. They were served with a tamarind dipping sauce. This was all super tasty. For entrees, we had chicken tikka masala. This was the best chicken tikka masala I've eaten. Wonderful flavors. The portion was also large, with a substantial amount of chicken. We also had vegetable korma. Another excellent choice, and the texture of the vegetables in the dish were spot-on. Neither soggy nor too crisp. Very happy with this as well. We ate this will onion kulcha (a bread stuffed with onions and cilantro). This was also quite good, though on a future visit I wouldn't need to get it again and would probably try a garlic naan. We ended up with plenty to take home . . . which we ate for dinner that night and loved it again. The reviews of Zaika have been exceptional, and as of this writing, are uniformly four or five stars (and mostly five). It makes perfect sense. Zaika is a wonderful choice. Can't wait to return.

We had: \u00a0the garlic naan (crispy with some cilantro), \u00a0samosas (tasty but not too heavy), \u00a0Prawn tikka masala (rich & creamy with the right herbs) \u00a0Chicken Karahi (chicken alone was epic, and the peppers & onions thicker gravy was smokey and strong and fit perfectly)Spoke with the chef and he was classically trained in Indian and Italian, so a proper background in herbs & tomatoes. He had that culinary fire in him... Go now before they get known and there's a line!"], ["Joanna C.", "After having our own experience at Zaika, I now see why they have 5 star reviews...their food and service are amazing!

Of all the Indian restaurants in Miami this is probably the best with regards to price. With regards to taste- the food matches up with any of the higher end Indian restaurants in brickell or coral gables. I went for lunch and it was a GREAT deal. Most lunch size entrees are $7.95 and it comes with more than enough food for one person. Not only do you get the entree but it also comes with rice and 1 Naan. Excellent price for lunch. At night, their entrees range from $12.95 - $17.95 depending on what type of entree you get - and each entree comes with rice as well!

I ordered the Salmon with Mango Sauce with a side of baked potatoes and a salad. The mango sauce was absolutely delicious with the salmon. It was an unexpected combination that tasted amazingly well together. They give you plenty of sauce to douse your salmon in and on they sprinkle friend plantain chips on top as well. I was expecting a whole baked potato when I ordered it as a side but it's actually a bunch of small potatoes with some very slight seasoning. Had to put a bit of salt on top to make them a bit more flavorful but I didn't mind. I also ordered a glass of Sangria. Not too impressed with it. Kind of tasted watered down. I've had better.

I also ordered traditional \"chicken tikka masala\" curry and garlic naan from their Indian menu. As far as prices, the tortilla \"bocadillo\" was about $6 (very reasonable price), the chicken tikka was $15 (slightly pricey), and the garlic naan was $2-3 (very reasonable price). The bocadillo was probably the worst that I've ever had. It was dry and tasted old and stale. Maybe I have higher standards because I had authentic bocadillos in Spain, but I was just not impressed. The garlic naan was absolutely delicious, and the chicken tikka was not bad, seeing as how this was first and foremost a Spanish restaurant. I'm not sure if it was worth the price, however ($15 is quite a lot for not amazing chicken tikka).I wish I could write 2 reviews for this restaurant for their different menus, because I would give their Spanish food 2 stars and their Indian food 4 stars, which is why I ultimately have this place a 3 :-/"], ["Julien A.", "Both the Spanish and the Indian menus are great.

I decided on 'Quebad' Indian Restaurant because it was a shorter drive and my go-to, Heelsha, didn't open for another hour. Here's why I should've waited --D\u00e9cor: Used to be quite charming with sari wrapped servers and hand-carved booths with silky curtains. Now it looks like it's been flooded to the ceiling by monsoon rains.Too casual and rundown to be charging $15-20 a plate. Menus: Seems like they were used to line a Bengal tiger's cage during a transatlantic voyage. Shortly after they arrived, a whole kindergarten math class practiced writing numbers on them. The frayed, stained menus are updated by scratching out old prices with pencil and writing in new ones. Classy. Restroom: The one part of an Indian restaurant that I don't want to be 'authentic' is the lavatory. It has the eye watering, nose blasting smell of an anti-moth genocide campaign. I don't know how I didn't step on 50 mothballs on my way from the urinal to the sink. After using the Candyman-esque bathroom, you don't want to eat, you want a Haz-Mat decontamination shower. Service: A note to the management, get rid of auto-tip. The staff behaves like South Asian reincarnations of Simon Cowell. Waited 15 minutes for water but, \"Be careful what you wish for.\" It finally arrived with a splash! \u00a0The server sprayed my face with so much water, I felt like R. Kelly's prom date. Mistakes happen, but then she just dropped some napkins on the table and shimmied away. I attempted to order just one dinner, but the server gave me a face like I offered to marry her ten year old daughter with a $5 bride price. I ordered two and here's what I got --Chai (spiced milk tea), Mango Lassi (yogurt drink), Mulligatawny (curry-spiced vegetable soup), Onion Chutney (sweet-fiery salsa), Rayta (savory yogurt dip), Papadum (chickpea cracker), Puri (fried bread), Naan (flatbread), Samosa (veggie hot pocket), Aloo Pakora (cauliflower fritter), Mixed Hot Pickle (death by spice and sodium), Biryani (basmati rice, cashews, golden raisins and green peas), Chicken Tikka (vibrantly red roasted chicken) and Jamun Gulab (Thai donuts in honey syrup)!A Tandoori For One, included 90% of the aforementioned items, why did I need two? I would've taken the leftovers but there's a strict \"no Indian or seafood\" policy for the office microwave. \u00a0The total was $35, I put in a $50 and didn't receive any change after waiting 10 minutes.

We ordered a bottle of wine, tandoori wings (appetizer), chicken korma, gajar halwa (dessert), and masala chai tea! Everything was devine. The papadam was fresh and crispy and served with two delicious sauces! The wings were juicy and finger licking good! The Korma was tender and flavorful! The service was excellent from start to finish. They re-corked our leftover wine, and gave me extra rice to take home with my leftovers! I can't wait to return! Next time I will try the samosas and the chicken tikka masala as the chicken is highly recommended on Short Order (New Times food blog).Edited 5/4/11...It's only been a week, but I had to go back! Tonight, I tried the Crab Samosas, Onion Kulcha (bread), and the Shrimp Biryani! Delish! Everything was tasty, and again, we had excellent service! I am going to have to introduce all my friends to this fantastic place!Edited 5/29/15...So I recently dined at the new location on Florida Avenue! It's nice and spacious! No more sitting on top of strangers and being bumped into by the staff! The service was a little rushed as I guess they are still in that habit from being in the small location. Go and have a nice relaxing meal in the new place! You won't regret it! Some of my favorite dishes are the butter chicken, chicken korma, fish Goan curry, shrimp Goan curry, tandoori wings (appetizer), and onion kulcha (bread)!

The staff is very nice and friendly. It's a very authentic place. I'm obsessed with the garlic naan and the chicken korma. This dish is perfect for beginners because the spice level is quite good. My friend ordered a lamb dish which was very yummy, but also spicy. We joked around the tonality made it look intimidating. She had never eaten Indian food either and also fell in love with the place. I also tried their mango ice cream. It was good, very different from what I expected when we ordered it.

I think Bombay Darbar has set the bar for excellence in regards to Indian food. I'm very pleased with the new location after noting the old location was a bit more low on space. While I had an equally tasty experience my first time, the decor of the new establishment and roominess enhanced the second trip by far. Previously, I had been lucky to walk in and get a table for four, but even though the new place is larger, I would still recommend calling to make a reservation. The food is just great, I had chicken tikka masala each time with garlic naan and received compliments on my leftovers the next day. I've also had the tandoori wings appetizer - they are small but delicious. I may venture back and try something new the next time, but the classics remain fabulous. Previously, we had a bit of trouble with splitting the check as the waiter became confused and a bit agitated when we requested different checks. This time, we were all very pleased with how accommodating the waiter was and he produced 4 separate checks for each of us.

I had bookmarked this place a while back but had not gotten a chance to visit. A lot of the Yelp reviews for their old location warned about the small restaurant and needing reservations. Now that they are in a new locale, I thought \"Eh, we'll be fine, I hear it's bigger.\" Well, I was wrong! \u00a0Yes, it is bigger, but the line was outside the door! \u00a0I was already excited knowing that this place really had to be as good as I had heard. I decided to make my way through the hungry crowd to see if there was a bar area and lo and behold, there was! And as luck would have it (thank you Buddha!) there were 2 seats available right smack at the center of their long and beautiful bar area. I quickly planted my butt on a seat and signaled over to Ralf. \u00a0Ha! Like I said, this place was super busy but luckily, we had Scott, who I can only described as the NICEST and most ATTENTIVE bartender I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. We waited quite a bit for him to take our drink order as he had a bar hand but no other bartender helping him out but when he finally got to us, he was all smiles, apologetic, and although Ralf wasn't planning on a beer, he gave him one due to the wait! How freaking sweet and awesome is that? So we were having our drinks, chatting it up, admiring the d\u00e9cor (the ornate ceiling is really beautiful) and enjoying our evening, We placed our food order and eagerly awaited as our senses were already being assaulted by all of the aromas emanating from the kitchen.We ordered the whole wheat Naan bread and the Chicken Tikka Masala (Medium Hot) and it was soooo good! \u00a0It was cooked to perfection and it had just the right amount of spice to it and the medium hot was just perfect. It had quite a kick to it but nothing you can't handle. The sauce was thicker than others I have had in the past so I suspect there was some cream in there which would explain why it tasted so decadent and delicious. The Whole Wheat Naan was sweet and complimented the sauce perfectly. An order comes with only 2 pieces but that was ok because we had the Basmati Rice as well which was more than enough for us. The food, d\u00e9cor, atmosphere and more importantly, the SERVICE (Thank you Scott!) was on point and will have me coming back here again and again when I am at the Grove. I was so impressed I asked to speak to the manager. I wanted to personally thank him for a great evening.

The aromatic basmati rice and the butter chicken are the happiest marriage of flavors in your mouth, although I can eat that rice alone and still feel pretty happy. My wine was delicious as well. Everything is inviting to enjoy Indian delicacies in this place. The bronze bowls they use to serve the food are so pretty you feel like taking them home after leaking the sauce off it.

Furthermore, i always have to tell the non-Indian hostess who takes my take out order than Saag Ghosh is a lamb dish because she cannot find it on her computer orders screen....because she doesn't know enough about Indian cuisine.

In fact, I think the move has made the experience even better.The staff/service are excellent, which is hard to come by in Miami. I can say that I genuinely like the people who work here, to the point that I am actually happy for their growing success. \u00a0Do call ahead and make a reservation unless you're comfortable just sitting at the bar (beer & wine only). The place is always busy. There is a good chance that you will not be able to get a table at all on any given night without a reservation ... or, you could just order takeout (allow for 45 minute prep time on busy nights).Every entree I've eaten here I've liked. I tend to favor the lamb and fish dishes over chicken. Favorites: masala lamb chops, channa masala (garbanzos in spices/sauce), mushroom masala, fish curry, lamb vindaloo (spicy), and tandoori chicken.

The previous location was so quaint and the service was always impeccable. - This may be a non sequitur, but when we sat down we immediately ordered wine. I didn't have to even look at the menu.

I had the lunch special.First off, the parking is bad. They chose a location where restaurants go to die, and parking is one of the reasons the location is cursed. You have to park on the street or in a garage.The restaurant is small and somewhat dark, with a huge Buddha statue near the door. The atmosphere could use some work. Seems clean.My friend and I had the lunch buffet. I can't recall all the dishes, but I will list a few.Condiments: raita, mango chutney, and yogurt sauce. There was also a tamarind sauce. They did not have any spicy condiments to liven up the food.Meat: curried lamb, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and a few other things I can't recall.They also had basmati rice, spinach pakoras, and vegetable samosas. They had some vegetarian dishes which didn't interest me.The only dessert on the buffet was a strange brown substance that tasted like cooked mashed squash. They offer more than one bread with lunch. We went with butter naan.The lunch buffet costs $16.95, which seems high considering what you get. The choices are limited, and you are stuck with mild seasoning, since most people are too wimpy to eat anything a baby can't swallow. Beverages cost extra (free refills). Lunch for two people will run you over $40. If the food were exceptional, I'd say that was fine, but it's not that great.The samosas and pakoras were a little cool. Personally, I prefer samosas right out of the fryer or whatever it is they use to cook them. They don't get better with age.I tried small portions of several entrees. They were good, but not great. When you eat Indian food, you want the tastes and aromas to jump out at you. The food at Taste Buds of India is somewhat subdued, as if they're using too many canned seasonings.The naan seemed a little heavy. I used to eat poori in New York's old 6th Street Indian restaurant row, and it was always hot and full of flavor. It's kind of hard to get excited about the naan I had today, when I know how good Indian bread can be. It also had bits of black stuff stuck to it in places. Not sure what that was.I tried the dessert. I would stay away from this stuff. I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but it's not good. Not very sweet, not much flavor, and there is an off taste to it which is hard to place.The waiters were very nice. Super helpful. Here is my verdict: they need to wake the food up. They also need to get rid of that strange dessert and substitute something like firni, which Americans will actually recognize as dessert. They should also improve the condiment selection and provide little containers for condiments so they can be moved to the table without piling them on the food.If they're going to charge $17 for a buffet, they should include a beverage. I may go back, and I may not. I hope they improve the food and take some of the gloom out of the atmosphere. And they need an \"OPEN\" sign. The place looks like it's closed. That will drive off half of the foot traffic."], ["Jocey R.", "Short version: Granted, I am not Indian, but everyone else that was dining there was, and thats a good sign. The food was delicious, the service was relaxed but not \"slow\" or inattentive. Go there!Long version: I was there on a Saturday afternoon and my companion and I were the only ones there at the time but then table after table of Indian families started coming in. We ordered the Eggplant Bharta lunch special and a Mixed Grill with chicken, lamb, pork, shrimp and onions.The lunch special came with a vegetable samosa, dal makhani, salad, rice and rice pudding for dessert, and the eggplant of course. It was a great deal, you get all that food for around $13 and it was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the rice pudding, I found it a little too sweet but thats just my taste. The mixed grill came with rice. It was tasty. The pork was a little bland for some reason but everything else was pretty good. They also served complimentary naan while you wait for your food. We had a total of 3 different young men who took care of us. I believe they can be categorized as the waiter, food runner and bus boy. All of which where very polite and attentive but the service is relaxed. They want you to linger and enjoy the experience. I also noticed that people where taking handfuls of these colorful looking seeds and chucking them into their mouths on they way out. Turns out those are candied spices and are meant to cleanse the palate and freshen your breath after eating (so I read anyway). I had a \"when in Rome\" moment and tried it.

I'm not sure I ever would have found it, otherwise.What appears to be a small-time ordinary Indian grocery store has a wonderful chaat cafe hidden in its back corner. It's definitely not a proper cafe in the traditional sense (minuscule dining room with just several bar stools at a counter, menu marked up on a dry-erase board, etc) I think a lot of the disgruntled Yelp reviewers here walked in with the expectation of dining at a traditional Indian restaurant (with waiters, a host, pleasant ambiance, quality service, filled water glasses etc.). WRONG: you're at a grocery store that happens to cater some food options in the back. As soon as you enter, tell them you're there to eat at the cafe (else they'll think you're there to shop at their store). They will direct to you to the back and show you their makeshift menu. The value meals are a STEAL. My mutton meal came with one large buttered naan and chole, curry rice and mutton curry, freshly chopped onions, and a mango juice drink. For $8, that is practically unheard of. My friend joined me and ordered an entree of Chicken Biryani. They brought out a mountain of biryani rice on a plate. I honestly can't remember the last time biryani tasted this good. I'm so grateful I got the chance to try out their samosa chaat as well: their samosas are ON POINT and by virtue of association, the samosa chaat is too - made with appropriate spice n' care! The two Latino gentlemen who prepare the food behind the counter are a delight to be around and really go the extra mile to satisfy your requests. On the other hand, the owner isn't exactly the friendliest guy in town - might even ignore you while he's there and might strike you as being curt as you try to interact with him while checking out. \u00a0 \u00a0I say it's worth it! Don't go here for all the things that make ordinary Indian places really expensive (ambiance, soft bollywood music playing in the background, lovely interior decor, stellar service, etc.). Come here for the good, cheap, quick, and simple FOOD, and I'm sure you will become a fan! PS: very easy to order take-out here. Watch out for their cafe hours.

Apparently that is the mantra at Spice N Curry, the Sweetwater shop that doubles as grocery store and \"chaat house\". The grocery store takes up the front of the building, and here you can find more than a thousand Indian items. Walking in and to your left you'll find beans, sauces (in liquid and powder form), spices, hot sauces, soups, creams, rice, etc. There is a cooler, as you move along, with vegetables and halal meats, as well as sodas and juices. The other side of the shop has teas, snacks, beauty products, incenses and religious items.Even though this is your best source of ingredients for cooking Indian food, there is also hot food being served in the back of the store. This would be the \"chaat house\" part of the business. The menu here is very simple. The is curry and there is biryani. Both come in three forms, vegetarian, chicken and goat. Aside from those dishes, there are vegetarian and chicken samosas, and kachori balls*.The simple menu attracts many people from around the area. According to the owner, whose name I think is Jamal, the menu hasn't changed in the six years they have been offering it. Why fix it if it ain't broken, he says. In this fashion, he's been able to serve students, Indian nationals, artists, politicians, anyone who can handle spicy food basically. The specialty is the biryani meal, a type of Indian \"arroz con pollo\" that uses curry and basmati rice. If you are hungry, or rather really hungry, you could order the curry meal. That brings rice, naan bread, and chana masala, plus a little chopped onion and tomato. All is very good, and very cheap. Nothing is made to order, everything may be frozen food or microwaved food, but it is all good and cheap, and the food tastes authentic. I certainly wouldn't be appalled to find out they use pre-made sauces or stuff, because the food is made right.But my reason to come here is because there are not many good Indian restaurants around, and even though this place only serves two dishes and some snacks, there is a vibe, some type of mysticism that floats around. I come, I eat, and rest, I talk to the people here, and I feel more in touch with myself and the universe. Weird as it sound, that is how it is for me.Namaste.*: Make sure to get the tamarind chutney for your snacks. Delicious.PS: If you plan on using a credit card to pay, there is a $10 minimum. In other words, get your food, and get something else to take home, or as a gift."], ["E J.", "Was very surprised by this little hole in the wall. The food is authentic and delicious!

My boyfriend tried my curry and said it was even better than his.

Going to Spice N Curry chaat house is a multi sensory delight. I love the smell of the spices and incense that hit you as you first open the door and walk in. I love perusing all the products in the market & being able to find items I can't find in conventional supermarkets - Lipton Red Label tea, Cadbury Flake bars, and of course all the Indian, British, and other foreign products. I love that every time I go, the place is filled with people who are actually from India - that must tell you something, right? - and love that I can hear Marathi or Hindi or whatever Indian language they are speaking. Best of all is that back counter where you can sit & order your takeaway, or eat your meal right there. I prefer the latter just for the experience. I like to imagine just for a few moments that I'm not in Miami, but have stopped off on some side-street in Mumbai for a bite to eat. And of course, there's the food. This is Indian comfort food at its best. Hot, savory, and a carnival of flavors to the senses. I always order the goat biryani because it's that good. It's Mumbai-style which is delicious. Rice with saffron, cardamom, cloves & more, with fall-off-the-bone meat... Amazing. Great samosas, too. You can pick up a cold beverage and sweets (ladoo, anyone?) in the refrigerators in the back. I need to veer away from these favorites and explore other menu items. I don't think anything is homemade - it's probably frozen food - but that's fine by me for this place. The portions are generous and the prices are remarkably low. One order of the biryani can feed two-three people, and is only 8 rupee - er, dollars! ;-) This comes with naan & a beverage. I wish the chai were not out of a machine, but it's good anyway & that's what it is for this kind of place - basic, unassuming, no-frills grocery store with a modest lunch counter for hungry patrons. Don't expect a restaurant with silverware, tablecloths, cloth napkins, etc. Everything is served on disposable plates/bowls. But for what it is, it is great if you want fast, hearty, delicious and affordable Indian food."], ["Laury P.", "I've been a loyal customer here at Spice and Curry for a matter of months now, and here's my review:- The place: I feel like a part of the store. Every time I walk in, starving (as most college students tend to be), I am treated as if I never left from my last meal. Jai and company have this wonderful diversity in their personalities. They bring life to what would otherwise be a quiet Indian grocery store. Whether it's the incense, the allure of the warm masala's prepared daily, or the lunch counter style of eating, I feel like this spot really has a social aspect to it. I NEVER speak to others during lunch at other restaurants, yet here, I \u00a0feel as if the others at the counter are not only sharing an incredible meal with me, but we're all brought together by the food, conversation, and atmosphere fostered by Jai and his team.Things may seem odd at first, but you'll soon open up to the idea of this place.- The Food: I know this is what you were all waiting for, my apologies for being so long winded! This is why I come here almost twice a week after all... I can't find a plate of food near my office that not only offers a hefty meal, but is only $7 ($8 for the goat, and it's definitely worth it)! Now aside from the economic value of a meal at Spice and Curry, you would be hard-pressed to find flavors as unique and exciting to the palette in Sweetwater as you would find here. If anything, Jai has done exactly what he intended to do with this little lunch counter; he has provided a window in to the food that he loves and the food that he so carefully prepares alongside his team.The beauty of all of this lies in the simplistic menu (which has never changed)! There's three main options: - Chicken Meal - Veggie Meal - Goat MealJai decides what he will make on any given day in the early morning. Whether it be Korma, Tikka, Chicken Kofta, the dreaded (yet loved) Vindaloo, Saag Paneer, Fenugreek and Potato, etc. any meal you order here will be delicious and filling.To wrap it all up, I'll summarize it as best as I can: The variety is what keeps me coming back time and time again. The flavors keep me excited and keen on learning and discovering more about Indian cuisine. Finally, Jai and his team give me that 30 min break from an otherwise hectic workday to unwind and relish the simple things in life... An excellent plate of food shared with strangers from all walks of life.- LP"], ["Romi C.", "The curry goat....The vegetable curry is also delicious but that goat..Very nice little spot with awesome products in every inch of the store.

Since I wasn't here for groceries I walked to the back and he pointed at the dry erase board that has the menu. I couldn't make up my mind so he recommended the mutton (goat meat) biryani . Words cannot describe how great this tasted. I've had plenty of Hispanic/Central American style goat stews and such in my day but this is by far the best goat I've ever had in my life. It is a must try item. Its served on rice and is cooked on the bone which adds a lot of extra flavor. Did I mention it's a huge portion? Well it is and it comes with a drink from the cooler for about $7.Round 2!

Sometimes they have given me the regular menu instead of the Thali menu, if this is the case don't worry, just ask for the Thali menu. Also, ask for the chutneys (sweet and spicy homemade jams) they don't usually serve them with your food unless you ask for it.The samosas (sort of empanadas) and desserts are excellent as well.

What used to be a family favorite has quickly collapsed into a hellscape of previously unseen proportions.Like other recent reviewers, we showed up for a delicious Indian meal. Unfortunately, the lack of service was not to be believed. After seating ourselves, we proceeded to wait 15 minutes before we even got a waiter - apparently the only one on duty - to come around and take our order. Not only was he completely unable to answer any questions about the menu, but he was completely incapable of speaking or comprehending any English, at all. When we asked him why he was the only one waiting tables, pointing to the other two waiters in the restaurant, he said they were \"training\". Training in this circumstance apparently meant wrapping place settings at the bar, for an hour.We finally proceeded to order our meals, thinking that at least the food couldn't be screwed up. Boy were we wrong. One hour later, we had gotten our papadam (after asking for it, numerous times), and our vegetable platter. None of our other dishes showed up, ever. This despite trying to get the attention of any waiter, or employee of the restaurant, countless times. Often we would hear the chime from the kitchen signaling that food was ready, but the waiters would do nothing. Towards the end, we saw them taking food from the kitchen and moving it behind the bar for up to 10 minutes at a time, before taking them to the tables. We may not have enjoyed our food at all, but at least we didn't have to eat cold food.After sitting there for an hour and fifteen minutes total, we decided enough was enough. One of the party brought the estimated amount we owed for the food we ate to the waiter at the bar, and we walked out. Interestingly, the waiter showed some real passion at out walking out - the only passion we saw that evening. Hopefully the couple who had just sat down heeded our advice and left as well. If not, I at least hope they've received their entrees by now.Too bad to see a fairly good restaurant completely destroyed by awful service.

Last time we went was on a Friday night and it was a disaster! The food was still good but they were training all new staff and there was only 1 waiter taking orders for a completely seated restaurant. First off, our order was not taken for approximately 20 minutes. It then took another hour after placing the order to get a bottle of wine that was ordered from the start. In fact, our wine and meal were served at the same time! Appetizers had already come and gone. No one knew what they were doing. The restaurant owner was too busy flirting with every table of women only or he saw our faces of dissatisfaction and purposely avoided our table. In a nearly three hour fiasco of delayed service, he never once came around to our table to ask how it was going... yeah right, that was a mistake! After the food was served, it was almost another 45 minutes to get a check and the only reason it was less time was that I got up and stood in front of the register until they rang me up! \u00a0Another set of patrons nearly walked off without paying because it had taken so long to receive the check. His exact words were \"You all seem very busy, I'll just come back and pay tomorrow.\" Honestly, unless I am going for lunch or takeout, I will not return.

I am just spoiled by the amazing-ness of Bombay Darbar.First off, I have to state that their breads are the weakest item on the menu. I love a nice fluffy naan, and sadly here at Mint Leaf it tends to be thin and overly crispy without much flavor. If I order a garlic naan, or garlic whatever for that matter, there BETTER be some fresh flavorful garlic in there.I do like the variety on their menu, it is quite extensive. The service is usually spot on, and the Bollywood videos playing on the TVs tends to provide lots of entertainment. The food is flavorful and the quality is very good, but they don't ramp up the spice the way I would like when asking for the spiciest it can get. Another minus, the rice is not included with your entree so you have to order it separately. I guess that wouldn't bother some people who are trying to cut out carbs or don't care for rice, but I personally need the rice to soak up all the sauce. They do make some pretty awesome fresh juices that compliment the food nicely and help with digestion too.

They strive to serve the most authentic Indian food possible, which is a huge plus considering that House of India, the other Indian restaurant by Miracle Mile, closed down.When I went for lunch last week, I was unsure of what to order, so I looked for a dish that would offer me a lot of food to sample. I ended up ordering the prawn and lamb lunch thali. For those of you who don't know, a thali is a meal served on a large platter with several bowls of different dishes, giving a balanced combination of nutrition, flavors, textures and colors. The dishes are eaten in any order you wish with rice and chapattis (the bread universally eaten in Indian homes). When I got my meal, the bread was soft and tender just the way I liked it. The prawns/shrimp were big and juicy, and the lamb was very meaty. However, I wish it was more tender because it was overly rough. \u00a0This thali definitely allowed me to taste the different flavors of Indian cuisine which was a huge plus. It was a feast for the senses. I just wish they had more naan bread because two slices isn't enough if you choose to dip and sample the food.For dessert, I ordered a kettle \u00a0mint tea, and it had a very relaxing taste. The water was the right temperature, and the scent of the mint tea was very soothing.The servers here are very on-point and always make sure they offer the best service possible.

It is beautiful how different Indian spices and extracts can have such an impact on a piece of meat. The spectrum of yellows, greens, and browns swirled into one and consumed my mind.

The only terrible thing to complain about would be...The service :( it was really really slow. yet this is not to say that they weren't friendly and nice. I loved my waiter, he was funny and tried his best to get us our food in a reasonable amount of time given that two employees had called in sick that day. The food...amazing! hands down the best Indian in Miami (it may be the only Indian in Miami). The naan was warm and buttery. It was eaten within seconds. The assortment of sauces that came with the naan were very colorful and delicious. \u00a0I ordered the murg vindaloo, supposedly one of the spicest options on their menu.

I congratulate the resturant with such a feat because this girl has the pickiest taste buds I have ever known. She could live on coco puffs for her whole life if she could. My father ordered the vegetable of the day, baingan bharta (excuse my spelling). Its a eggplant based dish. It was delicious as well!!! all around A+s and high fives.All set aside, here are some helpful tips for when you arrive at this restaurant. You must order your bread!! it is not included in the meal, neither are any side rices. If you want something, you must order it. Ask for suggestions! My waiter was a sweetheart and helped us order the right amount of food. The portions are pretty hefty, so you will want to share. Or, just take the leftovers home.

Waited an hour to get water and get out orders in. They then brought HALF of the entrees. Stayed like that for about 30 minutes. After that we just wanted to leave: good luck getting that check before you're hungry again. It appeared as though one waitress was carrying everything on her own, while the other guys just watched.

I often find myself having intense, insatiable cravings for it and I devour any that is placed within my reach. So it was only natural that my date suggest we have some for Valentine's dinner. Lo and behold, this was the perfect opportunity to give Mint Leaf my first try.Now, I think we all know that our Indian options in Miami are limited to say the least (I believe there was a talk thread about it at some point), so I've always heard mixed reviews about the Leaf. Regardless, I wanted to form an opinion based on my own personal experience. So after some debate and being that it was one of the few Indian restaurants left on my to-do list, we finally settled and made a reservation for two.When we first walked in, we were greeted by a very friendly host that bestowed me with a red rose. I was pleased with the environment; they had decorated the tables with rose petals and dimmed the lighting by placing candles all over, cute.When the server approached our table, it was blatantly obvious to my date and I that he was very inexperienced and quite nervous, so we tried to calm him down by assuring him we had both worked in the industry before and he had nothing to worry about. He asked for our drink orders and this is when we start with the problems: FIRST CARDINAL RULE, DO NOT ASSUME THE GUY MUST SAMPLE THE WINE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS THE ONE THAT MADE THE SELECTION AND PLACED THE ORDER. This isn't the 1950's and you never know when you're going to offend someone, and needless to say I was holding back my raging fit so much you'd think I had started swallowing the chili sauce by the spoonful.As the good aficionado that I am, I studied the menu prior to our visit and had concluded that the Maharaja Thalia (a platter that samples about six of their staple dishes) would be the best pick for the occasion considering this was my date's first Indian food experience. We also ordered some Naan, and Samosa and Tandoori chicken appetizers. The server was even clumsy at placing the orders and even though he asked a million times how we wanted the food brought to us, the timing was all off anyway. We asked for our food Extremely Hot... I didn't even have to drink my water.In conclusion, the food was mediocre and nothing to rave about. The service was pathetic and he even had the audacity to come ask us if everything was \"okay\" with an air of arrogance after we left him what we considered to be a very appropriate tip for his performance (and I'm usually a very generous tipper, so is my date, we've both been there and done that). The only reason why I'm not going with 2 here is because they put some effort into the whole \"Valentine's\" experience, the pricing was very reasonable (surprising factor) and I had a good time....otherwise I strongly suggest you go down the street to House of India and treat yourself to the all-you-can-eat buffet for $12, you'll be a lot more satisfied, that's a promise."], ["Lara d.", "This is as close to fine dining indian as we get around here. The staff are respectful and seem commited to making sure your experience is only the best. I love that they have complimentary sauces and relishes to go with your meal.

One of them just seemed to be onions soaked in sweet vinegar with an absolutely ungodly amount of red food coloring applied to it.I've eaten a lot of authentic Indian food in my day, including the spectrum from perfectly mediocre Americanized version to the real deal, knock my socks off dosa and chai in Tiruvannamalai, Tamal Nadu, India.

Once inside we were greeted right away, seated and given menus. One true sign of a good Indian restaurant is when you see people from India actually dining there. On this night, there was a group of 8 such folk.Just as I remembered, the staff here is good, service is adequate, but food takes a while to be delivered once you place your order. That was fine for us, as we hadn't seen each other in several months and had a lot of catching up to do. Once the appetizers and then the entrees were delivered, everything I'd ordered was really excellent! There are a few things to keep in mind when coming here: While this restaurant is relatively simple and unassuming looking, definitely nothing fancy or unusual, know that the food here isn't the most reasonably priced, just as other reviewers have pointed out. We each had an appetizer, an entree, an order of naan and drank 2 beers a piece. The total bill for the 2 of us came to $93.50. The other thing that one needs to be wary of here is that gratuity is included in the bill, though this is only indicated on the itemized check, not on the credit card receipt where it lists the total and has a separate line for you to add a tip. \u00a0Therefore, it's very easy to heap on an additional tip without realizing one is already included."], ["Aradhya T.", "We were here while on vacation in miami, after having fun in south beach we were craving for nice indian food and came here.

I also had a mango lassi (which was pretty good and not too sweet) and we tried the keer (rice pudding, very good flavor, refreshing and not too sweet) and the Gulab jamun (which was interesting, but way too sweet for me). Overall, excellent dinner. A lot of food for two people comes to about $50 total and we were stuffed both times and took some home the second time. It's hard to find that value in Miami.

This may very well be the absolute WORST restaurant i have ever eatin at in my 50 years of life!!! Absolutely terrible, total waste of money and i think they know it as a 15% gratuity is automatically added to your bill as well.

What i got given to me was a single burger cooked medium rare witha single piece of the fattiest undercooked bacon any pig would be embarassed to call his own, pickles and some kind of sauce that was literally either road tar or some severely used motor oil they called Guiness stout glaze sauce. Onion rings were average at best and abit soggy. My wife got the Irish dip, which was supposed to be thinly sliced roast beef, carmalized onions, crispy onion straws, \u00a0melted american cheese on a crispy garlic roll. What she got was some low grade roast beef that was barely warm and would be worse than the roast beef you would get in a banquet tv dinner, regular onions, soggy onion straws, melted american cheese (had to be packaged cheese as it looked fake) and some low quality Walmart untoasted white sub roll that has no idea of what garlic even smells like and some frozen run of the mill soggy fries. This is my first review here and i'm writing it for a reason! This place was a total waste of $35 and a vending machine with stale honey buns would be a much better place to eat.

Samosas at most restaurants are usually these big balls of breading with lots of grease, but Ayesha's were small triangles that were so good and just enough for two.Before that, the standard tomato and onion chutney was served with Papadum. It was the best chutney of its kind that I've had, a little bit spicier than usual, but I love spice.For main dishes, my husband ordered the Saag Paneer (spinach with cheese), which was flavorful, and I ordered the Chicken Korma (chunks of chicken in a tomato/yogurt sauce infused with spices, cashews and raisins). The Korma was fantastic. I ordered it spicy, not Indian spicy, but had to send it back because it wasn't spicy enough for me (my fault, not theirs). We also ordered the Eggplant Bharta, a dish that I have not been able to find in Miami. The dish was exceptional, a savory combination of grilled eggplant, and spices that make a thick stew-like offering. It was perfect for dipping our Garlic Naan -- also delightful. My only nit pick about Ayesha was their selection of wine by the glass. I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc that tasted stale. I wish they had a better selection.Another nice plus, when we asked to pack up our leftovers, the server added a portion of rice since we'd eaten all of ours. A pleasant and unexpected surprise!Overall the service was great, the food SUPERB, and the bill very reasonable. We are definitely going back. Our go-to place before had been Imlee in Pinecrest, but the food quality has gone down some recently and the service has always been lackluster. We also really liked Darbar Bombay in Coconut Grove, but I have to say Ayesha is now the winner.I highly recommend!"], ["Sheila T.", "\"lovely food and ambiance\"This is a small restaurant with a few outdoor tables in a strip mall, but it is simple elegance. There are white tablecloths, unusual wall textures, booths, small cozy tables, etc. The food is delicious.We had the chicken and lettuce leaf wrap appetizer wiith tamarind sauce. Papadam and tomato chutney come with every dinner. Then we had tandoori chicken accomapnied with rice and mint sauce, and baked eggplant with tomato sauce and spices. Even house wine was good.My suggestion to the restaurant is that they serve 1/2 orders of their vegetable dishes, instead of serving and pricing them as full entrees. They should offer a combination vegetable platter or combination dinners with meat and vegetables. All sauces are $2.50 additional except the ones that come with certain dishes. It would also be nice to have raita, mint sauce, and tamarind sauce served along with the papadam, at no extra cost to the customer.

It was served on a sizzler so it came out to the table still steaming. The whole meal ended up being very filling. All of the meat was very good and had a very unique taste.

Had a mix of pretty much everything - different types of naan, butter chicken, tandoori, samosas, tikka masala, I could go on and on. The butter chicken was the big winner of the night - the sauce was full of flavor and oh so creamy, and the chicken just melted in your mouth. The garlic naan was a nice pairing with the butter chicken since it kinda sorta helped your clean your plate. The samosas were also delicious, but sadly I've been spoiled by commercially prepared ones at Whole Foods so I kinda missed their sweet mango chutney on the side. Service was also very good. Staff was attentive and helpful with suggestions since it was our first time dining there.Sadly and most regrettably, 1 star taken away due to inescapable and overpowering smell that escorted us out the door and continued to stalk us for days to follow. I don't think I will ever eat here again unless I leave my handbag in the car, wear a shower cap, and discard my clothes (shoes included) on the way out. I know Indian cuisine is very.... aromatic? but this was just repulsive. My credit cards smelled like spices 2 days afterwards, as did the contents of my daughter's diaper bag. I wish they would figure out a better air filtration system to avoid this kind of thing.

The restaurant is quite big with plenty of tables inside. No outdoor seating available. The decor is simple. Nothing to write home about. We have had the butter chicken, lamb spinach, tandoori chicken, shrimp madras, cheese naan, and garlic naan. My favorites are the butter chicken which is chunks of chicken in a butter sauce and the cheese naan is da bomb. The tandoori chicken was a little dry for my taste and the lamb spinach got overwhelming after a few bites . Service is good never had any issues and the food comes out hot and fast. I love getting pieces of the cheese naan and dunking it in the butter chicken sauce. So tasty.

He often has cravings for Indian food. \u00a0We had the fried cheese and the Spinach and Paneer as appetizers. They were equally good. Not too greasy and the sauces that came with them were good. I'd say a spice of 2 out of 5 (I made up that scale). Next, I had the Butter Chicken. Wow! For the first time, I looove an Indian dish. It was delicious. Spice 2.5 of 5. Creamy. The rice was perfectly cooked. FYI, my husband and my friend were equally happy with their dishes (Lamb Vindaloo and a Spinach Chicken dish). My friend had the Chai tea (they don't have coffee) and she loved it. Said it was a mix of chai latte and hot chocolate when it came to texture. I had the mango mousse, which is actually more like ice cream...but tasted very good. It was similar to Kulfi. This meal, without alcohol was $110 for the 3 of us. Not cheap but not expensive (2 appy, 3 entrees, 1 tea and 1 dessert). We will definitely be back!"], ["Damian C.", "I don't know how any one not notice the smell, food was mediocre.

The fun starts after that we ordered Tandoori Platter and it was pathetic the chicken was so hard that we felt like we are eating chewing gum. We ate half of it only. The most disturbing part was that it was pretty expensive. The other dishes were OK. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Believing that great meals are a gift in life, to be savored amongst the many mediocre meals we consume, having an epic dining experience is paramount to nirvana. On our last visit to Aisha we learned that the owner also owns our favorite Indian restaurant of all-time, Saffron, in West Palm Beach. We were pleased to find that the food is of comparable quality and many of our menu favorites are present on this menu. I held off on leaving a review then to ensure that our excellent service and dining experience was the norm and not just a result of our conversation with the owner. So, feeling an itch for Indian, we decided today was the day. We called ahead to ensure we would not find a wait. We were pleased when the response was \"it's not too busy\". When we arrived, we were immediately greeted (owner was not in) and seated at a nicely adorned table. The waiters (yes, two) asked if they could leave the glasses for the boys or if we preferred plastic. This was a nice touch. Our menus were handed to us and our napkins gently placed in our laps. Water followed shortly thereafter as did our drink order. The restaurant is well lit, clean and sports a unique paint technique in multiple colors. There is a separate dining area for large parties, which is tastefully segregated. The dining area is of average size, but well laid out. Decorations are tasteful and help to set the theme for Indian cuisine. The chicken samosa appetizer may be one of the tastiest appetizers I've ever had. The lasooni gobi (cauliflower appetizer) is extraordinary. We followed these up with orders of butter chicken and chicken korma, which was an excellent recommendation from the wait staff. We also had orders of garlic, cheese and butter naan. Everything was amazing, and that is an understatement. The service here is second to none, truly. The owner came in towards the end of our dinner and immediately came to the table to greet us. It was a warm and kind exchange, as was every encounter with our wait staff.

You can have chicken, goat, shrimp or veggie.Next, the Doubles. \u00a0I just KNEW I was missing something eating Doubles that were a gift but nonetheless a day old. \u00a0The Doubles I had today were fluffy yellow rounds of hot deliciousness surrounding a perfectly seasoned chick pea mix with a mango sauce which was still moist (not having soaked overnight into the Doubles like I had eaten previously). \u00a0 I could just lay down and roll around on these little seasoned pillows of love.As usual with places I tend to frequent, it's more about the food than the ambiance. \u00a0And as usual, you don't find silver service table service at candlelit white tablecloth covered tables. \u00a0You won't even find a menu. \u00a0Food on offer is listed on a dry erase board on the back wall. \u00a0They have lots of island sodas and juices on offer.1 chicken Roti - $6.69 (including tax)1 Doubles - $1.62 (includes tax)Not getting a speeding ticket on the way back to the office - PricelessLocated in a strip mall behind the Dunkin Donuts on the West side of 441 just North of the Miami Gardens Drive intersection."], ["Sean M.", "I have been going to place on and off for over 15 years, usually I pass by if I \u00a0am going to the A/C mechanic in the same plaza..

I gobbled my Roti way before Gina could even finish her first half.Next, Gina let me have what's called a \"Double\". The only way I can explain it would be to picture God making an envelope of sweet, doughy, goodness, and filling it with some more sweet, saucy goodness. I think they make both the dough and and the inside of it with Sweet peas (hence, the \"doubles\").So good. I want more!

But then I realized-just because the majority has a certain opinion, that doesn't mean I have to alter my own. My opinion is that this place is not a great option for Indian food. As someone from the subcontinent, I have probably eaten in fifty different Indian/Pakistani restaurants in my life. And this was one of my more sub-average experiences.First of all, the place has no ambience or dine in capability. It is basically a food prep area on one side and a thin waiting area with some step stools on the other.A lack of ambience can be easily excused with awesome food. Well, honestly, the food was just ok. I ordered the chicken tikka platter, which is five pieces of chicken tikka with a side of salad or dal and a second side of rice or naan in a styrofoam box. The chicken tikka was very bland. The naan seemed very familiar.. Then I realized with almost certainty that it was the Kontas brand Greek flatbread from restaurant depot! It was not even naan! Okay. You can tell Miami has very few Indian people just by this fact; there's no way this would fly in New Jersey or Houston.To add to this, the price was $12.30. Well, I think the price is too much for basically take out food that I did not really enjoy. Most of the entrees are between $8 to $12. I usually spend that much at chipotle, jimmy johns, gyroville, whole foods, etc and the food is better too.The only reason I gave two stars is that the middle aged lean guy with long hair was pretty nice. He helped me with my selections. I feel bad to give low stars to nice people. But I feel worse when I go to restaurants that yelp rates high and they are just ok. So I tried to be fair and honest. As you can see by the rest of the reviews, the food is probably tasty from the American palate point of view. But if you are Indian/ Pakistani, I don't think it's a good idea."], ["George H.", "This is a great little spot. I usually get the tandoori chicken wrap that I think is awesome.

I've been burned by Indian heat before and was not sure how hot to go, so I went with medium. I will step up to the next heat the next time. The breads were fresh and the food was delivered quickly.

simple, to saucey or grilled Tandori style. \u00a0I am super happy with the quality of food and the great service. \u00a0But they charge for every little thing a la carte to the point I feel taken

and pepper shakers, since they probably charge for that too.) \u00a0Dinner for 2 with one drink each could easily run $80, without coffee or dessert. \u00a0That being said, it is the only negative comment I can make for Copper Chimney. \u00a0You get great food, for an arm and a leg... \u00a0After two visits, that makes is hard to go back since there are soooo many other places for great food,

with the entire family. \u00a0I read some reviews so I knew what to expect. \u00a0I read it was a little pricey but since I heard the food was good from some friends we decided to give it a try and the $2 coupon for $25 value from restaurant.com made up for the $$.We ordered grilled chicken something for our 3 kids to share...It was recommended by the waitress as being good for kids since it wasnt spicy....wifey order the chicken tikka something and I had the vegetarian sampler...regular naan, garlic naan, jasmine rice and jeera rice..2 of my 3 kids are picky eaters..but they enjoyed the food...good recommendation...the chicken came out almost like fajita style grilled on hot plate on top of \u00a0some shredded veggies. \u00a0They have never had naan before and I was telling them about it and they really liked it...whats not to like about good naan. \u00a0Wifey dish was ok. \u00a0I tried the sauce....Ive had better. \u00a0I would rate it as average. \u00a0She actually was against Indian food based on a past experience but I told her if she every tries good Indian food she would be a fan. \u00a0She said the dish was good, better than her past experience but she wasnt raving about it.My vegetarian sampler was just ok. \u00a0They were missing some items so they doubled down on the other items. \u00a0No complaints on the quantity. \u00a0I left full with left overs but I just didnt leave satisfied. \u00a0I was disappointed they didnt have a vegetarian curry sampler.Overall the service was good. \u00a0We were the only ones inside for dinner. \u00a0Granted it was early and people did show up eventually. \u00a0My son asked me why we were the only ones there. \u00a0I think it was a tuesday. \u00a0The server forgot to make the jeera rice which was fine because we didnt need it.The bill was over $90 with tip and came out to $70 something with the coupon. \u00a0I guess I would agree that its overpriced but not too bad considering it fed 5. \u00a0The kids chicken dish which was 6 pieces of chicken maybe 8 ounces with a bowl of rice was $19 bucks...wifeys dish was just ok....same price as other dish which I think is also overpriced for just being ok. \u00a0 My dish was ok for price vs quantity but was a little disappointed in missing items and was lacking flavor. \u00a0 Too much dry rub and not enough sauce. \u00a0It didnt taste and feel like I was eating Indian food. \u00a0Naan was excellent and the pompadoms and sauce was good. \u00a0 If they had a vegetarian curry sampler, I would consider going back for another try, but for that kind of money for a family of 5 there are a lot better choices IMO. \u00a0Without the coupon I dont know if I would even consider it. \u00a0FWIW none of the staff I saw were Indian which is unusual for an Indian restaurant. \u00a0From what I ate and saw, in comparison to GURU on South Beach, GURU puts this place to shame....the place looks like it has potential but I just wasnt satisfied. \u00a0I was really hoping this place would exceed my expectations based on recommendations and reviews and being so close to my neighborhood I had high hopes. \u00a0Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish...should I give

I had bengan bartha, which was outstanding, and cauliflower masala, which kept the cauliflower in whole florets, instead of a bit smashed around a bit, which isn't the way I really like it, but it was so delicious that I managed to overlook that, lol.The food was awesome, the service by a young lady from Minsk, Belarus, was superb, and I was really happy. The decor is probably what upscale restaurants look like in Indian cities, white vinyl banquettes and cushions, very modernistic in a black and white 80's way, no flocked wallpaper or bead curtains. A huge TV screen was playing Indian movies to round out the experience.It seems the meat and fish dishes are expensive, the veggie meal I had was really reasonable, with two glasses of wine included, the bill came to just over $40, which is more than I ought to be spending, but I decided that is my Christmas present to me!I highly recommend Copper Chimney, and I will be there next time I'm ready for a splurge."], ["Megan K.", "Probably the best Indian I have ever had!

I intend on going back soon to check out the buffet."], ["Luis M.", "It's a shame - I wanted to love this place so much and instead, it just left me flat.The food was just OK - nothing special. \u00a0I think the flavors were taken down several notches (not just heat, also spice) to appeal to the masses. \u00a0All I got was bland chicken, bland sauces, and crunchy, almost inedibly burnt naan."], ["Gordon G.", "All i can say is Sad! The waiters hair piece almost fell in our food, the menu is Thai and Indian. You can still smell the rotten beeer of the bar the place used to be, The food is good, not memorable or worth returning for. Go find a great place!"], ["Jagadesan R.", "So so...waitress too bad service.auto gratuity..so doesn't care for customer service.."], ["Roy M.", "On a positive note, the naan breads were good, veggie curries were decent and the czech waitress was sweet and obliging. My issue is that the shrimp dish I had was mediocre, and the chicken tandoori was downright tough. We sent it back, but were still charged for it. My wife specifically asked for \"no cilantro\" and it came loaded with it... worse - the headwaiter attempted to gloss over that, instead of obliging. Thali - please do grow up."], ["Christine K.", "I have been very impressed with the Indian food at Thali every time I have ordered for delivery or eaten in. Their dosas are spectacular, my favorite being the Mysore Masala Dosa which comes with a spiced potato filling and assorted chutneys. This is a giant crepe so it can be a meal for one or is also great for sharing. Another favorite is Chicken Tikka, which brings perfectly cooked chicken breast pieces out of the tandoor oven every time, they have an interesting variation on this in a Mint marinade as well. These two come accompanied by onions, lemon and some chutneys.If you want to try a few different things get the Thali meal which will bring lots of small versions of many of their currys and dahls. Get some version of Nan bread on the side. Drink Kingfisher beer with your meal. Order Gulab Jamun for dessert. Grab a handful of breath freshening seeds on your way out, from the platter at the door. What else could you ask for? It's perfection.Owner/manager is always very gracious and service has been very attentive on all visits. Only drawback is the space, which used to be a live music venue, it lacks in atmosphere and they always have three TV's going behind the bar. I would love if those got turned off and they invested a little more into Indian decor, (Maharaja style) but for now this is as good as it gets for Indian food on South Beach.Oh, and they do have a lunch buffet, which I have yet to try."], ["Joseluis A.", "thali, im so happy i found you. ive been eating dead animals like theres no tomorrow since i moved back to miami, but i had been craving a nice vegetarian meal for a while...i didnt know where to go for something vegetarian and substantial here in south beach until i found thali. i decided to check thali out after reading the positive reviews. the first time i was there it was for dinner. their menu is kinda interesting. its indian/thai. strange combination to say the very least but who am i to judge? like, seriously. second time i went to thali was for their lunch buffet and i thought it was a pretty awesome deal. for $11 you get to choose from many options, vegetarian and non vegetarian. they even brought me some chicken tandoori to my table without me even asking for it! sweet.i know i will be back to thali, probably for their lunch buffet!"], ["Katherine G.", "Thali comes very correct where Guru (down the street and closed for some time now) never did. Their lunch buffet is a great value. When I went yesterday with a friend just about everything I wanted was on the menu. Also, the meal comes with naan. The ambiance is nice, and the restaurant is spacious. It's a great mini getaway from the the office.Next time I have to go there even hungrier. :)"]]}
