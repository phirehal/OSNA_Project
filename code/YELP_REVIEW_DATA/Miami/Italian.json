{"Proof Pizza & Pasta": [["Danielle A.", "Love this restaurant. It was recommended to me by two fellow foodies, and their suggestions did not disappoint. I was mainly driven by the idea of eating a French Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich that I saw on Yelp, and all I want to do now is go every day to eat one. Pizza was great and so was the pasta and appetizers! Limited menu, just to the point so that you don't flood yourself with too many options that make it hard to finalize on meal options.I say go go go!"], ["Emmanuel O.", "The oxtail pizza is amazing, first time i've tried this, it's a must. \u00a0Good service and the brussel sprout salad is great."], ["T B.", "Had such a wonderful time here with my friends and were totally that obnoxious group when we came in. I think our reservation was for 6- we showed up with 12 and most of us came from the bar. Holy crap this place is amazing. The server handled our table super efficiently and had drinks for everyone before we knew it. The menu takes some time to look at and I think between us all we only missed one or two things on the menu. \u00a0The octopus- seriously like a dream. So super yummy. Bone marrow pizza. So. Fantastic. Fresh mozzarella. So tasty and warm with delicious focaccia. Bolognese was the favorite Desserts were all yummy and had huge portions! Everything was so great! Hats off to your kitchen and staff Proof! You rocked our world!!!"], ["Leilani D.", "This place is really top notch. I've been here a handful of times and because I made such good choices the first time around I've made pretty similar selections every time.If you go, which you should, get the gnocchi (little pillows of perfectly cooked heaven), the short rib pizza with black garlic (one of my top five favorite pizzas ever) and the ice cream sandwich macaroon they have that day (I've tried two - strawberry champagne and red velvet, both were amazing).While it's usually full, sitting outside is worth a little bit of wait. The outdoor area is really cute, quaint, and the perfect atmosphere for this delicious meal.On top of that, the service has also generally been excellent. Basically, this place hits it out of the park. One of my new favorites in the neighborhood!"], ["Emily R.", "I have a mixed review for proof pizza. I will try to give constructive feedback so the reader can make their own decision. Firstly, I like the decor. It has a very hip vibe. The acoustics in the dining room are a problem. I recommend the owners invest in some acoustic tiles for the ceiling and consider also adding carpet. The sound just bounces of the floor and ceiling and you have to shout to be heard. It really spoils the meal to be assaulted with amplified dining room sound. The gemelli pasta with the meat sauce is simply divine. The depth of the richly flavored sauce mixed with the lightness of the whipped ricotta created a sauce that is so good I wanted to lick the bowl. I was very disappointed I. The small size of the portion and that you don't offer complementary house bread with the entree. The food costs on pasta and house made bread are pennies, you can afford to give your patrons a portion than can satisfy an adult as an entree. You need to avoid the \" piss off\" factor when you skimp on portion size and fail to offer bread.The pizza sauce was a bit acidic. I would cut it with some sugar and take the salt content down about 5 notches. The sauce made the pizza inedible for us. These are easy fixes. I would like to go back when the kitchen works out these issues. The menu, albeit extremely limited is interesting \u00a0and it shows imagination and creativity in the kitchen.The best part of the meal was the olive oil cake with lemon curd and crushed pistachio nuts. The perfect balance of texture with the whipped cream and lemon curd contracted with the sponge and the crushed nuts for a perfect bite. It was beautifully plated and its a dessert I could eat again and again. The server was knowledgable and attentive."], ["Adriana M.", "Came here over the weekend. We didn't have to wait for a table and the service was fast. The waiter was eager to answer any questions we had about the menu. We decided to go with the margherita and the white pizza. I didn't try the margherita but according to my friends it was good. I had the white pizza and it tasted pretty good. We decided to finish off with the dark chocolate panna cotta which was delicious. We also got the macaroon with ice cream, but I wasn't a big fan of the pineapple ice cream. Overall, food and service were good."], ["Greyceli M.", "Proof is a cute place. It's almost a toned-down-3-notches upper east side joint.Servings are small and meant to be shared so don't go if you're selfish and/or one of the pigs from Spirited Away. We ordered the mozzarella and focaccia appetizer. Words nor pictures can do this plate justice. The mozzarella ball is the perfect amount of salty, fresh, and soft. If the focaccia were served in complimentary endless breadsticks fashion I would eat here every day until I die. The angel hair crab was delicious but I couldn't stop thinking about the mozzarella. Ox tail pizza was interesting. Since their pizzas are \"proofed\", the thin crust has a super airy feel, different from a typically baked thin crust pizza. Macaron dessert didn't impress me too much. Hopefully they'll add a little variety to the dessert menu."], ["Caio M.", "Tasty place, not cheap and not expensive. \u00a0Honest food. Small, quaint and great for a quick local pizza. \u00a0Try it out friends!"], ["Jonah K.", "Small place right near the shops at midtown, a great location, but not in the mess over there. We came for a weekend late lunch after I had gotten off a flight and this place was on the list and on my way home to Miami Beach. Tried a couple pizzas here, both were very good. The manager was very nice, and the service was prompt. I wouldn't put this in my top 5 pizza list for Miami, but I would put it in the top 10. I didn't try any pastas."], ["Jorge M.", "Good addition to Midtown Miami. I know you're probably saying that's what we need another pizza joint but this has homemade pasta made on premises. \u00a0Walking to this place you notice some real kewl artwork on the sides of the building. Once we walked in we were greeted right away and was asked if we wanted to seat inside or outside on the patio. We chose to seat inside. The server came right away and told us what the place was about and his favorite plates to get. We decided the start off with the grilled octopus. It was perfectly grilled and not to chewy. Also had a sauce that was made with the ink and a green salad on top. \u00a0We also had the burrata salad. Which is a ball of mozzarella with a creamy center with beets. We also ordered the house bread. Which is like a pizza but without the sauce or cheese. For entr\u00e9e we had the bow tie pasta with the meat bolognaise sauce and it was delicious. We also had the angel hair pasta with crabmeat. We also tried the Margarita pizza. It was good but would have like it a little more well done and thinner. Then for dessert we had the champagne and strawberry macaroon ice cream sandwich. It was really good. Place is small not to big inside and has beer and wine. Great service and food."], ["Mandy J.", "Great service and atmosphere. The ox tail pizza with caramelized onions was awesome! BBQ octopus was delicious and icecream sandwhich a must! Definitely will go again."], ["Barby M.", "We went to proof for our date night a couple of weeks ago, and we had a great experience! It was a beautiful night, so we sat outside in their patio area, which was very quaint and romantic. To start, we had a glass of wine and fresh mozzarella, which was absolutely perfect. We shared a margherita pizza, which was good, but not my style. It had a very \"smokey\" flavor, which I am not normally too keen on. The dessert was a chocolate cake-like thing with sea salt and caramel (Okay, the memory is a bit fuzzy on what it had in it), it was divine, whatever it was."], ["Caro D.", "I went to Proof on the recommendation of a friend who's last rec was a complete disaster. I took a chance on this Midtown spot because it was close, well-priced and willing to seat a table of 11 on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Proof knocked it out of the park. As a family, we made the mistake of each ordering individual plates. Once the plates started hitting the table a chorus of \"OOOO! wait, I want to try that\" forced us to go the sharing route. Between the burrata with arugula and beets, warm farro with duck proscuitto, shaved raw brussel sprouts with craisins and the lamb sausage with lentils (excellent), we split a menagerie of appetizers among the 11 of us.The octopus: grilled to perfection, tender, and rid of all the tough skin - sitting in a sauce of squid ink and salsa verde or something magical. Just magical. The selfish kids in our party (myself included) stuffed it down our throat so fast our parents just kind of looked at us in awe, and then ordered a second one just for them - and quickly understood. We picked the highlights from the pasta menu, and not a single dish was not exemplary: pappardelle with mushrooms and sherry, spicy angel hair pasta with crab, agnolotti stuffed with chestnuts and apples, and the home made gnocchi that was closer in tenderness to mashed potatoes than any sort of traditional pasta product. The dessert menu came and we just gave up and ordered two of each. The winning dessert was the lemon cake with olive oil, although the ice cream sandwiches made with macarons were worth noting because they were original and beautiful.Service was excellent, food was even better and the draft beer selection sedated my \"connoisseur\" cousins (I call them hipsters to piss them off). Would repeat, would recommend and I looked like a restaurant recommendation super star in front of my whole family."], ["Melissa P.", "I was so excited to check this place out. I bugged my husband for days! But the portions are small for the prices. The pasta (gemelli bolognese) I had was really delicious but so small. And the margarita and Salumi pizza were good but again small and just not satisfying for the price plus they charge you for the tab water and they don't give you any bread for starters. \u00a0I was kinda sad because I really wanted to like it! The service was very good! But the dessert was delicious!!But with so many pizza and pasta options... I guess it just didn't do it for me to go back."], ["Belinda B.", "Wednesday evening, we opted for bar seating. We were the only people at bar with John, the bartender. \u00a0John was pleasant and knowledgeable about menu. We enjoyed a good bottle of red wine and our meal based on his recommendations. Oxtail pizza - sweet caramelized onions and earthy shredded oxtails. John reminded us that everything is freshly made in the kitchen. \u00a0(there's an ox in the area right beyond the kitchen). The oxtail pizza is on the rich side and we asked for a salad to give our palate more balance. John suggested the red oak lettuce salad (hold the oak, heavy on the lettuce). Best salad ever! I may return just for the salad.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My friend and I shared the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich macaron. I am a chocolate chip lover and macaron lover and ice cream lover. We wanted to love this dessert but we had to deconstructed it to optimize the flavors. I enjoyed the oversized macarons. My friend enjoyed the ice cream.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We will return to try other menu items!"], ["Cherisse M.", "Awesome pizza and pasta! Quaint spot with friendly staff. Will definitely be back before returning to NYC for some more of the white mozzarella pizza."], ["A P.", "Great little find!Limited menu but several gems.Shaved brussel salad is excellent!So is oxtail pizza (ask for extra oxtail and crispy)!Down it all with Miami Weiss beer.Blueberry macaroon is the grand finale.Great value and service!"], ["Audrey G.", "The pizza was delicious, light and fresh ingredients, it tasted authentic. I had the White Pizza and highly recommend it. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. This is the best service I've seen in this area.

Even with the lack of ac it feels just like Europe lol. The live music on Friday was extra special. The pappardelle with lamb Ragu was the best I've ever had. Sangria was great too.

This place is so unique & one of Miami's best kept secrets...and mine!"], ["Mauro R.", "Soya e PomodoroLOCATIONRight in downtown Miami.AMBIANCEOpen space, industrial look, a mixed between some European places and some in the North-East USA (or Chicago). It's not about fancy here, it's about food.SERVICEService was good, nothing to complain about, attentive, timely without rushing us.FOODThe food is pretty good. If you come here I suggest you try their homemade pasta, any of them, depending on the ingredients you like. The homemade pasta is probably the main reason to come here. Strangely enough, the appetizers seem a little overpriced compared to the past dishes and even the entrees are well prices. If you are hungry try the stinco!The fazzoletti di pera e formaggio are a nice idea and it came out almost perfect. I am not sure the shrimps fit much into that, still it was a good dish.Overall the food is well cared for and nicely done.VALUEThe value is a good 7/10. Prices are not cheap, but not high either and the quality makes it worth.Final commentThe main issue with this place is the heat. There are fans but no air conditioning and for most part of the year you might find yourself uncomfortable, sweating while eating which to me is not a great combination. It really depends on how well you tolerate heat. I would definitely consider this place during winter months, but from May to September I am staying away, as I tolerate better the cold than the heat."], ["Sonia A.", "This a little, quaint, quirky restaurant in downtown Miami. My friend who is from the area, suggested it. The service was a bit disorganized, and they didn't speak good english. So minus one star for that. As for the food, it was pretty good, not amazing, but good. We get the Melanzan alla parmigiana as an appetizer, homemade gnocchi and lello. All good options to try. We got ice teas with fresh mint, which were a lovely addition. It's a nice Italian place to try, if you are in the area and you appreciate a very eclectic, yet comfy atmosphere that opens to the outside."], ["Marilyn M.", "I've caught myself day dreaming about the pasta hear at least 3 times this week alone. I really need to make my way over there soon!I've been here three and loved my pasta each time.The little purses of shrimp, cheese and pears are DIVINE as as the ravioli in walnut cream sauce. \u00a0Absolute perfection. \u00a0Cons: *Very hot and humid despite their efforts with the fans. Their pasta is THAT GOOD that Ill endure the sweat dripping down my face while eating a HOT dish on a hot day in a hot place. *We were ignored at the entrance both times we went. *The salad they bring out before your pasta is pretty boring.

Everything from the live italian music to the architecture makes you feel as though you are far, far away from Miami. This restaurant is in a hallway with fake clothes lines hanging from windows which gives you the feeling of eating in an alley way in Italy. Bookshelves with Shakespeare and other old books line the walls. As you can tell, the location and decor is stunning...but as for the service it was mediocre at best. I have now been here 3 times and every time service has been our one complaint. We were there for 15 minutes before even being asked if we want water and another 15 minutes for drinks and just as long for food. The food itself is a mix between out of this world and bellow average. I have gotten dishes such as the pasta with zucchini which was mehh and then the lamb which was ouuuuut of this world. I don't normally care for lamb but a friend of mine had it the last time we were here and I had to get it and it was by far the best lamb I have EVER had. Overall I'd say the service could be Improved and depending on the dish you get you can have a completely different experience than the person next to you. I would highlllly recommend this place for a date if that's what you are looking for because it is incredibly romantic and it's a trip to Rome \u00a0right across town. If it's not a date and you just want to have some good food and good service I'd probably choose else where."], ["Yoanka V.", "This place is in the middle of downtown Miami, it's a very different place to have an unique experience. \u00a0The food it's awesome and authentic , and the ambiance is good , decor its antique , parking space is a mission but ofcourse you are in Miami , so it's normal , if you have reservation try to get there with a lot of time to find parking , they have live music on Saturdays , the only thing \u00a0I didn't like its That \u00a0the restaurant doesn't have air conditioning ,it has fans and that can be uncomfortable , \u00a0also service it's very good, I will recommended if you want to feel that you are in a different country , for me a one time experience was enough :)"], ["Andre W.", "Such a lovely restaurant in downtown Miami!Me and my very good friend stopped by here as she mentioned it was one of her favorite restaurants in Miami since she moved there last summer. She also mentioned that they have live jazz on Friday evenings and she knows that I love jazz. We actually was there around 8:30 as we got to watch the band setup and kick the night off. The scenery of this place reminded me of a couple of places I visited in Rome as you are inside but it looks and feels like you are outside. the ceiling are very high and have really cool art on the walls along with dim lighting, but I felt like I was eating in an alley in Rome which was cool. The band had a lounge singer as part of the group and she was awesome. Very gorgeous smile as well as a gorgeous voice attached. We actually saw her when we came in as she was trying to get the host to tend to us, but owe just thought she was a regular patron LOL. Very nice crowd was here this evening and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves here.We started out with a bottle of pretty good sauvignon blanc along with cheese an olives plate. Lots of cheese and very little olives. I then ordered the Pappardelle Gambrel which was a huge amount of pasta with tomatoes and pistachio sauce with full shrimp on top...no the head and eyes were not cut off LOL. Very good dish but I liked her dish better as she got the Fazzoletti Formaggio which seemed a little like gnocchi. Our server Armando was awesome...he seemed more like a manager of the place though.

We ordered the Spinaci salad with chicken and the Pollo al Funghi (Chicken Scallopine with mushrooms). Both were fresh and tasty, however the chicken in the Scallopine was a wee bit overcooked which made it a little chewy. Overall, this is a great place for a casual affordable lunch.

This is one of the most unique dining and entertainment experiences I've had in Miami. The space is not so much a building as it is the space between buildings.

They offer live jazz which made it even more great.The furnishings are a hodgepodge of found antiques and curiosities. Somehow it all works to create one of the most romantic and unique spaces I've seen. The ramshackle kitchen puts out food that will remind you of an Italian mother telling you to \"mangia, mangia\".

The unfortunate thing that happened was that we had less people who ate and drank than planned/reserved and the last 2 of us guests got stuck paying for the few extra guests who didn't eat.

I absolutely loved every bite. The other two big hits at our table were the pene pasta & the broccoli soup. BUt sadly, not everyone enjoyed their meal.

This restaurant and food gets a 10 out of 10 from me and the service is amazing as well and very friendly and homey. The restaurant has a very rustic Italian feel to it and it makes you feel like you are at a very trendy restaurant on the coast of Italy. A+++++ from me."], ["Eddie D.", "Authentic and fresh. This rustic Italian restaurant tucked into an old downtown space never fails. The location was never meant to be a restaurant but it's super cool with lots of yesteryear character, including archways and super high ceilings. The food is equally full of character and taste.

The staff were all Italian, the service was good, the wine they recommended was great! We ordered a couple of items off the menu and a couple of chef's specials. All the dishes were excellent. \u00a0A dinner for 4 with a bottle of excellent wine cost us $125 and was worth every penny! \u00a0We went to Soya e Pomodoro for dinner on a Saturday night. \u00a0They had a band playing and they were very good. If you seat right next to them, it gets a bit loud and hard to talk. \u00a0And it's also best to make a reservation. The place does get packed.

Their mismatched chairs, Italian laundry hanging on the clothesline above, the menu in old leather cover, the books in the shelves, and that lone stool for the troubadour... and coupled with friendly staff and tasty al-dente pasta, I think I'm finally sold.I was told that the popular dish is the pear and cheese pasta (fazzoletti di formaggio e pera - $15), but honestly I thought that could be found in many other Italian places. Then I was confided that the staff's favorite dish was the eggplant pasta (paccheri melenzane e ricotta salata - $13). And upon tasting this dish which I had expected to be simple and plain (Vegetables and pasta? No meat? Really?), it ended up satisfying my tastebuds so much that I had wished there were more (even though I did get full after having my whole plate).Coupled with my glass of Chianti, and the saxophone tuning in with the guitar, I couldn't have asked for a better laid-back night anywhere in Miami.Funny how the stars for this place keeps growing since my first visit back in 2007 (they've actually been open for nine years now and still they remain on the down low)."], ["Carolyn F.", "This restaurant has great ambiance.

We had no reservation so we almost walked away but they managed to fit all 10 of us in a table fairly quick, so we stayed.Ill start the review by saying that the service is probably one of the best I have ever seen in Miami. These crazy italians clearly enjoy what they do. Maybe its because we had italian-speakers at the table..They offered us a deal, pay $30 per head and they would just bring food... and they did.... We had Burrata, eggplant and several tablas of prosciutto and cheese. Excellent.... oh and the bread? Oh-the-bread...For the main dish they brought these huge plates of Pasta... simple, but tasty. Cant complain. With house wine, beer, coffee and dessert we ended up spending about $50 per head, which is not bad at all.Will definitely go back... if I could I would give this place 4 1/2 stars, because I did feel the pasta's could have had a little bit more to them.

Easy, visit Soya & Pomodoro in Downtown Miami.

It seemed as though the host would have bet you we were not in Miami, from his clothing to the accent, we were convinced. We sat down inside and after speaking on how the setting itself is so refreshing and unlike Miami restaurants we began ordering some wine and appetizers. My wife ordered the pear filled pasta and I went with the Lamb shank and both were delicious, I had no problem finishing off both plates. With wine, a salad, 2 meals and tip we spent $70. I have already recommended this place to friends and family and plan on coming back soon! The only thing I would have changed was the level of the music, it was very loud; remember me mentioning it carried us in almost a block away? .....

Everyone there is italian and speaks italian. You think you are somewhere in Italy!!For lunch we had the Tortellini Arianna (Ricotta cheese, Spinach in a Tomato & Basil sauce) and the Bistecca alla Pizzaiola (Pan seared NY steak with fresh Tomatoes & Oregano, served with roasted potatoes and peas). The pasta was good but lacked a bit of cheese. The steak was good, a bit chewy but still good, topped with a nice tomato sauce with capers. The potatoes, roasted with rosemary, were delicious. The peas were ok.No dessert because our dishes were big enough. Both entrees served with a house salad first, it was a nice touch.Very nice, different italian place. Very charming and authentic food! Great place for lunch or dinner if you want to travel to Italy while staying in Miami!"], ["Meg r.", "Super wonderful find.

To all those complaining about the food: I have not ever, tasted anything more authentic, to Italian food, before I discovered this little spot in the dark streets of Downtown Miami. Owners are, like most Italians, so very-friendly and warming, they do know how to make you feel at home. They even took, my friend and I, on a tour of the place which in the past (20 years or so...) used to be a virtually Hollywood hidden gem for filming high-profile movies, as it, too, used to be a bank. So unique.The food is freshly prepared, made from scratch. They do take their time, but hey, find yourself a good companion and wait on.I would say the only downside is that they do charge a $2 fee (per person) on the busy evenings to support the live Jazz bands that come out and entertain you. But who would complain about jazzy nights, good company and excellent food.So, give it a try!"], ["Romi C.", "Very interesting ambiance. perfect place to get ugly before bumping uglies.It's humid and dank..no big swinging menu to roll your eyes at or annoying staff to interrupt your conversation..its not busting at the seams with Italianized Venezuelans having conversations with the restaurant- its just right. nice carpaccios, nice wines, nice live music.Unpretentious and charming. Very good place to take your flavor of the week and fool her into thinking you're more interesting than you really are, haha. Take notes."], ["Rodrigo G.", "You can't manufacture character.

A distinctly european vibe for people who appreciate la vie boheme."], ["Jacqueline B.", "My new favorite Italian spot downtown. Move over LaLoggia, you have some competition. I went with 3 friends. I had the penne pasta with spinach, mushrooms and mozzarella. Absolutely delicious. I wanted to lick the plate! (I didn't.) The portion was big enough to take some home. Friends had spaghetti with meatballs, fazzoletti with shrimp in a creme sauce (like pasta \"purses\" filled with cheese and pears) and lastly, the eggplant. The only complaint was that the eggplant didn't come with pasta. But everyone was thrilled with their choices.I love the ambiance. Having never been to Europe, Soyo has the look and feel of an Italian cafe. Or rather what I have seen in pictures! Yet, with the \"Miami\" experience of an outside Cuban cafe. It's an open air restaurant with no A/C but lots of fans. If you're a native, this won't bother you. If not, you may be a bit warm. The decorations are wonderful. The old-style archways, brightly colored paintings reminiscent of Haitian art, even up to a laundry line hanging way overheard, it's a cool, fun place to sit in and look around.We got there about 12:45p, and got the last table. The service was good, considering it was so busy. I see folks complaining about the service. Did he smile enough? Did they ask if all was ok? Did they refill my water glass without asking? Maybe not, so big deal. The food and atmosphere more than makes up for it.I hear Happy Hour is wonderful with live music. Can't wait to check it out."], ["Marty C.", "Couldn't decide where to eat on Thursday night, so my lady and I decided to go to the closest restaurant with the best yelp reviews. That brought us to Soya e Pomodoro right around the corner. The meal started kind of weird when the waitress said she wasn't sure where her chef was and made it sound like maybe he wasn't coming. She clarified and said he'd be in, so we just ordered the cheese plate and chilled until he came. All three cheeses were outstanding and brought me back to my favorite Italian store up north (why don't they have any good ones down here?). It was served with some shaved fennel, kalamata olives, and green spanish olives which was a nice touch. While the filet medallions with smoked mozz sounded pretty great, I would have rather seen it with gorgonzola, so I did a 180 and opted for the paccheri melanzane (tube pasta with eggplant and pomodoro sauce). It was delicous and covered in aged ricotta cheese. It was indeed al-dente, but could have actually used a couple more minutes in the water. Girlfriend got the porcini mushroom ravioli and it was outstanding. Creamy but not heavy-- really well balanced. \u00a0Overall you can't beat the vibe of this spot. You will be hard pressed to find another restaurant in the downtown core that has better ambiance AND food. I definitely recommend checking it out and will be back myself to try something new."], ["Lisa K.", "Live music and delicious food with a really cool ambiance.

My wife and i really love the ambiance as well as the food.I would have given this place a higher score however i feel there is room for some improvement. While having dinner we ordered \u00a0a bottle of red wine., now we go often to this place and the last time we thought it was just a mistake., the bottle of red wine is always chilled. This is excellent for white wine but for red wine is not good.Additionally i felt our waiter service was not on par with the owners which i think is great!

They have some very strange hours and days that they are open. Voila, we pulled up and they had just opened. Our waitress told us we could sit anywhere and the kitchen would not open for about fifteen minutes. No biggie, they had an art exhibit throughout the hallway of the building. We ordered a very reasonable good bottle of wine and walked around enjoying the exhibit. The wine list is very small but good prices. I found it interesting that they had wine from Italy, Spain, France, Argentina, etc....but yet no American wines. The decor of this restaurant is so different from anything else I have seen around here. It is located in an old bank building basically tables lined up in the hallway of the arch of the building. Books align the walls, with some cool art pieces. What I found so cool, is that every single table had different chairs around them. As we sat there I could not help but to take in all the great vibe. You felt like you were in another country. Relaxing and very comfortable. My only thought was during our peak season heat, although they have fans, I can not imagine sitting out there with no AC. Our waitress brought over the menu's, so cute, soft brown leather and the menu is very small. I immediately spotted an eggplant appetizer, so of course being my favorite I had to give it a try. A few minutes later a basket of bread and the eggplant arrived. The Pomodoro sauce was perfect, and the eggplant was exactly how I like it, light and flavorful. I highly recommend this dish. Next was our entree's, hubby ordered the spaghetti bolognese, and I chose the Orchiette with clams in a light white wine sauce. Both of our dishes were flavorful and very good. Now, I must say I am a huge salt lover, to the point where for most people comment on how much salt I use. Having said that my dish had so much salt in it where believe it or not it was almost to much for me. Hubby was kind enough to switch plates with me. Do not get me wrong both dishes were great just a bit much on the salt. I found that their pasta dishes were pretty authentic, simple, with very good flavor. Now I will say for the price, I will admit the portions are quite small. We had an appetizer and one pasta dish each. We did not leave hungry but we were not full either. Reason for the four stars was the service was very good, the ambiance terrific, and the quality of the food very good. Looking forward to going back and trying other dishes. Eclectic kinda place. We were there early so as far as the live band I can not comment on."], ["Stephanie G.", "Soya continues to serve the freshest and most delicious Italian food and salads on my side of Downtown.

Sure they have fans, but with this miami weather and after a few glasses of cheap wine, I thought I would faint. The food is good though, albeit a bit pricey.

It's the busboys and the owner who are courteous. :)I had to start that way, but it's my only reservation about Soya. One of my havens from a busy schedule, it's a hideaway from deadlines and stress. The pastas are wonderful and come with a small salad. My other go-to is the steak salad or the Nicole salad (with salmon). Everything tastes healthy, fresh, and delicious, and while not inexpensive, is a decent value for the price. I am definitely a fan and love coming here to unwind and actually have a conversation. It's my way of pretending to be European, if only for the lunch hour.

Now I know I wear glasses but It was rather dark, I could have been having dinner with Hugh Jackman- or maybe that was the wine? \u00a0;)  \u00a0I had a delightful time at this restaurant.

The waitress was very busy but managed to stay pleasant. \u00a0 She is probably slammed with things to do because when asked for a latte on ice she warned me that she would be bringing the latte but that I would have to put the ice on it myself. \u00a0I was happy to assist her in this very difficult, time consuming task. \u00a0Luckily, \u00a0they have an assistant /bussboy that will bring things like extra ice and salt.

The decor is a mixture of old world alley (think Rome), art gallery and hip bookstore. The owners are actually Italian, which is a breath of fresh air in Miami, and the food they serve shows it. The menu is simple, but adequate, and prices are average for Miami. With a bottle of wine and two dinner entrees, our bill came to $73.00 with tax and tip. My favorite dish of the night was the fazzoletti di formaggio e pera, cute little pasta purses in a gorgeous cream sauce. Better half ordered the orecchiette vongole e zucchini, which was lacking in flavor and the sauce was very thin. The service is very slow, it took about 20 minutes to get dinner menus because they had ran out (too many guests). We also never received a tiramisu that we ordered because the waitress forgot, and it took another 10 minutes or so to get the bill after reminding her and cancelling the dessert.

I was definitely expecting some authentic Italian at this point... The first time we saw our server was when she came up to us and asked \"are you ready to order?\" .. No introduction, no hello, no talk about specials, or asking us if we had any questions or wanted bread.. nothing. She did ask us though at one point if we wanted more water. Hmm it's 80 degrees in Miami and we are eating huge plates of pasta, but please, no water refills, I'd like to instead sit here and die of thirst. I could have sworn most servers just fill up the water without asking. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a rhetorical question.  My BF and I were surprised at how boring the menu options were. We settled on the cavatelli pancetta and the spaghetti bolognese. Serving sides were good, prices were definitely reasonable, but the dishes were sub-par at BEST. The cavatelli had no taste, hardly any pancetta, and the saffron sauce was really bland. I dumped as much salt and pepper on it as I could handle but nothing helped the dish. It tasted like a Lean Cuisine... considering how small the menu is, I was surprised they hadn't mastered every dish, or at least had better options. The bolognese was definitely the better of the two, but also similar to my favorite Lean Cuisine. Actually I'm lying, Lean Cuisine is much better. The bread was the best part of the meal. We asked for our left overs to be wrapped up and asked for the bill. On the way out, we realized we never got our left overs. We go back in, and no one has any idea what we are talking about. They offer to give us dessert, panna cotta, as compensation. . great, our least favorite dessert. We go home, open the box, and see that they actually gave us tiramisu. Best mistake of the night! Yay! Except it had WAYY too much cream topping. Good flavor though. I found a lady finger eventually...Going to this restaurant is like meeting the sexiest man of your dreams then realizing after the first date he brings nothing to the table whatsoever.. but you give him one more chance to impress you anyway, since he's at least nice to look at.

The restaurant itself is huge, which was good because it helped accommodate the long line of people waiting to be seated. There was a good amount of patio seating outside, and then most people were waiting inside near the bakery cases where you can pick up things to-go. Our party of 8 was seated after a short wait and we immediately got started with the baked brie. It was out of this world -- coming from someone who is not a huge fan of brie. I can't stop thinking about how delicious the appetizer was -- the puff pastry combined with the warm cheese and fruit definitely satisfied the taste buds. The complimentary bruschetta was perfect -- the tomato mixture was addicting and the bread was soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.For my entree, I had the gnocchi with pink sauce -- the texture of the gnocchi was perfect, melting in my mouth, and the sauce was creamy without being too heavy.To reiterate: the baked brie was definitely the highlight of my meal and I will be going back to Perricone's, especially to have more of that brie."], ["Nicole S.", "This is my favorite Italian restaurant. Everything tastes very fresh. You can't go wrong with anything you get. It's all amazing. I've been to this restaurant over 10 times. It's simply the best. All tables get bruschetta and bread to start. The bruschetta flavor is out of this world! Freshness throughout. My family got a few appetizers to share: fried calamari and zucchini straws, baked Brie en croute and we made the pasta dish Fiocchi Gorgonzola an appetizer for the table. You really can't go wrong with what you order. The Brie is amazing. Very good portion size of cheese and comes with apples and grapes and crackers. The Fiocchi has a creamy filling and in a creamy sauce. Very tasty, but can be very heavy if you eat it all yourself (that hasn't stopped me in the past). I got the chicken Parmesan as my meal. The amount of food and quality is incredible. Their pomodoro sauce is homemade and has lots of flavor. It comes with a side of pasta. We shared three desserts for the table, the tiramisu (my personal favorite), banana cake and chocolate truffle mousse cake. Everything was devoured."], ["Raye T.", "Saw the reviews so I had to try. Ordered the jumbo lobster ravioli in pink sauce. Was amazing. Ate it all which is something I rarely do with American servings. I even had ice cream after cause it was that awesome.

Overall was a great experience and best one I've had since coming to America for 2 weeks."], ["Andi T.", "Went here during the week this time. This time we were seated outside by the fountain. It was very noisy as we were in the area with the live music. The server was amazing. She was always there when we needed her, polite and served everything in a timely manner.Split the Brie appetizer with two others and split a bottle of Zinfandel wine as well. The Brie was probably one of the best appetizers that I've ever had. I had the rotisserie 1/2 chicken special for my entr\u00e9e. I think it was a bit overpriced for chicken and ended up eating it over the next few days. The mashed potatoes that came with the entree were phenomenal- I just want to make babies with them. It sucks that I enjoyed the sides better than the chicken. Next time I will stick to apps & wine."], ["Hernani A.", "Iove their tiesday sandwiches two for one! Perfect if you work in the area!

The food at the restaurant is always amazing! I have never been disappointed by any item on the menu; to the contrary, I've always been surprised that even on Pasta Thursdays the dishes are fresh and delicious. The servers and staff are mostly very pleasant. We did have a situation once with the owner that kind of left a bad taste in our mouths but we chalked it up to him maybe having a bad day. Basically we had a group of us go there for a birthday luncheon and he was very adamant that there wasn't enough space to accommodate all of us at the same table, when literally all it took was pushing a couple tables together. It's not that it couldn't be done... He just wasn't willing to. We ended up winning that one though. Desserts are to die for, both in the restaurant and at the marketplace out front. Marketplace gets a bit crowded sometimes so just be patient.

The front of the restaurant it's a small mini market for wines, cheeses, and desserts. It has a very rustic look, similar to an old bodega. As soon as we were seated our waitress came to introduce herself and get our drink orders. She was very pleasant and recommended plates off the menu. I ordered the Fiocchi Gorgonzola - ITS A MUST TRY! It come with walnuts, not a fan of nuts in my pasta, so next time I will do without the nuts.FYI tables are extremely small, specially if you're in a party of four!

My parents, my boyfriend & I came here for Valentine's day celebration. When it came to food there was a definite must that my dad suggested that we order and it's their Baked Brie. This was one of the most delicious food I have ever tasted. Baked to perfection with their apricot sauce, crusted in brown sugar served with various fruits & crackers. You slice it open and the perfectly velvety smooth brie just melts out of its pastry crust... I mean wow. This was a great great great place just because of this baked brie. Their food, although expensive, was also great. Pasta was aldente and their menu offered a variety of food. But their pasta sauces lacked that WOW factor. It wasn't memorable, nor was their chocolate cake. The staff was very attentive to us and made sure we had a great experience. I will come back here for sure just for the baked brie, and just eat somewhere else for a main course."], ["Lisa C.", "Absolutely AMAZING meal! Wonderful GLUTEN FREE options!

They have an a la carte omelette station. A pizza and pasta station and a meat station. They even have clams and mussels and stone crab. A nice variety of cheese and cured meat. Also focaccia bread. The only station I didn't like was the dessert station, they were tasteless. They need to step it up on that.

You have to try their Romeo and Juliet strawberry Rosemary drink, ridiculous! Who knew combining Rosemary and strawberry would taste so good?

The selection for food was PHENOMENAL. And its BUFFET STYLE!! This was my second time here, and I was still blown away. Last time I was blown away with the crab legs they had at the seafood bar. This time I found that there was lamb on the menu... what more can you ask for?? Oh wait, don't tell me... there's a gourmet omelette bar! The cook at the omelette bar was not only a self-claimed (and self-proven) greatest omelette maker ever, but he also offered sooo many delicious choices for ingredients (like SMOKED SALMON). It was the best omelette ever created. And if all this wasnt enough to convince you to come for their brunch, then perhaps the amazing cannolis, pastries, and belgian waffles with ICE CREAM on top can change your mind. They also have a mouthwatering selection of cured meats and fancy cheeses. Everything from the melt-in-your-mouth lamb, to even the bottle of olive oil and balsamic at each table, was of highest quality and taste."], ["Amy B.", "After a group event - food and drink were good.

Finally we got his attention and reminded him about water, wine, bread to start, and he seemed to have gotten annoyed. After that he just had a scowl on his face the entire time he served us. He kind of slammed our dishes down on the table, made no eye contact, and had a foul look the whole time. The pizza appetizer he literally tossed onto our table and walked off. It was a very awkward experience to say the least, we felt very unwanted and unwelcome. We were almost a little apprehensive to eat our food. He never came back again to check on us. Each time we needed anything we had to flag him down as he was running past our table. Whatever we did eat however was delicious. We ordered the seafood linguini, chicken parm and penne arriabiatta. The burrata and prosciutto were also delicious! Ambiance is very chic, the acrobatic wine sommelier is a nice touch. We were celebrating a special occasion but the waiter put everyone in a really sour mood. Really wish the service was also good so that we could've enjoyed the delicious food and ambiance!

If you are like most people, you probably instantly thought of the soft, fluffy pizza-type bread that has been popularized in Italian restaurants all around the world. If that is the case, I have news for you: real focaccia, the kind that was invented hundreds of years ago in the Ligurian town of Recco, has nothing to do with this fluffy version. Recco-style focaccia actually consists of two incredibly thin layers of dough stuffed with dreamy melted cheese, and it is one of those delicacies that is very rarely seen outside of Italy. Fortunately, if you live in Miami you too can enjoy this unique dish thanks to Riviera Focacceria, a new Ligurian restaurant that opened in Midtown Shops a couple of months ago.If you go to Riviera Focacceria, you absolutely must have the Focaccia di Recco. It would simply be a crime not to. The traditional cheese one is filled with stracchino, a tasty soft cheese that is so unique and important in the production of the dish, that it is flown weekly directly from Italy. A couple of months ago, I was lucky to try the original dish in Recco, so I was a bit skeptical before having it again in Miami, thinking that it would never be the same as my experience in Italy. I am happy to report that it is exactly the same, and this is thanks to Massimo Travaglini, the Geneva-born Master Focaccere and Executive Chef of the restaurant, who specializes not only in this unique focaccia, but also, in traditional dishes from the Northern Italian region of Liguria. The great thing about this place is that they have different types of focaccia, including one with ham (Focaccia con Cotto) and one with Genovese pesto, a sauce made with local organic sweet basil, pine nuts, parmigan cheese, garlic and Ligurian extra virgin olive oil. Normally, I would have gone for the pesto one in a heartbeat, but given that my boyfriend cannot stand the smell of garlic and having it would have meant having to be at least 3 ft. away from him the rest of the night, I decided to go for the traditional cheese one instead. This turned out to be a great choice and a win-win for both of us. Just like the focaccia, the rest of the menu is also top notch. Since the place is also known for its homemade and always fresh pasta, I went for the Pansoti al Sugo di Noci, a light dumpling filled with spinach, ricotta cheese, chards and spices and than served with a delicate walnut sauce, which also turned out to be a perfect choice. The sauce was so creamy and cheesy that I ended up scraping my plate with the fork to enjoy every last bit!Despite my initial pre-judgement, I was quite impressed with my experience at Riviera Focacceria. This place is as authentic as you can get in the states, and it is most definitely a new addition to my list of favorite Italian restaurants in Miami."], ["Abigail B.", "My husband and I went to Riviera this past Friday evening using a Gilt deal that included a bottle of wine, an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert. We loved the high ceiling, industrial look of the restaurant. We were seated inside, and had friendly, attentive service throughout. We ordered muscles for an app- yummy, and even better when we soaked the croutons in the sauce at the bottom. I had seared tuna- very fresh. He had beef ravioli, which he said was amazing. We then shared a Nutella tart for dessert- the crust was SO buttery and crumbly... dangerous lol \u00a0We will be back!"], ["MICHELLE C.", "Casual decor, not wild about the set up in the dining area. They have a walk up counter area when you first walk in with various types of Foccacia if you are lucky enough to get some. \u00a0They run our very quickly. I did like the open kitchen but felt like the dining area looked more like a cafeteria. Our server was a very young girl and she was basically in another world throughout our dining experience. \u00a0She was sweet but honestly had no clue how to serve. \u00a0This was a huge turn off for us. We started with a decent bottle of wine and a meat and cheese platter. \u00a0It was very good and they have really nice tasting Foccacia. \u00a0But again when we ordered more we waited 20 minutes to get a few pieces. The three of us ordered three pasta dishes. I found the portions to be on the smaller side. The pasta was all overcooked.. No complaints on the flavor, as all of our dishes were tasty. Prices are on the upper side for such a casual restaurant. \u00a0Portions are small and service was just not very good. Way to much competition of Italian restaurants to have me wanting to go back.

Filled with Stracchino cheese imported from Italy. In between 2 layers of very thin dough you'll find a deliciously melted cheese. Perfection! \u00a0Truly original and delicious. Only the finest ingredients. The wine list is not only very good but bottle prices very reasonable. We ordered the Spaghettoni with Rag\u00fa Genovese. Wow is all I can say. A thicker spaghetti, perfectly cooked al dente with the absolutely most delicious meat sauce aka Rag\u00fa. Hearty, meaty and quality ingredients equal a palate pleasing meal. Also had the Baccala Vegia Zena - a delicious pice of grilled cod, in a tomato sauce with an absolutely wonderful symphony of Taggiasca olives, potatoes, and capers in a tomato sauce. Normally a salty dish if not prepped properly but this kitchen got it right. Finished the meal with a perfect espresso and the Sacripantina for dessert. A moist sponge cake layered with chocolate and vanilla creme. It was refreshing, not too sweet and just plain different from any other dessert I've ever had.

Kudos if they mention an ingredient on their menu that you overlook when ordering and I'm allergic to, so they take care to not use it.You know my baseline measurement for an Italian place is their caprese and Riviera doesn't disppont. The greens seemed fresh, heirloom tomatoes plentiful and mozzarella cheese served cubed instead of the typical slice. My next favorite dish was their pannacotta. Garnished with mint and berries, and drizzled in a cherry sauce, the vanilla base was deliciously bouncy, creamy and sweet. My main course was a pasta with more tomato slices as well as a marinara sauce. However, it was a little oily with the olive oil added. That was my bad in asking for oil.Bread came in a cloth bag, \u00a0with a nice variety of baguette and sesame seed rolls. I had to ask for balsamic vinegar to dip the bread in, since it wasnt provided table side. However, once brought it was rich and subtly sweet.

I have never had the opportunity to taste the food of my people until now. O M G .. Bread. Of course. Why shouldn't the featured dish be bread? And it is the thing that greed is made of. I just couldn't stop eating it. As for the pasta dishes, in the Miami market some may seem inventive (see Dreamy Walnut Sauce), but they are very typical to the small town in which this cuisine is based. The pesto is unlike any other local pesto. There is no grittiness or separation to it like so many of its imitators. It's funny, that in Italy even after a meal of wine, bread, and pasta, you never feel overstuffed. The dishes here carry that same lightness. The owners and much of the staff are from Genova as well and are happy to discuss their home over a glass of super dry prosecco."], ["Katy P.", "I am going to start this review my admitting that I am not a big pasta eater, but when my family wanted to try out this new restaurant in Midtown I was in, and boy am I glad I went. It was hands down one of the best and most satisfying meals that I have had in Miami. The food was fresh and homemade, and the service was flawless. I would go again and again.For the first course we started with one of the biggest reasons why people folk to this restaurant - their Focaccia di Recco - two layers of incredibly thin dogh filled with imported stracchino cheese. Warning: Once you try you will be hooked. We also tried their Focaccia de Recco con Pesto, which is made with their deliciously homemade pesto sauce.And even if pesto sauce isn't your thing I highly recommend you try their Mandilli di Seta al Pesto. Their handkerchief style pasta with authentic pesto cause (made with organic sweet basil, pine nuts, a touch of garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and Parmigiano cheese) is out of this world. I literally couldn't stop eating it.And for those who don't want to venture into the pesto then try their Pansoti al Sugo di Noci - pasta that is stuffed with spinach, ricotta cheese, chard, Italian herbs, spices, and Parmigiano cheese. Or their Polpo Riviera - a lighter option with octopus, diced potato, celery, olives, cherry tomato, topped with extra virgin olive oil.And, last but certainly not least, the dessert. We tried their Sacripantina and Mousse di Pistacchio. Both of them are so incredibly delicious you wont be able to put your spoon down.If this hasn't made you incredibly hungry then there may be something wrong with your palate."], ["Ivan G.", "This was my third time in riviera. The first time it was amazing the service was quick and well executed and the pasta was balanced, hearty and expertly cooked. The focaccia was delicious. My second time was disappointed the handkerchief pasta was soggy, the sauce overbearing and cold and the service was ok. On this occasion I went with a group of three other friends. I would not be returning to Riviera. The server was lost as to the menu. My pasta was soggy and overcooked and the sauce was rather tasteless, it was a mixture between baby food and tomato paste. My friends dishes did not fare better the tagliatelle was overcooked and the sauce crummy, the seafood pasta was disappointing and the seafood of poor quality."], ["Mill R.", "Food was excellent and service was nice and extremely helpful on providing good recommendations!!"], ["Valberta G.", "Wow..both my boo and I was super disappointed in our dinner. My boo barely touched his dish because it smelled super fishy and mines, well, had an almost unpleasant odor to it. On top of that, lol, we had no idea it was a grand opening that night. Super busy, we waited about 10 or 15 minutes for a table. Once seated we looked over the menu and everything looked good. I ordered the Ravioli Genovesi al Tocco which was \"homemade ravioli filled with braised Angus brisket, chard, spinach, Parmigiano cheese, marjoram in a 5 hours slowly cooked beef tomato sauce\". My other half ordered the Tagliolini del Mar which was homemade tagliolini with Ligurian style seafood ragu. Before the main food arrived we ordered the Riviera Focacceria bread with cheese for an app. It was pretty delicious and freshly baked.So finally my dish came but NOT my boo's. WTH?? Then immediately the smell of the brisket had a weird odor to it. So I tasted one and it was edible. But the odor itself was super powerful. But how come my baby's food didn't come out yet. Apparently it was craziness in the kitchen. So finally my baby's food finally came out...after I finished my meal which was like 30 minutes later, smh. \u00a0When the food arrived immediately already he could smell the strong fishiness to the dish. I tasted a little of the food, omg, wow, no...uh uh...heck no...you could not barely taste the other ingredients. Something was wrong where you can literally taste the \"ocean\". You can couldn't taste the other flavorings of the dish. He barely finished the dinner and pushed it aside.

Being from DC with a healthy number of wonderful Italian restaurant's I've been in search for good true Italian since moving. Finally I found it!

Just because of their name don't think its all foccacia - besides it's amazing. They have a strong menu featuring homemade pastas with beautiful sauces as well as stand alone main \"secondi\" dishes. In two nights I've had the black squid ink pasta filled with cod as well as the roasted beef. Both were absolutely amazing. Even better, the staff is absolutely impeccable being quite attentive and ultra friendly. They truly operate on whatever your desire they'll do their best to accomodate.Of course with any new restaurant there will be times when things are not great. Their timing at this point can be a bit prolonged but they are working hard and fast to become acclimated.

Our server Paul was friendly, welcoming and really attentive-- he recommended delicious plates as well as a great glass of Vermentino wine. The owner, a legit Italian man from Recco, was super nice and came by to check on us a few time. The best part of the evening came after we paid the check, when Paul, our server, showed up with a little Nutella tart for my sister. We had told him that my sister was at home because she just had a baby, and he remembered and sent her dessert as a congrats on the new baby gift! That just made the whole experience that much more special. It was really thoughtful and prompted me to write this review.

The sauce was a creamy pesto sauce that was delicate and complimented the gnocchi perfectly.

We skipped ordering any starters to save room for the dessert. \u00a0After a brief struggle over what to choose, we decided to share the Tiramisu. \u00a0Again, it was light and yummy.

This dish is plate-licking delicious. \u00a0For the entrees, the agnolotti with meat sauce and the fresh fettuccine with mushrooms are both bursting with flavors. I do find the fresh pasta a little softer than I prefer so maybe next time I'd tried the hard pasta to see if it's more al dente. Their wine list is, naturally, composed mostly of Italian wine, especially from the region of Piemonte. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable. \u00a0An Aramone is $60 a bottle, and this wine, even the less expensive labels, goes for $30 or so. \u00a0Other wines are about $30 -$40 a bottle, so the mark up is about double rather than the standard triple. \u00a0I highly recommend getting some wine while you dine here. \u00a0Not to mention that you can trust the owner to give you good recommendations."], ["Julie M.", "I'll get to the point - why 4 stars instead of 5?

He always orders it whenever on a menu and has tasted his fair share all over the world. He knows when it's good. He said this was en par with the best ones he's ever had in his life. I know skirt steak, vegetables and potatoes is not a normal thing to order at an italian place and I was worried I should have gone for something more traditional. Let me tell you I am so glad I ordered it. The steak was melt in your mouth perfection. Seasoned perfectly and most importantly cooked beautifully. It was the epitome of a prime example of what a medium rare steak should be. The potatoes were crisp and light. The veggies still in good texture but earthy. I heard everyone around me raving about the food. I've lived next door for quite some time and cannot believe it took me so long to come here. It was truly spectacular. I've yet to try the pasta but so far with what I tasted this is right up there with Fratelli Milano (if not better) and easily destroys any other italian restaurant I've been to in Miami.

Upon arrival, we were surprise that the place is actually smaller than what we anticipated. \u00a0The sign by the door read \"Capacity of 45\", but even that \u00a0looks like and generous number. \u00a0 \u00a0We were lucky that they had available a table for 2 and we were seated immediately. \u00a0A waiter came quickly and brought us the menus and the wine list. \u00a0Bread and butter came a few minutes later. \u00a0 At first glance the menu shows a variety of \u00a0antipasti, salads and appetizers. \u00a0The only soup in the menu is the soup of the day. \u00a0 Additional selections of pastas , risotto, meat and chicken dishes were listed.The wine selection is mostly compose of Italian wines, and a few spaniard and american wines as well.We had not finish reading the menu when another person approach our table and offer to tell us about the specials of the day, \u00a0We listen carefully to the soup of the day; and the other choices such Osso Bucco with champagne risotto, and fresh snapper. \u00a0I must confess that we both thought that the italian accent of our waiter was a bit funny, almost borderline ridiculous to be a real accent , \u00a0but what the heck; this could be an opportunity to remember our trip to Italy and we might even get to practice our rusty italian.After a few questions about the daily specials we \u00a0accepted their suggestion for a crab cake as an appetizer and order a bottle of sevignon blanc \u00a0from Uruguay. \u00a0 \u00a0 Both excellent choices as the crab cake was cooked to order and was fresh and light. \u00a0The crab cake came on a bed of arugula and grated parmesan cheese sprinkled over with balsamic vinegar . The wine was properly chilled and was crisp and fruity, a good complement for the appetizers.For our main course we ordered spinach ravioli with tomato three way and Fagottino di Pollo ( chicken breast stuffed with asparagus and fontina cheese with a rosemary red wine sauce ) . \u00a0 The main course took a while to come, during which time we drank most of the wine, ate all the bread and watch the interaction of the waiters with the patrons.During the 10 to 15 minutes that we waited for our meal to come, we saw two birthday celebrations. \u00a0 All the \u00a0waiters came to the table with a canoli desert and a lighted candle , to sign happy birthday in italian ( Tanti Auguri ). \u00a0We also noticed how the restaurant personnel is very alert and fast in cleaning tables to accommodate the \u00a0people waiting to be seated. \u00a0 \u00a0Since the restaurants is very small, people waiting for a table must do so outside where \u00a0a few chairs are available. \u00a0 Those waiting outside are offered a complimentary glass of wine as a \"thank you\" for waiting. \u00a0 This is a nice gesture which will pay dividends in the form of repeat customers.Finally our meals arrived and we were offered some additional parmesan cheese and fresh pepper , which is always \u00a0a welcome idea. \u00a0The Ravioli with three tomatoes is nothing more than a way to present the pasta dish with tomatoes sauce, fresh cherry tomatoes and sun-dried tomatoes. \u00a0 We were not impress with the dish, but rather surprise at how the combination of the spinach ravioli and tomatoes came together in a nice taste.The second meal was chicken breast stuffed with asparagus and fontina cheese. \u00a0The chicken was presented in small cut sizes and with fresh cooked vegetables and fried potatoes, \u00a0The vegetables were cooked well \u00a0with the right combination of being fully cooked while at the same retaining crispiness and flavor . \u00a0 I recommend this dish if you don't want to eat pasta.I rate this restaurant 8 out 10, \u00a0I must come back and try different items front the menu to give a more solid opinion of the food. \u00a0I believe the restaurant is on the right path of success as I experienced first hand the high level of service by the staff and management. \u00a0We saw how many of the patrons were repeat customers, many of them already on a first name basis.It is a pleasure to see how a restaurant can prosper with good food and the right attitude.Thank you for accompanying \u00a0me on this journey. \u00a0Bob Appetite  \u00a0 if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."]], "Fratelli Milano": [["Vera A.", "Excellent!

No, and neither should you."], ["Navene S.", "Came here for dinner and had a good experience. We ordered the traditional bruchetta for an apetizer which was delicious very light and flavorful. For the entr\u00e9es we ordered the seafood pasta and the filet mignon pasta. They were both good, I preferred the filet mignon pasta. However, I did feel that the dishes were very salty. So much so that I couldnt finish my seafood pasta. For dessert we ordered penna cotta (one of my fav desserts, so I had high expectations) and it was very very good. It was very thick and rich and the cream on top tasted very fresh. Loved the floural design with different sauces, it allows for trying the penna cotta with different flavors such as chocolate, lime, and strawberry.Overall, nice place, nice atmosphere and good food. I want to come back and try their pizza and more dessert!"], ["Alana A.", "Incredible!You probably wouldn't think much of it when passing by.

The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce, the sauce, the sauce - amazing! Soooo creamy and flavorful, it was mind blowing. For the first time in my life, I devoured the entire plate of pasta. Yum!I didn't have the pear pasta but I will definitely be trying it next time! My colleague had it and he loved it and it's the most popular plate here.Service was great and prices were pretty decent, especially considering how amazing the food is. Service was excellent as well.Tip: On weekdays, try to get here a few minutes before noon; otherwise, you may have to wait quite a while for a table."], ["Alison B.", "Delicious mushroom Risotto oh yeah!!!

It's filled with cheese and pear with one of the best sauces you could create. This has to be a fan favorite, haven't had anything like this before.I took a few bites of the gnocchi as well. This was a great dish too. My takeaway from these two dishes is that they do set themselves apart from the average place and they are one of the best Italian restaurants.If your in Miami this place should be on the top of your list. I've eaten at many Italian places but not many reach the level of flavor they did from the two dishes I've tried. I only can guess the other choices follow suit."], ["Wei J.", "Excellent excellent excellent. It was surprising how fantastic everything was. This place is located Inside a nondescript building.

You'll love it."], ["Lizzy H.", "What a hidden gem! We had a little mini stay-cation at the Epic Hotel in Miami this past weekend. While walking around the area, we stumbled upon Fratelli Milano. We took a chance and made reservation for dinner that evening. Boy oh boy was I glad we found this place! The restaurant is very cozy and warm, but it's still quite modern. The menu is very reasonably priced and they have quite a selection of homemade pastas. Who doesn't have homemade pasta? I highly recommend getting at least 1 pasta dish if you're dining at Fratelli Milano.We tried many dishes but we all agreed that the best dish of the night was the Pappardelle Milano. It consist of homemade pastas, filet mignon, porcini mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, chianti wine, goat cheese, truffle oil & fresh tomato sauce. It was pretty much heaven with every bite. It was the perfect balance of creamy, nutty, and tang all in one. Truly delicious!!If you can, I would also suggest that you try one of their dessert. We tried the creme brulee and panna cotta and they were both so decadent.We cannot wait to return to this great little neighborhood joint."], ["Josh C.", "Had the best pizza margarita and farfalle with diced tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella. \u00a0Highly recommend."], ["Foodie G.", "The pasta texture was delicious with lots of seafood in the seafood fettuccine (especially calamari). \u00a0 I was delightfully surprised that the portion was so large considering the romantic atmosphere of the restaurant. \u00a0Really great value for $21. \u00a0 I would definitely come here again!"], ["Diane W.", "The service here was very under par. They told us the wait would only be 10 minutes and they had us waiting for over 20 without even saying anything or an update. When they finally sat us down the waiter was very rude and short. It also took forever to get the check, and he added gratuity to a table of 4 which was a little insulting. I ordered the filet mignon pasta and the flavor was very full, but the tomatoes took over the dish, and that's pretty much all I could taste. The noodles were very fresh though and I loved the texture."], ["Colette T.", "I came here recently with my friend to try out the Italian fare around my apartment. \u00a0The restaurant is super cozy and the decor is really warm and inviting. \u00a0I loved it and it's within walking distance! \u00a0So good. I decided to try the Bucatini San Babila because I love Italian sausage. \u00a0Literally my favorite. \u00a0When my food came, it looked AMAZING. \u00a0It tasted amazing too. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients and the pasta definitely was handmade. \u00a0The sauce to pasta ratio wasn't too overwhelming either. \u00a0Like my pasta wasn't drowning in sauce, it was more coated in sauce. So good. \u00a0My friend loved her food as well. \u00a0The price isn't unreasonable either. \u00a0Definitely worth the money. \u00a0I will definitely come back again. \u00a0The service was great and it just seemed like a restaurant that would allow me to have a relaxing time."], ["Emily R.", "Excellent authentic Italian fare.

I have had Ristorante Fratelli Milano on my bookmark flow for quite some time but kept talking myself out of it (ex: oh the parking situation is going to be too crazy or the restaurant is going to be too packed for enjoyment), but this past weekend as I was chilling near Bayside, I finally choose to make the jump and dine in.I can't front, the signage for this place is not really all there which caused me to pass it twice but once I found it I was able to park across the street in ease (yeah say whattttt - in Brickell/Downtown?). As I approached the restaurant, I prepared myself for a crowded place with a wait time to be seated, however the restaurant gods were looking upon us and there was no wait, in fact, the place was rather empty for a Saturday afternoon... I was happy because I hate overly crowded places.We opted to sit at the bar area although the outside area looked so tempting, the place is well decorated with a bar area attached to a tempting desert glass case, several tables outside and a dining room with ceiling fixtures, stand alone tables and couch wall type seating with a large outside window for people viewing!The service was (for the majority) on point, with the bartender/waiter checking on me and ensuring that all was OK and even making some recommendations as he could tell I was possibly not making the right choice on a dish!The Food...The Fried Calamari was fantastic, this is a dish that can be shared as the portion is pretty big. The calamari was tender and not chewy, the breading around it was well seasoned and it not overly done and the marinara sauce was perfect and spicy (you could actually see the spices in the sauce)!The Fettuccine with Bolognese sauce was excellent as well, again another dish that can be shared as its a pretty big portion. The pasta itself was on point as it was perfectly Al Dente and you could taste the freshness in the ingredients (no store bought pasta folks). The meat sauce was great as well, it contained a mixture of both pork and beef with beef being about 90% of the protein. This was a very hearty, warm and relaxing dish that made you smile within every bite!Overall this is a great place to get your Italian grub on with authentic flavors and great ambiance for a quick lunch or a dinner date, if and when I'm in the mood for pasta or even a nice pizza or a cannoli - I'll most def be back to check out this spot and you should too!"], ["Andrea C.", "Amazing dinner, the ambience was relaxing and very elegant...I love the flavors and the pasta's taste..."], ["Jennifer P.", "I read such great reviews and I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. But it just couldn't be done all because of one minor issue.I ordered for delivery to the Epic Hotel where I'm staying for the week. She said the food would take 45 minutes - came exactly in 45 minutes and as I'm in my hotel room taking out my pasta, there are NO utensils.If I wasn't so annoyed to begin with because I was so hungry I guess I wouldn't have minded as much but it just seemed like the standard thing to do for delivery.

I've been here twice and I love it because they use incredibly fresh ingredients, have great service, and the perfect atmosphere. To start, they serve complimentary bread and tomato sauce. Why doesn't every Italian restaurant serve their bread with tomato sauce is going to be the only thing on your mind after eating the bread! It's great and high quality. We also ordered the traditional bruschetta. Again, delicious, high-quality tomatoes. I always think bruschetta is so easy to make at home, why do I order it in restaurants, and then I have a bruschetta like this and realize why. For entrees, we had their homemade spinach pasta with vegetables and the veal cutlet with tomatoes and mozzarella on arugula. Everything was delicious and you could sense the freshness by looking at the dishes. Very highly recommend for a nice Italian dinner!!! In summary, this place is outstanding for its high quality, fresh ingredients!"], ["Nicole R.", "What a lovely experience this was. My husband brought me here for our anniversary. He made a reservation for 7:30pm and upon arrival they had our table ready and waiting for us. The place as otherwise crowded so I am glad he made a reservation. They also brought us a complimentary round of champagne to celebrate the occasion as we looked over the menu as well as a basket of bread with some sort of bruschetta dipping sauce. The skinny bread sticks were my favorite in the bread basket. Very addicting and the dipping sauce was so flavorful. The waiter was back shortly to take our orders. We didn't order an appetizer because I wanted to save room for dessert. For dinner, I ordered the seafood risotto and my husband ordered the lobster ravioli. Omg. The risotto. So so flavorful and FULL of seafood. I could not finish it as much as I wanted to since the portion size was pretty hefty. I was so happy to have the leftovers tho! \u00a0So yummy. Hubby loved the ravioli. He finished every bit of it. For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and the lemon tart. Both were super fresh, it definitely seemed they were made that day.

From the outside, you don't expect much. It's pretty well hidden. We went inside and the place is really beautifully decorated. Very intimate, probably a good date spot.

The one place where the price is worth the amount of food you get. Expect to bring your food home with you, you'll want to! The service is really excellent.

I'm not too familiar with downtown Miami, and we spent most of time in Miami Beach, so we ventured to downtown to eat at this highly rated restaurant.

The BF went for the lasagna, which he also enjoyed. The menu has so many great choices, I highly recommend it!We sat outside, on the sidewalk, which I really enjoyed. The tables are situated under the canopy of a huge gorgeous tree. Just a great setting... lots to see. Very nice area."], ["Troy F.", "Yes, eat here!Solid, tasty Italian in a cute, neighborhood spot. HMB and I have eaten here twice, both on Miami getaways, so a return visit speaks highly of Fratelli Milano given all of the other options available. The food is very good. \u00a0I've had the fish stew and the seafood risotto, both of which were cooked to perfection and had an abundance of fresh, delicious shellfish. \u00a0The risotto was firm, yet tender and had an amazing, tomato base that beautifully elevated and didn't overpower the delicate flavors of the fish. Yum. Overall, the menu doesn't try to get too fancy - it promises relatively straightforward Italian dishes and then completely over- delivers on expectations. Wine list is good - nothing overly adventurous, but you'll most certainly find a bottle you'll enjoy. What takes FM from a good experience to lovely memory you'll want to have again and again is the service. It's family run business and that pride of ownership really comes through at every touch point - when you arrive, when you're having a glass of wine at the (tiny) bar, or throughout your meal. \u00a0Attentive, friendly, great pacing, never rushed. \u00a0I'm confident that at the end of your dinner you'll walk out arm-in-arm, smile on your faces, looking forward to coming back. \u00a0We have (twice)."], ["Cristy C.", "Excellent.

Been 10 or 12 times and has been consistently great."], ["Lexi A.", "I want to start off this review by first stating that my coworkers and I once LOVED this restaurant. We work across the street and would order often as well as order for our clients. If they weren't too busy a server would come to our business and drop it off, and we would be sure to tip well for making things convenient for us. Then we hear there are new owners. This brought us to getting charged $18 for an arugula salad (salad implying mixed) that consisted of just arugula in a box. But that we let slide, thinking it was just growing pains or a misunderstanding.******Then today happened. We had a pretty busy day at our business. We asked if it was possible to get delivery across the street which they said they will no longer be doing. \u00a0Ok fine, no big deal. We order, and I was available to pick up the food. When I get back, my co worker had a quick 15 minutes to eat in between clients and found A GIANT ROACH in her caesar salad. She put it in a paper towel and showed it to me. Completely repulsed I told her not to throw anything away and not to touch any of the other food (2 pumpkin soups and a side of bread) and I would walk back as soon as I got a free chance to inform them and ask for a refund. About an hour or 2 later I had time to walk back over to NiDo in between clients. I asked calmly and politely to speak to a manager. I was pointed to his direction and walked over to him at the back of the restaurant. I went to him not wanting to make a scene in front of his other customer. I took out the salad box and said we would like a refund. He asked why, I told him to open the box ( again not wanting to make a scene). The manager got INCREDIBLY defensive telling me there is \"NO WAY\" that this was their fault and that he made the salad himself . \u00a0My co worker put a dirty paper towel with some left over hair extensions from our salon in the box from when she was going to throw it away ai I can understand why it may have initially come off as suspect. But why would I bother coming to him about a roach? He would not stop being hostile and denying any fault. \u00a0I kept asking, \"why do you think we would lie?\" \"Why would we put a roach in our food?\" because really...why would we want to be hungry at work with what little windows we have to eat at our establishment?This went on with him speaking to the cook and to the other servers essentially blaming us for the ROACH being in the salad and took no responsibility in an unnecessarily aggressive manner. He was incredibly hostile and rude. I was completely confused (having worked in the hospitality/restaurant industry myself) that I did NOT in the very least get an APOLOGY. Instead I got an incredibly dramatic scene and was treated like a lying P.O.S. Sure, maybe the a GIANT ROACH somehow opened the plastic lid in the to-go container to let himself in to die unbeknownst to us. \u00a0But the fact that I was treated in such a low class manner in what's suppose to be a high class establishment is incredibly alarming and unprofessional. I am more disgusted in this manager's manners than I am with the roach in my co workers caesar salad. Needless to say we got our refund with a HUGE attitude and still no apology. I strongly advise people avoid this restaurant. If not for the possible pest problem, but just for the blatant lack of common sense on how to treat a customer."], ["Carlos F.", "My first time hitting this little hit spot in Miami.

They have several little unique touches that make this place a must like various infused olive oils, truffle is great mint is surprising, and a wonderful mozzarella bar where you can order a unique Dollop of mozzarella with fresh veggie sides and a vinegary veggie tapenade.

I was too busy with good company to really study the menu. I wanted some greens with fresh seafood, which wasn't on the menu, so they grilled some octopus and calamari and tossed it on top of arugula and breakfast radishes, with a side of lemon olive oil dressing. It was worth the wait. The octopus steak was meaty, tender and had a great char on it. Everything I wanted it to be, only better. The calamari were equally soft and delicious. It was such a huge portion of seafood that I had half packed up to go.All the brunch portions looked generous (none of that trendy tapas-style fufu stuff) and homey. I did get to try the French toast, which was more of a dessert. Doused in cinnamon, which I can never get enough of, topped with fresh fruit, and I am talking REAL fresh fruit: big chunks of mango, banana, apples and strawberries.

You have a casual cafe type setting and seemingly authentic Italian servers with accent and all. My friends and I ordered the lasanga, gnocci, and fettucine gamberi. The lasagna was pretty good and my friend commented that it wasn't over cheesed with ricotta like so many other establishments. My dish didn't have very much sauce to it at all. So when it first came I was a little disappointed, but as I ate more and more of it I liked it a lot. Despite it having so little sauce it had so much flavor to it. They also put in a tiger prawn head on and everything for a beautiful presentation. My personal favorite was my friend's gnocci dish. It's a punch of flavor and the gnocci was made and cooked to perfect soft chewiness. I had to reserve myself from eating most of her dish instead of my own. I forgot to add that we did share an appetizer of prosciutto and burrata. It came with a side of roasted and pickled \u00a0peppers, eggplant and capers. It was a very tasty accompaniment to the dish. Although with a dish so simple I think this can be a dish skipped beause of the price and the availability of burrata and prosciutto now. I make this dish at home already. The only gripe I had with this dish is that they brought out a reduction of balsamic vinegar straight from the bottle. Now I'm not sure if this was more for advertisement purposes for the balsamic bottler, but it brought down the refinement a bit. It would have been better if they brought it out in a separate dish or just put on however much they pleased and called it a day. But with that said it's only a small gripe that I'm splitting hairs with. This place is still pretty tasty and this area is definitely on the upswing for gentrification."], ["Norma G.", "Wow! This place was just pure perfection. Came here on a date night. And I'm glad we picked this place. Everything was absolutely perfect.

Greeted us with hugs and kisses, very Italian of her ;) . It was a perfect weather night so we decided to seat in the patio, not too big but very cozy. The service was impeccable, from the bus boy, to our waiter. Everybody seemed happy to be there.We started with a mozzarella and prosciutto salad, I believe it's made at the restaurant, it was very tasty. As entrees we chose the Osobuco ravioli which was very rich and perfectly cooked. And also we had the porcini pappardelle, wow! I was in heaven, you can really taste the love they put into preparing your food in every bite. I think we'll definitely will make this place our own. Can't wait to go back, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.

We ordered the tuna tartare and polpo (octopus) salad to start, followed by risotto with scallops and asparagus in a lobster bisque sauce and gnocchi with buffalo mozzarella and basil. The tartare and octopus were just ok...probably not the best choice at an Italian restaurant, but we were fiending for some octopus after having some at a greek place. The risotto had a generous amount of scallops and was good for the first couple bites, but then it got a little too much like flour mixed with water. I also wasn't a fan of the presentation. My bf said his gnocchi was good, but we've both had better. The sauce was a simple tomato with no added flavors. Overall, I wouldn't knock this place off any list and would be willing to try it again, but I'd prefer to try other places first."], ["Andre G.", "First time at Ni. Do.

The sauce was carefully infused with herbs and spices that were all over my taste buds.It is a perfect place for a date, family dinner or a group affair. Tonight we had kids in our group and they were able to make some simple dishes for the kids to enjoy as well. Their pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was Impeccable and the kids devoured it.

I am still dreaming about that deliciousness. Several members of the party ordered the Branzino and were talking about it for days later.

My daughter told them it was my birthday, so they brought out a nice cake at the end ... Only to take it away, and use the SAME cake to sing Happy Birthday to someone a couple of tables away. \u00a0I would suggest at minimum a single scoop of gelato ...

I had no excuse but to finally go here since I live in the building, so a group of 4 of us went to indulge. The wait staff was lovely and seated us right away. Before receiving the menus, they bring out delicious bread, parmesano cheese cute from a block tableside, and bruschetta to start. Drinks are delivered promptly, while you eagerly await the menu. Our waiter arrived and listed probably about SIXTEEN specials that were being offered that day (I used to be a waitress in fine dining back in college, and let me tell you that is NOT easy). The specials sounded so unbelievably delicious that we all ordered from those choices. The veal, scallops and chicken fra diavolo were superb. For starters we all shared the grilled octopus (probably one of the best cooked ones I've had in a long time) and the escargot.After dinner, we sat and took our time finishing our drinks without any issues. What a fantastic experience and truly a great meal. But, with such a great experience, comes a great price tag, so unless you are ok with dropping some serious dough, I would reserve this restaurant for a special occasion, trying to impress your in laws, or going here once in a blue moon."], ["Lu H.", "The meal starts off with a nearly full plate of food as soon as you sit down, before you order anything. \u00a0I was totally obsessed with their balsamic vinegar, which is to die for -- thick, with a far more complex flavor than your run-of-the-mill balsamic. \u00a0It reminded me of the aged balsamic vinegar I tried in Modena, Italy. \u00a0I could not get enough of this stuff, which was quickly sopped up with the generous bread provided. \u00a0Luckily for me and my dining companions, who were equally wooed, our waiter provided a refill. \u00a0:)An excellent chunk of parmesean cheese, taken straight off the wheel at your table, is plunked right next to the vinegar. \u00a0 A bowl of fried zucchini chips (actually not crisp at all, sadly) for the table. \u00a0 Finally, bruschetta with fresh tomatoes, rounded out the series of on-the-house appetizers. \u00a0 \u00a0And then, your meal starts. The waiters seemed to be SO Italian that you could barely understand the run-through of the menu specials, especially in a cavernously loud restaurant. \u00a0I had the grilled octopus to start and the irresistible sounding porcini ravioli with truffle cream sauce. \u00a0The grilled octopus was just alright. \u00a0The waiter was quite enthusiastic about it, but when I tried it, it was a bit tough and over-cooked around the edges. Maybe I was already full from the free starters to really appreciate \u00a0a rather heavy appetizer. \u00a0The ravioli with truffle was decadently delicious. \u00a0The full portion came with about 8-9 pieces, which was way too much. \u00a0I could only finish about 3-4, and even that was pushing it. \u00a0After all of the starts and apps, by the time this entree came out, I found myself wishing I had ordered a more refreshing pasta. \u00a0A few of us in the party were disappointed that they did not have ice cream. \u00a0How strange is that? \u00a0I thought I wasn't understanding the waiter correctly, so I probably asked about four times if they had ice cream (the fourth time I said, \"oh, okay. \u00a0Do you have gelato then?\"). \u00a0In any case, we settled for an assortment of desserts. \u00a0A friend and I split the trio of desserts, which included a dense, flourless chocolate cake, tiramisu, and ricotta cheesecake. \u00a0All were excellent, especially the chocolate cake, if you like a dense, rich, not-too-sweet (in fact, almost bitter) chocolate. \u00a0Definitely a Miami kind of restaurant based on atmosphere, view, and clientele. \u00a0Lots of women in tall heels and short skirts. \u00a0Whether or not that's your scene, the food is quite decent and, if you order correctly, could rival some of the well-known Italian spots in NYC."], ["Stephanie F.", "Amazing! I was treated here by my group of girlfriends for my birthday and let me just say that the entire night we were beyond impressed. From the view to the waiters. They almost sing you their specials. It's quite impressive hearing them give you the run down and you get almost drunk in listening to their Italian. As soon as you sit they quickly bring you Bruschetta, Zucchini chips, a toasted almost Melba type bread, aged Parmesan cheese and balsamic sauce. Wow. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli. Hands down the BEST I have ever had. And at $49 it was worth every penny. I also had the Tiramisu for dessert and it was just as amazing.

It definitely wasn't the best thing in the world, and for nearly $18, it might have been a little too expensive for what it was, but I liked it. The Caesar Salad was incredible on the other hand. This self serve system leaves room for improvement too. Getting a glass of water from the bar can be a chore. And there should be at least one or two waiters walking around to check on everybody. Also, if you order pizza or a salad, they give you a pager to wait for your order. With Pasta, you tell the chef what you want and how you want it as he does it.

I looked at the menu he gave me and decided on the bruschetta pizza. \u00a0I went to the pizza guy (there was no wait for pizza, but there were lines 4 or 5 deep at each of the pasta stations), he took my order, told me to scan my card, then had to show me exactly where/how, then had to do it for me as the machine wasn't working correctly. \u00a0He told me to take a pager from the docking station which would alert me when my food was ready; I had to spin the pager around a few times as he attempted to see the number to program it into the point of sale machine. \u00a0In all, it just didn't feel like an intuitive and straightforward process. \u00a0 While waiting for my pizza to be ready, I made my way to the bar to get a bottle of juice. \u00a0The woman there was a bit more helpful, but after she entered the info about the juice I bought, I had to excuse myself and try and weave through 3 other customers to get to the end of the counter where the point of sale machine was located so I could scan my card. \u00a0Again, a bit awkward.A few moments later my food was ready, I picked it up, grabbed silverware and was off. \u00a0The prices were fair; it was $9.95 for the pizza and $3.50 for the cranberry juice. Based on this experience, I'd give this place a solid 3 stars. \u00a04 stars for the food and the general concept which is unique, but 2 stars for the cumbersome, unintuitive and somewhat disjointed process with ordering and the charge cards. \u00a0With maybe a bit more explanation and some signage for the newbies, that might cause me to raise my overall rating."], ["Natasha M.", "Love the vibe here. Pasta really isn't my favorite thing to eat but having visited the location in NYC, I wanted to give this place a try. My penne arrabiata was delicious and I was struggling with my inner self about finishing the entire bowl.

Free parking bring your ticket !!"], ["Cassie G.", "My first question is why don't more places function like this?It seems so simple: walk in and grab a card, head to different stations (think salad, pasta, pizza) to construct your meal, sit down with friends, enjoy, and pay on the way out! Unlike a traditional cafeteria, you can take your time and order dishes (and multiple drink rounds) without having to close out each time. We started at the bar where I got what they described as an \"Italian mojito.\" It was alright but I prefer the glass of house red I got a little later. These, along with Peroni on draft, were on happy hour special for only $3, even at 8pm on a Saturday. I knew I wanted pasta so went with a seasonal special, the pasta vitello, but they were out of its namesake veal, so I got beef instead. You can pick the type of pasta you get so I chose parppadelle which I thought would complement the sauce well. Wow! Within minutes they whipped it up in front of me and it was a hearty portion of pasta and sauce that I simply couldn't stop devouring. I also got a side salad which I'd order next time but with the dressing on the side as it definitely drowned the lettuce. And the cheesecake... Oh man, the cheesecake. It's arguably my favorite dessert in the world and this was pure NY cheesecake that reminded me of some of the best slices I've had in the city. With a little bit of a strawberry drizzle and cut strawberries scattered on top, I was in heaven. I honestly didn't expect to like this place as much as I did.

I remember I first tried Vapiano in D.C. years ago and my wishes came true when they \u00a0opened this location a little while ago. :) I just love the concept. You get a card upon entering and all orders are uploaded on your personal card. You pay at the end. \u00a0It is kind of an upscale cafeteria style spot. There are particular stations for pasta, salad, pizza, etc and you go to the line of your choice. There are delicious menu items or you're free to tweak menu options or create your own dish. \u00a0You can interact with and watch the chefs cook. \u00a0 :). Everyone in our party ordered pasta dishes and dessert( tiramisu) and it was all delicious.The ambiance is trendy, fun, and open. There are trees and plants right next to tables, as well as candle lit booths and an up stairs area for more intimate dining.There is a full bar, desserts, \u00a0and of course, \u00a0free gummy bears on the way out.Its probably a good thing that this restaurant is not right next door to me, Or I'd be carb loading on their delicious and freshly made pastas and pizzas every day.

So.Awesome.Looking forward to my next visit!"], ["Hortensia A.", "One of my favorite new places for affordable pasta and everything under the sun. The concept here is very cool. You walk in and are given a card ( like a charge card ) per person. Then you continue into this very chic yet a bit rustic atmosphere that immediately invites you into your eating experience. You can start at the antipasta station and try the steak carpaccio. It it absolutely delicious, delicate, and light. After you have wet your appetite, you can waltz yourself to one of the cooks, who you will tell which sort of fresh (homemade) past you would like, and the the of sauce you will drench your pasta in. The cook will immediately drop your pasta in boiling water, and before your very own eyes, develop a delicious sauce custom made for your pasta. If you like a little spice, or a lot, you will be there through the process as it's made. If you've ended your delicious meal and card for coffee of a drink or dessert, they have a station for those too. You will swipe your card at each station and pay on the way out. It's kind of like a high end cafeteria. At any rate, remember to tip on your way out before digging for some complementary gummy bears. Enjoy !"], ["Christina Z.", "This place is awesome!

I cannot wait for our next visit (will be in Europe this time)."], ["Melissa S.", "I have probably been here about 10 times and I love it each time! Before going here though, you need to have reasonable expectations. Each person is given a card and you order your food made to order cafeteria style by waiting in line at different stations. Then you collect your food and your party has a table. You swipe your card to pay and pay on the way out. It is both good and bad for large parties. You will spend a lot of time separate in the beginning while everyone is separately getting their own food and you are taking turns watching the table. However, it is great in that when you leave, you only pay for what you order so you don't deal with the catastrophe of splitting a large bill at the end and some people over paying. The food is consistently very, very good. It is not gourmet and out of this world but very solid. My favorite is the pesto pasta, the goat cheese and strawberry salad, and the margharita pizza. I have decided that adding protein to the pasta is not worth it since they do not give you a lot for the price. All the water is infused with fruit which is excellent of course."], ["Jessica B.", "Oh boy i was pleasantly surprised, came here last night with my hubby and best friend. \u00a0Loved the ambiance, the decor, the service staff was really friendly.We shared the ceaser salad, the greek salad, the mushroom brushcetta, then the pasta scampi and the carbonara. \u00a0All the pasta was really light and flavorful. \u00a0For dessert my bestie had the chocolate mousse and she loved it.Free parking at the building behind for 2 hours."], ["Ozzy M.", "Interesting place, different.I've only been here for lunch no parking which is typical of Brickell, and I've only had the made to order Pizza which was very good.My friend had the pasta which looks very good.Will come back for dinner and report back"], ["Nadya G.", "This place is Amazing!!!

Everything feels very natural (the decor is mostly plants like basil that you can actually eat) and I really like that feeling. The hostesses and the chefs were all very friendly. There were no lines at the pasta station or the pizza station, but the pizza does take a lot longer to cook. We had the pesto pasta with chicken and the garlic tomato pizza. Both tasted great and you could tell it was freshly made. So why only 3 starts. First, as I write this the next morning, I have a terrible stomach ache, probably because the food was so oily. The pesto pasta was literally floating in oil. The pizza was also greasy, but no where near the amount of oil as in the pasta. I would definitely try a different dish next time as I know pesto is oil based, but it really needs to be lighter. The other complaint is they need to improve their craft beer selection. I don't want to drink Heineken or Bud, they just aren't tasty. I don't even care if it's a dollar or two more, they need to have the options."], ["Janexis R.", "Came here for my 21st birthday had an amazing dinner and the happy hour was good.

Unfortunately, I really don't get what the hype is about. Between the mediocre service, high prices, small portions and hideous decor, this place is simply below par.We made a reservation for Saturday night, which was a good thing because the place was booked solid. Upon walking in, we stood at the entrance for a minute or two waiting to be helped. Two waiters walked straight past us without so much as a nod or a simple sign of acknowledgment. I finally walked towards the bar area in the back where someone helped us get seated.The pinot grigio we had was nice but the cheap baby wine glasses took away from the experience. Come on, you call yourself a wine bar, you need to do better than serve wine out of picnic glasses.The salmon tartar starter was tasty, no complaints here. But then the entrees took forever to come out.The entrees come in either full or half sizes. We ordered the full size, which was very small, so makes me wonder what the half looks like. My scallops were nicely seared, so was the creamy polenta. All in all the food was tasty and I like the fact that there are several vegetarian options. Dessert was once again disappointing. There are only three choices, the best one being molten chocolate cake a la mode. Well, lets just say this molten chocolate cake came out of a freezer box and the ice cream was cheap as well. Not worth it.The kicker was when they added $22 gratuity to the bill, based on \"the value of the dinner voucher\". They are off their rockers if they think a bottle of cheap wine, one appetizer, two teeny weeny entrees and a single frozen dessert are worth $120. I want some of whatever they are smoking."], ["Tiffany S.", "We absolutely loved the food here! Came on a Friday before it was too busy, and got a table right by the door.

The Gilt City Special allows you to choose one appetizer, two entrees, one dessert, and a bottle of wine. \u00a0Our server told us that they were out of some of the items on the menu, so we decided to order the peruvian ceviche with sweet potato, and mango chutney with honey. It was a new item on the menu and we hope they keep it. The combination sounded strange, but the potatoes actually went with the ceviche quite well and the ceviche was fresh and spicy. Since I normally have appetizer, entree, and dessert as a warm up for my meal, we also ordered the tabla, where you choose cured meats and artisan cheeses. You create your own tabla with 3 choices for $22, 5 choices for $34 or 8 choices for $48. We chose the latter (of course) and asked our server to choose the ingredients for us. \u00a0He did really well by selecting four meats (bresaola, prosciutto di parma, jamon serrano, and chorizo), as well as four cheeses (pecorino tartufato, manchego, brie, and parmeggiano reggiano). \u00a0They come with artichoke and truffle mouse, fig and port jam and anchovy mouse (instead of olives, which we don't like). \u00a0They were delicious and it was really nice to try each meat with each cheese to find the best combination along with the spreads. \u00a0The tabla alone makes the whole meal worth it and we would go back just to have that with a bottle of wine. For his entree my husband ordered the 1/2 chicken which comes with artichokes, arugula, sun dried tomatoes, and olives (which they happily agreed to leave out at his request. We really don't like olives). \u00a0I tried a bite of his chicken and it was crispy outside and moist inside. He can't tell me whether he liked it or not because by then he was so full he couldn't eat (rookie). I ordered the ravioli bin no. 18, which comes with brown sage, truffle butter, tomatoes, and toasted almonds. \u00a0My cleaned out plate was testament to how good this plate was. I had never had toasted almonds and pasta together before. The almonds went really well with the cheese and truffle butter and they added a nice crunch to each bite. I confess that I had to take my dessert to go because I was very full. Of course, I ate my dessert (key lime pie) while writing this review. \u00a0It was just sweet enough and the crust was crumbly and crunchy. \u00a0Really good and I finished the whole thing.

The cantucci + vin sant were 3 tiny cookies and sweet wine, and the other dessert was a cup with a foam made with limoncello (liquor), fruits and milk. Overall, not the place to come with Miami spice since the portions they serve are too tiny for that price. Is not worth it!!"], ["Jim A.", "Although I've had excellent lunches here, this review is specifically for the \"Thanksgiving to go\" meal offered by TD. The price was very reasonable, and all of the food was delicious, particularly the stuffing and pumpkin pie (complete with whipped cream). My only complaint was that we were given a disappointingly small amount of gravy and cranberry sauce, but TD was very apologetic, and even credited my purchase a reasonable amount. (Luckily, it wasn't difficult to make extra gravy from the turkey drippings!)"], ["Janesse S.", "My boyfriend and I came here for Miami Spice deal. We both ordered the Risotto. Buuuut, my boyfriend can't have dairy type products in his meal so the Chef made a special Risotto just for him and it was deliciousssss! The chef really listened to our concerns and delivered. Since it was Miami Spice, I remember it came with a tuna tartare appetizer but it was nothing to write home about. Still, a good deal for the attentiveness and Chef preparing a special meal for my boyfriend.

Yuri and Douglas \u00a0will really make the experience even better with their charisma and excellent customer service. Food is delicious. so far the sliders, the pizzetta and the duck ragu pasta are my favorites. Prices are average to the Brickell area.

Everyone here is s friendly and nicely dressed.Definitely a place to try if you are in the village."], ["Andrea F.", "Delicious food, great service. The bartender was very friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu and super skilled. He improvised a passion fruit spicy cocktail so yummy and hot!

Kicked off HH with an excellent variation of an Old Fashion. Such a delicious drink. A bit of sweet meets a bit of that 'Jack' hardness. Perfect. The nibs were spot on with the Truffle Ricotta, with Honey, Pepper and tasty crispy toast...couldnt stop eating the ricotta or any of the other bread lying around. It was that delicious! Also tried the Crispy Porchetta (Pork Belly) with Red Onion, Radish, LemonParmigiano, and Micro Herbs. The presentation was phenomenal. I loved the crispy-ness of the pork belly although it was a bit too fatty for me to fully enjoy. Would totally return to this spot and the trendy Brickell neighborhood."], ["Sarah S.", "You would love this place if you really appreciate authentic Italian food.

She ordered the roast chicken and I have to \u00a0say it was really good. Chicken is not something I would order but I am glad she did. Moist and the veg were divine.I had the risotto with mushrooms and spring onions.So creamy. Fantastic flavor. How did they do that?We shared tirami su for dessert. I will let the picture speak for itself.Alessandro was attentive and spot on. Davide was best busser. And of course Mauro was charming as ever.I recommend this place for business or romance. I was there twice last week so you know we love it."], ["Jacques R.", "This place is well located in Brickell... Nice ambiance and has inside and outside seating.. Managers and service was above average. Food, they really know what they are doing! Last night we had a new \"plate\" pisi with lamb. Maybe the best I've had in US!! Well balanced, homemade pasta.. We also had duck that was also cooked to perfection.. All in all this place is a must for anyone wanting to eat true Italian food. Their wine cellar is pretty good and their wine glasses are also quite nice! (Dont have to bring my own glasses!!).Try this one...

So why a one-star review?Because we spent $126 before tip and we left hungry! My husband $23 past dish was only 5 small ravioli and my octopus salad was a joke: I stuck my fork in it and all came up at once. And the octopus? Just a couple of slivers to justify the name. The place is nice and the service good, although slow, but Toscana Divino is a rip off."], ["Hazel Z.", "Did not like the place. The tables were very crammed. 2 tables were place right at the exit of the kitchen and the space to get in an out of the kitchen was very tight. unfortunately that is where we were sat because it was saturday and full. because of this my husband was hit in the head with a butcher block. the food was tasteless and very small plates for the prices. I was able to see the kitchen where I was at. there was a stand up fan facing a prep station which is a no no.... because you have all types of dust flying onto the food. then the same runner that just picked up dirty dishes from a table was in the kitchen cutting bread for service with his bare hands, no gloves. I will never go back to this place.resumen: tight space, bland food, no gloves worn by anyone!"], ["Jeanette H.", "Good vibe @Mary Brickell Village and was packed on a Friday night. Happy hours are limited just to the inside bar area, while outdoor dining is very nice. I only got to try small side dishes this time. Brussel Sprouts and Baby Vegetables were very good.

Strawberry pur\u00e9e though is the real fresh pur\u00e9e. \u00a0Great place to hang out.,"], ["Katy C.", "I really loved this place! everyone was super nice and friendly, the drinks were exceptional!!!

We had made reservations, and were promptly shown to our table by the friendly hostess as soon as we arrived.The waitstaff too, were very friendly and generally chatty. To start, we ordered a portion of the calamari. The calamari was very different that we expected, and very fresh. A bit too \"fishy\" for me, but that's just my taste.As my entre, I had the pasta with the braised beef ragou. The entrees when they arrive, seem like they are very small portions. However, when you're done with them, it leaves you with that perfectly full feeling.. not too tfull, and not hungry.. just right! I forgot what pasta dish my friend ordered, but I remember him saying he liked it too :)For dessert, I had the chocolate crusted tart, which was really fantastic!

But when I get there, I hope to have some of the same languid food experiences as I've had at Salumeria 104. This is the life. I mean, what's better than a slow Friday night, eating al fresco, drinking wine, talking with a good friend, and eating as much meat, cheese and pasta as is humanly possible?The neighborhood/setting is a bit of a question. The hustle bustle of superbusy NE 1st Ave seems to be at odds with the old world feel of Salumeria 104. But, you can't choose your family. I don't pay the rent, so I am not going to complain about placement. I'll just concentrate on the eating and drinking. And, in truth, it's pretty easy to concentrate. I love when concepts know what/who they are and stick to it. There's no need for S104 to through a bunch of stuff against the wall and hope that something sticks. Not at all. You come here for meat, cheese, pasta, and wine.Meat: any of it. Seriously. Any.of.it. With a name like Salumeria 104, the salumi is serious business. My friend and I ordered the Salumi appetizer and we devoured it. Well, I suppose 'devour' isn't the right word. That seems far too gauche for what we did. We tasted, chatted, laughed, and appreciated the various forms of cured pig that made its way to our plates;Cheese: again, eat it all. The formaggi plate is as much of a must as is the salumi plate. Expertly crafted cheese, specifically chosen to compliment cured meats... this is what you've been waiting for. Go a little off the beaten path and order the grilled Belgian endive salad with stracchino cheese, balsamic reduction and fig. Your mouth will be your new bff;Wine: any... you get my point? My personal favorite here is a sparkling red that seems just wrong enough to feel naughty but right enough to go with whatever you choose to eat; and Pasta: it sounds like a cop out but the ravioli is really really good. I know. Ravioli. How boring. But when the ravioli is hand-made, stuffed with ricotta and prosciutto and tossed with oyster mushrooms...You're welcome."], ["Marco C.", "Simply amazing traditional italian and the cured meats selection is by far the best in midtown a must for italian, we were lucky enough to be served by Alex a manager on shift that night , every dish that came out was followed by a brief explanation which made the expierience even better,, Salumeria has 5 stars for me for sure becoming a reg here Thank you Alex"], ["Nora D.", "Of all the italian restaurants I have tried in the miami area, this is the best one.

No worries they know how to handle a crowd. \u00a0The dining room is a bit cramped but once we started drinking and eating we became very happy. \u00a0We took our own wine with a $10 corkage fee, yes thank you!

The cold cut tray with an excellent cheese was excellent as well. \u00a0I chose pasta with fra diavolo, pasta was cooked perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed it. All of our entree's were amazing. \u00a0Our server was terrific, we never waited for anything. From the bread and oil to all the apps we had and each of our entree's, it was a very very good meal. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, service was great,I can see many returns to this fantastic restaurant. Take away all the fancy large restaurants and dine here, you will not regret it. The quality of all the food was impeccable.

What are they thinking? I honestly have never had such bad experience. Service was slow, we kept getting the \"YOUR FOOD WILL BE RIGHT OUT...\" message over and over from 2 or 3 different servers, obviously not organized nor personalized.The food is a royal disaster...my \"Gnocchi\" was more of a buttered soup than actual pasta, IT WAS DISGUSTING! I am not sure who told the chef that he could cook, but he clearly needs to go back to the car wash business.I am typically not this brutal, but I could never look at pasta the same way, so it is well deserved.

We were told that this type of gnocchi is very popular in Italy but unfortunately, Americans only know about the one type with potatoes but this is absolutely so flavorful and tasty that I wanted another plate. The only compliant I have is that the place is a bit too LOUD, even if there were only 10 people in the restaurant, the walls are probably really thin."], ["Maglenys S.", "I have been here a few times and it always makes an impression .

Started out with the burratini was excellent room temperature with a panzenalla salad with bread, Israeli cucumbers, small yellow and red tomatoes, and red pepper $12. Very fresh tasted like the vegetables were just picked off a tree. The bread they serve you is very good they toasted in not and crispy. For my entree I got the cavatellii fresh pasta with \u00a0tomatoes and reggiano parmagina. The quality is excellent and the prices are good too nice size portion for the money $14.

I am saying my girlfriend and I but it is great for bigger parties too. The food is delicious and very affordable. You need to try the burrata cheese which to me is probably the best one I tried in Miami. We usually share the burrata and 2 orders of pasta. You can't really go wrong with the pasta as they are all delicious. It mainly depends of the mood you are in. Waiters are always very polite and look happy to serve you. You know what?

You really feel like you're in Italy here.We decided to go somewhere after the \"Second saturday art walk\" to grab a bite to eat and hopefully watch the Heat game. Our friend suggested Salmueria 104 and we called to make sure that they had a tv/were playing the game. We ended up snagging a table for 5 right in front of the tv, literally. The restaurant was full but then again it is a very small restaurant.Their wine list is by price, which I like, and they have several wines under ONE price bracket. The wine was amazing and the waiter told us that he is actually from the town where the wine was made. We then went on to have a conversation with him about why he moved to Miami (just three short years ago) and where has traveled throughout the world (he traveled extensively for one year prior to moving to Miami). It was interesting to meet someone in Miami who fortunately, doesn't have rocks for a brain!!!!! YessssssI started with a salad (with lemon dressing). It was light and refreshing. I then just had pasta with mariana sauce. My fiance had the steak and our guests had speck/also pasta with mariana sauce. It was delicious. It's actually tough to make a pasta with mariana sauce because I frequently make that at home and am constantly comparing it to my own doing so I am pretty critical on this simple dish! It was amazing though.The prices are sooooo affordable (shocking almost) as our wine was $30 and my salad was $7! My pasta was like $15 or something, wow. I guess we are too accustomed to the $100+ wine and $16 salads in South Beach. No mas! We will be spending a lot more time in midtown at Salmueria 104!"], ["Arielle S.", "Delicious brunch! The baguette and potatoes were particularly good. Reasonably priced for the quantity and quality received (in Miami). Will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner!"]]}
