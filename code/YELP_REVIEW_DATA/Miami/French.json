{"Downtown Bistro": [], "Otentic Fresh Food Restaurant": [["James B.", "We only ordered 2 plates but they were both EXCELLENT... and very filling, which is not usually the case for me. Service was very good. I came on Saturday night and the place was definitely more on the empty side. The food came out super quick, which was a nice plus. Ordered: - Steak Maurice: Highly recommend it. The only downer of the plate were the pieces of pure fat embedded in the steak. There were a few too many of these chunks of fat that was just inedible. Other than that, the plate was outstanding, 5 out of 5. The steak is a 12oz ribeye with some melted brie and mushroom sauce over some gratin potatoes. This combo is as good as it gets. At $28 it's one of their more expensive dishes, but it is probably one of their best as well. - Otentic Pasta: The pasta was heavy, creamy, and very filling. It came with pork belly, ham, cream, and plenty of shredded cheese. Just looking at the ingredients you can see it's a very fatty pasta, but it tasted soooo goood. It's a very safe option for picky eaters bc it's basically like a bacon pasta. The stars of the dish are the pork belly, the strong flavors of the shredded cheese, and creamy textures of the pasta. Definitely recommend this pasta."], ["Ivy Z.", "The octopus salad/appetizer special is to die for. \u00a0We kind of wished we could've just ordered like 3 of them to make a meal out of it! \u00a0The texture of the octopus was so perfectly cooked. \u00a0It was full of deep flavors that lingered in your mouth and melted as you chewed.I ordered the rib eye course and my friend ordered the roasted chicken so that we could share since we couldn't decide between the two. \u00a0The ribeye was cooked perfectly. \u00a0However, the roasted chicken was a little dry for me.We had a large group of 12(?) girls and they gave each of us a complimentary glass of chardonnay. \u00a0The service was excellent and I am still thinking about that damn octopus...!!"], ["Juan S.", "Wow amazing meal here.This place had been on my radar for a long time and I finally got around to going here.Tremendous value, really tasty food and nice unobtrusive service.This place will be one of my new regulars."], ["Gam B.", "Amazing place if you're looking for a decent French and seafood meals.

I would visit Miami again just for this restaurant!"], ["German M.", "I came to Otentic on a Saturday night with a party of 9 and had a great time. As soon as we checked in, we were taken to our reserved table. We sat outside and I wouldn't recommend sitting outside because there's no air flow in the allocated seating area. The server immediately welcomed us with water without requesting it and a small glass of Chardonnay to taste. I tried their Otentic and goat cheese salads and they were alright with a great nut and fruit combination which made them memorable. This was the first time I tried the escargot and I really liked the way it was seasoned.For the main course, I had the scallops and they were very flavorful with an incredibly tasty side of couscous and veggies. For dessert, we had the sampler and my favorite was the chocolate mouse -- it was very rich. In terms of presentation, the plates were a bit overwhelming due to big proportions in small plates which diminished the visual appeal.The appetizers took about 20 mins and the main dishes took about an hour to come out. The desserts came right away. So, make sure you plan accordingly.Overall, we had a great experience at Otentic. The price point is great compared to restaurants in SoBe and the food quality does not disappoint."], ["Dany B.", "At last!I found the best restaurant in Miami Beach!The food was great!They greet us with a little cups of white wine for appetite and bread with a very nice dip.The atmosphere is romantic,yet casual and cozy.The service was great as well!I had a special request to have the salmon very well done and they took care of that!Would recommend 100% ,I also think its a perfect place for a first date.It is reasonably priced as well!"], ["Isabel M.", "I couldn't believe a restaurant like this existed! A French restaurant, with reasonable prices, good service and sizeable portions.We came for dinner and then returned immediately the next day for brunch. That's testament to how great this place is. Between us on both visits we had the grilled salmon, roasted chicken, brunch chicken sandwich with avocado, and brunch special of a bacon, brie and egg crepe. All the meat was tender, fresh and cooked perfectly. All the sides and sauces were exquisite. I must especially mention the fluffy, light gratin dauphinoise that came with my roast chicken. They were just the perfect compliment to the thin but INCREDIBLY tasty porcini sauce and the crispy skin and soft flesh of the roasted chicken. A real stand out meal. Service was slightly aloof but thoroughly efficient and knowledgeable. On both visits, we were greeted with free glasses of Chardonnay and fresh bread. Water was constantly refilled and no one pressurised us into buying wine when we just wanted sodas.The desserts and coffee looked incredible but on both occasions we were way too full after the entrees to even think about trying them. It's not that the entree portions were giant, but the ingredients so wholesome and the meals so well-crafted that we were totally satisfied after eating.Definitely up there with one of the nicest restaurants I've visited recently. Oh, and unlike many other restaurants in South Beach, there's no annoying hostess outside pressurising you and screeching at you to come in. Extra points for that."], ["DeeDee G.", "Ordered the rib eye steak and eggs, medium and a strawberry, banana and nutella crepe - it was excellent. \u00a0My only comment would be that the steak lunch was supposed to come with a small salad which actually amounts to no more than a few pieces of lettuce..would have loved a small salad Otherwise, a most enjoyable meal. \u00a0will be ordering again!"], ["Jonathan K.", "This was an incredible experience. Fine food, great service, and an incredible wine and beer list. The octopus was a real treat! This place is perfect for a romantic date. Proust is written across the ceiling and wall.

It's another Miami Beach hidden gem off of Washington Avenue: a french inspired atmosphere. \u00a0Amazing, they serve you a glass of chardonnay (just like in France) when you arrive at the restaurant as you were being welcomed/seated. Recommendations: french onion soup, grilled octopus (if you like octopus), mussels i wine sauce, sun dried tomatoes and olives with pate, and the Crazy Platter. \u00a0The Crazy Platter (foie gras, brushetta Serrano, merguez & squash skewer, machego, tuna tartar, charlotte d'avocado), as an appetizer is big enough to share in a group of 2 or more people. Fortunately our group was fairly large, and we ordered 14 plates of food and did a family style french outing."], ["Kristina L.", "Cute little hip place. Very Otentic!The service here was great and our waitress (Asian lady, wish I new her name) was super nice and friendly. She always had a smile on her face.Comp Chardonnay... I was thinking... Is this a dream?!?Seated octopus: - Appetizer - BEST DISH!Nothing of this kind. By far the best cooked octopus I've ever tasted!! Celery mixed with capers, and tomatoes with a delicious sauce smothered on top.Steak Maurice - waitress said that this place is known for this dish. It Was covered in mushroom sauce with melted Bree on top.Seared Scallops - with quinoa - delicious, however, more on the salty side, but the scallops where so soft like butter, melts in your mouth.If I am every in this area again, I would definitely some back! Its so cute, the staff is super nice. I am a fan!"], ["Jeannette F.", "Decided to try this place out after reading the glowing reviews. We got the escargot and mussels to start with a side of the homemade french fries to start. Amazing flavor, and neither were gritty. We were basically too full for our entrees, which were the pork and roasted chicken, and those were amazing as well. The prices more than matched the quality and portions of the appetizers and entrees. We will definitely be adding this to one of our favorite local spots!"], ["Danny L.", "The Otentic is a great restaurant that gives you quality as well as solid bang for your buck. A random Thursday lunch at this place for us consisted first of complimentary shots of champagne, a flavorful country duck terrine appetizer. Tender salmon and rich pesto cooked linguine and my sandwich. \u00a0The Comme Labas, which was a solid size, flavorful, smoky merguez sausage sandwich with a sweet red onion taste and spicy kick. Also came with small salad and fresh fries. \u00a0Good food, good prices, and cute decor makes this a much better place than most of the money grabs at south beach"], ["Jorge R.", "The food is great, and it is in a great location.

Excellent service. Remarkable value.One of the best casual meals I've had in Miami (ever?).True gem. I'll be back as often as possible."], ["Chris W.", "This place was amazing! Walking distance from the Hilton Bentley and the beach. When we sat down, they served us complimentary wine. We ordered their mussel appetizer which is cooked in a creamy sauce that was great for dipping bread and sharing! We had their blackened salmon and roasted chicken. Both nicely cooked, especially the chicken. Probably some of the best roasted chicken I've had in a while.

Between the amazing, attentive service to the complimentary champagne which both are unusual for beach restaurants, you'd think I wouldn't mind going above 3, but the food was just lackluster.We had the escargot, nothing out of this world. The French Onion soup I must say was one of the best I've had. For the price I paid I expected it to be.Service was outstanding. Very attentive, very accommodating.

We sat outside but luckily it was cool since the sun had set, and our waiter was the sweetest man. Get the Otentic Pasta, SOOOO GOOD! I just looked at the description with pork belly, cream and egg and had to have it, not what I was expecting for a French restaurant but damn so good! Also I'm used to seeing high dollar signs for French food but his place was actually affordable, most things in menu range fork $15 - $25.

I was also surprised that it was pretty empty for primetime lunch. But I did Google it and then found on yelp that It had pretty good reviews so decided to try it out. They had a lunch special for $14 which included a soup or salad main dish (one of the specials) and a dessert which was chocolate cake. Today the specials were either a steak or salmon. Me and my friend both had the steak. I asked the waitress what kind of steak it was and she didn't seem to know. However it did come out pretty juicy, I believe it was a ribeye. She brought us complementary tastes of the wine they had on special which was good and some bread which was nice before meals came. The place had a very French appeal to it. They even had French music playing in the background at one point. also played a lot of old-school stuff like Etta James. Needless to say I enjoyed the music and the atmosphere. It even had French writing on the walls literally..\" even on the ceiling. It's a small place.

The steak is as soft as butter!! Mmmmm deelish! My 8 year old son begs to go here every weekend because he can eat the entire plate and you can't blame him lol.

If I have to face the dirty-foot smell of Carrabba's one more time, I may go nuts and take some hostages.The cafe is very small and narrow; I think they put too much space behind the counter, which is where they prepare food. When the waitress moves from table to table, she has to navigate a pretty narrow passage in order to keep from bumping into people's backs. I counted 14 seats, if memory serves. The cafe uses simple wooden tables for two. Most are in a single row along a side wall. One person faces the wall; the other faces the partition between the open-air cooking area.The cafe appears to be SURGICALLY clean. That's very nice. A restaurateur who displays filth out front is probably doing incredibly disgusting things behind the scenes.They have French cafe food (surprise, surprise). You can order a croque monsieur, onion soup, salade nicoise, various sandwiches on baguettes, and desserts such as eclairs and tarts. Their menu is on their website.I had a half-sandwich and onion soup. I ordered a turkey sandwich, but the owner's wife brought me chicken. Oh well. The bread was hot and yeasty. The \"Cajun mayonnaise\" on the meat was good, but it leaned more toward the blandness of French food than the heat of Cajun cuisine.The onion soup was very nice, but it seemed sweeter than it should have been, and it was a little low on salt. It came with two crusty pieces of bread floating in it. For all I know, this is how onion soup tastes in France, but in the US, it's usually less sweet, with more salt.They brought the sandwich out after I finished my soup. That's just crazy. It kills the whole point of the dish. It's \"soup and sandwich,\" not \"soup and THEN sandwich.\"I ordered pommes frites instead of salad, purely to see what a good French cook would do with French fries. I remembered having wonderful fries in France, cooked in flavorful olive oil. The ones they served me at Cafe Bonjour were somewhat more restrained. They were cut extremely thin, like shoestrings, and there was very little fat remaining on them. I wasn't able to detect any identifiable flavor in the oil, so maybe it was canola. The fries were executed very well, even if they didn't have the olive taste I missed.The food came quickly. Apart from the sandwich error and a wobbly table, there were no problems.I got an eclair to go, again out of curiosity. I was a little disturbed to find it had chocolate filling. I am used to getting vanilla-flavored pastry cream in eclairs; maybe that's not the French way. The filling seemed to lean more toward American chocolate pudding than a French concoction, but my knowledge of eclair filling is based on the vanilla type, so maybe it was perfect. I would not buy another eclair there. It was good, but it didn't do much for me. I missed the chocolate outside versus vanilla inside battle I'm used to, and the filling just didn't say \"France.\"It's nice to eat in a place where they obviously care about standards. It's also very unusual. The food is good, the place is clean, there is plenty of parking, and it's a great place for lunch. If you need a better recommendation than that, I'll also point out that the people at the other tables were speaking French."], ["Berta C.", "First time at Cafe Bonjour today for lunch.

The service is quirky, yet pleasant and feels more like you're at a large family dinner than a restaurant. The Soup du Jour was Tomato, not one of my favs, so we opted to share the calamari and were not disappointed. A nest of expertly seasoned, crispy, lightly fried, battered rings of tender calamari arrived in a parchment lined bowl. Fresh herbs, lemon and a zesty aioli accompanied perfectly. For our entrees, the Steak Frites, of course, and the Duck confit. I had the duck, and while it is extremely hard to pass on the much-raved about Steak Frites, Duck Confit is very hard to come by in a non-$$$$ restaurant. Upon our entree's arrival my beau was presented with a mountain of glistening hand-cut fries, sliced filet topped with an almost-finished-melting dollop of herbed compound butter and a crisp simple salad.The duck, served with delightfully cooked and un-fussed over root vegetables, arrived with no liquid or sauce to speak of. I was concerned at first, but the thought quickly vanished from my mind upon first bite. Absolute food candy, duck heaven. Impossible to not eat every bite of either dish. Don't dare pass on dessert, take it home at the very least. You can't really go wrong, but the chocolate cake, a divine combination of mousse and meringue is so crazily rich and light at the same time. Definitely make reservations!"], ["Rachel P.", "Perfect date night to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary at Cafe Bonjour inside of a strip mall nonetheless!

We did call to make a 7:30 reservation since this is a small restaurant that fills up quickly, so I highly suggest calling ahead if you plan to go at your typical breakfast/lunch/dinner time. We started out with the Warm Goat Cheese Salad which was probably one of the best salads I have had. They split the salad for us and we still had a very large portion. It had warm goat cheese, tomatoes, walnuts, & warm bacon. The warm goat cheese was of course the best part and such a large serving of it was a nice touch. Next came the steak and frites (excellent) and one of their specials which I ordered, \u00a0roasted red pepper raviolis stuffed with warm mushrooms and goat cheese covered in a creme sauce (heavenly!!). We shared our dishes like we often do and we agreed since we rarely eat french fries, these would be the ones we would want to splurge on. The steak was on the small side, but very tender and juicy. So of course the best part was the chocolate cake. It is like nothing either of us have ever had, super moist \u00a0and rich chocolate cake with a crunchy outside texture.

It has nice outside seating, minus the traffic flow. I had the chicken curry which was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend got the lunch special which came with choice of soup or salad, entr\u00e9e and dessert for only ten bucks! This was a total steal because the entr\u00e9e itself was huge. He had the salad and pork chop. The salad was good and had a simple homemade dressing. The pork was cooked perfectly and the dish was extremely filling. Total comfort food. For his dessert they brought rice pudding, which was the best I've ever had. I am rating them four stars instead of five because the server didn't bring me my side of rice pudding to go that I asked for(which I was very sad about lol) and because of the location and lack of parking. I would definitely recommend this restaurant regardless, the food was perfect and they had fair prices."], ["Natalie I.", "I'd say this is a neighborhood gem.

She knew the menu, had the specials memorized and was able to answer all our questions. One of the most compatent and freindly waitriss I have encoutered in awhile. I would say this is french american food and i just love sauces that everything came in. I got the duck special, i love duck most places do not do duck right. I don't know why duck is so hard to cook. I had amazing duck in China and then truly epic duck in Juno beach however when I get it in Miami its always a fail. This place did duck right. It was moist not greasy and the sauce it came in was yummy. My guy got the mussels he loved them, and the creamy white sauce it came in.Sadly we didn't have time for desert due to the heat but we will be back."], ["Tony R.", "We tried this place for the first time about 2 years ago. It was quite good but out of our way. But, we recently tried it again and had the duck confit. Another reviewer said it best. \"Poorly fried chicken.\" Although confit is to be crunchy on the outside, it must be moist, fall off the bone on the inside. This was neither. The side of potato was ok. Glass of ros\u00e9 wine: perfect.That's is all."], ["Lou D.", "We biked over to Buena Vista on Mother's Day and had the sweetest afternoon.

My friends and I went last Sunday morning for brunch and the whole experience was just easy, enjoyable, and delicious, nonetheless.So basically I recommend valet parking which is in front of mandolin aegean bistro (less than a block away, not a long walking distance). It's like $3-$5 and takes away the hassle of looking for parking on the street or getting your car towed. Unfortunately we saw someone's car getting towed so don't risk it! Just valet. Anyways, my favorite part of buena vista bistro was the live music!!! It was a 3 man band with a piano, saxophone and cello. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather. We decided to start with mimosas and ordered eggs Benedict, Spanish omelette and the French toast. I can't begin to tell you how delicious the French toast was. I've never had anything so perfect in my life lol. It was like toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet or drenched in maple syrup- it was just right. The fruit on top added the final touch. I had the Spanish omelette and it was delicious! In my opinion, it's really hard to mess up an omelette but this one is really worth trying. It had onions and peppers and came with a side of potatoes, sliced tomatoes, and toast. It certainly was a large amount of food, lol. I didn't get to try the eggs Benedict but my friends devoured it off their plates and said it was delicious as well. The service was good but slow towards the end. Good friends and good food... It was a perfect morning!"], ["Jen C.", "Delicious. This was my first real meal in Miami, and it was so great that I don't want to move from my temporary lodgings.

The sea bass is still to date one of my biggest recommendations on the menu and I have yet to hear from an unsatisfied diner. I just wish I didn't smell like food when I leave, alas that is just part of the charm of a bistro this size.

Easy and authentic. Portions are good and food is very tasty. They also have delicious fries :)"], ["Airam G.", "Five stars for the food and the waiter service (best quiche I ever had). ZERO STARS FOR THE TYRANNICAL MANAGER-DIVA MAN. I don't know the manager's name, but WATCH OUT for the tattooed, Dolce Gabana sunglasses wearing, and egotistical manager-diva. We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon after the place we were going to go to was unexpectedly closed. The Buena Vista Deli was at capacity, so we were told to sit at the Bistro and that we would be served there. Cool. So, we walk into the Bistro and have a seat. Within seconds we are served delicious, ice-cold water by the greatest waiter, a beautiful man with a heart of gold. This kind man probably has a family, and he is working hard to feed them all. Every day. Working hard.HOWEVER, at this establishment there is also an evil, bully-man, tyrannical MANAGER-DIVA. This roadkill of a man was talking down to the poor waiter in front of the customers for \"not working well.\" This waiter is an angel. He doesn't know English well. He's timid. But this jerkface was humiliating him for \"not working well\", when in reality he was the most gentle and loving and attentive and lovable waiter ever. He meanly told him that he \"couldn't believe what he was doing\" and that \"he could go home if he wanted to.\" I wish I could have taken him home and away from that hell-hole of a restaurant. Not only did the scum-dump manager make this little precious man feel bad, he also had the AUDACITY to make sarcastic remarks behind his back and HYPOCRITICALLY be falsely nice to the all the other hipster-rich employees and customers. This manager is the spawn of Satan. Literally. Nobody deserves to talk to such a beautiful and gentle man down like that. Especially such an ugly person who probably came from NOTHING and is bullying his employees. I recommend this restaurant ONLY for the food and for the waiter that I was lucky enough to meet.

They serve the local panther coffee and I'm always a big fan of locally owned businesses supporting eachother. 2. Dining out in Miami, if you want good quality food is not cheap and for what you get BVD is very reasonably priced. 3. The Quiche Combo! This is the best bang for your buck. I love love love the mushroom and goat cheese quiche and I usually get the tuna Ni\u00e7oise salad. Both wonderful. 4. The ambience- they have a quaint little deli style inside and a nice shady outdoor patio. Though if it's really hot, sitting outside is your best option. The inside doesn't have central air and can get a little hot. Only 2 complaints;1. The wait staff can be a little... Unfriendly, we will say. They are not very attentive and sometimes have to be reminded to give you more water etc. Not a huge deal breaker for me as it's only sometimes. 2. A lot of their breakfast items, although wonderful, are pre made. So if there is something you don't want- you have to suck it up. I have only ever come for breakfast/ brunch, never for dinner but I'm always pleased. If it's busy- you'll be seated fast. Tables turn quickly!"], ["Monica S.", "My favorite Sunday brunch goes to BVB. Mostly, the french toast alone makes the menu (and brunch) as amazing as it is. Simply put, there's no other restaurant in the world that can make french toast as good as the BVB version. The photo I snapped of the meal only begins to suggest what's in store for your senses, but with each bite of sheer decadence, it's total bliss. The other breakfast favorite is their Spanish Omelet. As far as eggy creations go, this simple and veggie packed item is perfect as your savory counterpart to that sparkling mimosa. Out with your dog? You can enjoy brunch from their outdoor covered patio, it's completely shaded and you'll likely find most diners enjoying their fare from one of the many tables. So yeah, if you're heading to BVB, wait for a Sunday afternoon to pick from the best brunch (you won't be able to catch the french toast on any other day)."], ["Fiorella B.", "I had the crab cakes and the scallops and both were amazing!

The guava croissant is magnificent as well. I've also started going during the week in the mornings around 9am/9:30am and the line is not bad at all. During the week I've been able to try the mini cheese Danish, mini chocolate croissant and mini cinnamon roll. They cost about $1 and I think it's the perfect size for a quick morning snack. So far all the pastries I've tried here have been wonderful. The only thing that was kind of meh was the \"colada\" I ordered one time. It was kind of flat and bitter. Tasted like American coffee that had been sitting in the pot for some time. But the cortadito is always on point.

We split the prosciutto with mozzarella and the Parisian which normally has salami and Brie cheese, but I substituted turkey for the salami. Wow. The prosciutto is served hot with a pesto like spread and the most yummy mozzarella I have ever had. Loved this sandwich. The Parisian is just as good but served cold. I think it would be even better served hot. It has an amazing Dijon sauce and the Brie is so,yum.

Still terrible. Fruit is far from ripe. Chicken is tough and tasteless. Salad is like the salad you'd get from a typical Cuban restaurant (iceberg, unripe tomato wedge, balsamic vinegar on the side). Nearly $100 with tip to feed a family of four, everyone left hungry and dissatisfied. Le Provencal on Coral Way, that is where you spend $100 and are happy. Bistro Foly on Old Cutler Road in Palmetto Bay, another $100 well spent.

They use fresh ingredients, maybe not like the over flavored, high sodium ingredients now commonly rampant in most restaurants, but its refreshing for food to taste like its originally meant to. While I'm personally not a fan of the vegetables, the sauces such as the mushroom sauce from the Chicken hunter are great. Restaurant owners can't taste every dish and sometimes chefs occasionally drop the ball, but I have no doubts that if you bring up any complaints to the manager he/she would not only be grateful, but would also make the necessary changes to please his clientele. For the price, the restaurant is exceptional. And its also refreshing to still have these types of family run businesses around that should be supported rather than the common chain restaurants that microwave their food and mask flavor with salt."], ["Dennis A.", "My to-go spot for lunch. \u00a0A good home cooked meal from a family owned business. When choosing between a quick bite at a fast food rest or chain , this place is the way to go. \u00a0I usually call in my lunch special and it's only a few dollars more then fast food. \u00a0May not be the date night spot but a good spot for locals."], ["Adela A.", "Had dinner here with my family on the last day our Groupon was expiring. \u00a0I will never eat there again.

Waitress said it was the owners order since it was a Groupon. \u00a0Too bad, I would have left my usual 20% tip since the waitress was not to blame for the lousy food and the service was good.

NO! \u00a0This place is small and quaint! \u00a0Which is fine! \u00a0But right from the start with the appetizers you could tell that the quality of food was below average. \u00a0The lunch sandwiches were just sandwiches. \u00a0Nothing worth coming back to this place. \u00a0True..

Nobody checked on us except to bring the check. \u00a0I raised my concern about the soup issue to a server who blamed everything on the waiter that we never saw again and apologized. \u00a0Service was lacking that day and the salads were mediocre. \u00a0Not sure we'll try it again."], ["Carlos B.", "This is a small casual cute restaurant!

It's an adorable French cafe in the Grove. The set-up is half indoors / half outdoors but it's an open indoors so you get plenty of fresh air. I'm giving it four stars because they allow smoking outside and because of this open set-up and the fact that the place is intimate, you can smell the smoke in the entire inside of the restaurant. Though I typically want the authentic foreign experience at a restaurant, this was too much for me. Otherwise, the place is perfect. For brunch, I shared the banana pancakes and the eggs Benedict in addition to having a piece of a chocolate croissant. Everything was absolutely delicious. In particular, I thought the banana pancakes were out of this world. How do they make them so good? Why can't I make them like that at home? The brunch at Le Bouchon Du Grove is extremely affordable. I've even heard that they give you free mimosas on Sundays! The dinner looks more expensive but I'm sure it's also delicious. The service here is great. The place is so small that you're always near a waiter. I also like that they left a carafe of water on the table so I can refill my water glass to my heart's delight.

We got reservations for 4 on a Saturday night. We were first greeted with a free glass of champagne. Nice! (I believe this was because a Jazz Fest event going on in The Grove). We also got a basket of french bread and butter. The ambiance was nice and somehow romantic but very hot. All windows and doors were open and it was very warm out. Wear something light and refreshing if you are coming here on a warm night. This was in November so I can't even imagine dining here during summer time. My husband ordered a bottle of wine (Pinot Noir) and unfortunately it was nothing special and \u00a0 it lacked body. Our waiter strongly recommended for appetizer the Escargots (snails) and honestly they were OK. The texture is gummy and it lacks flavor. Nothing you really need to taste in life!For my main entree I ordered the New York Steak and it came with a red wine sauce that was not tasty at all. I ordered medium well and I definitely got well done. French fries are frozen fries, nothing special. Definitely not a $25 plate. Overpriced for the quality of what you get!My husband ordered the Roasted Snapper filet and it was crispy, salty and just delicious. I didn't get to try the ratatouille but it looked good. Note: It's a small dish; thank goodness I didn't finish my steak and my husband ate half of it. My friends shared the Mussels and they really liked them. I tried them and they were good and has a nice flavor. It was a big portion good for two people. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulee and what a big disappointment. We were expecting something creamy and with some taste of vanilla but it was nothing like that. Not sure about coming back to this place. Maybe for brunch! Maybe!"], ["Wendy L.", "Come here if your looking for something a little different for breakfast, lunch or weekend brunch!! This is one of the best places I've been to in Miami for brunch. The portions are perfect and the prices are reasonable for the quality you get. You will love it here if you're a fan of French food or just love breakfast/brunch items like me. I loved their raspberry pancakes. They use fresh raspberries, balancing tart and sweet. They cooked over medium eggs perfectly and their breakfast potatoes are standout. Get the French onion soup, especially if you love cheese--they definitely don't skimp on the good stuff! They also have a huge wine selection. The decor is pretty rustic and it's open to the outside, so it's pretty warm inside during the summer, but not uncomfortable to the point where you are sweating during your meal. They have a bunch of overhead fans which helps. It's definitely a cozy little place and their bathroom is super cute, but there's only one stall available. I was happy with the service here, the food was brought out at a reasonable time and our bread basket was refilled."], ["Jenny C.", "I have told this story to a few close friends, and now I will share with the whole world: the chicken fricassee once saved my life. Many, as in 4, years ago I went to dinner with a group of friends here. Right before we went I got very sick off of 2 blue moons (perhaps a small sign of gluten intolerance which I refuse to investigate) and almost canceled on dinner. Well, I soldiered up and didn't plan to eat, but ordered this just in case. When it arrived, the clouds parted in the sky and the sun shined down upon me. I actually heard God whisper, \"it's alright child, you may eat now.\" I happily indulged in the feast before me and felt nothing but wonderful afterwords.

We had a look at their menu and decided to stop.Know that the seating at this restaurant is a bit cramped - the tables for two seem to be tucked into spaces behind doors, in corners, etc. and if you select one of the tables for 4 to sit at, they will put another couple of 2 next to you, seated about 2 or 3 inches away so there's little privacy. This happened to us, and luckily both our groups had a sense of humor about it and managed to carry on our own conversations, but I'd not been in a seating situation this cramped since I visited New York City.Once we were seated, a server was there right away with 2 complimentary mimosas for us, a basket of bread and butter and a carafe of ice water. \u00a0I ordered the ham, mushroom and cheese omelet with roasted potatoes, my friend got the salmon tartare. \u00a0Both our meals were very good, we were happy and the service remained attentive throughout the meal, but I would note that my potatoes were quite salty, and the omelet was a touch on the salty side as well. \u00a0That said, I was satisfied with the food overall and would come here again."], ["Sally R.", "Came here for the first time on Friday (Memorial day weekend 2015) around 8:30pm...We were thinking of catching a movie but we had some time to kill so we decided to take a walk in the Grove and try a new place for us since we always go to the same places. \u00a0We were thinking to get a few drinks since we wanted to make it to a movie so nothing really big...First, we stopped at La Gamba, a Spanish place, and we were not accommodated so with that bad incident in mind we took another chance and went across the street to Le Bouchon. \u00a0Thank God we did because we found a jewel!!!! They were not only very friendly and accommodating but the food was excellent even though the place was packed!!! \u00a0 In my opinion, that is a sign of a good restaurant with a talented chef.

Making it very hot if you go during the day.  \u00a0 \u00a0We came for brunch on a Sunday for a friends birthday. Once we were seated, each of us received a complimentary mimosa. Great start! I ordered the 2 eggs with canadian bacon and potatoes, as well as the french toast. We didn't have to wait very long to receive our meals, maybe about 15-20 min, and the place was pretty packed. The food itself was very good, and the french toast was fluffy. As of now, I was having a great eperience. \u00a0 \u00a0The waiter overheard us talking about my friends birthday, so he told us, \"Oh you should've told me it was her birthday, I would've brought you a dessert as a courtesy. Would you like for me to bring you a dessert with a candle?\". We were full by this point, so we politely declined. He asked us again, \"Are you sure?\". We replied by saying, \"Yea its fine\". He said, \"We always like to give our customers a dessert for their birthday\". He had already asked us various times, and since he said it was a courtesy, we decided to accept. He brought the dessert, a chocolate mousse, which was very tasty. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It came time to pay for our meal, and we saw that the dessert was added to our bill. We thought it was an error so we told the waiter about it. He told us that he never said that the dessert was for free. Since the mimosas were for free they cant give us the dessert for free. My mother and I both told him that we understood that he meant it would be for free. He again said, that he never told us it would be for free. By this point, I was frustrated because he clearly told us it was a courtesy. It wasn't just me who heard him, but everyone else in my party did as well. I honestly felt lied to, because he kept insisting us to get the dessert. If it was up to us, we would have never even gotten the dessert!  \u00a0 \u00a0Overall, the food was great, there is no denying that.

I was tempted to leave when I came to Le Bouchon and was not received by anyone, instead standing in the doorway/front of the restaurant for probably ten minutes and being completely ignored. No one came out or even indicated for us to come in. I'm hoping this was a one off day even though they did not seem busy and had tables ready. We finally got in when a patron after us went inside and almost demanded service for both of our tables.Now on to the food - I had a tasty red pepper omelette and my boyfriend had a Cajun shrimp omelette. Both were good and we enjoyed the free mimosa as well. The portions of the omelettes were not large, so if you have a bigger appetite, you may need to order a side. French bread was provided with butter and was fresh and soft.

It was still a little early but it didn't have the crowd I was expecting and that I saw a week earlier when I just happened to drive by. The restaurant is small and the tables are tightly packed together. We chose our table and sat down and ordered a bottle of french Pinot Grigio wine. I dont really drink often but my wife and our friend later finished the bottle and said it was great. A very nice waiter who was from france and had a heavy french accent suggested we start out with the Charcuterie Platter which we did. The ladies were drinking wine and the Charcuterie platter was served and we just sat and nibbled at the meat and cheeses for about a half hour and started our night just perfectly. We ordered our meals around 7:30 and the place was starting to fill up and we continued chatting. I ordered the Homemade Duck Legs Confit, our friend ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Chicken Fricasse. About 15 minutes later our meals were served and everything looked terrific. What did catch my eye was that the Chicken Fricasse was served in a cast iron pot kind of thing and not on a traditional plate and it was really big.We all started to eat and my duck legs were really good. The skin was light and crispy and the meat was very tender and moist. I would have to say it was in the top 5 \u00a0duck dishes I've ever had. I loved the fact that it came with 2 duck legs instead of just the one you usually get. The Chilean Sea bass was really good as well as it presented beautifully and baked to perfection. It was very flakey and not overcooked or undercooked. I only had a sample bite but I liked it a lot.Now here's the game changer. While I was eating my duck legs my wife kept commenting on how good her Chicken Fricasse was and that I needed \u00a0to try it. Since she is a picky eater I thought to myself hmmm, it must be really good. So about the time I finished my duck my wife was a little tipsy from the wine and told me she was finished and said I can have the rest of her chicken. Since she raved about it i took the dish and sat it right in front of me and took my first bite. Almost instantly I was like OMG, OMG, OMG this Chicken Fricasse is AWESOME. \u00a0I freaking loved it and kept eating until I finished the whole thing. It was not only was the best chicken dish I've ever had it was one of the best meals I've ever had as it truly tasted incredible. I cannot go into the details of what all the ingredients were in the dish because I don't really know what was in it. I did taste a creamy mushroom flavor but the chicken was mixed in a pot of who knows what and it was unbelievably good. I think I \u00a0loved this dish more than Christmas as a child so when you eat here you HAVE to order the Chicken Fricasse. It's the best dish you're ever going to eat, trust me.By 8:00pm it was very busy and people were packed in like sardines because the tables are so close to each other but it feels more like a family get together rather than a restaurant. Everybody was talking to everybody.This is a great place with a great vibe and an incredible menu. I'll definitely be back often and you if you come here you will not be disappointed."], ["Frances T.", "Excellent French Restaurant! The quality of the food is always good.

You can't just have great food, service is as important and sometimes more important than the food. It's not that the waiter was bad (although he seemed to be paying more attention to the big parties) it was that he had way too many tables to handle! Even the best server cannot properly manage so many people. It's a matter of being properly staffed on a big holiday weekend so your customers have a good experience. Not sure if management knows of this problem as there was no manager to be seen! The food was excellent. I had the Salad with large grilled shrimp. Very tasty and tempting to bring me back.

When you look at the pictures, the French d\u00e9cor is really inviting for a place to walk into. \u00a0No doubt about that.

The waiter came over and I reminded him. \u00a0Now I was half way through my meal and I could hear the waiter asking the kitchen for \"that side of Canadian bacon\" 3 times. This was getting annoying. \u00a0Finally when my waiter brought over the Canadian Bacon, he just put it down on the table and mumbled something, I am not sure but it was not an apology or anything of the sort. \u00a0In fact he barely made eye contact with us. I think he was looking up at his other tables. \u00a0These people here never smiled and I felt like they were doing us a favor by serving us. \u00a0When we were done with the meal it was a little more busier, but this place is not that big and my waiter was only feet away from us most of the time. \u00a0Had to track down the check. \u00a0Got the check. I had to put my hand out with the credit card and the check for him to notice and when I got them back,, NO PEN. \u00a0So,,,, had to get up and ask for a pen. By then I wanted this \"experience\" just over. I really do not understand how a breakfast place like this that is pretty simple and has such nice d\u00e9cor and a great set up can make anyone feel like they did not want to be there. Maybe they didn't. On a positive note, the little French tables were set up with a carafe of water and 2 nice little wine/water glasses \u00a0 They had a bottle of some French Rose which added to the ambiance, cute. \u00a0The bread was served with a delicious raspberry spread, really delicious. \u00a0Beyond that, I will not be coming back here, sorry to say."], ["S T.", "I would give 3.5 stars if I could.

Big fat A+ for the kitchen staff! As for the waiters... I think Le bouchon would be a better place if they changed their waiter staff or had a long course on hospitality.You go there wanting a table... and you're either going to catch the waiters on a good mood where they will acknowledge your presence & sit you...

How nice that our hostess was able to take a break from her day and relax with the others. She sat us down, and we waited and waited for our waiter. He apparently like her was on a true French work week.When our waiter did arrive, he took our order of Escargot, Onion Soup, Veal Cheeks and Mussel's with two glasses of Cabernet. The waiter then disappeared. After two quick games of chess, and a read through of Tolstoy's War and Peace, the waiter came back with the onion soup and Escargot, but no bread or wine.The Escargot was good, the onion soup was ok, but still know wine. 10 minutes later our entr\u00e9e's arrived and I asked the waiter about our wine, again Ms. Abbey he was dumbfounded, our cabernet finally got there, just before it hit the vinegar stage.The mussel's were passable, but dry and overcooked. The Veal cheek's were inedible, So over salted, they tasted like Moses sandals.How can any chef salt that food that many times. I actually felt my body swell six times it's normal size, and not the part of my body that usually swells on every other Wednesday, and during computer porn night. Oh, and Abbey the wine, I mean vinegar didn't even mask the pathetic flavor of the veal cheeks.Well Ms. Abby, now that I have your attention, I'm not asking that God drop a cinder block on the head of our hostess, that imbacilic excuse for a hostess, I don't want Jesus or St. Peter to kick the chef in the gonads for not tasting his food prior to serving, I'd really hate to see the waiter stabbed in the face with a for, and force to spell the word ASSFACE in his own blood, till he get's it right. I don't even want the owner to die, while choking on his own vomit, from eating that nasty food, of course while seated with the imbicilic hostess. No Ms. Abby, what I'd like to know why this review will never become the Review Of The Day, since there rarely picked for there sarcasm, and lack of star appeal. \u00a0Abby Baby this was a horrible meal, I'm attempting to use good humor only to keep the food down. Others need to know! I used to love this place, now mmmeeeeehhh not so much."], ["David M.", "The food was pretty amazing. \u00a0I had that halibut risotto and my boyfriend had the mussels; the mussels where a large enough serving they could have fed a village. \u00a0Both dishes were fresh and packed with flavor. \u00a0The restaurant however is really cramped. You're elbow to elbow with the surrounding tables and service is really slow. \u00a0Maybe we were there on a an off night, but if you have plans after dinner, this isn't the place for you. \u00a0Come here planning on making an evening of it, and you'll experience a great French meal!"], ["Mead M.", "Fantastic French bistro in the heart of Coconut Grove with unbelievable seafood lamb beef service and atmosphere."], ["Alden K.", "Inexpensive place for French food, what's not to like?

We always order the steak au poivre (not on the menu) with potatoes au gratin and it never disappoints! We usually order a bottle of Cote du Rhone that was recommended by a waiter on one of our first visits. \u00a0I can't wait to go back once our baby is born and share a bottle with my hubby!The complimentary champagne and the overall vibe of the place almost makes you forget you're in Miami!"], ["Yuliya M.", "The food is delicious, staff are friendly and I definitely would come back again to try the dishes we haven't yet tried.

The bistro style food is very appropriate when walking around the area. The decorations in the restaurant are also very interesting and tell the story of this group well.Like other reviewers have touched on, this place can get full sometimes, and you may have to wait to be seated and wait for your food - I have never been disappointed, and take these moments as good opportunities to relax, sip on some good French wine, and enjoy the company of my family when I'm here.

And hardly anyone gives anything for free these days so free mimosas was a very nice welcome.The food was fantastic.

I have not tried Tour Eiffel on Biscayne or the Moroccan French called Rouge in North Beach. I have had one delicious lunch at La Fresa Francesca in Hialeah (highly recommended). Which brings me to Bistro Cassis. Now my review is based on only one sampling so maybe there are other dishes that are good. The quiche loraine had a pastry that was hard like a rock. I gave up trying to eat it one third of the way through. Lardon frisee salad would of been ok if the vinaigrette was not so sweet. The tarte tatin was acceptable. I don't think I will return. There is another French bistro that just opened in midtown ... Azur, but I am scared to try. I might have to wait until I am back in Paris to satisfy my \"envie\" for cuisine Francaise."], ["Sue S.", "This place is new, and tasted like a winner. A lot of classic French choices. We started with the terrine of fois gras, which was smoothe and deep flavored. The beef tenderloin topped with seared fois gras set upon tender asparagus was excellent. As were the lamb chops. There's not a huge red French wine selection, but several other origins available. There are also several choices of cocktails with a modern spin, aperitifs, Ricard, and champagne/sparkling wines. Classic,well prepared and presented desserts. I'll probably try the Ile Flottante next time, (because you rarely see that on a menu) but had the daily special of the tarte cassis. It was \u00a0a cold creamy custard atop a baked crust and served with fresh berries and white chocolate.Excellent server. The restaurant was quiet on Sunday evening, so we received very attentive service. All the wait staff were friendly and informative.

More offerings on the menu were: onion soup, escargots, mussels, chicken a la several ways, steaks, duck.

We went on the first night of Miami spice. The restaurant was not busy at all, yet it took the server 40 minutes just to get our twelve dollar drinks out to us. We asked him about 25 minutes into our wait, and he stated \"I've been rushing the bartenders, but they haven't made them yet.\" Mind you, this young gentleman hadn't been by the bar, and the bartenders were not busy in the least, but I digress. \u00a0When he finally brought us our drinks, they were completely watered down and this, combined with the fact that the glass was covered with condensation, made it obvious for us that the drinks had been sitting out for a long time. When we confronted the waiter about this, he said, and I swear to our mighty maker, that he tells us, \"That's how the drinks are in France. That drink tastes very watered down, that's why I usually don't recommend this particular drink.\" At that point we were very upset. IF that were the case (the drink tastes watered down normally), then why didn't he share with us his recommendation before placing the drink order?! \u00a0He didn't change our drinks, he just justified why the drink was not good. Needless to say, after this entire experience we were just annoyed. We were there for three and a half hours just to finish our dinner. That's how slow the service was. I cannot stress enough, the restaurant was NOT busy! I will NOT be coming back here again. The food was not worth the wait and the hassle. I will be taking my money elsewhere."], ["The E.", "Came to Bistro Cassis for Sunday brunch and was immediately surprised at how many times I had walked past it without noticing it was there. I have not been to many French places in Miami, but I had heard excellent things about their brunch menu. The very attentive waitstaff immediately brought out fresh bread and croissants, which were very delicious. I ordered the royal benedict which was two poached eggs on a croissant with smoked salmon and hollandaise. It was good, but not so over the top that I feel the need to come back. I also got to try the sandwich bouchere which was a sliced steak sandwich with caramelized onions. Once again it was good, not great. My biggest issue, which prevails for most brunch places was that mimosas and bellinis were $6 each, which is way to expensive. Although it was not a bad experience, there is too much brunch competition to just be good at this point."], ["T. B.", "Good food, good portions at reasonable prices.

We ordered our entrees and appetizers and after we finished our appetizers the waiter takes all our plates and says, \"Would you like some dessert?\" Huh? We only just ate our appetizers and are still waiting on our entrees. He realized his mistake and brought our plates and bread back. After the meal was done my friend asked for their tea selection, and said he'll bring the box of tea right out. After waiting for about 15 minutes we just asked for the check and left.

The crepe was ok, nothing spectacular and I wouldn't call it the best thing on the menu. My husband's quiche was pretty good and I would come back for it.

We had the vegan sausage quiche, ginger/carrot soup and a smoothie. They all were all delicious.

I'm sometimes left feeling a little hungry after eating at some vegan spots, but not the case this time!The place was clean and had a very positive vibe to it.
