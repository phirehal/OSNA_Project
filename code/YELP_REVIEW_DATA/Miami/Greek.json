I was hoping for a more traditional preperation of lamb only but it sufficed and tasted good.The tatziki sauce was homemade and very tasty while the fries were okay and seemed previously frozen.Service and ambiance were both good."], ["Carol M.", "What a wonderful terrace! This is a great place to dine al fresco. We went on a Sunday night and the place was packed. This restaurant is located around midtown and offers Mediterranean food. We ordered the stuffed zuchini, kefte - which is like beef and lamb meatballs -, the special of the night, wine and dessert. Everything was fresh and delicious. The waitress was attentive and took the time to explain the menu items. Highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends."], ["David L.", "Amazing dinner, can't wait to go back. Romaine salad with dill dressing is amazing. Staff was great!"], ["Lee G.", "Beautiful setting and good food. U go thru a wooden door and u r transported to Greece. Candlelit tables, a few sails die the daytime and a great atmosphere. Menu is simple. Great salads, cool veg and Kofte to start. Main courses of fish and chicken. All simply prepared and served with rice a mourasalata a kind of greek salad. \u00a0Service was decent without beg fussy. All was great except wine which was distinctly average. No cocktails. Definitely worth a trip to design district."], ["Claudia D.", "Very good artisan food. My concern is that the menu that is here is not updated, the plates actually have extra three dollars on each plate..."], ["Steph G.", "What an awesome spot! We went to meet friends for dinner and were so pleasantly surprised by the entire experience!The decor and feel of their outdoor space is perfect for a cool afternoon or summer evening. They have beautiful giant trees and umbrellas decorated in a very rustic manner. At night, the entire outdoor space is light with lanterns set on tables and gave a very romantic vibe.The food and drink was excellent! We ordered a pitcher of their white sangria which was so refreshing for the outdoors. For the Appetizer our group ordered calamari and the octopus. If you love octopus you will love this dish! It was cooked to perfection and the smokiness from the grill gave it a nice twist.For entree I ordered the rustic pasta, which was a bit heavy for me but extremely delicious. It's layers of very well seasoned ground beef, homemade noodles, and a vechamel sauce. Great meal to have before a night out!We ordered their pistachio baklava for dessert. I have a killer sweet tooth, so although this was great it was a bit on the salty/sweet side. Nonetheless, a great mix of pastry and honey!"], ["Marie M.", "I went there on a Sunday night, the atmosphere is very pleasant, it is way bigger inside than what it seems from outside. Very charming place.I got the stuffed zucchini as an appetizer and I really liked its unique and tasty flavor. Then, I ordered the whole fish, it was good, however, I have to say that I was quite surprised when I saw it didn't come with anything AT ALL! I get it, they charge for sides (and they are pretty expensive) but not even some vegetables or a small salad... I mean whatever they want but something... It was very strange to me.My husband got the moussaka, a typical Greek plate that is made with ground beef, eggplant and cheese, and it was delicious!"], ["Lindley L.", "PROs: As other reviewers have stated, this place is adorable and very quaint.- Great outdoor patio - Grecian colors and decor- Family- friendly- Ambiance is on pointHowever...CONs: Pretty much everything else. - Terrible service (this could have had something to do with the fact that it was somewhat busy, as are most Saturdays). Took us 15 minutes to get the check and then another 10 for her to actually pick up - Horrible white sangria. If you want to make at home, dump a bunch of Granny Smith apples into white zinfandel and chill. Disgusting- Grilled octopus was yummy, but you get ONE leg for $18 which is kind of ridiculous- Greek salad was the \"highlight\" of the meal: maybe 4 slices of cucumber, 5 Kalamata olives, 8 capers and then one hundred tomatoes. Oh, covered with a brick of feta cheese. Greek salad is pretty tough to mess up but somehow Mandolin has it down to an artBOTTOM LINE: I would never, EVER go back here to eat or recommend. To top off the shockingly bad dining experience, the food made 2/3 people sick within an hour. YUCK."], ["Steffi M.", "Amazing. Light. Clean. I'd 100 percent eat here again. They don't offer delivery, which is annoying, but worth the pickup. I can't believe someone gave it a bad review for not changing and redoing their menu to fit their diet trend. Go to a vegan restaurant if you'd like a massive selection of vegan food."], ["Lana N.", "Overall: wonderful outdoor atmosphere, perfect for a romantic date! As I looked at other reviews while I waited, I saw rave reviews of the Grilled Octopus and they did not disappoint. Make sure to squeeze the lemon on it, the dish was top notch! So my friend and I shared this as an appetizer with the bread they already provide. She got the pulled lamb sandwich that she said was okay, however she absolutely loved the hand cut fries that came with it! I gotcha the Village Pasta based on a review that said it was great if you're craving comfort food and indeed it was. The white wine rose water sangria is soooo good as well. It was a pleasant evening and even though it was a bit expensive, we'd be willing to go back and support this lovely restaurant. :)"], ["Katy P.", "Mandolin is truly a hidden gem in the middle of Midtown. When you walk through the blue double doors you find yourself in an enchanted outside patio with wood tables and chairs that are covered with blue accents. The restaurants owners have made sure to bring authentic food that can be found by the Aegean Sea, which has been called the \"peal of the Mediterranean.\"At Mandolin they are proud and very passionate about the food they grew up eating. They are dedicated to creating and serving the locals homemade specialties that are simple, yet authentic. When you go to Mandolin you have to eat the Turkish Sampler, which has a pretty healthy serving of homemade hummus, tomato walnut dip and fava bean pur\u00e9e. Make sure to not over due it with the hummus because then you have to try the Greek village salad with chicken. So light and refreshing.And, of course, you have to eat their baklava. All I'm going to say is you might want to order seconds.And make sure to pair all of this delicious food with their very own Aegean Sangria, which is absolutely perfect for these hot summer Miami nights. Their sangria is made with white wine and rose water.Mandolin is truly a place to not only feed your stomach, but also your soul."], ["Christina K.", "Wow, best stuffed zucchini with FRESH tomato sauce. Juicy kofta that melts in your mouth. A MUST SEE while in Miami"], ["Cullen A.", "Great Mediterranean food. Chicken kebab and butterflied tiger prawns are really delicious and juicy. Definitely a good find if you're in the design district"], ["Vanessa B.", "This place is easily my favorite restaurant in Miami, whether for lunch or dinner!! It really is a cute, small getaway that transports you to Greece. The decor is all white and blue and it is mostly outdoor seating, although there is an inside as well!

I come very often and will continue to do so as I am never disappointed by it. :) 5 stars!!"], ["Francesca S.", "Food is ok , but the scenery really make it up . you feel like you are in a greek little garden.Perfect for \u00a0a first date or \u00a0a get together in family"], ["SO S.", "I love this place, been there so many times and never got disappointed. I usually share 3 to 4 appetizers cause they are so delicious. Grilled octopus, garlic shrimps, Kefta... Good wine selection. Turkish coffee. Not many places with such unique ambiance and authentic food. Keep doing what you re doing!"], ["jackie a.", "Great food, atmospheric and staffs extremely friendly. I would recommend this place for food and ambiance."], ["Julio L.", "Positives: The food was amazing! We had the grilled octopus, lamb, and tiger prawns. We could have done a second grilled octopus instead of the tiger prawns as they were our least favorite dish. The cab wine by the glass was enjoyable and the baklava for dessert was good as well. Not the best I have tasted in the past but good. While we where inly a party of to there where large groups there and it seemed like this was a great place for large parties. Negatives: Because we did not have reservations we could not sit outside which is what would have made my review 5 stars. Typically I would not hold this against the restaurant as it was our fault however when we where seated there where about 40 outdoor seats available and when we left there was about 20 seats available outdoors. Not sure how they could not arrange to sit 2 outdoors."], ["Eric J.", "My first visit was lunch and I had the Gyro. Don't order the gyro get something else, this isn't the place to try a gyro. The fries are good, eat the fries. The Gyro was made thinly sliced strips of meat that you can buy in a grocery store, thus the meh."], ["Heberto V.", "The place is very charming. Nicely decorated. Definitely a place for a date.Since we were a large group we tried several things on the menu. The two outstanding dishes were the fried calamari and the grilled octopus. They were truly excellent. The rest of the food was mediocre. Not worth the price. The pasta was burnt at the bottom of the casserole, the lamb chops over cooked, the lamb burgers were bland and so on. I believe that if you go for a glass of wine and a couple appetizers it is worth it; otherwise I'd go someplace else. For the money Miami has many more great options to choose from."], ["A P.", "Been twice.Second time at 12:30 noon on a Friday they had already run out of spinach pie and greek balls (what!).Octopus ok. Shrimp saganaki is best.Lamb sandwich was dry in a huge bun.Service inconsistent when they are busy.Not excited to go back!"], ["Michelle L.", "The ambiance at Mandolin is five stars. Upon entering, you quickly get transcended into old world Mediterranean charm. My date and I felt as if we were dining in a little remote location in Greece. I recommend a cool night so you can sit outdoors in their garden area and calling ahead for reservations. The inside is small but really warm and quaint, adorned with flowers and traditional Mediterranean d\u00e9cor. The food: We began with the Turkish platter of three different kinds of hummus and spreads with a glass of their malbec. Followed by the grilled octopus that was tasty and the lamb chops served over pine nut rice. The lamb chops were my fave. And to close, baklava of course. The meal was delicious. To be honest, the foodie in me wants to critique and say that it wasn't the best Ive had but it definitely was very well prepared. The service was top notch too. We had a lovely time and it wasn't very loud. I didn't have to yell across the table. I recommend valet at the door."], ["John M.", "This is one place you leave feeling you were taken advantage of, when you consider what you paid for. A grilled octopus appetizer will typically run about $18 a plate, but most of the time two or three people can eat from it, as an appetizer. I paid $18 for pretty much one tentacle? NO drinks just water, one dessert shared three ways, and three Turkish Coffees; the bill was well over $100!It's a shame. The food was really good. I've been to Greece. The place feels Greek, the staff was very attentive, but the food wasn't pricey, it was down right unarmed robbery.I doubt I'd go back. Maybe if I was a date for someone else picking up the bill!!! Like in some of the reviews written on this place. LOL! I'm turned off by the prices. That's what sticks in my mind."], ["Anna L.", "YES YES YES YES....First of all this place is adorable..we sat outside. Food was awesome. Mediterranean food is always vegan-friendly, but of course there was lots of meat for dad. Great place for sharing also. Loved it!"], ["Marina A.", "Great outside sitting, like in someone's backyard with huge umbrellas protecting from the sun and the rain. Simple,Fresh and Delicious food. Great service. Octopus is excellent, Turkish trio is good to try as well. Stuffed zucchini very different and amazingly good with great sauce. Will be back :)"], ["Daniel C.", "Mandolin has a lot going for it. Awesome midtown location, amazing open air space. And to my surprise, they have really stylish canopy style covers for when it's rainy. We had a reservation for a party of 5 and 9:30pm, and we walked up to the host stand and were seated immediately. That's a great start, in my opinion. All the food was great for the evening. We started with grilled octopus and beef and lamb koftas. They were both excellent - to octopus really stood out and was cooked to perfection. For entrees, we had the fish special (a fish I've never heard of before that is sea-bass-esque) and the gyro. They were both really nice - the fish was simple, flavorful, boneless, and delicious. The gyro was standard. For dessert we had the baklava and the chocolate mousse. Both were fantastic, although in general I find baklava too sweet to have more than a bite. Our service was excellent and overall, it was a great experience. We hope to go back soon."], ["Lee H.", "The two of us arrived at 12:00 PM for Lunch and it was the perfect time since they get crowded fast. We decided to sit in the open courtyard dining area despite the rain that started developing. There were large over hang canopies that kept us dry even though it was pouring. We started with the daily special salad of watermelon, tomato, basil and feta cheese. They were accommodating and added the arugula to the salad that I requested. In addition we ordered the grilled octopus. Both were absolutely delicious. The octopus was cooked to perfection. The thunder roared, rain pouring over in buckets and the ground was flooding as we attempted to keep our feet dry. After our appetizers we shared butterfly trout with veggies and the most amazing Moussaka that I ever had. Despite the floods the waiter staff were very attentive and friendly. We finished with a Turkish coffee. I suggested to the manager to have the owners add a floor water drainage system so that the staff and patrons could easily move around during torrential \u00a0rains. Overall it was one of the best lunch experiences with great quality food, attentive staff and a quaint atmosphere. The best dining experience in Miami."], ["Valerie A.", "Delicious sample platters, both the Greek and the Turkish are great. The gyros are pretty good (order French fries on the side, yumm). The service was very slow and waiters seemed not have interest in making our visit special at all."], ["Hal M.", "From the moment we walked into the outdoor covered courtyard, we knew that we had made the right choice. The ambiance, the colors, the lights, the smell...all of it was a sensory delight. We started with the Stuffed Zucchini for an appetizer which was accompanied with some tasty bread. My wife got the Chicken Kebab which came with a very tasty romaine and feta salad and orzo. I got the Classic Gyros with the same salad and a side of their handcut fries covered in tatziki sauce. Everything was outstanding and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal."], ["Joe Y.", "Mandolin has been one of my go-to mediterranean restaurants since its opening. It's a great place to have lunch with friends any day of the week, food is tasty and reasonably priced. As others have mentioned you can't go wrong with the lamb burger, it's delicious. Other recommendations should include the Gyro, the Hummus sampler, white sangria and any salad."], ["Lien T.", "Shared lots of meze between the 4 of us, plus the barley salad, moussaka, sangria, and baklava. All the food was delicious especially the stuffed zucchini. This dish can be shared, but it was small enough / good enough to order a 2nd dish.The barley salad was not as fruity and light as I expected but good nonetheless. We also enjoyed the lamb dumplings (unique, bite-sized, a special of the day) and the cheese saganaki (delicious especially topped with lemon juice). The sangria was light and refreshing if not also light in alcohol content (which was fine by me).The outdoor atmosphere was really pleasant and cozy. Our waitress wasn't the most attentive, thus the 4 star review. The baklava was also decent though denser than most baklava I've had and not worth the $11 price tag. I prefer Baklava Factory's. Overall, I look forward to returning and trying more dishes and enjoying patio dining."], ["Marcus Z.", "I got here on a busy Friday evening, I didn't get a reservation but lucky enough to get a seat in the outside siting area. The decoration, atmosphere is great outside, although frequently we were interrupted by the noise of plane flying over. By the time I left, there was already a line at the front door. So definitely try to make a reservation before you come. I ordered the famous octopus as the appetizer, lamb chop and lamb sandwich as the entree and house baklava as the desert.... And the food is barely a 60/100. The octopus is a bit over cooked and kind of chewy and lost the freshness of what a good seafood dish should be. It is fun to see though. The lamb chop is mehER than the octopus, it is so boring and unmemorable and not even as good as what you sometimes can get from a lamb over rice food truck. The lamb sandwich is above the average, but again, boring and forgettable. The baklava, don't even want to mention, I can only say, I haven't had worse. Overall, the food here is alright, I won't be back for the food, but the outside sitting area is definitely nice, which is probably why the restaurant is packed with people. Overall score: 70/100."], ["Maya P.", "I used to love this place, it is very romantic at night time but the other day I went and got the grilled octopus (got only one tentacle but still got charged $18) a delicious cucumber soup, 3 prawns and a starter plate with 3 dips and bread, drank water and paid $78 + tip , ended up paying like $92 and hungry. Last time I go there... I went there two other times for my anniversary, but really, you don't get what you pay for."], ["Jorge L.", "Came for dinner with my wife and one of her friends. This place has been on my try list for several months. The decor and atmosphere is wonderful and feels very greek all your missing is an ocean breeze. We ordered several appetizers; they were all great (saganaki, turkish app, octopus). Best food overall was the octopus. We then ordered some calamari which tasted like nothing. Our friend ordered the burger which she said was ok. I ordered the pulled lamb sandwich which was ok, you couldn't taste the lamb and it had a bit of a sloppy joe taste.

She also had to fight to substitute Brussel sprouts for potatoes. \u00a0My $18 Fish Tagine arrived in 3-inch diameter baking dish set on a large plate. \u00a0It should be called \"Potato Tagine\" as the mahi-mahi promised by the menu is barely enough to feed a Siamese cat. It was accompanied by a little bowl of extremely boring couscous that tasted like it came out of a box. Overall, not very satisfactory.Mina, \u00a0the owner, was there, but \u00a0she didn't bother to stop at the table to greet the patrons, something a new restaurant owner should do to get the scope on what people think.Everything tasted like home cooked by a very uninspired cook and the portion size is ridiculous, even for me and I'm not a big eater. \u00a0 The place is nice and very tastefully decorated, but they need to seriously work on the food. \u00a0The owner said that she keeps the prices low because she doesn't need a chef. \u00a0The prices are not that low if you consider that what you actually eat is the size of a Gerber baby food jar. \u00a0There's nothing worse than going out to eat and feast on chips back home.The lack of a chef shows. Sorely."], ["Carolina M.", "Yea, well... it was ok but i was not blown away. I mean, nothing that impressed me so much that i am dying to go back and eat there again.

I guess i am jaded.We were 3 people and we order wine to start. They do have a nice selection of international wines.We order for appetizer the pita ( waas just ok).

I had the Coq Au Vin and it was good but definitely very different from the authentic French Coq Au Vin.I find that the menu tries too hard to be international and with so many dishes from so many different cuisines i guess it gets lost.Overall and ok meal but like i said nothing too memorable.

The menu was very limited in my opinion, but for what was available to choose from, the food was all delicious. I got the salmon tartare and oysters. All of my friends seemed to enjoy their food as well. So here comes the bad...The servers were not very clear about how much food you would get for the pound, because the seafood is all based on market prices. They were very pushy in upselling you. For example, when I went to order my oysters, which were listed at $4 each, I wanted to order three for myself because nobody else at the table wanted oysters. This is the conversation between myself and the server: I'll have the salmon tartare and three oysters pleaseOysters are generally served in half a dozen or a dozenBut I just want three. It says on the menu that they are $4 eachOk I'll talk to the chef and see if it's ok*insert unimpressed eye roll*Are you kidding me? It's not as though it's difficult to separate oysters...they come individually. If it was a matter of dividing a fish for example, I would understand. But he made it seem as though it would be a problem that I wanted only three oysters. In another example, my friend pointed to a particular red wine on the menu when she ordered. And when she got the bill, that one glass of wine was $25, and was not the one that she had pointed to. The server should have clarified with her in regards to what wine she actually wanted. Basically if you're going to come here, be prepared to spend a lot of money and to not be really sure about what you're going to get for your money."], ["Anhara M.", "We went yesterday recommended by a friend that went to the one NY.

I went on Friday night August 7th with my husband, his brother and my sister in law. Where shall I begin? We are seated promptly and asked if we would like to see the fresh fish choices, our head waiter took us back where there is a lovely display of whole fish, lobsters, shrimp and more. They seemed to be pushing the New Zealand red snapper even though they had beautiful local red snapper and some fancy giant red prawns. They explained in great detail about each fish including where it came from, the flavor and consistency and the portion size.We were re seated and they brought Greek olive oil and the server cut in fresh oregano which looked and tasted lovely, this shred the table with warm crusty bread that I believe was the highlight of the entire meal. I wanted the local red snapper but was told the snapper was too big for one person, my brother in law and sister in law ordered Bronzino and the Greek salad to start. My husband was on the fence also wanting red snapper, again they said it was too big for two and perhaps try the fish from New Zealand. This seemed crazy to me and they suggested we all have Bronzino. I ordered the large Greek salad as my entree and the rest shared a Bronzino which cost $150 for the three portions with no sides. The fish was moist but flavorless and my sister in law kept drizzling it with olive oil. My salad was unremarkable at $30 . I expected a memorable Greek salad at such a highly rated Greek restaurant but it was easy to forget. I give the restaurant two stars because the servers (under our head waiter) were so nice, the place was spotless and the bread / olive oil was outstanding. The food left me wanting something more. My suggestion is go for a drink at the bar and order an appetizer and a bread basket.Please do not think my complaint is purely on the price because the night before we ate at an outstanding Sushi restaurant where the bill was way over $500 for the four of us but the food and service were spectacular and all four of us said what a delicious and memorable meal it was.I resent the fact that they show you all the different choices but then tell you for one person you can't really have anything but a whole fish which serves two three or more, what if everyone wants something different, what if I prefer local fish not fish flown from around the world?

The presentation was almost as stunning as the fish. My octopus was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. The Main course was Colorado rack of lamb that was gamey and delicious. My husbands lavraki was flaky and full of delicious fresh flavor. We both devoured our plates, which were generous portions. Milo's was an amazing deal for Miami Spice \u00a0especially given the high price of this restaurant. We were wowed and will definitely return to try the regular menu!"], ["Eve C.", "The only thing that keeps Milos from earning that coveted fifth star is its prices. \u00a0The food is amazing, the service is stellar, and the space is open and airy - there are so many pluses that it's easy enough to overlook the prices. \u00a0But for many of us - locals and tourists alike - an $80 per person meal is just not feasible much of the time.A friend and I strolled up to Milos on a rainy weekend night with the intention of grabbing a couple of seats at the bar for dinner. \u00a0The place was packed! \u00a0Every seat at the bar was taken, as were most of the tables in the spacious dining room. \u00a0But within a few minutes, we were able to snag those coveted bar seats, and our dining adventure began.My friend was a seasoned Milos veteran, and knew exactly what to order - the charred octopus and the \"Milos Special\" as starters. \u00a0The charred octupus was outstanding - the perfect texture (meaning not too chewy), with just a touch of herbs and olive oil on the plate. \u00a0The \"Milos Special\" - a tower of super-thin crispy zucchini slices and fried kefalograviera cheese, with a hidden pool of super-creamy tzaziki sauce underneath was divine. \u00a0Despite the fried nature of the dish, neither the zucchini nor the cheese were greasy. \u00a0These starters are perfect for sharing, and could potentially be a meal in themselves.For our main course, we decided to split the halibut filet, which was grilled, and presented in a light bath of olive oil, along with some fresh steamed broccoli. \u00a0Our server/bartender had warned us that there'd be some bones in the filet, but there weren't too many of the sneaky suckers, just a big t-bone like thing in the middle - which made it very easy to avoid. \u00a0The fish was cooked perfectly and was delicious.I'd love to return and splurge on one of their whole fish or salt-encrusted options, with some of their fresh-from-Greece selection, but if you think the other menu options are pricey, these take it to a whole other level!Overall, the meal was great. \u00a0The charred octopus was definitely the stand-out, and will become a must-order on all future visits. \u00a0But the hard truth about the prices - with a drink a person, sharing appetizers and even entrees, expect to spend roughly $80 a person, including tax and tip. \u00a0However, you could very easily spend $120-$150 a person with more drinks, the pricier fish options, a side dish or two, etc.We had an amazing meal at Milos, but I'll probably reserve it for special occasions (or the occasional splurge) only. \u00a0If Milos dropped their prices just a bit (to make it say, $50-60/person with a drink, tax and tip), I'd be there quite frequently. \u00a0But that doesn't appear to be happening any time soon."], ["Beini X.", "First time I went there was with a business meeting.

Also the other meat on display was their gyro that had been previously shaved off and put behind the counter. It looked all dried up and old. \u00a0I love middle eastern food and have tried plenty other places and know what's good tasting and fresh.

Specifically there is a fat girl who has worked there for years, who is very rude and bitter all the time. Every time I go I dread having her take my order as I know it will be an unpleasant ordeal. I used to tolerate it because the food was so good but over the last year the food has gotten worse and worse. They no longer offer Shawarma and they no longer make the sandwiches with pitas instead they use a sort of flat bread. They put Tzatziki sauce and if you ask for tahini you get an attitude and more bad service. If you ask for olive oil for your hummus you get attitude. Never mind that it should come with olive oil by default. If you ask for a side of tahini for your kibbe again you get dirty looks and attitude. I have been a customer for over 10 years but honestly I no longer go. It is a shame because the Daily Bread was my favorite middle eastern market."], ["Elle M.", "I used to love this place - until I discovered Mediterranean markets just like it that will cook your food when you order it. At the daily bread, falafel is made ahead of time and microwaved when you order it. They do have good Spanekopita, but it is best to get there when it comes out of the oven at around 11 am cause those too will be microwaved. The final straw came when my bf and I split a sandwich and both became violently ill within an hour of consumption.

Let's just say I will be having a little cylindrical piece of heaven with a shell-like drizzle of chocolate on top from now on. I also recently tried moussaka.

After asking if our food was ready, we were told it would be another 15-20 minutes. Mind you, we only have 30 minutes for lunch break so this was a real incovenience. There was other people there also waiting for their order and stayed longer than we did, since we left before them. The worst part is they didn't even apologize, they just said they're busy. We finally received our order at 1:55pm and complained about the ridiculous wait. Even suggested for them to give customer a more accurate time frame to pick up or at least a courtesy call. The guy completely ignored us and said yea but were busy. This was completely unaccceptable and i refuse to ever go back no matter how good the food is.You thought i was done??? NO!

It tastes like a lamb I guess but, with those Greek Seasonings it's cooked in, you will never know you're eating one of Bambi's closest next of kin. DELICIOUS! I will be back.Things to note and blah, blah, blahs:* Parking - OH MY GOD! YOU CAN'T FIND CURBSIDE PARKING? Relax. Directly behind this restaurant there is a free parking lot. * Ready to pay your bill? I saw it happen again today. When you're done eating, you grab your bill and walk to the register to pay.

After 1 hour of waiting I receive a call informing me that the delivery person had an accident and I had to go pick up my food.. Alright, I don't live far and thought it wasn't a big deal.

How can a restaurant be so busy that it needs extra 30 minutes to process a very simple order when nobody is eating there? The waitress who gave me the food was extremely nice, which I appreciated. I asked her if I could be refunded of the $5 delivery fee and delivery tip and she said no problem and also asked me if i spoke Spanish and wanted to speak with the manager..I do not speak Spanish and because of that the manager refused to deal with me.... The fact that my order had been delayed \"because the restaurant was very busy\"when in reality it was completely empty and that the manager didn't want to speak with me because i didn't speak Spanish threw me off but the real surprise came when I opened the boxes where my dinner was supposed to be. I use the past tense because I quite frankly didn't receive what I ordered: the salad was composed by a sliced tomato, capers, 1 olive and a piece of feta that hadn't even been sliced. The portion was so small that it fit perfectly in the corner of the box.The spinach triangles were fine but were cold and mushy. The fries were a huge disappointment: the portion was so little that it wasn't enough not even for one person, there was more potato skin that potatoes and everything was extra mushy and cold.

Note: the restaurant does not have a liquor license yet so all alcoholic beverages are wine based. The table decided to eat family style and I basically tried everything from the menu. The dishes that stood out to me were the manouri cheese envelope, saganaki, and especially the zucchini fries. The zucchini fries need their own special shout out because they were the best thing I tried. We had to order them several times because everyone kept devouring them.At the end of the night I was insanely full off of the good times and food. I would recommend Kouzina to anyone who would like to have a wonderful Greek meal with great service."], ["Hamlet G.", "I have been many times at Kouzina and I can recommend you this place because the quality and variety of Greek food.

You will leave with a headache! The service is SO bad that any possible good food gets killed!

We both ordered the lamb gyro platter, one order of eggplant appetizer and one order of baklava. We drank tap water. The lamb gyro platter was good - but not amazing. The French fries were good. The pita bread left something to be desired. I didn't like the eggplant appetizer at all. My mom makes a killer version at home and this one had no flavor. Baklava was fantastic. We didn't try anything else - maybe other items on the menu are better. If the price was lower I would give this place 3 1/2- maybe 4 stars if the price was right.

Two thumbs up. He quickly informed me that delivery was taking up to an hour at the time, prior to placing my order. \u00a0Thank you. The hummus was \"scoop out that last bit\" good. No, it was amazing.

My boyfriend and I are into for the weekend and not really interested in the whole south beach scene. We wanted to try something the locals would dine at. First, we talked with the concierge at our hotel who threw us so many ideas.. but still I didn't know exactly what I was craving! Gyro! I want some tasty gyro meat. We started looking on yelp what the area had to offer. Then we drove by Maria's. It looks welcoming and they sat us right away. It was about 20 min before closing. Right away the server was friendly and very helpful even offering the lunch menu. We ordered the fried cheese. It was good but I'd probably not have it again. My boyfriend loved it though. Then we ordered the gyro platter! Oh my! This was awesome! 3 large pieces of meat and french fries and a Greek salad. I turned mine into a giant gyro sandwich. I was a little messy but the taste made it so worth it. It was so filling. I just had to tell everyone how awesome it was. I wish we lived in miami. This would become a regular spot for us.

Warm pita was also brought to the table with our food. The food was good - the phyllo on the spanikopita was a little dry, but the filling was perfectly seasoned. The grape leaves were very good as well, with a creamy lemon sauce on the top. The service was really great; the restaurant was fairly empty and they didn't rush us \u00a0at all, but brought the check promptly when we were ready for it, along with a little sweet Greek cookie.

The girl told us \"no, we need those tables available for larger parties\" and I let her know that with 1 1/2 hours left until closing that would be highly unlikely as there were 4 empty larger tables available and the restaurant was empty. She still said no -- I am not in the mood to have to request a manager in scenarios like these because I would assume the manager should coach them on being able to make educated decisions on their own.

They had about 8 empty tables when we got there, but the manager refused to seat us for 10 minutes because they were somewhat busy. \u00a0We looked at the menu while we waited, so we were ready as soon as we were seated. However it took another ten minutes before the server got around to taking our order. I ordered the gyro platter with the greek salad and fries. My co-worker ordered the gyro platter with double greek salad. Finally 25 minutes later we got our food after I got back from feeding more change into the parking meter, as I had put 50 minutes on it and knew there was no way on Earth we would get out in the next 5 minutes. Now keep in mind that gyro meat is already cooked on a spit, so what took 25 minutes for two gyro platters.So the food finally comes and they brought us both gyro platters with double salad. He rushes off before I can say anything. A few minutes later I manage to catch him and tell him of the mistake. He acts very annoyed by my inconveniencing him. About 5 minutes later the manager plops down the plate of fries and walks away without any apology. No ketchup or any trace of a server to get some. If the service wasn't enough to keep me from coming back the food sure was. The gyro meat was average, but the greek salad was wretched. The lettuce edges had the orangish/brownish color of lettuce going bad and the feta was flat out disgusting. I love feta cheese and eat it regularly, so I know what reta tastes like. I don't know if it was rancid or what.Rude/slow service + bad food = never coming back."], ["Lissa B.", "The first time I ate Maria's I could almost hear the angelic choirs praising \"Aaaveeee Mariiiiaaaaa\".

I was brought Maria's to-go one evening by my roomie, who happened to stumble upon it by foot on a stroll down Coral Way. I remember it clearly. It was a big lamb gyro, abundant with greens, boasting thick juicy strips of seasoned lamb, and glistening with delicious tzatziki sauce, all wrapped up in pita. As soon as my nose sniffed it, my palate skipped grace, and before I knew it, I was devouring this lamb gyro with all the gratitude I could muster. I've never been the same since, no other Greek restaurant satiates my craving the way Maria's does. I've tried Mykonos, Mylos, Maroosh, Opa but they pale in one way or the other. Maria's tastes of a mother's love. I suspect they are a family business. It is now my go-to Greek Food to-go. I hope to make it in to the actual restaurant one day.

It turns out that the chicken breast was served on the kabob. I found the chicken itself to be quite plain and underwhelming. Not much flavor here. Plus there was a bite with a gross fatty texture. The pita was good and the accompanying side salad was above average. The tzatziki sauce, however, was exceptional. I am not normally a tzatziki lover, but though this was great. It had a noticeably thicker texture than other tzatziki sauce I have had. I had a bite of the lentil salad my dining companion had and thought it was very tasty. For an appetizer, we ordered the feta crust. Or tried to, anyway. It turns out that the person at the counter misheard what I said and put the order in as feta fries.

The pita they use is straight from Publix and not at all decent.The staff was doing the bare minimum, but seemed unhappy and not really interested in doing their job, they were more interested in speaking with the other lebanese patrons.

It comes with chicken gyro and a side. Pita bread always tastes fresh to me and chicken is always tender and flavorful.
