{"Rincon Escondido Tapas": [], "La Gamba Restaurant": [["Stephen W.", "Wow, what a find find! We were so fortunate to find this place thanks to Yelp reviews. Coconut Grove a really great area for restaurants. This restaurant has already won many awards in Miami and it is easy to see why. It is not cheap, but the food and service are definitely worth it. They start you with free bread that is warm and incredibly soft with great flavor. Maybe sour bread? They also give you some olive oil and some spicy olives. Next we ordered some razor clams which the server told us are not always available ($24). Really tasty. Next, we absolutely LOVED the artichoke hearts ($16). They were soft and flavorful beyond belief. Just stupendous. I could make a dinner of them. For the main course we had lobster paella which was not a real paella as the server explained because it came in a broth whereas a paella is drier. But I don't remember what it is called. Just look for the lobster dish that is $35 per person. You won't regret it. It's a huge bowl with wonderfully delicious broth and all sorts of seafood: shrimp, clams, mussels, calmari, and lobster. The calmari was the most tender I have had in my life. This dish was nothing short of spectacular. Our server was so helpful and caring, could not ask for more. We really could not ask for a more perfect meal. The dinner was not cheap by any means, but it is one of the most memorable meals I have had in my life and worth every penny."], ["Elena I.", "Came here with my fellow Yelpers on Sunday for a lovely lunch and I was NOT disappointed! I had their red sangria which was very good. It was not sweet (which I like) but I do wish it would have had more of a kick to it. Regardless, on a hot summer day it really hits the spot which is why I ordered another one! I had their tortilla espa\u00f1ola which was divine. it was very large and reasonably priced ($10). Other dishes that were ordered were the ham and cod croquettes, 7 seas paella, seafood with angel hair pasta, and tomato bread. They were all awesome. Super fresh, well prepared, and beautifully presented. For dessert we had the manchego tart with raspberry sauce and it was divine! Decadent and delicious - I highly recommend it. The owner makes it herself so you know it is very good. All their seafood is imported from Spain and it shows. They take great pride in the preparation and presentation of their dishes. The service was excellent and they had no problem giving us separate checks. This is a very small venue so I suggest making a reservation if you are going at night. \u00a0They have a small outdoor seating area with live music on Sundays. \u00a0A really great touch! Plentiful parking in lots, garages, and on the street as this is in the Grove. I will be back for sure."], ["Ian T.", "This is a 4.5 star review if it was possible to do partial star reviews on Yelp! Bottom line is that the food is great, the portion are generous, the seafood is fresh, the service is above and beyond. The reason it isn't a five is simple: price. It's a bit expensive relative to what you get.A group of friends had decided to come here, and what immediately popped out on the menu were the various paellas. The menu is somewhat limited but that's not a downside in my mind as experience has shown that it's better to specialize and focus on a few dishes and do them well than have tons of items.Service got off to a bit of a rough start, as both the server and I were frustrated in trying to understand and communicate the paella pricing. Afterward, once that was sorted, the service went to the outstanding range so this is able to be overlooked. However, I will say that the source of the issue is that the menu could be clearer. Essentially the various paella varieties required a minimum of two people to order and the price shows the cost for one person. However this wasn't noted. To make matters a bit more confusing, the two most pricey paellas were able to be ordered for one person only and/or split between two people. These exceptions likewise weren't clearly explained or noted. None of this ultimately was a huge issue (and again was more than compensated for by their outstanding service later), but I would suggest that La Gamba would be better off having this more clearly outlined on their menus.My wife and I, and two of our friends, decided to shoot the moon and order the Paella Siete Mare (Seven Seas Paella). It's their standard seafood paella with the addition of maine lobster claws as well as large scarlet prawns -- a variety that tastes a bit like lobster and is rich red even raw. It's served in a risotto-like rice cooked in broth. The presentation was amazing. It looked fantastic. They even displayed it to us before beginning to serve it (and let me take photos). The server then divided it up for everyone on individual plates.Another example of how accommodating they were is that they brought out the scarlet prawn on a plate to show us what we were getting -- and even brought another out later to let me take a photo when I'd forgotten to take the first picture earlier!All the seafood was super fresh -- including not only the shellfish but the clams. We also had croquettas of various types: ham, bacalao and shrimp. They were also very tasty and well executed versions. As a bonus, the owner of the restaurant, a nice lady, decided to eat next to our table (which is always a good sign), and was more than happy to talk with our companion about her approach to the food.The main downside is that the price of the high-end Paellas are somewhat high, even counting the scarlet prawns (which we've had before for less of a premium). This was $75 for the dish, although the fact we could split a single generously portioned serving helped. For their more standard paellas, it's still about $40 (aka $20/person). This isn't inexpensive, but less dear than the high-end. I will say however that it's exceptional paella and for anyone looking for quality renditions of these delicacies, this is a very good choice."], ["Caroline B.", "Super cute Spanish tapas restaurant! The food is delicious, the wine cellar superb & the staff is great - plus, the owner is the nicest! Perfect place for a quiet, wine-infused night with friends!"], ["Stephen M.", "Had an excellent dinner dining under the stars at this unpretentious but fun place last Friday night. While my son and I were treated to the music of SonCubano (and the dancing of passersby and diners), we were treated to Latin/Spanish tapas, sopa, and entr\u00e9es. Though all the dishes were good, the only one I remember by name was LA Gamba alla planche (sp?), which had tasty prawns."], ["Rocio P.", "La Gamba's food is mostly good, but the service we had knocked down the 4th star for me. While my party and I enjoyed most of our food (I was lucky to have picked choices everybody loved, such as the branzino for entree and the poached pear with blue cheese ice cream for dessert), some other choices like the lomillo and the oaxtail received a \"good\" but not a \"wow\" remark. The appetizer was a crowd pleaser though. Everybody loved those croquetas: perfectly warm and flavorful; crispy on the outside and creamy inside; dipped in squid ink sauce, mmm...Our wine choice was a hit and miss among my group, but then again, wine to me is more of a personal taste affair, so unless a wine is beyond bad, opinions are meant to be varied. Now, while our server had a good demeanor by most service standards, the service was terribly slow. We were in conversation mode for the most part, so we didn't really drill the guy too much over this inconvenience; however, the folks at the two tables next to us were neither that talkative nor that carefree that night to forgive the poor guy. And I say \"poor\" because it looks like it was just him and another seemingly new guy handling the whole restaurant, which although small, was still packed to the last corner. On the plus side they had my favorite Miami flamenco guys (same ones that perform at La Taberna Giralda) playing outside. Judging by most reviews, seems like with better service this is actually not a bad choice for a dinner night at the Grove..."], ["Vivian R.", "Great little gem in the heart of the Grove!! Indoor/outdoor seating with live Cuban band playing outside! The croquettes and the bread with tomatoes were amazing! I had the fish with shrimp and clams in white wine sauce and it was perfect! Then to top it off had the Manchego tart with raspberry! I have never had it together like that and let me tell you, it reminded me of being back in Spain! \u00a0 Parking is easy as well! Jeff takes care of your car while parked and no need to find parking on the street! Definitely will be back at least once a month for my Tapas and Spanish dishes! Loved it! The only reason didn't get the 5th star is they really need to work a little harder for their American customers! I am Cuban, but my gringo hubby had a hard time communicating! But, that can be remedied!"], ["Shahab K.", "SOOO BADDD!!!! Where do I begin. I went to the place in Saturday, October, 17, 2015 at 9:00 PM. There was an apparent \"manager\" who claimed to be the \"owner.\" He was white skinned and about 6'0\".First of all, he should be fired. My girlfriend walked to he bathroom and actually entered he bathroom and he knocked on the door and said \"if you're not a customer you need to leave.\" Like in all honesty, who do you think you are? You don't gel someone that. My girlfriend as a customer. That's how you run people out. My girlfriend comes to me crying and I get super mad. I confront the guy. Remember, this is a white skinned 6'0\" dude who says he's the \"owner.\" He basically gets too emotional because he knows he fucked up and says I need to leave. So he basically kicks me out for nothing. I asked him why and he has no reason.By the way, this \"owner\" is still obsessed with us and wants to call he cops. We even ordered food! So basically we're leaving and our food comes and I get the food and throw it on the floor towards him and he calls he cops.Shameful.I feel bad for him.No hospitality at all.The restaurant may do good for the next year or so, but I don't see it last any further than that with the \"owner\" they have."], ["Daniel A.", "Sat outside and enjoyed some live music durig dinner. We went with a big group and ordered alot of the tapas. Everything was decent but a bit pricy. I must say the croquetes were out of this world! I ate like 6 of them...we needed to order more. Service was good and food kept on coming considering we had a big group of 8."], ["Carlos N.", "Ever since my last review, I've been coming back to La Gamba to celebrate special occasions. It feels great to eat great food in a homey atmosphere. I went yesterday to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and it was a wonderful night. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was superb, as always. I had the Paella Siete Mares, which is to die for (please make sure you try it)."], ["Mari M.", "Excellent! We had the bread drizzled with ripe tomato and olive oil.....the warm goat geese salad, the fried eggs with fried whitefish and the tortilla con patatas, which is made to order. \u00a0Topped it off with a Flan de manchego which was more like a cheesecake. \u00a0Really good food!

Their menu is a bit limited, but they have most of the Spanish classics. The gazpacho was flavorful & refreshing. We ordered the arroz caldoso with lobster that was almost as good as what I used to eat when I lived in Barcelona. It ended up being an expensive lunch, but absolutely worth it!"], ["Titus V.", "Good size restaurant for personalized attention, good food, well presented and fair priced, we, a party of 4, had a good time and will call again.Titus"], ["Ana S.", "Food great, service sux, ambiance cute minus the AC not cooling the place - seriously? Miami and Summer hello heat and humidity."], ["Sally R.", "So we came to Coconut Grove on Friday memorial day weekend 2015 around 8pm.... Surprisingly, it was not that busy (as usually) and parking was very easy. \u00a0We usually go to the same places in the grove but decided to make plans for a movie and \u00a0thought that we could kill some time discovering other places \u00a0in the awesome coconut grove area. \u00a0After reading some reviews, we decide to stop by La Gamba. Spanish food is our favorite since we came back from our trip to Spain . Spain is absolutely beautiful and the people are even better. I guess that is why our expectations were high and maybe that is why we are so extremely disappointed with La Gamba, so, when we got there, we were honest with one of the waiters by telling him before he sat us that \u00a0we are thinking of going to the movies so we were probably going to get a few drinks.... he didn't know what to say so he went inside for a few minutes to get the \"manager or owner\" ( no idea who he was-- young gentleman) regardless, this is what happened...He told us that he will put two chairs on the sidewalk for us to have drinks because they have music tonight and they cant give us a table. \u00a0By the way, they were plenty of tables available at that time..... I did not think it was nice for us to be in this customers of this restaurant but \u00a0be seating in the middle of the sidewalk...like a street bar....so our first time in this place and we should have chairs int he middle of the sidewalk.... what kind of restaurant is this? we are better off going to Happy Wine, which also has music and they treat customers with more respect.'Anyway, at the end, I have to thank the \":manager/owner\" because after the weird experience with him, \u00a0we went to the place almost across the street called Le Bouchon (French place) and to my surprise they were super accommodating and gave us amazing service even though they were almost at full capacity. \u00a0Literally, one table will get up and other people will seat down. It was super busy but we had a \u00a0divine experience in this small but cozy place. \u00a0we even learn some French!!! Moreover, \u00a0we had such a good time that we decided to not go to the movies and actually have dinner. \u00a0We can't wait to tell our family and friends and already made plans to come again. By the way, we were not even hungry but we ate, service was that good, that we were convinced! Oh boy, good we did!Anyway, my point in this review for La Gamba is to be ready to tell them you are going to have a big check otherwise they wont give you a table but give you a chair in the middle of the sidewalk.. By the way, there is a wine bar down the street that probably would have treated us better.First impressions are the most important and ours with La Gamba \u00a0was terrible. \u00a0They seem to be so worried about having big bills that they forgot customer service 101. Needless to say that \u00a0when I told the \"manager/owner\" that i thought the chair on the sidewalk was not nice .. he said \"ok, good bye\" \u00a0and went right back inside. nice....We will not come again to this place but if you have better luck with them then good for you. \u00a0however, everything happens for a reason and now we have another favorite French place in Coconut Grove without music but excellent customer service. Buena suerte!"], ["Hortensia A.", "All I can say is that this 8 month old place has a ways to go before I return. The portions to price ratio is on the higher end and I left a little dissatisfied with service. I made reservations to eat here, and we were waiting for a good 3 minutes with no hostess. Finally an employee shows, and we are seated. As we seat, it takes less than 1 minute for her to ask us if we are ready to order. I ask her for some water and a minute to review menu. She returns with a bottle of water, instead of asking if we want bottled or tap ( which really gets under my skin ). I turn away to bottled water, ask for some tap water and a glass of wine. The selection of wines by the glass are limited, but I made due. She brings me a Rioja I requested, shows me the corked bottle, asks if it's ok, I nod, she pours the entire gala instead of allowing me to taste. It's not to sound like a snob of anything, but if by the glass, just either bring me the glass of wine, or allow me to taste. Don't give me mixed messages of high end service and then fall short. So literally one minute after the wine, she asked again if we want to order. I am already quite irritated because I've been here less than 5 minutes and she's asked twice! I explain I haven't gone through the entire menu to please give me a minute. She urges me to order because the kitchen is closing... I order 2 tapas and tell her to wait a moment for rest of order. Within the next minute another waiter asks but again to order because the kitchen closes at 11. So my boyfriend order 2 additional things and we give the menus back. My primary grievance here is : if you're going to allow 10:30 reservations, you can't rush your customers to choose their meals because you want to go home! Much less close the kitchen in 30 minutes when you should know that dining takes approx 1 hour from beginning to end. Ok, now that being said : the food. We order mixed croquettes that come with 2 types, shrimp and ham croquettes. They were mild in flavor but tasty. We also requested an assorted meat board that for 18 bucks was a complete rip off. I've seen more meat on a subway sandwich! Finally my boyfriend also ordered rack of lamb And a gazpacho. Gazpacho was flavorless and watery, lamb was tasty and juicy, but again a small portion for the money. In general, I won't be returning until they turn this place around. I was disappointed for the money spent, and the service rendered. A generous 3 stars."], ["Katie J.", "This review is way overdue. Went here with my friends and let me tell you this place is my new Miami favorite. I'm tired of places that are all about looks hype. La Gamba did not dissapointed. We had some of the best Paella I've had in the city, the fish was super fresh, the staff was very friendly (and good looking...) and the wine list although short was packed with great pick a very good prices for a Miami spot.

Got the croquettes and calamari. We got the black ink paella for five people.

Nevertheless, it was good."], ["Ricardo D.", "The food is very good and well priced. I've tried most of the plates and have been pleasantly surprised by most. The rice and fish plates are great.

Food was definitely not made with authentic recipes. They don't serve just a glass of sangria (pitchers only). My Spanish omelet was more like a baked potato with an egg mixed into it. If you didn't know what authentic Spanish food was like you may find it to be mediocre at best. Not only is the food not good service was worse.

Props for being open on Sunday since It's tough finding a place that's not closed on said day in the Gables!Even though the restaurant was somewhat empty, we definitely enjoyed our meal! The menu consists of Spanish cuisine classics. We ordered some octopus styled \"a la gallega\" and marinated white anchovies done the Spanish way known known as \"boquerones\". We figured that after we finished these \"tapas\" we'd order more. But, boy, we were stuffed after just having these two dishes. From a sizing perspective, \"tapas\" they were not! The servings were huge!!! I was expecting smaller plating, but when comparing the plating to the pricing, I found the pricing to be on par!! We washed these two dishes down with some nice, fruity sangria. The sangria was decent, but not anything to go crazy about.All in all a decent option to satisfy that Spanish craving, but my recommendation is to go with a bigger party to take advantage of the array of oversized \"tapas\". Ole!!!"], ["Michael S.", "This new tapas restaurant takes the place of an older tapas restaurant that was in this same spot for many years. It closed about 1-2 years ago. The new owners have completely redecorated the room. It is much lighter, brighter and cleaner than it was before. The menu has also moved upscale. The dishes that I had were neuveau interpretations of Tapas classics. When you sit down they bring you a small complementary plate of manzanilla olives, jamon serrano and a basket of nice crusty sliced baguette. I ordered the Ensalada Rusa and the Salpicon De Mariscos. Both were out of the ordinary. The Ensalada had large pieces of potatoes and carrots along with lots of tuna. While it was not the best version that I have had it was excellent. The Salpicon was composed of lots of freshly prepared seafood including clams and mussels still in their shells, tail-on shrimp and cooked white fish, probably merluza with crunchy vegetables swimming in an olive oil broth. It also was excellent. For desert I had the classic Torta de Santiago an almond tort. This version was more cake like than I prefer but because of that it was lighter than the classic version. The espresso was good. This restaurant is a substantially better but slightly pricier replacement for the previous tapas restaurant at this location."], ["Julio E.", "We ordered two tapas and I really couldn't tell you which one was worst.

From the market, I only grabbed some turron to bring home for the holidays but will definitely be back to stock up on more sweet treats, spreads, and Spanish ingredients when I'm back in town. Then my nose got the better of me. I could smell the tortillas sitting out and the bread toasting in the cafe. I couldn't resist a jamon y queso bocadillo. I didn't realize until after that you can get a variety of sizes, but I'm happy I got a big one. I definitely would have wanted more if I went for a downsize. They served it warm and with just one bite I was transported back to Europe where ham is actually ham and not that processed stuff from Oscar Meyer.

Then, I wash it all down with a yummy cidra (cider). My favorite thing to do is order a few tapas and share. If you want more, you order it, and they bring the cold tapas out fairly quickly. So pretty much you can eat as you go.They service is pretty chill. I like it like that. Its European. Thats they way they roll.

The manager is an amazing Spanish gentleman who, back when I was 10 or so would give me these tiny chocolate desserts covered in chocolate sprinkles. Really, the owners are just super nice and always treat the guests like...well, guest, honored guests.I love this place because it reminds me a little of Spain and since my roots extend all the way back to las Islas Canarias, the Basque country, and even Barcelona I find myself feeling at home surrounded by all things Spanish. (Then again I love all things Japanese but I'm not Japanese, not even close...eh, go figure). Anyways, the food is authentic Spanish cuisine, all of it. I csn't even begin to go through the menu since between my family and I we have probably eaten everything on the menu at least four or five times over since they first opened up. So let me just sum up my favorite foods: the tortilla espa\u00f1ola is amazing, yummy and with a flavor that is not too in your face; the bocadillos filled with chorizo (my favorite Spanish tapa, only second to jamon de Jabugo which they have actually had from time to time) and queso manchego are just such a great lunch treat; and finally the tarta de Santiago which is w classic Spanish dessert made with almonds, it's always perfectly sweet and just chewy enough.I know I've been using a lot of Spanish terms (sorry to the non Spanish speakers) but there really isn't any translation for the names of the foods. As such, I hope you don't get offend it.My advice is to go and try this little slice of Spain. Last time my family spoke to the owner he chuckled when we asked about his creeping domination of the whole block. Mind you he used to just have s tiny whole in the wall! Pretty amazing.

The tortilla espanola and the chorizo were pretty good - Some basic Tapas to round up the experience, such as fried sardines or pulpo al ajillo (Octopus in garlic) will always suit my fancy. I must confess that this place will yield 3 or four different experiences, depending on how full or busy it is. We've been on a quiet weekend night and it is a very enjoyable evening definitely worth taking the time to enjoy the food and the company. If it is busier, however, it slides down the scale quite a few notches. If you have some time in the afternoon to enjoy a good conversation with good friends, stop by and have some hot chocolate with churros, it is definitely a great experience in an authentic place. We wouldn't order the Paella here because my wife makes the best Paella, so it is not fair to compare, by the same token, I cannot render an opinion on it. Finally, before you leave spend some time and money in the mini market next door, we always find the right ingredients to entertain, and also for our home made Paella - In the grand scheme of things, we are far better off with Delicias de Espana in Miami than without them !

There's just something about crispy french fries with savory and spicy sauce dripping all over them. Unfortunately, the patatas bravas at Las Tapas de Rosa were unlike any patatas bravas we'd ever had.

These folks should be ashamed for even daring to call that dish patatas bravas. I couldn't believe how bad it was.Sadly, the croquetas weren't much better. They were tasteless.

Xixon is the best.This is a little cheaper and they have a decent variety of tapas, sandwiches, main courses... I guess the food is hit or miss, depending on what you get.The wine selection is good and affordable. I liked that. We were literally kicked out. They close at 10PM and they want you gone fast, obviously. We tried a Torta de Santiago which was not very good (since it's imported frozen) and right after that, they dropped the check and asked us to leave because they had to clean up.

The bread was soooo yummy. So we ordered the almejas, croquetas, bacalao, mariscada, and pollo al limon, Everything was really really good and tasty. My only complaint is that the croquetas were tiny. Miniscule. Literally one inch long. It would be nice if they would be a tad larger. But still, they were tasty.We had the crema de catalana for dessert. Very good as well. They have their own parking lot you just have to pay the city for it. Total for all was $123. No drinks.

The sauce that the marriage of the pork fat drippings and cider made were a perfect match to be sopped up with that delicious bread. \u00a0On to the entree, I ordered the sole dish which included fried potatoes and mixed vegetables of asparagus, tomatoes, and more that were stewed to perfection. \u00a0I am at a loss for words to describe just how good it was.

They have a security guard, but when I went the guy was on his phone the whole time we were at dinner. Whats the point?Inside its really small and cramped.

She went one by one and wrote each one down. She did it right next to me on the table, so yes, I know she did. Our order was screwed up and not everything we ordered was brought out. We eventually canceled everything that wasn't borught out with the rest of our food. However, when the bill came, everything was still there and then some. We told our waitress about \u00a0the error and she proceeded to scratch off the mistakes off the receipt and redid it. Once it came back, yet again, it still had errors on it. This time she called the manager/owner. She literally made us all go,one by one, and tell her exactly what we ate and drank. She wrote it ALL down..I saw her. She came back a few minutes later with a pretty accurate receipt but said she didnt believe the # of cidras we told her. WTF? Are we really going to trick you on 2-3 cidras that are worth $3 each on such a hefty bill? We bitched and whined and she finally took them off, but not before we each had to retell her the amount of drinks we each had. We took 20-30 minutes just to get the check in order.

I have eaten these croquettes in Madrid, Toledo, and Segovia, and theirs naturally, as the staff hails from Toledo, Malaga, Galicia, and Asturias, are definitely equal. Another good sign is that many of the patrons are Cubans whose parents or grandparents were Spaniards, and those patrons aren't easy to please. The tortilla espanola, (we call omelets tortillas, there is no bread in our tortillas) is another MUST-try. I have ordered from the sandwich selection. Try el Mallorquin- Crusty Spanish Baguette with \"Sobrasada\"- a raw sausage and Cabrales cheese or el Catalan-Crusty \"pantomaka\" with Serrano ham or el Asturiano- Crusty Spanish baguette Cabrales cheese, chorizo and olive oil...& you will not be disappointed. Their paellas are exquisite & definitely worth the wait. For dessert, their Torta de Santiago de Compostela, which is an almond-like cake, a bit dry, but very flavorful, is worth a try. The torejas are divine as well. There is a tiny store in the back with basic items, definitely worth a look. The prices are terribly reasonable, and I would say cheap, for tapas.

Most of the time you get unreasonably expensive restaurants that give you less than average tapas. You order 5 of them and you end up with a $50 tab. Well this place is the complete opposite and you'd never expect such a wonderful experience in that part of the city. The restaurant sits in a horribly orange lit strip mall but once you get inside you get hit with a huge \"Viva Espana\" reality check.The food is amazing, from the hams (Jabugo, Serrano) to the wide selection of tapas to the excellent paella (made to order), you are in for a great experience. I will not go through the list of what we ate but you must try the Lagostinas a la plancha. Prices are more than reasonable and you will be shocked by the cost of a bottle of the house wines ($18) which are very good.

She was very respectful, attentive, and just overall made you feel at home.Since we went in mid-day and there were three of us, we decided to order some tapas instead of any main courses. First we started with a wooden tablet with Spanish cheese, serrano ham, and chorizo - all of which was drizzled with some great tasting olive oil. Great quality stuff. We then ordered some fried calamari which was pretty good but nothing special or out of the ordinary from the average good quality fried calamari you would find in a good restaurant. After the calamari we had some codfish croquettes which was some of the best codfish croquettes I have had in this city. Great flavor and not too salty. We finished with some Galician-style octopus. This was the best plate we had had that day. The octopus was cooked in true Galician style with potatoes, paprika, and some olive oil. Had a nice little kick and I am not a big fan of spicy food but I found this kick very tolerable. Definitely a must-order when you dine there!For drinks we ordered the Sangria which was one of the best sangrias I have ever had. It was absolutely delicious! Perfect balance of sweetness, fruitiness, wine and alcohol. I didn't get a chance to get a good look at the wine list, but unless there is some high quality wine on the menu (which I am sure there is) I would say definitely go for the Sangria.

The food is authentic and as close as you can get to real Spanish cuisine without crossing the Atlantic. You can never go wrong with La Paella Valenciana. Sure, it takes 45 minutes (sometimes longer on holidays) to prepare, but what better excuse to order calamares fritos, queso manchego, and a pitcher or two of sangria? Their wine selection is wonderfully curated, but if you're not into fussing about a wine list simply order, \"vino rojo de la casa\" (house red wine)--I'm not sure what the name of the wine is, but it's as good, or maybe even better than the stuff that's twice the price. The atmosphere is authentic and I truly feel like I'm in Spain when I go there. I recommend going after 9pm, though.

B.", "The European Financial Crisis has come to Miami!!!!!If Casa Juancho is a true representative of Spanish Cuisine in Miami, then it should serve as a good explanation as to why today Spain is a \"SUBMERGING\" economy and is the \"S\" in PIGS Let me start with the positives. The restaurant has a decent decor, reminiscent of old wooden basements and cellars. The menu listing, while others have found the labels obnoxious, I found to be quite entertaining. The \"bible of wine\" was sizeable and enjoyable. That said, our party of 4 opted to attempt a true Spanish experience and went for the Sangria. I like to take responsibility where it is due, and this was our first of many mistakes. If you like drinking turpentine, then this is the Sangria for you. One of us was smarter when she opted to change to white wine. I and my buddy were left to our devices to finish the pitcher we had foolishly ordered. In between our Robitussin Sangria and the appetizers we were accosted by an annoying band of gypsies, otherwise to be known as the guitar singers of the establishment. Mind you, we were trying to hold a conversation at our table but they surrounded us as if they were adding to the ambiance. Yes, they played \"sappy romantic\" songs. The best of this part of the evening was when they asked not once, but twice for a tip. The second guy saying \"If you want to tip us it is now or never\". How does \"never\" sound? We actually considered giving them money just so they would go away never to return. One of us did politely clap for them, bless her heart!The appetizers were actually good. We ordered scallops, razon clams, and shrimp. Since we were not eating at a tourist dump on Ocean Drive we reached the conclusion it would take a lot to ruin fresh seafood. In that regard they did a good job (or so we thought). That said, what came next should be added to the 7 Deadly Sins - Making BAD Paella. I really don't understand what other reviewers have been smoking when raving about this or even if they have traveled to Spain (I have a few times). The Paella Valenciana took 45 minutes as stated in the menu, but it was mediocre at best (that is a compliment given the seafood was SEVERELY overcooked). A tragedy of epic proportions, not even the Greeks in the middle of their crisis would serve anything like that. Hey, they may be in debt, but they must always eat and drink well. The best decision we made, skipping dessert!!!!!!Sadly this establishment gives Spain a bad reputation (given Spain is one of the places I have had the best food, ever). As we walked out we felt bad for other patrons. The place was full. This just goes to show that there are many people in this city and world with serious bad taste in food. Friends don't let friends eat bad food!!!Alas, we were willingly pickpocketed \"Barcelona Subway Style\" by Casa Juancho.

Everything was great, and very authentic. The owner and waiters are all from Andalucia and super friendly. We had the tortilla espa\u00f1ola, chickpeas, shrimp and artichokes in garlic sauce, and (not sure how to better describe this one) fried grouper chunks. The tortilla was surprisingly good, didn't have the dried out egg texture they sometimes have, and was served with an aioli. Chickpeas were also good, my parents loved them though I was too distracted by the other dishes. The shrimp and artichokes were awesome and I don't even really like artichokes. The artichokes were super tender, and I was tempted to lick the sauce off the plate. And the grouper....I didn't know bits of fried fish could taste so good. They practically melt in your mouth. We shared the trio of mousses for dessert and it was pretty tasty. My parents' taste in restaurants is usually pretty mediocre, but this place blew me away. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but I hope they stick around cuz I'd love to come back the next time I'm in town. The servings were large and the prices very reasonable."], ["A S.", "This restaurant is located where Xixon used to be before they moved to the bigger place in the corner.

We also had sausages with chickpeas, sausages in wine sauce (a little salty), and a sausage and cheese plate.

The four of us left full for about $100. Highly recommend."], ["Dave P.", "All you need to know is Bocaito is the best tapas and Spanish restaurant in Miami. They don't mess around there. I don't work for them or know them (I wish I did though!!)- \u00a0but their food freaks me out every time. I've also been to pretty much every Spanish/Tapas place in Miami, I've also been all over Spain several times. \u00a0I can tell you that the food at Bocaito is better than the majority of the restaurants in Spain - it's hard to believe, but it's true. Their whole crew there is Spanish - chef from Spain, waiters from Madrid, Barcelona, Andalucia etc. Bocaito is an under the radar secret in Miami - if you know Spanish food - this the superior place in Miami. \u00a0But please keep it a secret..... If you like El Carajo, as I love, you will like Bocaito even more. \u00a0Try the chef's specials any night, try their Garbanzos, etc. My wife and I just went there and the chef's special was a tapa of Tuna on the plancha, with a scallop in the middle of two fillets, with a wicked sauce on top. \u00a0It was insane. \u00a0But we've discovered that every time we head there their specials impress us - no matter what we get. My wife and I know and love Spanish food and have been just about every place in Miami - Bociato is the best. \u00a0You must go immediately!"], ["Erin S.", "Bocaito is a Spanish restaurant tucked away on Coral Way in the Grove. \u00a0I got a groupon and asked my (Spanish) boyfriend if he knew of the restaurant & he said he knew the owner, so we made a reservation for that evening & had a nice time. \u00a0We had 2 entrees that were available with the groupon, I had a baked tilapia & my boyfriend had a fried fish (native to Spain, or something) & truly the entrees were superb. We also had Ensalada Rusa for an appetizer which to me was bland and had little flavor, I NEVER salt anything but I put tons of salt & pepper on this dish & still was craving flavor (lemon? capers? paprika? red pepper flakes? anything). \u00a0I met Diego, the owner (from Spain) & the chef, Angel (from Cuba) & the wait staff was all very kind & friendly. \u00a0Overall, we had a very very nice evening with good food & affordable, tasty wine.Wellllllll, when more groupons became available for Bocaito, I jumped at the purchase & told my boyfriend & our 3 friends that were visiting from Spain that we had to go! \u00a0We went & again were greeted very warmly by Diego, who chatted with us frequently & was great company, as always. \u00a0We ordered lots of tapas & a bottle of wine for the table. \u00a0The tapas were only decent. \u00a0I ate, literally, a basket of warm bread because I was still so hungry afterwards. \u00a0We got the Ensalada Rusa again (Spanish classic) & it was still just as flavorless as the first time. \u00a0The shrimp were tasty but expensive and only came with 5 in a dish (so we ordered 2) and we got fried calamari which was greasy and all batter, no calamari. \u00a0On top of that, our server, from Madrid, was gossipy & rude. \u00a0We overheard her on at least 2 occasions speaking ill of our table, even though we were friendly and were racking up quite the bill. \u00a0The plate of jamon serrano, manchego cheese & chorizo was much anticipated & came with no more than 6 thin slices of jamon. \u00a0The chorizo tapa was flavorful & tasty & the sauce was perfect for dipping the 10 slices of bread that I consumed in.Ambiance is lacking (it is quite bright & reads more like an office space)Overall, I recommend Bocaito for a dinner with entrees, not for a tapas meal."], ["Leslie R.", "This is my first-ever yelp review, so I saved it for my FAVORITE restaurant in Miami. I'm a foodie: I moved here from New Orleans (Anthony Bourdain agrees with me that it's the best eating city in the country!) and I travel a lot. We've spent a lot of time in Spain, and most of that time was spent in restaurants--ha--so I think I know what I'm talking about, and this is the most consistently enjoyable food in Miami. They have all the classics, but they're innovative, too. I must've eaten there twenty times, and Bocaito never lets us down. The chocos (little squid, not always on the menu, but ask!) rock my world, with two kinds of sauce: ink and something green and herbal. The garbanzos fritos are by far the best in town (sorry El Carajo: I love you, but you don't compare); if they have pulpo it will be exquisite; any tapa du jour will blow your mind. Tonight we had goat cheese a la plancha, and it was fantastic. The special red tuna tapa with garlic and scallop was incredible... I could go on and on. Even Bocaito's bread is better than other spots'. How do they do this?? And the service is amazing, so friendly and attentive. The owner is the nicest guy, and he sure knows how to choose a chef. Pleeeeeeeease go to this spot and become loyal customers. Just don't make it so busy we can't get a reservation, okay?"], ["G A.", "Wow, great dinner reasonably priced.

A watch-out is that tip is included when you get your final bill (we had a party of 5 and the tip was already included even though the menu said it was for \"parties of 6 or more\" so I believe they just include the tip for everybody.)When you are done with your meal, do not forget to take a bottle of wine home."], ["Michael G.", "This small but trendy Tapas and wine Restaurant its excellent. Call in advance because they do get packed and there is not a lot of seating.. Tostones rellenos de camarones and their churrasco are excellent choice."], ["Jennifer L.", "Gas station tapas you ask? No way that can be good. I thought the same thing for years until one time my friend and I decided to check the place out. It's behind the gas station right I ask my friend? We go around-nope it is actually inside the gas station. Think a converted 7-Eleven turned dining establishment. Don't let that deter you away. I regret that it did for me for so long. El Carajo has an excellent selection of wines not only because they are a Spanish restaurant but because they are wine shop as well. You arrive and pick your bottle of wine and bring it to the table at which point the waiter will open it up for you. I also recommend checking out their Sangria which is delicious and strong. You will have a hard time picking up the jarra it comes in after a few refills. I have only had tapas here and never the bigger plates so I can't speak much to those. As for food I have had so far they get it right. A lobster bisque served piping hot and full of flavor; croquettss with filling so creamy; cheese and meat platters with the finest Spanish selections; bacon wrapped dates to die for and more. Everyone has their favorites when eating Spanish tapas and El Carajo has them all. I would say if you like Spanish food this is a must stop spot. Don't let the gas pumps fool you!"], ["Amber B.", "We had a nice time and left happy. We liked the shrimp and garlic in olive oil the best. The bacon wrapped dates were pretty good. Stuffed with chorizo instead of cheese. The sausage and mushrooms in wine reduction also tasted good. It needed salt, but the sauce was delicious with bread once it was salted. Olives were yum. The sangria for sure had canned fruit cocktail as the fruit :( \u00a0 We had white, but it looked like the red at the next table had the same. The crab foo foo was not to my liking. The foo foo part was better than the crab part. The langosta empanada was the worst. bland and dry. The couple at the table on our other side were served a gorgeous seafood paella. It looked so good I wished we had ordered that. The service was slow and unfortunately I don't speak very much spanish. The ambiance (half gas station half tapas wine bar) was weird.

If that bothers you, you're probably EL SOBRADOR and shouldn't be eating here anyway. Go to south beach then.That being said, the food is amazing. Both meat and seafood \"tablas\" (planks) are not to be missed. For soup, the Caldo Gallego (smoked pork, ham and white bean soup) is my fave, really rich and flavorful broth. The white beans break down and thicken the broth, its really awesome. You can get fried yucca almost anywhere in MIA, but here its especially good, crispy with a flavorful dipping sauce. The Pulpo al ajillo (sauteed octopus in garlic sauce) was tender and succulent. The crab crepe was so different, and the sauce was so rich and tasty. Best to go with a party of 4 so you can try a few dishes. When my husband and I go, we usually split a soup, one of the planks, and one main dish. The portions are a good size and you get a basket of bread. Americans love that free bread and cannot stay away from it, don't we lol.The wait can be a bit long, as they don't have a lot of tables. Its worth it though! Parking can be a little bitchy since its a gas station, so just be patient, someone will pull out of a spot shortly.

Not only does El Carajo have delicious tapas, but they also have a great wine selection - and I am talking about the good stuff.

While you are sipping on your glass of wine make sure to try some of their tapas like their chorizo al vino and Suprema de Bacalo a la Vizca\u00edna."], ["Francisco M.", "We visited El Carajo while in Miami over Labor Day weekend and we have found a new favorite in Miami. The restaurant is very small and I definitely recommend you make reservations. We got lucky when we arrived and got a table but our waiter did say we needed to be done by 8:30pm because the table was reserved for that time. The menu is extensive and you have a lot to choose from. It's mostly a Tapas restaurant but they do have some entrees to choose from. We ordered the Meat Platter (Tabla De Carnes) and it is enough to feed two people. It comes with steak, chicken, pork, sausage, potatoes and fried plantains. The pork ribs were very tender and tasted delicious. The steak is \"churrasco\" skirt steak and it was tender and cooked to perfection. We ended with Crema Catalana for dessert which is a Spanish Creme Brulee but the sugar on top is a bit harder and more caramelized. The service was top notch. Since its a small place, there is always someone around to help. We didn't have to wait around for anything. For the wine lovers like me, I will give you one tip. If you choose to buy a bottle off the menu, they charge you a corkage fee of $10.00. You are buying the wine from the store inside the gast station/restaurant so it's a bit strange but the prices of these bottles are reduced. I paid $49.00 for a 1994 Rioja which is cheap considering the year of the wine. They offer wine by the glass but I found buying the bottle is more economical. The restaurant is located inside the Food & Deli store at the BP Gast Station. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Miami. Gives new meaning to \"Me Voy Pal Carajo!\""], ["Erick R.", "\"El Carajo\" Normally used as a bad word in Spanish... Not in this case! This one joins my top 3 list Nationwide! This hidden Gem is literally hidden inside a gas station in Coral Gables. You have to park right by the pumps and walk in as if you were going to ask to put $50 on #10. Once you walk in, you will be surprised by a bakery filled with mouthwatering sweets. Continue in and you will be greeted to the best Tapas and Wines Restaurant in South Florida. You'll be seated within thousands of wines that cover the walls, wines from any side of the world, ranging from $3/ bottle to the exclusive wine cellar; that you can walk in at your own leisure with bottles that will run you $500, there is a $10 corking fee with every bottle. The menu which is actually a scroll, adding to their Spanish Pirate/Sailing theme, has the perfect amount of items at the right prices to try a little bit of everything. We came this time with two other friends (Yelpers). We ordered the Chorizo al Vino (knock you on your ace good!!!), the Lobster Bisque, and Ham Croquetas, accompanied with a bottle of Santa Margarita. When then continued with more Chorizo al Vino, Ribs, Fufu de Cangrejo, Ham Croquetas, and a platter of Hams and Cheeses, accompanied with another bottle of wine. If you have not tried this Restaurant you are in for a Grand Surprise! Get reservations on Fridays and Saturdays."], ["Peggy G.", "Had a great dinner last Saturday. My bf and I shared a seafood plank, along with garlic octopus, mushrooms and the gambas al ajillo. What a feast! The corvina was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The waiter and chef were careful to be respectful of my dietary restrictions and sauteed the calamari which were amazing too. The platter was huge and had an assortment of meats all cooked perfectly. It came with crispy tostones. The mushrooms were a bit sweet for my taste but flavorful. The prawn and octopus are a must! Wish there was a gluten free dessert option but didn't have the appetite anyway! Great option for a date night or dinner with friends."], ["Patty G.", "One Saturday night, my husband and I pondered about where to go for dinner. \"Let's go to El Carajo\" he says. \"Why would you say such a thing!\" I respond. To make a long story short... Nos fuimos para El Carajo. This is one of those places that you find mainly through word of mouth. My husband's boss had said many good things about this restaurant. I thought the idea was strange and quite different. It's a gem, kind of place. Not unlike the Greek restaurant we used to frequent in Edgewater, NJ where you would sit in a cave-like atmosphere and enjoy sweet Baklava. As we approached the gas station, I still did not understand how this could be. A restaurant inside a gas station. We apprehensively walked into the \"LA Food Store and Deli,\" not really sure we would actually find a restaurant inside and appearing to go pay for our gas. You enter and to the left is the typical gas-station counter, to the right is a pastry shop/cafe, and at the back you will find El Carajo. This tapas restaurant has a beautiful array of wines and even a wine cellar that smells distinctly of wood. There are beautiful murals on the walls and a mixture of high tops and regular dining tables. We didn't have a reservation and the place seemed somewhat empty when we arrived. We were sent to one of the high tops and were greeted by our waiter immediately. Service was on point all night, even as the place filled up. We were tended to all the time. Plates removed once we were done eating, waters filled, food arrived quickly, and we were asked how everything was several times. The food was simply delicious. We started with the cold cuts and cheese platter (Combinacion Meson) which was very tasty. We also had the Caldo Gallego-- which made me melt in my chair. And we ended up sharing three tapas: Fufu de Cangrejo, Gambas al Ajillo, and Garbanzos Fritos. We loved everything! Oh and lest we not forget the Guava Cheesecake. 10 times better than any Cheesecake Factory-cheesecake! I guess the only downside to this place is that (as other Yelpers have noted) they charge a $10 corking fee to have any of the wines they carry! I've never heard of a restaurant charging a corking fee for buying a bottle in their own restaurant. Its just a little bit ridiculous. Highly recommended. A real treat to eat here!"], ["Isabella R.", "First and Foremost I want to dedicate my YELP review to my dear friend Jessica Melo.

For entree, we had some good paella. \u00a0Everything was perfectly paired with two nice bottles of Rioja. Prices are reasonable and everyone was very friendly. The owner came by the table to make sure everything was going well. This place is small and it gets busy quickly so my suggestion is to make reservations especially on show nights.

It's an authentic Spanish place, they don't woof down food in 5 min, so they also don't rush about taking your order. Adjust, it's an American problem. Drink your drink, converse with your partner, pretend you're in Europe where 5 course meals are still the norm.We ordered the croquettes of bacalo and also of chorizo, as well as a slice of torta, and a Serrano and manchego sandwich. The croquettes arrived first. You get so used to the croquettes in most Cuban places in Miami, prepare to be spoiled cause these are by far the best. Super creamy and nice sized with great garlic/mayo dipping sauce. The torta slice was huge and our sandwich came around the same time. I've become so used to pricey tapas restaurants in Miami where you have to spend $40 - $50 just to get fed well. Not here, we actually ordered more than we could handle. The torta alone could fill up a person with an average appetite. Everything was great, they make their own bread, real lovely bread! They also make their own chorizo. This is not the place to come if you're on a low carb diet or if you're looking to impress your date with the decor, but if you're a true foodie that wants some authentic food for a great price, you can't go wrong here. We went away very happy and I'll be coming back as soon as I get tired of salads."], ["R B.", "Unexpected pleasant surprise. The food was full of flavor and authentic... Menu prices are fair and reflect the quality of the food. From the outside I wasn't quite sure what to expect but inside the vibe is chill- comfortable and easy. Overall- sweet find :) Thanks yelpers."], ["Lulu P.", "I visited this place for lunch with my mom on a Thursday afternoon just past noon. When we arrived, only one table had a customer waiting. But the restaurant quickly got a little more busy a few minutes later. There was only one waitress and she became somewhat overwhelmed and it took about twenty minutes to get our drinks, which she got wrong anyway. Then the owner came by our table to let us know that they were out of the lunch special fabada. I'm not sure how since we ordered it and got one plate, but all of a sudden it was sold out? The strange thing was that the two ladies behind us had ordered the same thing AFTER us and got their orders. \u00a0And it wasn't like it was later in the day and everyone had ordered this. But we weren't picky or anything so when she offers us the lentil stew, we say ok, bring that. Five minutes later, the same person (the owner) comes to tell us they're out of the special fabada. I tell her, \"yes, you mentioned this and said you were bringing the lentils instead\" well, she insists that she never told us this. Again, strange. So after what seemed like an eternity, we got our lomo with potatoes. And this is where I'm the most upset because up until now, I forgave the bad service and the overly salty stew/appetizer mix-up, but the food...the food just sucked! All these people on yelp giving it great reviews I expected great food. But when food is so so so salty that all you taste is salt, that's the mark of bad cooking. And that's exactly what this was. We both disliked it intensely, and then, to make matters worse, when it was time to pay, they short-changed us $10. Finally, the soap in the bathroom was watered down. If they can't afford a much needed extra waitress, soap for the restroom, and other ingredients besides salt, where else are they cutting corners? Gross, just gross."], ["Luis P.", "How in the world does ANYONE have the courage to rate this place? Every plate we ordered should not be served. Cold, improperly cooked and not seasoned. I cannot say anything positive other than if you have an urgent need to pee, stop and use the bathroom!"], ["Juls S.", "Made a reservation through Yelp and they didn't honor it. It took 3 waiters/waitresses walking by us before someone asking us if we needed help. Tiny little place and bad service right off the bat. Wouldn't go back to try it out."], ["Joseph N.", "My favorite place to eat in this city. Great atmosphere, great food. The chorizo, croquetas, and lacon are must-order items."], ["Sandra G.", "We made reservations for Saturday for 15 guest. The place is small but the atmosphere is unique. As a heads up there is a $5 cover fee but it was a fun Saturday night. The entertainment was excellent and diverse, there was never a doll moment. Talented singer, guitar player and the costumers played and dance too. The food was good and the sangria was very sweet. The total for two was $56 (food+beverage+entertainment)"], ["Danny T.", "I'm not much of yelper but this place was phenomenal! \u00a0I tried los callos and they were the best I have ever tried and then I saw the lacon and to have it...it was amazing!! \u00a0Thank you Lola!"], ["Robert K.", "Aaaaaaaaamazing- at anytime of day. Just make sure se hable espa\u00f1ol.The chorizos are to die for- id come to this place before I'd even come to miami- wish they had it in Los Angeles..."], ["Maria P.", "My husband brought me into Lola's restaurant based on their Yelp reviews and I'm very happy he did, the food was very good and the service excellent . On weekend they have a Flamenco show we enjoy very much"], ["Olivia P.", "Celebrated by grandpas 88th birthday party along with 18 of my family members, and not one person was disappointed. Service was great for such a large group. Very patient with my small nephews which is very important to me. They really made our night special, and most importantly my grandfathers."], ["Jessica R.", "Make a reservation if you want to eat here!Came here with hubby while on vacay for a romantic dinner. When we arrived at 8pm, the place was dead, and I was wondering if we even needed to make a reservation. We did. By the time we got our food, place was packed to the gills. We ordered three tapas (sorry I cannot remember the names because the whole menu is in Spanish) and a large pork plate. My hubby had to do all the ordering, but he made some good choices! The place itself is super tight, as well as the parking lot, but it makes for an intimate setting. The chairs were a little uncomfortable to sit on, I would recommend taking some of them out and putting in some comfy booths along the walls. Now... about reservations... make them!!! We saw countless people come in and then turned away because they did not have one, including a large group of teens (quince I think?) which would no doubt have made them a lot of money. They also had live music playing, but after a lot of squeaking from the mic during their sound check, and then seeing the singer chugging wine in the entrance, we left before he got started LOL. As far as authenticity of the food, I can't say for sure, but it was delicious & I would go there again."], ["James P.", "Not only \"just a Spanish restaurant\" but one of the most enjoyable places to have tapas enjoy flamenco and great dinners. \u00a0The staff are outstanding and very friendly.My favorite place in Miami"], ["Iker A.", "Great place! Best morcilla in Miami. Authentic Spanish food. Flamenco show adds to the authenticity and ambience of the place."], ["George H.", "Simply amazing. Our waiter was friendly to newbies, suggesting a good beer. The food was classic Spaniard fair with a delicious flair and style. I do recommend!"], ["Frank C.", "Authentic Southern Spain cuisine! I felt like I was in C\u00f3rdoba!Ask Lola what she recommends. This place is really good, and absolutely no nonsense. Her homemade chorizo is phenomenal. The stuffed poblano (although Mexican) with Manchego and chistorras are delicious! Nice wine list too."], ["Lily B.", "I went to Lola's to celebrate my birthday with friends. \u00a0The restaurant is small so reservations are a must. \u00a0Parking is scarce because the restaurant is located in a small shopping mall but there is parking on the streets. They have a Flamenco show on Friday & Saturday. The show on Friday was great. \u00a0The guitarist and singers are awesome. The service was slow but our waitress was super nice. \u00a0We were glad that service was slow \u00a0because it gave us time to talk and relax. \u00a0Sometimes we live in such a fast pace that we forget that good conversation and good food should be enjoyed not rushed. Felt as if we were in Spain. All of the tapas were superb.The sangria delicious! We were so full that we could not order a main dish so will do so next time. I am a foodie and all of the plates that I saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing. \u00a0The food is fresh and well-prepared with good quality ingredients. The owner came to our table personally to apologize because they had run out of a dish. \u00a0What more can I say! \u00a0An applause to Lola for giving us a little bit of Spain in Miami. \u00a0Looking forward to eating there again."], ["Gianni D.", "If you watch Anthony Bourdain \u00a0and his Layover series, this place would probably be one of those hidden gems you would expect to find on a show like that. This place is small really small. A deli style glass fridge and a counter top with a couple mini table outcropping with maybe 8 bar stools. My mother of all people was the one who recommended this place to me. She mentioned that the owner was from Malaga and makes her own Chorizo, and \u00a0no set menu. I mentioned this place to a friend and coincidentally said his own mother also recommended the place and would be very upset if he did not go there with her first. So against her wishes and my curiosity we set out to find this Spanish eatery. I was born in Miami with Cuban parents so not to say, we were greeted by an older spanish lady, could be construed into any one of the many latin ethnicities we have in Miami, so to clarify we were greeted by a real Spaniard. The place as I mentioned, is small, but clean, appropriately decorated with different food products from spain, as many of these spanish places have a tendency to do, like Delicias De Espa\u00f1a. I specially loved the corky spanish \u00a0music (flamenco I believe) that gave the place an even more authentic feeling. Just make sure you face towards the inside, as looking out the window and seeing 8th street, could compromise this vibe of being somewhere in Spain.We had the de facto standard of Saut\u00e9ed Chorizo in Wine. I had never tried \"homemade\" chorizo, it was fresh and the flavor vibrant,. For our entre we had the Friday special of her non-seafood Paella. I am allergic to seafood, so it had been a while since I had a paella I could eat. The owner mentioned that every friday they have paella and alternate between the seafood and meat versions. The paella was very flavorful, check out the image I uploaded. This particular recipe originated in Malaga which is influenced by the Moors, so maybe different than what you may have tasted otherwise.We had a very inexpensive, but delicious red wine and topped the meal off with a cuban coffee which was surprisingly good.This place is amazing, its hidden, but is being discovered by those whom are always on the look out for authentic spanish food. Make sure you check this place out before people get wind of how good it is. You heard it here first."], ["Ramsey C.", "Great food, warm atmosphere...highly recommended..... The Sangria & the flamingo music is a match made in heaven.The Tapas are out of this world ...."], ["Madeline M.", "Went on a Wednesday night, had the home chorizos appetizer... delicious and a great Sangria. \u00a0Went back on Friday and had the Lacon al vino which was very tasty. \u00a0Flamenco show at 9:30 pm with a very reasonable $5.00 cover charge. \u00a0Weekends they strongly recommend reservations. \u00a0The downside...parking is a little difficult and the place rather small. \u00a0I will go back with no hesitation. \u00a0Very friendly staff and great service."], ["Bee E.", "This place is legit. I've only been to Spain a couple of times, and am no expert, but Lola's had the best Spanish food I've had in Miami to date. They make their own chorizo, and it's awesome. Everything else we had was also very good, and reasonably priced. I would have to check again, but I believe that they may now be open a little later during the week than the Yelp info shows. It's worth noting that although she was very nice, I'm not sure our waitress spoke much English, and the menu is all in Spanish. I had the husband to translate for me, but if you don't speak Spanish, be prepared to point and smile. Which is probably a safe strategy anyway, since all the food was so good."], ["Martha F.", "I love this restaurant. \u00a0The food is excellent and the service is great. \u00a0Cannot wait to go back."], ["Amanda D.", "I can't believe I found a restaurant in Miami who serves Morcilla de Burgos!!!! Delicious food! And great prices. Make me actually feel like I'm in Spain!"], ["Alex A.", "Fantastic Spanish food"], ["SnapHappy P.", "Delicious paella! Warm hospitality! And VERY warm hosts!"]]}
