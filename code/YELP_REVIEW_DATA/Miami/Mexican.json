They do accept credit cards, so it is still the USA."], ["Patrick L.", "It's pretty difficult to argue with cheap, simple Mexican food. I do mean simple - tacos here are really nothing but chopped marinated meat in a corn tortilla, with a little cilantro and onion if so desired. Very simple, but effective. I like the four tacos sampler for around $10 - as I recall, you get beef, carnitas, al pastor, and lengua. Of course, which one's my favorite? You should have guessed - the tongue taco. They're all great, but I feel the meat in that one has the superior texture and flavor.Don't come here expecting anything fancy, either regarding food or surroundings. There are other places in town that do gussied-up tacos - this is plain street food. No AC here, either, so be prepared to sweat it out, whether sitting inside or out.

It reminds me a the taco stand and hole-in-the-wall-wall places that I miss from Los Angeles. But I was disappointed by the experience last night for dinner. The experience is authentic enough, but the food is mediocre. Ordered the taco platters with a combination of chicken, beef and flavored pork (pollo, carne asada, y al pastor). The taste was ok, but the quality seemed lacking. The meat was overdone and cut so small is almost seemed like ground meat. The menu is pretty limited, so I would have expected better quality dishes.

I order the flautas and a Agua de Jamaica. The wait time was reasonable, and the only reason I mention this is because I had nothing else to do but count the minutes. The seating is very awkward and there is no A/C. Something I would experience in Nicaragua with mind blowing food to follow.That's not the case here. The food arrives, and it looks incredibly amateur. Alongside small portions. The taste itself? Meh. Now...

Eat your food and beg to be driven home at some time in the coming weeks. Knowing that resistance was futile, I ordered a beer (why not?) and a chorizo huarache with cheese and green sauce. While not as life-changing as the huaraches I ate to the point of stomach ache back in Chicago, this Miami version was quite tasty. But, really. When are onions, pork, cheese, and salsa not a winning combo. I would have preferred a bit more depth to the corn base but, at that time, I also would have preferred to be in my bed. Neither was happening any time soon. I also took advantage of the other salsas and tried to change up every bite with a different one. I kept, though, coming back to the green. Since you're kidnapped and at the will of your captor, play along and shoot the breeze with other kidnapped/kidnappers. These are salt (or, drunks) of the earth. Case in point: one kidnapped/kidnappee screached to see a foot-long roach ambling about the street, poised to attack someone. I went still in an effort to utilize my chameleon-like abilities to blend in and, hopefully, be spared.

I flagged someone down and she took my order, very polite. Disorganized as no one knew who was doing what and no one checked if anyone took my order. Or it could be that they ignore solo females because they think we tip badly. Overpriced and they use fillers. Pleased when these ginormous crunchy ground beef tacos arrived until I saw the filling. They were 90% lettuce. What they do is mix a few pieces of beef into the shredded lettuce, then they fill the taco with the lettuce mixture and top with minimal cheese. It was basically lettuce and shell. Same with the steak burrito, filled with 90% rice. I asked for no beans in it but still barely got any beef, only tiny bits, and it was not tasty, not for those prices.

The carnita was tender and full of flavor and with the sauce on top of it, oh boy it was heaven.My gf stole one of my tacos and I stole one of here enchiladas that was smothered in mole poblano. Now mole poblano is a traditional Mexican sauce which contains about 20 ingredients, including chili peppers and chocolate. From what I was told, this is not a simple sauce to make as it takes a lot of hard work, but if done right (as it was done here) then it is probably one of the best sauces you could ever have.

I have been eating here for years. It's always been great...the food, the sangria, the environment and the service...until yesterday. My husband ordered Lechon Asado and I ordered Masas de Cerdo. Delish as always, but I thought that the dish needed a drop more avocado sauce - so I \u00a0asked the waiter for some. I saw the hesitation on his face but he brought over a tiny little plastic condiment cup (say 1/2 inch deep by 1 inch in diameter) filled with about a teaspoon of avocado - no questions asked. It helped. At the end of the meal, I used the ladies room and was surprised when I went to get a paper towel to dry my hands. The automatic dispenser spit out a piece of brown paper towel that was so small a child could not have successfully dried its hands. It had to be two inches tall by 6 inches across. Seriously? C'mon... I understand trying to save money but if it's so rough than install an air dryer. It's a total turnoff. I brought it back to the table to show \u00a0my husband, when the bill came. We were charged $1.99 for a bit of avocado. Really? Not okay. \u00a0 We are not cheap people, but that's not cool. \u00a0There should have been more on the dish to begin with. If it were done properly the first time around, we wouldn't have had to ask for more. We are not greedy \"try to get something for nothing\" people and we are happy to pay for anything that should be paid for but we also do not like being nickeled and dimed to death.So we shared those exact thoughts with the waiter. He apologized and explained that it was not his decision- it was the managers. So asked to speak with the manager and when he did not come over we got up to speak with him. He was first unresponsive and then flat out nasty about the situation. He refused to hear our side and told us if it was on the bill we'd have to pay it. We were a bit shocked but decided to pay it. When we looked at the bill, we realized that they had charged our card twice. Talk about adding insult to injury! Two diet cokes and two meals -$67 at this inexpensive neighborhood \u00a0joint. They removed the double charge, we paid and left. We are saddened by this grossly negligent and unfortunate occurrence. It could have all been avoided if the manager had any knowledge of how to take care of customers. \u00a0We warn anyone who goes there from now on - check your bill and expect to be charged for everything."], ["Simon M.", "My favorite Latin restaurant.

They provide extra hot tortillas and plenty of sides for the fajitas, and the waiter was correct, those orders were huge, suddenly $16.99 per order means it's a double order.

Of course, if you feel uncomfortable with them, they also have traditional pork, chicken and beef tacos.I ordered 4 tacos with pork ear, stomach, tongue and beef tripes to go (they provide a few tables, but no a/c here). Instead of getting 4 individual tacos, they mixed all 4 ingredients together, which actually made the taco taste better. All ingredients are pre-marinated and the flavor is just perfect. And because they mix everything, I got to enjoy the brittle pig ear, stomach and tripes with distinctive flavor in one bite, which is like a heaven party in my mouth.However, I have to warn you that pork and beef stomach and tripes have a very distinctive flavor, and some of you may not like it.

But I highly, highly recommend trying some of the different pork tacos!Raised by a Chinese family, I'm no stranger to eating strange parts of animals. I ordered the lengua (tongue), oreja (ear), maciza (leg), and buche (stomach). My favorites, by far, were the tongue and stomach. They're both very tender, and the stomach offers a great chewy consistency to go with the tacos. I didn't care much for the ear, since I'm not a fan of the unsuspecting crunch you get when you bite through cartilage. The pork leg is on the leaner side, so if you've had roast pig before, you'll know exactly how dry it can be. Thankfully, you can sauce those tacos up with your own personal salsa bar!

First off, I ordered the tacos because I'm not very adventurous when it comes to new places and their food (I like to be able to compare!). When the server mentioned a red cabbage that came on the taco I was hesitant, but decided (based on other reviews) to try it. No joke, that stuff literally made the taco 5 stars.

Yeah, most places are growers not show-ers, but even after giving this place a few tries it just isn't doing it for me. If it somehow manages to grow another couple of sqft then I'll definitely give it another go.3 stars really isn't bad, but it hurts when you know a place has potential to be better. Biggest issue here is that it is too popular for a space that can only fit a handful of tables. This leaves you feeling claustrophobic / uncomfortable and leads to long waits for seats. There could be a wait anywhere, but i just don't think that this particular place would be worth the potential 1hr+ wait from time of arrival to the time you're served your food since it could take a while to craft a couple of tacos too.The wait staff always makes me feel like we're pals. Going with the tattoo culture theme most of the staff looks a little grungy and the decor almost makes it look like a little tattoo parlor - Cheesy ultra colorful skull painting and all. My one gripe about the service is that they don't seem to care so much for the suckers that sit outside. If you're sitting outside you have to ask for the complimentary chips since they won't automatically bring them or offer them to you. Food orders might be given less priority too. The one time i ate inside it took less than 10 min to get some tacos, compared to 25+ minutes for my outside orders. #ConspiracyFOOD: Don't expect a traditional Mexican menu. They don't offer much variety but the menu is definitely fun, especially the deserts. I can say that their regular tacos, quesadillas, tostones rellenos and deep fried oreos w/ vanilla ice cream are pretty delicious. What makes their tacos and quesadillas so good is the sauce. Don't blame me if your taste buds disagree though, blame your taste buds for being wrong. Talking about wrong, they have a couple of offerings for the VEGETARIANS too.The one thing I DON'T recommend is the $2 \"Taco Tuesday\" taco. It sounds like they are hooking you up with their regular delicious tacos on special, but it is actually a different taco. Smaller, no special sauce / purple cabbage / tomato chunks or cheese. If this is all you try from T&T then you are doing your mouth a great injustice. You're saving a couple of cents but losing all the flavor.Definitely not good for groups, not good for dates and barely OK for a casual sit down. Until they expand or work out the kinks (Just opened earlier this year), calling in your order for take-out is the way to go IMO."], ["Kimberly K.", "I came here for taco Tuesday with 4 friends and let me just start by saying if you wanna come get some $2 tacos rolling that deep on a Tuesday...

No big deal though cause they're totally worth regular price. I only wish our server told us. Our sever was named yamir, and besides that little note, he was excellent.

Plan on arriving early or waiting patiently because the whole place only seats about 20-25 people. I ordered a craft beer, churrasco taco, chicken taco, buffalo chicken taco, patacon with fried cheese and pico de gallo. I was addicted to the complimentary chips and salsa they brought to the table. The seasoning on the chips was spicy but not offensively spicy, and even as my lips burned with each bite, I just couldn't stop eating them!!! Everything I ordered was delicious but my hands down favorite was the patacon. Throw fried cheese on top of a fried plantain with some pico and it's straight up heaven any way you slice it. I sampled some of my friend's Cali love fries and they were equally as delectable. Their craft beer selection is pretty good and reasonably priced. They were also offering samples of beer before you purchased which was impressive!

However, the food definitely speaks for itself. One thing about T&T that you should know before you go: it is SMALL. There are probably about 20 seats, including the bar, so expect to get very cozy with your neighbors. With that in mind, we arrived on a Sunday 10 minutes before opening. In that ten minutes, we went from being the only ones waiting to be part of about 20 people waiting. Obviously, the restaurant filled immediately on opening (even the bar). The food is fresh cooked to order, so if you're timing is off, you may wait quite a while for a table. People walked in right after opening, and since the restaurant filled at opening, they had to wait a LONG time to sit down. It's obvious the establishment has already outgrown its location. The beer menu is quite extensive. Only two on draft, but plenty of craft beer in bottles and cans. T&T had a wide variety of local brews, as well. We've been twice, and the service has been pretty consistent. Not too over-the-top, but our water was full the entire time, and our servers were friendly enough. \u00a0Upon seating, you're immediately provided with chips and fresh salsa, which was quite tasty. We ordered three tacos: churrasco, shrimp, and chicken, all on corn tortillas. Delicious! I would go there just for the churrasco taco. It was divine. We also ordered three Tostones Rellenos: churrasco, shrimp, and chicken. They were also delicious! With the 6 menu items and one beer, our tab was $22. Not bad at all. Honestly, the only downfall is the size of the restaurant. We've wanted to go back a few times, but have been hesitant because we know how long the wait can be. Otherwise, definitely worth a try if you're a fan of Mexican food with a twist. Well done!"], ["Stephanie P.", "This place lives up to the hype and more! It's the definition of a hidden gem. It's located in a neighborhood strip mall that probably has never seen as much action prior to Tacos and Tattoos moving in.It's a very small space; I believe it had four tables inside for two and one for three, along with bar seating and some tables and benches outside. The ambience is very much what you'd expect from a place whose name includes the word \"tattoo.\" I'm sure they'll be expanding soon at this rate!Food. Food. Food. My favorite. The free chips and salsa are already enough reason to go again, so fresh! For my entree I had a Patacon, I'd make everyone order one just to pray they hated it so I could do 'em a solid and finish it on their behalf. It's about $10. I didn't think one Patacon con fill me up but it did! It's a huge tostone with everything that would come in your taco on top. Delicious. It has a kick but softens the blow with honey!

I've been to quite less expensive Mexican restaurants where they cook the beef to order. \u00a0Also the parking at this location is horrible you have to park at a meter and walk almost a block, I understand it's a busy location where parking is limited but if that is the case they should offer valet parking services. \u00a0Then at the end the receipt says that when you come back for the 10th time you'll receive 10% off. \u00a0Really!

The salsas were great, I just wish they had a spicier option.Chilaquiles is my favorite breakfast food ever. Switched the chicken to eggs bc I'm a vegetarian. Perfect amount of sauce, the chips were still slightly crunchy, the beans on the side were great, eggs were great. Overall it was a solid dish. Only thing it needed was to be a little spicier.My gf ordered the chorizo and eggs baguette. They had ran out of bread so they offered a wrap instead (gave us free espresso because of this). She liked it but she would've preferred the baguette. Not a big deal.Service was incredible. Food came out within 10-15 minutes. Waiters were super attentive and nice!

Ended up leaving chicken & making a 3rd carne asada taco with the little tortilla and some carne asada left over from the other tacos... The queso fundido is delicous. It is a baked melted cheese that you can place inside a tortilla. Also, original flan is DELICIOUS , did not care for guava flan.

Ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and it had to have been made fresh because there were avocado halves thrown in there. Not the best mashing/mixing job of guac I've seen but it was good. I have to say that what lacked for me was flavor. The guacamole was missing something for sure and we ordered a mix of their tacos and while the meats were super tender and moist they just didn't have much flavor to them. Except for maybe salt. I definitely tasted salt in there. So I added a couple of their sauces and some gauc and voila...it helped. It was a good experience.

They're presented perfectly in corn tortillas,with just onion, cilantro..and that's pretty much it.

I believe I counted a grand total of 8 tables (with a \u00a0few more outside). Also, parking is tight and limited. But that being said, the food is so so good. This place has all of the usual suspects and downright awesome prices. El Hub went with a combination taco platter including the Chorizo, shredded beef, and chicken tacos, while I ordered three tacos Al Pastor. They were small (as they should be) and really just a couple of bites. But I found that it was the perfect lunchtime size as you did not feel like someone had to roll you out of the restaurant. English-only speakers may need to practice their Spanish to make ordering a bit easier. But that will be the least of my worries next time I head over there for some scrumptious eats!"], ["Israel R.", "I really want to give this place 3 stars but i can't bring myself to do it. I have a feeling that when i come back and try something else, it will totally redeem itself.Lets start off with the bad - the dining area is about the size of my tool shed. Even though i like my shed, i really don't want to feel like i'm eating in it. If it werent for my GPS i probably wouldn't have found this place because it's so small. Once YOU find this place i suggest you drive by and look for metered / street parking, if you like your car. Although there are over 10 spaces in the parking lot (which were actually full and double parked), the real drawback is the blind exit. In this neighborhood it is very likely to have to viejito rip your front bumper off as you creep out. I had noticed a few other review mention that the complimentary chips were stale - which was the case on my visit. I believe they prep a bunch of these to have them ready and they just happen to stay out longer than they should.On the upside - they make good use of the space on their dining area. The waitresses are really attentive... all of them... all 3 checked up on me. This could be because i forgot to turn the flash off of my camera though [oops, \"el yelpeh\" alert]. Food presentation is actaully nicer than most of the more expensive places i've eaten. They also had some really nice tasty cocktails.I went with the chicken flautas which come with mexican frijoles, guacamole and pico de gallo. \u00a0They nest the taquito missiles on top of some shredded lettuce, which i mixed with the frijoles and pico for a frijole salad. The taquitos were a bit overdone but they were still good - doesn't seem to be anything special in these (like a sweet secret sauce). I liked the frijoles a lot more than the flautas.It's an OK place with decent mex food. I wouldn't go out of the way for it but if you're in the area during lunch hours then it's worth checking out."], ["Geraldine A.", "Great service, great food. I tried the pollo, res and Mexiscan sausage.

Pollo de basura is good and had orchata ---rice milk-- is awesome!!!"], ["Julio H.", "Jacalito is the type of place that poses a great problem to foodies, food lovers, gourmands, and people who like good food in general. Jacalito's food is so good, you don't need to look elsewhere, and that is a problem, because with so many new restaurants, chefs, trucks, and cuisines opening up every week in the Magic City, you are stuck eating at Jacalito. And you don't want to go anywhere else!One of my greatest frustrations, gastronomically, is that I have never been to Mexico. Actually, I have never even been to a state that borders Mexico. I don't know exactly what is \"authentic\" Mexican food, homestyle Mexican food, street taco culture, etc., and I can only rely on what people call Mexican food as my point of reference. But, here comes the but, I have been to almost every restaurant, hole on the wall, and truck, that deems itself worthy of calling their food \"Mexican food\".So, with that in mind, I can simply say that Jacalito is my favorites, if not one of my favorites.The difference here is that the ingredients are better than at the other restaurants. The steaks are better, they are still not NY strip or grass fed, but they are the best quality of the bunch. For sure. The same applies to the chicken, guacamole, salsa, sauces, etc., everything here is freshly made, the vegetables are cooked al dente, the ingredients are not murdered under the heat. In summary, they know how to cook.Two items are my favorites here: the Tampique\u00f1a and the chuletas a la Mexicana. The Tampique\u00f1a is a steak served with an enchilada, like for people who are hungry. It's a straightforward steak, and a straightforward enchilada, served with rice and beans. The chuletas a la Mexicana are pork chops that are topped with green peppers, onion and jalape\u00f1o, and they are served with rice, beans and tortillas. It is also a lot of food.Like I said before, everything here is very fresh. I sometimes order guacamole and salsa as an appetizer, and it always disappears. They also make queso, which is really good, specially the one that has chorizo on top.As far as the tacos go, this place is called a taqueria, and I have seen Mexican people come from other towns to eat them here. I don't know what they find in them, to me they are just good tacos, but I don't have that esteem for tacos like Mexicans do. I actually like fish tacos and shrimp tacos, but I won't say that at Jacalito, they may think I am a hippie, or worse, a hipster.Finally, there are dessert on the menu. They are good, but not the best. They also sell a margarita that is pretty good and made in-house, although I don't know how crafty it is. If you have had margaritas made with tequila reposado, these may not cut it for you, but they are still worth a try. Overall, if you stick to the specialties, the tacos, the apps and the quesadillas, you are going to love this place. I don't have a saying about the tortas, and like I said, the drinks are good and the desserts are OK.Jacalito sits on Flagler Street, and it is a very small establishment. Maybe eight tables inside and three outside, this place is quaint. Service is good always, there are hiccups here and there but those are rare and are followed by a million apologies. Again, this is not a gourmet destination, this is not homestyle Mexican food from \"la nana\", it is kind of middle of the road, but... it is extremely good food.By the way, if you like spicy hot sauce, you have to ask for it."], ["Coriana R.", "Take food was delicious just the customer service was kinda ok the waiter took forever to bring us chips & salsa we asked her to take a picture she rolled her eyes and walked up the mana her was very good and helpful other than all of that food was delicious so was the margaritas"], ["Jeanette R.", "This place is great and cheap.

Now as the area has become increasingly trendy, this can pose a real problem since the wait can be pretty substantial for any of the more formal sit down dining options.Coyo is definitely a convenient solution, offering more traditional tacos stuffed with an assortment of meat choices in the heart of the neighborhood. \u00a0While they are fairly basic (pretty much just seasoned protein in a tortilla), they definitely fit the bill. \u00a0Be warned, they are a bit on the pricey side relative to other taquerias in town, and the portions are fairly tiny. However, they do offer everything from octopus to al pastor and I definitely appreciate the variety. In addition, they make a great guacamole, they offer some delectable paletas, as well as a homemade horchata.Lately it seems to be increasingly popular, so don't expect to walk right up and get food - it can take a while.

It definitively is the Chipotle of Wynwood, except for better taste (I am not sure about the whole sustainability and social responsibility part). It is always full, there are lots of people inside and outside, and hundreds of eyes are looking at you. I had been trying to go to Coyo for the longest time, ever since they opened. I would always show up too late and my only Coyo Taco experience was a \"Close\" sign at the door. I guess that qualifies them for a one star review (I went there but they were closed: one star). I am just glad I kept trying because the food is pretty good.My favorite Coyo meat is the octopus, which is always well made, either in a burrito or a taco. Of the tacos, I like the shrimp tacos, which are crunchy and really good, and the duck tacos, which have a lot of duck fat and skin. I also like the grilled fish tacos, fresh and tasty. Sadly though, I think the cochinita, the staple of taco meats, is kind of an afterthought. Actually, many things run a little on the three star territory because even though the meats are cooked correctly, flavor may be lacking. Not always though, sometimes.But what I really enjoy here are the sides. The guacamole is tops, for example, and let me give a shout out to the Virgencita de Guadalupe. Thank you Virgencita, we have elevated our guacamole standards in Miami and we eat freshly made guacamole, with fresh lime and jalape\u00f1o peppers. I also really like the green rice and both types of beans (black and pinto). I could just get the green rice and my choice of beans, and drop the taco meat over. Coyo's ambiance is pretty cool also. I think tacos are meant to be eaten standing up, but I don't mind sitting inside, sharing the space with strangers in the humongous communal table. I get to meet strangers, talk about food, share stuff. It's always fun at Coyo.The assortment of spicy sauces is great. If you like some hot sauce on your tacos, this place won't let you down. They have some really spicy stuff.The service is pretty good, the cashiers are able to take orders correctly despite the heavy slurring of words, and the food comes out very fast and is delivered to the correct table. Coyo almost feels like a fast food restaurant because... that is exactly what it is: tacos are Mexican fast food!And don't forget to get some churros. Really good stuff. There are paletas available, but I haven't tried those yet.Overall, Coyo Taco is a cool place to grab a decent bite in Wynwood. If you don't want to have a sit down meal, and don't want to hit a food truck, Coyo is your go-to place. Plus, tacos are light and a great night snack. Burritos are the opposite.By the way, check out the Tequila bar. Actually, ask about it."], ["Sandra G.", "If you're looking for a variety of tacos you have to come here. There are so many options! The tacos were delicious! I had the Pastor de pollo and Alambre.The only bad thing was the line to order. (1st red flag this place was going to be good)"], ["Catherine L.", "Wow oh wow! Freakin deliciousness right here. I'm going to break it down really simply.PROS:Tapas style: go with company and order different tacos. Each order comes with two. One for you and the other for sharing Margaritas: reasonably priced, refreshing, perfectly spikedTacos & Guac: ridiculously tasty! We ordered 4 different kinds all were awesome!Beer: nice & cold bottle or draft CONS:Space: Tiny as hell. There is outdoor seating but can get unbearably uncomfortable. Please put a fan out there. Insects: lots of flies outside due to trash cans not having lids. An easy solution is get lids or set out glass or plastic clear pitchers of water away from seating to attract the flies. Cost: kinda pricey for two small tacos. We got 4 orders of tacos, a order of guacamole with chips, a margarita, Mexican coke, two beers, $63 ( ouch and that's with the 10% disc for checking in) We'll be back but just to snack to grab some refreshments"], ["Julie L.", "We're from out of town, but had heard great things. We came by for lunch. It was busy, but not too packed. We easily found a seat outside. We tried the duck, pork shoulder, and octupus. The duck was the clear winner, but the pork and octupus were great too. Octopus was a little chewy, but still unique. Great food, good outdoor seating, and delicious margaritas. I'd come back again and again!"], ["Indira M.", "Excellent tacos. The best are the carne asada and cochita. Definitely recommend the Churros too."], ["Chris M.", "That burrito was ****ing amazing. You get to choose the 4-starred word. It doesn't even need to be a cuss. Inspiration? Consider: Dilf.I got the Pastor al Pollo taco converted to a burrito, with jalape\u00f1os. Really delicious.I will confess that there was an eye roll and a bit of exasperation when I asked for the jalape\u00f1os, but that kind of service seems to just be a Miami thing, so, I'm not taking a star away. I mean it was hot, I wouldn't really want to be taking burrito orders either."]], "Cantina La Veinte Miami": []}
