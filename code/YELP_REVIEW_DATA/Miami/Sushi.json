Are you craving some friend rice or a burger? Well then this place is for you. The ambiance is pretty great - there's a large outdoor seating area, and the tables inside are romantic with white tablecloths, candles, and dim overhead lighting. We were also served quickly and everyone was very polite.As far as the food, the sushi was just OK, but if I came here late at night after going out - like the girl outside sleeping on a table, I would have probably been far more excited about it (for a while)."], ["Ute L.", "Delivery order was disappointing. It took 1.5 hours to get the food, and my $18 crazy salmon roll was so small, I couldn't believe it. Granted, the roll was tasty, brown rice nicely cooked and it looked pretty, but it was literally a kid's portion. Needless to say, I was still hungry. An $18 roll should definitely fill you up. Even Zuma maki rolls are larger than theirs and cost less. The spicy tuna roll was a much better deal, same size roll, still small, but $8.00. I may give them another shot, knowing to stay away from the expensive \"special\" rolls and stick to the basics."], ["Michelle O.", "Nove is just AWESOME!!

She was knowledgeable and was just a pleasure to work with. Jerry was helping us out as well and he was great also especially when my phone died and I needed a charge.

I had also asked for brown rice, which the waitress repeated back to me, but it came out with white. I didn't send it back since it took quite awhile to be served. We were really hungry when we ordered, but it took about 20+ minutes to get our edamame, along with everything else we ordered. Everything we ordered was served at the same time :/Of the entire experience, the best part was our waitress who was very nice and attentive. I wish I could remember her name.

Decor inside needs a little improvement. Didn't care for the dark red walls, in my opinion lighter color would improve the appearance and make it look more spacious. Outside sitting is nice but it's already too hot for now. Fried rice is a must try, huge portion, was enough for the 5 of us. Spicy tuna Bon Bon looks like a great masterpiece and if you don't know what it is you will assume it's heavenly desert. Spicy crunchy tuna is awesome. Spicy edamame is great too. All portions are good size for sharing."], ["Van M.", "I can't remember eating such shitty sushi let alone food in a long time. I had no idea why people kept showing up to this place as the night went on. They weren't even there to watch UFC! My only guess is that floridians have no taste. Even the soy sauce tastes weird. They bought the cheapest soy sauce to serve people. It was like brown water. I'm sure the packaging cost them more. The ginger had some off sour taste to it. Thank god I ordered cooked sushi be im preggo. Cuz it tasted a bit fishy (and bland). Imagine if it was bad raw seafood! I would prolly spend today on the toilet! The restaurant itself looks like an afterthought of extra hotel space. The inside is a narrow space with a bar. The outside is a cordoned off wide sidewalk. The only good things were that service was great and they were the only place within half hour of Miami beach that showed UFC (and without cover!)."], ["Pamela G.", "Just loved it!

I also ordered the crunchy crab salad which was terrible. No taste. I usually eat that salad at Sake Room and it is amazing. I would just go to McDonalds if you are hungry at night and avoid during the day.Update: I left all the crunchy rice in the plate and I ate about 1/4 of the crunchy crab salad. If the manager cannot tell that I didn't like it then I don't know what to say. Is it normal for people to leave almost all the food they order and not take it to go? With the crunchy crab salad the chef could at least take it out of the fridge a bit sooner so that is not refrigerator cold.

Unfortunately the rest was oily salmon, or I think thats what it was because I didn't see it since it was covered in some of their house sauces.This roll was a complete ripoff, and it was just gross.

I read some good reviews and I thought, \"Why not!?\" Well, my experience here showed me exactly \"Why not\"... I am not sure if anyone else feels this way, but, when I approached this place I was so confused. All the tables in the patio are scattered everywhere and you have to walk through peoples tables to get to entrance of the inside part of this restaurant. It just feels too crowded and it wasn't even a busy night. While me and my friend were making our way through the maze of tables and pushing in empty chairs out of our way to get to a host to seat us down, the manager or owner asked us if it was just us two. It was so he asked if we'd like to sit in the table that was right in front of us so we did. The table was wobbly but he came back and fixed it, he seemed nice but all went downhill from there.Not a soul came by our table for a good 15 mins... Not a soul. People just skimmed by us and no one offered us some water or asked if we'd even been helped... nothing. This is not good, I was starving! A man was walking by taking water to a table and we asked if he could please get us someone to take our order. A few minutes after, another man came and brought us some waters.A couple of minutes after that shows up our apparent server, a blonde young asian woman who seemed \"forced\" to serve us. Anyway, I ordered the coconut shrimp and their Crazy tuna roll. My friend ordered the Crunchy crab salad and The original burger. And, we ordered a spicy edemame which was free when we checked in with my Yelp app.The spicy edemame and the crunchy crab salad were the two best things from everything I had ordered. My friend said that her burger was really good though, I thought it was decent. She said that she especially liked its seasoning. The Spicy edemame is tossed in a japanese spice blend and it was great and smelled divine. That japanese spice blend smelled so great, it smelled like a well seasoned, garlicky burger. YUM! The crunchy crab salad was good too- it had avocado, green onions drizzled with spicy mayo and eel sauce. I really enjoyed both dishes. My rounded up 1.5 stars dangles on a string with the help of these three dishes and the potential that this place has. Maybe it was an off night, who knows?The not-so-great news... The coconut shrimp I ordered was not good at all. I love coconut and it was covered in so so so so so many coconut flakes that I had to take them off with my fork. The dipping sauce it came with didn't pair too well with the coconut shrimp, in my opinion. It was just all too sweet for me. My friend agreed so we set it aside and did not finish it. My crazy tuna roll was nothing special, really. It was filed with tuna and avocado and topped with \"spicy tuna\"... I didn't pick up on any spiciness at all. Our waters never got refilled and I am a big water drinker, but, our server just seemed to be paying attention to her other tables and really never stopped by to see how we were.

Friendly staff, always filled our water and acknowledged the presence of guests coming and leaving. 2. Expansive menu with everything Thai and Sushi you can think of and more3. $7.99 lunch specials. Haven't tried it but definitely sounds like a good deal and worth coming for 4. Red curry (I tried it with beef) was yummy and flavorful. Four stars. The curry sauce to dry ingredient ratio was too high for my liking; would have preferred more veggies/meat and less sauce. I felt like I was fishing through the sauce to get to the real food. 5. Seafood pad Thai: the pad Thai flavor was there but there was nothing special about the seafood part. I'll stick to regular chicken pad Thai next time. Other thoughts: 1. Our server was a sweet Latino woman, but she had no idea about Thai food and couldn't form a coherent answer to my simple question about the menu, \"how is Thai coffee different from regular coffee?\" I took my chances with her nebulous answer and ordered it anyways.2. The Thai iced coffee was strong but WAY too sweet, like a tub of dulce de leche dumped into a Starbucks frappucino. I promptly entered a hyperglycemic coma thereafter. Maybe ask your customers for the level of sweetness they prefer? 3. Our tables weren't cleaned properly when we were seated, there was still sticky residue everywhere, which we requested to be cleaned.4. They charge $1 extra for brown rice. Rice at an Asian restaurant should always be complementary if you ask me. 5. Service was incredibly slow considering the restaurant was more than half empty with only 10 tables occupied. We waited about 30 minutes for our dishes to arrive.6. There's an incredibly creepy parking space in the back of the restaurant, especially at night."], ["Davis M.", "I truly enjoy this place.

Cities are filled with such restaurants, the cuisine is varied enough for people to feel like warlords over their niche within thai cooking, and there's so much to love there's a lot at stake. Miami is filled with sushi/thai places that are all overpriced, usually do passable sushi & thai without doing either exceptionally, and have overblown atmosphere involving some combo of cocaine-fueled decorating, offensive sexualization of the wait staff, and bad club hits drowning out any potential human contact. Siam rice lays low the barbaric hordes of food trucks clammering at the gates to sell their drunken foodie fare. Firstly because it feels like a proper restaurant. People get off work and either sit or grab take out. You don't wear some crazy get up to go here. No one bothers you constantly or invents weird contraptions for your crumbs. This is a place where you eat, enjoy, and talk with friends. It's mindblowing that something so simple gets botched constantly so often in Miami (perhaps because the obsession with wealth reached such tragic proportions here for too long). Then the food is amazing, across the board. Their thai curries are rich and flavorful, but don't taste run of the mill. I can't put my finger on it, but they have their own unique touch. The softshell crab curry, when offered, is simply amazing! The combo of crunchy, creamy, spicey, and all the cooked roots and vegetables will give you good dreams. My favorite for noodles is drunken noodles and pad woo sen. You don't see pad woo sen that often (glass noodles with assorted vegetables) and theirs is delicately balanced with crisp fresh veggies. All their soups are great, but I have affection for getting their chicken rice soup when sick. I don't have enough space to talk about their peanut sauce, appetizers, duck, or whole fried fish. The sushi too is great from rolls to nigiri and sashimi. Generally I order the chirashi (sashimi on a bed of rice with some veggies) because it's a deal and because people who order chirashi usually do it for the fish, so you get fresh tasty fish. The fish is juicy and melts in your mouth. I've never eaten what I didn't think was quality there. The prices are not low, it's miami's overpriced environment, but cheaper than all the surrounding thai places (upper eastside, miami beach, downtown). The portions are ample. I usually have enough for lunch the next day. This is my favorite thai place both in terms of taste and comfortable atmosphere."], ["Adalberto M.", "Grabbed a bite to eat during lunch on a Friday.

The teriyaki bowl had like 2 table spoons of rice, the teriyaki shrimp seems straight out of a can, the JB tempura roll had the most discussing salmon (frozen + old + pure fat) and to top the night off the dragon roll was practically almost all rice and cream cheese.

I love the P1, its great for two people because they literally give you exactly two of everything as far as a la carte sushi and then you also get an 8 piece California roll and an 8 piece tempura JB roll, what more could you ask for?? Priced at $29.95, it's a bargain! They also have mochi for dessert (my fave) and they sell authentic iced oolong and green tea.

They were pretty good, even though I thought eel would have a strong flavor.All in all, If you're looking for fresh sushi within a budget and no frills and you're sick of the stinky product coming out of Iron Sushi in downtown, this is your place. \u00a0This isn't a sit-down place, but a delivery/takeout place so don't plan to come here for a date. \u00a0Do order, bring your date home, watch a movie, and eat instead, though, for a personal, romantic experience. \u00a0I'm glad I have a place I can order sushi from whenever I crave it without risking food poisoning or breaking the bank."], ["Lia P.", "Let me preface with saying- I am NOT \u00a0a sushi snob.

The miso mussels and ahi poke are my favorite and they have happy hour daily which makes it even more fun to come and play here. They have lunch happy hour and dinner happy hour EVERYDAY! You can sit outside even though the chairs suck! As there is no way you can sit properly they are too low and the back of the chair is too far back which= uncomfortable. I just stash my purse behind my back to give me padding. Another hiccup is the loud obnoxious music brother Jimmy's blast where you have to kinda yell if you are seated outside and trying to have conversation. The service was great and they cleared plates right away and kept asking us if we needed anything else. The waiter also did another round before happy hour ended to see if we need anything else- good looking out and if you check in on yelp you get free edamame.

I had ordered lunch there a few days previously for a staff meeting for delivery, \u00a0and everyone really enjoyed it so I asked my husband if he wanted to try it. \u00a0It's like a little hole in the wall with a really cute patio area outside that appeared to be clean and had cute patio lights. Perhaps in the winter or spring I'll try sitting out there. We ordered the dragon roll, half, to share (my hubby and I) and it was plenty! Fresh and delish. Then we each ordered chicken teriyaki with steamed rice and it was really tasty and portion size was plenty. \u00a0For dessert we had the Thai donuts and they serve enough for 3-4 people. They were delightful and not \u00a0greasy at all. \u00a0Service was great. Very attentive and quick.

It was between 5:30 and 6 on a Friday night and we were the only people there. That made me a little nervous, but my wife pointed out that they had just opened for dinner. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, we ordered Gyozas, Tuna Tataki, and Salmon Usuzukuri for starters. \u00a0All three were perfect especially the Gyozas. The salmon was fresh and buttery. \u00a0Meanwhile, we ordered the West Miami Roll, 1/2 Divine Roll, and 1/2 Sea of Love Roll and child's chicken teriyaki. \u00a0My son really enjoyed the Gyozas to the point of getting extremely upset when they were all gone. \u00a0Fortunately, the staff was patient and maintained their attentive service. The rolls and chicken teriyaki were presented just in time. The West Miami roll was delicious and unique, and I wish we would have ordered the full size rolls for the other two. \u00a0We really enjoyed our dinner that night. On a side note, while we were dinning, a lone female patron entered and was greeted by one of the staff. He politely asked her if she was picking up a to-go order. \u00a0This made her very upset because he wrongly assumed that since she was alone she was not dining there. She continued to have a poor attitude as she was rude and obnoxious for several minutes even after ordering her dinner-for-one. \u00a0 To my surprise, the staff remained very professional with her.So, based on our first and only visit, Sakura didn't disappoint and earned a 5-Star rating. \u00a0Sakura will now be one of our go-to places."], ["Emmitt M.", "No other restaurant serves such authentic sushi.

Every time we go there, we try something new and are never disappointed! The food is great, and the price is even better. For sushi, the best deal you will get in town by far. Some of the specialty rolls are $15+ (pretty standard for Miami), BUT they are HUGE. At any other sushi place, my boyfriend and I can easily take down 3 rolls together. Here, we can never get through the whole 3. Kind of a bummer, because the food is always so delicious! In addition, some of the rolls can be ordered in half portions, which is nice if you want to try out something new but don't want to commit to the full roll. As others have mentioned-the service isn't spectacular, but I've never been disappointed either.

While we were waiting, I noticed that there was an outdoor seating area and asked if we could move outside. We did but the waiter never even placed a votive candle on our table so we were basically dining in the dark with only the glare from the TV they have lighting our food. I kept expecting him to get a damn candle but he never did. Food came, I ordered the west miami roll and as I was eating it, all the rolls kept falling apart. Even some of my boyfriends \"sea of love\" rolls were falling apart too (I know how to use chopsticks) it was very frustrating.

The restaurant is family owned and operated, and most of the employees are related to each other. We tried out their delivery recently, and the sushi was still cold and fresh when we received it -- which doesn't always happen with other places in hot and humid Miami.Overall, this is one of my husband and I's favorite places to go out for dinner. One tip: If it is nice out, sit outside! The one disadvantage to this place is that the acoustics on the inside make it rather loud when it is crowded -- more than you might expect. There are fans outside, and the service is just as good. So enjoy the weather we all live here for!"], ["Orlando L.", "Food is great but it's sad that the experience is ruined by the male server Juan Carlos.

For dessert, we shared the banana tempura which I must say, it was the best I have ever had in a very long time, congrats to the chef for that.

Finally, some real good sushi in my neighborhood...but I was wrong. Decided to suggest this place for a long time coming girls night reunion with very good friends of mine. The place was empty! I figured service should be good since there were only 3 tables seated, ours included in that count. We ordered some appetizers and waited...and waited...and waited. When our hamachi Kama finally arrived it was raw. Some parts were cooked, but for the most part, just raw. So we waited...and waited...and waited some more for the return of our server and when she finally returned, she gave us the ol' I'm sorry and walked away, not even offering to have the dish fixed. After two other failed appetizer attempts, we decided we shouldn't risk it and should cut our losses and enjoy another place in Brickell to salvage what was left of our girls night dinner date. Once again, we waited and waited and waited for someone to bring the bill. Finally they did and we waited some more for someone to pick up our payment and when no one arrived we just left cash, with the tip for our invisible server, and took off only to be chased by someone other than our waiter yelling, \"where's the tip?!\" From across the street as we headed to another location to eat. Of course, another server had already picked up the bill who noticed him yelling across the street at us and prompted him to stop since the cash had already been collected, again, with the tip we left for our invisible server, whom we never saw again.

No where on the website said that it will take that long and nobody ever takes two hours to deliver food! That's unheard of! Specially when it comes to sushi!

It's a culinary experience that is very rare to find anywhere.I'm really surprised by the people that rate NAOE with lower than 5 stars with something like \"amazing, yet the price...\" When you factor in that they fly in fish from around the world, only serve about 8 people at a time, and provide world class service it's just hard to imagine that being inexpensive.Don't get me wrong, it's expensive. Really expensive, but this isn't a place that you come to as a regular. This is a place that I wouldn't bat an eye if someone told me they booked a flight specifically to have this experience. It's genuinely that good.I've indulged. I now visited NAOE twice. They record the menu that they've served you so that the next time you visit, you won't have the exact same experience. Each time, we've started with a traditional Japanese bento box that has 4 dishes/sections along with an indulgent specialty miso. The flavors and textures that Chef Kevin pairs are amazing. After that, it was individual pieces of sushi. Every single one is like magic in your mouth. Slow down, savor and enjoy it. The second time we went they had created a larger prefix menu, so we were served extra dishes between the sushi. Pork jaw and snap peas anyone?Final piece of advise: sit at the bar if you can. Chef Kevin is an artist and by sitting at the bar you get to see a master at work."], ["Nikel M.", "ZzzzzZzzz...that's me waiting 3 hours as all my food is being prepared. Then every 20 minutes I get a little piece of some 'FedEx' next day air Japanese goldfish. The place is also really quiet like you are having dinner in your old high school science lab. Half the people in there are being sold snake oil and pretend that all the bells and whistles that's going into the dinner actually means it's worth the steep bill at the end. Plus the main chef definitely worked at Akashi which isn't a knock but he's no Michelin star knife wielding sushi master either. Don't fall for the hype!"], ["Kelly D.", "Exquisite. This place transcends the restaurant dining experience. Must start with the point of contention ... the price. This isn't cheap, but you are not \"paying for dinner.\" This is a culinary experience. It is almost like an evening at a museum and Chef Cory is the curator. You learn about foods you have never heard of, let alone tasted. As we left our dinner at NAOE, I realized I have never been to a restaurant that so satisfied my stomach and soul. Every course is presented by member of the cordial and informative wait staff. They explain everything on the plate, and why it is considered a delicacy - e.g. hello, fish liver! The wait staff were attentive without being annoying, and I almost considered coordinating some kind of after dinner nightcap with them! You have to make reservations via OpenTable well in advance, as they only have two seatings each evening for about 12 guests. I was surprised that some reviewers mention leaving NAOE still hungry. There is a ton of food for your money! Granted, it isn't pasta, burgers or the like, but we are talking about a 12-ish course meal, friends! Also, a sidenote: they are expanding! They just underwent some renovations in the main restaurant and they are set to soon open a lunch-time joint next-door! If you are somewhat of a foodie, into trying new tastes, and have the opportunity to splurge on a once-in-a-lifetime Miami dining experience, this is definitely your place!"], ["Agustina B.", "NAOE is a wonderful place if you want to go to experience high quality Japanese food.I love the staff there as they are very attentive, friendly and explains each characteristic and part of the food served very well. I love the taste and it opened up my eyes to different Japanese ingerdients like the fish liver(shocking, I know)I think it is a dining experience that everyone must try in order to know the true Japanese culinary essence and a new level of appreciation.I learned so many things in those hours spent there and not only that but I was so full. The money spent was well worth it and also. The only downside is that I've waited for a long time to get this reservation. There are tons of people waiting to get in and I've waited for at least a month. Overall, I highly recommend NAOE for that satisfying true Japanese experience."], ["Alex V.", "We had dinner at NAOE a few weeks ago while vacationing in Miami and it was one of the best dining experience I've ever had in my life, if not the best. We picked this place based on the rave Yelp reviews and Chef Kevin did not disappoint. The sushi was the best I've ever experienced, and the level of service was beyond compare. It was an experience and an education."], ["Brenda P.", "I was ecstatic about this day and it could not come fast enough. We received a phone call the day before with instructions on how to find it and where to park. They said to make sure we park in the garage because if not we would get towed. They also said our ticket would be validated. The restaurant facade has no signage. It's just a typical glass door with the address number on it we were told.We did as told and found it all easily. Walked in a couple of minutes before 6 and got escorted to our table right away. There are two seatings: 6:00pm and 9:30pm. Each one with 8 people each. You are told you MUST get there promptly but people were still strolling in at 6:15 and 6:20 (gotta love Miami). The place is small, quaint and mostly in grey with dimmed lighting and classical music playing. There were two hostesses working the room. We placed our drink order (beer) and waited. And waited. It is my impression that they wait for all of the diners to show to start the dinner progression together. If that's the case then this was one of the reasons I was sitting there starving and the first course did not arrive until 6:30pm. It's not like most restaurants where you have some bread or something to munch on. There was nothing. We had unfortunately skipped lunch so we were starting to get irked when the bento box finally arrived. That's the thing with NAOE. Everything is made on the spot and beyond fresh. Some of it, still swimming that morning or alive minutes before Chef Cory starts prepping it. That's a big part of the wait in the beginning and the wait we experienced in between courses. This is when I regretted not sitting at the bar. If you are at the bar, you are watching him prep it and it's more entertaining. With the dim lighting, classical music and long hauls in between there were moments that I started yawning! The bento box was good. I cannot begin to pronounce or write everything I had that night but it was all very interesting. To me, the real stars came in the 8 pieces of sushi that followed. Each one is served individually and brushed with the Chef's own soy sauce recipe and actual REAL wasabi. A true delicacy. All of it. The first one was the salmon belly and I was instantly hooked. The problem was that it was so good, I wanted 5 more! roll after roll just confirmed that, yup, this was absolutely spectacular. The rice is also made in batches and usually hot when topped with the cold sushi. Amazing. The hype is real. My favorites were the salmon belly, Boston shrimp and the eel. When you are done with the 8 roll progression you then have the option to order additional rolls from an a la carte 5 option menu. That's when we chose the eel and the gooey duck clam. The clam? well she brought that one out alive to show us. Yikes! Kind of cool, kind of creepy all in one. She said they blanch it and then they shock it with ice water to prevent muscle spasms (which has happened in the past!). At some point she also brought out the mail certificate to prove that the fish that was flown in from Japan truly was flown in that same day. I guess people have requested this before? She also showed us a photo on a phone of it upon arrival. I have to say they really did go out of their way to properly serve us and explain everything in detail. Both hostesses were incredibly sweet and personable. The beer we had was the Asahi and the Ginga Kogen. They were both very good. For dessert they brought out a palate cleanser plate of fruit which was good but at the end of the day, it's just a plate of very fresh fruit. Then they brought out a combo of their honey cake and the mystery ice cream. I won't tell you what the mystery ingredient is of course!The honey cake is completely organic and made with only 4 ingredients. It does not contain sugar and uses the honey completely as the sweetener. \u00a0I could have had another serving of both. I also tried the Snow of Kaga which is frozen sake. It was very interesting! If you have it as a slushy it is really strong. Think nail polish remover strong. Once it melts it is heavenly. Was I full when I finished? No. I was satisfied. I would suggest you have a good lunch that day so that you can hold out for all the waiting in between \"bites\". Also remember to sit at the bar if possible. We paid, left and walked back to the garage. \"$18\" said the parking attendant. \"What? we validated our ticket, what do you mean $18?\" Apparently, it's $ 24 and this is the discounted rate. Well that was not a good ending. We paid it but I wish I would have known this was part of dining here. I did not see any street parking so this seems like the only option. You have been warned. Overall, NAOE does deliver exceptional food. You have to try it! I wish I could go back just for the sushi without the rest but it's a set menu. They have taken over the space next door and will be opening a new 16 seater place serving traditional \"cooked\" Japanese dishes. I will certainly be back to try that!"], ["Andrew A.", "What an amazing chef, staff and food ! I took my daughter for our annual father/daughter date plus it was my daughters birthday the big 20 !

Some of the new (or more recent) favorites included ika topped with abalone roe-liver sauce, konowata and karasumi.

Myumi definitely delivered.Even though I was excited about the concept (traditional omasake, usually a very upscale experience if you can find it here at all, served from a food truck) what blew me away was the amazing food. Everything is chefs choice, and it's all traditional nigiri. There's either a $40 or $60 option, but each piece is small so I can't imagine the $40 option being much more than a snack. We even ordered doubles of our favorites at the end. But back to the food...I had never even imagined any fish could be so fresh tasting. Every single piece just melted in your mouth. Aside from the exceptionally high quality ingredients, each piece had just enough of something else (whether it be from a sauce or garnish) to enhance the fish, not mask it's flavors. I had a couple favorites but realistically every course was excellent.I think after our second or third piece we were already thinking about how often we would be able to come back. I'm pretty sure I would eat everything they have in their truck if I could.P.S. They have a couple drink options like water and tea, but if you want to drink you can BYOB!P.P.S.

Parking is easy as they have spots available for youCons: have had omakase in quite a few places in the US and abroad and have to say the portion size should have been maybe 2 courses bigger. Also thought they could have expanded creatively a little more. I think the clientele searching out such a unique experience in Miami would appreciate pushing the envelope even more creatively.

She said I had to try it for her, and I'm super thankful to her for letting me know about it!I'm not too adventurous when it comes to food. Some people say I'm too picky, actually. So I was a bit hesitant that I'd like an omakase experience, let alone from a food truck. Luckily, there wasn't anything too out of the ordinary. What was outrageous was the taste! It is so amazing how much flavor can come from one sliver of fish!There are two dinners you can choose from: a $40 or a $60 experience. It's just more fish if you get the pricier one. He lets you start off with the $40, and if you like what you're eating and decide to keep going, you're allowed to move up to $60. Well, that's just what we did. After our first 2 pieces, we all agreed we were going to bump up to more fish. All pieces are nigiri, but each has a differently distinct taste. They all are imported from all over the place: Boston, Alaska, Japan. After much deliberation, I think if I HAD to choose my favorites, they would be the scallop and the tuna. It may not seem like a lot of pieces, but I honestly did not leave hungry. Sure it's a light dinner, and I wouldn't say I was full, but this truck boasts quality over quantity. Sushi chef Ryo is great at what he does. He and the owner are very friendly, relaxed, and comfortable. Feel free to ask questions, strike up a conversation, and learn about how Myumi came to be. (Fun fact: Myumi is actually \"my umi,\" which translates to \"my ocean,\" according to chef Ryo.)Don't let the price scare you away. I promise this is the best and freshest sushi you will find in Miami!"], ["Megan G.", "Would you ever consider eating Omakase from a food truck? \u00a0 My guess is not, but think again! \u00a0I was just saying to my husband the other day that Wynwood is missing some lighter fare, sushi in particular (I don't count Suviche). \u00a0And then BAM! \u00a0Myumi opens right next to one of my other neighborhood favorites, Gastropod. \u00a0We tried to eat there two nights ago actually, but since it was only their second night in business and we were a walk-up, we were out of luck; there's only 6 seats after all. And it being omakase (and they know how to do it right) they're doing seatings on the hour, from 8-11pm. We were able to make a reservation quite easily though, AND they were gracious enough to push it back, through a simple text message. \u00a0 They debuted this same concept in the Hamptons last year and, apparently it was a success. They're also working in conjunction with a restaurant called 1 or 8, in Brooklyn. Yelpers love it, anyone would. This place is legit. \u00a0Their fish is flown in fresh from around the world, much of it from Japan. They're using their NY ties to source fish not normally accessible to the Miami market. There's two options of $40 or $60 a person, so yeah it was a little pricey, considering it's a sit down food truck but you get what you pay for. Oh, and it's BYOB. \u00a0We brought two bottles of sake and were quite content. By the way, myumi means \"snack\" in Japanese. \u00a0You're welcome!"], ["Ian T.", "Myumi is an interesting contradiction: refined, high-quality true Japanese nigiri served from a modest looking food truck in a lot in the Wynwood neighborhood. I asked about this, and found out this is the brainchild of a New York restauranteur who recruited a young, quality oriented sushi chef from Japan -- an engaging young man named Ryo -- to create an omakase-only menu without \"fusion\" rolls and various Miami/USA concoctions. I was informed that the food truck format is almost a \"marketing exercise in consumer education\" to introduce and familiarize Miami denizens with the omakase concept and a world of nigiri without rolls or other items. If it's successful, the long term plan is for a permanent, interior-seating location.The result is a great, authentic sushi experience that's the closest to what you'd find in a good sushi bar in Japan -- or at least the closest that doesn't require a second mortgage for a night out. The tradeoff is that because the bar has only 6 seats (12 will be opening soon on the other side of the truck), and it's been in demand since it's recent opening, you are expected to eat and leave without lingering to make room for the next guests. Also be aware that despite it being a food truck, reservations are required.As with traditional omakase, each piece is crafted and placed on a receiving plate, where you lift it off with your fingers and savor it. You don't eat off this receiving plate, as you have your own. It also comes with ginger to cleanse your palette between bites, along with a small finger towel for your fingers between pieces. There's no bowl of soy sauce or wasabi here, as you are expected to eat them with the spicing and sauces applied by the chef.The $40 omakase comes with 7-8 pieces, depending on the fish that day used and market prices; the $60 version includes 10-12 pieces. Not cheap, but when compared to quality omakase elsewhere in Miami, it starts to look much better in terms of value. A key to the omakase experience is it's all 'chef's choice'. Also, they don't have a liquor license, so if you want sake or wine or whatnot, bring your own and they are happy to accommodate you.The sashimi-grade fish and other items (like Uni, aka Sea Urchin) comes from various places, including a significant portion from Japan. For example, we were told that local yellowtail wasn't used because the warm waters rendered them less fatty, so the flesh didn't have the required snap. And indeed, their fussiness regarding their product was evident in the taste: fresh, clean and redolent of the sea. Every item was very good to excellent. Particularly stand out to us were the Ikura (salmon roe), Uni (sea urchin from Alaska that was sweet and creamy), Big Eye Tuna and Amberjack. We are hoping they'll get their permanent restaurant soon, for as much as we enjoyed it, a food truck in Miami has some definite downsides. The first is that, while the evening we were there it was pleasant despite being beastly hot that afternoon, I can see this being a less than ideal experience on hot nights. Likewise, my wife had a few issues of having to trade getting some mosquito bites in the early evening in exchange for the excellent meal. They have citronella candles on the ground around the chairs, for what it's worth.Bottom line is it's recommended, an eye-opening experience if you've never tried Omakase style sushi service, and a tasty light dinner."], ["Michelle C.", "When I told my friends I was eating sushi at a food truck, every single person's reaction was \"yeah, good luck with that.\" But when I showed them pictures, they were all shocked and impressed. That's the kind of reaction you might expect when you eat here!Ignore the fact that you're sitting outside at a food truck in Wynwood. Focus on the fish. It's not just a fresh piece of fish on sushi rice--each one is seasoned differently with yuzu, ponzu, shiso, etc You won't get an experience like this for this price anywhere else in Miami. The one critique I do have is that the pieces of nigiri are on the small side, and even the $60 option might not fill you up if you've got a big appetite. \u00a0Greg talks to each person individually about how he and Chef Yoshida came up with this concept, and you can just hear the incredible amount of passion he has for sushi. It's really refreshing :) As others have said, $40 or $60 options, and remember to BYO beer or sake. I'm SO SO happy that Miami FINALLY has an omakase place that's on par with other major cities like NY, LA or SF for price, quality, and flavor!! I'm supporting these guys all the way!!

The initial service was slow, but in their defense, there were only four employees working here when we arrived and they did have a couple of people eating inside and a stack of to-go orders in process. While we were there, another four people came in to either place orders or pick up orders, so they were a bit overwhelmed. In my opinion, this is always better than walking into a restaurant for the first time, seeing no patron activity and hearing the sound of crickets.When we were finally tended to, we ordered four different rolls, a miso soup and an order of Gyoza. The food came to our table staggered and relatively quickly. Everything tasted very good and as another Yelper pointed out, they didn't skimp on the cream cheese.Pricing is very reasonable and they do a good job of keeping costs in line by skipping on things that other restaurants should take note of. You won't find a soda machine here, so soda is brought out in cans paired with a cup filled with ice. The cups are your typical red Solo type, which are inexpensive and disposable, just like the plates and plastic utensils that are being used. Soy sauce is handed out in small containers, versus having bottles out on the tables. I found it interesting that their credit card machine is actually a card scanning device attached to an iPhone. I had seen this before, but never in a restaurant. The interior of the restaurant doesn't have any fancy-schmancy furniture, either.This place is a low-key, single bay, strip mall location that focuses on serving great food at very reasonable pricing. My wife and I felt as though we were at someone's home, which was nice. I enjoyed the personal touch.In closing, I hope that they continue to do what they're doing and how they do it because they will continue to be successful and build their clientele. I also know that I will be recommending this place to my family and friends!"], ["Tony G.", "Thank you Yelp for another great place to eat.

Went with my family on a Saturday afternoon. They also delivery for a very small fee! I think $1.50 for delivery. I will definitely be returning as we love sushi, and you can't beat these prices! For dessert we got the cakes. The mango one was delish, I will try the rest at home asi left very full. Owner is very nice, came by to greet and check in on us. My only two suggestions would be: add kids menu, maybe white rice and chicken fingers, or smaller portion of friend rice? Have paper and crayons available for children.

It was good. Was it worth my friend running in the rain to the ATM? No, not really. Have I also mentioned that they do not have their soft or hard liquor license? That was a bummer because in the course of dinning here, it became monsoon season outside and we both really could have used some drinks to wait out the massive flooding in the area. Do I see myself returning here on my own? Not really. Cash only and unable to order wine does this place in for me."], ["Ashley J.", "Okay I read so many rave reviews about this place and I had to try it! First off, this place is a hole in the wall. You can actually miss it if you are not paying attention. They only take cash only and there is a sign on the door. They also tell you cash only before you order. So hopefully you don't end up eating without having any cash on you. I am sure there is an ATM nearby.It's really small here. Like really small. I don't think it's good for groups unless it's really slow and not packed. I got there at 2:15 pm and there were not many people there. Make sure to sit in the front instead of near the kitchen. It is extremely hot and you will melt. There is also a small table outside, but it's too hot out there ahah! They give you complimentary Miso soup while you wait for your entree, which is nice. The miso soup was really good. I was not sure what to order because this was my first time at an Indonesian sestuarant. I asked the waitor and he told me the Opor Ayam (chicken) was popular so I went with that. I sipped my soup and patiently waited for my plate. It finally arrived and I was so ready to dig in. It didn't take that long for me to get my food, which will probably different if it's very busy. Anyways, the dish was beautifully plated and I was excited to try. The curry was very flavorful and delicious. The only complaint that I had was that the chicken was a bit dry. Nevertheless it still tasted well with the sauce. If you're not in the mood to try Indonesian food, they also have sushi. I didn't try the sushi, but it looked very fresh to me. Maybe next time.Overall, the food was very filling and was not too expensive. I will definitely come back here since I go to school nearby. Hopefully I won't get there when it's packed!Bom apetite!

For $18 you can have a meal fit for a king. Oh yes, I'm referring to the Rinsttafel feast! There are more parts to this feast then I can go through (and the names are doozies!), but suffice to say you will leave full, smiling, and wishing you'd done some stomach stretching to fit more perfectly-seasoned food in!A few favorites within the feast:- The Asian Salad is out of this world. There are a ton of ingredients that shouldn't work together, but they do! We're talking strawberries and seaweed, people. Trust me- it WORKS!- Anchovy peanuts. Again- Huh?! Again- Mmm! They were sweet and also a bit tangy. I'm not sure how they related to anchovies but either way they were a hit and added a different texture.- The fish dish was all of our favorite of the spread. Indonesian food isn't spicy (which is great for me), but it packs in the flavors. Curries, smokiness, sweet, tangy- all represented in the feast. One big note- this place is cash only! I missed this fact and was glad my friends had the cash to spot me!I would definitely go back and plan to the next time I'm in town! Now to find a comparable Indonesian spot in Orlando..."], ["Vera W.", "Super tasty! Who knew Miami had good Indonesian food? Order the lunch special for 2, and you get to try a variety of dishes.

It was really delicious, little bit of spice but mild, so it just gracefully opened the flavours of the plate. Was surprised at the portion sizes, as even though i asked for a small version of the plate, easily could have been a portion for two! \u00a0The place itself is kind of small, unassuming, not fancy decorated asian style (not very knowledgeable about the specific region, Indonesia maybe?). Service was really slow, maybe because restaurant \u00a0was packed, or because i was seated at the bar, in a location that is hidden from the main tables and servers visual range, not sure, but at least \u00a0i had to wait 10 minutes to get my beverage and like 25 to get my food. I also asked for a vegetable hand roll and got instead a sushi roll. At that point was really hungry, so no damage there and just ate it.

Both of our dishes were delicious.Rendang Sapi - beef with spices and rice. \u00a0The flavors in this dish were explosive. \u00a0 \u00a0The beef was tender and juicy. The rice was very tasty. The salad that comes with this dish was very refreshing, light, and fresh. \u00a0 It had lettuce, carrots, onions, pineapples, \u00a0tomatoes and a delicious light sesame dressing. The dressing was similar to a vinaigrette but a bit sweeter. \u00a0I saw in the menu that they make this salad with chicken on top. So, this salad will be a good dish for the diet that I am always planning on doing...Laksa - shrimp (not fried), tofu, veggies, noodles and and egg in an amazing curry soup. It also comes with chips so i dunk them in the soup \u00a0 yum! OK so they have spicy sauces on the table that you can add to your dish (one red/ one green) \u00a0I tried the red hot sauce. It was hoooot so I mixed some in my soup and...boom! Perfect!! I ate it all and the portions are large so no diet yet. Can't blame a girl for enjoying \u00a0good food. I washed it down with a nice jasmine iced tea, which by the way had refills. I think I'm good for the rest of the day :) Overall, it was a great first experience.

I tried the nasi rames, which comes with a delicious appetizer salad with a light ginger-sesame dressing. The beef rendang was tender and tasted great in combination with the rice, salty duck egg and teri kacang (anchovies and peanuts). I was not a fan of the curry chicken that came with this dish, it was on the drier side and the curry flavor was too mild for my taste. I also tried belut bumbu kecap, which is a bbq eel dish that came with sweet and tangy pickled carrots and cucumbers. This is also one of their most popular dishes. For dessert I had the es campur, which is light and refreshing (kind of like the Indonesia version of shaved ice, though the ice was more of a crushed consistency). It was a little too sweet for my liking but I loved the gelatin and lychees. Our server said that their cocopandan is imported from Indonesia.

The photos actually make it look nicer than it is. Gordon Ramsay might have a kitchen nightmare just based on the state of the pleather benches and how crammed it feels.However, the food comes fast, it is tasty and inexpensive. Plates are large and ideal for sharing. I went the healthy route with gado gado. Heaping pile of steamed vegetables with delicious peanut sauce, sweet, sour and spicy all at the same time. They drizzle it with kecap manis (sweet syrupy soy sauce) and top it with shrimp crackers. The food appears to be authentic, but I won't know for sure until I return from my Singapore trip this summer.

We stopped by for lunch around 1PM and it wasn't too crowded.There are only a handful of tables so seating was a bit squishy but the service was pretty quick. They offer both a menu for sushi and Indonesian cuisine; the plates are large and ideal for sharing. A friend of mine tried their sushi which came out pretty fresh. I ordered the Ketoprak and immediately fell in love with the dish. It comes with vermicelli noodles, fried tofu, bean sprouts topped with a rich peanut, garlic, thai chili based sauce and crunchy shrimp chips. It's like a cousin of the Gado Gado, another favorite dish of mine. I added the green chili and garlic sauce that was self-serve on the table and it highlighted the garlic flavor even more.

It's a small place and a hidden gem in downtown Miami, would love going back there for our next meal. If you like exotic food, you won't regret eating in this place. The vibe, the decor is very authentic. I think all the food is prepared and cooked in the morning so thats why they use microwave to heat up your foodl, because there' s no way to cook the food from the scratch or have the ingredients ready once you are seated, as the Indonesian herbs/ ingredients and cookings are really complicated to execute. \u00a0The downside is they only accept cash and the parking is a bit difficult to find, you might have to walk a bit.

Bam!Now, let's move on to the real review, which is only going to be about their Indonesian food items, not their sushi rolls, or any other cuisine that they served. The first thing I noticed was that everyone who worked there was Indonesian. Extra points. I perused their menu, and found that most of the traditional Indonesian foods from various areas of the country were pretty well-represented. Extra points again.I started with the Soda Gembira (aka \"happy soda\") because I haven't had it since my last visit to my homeland, and the server forgot it. Oy vey. I had to remind him, and he was very apologetic about it, so I was okay with the delay.For food, we ordered the Chicken Satay, Gado Gado, and the Nasi Goreng Spesial which came with Fried Rice (duh!), Rendang, Opor Ayam, and other veggies. The Satay was cooked and marinated quite well, but we concluded that I actually make better chicken satay at home. The Gado Gado was sweeter than I'd prefer it to be and the vegetables not steamed as long as they should be, but the overall flavor was still good.The real test was with the Nasi Goreng Spesial, and they unfortunately barely passed. The Fried Rice itself was weird. They definitely made it with the wrong type of rice (was it sushi rice?!) because it was sticky and the texture was all sorts of weirdness. They also used too much sweet soy sauce. The Opor Ayam was relatively bland. The Rendang was their saving grace as it was tender and flavorful.In terms of authenticity, they would get 2 stars. Comparing them to other Asian cuisines that I've had in this great nation, they would get 4 stars. Comparing them to other Indonesian restaurants that I've been to in this great nation, they would get 3 stars.

I've been coming to this restaurant since I was little, and it's a hole in the wall in downtown Miami that has great, flavorful, satisfying Indonesian food (and sushi, though I tend to stick to the more traditional Balinese dishes since I can have good sushi in other places in Miami) for not too much money. There are always local Indonesians coming to this restaurant to eat the food, which is of course a good sign. Their desserts are also delicious and tropical and make you feel like you're being transported to Bali! The flavors are aromatic, and the textures are uniquely Indonesian. The staff at the restaurant is also wonderful! You can strike up a conversation with the owner, and the waiter, they're all very sweet. Definitely recommend stopping by and giving this place a go. You'll be coming back frequently."], ["Eve C.", "Bali Cafe has been on my radar for quite a while, but it took almost a year of working Downtown for me to finally get my act together and check it out. \u00a0And now I'm kicking myself for dawdling for so long!It was quite fortuitous that my coworkers and I all had cash on the same day, since we all know that Bali Cafe only takes the cold hard green stuff.Upon entry we were greeted kindly and given our choice of tables. \u00a0As luck would have it, we ended up sitting next to a table of regulars who were quick to jump in with helpful suggestions for us newbies to the place. \u00a0We started with the lumpia - a chicken and cabbage eggroll-type thing, topped with yummy peanut sauce. \u00a0It was quite delicious. \u00a0For our meals, 3 of us opted for the rendang sapi - shredded beef cooked with coconut milk and some mild spices. \u00a0My other co-worker opted for the grouper dish served in a chili-sauce. \u00a0Everyone was quite impressed with their dishes, and I wouldn't hesitate to order the same thing (or the grouper)The prices are pretty reasonable considering that you get soup or salad with your entree, and aside from the dish, you get a heaping amount of rice, and some nice veggies (with the rendang sapi, at least).The only reason Bali Cafe doesn't get 5-stars? \u00a0Cause they're cash only. \u00a0I understand a small, local business wanting to pass savings on to their customers by not paying fees for credit-card usage, but at Bali Cafe the prices aren't so low to make this acceptable, at least in my opinion. \u00a0But since I'm one of the few who regularly carries cash, I'll definitely be returning!"], ["Joselle A.", "loved that they have a lot of choices, \u00a0however, since it is my husbands first time to try Indonesian food he wanted to see how the food looks like first before actually ordering it. cash only payment. all on all, the guy who served us is so nice and i loved my soup and the serving is good for two."]], "Zuma": [["Mike S.", "Food amazing, check. Service amazing, check. Atmosphere amazing, check. You simply cannot go wrong here. Can't say more."], ["Kat P.", "I am writing this after my 2nd visit here. My first visit we reserved the private room in the back with a wonderful tasting menu that was amazing! The service was good and the food items I tasted were all delicious. \u00a0I am not a fan of raw anything so I cannot comment on that, but the sashimi looked fresh and everyone who ate it said it was really good. \u00a0On this visit, I'm giving it 4 stars because despite the good service, the kitchen took a long time to get the food out. \u00a0Even with great company, the wait was noticeable. \u00a0The tasting menu service lasted about 3.5 hours :-/.On my second visit, I decided to try the brunch on a Sunday. This is where it goes sour for me...When I went to put my name down for a table, the hostesses asked if I'd ever been to the brunch and I accurately told her no. She prompted another hostess to show me the menu. \u00a0It was not the menu she was trying to show me it was the price. Not that it matters but i was wearing linen slacks and a relaxed cotton top with sandals but let's just say I don't look like their normal demographic... Other guests here come looking like they rolled right out of bed in flip flops to high end couture...This wouldn't have bothered me so much if they had done this to any of the people before me or after me but they didn't ... Just me... I planned to meet a couple of friends so I went to wait at the bar and ordered a drink while waiting. \u00a0To add insult to injury when my friends came the hostess came and tapped me on my shoulder and wth a confused look she said 'uh, I think your friends are here.' \u00a0why is it a surprise that they are MY friends???My friends look like the normal demographic here ... So I guess it was a shock to her that I was with them. Rather, they were with me... I was over it and just wanted to enjoy the rare moments when I could actually relax and unwind with friends so onto the food!I ordered the $135 brunch and got the black cod. The cod was perfectly cooked but it was not my favorite. The others ordered the tiger prawn and the filet. The tiger prawn was by far the best dish of the 3! The tiger prawn is actually a generous portion and was shared amongst the 3 of us. \u00a0The mushroom rice pot that comes with the entree is one of the reasons I endured the contemptuous greeting I received. \u00a0I also ordered the sake sangria while the others just had the champagne. \u00a0The sake cocktail was watered down alcohol and as tasteless as it looked. Because I prefer a well-made cocktail, I ordered cocktails that weren't on the menu and paid extra for the drinks. My bill alone came out to $210 (not including the $23 I paid for the drink while waiting for my friends) which I fully expected and was not shocked by considering I've been there before. \u00a0Do I think the brunch is worth it? :1. The included drinks were run of the mill subpar drinks for the the price and quality of restaurant. 2. The entrees were amazing and are worth its costs.3. The buffet items are worth it if you eat sashimi and the cooked items were good but not excellent in my opinion. 4. The atmosphere is very social and energetic. \u00a0Everyone here is beautiful and is definitely a place to 'see and be seen'. The place packs QUICKLY so make a reservation or come when it opens like I did.5. Valet Parking is validated when eating at Zuma so this 'saves' you $30.6. Wait staff is quick and extremely nice and accommodating. \u00a0Didn't deal with any of the managers so couldn't tell you about them except that they looked busy all the time. Basically, if my friends wanted to meet up here again or if I was hosting anyone to the city who wanted to try the place out I would definitely go again. I wouldn't go out of my way to plan an event or meeting here in the future. \u00a0If I never came again, I I would be able to move forward with my life ;)"], ["Marti H.", "Mehhh. Fancy people.

Once you make it to the upper level, the mounted orchid display preps you for the hypnotic views from the balcony. Flashing lights, flashing lights! Miami is all around you when you step outside! Although we did not reserve a private room, our host offered this to us as soon as he saw my bride-friend. Wow! That's what I call setting the customers expectation. Not that a private room was necessary, because Zuma is massive! The exposed kitchen which can be viewed throughout the entire restaurant is truly what brings this place to life. Our private room was anything but a standard closed room. It was spacious, open to the main room though if we wanted we could close the door. There was another smaller group table in the same room that could accommodate a party of 6. Later in the evening another group did join our room and it was still spacious and comfortable for all parties. The real magic is in the food. The most exceptional sushi experience one could ask for. Presentation is everything. Everything! In life. The chef's here have that knowledge down pat. My sashimi was divine. Mackerel, Salmon, Halibut were exceptional. Every bite was followed by an oh my god to my friends. Their reactions were equally the same. A friend shared her scallops with me, just 1. I can't blame her because I probably would not have shared that one. It was remarkable! Even the most basic of items, the miso soup was perfection.Definitely a swanky place, so be sure to look your best. The service is so good, they anticipate your needs before you've even thought about it. Would you like to sample the Sake? It will compliment the \u00a0XZY well.

(lol, jk. Don't be offended!)The boy and I came here on a double-date with miss KC and mr Andy for the Miami Spice 2015 event. \u00a0Among the 4 of us, we ordered 3 separate \"Miami Spices\" and several items \"a la carte\" (or from their regular menu).If you're coming here for their Miami Spice 2015 event, here is the breakdown of the items we ordered:APPETIZERS+ Sliced Seared Beef - this has shaved truffles on it. What is not to like? Keep in mind 1 order comes with 3 pieces. (Small, but oh-so-delicious!) Total crowd favorite. NOTE: Our server kept calling this the beef tataki, so... if you hear it being called that, it's the same. :)+ Seared Salmon - the flavor on this was so delish. Would order again as well. (To reiterate, 1 order comes with 3 pieces.)The apps also come with a to-share option of daily maki. In our case, we had some kind of tuna roll, which was very juicy. The ratio of fish to rice is perfect. :) \u00a0(I hate when rolls are wrapped in a ton of rice; much prefer a lighter hand with the rice and a heavier hand for the fish ;)) For 3 orders, we received 8 pieces of maki. ENTREES+ Sword Fish - get this. The flavor is great. The only downside was that some parts were incredibly juicy, but as we bit further in, some parts were also drier. So the consistency of the fish wasn't the same throughout. Even so, we much preferred this entree to the....- Grilled Skirt Steak - Unfortunately, this came across chewy. \u00a0Crowd consensus was that the fish was better than the steak that night. However, the spicy shiso lime \"sauce\" that this came with was lovely and yum to dunk the sliced skirt steak into.DESSERTS+ Goma Waffle - this was my personal preference between the two desserts. \u00a0The waffle has a very distinct buttery flavor, which can be a little overwhelming (to me - at least), but the ice cream. \u00a0Let me just stop you and say... If they made this by the tub at Publix, I would purchase it. :) The miso caramel ice cream was SO GOOD. - Honey Yuzu Custard - This was a total miss for me. The consensus at our table was that it tasted like perfume. The sorbet was fine, but something with the custard and/or the \"honey?\" they drizzled onto it made it taste like I was eating perfume. :(From the regular menu, we ordered these items:+ Tuna/Salmon Tartare - can't remember if this is the exact name, but check my picture and order it. Seriously, order it. It is SO good. It also comes with some kind of fried rice cracker that you can put the fish on, and it's just... delicious. I would come back just to order this again. :) \u00a0There isn't much fish, but what there is, is delicious!+ Calamari - This was fried to perfection. Only downside (for me) was that it was kind of bland aside from a basic salt/pepper taste. I anticipated more oomph from Zuma with this dish in terms of flavoring. \u00a0Even so, it was delicious to eat ('cos hello, fried!), and we dunked it into other sauces from our other dishes. :)+ Rock Shrimp - Yum. But not as good as Zen Sai's spicy rock shrimp. Asked the boy if he preferred the calamari or the rock shrimp, and he said calamari. You get somewhere around 10-12 pieces (if you were wondering).+ Zuma Mocha Bamboo - GET THIS. This was so freaking good. Skip all the other Miami Spice desserts. Do yourself a favor - get this, inhale it, and don't forget to eat the bamboo stick (it's a cookie, people!). You will thank those of us who are telling you to eat it, lol. *duress* Haha.Lastly: My party sat in the lounge area, which we loved. Didn't have any issues with regards to the \"lower\" table. If you're like me and a total mosquito magnet, cover up your legs. I walked out with 5-6 mosquito bites (perhaps since we sat closer to the door that led to the outdoor seating area).And a quick shout out to the other reviewer who noted the \"untz untz untz\" music - LOL. Too true. Was a joke at our table, lol."], ["Nadia S.", "So... you know how there's always those trendy, see and be seen, celebrity hot spot restaurants you read about online? You go there and the food and service end up absolutely sucking... Yeah- definitely not the case here people. Everything at Zuma is on point.

Our server recommended the baby artichokes w truffle wafu dressing to complement our rib eye steak entree- excellent choice! I don't recall which sushi roll we got but it was so fresh and delicious.

For the 4 of us, we ordered:CalamariEdamameArtichokesSome sushi rollChicken wings28oz wagyu tomahawk ribeyeThe highlight of the dinner was definitely the steak.

Our waitress was amazing, super attentive and bubbly, she explained to us the courses will come out with some time in between, and every time they brought a plate to our table they explained what it consisted of.

Too much to describe- but If you want a sampling of their incredible \u00a0menu, worth the $$$$"], ["Marcus Z.", "I have been here multiple times and never get disappointed. The must have for this place is the black cod entree. It is super fresh and perfectly cooked, super tender and juicy, and the yellow sauce comes with it tastes delicious, more of a honey and wasabi sauce. The combination is mind blowing, one of the best thing I have ever had. The second recommendation from me is the prawn and cod dumplings appetizer. Unlike the usual dumplings I have had before that the chef puts chopped meat in the dumpling, chef here actually use both mashed prawn and cod and chopped ones, which gives both smooth and solid taste, definitely a must try.We also ordered pork belly skewer and spicy beef entree. The pork belly skewer is pretty good but the spicy beef entree is alright.Eventually comes down to the dessert, the lava cake is a must try here. I am a huge fan of chocolate, and the lava cake never disappoints. But one tip for ordering this is that because it is not on the menu, the chef won't start making t until you order, so it takes longer than usual for the chef to prepare. So if you want it, the best time would be when the waiter/waitress presents the last regular dish. In our case, we probably waited for about 20-30 minutes since we put the order.All in all, this place is 95/100, I took 5 points out for the service as the waiter/waitress is always kinda stone faced, not bad or bothers me that much, just not very personal considering the amount of the complimentary tips they put on the check. Oh yeah, remember they already put 18% on the check, add or not depend on your experience, but remember not to double pay."], ["N P.", "This is my favorite restaurant in Miami. I haven't had one thing that I didn't enjoy.

It's definitely very good, but not the place I'd go \u00a0to if I was particularly hungry or thinking about value (alas this is me the majority of the time). We all had the Miami Spice menu but I left not quite full and I had had Chipotle earlier in the day. That being said, the flavor and expertise in the cooking was exquisite. The tuna maki we had was the best tuna roll I've ever had..although I would expect that considering I generally don't get maki at high end places. I had the smoked salmon for my appetizer and it was delectable. My friend's sliced seared beef also looked extremely tasty..I ordered the skirt steak for my entree and the presentation was wonderful. The taste was great as well and the chimichurri/sauce provided a nice kick.Finally, I was blown away by the intense sensation of the sorbet. It was like nothing I've ever had before in that the tastes were multiple and layered. I had everyone else try the sorbet since they all ordered the waffle and they agreed. The custard itself was alright..I just really like sorbet and this one in particular was divine.The ambiance is great and it was packed for a Tuesday night dinner. Once again, I wish it was a bit more substantial, but the more you pay the more you want I suppose. We looked on at other diners' plates and yearned for them - proving Zuma definitely is good in and out of Miami Spice."], ["Kara P.", "I went to Zuma for brunch this past Sunday and it was nothing short of amazing!!! First of all, who doesn't like unlimited booze and food?! There was a variety of drinks to choose from for brunch - I tried the Japanese sangria and the lychee martini, both which were fantastic. For our entrees, we ordered the beef and salmon off the standard brunch menu, and both were very tasty. The rice hotpot that is brought to the table is absolutely delicious, but if you don't like mushrooms it's probably not for you. I honestly couldn't get enough of the the buffet portion of the brunch. Everything on the sushi bar and robata counter was fresh and full of flavor, and there was a wide variety of options. I only wish that I could have kept eating, but I was too full. The dessert platter that was brought to the table at the end of the meal was beautifully presented and everything on it was delicious. Ours came with mango and raspberry sorbets, some macarons, a couple of different cakes, and a variety of fresh fruit. I did see different desserts on other tables' platters. I'm not sure, but I think the items on the dessert platter might be a function of the number of people at the table as well as whether or not you paid for any of the brunch upgrades. I do wish there was a bit more chocolate on our dessert (others had chocolate dishes), but I will just have to ask about that next time. This brunch is definitely a splurge but it is totally worth it and I can't wait to go back!!"], ["Michelle B.", "Gorgeous food, tasty drinks and great people watching. I wish I was more up to date on celebs because a few of the women who walked in we're definitely famous but I couldn't put my finger on who they were exactly....We got the Russian fruit punch which was possibly one of the best drinks I've ever ordered. It was pretty big, usually drinks at trendier establishments are smaller. It was made with real blackberries (potential health benefits?)We also shared the sweet potato, the corn (on the spicy side) and got some miso soup and a spider roll. Sorbet for dessert. When you order a la carte it was honestly not as expensive as I thought it would have been from reading other reviews.

Everything was absolutely delicious, but my favorite was definitely the seared beaf with daikon and truffle dressing. I could have just eaten that and been perfectly happy.On a sidenote, the layout of the restaurant seemed cluttered and was difficult to navigate through the tables, but the food was awesome so who cares. There's also a bar with an amazing view on the pool level of the hotel and is a nice place to just relax and get over your food coma before leaving. I look forward to coming back and would recommend this place to anyone."], ["Kareena S.", "I had a wonderful experience dining at Zuma. My boyfriend and I decided to participate in the $24 Miami spice lunch. For starters we had gotten a soup and salad, they both tasted really good. But for the main course I got the skirt steak with a side of chimichurri sauce, it was so delicious it melts in your mouth good. Wow I couldn't stop raving about it. The other entr\u00e9e we had gotten was the sword fish. It was so tender and cooked to perfection. The portion sizes were a little small so we decided to order something additional off the menu. We had ordered the yellow tail roll and man oh man this was the best tasting quality sushi we've had in a while. You can taste the freshness in the fish it was so good. And for dessert we had gotten 2 off of the miami spice menu (forgot the names) but I love how creative and detailed each dish was. You get salty sweet crunchy textures all incorporated into 1 dish and my taste buds went nuts.

For apps, we had the garlic edamame, which was flavored generously and perfectly. We also shared a tuna tataki, which is one of my favortie plates in Asian cuisine. I probably could've ordered two more of these and just had it as my main meal. The tuna was fresh and the seaweed salad was refreshing.I had the Dancing Spider Roll, which has slices of tuna on top. I ordered it specifically because the tune tataki was so fresh, I just wanted more and more. I had a taste of my friend's Massaman Curry, delicious!! I almost wish I had ordered that one... I'm not even a huge fan of curry but it was very tasty and light. For dessert, we had the thai donuts and Ice cream tempura.

Everything arrived in a reasonable manner despite how busy they were. Most importantly, everything was absolutely delicious. I actually found their hot entree dishes to be way better than the rolls. It's not as though the rolls were not tasty, but they're not the best rolls I've had in Miami. Now let me tell you about that duck.. THAT DUCK. It was crispy, moist, juicy and just fatty enough. The basil leaves were fried to perfection. Crispy and not oily at all. It was sheer perfection. If I had only ordered that dish, it would be a 5 star review.Overall the experience was good, the food was very good and I would definitely come back."], ["Liane W.", "Had the mylender roll, which was devoured in like 2 seconds.

The shrimp was succulent - not overcooked at all. :) a bit pricy for the amount but yum!And last! Had the orange duck! Duck was crispy yumminess but I found if you didn't eat it with the rice, the sauce could be overwhelming. :')All in all a great place!

Spicy tuna salad was fresh, but sauce was gross and sticky-sweet (like crappy store bought salad dressing). Fried rice dish was ok- but just ok. The sushi rolls are simply trying too hard. Good sushi doesn't need all those bells and whistles, leave it plain and simple with clean flavors if you really know what you're doing. Don't drown it in sauce and tempura flakes. What's truly obnoxious is that for a \"sushi bar\" you can't even order regular sushi (nigiri, \u00a0sashimi, or maki) and are left to choose from their \"special\" frankenstein job of maki.

The rice was soft and the tuna must of been the size of a peanut. Lastly was the crab salad, which should be renamed, lack of crab salad. Pathetic.

To start we had the wahoo tataki and the snow roll and both were very good. The tataki had a nice crunch and great flavor. The snow roll was savory with a little bit of spice to it.

This horrible person tricked my friend and I into buying an entire bottle of sake that we didn't even like! He was laughing and smiling the entire time too. He must've thought this was a joke. We took the sake to go and gave it to some person walking down the street.As for the sushi, it was horrible. Bland, tasteless, and the rice was hard.

Small, intimate, sleek with an eclectic music mix and bubblegum pink lighting. Service is friendly and fast. Our Thai waitress was very helpful and even brought samples of their house lychee and mango sake, as well as their sticky black rice.We ordered the special maki roll she recommended, since they didn't have a sushi menu available. The roll was big and included three types of fish and not too much rice. The grilled snapper on the outside of the roll had an awesome charred smoky flavor and I loved the spicy mayo. So yummy, no soy sauce needed.The pad thai was friggin' awesome. Portion was big again. I loved it so much that I asked to have half of the platter boxed because I knew I would otherwise be a little piggy and eat the whole thing.The shrimp in ginger sauce was also very good and they didn't skimp on the jumbo shrimp either.Thai donuts for dessert again a bargain, for $5 they give you about 10 - 12 donuts, you have to share otherwise it's too many.

The fish all smells fishy which is not what you want at all. That's gross... Fresh fish should not have a smell ok! And worse the octopus is over cooked and watery ( I think they buy frozen \"giant squid\" and pass it off as octopus). Finally the sushi is subpar and smells very un fresh \u00a0and fishy.

Highly recommended, quickly becoming one of our favorite sushi places."], ["Rachael H.", "Came here this past week. Started off with the steamed gyoza. The dipping sauce was great. The gyozas themselves were typical of an sushi restaurant. I had the godfather roll, which came on a bed of seaweed salad. The seaweed was a bit over powering on the roll. My boyfriend had the unagi. Didn't hate nor love it. I would've loved to try the famous pineapple fried rice or the curry. The table next to us had ordered some curry and the plate was big enough to share so that's probably what is going to go down next time I go. As far as the interior goes, it's cute. Very third date chic. The parking lot is very easily missed to be warned that the restaurant is a little before you get to the light on 19th!Heads up, if you show your waiter that you follow Mr.Yum on instagram, you get one free sake or a free order of thai donuts!"], ["Cristina S.", "Don't be fooled by this restaurant's 8th street location.

I can finally stop looking. The special makimono menu is extensive (the website doesn't show all the options). Half of the rolls are light and the other half contain cream cheese or something tempura fried. Whether you like more simplistic or funky fare, you will find a roll you love. The chefs are never skimpy on the fish, but sometimes forget to splash the plate with the sauce from the menu description. Appetizer-wise: the crab Rangoon is AWESOME. The avocado cream sauce makes the dish. The raspa cakes (crispy rice topped with spicy tuna) are also pretty tasty. My boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice from the Thai menu. I thought it would be boring, but the rice was so flavorful and moist I devoured the rest of his plate. The waitstaff could definitely be friendlier. I felt as if I was inconveniencing the waitress. However, the food is so good that this factor does not deter me. Mr. Yum = Yummy"], ["Alexis B.", "Giving it 2 stars for ambiance. Very well air conditioned which i love.

I ordered the chicken satay to begin with, at $9 - it was okay, but nothing special. Then I ordered the crispy duck Thai salad. At $18, what a disappointment. The duck was chewy, definitely not crispy, gristly, and the dressing for the salad was so salty it was unpleasant. I was in a hurry, so I ate some of it, then brought the rest home and thought maybe it might taste better if I adjusted the dressing a bit at home. What I hadn't seen in the restaurant was how fatty and gristly the duck was, with not much meat at all, mostly fatty skin, gristle and a little tough meat. And there wasn't much of it.

Several customers were just standing around with dismayed looks. \u00a0Barely anyone in the restaurant had food on the table. Many of the people sitting down didn't even have menus or drinks. Waiters ran about carrying chairs over peoples heads in a state of disarray. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and found a filthy mess with cheap art on the walls. We sat in terribly positioned dwarf-sized table and waited and waited and waited and got ZERO service. A waiter looked at us like 5 times with the distant gaze of a zombie.

Are we a fine restaurant with nice table clothes and napkins in a higher end restaurant? K, I am confused. After reading all the great reviews we thought yes let's stop in for lunch.

Our waitress was excellent, very friendly, telling us about the lunch special roll's and giving suggestions. She alone deserves five stars. Well, I must admit I ordered the Lychee Sakatini and hubby had the pineapple sakatini. I was floored as it tasted just like my favorite place who makes awesome Lychee Sakatini's, China Grill. It was very good, could have drank five...hee hee So we decide to order an avocado salad and the lunch special roll. Edamame, was our appetizer. The menu has many options, but the prices were very high. Really, for this area and the style of the restaurant it did take me by surprise. We received our food, my salad was very good, hubby enjoyed his roll, the edamame was good as well. This is where the issue lies. We received our check for one appetizer, two drinks, a salad and one roll, $49, plus a $10 tip, $59 for lunch, wow! Yes, the food was fresh and good, no complaints but IMO, way way overpriced. Heck, you are not Sushi Samba. Service- Five stars Food -Three stars Decor- Three stars Price- One star We paid our hefty bill and hubby was still very hungry, we stopped and picked up a sandwich to satisfy him.

The Shumai was not the best I've had but still good. I recommend Sushi Rock in Fort Lauderdale for Shumai, their sauce pairing is much better. \u00a0The Pad Thai, again was good but nothing to write home aboutThe service was good. Nothing over the top. It seemed like they had regulars which they catered a bit more to. I'm really unsure of where I should talk about the presentation of the food but I think this falls under service.

And the palm trees and penguins were mighty adorable.The space was small yet spacious. Everything was very clean and put together.

Very oversold here on Yelp! I can only assume that this is being evaluated relative to the other \"business lunch\" restaurants available in Downtown Miami.

Nice but slow; at one point I had to wave down fairly vigorously our waitress although I think one other person was in the restaurant with us. She seemed to forget us since she was chatting and gave a very definite \"whoops\" once we caught her attention. In fairness, though, afterwards she was fairly attentive.The rainbow roll was small, fairly sloppily packed, and was less \"rainbow\" than: this piece has tuna and this one has salmon. No whitefish, hamachi etc. I'm not completely writing it off since the fish was acceptably (not exceptionally) fresh.The wife and I also shared a bowl of Tom Yong Goong \"Two\". I don't know what the two stands for, but it was thin and lacked the strong lemongrass flavor or kick you'd expect. So basically bland.The wife opted for the Thai Basil Sauce with tofu. It is listed on the menu as spicy. It's not particularly spicy. It was in fact fairly sweet. The taste was pleasant however. I will say it was extremely thin and watery.Also, for the prices, the portions are not great. The aforementioned sushi was quite small and the basil sauce was basically rice.

Three Musketeers: tuna, salmon, and hamachi. \u00a0Same problem with the rice, but still the freshness of the fish compensated for it. \u00a0Chicken Thai Noodles: chicken and angel hair like noodles stir fried with mixed veggies. \u00a0Overall, there is nothing too special about this dish. \u00a0It tasted like many other Asian stir fried noodles I've tried. \u00a0The chef even gave us another appetizer on the house. \u00a0I'm not too sure what the dish is called, but it has salmon, cucumber, and crunchy noodles in a sweet soy sauce. \u00a0A tad bit salty for my liking, but still good. \u00a0I enjoyed the different textures this dish offered and once again the salmon was fresh. \u00a0To top it off even more, complimentary ice cream shooters to end our meal.Overall, I definitely enjoyed the ambiance and service. \u00a0Did I mention the plating of each dish was very creative? \u00a0We had little egg penguins or veggie palm trees decorating each plate. \u00a0All edible, but just too cute to eat. \u00a0Nikko is really a hidden gem. \u00a0If you haven't tried this place before, don't hesitate and give this place a try."], ["Oded V.", "Been searching for an authentic thai restaurant in miami and finally found it.....great food, presentation, and service. \u00a0The only thai place in miami i would eat at....impressed.

The salad was a good size, the ingredients very fresh and the tuna perfectly seared. After that we shared a rice-less Yuzu Hamachi Roll (chopped yellowtail, scallions, sesame and caviar w/ yuzu oil dressing and shiso on top) that was delicious and surprisingly very filling (the rolls are big).Over all the food was good and well priced; however, the service and ambiance was lacking, which is what brings my rating down to a 3.

It was the first time I've ever seen a Latino-run sushi place. It was surprisingly busy, and we had to wait for a table, which is fine. There was a big table on a slightly raised platform, which seemed like it was a VIP table, and no one was sitting there. After standing around for a few times (and being asked several times if we needed help... nope, just waiting to sit) someone told us we could sit at the nicer table. A woman (presumably manager) later came over and said if anyone came in for that table, we had to move immediately and act as if we weren't sitting there.Really? \u00a0Really? Is whoever that is coming to this middle of nowhere strip mall sushi join THAT PRESTIGIOUS that no one can sit in their reserved table? We were fine, had a round of drinks, and a table opened up nearby that we grabbed. I ended up ordering the vegetable roll and a veggie roll (yes these are different, and yes, you sound stupid ordering it like that). The table shared a few bottles of sake, and we enjoyed ourselves. The food was fine, nothing incredible, but appealing. As we left, I noted that the VIP party had still not come in. All in all, its a decent sushi joint. Nothing out of this world, but solid food. The ridiculous attitude of the staff is what knocked them down a star."], ["Absolut C.", "This place was absolutely terrible. Strolled in on a Saturday evening, the place wasn't full, but we opted to sit at the bar thinking we'd get to see the \"sushi chefs\" masterfully create our \u00a0rolls. Instead we had an awesome view of the top their sushi fridge and disgruntled employees. Oh and the microwave, where they \"steam\" the edamame. I kid you not, the waitress placed the edamame in a container with water and hit the timer for 2 minutes. Shoot, I can do that at home. I didn't know there was a lazy approach to steaming... Robert Irvine would be appalled! We ordered \"steamed\" shrimp shumai, some individual pieces of sashimi and two lobster rolls, which was served with a goblet of spicy mayo sauce- no lie a friggin goblet! The roll left much to be desired, it was bland and was full of carrots.The shumai came after the sushi. When I asked a waiter about it he said, \"oh he said that order was just placed\". When I explained that it was ordered with the rolls, he said, \"oh well, it's coming.\"I just couldn't believe the service was so terrible along with the food. Usually, I luck out and it's one or the other. It's like one of those things you don't think are possible until you experience it first hand. We waited 20 minutes for water, which we had to flag down the waiter. The sad part is that the \"sushi chef\" told the waiter \"they need help\", and he just looked at us and walked away. To add insult to injury, there was a couple seated next to us after we arrived; they were promptly served water and drinks, their rolls graciously awaited them and were done way before we even ordered.

It sucks, and if you think you're cool because you get awesome service here, you have no taste buds."], ["Michelle S.", "I was in between a 2 and a 3 but finally decided the 2 was more fitting. \u00a03 would mean I'd come back, which honestly I may only because this place is walking distance, but with Go To Sushi around the corner offering solid affordable sushi and decent customer service, it makes it unlikely that I'll revisit. \u00a0Food was 'okay' and for the price and service, mediocre at best. Hubby had a spicy tuna roll and a jalapeno popper roll that were both tiny, I had a California which was no better than a publix roll, edamame and a Ginger salad that had just greens and was lazily tossed together. \u00a0Water wasn't refilled once and luckily I didn't drink mine so my hubby finished it. \u00a0The service was slow. Ginger and wasabi are apparently a luxury these days since none of the rolls came with it and we had to actually ask if it was available. \u00a0You'd think we ordered a complex meal to wait 45 min for their preparation. \u00a0Oh, and for some reason, seating is practically on the sidewalk so we got harassed by bums for money twice during our meal. \u00a0Overall, the food is not bad, but when combined with the portions, price, service and size, I'd make my way to any of the 7 sushi joints that are a few miles further."], ["Andreina P.", "I like this rest a lot.

We've ordered both nigiri, and sashimi a la carte as well as the plates for two. \u00a0Overall it was pretty decent sushi. \u00a0One night the shrimp threw me off enough that I didn't eat it but in Miami I expect sushi not to be perfect every day as their selection of high quality sushi doesn't seem to be that great. \u00a0And my only other complaint is that person preparing rolls on the 3rd night seemed a little amateurish, unfinished sushi roll showed up missing ingredients and very loosely arranged. \u00a0Soggy, sloppy sushi isn't what one expects of Japanese food when they are dedicated to excellence. \u00a0So that makes it sounds like the experience sucked. \u00a0It doesn't mostly b/c I've had to adjust my expectations of sushi in Miami as compared to LA and NYC. \u00a0I was more impressed with the sashimi than with the nigiri in terms of cut and presentation. \u00a0If you go rolls try the Buena Vista and Chipotle Salmon. \u00a0Interesting interpretations. \u00a0 The dumplings are pretty good as well. \u00a0 We tried the Tom Yam Soup, also great. \u00a0Tiny for the price since I'm used to getting a large bowl rather than a small miso-style bowl for this dish but a solid yummy on the soup.Decent selection of cold sake too. \u00a0That's hard to find.Overall it's our go-to for sushi when in the Design District/Upper Eastside area. \u00a0As compared to similar style food choices in the area, for sure this is better than what you can get in Midtown or in the Upper Eastside."], ["Connie K.", "came here for lunch with my coworkers. it was basically empty around lunch hour. the decor is super trendy and chic. the parking situation is horrible. there's basically no parking and you have to park on the street where there isn't a real spot to park in. the food was ok. standard sushi, nothing special. around $15 for lunch."], ["Emily D.", "The food is good a bit over priced for the size of the portions. \u00a0The spicy tuna crunchy roll taste really good but its 3 bites and left us wanting more and cost $12.

Could've easily been Publix sushi."], ["Ute L.", "Shokudo may not be the cheapest when it comes to Asian fusion restaurants, but their food is consistently great or good. They seem to get a lot of take-out orders, which can slow down the flow of food to your table. I really like the cozy dark interior, and the staff is friendly and helpful.The sushi rolls are the most reasonably priced on the menu just over $10. The Buena Vista Roll with eel and crispy salmon skin had some great crunch to it. A favorite appetizer is the Momo- steamed dumplings filled with yam puree, served in a tomato sauce. Sort of a Tibetan version of Ravioli. We opted for the daily specials: Grilled octopus with sweet potato puree appetizer and spicy Hunan lamb with stir fried noodles and veggies. The octopus was perfect: tender, great seasoning and crispy char. The only complaint I have about both octopus and potato puree- there wasn't enough of it. $14 seemed a lot for the portion size. The BF really liked his spicy lamb dish, and believe me, he is picky when it comes to meat, or food in general. For $20 it was a generous portion with a good amount of lamb. In general, they know how to season and grill their proteins here, so kudos! For dessert, I absolutely loved the coconut pudding. It's served parfait style, with pudding on the bottom, a layer of brown sugar soaked soft bread, topped with a pile of whipped cream and coconut meat. Reminiscent of Tres Leches, only better.The banana spring rolls were a miss. They were ueber hot in the center, almost like they'd been microwaved, puny and the spring roll skins were dried out and hard, not flaky or crispy as they should be. Definitely not a $9 dessert, maybe $4 if you're feeling generous. Will know to stay away from that next time."], ["Maggie A.", "Phenomenal food, service and ambience.At first, I was slightly intimidated by the truly authentic nature of the menu. This is not your typical pad Thai/ California roll joint like I was expecting. I had no idea what to order to really see what this place has to offer. Our server Nicole created a tasting menu paired with sake (Shunsetsu!) that left me in awe. Grilled octopus, Korean ribs, beyond fresh sashimi, poke, the best curry I ever had.

They have a nice outdoors area, but our table was really wobbly so we decided to move inside and enjoy the AC. Food was mediocre. I got the spicy seafood noodles which were ok-nothing amazing but my friend's ramen noodles were way too salty. Portions are really small too.

They all took care of me as my friends trickled in one by one. Eventually it was time for dinner and that's when our night took a turn for the worst.I don't believe we had a large party, there was about 8 of us. A large group is something that a restaurant on a Friday night should be prepared for. But, it seems they were not. The waiter took forever with all of our orders. From our drinks, to our food, even to our checks, everything took forever to come. I even had to get up, walk to the bar, and ask the waiter where our checks were because my party was getting annoyed and wanted to leave. The food was just OK. There was nothing really special about it. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, but the service seemed to really bring down the night.

Now I have been here a couple of times before and have actually enjoyed the food....although it did suffer from that hipster server malaise of indifference that you sometimes experience in Midtown/Design District restaurants. \u00a0Came here for a little holiday get together with my office and we scheduled it at 2:30. \u00a0We actually arrived at 2:00, but was informed at the restaurant that they close at 3 pm. Kinda have to question why it was that they would have allowed reservations for a large group a half hour to close, but that comes into play later. \u00a0What set the tone for the disappointing meal was the server, who was curt and aloof and suffered from a severe case of the hipster malaise described above. He took our order and disappeared for a while after dropping off some apps, not checking on refills etc. Main meals come, but not all at once with several hot food items going cold, while folks in my party wait for other to get their food. \u00a0However, what was really disappointing was dessert. \u00a0Since they closed at 3pm, the kitchen closed down, even though customers are still eating and ordering. As a result our dessert choices were limited and we end up ordering the three available desserts, one of which was a warm chocolate torte. It was warm alright, but you can tell it was microwaved to death. It was so over microwaved that the torte was hard, dried out, and completely inedible. \u00a0When I complained to our server, he shrugged his shoulders and told me that it was supposed to be dry. Really? \u00a0Sahara Desert dry?----I call bull hockey pucks on that. He also didn't take it off the check. Not happy, but did not want to create a scene so decided to leave him a crappy tip instead. Another disappointment is that they have also removed some items off their menu, that I enjoyed in my past visits such as the Taiwanese Noodle Soup. \u00a0All in all, I am very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is taking and hope that my experience is an exception to the way they are now doing business."], ["Redblisspotatoes ..", "Great looking Japanese/pan Asian spot. \u00a0Stopped for quick business lunch.

Next we had the green curry and we almost did not finish it because we were just not into curry, it was very gingery and milky, the vegetables were fresh but the curry was just way too much in flavor, lastly we had the kalbi and it was a very juicy slow cooked rib, it had similar seasoning to the pork and was also very delicious. The service was kind of slow and there were only 2 waiters so it was hard for them to handle customers so we were there for 2 hours and a half. Be aware of the curry and the service but overall it was a good visit.

I'm not sure what the sauces were but the flavors were powerful and well balanced.We really enjoyed the Bacon and Shrimp Pad Thai. Bacon, as expected, can make a really great dish even better. Why don't more people add bacon to Pad Thai?For dessert, I was only able to eat the Flourless Chocolate Cardamom cake (due to gluten issues). I loved this thing! Cardamom is tricky to use as it seems to either disappear or overpower a dish. In this case, it was hinted at to change the flavor, but didn't overwhelm.Overall, it was a great evening.

We decided to share a desert- the coconut caramel bread pudding type thing (not sure the name). It was very tasty and not nearly as decadent or heavy as it sounds which was a nice surprise.

While the menu now has some more sushi options, and the prices are VERY fair, I wouldn't say that the sushi is very high quality or that the rolls are anything special. I was also a little put off by the fact that they give you soy sauce packets - instead of packing regular to-go souffle cups like most restaurants do for sauces. It's a small thing, but it made the meal feel a lot cheaper than it was. I know this isn't high end, but I didn't want it to feel like the supermarket either. I would go back - but I'm not in any hurry to do so."], ["Val G.", "I only had sushi rolls and a Sapporo Beer, I'm very pleased and plan on coming back again soon. Service was excellent!"], ["Allison F.", "Their food is fresh and delicious! I always get delivery and it always gets here quickly and the delivery man is super friendly! The tuna poke salad and the samurai roll are my two favorites."], ["Deborah Y.", "The food was very good, however, the spicy tuna tasted a bit paste-like. The chocolate tart was a bit bland as well.The pork gyozas were great though!"], ["edgar o.", "I been twice to this restaurant and both times I had a great meal experience.Any dish \u00a0with fish (sushi, sashimi...) has the quality of Zuma restaurant...but wait cheaper.It seems that owner is on top of the quality of the products. Service is good and outside tables y relaxing."], ["Lauren R.", "Amazing! Food was clean. Presentation was impressive and service was great too! Would definitely return even though the neighborhood is not \u00a0great."], ["Ananda T.", "Great Ambiance, Amazing food, at a great price! I say hands down this place is a Winner! Will be keeping it on rotation for the honey and mines date nights."], ["Enbar C.", "Our first time here. Just ordered the Poke & Avocado salad, New York Spicy Tuna, and the Samurai roll. The salad was phenomenal, fresh red tuna atop a bed of greens in a sesame dressing. Tuna was fresh, thickly cut into cubes and a generous portion. We shared this salad, along w the two rolls, so it was sufficient. I would say the full order of the salad is good for one.The rolls were cut into 8 pieces, great portion of fish in both, and not too much rice on the roll, which unfortunately, some spots do to make the rolls look thicker. Folks, this a great place, one of the top. This daughter of Tony, from Tony's Sushi on Miami Beach, opened this location.Eel sauce was excellent- not too watery, not too thick. Just right.Kaya for dessert. Words can't describe, just order it.Beautiful decor. We sat outside :)Our server John was amazing! Overall, 5 out of 5."], ["H. Deborah S.", "Great atmosphere without all the pretentiousness going on a little south of there in the DD. Friendly waitstaff and super friendly owner. Yes, the owner was there and working to make sure everything was enjoyable. I love when I'm eating at an establishment where an owner cares enough to be around. The service was quick, but not pushy. Each and every dish was excellent. I'm not sure what the name of the dish was, but it was one of the few vegan options...something curried. We ended up eating two of them...I also had the ramen soup. SOLD! It was awesome. The egg was perfectly poached...I'll have to remember to write down what we eat next time. I hope that next time is very soon. Great place and glad to see it is doing so well."], ["Tobias S.", "Just decided to stop by for some late night bites with my brother. We got there at 9:55 & they close at 10:30. When we walked into the dinning room we were stared at for 6minutes until I walked up to someone. Julio approached us after talking to the chef. He told me they were closed. They had to close early (2/3/15) because the manager had to go out out the country. I could tell the chef had told poor Julio to say this because he was so nervous. I walked to the chef & he told us to hurry & order everything at once. We went outside & dis just that. The food all arrived on time & tasted pretty good. I would have gave more stars but the greeting we revived was disgusting. Also the chocolate cake was disgusting, but since it was my brothers birthday Julio gave it to us for free. Julio was actually a good server, he took care of us & was extremely polite. Chef please do not have staff lie to customers about hours of operation. If you don't want to work get out of the kitchen."], ["AntOnio Y.", "Best Pad Thai in Miami, and very nice looking place. The bar is incredible and the sushi is great as well. Price is fair and good customer service"], ["Jesse F.", "Excellent meal. Well presented. Good service. In relaxed surroundings. Will definitely dine here again."], ["Daniella S.", "This place has a gorgeous atmosphere and amazing lunch specials. Specifically the \"Banh Mi\" sandwich is freakin' delicious. The service is really good and the prices are fair. Definitely recommend for lunch since the outdoor seating is so beautiful and again because of the specials. Just note the parking situation has gotten more complicated since it is after all in a residential area and there used to be an empty lot next door that now has a building on it. I believe there is valet there now, but I don't wish valet parking on anyone."], ["N D.", "Amazing restaurant. We had the Kalbi, pad thai, spring roll, and spider roll. First time having soy paper for my sushi and I loved it. Great ambience with outdoor dining, candles, and vibrant music. I would recommend this for anyone coming to Miami craving Asian cuisine. Their fusion of the traditional with the new is on point."], ["Paul M.", "Shokudo is probably one of the better Asian spots I've eaten at in a while. \u00a0They manage to offer Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, and even Filipino dishes and somehow do it all well.Some Stars:Momo - Curried potato dumpling - not too spicy and had a great flavor.Sisig - Surprised to see this Filipino dish on the menu and it was AWESOME. \u00a0Not really a bun per say, but it was a crackling dish of pork cheeks/belly with some bread to spread it on. \u00a0Delicious!!Bimimbab - Great Korean Rice dish but even better when I added pork belly. \u00a0Anything is better with a fried egg on top but this is just plain yummy.Banana Turron - Fried banana spring roll dessert....do I need to say more?The venue is very nice - probably one of the nicer restaurants in the area and the outdoor seating area is awesome while the weather lasts. \u00a0Service was exemplary - a pleasant surprise for Miami. \u00a0Great, great place to take a date.If this wasn't a good enough reason to come here, we happen to stop by during Happy Hour - $3.50 Cab and $3.00 Pinot Grigio made me VERY HAPPY. \u00a0I also had a $12 bottle of Nigori Saki which made me downright giddy. \u00a0(probably because I drank the entire bottle myself).Valet/Self park is $4 either way. \u00a0There isn't any street parking around so this is pretty much your only choice unless you want to walk a couple of blocks. Awesome addition to the area, so psyched to come back regularly."], ["Vanessa R.", "Variety of authentic Asian food (Japanese/Thai/Korean/Filipino). Fresh and delicious. Best pad thai I've had so far. Nice ambience inside, unlike the surrounding area. Only downside is the lack of parking space. Will definitely be back again."], ["Iris R.", "The sushi is good. But not anything of this world. The gyozas are not the best."], ["Priscilla R.", "I loved it! \u00a0Food was so unique and VERY tasty!"], ["Kara T.", "I haven't eaten the noodles but the sushi is awesome. I haven't been disappointed. There is a ton of fish in each roll. The tuna tataki is delicious and so is the mango and Samarai roll :) yummmm."], ["Y. Sandra A.", "I definitely do not write yelp reviews but I always read before I go to restaurant. I saw some mix reviews about Shokudo but I give it a try. It started very nicely. We ordered coconut shrimp soup but there is no young coconut inside and taste was off, talked to 'The Manager' mostly I don't need your business hipster attidude. Sushi rolls came 1 hour later taste was ok but sloppy and serving plates dirty. We really wanted to talk to owner but we heard she is on vacation. It was not a nice night for us plus we waited 2 hour to get all our food which is OK grade."], ["Tina V.", "*this review is for delivery orders only*I just started ordering for delivery service yesterday and was treated with fast and friendly service. \u00a0The food was good with minor things being off but over all the food was good that i even had delivery today. lolYoko actually deliver the food to me for my first order yesterday which I found very kind of her.Spider roll (4/5) was good but could use more soft shell crab ratioJampong (3.5/5) it was good but not spicy as advertised hence the star off... =( i asked for extra spicy too.Dreaming shrimp roll: (3/5) too much riceSoon du bu (5/5) yum and extra spicy as askedMiami beef (2/5) the worst dish of the group, it was just tasteless or had this weird vinegar taste. \u00a0Beef red curry (5/5) it was goodOverall I like it and \u00a0will be visiting the restaurant soon to try the food in house and see how it does."], ["Gayle O.", "This was our first visit. \u00a0We loved it! \u00a0the food was great. \u00a0The spicy tuna roll the best of dozens of rolls we have eaten. \u00a0The Thai basil chicken outstanding as was the beef chow mien, and the snapper. \u00a0Our waiter, Milad, was super, very well informed, helpful and pleasant...always a surprise in Miami."], ["Toya R.", "Consistently great food and amazing service! Most asian fusion restaurants in Miami are just Japanese/Thai, but this place has a phenomenal selection of Pan Asian cuisine. You should definitely try the Crispy Pata (Filipino) or the Kalbi (Korean). They are both a must have."], ["Alissa W.", "It has been almost a year since I have eaten here. I was craving sushi and said let me give this place a try again last week. I was blown away the food is just amazing. I love the assortment of rolls. The fish is really fresh. Their spicy tuna, and spicy scallop rolls are amazing. I love the tuna avocado and macadamia nut ahi poke. The food doesn't taste like commercialized sushi. The atmosphere is amazing you MUST sit on the outside back patio. They also do delivery !!!"], ["David C.", "Food is goodService sucks!!I went there with my sister.Waiter kept on forgetting the order.Order arrived wrong.Was just not a good service experience."], ["John-Paul P.", "Shrimp & Bacon Pad Thai !!"]]}
