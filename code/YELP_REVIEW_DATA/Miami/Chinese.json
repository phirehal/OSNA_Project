It bothers me only because I love their food and I love being around Brickell.

The prices are reasonable. The food was fulfilling! I ordered the seamen chicken and rice. Ive had it before at other restaurants so nothing was special about it. The only negative thing I have to say about the food is the rice is DRY! Please add some sauce or flavoring to it. Its extra dry and its like you have to force it down your throat.

One of my Chinese fav is hot and sour soup but not here. My favorite food is Chilean sea bass. I tried it here and found it too plain and tasteless.

Chang's may not be the Dead Sea, but it sure is close to it. It was very evident to me that they were using salt as a replacement to complex flavors. Biologically, humans are inclined to eating things that are sweet and salty... thanks (Charles) Darwin. We can't help it and P.F. relies on it our basic biological desires to keep our desires satisfied. I can't blame the chefs on this one... it's a corporate issue.Our group sat down for dinner on a Friday night. Our wait was 30 minutes, which was acceptable for our large group. My only complaint was that we had nowhere to sit for about half of that wait. The small bench is good for a few people, but as the wait gets longer, the space gets very limited to even stand. The weather outside, for Florida, was chillier than normal, so standing outside was not in our interest. Is there a fix for this? Not really, so I won't complain about it, but it is mentioned.As I started jotting notes down of problems, I began to notice a pattern for the issues.. namely a corporate failure. A business, may it be corporate or small business, needs to keep the business operating at a reasonable level. Unfortunately, P.F. Chang doesn't seem to train their wait staff. To compound the issue, there is no organization among the wait staff, kitchen, and bussers. The wait staff had difficulty with the menu. The kitchen was unable to provide hot water for tea that was ordered at the table. The first kettle of water for tea was EMPTY. The second kettle of water was COLD water. Finally, the third (and last) kettle of water was luke warm. The kitchen churns out food that rivals the Dead Sea in salt content. Yes, salt is a flavoring tool, but I'd rather not be licking a salt block.For an appetizer, there were a few plates ordered. I got to try out a crispy wonton. It was good, but very salty.... yes, that will be a trend. I hate to sound like a broken record, but ultimately, I think I had more than 5000mg of sodium without even using soy sauce! Although I saw our server many times, the bus service was very unorganized. Our server was the one who needed to bring us (flat) water. /facepalm/ I \u00a0feel that the bus servers should be the ones providing that... minor quip. I shouldn't need to ask... another minor quip.For my entree, I ordered the Mongolian Beef with brown rice. I tried the rice BEFORE the beef and found it completely bland and flavorless. The beef was juicy and tender, but once again.. too salty. The vegetable with the beef, which I can't quite remember the name of at the time of writing this review, absorbed a good 60-80% of the salt. So if you plan on ordering the beef, stick to the beef and skip the veggies (if you aren't Mr. Ed).I had the opportunity to try the lo mein. Very tasty, surprisingly. I had a bit of trouble telling if it was salty because my taste buds were shot. I was able to tell that the celery had an overpowering flavor. Hmmph. Not bad. Not special. For dessert I ordered a mini great wall of chocolate. It was a chocolate fudge on top, with a brownie layer right below and a strawberry-chocolate at the bottom. It was a clever (pallet cleaning) dessert, but felt a little out of place. Aren't there any non-salted Chinese (or asian desserts) they could have placed on the menu? I would hope so. Sadly, I didn't see them.I highly recommend that corporate P.F. Changs reconsider their menu, train their staff, and organize the front of the house a bit.Bottom Line: I'm no Mr. Ed and I don't appreciate dishes with more salt than the salt shakers on the table. Not bad, but I can't see myself going back anytime soon."], ["Shelia G.", "The lettuce wraps are my favorite as well as their garlic spinach.

We chatted for a few, she doing out we had not been in a while and she was curious why - she seemed to care a lot. She needs to be a server, will explain why below. She sat us outside as we requested and brought us out menus, reminding us that it was still happy hour too. We both commented on how refreshing it was to have someone so good at their job. Then came the reason this review was not given stars: our server. She was so monotone and seemed bored out of her mind, hates her job, is rude and careless, and maybe hates life in general. Getting her to crack a smile became a painful mission at best but I lost in the end. She wouldn't stop complaining about how slow the kitchen is and we were not even waiting that long.

Especially the ones that REHEAT 2-3 day old foods. This place the food \u00a0was served perfectly and tasted fresh and was rich in flavor.

He/she will continue to talk about sauce without pausing for 5 minutes all while mixing up a crazy concoction using 6 bowls and all for no apparent reason. And then just as suddenly the server will disappear from the table. Never once have I had any need for this additional sauce. I just don't get it.

When we asked for bowls for our oxtail hot pot rice we were given clear plastic Chinet plates. They seemed to have run out of bowls and the place wasn't even full yet. The non-alcoholic drink selection is very limited. They only have bottled drinks. Also it is still a cash only place which I think they need to change.

One bowl is plenty to split two ways (which service gladly offered the first time I visited and every time after) or enough for a complete meal for lunch or the main entree on a cold night! Its got the usual wontons (though made perfectly!!!) as well as noodles and free floating sliced pork! \u00a0The broth is very tasty, and its served with homemade egg noodles. Worth the visit alone!The Chinese pork buns and sweetbread dishes (Lao bing) are completely wonderful. \u00a0I usually split one with a friend as part of any meal. \u00a0The shrimp egg rolls will blow away 99 out of 100 egg rolls out there (2 per order, to limit fighting). The entree sized General Tso's gator is a great example of local ingredients creating farm to table Chinese cooking you won't find elsewhere.Lastly, the peanut, coconut and sriracha ice cream is a great meal topper, loaded with taste, tangy (serious) spicy notes and a fortune Cookie that's got homemade written all over it (and inside too). instagram.com/p/kYUy66hd\u2026If you love Chinese and stepping out of traditional boundaries, Black Brick is a must visit!"], ["Marilyn G.", "Excellent food, excellent drinks and excellent service. \u00a0You can't ask for anything more."], ["Luis M D.", "This place is particular, is not a clasic chinese rest.

Strike 1: \u00a0beef brisket/tendon dish- the meat was completely inedible due to the fact that it was not cooked long enough. The tendon was so hard and chewy that we spat it out, eating only the tough beef surrounding it. This dish, if cooked properly, is delicious, with soft tendon and melt in your mouth meat. I have never made such a horrible rendition of it myself, much less ordered it at a restaurant. Strike 2: double cooked pork- again with the poor execution. The pork belly was overcooked to such jerky like consistency that even the fat surrounding it could not save its texture. It was also way too salty.Strike 3: remember when they told us they were out of all those dishes? One of them was the beef noodle soup I saw being placed on the table of a couple who arrived 30 min after we placed our order.And so i left thanking my stars that I do not live in this city anymore, and will be hightailing it back to Rockville, MD for some real food soon.End Note: the two stars was for the cabbage.

They slice the duck inside, so without the table-side show, $40 seems rather steep for a plate of duck skin and a soup. \u00a0Authentic restaurants in Beijing uses fruit tree wood, so you're missing some nuance of flavor, but the crepe and the presentation is really authentic. \u00a0Needs to pre-order.

Definitely recommend:)"], ["Bill L.", "Before they moved, I would have given GG a 4. \u00a0Picked up an order a few nights ago from their new location. \u00a0I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the location but the latest round from GG didn't seem up to their former self. \u00a0The order seemed just a little on the bland side.I would like to be more elaborate with this review but what can you say about a take-out joint? \u00a0Like I said, seemed as though they were a little slim on the flavor."], ["Tim P.", "Definitely above average Chinese Takeout. \u00a0-- \u00a0I found this place on Yelp! with help from other reviews. \u00a0On the way there my GPS had the location wrong so I called and they provided great directions, when I came to pick up my food everyone was very cordial and welcoming. \u00a0The hospitality didn't stop there, on the way home I got a call from Gourmet Gourmet saying that they had forgotten the \"Crepes\" that come with the Moo Shu Pork. \u00a0I told them that they really weren't that important and not to worry however, they insisted that they bring them to my hotel at no cost! \u00a0That is good customer service in my book. \u00a0The food is delicious too, not just your typical Chinese Takeout!"], ["Brian B.", "Really this place should get 4.5 stars, but when you think about what it really is, it bumps it to 5. \u00a0This place is the best chinese takeout in the gables/coconut grove area. \u00a0Mind you this place is ONLY take-out or delivery, no seating here. So far everything I've tried here was deliciousso this place moved. and i haven't tried the new location yet."], ["Ivonne Marie C.", "Chinese food is, well, Chinese food - unless you've gone to China you're not much aware of how Americanized Chinese food is in the US. But in all, it's good, quick food; and Gourmet Gourmet is no exception. I used to always eat here back when they were closer to downtown CG. When I'd literally eat my lunch atop a refrigerator b/c their shop was so small. Not much has changed, except now, they have six stools, one counter, and a stainless steel metal shelf placed too high to eat comfortably... another thing that hasn't changed - their food and their service. Seriously, the couple of people who work here are just nice; and best of all, it's super cheap!!yeiii that Gourmet Gourmet reopened, and yeiii that it is still relatively close to my work so I can come back every now and then. * Warming - if you are claustrophobic I recommend you order delivery and do not make plans to stay and eat inside. I'm sure you get the picture - my walk-in closet is larger than this place.** Credit cards accepted for orders of $15 or more."], ["Juan A.", "I don't eat Chinese food from any other place in Miami. I've been going to Gourmet Gourmet since they were in the Gables. Our office has lunch from them once or twice a month, and everyone loves their chosen dish. It's not a place to go to sit down and eat, but its worth the hassle of taking back to your house or office."], ["Praneeth W.", "Wow, there is only one way to describe the food I had at this place. Completely awful. Looking for a quick, cheap takeout Chinese place, I found \"Gourmet Gourmet\" on Yelp and ordered General Tso's Chicken and Pork Fried Rice.What I received was absolutely hideous. Chicken that was so rubbery and fatty (some pieces with skins), fried rice again with as low quality meat as possible. It managed to even smell bad.Looking at other reviews here, maybe I just ordered the wrong things? I hope that's the case but considering the quality of the meat, hmm.To top things off, they charge for their hot sauce too. Yes, the prices are low but not really low enough to make up for the terrible food."], ["Janine C.", "This is one of the best Chinese places around! Jose Sang is one great chef and he cooks the food right there in front of you. There are \u00a0only 3 seats at the bar to eat, but worth it!!! The chicken over Jade blossums is the most amazing dish, but everything I have eaten has been incredible. The fried dumplings and the spare ribs are awesome. The soup is delicious and the main dishes are huge and can be shared between 3 people easily. \u00a0Most people order take out and delivery, but if you eat it there, you will come back again and again!"], ["Chris L.", "give it 3 stars only because it's in miami. I would be 1 star if it's in bay area."], ["Shawna M.", "This was my first try at Gourmet Gourmet and it was great!

The side rice was great too. Owner is very cool and attentive. They cook everything in front of you so you know it is fresh and how they do it. This place reminds me the old Chinese take-out places in NYC. The owner highly recommends the special rice that it is what I am thinking of getting today!"], ["Miggy F.", "House special rice, fantastic!"], ["Jennifer R.", "They make it quick, they make it good and they make it cheap. \u00a0The portions are enough to feed 2 people and on top of all that, they deliver in the CG neighborhood.It takes a real good Chinese takeout joint for a Chinese person to recommend it to other. \u00a0This place is awesome and we order from them about once a week.This little \"hole in the wall\" takeout joint has been there forever and the quality of the food has been consistent.They have the best Singapore Noodles (the BF can't get enough, we have to order that every time) and the Sasha Beef is magnificent."], ["Alex L.", "Have to say that I agree w most of the reviews. I ordered ham fried rice, honey chicken n egg rolls. The rice tasted so fresh n yummy, the honey chicken was very good too. The egg rolls had sort of an over powering flavor, it had too much of something, can't really pin point it. Food was ready when I got there n staff was very nice n friendly.

Oh my fu*&^ing fried rice and chix with broccoli!!!! I think the last time I tasted Chinese so yummy was in San Francisco. Someone here \u00a0knows what they're doing - ps - my hubbie went inside to pick up the food - so I can't really comment on it's interior, but take out?? A - PLUS PLUS!!!

Anyone know?"], ["miGs v.", "Food is good and they have good lunch specials..... entrees are huge ... one is enough for two..... \u00a0the wontons are golden.....didnt have any cups and ice for my coke which i thought was weird..... but then again its a little hole in the wall... foods good... cheap and kool.... theres only like 5 chairs in a bar type setting (no tables) \u00a0and no one was there.... mostly take out ... id go again"]]}
