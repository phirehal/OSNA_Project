If I was basing my review strictly on the view, this would get 5 stars... however, the service wasn't the best and the valet parking was a little confusing. So let's start with the view... WOW! We scored a table right on the water, yes, right on the water, for a Wednesday night happy hour. What does that mean? The sunshine, water and gorgeous afternoon, lent itself to a perfect backdrop to wind down the day. Also, it meant $1 glasses of champagne for women who purchased an appetizer. I went with the Mexican caprese salad which the only different between a regular caprese salad was that there were some greens and guacamole. It was a perfect, light bite to accompany my champagne. Our server was okay but not extremely attentive or informative. It wasn't even busy for happy hour.The inside was very nice as well but I can't imagine sitting inside if the weather is nice when you have a great view at your fingertips.

Now for the food: the calamari flatbread was great, so were the fried green tomatoes. The Serrano ham croquets were amazing-a must! The risotto was delicious, my favorite dish so far. The churrasco was juicy and tender. I had the zucchini pasta with chicken. Best of all. Everything was reasonably priced and every entree comes with an appetizer.

They had ample seating at the bar, which is actually more like a lounge area with a mix of couches, short stools and tables. \u00a0We actually hung out there for about 30 minutes since we were told (upon arrival) that there would be outside seating, just not immediately - which was fine with me!Although the inside of the restaurant is a great place to sit, nothing beats sitting outside. \u00a0The view is great! \u00a0They have an \"upper level\" (this is where we sat - it's connected to the main level). \u00a0They also have a \"lower level\" (which is where I wish we would've sat!) and if I were you, I would ask to be escorted that-a-way for dinner because the view is nicer. \u00a0As our dinner choices, my husband chose the bacon pizza with the Serrano ham croquets as the appetizer. \u00a0And I chose the risotto with wild rice, shrimp, and mushroom in some decadent, awesome creamy sauce. \u00a0As my appetizer, I got the Chihuahua Cheese. \u00a0Verdict says... all of it was great! \u00a0Again, not mind blowing, but definitely satisfying and tasty. And the portions were perfect - we did not feel cheated at all! \u00a0And really, the prices weren't bad. \u00a0You have 3 price levels - $17, $21 and $25; and each entr\u00e9e comes with an appetizer of your choice. \u00a0Seriously, a win-win situation. \u00a0That, coupled with the view, makes it a nice night out. \u00a0Ridiculously stuffed, we nixed the idea of dessert. As we walked out, hand in hand, we decided we could absolutely see ourselves coming back. \u00a0It's always exciting when you find a location that you can add to your list of places good enough to come back to. \u00a0It's usually hit or miss when you're venturing out and going somewhere new.

The place is absolutely gorgeous and they did a fantastic job organizing and setting up. We sat down and were immediately greeted with mimosas and given a brunch menu that included appetizer, entree and beverages. Our specific menu which was chosen by the host consisted of Serrano ham croquettes, scrambled eggs, croissant, strawberry & banana creamed waffles, bacon and patatas bravas. It seemed like this restaurant offered a variety of food ranging from American to Spanish to Mediterranean. The two items that stood out from this specific menu were the strawberry & banana waffles which were fantastic and the patatas bravas. The potatoes (patatas) were smothered with a sauce I believe was marinara which gave it an amazing kick to it that I've never had at any other Spanish place. Everything else was pretty simple, nothing out of the ordinary. I have to say though that the portions were very small, my guess is it might have been due to the fact that we had a selective menu for an entire party. Might not be the case if you come for regular brunch. Next time, I want to sit outside facing the water as they have an outstanding seating arrangement with a pretty awesome view of the ocean.

The appetizer platter is the way to go here: we shared this between two of us for dinner and it would have been enough (we got ambitious and ordered the farmer's cheese also, which meant we had a good bit to take home). At $30, this meant the appetizer platter was a great deal. We picked five appetizers :- Foul madamas. Stellar. Blew away other any other foul madamas I've had. This is a must-order to me. - Hummus. Delicious and great texture.- Babaganoush. This was remarkably good babaganoush. I am usually disappointed by babaganoush, but not here. Great flavors and, again, great texture. - Falafel. I thought it was pretty standard actually. I was satisfied, but unlike \u00a0the a number of the dishes I tried at Shaddai, the falafel did not particularly stand out.- Grape leaves. These were above average. And interesting because, unlike many grape leaves I've had, these were warm.  I mentioned we got overly ambitious and ordered farmer's cheese too. These were fried cubes of really, really fresh cheese. With a vaguely mozzarella-like taste. I also thought this was a must-order. The cheese was fried perfectly (which is to say, lightly). Despite being fried, it felt light and tasted ultra fresh. Really fantastic. Service was good and the atmosphere was very nice.

Now, on to the food.Disclaimer: The order in which these arrived may be off, considering I went there a week ago. \u00a0The hummus with meat arrived, and it looked colorful. \u00a0Honestly, I had never seen hummus with ground meat in it. \u00a0If you ate the hummus with the meat, it had a nice flavor, but if you ate the hummus without the meat, it seemed to be lacking in flavor. \u00a0I could not taste the garlic or lemon juice that should be present in the hummus, and I think it could have used a bit more salt. \u00a0It's definitely not the best hummus I have had in my life. \u00a0Next were the grape leaves. \u00a0I was surprised to get these rather hot, I am used to having them at room temperature or cold, especially when they're the vegetarian type. \u00a0I like lemon juice on my grape leaves but these did not come with any. \u00a0Perhaps the Lebanese do not use lemon on their grape leaves, whereas the Greeks do? The falafel arrived and it was good, your standard falafel.I was a bit unsure about the next item, the kibbeh nayeh, considering it is raw meat and although I am quite adventurous, the only things I eat raw are oysters, veggies, and fish (sushi!). \u00a0Kibbeh nayeh is actually Lebanon's staple, and consists of raw meat. I was a bit worried, actually. \u00a0Luckily, it wasn't bloody or anything but I was unsure of how raw meat would taste and if this would now make me a zombie. \u00a0My friend demonstrated that you were supposed to tear off a piece of pita and scoop up the meat with it. \u00a0He also explained that the meat had to be extremely fresh and it's actually ground lamb...always. \u00a0It must be purchased from a butcher, you will not find ground lamb (or at least not extremely fresh ground lamb) from a place like Publix. \u00a0I probably looked loathsome as I took a bite but surprisingly, it was good, and found myself eating seconds, and thirds...who knew I'd like raw meat bathed in olive oil?Unfortunately, we did not have time for dessert as I had to get my car before closing time, but we did get to enjoy our fatoush, a Lebanese salad. \u00a0It's pretty large, in my photo, you're only seeing half of the salad, as my friend put the other half on his plate, so don't order one just for yourself, unless you plan to make that your entree. \u00a0The fatoush was good, though I would have preferred more tomato and dressing. \u00a0As we were wrapping up our meal, we were finally able to pull Tony away from the kitchen briefly, as the restaurant was starting to get busy. \u00a0My friend and Tony spoke in Arabic with Tony for some time until he had to go greet some other people and get back to the cooking.We enjoyed our meal, but because of the lack of a belly dancer and the comments I included in my review about the appetizers, I feel a 4-star rating is fair. \u00a0Perhaps as time goes by, they will be able to bring back the belly dancer and make other improvements."], ["Lorna B.", "Yum great food wonderful family.

A grape leaf that is not acidic is not good lebanese. The Kabob combo was absolutely delicious and big enough for 2 people.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the slow service. Everyone is friendly buy they only had 2 waiters on staff plus a busser and Chef Tony's wife. They ALL came to our table, each taking a different order.

The dolmades were served warm, a delightful first for us and, in addition, the Kafta kabob were both uniquely flavored with mint? Cardamom? The mystery made this terrific meal all the more fabulous.To explain the \"missing 5th star\"...the service was a bit ragged & each item was over-priced. \u00a0Wait-staff can be friendly without being genuinely warm. I found this to be the case here at \"Shadai\". \u00a0In addition to the service being somewhat slow, no one of the 3 staff for the small dining room (nicely decorated, with great Mediterranean music) was consistently our \"assigned\" server, which seems to create confusion for guests and staff alike.The food seemed over-priced for this restaurant, given this location (in a strip mall). As former natives of Miami, now living outside Washington, D.C., we would pay no more than $20/$15/$5-$6 for the items listed above. \u00a0But I'll close by saying, for the food alone, we'd return for sure, just not as soon as we'd like!"], ["Kristin M.", "My first time trying Lebanese cuisine and I loved it!

I didn't care for it too much but since its the raw version of the Kibbeh it is definitely an acquired taste. I hate the lamb kabobs which were very tasty... a bit dry, but still a lot of flavor! My husband had the grape leaves entre which he loved. Portions are generous just like the service! Also, Chef Tony comes out and greets each of his patrons and asks how the food was - what a great touch! It really shows that they care about their customer satisfaction.

After several attempts to get her attention, she finally came and we requested some oil for the bread. About 10 minutes later, she slammed it on the table very rudely as if we had insulted her by requesting it. The portions were EXTREMELY small considering the $20-$30 plate price tag. The food came out separately, so my friend was waiting for a while before her plate of simple hummus, grape leaves and fried garbanzo came. My mahi mahi was tiny, dry and tasted as though they had made it weeks before. It looked so sad sitting on my plate, and luckily the lack of lighting in the restaurant masked its unappetizing appearance.

I like to add olive oil and paprika to it. It brings out the best flavors of the hummus. The red lentil soup (actually yellow) is amazing and super healthy. The kibeh, falafel, and grape leaves are also top notch. As for the meat offerings, the shawarma is great and they just started offering lamb (gyro style) as well. That was the only missing piece for me in my daily quest for a mediterranean fix. The pita is also made fresh in house and is the essential accompaniment to any meal here.

It was packed on a Saturday night, you usually get a good feel for a place depending on how full it is, and here good thing we came early because otherwise we wouldn't have gotten a table for 12 otherwise. I decided that instead of a dish I wanted to try a few things \"Tapas\" style with my hubby. The choices were: Avgolemono (lemon egg soup), Feta Cheese with Greek Olives, Melitzanosalata (eggplant salad), Spanakopita, Saganaki. The Avgolemono was absolutely insanely superb, it is LEMON soup so if you are a citrus freak like me it is something you must try. The soup has bits of chicken and a lot of rice with the broth, very lemony and I couldn't help but thinking this would be fantastic to have when you are getting over a cold. Melitzanosalata was also above expectations, I am so glad that this was a part of our meal, I could taste many flavors but couldn't put my finger on any one. Absolutely delicious to have with the amazing home made pita bread that I couldn't stop eating. Spanakopita: Thick, full of spinach and feta and by far the best I have ever had, usually the Spanakipita is a lot of phyllo and a little filling, here it was the opposite. Saganaki, flambeed cheese.. 'nuff said. Burnt cheese? My downfall - love it. The last time I had eaten here it was for some reason unmemorable but yesterday it was just perfect. Of course the feta and olives were good, all in all, it reminds me of my Greek friend (also Maria) and her papa's cooking. OPA!"], ["Alex B.", "Great place! The gyro platters is really good however the lamb portion are small. Mykonos just down the street give you a lot more lamb for your money. Service was excellent."], ["T K.", "I usually come here 4-6 times a month (for YEARS), but that's not going to be the case any longer. The last time I was there I had a new server, some guy who's name I didn't bother to ask since I knew I'd never be back again. He was SO rude, and so ready to say NO, or act like everything was a problem. My husband and I are very consistent, we always order the same dishes, cooked the same way. I don't care if he wants to charge 75 cents for the pita, just don't tell me it doesn't come with my hummus after I've been ordering it for over 5 years! Even then, maybe he should be given some customer service training so that he doesn't insist on scolding the customer. I'm not going there to argue, I'm going there to have dinner. I have NO interest in any exchange with the waiter beyond placing my order and asking for the check. When we walked in Nico wasn't at the front, and Costa wasn't working that night, so as far as we knew, maybe this guy was the manager that night. I was very disappointed with the service, and even the food tasted different. The food just isn't good enough for me to go back and risk the unpleasant experience. I order the chicken, I really can have it anywhere with great service. (Like Villagio! Where I usually go.)"], ["Guillermo R.", "Chicken gyros"], ["Jonathan f.", "If you like waiters who don't speak English and an empty wallet, the THIS is the place for you!!

I could eat their tzatziki sauce straight. Their Gyro platter is legit. Saganaki is sick. Overall highly recommend."], ["Cliff F.", "It's difficult for me to express how amazing Maria's really is. I've been about 10 times over the past six weeks, and not once have I been let down. The service is immaculate, the food is addictive, and the prices are beyond reasonable.Maria's has been in Miami since 1982, and its easy to see why. My favorite thing to order is the pikilia, a collection of spreads including: hummus, tzatziki, taramosalata, and melitzanosalata. The hummus is exactly what one imagines hummus should taste like--the consistency is spot on and it is literally bursting with flavor. Their tzatziki is very creamy and spreadable, and especially fantastic when you combine it with the hummus. Taramosalata is a traditional cod roe spread, and in its Maria's iteration, it is pure perfection. You'll honestly have to try it to know what I mean, but as far as spreads, this taramosalata is perfection. The melitzanosalata is a great eggplant spread, but in this company it stands in the shadow, which is akin to being an Oscar nominee. Other platter components include feta cheese, tomatoes, radishes, olives, cucumbers, and pita to bring it all together. TIP: take pita, add feta, fold in half, apply spread of choice, and eat. Welcome to Maria's. Other apps -- I've tried the spanakopita, saganaki (famous flaming cheese!), keftedakia, dolmadakia, village salad---any of which are great to start a feast (I always stick with the platter though!) Entrees -- I've tried the moussaka, pastitsio, keftedes, and gyro platter---all of them are spectacular, but the pastitsio is astounding. Try it. Don't skip dessert either! The kourambiedes are great, and their galactobourico is worth a trip. Go. You won't be disappointed. I would turn down free dinners at some of Miami's best restaurants to go to Maria's. In fact, I have...and I will again.

The restaurant was pretty empty considering the random hours, which made the service very casual. Usually I'd be a bit annoyed about this but in this particular \u00a0occasion, it only further enhanced the meal.

I had the gyro platter and it was delicious!!! I find that often people can mess Greek good up very easily, but this was perfect. The meat was just right. The fries were nice and crispy. The little Greek salad was great and the feta was nice and fresh. I only give them 4 stars because their parking situation kind of stinks. We had to park in the back in a sketchy alley way. Then we had to walk all the way around to get to the front door, as there was barely any parking up front.Otherwise, a great Greek restaurant."], ["Giancarlo B.", "Have you ever been to Mezes Greek Restaurant in Pembroke Pines? I have and its AMAZING!!! However, I don't live anywhere near Pines and went to Maria's in hopes of finding a great Greek restaurant that is a bit closer to home. Sadly, (in terms of food/flavor) Maria's just simply did not measure up. Their pita bread is pretty damn tasty though not to mention warm! But hey, food isn't everything and Maria's isn't completely horrible. There are other great things to boast about. Their service for example, is excellent! Ashely S. and I were seated quickly, our food was brought out promptly and our waitress was always around when we needed her without being too annoying. Additionally, this place is great for large groups. They have plenty space and long tables that can accommodate you if brought along an army of your friends. Their food portions are also pretty big which can help feed your crew. Lastly, if you can't find parking along coral way, fear not! They have plenty of parking in the rear. Will I come here again? Yes, but I'd like to check out other Greek places in the neighborhood and see how they all measure up."], ["Alex R.", "This is one of the office favorites for lunch! This is as good as Greek food gets! The chicken is perfectly seasoned, salad is fresh and tasty and lamb is amazing. I never liked Greek until i tried Maria's.

The manager had no explanation for why our reservation was not listed or why we were not told about the private party.

Our server was very nice however he was the ONLY server in the restaurant, therefore there his hands were tied, the service was slow, he forgot to bring us items we requested. We went for lunch this past Monday (Columbus Day Monday), around 12 pm. Although I know Columbus Day is not a big holiday/day off in South Florida, that's not the case in other parts of the US, i.e. people come down for a long weekend so maybe you should staff with more than a single server. Our party of 3 sat outside which has, like I said, an amazing view, but the place is obviously worn out, worn down, and needs a lot of TLC. The patio furniture is discolored, half of the fans above us were working, the landscaping/gardening obviously hasn't been tended to. I come from a hotel background and these things are usually obvious to me, however, I think the average person would have noticed how tired and un-maintained the place is. As we continued our lunch, additional tables came in (a couple of parties of 6-7 people), and, although we got our food in an average amount of time (and it was very good, might I add), the poor server was pulled in so many directions, there was nothing he could do to stay on top of the tables. There was, apparently, a restaurant manager, helping out (my husband, who is a restaurant manager, stated this woman was the restaurant manager. Apparently, he can eye them out), but I never would have guessed she was the manager from her manner and the lost look she had. They also had the pool bar attendant helping out with bringing out food. Eventually, the Director of Catering came down to help. Clearly, this place was not ready for any diners on this beautiful Monday at lunchtime! The food was very good - the guacamole, tuna, short rib sliders and Cuban shrimp. Everything tasted great - fresh, well seasoned, portions were average (not too small or big) and pricing was relative to what you'd find in a hotel restaurant. I wasn't surprised by the pricing - it's what I expect when I go to a restaurant in a hotel. After lunch (of which we received no discount despite the terrible service), we walked around the pool area, another space which is lovely (amazing view!!!) but needs TLC as well. The place looked a bit desolate. Finally, we walked over to the spa. Walking down the outside hallway towards the spa, it is so obvious that the place hasn't been touched/updated/some areas maybe even cleaned, in a while. The doors (guest room doors I'm assuming) needed a paint job, the gardening/landscaping was either overgrown or non-existent, with weeds growing in, the outdoor furniture looked so worn out, dust/dead ants/flies on it, and, alas, arriving at the spa, it was closed! Closed on a Monday? Never heard of this before. That, my friends was the determining factor (for us), that it will be quite sometime before we return to the Grove Isle Hotel and/or Gibraltar. Finally, (and I promise this is final), when we arrived at valet, the attendant was quick to receive us (and there was actually another group of 3 waiting for their car or a taxi). There was no one at the front desk when we entered or exited the hotel, however, on the way out, the valet attendant was again quick to get our car. And friendly. Those who do work at this property (and there seemed to be few of them), were all very nice and friendly. They just need to handle their staffing better. And update the hotel. That is all."], ["Gabriel T.", "I'm going to be as quick as possible despite it'll be hard.I made a reservation via OpenTable for a party of 4 last Saturday at 6:00PM.

The temps and humidity was hard, also a lot of mosquitos.We were treated very amicable and professional by our server \"Luis M.\", the view of this restaurant is great, and the live guitarist was an unexpected added bonus, but...The way they do math does NOT add up:Our server explained a few \"specials\" that were not on the menu, one of them was the filet mignon, called on the attached photo of the check \"LANDFOOD SPECIAL\", they never mentioned anything about prices on the 2 or 3 \"specials\".The filet mignon or LANDFOOD SPECIAL was small, with too much grease and bone. When we received the check I was shocked by seeing \"2 LANDFOOD SPECIAL $124.00\". This meant they charged me $62.00 per Filet Mignon with lower quality that Outback Victoria Filet which cost only $24...My main complaint is NOT even the $62.00 per filet, it's the obvious set-up of not including it on the regular menu and then offer it \"verbally omitting the prices\". That's a real and legal way to pickpocket people. I have gone to several great Steakhouses, some of them use to offer specials that are NOT in the menu and ALWAYS the server explain the specials with their prices. Below and with * are the ones I have personally gone and being offered specials with disclosed prices*.

This is letting them to include taxes on the pre-add 20% gratuity (which should not be taxed since it will be a double taxation because the server is responsible to paying his/her state and federal taxes).So the correct amount of Tax on the bill should have being: $18.69 instead of $28.84 (another $10.15 unearned money charged).Considering the amount I was charged for Florida Tax (7%) $28.84 versus the correct amount I should have be charged of $18.69 it give us a Tax Rate of around 11%.To close the remembrance; the next day I received an email from OpenTable saying that I didn't make it to the reservation... which indicate they didn't report our arrival to avoid paying the referral's' fees...People keep your eyes hide open if you still decided to give them a try, don't get too distracted by the nice waterfront views!"], ["Belinda B.", "Second visit proved to have many ups and downs.

I have to admit when it first came out I was worried that it was on the small side but it's served along side tostones and was just perfect. Speaking of sizes the drinks surprised me. They were priced at about $12, but given the location I expected my mojito to be in a small glass, but no mine came out in a full glass and the margaritas were served in chile's style glass. For the main course I had the grilled jumbo shrimp it was delish. The shrimp were seasoned perfectly and were succulent and juicy. On the side it came with an herbed couscous \u00a0and slow braised kale. This sides were the only disappointment of the night as they were ok but lacked anything special.

His sides were homemade chips that were tasty and some amazing Brussels sprouts with some sort of heavenly mashed creamy vegetable. Service was on point and really added to the wonderful experience.

I was a little hesitant to dine here after reading all the negative reviews regarding the service. However, I liked their Miami Spice offerings and decided to try it anyway. Our service was pretty good until the end of our meal. I will elaborate on this at the end of the review. We arrived a few minutes late for our 730 reservations. We were seated right away and noticed the dining room was pretty empty for a Friday night. There were only 3 other small parties in the room, so at this point we didn't have any service issues. I asked our waitress for a recommendation on the white wine. She knew nothing about the wine and stated she would have to ask the bartender! Wow! I've never experienced that before. They definitely need to educate their staff!!For starters, we ordered the Oaxaca cheese fundido. It had shrimp and chorizo sausage in it and was devine. I wish I could have licked the little skillet it came in! Unfortunately, this was as good as it gets. For the entree course, we ordered the Seared Scallop and Chorizo, and the Grilled Veal chop. The veal chop had a nice flavor, but it was overcooked and a little chewy. The hash browns that accompanied it were awful...awful...awful! I've had better hash browns at Denny's. I left them on the plate! My friends scallop entree consisted of 2 small scallops on the plate. Very stingy to serve 2 scallops and call it an entree. This was an appetizer sized portion, and she was rather disappointed. For dessert, we both ordered the banana cheesecake sundae and some cappuccinos. Dessert was underwhelming. The only thing that impressed me was the fundido and the view.  After dessert, we waited and waited for our check. I noticed the waitress was a bit overwhelmed as a large party and a party of 4 came in at the same time. It's as if she forgot us, so I had to flag down someone else and ask them for the check. After another wait, she finally brings the check. We waited again for approximately 10 minutes, but she never returned to pick it up, so I had to ask someone else to take it. At that point, I decided we would not be leaving any additional gratuity (they already add on 20%) and left.

I would give Wendy's three stars, just to give you a clue what three stars mean to me.First, the service is SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW\u00adWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Today is a Saturday, and I went to get takeout for lunch. During most of my visit there was no one present at the counter to take orders. Once the order was placed, my order, which consisted of stuff that was already prepared, took a long time to fill.There is no possible excuse for this. Other restaurants move quicker, so these people can do it if they try. They're harming their own business. The longer it takes to serve a guest, the fewer transactions there will be, and there goes your gross income. They could serve three times as many people if they were efficient.Second thing: bad location. They used to be in a place that was easier to see and get to. Now they're hidden in a weird building with a tiny parking lot. My truck is too big to fit in that lot, so I had to park on the street at an extremely expensive meter. I had to go out and put change in it while they fixed my food, because it only gave me two minutes per nickel.Third problem: they don't get the food to you in the best condition. It looks like they make the food from scratch, and it's very good, but they let it sit around. I lived in Israel, and I ate wonderful falafel there. It was fresh from the fryer. The Daily Bread served me a sandwich with room-temperature falafel which was a little soggy. It could have been excellent, had it been hot. They also gave me room-temperature pita with my hummus.The restaurant is simple but comfortable, and it looks really clean. It's quiet. These are pluses.They have a bakery and store in the same space. If you're a cook, and you want things like cardamom pods or semolina, the Daily Bread is a wonderful resource. They also have great Arab baked goods. You'll enjoy the Daily Bread, but it's a shame they're satisfied with such low standards.

But I can critique the people at the checkout and at the to go. There used to be a lot of super people working here, but no more. They made me feel like I was doing them a favor last week. The girl who took my order for a large, two pound-ish order of tabbouleh, some kibbeh and other stuff, was clearly very taken with the couple behind me and actually bypassed me to take their order (wraps) and do nothing at all about my tabbouleh, for which she had taken the order, which needed to be packed and added to my takeout, I had brought a whole lot of stuff like hummus etc. from the refrigerated area. I waited fifteen minutes, while this couple who were behind me chose their wraps, chatted, giggled, and the Daily Bread woman took no notice of me.Finally the manager came and said who is next and I said, \"I am\", and she said to the girl, \"What's going on\" and the girl just shrugged and got away with it!Anyway, of course I will still come here, but they seem to have amateurs who know nothing about the food or the ethnic origin of it, and that saddens me. The food is outstanding, but I wish the service was like it used to be and I wish the servers weren't rude. They never used to be.

The menu is basic Middle Eastern/Mediterranean - your kafta, shawarma, kibbeh, falafel, tabouleh, hummus. Most of these come in either a sandwich, or in platter form with the inclusion of a pita. I don't know enough to claim whether this is \"authentic, relevant\" Middle Eastern cuisine or not, but it stacks up well against other area falafel flophouses. My favorite is the shawarma pita, with its moist, flavorful slow-roasted beef. I'm going to subtract a star because I always end up paying just that little bit more than I feel my lunch here is worth.

The place was a little dead and more sad-looking than I had remembered, but my focus was on that delectable shawarma meat that was on a stick in the back.To my surprise, instead of slicing the meat, the lady behind the counter pulled out a small plastic container with shawarma inside of it from the glass encasing in the front. I thought to myself that this must be a more efficient way for them to serve a bunch of customers, but like I mentioned - the place was dead.To further my surprise, she stuck the plastic container with pre-filled shawarma meat inside the microwave and blasted it.With a sad, resigned face, I watch her make my sandwich with microwaved stuff.I paid, sat at a table and ate extremely dried out shawarma.

Creamy without being too overbearing like tzatziki can sometimes be if the yogurt used is overly tangy. The lamb is forever fresh, which is an impossibility because you know they're not back there roasting lamb all the livelong day. I don't know what they do, but whether they just carved it or it's been sitting there for hours, it tastes like they just spilled the blood of the lamb all through the meadow.Too religious a reference?The only knock on this place, the knock that necessitated my giving it four stars and not five, is that I've often shown up to find that they weren't offering gyros. Now, that's not to say that there aren't copious other selections that will tickle your belly button, but when you go to a restaurant (or anywhere, really) for a certain something only to find that it's not being offered, you leave a little disappointed.Still, I'll keep coming back so long as that princess keeps getting in trouble."], ["Hugo B.", "As I work everday , as I struggle for my pursuit of happiness , I always enjoy the moment that I step into daily bread.

This is absolute must for an appetizer and great to share w two people.The three kings comes w hummus, chicken, kafta kabob - and this Armenian kabob. Wow that Armenian kabob! Spicy tandoor kinda taste in a super well cooked kabob. The chicken and kafta are super well cooked all the time over a bed of almond rice. It's a great lunch or dinner that's not the same Peruvian food/ burger joint etc.check this place out tonight!"], ["Metin A.", "I really like this place they make good stuff for my taste,delivery is fast good is warm.I have never been there usually ordering to go and better than Pasha brickell period.They have a little bit of everything,rice is really good by the way.Recommended."], ["Vanessa O.", "I am a regular at this place. If you would like to indulge into REAL good Mediterranean food; this is the place. Fresh awesome fattoush salad, hummus, falafels EVERYTHING is good.

In what world...liars never succeed, especially when your service sucks to begin with"], ["Jose S.", "I loved eating food from here.. UNTIL TODAY! Placed an order for delivery through the Eat24 app at 6:58pm thinking that in about an hour, as they say (45-60min delivery estimate) I was going to be eating my usual Indian Beef Kabob.Well, an hour later I tried contacting them through the app since the time was up, they said delivery guy was on its way and should be there in about 5 mins or less! 1hour and 15min later, had to call directly to the restaurant to see what was going on and of course they were like \"I'm sorry about that, let me call the delivery guy and I'll call you back\". By this time I was getting mad.I waited 15 mins without a call back, so called them again.. \"I'm sorry, we've been pretty busy today but your food it's out for delivery and should be there any time soon\". At this point I'm already like \"Dude! That's not what I paid for, but still willing to wait maybe another 15mins\" (I'm such a nice guy), I was hungry and about to get Hangry.Oh and the lady after talking with her for the 4th time she pretty much said to me \"there's only one delivery guy for all the orders, it is what it is\"... :OLike if I HAD to wait because I've already paid with my CC.Anyways.. To make it short, waited a total amount of 2 and 1/2 hours for the food I ordered, called them to cancel it and the manager still has the balls to tell me \"I'm sorry for the delay blah blah blah I can give you 20% off for your next order\". No thanks, I already called Eat24 to cancel the order, this is unbelievable! And he goes \"I'll tell you something, if you don't like the food and if the food it's not warm (REALLY?!?!? After 2 hours) I will give you your money back.... Yeah, right! My answer was pretty calmed and educated: \"I understand how busy you can be but it's not my problem if you have only one guy for all the delivery orders, so please cancel it or I will have Eat24 do it for you\". OF COURSE, I had to make one last call to Eat24 since he wouldn't work with me.After I cancelled it, on my way to Mc Donald's (yeah, had to eat crap because of this BS) the manager calls me offering 50% off. Again, NO THANKS!And just before ordering my food at Mc Donald's, the delivery guy finally called \"hey I'm here with your food\". They were still trying to give me cold food that was cruising around Miami for TWO HOURS AND A HALF, just so they won't lose a sale.\"You can go back to the rest, I already cancelled. Thanks\"And then once again, the manager calls me back again saying that he gets me and he's very ashamed but \"threatening\" me that if I don't get my food, they can ask for my cc information to charge me because \"I did placed an order with them\"... And that's what they call \"Customer Service\"..For real man, learn how to manage your own business or if not, at least do not offer delivery service if you're short of employees and you're going to send the guy with 4+ orders I'm guessing, KNOWING that he won't get there on time... So then the poor guy won't get tips because of YOU! HONESTLY, Get your Sh*t back together...Ps: I'm rating only one (1) star because I have no choice .l."], ["Parita K.", "I bought a Groupon ($20 for $40 of food) a month or so ago and finally had the chance to try out The Baklava Factory this past weekend. \u00a0Overall, my husband and I loved it and will be back. \u00a0Don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you. \u00a0While it's not a 5 star place, the simplicity and casual ambiance make it just right for a fun meal out.Our server was very nice and gave us lots of suggestions. \u00a0He was super helpful when there was a mix up with our order and even offered to give us something else to make up for it. \u00a0The food was very good. \u00a0I ordered the vegetable platter and loved every bit of it. \u00a0 One tip - if you are a vegetarian ordering this platter, ask for vegetarian grape leaves. \u00a0My husband ordered the 3 kings platter and said that the meat was very flavorful and moist. \u00a0We also ordered the potatoes to share and thought they were perfectly cooked and spiced."], ["John D.", "I've had two lunches there and one dinner. \u00a0Excellent food, and a great mix. Both lunches we ordered a Baklava appetizer plate and then a Chinese fish entre from Chinois/Chinois, which is in the same space -- Middle Eastern and Chinese together at last -- and why not?

Really good but with a name like Baklava Factory do not expect made from scratch..."], ["Sureya S.", "I've been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. The hummus is amazing.

This has no reflection on Baklava Factory but the location on the corner of the Coral Way Plaza has had no less than 6 businesses in 3 years.I hope BF will change that trend because it is good ! I tend to judge places more on service and atmosphere than food. What I liked right away is that employees - welcomed me and asked me had I been to here or their other location before - when I answered NO - but iI wanted to try something new - I was offered enough samples of things that I could have made a meal just from that.After my snacks, I settled on a Mediterranean Panini - strange mixed of name for a really great sandwich that was more like a juicy garlic chicken salad on sweet Pita bread - MMmmmm MMmmm good.I also had an assortment of cookies and snacks to share with my clients - just check out the pictures.And Bonus - the have outdoor seating and WIFI and being that they across from the BEST SPINNING Facility in All of Miami , I an see myself going there after class soon.They have Lebanese Soda and drinks too not sure how healthy they are but they looked tasty - even though one looked like it was wheat flavored ? but Maybe Shakira and Carla drink it and that's how they look so good ????"], ["Mona K.", "My dad and I were in the area and decided to stop by and try some delicious baklava. I was a bit dispointed that they didnt have much variety at the time we got there but they were more then happy to make some for us on the stop. Nevertheless, we did end up having some sweet cheese baklava and pistachios baklava. YUMMY!! We do plan on going back and trying the food!!"], ["Dan S.", "A little confusing to find this place as they are currently under construction and sharing a room with some sushi place. But, can't complain too much given the epic yelp deal that convinced us to dine here while on a road trip. It was our first experience with shawarma and we were asking ourselves why the hell we hadn't tried it before? Didn't realize it was basically a pita stuffed with all kinds of awesomeness including tasty meat! We went on Valentine's day and when we were first seated, it wasn't very busy but a hoard of people came in shortly after and our service suffered because of it. However, I think the manager noticed we had been waiting for some time and offered us free Baklava. Good move because we ended up buying more of it after we had tried it. Baklava is amazing no matter where you eat it, but this was exceptionally so."], ["Al K.", "The armenian Sujuk sandwich is good and I've been ordering it regularly for a couple of months.Unfortunately, my girlfriend just found a (used) metal staple in the beef sujuk platter today, which raises questions about the kitchen. We received a refund for the sandwiches.note: when I initially wrote this review, we had both vomited after eating the sandwiches that day, but I have reason to believe it was unrelated, so I've given a star back to the restaurant."], ["Abdul K.", "Ordered delivery from the Grove Isle Hotel and most of the food is pretty good. I am Middle Eastern, so of course it's nowhere near as good as my family's cooking ;)Kafta - 3 stars (a bit over cooked)Hummus - 3 stars (hard to mess up hummus)Chicken Shawarma - 2 stars (too sour and dry)Baba Ganoush - 2 Stars (no roasted flavor)Rice - 2 Stars (rice was shameful for Middle Eastern!)Garlic sauce - 4 stars (impressive!)Meat portions are kind of skippy too.OK.. the Knafeh was the ABSOLUTE WORST I'VE EVER HAD!It might be one of the worst things I ever put into my mouth!

The place is nice, the beef shawerma is great, the best I've had in Miami actually, and if you get any of the platters it's a lot of food (choice of salad, choice of hummus or baba ghanoush, and bread and rice with all). I recommend the fatoush salad and hummus. Upon tasting the fatoush, I concluded the Arab food is authentic. I was a little worried it wouldn't be seeing that Chinese food is also served. I didn't try the so called \"Chinois Chinois\" menu. I used the Yelp deal which just made things sweeter. Good experience overall."], ["Jessica C.", "Mmmm.... Yummy pita. We came here because of the yelp deal, but were very happy with the place. It was tricky finding it since it is really part of chinois chinois. Service was amazing \u00a0and prompt.

I've searched far and wide for kibbeh like hers and the perfectly \"lemonized\" tabouleh she used to make. From the minute they brought out my chicken kebob platter at Baklava Factory, I knew I was home. The dish came with labna (soft Lebanese cheese), hummus, pita, sliced pickles, and some of the most wonderful tabouleh I've tasted outside of my grandmother's kitchen. All of the ingredients were on point and the chicken was seasoned and cooked beautifully. The presentation here is great too: hummus artistically smeared on the plate, topped with a little olive oil and sprinkles of parsley everywhere. All of this for $10! It was a gift. The restaurant has FREE parking in the lot beside it. The interior is decorated simply and contemporary: flat screens showing Egyptian music videos, wooden tables and chairs, a long bar for single diners, and an open bakery station where fresh baklava is being made. The service is good and generally speedy so it makes for a great lunch spot, if you work close by. Give this place a try, habibi!"], ["Ron S.", "OUTSTANDING Lebanese food AND among the best Chinese food in the area as well (I know - don't ask)! The owner is usually on premises and the food is always excellent.

Do they slaughter during the day? Odd."], ["Iamafoodie M.", "But for the price, the food , the place, the service, the surrounding area was just fabulous. Though I had a yelp deal $20 for $40, this is just a warning for people who go there without deals/coupons. The food was awesome and the waitress helped us choose the best possible dish (Stuffed Grape leaves,Grilled Chicken platter with hummus, garlic dip, Fatoush salad and rice)- my first time at Mediterranean food. The chicken kabob was delicious, which we ordered more for $3 per stick (5 pieces). We sat in the adjoining Chinese restaurant as this place had just 1 table! The dessert - Baklava was awesome! They had 6 varieties of baklava. It totaled out to be $33 and we added 10 more Baklavas for a to go! \u00a0The service by the lady was just so good.
