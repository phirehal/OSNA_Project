Let me tell you that it is hard to hold a 4.5 star ranking, especially with over 30 reviews, so my friend and I felt the urge to hop into her Corolla and drive here for dinner. What did we have to lose? We found out that the restaurant was located at the shopping center we also pass by on our way to the Turnpike, so as we parked, we wondered if we really wanted to eat here.Good thing we didn't listen to our instincts because although this place is located at a really random shopping center, the service is on-point, and the food is delicious. The servers welcomed us and sat us at the best seat available. They always made sure that we were satisfied and that our water glasses were always filled to the brim. I felt like a part of their family.For dinner, I ordered their duck pho. The meat was tender. The vegetables were aplenty. The soup was flavorful, and the noodles were the right portion. For those who don't know, pho is my favorite Vietnamese dish ever. It's a popular street dish in Vietnam that consists of broth, noodles, and meat. They give you a huge plate of veggies, and you can stick as much greens as you want. At Kam Wah, they offer you authentic and fresh veggies. Also, the sauces that are on the table are spicy, so beware because after a few pinches of chili pepper and a few drops of red sauce, your food might be unable to eat, but if you like spice go ahead! It is delicious and a culinary experience, after all.My friend ordered appetizers of pad thai and gyoza which were done in only 10 minutes. I wish they had brought everything together at once because they brought my food 10 minutes afterwards, and by the time I had my food, my friend was done. FYI, their appetizers looked good, taste good, and come in good portions.Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to eat here.

We were staying at the Mutiny for my wedding at the Women's Club. The scenery around the pool was great. The hotel guests are very respectful of your event.

We've had a beef curry hereon a different night that was decent but nothing special. This review is more on the Mutiny and their lack of acceptable service than it is on Atchana.

This place is really an outdoor dining experience. The inside is small and very hotel bar like. When you step outside to the pool deck you get to bask in the warm Miami sun, take in the beautiful koi pond, and catch a glimpse of the boats in the bay across the street (I sat up next to the koi pond). My food was good. I ordered the volcanic tofu with white rice. Deliciously fried tofu in a hot sauce and a nice (albeit soggy) pile of rice. My only grip about the food was it was pricey at $13 for rice and tofu. The service was a bit inconsistent but it was too beautiful of a day to get upset about it. It was little things like a refill on the water or asking for a condiment that never came. I imagined the kitchen was busy because they were hosting some banquet/meeting. To their credit they made it right but offering a complimentary coffee/tea at the end so I'm not holding a grudge.If you're staying at the hotel, check out this place."], ["Tiffany K.", "On a recent trip in Miami, I stayed at the Mutiny Hotel, which houses Atchana's East West Kitchen. We decided to have breakfast here one morning since it was in our hotel, and was a convenient choice. The atmosphere and setup of the restaurant is something I liked a lot - simple, clean, semi upscale, overlooking the hotel's pool. The food here is expensive, but what can you expect when dining in a hotel. Most of us ordered breakfast, which ended up being very good. I ordered the omelet and I liked that you could choose as many toppings as you liked. Also, the breakfast plates were presented very nicely - it's rare that I get my eggs and hash browns so neatly and visually pleasing. One of my friend's did get fried rice, which is more relative to their Thai cuisine. I didn't get to try it, but she loved it.The only complaint we had towards the restaurant was the service. When we got down to the restaurant, there was only one person on staff. We stood at the front of the restaurant, and finally a couple minutes later, she popped out and told us to just grab some menus and sit down. After sitting, it took her awhile to come get our drink orders, and then even longer after that to take our food order. The entire time, she wasn't necessarily rude, but definitely not nice. We were shocked at the service considering we were the only table seated the entire duration that we dined."], ["Eric H.", "Very good, we really like the server Zeus. The spring rolls were incredible, second only to the Little Bee in Asheville. Massamon curry was incredible like Thai Beef Pot Roast in a Coconut sauce. The poolside atmosphere was quite lovely, except for the occasional smoker coming out to foul the air. Interior ambiance wasn't quite as nice, so we're glad we made our decision to dine poolside. Chicken Satay was tasty, but a bit overpriced. We will return on our next trip this way."], ["Vania K.", "This is a small restaurant inside the Mutiny hotel. It is very quiet and has most of it's seating in the bar area (looks like a full bar) and two tables that seat about 5 or 6 just behind the bar area that is more quiet. We were offered seating outside, which is next to the pool, with several more tables, however, we chose to sit inside. There was only one waiter, who I assume doubles as bartender as well. He was very nice and courteous the whole evening...inquiring if we needed service or time, but not too pushy. The food is more Thai than Asian fusion, but has choices like edamame and steamed dumplings as appetizers. The decor is minimal inside, with a bit of Thai flavor outside. We ordered the steam dumplings ($7) to start and a pad woonsen and massaman curry with beef as entrees. The entrees ranged from about $12 to $28 for a chili snapper. Our dishes were about $15 each. The food was good, not over the moon, but definitely good enough to come back, especially with a nice waiter, quiet atmosphere, and reasonable prices."], ["M M.", "If there was an option for no stars, this place would get it. I came here for lunch, and I should've ran out the door when I saw that I was the only one in the restaurant. There was no hostess to greet me. The one waiter on staff awkwardly told me to pick up a menu myself and to sit anywhere. This was strike 1. I sat outside in their outdoor patio. I ordered the steamed chicken dumplings to start, but 2 of the dumplings were ice cold inside. Strike 2. After I finished my lunch and having waited for a good 20 minutes for the lone waiter to come back (granted I was the only one eating there), I actually got up and brought my own plate of leftovers inside to the waiter and asked for my check. Strike 3. I'm not really sure why this place got a lot of positive reviews. The pad thai was mediocre and the spring rolls tasted like they were sitting in the freezer for some time.

I ordered the beef dish, my friends got the yellow chicken and thai noodles. I ate mine and tried their dishes and WOW....I mean WOW ..like \"where have you been all my life\" kind of wow. Even the way rice was served in a common bowl to share was impressive. I think this place is definitely worth a shot if \u00a0a)You like food and b)you can get to coconut grove.

(This is Miami, but rest assured - Bang Bros. is not filming.) You're just witnessing the near-orgiastic delight of Miamians who have discovered Cake Thai Kitchen - \u00a0the best little hole-in-the-wall since Jacalito Taqueria. And because it's a hole-in-the-wall, you'll need to overlook several things: The circa 1976 air-conditioner, which barely cools the place, and drips on you as you walk in. The cheap-fluorescent lighting that highlights your clogged pores as you stare into the mirrored walls like you're in a fucked up horror funhouse. The decidedly eco-unfriendly styrofoam serving plates. The sacrilege of paying an extra $2 for white rice. The spotty-at-times service. But if you're willing to overlook all those things, whooo mama. You're in for a fucking feast. In my humble opinion (on which you should absolutely place an inordinate amount of weight, only because I'm one of like, 10 Asian people in Miami), the Baby Back Ribs with Crispy Garlic Pepper is Cake's crown jewel. It comes out perfectly seared on the outside, and is beautifully seasoned with (what else) garlic, pepper, and probably crack. \u00a0I'll make it even easier for you guys - it's No. 45 on the menu. See how nice I am?Other notable dishes include their Garlic Cabbage with its delicate balance of sweetness and umami; their Five Spice Rice Noodle Spicy Beef Flank Soup (also the name of Dumbfoundead's next hit single); and for those of you who were born unadventurous and just want the mac-and-cheese of Thai food, their Prawn Pad Thai will convince you to give up your first-born.Note: \u00a0Cake does not serve beer or liquor, but all is not lost. Two doors down, there's a little-ass craft beer brewery/store, run by a little-ass guy who is almost psychic in his beer recommendations. You can buy a single beer (or five, natch) and take it with you to Cake.In closing, this place is the shit. My only fear is that Cake will soon win a New Times award (if they haven't already), and move away from my 'hood and into Wynwood, the better to be overrun by hipsters on their way home from an Urban Outfitters shopping binge. (Don't worry, Cake. If you relocate, I'll still love you forever and ever.

Everything from the experience to the food was a big swing and a miss. We went on a Friday night with a group of five people. Not too big of a group, you might think, but upon arrival, and realizing how small the place was, and seeing how packed it was, we decided, ok, we'll just get it to go and eat it at home. My girlfriend and I ordered Tom Kha chicken soup, pineapple fried rice and tiger prawn pad Thai. We were told 20 minutes, which is a perfectly acceptable waiting period. Minimum, it was 45 minutes, but I'm fairly certain it was closer to an hour. No, I never complained once, because I don't like to complain to people preparing my food. If we hadn't already paid for the food, we absolutely would have just left and gone somewhere else. Look, I know you want my business and you don't want me to go somewhere else, but if you're honest and tell me \"Look, just so you know, we're super busy and backed up, so it will be like an hour for your take out order,\" not only am I going to be impressed and appreciative you warned me, but the allure and desire to come back and try this in demand food becomes even higher. Finally getting our food home, the disappointment didn't stop. \u00a0First off, ALL of the food was lukewarm, making me question how long it sat around before we even picked it up and took it home. The Tom Kha soup was super acidic. The pineapple fried rice was not bad, besides just being tepid. But, the tiger prawn pad Thai was pretty unappealing. It came out of the container congealed together in big clumps, like it just came out of the refrigerator. The noodles were crunchy. I was nervous to even eat the shrimp at that point, but as it had been about 10 hours since I last ate, and my stomach was caving in on itself like a dying star, I inhaled everything before my brain could process how unappetizing the food actually was. You burned me, Cake Thai Kitchen. And not with your food's temperature or spiciness. With your false promises and lack of apologies for the insanely long wait.

The food was okay, I ate it because I was hungry, not because it was out of this world. I'm not sure if I would come again. I had a few sips of the Tom Kha Soup and it had so many bones and lemon grass stalks in it that I could barely see any edible chicken or mushrooms that were supposed to be there. It was not the best Tom Kha I've had...The food preparation was quick. Once the delivery girl that got an attitude with me every time I asked a question about the menu left, the short wait was bearable and the restaurant seemed okay.

Our other dish was the Spicy Pork Shoulder and Roasted Rice, unfortunately we did not get the rice instead cabbage. The \u00a0lime and cilantro in the pork gave us a ceviche like taste.

Grabbed a table at Sushi Siam, also a couple of doors down and with enough seats for 5 and vowed to come back later. \u00a0I will say it was kind of our bad for listening to our friend who had eaten there before and failed to acknowledge that cake is more of a two and three seater affair. \u00a0Take out seemed like a good idea instead but we weren't the only ones waiting. \u00a0It's a typical take out set up but doesn't appear to be prepared for a high volume of orders. \u00a0Prices were fair, delivery is 3 bucks but when you get your noodle dish, it's going to come out of the tin like it's been in the fridge overnight; all stuck together. \u00a0I don't suggest the pad Thai tiger prawn but the pineapple rice was ok. Also, to the guy who told us we must get the soup. No. No we shouldn't. It was incredibly lemony and we didn't take more than a couple of spoonfuls before we said no more. \u00a0And we were starving by the time the food was up. \u00a0Seriously, we made a pact that night. \u00a0When the best Taco Bell in town is right there on 79th street, just go there. \u00a0In the end I have only myself to blame for this experience. \u00a0A Miami New Times review was taped to the window, which should have been my first clue that I should skip it. \u00a0Sorry MNT, but you guys ruin everything."], ["Gillian B.", "Best Thai food I've had since Thailand!

The egg was pickled for the right amount of time.

It was not too fatty and the flavors and seasoning were absolutely delicious. Every bite tasted like a hot treasure in my mouth. I don't even know what that means. I also ordered the Thai omelet and rice (I added pork) out of curiosity. I'm not sure if its supposed to be that way, but the eggs were VERY salty. Also, they forgot the pork (but still charged me for it).If you do order the pork belly, I would recommend ordering a side or rice.

The portions are large and I was stoked I got to take some home so I could eat the next day. My boyfriend got the Royal Thai Special Fried Rice which comes with chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and plenty other goodies. He couldn't stop eating either, but the only reason I'm giving Royal Thai 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fried rice. He asked for no pork (this wasn't the problem), but only got two shrimps in his dish.

Everyone enjoyed it without complaint. For the main dish I ordered shrimp Panang curry. It was quite good but there is one other location that I've been to that did the Panang a bit better. Nonetheless it may have been my fault as the spice scale here was different from other places and I may have ordered it too spicy. Either way, it was fresh and you could tell that the shrimp was fresh and they were of very good size unlike other places that you have to search for the shrimp.

At that time, we asked what was taking so long because from the moment we arrived until then, more than 10 tables were seated and served!!! The waiter simply shrugged his shoulders at us in dismissal. At the point, we got up and left. My one and only previous experience at Lotus Garden was not a good one either.

The bus boy took our drink order promptly only to come back a few minutes later to announce they had no sake. Okay, a little disappointed but no big deal, we had a beer instead. Shortly after the drinks were delivered, the owner himself came to take our order. We ordered an appetizer, a soup, and three entrees. The appetizer and the soup took an hour to arrive. I asked the server twice about it and twice she said it would only be two minutes. Longest two minutes ever!!! In the meantime, we were not asked if we cared for another drink and water glasses were never refilled until asked. When the owner took my order, I asked for brown rice yet over an hour later and no sign of entrees, he came back to ask me again. Really? You took my order well over an hour ago and now you are going to ask me which type of rice I ordered? The food might be consistently good but the service and attention to detail is well below average. I will never eat here again but I will continue to order takeout.

The key lime sauce drizzled atop the roll is deliciously tart. I love anything key lime and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the tartness fit with the sushi. The Heat roll was okay. It was not spicy enough for my liking. The roll itself lacked much flavor and the spicy mayo drizzled on top only remotely added some of the described spiciness. The Baby Octopus was something I ordered on a whim since not a lot of places still offer it. It was alright. It was chewy, flavor was mediocre, not as special as I had hoped.I've definitely had better grade sushi so I am being critical in regards to the quality of the sushi. It's probably only one rung above the sushi that Publix sells next door. Considering that it's also pretty expensive, I was expecting something better. What I did really enjoy was the Thai Tea!

As an FIU student I found it to be close to home, delicious, and though a little pricey (they use real blue crab instead of imitation crab meat), well worth it. Especially with the FIU student discount.Their lunch menu is fantastic because it has a few simple rolls and great prices. I'm an eel fan, so I always order their simple BBQ eel roll with another specialty roll. The best tempura roll ever lives up to it's name, though they rival it with their own crunchy roll, which is also fantastic. The Keys crab roll (I think) is super good. It has fried crab and is drizzled in a tangy key lime sauce. There is a roll there also, that is absolutely ridiculously amazing. It's expensive, like $17 or something, but if you're splitting the bill with a friend, it's worth it. It's loaded with all kinds of goodies. A must try!Every time I go I order a Thai Iced Tea, which is super yummy and really different than what I've had most places. I was going here so often last semester \u00a0(3 times a week) that the manager (who was always amazing) started giving me free refills on what is over $3 normally for each. The customer service is always great and the environment is cozy and relaxing.I always recommend this place to my friends because I've had nothing but good experiences there.

After living really close to a great Sushi place that delivered, i desperatelyneeded to find a Sushi place in this neighborhood ASAP! The first time I tried their food, i only picked up. I tried their Tuna Ta Taki, and it was really fresh and delicious! My girl friend tried their Shrimp Shumai. Second time, we went on a Sunday. We were the only ones in there, but I didnt mind. It was a stressful weekend after moving- and really liked that we had the place all to ourselves! The manager greeted us immediately, took our order, and when our order came out- I was beyond impressed! I ordered the Red Dragon Roll.... Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious! If you dont like spicy, dont order it! It was fresh and very beautifully prepared. I dont remember what my girlfriend had, but it was also delicious!

I only came here because I was craving Pad Thai and didn't want to go too far or go to a chain, so I discovered this place. It is tiny, somewhat hard to find and a hole in the wall. The Paid Thai is incredible. Cooked to perfection every single time, and the Sushi is also excellent. I never liked Sushi until I came here. I actually was very picky about raw fish, seaweed, and even shrimp (I know, how could I like Sushi?) but the waiter who helped us was very patient with us, answering my every question even going so far as to offer us Soy paper instead of seaweed. My first time ordering Sushi here, my boyfriend and I shared the Godzilla's Meltdown roll (LITERALLY the best thing on the entire sushi menu, I order it EVERY time now). It has shrimp tempura inside, with cream cheese, crab, and avocado. Spread all over the top is cooked seafood (a mixure of crab and whatever fresh fish they have), eel sauce and spicy mustard. It is literally the best thing I've ever had. Recently, I also order a Key West roll which was also really delicious.The place is a little on the pricey side. However I do not by any means think its expensive for the quality of food I am getting. I don't mind waiting for my food here either because I know it is always fresh. The Chicken Pad Thai ran me about $14 (standard to any chain & much better quality) and the Godzilla's Meltdown is $18 (comes with 10 rolls & ridiculously filling). They have an entire menu of specialty rolls, as well as an entire thai menu & other rolls.All in all, I will continue to come here on a regular basis & recommend this place to anyone I know.

WAS. SPICY. \u00a0Practically inedible-Spicy. \u00a0I ate it all, but I crapped my guts out after. \u00a0With Thai food, you're not supposed to crap your guts out after-- that's sports bar fodder.Next time I went, I had it Medium, and it was perfect. \u00a0With a side of green salad and sake. \u00a0 You got yourself a dinner. \u00a0I shared the plate with my girlfriend but we ate fine. \u00a0It was awesome.All in all: don't try their sushi but totes try the Thai."], ["Christopher M.", "Place has okay Thai food.

The red curry was decent, nothing special, though we asked for mild spicey and i thought my mouth was on fire when i tried it, i can only imagine how spicey it is if you order it not mild. 1 star deduction for blasting hiphop, which was unusual considering the waitress was an older lady and the sushi chef was an older dude :)"], ["Lorena C.", "If I knew I had Thai donuts so close to home I would have visited earlier.

The dishes range from the more familiar Pad Thai to the more exotic Nam Prik Ong. It all smells amazing in here! My girlfriend and I didn't have to wait too long for seats at the counter. While we waited we perused the menu and made \"oooh and aaahh\" sounds as each dish was plated and served to the awaiting patrons. After sitting down and placing our order, it wasn't long before plates of shrimp and pork dumplings, crispy spring rolls, and shrimp pad thai, were placed in front of us.

When my hubby and I originally went to the location, the food was excellent, fresh hot and authentic. Not as spicy as we would've like but we were okay since they provided the thai chili powder. On the last two occasions that we have had delivery we have been disappointed. First of all, we sent our friends there, and they stated that there were a few dishes they were \" out of\". The last time we ordered delivery they stated they were out of the pork dumplings. Now I can understand this, because it's a popular item, and I'm assuming pre-prepared for the day.On saturday I decided to order in food at a decent hour, earlier than usual dinner time, around 5:15pm because I didn't want to run into the same problem. I had decided to order the north thai dish Prik. I got called back from postmates that they are\" out of it\". How can you be out of a dish that should be cooked fresh in the wok at 5pm on saturday and your restaurant is open until 2am???On top of that when asked to replace it, they gave soggy papaya salad, which was spicy, but definitely not the same price, nor meat!The shrimp dumpling and the chicken wings were cold and soggy.The Jungle rice did not taste like the last time at all, and we have eaten it twice, it had too much salt and did not have the jungle flavor and it was mild.The Khai Soi Gai- noodles were soggy, and it was sweet!Grilled pork skewer were okay, a bit chewy.I emphasized to make it extra extra thai spicy hot and even stated to let the restaurant know that we are Indian and can handle the heat!After paying $85 for very small portions, cold food not done spicy the way we wanted we were very disappointed.At this price point, I expect better quality, consistency in the dishes, and appropriate portions. You can't call it tapas, give tapas portions for family style cooking then charge this much!

There's nothing worse than being served 3 portions of pad Thai in one plate, and Chef Bas understands that. My favorites so far have been the Pad Thai shrimp!

It was like a tempura battered mushroom fritter. It was good although fried things aren't my favorite. \u00a0 \u00a0 Next, we shared the chicken panang curry. This was delicious. It was much more flavorful and better quality than what I've had in other Thai places. I highly recommend this dish. We also shared the Jungle Fried Rice with chicken. They let you add spice to the fried rice, but other than that, it was what you would expect from fried rice. It was good..I just didn't get the \"jungle\" flavor or whatever inspired the name. I would have tried another dish, but they make you order everything at once when you sit down. I didn't know the portions would be a little smaller than I expected. The space:I docked a star because this place is tiny. I can't imagine what a pain it must be to have to wait for a seat because there really isn't anywhere to wait (stand around on the sidewalk?). They have some outdoor tables, but it's just too dang hot to eat spicy Thai & sit outside. Also, if you sit inside, you have to sit at the bar. There aren't any tables inside.

The Khao Man Gai is tasty and the rice alone is very flavorful; found it charming that the chef explained to season the dish with the fermented soy sauce and to taste the cucumber after a bite of the chicken and rice.

I'm just going to echo the sentiments of all the other reviewers: this is great new spot that's serving up some fantastic, no-fuss food. Miami needs more \"gourmet fast food\" eateries that don't break the bank. This is the best Thai place I've been to in recent memory and it's run by the same team that runs Bonding. It's more reminiscent of somewhere you'd find in Wynwood rather than in Little Havana, but hey, anything's possible. It's small but inviting, with bar-style seating that gives you the pleasure of watching the chef cook all the dishes in front of you. Come for lunch when there's no wait (yet)!The food speaks for itself. I recommend everything I've tried here so far, including: crispy spring rolls, panang curry (great for those who prefer sweeter curries), pad kee moa with chicken, and steamed sticky rice with taro (a dessert wrapped in a fragrant lotus leaf, served warm. Must try!)Two thumbs up for Chef Bas and his team on an awesome new restaurant!!!"], ["M S.", "Literally the best Thai I've ever had and I've had Thai in almost every major city of the US.

I had the pork dumplings, the Chef's Recommendation - Khao soi gai (freshest egg noodles in the history of mankind, balance of taste was perfect), and tried the complimentary pork jerky. Now I'm no foodie (who says that?), but let me tell you...everything was (hashtag) THE BOMB!I just texteded my cousin (my real one), who IS a food/travel snob and is always talking about how the Khao soi in Thailand is all esto y lo otro [sic].

A line started to form at the door since there was no space inside. Seeing that there was a quaint area outside with over half a dozen tables, we asked the owner if we could be seated outside. Without barely acknowledging us, he said \"no\" and turned his back on us. Apparently they are understaffed and only open the outside area on weekends. This is perfectly understandable, but giving your back to new customers is not a great way to lure new business. Simply saying, \"I am sorry, but we do not offer outdoor seating on weekdays,\" would have sufficed.

I had the Pad Woon Sen with vegetables plus shrimp and my boyfriend had the Pad See Ew with beef. Both were tasty, fresh, and a perfect portion.

I certainly ate more than I could handle, and don't regret it a bit. I solemnly swear to one day memorize and differentiate all the wonderful dishes that begin 'k' ; \u00a0but this was not the day. One dish I'll never forget how to pronounce (I hate simply reading out the English translations to the waiter; I reckon it's near-sacrilegious with food so heavenly as thai cuisine) is the 'khao phat' - fried rice. I especially enjoyed the 'khao phat American ('American fried rice); I would've substituted the ketchup for BBQ, but it was tasty anyway. Overall grade: 4 stars; to be quite honest, I was shocked at the horrible service; usually the one wait staff that can rival the Japanese are the Thais, but Asian Thai Kitchen has room for improvement- yet it's not in the food. \u00a0But the food is what makes it a worthy of a place on your bucket list."], ["Tina V.", "Ok so i order delivery from here and the prices are decent for Miami. \u00a0Portion is small but omg i got to say it is one of the few asian restaurant to execute good spicy thai food. \u00a0I was soo amazed and it was good. \u00a0One dish was a little heavy on the sauce but it was still good and the apps were a miss but the others were delicious. \u00a0agedashi tofu (2/5) least favorite, tofu was bland and the true fried tofuBeef satay (2/5) another least favorite Drunken noodles w/beef - med spicy (5/5) its was on point, reminded me of good asian food back in CA.

However, the food is \"ok\" at best unfortunately. While the Tom Kha Gai (spicy coconut milk shrimp soup) was pretty good, the Pad Thai and the curry were mediocre and a bit bland. An issue is I think it's all very Americanized, to the point where a lot of the unique, special \"zing\" of true Thai food is lost. As an indication of just how westernized the cuisine is, I asked for Lard Nar; the first waiter didn't even know what that was. When I got to a very friendly person who did know, she was very frank in telling me that it was Thai for americans -- hence the lack of a common dish.I generally only review restaurants if I feel they were good, or really bad to warn people. This isn't really bad.But when a \"Thai\" restaurant is being presented as authentic, and isn't, diners should probably be given a heads-up.

All the vegetables and salads are crisp and fresh. Everything is great here, it just depends what you're in the mood for. Service is very friendly and attentive. Sunshine (the owner) is almost always at the restaurant, and he told me that his mom (who I met there as well) does most of the cooking- which explains why it's so good, like homemade.

Both were served with a spring roll (YUM) and a soup - but being the picky pains in the ass that we are we upgraded for their wonton soup which was amazing. It had little chunks of roasted garlic in in and was so tasty and delicious. It gave our favorite thai place's wonton soup a run for their money, and we've been having a mental Bobby Flay Throwdown amongst ourselves searching for an adequate competitor.

I had chicken and broccoli. They gave a total of 4 pieces of broccoli and the pad see EW was overly sweet after two bites you are overpowered by the sweetness you no longer desire for more. The fried rice that came with the meal was undercooked and the service was super slow. I have tried many different Thai restaurants and this is by far one of the worst Thai food I have ever had."], ["Val B.", "Great service and very friendly. They take real care in packing to go orders. Crispy duck, volcano fried fish, and papaya salad are fantastic. The sauces that come with the duck and fish are amazing.

In addition to Thai, some Vietnamese dishes are served. I haven't sampled these but plan to in the near future."], ["Rudy C.", "This place gets better and better every time I eat here. The owner's are really nice and the service is top notch. The food is good. I've eaten here through three different owners, and the owners now are the best.The best part about Siam Bistro is that their lunch menu runs through Saturday. For a kid that plays basketball in the morning, I am extremely hungry afterwards. My friends and I came here one Saturday after playing a few games and we went to town. We each ordered soup. My favorite is their version of Bo Bun Hue, which is spicy lemongrass soup, with grilled steak. We also ordered a meal to go with the soup. The lunch menu comes with spring roll, and a small soup of the day. The three of as basically order two meals, so we got soup and two egg-rolls each.I have to mention the solid waitress because she is really good, very fast and consistent with asking if we need anything or refilling our drinks. The time my friends sat down there was only 1 table filled. As a few minutes past more and more groups came, but she was consistent and timely with water and the food for everyone.Siam Bistro is never packed but has constant regulars that pass through. So if you are looking for good food and if you are around the area, stop by because you will probably get a table as soon as you step through the door. They also make a very good fired ice cream.I'm always happy eating here."], ["Kenny L.", "Masaman curry duck is great."], ["Sandra S.", "Awesome place!!!We have been coming to this restaurant for years.

This helps since they have updated the menu, combining items together rather than the old Thai menu and Vietnamese menu.The food is still exceptional and I can now highly recommend the Pad King and the Pad Gratium for fans of stir fry, as well as the entertaining Volcano Chicken.I still recommend ordering your food medium, and then asking for the spice carousel to add the perfect amount of heat.

There is nothing quite like it it is seriously incredible. \u00a0The dumplings are also delicious, and although I haven't tried it (because I never stray away from the curry) my friends are all obsessed with how good the pad thai is here.

LOVED IT!"], ["Michelle W.", "YUM!!!! I just literally walked out of this place from lunch and I'm so fat and happy I need a food coma. I recommend this place for lunch because they have awesome lunch specials!! You get soup, a spring roll and your meal. Prices start at $6.95. I ordered a Thai iced tea which was wonderful with all it's evaporated milk goodness (by the way, try this if you never have. It's a very unusual taste, but if you like spicy food it will put the fire out on your tongue so you can eat more!). The soup was your standard cabbage Thai soup with just the right amount of green onion, my spring roll was freshly deep fried, crispy, had a nice touch of black pepper & burnt my tongue in my zeal to eat it. My main dish I ordered the Masaman curry with tofu. It was excellent. The dish is a yellow curry with coconut milk, potato, onion, cashews & your choice of meat - I picked tofu. Everything was cooked to the perfect texture. I just wish I would have gotten it a little more spicy. I usually go for medium on my first try somewhere and go from there. Next time I'll go hot. The service was quick and their politeness reminded me of when I was in Thailand. I could only finish about half of my curry because of the soup & spring roll and they were so worried something was wrong. I had to assure 3 people that I was just full! So, I am happy to have my left overs in the fridge for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait to go back and try more things.

That place was awesome!"], ["Jorge M.", "Local Thai restaurant in Kendal.Located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. Has a Thai decor inside with plenty of tables and chairs.

There was an hour wait, so we decided to get takeout.We both ordered the roasted duck darling (14.95). The price is pretty good for half a duck and the portion was decent enough. The vegetables portion was large and really covered up the duck, making the duck portion look kind of small. Will definitely have to try and get a seat next time at this place.

I ordered 3stars... both my Thai expert and the waitress suggested I do 2 stars because they thought I could not handle it... Uh hello! CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!

The oriental lion statues guarding the entrance and huge blue sign make it easy to find. As far as aesthetics go, SS was as pleasing as it could be for being just another hole in a shopping plaza. It's fairly dark on the side with the bar due to a lack of lighting (the used all the bulbs from the roof to decorate the bar) and tinted windows. Not a bad thing necessarily, especially if it's a blind date and he/she isn't very appealing... which wasn't the case for me.I thought the menu was pretty interesting. First time at a thai spot for me - tossing in some Japanese bites in the menu definitely helps ease you into the experience. The prices were a little higher than i was expecting since it isnt in a hot or trendy location, but the moderations were filling so we can look passed the few extra bucks.Waitress was attentative and checked on us many times as we sifted through the endless menu for 15 minutes before finally deciding what to get. Once we ordered, the appetizer (seaweed salad) came out fairly quickly but the sushi and main dishes took quite a while. My date and I are bother pretty boring, so this was almost torturous. We started with a \"seaweed salad\" - what can anyone really say about seaweed salad in general? Salty grass. It definitely wasnt overdone though, we both thought it was done right.Next came an order of \"California eel rolls\". The rolls looked and tasted great, but seemed like they were losely wrapped and difficult to keep together - even with my karate kid style chop stick mastery.About 4 1/2 hours later the main dishes came. I had the \"Chicken pad king\" and i cant recall what my date had. The veggies in my dish were just right and the ginger sauce really made that chicken. My date's dish revolved around a sauce that looked like baby vomit, and it very well could have been, but after a few dips in that sauce it actually started to taste decent. Definitely go with the ginger over anything green though!Overall we thought it was all nicely done and tastey. Something i found odd is that my dish seemed to have a lot more meat in it than my date's, i almost wonder if they cater to size? If so then they got it right. If not then we got lucky.

It can be dangerous, like wanting to eat Thai and Vietnamese every day dangerous.Whenever I try other Thai places, I compare it to sea siam as being my gold standard. Yes, Bangkok Bangkok is good, tani Thai is good, moon is ok... But sea siam is still my n\u00famero uno. I've ordered everything on the menu and their tom kha gai soup is so freaking good, I want some right now. Many times I get the ginger salad and gang dang curry chicken. Best curry I've ever had- aside from Thailand. Let me warn you, if you say Thai hot- they'll give it to you. And you'll be sweating, but it's a good sweat.Last time we sat at the bar with the owner (I think) and drank wine cracking jokes with him. Sometimes he's super dry and sometimes he's loose. That's humankind, can't fault him for it. I digress... So I ordered the Miami vice 2, which is salmon, asparagus and avocado wrapped in cucumber. It was so good, might be my new go-to. It's really light but enough protein to keep me full! Save yourself some time and sit at the bar! No kids there either-- dig it!"], ["Jackie H.", "Although I frequent this restaurant, I must say, it is not out of personal preference. It's more because the family always chooses it, and because it's so close to us. This location can be very loud if visited during busy hours, but at times it can be an enjoyable experience. It really is a \"luck of the draw\" type situation. The food experience has been so-so, mediocre at best. The combination fried rice tasted good, pretty flavorful, but unfortunately very oily to me. Yes, I realize it's fried rice, but it left me with a lip gloss sensation afterword. I'll let you think about that.I enjoyed the beef and chicken satay, it was tender and nicely seasoned with a good balance of curry and coconut milk. But I think for what we got, it was a bit overpriced. For my preference, the miso is too salty and the salad although \u00a0pretty fresh is overdressed, however, these are things that vary from person to person. Lastly, the pad thai was also pretty oily, barely tasted like anything, and the chicken was overcooked and rubbery.The last time I ate sushi there I was highly disappointed. We ordered a double for two, it's a lot of sushi and it takes four of us to finish it. The JB and California rolls were okay, even the Nigiri were okay, but when I reached out for a salmon sashimi*, it just felt and tasted terribly wrong. I was disgusted, and even got goose bumps, but thank goodness I had a napkin in my purse. I had to spit the sashimi out because I felt like if I swallowed it, I would've gotten sick. Ever since then, I've been scared to order sushi again. (*I've had ok tasting sashimi there on previous occasions, but this is not something I like to gamble about)Service Pros: I've had good experiences with service; they try to get to know you, service is quick, and they even try to remember our past orders. On an in between note, one of our waiters messed up our order, but she quickly and happily corrected it. {She picked up the sashimi from the boat, and exchanged it for what we had ordered. I hope they threw it away? *suspense!*}Cons: We have been victim to a random plate or silverware being dirty, but it's nothing that can't be fixed. \u00a0Extra: It might be time for new covers on the booth seats, they're looking a bit weathered down. and they may want to consider re-tiling or deep cleaning the tiles by the sink in the women's bathroom (maybe men's as well?) as they're covered in mildew."], ["Lucy D.", "My husband and I had a late lunch Sea Siam.

For the \u00a0main course, I got something simply, I ordered the pad Thai with pork and my mom ordered the volcano roll. The pad Thai had a nice level of spice, which I liked, but overall I wouldn't order it again. The volcano roll was a disappointment. The topping was over cooked and there really wasn't anything volcano about it. It was actually more of like a really crispy pancake. The roll underneath was pretty good since their take one the roll was with salmon, but still it wasn't what I expected. As far as the service, our server was really nice and attentive, but the wait between the appetizer and the main course was too long.

Was completely arrogant and had a table placed inside so he could eat his lunch in front of them and the customers. The employees are absolutely awesome and kind. I feel bad for them. Will definitely be looking for a new place to get noodles."], ["Johnny T.", "3.5You have to understand: there aren't many options in Downtown to eat 1.) quickly 2.) relatively inexpensively and 3.) without any fuss. Hibachi fills a void. Is it the most authentic, delicious Asian-style cuisine you've ever had? No. Is it decent enough that you'd come back when in need of something other than a sandwich or something greasy? Yes. Hibachi serves up better-than-decent AmericanizedMy go-to at Hibachi (usually later in the evening and, always, take out; the place is too small to sit and eat) was the Singapore noodles with chicken. (Vermicelli) Noodles, peppers, carrots, onion, snow peas, scallions, and egg served in curry sauce... with two packs of sriracha... for $10? Yes, ma'am. I did it. And I would do it again if I lived in Downtown Miami and wanted to eat solo after 10 pm. The noodles, despite the curry, tended to be in the dry side. The sriracha always gave the dish a necessary kick. BUT, no complaints, even despite the dry-ish chicken/noodles. Again, cheap. Accessible. Hot R&B playing every time I came in. Awesome employees who would call me 'baby' in the way that I miss from '90s era NYC/Philly. Realness. Hibachi gives you realness at all times. In the hot, wet swamps of Magic City, USA that's appreciated. You know what you're getting yourself into at Hibachi. Either you're in or you're out."], ["Ute L.", "Ordered a Thai peanut noodle salad and fried cheesecake for delivery. I asked for the peanut dressing on the side, what I got was a dry salad with NO dressing. Thankfully, I was home and able to whip up a quick dressing from rice vinegar, maple syrup and sesame oil. Otherwise, I might have choked on it. I did enjoy the cold rice noodles, which still had a nice bite. The greens were fresh and the chopped peanuts a nice addition. For a mere $3 they throw a 5-6 ounce filet of salmon on top. Unfortunately, my salmon had been cooked to death and was hard as a rock. I ate half of that sorry dry piece of brick, the rest will be re-purposed into some type of fish cake tonight. Hell, it's not like you can overcook it any more. Now, the fried cheesecake. What a positive surprise. Gooey cheesecake wrapped in crispy fried spring roll skins, topped with caramel or honey (?). Simple yet addictive. \u00a0Good enough to maybe give them another shot to see if they get it right next time."], ["Lesly R.", "There was a mix-up between our delivery. The girl answered us with no consolation of our concern and she was steadily finding ways to state it was our fault that our meals was not on time. However, the manager of the restaurant called us personally in order to fix our problem. I see this restaurant as a model of how businesses should behave when there is a problem concerning customer frustration and services."], ["Rene V.", "Beyond excellent...! ! Everything on the menu is outrageous, you cannot go wrong. I eat here with my co-workers at least twice per week."], ["Kirsten T.", "Wow, I can't believe I haven't written about this place before! I live downtown and am pretty familiar with Hibachi. After a long day at work this place is a go to for me because it fairly healthy, delicious and the prices are fabulous!!!! I love the spicy herb noodle and the clear noodle (you can pick your protein). The soups are good but a little small, FYI. The dumplings = awesomeness!!!! The vegetable egg rolls are the way to go, crunchy + warm inside! Plus you have the option of brown rice and they don't go overboard on grease. Score!"], ["Merrell T.", "Maybe we just ordered bad items. \u00a0I had the noodle soup and it was bland and the noodles seemed stale. \u00a0The Thai salad looked cool but seemed like a cafeteria item. \u00a0We also had the pass that which was OK. \u00a0I how the other items on their menu are better cause the soup was just sad"], ["Christina C.", "Service was terrible! My family and I went to have lunch, we were a party of 6 and I guess because gratuity is included they don't need to be polite or courteous. The waitress seemed like we were bothering her. They weren't even busy. She never came to check on us once. We had to flag her down every time. Food was just OK."], ["Justin S.", "After my review the owner called an apologized for the misunderstanding with my order. I thought this was a very nice personal touch. Upon return the food was prompt, hot and delicious."], ["Daniel M.", "Two stars just for the friendly staff. Otherwise, the food was awful."], ["Samuel S.", "I just ordered using the eat 24 app 20 minutes ago, I'm shocked at how fast my food came. Like jimmy johns fast. Delicious, hot, high quality pad Thai and Thai donuts too. Never ordering this cuisine elsewhere again."], ["Ed H.", "Quality of ingredients is very good but the overall consistency every time is what makes it great. \u00a0I live in Brickell and delivery is always fast. \u00a0This food is like benihana on a budget."], ["Jacqueline B.", "First time ordering delivery in downtown. Had the Tofu Pad Thai (my fav dish). Was not impressed. It was extremely dry and the \"thai dressing\" that was mentioned on the menu was very sweet. The noodles and the tofu were sweet. Not what I expected. My co-worker had Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice which was very tasty. The chicken was not dry (as I saw some complaints here), but grilled nicely.Mine was around $10, hers was $12. Pretty typical of downtown these days. Although if you want grilled chicken with rice, Pollo Tropical sells a delicious dish for under $6. Hibachi Grill isn't awful, but it isn't great. I think I'll stick to the Hong Kong Cafe for Chinese delivery."], ["Lory T.", "I work in Biscayne blvd and was in the mood for some Chinese food. This place definitely fulfilled my appetite. I had the orange chicken, fried rice and vegetables. Since I had it delivered, there was an extra $3.00 charge, but i didn't mind because it was delicious and there was enough to take home to my hungry boyfriend. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me, is because they took FOREVER to bring me the food. This fatty right here was about to faint of hunger!"], ["Alexa B.", "This is a fantastic restaurant hiding in plain sight as a mall hibachi joint. \u00a0The service is impeccable, the food delicious and quick, and its all for a very reasonable price. \u00a0Who knew you could find such a great place right downtown? I can't recommend it enough. Oh and I can't forget the portions - huge! My boyfriend and I split one meal usually because they're so big"], ["Jordan C.", "enjoyed my dinner, Pad See Iw (Shrimp) - great flavor! hopefully when I get back to Cali, I'll find something similar to it. #yummy4mytummy"], ["Charlie M.", "Very good. One of the few restaurants in all of Miami that I truly crave. They are spot on, have excellent customer service (Adriana is my favorite, one of the nicest people in miami) I go with my siberian husky twice a month and take all my friends there when we're in downtown."], ["Regina H.", "Mmmm the hibachi here is really good. I've had hibachi shrimp which was so good, it comes with rice, shrimp, zucchini and onions, and white sauce. Everything was good and their delivery is fast. Also just had the spicy herb noodles and they were really good. Good hangover food"], ["Erica L.", "None of the employees nor the customers were Asian, yet the owner has the audacity to tell me and my other two friends (all of us being Chinese or Taiwanese) that someone told him that he has the best Asian food outside of Asia. Are you kidding me?! We asked who told him that, and he said some Dutch people. Well, that's why! Do you really think Dutch people should be the judge of that? Dutch people are not the experts on Asian food. A true test would be to get the opinion of an Asian person. If Asians say it's good, then let's talk.We only came here because we had exhausted the other limited available options around our hotel in downtown Miami, and this was one of the few remaining open places. I ordered the chicken hibachi, and it was definitely not the best like he claimed. The hibachi chicken came with rice, a side of sauteed zucchini and onions, and two sauces. The white meat chicken was extremely dry, and the entire dish was extremely salty. One of the sauces was like a chipotle mayo, and the other was similar to a light, sweet sauce that you would typically eat with tempura. The latter was clumpy and did not complement the dish in any way.The only positive comment I can make about this place is that the portions were bigger than expected. That is all.This place definitely does not have the best Asian food outside of Asia. I would never come here again. The owner needs to stop bragging about the food that he is serving; instead, he should be embarrassed about how far from authentic it is. It was an extremely sad attempt at Asian food, and he should consult some real Asians to help him work on his menu."], ["J. S.", "There was a delay with writing this update, but it wasn't until I received a message from the owner a couple of weeks ago that I've decided to follow up on a negative experience.Two weeks after my negative review, I decided to give Hibachi a second shot. This time, I went and got brown rice/steamed vegetables with tofu -- which was surprisingly very, very good. However, I seemed to not go into following an update (I don't do much updates).That is until I checked my inbox and found a message from the owner of Hibachi. First, let it be known that this guy genuinely cares about his customers. He made it clear to me what his business stands for, and I really had to give the man where credit's due. He was generous to make a courteous remake of the pad thai, and I was thoroughly impressed this time around. I appreciate his business, and more importantly, his appreciation for customers."], ["Rolo T.", "I was pleasantly surprised by a great noodle soup with beef that I got here for lunch. \u00a0This place is a little on the small side (with outdoor seating only), but it seems like a great addition to the neighborhood. \u00a0Can't wait to try some other stuff here soon. \u00a0Location is SE corner of NE 3rd Ave. and NE 1st St."], ["Kshama T.", "Singapore noodles are yummy !"], ["Larry S.", "Not bad, not great.Disappointed by the Shrimp Shumai appetizer - only four small pieces for $3.95. \u00a0There should be six for that price.The Spicy Herb Noodles are not that spicy.I would go back but I would try other dishes and skip the appetizers."], ["Tania H.", "Being sick the last few days I was definitely wanting some nice spicy soup to help my flu like symptoms and I was in the neighborhood so I decided to give it a try. I am very happy with their soup selections. You choose what type of noodle you want and what protein you would like to add - it already comes with base of Cabbage, broccoli, snow peas, scallion, cilantro & lemon. I am definitely ordering from them more often!"], ["Chris C.", "The Wifi is free, and the food was edible.Not quite authentic, but decent. I came here during the late night after UMF. I feel that they did a good job on their take of how Chinese food should be."], ["Jennifer A.", "Customer service was good but the food was not."], ["Larry D.", "The current trend in downtown Miami is toward Asian noodle or Asian Fusion places. I think there are now about four new places that have opened this past year. Hibachi sits just down the road from Ceviche 105, which itself is a good place...but should help with you locating it. There's a tiny area inside to order, but you eat at the tables outside. This place is great for lunch, and I'd guess it's really good for a post-Heat game, being about a four block walk from AAA.It's cheap and the food comes out hot. I like their pad thai, and I've tried the hibachi chicken. This food works. It's filling, hot, spicy as you like and does the trick. During the cool months and cool nights in South Florida, this is one of the many open air places you can now find downtown. Enjoy!"], ["Grant B.", "A decent noodle joint that gets it right about 3 out of 4 times. I like the spicy herb noodles with beef added. I think the Pad Thai is decent, others disagree. As you may gather from the mixed reviews, it can be hit or miss... I live around the corner so they know me and tend to get my orders right. Great hangover food, BTW."], ["Roberto B.", "Just came back from a really fun lunch break with a co-worker and her gal pal who is loads of fun and a top Yelper too! \u00a0We dined and dished at Hibachi which holds its own pretty good in a snug little Avenue whose dance card is filling up pretty fast with new little boutiquey bistro type restaurants - I hope the Landlord(s) are generous so they can stay and really build up a strong clientele. \u00a0As far as Hibachi, it was my recommendation because I had been there before and I am so glad to introduce new faces (who also enjoy food!) to this charming grill and noodle bar. \u00a0Portions are abundant and could actually be shared. Veggies are so fresh you can hear the crispy crunch when you bite in and the soups (which I have yet to try) looked so yummy (maybe it's just the sexy way Natasha slurps a passel of wet noodles) I'm going to have to go back for a bowl myself - thankfully the Miami weather has dropped to the low 70's which requires we pull out our woolies and sweaters and dine on soups and stews so the timing is perfect. \u00a0Speaking of timing, Hibachi is open to midnight so I'm guessing post game time at the American Airlines Arena or a show at the Arsht, you could grab an economical bite of oriental goodness."], ["Mags M.", "I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. \u00a0It took over an hour to be delivered. \u00a0I work across the street about 2 blocks. \u00a0Well, my order came up to $8.99 plus $3.00 for delivery which is fine (most places in Downtown Miami deliver for free but beside the point). \u00a0After 30 minutes I called to see the status of my order. \u00a0The lady sound confused so she put on the manager. \u00a0He took my information and said he will get in contact with the driver. \u00a015 minutes passed I CALLED BACK (he never called back) and the manager said he still could not get a hold of him. \u00a0I was about to cancel my order but I gave the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0In the end I waited one and a half hours (1.5) for someone to walk 2 blocks I work on 2nd Avenue and they are on 3rd with one street difference. \u00a0I did the walk to see how long it would take. It took me 7 minutes, from door to door. \u00a0I am usually a great tipper. \u00a0But I tip based on service. \u00a0So, since I did not like the service I did not tip, plus I already paid $3 for the delivery. \u00a0The worst thing, when I looked at my bank statement they took an extra $3 so I paid $15 instead of $12. \u00a0I did not even bother to complain because that is the last $3 they will ever get from me. \u00a0I will never eat there again. \u00a0It is a shame because the food was really good. \u00a0I would have ordered again if I did not have to wait 1.5 hours and they did not over charge me for my order."], ["Lynn C.", "I came here about a month ago for lunch. \u00a0There isn't really seating inside (and you'd end up smelling like the grill) but there is some seating outside. \u00a0You get a huge portion for lunch and it's hot and fresh. \u00a0It's $8.95 for the chicken hibachi which comes with a portion of chicken, fried rice and grilled veggies (zucchini and onions).They are super fast and it's delicious!"], ["Lauren C.", "I really like the fact that they are so close to me. \u00a0It's nice to have a restaurant like this in the area. \u00a0I've been here many times and I've always enjoyed the food (the yakisoba SPICY is my favorite). \u00a0The staff is really nice too, and I feel well taken care of.I was told that they will be opening an indoor dining area soon. \u00a0That would be nice as well, especially on the windy days."]]}
