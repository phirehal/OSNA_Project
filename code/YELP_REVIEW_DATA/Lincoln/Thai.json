{"Thai Garden Restaurant": [["Spencer S.", "My wife and I walked here after yet another day walking around campus getting ourselves set for the school year.This place is walking distance from the City campus, about a block south from the Union. Upon entering there's a little wooden bridge spanning...nothing. It's just in the middle of the entryway. I suspect that, like we did, most people don't know what the hell to do with it and just walk around. Kind of awkward.We got two orders of tom yum, and a plate of basil beef. At $1.50 each for the appetizer-size soup, the tom yum is a great deal. It is hot, in every sense, and it'd be great for walking around on a cold day. The basil beef comes in a decent size portion, which it ought to for $8. It is very tasty. I noticed that some earlier reviewers dinged this restaurant for blandness, but that wasn't my experience.The service is good, better than it has to be, actually. We irritated the servers with questions about ingredients and soup bases, questions that people who's first language isn't English tend to find exasperating. Nonetheless, they remained friendly and patient, and best of all, they didn't lie just to shut us up.So this place is a win, as far as I'm concerned. I'd definitely go back and try some other dishes."], ["Anne C.", "Awful...possibly the worst Thai food, or any food I've ever had in a restaurant. It was cold, greasy and the Pad Thai sauce tasted like watery catsup. Half of our dinner party got sick. Run!"], ["Jill S.", "This place is tucked into the side of a building with a parking garage exit right outside the door. Didn't really know what to expect. The food wasn't bad per se but wasn't what I was expecting. I could be wrong but I think it's a regional thing. I ordered pad Thai. Which is a pretty straight forward dish. Either it is pad Thai or isn't, there isn't much wiggle room with a entree like that. It came out with the correct noodles but that was about the only thing that clued me into the reality that I did in fact receive what I ordered. I would say the sauce was sweet and sour sauce mixed with soy. Nothing close to the pad Thai I have had anywhere and everywhere else ever. But again it may be that the pad Thai where the owners are from have a different regional take on it. It wasn't bad, I ate it. I also ordered the fresh spring roll. Again not what I expected. It was noodles, lettuce and Krab (the K) isn't a spelling mistake! Usually these have pork and shrimp or at the very least tofu. The peanut sauce that accompanied it was grainy and weird frankly. If it weren't from the lack of flavor from the roll I wouldn't have used it at all. The server/would assume owner was very sweet and was very accommodating of our group of 6 that stopped in at 4:30, I'm sure not their peak hours. They accommodated all 6 of our separate checks with no problem which was nice and why they got two stars as opposed to one for the food. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I don't want to tell you not to give it a try, but maybe be forewarned it might not be the usual dishes you order but a different take on them."], ["Laura T.", "They get two stars because the water was clean and the atmosphere is nice. The waitress looked lanxious and worried, not friendly and welcoming. There was one other table table there. The food was bad. The noodles for chicken and fried rice noodles were hard and rubbery, the dish flavorless. The combination noodle soup was the worst: one piece of beef, lots of fake crab, 3 pieces of butterflied shrimp with huge veins and tails still on. No sides. No Siracha. Save your money and go to Blue Orchid. I wish I had."], ["Cheryl L.", "I was really disappointed tonight when I came here and was told that they were out of beef so Panang Beef Curry wasn't available. \u00a0I ordered the Green Chicken Curry instead and it was somewhat bland. I will try again some other time and hopefully they will have beef."], ["Erika R.", "The egg drop soup was delicious, great texture and flavor. I got the pad see ew, which was pretty tasty and the meat was good quality. The veggies left something to be desired and my friend's tofu wasn't very good, but overall it was a solid meal for a reasonable price."], ["Ariel M.", "Was not that great. I've had better Thai food. They're curry was pretty watery and the soup was not very flavorful."], ["Ben Z.", "I was surprised to see this restaurant looks much nicer compared with my last visit. They have redecorated the restaurant with good-looking lanterns and plants. The bridge were taken away. It looks more spacious now. Food tastes a little different but much better to me. The only problem is that it is still difficult to find in the downtown area."], ["Jessica C.", "Great food, I've had better pad Thai goong, but it was good anyway. Will come back, beef satay was amazing."], ["Awais A.", "This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I have ever been to. Will not spend money here again."], ["Alison H.", "Order the Tom kha for an appetizer, for $1.50 it was a good deal. It's not like any other Tom kha I have ever had, as it had cabbage in it. It was different, but I ate it. After being told the green and red curry dishes are exactly the same (not sure how/why that is...) I decided to order it anyway. A couple reviews said that the food was bland, but never about the curry. Well, I don't know how curry and coconut milk can be bland, but it was EXTREMELY BLAND! I could not even eat it without putting soy on it... Yes I said I put soy sauce on my green curry! Crazy! Will not return!"], ["Brandi Z.", "After going here twice to eat for lunch I can't help but finally comment on the food and service. I was told to come here if I liked egg drop soup, but their egg flower soup was quite disappointing. I'd compare it to scrambled eggs in broth with a weak/watered down flavor.The first time I got the chicken fried rice. I figured there would be some oil because after all, it's fried rice, but it didn't expect it to be so much! There wasn't a lot of chicken, but I figured hey, I was getting a rice dish after all, so I overlooked it. For taste, it was alright. Not really any seasoning or anything to make it stand out. Our hostess was quite attentive to us during the busy lunch hour, so it wasn't an altogether bad experience.The second time I got the Basil Chicken. For this meal I expected it to have more chicken since it was a chicken dish, and to be spicy as the menu suggested. It let me down on both counts. The chicken pieces were small, half the plate covered with more onions than I'd care to have. If you're going to put that many onions on a dish, they should change it to Basil Onions. There was no spice to speak of. When a menu tells me spicy, I expect my nose to start running and my tongue to burn. Nothing from this dish. It was bland and I hardly got a hint of flavor. Also, not once did our hostess come refill our waters. She came to give us the soup, our main dish, and the check, but that was it. It wasn't even that busy of a lunch service yet she still didn't have time to get us water.However, both times I quite enjoyed the spring roll. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things, but I know I won't be going back here anytime soon.A note on the atmosphere: it's a quaint hole-in-the-wall place with a bridge to nowhere that takes up space, but after going to the bathroom with a ton of cleaning supplies opposite me, I felt like they had to have a better place to store all of their chemicals than in the women's bathroom."], ["Andrew W.", "I no longer live in Lincoln, but I had to write about Thai Garden after a recent visit. \u00a0I loved and still do love Thai Garden's Coconut Potato Curry. \u00a0This was my first place that I discovered curry back in college. \u00a0The flavor was so different from what I typically ordered from a Chinese restaurant, my only comparison.I ate at the Thai Garden a dozen different times and always had the same woman take my lunch order. \u00a0She was excellent and took care of the entire restaurant by herself. \u00a0I always wondered how she did it.I hope to walk over that little bridge again and order a plate of Coconut Potato Curry. \u00a0Thank you for such great service over the years.This small restaurant is worth a visit. \u00a0I am glad I discovered it and have cravings and wish I lived closer some times."], ["Tessa P.", "Meriocre food. HORRIBLE service. Over priced and when I need a togo container for my barely mediocre soup they brought me a box. Soup can not be contained in a box. Sorry. I left it and the grey pieces of meat behind."], ["Jessica J.", "Is it possible for Thai food to be bland? \u00a0I didn't think so until i ate at Thai Garden.The egg flower soup was straight up chicken broth with scrambled eggs.The egg roll was completely devoid of flavor & the sweet chili sauce had the consistency of water.The Pad-see-Ew tasted like rice noodles & vegetable oil. \u00a0The chicken was funky flavored & the broccoli would not look at home in a garden. \u00a0Maybe in a can or freezer.My friend's meal was no better.Blue Orchid is ridiculously over-priced for what it is, but in comparison, worth every penny if you want decent thai food in Lincoln."], ["Jeff P.", "No wonder there's nobody here, the food stinks. I've never had flavorless \"curry\". I don't even think it was real curry. And it was missing the coconut milk that was supposed to be in it. The chicken was very over cooked. \u00a0The tom gai soup was weird. It was full of cabbage and had barely a hint of coconut milk. \u00a0Service was poor, as they seemed perturbed that we showed up during their lunch (they were eating right next to us). \u00a0Even for Nebraska, if you're thinking of Thai, forget this place."], ["D R.", "Possibly the worst thai food i have eaten. Pad Thai was a orangy pink color. Peanut sauce looked inedible. The only fortunate thing was the food i ate went through my system pretty quick!"], ["Ali L.", "I miss my Pad Thai from here.

I did try to stop by a couple months back and discovered they close after lunch for a few hours before opening for dinner again, so do keep that in mind. We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and were seated quickly. The atmosphere is calming with low lighting, a nice open dining room, and a subtle Thai ambiance in the decorations. The service was great and our order was taken quickly and food came out at a reasonable time. Nearly everything on the menu is gluten free so there are lots if options for those trying to avoid 'da glutensensMy boyfriend had this amazing Thai iced tea that tasted like orange cream. We enjoyed the Chicken satay for an appetizer. The chicken was moist and tender and it came with a sweet and sour cucumber salsa and peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was amazing. I had the panang curry with scallops and he had the drunken noodles. I thought the panang was pretty good, decent scallop serving, and my boyfriend always loves the drunken noodlesPrice is pretty average and portion sizes are good, I took some home and they even sent extra rice with me.

The atmosphere is chill and a bit reserved but I ate here wearing my flannel and sneakers. Nbd. The portions are decent but it's about $20 a person. Water tastes horrible even with lime. The food isn't spicy at all so ask for the spice rack. This place is kinda pricey but it's nice."], ["Tyra W.", "Overall 3.25 stars. I found the staff a little awkward. Our first host muttered something and walked away which left us confused. Another hostess came over and wasn't sure where to seat us. The restaurant wasn't packed and there were plenty of open tables so I assumed it would get busy after our 7pm arrival. We were asked twice by each host if we had reservations to which we said no every time. So maybe they prefer reservations? Our server may have been new (who knows), seemed very nervous (almost flustered) I would say. It made our experience a bit awkward since he was stand by our table until we stopped eating to ask us something. Then he would awkwardly stand there after we answered his question. However, our cocktails were on point. He had the drunken monkey (banana infused Jameson) while I had the champagne with a twist. Besides the awkward staff flow, food I would call average and service was slow for the amount of business present in the establishment.

Keep up the good work Jamie."], ["Rumil B.", "Like I said the last time, I just keep finding new reasons to love this place. I'm pretty sure I know half the wait staff by now, and they have never led me astray with their recommendations. New favorite meal as of late: Thai rolls, Thai tea, khao soi, and matcha cheesecake to top it off. And just in case you weren't sure, if you ask them for Thai spicy it actually means Thai spicy. Trust me."], ["Kaley Z.", "What a great little place tucked away hidden from the Main Street. So glad we found it because the food was really great. I admit I was nervous finding Thai place in the middle of the country but they did not disappoint at all. Food was super delicious and the staff was fantastic. My waitress even had the chef cook my dinner a second time since I made the mistake of ordering my spice level too high; definitely a difference from the east coast. The second dish prepares was delicious especially after my lips and mouth calmed down from tante previous fire. The dessert was awesome...chocolate coconut cake with homemade coconut ice cream with toasted coconut flakes. Would go again and probably will before I leave town."], ["Rebecca F.", "Went to Blue Orchid today and must say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience! The server Mickey was professional and knowledgeable about the menu. Mickey suggested the Thai rolls and they didn't disappoint!

I totally agree with previous comments about staff being awkward.Started with Tom Yum and added shrimp ($2 up charge), mostly clear w/ 2.5 slices of mushrooms, 2 small chunks of tomato, some cilantro and 2 small shrimp (which were still cold). When waiter saw I hadn't finished the soup he asked was the soup ok, I said no, it was not to my liking... Yet full charge on bill.

Recommendation: go elsewhere!"], ["M M.", "Love their lunch special. Have had a major craving for their drunken noodles lately. Decent staff and pricing.

As soon as I walked in, I told the server that I was in a hurry and he did not disappoint me once. The service was fast and he was friendly the whole time. The food was so delicious. I am a asian man so for me to say that I was impressed by asian food is the highest form of praise. The location of Blue Orchid is in the heart of Lincoln and it's close to the airport. I got Thai food here that makes Thai food in Georgia just seem cruddy. If you are in the area and you crave Thai music, make sure you stop by here!"], ["Abigael N.", "Their food is simply delicious.

Sometimes for dinner, but mostly for a great Saturday hangover lunch. The pick, Panang Curry w/ Tofu add veggies. It only costs $1 more and is worth every penny. The dinner portions are big, but I like the stable price of the lunch option and I always get the Thai rolls. The plum sauce is most likely store bought and it makes the appetizer so awesome. My wife loves the Tom Yum instead of the rolls, but I like to share. I had originally tried to go thru the menu and get something new each time. Since I hit the Panang Curry I feel there is no need to try something new. Spicy with a hint of sweet. Add a little red chili w/ garlic paste and it is phenomenal. Wash it down with a glass of Chang and you are good to go.If you have the chance try the Mango and Sticky Rice, which is seasonal, it completes the experience. Definitely the best Thai food in town, possibly the region. The staff knowledgeable, courteous, and polite."], ["Shimmy G.", "It's been 2 years now. Go ahead and disregard my previous reviews.

It's always someone else's suggestion. I dunno. People I like and respect talk about this place as if Wolfgang Puck and Tom Colicchio had a super-baby that creates magical Tom Yum Gai, spring rolls and Yellow Curry. Really, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that when it came onto the local dining scene, it was simply the first-to-market in its particular restaurant niche in Lincoln. It gave self-proclaimed sophisticates a new place to see and be seen, and to talk about when they weren't there. In the first few years it definitely leveraged that word-of-mouth, building a loyal customer base that established it as the only place to get omigod omigod omigod Thai in the whole wide world.But I've never been there when something just hasn't been a little out of whack. And it leaves me, unfortunately, with a view of the place as disjointed and mediocre. Above all, the acoustics in the place are just plain bad -- it's like trying to have a dinner conversation in a school gymnasium. Other times, the wait service has been inconsistent, even a tinge of distracted and slightly dismissive. During our most recent visit -- a Tuesday night, in which I said I was giving the Blue Orchid one last chance for redemption -- we waited an hour and 15 minutes after ordering our entrees. The food is not worth that kind of wait. It's certainly not rave worthy, especially for the price. I'm always perplexed by the panting reviews of how it's the best Thai food ever on the planet, or maybe even the galaxy or the entire universe including Heaven Above. It's ... fine. Not ungood. Just not all that great. I often get the ginger and garlic stir fry with chicken; it's a serviceable dish but this too has morphed over the years to be more pepper-and-onion-heavy (yes, I know it's stir fry) with less and less chicken. I was still hungry following our last visit.It's weird. The Blue Orchid has assumed this almost legendary spot in the local dining pantheon. So it clearly must do something right -- or, it could be that there's no legitimate challenger to its particular niche in the local dining scene yet. Me, I've yet to have a visit to this restaurant since its inception that hasn't been underwhelming or frustrating or, let's face it, both.A final note: I don't know what's going on with the southwest corner, near the front of the restaurant, but during a visit in May 2013 it looked like someone pulled a string out of dry paint there, leaving a horizontal line of exposed wall and chipped paint all around one of the seating areas. If it's an intentional design element, it fails, unless it's trying to give off the vibe of \"We're Upscale But Not Afraid to Look a Little Decrepit.\""], ["Christina B.", "I got the chicken pineapple stir fry.

Beautiful ambiance but amazingly mediocre food. The \"spring roll\" is not quite that. Has all of the right ingredients but reconstituted in the wrong order.

Excellent choice! They have a great lunch menu, offering two courses for $9.95. I ordered spring rolls and pad thai. The spring rolls came with a tasty sticky brown sauce. Be wary of those spicy jalapeno slices, though.The pad thai was also quite good. It was served with a healthy pile of crushed peanuts and lime slice.

However, the food is a bit bland / not spicy at all. The lunch deal is pretty reasonable ($10 for an entree and a side), but it does seem a bit overpriced if you go there for dinner.

I mean microscopic, \"LIKE THE SIZE OF MY THUMB\", and I have tiny fingers!!! The thai tea didn't disappoint, but does it ever?As far as ambiance goes, this place is very cute and chic looking.

Weekend evenings get a little busy, so be prepared to potentially wait a little while.The food is delicous, I always order the Tom Kha soup and the yellow curry with chicken as my meal.

After eating I was wondering about the people who complained about the portion sizes, they seemed quite ample.Had the Chicken Satay appetizer and for those who complained about small sizes on the appetizers, they didn't try that one. 5 good size marinated and grilled tenderloins with a good dipping sauce. The cucumber and onion salad was good, with a little kick thanks to the chili oil and jalapeno pepper.The waiter told me the red curry was a 7 on the 1-10 scale for heat. I beg to differ, closer to a 4. However I tend to like hot, so that may be why. \u00a0The flavor was great, enough heat you knew you were eating curry, but plenty of sweet at the front end from the coconut milk. I would definitely stop back in. The only reason they got a 3 instead of a 4 was somehow they were out of Thai Iced Tea at 5:30. On the upside, the Thai Iced Coffee might be my new favorite drink. The bitter from the coffee was a great compliment to the sweet coconut milk."], ["Cory O.", "Last night a friend and I had a chance to sneak over to Blue Orchid for a nice lil' dinner, here's my review.The Venue: Located in a tight spot between the old courthouse and some other large building it can be a little tough to spot if you're driving by. Once you enter the restaurant you'll notice it's clean, smells nice, and is pretty cozy and open. My friend mentioned that \"it looks cute\" and I'd say that about sums it up.The Service: When we walked in I was greeted immediately and from that moment on we were well taken care of until leaving. Spot on, prompt, and good service.The Food: My friend and I ended up splitting two orders, Thai basil chicken and (of course) beef pad thai. The dishes were presented well, tasted great, and were what I was expecting.The Cost: It was cheap by all accounts, our bill was about $35.00 and some change (plus tip) for two entree's, a beer, and an appetizer. No sweat there.The Bottom Line: The bottom line is I'd definitely come here again, the menu is a little \"Americanized\" but the food is good, the wait staff is on point, and the atmosphere is nice.P.S.

The last two great Thai restaurant meals I've had were both in the state of Nebraska. I'm thankful my potentially snobby prejudices have been challenged in this seemingly Asia-distant \u00a0area.Since the restaurant is a little more upscale than your smaller, more typical neighborhood Thai place, you might wind up paying a couple bucks more per entree, but the expense is definitely worth it. I'm a big curry fan and the Panang was suggested by the hostess. I was kind of bored of curries at the moment, but glad I took the suggestion. It turned out being perfectly spicy and sweet. The flavors stood out from themselves and had at once a distinct familiar, yet unique taste, avoiding a simple bland coconut and curry paste sameness. The staff were nice though I got my order to go. Highly recommended if you are in the area."], ["Tanner H.", "After dining at this establishment for about the 10th time - I figured it was time to give this place a review. Blue Orchid is consistently heralded as Lincoln's premier Thai restaurant, and for good reason. After my first dining experience went awry (a server recommendation gone terribly wrong and 20 minute wait on beverages that eventually came looking and tasting hastily and lifelessly made) - all other experiences have been pleasant and even quite memorable. Food - Very good, unique, and lively. Drunken noodles with tofu, Asian delight, yellow curry, and pad thai with chicken top my favorites. It seems everyone I dine with there has a different favorite dish - and thus I'm convinced that \u00a0it's hard to go wrong with any of there entrees. Their appetizers tend to be very small and not worth the money, but besides that everything seems spot on.Drinks - They usually carry one of my favorite wines (Klinker Brick Zinfandel), but when this is not carried - I normally go with a Sapporo (which I find to be quite refreshing when served on tap). Their ginger mojitos are raved about by many of my peers, but I have never been overwhelmed by them. Their thai ices teas are also very delicious. \u00a0Service - Usually very pleasant and attentive. I've had some very pretentious servers as well that tend to work to hard on their \"cool\" factor and less on their \"serving\" factor. During my one unfortunate experience, my food bill was removed from my ticket - though I would have appreciated a apology from the manager. They seem to strive for excellence.Value - For Lincoln, it's fairly high, but still manageable. My date and I usually get out of there for around $60 with drinks and dinner.Atmosphere-The high ceiling doesn't provide the most intimate setting, but still impressive and relaxing. Overall it's a fantastic Lincoln version of Thai food. It is one of my favorite of Lincoln and tends to climb the ladder with every visit."], ["Stephanie P.", "#199 So, after an eventful afternoon, we decided to hop onto Yelp to look for a decent dinner location. We were in the mood for Thai food and Blue Orchid immediately popped. Despite the fact that the entrance is in a sort of random driveway of the Grand Manse, the interior decor of the place was impressive. They were able to maintain the industrial architecture of the ceilings, while also creating a classy ambiance throughout the restaurant. I loved the spillover of their theme 'blue' to the table, with their blue goblets for water and blue plates - super cute. It didn't take too long before we figured out what we wanted since their menu is quite condensed, only showcasing the best options. We ordered 6 entrees (Drunken Noodles, Rad Na, Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Silvernoodle Salad, and the Pacific Medley), as well as both of the soups on the menu (Tom Kha and Tom Yum). The soups came out in record time and I definitely enjoyed the Tom Yum. I'm really into sour soups and they did not hold back on this one. The tofu was actually a bit too bland for such strong flavor and I'm sure it would have gone better with chicken, but I still think it's incredible. As for the entrees, I was only able to sample the Pacific Medley and Rad Na since they were the only vegetarian options. The Pacific Medley, though, was definitely on point and my favorite hands down. The shrimp were plump and juicy, while the scallops were deliciously buttery and melted in my mouth. The calamari were chewy and tender and paired well with the strong, spicy flavor of the sauce. I was also a fan of the gratuitous amounts of basil that were present as it balanced the entire dish by cooling it down. The waitress was great at the beginning, but dropped the ball a bit towards the end of the night. Once the dishes were served, she was a bit aloof in terms of her presence. We clearly saw her rush through certain things, like refilling out water, only to then saunter back over to the bar to chat up the other waitresses - an unappreciated sight. So, a star was knocked. Overall, great experience, great Thai food, love the architecture and ambiance."], ["Laura P.", "This is one of those places where once you find one thing you like on the menu you'll keep coming back for it. I really like the ambience of this restaurant; it works for a semi-casual dinner date or business lunch. The service is generally friendly and helpful but when it's very busy service can be quite slow. Heed the spice warnings on the menu. I've never had a bad cocktail here. The soups are great but the rest of the starters are a disappointment. All the vegetarian entrees are outstanding."], ["Ali L.", "The trendy Thai Fusion place of Lincoln.

Many of the items on the menu are simply too sweet for my taste. \u00a0I don't recall this problem on my first visit, but considering \"1\" above, well... 3. \u00a0The service is spotty. \u00a0Sometimes they're on the ball, but oftentimes not. \u00a0On my most recent visit (with a party of 8 for lunch), the food was poorly timed, and to add to that we had to ask for additional flatware, rice, etc."], ["Tam-Anh N.", "One of my top favorite restaurants in Lincoln.

The food here is always amazing while the service fluctuates, but I think it's worth it for such lovely food at cheap prices. Just writing this review makes me want a huge plate of pad thai... with a side of yellow curry. :D I constantly recommend this place mostly due to the food, but the restaurant itself is very nice.

I had a friend who was -- at the time -- on the wait staff, and he let a bunch of my friends and I know that the food was outstanding, so we got a group together to go. Talk about the worst decision ever! Let me back up. We arrived during the dinner hour, and knowing that the restaurant was fairly good sized, we figured the six or seven of us would have to wait, but no that long. Wrong. We waited more than an hour for a table, and we'd wanted to leave on many ocassions, but our wait-staff friend guaranteed us that although the service was shit, the food was divine. Well, he was right, but we all were weighing whether DELICIOUS food is worth HORRIBLE service. To this day, after several more unfortunate dining experiences at Blue Orchid -- slow service, long waits, but delicious food -- I can say that I haven't had a desire to go back. From the reviews, it doesn't look like things have gotten much better, either. You can go elsewhere for cheaper food, probably not as delicious, but the service would definitely be faster.
