They kept some of the old tables and chairs and added a wall in order to funnel customers to the cash register. The Tandoori chicken was just as savory as we remembered. The rice and Mulligatawny soup was tasty and really hit the spot on a cold night. As word spreads, I am sure this place will be a popular one for Indian take-out.

It's has beautiful decor and it's just comforting. Right opposite our table (we were facing the kitchen) is the kitchen from where the chef cooks. Everything is freshly made, nothing is frozen. You can see him cooking! It was pleasant to know where your food is coming from, and how it's being prepared. Once we were seated, a white woman served us (who we later learned, is the wife of the chef, who is Indian), she gave us water. For drinks we ordered a mango lassi (then another one later). The mango lassi was fantastic! It had a distinct mango flavor without it being too overpowering and sweet. It wasn't sour (like most places) nor was it too sweet. It was cold and was the perfect balance. It was also served in a cute wine-esque glass! Kudos!For appetizers, we ordered papadum, which was seasoned with crushed cumin and salt, and the papad itself was made with cumin. It was roasted to perfection and it was served with this sort of spicy, cilantro infused, tangy yogurt chutney! It was mind blowing! The combination with the cumin seasoned, mild papad with the tangy kick of the chutney was fantastic!We wanted to order bhindi masala (okra in curry), but I didn't want the curry. I just wanted saut\u00e9ed, crispy, okra cooked with turmeric, red chilly powder, and salt. We asked the waitress to request the chef to speak to us. Immediately, he came over and welcomed us with a warm smile and made a quick joke about how it would cost us extra to talk to him, which I found extremely nice of him.I spoke in my native language, which he understood, thankfully (otherwise it would've been hard to explain my requirements). We gave him the specifications and he agreed to make it the way I wanted.Next, I told him that I wanted to try the paneer tikka korma masala, I've never had it before, so we went to the kitchen and got me a spoonful of the curry and asked me to taste it. I told him that I wanted it spicier and he agreed to make it that way. Personally, I have never seen any chef do that! I was extremely happy!We ordered a yellow lentil (dal) and garlic and regular naan, our order also came with cumin, turmeric, salted rice.Like I mentioned before, everything is made right in front of you. There aren't any doors to the kitchen and you can see what he's making.Let's talk about food.The naans smelled scrumptious! I could eat them right there and then, WITHOUT anything, that's how good they smelled. They tasted even better though. They were soft, fluffy, crispy on the top, and topped with delicious butter.The garlic naan rocked! What's different about this naan is that the garlic is stuffed INSIDE the naan and not outside. Usually, it's outside and eventually the garlic falls off and you're stuck with a regular naan, but you're paying more. I got a bit of garlic in every bite, it was wonderful!Now for the vegetables, the paneer tikka korma masala was FABULOUS! It was tangy, spicy, sweet, acidic, yet mellow. The paneer (cubed cottage cheese) tasted extremely fresh, it was soft, and had a wonderful milky flavor, the way it's supposed to taste. Usually, different restaurants use week old paneer in their dishes and it tastes really bland.The bhindi (okra) was made the exact way I like it. It was crispy, spicy, salted perfectly, and just plain delicious, there weren't any words for it. I can't give you a better definition.The dal wasn't that great, to be honest. I could have done without it, but it was nice to try, especially if you're looking for protein overload and are a vegetarian.The rice that comes with the food wasn't so great either, I'd just order basmati rice with the food, it tastes so much better. We didn't order it because we were full.After dinner, the chef and his wife came by our table and we had a brief chat for at least 15 minutes which was refreshing and extremely nice of them. They both are wonderful people.Last but not least, I had the mango cheesecake. How can I describe this to you? The graham cracker crust had cinnamon, cardamom, and a distinct butter flavor. It was followed by the most delicious, velvety, and soft cheesecake ever. On top was their famous mango puree or sauce, it wasn't sweet nor sour, just right. It was topped with a maraschino cherry.Go to this place if you're ever in the Lincoln area! Amazing food, amazing hospitality, amazing people, and most importantly, amazing atmosphere!"], ["Fazle H.", "I thought the first time I ate here was just fluke, \u00a0but the food really is terrible, \u00a0no flavor at all, \u00a0very bland. \u00a0I gave him a second chance but it was a complete let down. \u00a0The chicken was just dry and flavorless, \u00a0the rice lacked spices, \u00a0and the food didn't have any spices or salt. \u00a0I felt bad for the for the guy at first but he is just bad a cook.

The \"Asian\" staff you are dismissing as inauthentic is Bhutanese. Did you know that India is right next to China? Bhutan -- the kind of food this place specializes in -- is a country, and it's right between indian and China, like Nepal and Tibet. That's why the people looked \"Asian\" (by which I assume you meant \"Chinese,\" since Indians are also Asian - South Asian) to you. They are.

We get a variety of different entrees for the main course which we will often times just split because the portions are HUGE! I think my favorite is the Goa chicken, but it's hard to choose.
