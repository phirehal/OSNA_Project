Charming atmosphere. Fair beer selection and choice of wine and martinis. Food prices seemed reasonable for what you got. The bread that comes with most meals was awesome!The Bad: The garlic cheese bread was neither very garlicy nor cheesy. It was just ok, but given the $6 price tag and the much better free bread with your meal, I would definitely skip this one next time.The Middling: I got the Big Vinny Trio and my wife got Penne Diavelo. The trio was ok. Everything hit the basics without standing out in any way. Definitely more towards the American side than the Italian. My wife's Penne was supposed to feature a \"touch\" of cream but was actually pretty heavy.Overall I'd come back and try them again. It's a cool location downtown, prices were all right, good drink selection and the food was \"good\" if not much else."], ["Hal S.", "I've been on assignment in Lincoln Nebraska for two months so far and this is the first time at Vincenzo's. I went with a dining partner and she had been here several times and was eager to order her grilled salmon again. But we started with the Artichoke Brochette as an appetizer. It was a very generous portion and I thought it was very good. I didn't get a feel for how she liked it but she didn't finish her half. I ordered the salmon stuffed with crab meat. My partner ordered her grilled salmon and stressed that it be cooked medium, not medium well. The entree's came at the same time with a side of \u00a0roasted potatoes and sauteed vegetables each. The vegetables were sliced squash, broccoli, and others that I'm sorry I don't recall. They were good.My salmon was fine, a little to much of a creamy white sauce that I didn't recall would be on the fish, but it was good and cooked to my liking.My partner, however was disappointed with hers. It was too well done. The server said she would bring it to the chef and she reappeared promptly saying that it would take about 5 minutes to remake the order. The order came promptly and the waitress was told that it looked good and would be fine. However, I could see from the side that the center was decidedly under cooked... in fact raw. It seemed that the chef might have even retaliated, it was so obviously not cooked. When the waitress came by to check, she was told to take it away and my partner had no interest in eating any more. The doneness of the first serving could be been debated, but there was no excuse for serving the second serving. Then the manager came out and took a seat by the table. She went over the details and asked if there was anything she could do. We said thank you, but no.I have to say at this point that there is no doubt that the restaurant is very concerned. The waitress never gave a hint of annoyance, and the manager certainly did anything and everything she could. She did not charge for that meal. I would try it again, with someone else or alone. I liked what I ate, but again that second serving for my partner was inexcusable. If I have occasion to go again, I will follow up here."], ["Lisa D.", "Awful! Truly awful! The one in Omaha is much better. Hostesses and waitress were idiots! Pizza was disgusting, frozen party pizza tastes and looks better.

The atmosphere is fun with a big open dining area and neat black and white photos of Italian culture on the walls. The wine situation was fun, they brought out a carafe with house chianti that was 14 ish and half the table just shared that and it was really good chianti too. Gluten free ordering proved to be a bit challenging. They don't have a separate menu nor do they denote gf options in any way. When I asked the server she pointed to one dish and seemed confused. I asked if the steaks were ok and she said- I don't know, if the sauce has starch in it don't order that one...I was at a bit of a loss for words, I had to ask her to please go ask the kitchen as I obviously don't know how they prepare their sauces. It came back that steaks were good, so I ordered the Gorgonzola steak with roasted vegetables and potatoes and the side of scampi. Our side salads came out quickly and mine was crouton free which was an excellent start. Meals followed in good time and the steak and Gorgonzola sauce was excellent. The steak was a perfect temperature and very juicy and the sauce was amazing. The potatoes and veggies were a delight. Only the scampi fell short of my expectations. The portion size was very small for over 7 dollars extra and the sauce was heavy in the citrus. Overall bill wasn't bad as the steak was 25 and well worth it. My friends were all really pleased with their meals and the rest of the service was good.

Her lavender colored hair was cute. We also talked to the owner for awhile and he told us a little about the history of the restaurant.

The Provel had a hint of smokiness, and the crispy breadcrumbs topped it off perfectly. \u00a0Seriously this was everything I love in pasta. \u00a0The guy washing dishes walked out from the back to thank me for making his job easy since I licked the bowl clean.The soup prior was over shadowed by the awesomeness of the main course, but it was a spicy, creamy tomato diaviola soup with onions and sausage. \u00a0I loved the onions, they were just right.The service was poky, the lunch time had maybe four tables total, but we had a giant group, so maybe that slowed things up.All things considered, I'll be back for that pasta again, possibly soon."], ["Jessica H.", "I plan to review this place again sometime when I can give a much better one.

Went there after nephew was hooded with his doctorate degree. Large portions. Prices were right. I was with a group of 12, so I saw several dishes. I had the spaghetti w/Italian sausage sans cheese.

Long Island teas I asked for little sour, but it came with too much sour, so they happily dumped it out -- instead of trying to adjust the current ones -- they made fresh ones, which were perfect! And, they apologized in both instances. Carrie, our waitress had her hands full on a graduation night, but she performed very well and overall service was great. Wifey had a spinach salad that she loved. Shrimp scampi was great. Steak w/rock shrimp was plentiful and juicy. The crab stuffed salmon looked great! The pasta w/tortellini was enough for two people and well-prepared. The only disappointments were the kids pizza, which may have been 'homemade' but the crust was like crackers and not appetizing. Also, I was really disappointed w/the tirimusi. More marscopone cheese and whipped cream than anything. I didn't taste the ladyfingers nor cocoa or liquor soaked in which should have been present.

With two glasses of wine each, we spent a total of about $70 after tax and tip, which I considered a great bargain based on the quality of food. Our service was impeccable as well.

The kitchen is aware of what to avoid, prepares food in a safe place, and is even willing to transform non gf menu items when possible, what a treat!! They substituted the pasta with zucchini noodles. The first time I came here I had the zucchini noodles with the bolognese sauce and it didn't quite work for me, but in this dish it was perfect. The bf had the chicken cannoli and was basically in heaven. Portions are really good size and I had plenty to take home for another meal.

For our app we chose brussels and kalettes which were very flavorful - a hint of sweetness with savory from the bacon. They were also cooked to a nice crispness but still juicy on the inside. Entree: I chose to try the prosciutto and egg pizza - I requested the egg be done hard instead of over easy like the menu had it. Tonya gave me a slight attitude because of it (she must have something against people that don't like runny eggs), but it was just a slight \u00a0hiccup in her otherwise stellar performance. The pizza was excellent - it was a crisp thin crust and was \u00a0 not too greasy. Boyfriend ordered the special which was a seasoned steak and brussels with potatoes. It was also delicious - the steak was cooked perfectly as were the veggies. Dessert: We ordered the tiramisu. \u00a0I've never had it before but from what I could tell it was excellent.

Is this too much to expect from a modern eatery? \u00a0 I am appealing to the owner here: prove it, just don't say it, that you actually use locally sourced ingredients. Local animal, dairy and produce are all available in this area. List all the locally producers you use. Dante's in Omaha, which has the best pizza in the state, does this.

My husband asked for a diet coke instead and she didn't bring that out for at least 20 minutes saying she made it but someone stole it. \u00a0Our huge salad only had one dressing container, even though the other table's single serving salad had the exact same size dressing. \u00a0I'm fine paying the fifty cents for more dressing, but it doesn't make sense to give me the same size dressing as an individual dinner salad when my salad serves 4.45 minutes later and well after 6:30, our waitress tells us they dropped our pizza. \u00a0They will make a new one and it will come quickly. \u00a0We ask for it to go since it's been AN HOUR SINCE WE SAT DOWN! \u00a0The pizza came about 20 minutes later and it's a 10 inch! \u00a0The waitress argues with me saying I ordered a 10 inch. \u00a0Are you serious? \u00a0She's wearing slippers and yoga pants to work. \u00a0We just wanted to leave but I was so pissed. \u00a0The waitress didn't charge us for the ice tea (so generous) but that was the worst $20 dining experience I have ever had. \u00a0When we got home almost two hours later since we left the house for pizza, the 10 inch pizza wasn't even that good."], ["Jon S.", "The Caeser's Pie is delicious. My wife and I shared a \"family\" size, which comes out in an 8-inch Pyrex dish. It is really delicious. I've only had their pizza once, and it was good...but salty.

It was a bit slow, but they were busy. Prices are very reasonable."], ["Veronica H.", "Great for Delivery, Good for Take-out! Great Pizza, lasagne, and the kids pizza is good too.

I've had a lot of pizza in a lot of states and even a few different countries, and this is my favorite pizza. It is the best pizza I have ever eaten.My favorite is the Chicken Tuscany. They have cream cheese on it, which is amazing. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni pizza, but I am at Piezano's. I have never been disappointed here, and always bring out of town guests to show this local pizza joint off.A tip...the parking lot is a nightmare. It's tiny and the spots are all angled oddly so that it's almost impossible to get out when you leave. If it's after regular business hours, I usually park in the lot next door, to the east. It's also easy to get to Piezano's by bike, because it's on South street, not far from the Rock Island Trail."], ["Matthew K.", "I have never had a bad experience here.

Ever since the new owners took over a few years back, everything has massively improved. We have tried both dine-in and carryout, and every time it was a hot and tasty meal.

They don't overdo any element; it's just a harmonious balance of awesome.Note their parking lot only fits maybe 8 cars and their dining area is not the biggest. And unless you're westbound on South St, it's a tricky place to drive to, but well worth it!I know I'm a bad Nebraskan for saying this, but I can never go back to Valentino's or anything else again."], ["Cory O.", "The Service: Honestly I've only ever had take-out from these guys so I can't really rate the service. When I arrived to pick up the pizza however they were attentive and helpful.The Food: The pizza is good, really good actually.

They have other actual itialian dishes but I've never ordered any of those.The Location: Easy to find/get to, a nice small spot that's clean and works.The Cost: Pretty reasonable considering how good the food is, maybe 22 bucks for a large pie when you order take out."], ["Paul W.", "Piezano's in my opinion without a doubt makes the best pizza in town. I've had pizza at all the other popular and talked about places in Lincoln but this one still beats them.
