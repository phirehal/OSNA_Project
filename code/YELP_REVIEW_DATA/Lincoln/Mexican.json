The restaurant is clean, welcoming, (easy parking), and a welcome respite from the typical tex-mex places across Lincoln.The presentation and taste of the sweet corn soup was impressive and delicious. The flavors and textures were well combined. The duck tamales were just as appetizing; crispy outside combined with the soft corn tamale inside with a delectable duck filling made for a lovely main course. The chiles en nogada hit all the right notes--the filling was the right blend of flavors, the walnut sauce had the right hints of sweetness and the whole entree was filling without being too much food; understated and authentic. We look forward to returning and trying more on the menu.One constructive criticism: our waitress did not seem to understand how to appropriately describe the specials. She called the braised short ribs \"ribs\" and the seared tuna tostada \"tuna fish taco.\" Granted, new restaurant, new food to Lincoln, new wait staff, but this is just a little constructive feedback for the owner to enhance this fabulous restaurant."], ["Nathanael E.", "This is one of Lincoln's best and most unique restaurants.Copal fills an underserved niche in the Lincoln restaurant scene, that of progressive cuisine, Mexican or otherwise. Offhand, I can't think of any other restaurants that I would put in this category, maybe there are some, but none come to mind.I have been there a few times and each time I explore a different entree, all of which have been superb, but my favorites heretofore are the Tilapia Tacos and the Shrimp Aljillo.If you are vegetarian, the menu selection is a bit limited, but I get the feeling that they would be willing to accommodate substitution requests.The wait staff have all been very welcoming and attentive in their service. I always like to tap into the staff expertise when exploring a new menu and I suggest taking advantage of the staff expertise at Copal.The prices are inline with expectations, a meal for two will run $40-$50 and will be worth every penny.This restaurant has not been open long and I expect to see the menu evolve over time. I still have many items yet to explore on the current menu, but I can't wait to see what they will do in the future.The professionalism on display at Copal is immediately evident. The owners definitely have an eye for detail and customer delight. You are in good hands here and I expect continuous improvement in the future.The atmosphere is nice, simple and open. The acoustics are not perfect, but certainly not a show stopper. During busy hours, I can see this being more of an issue, but I've definitely seen worse. I have faith in the ownership to address this moderate issue. All they need is some acoustic buffering in the form of panels or similar strategically placed decor.This is the place I try to steer my business lunches, too bad they aren't open on Mondays.Overall, the few negatives are negligible and the upside quite strong.

The menu isn't huge, but we were all happy with our dishes. The drink menu is unusual and excellent -- there was a respectable pina colada at our table as well as an avocado margarita that I loved. Portion sizes are fairly small, and the price of entrees can be either pretty cheap or a little more than I'd normally pay -- not much middle ground. Our server seemed like she was pretty new to waitressing, but she was definitely very passionate about the restaurant. Verdict: a little pricey for the portion sizes, but the quality is amazing. There are some kinks to work out since it's a new restaurant, but I plan to go back.Bonus: they gave me a tequila shot for my birthday in a traditional cup that I could keep!"], ["Ryan C.", "I was genuinely excited to try this place out, has a pretty interesting concept, and I'm generally a fan of \"mexican\" food. To start off, this place is pretty pricey for what you pay. I was pretty blown back by how much some of the dishes cost, so I opted for a pretty generic dish that was more affordable. So I Ended up getting the mole chicken enchiladas, which were good. It's really hard to outshine mole`, it pretty much tastes the same wherever you go. The serving size was pretty small, could have had more, and the chicken was a little dry. I'm complaining a little bit but the dish wasn't bad, I was pretty happy to find a place that had mole` in general. They also gave out free chips with a green and red option for salsa, which were both pretty tasty. The major gripe (and what killed it for me) was the service. They didn't have enough people running the bar and floor that night so they were extremely slow on their drinks. We got them wayyyy after we got our dinner. We wanted to enjoy our tequila drinks with our food so we waited to eat till we got our drinks. Our food ended up getting a little cold because we were waiting awhile. They have a pretty hefty menu of drinks and types of tequila, which was nice. The mixed drinks were thought out and definitely accompanied the flavors of our dinner, but when we actually got them. All in all, the place was descent and has potential to be a better restaurant. I'll give them the benefit of a doubt and say they're new and are working out their kinks. I have no desire to go back unless it's payday and I have the money to shell out over 20 dollars for Carne Asada. Which, by the way, is the most expensive Carne Asada dish I've ever seen. I might go back in a few months when they get their footing on service and bring down prices a little. I know making Mexican dishes doesn't cost a great amount so why over charge so much? By all means, don't let this review discourage you from going there and trying out something different. Just expect to pay more than what you're getting in terms of service and price. Oh and to call it \"Progressive Mexican Food\" makes the restaurant sound pretentious and off putting. My friend and I were making fun of it the whole night, specially when the restaurant wasn't holding up to it's slogan."], ["Sue H.", "We had dinner here last Friday evening. The decor is understated and tasteful. The staff was friendly and helpful. I had one of the specials, grilled tuna tostada. It was delicious!

It was about half full at lunch and it was fairly loud in there but not as bad as I thought it would be. The menu is small compared to most Mexican restaurants.

Prices are decent but can range drastically from $8-$19. \u00a0No notation for it being a \"lunch\" menu so I think it's the same all day. I ordered the tilapia tacos and could only finish half of them. There were 3 in the basket. They were a bit spicy but not unmanageable. My husband got the enchilada Rojas and they were very tasty and the chicken was tender. Lots of reviews said the servings were small but I found them to be just fine. Quality equaled quantity.

I really REALLY wanted to love this restaurant...and I think that possibility is still on the table. \u00a0Hah. \u00a0Table. \u00a0I'd give Copal some time to iron out some kinks, and they might possibly be the greatest foodie joint in the College View area."], ["Marie J.", "The food was ok but it is SO LOUD YOU CAN NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION!

Hang some Mexican tapestry from the ceiling or something to take the decibels down significantly. Hang some window coverings to help noise! Figure it out!!!The house Marguerita was ok but mostly ice, no booze. Mole enchiladas were good if you like boring. Spicy shrimp was excellent! It's a knock off of Bonefish Grill bang-bang shrimp but 1/3 the size for the same price. Churro dessert was hard as a rock, should have ordered the flan.

The second one was excellent. We had guacamole which was a little too creamy, we like it with a coarser texture, and pico de gallo which tasted good but the cilantro seemed intense and not \"fresh\". \u00a0The four of us each had something different: duck tamales, enmoladas, entmoladas, and chile nogadas. \u00a0The duck tamales were good. \u00a0The entmoladas with tomatillos sauce was classic enchiladas with a fresh green sauce. \u00a0The mole in the enmoladas was classic as well, with chocolate and chiles a little sweet. \u00a0The chile relleno was the surprise \u00a0the filling of beef, pork, nuts with a VERY creamy sweet sauce. \u00a0Do no expect savory. It's sweet but good. \u00a0Tried the flan, Churros and tamales for dessert. \u00a0All were yummy but the tamales were unique and the flan and Churros were safely but very well executed.

Some reviewers mention small portions. Yes, they are smaller than your average gut-bomb Mexican joint, but the ingredients are of a higher quality, everything is made fresh from scratch. That said, we did feel the portion for the Duck Tamales was too small to be considered an entree. The Paloma is an excellent drink and we also enjoyed the Day of the Dead Hefeweizen. The Enmoladas were delicious, the homemade mole is very distinctive and rich. The service was prompt, attentive and friendly. I do wish our server would have had a better answer when I told him I was torn between the refried beans and black beans. He just told me his preference instead of describing how each is prepared. I chose the black beans and loved them, great flavor, not mushy or overcooked, just right. Looking forward to returning!"], ["Tom S.", "Each of the 4 times I have eaten there, it has been great.

We were a little disappointed that with a party of 4 adults, we were only given a small container of salsa and a few chips. We ordered the red salsa, same thing. I think if chips are paid for, you should receive 1 free refill. We ate on a Friday night after 8 pm. Pretty busy, and had to wait for our server to bring napkins and silverware long after we were done with our small chips and salsa. \u00a0On the other hand, the flan for dessert was delicious."]], "C\u00f3mo Se Taco": [["Rumil B.", "So this place has gotten better each time I've eaten here.

The lemonade is a little too tart for me, but I'm not a big lemonade person so maybe try it if you're into sour stuff. The horchata is pretty good, I haven't had it many times before this place so I can't say how it compares to other places. But I believe it's made with almond milk. The Thai tea is delicious too. Tastes somewhere halfway between Pho Factory and Banhwich. They've also added rice bowls and salads, so you can get your choice on one of those instead of the typical tortilla. Each employee is also really friendly and helpful with recommendations/explanations. I wouldn't expect anything less."], ["Jacqueline V.", "I found out about this place a few weeks ago & was pretty darn excited to try it. Based on all of the pictures & Yelp reviews I saw, I knew I'd like it. I ordered the Seoul Food (I think that's what it was called) with beef. Being a BIG foodie, especially Asian fusion food, I HAD to get that. I don't want to say \"salty\" but that's the only word I can think of right now for the sauce. But thank God for Sriracha! But overall, I liked it. My bf & I also ordered the chips with guacamole. THIS IS MY FAVORITE. We devoured that thing in minutes. Guac tasted very fresh. The chips were crispy & flavorful. \u00a0Definitely not oily like another Yelper recently stated. As for the drink? I was actually pretty disappointed. Urgh, I LOVE LOVE LOVE boba, so my standards for it is pretty high. So I decided to play it safe & not get their Thai tea. I saw that they also had CUCUMBER LEMONADE. If you've ever been to Southern California & been to to Lemonade, then you know how AMAZING their famous cucumber lemonade is. Again, my standards for that is also pretty high. So, horchata it is!I don't know if it's me or what, but my horchata was very sour. I could not take more than a few sips. Sigh* Overall, I liked this place. The service was quick and the staff was nice. Especially the tall friendly guy who took our order & recommended some items off the menu for us. It's a small establishment with enough sittings for everyone. AND, you can choose what kind of meat you want in your tacos as well! Plus ~This is definitely a place I'd come back to whenever I'm in town visiting if I'm craving something more than traditional street tacos."], ["Lynne T.", "The first time I had the Seoul Korean with steak and Thai gallery with chicken. I thought the Korean taco was a tad bit salty to which I couldn't finish it. The Thai chicken was good. I didn't like the cucumber lemonade which tasted weird to me. The guac was good but didn't like the chips. They were too oily. Second time around I tried the Thai tea which was good. Overall it's decent. A little pricey side but that's because they're not a typical taco."], ["Elisabeth E.", "Since I've been in Lincoln I've just been continuously impressed with these restaurants, and the newest member of the family is no exception. \u00a0As soon as I saw they were open I had to give it a try. It's in the same location as Honest Abe's used to be prior to their move this spring. The inside has had a little change of decoration. It is still a pretty small space with limited seating so I imagine there will be a lot of taco take outs. The taco selections are as unique andInventive as you've come to expect from GUP restaurants. Each taco I had was different and had an unexpected twist. I had the GUP which was my favorite. The Thai peanut one was also delicious and the Jamaican had quite the kick to it. You can select your meat for each option. They have tofu for a vegetarian option and of course they thought of gluten intolerance in their menu design, I just love my options at GUP restaurants. Corn tortillas make any taco a option and the homemade corn chips and salsas are amazing.Everyone is always very friendly at all of their restaurants and there's a lot of crossover between them. Overall I was again really impressed with the quality of food, reasonable prices, unique flavor combinations, and overall friendliness of the restaurant. I'll be back soon."], ["Ms. L.", "I thought this was a great place to eat. Regional spins on tacos. Foodies will love it here. Very flavorful.

Lincoln totally needs new and fabulous places like this. This is not your typical taco place. This is so much more. I seriously can't race enough about how good these tacos are. Well, I only had two but I will be back to try the others for sure. I highly recommend the Seoul with steak and the Lima with chicken. Phenomenal!!!"], ["Greyson M.", "First time trying this place. Always have loved the Honest Abe's chain, but not a fan of the tapas at Sebastian's. Wanted to give this place a try, and is was a pleasant experience. I'm a big fan of Korean food, so I went with the Seoul Food. It was saucy, meaty, and full of flavor. I enjoyed the experience. Taco prices were slightly high, but that's how the food prices are for this local company restaurants. I would certainly go back if I had a quiver for non-traditional tacos."], ["Greg H.", "A rare miss from the GUP restaurants. Maybe my expectations were too high. I had the One Night and Seoul Food. The flavor was less than exciting and the portion size left a lot to be desired. For a $3 taco I expect a lot more. Hopefully they make some changes to bring it up to the level of their other restaurants."], ["Sam K.", "Be forewarned: there is no \"normal\" taco. And, a \"normal\" taco is what I was expecting when my buddy decided that's where we're eating. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Here's how ordering there works: there are currently 5 different tacos you can choose from: The One Night, the Seoul, and the Lima Parade seem to be pretty popular. Then, you choose what kind of meat you'd like on it: steak, chicken, pork, or tofu. If you're really hungry I would order 3 tacos. I had 3 Seouls and mixed and matched the meats. Whatever meat you choose, it's topped with Asian-themed fried rice, cilantro, daikon and carrot slaw, crispy wontons, and the meat is marinated in a teriyaki-like sauce. The tacos were pretty darn good, I just wish they were bigger. We also got chips and regular salsa, which was pretty bland. I'm sure the specialty salsas have more flavor but I would give an 8 out of 10 to our meal overall. I definitely recommend that everyone gives it a try!"], ["Mike W.", "This place is fantastic. It's in the old Honest Abe's space in Meadowlane, run by the same owners. Tonight we had the guasacaca, which is a Venezuelan take on guacamole. It was excellent and went well with their homemade horchata. We also had Gup, Seoul Food, and One Night tacos. All of them were unique and tasty. Think Sebastian's Table in terms of quality and creativity, but Honest Abe's or a food truck in terms of being casual and fun. Definitely looking at trying the rest of the menu. It's not the fanciest restaurant in town, but we had a great time and had plenty of space to settle in and have a very good meal and nice conversation."], ["Ryan C.", "Visited on 09/15/2015 at around 11:30AMQuick Tips:- Tacos are a little pricey but you get what you paid for in good flavor- Dining area is small, but HEY, they're tacos. Sit outside and eat them on the curb if you need to.- You pick your own taco to meat combinations- Not your typical tacos, but ask the cashier for meat to taco suggestions - 2 to 3 tacos should fill you up- Really fast service, had tacos in my hand at around 5 minutes- Good service, they asked how I liked my meal. Friendly.This place is pretty good. It's not your standard taco fair but that's what makes Como Se Taco stand out. They have 7 well thought out taco combinations that work for specific \"worldly\" variants of tacos. Your price depends on the meat you choose for whichever taco you choose to order. I really wish that they didn't let you pick the meat, you know they specifically choose the flavor combinations to pair with certain types of meats so why complicate the menu? I see why they did it, to please customers into having more options, but I personally trust their gut. They could at least have on the menu next to the names \"Suggest choice of meat: Chicken. To help lead the customer into making the right decision because I firmly think that choosing the wrong (or incorrect) meat can change your look on how the tacos taste. For example, I had the One Night taco and thought that chicken would be the best choice. The One Night was very good, almost a kick in the mouth of flavor but there was something missing which was the correct meat choice. I thought it would have tasted a lot better with the pork. I guess that's also another reason why they give you a choice, so next time I can try the same taco with a different meat. I also tried the Seoul Food (with steak), Lima's Parade (with pork), and The Peanut Gallery (with chicken). My least favorite was probably The Seoul Food taco with steak. I thought the steak itself didn't have very much flavor and the sauce over powered the taco and adding cilantro would have helped. Don't get me wrong, it was a good taco but it didn't stand out as much among the others. The Lima's Parade (with Pork) was probably the most well balanced in terms of flavors. I felt the ingredients complimented the meat instead of trying to mask it. The pork itself was tasty and could stand on it's own. If it made sense, I would probably order every taco with pork as the meat. The Peanut Gallery (with chicken) was also very good, a thai themed taco with a sweet thai peanut sauce. I really like the peanut sauce because I'm a sucker for sweet food but again it was a little empowering over the meat and other ingredients. The amount of sauce is pretty much a personal preference and small gripe but some of the sauces had just a little too much of a big kick. If they could find a balance in the sauce to ingredients ratio I think the tacos would taste even better. All of the tacos had rice, which I thought was a little unnecessary for tacos. Maybe the only taco it worked for was the Seoul Food taco because it had kimchi fried rice and added some depth to the overall taco flavor. For the other tacos, the rice didn't really make a difference. They should just add more meat. I also had the chips and salsa which was pretty good. The chips were home made and had the perfect amount of salt on them. The salsa was a tomato based pasty salsa. It was good but it was almost like an italian salsa haha, if that makes sense. As opposed to chunky salsa with fresh cut tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime, and whatever. Their horchata was alright, it had a little too much cinnamon for my liking but I did appreciate the sweetness it had. Sometimes a lot of Horchata can get watered down and it becomes tasteless. There was a hint of Jasmine or something different in the horchata but I couldn't pin point what it was. Overall the place was good and I would definitely go back and try it again. Possibly try some different taco combinations and see what's good. It's a little pricey for tacos but the tacos are good for what you paid for. If they made Himica I would probably eat there all the time. Place is definitely better than Honest Abe's."], ["Katie H.", "We tried out Como Se Taco tonight for the first time. \u00a0My (not so adventurous) husband had two pork Plain Janes. \u00a0He said they were okay, but he left hungry. \u00a0My son had a Plain Jane and a Korean taco. \u00a0He LOVED the Korean taco and said the Plain Jane was good too, but not as good as the Korean. \u00a0I had (at the suggestion of the people at the counter) a Korean Taco and the Lima. \u00a0I really liked them both, but I liked the Lima by far the best. \u00a0We also had chips and salsa. \u00a0We weren't crazy about the salsa. \u00a0It just wasn't the kind we prefer. \u00a0Not bad though. \u00a0The kiddo and I will be back again, as we loved it."], ["Preston K.", "The new venture from Ground Up restaurants is another success. \u00a0All of the tacos are definitely worth trying and it is fun switching up the different protein options. \u00a0A couple that really stuck with me however were the Jamaican and The Peanut Gallery. \u00a0The drinks are great to go along with the tacos. \u00a0The Thai tea is killer and ridiculously good and the Horchata doesn't disappoint either. \u00a0The Guasacaca is a smooth, creamy guacamole with a kick of lime that is an awesome addition to the tacos. \u00a0The next time I am intending to try the other salsas, but one thing that completes the dish is the chips. \u00a0I am assuming they are made in house and are nice and thick perfect for scooping up every last part of the salsas and sauces. \u00a0The interior: \u00a0Awesome. \u00a0I am such a fan of this smaller space that Abe's used to be located within. \u00a0It houses a lot of excitement, especially when this place blows up and has lines coming out the door too. \u00a0It is all part of the experience and part of the fun. \u00a0I'm a fan of the mostly white color scheme that they used as well as the fun graphics within the restaurant. \u00a0All in all, if you like Honest Abe's, you will like Como Se. \u00a0The fun and functioning flavors within the tacos, awesome and super nice staff, and generally pushing boundaries within Lincoln, NE confines of food, Como Se is a must stop for anyone who likes food in Lincoln, NE."], ["Peter W.", "I probably would have enjoyed this place a lot more if I didn't come so hungry.

I was expecting to pay around 25 and she charged me 42. Claiming a mixup she then tells me that the guacamole I paid for was seven dollars.

It came with a light red chile sauce on it NOT tomato sauce like other have eluded too. `These were so big at one point I just couldn't take one more bite. We were full all night. Like literally, for HOURS. The food came out quickly and was good. $2.50 Margarita? YES PLEASE. They are fooling around with the margies. You have the choice of sugar or salt and they pack a punch. Fountain pepsi products, lots of bottled beers and Mexican cokes. There are a number of burrito options (yes, some even with parmesan cheese in them so READ the descriptions), combo plates, and appetizers. They were in the middle range of price but considering the quantity, freshness of the food and quick service it was worth it. Service: service was nice and she was very quick.

I find myself making a weekly appearance there and I have to this point never left disappointed. If we're talking strictly cuisine, I do feel there are better Mexican restaurants in Lincoln, but El Toro comes with some perks that set it over the top. Food -Good, fresh, and huge. Always start with the complimentary chips and salsa, which is nothing too extraordinary. I always fancy their hot salsa myself. I am always a fan of their Arroz con Pollo, any fajita platter, and (on occasions) their Chorizo con Huevos. I tend to stay away from fried food, but my friends always enjoy their chimichangas and burritos just fine. When I go with my fiance, we normally split a meal and both leave stuffed. I feel that I'm a pretty big eater, but their plates tend to be ginormous. So either go hungry, or bring a friend. I've never had enough room for desserts.Drinks-Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reason I have given El Toro 4 stars. Wednesday and Thursday, El Toro has very healthy sized \u00a0flavored margaritas for $2.50. Let's just say after two of there, I'm looking for someone to drive me home. They have over five flavors to choose from for the special, but my personal favorite has become the blue on the rocks with salt on the rim. They also run beer specials on Mondays and Tuesday. I have also had their pina colada, and was quite impressed - though the amount of real coconut milk is probably enough to clog my arteries for a while! Service-Only once has there been a little mix up in who was supposed to take our order, but besides that it is always fine. They have one man there (I assume he is the owner or the manager) who is dynamite, always a bright face and adds a lot to the experience. All the other servers are very timely and helpful, they have a small staff so they tend to be very experienced. It should be noted that El Toro is quite small, they only have 2 locations where tables of five or more can sit, so taking a group of over four is not highly advisable without a reservation. Overall, it's a very charming restaurant.

We were a little confused as the one side has ice cream/deserts but is actually part of Super Taco still. We sat down and were promptly addressed by our server. She was fantastic and for the most part understood what we were saying/ordering. She was slightly surprised when we ordered Lengua, Tripa, and Cabenza tacos.My order (at first) was of 2 tacos lengua and 2 tacos al pastor with a large horchata. The horchata was great, not overly sweet and had a great rice flavor to it. The lengua was cooked well, not the greatest I've ever had but still delicious. I always order with just cilantro and no onions and they didn't overdo it on the cilantro because of that. The tacos al pastor were by far the greatest tacos al pastor I have ever eaten. Out of the multitude of taquerias in Omaha no where came close to Super Taco. I ended up ordering 3 more by the time we left.

Ended up with 2 chicken, 1 carne asada and 1 pork steak and pineapple masterpiece.Served with red and green hot sauce I couldn't get enough of, this was dining perfection. As I stuffed the last delicious morsels in my mouth I wondered out loud how many of these little beauties I could eat in a sitting. Four was definitely enough for a workday lunch, but even when we were done and comfortably full I still wanted more (which probably brought on the taco-inspired dream)."], ["Nate R.", "True authentic Mexican!

You'll want more, though.You can tell this place is great because 1) despite the tacos being a simple affair of corn tortillas, onions, your choice of meat, and cilantro, they're delicious, and 2) the place fills up with Latinos at lunch time. Since there are only about 8 Latinos in all of Nebraska, that says something.I come here about once per week for tacos, have been for about 6 months, and I look forward to it every time. A little restaurant that can turn a simple taco into awesomeness is worth its weight in gold in ANY city, but especially in a city that has no idea how to do Mexican food. Taco John's, are you kidding me? Frying up a frozen tater-tot and calling it a \"Mexi-fry\" doesn't make it Mexican.

We had been there once before, but it was after a late night and, well, at those times anything tastes good... otherwise the Highway Diner wouldn't be in business. First of all, their chips and salsa are TO DIE FOR. In the El Chaparro vs. Super Taco competition going on in my \u00a0head, this round goes to El Chaparro. I was disappointed that I didn't find an option to order my carne asada tacos individually, although, to be fair, I didn't ask if this was a possibility. Instead, I went straight for the cinco tacos option. My husband ordered enchiladas, and my daughter ordered a hardshell beef taco. The tacos were comparable to Super Taco - small, traditional, onion, cilantro. lime, etc. However, I think Super Taco's meat is more flavorful. More importantly, Super Taco's salsa verde (which is a huge flavor addition to a carne asada taco) is super yummy. El Chaparro's - well, it wasn't for me. I felt it was pretty bland. So, Super Taco wins this round hands-down. My husband was 100% pleased with his enchiladas, and my daughter happily ate her hardshell taco. We did end up paying more than we would at Super Taco but, again, maybe I could have ordered the tacos individually (I usually only get two), which would have brought the price down."], ["Joel G.", "Had pretty bad heartburn last time after the chicken mole enchiladas"], ["jennie p.", "I absolutely LOVE this place!Hands down the best late-night Mexican food in Lincoln.But you better get there as soon as you can after last call because this tiny space fills up fast.Why I like it: \u00a01. \u00a0Grande Buritto con pollo.

They also have a salsa bar with fresh made salsas for your complimentary chips, or to add to your meal, the red onion salsa was surprisingly spicy, but really tasty.I would have given this place 5 stars, except for a lacking beverage selection.

Fresh, hot chips with 2 kinds of homemade salsas. Unfortunately, the entrees are pretty bland and usually swimming in some kind of weird sauce. I had the lunch special of 2 beef tacos today and it was ok. Kind of bland, nothing was really seasoned. It's a lot of food made with fresh ingredients for less than $7 so I can't really complain too much. Basically it's satisfying, but I've had better.The service is excellent, more than likely because you have one person to fill your drinks, one person to take your order, and one person to bring chips and salsa and pick up your plates lol.

The menu is very Americanized and lacks dishes I would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant (i.e. barbacoa, carnitas, etc). They had \"Mexican\" potato skins on the menu. Enough said. My dish tasted very \"food service,\" not like freshly prepared ingredients. The decor is outdated as is the exterior of the building itself. Needs upgrading if they want the ambience to enhance the dining experience. It's made up of a lot of random Mexican/Texan kitsch. Our server was fine, but didn't have much of a personality.

Since we are local I'm sure we will be back to try the food!"], ["Julie S.", "The service is Very Slow, if you have time to sit and wait for your food this is the place to come. The chips and salsa are good, guacamole not so much. Margaritas, pre-poured and sitting in the bar. Food finally came and needs some flavor, no spices."], ["Michael H.", "While I enjoy laid back service, I do not enjoy service that is so lax that we have to ask for the chips and salsa which were supposed to be brought out when we sat down. The fajitas were decent but the Nachos Mariachi had meat that was bland and looked very unappetizing. If you're lucky, the waitress might remember she is in fact a waitress and offer to refill your drink."], ["Cari F.", "Not good at all...excruciatingly slow service, no one got our orders right, our drink order was given to another table and my chicken was more of a mystery meat."], ["David S.", "Brand new so still working out the kinks but food is awesome. \u00a0This isn't tex mex. \u00a0It's the most authentic Mexican food in Lincoln. Caldo de Res and enchiladas verdes were top notch."], ["Alexa D.", "When you walk in there is so much to look at with all the beautiful decor!! Then, it just went downhill. We walked in and someone from the bar yelled at us to sit wherever we would like. We sit and our server came right away with some kind of chewy chips and salsa. We never got any water. \u00a0I ordered a margarita to find out they only have one small size. (This wasn't bad, just I found it odd- first Mexican restaurant I've ever been to with one size) margarita was tasty but didn't taste like tequila was in it. My husband and son ordered some steak tacos and really liked them. I ordered a chicken nacho that was worse than any fast food nacho a person could have. It was a cold nacho plate. It literally was a cold plate of chips, some warm refried beans on top, a canned, cold orange cheese sauce poured over with nuggets of diced chicken? And lettuce. The best thing about this plate was it looked pretty and the beans were warm. The chicken tasted like it came out of a gerber baby food jar. When the server came and asked if we liked our food I gave her my barely touched plate. She asked what was wrong and I said there was no real cheese and the chicken tasted canned. She ignored I said anything and asked if I'd like to order a taco. I said no thank you. But when we got the bill, they did take the poorest excuse for a nacho off our bill, so that was very nice to see. I still will never go back though."], ["Joe M.", "The food took quite a bit longer that I had expected; after all, I only ordered tacos. When the chicken and beef tacos arrived they had very little flavor. Quite disappointed."], ["Emily C.", "The food has no flavor. The chicken in the tacos was gray and bland, and the tacos don't even come with lime wedges. The corn tortillas tasted pretty good, but if the tortilla is the best part of a taco then you have a problem. The salsa tastes like ketchup. The pupusa was okay. The margaritas are cheap but not that delicious and definitely light on the tequila. The service was quick enough but not very friendly. Overall, you're better off going to El Potrero and definitely better to go to La Mexicana."], ["Susan S.", "Not thrilled. \u00a0The location is top notch, but the service and food was poor. \u00a0We ordered for ourselves and our 2 children. \u00a0They didn't seem to know what a flour tortilla filled with cheese meant and brought us the weirdest thing we've ever seen (and didn't eat)....a hard shell taco filled with melted cheese. \u00a0The kids turned up their noses and so we gave it a taste...not something we would eat either. \u00a0Big waste of $. \u00a0They took our order for a margarita and never brought it, but charged us for it anyway. \u00a0They were not busy and had lots of wait staff, so not sure what the problem was. \u00a0The prices were VERY reasonable, but with such poor service, we won't try it again. \u00a0The chips were so-so and the salsa was very bland. \u00a0Disappointed since we are huge mexican fans and eat out often. \u00a0Next time we will walk the extra few blocks to go to El Potrero."]], "Mazatlan Mexican Restaurant": [["Genevieve W.", "Always great authentic food at reasonable prices!! I love their guacamole and wonderful tortilla chips. The salsa they bring back to the table right away is amazing. They bring you a mild which is like a pico de gaio and then there is the spicy. The bean dip and the cheese dips are also delicious. So is their appetizer platter with cheesy chips, quesadillas and taquitos. I must mention that their refried beans are made with a whole lot of the L word.... Lard. Traditional wonderful refried beans! The place hasn't changed decor since I came here as a kid so it's s bit nostalgic. \u00a0It's pretty clean and well maintained though. The bathrooms could use a bit of updates but not bad. The patio out front is awesome. And the restaurant itself is well kept and clean. Staff is friendly and they bring your order out quickly. Would highly recommend for any craving of nice sit down traditional style Mexican food!!"], ["Steven T.", "This is as close as you will get to Mazatlan Mexico in Nebraska. The food is as authentic as you can get and well priced too. At busy times the restraunt can be a little crowded and loud but one can handle it for a good meal.Tonight my wife and I had the Morales Special and for the cost of $27.95 you get a lot of food. I am talking a huge ribeye steak, two chicken breasts, prawns with onions and mushrooms, beans and rice, guacamole, sour cream, fresh pico, and tortillas. It says a dinner for two but four could eat on it easily. This plate with all that costs less than 2 separate meals. Cannot beat the bargain."], ["Brandon F.", "The worst service I have ever received in any restaurant. The servers have a weird attitude that was aloof and disrespectful. It was as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. We asked for any spicier salsa than their bullshit concoction served with the chips and they simply said \"no.\" They take your order and 30-45 minutes later you'll get some bland crappy \"Mexican\" food that would only impress the most sheltered of people. Cholula was the most flavorful thing I ate that evening and I can do that perfectly well at home. In fact, I would be more satisfied chugging a bottle of Cholula and calling it a wonderful Mexican dining experience. I'm disappointed that people return here and keep the restaurant in business because it's an epic failure."], ["Mitch G.", "Amazing food. Menu is authentic and not \"tex mex\" so if expecting low grade, crappy, pseudo Mexican food you will be disappointed. Been coming here since they opened and never had bad food or service."], ["Cole K.", "Probably some of the best Mexican food in town but absolutely the WORST service in town. The waiters are slow and incredibly unresponsive. They will not even check up on you once you have ordered. The staff is \u00a0cheap in that they clearly ignore tables that haven't ordered expensive/alcoholic drinks. I once ordered a soft drink when I was seated, and the waiter did not stop back by to check on us, and waited for over 20 minutes to bring my soft drink only when my meal arrived. Loved the food but will never return because of this horrible (borderline disrespectful) service. Go here if you want to play the fun game of flagging down anyone that can help you...it's a real challenge!"], ["Rudy S.", "excellent Mexican food. service has always been excellent. \u00a0food very good. \u00a0large servings. excellent margaritas. Julio & Claudia are the best servers but all wait staff has been very good \u00a0 chips are the greatest even better with the CHEESE DIP."], ["Kendall R.", "We did more waiting for service and the check, than we did enjoying the meal. I had the chicken enchiladas with creamy cheese sauce. \u00a0I swear the cheese sauce was melted Velveeta queso. Yuck! I have given this place several chances and won't be giving them another. If you want GREAT Mexican food, go to Hacienda Real at Southpointe."], ["Chris P.", "I love this place. \u00a0I've never had a bad meal here and I've dined in a hundred times at least. \u00a0The staff is always courteous, the food always and hot and fresh."], ["Kat R.", "I loved the food I got here. It was a little pricey, but it wasn't too bad. The service was fast when I was there, but the store was not busy. Prices were reasonable and portions were big. I'd definitely go back."], ["Aaron O.", "Decent food for the lunch special, $1.25 to add sour cream though? C'mon! Potentially the reason the rest of the menu is 120% more expensive. Might return for drink specials, oh and the spicy salsa was great!"], ["Matthew H.", "Always have had good experiences here. I highly recommend the Cancun fajitas (my wife likes shrimp, I get the steak). Also, they have amazing chicken tortilla soup; it comes in a huge bowl and is a great value, especially if you order off the lunch menu. Excellent service, good chips & salsa, and fair prices. My favorite Mexican place in town."], ["Amanda K.", "The entrees were hot, cheesy and delicious. Very typical Americanized Mexican food. \u00a0The staff was friendly. The only thing to complain about we're the chips and salsa. The chips were HARD (you can't even call it crispy). We couldn't eat much of them.I had a burrito and it was just blah. \u00a0My fiance had the fajitas and they were AWESOME.I'm giving this place 3 stars for the fajitas.UPDATE: \u00a0I added a star for the margaritas. \u00a0YUUUM! \u00a0Chips are still blah, but I did order some cheese dip on my last visit. \u00a0Anything. Tastes. Good. With. Cheese. Dip."], ["Gary P.", "Typical non-authentic mexican fare, cover every dish with cheese and stick it under a broiler and then dump a quart of sour cream on top and serve. \u00a0Seriously, the staff is nice and works hard, but I feel it is just not good food."], ["Aaron T.", "This is some great mexican food. My mother-in-law took us here for lunch. We ordered the lunch specials. The meals were very fresh and very hot. Loaded with flavor. The beans and rice were also on point. The bill wasn't too high. I will defiantly eat here again if I'm in the area. Try to stop here if your in for some good mexican food."], ["Joshua H.", "Awesome food! I grew up in Seattleand when I moved to Lincoln I found a ton of places serving nasty old seafood...not this place! Get the seafood acupolco burrito mix of shrimp scallops crab octopus ...good stuff..everything is Taste :-)"], ["Morgan H.", "Sad excuse for Mexican food. I ordered the enchiladas sunrise and had pork verde filling for my enchiladas. The green chile sauce lacked flavor and there wasn't much on my plate. The pork was okay but I expected it to be more tender if cooked properly in the sauce. The eggs were over cooked and there was about a tablespoon of run to them. This is such a simple dish. It's sad that a restaurant that has several locations can't handle the basics. 2 stars because the service was good."], ["Chaviva G.", "When I lived in Nebraska, everytime I went to Mazatlan I got a Pina Colada, because they were -- hands down -- the most delicious I've ever had (to this day even!). The food was always piping hot, the servers were always friendly, and the restaurant was always packed with families, college kids and couples. I remember going on a date here once, even. That was awkward. At any rate, I recommend this and any of the family restaurants -- Las Margaritas, La Mexicana, etc. -- to anyone looking for delicious food at a reasonable price and outstanding pina coladas!"], ["Meg R.", "Good food, good drinks!! I would come here again. Nice atmosphere."], ["Marlo C.", "It was ok. We were in a rush and the rest of our party had already ordered and some had already gotten their meals when we got there 10 mins late. We were asked what we'd like to drink, both wanted water. The server asked if I could just drink the water already next to me (which wasn't mine). I said no, I'd like another. (I found that to be insulting, I would never ask someone to do that) She left and never returned!! Not even to take our order. We waited 15 mins before my bf got up and went to the bar and tried to get us water. The bartender said that our server could get us some. So we waited longer. When we saw her again, we asked for our water and she said \"oh\". \"OH??!!!\" We were not impressed. After 25 mins we got water and she walked away. We asked when she walked by again if we could order. And of no suprise, she said she'd be back and didn't come back for 10 mins. By then all of our friends had eaten and most had paid, and we had yet to place an order after being seated for 30+ mins. I ordered a cheese quesadilla (I knew it would take the least amt of time to prepare). It was enormous (which was good but by then I was less than excited to eat it) and it came with guac, sour cream, and pico. My bf said he didn't feel like eating, so I asked for the bill. For $12, it was NOT NOT NOT worth it AT ALL. We may go back....someday. We believe in second chances, but first impressions are lasting."], ["Angie W.", "I went to Mazatlan last night with a couple of friends. \u00a0I am a chips and salsa fanatic, and I was not thrilled with the chips. \u00a0They were hard and not very flavorful. \u00a0The salsa was not the best, but definitely not the worst... \"a-ok\" in Yelp terms. \u00a0I ordered chicken enchiladas, which consisted of shredded chicken with some cheese and a bit of sauce. \u00a0They were pretty tasty, and I had no complaints. \u00a0My two margaritas were excellent, and I am very picky about margaritas! \u00a0No complaints about the service whatsoever. \u00a0All in all, a solid experience, but nothing in particular that would set it apart from numerous other Mexican joints."], ["Jules T.", "They have the best margarita. I prefer the mazatlan margarita on the rocks, usually in pitcher form if you have a large group. The food it great, hot, fresh, huge portions to share. \u00a0The nachos, burritos, churros, fried ice cream are great, my favorite is the skillet faijtas with shrimp. The staff is friendly, great for kids, busy on weekend nights. You can also get one free shot on Cinco de Mayo which usually turns into 2, 3 shots later. It's clean, cozy, parking is can be difficulty during their busy hours but I've always find a spot.Bathroom: Clean(locally owned, family restaurant) They also have a second location on south 27th"], ["Elizabeth I.", "Had a good dinner and margaritas, and the staff was attentive and friendly. \u00a0Soooo much food. \u00a0Maybe it was just the particular entrees but i might recommend sharing one and ordering more if you need it. Um, it's been a while, I can't remember what I had but I do remember that I enjoyed it."], ["Heather B.", "This is really good Mexican food. \u00a0It's a sister restaurant to co-owned El Toro, Las Margaritas, and La Mexicana. The service is great, and it's just a nice atmosphere. Feels like a real \"meal-out.\" I like these people and would recommend it to anyone... especially the chicken mole. And they have good salsa."], ["matt g.", "Really good and pretty cheap. \u00a0There is a great selection of margaritas and the food is always consistent. \u00a0It is a wonderful place to go with a large group."]]}
