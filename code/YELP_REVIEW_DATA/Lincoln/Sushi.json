{"China Buffet & Mongolian Grill": [["Lacey L.", "Been here too many times to count. This is one of my favorite restaurants to come to. The service is always fast and the waitresses/waiters are always on top of drinks. They aren't around so much that it makes you think they are watching you eat. That's a pet peeve of mine. Food has always been fresh. If you want something cold head on over to the frozen section, pick out your favorite pasta, veggie, sauce and throw it all together. If you haven't tried it, I'd suggest you try it out, especially on either Friday's or Saturday's because they have crab legs.

But the last experience was Terrible and left us not feeling well later that night. We came at 5pm which I think made the difference, we usually come around 6 or 7. The issue with coming at 5 is the food tasted as if it was left overs from lunch or the afternoon and hadn't been switched out for dinner yet. Everything was just off and not what we are used to getting. The hot and sour soup tasted bitter and the egg drop soup had no salt which is weird for a Chinese buffet where I am pretty sure salt is the main ingredient. Nothing was fresh or as appetizing as it usually is. The insides of the crab Rangoon had darkened to an unappetizing dark dry consistency. I may give them another shot in the future, onlyTime will tell if they can redeem themselves"], ["Jason B.", "The food isn't going to be the best, it's a buffet. But it's not bad. The guys manning the grill could move the food around a bit more, some parts got overcooked, and the sauce didn't get mixed as well as I would like. Other than that, this place is great. There is a big staff keeping things cleaned up, plates cleared, and the buffet refilled. They serve crab legs on Friday and Saturday night, and the night I was there, they did a great job keeping them refilled. I didn't see a single pan that had run out of food all evening. Ambiance is a bit noisy, but don't go to a buffet restaurant for a quiet conversation."], ["Jason B.", "Fantastic! The food is great. The service is prompt.

A lot of your standard Chinese fare but the food is fresh, flavorful, and hot. I would put it above average but not sensational since it is a buffet.Obviously the food is good since this place is CONSTANTLY busy. Even on a Sunday there was a wait but we were seated in about 5-10 minutes.

They are for new customers; to try and get them in the door. Oh, you only got a salad, so sorry you don't understand how buffets work. Sorry your picky-ass daughter only had a salad. She could have hit the Mongolian grill 6 times for the same price. Oh well. She missed out on some good food. This is not gourmet food, we are after all talking about a buffet. \u00a0With this context in mind, the food is reasonable. I have been here about a dozen times and have left full and satisfied every time. They have something for everyone, especially on crab leg night. One improvement needs to be the dessert area. Pineapples from a can, gross sheet of weird powdery cake with honey(?) and dry-ass cream puffs.

Blue remains one of my favorites in Omaha, so I definitely knew I had to try the Lincoln locale sooner than later to compare.

The Blue dining room has less general dining tables but also has the sushi bar to dine at. The decor is a little bit more funky and comic-like than either of the Omaha locations, but I think it matches the younger college town feel that Lincoln and the Haymarket exudes. Service wise-about the same. Still slow when they are slammed and the hostess are pretty consistent. It can get a little patchy during the happy hour times.Food wise, I am happy to report they are still doing great in Lincoln! They have a variety of rolls that are both cooked and raw, and I enjoyed everything that we tried. I compared by ordering all the same rolls I typically order in Omaha. Crunchy LA and Crunchy Blue remain 2 of my cooked favorites, and I love the Spicy tekka and sake to keep it simple for the raw rolls.

Just don't get 5 rolls and appetizers!(HH = Happy Hour)I was on a mission to celebrate the hard work my brother did for me recently so we may or may not of ordered three appetizers! The first was spicy edamame (garlic, soy, togarashi) I got FOR FREE just for checking in on Yelp. \u00a0I also couldn't say no to the mango crab rangoon and calamari is one of my all-time favorites!All three appetizers were delicious. \u00a0The spicy edamame (free, $5.5 originally) had just enough flavor to tickle your tastebuds while you suck the beans out. \u00a0The calamari (sesame-crusted squid, vegetable tempura, miso aioli ), delicious in it's own right, but not over the top ($5 HH, $8 originally). \u00a0Now, the mango crab rangoon (mango and mirin pur\u00e9e, fresno pepper sauce) ($4.75 HH, $8 originally)? OUT OF THIS WORLD. I loved it, loved the sauce, sweet and gingery and full of yummy rangoon deliciousness.

Snow White - Crispy seabass, avocado, burdock root, bibb lettuce, soy paper, panca mayo ($5 HH, $10 originally)I really liked this roll. The crisp freshness of the lettuce was a unique addition. \u00a0The flavors were very clean, not overdone. \u00a0Philadelphia - smoked salmon, cream cheese, scallion, Japanese cucumber ($5 HH, $8 originally)I'm a sucker for salmon and cream cheese and this was one of my favorite rolls. Negi Hama - yellowtail, scallion ($5 HH, $8 orginally)Light fishy taste with the smooth texture of yellowtail. I always like to get a least one very basic, fishy roll and if you've got white tuna/yellowtail on the menu, you automatically get a star. \u00a0Favorite fish!I washed down all this goodness with some Sake Sangria ($6 HH, $7 originally). \u00a0Good choice! You get a cute little sake cup and container to drink it out of and the flavor is not too dry, not too sweet and ice old. Wonderful!We ordered a LOT of food and our server, Joe, was very attentive, informative, understanding when I wasn't quite sure how to properly eat the edamame and completely nonjudgmental. \u00a0The manager also made this way to a few of the tables, including mine, and happily cleared away our plates while I sipped sangria and lounged around (we were seated in the awesome lounge area, not complaints. Tables are shorter to the ground but it was great for relaxing and talking). \u00a0The music was nice, upbeat, not too loud, energetic, the lighting dim with lit up tables, lots of good looking people, and all the employees were very welcoming! \u00a0I ended up spending $45 (not including the tip) for ALL of this, which would have been closer to $70. \u00a0Again, the happy hour special is AWESOME!

I wasn't disappointed! We were here last weekend for the late night happy hour that starts at 10:30pm on Saturday.

We were seated immediately and our server took our order promptly. Food came out really quickly and everything was delicious. We had the edamame and chicken satay for appetizers. Both were good but the best part for me was the rolls. I really enjoyed my avocado roll and negi hama rolls.

Go back in re-sit down after that horrific experience and eat? \u00a0We were all livid, the most unprofessional confusing dining experience we had ever had. \u00a0Will never be returning, as we felt publicly humiliated by a strange childish unprofessional rude manager--she should really change careers as hospitality is clearly not for her-- she really hurt our feelings....we ended up handing her ten bucks to cover the coupon that our friend was gifted a month or so ago and he held onto for this specific occasion (he pulled out his id for her to prove his birthday and everything)...so the bill was double handled. \u00a0The little server guy was nice, seemed like their staff had many new servers, the martini we ordered was on point (even though it took 20 minutes to receive the first and only one--would have loved another), and the place has a nice appeal...we have eaten there several times--usually at the bar, but we wanted a more intimate experience...and those little bartenders up there are great. \u00a0We trafficked this restaurant a couple times a month and will never return."], ["Mary F.", "This place never disappoints.

Their happy hour menu is pretty extensive, however the sushi roll selection is a straight up list and all their rolls have silly names which is more of a pet peev of mine with sushi restaurants because I like to know what's on my roll. This makes selecting your happy hour rolls tedious because you have to constantly look back and forth between the happy hour menu the regular menu for the item descriptions. If you find one you like on regular menu you have you check this disorganized list to see if it's on the happy hour menu.However, all the happy hour rolls are $5 and there are a couple of their pricey rolls you can get for half off which is nice. The Snow White for example is great.Like most sushi places I've found the beer selection here limited. Your typical light Asian beers and several domestics. Lincoln has an amazing local beer scene and your losing money if you're not taking advantage of it. Sometimes I want a great heavy, bitter beer, even if it doesn't go with sushi, who cares? Don't forget this is a bar too. But maybe the lack of beer selection is to encourage customers to try the sake?However during happy hour they have $2 Coors light, and even a beer snob like myself has a hard time turning down beer that cheap.My favorite goto sushi roll at any place is spicy tuna and this is where I'm taking off one star. Their spicy tuna roll is about the width of a nickel, maybe a quarter. I really wanted a full size roll but you get this tiny little roll.My final drawback for this place is that they're only open until 10pm during the first part of the week. Hiro 88 down the street is open late and there are plenty of nights I'd like to go here instead for the bar like atmosphere instead of the nice sit down place like Hiro.

I was with a group of friends and overall, I felt that they were being too harsh when I was more understanding that it ALWAYS takes a little bit of time for a restaurant to work out some kinks the first few weeks/months of it opening.First visit: They had a drink menu available, but no liquor license yet so they couldn't actually serve alcohol. A little annoying to me. Certainly ticked off my friends. I can understand a menu item or an ingredient that the restaurant was out of but probably shouldn't have had their drink menu available when you couldn't serve drinks.The service was on the poorer side. There was a larger table of about 12 or so that was seated right before us which we were already a party of 6. I know it can be overwhelming for kitchen and servers to kind of keep track of two larger tables that are ordering food at the same time. The waiter was really quiet and seemed like he was fairly new to being a server in general.Food was great, presentation was probably the most visually appealing for sushi places in Lincoln.2nd visit: MUCH BETTER!Waited a couple months, service was improved, food still looked beautiful. I certainly had my fill along with taking home leftovers. Pricing overall isn't too different to other sushi places in Lincoln. If I'm getting sushi, I'm typically probably going to spend somewhere along the $30 range unless I'm feeling particularly frugal or not as hungry that day. Overall, I enjoy Asian Fusion more than some of the other sushi places Lincoln has to offer and if you haven't tried it yet, but like sushi, give it a shot."], ["Matt H.", "I've eaten here 6-7 times and enjoyed the food every time.

I am from Omaha and I had friend's suggest that I eat here, so I was expecting great things. The Rangoon's were not the only appetizer that was great, the sushi we had was awesome as well as the edemame. I like spicy, and that is exactly what I got! Thanks to the waiter for listening! The rest of the meal was just as great as the atmosphere and the wine (which was a nice bottle)! I would drive to Lincoln again to go to Asian Fusion.

The quality of the meats and seafood for their dishes hot and cold were disappointing, and the grade of the meats were poor. The hot food was not great, nothing too exciting and some of the dishes seemed dry from sitting out under a heat lamp.For calling yourself a sushi place, the sushi was wayyy below par and I was questioning eating some of them based on the appearance of the fish. The nigiri (rice with a piece of fish laying on top) were so skimpy it was as if they cut the fish with a laser to achieve the thinnest piece possible. This is not authentic. The sushi rice was not flavored correctly either. I understand we are in the heartland and may not get access to fresh fish, but there are way better cuts of frozen fish you could be using, and a sliver is completely unexceptionable and you are cutting corners on costs.

One of the rolls I ordered was the eel but it ended up being more like a California roll instead of Unagi. The names of the rolls are cheesy and I suppose designed to appeal to young, South Lincoln: \"Sex and City roll,\" \"Playboy roll,\" \"Hole in One roll.\" For the record, the \"Victoria's Secret\" was very good.The place seemed a little run down - for example, the Formica on our table top was chipped... with as many tables as were open, sitting us at a broken one was a miss.Verdict: the Sushi was good (not great) and worth a return trip on my part to sample some other items.

As I mentioned I had the Mongolian grill, all you can eat for $10 at lunch. \u00a0There were several meat options, including at least four seafood options. \u00a0I oiled up my dish with the Mongolian oil and the Coconut Curry and it was very tasty. \u00a0They are a little different than HuHot in that they ask you to put the sauce into a small white bowl which they add to the food after it's been cooked. \u00a0I'm not sure why they do it this way and at first it was really confusing for all of us, but my meal tasted great! \u00a0The grill comes with white rice at the table. \u00a0Complimentary bread is also available but after not getting any initially we determined you have to ask for it. \u00a0And I'm so glad my friend did because it's delicious!! It's a lightly toasted flatbread with scallions and sesame seeds. \u00a0They also had a plethora of appetizers to choose from and next time I'll have to try the avocado egg rolls. \u00a0They also have green tea ice cream which I miss from Wasabi so I'll be back for that. \u00a0Overall, the experience was good. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0$10 for all you can eat can't be beat. \u00a0Appetizer prices are a bit high but portions seem to be large. \u00a0I'll return."], ["Dennis N.", "We went for the first time for lunch last Sunday & food, service and atmosphere were superior! We ordered the \"Happy Hour\" California Roll as an appetizer for $4 and the Mongolian all-u-can eat buffet for $13 and once was enough for me. Lots of seafood choices like shrimp, scallops and mock crab, in addition to the usual meat choices. Very fresh ingredients & clean buffet. We are heading back tonight for a business dinner. I'm excited to share this new find for us in southeast Lincoln."], ["Ashley Rae T.", "Ginger's decor is very sleek and modern. Happy Hour is in the bar area, where you can either sit at the sushi bar and watch the magic happen, select a booth for a bit of privacy or sit at one of the hightops. The music is modern radio fair, a bit better than the usual surfer/semi Asian background music most places default to.I started with the pineapple mojito which was ready quickly (Ginger has a full bar opposite the sushi bar.) The drink was super pretty (I care about those kind of things) but outside of that, I wasn't impressed. There was something a bit off about it but I couldn't place what. Would probably try a Mai Tai or Gingertini next go round.The first item that arrived was my crab rangoon. These were winners because they actually had crab in them! Not just the blah cream cheese most places pass off as crab rangoon. They came out super crispy and the sweet and sour sauce wasn't too thick or sweet. Definitely the best thing I had that night.For sushi I went with the spicy tuna roll which again was a great portion (8 pieces) and well presented. These rolls were as fresh as sushi can be in a landlocked Midwestern city. Can see myself liking this place more than a certain other sushi chain (rhymes with true)."], ["Wade S.", "Good Mongolian grill and sushi bar. Nice casual atmosphere. Service is attentive without being too much. Sauces are pre prepared, you don't make your own sauce which takes some of the guess work out of it."], ["Erik Y.", "Tried this place simply because I love asian food. \u00a0Not a bad place to eat. \u00a0It's really three restaurants in one. \u00a0They have a sushi bar and a decent selection of rolls and sashimi. \u00a0We tried the pink lady, Lincoln, and Phoenix rolls. \u00a0All were good and different. \u00a0Full of fresh ingredients and had some nice flare and look. \u00a0They also are a Mongolian grill, much like HuHot in Lincoln and Omaha. \u00a0Mostly the same ingredients however they do have more seafood options to choose from. \u00a0This is what they have for the Mongolian grill, even for lunch: beef, chicken, pork, crab, shrimp, clams, fish, and bay scallops. \u00a0The third part of the restaurant is off the cuff asian menu items like asian hot dogs, lettuce wraps, asian tacos, and more and a full service bar. \u00a0The building and decor is fantastic. \u00a0Lots of glass, stone and stainless steel. \u00a0This place is very upscale and trendy. The high ceilings and excellent ventilation left no lingering odor on our clothing as we left which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine at other Mongolian grills. \u00a0 \u00a0The free standing building is absolutely huge and I bet you could fit 250 people in it. \u00a0Probably one of the largest restaurants in south lincoln and a real treat to try. \u00a0On the downside, no private room. \u00a0I am always in need of private rooms for work meetings and they do not offer one. \u00a0Price is another consideration as things are mostly in the mid to high range. \u00a0Our party of 3 ate for just under $100 and no alcoholic beverages were ordered. \u00a0I would expect the average person to expect to spend $30-$40 each with apps, dinner and drinks. \u00a0Unless you eat like a bird and just order a salad and water, then your at $10. ;)"], ["Greyson M.", "The place is basically a fancy huhot, with more expensive options and sushi.Although the staff was very friendly and welcoming, we couldn't believe we couldn't have a to-go box for our leftovers from our last round of the Mongolian grill.

They have sushi, salad, all types of stuff. They have this bar thing where you fill a bowl of stuff up (noodles, meat, etc.) pick your sauce, and they fry it up for you, for about $13. That's what I got to eat. This restaurant was very clean. Maybe it was because it was a Monday night, but everything seemed so neat. The design was really nice, everything worked really well together. All of the chairs were lined up nicely. I really love clean restaurants. The food was a little too salty for my liking, but I was the one who picked out my sauce so I can't really complain much there. \u00a0I ate all of it. Like most other places in Lincoln, they are a Pepsi restaurant. That is my only complaint about this place. I tried my grandmas orange chicken and it was amazing. It was cooked really great and had an amazing sauce on it. This place is a little pricy, but it is worth it. The food here is great, and the restaurant set up is amazing."], ["Carmen S.", "Ginger is a new \"pan Asian\" restaurant that opened near Lowe's. It's been open for a few months now and I have had several opportunities to visit. They have a drink and appetizer specials every afternoon. They also have a full sushi bar and Mongolian Grill. I've sampled a couple of their appetizers, I really like the avocado eggrolls!I've never had bad service there however I have heard from some friends that they had some issues. Some of this may be growing pains from starting a new restaurant. All in all I think it's a great place to go, relax and enjoy a nice dinner. The decor is upscale and the seating is comfortable."], ["Kristen M.", "I ate lunch here recently with a friend. We were looking to try somewhere new and since I heard they had a Mongolian grill, decided I would see how it measures up to Hu Hot. Overall it was good. For 9.50, you can get the all you can eat make your own creations at the grill. We went on Friday and crab rangoons were .50 so that was also nice! The best part was that they offered more expensive seafood items including shrimp, salmon, mussels and crab that at most places is only offered at dinner and is priced higher, so that was a major perk! I enjoyed most of the vegetable options as well, especially the fact they had jalepenos. My favorite sauces were the coconut curry and the Thai peanut curry, but variety of sauces overall was good and they did have a chili paste, hot chili oil, and garlic oil, which are must haves for me when at a Mongolian grill. For some reason you don't mix the sauce with your bowls and instead put it in a separate bowl and it gets put on towards the end. Not sure what affect this had on the taste, but no complaints. The chef making our dishes was very polite and each trip up to the grill he asked us how our food was and if we liked it. The hostess and people up front were also very welcoming in greeting us when we arrived and left. Our server was helpful in explaining the daily specials and asking us how our food was. Atmosphere was very nice, new and clean. Note this review is only judging the Mongolian grill. This place also has a full Asian entree menu and sushi, which would be fun to try sometime but as far a getting the most for your money, the grill is probably the way to go. My picture below is of my first creation from the grill."], ["Tod S.", "I must say I'm glad to eat crow!!!! \u00a0A friend posted a positive experience on FB so we came back for another go and man were we happy!!!!!! \u00a0 Excellent food, service was outstanding and it was all around a great meal that was well needed!!!!"], ["John G.", "Food: 2.5/5. The sushi wasn't bad, however for the price and quality. Blue is still better. The grill is a sub par HuHot; less options, worse sauce (that they don't even cook in), and longer wait. Good selection of beer and wine.Service: 2/5. Just like everyone else on here, it was subpar. Wait is a little above average but not terrible. The bartender had no idea what he was talking about for any items on the menu or drinks. Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Clean, and windows would help during the day. But towards the night, the dim blue lights leave the place dark, and not in the warm intimate way."], ["Lane G.", "I'm a big fan of Asian cuisine, so a new restraint in south Lincoln was great to hear about! My friend (who is an avid sushi connoisseur who has even been to Japan) and I decided to try it out, a couple months after opening. We ordered edamame, three different rolls, and the Mongolian grill. The sushi was underwhelming, to say the least. It was visually appealing, but the flavor was bland and the sushi was lukewarm. The Mongolian grill didn't have TOO many options, and it didn't match up to HuHot.All in all, it was a classier Sakura China, with the same quality of cheap buffet tasting food in a more stylish atmosphere. A good place to enjoy a drink, but if you're after a satisfying meal, your time would be better spent down the highway at Asian Fusion. Each of our meals was about $25- way too much for what we got."], ["Terrance M.", "This was my first visit, there is no acoustics in this place. For no more people that were in there, it was very noisy. The SAKE I ordered was supposed to be warm, hell I can pee warmer fluid than the SAKE was.The food was OK, but was nothing to brag about.

I don't want to mention about food since to me service is the first thing have to be good at the restaurant! I don't have a chance to try out the food yet. There were not much option for sushi menu!

And the side salad is a really good size!) I really like the ginger vegetable soup and the caesar salad as side options. Another visit I had recently was during happy hour and while I loved my roll and my dumplings, my friend tried the asparagus roll and the sweet potato roll, both from the vegetarian menu and she really didn't like either of them. I've also heard not so great things about their Mongolian-style grill. I will say that their sushi isn't always rolled tight enough, so it can get messy, and is frustrating. Since I work out near here, I definitely will stop in frequently during lunch for their great lunch special and to continue exploring the menu."], ["Lacy D.", "I was a little worried after seeing all the poor reviews but I had two people highly recommend this place to me, so my husband and I decided to give it a shot.

The food was phenomenal. I don't know about these other reviews but I know that on a night where it would have been easy to fall short, give sub par service and had rushed, not so great food, our experience was quite the opposite of that. I highly recommend this place."], ["Van T.", "A group of 4 visiting from out of town. We were excited to learn this restaurant offered sushi, a Mongolian grill, and some other menu offerings. Crabrangoon and lettuce wraps for our apps. Standard crabrangoon fare, but I have a weakness for them. The lettuce wraps were a good portion size, but I was surprised they were not served with a sauce as the meat was not seasoned enough to stand alone. The sushi was good (Lincoln roll and Phoenix roll), but was plated with my brother in-law's sashimi and sushi roll - a bit odd since we ordered separately, but not a big deal.Shrimp and vegetable tempura...BIG MISTAKE. The menu describes the tempura as tossed in the sauce, but it wasn't - which is fine because that's not how tempura is usually served anyway. PLUS, the tempura sauce was DISGUSTING. The meal would have been rendered inedible had it been tossed in the tempura sauce as listed in the menu description. ALSO, $14 for THREE small shrimp and the remainder of the meal consisted of 4 onion tempura, 1 sweet potato tempura, and 2 zucchini tempura. Ridiculously overpriced for what they serve you. Orange chicken: standard fare as well. Somehow it arrived to our table with mashed potatoes instead of white rice and the person who delivered it to our table (not our waiter) tried to tell us we ordered it that way. Who orders mashed potatoes with orange chicken?! The kitchen was prompt in delivering the meal as ordered though - 1/2 star for that alone.Our service was not spectacular. We did not have our drinks refilled very quickly. We had to ask for small plates for our appetizers. Our waiter appeared to have a dip (tobacco) nestled in his mouth.So, the other 1/2 star goes for ambience - the restaurant is very esthetically pleasing.Would we come back the next time we are in town? Probably not."], ["John M.", "Although the place is nice looking, that's about all it has going.

That was the the last time I saw him. Didn't console me and apologize, nothing. I have not gotten my tab yet to see if they took my dinner charge off, cuz others at my table are waiting in the Mongolian line for half hour. \u00a0Taste wise, not bad, not great. Not worth the wait though."], ["Craig C.", "On my second visit to Ginger I took my 88 Year Old Korean War Vet Father In Law to test out their Sushi. We went on the early side just after noon as most 88 Year Old's prefer. It was not extremely busy (Thursday) and the staff was plentiful and friendly. Our Waiter was a young man, very friendly and extremely ready to serve us in any possible way he could. He said he was not a sushi expert but was learning! My Father In Law had specific requests regarding his sushi and we placed our order. I ordered the Lincoln Roll and he ordered the Pick 3 Sushi lunch special with his specific preparation request. Our orders arrived and his prep request did not make it to the Itamae but our Waiter immediately responded to his pleasant reminder. It took another 15 minutes for it to arrive back at our table. I'm not a sushi connoisseur but he was satisfied or he was just being kind as is his manner. Regardless I have never had anything other than an extremely courteous experience at Ginger. You could not possibly find a more hospitable Waiter, and sometimes that just makes all the difference."], ["Jessica S.", "Was not impressed. Service was poor. Forgot half out appetizer order and we had to ask for it again (crab rangoons) and they were actually the last thing we received. Then, the waitress barely apologized and we still were charged for them. Sushi was average. Fried rice was horrible, pretty sure the sushi rice was used and it was literally a big blob of mushiness. Also, we shared an order of shrimp and vegetable tempura. For the price, we were disappointed. There were three pieces of shrimp and mostly onion slices."], ["M R.", "My family and I were looking forward to trying Ginger and after looking at the reviews were hesitant...it is clear you either have a good experience or a bad one. We had a bad one. Easy to fix: We loved the ambience but it does not make up for the problems.First, the bartender is not capable of waiting on tables and mixing drinks. \u00a0She cannot talk and work at the same time. \u00a0At the bare minimum she needs a second bartender to actually make the drinks. \u00a0I can't imagine how irritated people were in the restaurant. \u00a0She can't manage more than two tables without making drinks \u00a0let alone a building full of people. \u00a0She was very friendly, but it isn't enough to make you ignore how long it takes to get a single drink.Second, the food was disappointing. \u00a0How can steamed rice be dry? \u00a0It was like it was made this morning and sat all day and completely dried out. \u00a0No excuse. \u00a0It is rice. \u00a0We ordered the orange chicken...it was mushy and dry. \u00a0We liked the sauce...what there was of it. \u00a0If you can't make chicken crisp and rice moist...at least give us enough sauce to cover \u00a0it up and hydrate the rice a little.Third, the sashimi was dry and looked like maybe it shouldn't be eaten. \u00a0The presentation was meh. \u00a0As a family from the west coast we've been nicely surprised at what Lincoln has to offer in this category...this was not it.Fourth, why are we given so many menus? \u00a0If your servers feel like they need to take three minutes to explain the menus then they are poorly organized.Fifth, I believe there was a manager standing behind the bar who seemed completely unaware of the state of the restaurant and bar. \u00a0If you \u00a0are going to keep a slow as crap bartender then get in there and help out. \u00a0Your shoes looked fine...and if they didn't...standing behind the bar all night looking at them isn't going to change anything.Bottom line, your servers don't know what to do with themselves due to the majority of people doing the Mongolian grill but make them help out instead of standing around all slack jawed. \u00a0If you can't handle a restaurant service, then get rid the menu. At this point, it is done too badly to help you out. \u00a0Since I don't like Hu Hot I will not be coming back for anything.I hope you turn it around...gain some experience at managing a restaurant. \u00a0It's a beautiful place."], ["Concerned C.", "Way too much MSG added!

The fish used for the sushi rolls is very high quality, absolutely delicious. The rice was cooked perfectly. The combinations are delicious. The sushi is definitely the highlight for us. We also tried the sweet and spicy wings, which were yummy. The wings were fried until crispy, then dipped in the sauce, which was sweet but had a nice kick. The Hawaiian sliders feature two ground beef patties on a Hawaiian roll. The best part of the sliders is the side of grilled pineapple, brushed in soy sauce. It sounds crazy but it's absolutely delicious! The sliders themselves were a little boring, maybe offering something with a little more of a Hawaiian twist (like a homemade pineapple ketchup or using Spam for one of the patties?) would be nice, but they were substantial and cooked nicely. Next time we'll try the lettuce wraps, they looked fantastic. We didn't try the Mongolian Grill, but we looked it over. Very high quality ingredients and I couldn't believe the price, which was for unlimited trips. It's a deal for sure. A large percentage of diners chose the Grill. The drinks were nice, our service was outstanding both times. The GM even sent out an extra piece of pineapple when I told her I loved it. Highly recommended."], ["John S.", "Do not go here! I went twice once the first week, once a few months later. Terrible experiences both times. Food took over 30 minutes each time, and it is not even what I consider average. They have sushi, Mongolian grill, and standard menu, when you focus on all three the quality of each drop, and you can tell, it's obvious this is a poor business model. Also a woman assuming to be the manager came to tell us the food would be up soon but never a real apology both times for such extreme wait times but offered no free meal, dessert, or really anything besides a free drink the second time that the bartender apparently made accidentally, no one wanted it and she did not even offer it to any of the 3 people whose food was STILL not there but to the whole table with no real professionalism at all.

I am a huge fan of the Blue Orchid so when this restaurant opened, I was ecstatic. When I first visited this restaurant with my family, I was impressed with the ambiance it had that made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I ordered the Drunken Noodles (my gauge for a new Thai-esque restaurant) and was very pleased. The Drunken Noodles had just enough spice and sweetness to make the perfect combination. However, my mother made the mistake of getting the halibut and it was BEYOND fishy. We all tried a bite of it and couldn't stomach how dry and fishy tasting it was. We love our fish so the halibut was a bust. Another bust for the night was the steak that was overcooked and not well-seasoned. From that dinner experience, I learned to stick with the noodle dishes and curries.A few months later, I visited again, but this time for lunch. I met a friend and we started with an order of the duck rolls. The duck rolls were absolutely amazing. They had a great plum sauce to go with it that made the flavors meld well together. My entree was the Panang Curry with salmon. If there was a curry god, I think I met it with this meal. The combination of the spicy curry with the salmon was absolute perfection. I couldn't have asked for a better made curry with perfectly cooked salmon. I was in Thai heaven.Overall, as stated earlier, I would stick with the more Thai-traditional dishes and veer away from the more \"fusion-inspired\" dishes from the signatures list on the dinner menu.

There is an expanded Thai menu, and that was nice to see. My friend and I were boring going with staple American Thai dishes: Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles. The food was very good, although my noodles were undercooked. Which made the dish not so great. The meat was very tender and juicy. If you like spice, you should ask for it extra spicy. There was a bit of a kick, but it was sweeter rather than spicy. My friend said she liked her Pad Thai, and it was better than Blue Orchid's. Portion size: LARGE. I definitely felt like I got my money's worth and more with the portion size. My friend and I could have split our noodle dishes and left home super full.

The nice manager did come over and apologize for the soup, he said it was left to reduce too long and was thrown away after my complaint. \u00a0I told him the fish was not prepared correctly but he did nothing. \u00a0I will not go here again, back to the Blue Orchid which knows how to serve dishes at the correct time, not serve cold rice, and can cook a bowl of Tom Yum without removing your taste buds. \u00a0I wish the place well regardless as Lincoln needs all of the variety we can get. \u00a0P.S.

Not trained fully Asian cuisine, I can really respect the flavors developed and interesting combinations that I could not muster. We had the steamed mussels, which have a fabulous white wine, garlic broth, accompanied by a side of lemon grass chili sauce that ends up being one of the best appetizers I have ever had. On the down side, they were the exact same mussels from Blue Orchid, leaving me with a slight feeling of being tricked into coming to this sister restaurant with a new name. For our entrees we had a scallop dish with passion fruit sauce and grilled halibut with a chili lime sauce. The scallops were edgy and a wonderful combination of the two flavors, the presentation was clean, and organic. The halibut was grilled well with nice score marks. the chili lime sauce was a great citric component to the clean fish. Served on the side was white rice and steamed veggies. The veggies lacked any pinch of salt or pepper. Both dishes were great, but slightly lacked a component to leave us saying wow, either presentation wise or flavor. Very friendly staff and great service. \u00a0Our server was adequate when we asked a few questions. The drink list had interesting choices and the wine list was a good size. \u00a0Price point was very fair.

I will start by saying I love sushi and sashimi. \u00a0I have eaten it all over America and at some of the best of the best like Koi, Nobu, and Roku in various cities like Vegas and NYC. \u00a0Downtown there are 3 good options, Dozo, Blue and Hiro. \u00a0I believe Hiro 88 wins by a razor and I'd give it 4.6 out of 5 overall (I rounded up to 5). Not only is the sushi/sashimi taste a little fresher then the others, \u00a0their sushi shokunin know how to cut and prep a proper roll or sashimi. \u00a0 They also have great Chinese style food and seafood, the Salmon Plank is some of the best prepared and flavored Salmon in Lincoln. \u00a0The bartender knew his business as well, on a previous visit we asked a lot of questions and he could answer detailed questions on several more exotic beers and wines. \u00a0He also could make a perfect old fashioned. \u00a0Sarah, part of the wait staff is great, she was so attentive and our glasses were never more then half full all night even though the place had no empty seats. \u00a0The location is great, as it is very close to Pinnacle Bank Arena. \u00a0Also of note, they have a private room in the back that holds up to 30 so its a great place for special occasions. \u00a0Almost nobody in downtown Lincoln has truly private rooms and I need to have business meetings from time to time and this room with its 70\" screen is great!Its the above reasons they win out over the other 2 downtown sushi places, although those are very good as well. \u00a0Tip: \u00a0Happy hour is the best time. All day Sunday and Mon - Fri 3 - 6pm and 10-12am. Discounted Sushi, apps, and drinks.Overall I would say if you are serious about Sushi try all 3 downtown Sushi places a few times with friends, order a diverse selection of Sashimi and Sushi and judge for yourself. \u00a0And be brave if you are a little scared of raw fish Sashimi. \u00a0Sushi grade fish like Sashimi Tuna is just as safe as any other protein and tastes better then Filet Minion that's cooked to a perfect Medium Rare. \u00a0Trust me, you might have found one of the greatest food your mouth will ever eat."], ["Elleen P.", "Came for sunday happy hour which meant good prices, and the sushi was alright.

Being defensive isn't the attitude of confidence, it's one of weakness. If someone was confident in their product and service, it could stand alone without Mr Knight of Yelp coming to the rescue. Honestly, this is how crazy this is: Charlie Y, whoever that is, needs to fight the customer so much that he/she honestly didn't even ask about my experience. He/she assumed I was another customer and started making excuses. WHAT?! Lol. What restaurant professional with ethics or wisdom does that stuff. Lol it's just beyond belief."], ["Jeffrey D.", "Being new to the area I just couldn't pass up a chance at sushi. \u00a0This upscale restaurant in the Haymarket area is good. \u00a0It is pretty busy so if possible make plans, but it was just me so I got a seat at the bar with no wait. Bar is fully stocked though. \u00a0I had the combo platter and a side of poke. \u00a0It was prepared well and presented well, the chef takes pride in his work. \u00a0Unfortunately really fresh is hard to come across in landlocked states but that is a problem unless you fly them in daily, which is not something I really would be interested in paying for since sushi is expensive anyway. \u00a0Overall, good atmosphere and good food, comparable price."], ["Elisabeth E.", "So this is an update to this review.. it has now become a regular place for me. I know I can eat here and never get sick and the extensiveness of the menu still astounds me. Where else can I get sauced and breaded gluten free amazingness? This place has officially won my heart. Nom!First of all let me start by complementing them on the most extensive gluten free menu I've seen since I've been eating gluten free. There is literally a massive page with tons of things you can have. Our server was also very knowledgeable about gluten free and really helpful with finding out any questions I had for me from the kitchen. The environment is nice and its in a convenient part of downtown in the newer part of the haymarket. Its right next to the parking garage which was convenient considering how cold it was that night. We were here for a birthday party and I enjoyed the salad with ginger carrot dressing which was great and the only one that is gluten free. I then decided to go against my usual sushi order and had the chicken with peanut sauce, sauces are something I have to be so weary of anymore so I was excited to see it on their gluten free menu. It was really good, I'd definitely have it again. My avocado roll and gluten free soy sauce was also nice. My friends were pretty satisfied with their meals as well and a few had some mixed drinks which they said were good.Overall, cost was pretty affordable so I'll be heading back there again sometime soon.

We were in the mood for sushi so we ordered off that menu -- some specialty rolls and some sashimi. It was all excellent. Even their crab rangoon were handmade, which I consider a marker of a restaurant that cares about details.We'll be going back to try the hot menu. It gets crowded on Sundays so if that's what you're after, I'd recommend going on another day."], ["Ken H.", "By far my favorite sushi restaurant in Lincoln. The place is always nice, I've never had to wait, and the service is perfect every time. Normally I manage to get the same server every time I go (Diana), and she's always been quick to take care of us when we sit down, and knows exactly when to come around and check up on us. I'm not a sushi expert. I probably couldn't tell you the difference between good sushi and great sushi, but I still love it. What I can say is that Hiro has a lot of great rolls that present a good combination of flavors and textures that one would expect from a great restaurant. Most importantly, for me, is the amount of fish you get in each piece of sushi, and Hiro won't disappoint like some places I've been. You can tell it's in there, but it doesn't over power the entire roll. That creates a good value for your sushi that can be hard to find.Of course in Nebraska you don't expect sushi to be cheap, and if it is you probably don't want to eat it, but Hiro won't break the bank. Even when it's not happy hour I don't have a problem going there and enjoying a couple rolls and a beer.The bottom line: If you want good sushi at a good price in a great location, Hiro is the place to go. Also, it's open late so it's a great place to end your night after having a few drinks."], ["BB S.", "Decent \u00a0service \u00a0sushi but not anything special. I have to give only two star because management seems far to focused on bottom line than providing a good dining experience. They failed to honer a perfectly good groupon on a ridiculous technicality. The parameters of this groupon are too stringent. I went in to Hiro 88 with three friends to use this coupon was told no matter how much food we ordered the Groupon would not be accepted if we did not have a fourth person. It is a completely Assinine rule considering we ordered a good amount of food. Perhaps I should have asked a random 4th person to sit with us for a few minutes.The quality of the food does not warrent a second visit."], ["Christa C.", "This is probably my least favorite sushi place in the haymarket.

After the almost completion of our meal one of my friends began to choke on a sushi roll where she later discovered a bone had still been in the fish of the sushi roll she had eaten. After that happened we brought it to the attention of our server who was doing a very nice job all evening, and he kindly took it away to show his manager Chadwick. The manager never approached us before he brought the other sushi roll and then came back with the same roll made in order to replace the one that had the bone in it. While a nice gesture, we had already finished our meal that this point. We had discussed it being comped and had told the manager there was no way we were going to eat that or take it home. He began to argue with us about how since the roll had already been mostly eaten that he wasn't going to take it off the ticket.We respectfully disagreed with that decision, after realizing we were not going to be treated what we felt was necessary for the previous events. We left the facility with a bitter taste in our mouth, you just lost yourself at least 4 customers, and after there is so much new competition for sushi places in Lincoln you would think they would be a little more thoughtful.

I also love the Mongolian beef (get it spicy!), but the yakisoba (tried it twice) could be fried a little more than they usually make it.Atmosphere is bright, clean, and new. Couldn't give it a 5 star because I'm reading the comments and the manager/owner could definitely do a better job of replying to the unhappy reviewers, as they are off putting and makes me not want to come back.

The goyza I ordered as an appetizer was fully fried and was also great. However that's those two are the only things I was impressed with. My second visit was much better. I ordered the Wasabi Stinger (sans jalape\u00f1o) and Columbia River rolls. Both were amazing, the Wasabi Stinger is definitely worth the price. The goyza I ordered as an appetizer (again) wasn't fully fried, but it was a good change from other sushi venues. I found out fried goyza is only available on the happy hour menu. The reason I gave Hiro88 3/5 stars is because of the poor treatment of my friend. She has a child and was not welcome in the restaurant. They \"don't have high chairs\" and don't cater to children. She was even told by management to get a babysitter next time she wants to enjoy the restaurant. Not something a food establishment should ever say to a paying guest.

I'd never seen a menu where you write on to show what you want to order. Cool! We ordered calamari, dumplings, asian ribs, and a Hiro 88 roll. The calamari and dumplings were under 7 dollars each, the ribs were 9, and the roll was 8-10. Plating was beautiful! I love the geometrical shapes of everything.

I am a crabrangoon lover, but the one's they make aren't my favorite. They're still good!

I go there often when I am down there, so I would like to think that i am a pretty good judge when It comes to comparing this new location in lincoln with the quality of their original location. This is what i found:The Meal:So, after seeing that my favorite restaurant opened a new location not 2 blocks from where i work, i promptly convinced a group of co-workers to come with me and try it out. Being one of my favorite places for a good pan-asian meal, I was planning on spending quite a bit.I ended up ordering Sushi (Philadelphia Roll with an order of Toro and an order of Salmon), as well as a lunch order of my favorite dish there, the Mongolian Beef.Appetizers: Miso SoupThe Miso Soup was delicious as usual, with plenty of tofu and nori. No complaints.Main Course: Mongolian BeefThe Mongolian beef was interesting. It was good, and easily better then any other Mongolian beef i've had in lincoln, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with the way the dish turned out. It's not that it was bad, but from my experience in Omaha, I knew that it could be so much *better*. The chefs in Omaha make the dish nearly to perfection, with plenty of Wok-hai (google it) and char/caramelization of the meat/sauce. \u00a0Lincoln's offering, on the other hand, tasted a little bit too sauce-y and undercooked. I was expecting a burst of awesome savory flavor when I took my first bite. What i got was just meh.Sushi: Philly Roll, Salmon, TunaThe sushi is where this review really starts to get disappointing. It was still better then Dozo's, but it just wasn't what i was used to when it came to Hiro Quality.The maki roll i got was a Philadelphia Roll, made in their old style, which is a substitution of raw salmon for the standard smoked salmon. It was good, but not eye-wateringly good like i've gotten in Omaha. The salmon didn't taste as fresh (which i will go into more below), and the portion was a lot less then i'm used to seeing in Omaha. I really didn't taste much of the fish in the roll to be honest, there was so much cream cheese that it kind of overpowered everything else.The Nigiri was also disappointing. The pieces themselves (2 per order) were too skinny -- they looked like the width of one finger, when normally (almost anywhere else you go), the chefs are trained to press the sushi to the width of two fingers. I don't know if this was a portion control thing, or if the chef just had really skinny fingers, but it definitely looked weird.As for the taste, I was non-plussed. Again, it was decent... better then i've had in many other sushi joints around Lincoln, but not tasty. Sushi is supposed to have a subtle taste, but I simply didn't taste anything from the pieces that I had.Conclusion:It's not that Hiro is bad, it's just i know from experience that the restaurant can be so much better, and its frustrating not to get the kind of quality i expect from their brand. All-in-all I spent about $35, which felt a little expensive for what i got here, although I would of happily spent that much and more in Omaha. The service, decor, and almost everything else was spot on, I just hope that their quality improves to the level that I know it can be. For these reasons, I give this restaurant 3 stars."], ["Emily W.", "Had dinner here on a Monday night and it was very busy. Nice decor and ambiance... perfect for a date night or girls night out.

He said \"we usually just bring the chocolate cake\"?! Ummm no. Lol Other than the missing salad weird dessert incident, service was lacking in other ways-- refills on water took a while, they didn't bring silverware with the entree, and they didn't split the check the way we asked. I would go again just for the atmosphere... since the modern upscale feel is harder to find around here."], ["Justin P.", "We ordered carry out on our way through Nebraska.

I should have known not to go to this restaurant after our good friend went to Hiro 88 a week ago for her BIRTHDAY with reservations, her and 3 friends went and had to wait a little over 45 minutes for their table, then it took almost am hour and a half for their food! We decided to try it because we got \u00a0a 50.00 groupon as a Valentines day gift ,I had called last week and spoke with Alyssa she answered the phone and I told her we would like to make a reservation I told her very clearly we had a Groupon and it was only my wife and I coming in for lunch at noon, she said that is great I asked if there was any stipulations on the Groupon she said not at all come in and use it, so we got to Hiro 88 and sat down within a couple of minutes. Our server I believe her name was Katie, I told her about the Groupon right away she said it can't be used for lunch and we had to have 4 people in our party, I then asked for the manager... The general manager named CHADWICK came to our table and said again we couldn't use it and we had been given false information, I asked if there was anything that could be don't his reply \" buy another Groupon for 10.00\" he DID NOT apologize and we told him this was our first time here.. He walked away and just said let your server know what your decision is if you want to stay or not, so after my wife and I decided we were already sitting and very hungry we stayed... The food was OK... We ordered the Hiro 88 rill it was mushy and lacked flavor, the southern roll with jalape\u00f1os which were almost non existent and pretty much just rice onions and seaweed.. Then we ordered another it was a spicy crab cream cheese roll that was better than the others.... After sitting for 1 hour and 15 minutes \u00a0to \u00a0general manager CHADWICK not once did he come over! He also DID NOT take anything off the bill and NEVER apologized, his general manager in trainee ANYTHING did a better job the next Chadwick! The trainee was able to take a 3.00 coffee off and that's it for us however he did apologize to us at least.... Sorry for the length of this however just because it's one of the new restaurants in the hay market DO NOT GO EAT AT HIRO 88 YOU WILL BE SAD YOU DID! Chadwick was the absolute worst general manager I HAVE EVER MET! or in the case really didn't meet because he never said his name! And one more thing...

That means hiring knowledgeable staff who are flexible and professional. \u00a0Yes you may have a server assigned to this area but until the main dining room is full, the server should be flexible, going where the guests want to sit. \u00a0The third table that arrived was seated in the only spot in the restaurant that had glaring sun streaming through the window. \u00a0Again, a little forethought on the part of the hostess can go a long way.We ordered two rolls. \u00a0Highly recommend the Wasabi Stinger. \u00a0Both rolls were big and tasty. \u00a0The service was quick. \u00a0Sushi and service is definitely better than Dozo. \u00a0Loved the decorations and imagine on a crowded weekend it will have a fun vibe to it.This place definitely has potential. \u00a0With only four or five reviews so far and almost alll of them mentioning customer service I hope management reads these and tries to get on top of their game.

It is a bit pricey, but you'll have that at any establishment like this. The atmosphere is nice and modern, which makes sense since it's 5 months old.

I am planning on going back to get the Chinese plates, they looked great. I've been twice. Once on a slow after noon and it was great in all aspects. The second time was for happy hour on a Friday.

Next time we are back in town we will come here!"], ["Dennis K.", "Service was good, food was decent, but I was not blown away. Good selection of sake, wine and beer. We tried an unfiltered variety of cold sake for $14, which yielded 5 shots. The salad dressing was bland -- was hoping for more ginger and some zing. The calamari was not bad. The small sushi plate came with 12 pieces and included salmon, tuna, yellowtail and shrimp, plus california roll and spicy tuna roll, $27. It's a little pricey, but you're paying for the location and the decor. Dinner for three came to $105 before tip. Still waiting for one of our local sushi joints to step it up and be impressive."], ["Ken K.", "Four of us went for Sunday happy hour, but when we arrived there was a sign taped to the door that there was no happy hour today. We asked about it and they said that they don't do happy hour when there's a show that day/night at Pinnacle Bank Arena. Understandable, and truthfully the happy hour deal isn't that great anyway, at least if you're not drinking.So before I get into it: I feel like sushi reviews for places around here are a touchy business, so I'm going to state my \"qualifications\" in order to help you decide how to take my review. I've had sushi at most of the places in Lincoln and Omaha, on both coasts, in a couple of big cities not on coasts, and even a couple of times in other countries, where seafood is a pretty serious business. I'm by no means a sushi expert, but I think it's fair to say that I'm a veteran.Amongst the four of us we ordered the sushi & sashimi combo (chef's choice, something like 15 pieces), a couple orders of nigiri (2 pieces per), a couple soups, a couple rolls, and an order of grilled jalepeno peppers.Our server was great. Very friendly, very patient (we kept sending her away while we decided, which took awhile) and pretty knowledgeable. She thoroughly explained everything that was on our plates when she delivered it (though she did need a cheat sheet), which I always appreciate, and feel should be mandatory at any sushi place. And throughout our meal I felt that she provided just the right amount of attention---not too much, not too little. I felt like the food took a little while to come out considering what we ordered, but not too long. In their defense, it was fairly busy. And I actually appreciated that we felt like a leisurely Sunday lunch was an option, as opposed to the typical \"rush job\" of trying to get you fed and turn your table over for the next customer. We were not rushed at all, and the bill didn't come until it was clear that we were finished. The atmosphere I also like pretty well. I guess I'd describe it as \"understated modern\". On one had it has the modern feel (that can sometimes end up TOO cold/clinically clean/trendy, which always makes me slightly uncomfortable) but there are some nice soft touches of wood and whatnot to balance it out. When I visited the restroom I saw outside the doors a quirky bit of art: a wall of fresh apples, each apple sitting atop metal pegs. I got a grin out of that and hey, the apples smelled nice! One nitpick: I was slightly surprised at the choice of chairs. The are white plastic with a light-weight metal frame, and while they have a look that compliments the modern thing pretty well, they just felt a bit cheap in comparison to the rest of the decor. Again, no biggie, just more a \"?\".Of course they have what seems to be the obligatory, excessive amount of tv screens (all tuned to football, it being a Sunday and all) but at least most of them were tucked away over the bar area, which is mostly hidden from view of the majority of the tables. And they had the good sense to mute them as well. The last thing I want when I sit down to a nice sushi meal with friends is a) blaring music or b) blaring televisions that I practically have to yell over to have any conversation. So...tip of the hat to Hiro 88 management for doing it right. And now, finally, the important part: the food. Maybe we got lucky and they'd just received their fish delivery but honestly, it was as fresh as could be. Tuna, salmon, salmon roe, striped bass, Cali roll....everything seemed cracking fresh and all the textures were right. I'm of the \"less is more\" camp when it comes to sushi and I usually don't care much for the more \"dressed up\" rolls---sticky sweet sauces, cream cheese, all that business---but the couple of bites I did try were pretty darn tasty. Again, well done, and not OVER done.I thought the presentation was good as well....understated and elegant, no excessive silliness to distract from the food. These guys seem to get that the food should be the star, not the chefs. Our soups (miso and hot and sour) were surprisingly good. I feel like those are pretty standard wherever you go, but my hot and sour was very good---not too thick/gelatinous, as it often is, and less sweet than most. The only thing I could really complain about at all would be the rice, which was fairly dry/chewy on some of our pieces (only 1/3---I suspect that maybe we got the end of one batch of rice and the rest was from a fresh batch?). I have to take that one star for that, just because well....sushi rice really should be spot-on at a sushi place, or it shouldn't be served. Overall, my experience with Hiro 88 (never yet managed to get to the one in Omaha) was as good or better than any I've had at any place here in Lincoln or Omaha. Maybe not quite California-level stuff, but seriously close! We will definitely be back, and it's easily our new favorite here in Lincoln."], ["Adrian B.", "Had our first experience on New Years Eve with an 8 o'clock reservation. \u00a0It was busy as expected but we were seated within 10 minutes which was nice as we had time to test the bar. \u00a0The cocktails were very well executed with fresh natural herbs and top shelf liquor.The layout of the restaurant is open plan and minimal as most Japanese restaurants are. \u00a0It's very easy on the eyes and comfortable. \u00a0My wife and I ordered the Szechuan Shrimp and Scollops separately. \u00a0Both dishes were fantastic, the seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection. \u00a0It was warming and spicy but yet still sweet, tasted like real Szechuan cooking should. \u00a0The rice was cooked well and just slightly sticky.The service was very polite and efficient, not overbearing and overattentive. \u00a0Really helped us start the celebrations off in the right mode. \u00a0Even if your not into Sushi there's plenty of cooked options from standard American Chinese food such as Mongolian Beef, \u00a0But the seafood is where it's at, the Chilean Sea Bass looks lovely. \u00a0We will be back and are recommending the place to all our friends. \u00a0Thanks again Hiro!"], ["Sheryl Z.", "The food, once we got it was good.

Same owners and host Simon, who has traveled to the new Lincoln store to help with the opening for a while. As you can see, I have frequented the Omaha location pretty frequently... I can recognize Simon! (The Asian parents love the all you can eat clams, crab, and crawfish...we end up here a lot) Since a lot of our family and friends from Lincoln would drive all the way to Omaha for the buffet, it's going to be very convenient for all the Asians in Lincoln to now get their seafood fix right in town. At $14/person for adults and $8 for kids, its a pretty good deal to eat all the mussels, crawfish, crab legs, and clams you want. It would cost more than that to buy it from the store and prepare it yourself. As for the other foods there, there is slightly less selection in comparison to the Omaha location, I think mainly due to space constraints. Most all of the American-Chinese favorites are still available.Quick service in clearing plates, having fresh food available at all times, and refilling the crab (most important ;) ).

The wait was long but I believe they were running a seafood/crab leg special for that occasion so that was to be expected. We wasted some time at the new hyvee and that worked out well.

It was so loud you had to stop your convo until it was over. They may need to look into turning that down a bit. So the food... I am not exaggerating that there were only 3 count em 3 Chinese entree dishes to choose from. I wasn't in the mood for crab legs so this left me very limited. It was general Tso chicken, a pork dish and a beef dish. That was all!! Besides those it was egg rolls, crab Rangoon, weird fish type dishes that I couldn't make fin or tails of. I just felt so limited in my choices. I did enjoy the crab Rangoon bc they were tiny half dollar size so it was fun to just pop em in your mouth. They did have sushi which looked fine, tasted ok, as most buffet sushi somehow is just a lesser quality then when you order your own rolls at a place dedicated to the art. No ice cream machine, instead they provide a cooler to scoop out of, with all the kiddos around it kinda grossed me out because they would pull their arm out of there with ice cream on the sides and lick it off, what if they went back for seconds?!Licked arm would touch the ice cream. I'm not usually weird about stuff like that but having a communal self scoop ice cream station just doesn't seem right."], ["Misty H.", "I've been to this restaurant several times. I honestly love it, they have great food. After 3:30 you can pay to upgrade your meal and get crab legs, crayfish and some other seafood options.

They all have the sushi spot aesthetic, ensuring you never mistake it for anything other than what it is. I do like their bar more than some places I've been to but at the end of the day, it's just another place to get sushi and Asian dishes.For a starter I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp as I am obsessed with this option at most sushi spots. What I got was interesting. Tail on shrimp, which I got over eventually, without much batter to speak of. They were good sized so I really wanted to enjoy them however between the sauce being a bit blah and lack of batter fried-ness I ended up sending it back. The waitress was a good sport about it, taking the charge off my final bill and inquiring in the kitchen about it (turns out the batter they used was \"off\" that day) so I let the issue rest.I tried their shrimp tempura roll will was another disappointment. I have a feeling half the ingredients weren't included, or I was just so over Dozo by this point I didn't notice. These rolls were huge, not something I'd normally complain about but in this instance it was just too much. You almost wanted to cut it in half to enjoy comfortably.

They have a great happy hour that goes from 3-6pm, and I definitely recommend you take advantage if you can!I will say when I first walked in I almost walked right back out. The smell of the place is so misleading! It literally smelled like a farm or a pet shop. Makes your stomach turn when you combine that with sushi, right? We decided to still stay and give it a shot. The place is decorated really cool and I like what they're trying to do. Nothing wrong with an upscale sushi joint with good drinks and specialty rolls. This place smells strange overall... the bathrooms were overpowered with some awful air freshener and I felt like I needed a new nose by the time I left.We sat at the bar and our service from the bartender was fantastic! We each got waters and I was over the moon when I saw they sold Zipang, so I got a bottle of that for us to split. Sparkling sake is my friend. Our meal started out with the avocado egg rolls, which were very good, as was the accompanying sauce.The only thing I didn't like was that the avocado was pretty brown. The rolls we got were all on the happy hour menu, and they were the Philly roll, the dozo crunch, and the cali crunch. All were very good! It was a really nice way to spend an hour in the early afternoon and I definitely recommend checking out happy hour. Hooray for good sushi at great prices!"], ["Stacey K.", "This is my second time to Dozo. \u00a0The slow service has not improved. \u00a0Angry customers waiting at the hostess stand were an indication we were not the only guests experiencing slow service, considering the place was almost empty on a Friday at high noon, this shouldn't have been a problem.The sushi itself is just o.k. \u00a0The rolls and the fish inside the rolls seem on the smaller side. \u00a0This is a minor issue but several things on the menu were crossed out with marker. \u00a0If the restaurant is no longer serving one or two things, fine. \u00a0But when the crossed off menu items reach 7 or 8, it may be time to order some new menus.My main complaint with this place is that my friend and I had a Downtown Lincoln gift card, Dozo's name was written in the literature that came with the gift card as a participating business. \u00a0When the manager said they do not honor the gift card we showed her the literature. \u00a0She still refused to honor the gift card saying she had told them to take their name off the particpating. \u00a0Well until they are officially removed from the literature or a sign is clearly posted on their door that they do not participate, then the gift card should be honored. \u00a0After haggling with her about best business practices she agreed to take it.After reading the other reviews here and my own experience, this restaurant clearly does not put the customer's satisfaction first. \u00a0They are more concerned with making a buck. \u00a0Any other restaurant would have comped the meal regardless of whether or not they still honor the gift card or not. \u00a0They would have said something like \"We no longer participate in this program. \u00a0We will honor it this time but not in the future.\"Nothing loses restaurant loyalty quicker than bad costumer service and mediocre food. \u00a0Lincoln doesn't have a ton of sushi options but all the rest of your choices are better than this."], ["Rowena L.", "I see some people saying that the place is inconsistent, but when I went it was pretty good, and this is from someone \u00a0who's had tons of sushi experiences around the world.

I got a few pieces of nigiri as well, but the rice wasn't very good, and even if the fish is superb, nigiri can't be good if the rice isn't perfect.

I feel like it was a middling place, but 3 stars is \"A-ok.\" Since this is really more of a \"meh\" restaurant, it gets 2 stars. But 2 seems harsh, because we had a good time. The food was mostly fine, but the service was below average.We had a spicy yellowtail roll, a Dynamite roll, a Dozo crunch roll, and an Atlantic roll. The Dynamite and the Atlantic were flavorless. The Dozo was pretty good, and the spicy yellowtail was excellent. Like I said, not terrible, but I've had better. In fact, I've had better in Lincoln - at Kinja. If you need a mnemonic to help you remember: Kinja rhymes with ninja, and Dozo rhymes with bozo. (This only works if you recognize in your heart that ninjas are awesome, and are more fun to have around than bozos).Also the waitress was friendly but slow, and the food takes a long time to get to the table. Yeah, it's sushi, and you want them to do it right, but you'd also like them to do it TODAY. We were there for 2 hours and those 4 rolls were all we ate.It seems like it's a nice place for a date.

I was excited about a sushi place opening up in the Haymarket since I live and work in the downtown area.I typically give restaurants a few tries before deciding how I really feel about them. Overall my first experience at Dozo was a good experience when it first opened. My next 5 or 6 were just below par with me leading to decide that Dozo is probably my last choice if I wanted to get sushi in Lincoln. Overall the pricing for the quality of the food isn't worth it. I work downtown and the only time I felt it was justified to pay for sushi at Dozo was if I went during Happy Hour. A common roll is a spicy tuna roll and if it manages to come out tasting like it came fresh..straight from the swamp...well, that's kind of a problem.The fried/crunchy rolls are pretty decent, everything kind of tastes good/gets masked when you fry it though...I will admit to some tasty spring rolls. That's probably the only thing I've had so far that I've found to be enjoyable. I'm sure the Haymarket location for them is kind of their only saving factor for still keeping some business though. As far as service goes, it's been off and on. Nothing particularly outstanding, nothing particularly awful.

I stood by the bar for several minutes with no acknowledgment from any of the three bartenders. Finally, some bar stools opened up so my friend and I claimed those and then decided to eat there.We immediately received service once we were sitting at the bar. We ordered what seemed like a simple order--a small sushi platter and a couple pieces of octopus nigiri. And we waited.After about 30-40 minutes, some women sat down at the open bar stools next to us. They ordered some drinks and some sushi.And we waited.About another 20-30 minutes later, the women next to us got their sushi.And we waited.Another 20 minutes later, I finally asked our bartender about the status of our sushi and it sounded like they had lost the order. She gave us a couple of glasses of free wine and then pushed our order through.When we finally got it, it was a solid meh. The spicy tuna wasn't spicy. Two of the pieces of nigiri, the crab and shrimp, tasted like they'd be sitting on a dirty basement floor.

Their happy hour is decent and they have good drinks, but their sushi is pretty bad, even for the Midwest. However, this last visit pushed me from thinking it's \"not good\" to \"really bad.\" The yellowtail tasted off (bad), the salmon in the crunchy Atlantic tasted like it came from a can, and there were bones in the eel nigiri. There are better options in the haymarket area now and I imagine Dozo will be gone before long. I certainly won't miss it."], ["Jennifer S.", "It's hard to rate Dozo because of how inconsistent it is, from the freshness of the fish to the service. On my last visit, I asked the server about their happy hour specials and he said, very rudely, \"the book is right in front of you. Read it yourself\". It's a little hard to come back from that and I had the taste of the server's bad attitude in my mouth for the rest of the night. I've also noticed that pretty straightforward stuff like a California roll is hit or miss- as in, sometimes it has cucumber, sometimes avocado, sometimes neither. They just don't have it figured out yet."], ["Mary F.", "Loved the downtown atmosphere and our waitress was very attentive. Our rolls were good though I don't remember the ones we had.

Granted I just moved from Hawai'i so I have high standards and my friend is from Tokyo so he has really high standards. Just don't order sushi or sashimi here and it;s not a bad place.I'd give this a 4 star for everything else. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and the appetizers and deserts were excellent.

While Lincoln does have a few sushi places, none of them have excited me for their lack of atmosphere. None of them are really all that nice or they are just are a side business as part of a Japanese Teppanyaki place.I had high hopes for Dozo, and my last two visits made me very happy!Atmosphere definitely an A. The decor kind of reminds me of Blue in Omaha. I liked the mural they had between the bar and the dinning area with creatures of the sea on it. I, of course, also liked that it has some Hawaiian inspired foods like poke, mai tais and red bean ice cream! The first time I ate there I had dinner and drinks with a friend of mine.We started with drinks -- they have a nice list of martinis and cocktails. (The bar areas also is nice and I can see Dozo as a fun place for people to go to for drinks and a roll for happy hour. They also have several Asian beers and sake, but never did get a very close look at the wine list.) I had an Elderflower Champagne and the Dozo Punch. I think we both agreed the drinks were good but not very strong. Next it was edamane, which was perhaps a bit too done, and seaweed salads. I actually had never had seaweed salad before, so I don't have anything to base this seaweed salad on, but I liked it! It had a nice nutty flavor. And it was big. We could of probably split one. We then ordered four sushi rolls. Our four rolls were a spicy yellowtail roll, one with octopus, an OMG roll which had crab salad, shrimp and asparagus and then our final roll, the Big Red roll which had seaweed salad it it and tuna on the outside of it. The OMG and Big Red were our favorite two rolls.On my second visit, my husband and I went for happy hour on a Friday night. The place was pretty full with a lot of people having dinner. We had the gyoza (vegetable and pork dumplings) appetizer and the Big 10 roll. Both were excellent. Our only complaint is that perhaps the rolls were not rolled quite tight enough. We had a couple pieces fall apart on us.So, overall, \u00a0I think I would give the food an A- and the service an A. Both times we ate there our food was out to us super fast. The first time I ate there it wasn't very busy, but the Friday night we were there it was, and our appetizer and roll were out to us in like 5 minutes. So, I was surprised to read that things were slow from some of these previous reviews. I am thinking things must of improved.The night my friend and I had dinner there (on a Wednesday night) \u00a0our waiter was also very attentive. The only thing that bugged me was the light above our table kept flickering, well, more like getting bright, then dark. But by the end of our meal, that had stopped and it went bright. Which I was glad because it was too dark at first and I had a hard time reading the menu! ha! When my husaband and I were there for happy hour we sat at the bar area, which last time I was there, I hadn't noticed the beautiful tile around the bar. It is very nice. And to top it off, we knew one of the bartenders who had previously worked at Barrymores.All in all, Dozo will be a nice addition to Lincoln's Haymarket and definitely a place I'll go back to. In fact, we are already planning our next visit and see it as a place to escape to for a nice and warm atmosphere as winter comes upon Lincoln, NE.Dozo offers an excellent choice of warm and cold appetizers -- calamari, oyster panko, firecracker shrimp, ceviche, lettuce wraps, etc. It offers a nice selection of soups and salads -- miso, nabe udon, etc. \u00a0It also has dishes for the non-fish loving people like teriyaki chicken, two cuts of steak, grilled chicken salad, pad thai and chicken or pork katsu curry. I would definitely like to go back to just have an entree some night. I think the almond butter salmon or mango salsa mahi mahi will make it to my plate!

And screw you odd hostess woman.  \u00a0The sushi was ok. The fish seemed very fresh and was of fine quality. But, there just wasn't any wow factor for us. (and I've been here twice now). I'm a fan of Tokyo and, also, of Blue (Omaha). I'm always impressed with the sushi in those restaurants, so I will probably steer clear of dozo and continue to go where I know I'll thoroughly enjoy myself.  As far as appetizers, the mussels are good. There are only 6, it's a light dish. I've also tried the avocado egg rolls and the calamari. I wouldn't recommend either. Brown avocado is not my cup of tea.. Drinks are meh. Dozo punch is sugary booze juice..so if you're into that, then have at it. I spelt mine on my white jacket and looked like an ass the whole night, because I'm pretty sure they lube up their glasses. So, I hate it. I tried the champagne with elderflower liqueur. I hate that too. Not because I spelt it, but because it is awful. The interior is great. Wonderful ambiance.  \u00a0 \u00a0Our service was perfect, outside of the hostess.

Then, he never came back to clean up the puddle-- and instead stood and chatted with other servers.

The rolls were definitely better than the nigiri, where the lack of freshness was pretty apparent. The unagi and salmon were okay, but the mackerel was really fishy and not good at all.

Having an uncluttered table is very refreshing along with excellent food and drink. \u00a0And I cannot stress enough how good the sushi is at Tokyo Steak, plus they have a very wide selection of rolls!Another thing that struck me about Tokyo Steak was the steps they took in creating a reasonably quiet yet vibrant ambiance. \u00a0From where we were seated we never felt like we were tucked in a corner but didn't feel as though we were sitting beside a busy highway of servers, customers, etc. \u00a0Having not frequented the former Grid Iron Grill, I have no comparison between decors. \u00a0However, Tokyo Steak's furnishings including a Koy pond looked excellent.All in all Tokyo Steak and Seafood House is a dining experience that cannot be beat for lovers of Japanese cuisine. \u00a0And it's not that hard on your wallet to boot. \u00a0Sadly, they are not open for lunch but this could change in the future and did not make me hesitate to give them all five stars. \u00a0Plan the start of your evening at Tokyo Steak and Seafood House real soon. \u00a0Enjoy!"], ["Brian B.", "I'll keep it brief. \u00a0Condition of the restaurant is acceptable at best. \u00a0Regarding the food; presentation was very poor however plentiful. \u00a0As far as taste, I found it to be acceptable but not impressive. \u00a0We chose to sit in the Sushi side vs the hibachi side of the restaurant and the service was by far the worst I've had anywhere in town.

Kinja also ranks near the top of my list for most creative ingredients & impressive presentation. There are two things a Japanese restaurant should have 1) Good sushi 2) Complimentary green tea. Kinja does not fulfill either criteria. I ordered an array of sushi rolls, but every single one of them did not highlight the fish. It actually seemed like they were trying to hide the fish by throwing on leaps and mounds of other ingredients. None of which complimented the main ingredient (well...except for the rice & nori). Another aspect I did not like was the fact that I was charged for hot tea. I feel like serving hot tea at a Japanese restaurant is a staple, just like serving guests water anywhere else. I felt like such a dork, when the waitress told me they had to boil water to make tea for me. I am grateful that I received an entire teapot & their choice was spot on (genmaicha - green tea with toasted brown rice). On a positive note, Kinja did have a wide variety of sushi roll - arranged on the menu by type (vegetable, raw, fire, deep fried). I ordered the Nebraska Volcano roll and it came out completely ablaze. Pretty cool I must say. I gave 2 stars because I did come to Kinja looking for good sushi. I would not go back if I get a craving, but would consider a re-visit if a friend wanted to see flaming rice."], ["Eileen G.", "Is it a risk to eat sushi in Lincoln, Nebraska - the heart of a city with a limited palate? Absolutely.The sushi is mediocre. I have eaten at some of the finest sushi restaurants in the U.S. I have also eaten at several (what would be considered) \"lower end\" sushi restaurants all over the country.The biggest issue I had with this place -- they toss every raw sushi roll (fish, not the vegetarian rolls) and every piece of sushi in ponzu sauce. You have to expressly ask them NOT to do this when you order.I have found that the LEAST sophisticated sushi bars pull stunts like this. They think they are being inventive when, in fact, they are being totally naive. Great fish should not be hindered by sauce. Beyond that, as a customer, I should be allowed to choose if I want sauce on my sushi or not. I do not want that choice made for me.The rolls have far too much rice and not enough fish. Very disappointing given how much they charge for rolls. California rolls are on the inside of many of their special rolls. Not exciting. The chef definitely did not reach very far into his imagination to create this menu.I have no plans to return. It simply isn't worth the price and the amount of instruction I have to give.

If I lived here I would not return"], ["Jeff C.", "In my years of enjoying Japanese cuisine all around the U.S., I find there are really three types: the uber premium blow your mind place of which there are very few, the rock solid traditional places and then the places that are riding the Asian food fad and usually feature \"fusion\". \u00a0More on this in a moment.Located in a strip mall with good parking availability, we had high hopes. A high ceilinged space in red, 8 seat sushi bar at the back and no sit down bar, although lots of table seating. Quickly seated at the sushi bar as is our usual custom - best chance to see what's really fresh and engage the guys behind the sushi bar. The case revealed the staple fish you'd expect although much of it is likely brought in frozen, not fresh. Unfortunately, our server (we were told not to order with the bar), who was trying really hard, knew nothing aobut Japanese food or its preparation. As other reviewers have noted, careful review of your order is wise advice that we should have followed. For instance, he didn't know wht Nori is. I get that they might not be familiar with some esoteric or unusual items (say, ankemo), but Nori? That's like not knowing what rice is. Meals over $10 come with a green salad - pale white really as it's the baggaged food service iceberg lettuce with a light creamy/seasame dressing. Followed by miso soup that sure seemed to be instant given the tiny uniformly cubic pieces of tofu. While good in a pinch, not what I epxect at a Japanese restaurant, but it was hot and tasted fairly good on a snowy night. I ordered Agedashi Tofu as a starter as well - its a staple in Japan and very simple to prepare. Tofu is coated lightly in corn starch and quickly deep fried and served with a small amount of tentsuyu broth grated daikon, sliced scallions and bonito flakes. They had the tofu right, but it went downhill from there with a sticky and super sweet sauce drizzled on it making it taste more like fried tofu french toast than Agedashi TofuWe ordered a mix of sushi nigiri, Hamachi sashimi and a roll. Restaurant was about 75% full and it took quite a long time for the sushi to come across from the bar. The fish itself was, overall, fair. Nothing was bad, but really, nothing was at all memorable. With the exception of the salmon, they fish was all relatively bland and the special request we had made for the one roll was ignored (we wanted to ensure the unknown Nori was on the outside, not inside out). Portions were large and the rolls are really big. We tried the lobster roll as a follow up and found pieces of shell. So in terms of categories, this is a place riding the wave of Asian fusion food, and frankly doing a mediocre job of it. So if you're measuring your sushi satisfaction by portion size, unique rolls that don't follow traditions of Japan, you'll like Kinja. If you're looking for a more traditional experience, or to enjoy the subtle and sublime flavors that sushi really can offer, this may not be the place.

There were about 5 tables seated in this fairly small strip mall location (though they pack a lot in). Three sushi chefs and a bunch of servers were mostly standing around the whole time we were there. It looked like some staff needed to be cut for the night. While they were very attentive in refilling our beverages, removal of plates from the table could have been more efficient. Waiter gangs notwithstanding, service was above-average for a Lincoln restaurant.We ordered the sushi combo \"B,\" which was a pretty good deal. On all of our sushi, the fish was fresh and the platter attractive, though the rice was a bit gummy. Both fish and rice were at just the right temperature for full flavor enjoyment. The fish was fresh, too, and there was a good variety in the chef's selections as well (yellowtail, white tuna, eel, shrimp, salmon, snapper, and two cuts of red tuna).Timing of our meal was unfortunate, however. We had all of our food within 10 minutes of ordering, and 90% within 5 minutes. The Kiss of Fire roll we ordered a la carte came even before our soup and salad! Literally, it arrived two minutes after ordering. The entire combo \"B\" showed up 5 minutes in - just after our soup and salad. The last thing we ordered - two-piece scallop sushi - came by the 10-minute mark. Besides seeming like an overwhelming amount of food, we would have appreciated the chance to enjoy our soup and salad first. Man, these sushi chefs are quick; that's probably a selling point at lunch, but they might want to tone it down at dinner time. I have never been served sushi this fast anywhere.The strangest moment in our meal came when another server or manager approached our table and asked if we needed anything else, such as condiments for our sushi. I asked for more soup and he said he couldn't do that. Really? At least offer me the chance to pay for another bowl!The menu had a few typos (\"Poor Katsu,\" anyone?), but was rather extensive. There were several items outside of the sushi that I would return to try. There are Udon noodle soups, noodle stir-fries, traditional teriyaki stir-fry dishes, and some contemporary appetizers - not to mention several of the creative twists on sushi that everyone both expects and feels a need to try.Overall, a good addition to Lincoln's dining scene, and a decent experience considering they've only been open for about a month or so.

Probably about 5-10 min later I got my dumplings but it took over 20 minutes from then to get my miso. So I dug into that with pretty high expectations to overcome the wait. Well it met them all. It was delicious. I added some Mayu and table-side chili oil and it was everything I wanted it to be. As I was eating the server came to apologize and grabbed my ticket to say it was on them due to the long wait. Overall, my experience turned from bad to great pretty quickly. My tip would be to customize your dish to your spice and flavoring liking and enjoy!"], ["Patrick T.", "Pretty stellar bowl of goodness here! I got the tofu curry noodle thing and it made me sing a song of joy in my mouth! I also got an order of vegan dumplings that made me sing as well! The layout of this place is really cool, sushi type bar in the round, with tables to the outside! They recommend choosing chop sticks of over silverware and they give you a little piece of asian candy to top the meal off at the end! The service was great, they hooked us up with free tea, and the price was right! I hadn't eaten all day, and if you are only going to eat one meal this is the spot to hit in downtown Lincoln!"], ["Erik Y.", "Amu Ramen Bar is a breath of fresh air for lunch. \u00a0Very tasty and way different. \u00a0Lincoln has so many chain restaurants and sandwich shops my head hurts just thinking about it. \u00a0I like a turkey sandwich as much as the next guy but I don't want to be forced into communism choices for lunch options!Amu Ramen offers pork, chicken, and vegan noodle options with such choices as Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Miso, and Tan Tan Men. If you visit you must try the homemade dumplings. \u00a0Get there early though because they run out on busy days. \u00a0They have inventive add-ons like half an egg and fresh garlic that can tailor your ordered Ramen to your liking."], ["Koshya W.", "All my favorite things in one place: miso ramen and Thai chai. First off, this ramen bar is aesthetically pleasing, nice decor and very cozy. But, what I had received for my meal, I wouldn't mind sitting in a shack in trade with how great the quality of service and food was at Amu Manu. Our server was great, and rocked out the whole dining room himself while still being very attentive and timely. I ordered the Miso Ramen with an extra egg, chicken, and the house chili sauce on the side. For my drink, I got the Thai chai (Thai tea) which came in a can - it was the Taste Nirvana brand so I can't complain. All for around 10$, you get a pretty big portion with the perfect ratio of broth to noodles. The ramen was presented so beautifully that I was hesitant to even dive in. The egg was poached so perfectly, nice solid egg white with a gooey yolk, yum! I've had miso broth at about every Asian restaurant know to Nebraskans and this knocks everyone else out of the park. Definitely could tell it was a miso paste base rather than a powder from a package. I will be taking more impulsive Lincoln trips to accommodate my ramen addiction!"], ["Erin H.", "Nadir does it again! This is my favorite local eatery. I find myself craving this mouthful of flavor most days. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and have never been disappointed by service, food, pricing, or atmosphere. I have even ordered cups of broth when I am sick and drink it by the cup. So much flavor in everything, but not too much to where the average pallet it overwhelmed. It is the right amount of everything. I love this place and can't wait to see what Nadir brings to Lincoln next!"], ["Susan B.", "Yummy food! Unique textures and favors with a cool, laid-back vibe.

In each bowl, you get fresh ingredients with classic ramen, udon, or gluten-free rice noodles topped with pork, chicken, mushrooms, or tofu. Customize your bowl with various add-ons like fresh garlic or a soft-boiled egg and be sure to go early to snag a pair of homemade dumplings--they run out fast."], ["Dustin A.", "The food, customer service, and facility was good. However, overall the food was bland. If you have eaten ramen in Japan you'll know the difference."], ["Jeffrey D.", "This ramen shop was ok. \u00a0With all the hype, I was a little disappointed to be honest. \u00a0The interior looks like a partially finished bar was gutted and a few tables and chairs were slid in to fill space. \u00a0If they concept is minimalist, the mission accomplished. \u00a0The noodles were ok, but they did not seem as fresh as the ones I have had anywhere. \u00a0Even though the menu is fairly basic the server got our order wrong and had to send one bowl back. \u00a0Overall, the food is ok and it will not break the bank."], ["Gabriel G.", "I swung by here with a couple of friends about a week or two after it opened. I was a little skeptical of a ramen restaurant randomly opening up in the midwest... but I'll be damned if it wasn't delicious! The bowls they give you are absolutely massive.Customer Service* [4/5 Stars]:Although it took quite a while to get our menus and drinks (when it wasn't even busy), our waiter seemed pretty chill and responsive to any needs for refills. Since it's a small restaurant, customer service wasn't really a huge part of the experience, for better or for worse.*Update: The second time I went here, our waiter was incredibly speedy. Food* [5/5 Stars]:The portions here were gigantic... and every bite was delicious. I got the Pork Belly Miso Soup, which had some incredibly tender pork, fresh corn, some sea weed, and an egg (which I added for a small charge). It was a little difficult to eat, at first, but after like 5 minutes I got the hang of it.Believe it or not, for as good as the main dish was, the highlight of my experience there was actually the order of wontons. On request, I got one Vegan Wonton and one Pork Belly Wonton and was incredibly surprised by how flavourful they were. Next time I go, I'm buying a double order of the prior variety.The whole thing ended up costing me around $11 (without the tip)... and it was completely worth it. A fun new experience with a respectable value.*Update: This time around I got the beef Tan Tan Men and it was so damn good. It bumped up my rating from 4 stars to 5.Atmosphere [3.5/5]The restaurant itself was cute, with subtle Japanese decoration all around. The interior was not essential to the experience by any means, but it was pleasant."], ["Allison H.", "I ordered the special stir fry with tofu and my boyfriend ordered the vegan miso ramen (number 6). Both were delicious and extremely generous portions (too much for me, but none of it went to waste : )). We also got an order of the vegan dumplings, which were so awesome we got seconds. The waterless and her trainee were extremely friendly and accommodating. The only negative to the restaurant is the cocktail/beer selection is pretty terrible and there is no wine - I would suggest getting drinks somewhere else before or after and just enjoying the delicious food!"], ["Yoko S.", "update on July 28, 2015I went there the third time a few months ago. I was not too happy with the taste or the preparation. The soup was not hot. The noodle was just as clumped up as before. I was so disappointed that I have not gone back there since. update on June 14, 2014.I have tried their Shoyu Ramen with chicken, and Tantan men. I did not care for either. Their dumplIng was good, but it came with sweet sauce in the plate, which was too sweet for my taste. I will try Miso next time, but if you want semi authentic ramen, stick to Tonkotsu. Original reviewI often start my review with those words, but I am from Japan. The land of Japanized Chinese noodles called Ramen. Good ramen from a ramen shop is something I try to eat as soon as I go back to Japan.I heard a rumor before that we would have a ramen shop here in Lincoln, Nebraska. When I learned the restaurant was finally open, I had to go there.I ordered Tonkotsu although my favorite flavor is Shoyu (soy sauce) because Shoyu Ramen came with chicken, not pork belly. I wanted to eat my ramen with pork belly, just like they do in Japan. It would be nice if they had a choice of pork or chicken with Shoyu flavor too.The ramen that I got looked very authentic. It would have passed as ramen straight from Japan. Soup was good. The pork belly was good (so tender and tasty!). The not-so-well-done egg ( those eggs are supposed to be runny inside and well done outside) was divine and better than some ramen shops in Japan! I loved the \u00a0chopped green onions. Just like they do in Japan. Large Nori was good. They told me they make everything in house except for noodles. Oh, noodles. I thought that was the only two things they could improve. They were rather hard but soggy. In Japan, they usually boil noodles just before serving the dish at ramen shops. I was not sure if that was what they did at Amu Maru. The other thing I would change is to make the soup dashi stronger. It is still good now, but make it more flavorful with Umami. I am giving five stars despite those two changes I like to see, because the food is still good and I really really want the restaurant to succeed and stay here. I need a place to eat Japanese ramen.The amount of food was fine for me, but for ravenous college students it may not be enough. I think it will be a great midnight snack after drinking (what we do in Japan)."], ["Joe S.", "Guess I'm spoiled, as I used to live close by Shen Sen Gumi in Fountain Valley, California, a ramen spot that boasts long lines, transcendent broth and wonderful noodles.I went into Amu Manu with an open mind, but unfortunately it was just not good. I had the #3 with Miso broth and chicken, my friend had the #2 with chicken. Where to start? The ramen was broken, in short pieces and undercooked. The chicken, while moist and perfectly cooked was cold, and the broth in both bowls bland and lukewarm. \u00a0Very disappointing. \u00a0The service was okay. I am somewhat amazed by all the good reviews for this place because it really falls short of the ramen mark."], ["William P.", "I've been looking forward to trying this place for awhile, and I had heard great things. The experience that I had lived up to the expectations.The ramen was very good and flavorful. We tried the dumplings, and they were great as well. Our servers were friendly and helpful with explanations and recommendations. The space/seating is somewhat communal, so it might not be the best place for a private lunch/dinner. Will be back here for sure."], ["Eamon H.", "I've only been once for lunch but it was a great breath of fresh air. A very nice addition to the downtown scene.I had \"Tan Tan Men\" (#4 for us round eyes) and it was very good. Soft Udon noodles, ground pork, bok choy and other goodies in a spicy broth. It was surprisingly subtle in other seasonings. I actually was looking for a salt shaker but didn't really need it. I had a dumpling \"appetizer\" before on the waiter's recommendation and it was maybe the best gyoza-type dumpling I've ever had. Fantastic- light as a pillow, flavorful and very clean tasting.I'll definitely be back to try some other bowls. It's a little pricy for a lunch- I spent $12 on soup, dumpling and tea. (incidentally, the iced tea tasted \"from a gun\" and not \"from a brew\" so you may want a soda instead if you are a tea aficionado.Incidentally: I paid cash and as I frequently see in mom-and-pop restaurants: the cashier didn't ring it in.

I will be a regular soon. The cucumber lemonade was fantastic and fresh. Give this place a try and maybe we can get them to be more popular and be open more nights ;)"], ["Ryan C.", "I'm pretty blown away as to how this place receives great reviews. This place serves, bar far, the most bland Tonkatsu Ramen I have ever had. Not that I'm an expert at Ramen or anything, but I've had my fair share. You should be able to eat the broth by itself and it should stand on its own in flavor. It makes me wonder how much time and energy this place puts into their broth. I bet it literally took 15 minutes to make their restaurant broth. It should take DAYS to make a good broth, boiling down pork bones to develop rich flavor. I had a few bites and I couldn't eat the rest. The pork belly, or what I thought was pork belly was sliced paper thin and there were only 3 pieces. They did cook the egg right, so that was the only good part worth mentioning. Their dumplings were really chewy when it should have been soft and the sausage filling was masked by something spicy. I'm thinking probably a jalape\u00f1o, but as to why they would do that to a dumpling I'm not really sure. They should look into making soup dumplings. I dunno, I was just really disappointed with this place. Pretty much robbery to charge 8 dollars for a tasteless bowl of ramen. Never going there again."], ["Andy M.", "This is a fantastic addition to the Lincoln dining scene from the owners of Oso Burrito (they replaced Oso's downtown location with this concept). Unlike burritos, there is absolutely no competition for what this place is doing, and it is something sorely needed in Lincoln. After all, who doesn't love a well-made bowl of noodles?As far as I could tell, everything was made in-house - from the udon and ramen noodles, to the broths in the soups, to the wrappers on the dumplings. This certainly comes through in the food. It is a small menu and there is nothing wrong with that: just 8 soups and dumplings until they run out. This will probably expand in the future, but for now it is just perfect as they test the waters. Likewise, they are only open for lunch Mon-Sat, and not accepting credit cards for now.My wife and I shared several orders of dumplings to start - tender, savory, perfectly cooked, if a bit heavy-handed on the garlic. We then moved on to the tonkotsu (pork belly ramen), which was very satisfying: noodles with just the right amount of resistance, velvety broth, and a perfectly cooked egg to finish - its runny yolk waiting to be ladled up. We also tried the classic Tan Tan Men (ground pork udon), which was a symphony of flavors: spicy broth, tingly szechwan peppercorns to balance, pickled vegetables that were surprisingly sweet, and of course some awesome udon noodles to absorb all those flavors.The lack of a drink selection perhaps deserves mention. I'm sure they are working to change this, and as someone who usually chooses water to accompany a meal, I was not really offended by this being the only choice (again, as far as I could tell). But a drink menu and even some Japanese choices would be welcome at some near point in the future.I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 3 out of the 8 soup choices are completely vegetarian, even. We will be back to try the remainder very soon. My advice is to do the same before this place gets too busy to get into."], ["Jeanna S.", "Had high expectation before going since all my friends just couldn't stop talking about how good this place was, so I finally decided to give it a shot and was really disappointed. They have that kinda Ramen that looks like those dried instant ramen you buy from the store then was cooked with a bunch of ingredients to make it look like restaurant made. I had some really good Ramen back in California so this really isn't what I'd go back for. Broth was okay, had flavor but nothing special. I think they are over-charging a bit considering the size."], ["Dave M.", "I was recently in Lincoln with my daughter attended the national roller skating competitions. We stumbled upon Amu Manu Ramen which is about a block north of the Pershing Center. I was really surprised to see that Lincoln had a ramen place. We gave it a try and it was fantastic. I can only report on the tonkotsu. It was piping hot (which is very important in soup!) The noodles were just-right al dente. The egg was perfectly soft boiled and marinated. The pork belly was cooked soft but still had fat on it. The broth had depth and buttery salty umami goodness.My only qualm was that the broth had a ginger taste that was a too far forward in the flavor profile. Part of this was the marinated bamboo shoots, but I think it was also the broth. Maybe this is this restaurant's style? It's not something I'm used to . The other soups looked tempting. I'm bummed I wasn't in Lincoln long enough to give them a try, including the veg options.Is the shop new? It needs some breaking in maybe. It has a little too much in the way of a cerebral bro vibe. I felt like it was too conceptual and not how I envision a good ramen shop. The bar, for example felt a little barren, lacking wabi sabi. (Also parts in the inside of the bar where not whipped down.) The interior design was well conceived but needs some sort of (feminine?) balance. Still, five fucking stars because I had amazing ramen in Lincoln. Good job, people and thank you."], ["Chad A.", "One night I was really craving authentic Japanese ramen, and I wished that there would be a ramen bar in Lincoln. \u00a0Miraculously enough, two months later, I hear about Amu-Manu Ramen Bar.I had the Tonkotsu, the first item on their menu, which was a pork belly ramen with pork broth, egg, seaweed, and strips of pork belly. \u00a0It was presented beautifully, and I can safely say that I've never had a better bowl of ramen in my life. \u00a0For $8 a bowl, they give you really generous helpings, plus it doesn't cost too much money to add an extra egg or complete order of noodles.

I absolutely love the Tonkostu. The pork belly is so tender it melts in your mouth. My third time going there, I was even able to substitute the ramen noodles with the udon noodles to give it a try with that specific dish. Not only was I accommodated with the request, it was absolutely tasty! Service has been VERY quick all the times I have gone so far. Perhaps the only thing I'm not very knowledgeable on is their drink selection if there is a small drink menu. I've seen some of the workers sport some Zipline hats and overheard a couple people order some beers but I wasn't sure what they carried.

The tonkotsu broth was generally good, but a little on the sweet side; the shoyu was intensely mushroomy, to the exclusion of other flavors. I chalk this up to the plain brown crimini mushrooms in the broth, which seem to have pervaded the entire broth.The noodles were pretty mediocre dried noodles. If you're going to stake your business on ramen, and you aren't going to make your own noodles, at least source some top-notch dried noodles.The toppings were insufficent -- the tonkotsu only had pork, half an egg, and a tiny smattering of pickled bamboo -- and highly variable. The pork belly was *awesome*, the egg was perfectly cooked, the bamboo was sweet and barely pickled. The shoyu was similarly inconsistent. \u00a0We got some dumplings, which were small, cheap, and ... interesting? Someone went a little crazy with the five spice.Portions were fairly small; $8 buys you twice as much pho, for instance, at any number of places on N 27th. I'm not complaining, though, and neither is my desire to lose this persistent gut of mine, but that could be a negative for lots of people.The service was similarly passable -- timely, but they seemed to forget a lot of things (our dumplings, a fork for my daughter, etc.), and I would have happily ordered another beer if they had bothered to come back around after a while. The restaurant also only has configured interior seating for two, so if you're going with a group and don't want to sit at the bar you might have a wait on your hands.I'll probably go back to try the miso, but I'm going back because there's nowhere else in Lincoln to get this sort of thing, and because I want to encourage these sorts of businesses in Lincoln, not because the restaurant was particularly amazing."], ["Rose L.", "Excellent ramen.

We used the red chinese hot sauce which is on the table for these and this elevated the taste. They now serve a good selection of beers including the Japanese \"Sapporo\" brand.
