{"Parthenon Restaurant": [["Elisabeth E.", "Came in here a couple weeks ago for the first time and was really pleased. I've seen the chain a few different places but never had the opportunity to try it. The restaurant has a really cute feel to it with an intimate atmosphere and adorably decorated. We were here on a weekday around dinner time and were seated and our order taken quickly. The menu has a lot of good options and it made it hard to choose, so obviously I'll just have to be back to nom again sometime soon! We decided to go with the mussels appetizer in a white wine sauce which was good but the type of mussels they had were quite a bit smaller than I'm used to, must have been a different type of mussel, but they were still good. The seafood souvlaki was awesome and the lamb shank had unbelievable flavor. There are a lot of gluten free options and I had plenty to choose from.Food quality and quantity were good, price affordable, and service excellent.. I'll be back for future noming."], ["Don M.", "I am certainly no expert on Greek food. \u00a0But I know what I like. \u00a0The Parthenon has consistently amazing food and superior service. \u00a0 Not only that but they regularly offer different and unusual cuisine outside of what you would consider \"Greek.\" \u00a0 The wait staff will usually take the time to chat with you and make you feel like you are family. \u00a0Stopped in today and had the beef souvlaki on rice with fried Zucchini fingers. \u00a0For an apetizer I had the Potato Zucchini soup. \u00a0All was delicious. \u00a0 One of my favorite restraunts in town. \u00a0I just wish it was closer. \u00a0 Give them a try. \u00a0OPA!"], ["Lindsay G.", "I felt like I need to update my review, since in our experience it seems like Parthenon has slipped the last couple times we have been. Went tonight and tried the calamari as an appetizer. The breading had good flavor, but crumbled off the second you touched it and all we were left with were plain pieces of rubbery calamari that were hard to chew. I tried the moussaka, which was ok but the top was very burned in some places as was the bottom, so I ended up not being able to eat 1/3 of it. The slaw I had as one of my sides had so much vinegar that it was completely inedible. My boyfriend's side of zucchini had so many tomatoes it should have just been called pasta sauce. The good news was that the gyro was great as always. I think from now on we'll just stick to gyros and fries."], ["Julie M.", "Our food was GREAT! The staff was really helpful, and the portions were huge--definitely share worthy. The gyros platter, Greek salad, and vegetarian pastitsio were delicious. Loved the lemony Greek potatoes, and the saganaki was melty and crispy and delicious. Extra charge for the pita might be my only complaint. Go alone, with family, with groups--just go! Although I am saying $$, you can get by on the low side very easily and the portions are so big you could split the bill!"], ["Jonny K.", "Been here quite a few times. Love the Dolmathes and the Orzo stuffed peppers. Could eat the hummus and pita bread as a meal itself. The baklava ice cream is amazing. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow. About the only place to find good Greek food in the area."], ["Holly H.", "I absolutely love this place. The service is great and the servers are very helpful with recommendations. I'm crazy about the salmon, but I've never had anything here that wasn't excellent. I once had baked butternut squash as a side and it's the best I've ever had. You won't find better (or fresher) hummus anywhere. The dessert case is a magical sight to behold, too."], ["Laurie A.", "Seems to be slipping... went last night early and the place was nearly empty. \u00a0Immediately a group of people was seated right next to us... in an empty restaurant. \u00a0We ordered and I asked to sub a salad for both of my sides. \u00a0Why on earth do you charge $2.00 for a side salad when I'm not taking any of the side dishes is beyond me.. and why do you offer sides that are all carbs when I'm ordering a pasta based dish? \u00a0You accommodated me and my request so that was nice. \u00a0Our food arrived and my salad was swimming in dressing.. almost to the point of being inedible. \u00a0My friend's fries were not done so another order was sent in. \u00a0The pastisio was bland. \u00a0I've had it there before and don't remember it being so bland and tasteless. \u00a0The service was amazing, atmosphere great, but I don't think we'll be back."], ["Jeffrey D.", "To be honest I sort of knew what to expect. \u00a0They cater every week at work. \u00a0The food is good and lots of it. \u00a0I get the gyros at work and they are loaded with meat and come with a huge salad. \u00a0We opted for a slightly different menu. \u00a0The pita break was super fresh and so good, a great start was the humus sampler. \u00a0The entrees were very good too. \u00a0The service was also good. \u00a0Overall a great place for taste, value, and service."], ["kristen m.", "I am a super picky and enjoy very few places like I did my lunch today. The chicken gyro was delicious! The pita soft warm and fresh, the chicken juicy but not gross it seems uncooked juicy, tender and incredible flavor and the tzatziki sauce was delicious as well. Additionally, \u00a0I treated myself to a honey cookie and that also didn't disappoint. Another incredible plus was the super nice, super sweet and helpful waitress who took care of me! I will definitely be coming back in the hopes of a repeat!"], ["Erik Y.", "From Yelp: Best Greek Restaurant in Lincoln. \u00a0They know how to do Greek food, and the atmosphere and menu is full of good options. \u00a0My personal favorite is the lamb suouvlaki. \u00a0It is perfectly seasoned and very tasty. \u00a0For an appetizer you really want to try the Saganaki, it is a large piece of cheese they set on fire. \u00a0Very cool presentation and tastes great. \u00a0Their gyro entr\u00e9e is also very good with homemade tzatziki sauce (mix of \u00a0yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, sault, olive oil, lemon juice and dill.) \u00a0The flavor is great and the pita bread is excellent. \u00a0They tend to put to much dressings on their salads so you may want to tell them to go easy on their dressing or have it on the side and add it yourself.For dessert they have a ton of great options like Baklava, melomakarona cookies, and other assorted cakes and pastries that have a combination of honey, nuts, chocolates, and cakes. \u00a0You could probably eat something different over 15 different visits and enjoy them all.They also cater, and I have used them to cater a few events and they always do a nice job."], ["Hope G.", "My boyfriend and I went there for a casual dinner and we got a five-star meal and experience. There are so many options for appetizers as well as main courses and don't even get me started on the desserts. Unfortunately we did not save room for desserts but we plan on going back for just desserts as there were so many beautiful desserts to choose from. I ordered a classic gyro with the hazelnut broccoli as my side. The broccoli was the best broccoli I have ever tasted and the gyro did not disappoint. Our server's name was Allan and he was also one of the best waiters that we have ever had. He was extremely helpful with choosing menu items and gave a wonderful description of the specials. I cannot wait to go back and try some different menu items because I know everything I try will be a delightful experience. **I only write reviews if I have a really good experience or a really bad experience. This was definitely worth taking my time to write the review**"], ["Echo D.", "Very \u00a0impressived restaurant in lincoln. The \u00a0owner say hi and thanks to all customers when they leave. They have many different kinds of Greek Mediterranean menu. I really liked humus sample."], ["Katy P.", "Love it! The broiled baby octopus app is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The saganaki is really good, too. For entrees everything I've ever tasted is great. favs so far are Braised Lamb shank which is amazing, and veggie moussaka! I love their pilaf, and the Greek fries are a must. The deserts are out of this world. 3 people could easily share a pastes... So rich!!!! But delicious. This has become my favorite place in Lincoln."], ["John R.", "A staple in our date night restaurant repertoire. \u00a0 Consistently good food.As far as appetizers, get the hummus sampler. \u00a0 While the Spanikopita and Tiropita are really good, we've fallen hard for the hummus. \u00a0 My favorite would have to be the sun dried tomato hummus-tastes like pizza with a little zing to it. \u00a0 \u00a0I could just about live on Parthenon hummus.I've had several of the main dishes. \u00a0 I had the lamb a few years ago on Easter. \u00a0It was perfect. \u00a0No complaints at all. \u00a0 The gyros are also really good. \u00a0But the entres cannot compare to what I believe is the ultimate expression of the pasta side: \u00a0the kritharaki. \u00a0 Get it. \u00a0Get an extra side of it and take it home. \u00a0 Simple orzo pasta, olive oil and tomato sauce and yet all those flavors combine to form a unique taste that I cannot get enough of ever. \u00a0 My wife has tried making it at home and come pretty darn close but the Parthenon's recipe is not to be duplicated. \u00a0 Let me repeat myself: \u00a0Get some of it. \u00a0You want some. \u00a0Then, if you're not stuffed to the gills by the generous portions, go shop the dessert cases. \u00a0 I have \u00a0had several of their desserts, I have no recommendations-you simply can't make a bad choice."], ["Kimberly M.", "We visited Parthenon for a date night 1/31/2015. Due to eating preferences and food allergies between the two of us, we often choose chains so that nutrition/allergen information is readily available. I'm always nervous to try local places for those reasons, even though I would truthfully prefer to support local establishments. Anyway, I can tell you the food was fantastic. I'll describe some of those dishes below. But I also want to say that I mentioned my food allergy to the server who assured me I would be taken care of only to disappear and come back a few minutes later with the owner. I'm ashamed to say I've forgotten both of their names now (I think our server was Judy?)... but I will absolutely not forget that kind of customer service. The owner said to me that he has a relative with food allergies and was very kind about answering any questions I had or making any needed modifications to my meal selections. I've had proprietors at other establishments openly display their annoyance before, so this was a most welcome and relieving helpfulness. When you treat a customer that way, you are guaranteed to have my business and support. Now, onto the food. Appetizers- hummus was very flavorful and the pita bread was substituted with fresh cut veggies (celery, carrots, cucumbers). I usually eat hummus with some kind of chip or bread but this was a healthy alternative that I'm now actually going to enjoy in my own snack-life! We read a lot about the flaming cheese... will have to try that next time!For the meals, I had a difficult time deciding between the lamb and seafood souvlaki. The owner described the seafood souvlaki as his most underappreciated dish that he personally prides himself on. But I was really hankering for the lamb, so the seafood will be my choice the next time. The seasoning was perfect and the meat was well cooked. The first bite had me saying \"mmm\" so that's always a good sign. The rice pilaf and the \"side of the day\" (green beans tossed in a light oil) were also very flavorful. My boyfriend chose the stuffed salmon with rice pilaf and the lobster bisque soup. He said that the salmon was great, the rice was very good, and the lobster bisque was amazing. I didn't choose to order any but I did sample a bite of his.... and I'll definitely have some of that next time! No dessert for us. I did enjoy some Greek wine. That was a new one for me but I really enjoyed the wide variety of options and the selection I made (after a recommendation from the server) was paired well with my meal (can't remember the name of that, either). Overall, a 5-star experience for the food and the level of customer service we received."], ["Steven D.", "Great food. \u00a0Had the gyro sandwich with a caprese salad. \u00a0Great balsamic vinegar. \u00a0Wait staff was very courteous and attentive."], ["Anush J.", "First time here. Came to the city to take an exam. I ordered the lamb souvlaki combination - it came with the souvlaki and gyro meat. The gyro was soft and flavorful without being greasy. The souvlaki was more chewy than I would have liked, but I enjoyed the overall taste. The fried jalape\u00f1o side was very good - with a bland sauce to cool the sour spicy jalape\u00f1os. The rice was good but had many uncooked grains in it."], ["AC C.", "This little gem of a restaurant is a big reason to miss Lincoln... Oh so delicious...We went for a Sunday brunch when I went back for a visit. The atmosphere of this restaurant is so perfect for catching up and eating great food. One friend ordered the Greek omelete and pancakes. That omelet was beautiful! Stuffed with feta and gyro meat and tsatziki. Looked so good. He said the potatoes were crispy and tasty as well. The pancakes were so light and fluffy...and was that a hint of lemon?!?! My best friend ordered lamb souvlaki which is always our favorite dish. Yummmmm. I ordered a rare lamb burger because I know they do a great job of grinding their own and the seasoning is always just right. OMG was it tasty...and huge! Probably a half pound of lamb! They have special side dishes for brunch, and on this day, they had a pumpernickel stuffing. I am still dreaming about that delicious dish. It was like pumpernickel bread pudding. Super crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside. Stuffed with onions and that bread was incredible. Had to be homemade bread. So good. It was a huge piece and I took it back to my family gathered at the hotel, and they thought it was so good that a group of about ten headed straight over to the Parthenon for lamb souvlaki, stuffing, and a tray of desserts. The only boo for the whole meal was the coffee...none of us liked it. Weak and flavorless, reminiscent of a bad diner. Did not fit with the rest of the experience! The service was really good and the owner truly cares about customer satisfaction and high quality dishes. Lucky Lincoln!!!"], ["Josep A.", "So. We've eaten here several times. A couple of weeks ago was our last. Im going to disagree with the notion that the place serves amazing food. Not a reflection of the owner that I understand is indeed a very nice gentleman. Nov 18, there was a live band we are fond of. We went already with the idea of not ordering anything, as our previous experiences had not been good. (Salad swimming in oil, not good tsatsiki, bland falafel, etc) We caved in and ordered a pizza. First attempt, soggy wet middle. Server returned it for a re-heating. Second attempt, pizza still soggy the further center you went. Server returned it and we got a new one. the new one's crust was doughy and raw. the center was soggy. We tried to eat it regardless, but could not. The server was very kind (can't remember her name... tall, blonde, very kind). The manager... different story. His pizza was raw, it was failed twice, rather than just comping it and apologizing he decided to argue with my wife about \"you ate most of it\" and other arguments defending his poor food. It was not just our pizza, a friend of ours ordered the same pizza and had to go through the same process as we did, reheat and all. The Manager decided to argue, and then said he'd go and talk to the owner... he never came back, figured we tire of waiting and pay... Server apologized, and let us go. She actually knows what she is doing, trying to get us the customer to have a good experience and come back, maybe because of her. \u00a0Manager, you don't argue with customers, we are not out to scam you out of a 10 dollar plate. The food is just not that good. The server was super kind, the owner is apparently a great guy, the manager is not. The food is not the best, its subpar food.As far as us eating here, not again. Sorry, but when I go out to eat, and pay for food, I expect it to be worth the money I'm paying, and this place sadly does not uphold that standard. Obviously we are the minority, so reader you might like this place, that's ok, we've personally experienced better greek food at Garbanzos."], ["Reed N.", "I had the Athenian salad and added gyro meat for a quick, filling business lunch. It is romaine lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers,green peppers, capers, feta cheese, black olives and is topped with anchovies.I forgot about the anchovies and was diving in pretty hard when I thought something was wrong with the gyro meat! LOL They put about 8 anchovies on top and I had about 4 in one bite. That will wake you up!Everything else on the salad is simple and good. It comes with a quartered pita. My only complaint was the dressing. There was too much of it. It would probably be best served on the side so you can control the amount."], ["Rudy S.", "best greek restaurant I have been to. \u00a0 service is always excellent. food is always above. excellent wine list. \u00a0 \u00a0specials are always excellent. choice and value. very reasonable cost \u00a0for what is offered. eat here usually once a week."], ["Wesley B.", "I can't say enough good stuff about this place.

I wish they had a 3.5 stars. That would be my rating. I don't think the food was quite as good as King Kong's overall, but, had a better atmosphere and service for a \"date night\". I would go back if in the area, but, I wouldn't make a special trip. Had the Gyro Platter. Meat was good. I ordered extra meat and couldn't really tell the difference from those who had the regular portion. I wasn't overly impressed with the Greek Potato. Sald as good. Their Tzaziki sauce was very good, probably the best I've had in Nebraska. Again, not bad, just didn't meet my expectations."], ["Danielle R.", "Decent Greek food and excellent service! The babaghanoush wasn't the best I've ever had but it was decent. The Greek salad that came with the meal was huge, enough to split with another person. It had great flavor, as well as the dressing, but they went a little heavy on the dressing. I'll know to ask for it on the side next time. We ordered the eggplant pita, which was \"lightly fried\". It was downright fried on a pita with lettuce and tomato. Nothing fantastic but still pretty good and I didn't have any leftovers. I'd go again, maybe branch out and try something different."], ["Mark J.", "The Real Deal Greek. \u00a0This place is great, and I love the souvlaki and gyro plates. \u00a0Perfectly prepaired and the \u00a0tzatziki sauce is homemade and tasty. \u00a0Oh and for an appetizer you have to get the flaming cheese. \u00a0It is so good but you can feel your heart clog as you eat it. \u00a0Worth it imo. \u00a0Drink and wine selection is decent, and the service was really good. \u00a0 The desert is the best thing about this place. \u00a0They have a case with like 20 different options and they all look amazing. \u00a0But we stuck with the Baklava and Chocolate Baklava. \u00a0YUMYUM"], ["Jim A.", "Absolutely outstanding.How refreshing to find real food prepared on site.The walleye and catfish were not only fresh, but perfectly prepared.The crab ravioli was spectacular.What a treat. \u00a0Will be back next trip over I-80."], ["Ashley K.", "Just moved to lincoln and this was the first place we stopped to eat.

I wasn't impressed the first time but I decided to give them a second chance since I love Greek food so much.I found their pita bread to be fairly tasteless. This is not bread I would eat by itself, like I do some others. I was unhappy that that the only choice of hummus had roasted red pepper. I am allergic to red pepper and hummus is one of my favorite foods and I couldn't have it.Instead of the hummas, I tried the roasted garlic and feta dip. I LOVE roasted garlic, but I did't like it at all. It was very bitter and hot. It tasted like they put a LOT of raw garlic in it and little, if no, roasted garlic.Every side dish they have is a carb. They have 2 side dishes of the day that might be vegetables. The first day they were both vegetables that I could not eat. They have a entree served with asparagus but they would not serve it to me as a side dish. The second time they had a stewed cabbage and carrot dish that was okay. It was over cooked and bland but at least it was vegetable I could eat. The Greek salad was pretty good. It had a lot of ingredients unlike a lot of restaurants. My only complaint is that there was too much dressing both times I ordered it.On the first night, I ordered the portabello chicken and it was cooked very well, I just thought the cheese overwhelmed the flavors. The second night I ordered the stuffed salmon. The \"stuffing\" is basically a crab cake on top of the salmon. The flavor was pretty good, but the salmon was cooked well done instead of medium or even medium well.As for the service, it seems to be hit or miss. The first night it was pretty busy and my service was good. The second night it was much slower and the service was pretty bad. The waiter came up to tell me to ask him if I had any questions. As I was starting to ask him a question, he turned and walked away. At the end of my meal I sat for 10 minutes waiting for my check. There were only 3 other tables filled at this time.I don't see how people are saying this is the best Greek food they have ever eaten. This may be the best Greek restaurant in Lincoln, but it isn't great Greek food."], ["Matt M.", "We were in Lincoln last week and I saw this place had great reviews. Needless to say we were not impressed. The service was very odd and the food was mediocre. A few of the appetizers (stuffed grape leaves & hummus) were ok but the entrees were lackluster.

It seemed, as one might expect on a Saturday, to be date night. With the exception of two large groups and then another table of three gays, everyone else was coupled off and leaning in closely to one another. \u00a0I didn't notice the it being loud, and even though this establishment is in a strip-mall the interior was \u00a0comfortable enough.The service was good. The hostess, wine guy, waiter were all very attentive. I did feel like they were pushing the wine menu a bit hard, though. Our waiter and the wine guy both suggested one of the \"specials,\" which I think were all in excess of forty dollars. \u00a0My buddy mention that it recently became legal for restaurants to re-cork bottles in Nebraska, so that probably why they were pushing it so hard. \u00a0It didn't really matter to me and if the waiter had maybe suggested a cocktail after I said I wasn't having wine, he could have probably made the sale that way. \u00a0 However, there was an advertisement on the table to a six course wine and food pairing, which priced at $50 seemed very reasonable to me. This sort of event is likely the only reason I would return, unless I had out-of-town guests that absolutely needed \u00a0Greek food on their trip to Nebraska.For dinner I had one of the \"Kazas Family Recipes\" which was named the Parthenon Pasta Platter. \u00a0It was just fine, nothing spectacular but solidly good: pasta on a bed of spinach with shrimp, artichoke and feta cheese. The Really Good feta cheese (and the bed of spinach) is probably what made the dish for me. \u00a0My side was pumpkin risotto, which I actually enjoyed more then my main course. \u00a0In retrospect, I should have just ordered appetisers for dinner, as those that i could see on other tables looked good. \u00a0After we were done eating, a man who I would have guessed was a manager or owner stopped by the table. He \u00a0cleared out dishes and asked how everything was, eyeballing my half eaten meal. \u00a0He looked genuinely concerned and I appreciated that, explaining \u00a0I can rarely finish a restaurant sized portion of anything. \u00a0In closing the meal, the waiter offered to split the ticket which was very nice because my friend and I were obviously not on a date. \u00a0 The hostess held the door open as we left the building. \u00a0However, I am still only rating this establishment a three, because it is a restaurant and the food would have needed to be more memorable for me to consider myself \"a fan.\""], ["Carrie B.", "WOW! \u00a0This place is great! \u00a0Probably the best Greek food I have ever had and definitely an unexpected find in Lincoln! \u00a0The gyros are definitely the best I have ever had. \u00a0We ordered a fried calamari appetizer and got a HUGE serving that was fried to perfection. \u00a0Although we barely had room for the combination plate for 2 that followed, we made room for the delicious combination of meats and sides. \u00a0The side dish made from orzo was tremendous, and I'd love to have the recipe! \u00a0The service was just as spectacular as the food, and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. \u00a0Very impressive place! \u00a0If you'd like to have a nice, sit-down meal in Lincoln and don't mind spending a little more money than the average meal, I would absolutely recommend the Parthenon."], ["Frans S.", "Very nice modern decor!

Many of them, including Sultan's Kite, are open after last call. Those other joints are ok, but the food and service I get at Sultan's Kite makes it vastly superior to anywhere else I've had falafel. Ever. In my life. They have a menu on the back wall, but since falafel is the only vegan option (besides my side of potatoes) that's all I care about. Even their lentil soup is somehow not appropriate for vegetarians, and that is clearly stated on the menu. There is no vegan sauce option, either. In any case, the falafel is the greatest. For real.So, normally a joint that really doesn't have a lot of variety for me won't get a 5 star review, but I'm going to cut the Sultan some slack because I always leave completely stuffed and can get my falafel 4 ways: wrap, pita, rice bowl, or salad. I always get a wrap, and the guys give me a nice smear of hummus as a substitute for the sauce. One could also ask them for a drizzle of olive oil and I'm sure they'd oblige. Lettuce, red onion, and tomato, and I'm set in terms of my wrap. But there's one more awesome thing I need: a side of real potato wedges! Don't eat them with your fingers because they use turmeric in the preparation of said wedges and you'll turn yellow. In conclusion, they're great for lunch, after last call, and any time you want falafel. Be prepared to be stuffed as the portions are generous. Get potatoes, use a fork. Superior to all falafel joints in the known universe and all of recorded history.

Open late, you can head in until 2am or so and still order off the menu. I am not a fan of lamb so I don't get gyros, but the burgers are the big draw for me. You get a choice of steak fries or freshly made crinkle cuts. Cheese sticks are delicious and so are the fried mushrooms. We have ordered onion rings but they were undercooked and not delicious so we stick to fries. Ali Baba has a large selection of items; almost too many! But there are some vegetarian options on the menu and they usually make everything fresh to order although some may be frozen. Overall, a good choice for downtown Lincoln any time of day. During the warm months, they have a great outside seating area where you can park your bike, sit, enjoy the weather and people watch."], ["Sina S.", "Gotta try this place!

One of the young men in my group is from inner-city Texas originally, and was dressed exactly like it. She began taking our orders by asking me where we were from and why people dressed like that in Iowa. She made several other derogatory remarks about him, and was generally rude to us the whole time, interrupting our prayer and then sitting right next to us to keep an eye on my young friend.Now to clarify, the teen I brought did eventually strike back, which I do NOT condone, and I have had many conversations with him about it. He went and got a water cup and filled it with lemonade, and didn't pay. I began to offer to pay, but before I could, the woman kicked our entire youth group out, and made a show of trying to humiliate the young man from our group.

They've upped the prices recently, but I think the food is still worth it. It does look a tad dive-y from the outside but don't let that bother you. I usually order the beef teka, shawarma, gyros, or beef kabob with rice, and usually have enough for leftovers. The garlic/yogurt sauce they give you is very tasty and although they only give you small portions of it, a little goes a long way. The free Iraqi tea is great. Next on the list to try is their lamb!"], ["Timothy S.", "My favorite place in Lincoln. Best garlic sauce ever! And the eggplant soup is killer."], ["Gabby A.", "Alright, Sinbads...you've won the five stars. \u00a0I love this place. \u00a0Within around a 6 month period you have recently become one of my favorite places here in Lincoln.I think what I love about this place is that they change things up, and the same dish will have different spices and blends to it every time I order it. \u00a0This may be off putting for some, but for me it's wonderful. \u00a0I love trying the meats and rice and being wowed with different tastes and sensations every single time. \u00a0The hummus is the best I've ever had, and the Iraqi bread served with it is excellent. \u00a0Go to Sinbad's....NOW."], ["Miss K.", "I would recommend giving this place a try if you like mild middle eastern food. The service was great, the food was good and fresh, the presentation was well , and the prices were right. \u00a0I ordered the chicken teka kabob plate which comes with soup, salad , rice and chicken breasts that are slowly charbroiled. \u00a0I also ordered pockets stuffed with meat and spices... and the garlic yogurt sauce is Soooo good for dipping. \u00a0 This is not a fancy place, but well worth trying. They take visa as well."], ["Foe M.", "Decent middle eastern food."], ["Wyn R.", "This place is pretty divey, but the food is solid and tasty. \u00a0They make these middle eastern eggroll type things that are FAB!!!! \u00a0And I could eat their hummus by the gallon. \u00a0I like the chicken tekka quite a bit. \u00a0And I love the fattoush! \u00a0But, the soups aren't very tasty at all. \u00a0And if you've got a Middle Eastern food jones in the summer, be sure to call in a take out order. \u00a0I'm not sure they run the AC, and it's hot as hell in there. \u00a0But during winter, it's just fine. \u00a0The staff always gives good service, and lavishes attention on my baby girl."], ["Braden J.", "I love this place. Every dish I have had has been delicious. I love the combo platters. You get a bunch of different types of their meat dishes, flafel, a heaping plate of wonderful rice, fresh salad, and a choice of one of many great soups. The service is top notch and super friendly. This place blows all other mediterranean places out of the water in Lincoln. Cheap and delicious!"], ["Joel G.", "Invited to sit down, given menus, and water. \u00a0The food arrived promptly but the portions didn't look like the photos. \u00a0I didn't like the styrofoam plate it came on. Don't think I'll be going back. \u00a0Prices didn't really justify the amount on the plates"], ["Cameron M.", "Awful! The chicken is dry, soup taste like shit, they even messed the rice up. How do u mess up rice? On top of that it smelled like i was inside a huge asshole."], ["Sarah A.", "I've visited many restaurants all over that US that offer Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food but I always end up coming back to Sinbad's. \u00a0I have been going there for years and it has yet to disappoint. \u00a0A sure bet every time, especially for a first timer, is the Small Combo which includes generous portions of chicken and beef teka, a perfectly seasoned beef kabob, and kubba. \u00a0And of course they include plenty of bread and rice. \u00a0I also always get their bean soup which pairs perfectly with the chicken teka, bread and rice. \u00a0Be sure to finish with the hot Iraqi tea (add lots of sugar). \u00a0I love this place!"], ["J C.", "Camerons makin stuff of. \u00a0They have decent food. \u00a0I occasionally get for take out. \u00a0Atmosphere is kinda \u00a0of iffy but food is decent. \u00a0Its not gourmet but have yet to find gourmet mediterranean/middle eastern food anywhere in the world. \u00a0 \u00a0Its a good joint, give it a try for take out, for sure."]]}
