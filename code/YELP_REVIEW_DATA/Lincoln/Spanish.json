{"Marks Bistro": [["Kyle K.", "I ate here the Friday evening after Thanksgiving. I haven't been here for dinner in a while but have enjoyed lunch at Mark's from time to time. Megan was our ace waitress and was very attentive to our table needs. Before I go any farther, I strongly recommend to make reservations in advance as the restaurant fills up quickly.Our party of 6 started with some appetizers: tots with a cheesy dipping sauce along with edamame with a Siracha aioli. Both were delicious. I crossed over and dared to dip the tots in the Siracha aioli. Even better!I ordered the Ramen dish for dinner. It came with local pork belly but you could also add chicken, salmon, shrimp or tofu on it. It was accompanied with a small salad. The ramen was made with fresh ingredients. It was very good and I would certainly get it again. The pork belly was good but I would try another protein next time just for a different flavor. Others in my group ordered steak tacos with kimchi, a vegetarian risotto dish and a bowl of shittake mushroom and onion soup. All were good.Overall, Mark's was very impressive with the food as well as the service. I will be back again soon!"], ["Koshya W.", "I don't think anything could stop me from going to Mark's, even the giant spider by the doorway couldn't get in my way. First off, I love Ramen. Traditional or trendy, I'm always craving it. So, when I found out that Mark's has a Ramen dish on the menu I had to try it. Who could pass pork belly and the perfect soft-boiled egg? Well, we started off with mac & cheese for the appetizer since it seems to be a hit, and I was definitely not disappointed. The breadcrumbs was a very nice addition and the dish was very cheesy and had a lot of smoky flavor. We then got our entr\u00e9es in which I of course ordered the Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the ravioli. The first thing I noticed was that my dish was a little cold, due to the fact that I didn't receive my Caesar salad until right before the dishes came out I assume. But, I'm not picky so I decided to look past that. I thought the Ramen dish had great flavor, piled with vegetables and perfectly cooked pork belly. I wish though that there would have been a little bit more soup, because the broth definitely made the dish for me. I was meaning to try a piece of my boyfriend's dish, but I was too indulged in the Ramen that I forgot to ask. Cozy atmosphere, a nice sweet spot with a hint of romance, perfect for date night. The windows make a nice addition to people watching as well. Service was very on point and our waiter was very attentive. I can always appreciate somebody who will refill my glass 5+ times in one sitting."], ["Elizabeth B.", "I have driven by Mark's at least 50 times, looked up the crowd of happy diners through slightly tinted glass lit with the understated decorative bulbs, and felt a need to be in on whatever was going on up there. In short, I felt left out lol! Well, finally I know why the place is always so packed with smiling diners. I told my husband if he didn't take me to Mark's, I would go with my boyfriend (which I do not have), so we went and had an extraordinary time. Oddly, the feel of Mark's is a bit hard to describe, as it is elegant dining but without the pretentiousness one might expect at any establishment with the word \"Bistro\" in its name. You are not going to show up in your cutoff shorts or sweats, but it is comfortable.We split the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad, and the Gluten Free Bread Spread Trio for our appetizers (yes, we ate like pigs, but we skipped lunch, so there). Both aps were prepared well by the kitchen staff and presented just as well by the serving staff, and I must say the Kalamata Tapenade stole the show this course. -Lobster and Bay Scallop Risotto and the Macaroni and Cheese were our main courses, and we were not shy about sampling from each other. I like the scallops a bit more thoroughly cooked, but both meals were absolutely delicious.We were piling up food to take home as it was, so we had no room for the desserts, but next time it's on!For me, this is not going to be a daily experience, just because the food is so rich, and a meal of this caliber deserves time to sit and enjoy- and I am generally on the go. Having said that, We are going to make Mark's a regular experience in our dining routine every 2-3 weeks for sure."], ["Eileen C.", "Fantastic dessert and service. Pretty good entrees and price point.What did fellow yelpers rave about? The Mac and cheese. Had to try it. While it was really filling, it didn't live up to the hype. I got the quack Mac (love the name) but left me wanting more than just Mac and cheese mixed with duck confit. Didn't give any unique flavors than other Mac and cheeses I've had. It was still good but if it's their claim to fame.. Eh.. Try another dish. My coworkers liked their dishes though- chicken enchilada and chicken lasagna.But the dessert. Yes. I got the smores brownie with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream. Marshmallow stuff overwhelmingly melted on top of a delicious moist chocolate brownie. And mixing it with the vanilla ice cream- superb. Also tried my coworker's bread pudding. Loved it. Huge portion too!Service was also great. Our waiter knew the menu well, was very friendly, and checked in on us frequently. Great dining experience here at Marks. (I still don't understand why there isn't an apostrophe)"], ["Will S.", "I had a lovely late lunch here last week. The wife and I hit that sweet spot between the lunch and dinner rush and practically had the place to ourselves. Our server -- polite, friendly and professional -- was excellent. As was our food: We shared a small house salad, charcuterie plate and the snack mac. It was plenty of food for two people.As many of you already know, Marks' house specialty is their macaroni and cheese. The snack mac is perfect size of their signature dish, in my opinion. It's enough to share and enjoy between two people, but not enough to binge on. This is good for me because, if left to my own devices, I would happily gluttonize a ginormous portion of this heavy dish, calorie count be damned.As for the charcuterie, well, it was excellent. Three types of cured meats, blue cheese, smoked almonds, pickled vegetables, tomato confit jam, whole-grain mustard and fig compote. A wonderful mix of flavors and textures. The surprise for me were the smoked almonds -- it made me realize that their smokey flavor is something I'd like to come across a lot more in the future.All in all, an excellent spot for a casual-yet-sophisticated meal in a restaurant that boasts one of the best atmosphere's in the city."], ["William A.", "This place was AWESOME! Atmosphere, service and food were all amazing. We had the snack size Mac and Cheese and the Bistro Tots for an appetizer. The Mac and Cheese was extremely cheesy and that's awesome cuz who doesn't love cheese. The tots are hash browns with creamy mashed potatoes as a center in the shape of a tot. \u00a0I ordered the Cubano sandwich which was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Lots of turkey, capicola ham and bacon. The ciabatta bun was perfect. Even had horseradish pickles which were a nice touch. Fianc\u00e9 ordered spinach and ricotta ravioli which she loved. Friend ordered the bistro burger with a fried egg and he ate it super fast so I'm guessing it was awesome. All in all it was a great experience. Will definitely be back again."], ["Karina C.", "Great restaurant! Original food including Ramen, pork belly, and Mac and cheese; their special. Nice outdoor seating. Service is very nice and the decoration is beautiful. Overall really good restaurant. Good for families and dates."], ["Kevin Q.", "I was very pleased with Marks Bistro. I came here with my coworkers during our last week in Omaha. Marks Bistro came highly recommended by some locals. We came during prime dinner hours, and the place was pretty full. The starter bread was really good. I normally don't write about starter bread, but this bread was worth writing about. I got the quack mac after seeing good reviews about it on Yelp. I was glad I did. For all the mac and cheese I had in Omaha the past few weeks, this one was definitely the best. I wouldn't have thought that mac and cheese would go well with duck, but I was proven wrong. It worked really well! My other corworker also really liked the enchiladas. For dessert I got the whiskey bread pudding with ice cream, which was absolutely amazing. The portions were massive! It should definitely be shared. This was one of the best places I went to during my time in Omaha."], ["Christine F.", "Salmon Caesar salad is amazing!! Super cute little place. I've had the same server both times and she was nice and attentive, gave us the specials and took our order right away. The outside patio is the best little spot when the weather is nice. So hidden and sweet, highly recommend!!!"], ["Natalie E.", "I've heard all my foodie friends heralding praises for Marks for years and I finally got the chance to check it out for myself. I wanted to love this place but overall it fell short of my expectations. The decor left a lot to be desired. I love the story of the 105 year old house, but they really could do more with the interior. It looked dated, like they painted it themselves in the 90s. Like bad sponge paint. Aging purple bar stools. Our waitress really didn't know the menu super well, and had to check with the kitchen a few times and look at her notes. I appreciated that she wanted to get us the right answer, but it would have been a better overall experience had she been speaking from personal knowledge. Also she was slow with refilling beverages. The grub was ok, but didn't start out on the best note. For an app we ordered the bruschetta. It was very oily. The bread was toasted but just dripped oil. I could only eat one price...and at $9 I was disappointed. The small salads were nice before our entree, fresh veggies and the Caesar had plenty of asiago cheese on it which made the salad. The 48 hour short ribs were good. Again, after the waitress hyped them up I expected them to be great. But I just didn't think they were as tender as they could have been. The flavor was fine, not over seasoned. All in all, the experience was decent. Nothing that really stood out to me as amazing, which really bummed me out. I probably won't be back...I have an extremely long list of eateries to experience, and like any serious yelper, I'm looking for excellence."], ["Matthew O.", "Came in for brunch, really excited to give Mark's a try -- I've heard some good things. 4 stars on Yelp certainly adds to the motivation as well.Great atmosphere here. 2nd story dining room with a wall of windows to sit next to with views overlooking Dundee.Service was fast, efficient and informative. Kudos to our waiter, for sure.I ordered the seafood risotto. Bay scallops and shrimp in a tomato/saffron broth.Seafood, fortunately, was fresh, but I felt the shrimp was a touch overdone. Rubbery and a bit chewy. Good flavor, though.And the risotto was unevenly cooked. Some was a touch hard while other bites were overcooked and clumpy. Broth was very, very tasty, especially when it was soaked up with some buttered baguette.I also ordered the brussels sprouts and was pleased with the preparation. I like mine a touch more on the crispy side, but the veggies were soft and tender with a bit of a crunch to the center -- tangy and acidic with a great balance of salt.Hate to do 3 stars -- 3.5 is more like it -- but I can't quite go with 4.I would definitely try it again, though."], ["Big B.", "It breaks my heart to rate Marks this poor, but the truth must be told, only if to 'fix whats broken'. I have had some wonderful dining experiences at this place in the last few few years. I have taken a girl to this place, who thought it was so classy, that she insisted we drink wine.Anyhoo..was back with my wife and ordered the Ramen and the Mac and Cheese. The Ramen was flavorless; the chicken in it was great-the problem being their were 3 pieces of chicken..each being about 1x2 cm. So we asked for the Salmon sandwich (2/5/5 stars). The aforementioned Mac n cheese was nowhere near the masterpiece these guys had created. In fact the mac was so very average, that we couldn't even finish it.As usual the service was excellent and the venue was great.I think I'll switch back to Darios."], ["Steve S.", "Overall Marks Bistro was really good. It had a very nice ambience with good service. I had the chicken enchiladas (it's a special). They came out surprisingly neat for enchiladas. I posted a picture of them previously. My coworkers had the quackmac (great name). They didn't have any complaints about it with the exception that they regretted not getting any of marks accompaniments. I would go back here again. Not to mention it was half priced wine night on Monday night. The wine list is laid out well based on the body of the wine."], ["Bill S.", "This is my second visit in less than a week. \u00a0First one, I had the whisky flank steak. \u00a0 Tender, beautifully seasoned medium rare souvide over Brussels sprout, and light moist apple donuts with house made caramel. \u00a0This time, the proccuto wrapped port tenderloin, \u00a0over sweet potatoes with caramelized cashews. \u00a0Again excellent flavored, moist and tender. \u00a0 I'm following it with the whisky bread pudding and more caramel sauce. \u00a0(Can you tell I like caramel?)Excellent wine and spirit selection and a casually upscale decor, with views overlook I n downtown Dundee, and an outdoor patio for more temperate weather. \u00a0I have 10 days more in town, and in all probability, \u00a0I'll be back again!"], ["Scott H.", "I've been here three times in the last two months. If you are up for a calm lunch outside, this is the place to go. The portions are just right for lunch, even if the prices seem a bit high. The wait staff is always kind and attentive. The food is good and consistent. They have a good wine selection."], ["Jordan S.", "One of our favorite places to eat in Omaha! The atmosphere is perfect for date night or even a girls night. The outside patio is beautiful in the spring, summer and fall and they even provide guests with blankets when the weather gets a little chilly. The food is amazing. The mac and cheese is a classic and is perfect paired with a glass of wine for girls night. Their steak salad is also amazing. I honestly haven't had a bad meal! I love to go late at night and order the french onion soup! Craving it now. Overall a great Omaha restaurant!"], ["Taylor S.", "Met my wife and her coworker here the other night. \u00a0Really pleasant experience. \u00a0Sat on the patio which is surrounded by flowers and plants. \u00a0Love that nice outdoor feeling. \u00a0Had a beer but it looks like their wine selection is a lot better. \u00a0I only ordered a couple appetizers but I was very pleased. \u00a0Cup of corn chowder, truffle fries, and tots. \u00a0The chowder was so fresh and delicious. \u00a0And the tots were some of the best I have ever had. \u00a0Rich and creamy on the inside along with a gouda dipping sauce. \u00a0I look forward to going back for a proper meal. \u00a0As far as a drink and a bite this place is what your looking for!!"], ["Chunk G.", "There are only a few foods I cannot live without. Mac-n-cheese is one of them. So when I ran across an article listing the best mac-n-cheese in Omaha and Mark's topped the list, I knew I had to try it. First though, you should know, I eat a LOOOOOOT of mac. So, yes, I'm picky about it! Ok, this might have been my first error: I went during happy hour. Yeah, I know, but this is why I'm telling you, lol! But I don't think this should matter because even though it was HH, the place was EMPTY so quality shouldn't have suffered. I ordered the mac and the pork tacos. Both were decent. But... well... that's all. The mac is too dry and the tacos are too bland. This is NOT the best mac in town. Zinn (also on the list) is better (without the chicken). You know what else is better? *whispers* The create-your-own mac in the UNMC caf on Fridays. \u00a0Shocking, I know. The best mac I've found in the city so far though is at Wilson & Washburn- and I had that at HH, too, so fair comparison.Otherwise, Mark's was great- the staff, my drinks, and the atmosphere (though empty) were all fine and I'll definitely return to try a real meal."], ["Mary M.", "I have been going to Mark's since they opened in 2003 and have gone through the ups and downs of different chefs with them. \u00a0I am very happy to say that they are back to their 2003 level of quality food. \u00a0I have been here 3 times in the last 6 months and have been extremely happy with my food experiences. \u00a0I was just there last night and had the Citrus Chicken. \u00a0It came out looking delicious and did not disappoint. \u00a0It was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and had a delicate citrus flavor. \u00a0Our table also ordered the Bistro Tots, which were crispy on the outside and deliciously creamy on the inside, and the Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip which was equally as good.And you can't beat the location...the all glass south side of the restaurant, on the second level above what was the Dundee Gallery, overlooks Dundee. \u00a0And the patio tucked in behind the entrance with all their potted plants and greenery is one of the best in the city. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because while I have always had great and timely service at Mark's, last night the service suffered a bit. \u00a0It was slow, and the waiter was not well educated on the wines offered."], ["Lindsey W.", "LOVE this place! Very professional/impressive and delicious. The waitress was phenomenal and the prices were according to the service."], ["Weston W.", "Marks Bistro has some chefs who can integrate flavors well into multiple dishes! This place accommodated my family of five and a two year old without a reservation made in less than 30 minutes. Smoked chicken lasagna was the favorite dish at our table, simply exquisite!"], ["Laura H.", "Went to dinner tonight and indulged in some good eats. We like this place for its upscale but relaxed atmosphere that overlooks the heart of the Dundee area (tonight people were boarding the \"Omaha fiesta\" party bus and starting out their night). We dove right into the wine list, selecting Maggio Cabernet Sauvignon-- a smoky fruity full bodied wine that had an interesting finish that reminded me of fresh pastries. Next came the house charcuterie platter which offered a typical array of cheese and aged meats...but the tomato jam stole the show. For mains we chose the falafel sliders (small potions but major flavor - pickled veggies and chipotle mayo) and the citrus chicken---by far THE best chicken I have ever had. Period. The waiter informed us that it had spent 2 days in a citrus brine, cooked sous vide and then pan seared to finish before it landed on our plate atop fingerling potatoes, grilled cherry tomatoes and olives....mmmmm soooo good. Then on to dessert. Couldn't pick just one (oops) so went with both the whiskey bread pudding and the s'mores brownie. Both were great. Only complaint is the marshmallow topping on the brownie needed more caramelization or texture...the boyfriend completely disagreed and literally licked the plate. Waste not want not. Will be returning again soon."], ["Laurel R.", "Holy cow this place is great. \u00a0Great food, fresh seasonal creative filling reasonably priced. \u00a0Excellent service, Joel at the bar was stellar tonight. \u00a0Love it."], ["Mark C.", "Tried Mark's Bistro for the first time today during lunch. \u00a0Mark's shares the building with Dundee Gallery on the first floor and Mark's from the 2nd floor up. \u00a0Got a good looking patio to sit at as the weather improves - tempted to try that today, but ended up inside.Main dining area has the bar that seats about 12~ and approximately 18 tables of various sizes. \u00a0We were able to sit at the huge window overlooking Underwood Avenue. \u00a0There is another small dining area with 4 tables and the upstairs has two more rooms that groups can use.Nice wine selection to chose from. \u00a0A little bit of everything.Our waitress (Erin) was very helpful and attentive. \u00a0Explained the daily specials and gave her personal recommendations. \u00a0She also kept our drinks full without having to be asked and constantly checked in on us to make sure everything was goodStarted with:Bread Spread Trio - Sun-dried tomato pesto, herb-feta cheese, olive tapenade, roasted garlic bulb with aged balsamic and olive oil \u00a0on the plate with warm pita bread triangles for dipping/spreading. \u00a0This comes in a small and large size. \u00a0We go the small and it was more than enough for two people. \u00a0- Overall very tasty, well worth getting as a good starter.Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts with bacon lardons, honey, mustard aioli, torn croutons - yeah, these are tasty. \u00a0Very good flavor. \u00a0I would have liked them roasted just a tad bit more, but still very good.Main Course:Spring Vegetable Pasta with gluten-free spaghetti, roasted baby carrots, red bell pepper, quinoa, kale, citrus-thyme vinaigrette, marinated artichoke hearts - Wife enjoyed it and would get it again.Pad Thai - Rice noodles, shredded vegetables, peanuts, choice of chicken breast or tofu or shrimp (for extra). \u00a0I had it with shrimp. \u00a0Good flavor, slightly spicy, just about right. \u00a0Tasty.Both portions was decent sized and prices were reasonable.Leftovers were brought out in biodegradable containers made out of corn product (Very commendable). \u00a0We were reminded not to try and microwave them or the container itself would melt.Oh, and Mark's does a number of gluten free and vegetarian dishes for those who so choose.One word of advice, if there aren't many people there, watch you table conversation volume. \u00a0Even with music playing lightly in the background, sound travels pretty well, it's always interesting to be able to listen (whether you want to or not) to the couple two tables away talking about a variety of things.Definitely a place we will hit again. \u00a0Patio looks like a great spot to hang out with friends or have a nice outdoor lunch/dinner when it is a bit warmer."], ["Kamie M.", "The Smoked Chicken Lasagna was amazing!! We were all very happy with our menu choices and will definitely go back again! Dundee is always a fun area, especially when the weather is nice!"], ["David D.", "First time here to this Omaha landmark. \u00a0Extremely disappointed. \u00a0I REALLY want to like Mark's, but my first experience has me questioning if I give it a second shot. \u00a0Took my two girls to Mark's because it was beautiful outside and I have heard wonderful things about their patio (which btw--is just great).However, this was the only thumbs up event. \u00a0The service was just horrible, I mean horrible! \u00a0Everything took forever. \u00a0Sat down for well over 15 min before we even where greeted by the \"server\". \u00a0My girls ordered a soda and I ordered a cocktail. \u00a0Girls received their sodas quickly but my \"one\" cocktail took forever to come. \u00a0We had to ask for bread service (twice). \u00a0After it arrived, we had to ask for plates (twice). \u00a0Waiter finally showed up again to take order. \u00a045 min later ENTREES FINALLY show up. \u00a0My steak came out absolutely ice cold and raw. \u00a0Really, it was so rare, there was no way it could have been hot as it was a raw piece of meat. \u00a0Of course, took forever for waiter to come and check on us. \u00a0He said he would get right on it. \u00a025 min later another steak shows up and it was just warm. \u00a0By this time both of my girls have finished their dinner, was not going to go through this again. \u00a0I don't know what the issue was that evening because they were not \"that\" busy. \u00a0Maybe I got stuck with a new waiter and a new kitchen staff or something, I don't know. \u00a0I will probably try again because I love the Dundee area and I really like Mark's outside patio. \u00a0However, if I experience this again, great patio or not, they will not see me again. \u00a0Please get your act together guys!"], ["Elisabeth E.", "This is a really cute little place in Omaha with an adorable little backdoor garden entrance, a nice dining room with huge windows viewing the street, and an intimate feel. I imagine this would be a great restaurant for a quiet date. My friend and I were in the area and did a scan on yelp for gluten free. This place came up and it appeared they were well acquainted with this dietary need. They have a symbol on their menu that denotes what items are (or can be made) gluten free. My friend and I enjoyed the cheese platter (they brought me out rice crackers!) for an appetizer and we each had the special, a truffle Gouda burger, I had mine wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. I enjoyed a side of their potatoes and was too full to try dessert... and they had creme brulee too :( well there is always next time! The food was all very good and I was happy to see the selection, and the willingness to accommodate for my gluten sensitivity. Service was pretty good and food came out in a timely manner.

All I have to say....what is the big deal about this place?... Mac and Cheese was not good. Great ambiance, but food was just... OK. It wasn't bad but it's not a place I crave after leaving. The spinach artichoke dip was delicious, but not enough dipping bread for the amount of dip they bring to you. Everything we had was something we wouldn't have again.

The salmon was excellent 2. The steak tacos was equally as delicious 3. Overall service was prompt and good 4. They serve healthier options at a lower price.

None of the waiters/waitresses came to refill my water glass even though they filled the water glasses of other people around me and I was in the restaurant for over an hour. 2. The bread came out cold - and who wants to eat cold bread? So I sent it back to be reheated. In their defense the waitress did reheat it without complaint. But the mere fact that I had to ask for it hot - Ugh. 3. Neither the beet salad or the Mac and Cheese was good. The beet was way to hard and although the goat cheese was fresh, the beet killed the taste. The Mac and Cheese wasn't gooey and cheesy as I like it. I would go back and recommend others to try them as well. Only be careful if you go during the lunch rush as you might have to wait for a table and service.

(in Jan of 2014) another group gathering decided to pick Marks, made the reservation, and requested and was granted separate checks...****and it was more of the same from the first review... disappointing. \u00a0I was really annoyed this time because as each guest arrived (maybe 13-14 in total) The waitress made a big deal of telling each person that we had to patient with her, and that we were not allowed to change seats or it was not her fault if our orders were wrong.. so we all rolled our eyes, dropped our jaws and stared at her in disbelief that she was being such a jerk... we were split across the room at two separate tables, but we were not allowed to move and actually enjoy each other's company and visit. \u00a0That set the mood for the rest of the night, we quietly ordered, everyone but my dish was correct...(yeah so maybe it's karma cause I'm vocal with criticism, maybe)I told her explicitly no onions or cucumbers, and of course it came with them.. so I nicely and quietly sent it back, which she then suggested I hadn't told her that... so I mentioned that I saw her write it on the ticket. \u00a0She then flipped through her tickets to verify I was being honest... silently took my plate away, brought me the correct meal.. never saying anything to me. My conclusion.... she likes dealing with groups, as much as groups enjoy the experience when they go to Marks, I will go there again, but never in a group. \u00a0It's just not what they are good at, and should stop putting their staff and customers through the experience."], ["Diana D.", "This is my ultimate go-to restaurant in Omaha.

We called late Friday afternoon to see if we could reserve a table, only to find out they didn't accept reservations. \u00a0However, they let us know they were pretty dead at the time, so if we were planning on an earlier dinner we would have no problem. We show up at the adorable restaurant on the second floor exactly at 6:30 and are seated right away. \u00a0The place seemed about three quarters full with mostly couples and a few groups. I was pretty surprised at how BIG the menu was, definitely something for everyone. We started with the Spinach-Artichoke dip, which was so-so. \u00a0Unfortunately I felt like this was mayo based...sad day! Not a fan of mayo based anything--but especially Spin Dip. \u00a0Where's the love (aka cheese)?My father got a burger--he had been here before and remembered loving it and he still did. Cooked perfectly plus some crispy fries! My mother got the seafood risotto. \u00a0I am a risotto fanatic, so I stole a few bites. YUM! Love the tomato bouillabaisse. Scallops were tiny, but good. \u00a0I was just getting over a cold, so I was pretty lame and just got a side salad with a bowl of the French Onion. VERY GREAT SOUP! Soup is my thing--if I could only have one thing for the rest of my life, it would be soup. And this was excellent. Its all about the Gruyere. \u00a0We were tempted on dessert, but decided to hit up eCreamery down the block instead. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0No complaints what so ever. \u00a0I will definitely be back--and SOON!

All were amazing dishes, they put quality into every ingredient, so fresh. They have great menu choices, lot of nice creative choices to choose from. You can tell this is an authentic homemade restaurant who does not cut corners. I really appreciate the effort they put forth. I would definitely go back again, one of my new spots when I come to Omaha for sure"], ["X T.", "This place has a great menu and some good specials. I tried the butternut squash which was pretty good, the spinach artichoke dip which was very and good, but by far the most delicious was the pad Thai and the bruschetta. The green tea was good and so was their dirty martini. Their patio is one of the nicest in Omaha and has a great atmosphere."], ["Kristine F.", "Absolutely amazing! Great outdoor seating as well. The food was so fresh and felt like they had just picked the ingredients from the garden. Amazing flavored in each dish. HIGHLY recommend all of their desserts especially the smore brownie. Best brownie ice ever had! I would definitely come back to this place"], ["Andrea T.", "Such a quaint restaurant with an authentic, neighborhood feel. You can eat outside in the back garden, in the main indoor dining room, or in one of several smaller private dining rooms. The menu is quite diverse. The macaroni & cheese looked delicious, but I opted for the smoked chicken lasagne, which was very tasty and just the right portion. Vegetarians will find a good selection here as well. Our service was just fair, but perhaps our server was having an off-day."], ["Aren R.", "I love Marks. Overlooks Underwood Ave. Quiet, classy environment. The tomato bruschetta is very fresh. The feta cheese spread mixed with the tomatoes created a nice mix of sweet, salty, and bitter. It is a great starter. The Mac n Cheese is great. I've had it a bunch and it always hits the spot. It has a nice crunch and a wonderful creaminess. Only problem were the chef's embellishments... So I've often heard (from food critics/restaurant experts) that specials on a menu often mean \"We are trying to sell this before it goes bad.\" I'm fairly certain that the special for the night (a salmon dish) and the chef's embellishments (smoked salmon) both fell into this category... Weird that they would have two salmon \"specials\" on top of the regular salmon entree they offer, right? The smoked salmon tasted alright, but wasn't anything special, so I'm skeptical... My fault for ordering it, though. Still, don't keep this review from getting you down to Marks! It's a wonderful Dundee restaurant. Not too expensive. Not quite so good as Dario's a level below, but it is a solid restaurant."], ["Megan P.", "My fiance and I ate at Marks for the first time last night. We arrived around 6 p.m. and were seated promptly. I enjoyed the atmosphere -- quiet and unassuming. We dined by the large windows overlooking Underwood Avenue, which was an added bonus.The drinks: I ordered Zipline Brewing Co.'s Copper Alt (Lincoln, Neb.); it's always a nice touch when restaurants serve local/regional beer on tap. My fiance wanted a rye whiskey, but unfortunately, they were out of the two or three options he wanted (which were all listed in their drink menu). The grub: We ordered the Chef's Choice rustic flatbread as an appetizer, and it was, hands down, the best thing we ate. The steak and cheeses were paired perfectly and the additions of basil and Sriracha aioli were stellar. The half order was a perfect start (both in size and flavor) to the meal. For the main course, we shared the signature Macaroni & Cheese with the chef's embellishments, which were beef tenderloin and green beans, and the Bistro Fries. I felt a little skimped on the embellishments -- very little beef tenderloin, too many green beans. The mac was OK, but overrated in my opinion. I've simply had better for cheaper. I feel the same way about the Bistro Fries, though the rosemary-truffle aioli saved the dish from total disappointment. For dessert, we ordered the Apple Crisp. The homemade ice cream was a nice touch, but the proportion of crisp to ice cream was off. The apples were nice and tart, and the crisp had a nice crunch. Disappointments aside, we'll be back to explore more of the menu. Admittedly, our order was influenced by the multitude of tips here and on Foursquare to try the Mac & Cheese. It just seems that Marks has a lot more to offer."], ["Lucinda W.", "Delicious food. Lovely atmosphere. Friendly service. We loved the Sonoma salad and the cheese plate. Brussels sprouts were excellent. I appreciate the smaller portions, big appetites might have to order multiple dishes."], ["Allison B.", "My husband and I both ordered the special which was a New York Strip with Gorgonzola butter on top. The cut of meat was awful, extremely chewy, not much flavor, and I got so tired of working so hard to cut through it that I stopped eating it half way and just gave up. For the price of the meal we expected much better quality. The food also was very slow to arrive, and it took a while for the waitress to get us another round of drinks while we waited for our entrees. We will NOT be going back, I wish I would have ordered the Mac and cheese as it seems to have good reviews."], ["E J.", "I had lunch here with friends recently. \u00a0We sat at an outside patio and it was beautiful as the weather was perfect. \u00a0For appetizers we had the spinach artichoke dip and it was okay...nothing memorable but the bread spread was good. \u00a0I got the swordfish tacos and they were very salty, not much sauce and the soft taco was too doughy. \u00a0I would never order them again. \u00a0I might try this restaurant again if the outside patio is open, but I would not go here just for the food."], ["Holly D.", "I'm pretty good at picking out places to eat on Yelp. My boyfriend and I were in town for the evening and, being foodies, were trying to narrow down the great selection of restaurants that Omaha has to offer. We eventually settled on Marks, which had a lot of vegetarian options (for me) and a decent wine list. We got there around 8 on a Friday night and both the patio and dining area were pretty full. Without a reservation, we were seated almost immediately, which was nice. One of the hesitations about going to Marks was the number of reviews that commented on the speed of the service (which was on the slower side), and the reviews turned out to be right. We got our drinks first (ordered an appetizer at the same time) and got a basket of bread after finishing our appetizer--this was 30 minutes into our meal. I normally wouldn't have minded, but I was at the \"too hungry to not notice\" point and tried my best to be patient. However, this is not the fault of the wait staff--they are spectacular. Marks is just a busy place and the kitchen appears to be very small, so they do their very best. Moving on.For the appetizer, we ordered the bruschetta (I was drawn in by the garlic confit) and that was very tasty, though the tomatoes could have been drained, since it was pretty messy to eat.For dinner, I ordered a crock of the French Onion Soup (not sure how big the cup size is, but the crock was pretty small for $1.50 more) and a half order of Molly's Favorite flatbread. My boyfriend got the macaroni and cheese with the chef's embellishments (chicken and sun-dried tomatoes). Our food arrived around 9, and aside from a small problem that led to one of the dishes being sent back, we were happily fed and on our way by 10:15. The dinner was long, yes, but the food was good enough to get me to come back if I'm in the area. The French onion soup was delicious, with the perfect ratio of melty cheese, caramelized onions, and two pieces of French bread. The flatbread was a very interesting combo--cilantro, avocado, shallots, goat cheese, and mole sauce. The mole was pretty spicy, but I like spicy so it was all good. The small problem that I discovered was a fly in my soup, which was quickly taken care of without a fuss. The macaroni and cheese was surprisingly light and very flavorful. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente and the embellishments look like they change regularly, so would definitely recommend getting those. We were wavering back and forth on whether to get dessert (since by this point it was past 10pm), but decided on the whiskey bread pudding after learning that it was our waitress' favorite. To put it lightly, it was divine. Two layers of soft, whiskey-soaked sweet bread with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and warm, thick caramel sauce. I was stuffed before dessert, but there were no regrets here. They ended up comping the soup and our dessert because we were really nice about the issue and patient with the service, which goes to show that you don't get anywhere by complaining about things.TL;DR: Marks is great, the food is tasty, the wait staff is very attentive despite the size of the kitchen and the amount of people they're serving, and I would definitely come back."], ["Shaunita J.", "Went here for lunch at the suggestion of a \u00a0colleague.First off, the street around it is under construction and parking on the street in front of it is redonk. \u00a0There weren't any lines and people were just haphazardly parking in front of the houses lining the street?If you can get past that, then the place itself seems decent. \u00a0There were two of us and we didn't have a long wait. \u00a0We went on a weekday around noon and many of the patrons seemed kind of older--like the Golden Girls kind of older--so, it felt a little uncool, but at least they were quiet. \u00a0It appears to have some lovely outdoor seating, but we were doing a business lunch, so we ate inside. \u00a0The host was friendly. \u00a0The server was pretty attentive--regularly refilling our glasses and coming back to check on us. \u00a0They have lunch specials that run in the $10-12 range. \u00a0My lunch mate had the salmon burger, which seemed a little messy. \u00a0Chunks of it were falling out \u00a0while he was eating and he ending up just eating the bun and using a fork to eat the rest. \u00a0Seemed to enjoy it. \u00a0I had the quiche of the day. \u00a0It was a little too fresh--the eggs seemed runny to me. \u00a0I don't know that I'd order that again. \u00a0Or, I'd send it back and have them cook it more (maybe I have an unrefined palate and enjoy overcooked food--I also tend to like \"well done\" meat).This \u00a0go round with the food was just so-so, but perhaps I'll try it again."], ["Eli G.", "That was a god-damn good half of chicken with perfectly pan seared gnocchi;yelp.com/biz_photos/jjOP\u2026If you need a break from scotch at the Dell, then this is the spot."], ["Chase I.", "The food rivals the much more expensive eateries in Omaha.

I had just recently relocated to Omaha so wasn't familiar with the area but with yelp reviews we decided to go to Marks. We arrived separately at about 7:00 without reservations but were quickly seated. The waitress was attentive but not intrusive with a few suggestions. We started off with the small cheese plate which had a decent selection. My friend had the Pan Roasted Pork Loin and thought it was delicious and perfectly cooked. She thought the portion was maybe a little too big but she still finished it all. I had the mussels and they were okay. They were pretty small and the \"baguette\" was a thin slice of toasted french bread so that was disappointed. I would have preferred some pomme frites but didn't think of it until I was done. The dining room is a little cramped and noisy so probably not the best for a romantic date but was perfectly fine for us.

The unique location of the second floor patio is unexpected from the Underwood Street below. It's a nice surprise and very inviting when you reach the top of the stairs.We dined on a Tuesday night in late July. A nice surprise was 1/2 priced wine on bottles below $50. We enjoyed a 2010 Newton Claret. I couldn't resist trying their signature Mac & Cheese. It was baked to perfection, topped with a nice Panko crust and bubbling with four cheese goodness.

Almond crusted sole; French onion soup, and two specials back to back were Meatloaf with blue cheese (last evening) and crab cakes (tonight were all \u00a0outstanding.

It was alright, but the lamb lacked flavor and the greens could have been fresher. Our drinks weren't awful, but my \"martini\" had way too much orange juice and tasted more like a screwdriver.

The hummus plate was a nice appetizer to start with. \u00a0My wife ordered the pork carnitas tacos and felt ill after eating one of them. \u00a0My 48 hour short ribs were tough and chewy and had little flavor. When one orders a dish like this, one expects the meat to fall apart and be very flavorful. \u00a0These were hard to cut through and very chewy. \u00a0The recommended wine was also not very good. \u00a0Overall, a somewhat expensive and very disappointing evening."], ["Sarah G.", "Update: \u00a0I finally tried something at Mark's that I did not enjoy and had to send back. \u00a0Ordered the Curried Paneer Cheese & Spinach on Basmati Rice. \u00a0Nothing in the dish was as flavorful as I'd hoped... the rice, the cheese, and I don't even remember seeing the spinach or chutney. \u00a0So after only one bite I had to exchange it for the always-delish Shaved Strip Loin Sandwich.I still love the restaurant, but that was more than a little disappointing since it sounded like an excellent dish. \u00a0Therefore Mark's has taken up residence with the Upstream in the category of 'places I love to eat, but I'm afraid to order their specials or deviate from my 'typical' menu items' which include the aforementioned Shaved Strip Loin Sandwich, Smoked Chicken Lasagna, Macaroni & Cheese or Pad Thai Pasta. \u00a0I haven't been disappointed by any salads, soups or desserts either, so those are safe to indulge on as well."], ["Marc D.", "This place is great, \u00a0Wonderful and I love when they do the enchilada's"], ["Jenn B.", "One of my favorite restaurants in Omaha!

Hidden upstairs above an art shop, Mark's is easily passed while driving west on Underwood right before 50th.Chose to visit Mark's for my last birthday celebration with a group of friends. I had been there before and liked the food a lot, and thought that might be a good way to get my friends to try it (and hopefully like it) as much as I do. When entering the small and cozy restaurant, it splits into two sides. We were seated on the immediate right and dominated that half of the dining area with 13 people. I was disappointed that they could not find a way for us all to sit together at the same table which I feel on this visit detracted from my overall experience. Had this not been my birthday or had I not brought 13 people, I would probably be whistling a different tune. However, this review stands on the issue of larger parties so I press on.The food was timely, and tasty. Most of my guys friends on a budget got sandwiches (yes, at dinner time!) which only set them back $10-13. Not too shabby for a nice establishment like that! I had the salmon, which was cooked well and of good quality. We celebrated with a few bottles of wine, and pretty soon the whole restaurant was buzzing with the low talk of small parties and the smell of delicious food. I think everyone left full and happy.

Parking is a bit of a hassle but not impossible in the neighborhood. Great service. Attentive and personable but not intrusive at all. I really enjoyed my warm spinach salad with fried egg and pine nuts. (I love fried eggs. Yet another thing that makes me homesick...) Their fried egg was \"over easy\" and perfect on a generous bed of spinach. I loved it best with shrimps. It probably would have been nice with salmon too. It's definitely a busy little place on Friday but it's still quiet enough for good conversations! This seems like a popular place for couples on a date, but it's not overpopulated by couples to the extent that single folks and small groups of friends would not want to visit. I'll definitely come back!"], ["Katina T.", "Ah, Mark's. I don't even know where to start. This is EASILY my favorite restaurant in Omaha. For starters, the atmosphere is so welcoming and the place has undeniable charm. The restaurant is located on the upper level of an adorable art gallery in Dundee. The south side of the building is entirely made of windows which overlook Underwood Ave. When the weather permits, Mark's also offers fantastic outdoor seating. I love to sit on the patio in the evening and just take it all in. On top of that, the food is also quite tasty. In fact, the Chicken Lasagna is outstanding. I'm typically more of a traditional lasagna fan, but Mark's puts most to shame. From time to time, they feature an Asiago Crab Dip on their appetizer menu. If this is on the menu, you would be making a mistake not to order it (barring any shellfish allergies, I suppose.) It's the perfect starter and is served hot with toasted baguettes. The dip is encase by the most delicious, cheesy crust. Gah, SO GOOD! Honestly, I've never had a meal I didn't love at Mark's. The most lack-luster is probably their signature Mac and Cheese, which is still pretty darn good, especially when you hit the jackpot with the \"embellishments.\" Anyway, what really takes the cake for me is that the service here is always outstanding. The servers are super charismatic and obviously love their jobs. I'm also always very impressed with the lengths the manager, Joel, goes to make sure every customer leaves happy.

Next time the waiter came by, I asked him if he thought it was medium rare and he said no--that it was more like medium. I actually think it was almost medium well. He offered to take it back and get me a new one, but since I wasn't paying for it, I didn't really care and I didn't want to wait for it.I was kinda hoping he'd at least give me a discount or offer a free glass of wine but he didn't.

Sweet potato fries should be cheaper to make than the au gratin potatoes--why would they charge extra???I came here because Sarah G. said it was her favorite place to eat in Omaha; maybe it was just an off night for these guys, but of the ~10 places I've eaten at in Omaha, Marks is towards the bottom of my list."], ["Katie F.", "Love Marks.

It was sweet and creamy - kinda melts in your mouth. I didn't care for the snails. I had better. I ate a bit of the paella at the restaurant and it was good. I took most of it home and ate the rest the next day. Second day paella was amazing....maybe due to it sitting there marinating. My server was friendly and attentive. The downside is the price.

Again... the three of us couldn't finish them off. Tapas are small plates, but the plates at Espana are very generous and so very tasty!!!!I loved the decor, the art on the walls and the interesting and perfectly volumed music.

Parking is either street parking or a communal lot on the south side of maple-free for 2 hours which should be enough time to get in and out of Espana. I made my reservations on open table and we were seated without delay on a Friday evening. The waitress was helpful, but seemed a little new. No problem she was able to answer all my questions with a little help from her colleagues. We ordered 4 dishes and sangria for us both- that seemed to be enough food to be satisfied but not stuffed. I've made the mistake in the past of over ordering here and wasting food. For Omaha, this place has some good options for eating 'tapas' style. When I first tried it here it was a novel thing for me and I thought this was the best, but after living and dining on the east coast and in NYC/Philly, this time Espana left more to be wanted. I still believe this is a solid tapas restaurant here in Omaha and we are lucky to have tapas period here so I'm not complaining, I just feel I have experienced some better stuff in recent years out of town. The sangria is always yummy and the food practically flies to your table. I will say for the idea that it's tapas and you are to linger and eat, I did feel kinda rushed to leave although the restaurant was nowhere near full. My favorite thing of what we ordered was the chicken sandwiches (Ruben style) with cheese and aioli. I've forgotten the proper name. Anyway I am sure ill be back, it's a fun place to eat dinner and then hit the bars down the block."], ["Clare C.", "Went here on Saturday with a friend of mine for the first time. The red sangria was delicious (beware, you'll wake up with a wicked hangover if you have too many glasses) but the white was far too sweet. I would highly suggest coming here with four people, rather than two because your tab will easily run you $50/person if you order three plates each. Plus, you wanna save some $$ before heading out to Beercade or another Benson staple. \u00a0 The menu is setup wonderfully and makes the tapas choosing process less overwhelming. To add a little protein to the dinner, my friend and I both got the chicken kabobs & these went well with a tomato dish. I also ordered beef tenderloin with capers and lettuce... OMG it was delicious, but I wanted to eat it as a salad! The wait staff was great. The ambiance was nice. Definitely get a reservation and be prepared to spend some money... Or swipe right on tinder and make your future husband take you here."], ["Natalie E.", "The 2 star rating is for the very hit and miss aspects of our dining experience. \u00a0The service was disappointing right off the bat. Our server came over, asked if we'd been to espa\u00f1a before, then said she'd be back. She didn't explain about marking your selections on the sheet with the oil pencil so we were thrown off a bit. About 10 minutes later, another server came to the table behind us and gave an amazing welcome and presentation of the menu. She gave her recommendations, told them what was new and chatted them up about the restaurant and its history. We were pretty jealous we didn't get that experience. Our server was slow and despite having a small dining room with only a few tables to attend to, she wasn't attentive or that helpful. My husband made reservations for us, and since I've been asking him to be a bit more romantic lately he called ahead and requested a somewhat secluded table and was told there would be a warmly lit candle on it. When we arrived, unbeknownst to me, he checked with the host who took the call and I'm not sure what happened but they just put us at any old table. Had I not known about my husband's attempt to plan something special it wouldn't have been a problem, but since he went to the trouble of trying to arrange something, and the restaurant promised but did not deliver, that's another big disappointment. The braised pork was yummy. It could have been just a hair more tender but it had a deep richly stewed flavor. Soft potatoes were a nice accompaniment and the peas lent their delicate sweetness to the dish. The Valencia orange salad was spot on. Very lightly dressed but still bursting with bright orange flavor. The toasted marcona almonds provided a great crunch and a bit of rich nuttiness. Though I am a little sad that the salad we ordered as an afterthought was the star of the meal. The paella was a big disappointment. The best part of a paella is the crunchy crust at the bottom of the pan. This was a rice pilaf, not a true paella. It lacked seasoning, and even with the fresh lemon it was lackluster. Not worth the $46 for two of us. All in all it definitely wasn't the worst dining experience I've had, but certainly not worth the drive to benson. :("], ["Suzy W.", "I visited on Valentine's Day, and I was happy that we could order off the regular menu as well as the special V day menu.

My husband thought it was bland and overpriced for the portion. Because it was my birthday, I received a free tres leche, a lemon pund cake soaked in three milks with strawberries.

While our original reservation was made over voicemail successfully, they didn't get the memo about the online reservation (even though I got a confirmation).Regardless, they were able to accommodate although in a similar fashion to my Lot 2 experience we had to promise and not linger too long since they had other later reservations. Is this a conspiracy by Benson restaurants? No matter, the pace of our meal was perfect because of the freakish speed the food started to arrive. And we even had time for espresso afterwards. As for the food... my, my, my. How could I have given Espana less than 5 stars before? Maybe the fact that I had a Groupon helped soften the blow when the bill came?

Everything else was fantastic. And the live Spanish guitar put a really nice touch on top of it all. (Who cares that at times I couldn't hear the people across the table? I was too busy stuffing my face with escargot, empanadas, cerviche, hummus, cheeses, proscuitto wrapped asparagus and the like).Our next visit will undoubtedly be during one of their many deals...

We were surprised at how few people were there on a Thursday night, and then later I remember making the comment that it's a good thing they aren't open for lunch because I'd be completely broke.First of all, the mojitos and margaritas are fantastic. I had a mojito with house-infused raspberry rum, and it was fantastic. Next time I'll be trying the blueberry, as that was my first choice but our server swayed me to the raspberry instead. The margarita was also fantastic; the fresh orange, lemon, and lime juice really bowled me over...or maybe that was the tequila?!We ordered the following: Queso Manchego Flambeado, Montadito de Solomillo con Salsa Allioli Picante, Vieras salteadas con salsa Romesco, and Ceviche. The queso was superb; lemony and creamy and perfect with the bread accoutrements. We also loved the Montadito dish, which was sirloin steak on baguette with garlic butter, cheese, green onion, and aioli. It was perfectly beefy, buttery, oniony, and garlicky all at the same time. The ceviche was great, despite the fact that I am not a big fan of capers. Apparently I like them in ceviche, because they paired really well between the red peppers and mix of seafood. The fried plantains provided great crunch and I found myself wanting more after the dish was gone. Finally, the Vieras dish was a combination of scallops, Serrano ham, and Romesco sauce. I am a huge fan of all three ingredients, so I was stoked to see them combined. The dish was pretty tasty, but it fell flat for me. I think it would have been better off with some sort of vegetable thrown in, but I'm not sure what that could be.

All were delicious little gourmet \u00a0treats, and by the end of the meal I was surprisingly full.Luckily, I didn't have to pick up the tab (this time), because the bill must have been in the $150-range (including our drinks). One of the more expensive meals I've eaten in a long time, this is a special-occasion restaurant, certainly not a place to go for a quick bite before a concert or movie, unless you intend to eat again later.Service was quite good.

Each tapas was priced between 7.50 and 11.00 so it will add up.

Considering what I've read about the use of antibiotics in farm raised seafood I wasn't going to chance it.We stared off with drinks. Mom had some iced tea and I had the sangria. I would say the first one was better than the second. The second round seemed a little watered down. I don't know if my palate was altered due to stuffing my face with all the yumminess the stacked dishes offered, or if they were running low on product and decided to cut it with a bit of water? After all, we were told the infusion process for their sangria took ten days, or something like that... Honestly, that's the only reason I wanted to try it.

Truth be told, once you are seated and your server starts helping you, the service here is as good as any place, although the bartenders can be flaky and Lindsay in particular can be a little uncouth at times. The food here is pretty good on balance, but can vary significantly from visit to visit. Most dishes are quality, but on busier nights it can become apparent that the kitchen is getting rushed. Certain dishes that have always been good include the Gambas al Ajillo and the Empanadillas de Queso. If you're a Sangria drinker, you need to visit this place, even if you forgo the tapas. Both the red and white variants are top notch. Order the large pitcher... if you can't finish it all, they'll bottle it up for you and send you home happy with it.The atmosphere varies from quiet and peaceful during the off-hours to loud and crowded on busy nights. Several times through the week, there will be performers of one variant or another, including Spanish guitarists, Flamenco shows or even live bands. The clientele seems to include a healthy mix of scene kids, yuppies and middle-aged retirees. Truth be told, there have been several nights that Espana Omaha is NOT a four star review...

You have 100 waiters can't you monitor from a distance when the table will have room for another extremely hot plate, geez, ugg then again I might not return, anywayz to the tapas..we ordered a total of 7 tapas which wasn't so bad I could have probably settled for 4 but I always over do it when ordering anywayz, here are the things we had and my opinion as well as my partners..1st gazpacho, a little too citrusy too me, but my partner loved it, 2nd pinchos de pollo, basically grilled chicken on a stick, those were good, came with some type of white tangy sauce, didn't like it, 3rd ceviche too citrusy for me...partner thought it was ok 4th Hojas de Vi\u00f1a Rellenas basically rice wrapped up in leaves with a cucumber yogurt sauce, didnt like it 5th tortilla a la espanola my favorite of the night, a log shapped potato meal, was very good had carmalized onions, very good 6th empanadas de pollo, I've had better empanadas the pastry was a little dry, the meat was moist and number 7 gambas al ajillo basically sizzling shrimp, shrimp were pretty large and had a good flavor, overall, wasnt too impressed, but hey I may be back thought I said earlier I may not, lol....o did I state there as live music and while waiting in line the owner attempted to tell a joke, but what was nice, was when we were leaving the owner greeted us, he greeted almost everyone, so that was very nice...."], ["Rosalina R.", "Finally went for a non-reverse HH (which I hear is no longer in existence) and as I suspected the tapas were delish and decently priced...a large group of us ordered about 11 dishes and a couple pitchers of sangria and walked out of there paying about 30.00 each (tip included)...what a deal!!

The rice has a great flavor & is mixed with spices & peas & olives. The chicken is always fall of the bone tender. It's served with plantains on the side. Oh. My. God. Best plantains I've ever had. They're sweet & tender & melt in your mouth. Delicious. Highly recommend it! Every meal on their menu is amazing, but this one tops them all. I would definitely recommend getting a mojito with it.

Really similar to the Cuban restaurants we've eaten at in Miami when it comes to decor.With all that said, our experience was great. Our server was lovely, our mojitos were perfect, and the food was delish. The arroz con pollo specifically was amazing- and could have been shared between two people with leftovers beyond that. It's obviously a very family-oriented place- a young girl seated us and I am guessing she was the owner's daughter. I read the response from the owner to one of his negative reviews and I definitely don't agree with that kind of customer service reponse- he is just asking for trouble with that kind of attitude.

First of all, I will have to make a disclaimer about this place that doesn't bother me, but I know will bother other peeps. The service is not the greatest... nice people, but very slow, very forgetful, can't really take special requests, open hours are sometimes optional and the place is really cold in the winter because I think they save money by putting the heat down... \u00a0So why would I ever give it five stars?? Well my foodie friends, I LOVE the food here. Like remember the in the movie American Pie when Jason Biggs enjoys the apple pie a little too much? I'm the same way with the Cuban sandwiches here. TMI? Perhaps... Awesome food? HECK YEAH!My virgin Cuban mouth was inappropriately yet invitingly pillaged by the ultimate appetizer platter. I'm talking about the platter of all platters! The large wooden alter this thing comes out on is large enough to perform pagan rituals on medium sized animals. With four people, it would be an entire meal alone. I'm just warning everyone before you get this and think about getting another meal! Anyway, the plates comes with the following and sometimes changes: \u00a0 - Fried plantains (soft and sweet) \u00a0 - Croquettes \u00a0 - Some kind of ground fried fish??? \u00a0 - Double fried plantains in mojo sauce (crispy and not sweet)  \u00a0 - Shoe string potato \u00a0 - Chick peas in some unknown but yummy sauce \u00a0 - Shredded beef \u00a0 - Fried yucca rootI'm sure I'm forgetting things, but as I said, it is the king of the universe platter!! If you do not like or am not in the mood for fried food, don't get this. It's heavy, fried, and your cholesterol increases exponentially. But isn't that why we go out and binge eat?But Dennis, what about their entrees.... Let me tell you about some entrees folks. The number one thing that I order is the Cuban Sandwich.... I mean... this is staple Cuban food and a MUST for a first timer!! It's shredded pork, ham, swiss cheese, and mustard in a hot pressed hoagie... Can we say NOM^3?!?!?! Oh and the sandwich comes with fries or plantain chips... I will remind you that you are in a Cuban restaurant and you can get fries anywhere so please just get the god damn side of plantain chips!! Onto the main meals... the rice and especially the black beans are heavenly. Like... those commies really know how to make some beans!! I have a friend who lives in KC but born and raised in Cuba come visit Omaha. We went to this place because he hasn't had Cuban food in a while and he thought for a moment he was back home in a restaurant. He had the skirt steak and said it was cooked and spiced perfectly!! My favorite is the pork morsel dish. I'm talking little pig nuggets cooked in mojo (garlic, oil, lime) sauce and it makes me squeal for joy like a little piggy!!!And finally the desserts.... I'm picky about tres leches and I will always think it tastes better when you make it at home, but they do a pretty good job in soaking that cake in white sticky sweetness engulfed in caramel and whipped cream. Again... your heart might stop, but it's all in the name of good food.In conclusion (why are my reviews so long?!!?) AWESOME place.

The food is really good, but you need to be prepared to be very, very patient. As others have mentioned, they seemed to be as understaffed as they were busy. Our experience this time was not pleasant..To be fair, I believe it was the last day for a groupon.Even though they had the little ones delivering water we were dry a couple times - and it was hot! It was a hot day, and I don't think they turned on the air conditioner until they were ready to open. I stewed in my own sweat so long that when my food finally arrived, the last thing I wanted was a hot meal. We spent some of our time trying to help entertain little ones across the aisle, and I actually got up to find some water for them at one point. Once we left it was actually refreshing to step out the front door - those on the patio had the good seats - and it was in the upper 90's.Even with the heat and delay, I would not be adverse to eating here again if I could avoid the groupon start and ending periods :)."], ["Craig H.", "Great food, kind host.

Patience was definitely wearing thin.The cuban sandwich also was thinner, the bread was not as crunchy yet soft...it was literally so solid it cut my S.O.'s mouth.While I give them kudos for picking up on the \"being closed while posted hours say they are open,\" they must have tried to compensate for that by draining on the quality of food."], ["Diana C.", "I LOVE Gusto Cuban Cafe!!! I ordered the Ropa Vieja, Avocado Salad, and Cuban Pechuga?....EVERYTHING was amazing! The Avocado Salad was pretty addicting if you enjoy a vinegar taste like I do.

We were from out of town, and it was our first time. Ambiance was fine, not too fancy nor too dive-y. Appropriate for kids also.I ordered Vaca Frita, which was the Chef's Choice. Very delicious! Love the combination of onion and shredded beef. The side dish I got was congris (yellow rice) and a bowl of brown beans with a heap full of fried sweet plaintains, which was too much in my opinion. We also ordered two different chicken dish, I think the Arroz Con Pollo (yellow rice with chicken and herbs) and Pollo Caribeno. The Arroz Con Pollo was also delicious, kind of paella-ish. Found some chunks of green olives in the rice, which was startling (not used to eat warm olives).Lechon Caribeno (roasted pork in mojo sauce with garlic and onion) was satisfying too. Now if only they would cut down on the number of fried sweet plaintains, and give us more rice; then it'd be awesome.Service was good, although our server forgot that I ordered Mojito and my daughter's lemonade. They came pretty quickly after we almost finish our complimentary garlic bread.Will definitely come back if we're ever in Omaha again."], ["Randall S.", "Good Cuban food! \u00a0Polite staff, quick service, delicious food.

Perhaps a cpl more might have convinced me to ignore the sweat streaming down my back and I would have stuck around to try their tres leches. \u00a0No deal.

I asked the waitress and she said it was fine. When we finally ordered, we asked the waitress for a lot of input since we hadn't had Cuban food much. She suggested the red beans and helped me pick an entree. We waited probably 45 minutes for the food, and when it came out, almost the entire meal was wrong. She brought black beans when we had both ordered red (because she told us to!), and my entree was completely wrong. We could not figure out how on Earth it was so messed up because it was still not very busy in the restaurant and she had told us what to order. She seemed to be just as surprised as we were that it was all wrong. She exchanged the beans for us, but I ended up eating the entree she brought because they would have had to cook a whole new meal, and we were tired of waiting. When the bill came, I gave her the coupon. A few minutes later, she came back and said that we couldn't use it.

Stacks of meat on sweet Cuban bread with thin cut fresh fries. Would definitely recommend their sandwiches. Tried the espresso but was not on par with coffee I usually have in Cuban restaurants.

The bartender was our server for the night and he was a gem! I didn't catch his name, but he is the big guy with a sleeve. He was upfront with us when we mentioned maybe doing a flight letting us know it wasn't worth it. \u00a0I ordered his recommended Pinot Noir while my friend asked him to pick for her--she ended up with a shiraz that she loved and has no doubt bought a bottle or two since. Their pours here are very healthy (read: one glass actually lasted me all dinner)!We both ordered off the ORW menu...going for:Appetizers:-Charcuterie Plate: delicious assortment of cheeses. Hard to mess up anywhere-Hummus Plate: amazing! Two kinds of hummus and baba ghanoush. One hummus was chipotle and one with a hint of mint. \u00a0The stand out was by far the baba ghanoush which neither of us had before.Main:-Apple Chutney Sirloin: cooked perfectly and I am told the Apple Chutney was bomb.com. Our waiter actually suggested this one for the apple chutney specifically.-Chicken Arabiatta: holy heavens was this a good dish. The arabiatta sauce was amazingly flavorful and the polenta was perfectly creamy. Dessert:We both caved and got the Chocolate Cheesecake S'more...it was dang good and thankfully perfectly portioned. I hate getting a huge slice of cheesecake that you have to eat because it is so good but then feel sick. The best thing about these plates? Most of them are on their regular menu! \u00a0The menu does seem a bit pricey, but I think it would be worth it. It also looked like they have great Happy Hour specials! So with a fabulous meal, a good glass of wine and great service this place is definitely worth a stop at. \u00a0I look forward to coming back to try out the regular menu next time I am downtown."], ["Siba K.", "Disappointing to say at least! When in Omaha, go for a grass fed locally grown beef, right!? And with these great reviews why not Nash!? Well I've never had worse filet in my life-and I eat out a lot.

Winning! - Reservations: They take them, not much else to say here. - Friendly staff: It's always great when the service team works together to make sure the guests are happy. Its definitely a team effort here. -Spinach and artichoke dip: super creamy and delicious. \u00a0It's topped with crispy prosciutto, but I just asked them to put it on \u00a0the side (Vegetarian) so my meat eating table could still enjoy it. -Truffle Mac n cheese: Tasty little bowl of pasta, heavy on the truffle and high in salt, but I ate every bite. My only complaint is that it was really the size of a side dish. Plenty for me but it would not be a meal for most.The table also ordered an array of sliders and flat bread. They raved about the truffle fries, but I didn't think they we're anything spectacular, and had the same reaction to the flatbread.

It's location is great because it is just blocks from the Century Link Center and the Old Market. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and cocktails. The spinach artichoke dip was delicious and the presentation was classy. Our cocktails were also good. The waitstaff however took a really long time to wait on us. In their defense it appeared there was a large birthday party going on in the back corner that was taking a lot of their time. I believe it took over 20 minutes to get our appetizer though so I can't imagine if we had ordered dinner how long it would have taken. The environment is upscale and classy. The dim lighting and unique seating sets a great atmosphere for date night, girls night or even a night out with friends.

We sank down into some deliciously comfy couches and purchased a half off bottle of wine (the special on Thursday evenings). The server was extremely attentive, but not annoyingly so. The food, chorizo nachos and a cheese plate, was fabulous. I get cheese plates all the time, and this was one of the best I've had... quite the smorgasbord of goodies.

The asparagus on top hit you with the flavor of strong vinegar and took your breath away. \u00a0The potato chunks were hard and not cooked long enough. Not sure how this place stays open. Our waitress spent more time at the hostess station talking with coworkers and never once asked how the food was or come over after it was delivered. \u00a0The folks without reservations walking in the door were treated like lepers. \u00a0Too many great places in this town to waste time here. \u00a0Hit the 801 or Sullivan's if you want s great meal and great service."], ["Lisa H.", "Great atmosphere. Perfect for a date. Started with two drinks. My house martini was served in a glass that needed polishing, lots of external water marks/swirls were made even more visible by the table candles (lit after drink served). Husbands Pinot was delicious and glass was perfect. :)Meat and cheese platter looked great but was underwhelming. Duck pate seemed an odd addition, something most wouldn't enjoy (we didn't). Or perhaps it could be served as just a taste instead of a primary meat? (Other meat was a few salami pieces and some prosciutto-type meat wrapping the pate). Did like the carrots, olives and pickled onion, Brie and blue were good. Perhaps the addition of a dried fruit or nuts would be considered to round out the plate? Part of the fun of a cheese and meat plate is the fun of tasting and trying different flavors and textures.

Sat at the empty bar since it was just myself. 6/7 tables scattered throughout the quaint place. Bartender was in no mood to converse. Ordered a glass of Cab ($9), only a few on the menu sold by the glass. Wanted to try the stuffed wings, but they were out. Ordered the salmon sliders ($14) the salmon was good, but the slider buns tasted old and tough. The thing that really bothered me was they rounded up the tax on my bill. Sub total was $23, tax was $2.23, but my bill was $25.25. Yes it's only $0.02, but still.

They have a vast selection of wines and the staff is really helpful and friendly. I love their four 2oz pours for 15$, it's a really fun way to do your own wine tasting. The reason I didn't give five stars is the food is pretty average, which is fine because its main focus is on the wine.

Mushroom risotto, a yummy Margareta flat bread and a lightly dressed refreshing green salad. Staff was very nice as well."], ["Christopher K.", "Nothing better than being hungry and in the mood for a light snack and then stumbling upon a place called \"Nosh.\" Well, that's pretty much what happened recently.After lubing up our livers over at The Berry & Rye several hours earlier, we decided we had had enough of the whole pretentious cocktail thing and headed outside. We had no destination in mind, other than to walk in the direction of the Hilton Omaha where we were staying. As I've been warned many times by my Omahan friends, the weather here can change very quickly. On this night, the weather would go from clear and 55, to below-freezing with blizzardy wind and snow -- all in the matter of a few drinks. Now outside, and inappropriately dressed for the weather, we ran into the night.When it became abundantly clear that we needed to take shelter or freeze to death, we ducked into the first place we saw -- Nosh. How perfect, given we were now not only cold and wet, but also very snacky. (And a little tipsy, of course.)It was 9:50pm, and there were only three other people in the bar when we arrived. Kitchen was starting to close up, but they were happy to oblige us by putting in our food order. While we waited for what would clearly be a fresh and expertly prepared set of small plates, my colleague enjoyed a nicely poured glass of red, while I doubled down with a Hazy Hadyen -- Basil Hayden bourbon, cinnamon simple syrup and sassafras served in a smoke filled glass. (AWESOME.)Food arrived about 30 minutes later, which seemed like a long time for duck tacos and a steak crostini, but after one bite we realized food this good takes time to prepare. Everything was absolutely delicious. Out of all the restaurants that I've tried in Omaha to date, I honestly think Nosh may be the best food I've eaten so far. (Or at least in a tie with the whiskey steak at the Drover.)We joked with the bartender about how uptight the staff at the Berry & Rye were, and all had a good laugh. The cocktails at Nosh tasted just as good as any I had at B&R, but without any of the attitude. And with Nosh in perfect stumbling distance of the Hilton Omaha, my home away from home, I can finally say I may have found my go-to place.Can't wait to go back."], ["Ryan C.", "Hi! My husband and I were in town visiting family and went to dine at your restaurant. We brought my mother in law, brother in law and his wife, and another couple who are close friends. I have to say, I was blown away! Not only is the restaurant a hidden gem in the city, inside the ambiance was perfect. We came in Fourth of July weekend. The bartender immediately sat us and took his time explaining the wine menu and making suggestions which was great since we had never been there before and had a lot of questions. I personally have worked in restaurants as a server all the way up to management for the last 15 years, so I appreciated the time he took to tend to the group and not once did he seem put out or annoyed! After he had taken care of our drinks and put in our apps, another server came over to finish our table. She was extremely helpful, to me especially- she recommended this phenomenal pear martini that was the bast one I've ever had. I don't remember her name, but she was pregnant if that helps! For apps we had the mussels, flatbreads, steak crustinies?! (However that's spelled), and spinach dip. The portions were great, everything tasted delicious! Then William, the chef, came out and chatted with our table and actually he delivered the apps himself. He was so friendly and the food was to die for. We had ordered so much as appetizers that when I told him we all had decided to order more food the look on his face was priceless! Out came the sliders and salads and more steak crustinies- needless to say we basically had to be rolled out of there! I know that so often in the restaurant business you only hear about the bad, the not so good, etc. I just wanted to let you know that everything about our experience was perfect. Each person that we interacted with contributed to the amazing experience we had that day. A special thanks to the chef, William, who's food truly blew everyone away.

I seriously questioned whether or not I had a kindred spirit employee somewhere in the place, as the musical play-list was exclusively DMB for most of our dinner also... not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned, but that's the type of 'vibe' they were going for at the time.Duck Tacos were quite good - a nice start to the meal. I also ordered up a bowl of soup du joir - bacon beer cheese - and the steak sliders (saut\u00e9ed filet slices topped with caramelized onions, shiitake mushrooms and melted havarti garnished with whole grain mustard and spinach) to make up for a slider-related disappointment I'd had earlier in the day. Strangely, all of Nosh's dinner entrees were listed under a heading of 'Light Entrees' which was a little confusing but not deterring at all. Choice of salad (Nosh seasonal or \u00a0Apple/Walnut/Blue Cheese) or fries, as I recall. Two of us opted for the side salads (we all got sliders of one variety or another).For reasons unbeknownst to me, the soup didn't show up until the main course did... somewhat disappointing since by that time I also had salad and sliders to tackle. Mostly disappointing because the bacon was pureed into tiny bits which sank to the bottom of the bowl and contributed more salt than flavor to the beer cheese base. I would not order the soup again. Salad was also only an okay item even though everything was fresh, I had to ask for more dressing - which is something I never do - and was a little too heavy on the oil for my preference.

I went to NOSH last night, where our party of five turned into a party of two. This turned out to be a fortunate event. We were seated and immediately told that it would take 40 minutes to get our food. Despite the wait we ordered anyway. The waiter looked a bit disappointed. As if to discourage us from ordering. He later told us that they were full and ran out of plates. \u00a0o_O How does a restaurant run out of plates. I guess they ran out of wine glasses, too because they served my white wine in a red wine glass. I didn't expect this type of oversight, from a Wine Lounge named \"nosh\".My first \u00a0experience was not much better. \u00a0We sat at the bar and the bartender with the personality of an animatron served us. Oh, that was during reverse happy hour. He not only put in half of our food order, but was patronizing, and pretentious. Upon inquiring about the rest of our order he told us that the kitchen was closed. When we spoke to the manager, Lilah she apologized and got us some cheese and bread \"on the house\" that the bartender later charged us for. Both times service was atrocious. The sad part is that the ambiance of the establishment and the food (once and if it does arrive) is quite good. \u00a0However, if they don't educate there staff on service or increased inventory of plates and \u00a0glasses to meet at least 150% of max capacity \u00a0(to account for \u00a0wash rotation and breakage), it will not reach it's full potential.

Fair prices, great food, good selection of beer/wine and a grasp on social media and being open when they should be."], ["Eileen C.", "Great casual lunch/dinner place at average prices but pretty good food. Rustic but comfy ambiance. Seems like a good place to catch up with friends. You order at the cashier, pay, then sit and the food is brought to you.Per the cashier's recommendations (whole bird and the meatloaf she said were the most popular), got the whole bird sandwich ($8) and also tried to apps: everything bagel cheese balls ($6) and gougeres ($4).Whole bird sandwich was pretty hearty and tasty. Toasted and buttery bread with seared chicken that you actually taste the searedness mixed with confit leg salad - great sandwich. Got really messy towards the end as I didn't know how to keep such a filled sandwich intact. You also get popcorn with your sandwich and like another reviewer said, the popcorn is better than the sandwich haha. It was addicting for me as a popcorn lover.The cheese balls were decent- it comes with toast and it does taste like an everything bagel but nothing amazing. The gourgeres, to be honest, was nothing memorable. It was only okay.Service is great here though, the cashier was really nice and patient with our party as we didn't know what we wanted. She gave recommendations and answered all of our questions."], ["Jean-Baptiste B.", "I highly recommend this place! \u00a0They make their own breads for their sandwiches from scratch. \u00a0Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. \u00a0I came during happy hour, so I had 1/2 price on the deviled eggs and bagel cheese balls. \u00a0I also had their Kale salad, which was perfection."], ["Mary Ann S.", "Stopped in here for lunch , and the sandwich of the day is BLT House Bacon , Heirloom Tomatoes Greens and Aioli on grilled Levain! it was pretty good along with some egg plant soup i might add.

But my overall visit today went quite well the food was good the staff was nice ill for sure be coming back again real soon :)"], ["M D.", "Started with cheese puffs - sort of light fluffy popovers with gruyere cheese.

On Mondays they have curry night which I have yet to taste. Will post an updated review soon!"], ["Glenn P.", "Simple and excellent. The flavors are always bountiful and the amount of options to choose from are just right.

They have something for everyone whether you're a carnivore or vegan."], ["Lianna N.", "Very lovely decor {modern meets rustic minimalistic look}, open kitchen concept, ambiance, and trend awareness. I like the open, clean look of Kitchen Table and also thought that the staff was kind, helpful and I liked that I was greeted with smiles. Popcorn is healthier than potato chips, that scores in my book. Locally sourced food is another plus. I ordered the whole chicken sandwich that was highly recommended. A great sandwich, no doubt..slightly lacking to my taste. I was not a fan of the pickled greens inside, would have preferred arugula or something fresh like a spring garden mix. The chicken breast was moist and well seasoned (a bit of pesto flavor?) but the skin was not crispy and the egg was kinda \"meh\" to me. My total for the sandwich was $8.77 with tax.I think I will have to try KT again."], ["Dan L.", "I often find it hard to justify a 5 star rating and tend to only give those out to the higher end restaurants, but when a restaurant does what it is trying to do exceptionally well, they deserve the credit. Kitchen Table tries to provide a causal and rustic dining experience with top notch fresh food. From the d\u00e9cor to the hand made sodas to the delicious sandwiches and gourmet popcorn; Kitchen Table delivers. I'd have lunch here any time... Two thumbs upTry the whole bird sandwich."], ["Sara C.", "Got stuck in Omaha for a day due to canceled flight and decided to come here for brunch on Sunday. \u00a0It was raining, which I was told it is rare in the middle of summer. \u00a0The coffee was great, I got hot coffee because I want the refill-ability of it. \u00a0It was brunch and you can get everything a la carte but I decided to go all out because first of all, it's $15, and second, everything sounded so good!I love the decor, I love the service, I love the food.... everything was perfect. \u00a0It was more self serve initially, gotta grab a menu and order at the cash register. \u00a0I decided to go with the fruit, the brown rice cup, and the strata. The fruit had honey but it's only lightly sweetened, it was very delicious and refreshing! \u00a0The brown rice was very cute and clever being put in a camping ceramic coated mug. \u00a0The strata was amazing, I felt bad that I couldn't finish the strata but it was good cold as I took it back to the hotel and ate it as a snack later. Overall I was very impressed and that the atmosphere with the decor made it a really pleasant visit. \u00a0I don't intend to come back to Omaha, but if I did, this will be a place I come back to visit. \u00a0They cater to gluten-free and vegetarians too. \u00a0Job well done!"], ["Jonathan C.", "So I travel to Omaha a lot and I like finding some local flavor. I usually find some good stuff, however flying into Omaha generally means flying out of Omaha.... and there is nothing good to eat in the airport. So upon searching for places close to the airport (or close enough compared to 140th street where my office is near), I decided to give this a try.I went for the whole bird (chicken, chicken skin, and an egg) on a sandwich..... Solid sandwich. There was some nice salty skin that added complexity to the sandwich.I also got a small salad. I really liked the sprouted beans. I wish they supplied a fork in my take away order..... well next time I'll remember to ask for one."], ["Kristin M.", "A great quick service breakfast/brunch spot in Omaha. Their $15 3 course brunch is worth the money so long as you have the appetite. It's all pretty bread heavy, but I enjoy the melon first course with the cottage cheese second course--pretty light. The cottage cheese must be local or homemade, and it's drizzled with olive oil and topped with perfectly seasoned mini heirloom tomatoes. So tasty and hope to recreate this at home. The fried egg sandwich is on a focaccia-type bread, and it is relish heavy. If I got it again I would request it on a different kind of bread and no relish. However, it comes really nicely wrapped in brown paper and is just the right amount of food. Side note: the bacon is super yummy and should be added to everything you get :) A go-to brunch spot if you don't have a ton of time and are looking for delicious local fare."], ["Flagnagdes B.", "The curry noodle special served tonight ought to be on the menu.

I cannot, unfortunately, speak to any of their menu items as we had the venue rented out for a private event with a custom menu. However, I can say that everything we were served was delicious, and earned rave reviews from our guests. The owners were more than accommodating to our menu requests, and were even able to secure a custom spirit to be served with dinner as well. The environment is homey, but contemporary and simultaneously cozy and spacious. Also, they are a farm-to-table restaurant, so if keeping business local is your jam, that's an added bonus. If you're in the Old Market and don't mind spending an extra buck or two on delicious, fresh food, then look no further."], ["Kevin Q.", "I came here for lunch with a few of my coworkers. It came on on Yelp with a bunch of good reviews and was in downtown, so we decided to try it. The staff was extremely friendly, and took the time out to help my coworker, who is allergic to peanuts, pick out an appropriate option. I personally went with the whole bird and a homemade orange soda. My party of three got the gougeres and the everything bagel options to split on the side. The two snacks were pretty good, and were appropriately portioned for sharing. The orange soda was also surprisingly good, as it wasn't overly sweet and didn't taste cheap like a coke or pepsi product. The sandwich itself was perfect. It wasn't overly greasy and was filling. It also came with a generous side of popcorn, which wasn't overly buttery or salty. Overall, the meal was quite satisfying, and all three of us were happy. As a quick note, they serve the beers and sodas in those honey jars, which I thought was neat. This place is good for lunch, and I would highly recommend it."], ["Daniel T.", "I had a sandwich called The Whole Bird. \u00a0Grilled chicken breast, leg confit salad, crispy chicken skin, and a fried egg on homemade bread. I balanced it with a cup of vegan horseradish beet soup and washed it down with a homemade strawberry mint soda. \u00a0Soup was good, everything else was really good. \u00a0Everything was served with a handful of popcorn and a little piece of homemade pickled green pepper. \u00a0I'm guessing the actual pickle changes according to what's fresh and on hand. There was a line when I got there and I was still in and out in around 30 minutes. I would definitely go back!"], ["Brian M.", "You can save yourself the airfare to Portland by stepping in here.

It has a weird freshness to it. Their sandwiches are awesome. They feature specials that are worth trying. I have had cheese balls and gougeres fur starters and they were good. The grilled cheese sandwich and dog sliders have been my excellent choices in sandwiches.

The sandwiches were pretty good, nothing that exciting. I don't like the popcorn as the side at all.

I even met the owners Colin and Jessica at an Omaha Public Library culinary event in 2013, and it STILL took me a year to walk across the street from work for lunch. If anything, it was well worth the wait. I ordered the Cauliflower Jam sandwich ($7). Since it was bustling during lunch hour, it took a while for said sandwich to make it from order to my table; but expect this, as everything is made to order. The sandwich did not disappoint. The layers of flavors were mouth-tingling, and KT did not skimp on ingredients including cauliflower, pesto and mozzarella cheese. Sandwich was served with a complimentary helping of popcorn and pickled cauliflower (which was the topic of their library presentation, pickled condiments).There are only a handful of places like this in Omaha. Prices are reasonable, and I love supporting local vendors via small business. Self-serve water is a plus. Co-owner Jessica made the rounds several times, ensuring everybody was happy; I was happy. In fact, all staff I encountered were friendly. No TV: a big plus.Have your phone handy for photos: The space is stripped-down and very cool, very natural.I will not wait a year again before returning; I plan to return incredibly soon."], ["Yasmeen M.", "Just stopped here with some friends on a road trip to CO.

The only good part of the meal was the chicken since it was fresh and tender, but the rest of the meal was bland and lacking in appeal altogether. The crispy skin felt out of place and the confit leg salad had an odd taste and texture. Popcorn was served on the side but it was overly salted/peppered. Getting too nitpicky here but even the water had an off taste.The nice part of the place was the decor itself. It's a fun hipster lunch vibe-- I always give thumbs up for mason jars, but for us, that's all this place had going for it. We visited a local bar immediately after to grab a few beers to wash it all down..EDIT: Going to bump up my rating a little bit.

I love that they serve their sandwiches with a side of seasoned popcorn and my friend ordered the deviled eggs which were definitely different, but delicious. Also, the other reason for three stars instead of four is the price because there isn't a cup of soup option so to get a sandwich and soup gets to be pretty pricey for lunch.

It was made with pan seared cauliflower, fresh mozzarella cheese, and pepper jam among other things and I devoured it. I also love that they serve their sandwiches with a side of popcorn.In addition to our sandwiches Will and I shared these little bits of baked heaven that where kind of like biscuits that had cheese and herbs baked into the batter.

First time at the restaurant and second time I took it back to my hotel. Meal #1: I tried both the Whole Bird and Daily Special sandwiches. The Whole Bird was tasty. As I put on my \u00a0tip - it is handheld comfort food. Flavorful chicken sandwich on toasted bread with a piece of crispy chicken skin to boot. I took off the skin for health reasons ... ;)The daily special was a take on grilled cheese - Mozzarella cheese with fresh peach and basil. It was OK. \u00a0It tasted good, but the peaches could have been a little sweeter and IMO it should have had something else to tie the tastes together. Maybe a light sauce or a sweet/salty spice mix. Meal #2: \u00a0Meatloaf sandwich and another Whole Bird sandwich. I devoured the meatloaf sammie. It was excellent. Meatloaf with sauce and some lightly pickled carrots and celery. My only beef is that it was slightly over-grilled so a corner of the bread was hard and crunchy. I took the Whole Bird home and had it the next day. It wasn't quite as good the next day, but if I had eaten it hot, I'm sure it would have been as good as before. The seasoned popcorn is a nice touch.

But really this is the antithesis of both of those movements. Chicken with confit chicken cooked in chicken juices, served with crispy chicken skin and a chicken egg. But since I'm neither vegetarian nor vegan, I dug into this sandie with gusto.The bread was fantastic as well. (Good bread makes all the difference in the world!) Whoever cultivated this levain starter is my new hero. And while April's review mentioned too much butter... I apparently think no such thing exists. The popcorn I could take or leave. It's not that I don't like popcorn, but it's never something I crave... If its around, I'll eat it. But i generally prefer popcorn when its hiding M&M's.

I've been wanting to try Pitch for awhile now and I hear often of classmates frequenting the place. I actually saw one of my classmates leaving when I went in.But LET ME TELL YOU!Immediately when you walk in, the atmosphere hits you in the face and you realize you're in a really cool and hip spot. The lighting really helped with setting off the atmosphere! It's dark enough so you can be romantic and bring a date or lit enough for a night out with your friends. The restaurant is bigger than I thought it would be! It was well decorated and I liked that their coal fire ovens were open into the dining area. We went today while it was snowing and the temperature inside was perfect! Kind of weird to point out, but too often have I been inside a colder restaurant! We were promptly greeted and seated. Our server was actually very nice and definitely seemed to know what was on their menu.She was really good at making sure our water was constantly filled. She even helped suggest some of her favorite pizzas, which I actually would love to go back and try out. But because today my friends and I were hungry, we got 2 pizzas that seemed to have more toppings than some of the others: Basil Pesto Chicken Pie and the Doc. I did like the Basil Pesto Chicken Pie a lot, only thing I would suggest is to season their chicken and maybe they do, but a little more before putting it on their pizza! Besides that, pretty delicious pizza! The crust was PERFECT! Just the way I like it! Not too thick or thin, but had a nice crunch! The Doc, in my opinion had TOO many toppings. It was odd to me with the addition of celery in their peperonata and also I like asparagus but not sure about it on my pizza. I am not sure it quite worked in my opinion BUT their Fennel SAUSAGE is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I am a HUGE FAN of sausage and frankly, a huge fan of Pitch's sausage! I was informed that they made their sausage in house!I can't believe I almost forgot to mention their Truffle Fries! Can I say OH MY GOD, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!? I had to caps lock that in order to really emphasize how good they were! They were perfectly crisp and I couldn't imagine my life without them! I can even picture myself ordering 3 or 4 orders of it and being full off it it! Hey! Don't judge me! But really make sure you get it! I am salivating still thinking of them.Next time I already know what I will be ordering. One of the white sauce pizzas with sausage! Pitch is a solid restaurant! Great food and service! It may actually be my new favorite pizza place here in Omaha! I am excited to come back for more! Especially for those Truffle Fries and sausage!"], ["Kevin P.", "Extremely well crafted, fire oven pizzas. Toppings are extremely fresh and carefully placed.

From that perspective, I think Pitch makes good-not-great pies. I really enjoy it when I get fancier, more unusual combos (their fig and apple pizza is great), but I find their more basic options a bit pricey for pizza that (I think) is only \"pretty good.\" It's tasty, but when I eat it, I find myself questioning if it's worth the (frankly pretty high) price.That said, they have some delicious appetizers to round out a meal. Their Brussels's sprouts and the creamy white beans are both amazing, and would be a great complement to a meal, or a solid main course if coupled with a salad. In short, Pitch is a really good place that I think is just a few steps short of being great.

We decided to make a reservation solely based on the popularity of the place ( I would highly recommend a reservation). We were seated just a few minutes after our reservation time, which is to be expected of a busy place. Our waiter and his trainee were prompt with water and menus right after we were seated. The waiter was super knowledgable of the products and dishes they had. However, it took for what seemed like an eternity for them to come back to take our drink order. By the time they came back we had decided against the appetizer we were going to order and opted to just order drinks and our entrees. I had a burger which was incredible. You can add whatever you like to customize the burger to your liking. With the burger came fries that were luke-warm at best. For dessert I had the mascarpone cheesecake which was divine. The highlight of the entire meal was my red sangria. I think the alcohol made it less obvious that the service kept getting worse and worse as the night went on.

To top it off, there was a ball of ricotta cheese on that top splashed with truffle oil! I was obsessed. My friend got the MIA pizza which also looked delicious if you're a meat lover!

Pitch has stayed consistent in terms of food, service, atmosphere, and ambiance over the years. It has increased in popularity significantly, so while you could once come in during a rush hour and snag a table or a short wait, now the wait time will be much longer if you dont have reservations. Fri. Sat, Sun, you HAVE to have reservations or come on an off hour if you want to be seated immediately. Even the bar area fills up to standing room only during their busy nights. I recommend take out, which is something I have been doing a lot of recently. I find the food is not quite as good (fries a little soggy and not as hot, or pizza just not quite as perfect due to sweating in the box) BUT it will still fulfill that craving and you can eat it in the comfort of your own home. In sweatpants! I really like that the food is very very consistent here. I can count on almost every menu item to be prepared exactly how I remember it- and I have tried almost the whole menu at this point. My favorite chopped salad is now on the permanent menu and not just served at lunch which is a huge plus (and gripe in my previous review). I still love the truffle frites and the 2 peps pizza.

The food is probably what keeps Pitch in business, but the decor and the service take everything to the next level. The style is trendy urban meets rustic and truly elevates the dining experience. Wood and exposed brick mingle nicely with modern shelving and creatively styled wine bottles. The pizza is the best I've had since visiting Rome. Coal fired crust and the meltiest, stringiest cheese make the perfect canvas for some unique topping combinations. We ordered several pizzas in our group, and among the favorites were the pesto chicken with balsamic reduction and the Marsala (who knew figs belonged on a pizza?!). On occasion I drink beer and wine, but I'm a craft cocktail girl at heart. I was so pleased to find out that Pitch had a nice selection (about 10 or so) of creative cocktails to choose from.

Side note, you can't make reservations with a party under 4, so coming in as a walk-in is inevitable. Anyway, the three of us ordered a variety of food. My boyfriend built his own pizza (which is rather convenient), my friend ordered the Bianco Verde, and I got the coal-fired burger. Both the pizzas were delicious, and not being much of a cheese person, the mozzarella was really fresh and tasty. Though most people will rave about the pizza, I have to rant about how delicious my burger was. It was cooked medium, just how I wanted it, and was very juicy and tender and also came with a house aioli sauce. My side was the truffle fries, which is literally to die for. To top it all off, I got the red velvet cake for dessert and it was so good! It was spongey, moist, and doused in chocolate syrup. YUM. Overall great experience.

Since there weren't too many people standing around, we thought, \"Okay. Shouldn't be too long...\" \u00a0Right? \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0After about 45 minutes of waiting and watching a 2-top go unused, I asked my husband to ask the hostess how much longer the wait would be. \u00a0When he came back, he said, \"She said there are 6 other parties in front of us.\"SIX! \u00a0No one was seated from the time we arrived through the time we left...

Even with a reservation, we had to wait a bit for our table to be ready. Once seated, however, the table service here was exemplary. Drinks were brought out in short order and appetizers not long after, but there was a long wait for the pizza to arrive-- not really surprising considering how crowded the place was.I'm sure that the primary reason the place was so hectic on a Tuesday night was the \"pizza & bottle\" special they run on Monday and Tuesday evenings: choice of any of their specialty pizzas plus a bottle of house red or white wine or carafe of Sangria for $30 (optional upgrade to fancier wine for $10 or $20 more). An excellent deal considering that the cheapest bottle alone is $30 on the regular menu! We went with the Quattro pie (mozzarella, goat cheese, smoked cheddar, grana) and Sangria-- both were quite tasty. The pizza was small-ish (they only come in one size, apparently), but enough for sharing between two--especially since we also ordered appetizers. The roasted brussels sprouts were amazing; in fact I thought they were probably the most memorable part of the meal. Our party also ordered and shared \u00a0a large salad, olive plate, and bruschetta-- all good stuff!One complaint I had about dining here was the noise level: it was almost painfully loud in the dining room; at times I even found it difficult to hear the person next to me.

I've tried many of the pies but my favorite is the Shrooms. \u00a0At this point, I don't even bother getting anything else, because in my mind, nothing lives up to the taste of the shrooms. \u00a0They have entrees and burgers too but I stick to pizza, salad and appetizers.

They place the hot pizza up on tin cans which is a bit dangerous if you have kids. 2.) The macaroni and cheese is probably the worst in all the world- but, again, we don't go there for that. The price is high here, but you do get what you pay for."], ["Justin T.", "Pitch is an ideal place for family and friends. Customer service \u00a0was a make to my personality.

Flatbread was overwhelmed with arugula.. Where was the flat bread??? Truffle fries were average.. Not bad but not great. Needed more of the truffle flavor. Brussel sprouts and meatballs were average. Didn't feel like either had enough flavor.Entrees: basil pesto chicken pizza. This actually was good in my opinion. Not the best pizza I ever had but in Omaha, I'm assuming this is not too bad of a pizza option.Would've rated a 3 but the service was just not good.

It is not busy (maybe just \u00a02 other tables but there was more than one server around).

I have three slices of leftover pizza in the fridge and they're calling my name. But I have to finish this review first. \u00a0From all the tips about the Mia Pie ($18), I had to get it. The mozzarella was gooey, fresh, and stringy. Large pepperoni slices. Generous serving of house made fennel sauasage. (This was delicious btw. and surprising to me because I usually hate anyhting fennel. Just ask any of my friends. Me and fennel don't get along, but they made it work!) I thought for the price it was a little pricey for my broke student budget, so next time I'll go during happy hour for $5 off any pizza.One of my friends ordered the traditional burger with truffle fries ($11) and ohhhhh emmmm geeeeez, I snuck one of her truffle fries (and a couple more later, because you know.) deelicioussss. I'm going to have to order that next time I go because it was amazing.They seem have a lot of great food options here, from salads to pastas-- not just pizza.

The twenty minutes we waited (after calling ahead 30 minutes before arrival) were wasted in noisy silence. I could not hear my wife sitting next to me. Interactions with the staff devolved into shouting, grimacing, and arm-waving.Why all the noise? Good live music, you might ask? NO. Just blaring low-royalty music pumped up to rattle the bottles behind the bar. Ambiance? Hipster has gone mainstream here, too. I suggest a false beard and some hair pomade if you're male, and a false beard and some hair pomade if you're female. Wear skinny jeans and GET SOMETHING PIERCED. You want to BE mainstream, not LOOK mainstream. Insert comment here about how I just don't get it, aren't with it, am out of touch, etc. Or just accept the fake that one can take a trend too far.Nevertheless, the pizza crust was good. What is it about burning the metamorphosed and lithified remains of ancient life forms that makes a pizza crust so tasty? Sadly, that is where it ended. The marinara was omitted from the pie. We noted this to the server and asked for a side after checking the pizza, and were charged $4.00 for what was supposed to be there in the first place. Uggh, I said. Ooorframaoffooleppal said the staff member (I think). He was very friendly, but could not understand the International Sign Language expression for \"this pizza is dry\".Why was the pie mediocre? The mushrooms..they were not sliced, but just thrown on there. Upon arriving they had formed a union in the corner of the box and were demanding justice or something. Don't get me started on the caramelized onions, either. They weren't caramelized, just greasy.I suppose I will put this experience down to a bad day. I can't really pass judgment on a restaurant in one visit. Everyone has those kinds of days. But they do need to turn the music down or issue ear protection to the guests. Also they need to pay attention to their craft. The pie crust was soooo good I would try the place again, but I would never dine in unless the noise level were reduced."], ["Cathy S.", "We love Pitch Pizza in Dundee.

I devoured my pasta. I chose to get it with homemade noodles, of which, I advise everyone of doing. My husband's pizza had a lot of chicken and carrots on it.

You must get the special burger sauce that comes with the burgers. Lastly, our waiter. The last time we went to the Pitch I could not say enough of how poor the service was. This time was the complete OPPOSITE. Our waiter's name was Dan(I think). He helped all of us boost our meals. He recommended the burger sauce and the homemade noodles for our meals.

Probably my favorite pizza in Omaha. On each of my several visits I've always been blown away by their pizza, sides and more.Let's break things down a bit, shall we?Pizza: Sometimes being adventurous here brings the best results. My favorites have been the Bianco Verde (Ricotta cream, prosciutto, carmamelized onions, arugula, mozzarella) and the Shrooms (thyme cream, roasted mushrooms, oven dried tomatoes, grana, truffle oil). Note that the truffle oil on the shrooms pizza is a heavenly food-gazmic combination. Of course I've tried Willy's Favorite as well -- but have not been that impressed. I mean it's just a sausage and pep pizza. It's good and all, but there are better options, for sure.Salads/sides: You have to try the roasted Brussels sprouts -- are are nutty and a bit oily and pure deliciousness. Same goes for the roasted beet salad -- all around amazing with butternut squash, baked goat cheese, pistachios, beets and red wine vinaigrette.Fun facts: They pretty much cure all their meat in-house (what's that fancy word for that? Charcuterie?). Pitch is the latest offering from Godfather's Pizza founder and former owner Willy Theisan. Maybe Pitch is his way of apologizing for those terrible cookie pizzas?Basically, Pitch is one of the best spots in town to wine/dine/nom on some pizza and other delicious bites. And it shows as this place is ALWAYS PACKED!"], ["Jessica S.", "Oh man! This place was good! We made a reservation, which is a good tip because it was busy on a Saturday night. The place had a good atmosphere and was pretty trendy. We were greeted right away and heard about their mouth-watering specials. Blue crab stuffed rainbow trout! YUM! But for $35, it was a little out of the price range. I ordered a cocktail. A blackberry and peach sangria. It was served in a wine glass, but more-or-less just tasted like red wine. I wasn't able to pick out the notes of fruit. Not sure if I am just acclimated to cheap or DIY sangria. The four of us ordered 2 pizzas, and the smoked mac-n-cheese. The mushroom and tomato pizza was good. I am not a huge mushroom pizza, but the tomatos were fresh and tasty. My husband got the Bianca Verde: caramelized onions (which seemed almost raw), fresh arugula (the best!), creamy ricotta sauce, and prosciutto. One of the best pizza combinations I've had. I would totally get this again! I got the smoked mac-n-cheese wich came with mushrooms, asparagus, shrimp, and chicken. This was by far the best mac-n-cheese I've ever consumed. So tasty and flavorful. Adding the shrimp really brought it up a notch! Not too bad for $20. Besides the high prices and the drink that was a let-down, I am excited to go back and try some more of their food."], ["Steve S.", "By far one of my worst experiences in Omaha. The food was not too great, the service was worse than terrible. We got the truffle fries, meatballs, flatbread and a chicken basil pie.The flatbread seemed like it was an abandoned house that was overrun by arugula. Honestly, we had to use a machete to find the cracker it was sitting on to cut through making it able to share. The meatballs may have been the best portion of this meal. They were moist and had a decent flavor, however, they did not have enough sauce. The truffle fries had a good flavor and were interesting, but, obviously it is difficult to make a meal out of truffle fries. The chicken basil pie was interesting to say the least, had a decent flavor, however it was small and overpriced for what it was. The service was possibly the worst I have ever received, our server took forever to take our order, forever, to bring our food, forgot our truffle mac and cheese, then after making eye contact with him multiple times, still failed to come over to the table.

When they have a capable staff in the kitchen, the wings are outstanding. Other than that, there's really no reason to go there.

Mediocre pizza, overpriced specials, lackluster service and food quality that's a roll of the dice -- sometimes food's prepared well, sometime's it's baked/roasted/grilled beyond recognition -- doesn't make for a very pleasant evening. We've given them the benefit of the doubt more than once, thinking maybe it was an off night. But the constant drama of standing around waiting for a table when there's a sea of empty ones, the high prices and so-so food is a constant.

Had reservations for 6 pm on a Saturday night and the place (although some seating was open) was essentially packed, and it just got more and more packed throughout the night.Great atmosphere, Edison lightbulbs, community-style seating down the middle (separated seating elsewhere) -- definitely a cool vibe perfect for Dundee.I'd done my research on the menu ahead of time, and knew there was a wide range of items as far as price goes. Dinner entr\u00e9es all seemed enticing, but for my first trip I knew I had to try a pizza.My wife and I decided to split, and we went with the Shroom pizza....and we picked a winner. Fresh tomatoes, thyme cream, delicious mushrooms. This pizza was worth every penny. And to top it off, it was served piping hot in what seemed like minutes after we ordered. Washed it all down with an ice cold Strongbow -- a great meal.Sampled my brother-in-law's Bianca Verde pizza and although I enjoyed it, I was disappointed that the \"caramelized onions\" weren't even close to caramelized. They seemed to be put on raw and were cooked just a bit so I had to pick them off the slice I tried. With the onions removed, I did like the pizza. Didn't love it, but I thought it was good. I mean, who doesn't like prosciutto on a pizza?But the Smoked Mac 'n Cheese was, hands down, the star of the show. Tried a bite of my sister-in-law's very generous portion (nicely done, Pitch) and was amazed by the depth of flavor, richness and the quality of the ingredients.

Ironically when I polled people on my Facebook page about what to order I got a ton of recommendations for Pitch's vegetable-heavy dishes... also the meatballs. Having enjoyed the Arugula Salad a couple times previously, we branched out a bit and followed the recommendation for Coal Fired (of course) Long Stem Artichokes. And while the menu describes these as coming with 'lemon dipping sauce' it was really so much more. Yes the sauce was amazing, yes the artie's were nicely charred, but they arrived with a bed of lettuce and light dressing with tomatoes. Great dish for sharing. I was still coming off of my summer goat cheese peppadew kick, so those were on order next. These were pretty much exactly as described, but I was disappointed that the salad overshadowed the dainty poppers, which gave the appearance of a sidecar rather than the main event. Still, delicious. Can't really complain too much about that.Pizzas were pretty spot on also. We had the Marsala: figs, goat cheese, pears, arugula, truffle oil, mozzarella and the crowd-pleaser Mia (Willy's Favorite):tomato sauce, fennel sausage, pepperoni, fresh mozzarella. None of my former qualms surfaced... plus it was $30 bottle and pie night, so who's complaining now?! I'm not really a big wine drinker, probably due to lack of education, but I do know that the Pitch Black red blend is really right in my wheelhouse.And with so many more tantalizing items that I still haven't tried, I predict another trip back in the near future.

When one is born in the Boston area and ends up living for a short period in NYC metro area, one comes to expect certain things in a great pizza. Tasty crust.

Their custom pies are great, but they have just enough great protein and veggies toppings that one can make his/her own masterpiece if desired!But pizza isn't the only fantastic thing at Pitch.

They were delicious and we will definitely be ordering them again on our next trip. We ordered the tres peps pizza which was so tasty. I love that the serve the pizza on top of a turned over can.

It was a little hard to eat, I needed a knife and fork, but I still enjoyed it. It was cooked to order and well seasoned. Another Yelper suggested getting it with the white cheddar and that suggestion was spot on. I also had mushrooms on mine and they were very good. A very generous portion of truffle fries were the side. I adore Pitch's truffle fries. They are always hot, crisp and perfect.

This place gets packed! The decor is modern, with wood, stone, stained concrete and funky drop lights that illuminated the room just enough to be cozy and intimate. The menu is well rounded, with a little something for everyone. There are steaks, pasta, salads, appetizers, and the fire roasted pizza, which is why I made the trek from my hotel downtown. A salad and a pizza was enough food for two hungry people, but just enough! Cuz my dinner companion, all but licked the plate. I highly recommend the Tres Peppas pizza. Thin crispy crust with Pepperoni, Pepperoncinis, and jalape\u00f1os. We added onions to produce a pizza of utter perfection. Prices are a little lofty. \u00a0 A 12 inch pizza for $17 and our peppadew and goat cheese salad was $9 But, I am certainly not going to quibble, when the pizza and salad were so delectable.

You're not that kinda girl anyway!"], ["Kelsey B.", "This is one of the best restaurants in Omaha!My friends and I almost always get together here at least once per week to eat and have drinks. \u00a0The ambiance and the trendy/intimate/modern atmosphere is wonderful (my friends and I have discussed on many occasions how we want to design our future homes/kitchens like the interior of Pitch!). \u00a0This would be a perfect place for a date-night as well. :)The menu is out of this world! \u00a0I have never had anything here I didn't like! \u00a0I mean, I don't even like meatballs that much - Pitch made me like them again (but only theirs!). \u00a0I feel like I've tried almost all of the pizzas at one point, all of which are incredible. \u00a0The brussels sprouts appetizer, truffle fries, everything. \u00a0Try it all! \u00a0For drinks, the wine menu is excellent and they usually have some sort of drink special..

If you want a $5 pizza go to Pizza Ranch. Despite other reviews we had excellent service on a very busy CWS happy hour night. The staff were excellent and knew all products well. Being new to the Omaha area it is nice to see trendy places like this existing it reminds me of Chicago or NYC. Recommend anything on the menu but their white pizza is to die for. It was perfectly cooked in the coal fire ovens. Also recommend the goat cheese stuffed peppers delicious !"], ["Kayla C.", "Pitch presents themselves as a pizza place, however, I think their best food is not the pizza. The many other offerings on the menu are my personal favorites. I am not a big fan of meat so it is nice that they have good vegetarian options. Their white bean burger and eggplant parmesan are to die for. I never thought that \"excellent\" and \"eggplant\" would go together in the same sentence until I tried theirs. They also offer excellent salad options for the health conscious and I have yet to try a soup that I did not think was flavorful. They have a wide array of craft cocktails and many wines to choose from. The atmosphere is excellent and is multi-functional; from date night to a birthday celebration with family and friends."], ["Jenn L.", "Great pizza! I got the margherita, my boyfriend got the bianco verde and we split the calamari. Everything was flavorful and fresh! Great sauce, nothing greasy. Service was very good. Only recommendation would be to call ahead for a reservation to avoid a community table if that's not your thing. Will be back!"], ["Jon P.", "AMAZING. We had the coal fired herb wings and the buffalo chicken pizza (the weekly special). Let me just say that fresh arugula on a buffalo chicken pizza works. Great. The service was fantastic (Nancy was our server) and the atmosphere just works. Getting set at a community table was an experience not to be passed on. Next time we are in Omaha we will be back."], ["Wesley C.", "Its been a while since I last lived in Omaha, 1999 to be exact. And when I lived in Omaha its culinary prowess was not exactly something the city was known for. Now granted Omaha had its few hits and places that were fairly tasty. Most places offered your classic americana dishes, burgers, fish/seafood, pizza, and so on. But in the 15 years that I've been gone some things have changed for the better in Omaha, especially in terms of that culinary prowess. The number of quality restaurants in Omaha has seemed to dramatically increase and for a foodie like myself this is music to my ears...or stomach. Pitch Coal-fire Pizzeria represents that culinary explosion that has seemed to come over the city. Upon my visit to Pitch I was surprised to find that it had a very urban and hip feel without any sense of pretentiousness. This is great place for a casual date, hang out with friends, or just enjoy a casual and fun night out with your significant other. Their extensive wine menu offers a bit a class to Pitch and on Sunday nights bottles are 1/2 off! I also love the menu at Pitch. From a variety of starters, to their delicious salads, their chef inspired pasta's, and oh yeah their delicious pizza's. Pitch offers a little bit of something for everyone. I ordered the Heirloom Spinach Mushroom Salad and the Bianco Verde Pizza. I absolutely loved both! The salad was amazing. First of all this salad doesn't need added meat and this is coming from the most carnivorous person I know. The mushroom are so thick and substantial that it adds a meat like heartiness to the salad. Then the feta, the quinoa, and the pistachios create a unique flavor that you will not find in many salads. Then there is the pizza! Oh my goodness. We went with the Bianco Verde and it was everything we dreamed it to be. First of all, the tastiness of this pizza starts with the crust. So perfectly light, airy, and yet filling at the same time. The Bianco Verde \u00a0is taste so fresh and creamy. The ricotta cream base paired with the freshness of the arugula and the saltiness of the prosciutto makes quite a tasty pizza. Lastly, we order the \u00a0Bread Pudding to make this one of the most perfect meals ever! The bread pudding is a must if you have room for it. Soo...make room for the bread pudding!Pitch Coal-fire Pizzeria is the absolute real deal. Everytime I come back to Omaha I will make a visit to Pitch. But what would really make me excited is if Pitch decided to build a location in Houston, Tx where I live. Their pizza would seriously be some of the best in town and I would be their quite often!"], ["Michal L.", "I love this place! \u00a0Great Pizza, great meatballs, and amzing bread! \u00a0Don't miss it if you are in the area!"], ["Happy D.", "The service is very good. the food is prompt.

I had been to Pitch only once in the past and that was before I got bitten by Yelp. I also had a different eating philosophy. Today was another stop on will S' Burger Brigade. I think I may be up for a promotion in rank. The first thing I saw were the shadow people. It was pretty dark. It was late lunchtime. Reservations for the 'Gade had secured a table near the bus area. Our server came over to us as we arrived a bit \u00a0early (who wouldn't be on time for foody yums?) and offered recommendations and opinions.I got an Odell's IPA to start. Wifey got a great red blend wineA few others arrived and sat at the table with us. A shout out to Hector, Regina, and Trish! All new to the Brigade and excited to be a part of it. Soon enough,our Burger General shows up and we start to talk about food.Appetizers ordered were Veggie sliders, for me, brussel sprouts, meatball sliders, and an an Olive bowl.I was a little surprised that my sliders were just some steamed veggies and arugala. I don't know what I thought it would be, but I was off guard. The olive bowl was pretty good . 3 kinds of olives and some foccacia spears. I am not a fan of olives and these ones had pits. Still pretty good.Since this is the Burger Brigade it makes sense that we talk burgers. Wifey got a veggie sandwich the kitchen made sure was vegan and that was pretty good. It appeared to be a full size veggie sliders sans white cheddar. I ordered the crispy white bean burger. Since capers make me cringe, the mustard sauce was on the side. the house made pickles were tasty, but really thick. I had to smash my burger sown a few times just to be able to eat it. It didn't hit home. It was a little shy on flavor. Nothing stood out as any sort of OMG moment. It was just a burger. Bummer. I will be back, but will probably just focus on a beer"], ["Cara C.", "Best dining experience in Omaha. Our server, Joelle, was amazing and made our first time there awesome.

The ambience was hip but sometimes, the only excuse for really loud music is if it's coming from a live band. \u00a0Otherwise, the buzz of happy people eating their pizza may not need to compete with blasting music. \u00a0A solid spot and one I would visit again."], ["Ali L.", "Went here again for dinner on a Friday night. Wow, was this place busy!!Still a tad pricey, but what bothered me was that the waitress added on an automatic 20% \"large party\" tip, when we only had 5 people eating, and a baby in a highseat drinking from it's bottle. I wasn't impressed by this method one bit.The food was good, except the calamari appetizer was a bit soggy. I'm not sure how that happens, but it wasn't all that good. The Shrooms and Chicken Basil pizza were both good, but my new favorite is the Chop Salad. Might just stick with that next time and call it a day. Also, their meatballs are as large as your fist.

I have a few favorites at the Benson location and looked forwarded to enjoying them with less drive time. Some pluses is this location offers happy hour and brunch two things I love. I'm not sure if this location is smaller, same sized or larger than the Benson one but they have a patio which is wonderful. The somillo fries are TO DIE FOR. Always great no matter when I visit. They have a similar item on the brunch menu with eggs that I need to try.Some misses include the potato omelette that is nothing like Benson's and doesn't include an option for the cream sauce. Some of the other items I've tried just didn't stack up to dishes I've had at the original but the somillo fries are worth the trip."], ["Robb T.", "We went here on a whim of sorts last Saturday July 18th and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0The last time I had been to Espana in Benson a few years ago, I was not that excited about the food I ate. I must say that Little Espana brought back the great memories of Tapas once again. \u00a0We had four adults and two 9 1/2 year olds and ordered a gamut of Tapas. \u00a0We ordered Croquetas de Jamon Serrano y Pollo that was just awesome in flavor and taste, Calamares a la Romana that were very good, Albondigas that melt in your mouth, \u00a0Carpaccio Bistec that was incredible and I believe a few others. \u00a0I really like grilled octopus and was a little disappointed as it the meat of the octopus was a bit over done. \u00a0At one point the owner came over and talked with our friends with us who had previously dined at the restaurant. \u00a0He was very interested in hearing our concerns and invited the critique of our food. \u00a0We discussed the problem with the hot grilled octopus and he advised that he would work with his chefs to make sure that the preparation was corrected. \u00a0He also offered and sent out the cold octopus tapas and asked us what we thought of it. \u00a0To me the cold octopus had much better preparation and the only thing was that the vinegar was a bit heavy handed. \u00a0He understood and did his best to help us understand about the type of vinegar used and promised he would work on possibly re-working the preparation of it in case there are others who did not mention the over-whelming vinegar flavor. \u00a0I did not initially notice the vinegar as I was just so happy with the difference in how the octopus tasted with everything else that was part of this dish.Overall the meal was pretty tasty and I look forward to going back to Little Espana once again for a meal. \u00a0I found the service to be very good and that the owner was there and invited direct feedback and was accepting of our thoughts really impressed me. \u00a0The Sangria as well was quite tasty and maybe next time I'll have to have someone else drive so that I may enjoy more Sangria next time. \u00a0I just hope it does not take my wife and I to long to return to enjoy some more tapas."], ["Sara D.", "I definitely had better experiences at the original Espana in Benson. The server was new which as someone who works in the service industry I am more than patient with, but when I ask a specific question like is your iced tea brewed or on the gun, and you don't know the answer, there's no shame in asking. Instead he said with conviction that it was brewed when in fact it was not. There were several other questions we asked that he clearly winged the answers. The food was mostly good.

The Burger came back well-done and honestly, way too charred. For extras like cheeses and caramelized onion, they do charge a $0.95 fee. The fries are ok. In my opinion, It's not as good as the fries from Pitch or even from Brix. Or King Kong. Or McDonald's. My husband ordered the short rib taco, which came with Mac and cheese. I thought his food was really great. Atmosphere: very modern decor and the place was pretty clean even though we came during lunch. Service was fine.

Because, riding by, the 80's style purple sign clearly reads \"Jams: An American Girl\". Since I wasn't into dolls, I never asked to get a closer look and probably continued in that assumption until I was old enough to pay for my own food and choose restaurants for myself. Though I don't think I ever set foot into Jams until after college....The point of that little anecdote is that Jams has been around for a while (a point that can also be driven home by visiting their website), but they're obviously doing something very, very, right. Heck, they're even able to win over people who think they shouldn't like the place (Anastasia B.) First off, I will warn people that it gets VERY busy very quickly at lunchtime (but if you arrive no later than 11:30 you should be relatively safe). It's not a regular dinner spot for us - again, because of the busy-ness - but you CAN make reservations for both lunch and dinner. This is actually recommended. My staple order is usually the fish tacos or whatever the lunch special is, because Jams knows how to do a special. They also know how to heat up a Rotella's roll to the perfect temperature to tempt me to also order soup at lunchtime... soups which do not disappoint either. \u00a0From the dishes I've tried here, you really can't go wrong. Just order something that appeals to you - easier said than done in my case. First up, there are the Fish Tacos. Negra Modelo battered mahi mahi with lightly griddled flour tortillas, avocado, manchego cheese, red cabbage and a pile of cilantro (just how I like it). Served with charred tomatillo salsa, cumin-carrot crema, red chili rice and chipotle black beans. It's a winner, and probably my favorite menu item. Then there's the Burger. How do you make what could arguably be called juiciest burger in town? You grind up brisket, chuck and short ribs to accompany the house blend ground beef. Then the diner is free to add extras like bacon, grilled or balsamic onions, mushrooms, and cheese (cheddar, swiss, jack, gorgonzola or American). Fresh vegetable toppers, and a soft bun finish it off. The fries are also pretty darn tasty, which doesn't hurt. \u00a0Salads are always a good choice here as well if you want that 'healthy feel good ordering' thing, though since they're covered with delectable salad goodies (crab cakes, field greens, roasted walnuts, gorgonzola, bacon, red onions, tomato and avocado tossed in a creamy creole red pepper dressing... for example) I'm sure they're not really any healthier than a burger and fries per se. But if you're a restaurant-salad person, don't miss these leafy concoctions.

Although it looks a little different inside, it still feels like Jams. We didn't have reservations but were seated as long as we were done by a certain time. That didn't bother us as we are not ones that linger after we eat.I had the Ramen bowl which was delicious. There were 7 of us and we sat in the party room area with the big tables. One in my party said the fries were a little cool but said the steak was very good. Everyone else's plates were empty by the time we were done. Except my son.

My friend Rick started with his appetizer of choice anywhere he eats a few Heineken's. For my main meal i had the, which i highly recommend, \u00a0the Jams Burger a delicious house blend ground beef brisket and for. 95\u00a2 each you can man it up any way you want.

It was a little different from standard country fried steaks because the beef wasnt completely ground, but was rather in a bunch of of small chunks, making it taste less like a hamburger and something more unique. There was also a side of mashed potatoes and some very good cole slaw. I'm not sure what the dressing for the cole slaw was made of, but it was just the right amount of sweet to along with the other parts of the meal.

While there were a few standout dishes, like the brisket-gorgonzola pizzette special and the blue crab rangoon spring rolls, the food here is just above average fare. Tucked away in the middle of a random strip mall along Dodge Street, Jams is packed to the gills during lunchtime. Our waitress was exceptional given that our party only arrived a few people at a time over the course of an hour. The party room itself was spacious, holding around 14 or so people, and set away from the rest of the restaurant, with its own large screen TV. (Thankfully, we were able to spare everyone from any dreadful PowerPoint presentations.)Sandwiches are ginormous, as we were warned. And although I didn't order it, the meatloaf entree looked like the best thing out of the bunch. (Korrie H. highly recommends it.) I went for the Texas Chopped Salad with grilled chicken, which would have been much better without the cloying sweetness of the \"Texas moppin' sauce\" -- a.k.a. BBQ sauce.

My boyfriend and I ate here a month ago. The waiter assured me I would be safe to eat here having Celiacs. Great! Well, I got extremely ill. Hey, it happens. Mistakes happen. I called the manager the next day just to give a heads up. He was accusatory saying no one has ever gotten ill at his restaurant, saying \"people come in with a new allergy every day and no one gets sick\". He said he would talk to the kitchen and email me back. I never received a response. I tried three times to get ahold of him, each time the person answering the phone saying he wasn't in and they'd have him call me back. Never got a return call. Finally, a month later I get him on the phone. I ask for a refund, because at this point I'm upset with the lack of respect I've received from everyone I've come across at Boiler Room (accusing a customer of lying about a food allergy is quite absurd). I've never in my life been so rudely spoken to. The manager says \"let me get this straight you want a free meal, and you want me to refund your bfs meal\". Well no, sir, we paid separately and left a cash tip. He accused us of not leaving a $40 tip on a $100 bill. We are good tippers, why would you now think I'm lying about this? He asked me if I owned a restaurant. No, I do not, but I am a business owner. To which he asked if I just hand out free services. Which, actually, at times I do. I also would never accuse a customer of lying and berate them over the phone. His last words to me were \"I am so sorry this has been such a treacherous month for you dealing with this.\" Insert the sarcastic tone.I am appalled with an attitude like this Boiler Room stays in business.

I am not a foodie or a restaurant snob. I was looking for a unique, romantic dining experience...A coworker recommended The boiler room. The road to the restaurant may make your car bottom out, extremely poor condition and gives a bad first impression. They have parking slots in front of the building that state \"boiler room permit parking only\".. So not knowing what that meant we drove around and paid to park. We had a reservation and when we made it to the restaurant the hostess asked if we parked in front. To which we said, no...apparently they are for diners that would have been a nice thing for them to tell us when we made our reservation. The building is very cool. Menus are a single piece of paper, very few options and ingredients that, unless you're a chef you don't know what exactly you're ordering. Case and point...the house charcuterie- house cured meats, pickles, mustard. This looked like a can of soft cat food nicely plated; two triangles of some rabbit and something with relish; some flesh colored bologna looking stuff...the mustard, cracker sticks and candied almonds were really good but the main part of the appetizer was disgusting.I ordered some pear infused vodka drink, which our waiter had recommended based on the fact that I like cosmopolitans. It was served in a tall glass and tasted like straight tequila on ice. Aw-ful!! Thankfully our waiter took it away and didn't charge us for it. So I stuck with a safe glass of wine. I ordered red snapper with baby shrimp on gnocchi. It was good, but after sampling all of the flesh colored meats from the appetizer I was a little queasy. I had asked our waiter, \"of the fish entrees what do you recommend because I'm not sure what all of these ingredients are...\" he suggested the snapper, which is what I was leaning towards, but he didn't provide ANY explanation of the other options or explain any of the ingredients -- as I hinted that I was looking for some help in deciphering it all. \u00a0Disappointing. My husband ordered a sirloin as he isn't a fan of fish--the menu options were fish, fish, fish, rabbit, pork loin or steak. It was decent, but from Nebraska we've had better steaks... Also we were sitting by a painting of a pig face and that was a little disgusting. I know where meat comes from but I don't want to be reminded about it while I'm eating it!I would never recommend someone to eat here.

It paired amazingly with lamb ragu tortellini in an unctuous consomme and brandade beignets to start, followed by amazingly cooked steak and a meaty chunk of sturgeon. A very minor hiccup was the barley served under the steak... it was a touch on the al dente side. However, the lentils served with the fish were done to perfection. I do appreciate the friendliness of the service, but it does seem a little amateurish at times. Staff regularly reach across diners to replace silverware. A lot of time passes between courses. On a previous evening, our waiter expected us to bone our own whole fish, which I wouldn't have expected from this caliber of restaurant.

Not my favorite. The chicken tacos were decent. Chicken is shredded which I was not ready for and the taste was okay, but I found the texture to be slightly off putting.

The masa cake was the perfect complement to the flavorful pork and the other topping really rounded out the flavor of this dish. I also loved the chips that came with the guacamole - they are slightly puffy, but still crispy. The guacamole was spicy, but delicious, and I enjoyed the addition of the mango to the other ingredients. It gave the guacamole a unique flavor that you don't typically find in guacamole. The price on this visit was much more reasonable for what we got. I will definitely be returning for their happy hour again."], ["Tracey K.", "We have been going to Mula since they opened.

This could be the most disappointing restaurant of 2014 so far. Our group of 5 spent almost $200 and we didn't get one thing that any of us would return for.Started with elote, queso and chicharrones. What a trio of disappointment. The elote was bland and expensive - you can get elote 10x better for half the price, the queso was just bizarre and bad tasting & the chicharrones were horrid - big chunks of pork fat. Chicharrones are delicious chunks of crispy pork belly - but not here.Next up guacamole and a salsa trio. Bland guacamole and a tomato salsa that tasted like stewed tomatoes dumped into a bowl. Terrible. After that the Huevo con Chorizo - one soft boiled egg covered in bland chorizo for $6.50Entrees were tacos and \"tortas\". The tacos were ridiculous. I could live with the size and the price if they were good but my four were a disaster. The al pastor was edible but the fish, shrimp and carnitas were awful. I threw two away. The \"tortas\" were equally odd and disappointing. The chicken torta had to be ate without the top bun because it was so burnt and the carnitas torta was discarded since the pork was inedible - not to mention this was basically a hamburger bun not a traditional torta roll.This was a sad excuse for a dinner and I will never return. The waitress had great enthusiasm but she has obviously never ate this food or has nothing good to compare it to."], ["Jessie R.", "Good food, drinks are tasty, waitress thought she was the shit, employees are super hipster. 5 stars for food --- Overall, the food was honestly really good. We had the shrimp, el pastor, chicken, and fish tacos and one order of smoked ceviche (amazing). They're surprisingly small but that is expected at a tapas restaurant. 3 stars for service --- on their menu and website it states there is happy hour on Saturdays. This was the #1 reason we came here. HOWEVER, when I asked for the happy hour specials after being, the waitress informed me that is false and no happy hour existed on Saturdays. I accepted her statement BUT when I viewed the menu it clearly stated happy hour on Saturday from 4-6 PM. I was curious about this and pointed it out to the waitress and she started at me annoyingly and said \"the menu is old and there is no happy hour. Sorry\". Soooooo lame. Probably wouldn't for back.

The options were clear: taco truck in the Thrift World parking lot on Leavenworth or try Mula for the first time. Taco truck is cheaper, faster, etc. Mula is new and exciting and oh yeah they have margaritas so it's obvious I went to Mula.Trio of fish tacos for $9. Perfectly battered and crisp. A nice pile of cabbage on top. And a teensy weensy bit of sauce. All on toasted corn tortillas. Could've used more sauce, to be honest. Needed a cool, creamy hit with every crunchy, hot bite of taco. But I'm splitting hairs, here. The tacos were good.And the margarita. The Mula Margarita. On the rocks. Sweet. Tart? Lime and tequila and salt and all the other stuff that went into it -- refreshing, tasty and exactly what I was hoping for. Really, really good.Service was friendly but it was a touch busy that day with only two on the waitstaff. Just a couple moments where I was expecting/hoping for our server and she wasn't there to check in, etc. Drinks took a bit to get to us but well worth the wait."], ["Mike D.", "What a great place to put into the constantly being rennovated Blackstone District. I have unfortunately made the Blackstone District my second home because of a certain bar in the area....read my reviews.....uggghhh and if you could only see my number of check ins there....Great spot for this restaurant though, we need more eateries that aren't in snooty Midtown Crossing down the street.I really like the feel of Mula. It feels pretty upscale and classy but you can tell just average people are welcome. It's got some fancy light fixtures, a nice bar, nicely dressed waitresses, and some seating made out of jumbled parts of church pews and picnic tables. Or something like that. Not the most comfortable place I've ever eaten. This place does have about the smallest menu of all time. Tacos and Tortas. That's it folks. Amazing looking drink menu, all based on tequila of course. My mother ordered the Pamona (Pomona?) and she loved it. We ordered some chips and their roasted tomato salsa to start out with. You get about half a soup cup of salsa for $5 but unlimited chips. I want to run out of chips before the salsa please. You are charging $5 for something that costs 50 cents to make. At least let people get a second cup of it. We all ordered three various tacos, I had the Al Pastor (my usual), jack fruit al pastor, and the carnitas. Al pastor was decent, carnitas was cooked perfect, and the jack fruit al pastor was good but all I could taste was the fruit juice. I normally enjoy pieces of pineapple in my al pastor but they kind of overdid it. I also ordered the fanciest horchata I've ever seen. A little lacking on the sweet side but overall pretty good. Love this new addition to the area and I hope it keeps good business. Unfortunately, you can get much better tacos at cheaper prices in South Omaha. This place is made for Midtown Crossing apartment owners who are scared to travel out of their safe zone.

I absolutely love the look and feel of the restaurant. So unique and perfect for the neighborhood. And now the food is finally catching up. When I first tried Mula I fell in love with everything from the bar. The fresh squeezed juices make all the difference. And for $4 their happy hour margarita is AMAZING. I also enjoy most of the appetizers and have found them pretty consistent. What I have not found consistent are the tacos. Considering half the menu is tacos I would expect them to be amazing. This has not been the case. I've literally tried all of them and never found a good one in the bunch. This always disappointed me considering the Tortas use the same proteins and are delicious! \u00a0I finally gave up on the tacos and upon every visit I'd stick with a Torta. The beef cheek Torta with a fried egg will rock your world. On a recent visit during happy hour however I decided I'd revisit the tacos and so happy I did. I ordered the battered fish tacos and they were absolutely amazing. Fish batter was light and crispy and the sauce and toppings were equally delicious and so flavorful! \u00a0Exactly what they weren't before. I almost ordered a second round they were so good. After a bit of hesitation I asked the bartender if they had made changes in the kitchen. She explained that over the last few months they had really begun to put a lot of work and effort into the tacos. It's paid off in droves! \u00a0I hope they manage to maintain these new standards.

We arrived at happy hour so we went with that menu. Ordered the albindigas, sopa, huevo ranchero and a smoked corn dish. The albindigas and huevos rancheros were great. The corn side came in a sealed jar with swirling smoke that released when we opened it, I liked it. The sopa looked appetizing but was a bit bland and one note. Service was great.

Once with a party of ten and once as a duo. My experience both times were excellent. The first trip had ten excited diners of varying adventure levels. If you know me....you know I am on the low end. I was blown away by our waitress's ability to handle a ten top on a weekend during a busy dinner rush. I was more impressed with her knowledge of the food, drinks and her ability to confidently make suggestions. I was boring this time and got an IPA from local brewer Infusion while everyone else got mixed drinks they were raving about. Infusion's IPA is very good also. Every appetizer and kind of guacamole was purchased by and for the table, and our crew went through it all and many pleasurable sounds and comments were made throughout. I went after the pork belly which just melted beautifully in ones mouth. I was told by the waitress two weeks later that the recipe had changed and that people said it was too fatty. Who are you people?? I had four mini tacos steak, pork and shrimp (they all have Mexican names) the steak was good, the pork was fantastic (braised in coke, slightly crispy and flavorful) and the shrimp was mouth burning delicious. At 41 I have just become addicted to mouth burning food and these guys are the inspiration. The second meal was also on a weekend during dinner. \u00a0We had a different server who was also knowledgeable and great with suggestions. Since I was told the pork belly had changed I went with the Mexican/Scottish Egg (which has a Mexican name) for an appetizer and got a cocktail called Don Flores which is a tequila based mojito. The drink was delicious and was something that I enjoyed sipping throughout dinner. The egg was delicious. Spicy sausage, a crisp then moist breading/crust and well, an egg. Super flavorful. Not going to lie...I did the same tacos again and they were just the same as a couple weeks back. I am really enjoying both this area of town and this eatery. It will be a very regular stop seeing as how many of my friends enjoyed it also."], ["Erin F.", "I went here with friends and had an amazing time. The atmosphere is so fun, there are so many inventive menu options, and the food is GOOD! I had the chicken tostada with a side of esquites and was really impressed. One thing to be warned about: the food is SPICY! It's so flavorful and good I didn't mind, but I was definitely drinking a lot of water to cool off my mouth in-between bites. If you're really not into spice I'd definitely let the waitress know so they can make sure to turn down the spice in your food so you enjoy it."], ["Anna F.", "Mula is one of the new restaurants in the Blackstone District which is a new up and coming area in Omaha right now. We've been there several times for the great tacos and tequilaria! Tacos and drinks are a little expensive but I think that given the ambiance and vibe in the restaurant the prices aren't too surprising. I'd recommend the carne asada tacos! They come in a set of three (which is different than the a la carte menu that this restaurant first featured upon opening) and are small. The margaritas here are great! I believe this restaurant does a taco Tuesday (?) or something that features pretty cheap select tacos so that would be a good option for a first timer who doesn't know what they like yet. I remember the fish tacos being very good as well if you're in the mood for fish. I really wish this restaurant had outdoor seating but there's just not room for it out front. If you can't make it to South Omaha for tacos, Mula is a fabulous option! Make a reservation though, as this restaurant has given me a 1.5 hour wait time on a busy weekend night before."], ["Jason B.", "My wife and I popped in late on a Saturday night, around 9PM. It wasn't very busy and we were sat at a tall table near the front. We had a nice view out the window and could see the car and pedestrian traffic going past on Farnam. Service was good. We started out with some drinks. My wife really enjoyed her cocktail. We ordered an appetizer to share and a a trio of tacos each. The appetizer never came out, but they did try to charge us for it when the check came. The tacos were OK, but nothing really special, and were fairly expensive for the amount of food. The space is really pretty cool with a great ambiance, but I was not impressed by the food or the prices. The potential certainly seems there, though, so I'd like to give them another shot, maybe during happy hour when things are a bit more affordable. Two and a half stars that I'll round up to three."], ["Elspeth M.", "Since I live in the neighborhood, I was really excited when this place opened. I've tried it a few times and keep walking a way feeling generally indifferent. I like the atmosphere - it's lively and colorful. And I like the options on the menu. But, the quality of the dishes seems to be hit or miss and frankly, I think it's pretty overpriced."], ["Sarah G.", "I really try to wait out new restaurants for a while before visiting but the 20+ glowing reviews of MULA lured me in early... Unfortunately. And now, as I sit down to write what will undoubtedly be called a rant by some, I find myself a little suspicious of some reviews as well.Out of the 25 current reviews, the 4 Elites (5 now, including myself) have an aggregate rating of 2.2. There are 6 glowing reviews currently filtered out by the suspicious Yelp robots. And over half of the 5-star reviewers have 3 or less total reviews.Now, I have heard good things from people I actually know. But the ratings are so all over the board it'll be interesting to see how this pans out with time.As for me, MULA is currently tied for biggest restaurant letdown of the summer. Out of all of the items we sampled last night, nothing would draw me back. Right now I'm even struggling for something I could call my \"favorite\"... Probably the chips? Or the drinks. Those were some pretty stout craft cocktails (but for $10 I'd certainly hope so). Perhaps part of the problem is that I just don't subscribe to the trend of fancy Mexican restaurants? When I can get tacos, tortas and the like with 10x the flavor at 1/2 the price - or less - from a dozen plus other restaurants by driving only 5 more minutes... What's MULA bringing to the table for me?Besides, literally, the following: Jalapeno Business Mula (mule) - with house-infused tequila, cucumber, peppers and ginger beer. This was absolutely refreshing, and hands-down the best thing I had at Mula. Is it good enough to go back for solo though?Mez Jackson Coctele - with vida organic mezcal, Mexican reserve brandy and fresh orange. Tasted like smoked citrus... in a good way. Elote Mexicano - not something I would have ordered probably, and still somehow it managed to not meet my expectations. The corn was charred, yes. But it was only luke-warm and really pretty cumbersome to eat, which I wouldn't expect here. Chicaronnes - the description reads, \"pork belly\" and that's literally what it was. But I've been noticing recently a disturbing trend that continued here. All fat. And in this case, it wasn't even really that charred. Yes, I realize that pork belly is nearly all fat... but there's a pretty significant difference between 92% fat and 100% fat. This was a dislike.Queso Flameado - going back through our pictures, I forgot we had this. Then I remembered it tasted mostly like beans and pumpkin... neither of which have the kick of the ancho chilis I was hoping for. Chips were good though. Huevo con Chorizo - \u00a0time for a Scotch Egg themed rant. Last time I checked you can get a top of the line local, free range, organic egg for less than $0.50. Add in a dollars worth of chorizo and the the remaining $5 is... Labor? If there were two eggs for that price, I would consider ordering it again, because scotch egg with chorizo is an idea long past due. But in its current state of affairs it's just proportionately too pricey.Salsa Flight - as the menu reads... charred pineapple (mango, habanero, vanilla bean, mint), roasted tomato (pumpkin seed, spring onion), tomatillo (avocado, serrano, cilantro). as the flavor profile lingers in my memory... pineapple? plain tomato. actually decent. Carnitas Torta - this was the biggest fail of the evening, for me. The carnitas are described as 'Coca-Cola-braised Michoacan pork'... That probably should have been a clue to not order. In my humble opinion, the only place for Coke in Mexican food is when it comes from the ice bin of a truck in a glass bottle. This was one of those rare occasions where I forego the bun and went for the fillings only, but the meat itself seemed dry and way too sweet. They did comp this off the check, but it was handled a bit strangely.Tacos - Al Pastor and Baja Fish for me. Neither were really exciting. Again, I try not to make comparisons, but for $2.50 I can think of at least a half dozen places I'd rather eat tacos - some of which are the best in town. The heavy metal tray these came on was my favorite part.Re-reading the menu now, it all sounds great... in theory. The execution just wasn't on point.All that being said, service was top-notch and I would be willing to maybe try again in a few months if the reviews stay positive. There were some other drinks I still need to try, after all... like house Horchata!Now on the topic of money... I'd be happy to shell out the $80 we spent on dinner for myself (and have done so before happily) if the eats are amazing.The food just wasn't. The interior is great, service was friendly, location is VERY appealing as the Farnam Street corridor comes alive. Though without great food, I can't say I'll be frequenting Mula.Even though it seems unfair, you can't ignore the fact that there is a wealth of amazing Mexican food to be had only 3 miles from here."], ["Dave L.", "I'm torn when it comes to Mula. The food is good, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is fun, but the volume, pricing, and service need a little work.First of all is the wait. I'm not above waiting to be seated, but if you're not there plenty early in the evening you're looking at an hour +. In the three times we've been there the longest wait was 90 minutes, while the shortest was about 20. Taking reservations would be a great solution to the problem, but they don't currently do so.Once seated the food is great, but the portion size is a bit skimpy for the pricing. We love the more artisanal presentation and ingredient list, but you'll need to order more than you think of you want to walk away full.The overall atmosphere is really fun and modern, but if it's busy you literally have to shout to be heard by others in your party. Maybe we've just visited on rowdy nights, but it's definitely not somewhere to go if you want quieter conversation.Once you're seated servers are very knowledgeable, but also slow. Recently, it took our party of four right at 3 hours from walk-in to clearing the check on a Friday night. Not a major deal if you have a relaxed schedule, but we plan differently when it comes to time if we eat here.Overall, Mula is a really solid place with good food and a few kinks to work out.

I had the Camaron, Al Pastor, and Carne Asada. \u00a0I'm not sure how to describe them, other than to say they just lacked flavor. \u00a0Everything could have used a little more spice, citrus, and even a pinch of salt to really kick it up. \u00a0I've just had better Mexican food (at a cheaper price-point) elsewhere in Omaha."], ["Suzy W.", "It seems like the reviews for Mula are either hot or cold, so I will bravely venture to give a lukewarm review. I would give Mula a 3.5 if I could. \u00a0Food: we sampled several items in the menu. The winners were the Tortas and the salsa trio. I will describe everything that we tried.Yes, everyone says that the tortillas are small. The exact size is about the size of the palm of your hand or about 3\" in diameter. The couple next to us made a point of telling us that the tacos are small. I don't know if they have any plans to enlarge the tortillas if this is a common complaint.Smoked ceviche: we were fooled into thinking that the ceviche would have a smoky flavor, but they explained the smoke is more of an effect than a flavor. Unique presentation in the jar, and it smoked when we opened it. Salsa trio: my favorite was tomatillo, even though the waitress didn't recommend it. My companion liked the pineapple habanero, even though it was too sweet for me. The chips were crisp and delicious.Tortas: this was the highlight for me. I ordered the carnitas torta, and the meat was crispy, tender, and flavorful. Special props because my companion is gluten free and they accommodated her by serving the torta in a lettuce wrap instead of bread.Helote loco: beautiful presentation but a little overpriced at $4 for an ear of corn. Reminds me of Mexican street food.Service: the server painstakingly explained the menu, which would be helpful if you were familiar with Mexican food. The service was slow and scattered. She forgot several things and we had to remind her, such as refilling our water.Decor: yes it is beautiful and modern, and I thought it was a good sign to see our Lady of Guadalupe at the bar. I certainly appreciate their dedication to local ingredients that are fresh and organic or free range.

We were all expecting a little bit more flavor and complexity. Between the four of us we had 12 tacos and none of us were blown away by any of them.Prices were pretty good. The tacos averaged about $2.50 each. The bill for our table which included three appetizers, four cocktails and 12 tacos totaled $77 without tip.Ambience was another \u00a0strong point of this restaurant, you could definitely tell that they had invested some good money lighting which added some uniqueness.

For our appetizer we went with one of the house made guacamole. Not only was the guacamole delicious but the bottomless homemade fresh warm tortilla chips were amazing! I hate to admit it but between my husband and myself we devoured three baskets! For dinner I ordered two tacos. Both of them were delicious.

The guac was decent, not spectacular. The chips were homemade and quite good. The margarita was the star of the show for me, but it also was expensive. I had 3 TINY tacos, 2 small margaritas and the chips and guac and my bill was $29 dollars before tip.

The food, however, just couldn't manage to do anything for me to make me want to come back. The guacamole is decent and the carne asada tacos were great, but it's just not enough considering the rest of the meal elicits a mere shrug.Major issues:1. \"Ice\" water is actually tap water in a bottle. It has not been chilled and is barely cooler than room temperature. No ice in the glasses, either. We were told that ice is not available.2. The only soda available is bottled Mexican soda. That's great, because it's made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup, if I recall. But again, no ice! It's 90 degrees outside and there's no ice for drinks? What?3. Popped hominy sounds like a good idea as an appetizer. I love hominy! But this was the oddest thing I've ever eaten. The texture was stale, there was no crispiness at all.Honestly, I am not sure what Mula is trying to do. Are they trying for an upscale street taqueria? My time living in California exposed me to many taquerias that produced far more flavorful meals.We will try it again in a few months to see if they've worked out the growing pains.

The chiccarones in particular was melt-in-your-mouth richness. Our server was much less car salesman-y than the one we had last visit, but she was still very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful. The carne asada taco I had last time was too good with it's charred woody smokiness to resist a second time, and it did not disappoint.This time I tried a signature cocktail, the Jalape\u00f1o Business, which is a spice-infused version of the Moscow Mule.

It speaks well for the district's promise in becoming one of Omaha's \"destination\" entertainment districts. The cocktail selection in extensive and innovative. Many traditional cocktails are reimagined to incorporate the wide variety of tequilas on the shelf.

Don't slam those shots - sip!The food has been great! \u00a0My favorite thing so far has been an appetizer called Huevos Chorizo. It an egg cooked inside a crusty shell of spicy chorizo goodness. Great for 2-4 people to split. From there go to the tacos. I've tried most of them and all were delicious. This is a place where you could work to blow your entertainment budget but it'd be a challenge. For the most part, I plan to make this a place where I can have a casual drink and light dinner and get out for something under $25. It's a special place where you needn't spend big $. Mula will join places like Pitch Pizza where you get a premium experience for a price that you can afford everyday."], ["April R.", "Got here last night about 7:30pm, grabbed a seat with my friend in the front of the restaurant, which was great people watching! Started with the chips and house gauc. I literally wanted to jump on this delicous tortilla and float around in the guac. Awesome, fresh stuff. I had a strawberry tequila infused margarita, which was a little too sweet and not strong enough for my margartias taste, but a cool refreshing summer drink for sure! My friend had the mule (teq./bere bevvie in a copper mug) I think he enjoyed it, he slurped it down ;) He then moved on to the Red Sangria. I have had Sangria in Spain, both in Barcelona and Madrid, and this was not like what I have had or made before. Not saying it was bad, but very unique, kind of a smokey, bold flavor. In regards to the service at this point, My drink came out fast, but had to ask about my friends drink delivery. No big deal really, unless you had a really crappy day and needed that tequila ASAP. our waitress Tanya was the cutest thing we have seen all week, but then again as spin instructors we were partial to her bicycle tattoo! Sadly though, we were informed they were out of Tortas (mexican sandwiches) bummer, but I am confident this wont happen again! WE tried the smoke fish ceviche, now I can easily eat seafood for every meal, everyday, but my dining partner was not a fan of the fishy taste, yay- I get to eat it all myself! I wish the container was a little more full, but we ordered enough food to compensate. I liked the \"smoke\" that came out as you opened the jar, pretty cool. Next up - taco time! Keep in mind, this was my 3rd taco experience of the day...and lunch was at the truck of Mariscos Los Willys, so my standards were HIGH! I got the chicken and al pastor taco. My friend had the Al Pastor and Machaca (beef check). They were smaller than other street tacos I have had in town, and only (1) corn tortilla, but we devoured them quickly. The smoked pineapple with the pastor(pork) is always a slam dunk if they are not overcooked, and these were perfect. He didnt care for the beef cheek as much, def. a fattier option. (funny, as I was tying this review, my friend said he went again last night and they ran out of Tortas again.NOOO!) We finished our meal off with the Churros- so glad we stuffed these babies in! The doughest churros I have ever had, they were so amazing. The chocolate dipping sauce was a spiced dark chocolate atole. The only sad part...we had more chocolate sauce than churros...which obviously there should be extra churros to compensate for this ;) The owner Michael came by our table to check on us, got some history on the space, local food goodies and such. They get 5 stars from me, b/c he told me there was a patio in back (still working on the design) but dining on a patio in the summer is probably one of my favorite things to do! Pros: Decor, energy, wait staff, location, food!Cons: Keep running out of tortas :( Parking will be a challenge...maybe they could install bike racks ;) Discounts for alternative transporters? No wine options? Yes, I know...I am in a tequila place and shouldnt want wine, but I always want it :) Would LOVE a queso option without all of the stuff in it. A good ole basic white queso would be amazing ;) Great job guys! welcome to the city, keep the goodness coming!

Second time, the server was much more knowledgeable and attentive. I knew what to expect for portions, so I ordered accordingly.

I'm not sure if it's part of their \"thing\" but on both occasions I felt a little forgotten and both ordering and actually receiving food seemed slow. I ordered very similar food items on both visits - chips & guacamole/salsa, and an assortment of tacos. Both times I really enjoyed their chips (very crispy and salty) and the house-made guacamoles and salsas, particularly the lump crab guac and the roasted tomato salsa. All tasted very fresh and flavorful. On my first visit, the tacos I ordered, while good, I found needing a bit more salt and maybe a squeeze of lime - simple fixes that they seemed to have gotten right, because the tacos I ordered on my recent visit were perfectly seasoned and satisfying. A great selection of beers, both on tap and bottled, as well as tequilas (if that's your thing; it's not mine). Their cocktails look great too, although I'm yet to try one (I did try a friend's Michelada, which was delicious). Decent prices, but you'll need a few tacos to fill you up, since they are \"street-style.\" Even better happy hour prices, which runs weekdays 4-6 and Monday all day, as well as $2 tacos on Tuesdays.

And though Pig and Finch Omaha still doesn't hold a candle to the Yelp reviews of its' Kansas City counterpart, I would happily visit again."], ["Justin S.", "I had the BALT (the A is for avocado). The bacon was thick and there was lots of it. \u00a0While the sandwich was delicious, the crispy bread was soaked with grease. I wiped my hands on my napkin after every single bite. The fries had lots of flavor, but were a little soft.I'll probably go back, as everything looked and tasted amazing. But I can't get past that greasy toast."], ["Chad K.", "I stopped in here for lunch on a Thursday in July.The restaurant is located in the One Pacific Place retail area in the unit that Ruby Tuesday occupied forever. \u00a0From what I gather, and as of the time I write this review, it's been open for a little over a year. \u00a0One Pacific Place is close to I-680 which means you can zip into it from almost anywhere in the metro area in a reasonable amount of time.When I first walked in I was sort of left standing at the hostess station with no host/hostess to be seen. \u00a0After an awkward minute or two a lady appeared and sat me. \u00a0I'd find out later that the hostess likes to spend her time over at the bar chit-chatting with the wait staff. \u00a0She was nice enough, but needs to be a little more attentive.I was greeted promptly by my waitress and she immediately took my drink order and quickly delivered them. \u00a0They weren't especially busy (50% of capacity perhaps). \u00a0They have good fresh-brewed iced tea that they server in Mason jars (Ball jars actually, but who calls them that?). \u00a0They have an okay selection of craft beer, but for a place that calls itself a gastropub I expect a lot better selection of craft beer (especially on draft). \u00a0They should go take note of the selection Blatt Beer & Table has. Waitress was friendly and attentive. \u00a0I sat at a booth in the bar area, so my waitress was also the bartender.I ordered the Brian's Burger.It's a burger (they grind the meat themselves using chuck and brisket) with blue cheese, bourbon pickled jalape\u00f1os, bacon marmalade, and roasted garlic mayo on a brioche bun. It was served with fries (they call them \"Finch Fries\"). \u00a0I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked and I failed to specify it myself. \u00a0I was served a medium-well patty, but despite its doneness was still juicy. I did ask for the roasted garlic mayo on the side as I think restaurants tend to over-do the mayo. \u00a0The burger was good, but not great. \u00a0It felt like it was missing something. \u00a0Then, on about the 4th bite I got some jalape\u00f1os in the bite and the heat they provided brought it all together. \u00a0It seems they just didn't do a decent job of evenly distributing the toppings on my burger. \u00a0I think if they switch from jalape\u00f1o slices to finely dicing the jalape\u00f1os that they'd get a more uniform coverage. \u00a0Overall, a good burger, but the execution was off. \u00a0I ordered the fries \"extra crispy.\" They complied (you'd be surprised how many restaurants ignore that request and serve then the standard way) and they served me some pretty tasty fries.Restaurant is nice inside as you'd expect a West Omaha gastropub to be. \u00a0Upscale but casual.Overall, a good gastropub. \u00a0It's got One Pacific Place pricing, so you're going to pay $15 for a hamburger. \u00a0Twisted Fork is over just a few blocks and I feel they have superior food at a slightly better price point. \u00a0Still, Pig & Finch is a solid choice and worth checking out."], ["Natalie E.", "Back for another visit and I'm afraid to report a poorer experience. The food, which only disappointed my husband last time, fell short for both of us. My $30 lamb dish was the low point of the meal: the lamb was stringy, the potatoes were still hard, and even when I asked for softer potatoes, they came back from the kitchen still too hard to enjoy. The eggplant parmigiana could have been from anywhere. The inside was quite mushy and the outside wasn't crispy. It missed the mark. The house made tater tots were nothing special, just fried hash browns. I discernible seasoning. The high point of the meal was my side salad (quite tasty!). It looks like they haven't fixed their service problem. Our server just didn't seem very genuine and came off almost pretentious. She didn't know the answers to our questions about the menu, and made me feel silly for asking. It didn't make me want to stay there very long, or come back for a third visit. I'm bummed. I really wanted to love this place. The decor is great and it's in a good location."], ["Scott N.", "This place is very close to my hotel so I had to give it a try.The server was very attentive and informative. The menu had so many options. I'm not sure why the Short Rib Ragout Grilled Cheese captured my attention, but it did! Short ribs on a sandwich with bunches of cheese and tomato soup. Talk about comfort food!Well, it was definitely good, but grilled cheese it was not. The short ribs are the star of the dish and calling it a grilled cheese is a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The waiter told me I would need a knife and fork for the sandwich. He was right. That made it difficult to... I don't know, dip the grilled cheese sandwich in the tomato soup. Isn't that what one is supposed to do with grilled cheese and tomato soup? Well, this is a very, very fancy grilled cheese and as I mentioned it isn't really a grilled cheese at all, so dripping in tomato soup... not going to happen.Maybe it's because it's served with tomato soup that I expected more of a traditional grilled cheese. In a way it's misleading.But if you know what you're going to get... a very delicious short rib served on toasted bread with some cheese (really, the cheese was hard to locate) with a side of tasty tomato soup, then you won't be surprised and you'll enjoy this delicious concoction. Don't get me wrong (I find myself adding this statement a lot because restaurants are getting savvy and responding to Yelp reviews!), this dish was delicious and quite frankly I'd order it again. I truly believe, however, renaming the dish would make it less of a surprise and more delectable for customers."], ["Eileen C.", "A-OK 3.5 stars. I really wanted to like this place as it looked nice on the outside and inside, with classier but modern inside decor. It felt comfy, the place mats and utensil settings in front of you are nicely set. The service was pretty good- constant refilling of water glasses and a welcoming attitude.The food though, just didn't scream anything special to me. It left me wanting more of a flavor out of the dishes. I had the short rib grilled cheese and tomato soup plus tried the side of short rib Mac and cheese. I would say the Mac and cheese was the best thing there. The grilled cheese was very hearty but didn't wow me. No strong flavors there and the tomato soup was probably similar to a marinara sauce from the jar. Others in my party got the wild sausage sandwich. They said the toppings on the sausage sandwich were better than the sausage.. Didn't have enough fat in the sausage."], ["Megan H.", "The menu is outstanding --- but the execution leaves something to be desired. After being throughly impressed by the menu, we went to Pig & Finch and ordered a tapas-style dinner of their appetizers: the pork belly with lentils, egg, and balsamic reduction, the roasted bone marrow with toast points, capers, parsley, and lemon, and their charcuterie. The meal was disappointing but not without potential. The high points were the entirety of the bone marrow dish, the chorizo and gouda on the charcuterie plate, and the charcuterie plate's selection of local honey and pickled vegetables (like the bourbon pickled jalape\u00f1os).The low points were only so low because of the lack of seasoning. The lentils and balsamic reduction could have been a wonderful part of the pork belly dish if there was simply more flavor. Even just salt! And some of the selections on the charcuterie board were just bland...the terrine tasted more like plain ground turkey than anything spectacular. Perhaps it was a bad night, but the lack of flavor with food that looks and sounds like it'd be great makes for a big letdown. Pig & Finch's charcuterie just can't compare with The French Bulldog and their small plates just pale in comparison to those at La Buvette. I can't justify spending the money on food that lacks simple seasoning. It could be great, but it isn't there. Small improvements could make a world of difference!"], ["Rachel P.", "I stopped at Pig and Finch while passing through Omaha and am glad that I chose it for my pit stop. \u00a0I had the Salmon Crepes and found them to be the perfect lunch portion. \u00a0The lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche and the balsamic reduction was the perfect touch to the meal and it is served with a healthy portion of mixed greens on top. \u00a0I was especially impressed by the service. \u00a0My server was Rachael and she was attentive during the meal, as expected. \u00a0What stood out though was her service AFTER the meal. \u00a0After I had paid by credit card and she had brought it back for me to sign I briefly remained in the booth jotting down a to-do list. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised when she without saying a word switched out my empty glass of iced tea with a full one. \u00a0I know it was a small thing but that fact that after the meal was over and I had already paid she did not make me feel hurried but instead brought me a refill really stood out. \u00a0One tip: If you don't have a flashlight app on your cell phone, download one before heading to the bathroom here. \u00a0Seriously, the ladies room was super dark. \u00a0To add to the lack of lighting, the walls are black tile and the counters are black stone as well, making it a rather dark experience."], ["Steve W.", "My wife and I came to try the Sunday brunch for the first time. We sat outside to take advantage of the perfect weather.She had the Banana's Foster french toast and I had the Pub Breakfast.The french toast was recommended and it lived up to it. \u00a0Very good.The Pub breakfast is a more traditional dish with eggs, toast, 2 strips of bacon and potatos.It was very good as well."], ["theresa s.", "Lovely last meal in Omaha. Service was spectacular and the food showcased local farm to table items. We really liked the chicharrones (who knew this could be so elegantly served in a restaurant?). Lightly sprinkled with a flavorful Cajun spice, a squeeze of lime elevated the dish. We also ordered bone marrow, tater tots, mussels,and their fried chicken special. I got the happy hour \"pig\" martini which was basically a dirty martini infused with bacon and garnished with a blue cheese olive. Everything we had was prepared and presented beautifully. Delicious!"], ["Julie P.", "Grilled oysters were delicious and cooked to perfection..we again had the charcuterie board tonight which was a bit disappointing due to the bland cheeses excluding the delicious gouda. Service was impeccable as usual. We had a side of Brussels sprouts the addition of apples was an interesting combination."], ["Niccole M.", "Pig and Finch continues to be my most favorite restaurant in Omaha. Excellent service, amazing food, and lovely drinks."], ["Levinia T.", "I recommend the pig & finch to those with a palette of exploration. I was skeptical after reading the reviews, but I HAD to try this farm-to-table restaurant after reading the menu online. I was definitely impressed! I went with a couple friends, so I was able to try a plethora of items on the menu. To start with, Jacob was our server and he was AWESOME! I couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat, and honestly I am not quite sure Jacob helped when he explained all of the items on the menu in detail. Needless to say, the time eventually came where I had to decide, and I picked two starters (keep in mind, I did NOT finish them all). I ordered the charcuterie platter and roasted bone marrow. The platter included salmon in duck fat, duck/pork sausage, fennel sausage, smokes gouda, fig jam, local honey, and pickled veggies served with toasted bread. Every part of that cutting board was heavenly. Next came the bone marrow...I was in heaven as I put that buttery marrow on a toasted piece of bread. The marrow was served with a side of fried capers and fresh parsley, but honestly it was amazing by itself. My friends ordered the Fig, Brie, and Prosciutto flat bread and it was cooked to perfection. They also got the french onion soup, which is apparently very popular according to Jacob. The soup was very good according to my friend. Moving onto the main course (you know this is serious when I make more paragraphs for a review). I ordered the special for the day (Thursday), which was veal meatloaf topped with a bacon marmalade and served on a bed of mashed potatoes and ratatouille. I imagined that seen from ratatouille where the food critic tasted the dish and immediately went back into his childhood. Now while my family did not make meals to this level of intricacy, \u00a0the meal itself took me back to comfort food. Every bite was perfect. My friend got the browned butter creamy potato gnocchi. While the first few bites weren't that great, it got a lot better as she mixed the sauce from the bottom of the dish onto the gnocchi. It was then that she was able to taste the creamy mushroom sauce and brussel sprout leaves.We all ordered dessert, and unfortunately they were nothing too extravagant. I hadn't eaten all of my meal, but I always save room for dessert. I ordered the lemon trio, and it was just ok. This gastropub is perfect for a group of people, singles, or couples who are interested in trying different/fun foods while supporting local vendors."], ["Jennifer P.", "Every time I come here food and service is top notch. I have brought friends and family here many times and they have all been impressed with the ambiance, decor, quality of food, and friendly servers. This time we were here for their great happy hour which runs every day from 3:30-6:00p (2:00-6:00 Sat and Sun). They have $6 wines by the glass and other cocktails. They also have half price ($3) appetizers which is a steal. We had their maytag blue cheese potatoe chips which are one of my must haves anytime I go. For dinner we shared one of their sides, the potato gnocchi with bacon and peas. Delicious! It just melts in your mouth. We also shared the B.L.A.T. \u00a0and added a fried egg of course. The bacon is thick and crispy and served on yummy La Quartier bread with lettuce and avocado. Believe me this is not an easy sandwich to eat, and it is so messy but so completely worth it!! It also comes with green beans, pickled red onions, roasted tomatoes, and fries on the side."], ["Cheryl K.", "Nice gastropub - beautiful bar area. Started off with a craft martini - the Finch. It was made with basil infused vodka, fresh lemons - QUITE delicious. The bartenders were SO friendly and accommodating. We then sat for dinner and started with pretzel bites, homemade tater tots and pork belly served over lentils with a poached egg (my personal favorite).For dinner I had mahi with pineapple coulis and quinoa/kale saut\u00e9. Mahi a little dry and the kale sautee over garlicky - I think next time I'll try more casual fare like a sandwich or burger.Our server was excellent.Will be back next time in Omaha"], ["Moira R.", "This place has been on my \"restaurant bucket list\" for a while. It has gotten mixed review on Yelp, but everyone I have talked to who has been here in person has loved it, so when my friend and I were trying to decide on a happy hour location last Friday, I suggested Pig & Finch. Their happy hour goes until 6 pm, and it was 5:45 pm when we arrived. It looked crowded but we decided to try our luck and just order off the regular menu if need be. When I walked in, I saw a few seats at the bar, so I decided to bypass the hostess stand and headed straight there. Upon sitting at the bar, the bartender said hello and then I was promptly ignored for about 10 minutes (no menu, no \"I'll be right with you,\" no nothing). Luckily our visit was uphill from there. Since I didn't have a menu, I pulled up their happy hour menu on my phone and when the bartender finally made it over, I ordered a couple drinks and food items from their pub menu (which is $3 during happy hour). I went with a glass of the chardonnay for my friend ($6 during happy hour) and the Finch martini for me (also $6 during happy hour). For food I ordered the pretzel bites (served with stone ground mustard and ale cheese sauce) and the bread and butter pickle chips (served with buttermilk ranch). When my friend arrived, the bartender brought over glasses of water for us and she also ordered the maytag blue cheese potato chips. It ended up that the pub menu online was out of date and the pickle chips weren't included on happy hour, but they were still only $6 and totally worth the cost.To start with, my martini was fantastic. I don't remember what is in it, but I would compare it to a slightly sweeter version of a French 75. It was very light and refreshing with just a hint of sweetness. The food came out In record time (maybe 5 minutes) and was all piping hot, fresh, and incredibly delicious. The pretzel bites were fluffy with a rich flavor, and the cheese ale sauce was delicious (the mustard was sort of meh). The pickle chips were some of the best I've ever had, and the blue cheese potato chips were also incredible. We easily cleaned all three plates. Our plates were quickly cleared and the bartender and food runners made friendly small talk with us while we were there. It took a little while to get our tab and pay (maybe 10 minutes) but they were pretty busy at this point so it was understandable. We were eventually given a full menu, which we looked over and agreed that we wanted to try about 80% of the menu. There are a lot of places that I am content going to as just a happy hour spot, but this isn't one of them. The prices are on the high side for Omaha, but the food looks very good and worth the price. I will be back here for dinner at some point, but in the mean time I was very satisfied with my happy hour experience. I would highly recommend giving Pig & Finch a try."], ["Mike S.", "Happy hour is a good deal. We came in tonight to get a little bit before going in TJ's and the location is fine with me. \u00a0This spot of town has always had a bunch of different business occupying here. They seem to last about two years. I hope P&F can last because they have some things going for them. Trying to cozy up to the bar was an arduous task as it seemed that every stool was jammed edge to edge and it was like those logic puzzles you did when you were a kid and had to arrange the tiles to form a picture. The pretzel bites are pretty good and presented well. Happy hour prices make them $3 and that is what you get. \u00a0Tastewise, I cannot review an entire menu based on one item, but everything they do looks similar. A little plank with food arranged artfully. If you like bacon then you are in hog heaven. Actually hog hell. It is really hipster and for me, overly pretentious. Bowties & Beards would be a more suitable name for this spot. In the first five minutes of my visit I knew more about our server than they knew of us. \u00a0In hospitality you usually try to encourage the guest to share by using open questions and creating rapport. \u00a0In all fairness he knew his wine and that was helpful to get the right one. \u00a0I know my beers and the tap selection was dismal. \u00a0Please don't try to talk Stella up to me. It is garbage. \u00a0I know what I wanted and it was only in bottles, but again I wasn't here for the experience, rather for the convenience."], ["Kevin Q.", "I came here for lunch after being intrigued by the name and exterior after driving by it. I was immediately impressed by the ambiance. Pig & Finch has a classy upscale look that it shares with many wine bars. I liked how on the menu they had a little definition for gastropub. There was also this neat mural on the wall of a bunch of different animals (think cows, fish, pigs, the ones you eat) sitting together at a table.As for the food however, I was a bit disappointing. My party of three split the short rib mac and cheese, which I thought was simply alright. Everyone else seemed to really like it though. I also got the wild boar sandwich for the main course. Although I liked the brussel sprouts and the fries, I thought that the sausage itself was pretty average. I'm guessing that they don't put much fat into it, because the texture of the meat didn't feel very sausage-like. However, the fries were nice and crispy and the pretzel bun was actually quite delicious. The highlight of the meal was the accompanying vanilla bean beer from Infusion. I got it because it sounded strange on the menu and to my surprise it ended being quite good. This beer is pretty light and actually has a cool, sweet, vanilla bean aftertaste that lingers a bit in your mouth after each sip."], ["Paul C.", "Great location, nice decor and an AMAZING brunch. \u00a0We shared the fried donut holes with lemon curd and raspberry whipped cream and were VERY happy with the selection. \u00a0We also both had the Bananas Foster French Toast - the waitress asked if we were splitting that as well; should have taken her advice. \u00a0Perfectly cooked brioche french toast, a wonder rum sauce with banana slices and a Chantilly cream that was completely on point \u00a0The portion was HUGE though and this will definitely be a \"split meal\" next time. We saw the pancakes come out and thought the same thing about that dish but it definitely looked good. \u00a0Also of note, the prices were very reasonable for a brunch and for the quality of food. If nothing else, brunch will be on the agenda again but we need to check out lunch or dinner some time."], ["Nel P.", "Went here on a Friday for lunch. The place was busy a little busy. Upscale look and very nice atmosphere thats complementary to the Regency area. We ordered the:* Shrimp and Feta flatbread--liked it* Lamb burger--was good* and the B.L.A.T. Sandwich--really good!Their fries were a little too greasy for our taste. They also have a nice wine and cocktail selections. We didn't get a chance to sample any of them as well as their selections of beer. \u00a0Maybe next time. We'll definitely be back."], ["Alana W.", "We had been looking for an excuse to try this out, so we took my mother-in-law here during her visit. We did have a Groupon, which was good, because I wasn't expecting it to be so expensive. At least the food was good, the decor was charming, and our waiter was wonderful. It was happy hour so we got the bacon marmalade special for three or four dollars. It was AMAZING. I was intrigued by the pickle martini. I love pickles and could drink pickle juice out of the jar, so I thought I might like it. Unfortunately they don't tell you that they make it with bread and butter pickles and it tastes mostly like straight vodka anyway. Our waiter was great and offered to bring me something else. I got the Hillbilly sangria which was much better and served in (what else) a mason jar. I got the pork belly, which is usually an appetizer, because I just can't resist pork belly on a menu and I didn't want to pay $15 for an appetizer. \u00a0It was good, but I'm not sure the lentils were the best combination. It seemed like it needed something lighter or tangier to contrast with the heavy lentils and pork belly. My husband got the lamb burger, which he loved. The winner was my MIL's espresso-rubbed pork shoulder; I wanted to eat the whole thing!Overall, the food was good but definitely overpriced, although I appreciate the whole local food thing they're going for. Not sure I'd come here without a Groupon."], ["Kaite S.", "Omaha needs more restaurants like the Pig & Finch. Simply put, they know classic American comfort food and do it well! The liberties they take with the classics are a welcome twist."], ["Happy D.", "food here is excellent. the service is great. kid friendly. there is great selection and really has nice gastropub menu. brunch is great as well. try their \"spicy\" Bloody Mary."], ["Jon N.", "We've had the opportunity to go here a few times now. Lucky enough once to make it right at the end of happy hour, which includes select $3 appetizers.For those that enjoy BLT's, the $13 is worth it. It is one of the best BLT that you'll have, especially if you're a fan of avocado. When you add the egg, it's makes it even better. I had to tell myself to not order this so I could try something different on the menu. But this is by far a great dish, coupled with a fair portion of fries, and a salad that you don't expect.Being affiliated with the 801 family, service does not skip a beat. The staff there is very accommodating, especially when we brought our three year-old daughter with us for a group dinner.This is definitely a spot to stop by and try, especially when there is a Groupon.

I feel like there were finch fries (5) in there somewhere, but can't recall...hmmmm.While the beverages can be on the pricey side (ugh...$14 cocktail without the strong zing of booze, really?!), the food prices aren't overly shocking since it's part of that whole 801 family, so somewhat expected. Wins include the mac'n'cheese (creamy and fatty, with chunks of meaty goodness) and brussels sprouts (I heart me some sprouts sprinkled with bacon). For breakfast, they do a real nice poached egg that will blanket that thick slice o' bacon and thick slab o' sausage in egg-gravy when pierced with your fork.

The flatbread left much to be desired. The pork was prepared as large meatballs and the crust was cracker thin- those are both losses in my book. But the mac... oh. the. glorious. mac.It brought me back a couple weeks later because I hadn't stopped thinking about it. The short ribs are so tender that they do not interrupt the creaminess of the mac at all. This mac-n-cheese is my new favorite in the city. I do have to add salt, unlike at Wilson & Washburn which is seasoned better, but this mac is still edging W&W out by the tiniest of margins. It's hearty, and probably the absolute best bang for your buck at P&F since it's sold as a side.I also had the bacon jam. It's pretty darn good. Not something I'd eat all the time, but I'd definitely order it again to share, and you can't beat the happy hour price.In terms of service, I've not had a problem at all.

The execution however...Eh.We didn't have reservations so we were seated at one of the tables in the middle of the restaurant on the left side, not the booths. I felt the space/tables were really cramped together. And there was more than one occassion that staff was moving in between our tables/behind us. I even got my chair kicked once by the hostess passing behind me who didn't know she had kicked my chair and proceeded to walk back to her podium at the front of the restaurant. What did you think you hit? An invisible decoration?Pretty chaotic environment made the experience not so good. I feel like they needed to train staff to walk around the periphery of the tables and not through them because it was really quite uncomfortable and claustraphobic. Whenever a server passed through it was very distracting as well as we had to make room for them! The table itself was also very small and we had to really be clever with how we placed our drinks.For my food, I got the griddled B.L.A.T. which in itself tasted fine, the bacon was nice and thick, and they gave a generous serving. However it was very hard to eat with your hands as the bread was pretty soaked through with oil, all the ingredients kept falling out. Messy! The fries though were pretty bad. They were soggy and overly salted. In order to get all of our table's entrees out at the same time for my table of 4 (which I appreciate), my BLAT + fries and my friend's BLAT + fries were sitting at the warmers for quite a while, because from my table I could see that both of the BLAT's were on the warming counters sat for about 5-10 minutes before they were actually served to us. Usually what standard protocol for this at other restaurants is to make the fries as the other orders are almost ready to go out, so that they arrive at the customers table fresh and crispy. As I stated earlier, the concept is there but the execution needs more work. I get that it is a new place, so I am willing to give them another shot. 2.5/5 stars but I'll round up to 3."], ["Keith C.", "I've had a few good memories at this place--most notably back in May when I asked my father in laws permission for his daughters hand in marriage.

The batter was pretty weak, but they're fried pickles, so I'm going to eat them if they're on the table. The pate wasn't bad. It came in a mason jar with a apple the jam on top. I tasted more of the jam than liver. They probably soaked the livers too long. I enjoy a really strong livery pate that is bright and this was dull in color and in flavor. \u00a0The worst part of the dinner was the steak and frites. Talk about a rip off for over $30. Thin cut of NY strip with a weak attempt at a sear. Ordered med rare, but with that thin of cut it's almost certainly going to be overcooked."], ["Kayla K.", "Ate outside on patio .. It was a lot of fun .. And got away from noisy restaurant inside .. I had the chicken liver pate and mussel appetizers. The liver pate was really delicious ... It was prepared like a smooth mousse which I loved. The mussels were average with not much broth and had a sweet flavor more so than strong garlic wine flavor. I ordered the strawberry tarragon soda which was tasty and fun."], ["Josh B.", "For the most part a great place to go and relax. Only issue is that some of their food can be too rich.I do like the pretzels with their home made cheese sauce with stone ground mustard"], ["Karoline H.", "I came here for brunch on a Sunday and although it was simple the food was really good.We shared the donuts to start. I had toast, bacon, sausage, and breakfast potatoes.We asked the waitress to shake up some OJ with ice at the bar and she happily did so. I would love to come back and try the dinner!"], ["Christopher K.", "I continue to be amazed at the number of serious foodie restaurants I continue to encounter in Omaha. This city could seriously hold it's own to any big city boasting the best of the best restaurants. I never thought I would say this, but I am sincerely honored to call Omaha my home away from home. As with all my trips to Omaha, each work day always ends with a group of local colleagues eager to take me out for a night on the town to show off yet another great Nebraskan eatery. And despite all the good food I've been treated to since coming here, I still go into each new experience with a sense of skepticism. Case in point: tonight. The girls wanted to take me out to Block 16 in the Old Market, but strangely they're closed on Wednesday evenings. Pig & Finch would serve as backup. As an English major, I feel like there's a literary reference here in the name that I should know about, but alas I do not. (Perhaps I was out that day.) But it's a great name for a restaurant nonetheless, and as we all know, the cooler the name sounds, the more disappointed you're likely to be when you finally dine there.Having been dragged to the nearby Fox & Hound on more than one occasion, I was expecting a similar experience, akin to a TGI Fridays. (\"Fox & Hound,\" \"Pig & Finch\" - it's got to all be the same thing, right?) And upon pulling into a strip mall and seeing Pig & Finch anchoring the corner, I was pretty sure I'd be right.I was wrong.We sat outside on the \"patio,\" which couldn't have been a better call, what with the gorgeous 70something-degree, low-humidity weather. This is apparently unusual at this time of year in Omaha. Sitting in the shade with a cool breeze gently blowing down the sidewalk demanded that we all order fancy cocktails as our first order of business.Pig & Finch is yet another Omahan farm-to-table restaurant - Gastropub, to be exact - where fancy cocktails are among their specialty. Fancy herbs are plucked directly from an herb garden for each drink and dish made to order. I had a froufy gin martini of some kind, and it was delicious. The girls all ordered stiff mixed drinks served in large Bell mason jars. One round and everyone was feeling good.Appetizers came next. Unfortunately for me and my little Vegan/veggie experiment, there's not a whole lot of options to pick from. I did, however, greatly enjoy the pretzel bites. Large, fluffy, buttery nuggets, slightly undercooked on the inside (in a good way) and topped with salt, caraway, and poppy seeds. Served with a side of stone ground mustard and beer cheese, I had no choice but to go veggie over Vegan. The beer cheese was just too good to pass up.Next up was the charcuterie board, which was no joke. I don't know what was on this thing all, but it was a ton of meat - as in like, small loaves of meat, accompanied by slices of various cured meats (Prosciutto di Parma included), a variety of cheese, and a pile of pickled vegetables. I really did not dig into this except for a handful of pickled jalape\u00f1os, but the girls enjoyed it a lot. Four of them didn't even come close to finishing it, though. This dish is a monster.For entrees, two of the girls ordered the short rib ragout grilled cheese, which looked absolutely decadent. I resisted asking for a bite, but deep down I really wanted one. They loved it, even though they barely finished one half each. The finch fries looked good, too. One of the other girls in our party ordered the whole fish trout. Once she pointed away the scary, splayed-out head staring at me, and worked her way into the thin and juicy, succulent-looking trout flesh inside, I was once again able to look in her direction. I'm just not big fish guy unless it's sushi. (She, however, was thrilled with the dish.)As for me, well, I was lame. With all the booze we had over the course of the week, I stuck to my guns and ordered the Kale Caesar salad and a giant side of roasted Brussels sprouts. I know it's sacrilege to say, but the Vegan Quinoa salad I had the night before at Modern Love ran circles around this one. (I guess my tastebuds are changing, what can I say?) The roasted Brussels sprouts were very good, even though I ordered them sans bacon. My only complaint is that they described the dish as a \"hash\" and this was nothing even remotely close to a hash. Still, they were very good.And with all that food, we were pretty much ready to explode. The servings here at Pig & Finch are very large and the food, being a Gastropub and all, is very heavy and rich. This is the kind of place where you are better off sharing lots of things among your friends. If you are looking to avoid overstuffing yourself, the trout was said to be pretty light on a relative scale.I don't think I'd run back to Pig & Finch unless I was ready to dig back into a big, honkin' piece of meat. That seems to be the star of the show here. But as far as strip mall restaurants go, this place is definitely well above the average you might expect."], ["J L.", "I've been here several times... And every time I've been here, the food was outstanding. However, I only gave three stars because the service at this restaurant is subpar at best. Most recently, I made reservations for a friends birthday lunch... When we got there, we were told there were no reservations. The hostess made a big stink about seating us even though the restaurant was 50% empty. Our server seemed like she was hung over, and checked back with us maybe one time in the hour and a half we were there. Overall, if you want delicious Gastro pub food, this is the place to go... Just come with really low expectations about the service you will receive."], ["Terri W.", "The salmon in parchment paper and cast iron Idaho trout killed it!Excellent flavor so tasty!Broiled cauliflower and green beans \u00a0with the trout were the best.Potato gnocchi side also terrific."], ["Molly S.", "The chicken, spinach and artichoke flatbread is creamy and hearty. The parmesan crust pushes or over the edge for me. My daughter's grilled cheese was melty and perfect. I kept stealing bites."], ["Rustin L.", "I'm confused by the Yelp community's rating of Pig & Finch. I had seen it before on my exploration of places to eat in this city that's new to my family, but the lackluster stars warned me away. It was only after a more adventurous friend tried it out with great results, that I decided that we had to try it ourselves.Trying to get a reservation at the last minute didn't turn out so well, but the hostess was nice enough to offer to reserve a spot at the bar for us and \"if anything opened up, she'd move us over before we arrived.\" Well, nothing did and we ate on comfortable chairs at the packed bar. Again, if the place isn't that good, then why is it so busy?The service was prompt, although the bartender was obviously over worked with all the meal-eaters at his bar. We ate the charcuterie platter as an appetizer and it was FABULOUS! Great pairings for adventurous eaters, but not so much to scare them away. Our entrees were quick and delicious as well. We didn't do desert, but maybe next time. Again, I'll end as I began...I'm not sure why this isn't at the top of many people's choice places to eat in Omaha. It's better than any chain restaurant for sure!"], ["Anne F.", "Great menu. I had the trout. \u00a0Very good. \u00a0Donut hole dessert was wonderful. Ziggy Piggy Sunday with candied bacon looked good"], ["Ryan t.", "Every single time we host friends who are from out of town and take them out to dinner, they are routinely amazed at how affordable dining out is in Omaha. People from Omaha seldom appreciate this fact, and I think that's reflected in some of the reviews. I wonder if the same people complaining about a $6 appetizer only eat at the Golden Arches when they travel?At any rate, Pig and Finch has amazing food. I had the Espresso-rubbed pork shoulder, the wife had short-rib Mac and Cheese. Throw in a side of Brussels sprouts and a good beer selection , and we were happy. If you're the kind of person who agonizes about spending money on a good meal, there are no fewer than 15 Applebee's locations you can choose from. The food here is worth the price."], ["Tiffany G.", "I just happened to stumble upon this place and let me tell you....it is amazing! The wine selection is more than enough and the food is exquisite! The Hawaiian Ahi nachos are a perfect balance of flavor. I am beyond impressed and my server is as nice as can be. This is a hidden gem! Every time I'm in Omaha I am coming here!! Well done and keep up the good work!"], ["Rob R.", "Tried the blue cheese chips and fish tacos for lunch. The chips were a fantastic decadent treat with creamy blue cheese dressing and a few crumbles for good measure. \u00a0The fish tacos were well worth $12 with small corn tortillas stuffed with a mango salsa (they were out of their usual salsa), onions, red cabbage & guacamole. \u00a0 They came with a side of chips, which I would prefer be a bit thicker cut to scoop up tasty fish taco morsels dropped on my plate. Service was also well done. \u00a0Waitress started off on a typical lunch pace, but seamlessly slowed the service down once she realized we weren't in any hurry to get on with our day. She was friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. Well done."], ["Stacy K.", "My boss took me and three coworkers to Pig and Finch for a bonding experience. The food was incredible and very memorable, especially the short rib macaroni. I have since visited twice on my own and had exceptional food and service."], ["Jenn L.", "Great food, fresh and flavorful! Very nice specials on food and wine! Best part about our dinner though was our waiter as we were a bachelorette party coming from a day spent at wineries - so probably very obnoxious - and everyone was very kind and patient with us! Would definitely return!"], ["Katelyn E.", "Dang it... I wanted to like this place so badly! The outside looked so cute and I heard you can bring your dogs to the patio... instant points in my book. The inside of the restaurant was pretty cute too - they serve water in mason jars and they have lots of wine and pig d\u00e9cor. Our bow-tied waiter was friendly enough and could recommend his fav dishes.But ah... the food. It was just not great. I had high expectations for my order -- the Short Rib Ragout Grilled Cheese. It's a pulled pork sandwich, topped with gruyere and white cheddar. It came with a cup of tomato soup and some cold vegetables and pickles. \u00a0The portion was pretty big - I only ate half the sandwich and a couple sips of the soup. The sandwich was okay, but super, super buttery and oily... lots of napkins were used. To give you an idea of the over butter usage... I brought home the other half and when I pulled it out the next day, it was like a brick stuck together. It was so hard I couldn't even open up the sandwich to microwave it. I ended up throwing it out. :(My other minor gripe was the food items were all pretty pricey. Totally fine if you're walking in for dinner and expecting that, but for lunch? And they didn't have a lunch menu. I think a burger was around $16. Again, not the worst thing, but just caught me by surprise. Pig & Finch is part of the 801 Restaurant \"group\" and while I am a fan of 801 Chophouse downtown, I probably won't venture in here again."], ["Wendy C.", "I love this place. Their Brussels sprout dish is my favorite item it is savory and delicious."], ["Adrian W.", "First things first, I will probably go back here at least once just to eat the Espresso rubbed pork shoulder again. I'm not the biggest fan of the 801 Chophouse when it comes to food so I wasn't sure what to think about Pig going in. Server was friendly and attentive. Ran us through the menu extensively. \u00a0The pork belly appetizer and the roasted cauliflower soup were excellent starters. The aforementioned pork shoulder and the lamb shank were also good and almost worth the $22 and $25 respectively. About 9 oz of meat each and the cheddar polenta with the lamb should have its own side dish. Speaking of sides. We opted for the short rib Mac n Cheese. Bland. Not only from the short rib which I thought would punch the dish up but the pasta and cheese lacked flavor as well. I would not recommend. I only gave this 3 stars even though the meals were tasty because it seems like it's a bit on the pricy side for what you get."], ["Salina Y.", "Came in for lunch today with my husband. The hostess greeted us and sat us right away! Our server came right over and got us started with drinks. We started off with the grilled oysters. We had asked how many came with the order and she wasn't sure but believed that it was 4 per order. We were glad that it was actually 5 oysters!! They had great flavor but pretty gritty... It would have been nice to have small cocktail forks because it was tough eating them with big dinner forks. Then we waited for our entrees, and waited and waited. It took quite some time for our meals. He had French dip with sprouts and I had the patty melt with fries. His meal was good but a little fatty. The brussel sprouts were a little under cooked but flavorful. My patty melt was over cooked and dry. I would have gotten another one but our server never came back to check on us until my husband was already done eating. The GM did take it off and apologized which was nice, but overall so very underwhelming from service and food quality. Not worth a 50 dollar lunch. Probably won't be back for a LONG time."], ["Mike W.", "Well I was presently surprised with this place. I had read several reviews that made me hesitant but, I was quickly proven wrong. The bacon marmalade was very good and enjoyed by all at our table. My main dish was the lamb burger and they were happy to swap the fries out for the cauliflower which was seasoned fantastically. The burger and side greek salad were fantastic! they had great flavor and were a good portion size so I didn't feel like I ate the whole animal after the meal.The other meals we had were the pork belly and the pork shoulder and both had wonderful flavor. The seasoning for each complemented each dish very well. The plate presentation was very well done and our server was very helpful. They had no issue make substitutions on the meal or the beverages we ordered which is always a much appreciated trait.My one negative would be the price. The dishes are much more expensive than what you would maybe expect for a gastropub. Still, for the occasional outing, I would recommend this, but the price keeps if from been a weekly experience."], ["Katrina F.", "Really liked the brisket Mac and cheese. \u00a0Pretzel bites were also yummy. \u00a0Not a fan of the Brussel sprouts and chorizo flatbread -- needs more chorizo and less sprouts. \u00a0Mexican chorizo would make it better rather than the Spanish style used."], ["Amy F.", "Went here for lunch and loved it! Again surprised by some of the reviews I saw, not sure why so many people are low balling this place. Our service wasn't out of this world or anything, but it was friendly and fairly quick for the time of day we were eating. No drinks or apps, but both lunch entrees we had were wonderful. No leftovers! (which I know better than to clean my plate like that, but it was so good I couldn't help myself) I just LOVED the tomato soup, it was the right amount of chunky, with just the right tang, and the balsamic reduction definitely gave it some zip! The pickles were crisp and crunchy, the green beans were cooked perfectly-not soggy at all. The decor inside is artsy and fun! Loved the ambiance. Would love to return and try the dinner menu in the future."], ["Suzy W.", "I agree with the other reviewers:I really wanted to love this place but it fell short. I certainly appreciate that most items are made in house with locally sourced ingredients and that it is locally owned. I understand that it drives up prices. But our party found the prices too high and the service to be pretentious. I mean, a BLT with fries for $14? I wish I would've had a groupon!I have eaten in many fine restaurants across the country with very friendly service, and I don't need to come back to Omaha and be talked down to by the wait staff.Now on to the food. The high point was the charcuterie board. There was a nice selection of meats, but only one cheese. My sister ordered the butter lettuce salad, but the dressing was so acidic that she couldn't finish it. I ordered the salad with chicken, which was acceptable but nothing extraordinary. My father loved the espresso rubbed pork.Another high point was the atmosphere and the beautiful hue of purple on the wall with the wine bottle chandelier and the view of the kitchen.I don't plan on returning anytime soon, maybe during Happy Hour when the prices are more reasonable."], ["Cam V.", "I was so excited to eat at this place for the first time. The name was interesting, the concept is one I love (farm to table), and the decor was inviting.We went here on a Monday night with some friends and we were all newbies. Our server was kind, prompt, and attentive. I wouldn't say she was amazing, but we've certainly had worse. We all started with drinks, which they have an impressive beer selection if that's your thing. For apps, we ordered the pretzels and our friends ordered the fried pickles. I personally felt for paying $6 that 5 pretzels the size of my thumb was a ripoff...considering how cheap pretzels cost to make. The fried pickles were good, but then again, anything fried hardly tastes bad.When it came to ordering entrees, my husband ordered the burger/fries, I ordered the Monday special (short ribs, carrots, brussel sprout leaves, and cauliflower mash). The food was amazing....except one problem, it literally was like a 4 oz piece of meat (comprised about 20-30% of fat) and then enough sides that I could eat them in 4 bites. Oh, and it was a $24 dish. I have a problem with that. When I pay $24 at a non-5 star restaurant, I expect to leave full. The portions were so painfully small I considered ordering a burger for dessert, true story. My husband said while the burger was good, it was nothing to write home about. B16 has a $5 burger that is a lot better, both in flavor and price.So in summary, the food was good, portions were small, value was severely lacking, beer selection was good, service was perfectly average.Note: I did notice that after we paid the server seemed to come to our table less. In fact, we all had empty water glasses by the time we left at 8pm so maybe it's normal for them to give up on service after they got paid?Anyways, it's hard to say if we'd be back!"], ["Sarina P.", "This is the third time posting this review on here...I've also noticed the amount of negative feedback on this place has disappeared. I didn't realize Yelp could delete people's posts but apparently it has. Makes me quite suspicious. Anyway, I do have a life but I also take my food seriously and want anyone and everyone to know to STAY AWAY from this place. There are so many better restaurants!!Rude & incompetent wait staff.For saying they're serious about their food, their food isn't serious.Below average, lukewarm and burned food.To be honest, HyVee serves better food than these folks and doesn't makeyou take out a second mortgage on your home when taking out of town guests.Stick to the local places around that area like Wheatfields, Andres, Twisted Cork,Jaipur, Taste, Runza. McDonald's (haha)...If you are looking for this type of atmosphere places like Block 16, Wilson & Washburn, and The Blatt are highly recommended. Just go anywhere but here, please!First, I went here over lunch because a coworker had a groupon - which onlycovered her meal. Yes, a groupon worth $20, at lunchtime, covered HER mealalone! So, you're paying quite a bit of money, first off. (But, that's morethe icing on the cake than the actual problems this restaurant has, orshould I say had? It won't be around long at all in this cut throat Omahamarket at this rate.)The side dishes, I was told, were actually quite large and able to sharewith the family so while I was eyeing the pork mac n' cheese, I decided togo for it. It was a great deal - $8 for a full meal.Fast forward a week and it's Mother's Day. Relatives are in town. One ofthem is vegan. I tell her the one downside of the place is that it's NOISY- even with 10 people there - it was NOISY!1) falsely advertised the food. 2) waitress didn't know what the limited menu represented. Keep in mind this was weeks after opening so how is the consumer, likely a first time, suppose to know?!3) server had no idea what vegan meant and wouldn't ask the cook on our behalf if anything was vegan friendly. 4) everyone's dish had something wrong with it. Burnt, overlooked, undercooked, ridiculously small portion on the fruit and was all fruit the person didn't like (waitress misrepresented it). 5) coffee is atrocious. 6) we had to get up and beg for service and even after that, still had to wait. And wait every time we needed something including the check. 7) I wouldn't even recommend my worst enemy to this place.I don't say this often but even after approaching management with my concerns, politely, they could care less. So, I hope there fail and close their doors ASAP. No one needs to waste their time and money on this horrid excuse for a restaurant."], ["Emily C.", "We heard about this place via groupon & decided to try. Great food & great service! It's not a cheap date, but I'd say it's worth it! Very clean place & unique atmosphere. Pretzel bites are so good! Loved the pork shoulder over sweet potatoes & kale. It's definitely worth trying!"], ["Russ L.", "Loved everything about this place. The beer selection was awesome and the food was outstanding. Started off sharing the short rib Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. I know it's a side but we just had to try it and we were certainly not disappointed. For my meal I had the pork shoulder dish and it was phenomenal. The pork was incredibly tender and ripped from a fork and gravity. The flavors were so deliciously sweet that they made the carrots taste good (I don't like carrots often). Definitely happy to add The Pig and Finch to our list of date night restaurants."], ["Gabriel P.", "I'm a little torn on whether to give P&F 4 or 5 stars, but I'm going to go ahead and say 5 just on the strength of their amazing dinner salads. The food in general is excellent, with interesting and high quality ingredients prepared well. I've barely started into the menu but I'm eager to explore more of it, because almost everything looks amazing and what I've had so far definitely delivered. Service has been good every time we've visited, with knowledgeable and attentive servers. Maybe they're not the smiliest people in the world, but honestly I consider that more of a plus than a minus.Prices are... ehh. The first time I went I thought they were a little overpriced, but I think they might have come down a little bit. Either that or I just think it's worth more after I've sampled a bit more of the menu. It's not cheap but it's not outrageous, either, and you definitely get what you pay for.The only thing I'd really ding them on is the atmosphere, which is sad because the place actually looks great--the problem is that it's way too crowded, so it gets noisy and feels pretty cramped."], ["Jenny N.", "With an awesome name like Pig and Finch, how could it not be good? Turned out to be just OK. I'm not sure I will go back, but is it fair to judge a restaurant on just 1 dish? Maybe not-- but what I had was a pork dish, and if you're going to put the word \"pig\" in your name, you better make good pig.I arrived in the early afternoon, just after the lunch hour. Looking inside, the restaurant looked really nice-- a \"gastropub\" look and feel, indeed. I decided to sit outside because it was dead inside.They said they ran out of the duck cassoulet. I was disappointed and surprised-- it was a week day and only after lunch. So I ended up ordering the expresso-rubbed pork shoulder instead. The expresso worked, but I didn't like the dish as a whole. It was served with a sweet potato hash seasoned with an apple maple glaze that was sickeningly sweet. The pork was tender, but was so so over salted, and too sweet. There was no acidity to balance and the whole dish just didn't work. It was expensive and I left feeling underwhelmed-- and very thirsty."], ["Marcus S.", "The good service saves this review but I wouldn't come back here. The drinks were atrocious. I've never returned one but I was close. Be warned: the \"pig\" is not a martini, it is pure olive juice and maybe bacon grease. All drinks were small and overpriced This place is fairly expensive and pretentious. It's the kind of place where they bring 3 bites of appetizer out on a big wood platter. The pork was pretty good but not worth the price tag. If you wanna spend an extra 5 bucks a plate for a hipster vibe this is your place but you've been warned"], ["Kae F.", "First time going.

Having never been to Pig & Finch, I suggested we give it a try for brunch. My mate had been there for lunch but never for brunch, so he was all in too.The atmosphere was nice, and the restaurant was clean. It was modestly busy but not loud and distracting. The staff was very friendly, willing to make helpful suggestions. I ordered the Infusion vanilla beer on tap, and was happy enough with that, especially given I'm not a big beer drinker (I prefer vodka). I also had a mimosa which was well balanced, but I did find it interesting that my mimosa was served in a smaller glass that 2 other patrons seated in booths (i was sitting at the bar).I order the croque monsieur for my meal (as did my pal). Holy hell was it delicious! The portion size was rather large, but given the pleasure this meal brought to my palate, I didn't need a doggie bag. The sunny side egg on top, the perfectly cut bread, the gooey cheese, the delectable ham - there was nothing bad about this sandwich. And the side cup of fruit was a perfectly light compliment to the heart meal. My only criticism is none of the servers pronounced the name of the sandwich properly - truly not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but it was noticeable.

Everyone else's food came except his and we had to point it out to the waitress. His meal was comp'd but the staff should have noticed 5 plates going out instead of 6.

He was perfectly timed in each time he checked on our table and seem to have a great knowledge of the menu.

Everything came out hot and tasted fresh. Food was great!The low part of the experience were the servers and the whispering we heard.

It fell flat in both categories. The beer selection was fine but nothing exceptional. In fact I was kind of surprised to find Miller at the top of the list of beers on their menu. The food was also fine, but definitely not worth the price. In the end, perhaps the problem is one of misinterpretation: if they would just call it a \"bar and grill\" this would solve the problem of my expectation of high-quality drinks and food.

The decor is nice and the servers are friendly. The food is, in Yelp terms, A-OK. I have had several things on the menu, and they are all good, but I wouldn't say great (there's nothing to really set it apart from other restaurants). The French dip is definitely the best thing I've had, although they also have a good quiche. One thing I found amusing is that they once had a special listed on the board when I walked into the restaurant. Upon looking at the menu, I saw that it was listed at the same price as on the \"specials\" board. I asked the waitress what was so special about the special that was a regular menu item and was the same price as it always was.

Not stellar per se, but totally worth the trip.Personally, I prefer the downtown location. However, this location just seems nicer, the wait is never as long, and parking is easier.My favorite beer here will forever be the Raspberry Lager. This beer is exactly how fruity beer should be done. It's a subtle fruit flavor that doesn't overwhelm the beer. And always be sure to check out their seasonals. This winter, their Scarlet Silk Red Witbier is awesome. And for first-timers, get the sampler. You can't know what you will like here beer-wise without tasting it first. You just may be surprised by what you wind up loving.For food, there are several good options. Definitely get the artichoke dip. It's fantastic and one of the best artichoke dips I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The pizzas are good. The fish and chips are good. The soups are good. The mac 'n' cheese is awesome.

I called about 6 weeks in advance and spoke to one of the owners, Deke, who was very accommodating in getting our group scheduled. Normally when I plan larger events I have to follow up several times to make sure the arrangements have been made and confirmed and that no issues arise. However, I was contacted by a supervisor, Charlotte, about a week before the event, who confirmed all the details with me and even moved us to a private room. She even sent me an email confirming all the details in writing and promptly answered any questions I had.The day of, our private room was all ready for us the minute we arrived, and we had two servers dedicated to serving our group. The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly, even though our group was a little loud at times. The appetizers I preordered were ready upon our arrival and everything was hot and delicious. I tried a little of everything, and the Uncle Art (spinach and artichoke dip) and the bruschetta capris were my favorite. The servers made sure the night flowed well by gently prompting groups to get seated when it was time to order dinner. With larger groups, you often have to order off a limited menu, but Jackson Street Tavern gave us access to the full menu, which was greatly appreciated. They have a good selection of high end items, including steaks, lamb chops, and seafood items. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the Cavatelli Di Mare, which was fantastic (seafood is always a little questionable in Nebraska, but several members of our group acknowledged that the scallops here were excellent). Our group also ordered several desserts to try, and some of the favorites were the double chocolate-espresso brownie and the cr\u00e8me brulee. I would highly recommend Jackson Street Tavern if you are planning a party or even if you just want a nice meal with a smaller group.

Warm cheese on a 7 degree night. Mmm. Nothing really jumped out at me on the menu so I went with my stand by - veggie burger & sweet potato fries. It was great! The black bean burger the fries were prepared right & just the right portion so I didn't feel like Big Mama Jones rolling out of there. It might not be my first choice to return there should I ever be in that part of downtown Omaha, but if I did end up there again, It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

It's like stepping back in time for a family dinner. I met my husband and some friends here and before I arrived my husband sat at the bar and said the bartender was great. He gave him some suggestions of what to try for dinner and was very attentive and personable. Once we sat down the waitress gave us the specials and her recommendations also. We tried the bruschetta (bartender recommended) and pork belly as our appetizers. Both were great but the bruschetta was the best of the two and I'd also recommend it. Main courses we tried the Pollo chicken, veal, the shrimp pasta special, and the duck poutine. All were pretty great but the duck poutine was probably the best. It was a special so not sure how long they will have it. The serving size was more of an appetizer size plate compared to the rest of our entrees but it was the only plate that was empty at the end of dinner. Prices are average for Old Market area. They also had live jazz music the night we were there. Sometimes when these smaller establishments downtown have live music it can be loud and overwhelming, this was not the case.

My only critique of the salad is the use of iceberg in the greens blend. But it does add texture. So it is just me being a salad snob. lolI sat at the bar completely alone.

From beginning to end, we were impressed. \u00a0I made the reservation online in celebration of my husband's 30th birthday and made a note it was such an occasion. \u00a0As soon as we checked in they said Happy Birthday. When they seated us, there was a birthday card signed by the staff. \u00a0Our server, Celeste, was wonderful. \u00a0We are young, I didn't know why she was offering me a black napkin (she explained it without making me feel like an idiot), the menu is full of very expensive things that are hard to choose. Inexperience is a bitch and can be stressful but Celeste was patient, informative and just a doll. She was knowledgeable about everything I asked about which gets major props in my book. \u00a0I can never fully trust a waitress if she's never sampled the food! Others have mentioned this and I'll go ahead and agree, the place is dark and surprisingly loud. \u00a0I expected more formal dress but people were pretty relaxed for the most part. \u00a0It was a nice mix. I wore a dress, my husband nice jeans and we didn't feel out of place at all. \u00a0 \u00a0Ok, what we've all been waiting for. The food! \u00a0I need a lot more steak in my life to be any kind of a connoisseur but I'm slowly building my pallette and Flemings does the job. \u00a0 I personally love a juicy, rare steak so I had the prime bone-in ribeye*, 20 oz. (52.95). \u00a0At the urging of the waitress, I added the truffle-poached lobster with bearnaise sauce and caviar ($12.50). \u00a0For a side I had the famous Fleming's potatoes, thinly sliced potatoes with cream, jalape\u00f1os and cheddar cheese. \u00a0Wow! What a luxurious spread. \u00a0The steak was absolutely huge. \u00a0It was cooked to rare perfection and to be honest, I might of had them cook it a bit more, but I nearly always have to order rare at other steakhouses to get what I want. It was nicely seasoned, so juicy and the bits of fat just melted in my mouth. \u00a0It's a truly delicious steak. \u00a020 oz. was complete overkill and I ended up taking half of it home (which is by no means an issue). \u00a0I like the lobster and the sauce, and was pretty excited to give caviar a try. \u00a0It was good but not sure it was necessary. \u00a0Really depends on if you want to focus on the glorious steak. \u00a0The potatoes were absolutely heavenly. You can't even taste the heat of the jalapeno so I wouldn't worry about that and the potatoes are so thin they look so delicate and scrumptious. \u00a0One thing to note is that the sides are actually big enough for two so if you'd like to cut costs, one side would suffice. \u00a0We didn't know this and so sadly (not sadly) I had to take some of those home as well. I absolutely adored the potatoes. I can't forget the complimentary bread, which was warm and delicious and came with the most delicious gorgonzola buttery cheesy spread and another spicy, garlicy spread. I even asked to take the leftovers with me! \u00a0My husband had the wagyu New York strip, 14 oz. (55.95). He nicely saved one little piece for me at the end so I did get to try it and it too was really good and possibly better than my steak. It wasn't seasoned as much as mine and I actually preferred the flavor and oiliness from the fatty steak. \u00a0He also had the Caesar salad and truffle-parsley mashed potatoes. \u00a0The salad looked delicious and had slivers of fresh parmesan and crumbles of prosciutto. \u00a0I had salad envy for sure but kept my eye on the prize...my lobster. \u00a0I did taste his potatoes, they were smooth, flavorful, but nothing beats the Fleming's potato bake. \u00a0I really wanted to give the lava cake a try but we were too full. \u00a0As if this wasn't enough, before we left the gave my husband a complimentary box of the most beautiful truffles for his birthday. \u00a0Again, this was a wonderful experience. \u00a0My husband and I have made it a goal to check off all the local awesome steak places on our list. I'd say this is a great way to start and a memorable way to celebrate my wonderful steak-loving husband. I hope we return. \u00a0Our total bill was $174 for two, plus a $30+ tip, so it's not something we can do often but it was a nice treat. \u00a0To curb costs, if that's a concern, next time I'd skip the lobster, skip the soft drinks, order one side and maybe even a smaller steak...or not...don't mess with the steak, that's really what this whole thing is about anyway. \u00a0Also, if you'd like to get an idea of the prices before going, go to flemingssteakhouse.com and click on locations.

But alas, it must be done, for I haven't a single complaint about our decadent experience here tonight. This was one of the best end-to-end meals I've enjoyed since this Jersey boy made a home-away-from-home here in Nebraska. These friendly Midwesterners sure do know how to cook some cattle.Fleming's is set in an area that makes you automatically want to hate it -- right in a crowded parking lot of a non-descript suburban shopping mall. But upon entry you are greeted with the typical high-end steakhouse decor of dark wood, high ceilings, leather banquettes, and super-low lighting. If it weren't for the open kitchen and the persistent aroma of broiled beef wafting through the room, you could almost smell the piles of money they are minting in the background.As I often say, when you are charging this amount of money for food and drink, flawless execution at every touchpoint is no longer an opportunity to surprise and delight the customer -- it is now a contractual obligation that the customer expects you to fulfill.Fleming's more than met its obligations from start to finish.Round 1 -- Wine & Drinks. My Manhattan was... perfect. That is, Knob Creek bourbon, Carpano Antica vermouth, Luxardo cherries perfect. The wine suggestion was also right on the money. That they decanted it and let it breathe, and then attentively monitored the table to ensure our glasses were never empty, was a sign that the service was going to be very good tonight. Round 2 -- Appetizers of barbecued shrimp skewers, baked brie, and crab cakes. Not a fan of the first two, but the crab cakes were excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce they were served with. My dining partners said both the shrimp and the brie were spot on as well. Round 3 -- Salads. I had the Caesar. I've never had two Caesars that were exactly the same, but this one was standout. Despite having a cold and it being very hard to taste my food, the dressing had a serious spicy bite, presumably from fresh garlic being mixed in. I'm really not sure what went into the dressing but the flavor and the bite, although slightly unconventional, was absolutely awesome. Loved it.Round 4 -- Steaks. I went with the Flemings special steak -- a NY strip, crusted in crushed peppercorns and kosher salt, seared quickly in a hot iron press, and then broiled to that medium rare perfection I love so much. OMG. As an aspiring Vegan, I am so incredibly disappointed in myself for enjoying this steak so much, but it was really that good. I love that it was served immediately after being cooked, and presented on a scorching hot plate. This allows you to enjoy a steak that's still pink and bloody on the inside, but that stays hot for the entire time it takes you to eat it. I won't say it's better than the whiskey ribeye at the Drover, but goddamn it came pretty close.Round 5 -- (As if we needed a Round 5.) Chocolate molten cake. Ironically, I vowed never to eat another one of these after seeing Jon Favreau's recent movie \"Chef,\" but it's what my colleagues wanted. Well, thank goodness I listened to my colleagues because I could have eaten through a mile of this stuff. So, so good. And a perfect complement to all the previous dishes.One thing I really appreciated about tonight is that we were never rushed. We were allowed to finish our entire appetizer round before being asked for our dinner order. Granted, it was a Tuesday night and we were sat early. But I sense that this is the kind of place that really puts a lot of focus on the customer experience. And our waitress could not have been better -- professional and attentive, but not overbearing. So for those of you who say I have an unfair bias against chain restaurants, stick this in your pipe and smoke it. Good is good, and fair is fair. This little outpost of Flemings earned its money tonight and I'd come back in a heartbeat.

This burger comes with your choice of a cup of cheese on the side (I chose Blue Cheese) and two strips of seasoned bacon. I thought the bacon was worthy of a side in itself. The Blue Cheese (even though orangish yellow) had a nice spicy flavor to it and was a great garnish. My burger (I ordered Medium Rare) was not as pink as I would have liked, but still moist enough to maintain its juices.Their Happy hour menu has 5 house wines or 5 cocktails for $5, but only one beer, and that a Samuel Adams.

Very dark, rich wood and leather feel. Loved it. The wine menu being on a tablet PC was sort of strange, but I suppose modern and convenient.We started with the crab cake appetizer, which was delicious, if a little small for two people to share. And I'm not usually one to dip crab cakes in sauce, but whatever sauce came out with these was amazing.We polished off our appetizer and sat for a moment or two. Before long, the man I assume was the manager walked over to us and complimented us on our appetizer choice, and then let us know it would be a couple minutes on our steaks. I'm very laid-back, so this was fine by me, but I suppose with these prices comes better service. The manager proceeded to offer us free salads (something around a $15-value for two), so we took advantage. I got the caesar and my wife got the house. Both were very good, and mine came with dried prosciutto bits, which were quite tasty.Finally, to our steaks. As I said, I'm not generally one to go to such an expensive place, but I have to admit these were the best steaks I've ever had in a restaurant. We both got the main filet, and they melted in your mouth. I got the bearnaise sauce, and was struggling because the steak by itself was amazing, but the sauce was also delicious. I went every-other-bite.We also got the Fleming's potatoes, which were very good, but so rich and heavy. We had to take them home.Overall, it was a very good experience.

Nice touch. The waitress was attentive though when she was reading to us the specials she spoke very quickly and it was hard to follow and she seemed to keep looking over our head when talking to us.

Ordered 3 sides., the green beans, chipotle mac and cheese, and loaded baked potato.

There were other patrons in the restaurant wearing sports coats and others wearing jeans.Ambience- There was nothing special about the ambience. I felt like I was in any other chain restaurant. Not romantic. I could see the television sets in the bar from where I was sitting. I guess if you were there to watch the game while you were eating it was good.

There were some tough spots in the steak and it was a bit over-fatty in places. But it had good flavor and generally was a good steak. Most places, especially when paying this much, you get some sides. Not here. Those are extra. Its hard to stay under fifty, even sixty, per person for a full meal. If you have money to waste, this may be a good choice. For the rest of us, you can get as good of a meal at other places and still have money for breakfast the next morning.

The atmosphere is typical steak house; dark lighting, dark woods, lots of business men in suits. The service was very attentive and our server was very pleasant.They brought out a fresh baked mini loaf of bread with two compound butters - garlic parmesan and sun dried tomato. Both were delicious. Although I found it amusing that the waiter said the bread was a \"starter compliments of the chef\" - hello it was bread. There is a tremendous wine list with a huge selection of great wines by the glass. We each started with a salad. Mine was a Flemings salad which is mixed greens with craisins, croutons, grape tomatoes in a light vinagarette - very good. There was also a Caprese salad ordered which was beefsteak tomatoes with fresh mozzarella cheese. I didnt try it but my co-diner said it was very good. I then asked to make sure the steak is local. I am in Omaha and only wanted beef from the region, otherwise I was going to order the salmon on the menu which looked soooo tempting. The waiter confirmed it was prime corn fed beef from the mid west either Nebraska, Kansas or Iowa so I went for the porcini rubbed filet. I have got to say that this was the most delicious, tender melt in your mouth filet I have ever eaten in my life. It was served with 4 asparagus spears (most dishes here are ala cart fyi) and I do believe there was butter melted over the steak. I ate the entire steak even though about half way through I was completely satisfied hunger wise. One of my co-diners had the rib eye which was gigantic - she took half of it home. The other had shrim scampi over zucchini which was cut very thin like spaghetti. So it was a great substitute for pasta and obvioulsy much lighter and no carbs. She said it was delicious. We also ordered the sauteed spinach which was fabulous. We passed on dessert but the server brought out a small box of chocolate truffles compliments of the chef.All in all a great meal.

I wanted to get the real low down on this place and here were my findings:1. They have two kinds of plantain empanadas that are both very common in El Salvador: bean filled and white milky stuff filled. I couldn't get a good explanation of the white milky kind, but they didn't have any that the day I went so I opted for the bean one. I thought p-empanadas would be the bread pockets filled with plantains. Oh no my friends... the plantain IS the outer part!!! So what I had was beans wrapped with mashed cooked plantains that is then lightly fried. SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! It is very testicular in shape so I can't wait to eat the white milky one.... wait... I mean.... inappropriate!!!!2. Wednesday is Tamale day (all tamales just one dollar) and keep in mind these are the banana leaf wrapped ones that make me El Salivate all over the place!3. Thursday is Pupusa day so (any poo-poo that tickles your fancy just a dollar!!!)4. Don't over look the drinks!! They have three drinks (NA) that my friend said are very Salvadorian. One was called Chan and it was red, sweet and had all the chia looking seeds in it?? I had one, I forget the name, that was the fruit where cashew nuts come from? It was also inappropriately milky white-ish-esque...5. They DO have an English menu!!! Apparently homegirl thought I was some kind of latin dude when I came in so she slipped me the SP menu. 6.

H.", "Maybe I've been spoiled by the multitude of delicious El Salvadorian restaurants in the DC area cause I've definitely had better than this spot. Perhaps I just caught them on a bad day. I settled on the grilled chicken, salad, rice and refried beans after the waitress was unable to answer any of my questions about other items on the menu. Guess I should have taken Spanish instead of French in high school. \u00a0While the chicken was seasoned well it was overcooked and rubbery. The waitress forgot our beans so that took awhile.

Came here on a Friday night for Omaha restaurant week. The brown butter seared scallop was bland and tasteless. For my second course I had the salmon with edamame risotto. The risotto was definitely the highlight of the entire meal! The salmon was cooked perfectly and good enough but definitely nothing spectacular. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was... good. The service was terribly slow! Every time we needed something we had to snag our server ourselves. \u00a0He was never proactively checking on us.

By far the best calamari I've had to date. \u00a0My rib eye steak was preceded by a field green salad, which I wasn't expecting after having ordered an appetizer. The rib eye was accompanied with an abundance of flavorful vegetables, asparagus, Roasted potatoes, and spinach. The well seasoned, perfectly cooked medium rare steak was enormous, too! \u00a0And although I'd already decided to take portions of my appetizer and meal, I had to end the meal with a chocolate mousse which was served in a chocolate bowl-shaped shell, encircled with fresh whipped cream and three kinds of berries! \u00a0The Petit Syrah was a rich full bodied wine that complimented each course of the meal. \u00a0Hats off to the host, the server and the chef!

Light on the walnuts and heavy on golden raisins made the cake very moist and yummy. Total bill for dinner, with the $95 wine, was $223 before tip. Waiter was attentive and made SOLID recommendations, he was a teacher, and we didn't even hardly look at a menu, and he told us which entrees were selling fast so we could get our order in!

Visited the Flat Iron with three friends for a holiday dinner the week before Christmas. \u00a0We all agreed, one of the most delightful dinners we have all had in a long time.

He made some really nice suggestions on appetizers for the group to share and wine to complement the dinner. One of my friends ordered the steak and lobster. It really stole the show. Not a cheap evening. $600 excluding tip but for a special evening with some of the best food and service in Omaha it is well worth it."], ["Sarah G.", "If last night was my first ever visit to the Flatiron, I can honestly say I wouldn't be back. (Unfortunately it was the first trip there for 5 out of the 7 at our table.) Also, if last night was my first ever visit to the Flatiron, I'd be giving it a big heaping one-star review... but dropping one of my former favorites off my \"Top Omaha Restaurants\" list AND writing a scathing one-star review just wouldn't do.Still, a seething two-star review is clearly on the horizon here.As I think back to the nearly 3 hours we spent at the Flatiron yesterday evening, the underlying feelings I had were of disappointment and sadness. Worst of all, I felt like a fool for leading my Yelp friends into dining disaster... like some twisted version of the walrus and the carpenter where the oysters get to write reviews in the end.Luckily the company and conversation was great, but even that couldn't make up for the slow pace of service (slower than you'd expect), the weird smells, duct tape employed weather-stripping, and the quality of food (when someone has to ask for ketsup to go with duck fat fries, that's not typically a good sign.) Aah yes... the food. \"The time has come, the Walrus said, To talk of many things...\"We were talked into the appetizer sampler. Which, yes, I've always ordered on previous visits. But this time was different... and it didn't seem different in a 'seasonal menu' kind of way, but different in a 'we substituted the crab meat for mushrooms' way. There goes $14/person for what amounted to one shrimp, a bite of sausage, one cream cheese wonton, a breaded portobello and a couple spoons of cheese/mushrooms. Believe me that these are the descriptions as I recall them in terms of taste, and it was obviously a far cry from the menu.Next up... meals. Bill ordered the \"grilled rib eye of beer, with lobster bearnaise, and duck fat fries\". He was essentially in the same boat as Matt, but had the please of the one that tasted 'chewy and gamey'. It was reminiscent of steaks and [bad] fries I've had at other one-star reviewed restaurants in town (Bistro 121 I'm looking in your direction). And with the $34 price tag, something I would have been disappointed with if we'd paid half that. I ordered the \"grilled Berkshire bone in pork chop with an apple ginger glaze and apple fennel slaw & rosemary new potatoes.\" Chop was decent, though not worth $30. Accompaniments were sad. Four or five droopy inconspicuous green beans, potatoes that were undercooked, and slaw without a melding of flavors.We also both had the cesar salad - which I've raved about previously - but cover anything with blue cheese and I can't complain too much. Still, the lettuce seemed a little inferior and the bacon wasn't the thick peppery type I remembered. Probably not worth the $4 up-charge.The plating was not at all appealing (see pictures).Yet we continued on and ordered dessert. I too opted for creme brulee, and mine was also burnt on the top, though the texture of the sugar was good there's nothing worse than a bite of burnt sugar in creme brulee... except maybe not using real vanilla beans. For $7 I want to see some black flecks in the bottom of the dish.And yes, the final tally. After tax and tip (20% added in by our server) we got our of there on the order of $160 for two. Others were more in the range of $100/person. It even seems that since my last visit this summer that they've raised their prices... though that's just conjecture.In summation, I expected so much and felt slighted to see how drastically different this dinner was than in visits past. Yes all the blah blah above could come off as complaining, but this was 180 degrees different than I've come to expect from the Flatiron and I can honestly say I won't be recommending or attending again anything soon. (Tear...)"], ["Eden C.", "Really wanted to try this place for Omaha Restaurant Week so my friends and I made a reservation. We were really excited to treat ourselves, but the manager called and sincerely apologized about having booking issues that day and offered reservations next week with a gift certificate. She was very nice about the situation, so we had no problems switching.When we got there for our reservation, i was intrigued by the building's architecture. Looking around the dining room, you can gather that it is a classy venue from the patrons there. We sat down, ordered a bottle of Rioja and started debating amongst ourselves about appetizer selection. Fortunately, our waitress was happy to resolve our issue by suggesting a sampler of appetizers. Perfect! We got the veal sweetbreads, artichoke pierogi, potato crusted scallops, and seared ahi. They were all really good but the scallop was definitely my favorite our of the 4. I had to restrain myself from licking the plate because we were in a classy restaurant. For the entree, I ordered the Veal rack shop with brussel sprouts. Flavors were spot on and the portion was pretty big as well. I could not finish my dish and none of us had room for dessert, even though we were very tempted to try them. Overall, great service and amazing food (plus part of it was covered) so I am pretty pleased with this visit to the Flatiron.

For sure I'm going to pull out the money-card because if you are going to charge a lot for food, it better be daaaa-aaamn good, right?!I think the atmosphere is a toddler step above Olive Garden with dim lights to give off an illusion of a pretension ambiance. Service was like old viscous molasses which usually doesn't bother me, especially since this visit I was accompanied by a fun group of fellow food-heads. So let's get to the food...NO ONE... let me repeat... NOOOO ONE in our group of seven enjoyed their meal. We started out with the appetizer platter which was a sad plate of what seemed to be leftovers from patrons who have already left. You know what I mean? Like the left over half eaten piece of broccoli covered with trace amounts of cheese next to a mushroom to add an aura of snottiness to the plate. We thought it would be a good idea to get this platter so that we could try different appetizers? But really I just ended up paying $16 for a piece of shrimp and spam-like versions of various fungi.So what do people usually get with their meal? Soup or salad right? Thank jebus I got the soup because the salads were SAD!!! I'm not a restaurant owner, but at a place like this, you can't give people salads made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be confused with the salad kits you buy at Hy-vee!!! I was the only person getting soup which was some butternut squash soup. Honestly, it was the ONLY thing I liked that night, but I felt bad sipping on it as my food companions suffered through their blase salads!Then the meals.... I was feeling a little frisky and decided to get the paella dish. When I got the dish, I was confused.... confused why there wasn't paella on my plate?! I can understand how a place like this might have a fusion version of paella since FI isn't a Spanish eatery, but it was an ambiguous mixture of flavorless shrimp, China Buffet quality mussels and a small hidden side of Spanish(???) rice the size of my palm. DIS A POINT MENT! (yeah with all four syllables)I thought my meal sucked, but after hearing everyone else's testimony around their bland steaks, boring as hell lobster and ho hum sides... I guess it was a lose-lose situation. So I'm the type of person who likes to eat their sorrows away so I decided to give the dessert a chance... how bad could dessert at a fancy smancy place be? I asked how the bread pudding was made because I didn't want average bread pudding. I wanted bread pudding that would make me pudding in my pants and forget about the rest of my dinner. I was told it was the chef's special and that I will definitely be pleased. Well... it was special alright, but not in a good way. Never have I had bread pudding that looked and tasted like a slice of wonder bread from the bread outlet store rolled into a ball with caramel fresh from the Hershey's bottle it came from... It was honestly offensive and the last straw for me.I don't mind throwing down money on food, but this place makes me wonder why I had to pay over $100 to sit down try to justify bad food for three hours.

It was also supposed to come with asiago mashed potatoes - it came with awful fingerlings and mushrooms. My ribeye with lobster bearnaise and duck fat fries was just totally disappointing. The steak was fair (another persons at the table was chewy and gamey). The sauce had no hint of lobster and the duck fat fries tasted just like bad unseasoned run of the mill fries from anywhere.The creme brulee was burnt on top and lacked any sign of actual vanilla bean.Please don't waste your time and money here.

The hostess did the strangest thing while we were eating dessert - pulled over two empty chairs and added them to our table. I thought it could have waited five more minutes until we left. Food was nothing special. Veal sweetbreads as an appetizer were just okay. The house salad was pretty bad, actually. Limp, bitter lettuces with a too sweet dressing. My scallops were well-cooked but gritty - grr! And there were only 4 small scallops on that $32 plate. My husband's rib eye dish was the most tasty menu item, but it was tiny - I'd guess less than a six ounce portion. Meyer lemon torte for dessert tasted - and I swear I'm not making this up - like the crust was made with animal fat.

The mushrooms were served with this amazing sauce. Most importantly, the steak was delicious. I prefer filet mignon over ribeye but I won't complain. :)The ambiance is a bit conventional; I tend to like restaurants either super-hole-in-the-wallish with lots of \"character\" or uber-hip-trendy.

The shrimp were amazing - a little charred on the edges with a lemony sauce. The gratin of crab and mushrooms was not as 'saucy' as other dip-your-bread-in kind of baked appetizer dips but the flavor was amazing.

the other reviews are so ravingly complimentary and mine isn't, but we just had dinner here tonight, so it is fresh in my mind, and I promise I speak only the truth.I had made a reservation about a week ago to make sure we could get in on a Saturday night. \u00a0I had asked about getting the table in the \"point\" which others have mentioned in their reviews as the best place to be. \u00a0The man on the phone said he would \"make a note.\" \u00a0I didn't get my hopes up, and sure enough, a larger group was seated there when we arrived. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0We were offered the first table by the door, or another deeper into the restaurant that looked larger. \u00a0Not wanting to take a table that was bigger than we needed (there was just two of us), we took the one next to the door. \u00a0The host/proprietor assured us it was a great table, which honestly insulted our intelligence more than anything since it was obviously one of the least desirable tables in the place. \u00a0I can understand him trying to be optimistic, but he went on a little too long about how he's the proprietor and he knows the best tables and it has a great view of the rest of the restaurant. \u00a0Certainly not an ideal table while the place was busy, as the aisle next to us was often crowded and a cold breeze came in every time someone came in. \u00a0It was better once the theater crowd started to dissipate after 8. \u00a0I wish I could blame our out-of-the-way table for the service, but I don't think I can.While our server (Melissa), was generally friendly and helpful, she was generally not forthcoming with details and seemed to abandon us from time to time. \u00a0I'm all for a more relaxed pace of service, but it did feel as though we were a lower priority than other tables, as she had a clear view us of from behind the bar/kitchen entrance. \u00a0In terms of withholding details, when we ordered our entrees she asked each of us if we wanted a house or caesar salad, as if this was included with the meal. \u00a0The bill showed otherwise, and while each salad was only 3.50, it was disappointing to see that it had not been presented as an option instead of as included. \u00a0Another instance of this was after our meal, when she brought over dessert menus without saying a word, although a number of the dishes seemed to warrant further explanation, like \"Jennifer's Seasonal Cheesecake.\"The ambiance of the place was nice, but didn't come close to some of my other Omaha favorites like 801 Chophouse and Boiler Room in terms of the overall touches that really make a restaurant a nice place in my mind.The food itself was very good for the most part. \u00a0Having read Sarah G.'s review and several others, I asked about the appetizer sampler, which did have some good stuff. \u00a0For dinner we both had the caesar salad, having read a number of rave reviews. \u00a0I was very underwhelmed. \u00a0For me it didn't surpass a relatively average caesar that you might get at a chain restaurant like Outback or Applebee's. \u00a0Romaine that was almost a little soggy under a very average dressing. \u00a0I also didn't pay close attention to others when they mentioned that the salad had blue cheese, which my girlfriend despises. \u00a0And while I don't mind it myself, I thought there was more of it than necessary and it didn't really belong in a caesar in the first place. \u00a0The bacon was a nice touch, I guess, but certainly couldn't save the salad from mediocrity.For the main course, my girlfriend had the lambchops and I had the lobster tail. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0The lobster was fantastic actually, although I'm not sure how much of this was preparation and how much was just the quality of the lobster. \u00a0For dessert Melissa recommended the chocolate mousse, which was small (as she had mentioned) but very good and a good way to end the meal. \u00a0I asked for an espresso (assuming a place of this level would have it ) but they only had coffee.When we left, no one, including the host/proprietor said anything to us, as he had to almost every other party as they left, heartily thanking them for coming. \u00a0It was as if he knew them all personally. \u00a0We weren't sure if our generally rather poor service was because we are a relatively young-looking couple that doesn't scream \"big money theater-going regulars\" or what. \u00a0This has never happened to us before in Omaha, but then again, we don't frequent the high end places on a regular basis.If you've read this whole thing, I'm impressed. \u00a0I tried to be as fair as I could be here, which led to a review that is probably too long. \u00a0As another reviewer said, I really wanted to like this place more than I did. \u00a0It was unfortunate that we did not garner the respect that every client of any restaurant (or any business for that matter) should get. \u00a0I am looking forward to returning to the Boiler Room, where the

But I'm over it."], ["Scott C.", "One star. \u00a0No doubt. \u00a0I must say, I had my reservations after reading the reviews from the haters on Yelp that gave terrible reviews for this place. \u00a0Most complained about the price, but even putting the price aside, the food was quite terrible. \u00a0I was seduced by an amazing menu. \u00a0Porcini dusted fire roasted fillet mignon with black truffle butter, white truffle emulsion, cauliflower and truffle mac & cheese. \u00a0Lobster and Chive stuffed crepe with sweet carrot ginger sauce. \u00a0It sounded so good, that I was wring my Yelp review on the way to the restaurant (Best %#$&@! Food I have ever had, I thought). \u00a0With all of these rich and flavorful ingredients and truffles everywhere, how could you go wrong? \u00a0Well these are the dishes I ordered and they were appallingly bad. \u00a0The salad was OK, they used miso soy dressing which did add strong flavor, but I found a bit too salty. \u00a0Then came the lobster crepes. \u00a0By the way, there was almost no lobster, just gobs of mascarpone cheese inside the crepe. \u00a0Funny it doesn't say anything about the cheese in the description in the menu. \u00a0It was so overwhelmingly cheesy, I had to take my fork to squeeze out the cheese and pick out the four nuggets of lobster out of the crepes. \u00a0I would say that there was about a half an oz of lobster between the two crepes at most. The carrot and ginger sauce was just an orange pool at the bottom of the plate with no flavor to speak of. \u00a0So for $16 bucks, you can enjoy two pancakes wrapped around cream cheese. \u00a0I will take iHOP thanks. \u00a0Then came the steak for $39 you get about a 5 oz fillet. \u00a0They should have called it a petit fillet. \u00a0After an involved conversation on what they considered medium rare, I ended up ordering medium rare just to get a fillet that was almost well done. \u00a0Any chef that takes a fillet and cooks it well done should be dropped in the gulf to wade in the pools of BP oil. \u00a0The truffle sauce was more like a tablespoon of truffle butter. \u00a0No white truffle emulsion to be found. \u00a0I could not see or taste the porcini at all and the mac & cheese had not truffle flavor at all. \u00a0The menu was downright misleading, so don't believe it. \u00a0It is like saying you have a prime aged porterhouse on the menu and then serving up hamburger when it is ordered. \u00a0The vegis were good I will say, but after paying 4x the price of Piccolo Peats (a two star place) for half the meat and not as skillfully cooked, I should expect more than good vegis. \u00a0The waitresses and waiters are a bit better looking, but it is just not enough. \u00a0If you want a steak in Omaha, stay away from the fancy places. \u00a0They just end up screwing up what is a pretty simple dish to make. \u00a0Drovers, Gorats are both better in flavor, quality as well as price. \u00a0 Sorry for the long review, but I had to vent...Flatiron is crappiest place in crapville and as an homage to the other Flatiron haters on Yelp, this place is expensive to boot."], ["Friedrich N.", "My my my, this is the best restaurant in Omaha. \u00a0Everything is delicious, the menu is unique, and the service is spectacular. \u00a0I highly recommend...."], ["Ryan t.", "Good food, great wine. \u00a0 I've eaten here several times, mostly for special occasions like Whacking Day, Festivus, and Sales Rep from Company X wants a suggestion to take me out to dinner Day. \u00a0While it is on the higher end as far as cost, I've never walked out of here thinking I didn't get more than my money's worth. \u00a0If you're torn about what to order, just go with whatever their special is. \u00a0I've adopted this strategy with great success."], ["Amy A.", "We went on a nice quiet night, so we didn't need our reservation. The staff was very attentive. The entrees actually came with a soup or salad, very rare for a place like this. I got the filet with truffle mac & cheese, my husband had the duck with noodles. The two pastas were good, but very, very salty. My filet was dry, but alright with sauce. I do order my steak med-well, but when I do at a steak house, it is still always very juicy. My husband had no complaints about his duck. We had told the waiter it was our anniversary and they were nice enough to bring us as small complimentary dessert. Overall a good experience."], ["Robert S.", "THE best restaurant in Omaha. \u00a0After living in San Francisco for 3 years, I'm still hard-pressed to find a restaurant that I enjoy more. \u00a0The atmosphere, the food, and the unpretentious service all make this a very memorable restaurant. \u00a0Steve is great too, he really makes you feel at home."], ["Jeffrey S.", "I recently ate there for the first time. \u00a0I was shooting for a romantic date at a nice place, and the Flatiron was not a dissapointment. \u00a0The food was very good, and the service was excellent. \u00a0I was also very pleased to find Cakebread on the wine list. \u00a0The owner sent us a complimentary dessert drink. \u00a0It's easy \u00a0to drop a chunk of change, so I can't afford to go there often, but I was very impressed, and for a really nice dinner out, I don't know of many places in Omaha that are better."], ["Charles G.", "I had really high hopes for this place after everything I'd heard about it over the years. \u00a0I went only once, for a business lunch, and it was merely \"okay.\" \u00a0Good but not great. \u00a0Perhaps it fell victim to unfairly high expectation."], ["Dylan G.", "Of the high end restaurants in Omaha, there are few that provide a true fine dining experience and are worth every penny. \u00a0The Flatiron is one of them. \u00a0Inventive and delicious dishes, cool atmosphere and good service."], ["M R.", "Very nice venue for a special night. Call ahead and ask to be sat at \"the tip\". The food was excellent, although there is a strong reliance on mushrooms. If you are like me and aren't high on shiitake and trussels, it may take some time to find something that will fit your palette. I settled with the mozzarella stuffed chicken - a delicious dish served on top of lentil beans. The mozzarella was fresh and the chicken moist. My wife had the rib eye steak, which was robust and plentiful. Even I got past the taste of mushroom to enjoy the savory flavoring. The wine list is long; however, if you are a variety seeker like myself go by the glass because there is no price break to purchase by the bottle.The service was excellent. As an introduction, the waiter asked if we were celebrating anything special. (We were - it was my wife's birthday). As an encore to our meal, he provided a small mouse covered in hardened chocolate with a berry medley and a birthday candle. Despite the size, it was extremely rich and just the right amount for two.Cost for two entrees and two glasses of wine plus generous tip (we did get a free dessert!) was $100."], ["Mike J.", "When I am planning a nice evening out or business dinners this is one of the first places I think of. The atmosphere is stylish without being over the top or stuffy. The quality of food and service never disappoint. This is the type of place you can enjoy spending a couple of hours with business partners who you really don't like. In other words it makes them tolerable. One thing I must point out is that for years I have often had the same server. That says amazing things about this place in itself. If you are wanting to impress someone then start here."], ["Eileen M.", "Great service--the front of the house really has their act together. Lovely ambiance. But the food? Surprisingly ordinary for the prices charged. I'd be more forgiving if four of us hadn't spent $300 after tax and tip, but for those prices, I expected to leave going, \"wow--what a night!\" rather than \"well, that was just okay.\""], ["Angela W.", "I tried the Flatiron Cafe last night. Parking was a little tricky, but there was an event at the Orpheum Theater. I strongly advise to make a reservation if going for dinner; it's not a very large restaurant. Restrooms were adequate. The bartender was friendly. The service was Excellent. Our waiter (Lance?) managed to handle other tables, and still time our entire meal perfectly. No waiting, no rushing. We let him pick the wine for our entrees, and they were perfectly paired. We tried the calamari appetizer; it was some of the best I have had in Omaha, yet. Both the Caesar and House salads were excellent. My entree, Sea Scallops with Marscapone Polenta, was wonderful, as well as my companion's Ribeye entree. For dessert, we tried the Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse; it was not too large, thank goodness, and was quite tasty. The coffee was unexciting, but one doesn't come to a place like this for coffee. ;-) \u00a0Our only issues with the experience were the steak knives, the chairs, and the somewhat gender-biased \"date\" theme; \"the ladies sit here\", \"the ladies get the dessert\", \"the men get the check\", etc. \u00a0 All in all, I will definitely dine here again - when budget allows."]]}
