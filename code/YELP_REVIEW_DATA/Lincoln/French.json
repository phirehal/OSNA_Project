I did have to explain to the bartender how to make a drink advertised by a poster in the bar (Angry Balls - not complicated). It was fine until my group of 4 was joined by 2 more to watch the game, and the manager refused to let us push 2 tables together. We could have mimicked people around us and occupied two tables with our 6 people and yelled at each other, but no allowing the tables to touch. Additionally, the manager and the server were super rude - as if we had requested to watch golf on Huskers game day. We left - the rule has no reason (we would spend the same either way) and was rudely applied. Better dive bars to watch the game."], ["Melissa S.", "Its a decent bar with decent food. The wait staff is hit and miss. Last time we went our waitress was absolutely the best! Fun, fabulous service, memory like a steel trap. This time...meh...not so much. Brought one person in our party draft beer every single time he asked for a bottle. Forgot to order both of my sons meals.

We have gone there for lunch and although there is some sports on the TV's, they have rap music blaring over the sound system.We went there to watch the NFC Championship. There was a sign on the door saying they were going to close immediately after the game for a Christmas party. We asked if they were staying open until the game ended and they assured us they would. The game went into overtime, they would not serve anymore drinks and shut the main TV screen off so they could start their XMAS party. We had to leave and go to another bar to watch the end of the game. Bar manager said we gave last call, which they did not for us, and was very rude to get paying customers out of the bar.SO they took our money throughout the game, but we get kicked out before it was over.Horrible Bar and really not a sports bar.

There usually tremendous artichoke chicken was tough and hard to chew. When our friends complained, nothing was done.

We both had fish but I had the Orange Roughy off the menu (not the special) and she had a salmon dish off the menu. \u00a0Yes.. you can get good fish in Lincoln! Our guacamole appetizer was first rate, and the service was very good. Even though the waiter appeared to be bus-boy and waiter and brought the desert tray, he never appeared rushed or frazzled.

Better than my grandma's - sorry grandma! Huge portion and even with my crazy preggo appetite I barely put a dent in it. My husband had steak and eggs and finished every last bit.

So nice and polite and very helpful with gluten free options. At dessert he even gave me a quick tutorial on how to use the blow torch for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as I just bought the same one but haven't used it yet. There is a gluten free menu with a good amount of options and the vday specials they were also willing to try and make gluten free. We ordered the chips and guacamole that was prepared table side and was delicious. The chips were gluton-y so the server brought me out a generous portion of vegetables to eat it with. I ordered the bacon butter fillet which was cooked to an appropriate temperature and was good, sides were also tasty. My date had the ahi tuna and lobster special which was so beautifully plated and he said it was really good. I enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert and he liked his green gateau cake.

If you can choke it down, at least you won't leave hungry. \u00a0Just feeling unfulfilled. + The servers have never insulted me to my face, nor done anything overtly racist at my table. \u00a0I've read a lot of over-the-top (probably fake or heavily embellished) reviews just absolutely roasting comically poor service at places. \u00a0I haven't been wowed enough at the Green Gateau that the service stuck out to me as special, but also haven't had any horror stories that stick out, either. \u00a0If service is more important to you than flavor, this could be your place.+ I didn't get violently ill. \u00a0No food poisoning is a really strong selling point for any place that serves food for money and definitely a big reason I didn't go all out one star. \u00a0\"Hey, our food isn't poison! \u00a0And we have a fancy-ish atmosphere for Lincoln.\" \u00a0 A great slogan that they can use for free.+ It's like crack for self-proclaimed foodie women in their early 20s who don't know how to cook. \u00a0If you have a female date who is still in college or around graduation age, take them here if you're too lazy or inept to make something better at home for them."], ["Andrea A.", "Best brunch in town.

The food and service is exceptional. I had the \"The Chips\". The fish was cooked perfectly and the fries weren't too salty. We had a refill on our drinks before they were even half empty!

I wish they had a location in Omaha."], ["Melissa M.", "High quality and unique food. Great place to try something different. This is a hometown favorite. The breakfast is awesome. Everything is good so you cant go wrong."], ["Molly K.", "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Lincoln. The lobster bisque is amazing! There is not any lobster chunks but you can still taste the lobster. A bowl of the soup tastes really expensive but it is only $4. I usually get the french connection minus the mushrooms and onions. It's basically a french dip sandwich with bacon. They have really good fries and I am picky about sides. \u00a0I also like their blue cheese potato salad. I haven't tried any of their desserts because I'm too full after eating dinner."], ["Paul W.", "I've always loved eating here. Never had a bad experience. The food is always good, the staff is friendly and the pricing is great. It has a lot of personality and an European flair, which is reflected in their menu. The location is not the best for larger groups as it can make parking difficult and sometimes the restaurant can be too dark and feel a bit claustrophobic. Having said that, still gets 5 stars."], ["Heather M.", "I ate here for the for the second time with my husband. We were seated in a quiet booth which is exactly what we were hoping for. The atmosphere was very quaint semi romantic. \u00a0We started with the truffle fries which were good, but we've had better they were lacking a little flavor the first time I had them here they were better. I had the tasters trio that started with the seafood bisque that was amazing as usual. My main course was the Orange Roughy. I substituted the summer squash and zucchini for asparagus. My fish was lacking a little in the flavor dept however the sauce was very good and my asparagus was very woody. My husband had the Duck Bangers and Mash. His was delicious! \u00a0It's very hard to cook good duck especially for someone whose been hunting it for years! For dessert I had the Creme Brule again I've had this before and loved it however this time it had no vanilla so I sent it back and they were very gracious and took it off the bill. My husband had the long horn filled with marscapon and pears with caramelized pears on the side and a chocolate sauce. \u00a0To die for! I had one taste after mine was sent back and it made my mouth smile! Overall it was good just an off night for the chef. We will definitely be back!"], ["Elmo J.", "Easily in the top five best restaurants in town. \u00a0Be sure to grab a bowl of their roasted red pepper soup - it's life changing! \u00a0They also make a fantastic chicken fried steak that's is made to order with fresh meat. \u00a0Also check out the fish & chips, very good and the fish is always fresh. \u00a0The truffle fries are out of this world. \u00a0Service is usually good, but I have had very bad service on a handful of visits."], ["Lisa I.", "My favorite restaurant in Lincoln! The food is fabulous, the service is great and the atmosphere is simply wonderful! \u00a0I haven't had anything that I did not love and I have been many times! The perfect date place, or a great family place as well! \u00a0I highly recommend it!"], ["Jennifer M.", "My first experience with the Green Gateau was almost 20 years ago on Valentine's Day. \u00a0The food was wonderful, and the dessert sold me for life. \u00a0Though I no longer live in Lincoln, I visit Green Gateau every chance I get. With all the years of scrumptious meals, I'm not sure where to even begin.Food: Those who have read my other reviews, know that I adore desserts. I don't say this lightly when I say that Green Gateau is one of my all-time favorite places for dessert. I always have a terrible time deciding between the signature Green Gateau cake and the Chocolate Oblivion Truffle Torte, my two favorites. The Green Gateau may not be a favorite for everyone, but I love it, even though cake desserts are rarely on my list of favorites.I've had all types of dishes, from a cheese platter, to full meat main dishes, and never been disappointed. The presentation of the food is always elegant, though the prices are far from standard fine dining. I'm an avid tea drinker, and Green Gateau has its own special blend of strawberry and apricot flavors that I order every time. It's popular enough that the local coffee shop, The Mill, sells the blend (or they did last time I was there). Atmosphere & Service:The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite charming, offering various rooms for more intimacy than a fully open restaurant. The decor is reminiscent of an earlier era European eatery without being gaudy. The servers are always pleasant and competent. You can enjoy a meal in casual wear or your finest without feeling out of place. \u00a0If you're looking to dine on weekend night during prime time, I recommend reservations. On a holiday like Valentine's Day, reservations are a must.Parking:There is off-street parking next to (off 10th Street) and behind (off L Street) the restaurant, a boon for the downtown area. It might be hard to get a spot at a really busy time, but otherwise we've never had trouble finding a spot in one of the two lots.Overall, I recommend Green Gateau for any meal of the day. \u00a0My personal favorite: Stop by for tea and a mouthwatering dessert at high tea time and relax with a friend."], ["Tiara M.", "Oh boy. I went to Green Gateau for lunch today with my husband. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a waitress is critical of my selection. \"Yes, for now I just want Ice water while I look at the menu\" \" Is that all?\"\" I'll start with a cup of soup and a coffee and a croissant.\" \"Just the cup of soup then??\" Its like, yea, I get it, you are computing your tip in your head based on the final anticipated bill, you have made that excruciatingly clear. \u00a0But here's the thing, If I find you attentive and friendly, and I only order a 6 dollar lunch, I will tip 100 percent instead of 20. I think tips should start at 5 bucks, no matter how small of a meal I order. But I only gave my waitress 10 percent \u00a0today, and I regret \u00a0giving that much.The lobster bisque was salty and my croissant was stale. I told the waitress the croissant was stale, and instead of whisking it away and bringing me a fresh one, she said \u00a0as if she had to personally go and make one from scratch \" did you.....did you want me to get you a new one?\""], ["FS O.", "I could write a lengthy review, raving about the place, but will simply say that it is the best food in town. So often I find myself saying that a place had good food \"for Lincoln\" since the cuisine scene is pretty bad here. But the Gateau is truly good by ANY standards. Truly wonderful fare, great service, and prices just high enough to keep out the riffraff."], ["Adrian B.", "This restaurant has a touch of European quality to it without being pretentious or over priced. \u00a0The breakfast brunch is the stuff of legends and is packed but well worth the wait on weekends. \u00a0I mainly visit this place on a weekday for a lunch because I love the peppercorn battered Mahi-Mahi fish and chips. \u00a0You get 3 fillets with an appropriate pile of fries to compliment the dish all for a very affordable price. \u00a0They have their own unique and tangy homemade tartar sauce and malt vinegar upon request. \u00a0The beautiful old wood decor and various different rooms to eat in give you a real sense of intimacy. \u00a0The waitstaff are very efficient and well dressed like a proper restaurant should have, something often lacking here in Lincoln. \u00a0This place is an institution and their dinner menu is splendid. \u00a0The Roasted Duck breast never fails to impress. I for one am not a dessert person but you have to indulge in a Creme Brulee which is heated table side."], ["Lisa J.", "Great for brunch! We went on a weekend, the day after a football game, and because we got there before 10, we didn't have to wait to be seated. After 10, there was a massive line.Food was wonderful. Their anniversary special of $5 for specific breakfast dishes was a great deal. Be warned that the French Slam only comes with 1 egg, which was not quite enough for my husband. But thankfully my strawberry-cream cheese filled French toast was more than enough for my husband, my daughter and me. Service was OK -- it was a bit busy, so we had to wait a bit for our food.And be forewarned that they do not have a kids' menu. We ordered eggs and a side of fruit for our daughter, and that came to $8 -- more than my meal.We'll definitely be heading back there when we are in town for another game."], ["kaitlin p.", "This place is my go-to place in Lincoln. \u00a0All their food is fantastic, and their handmade burgers are a thing of genius, (I always ask for mine on a croissant, so delicious). \u00a0Also, the place itself is very quaint, perfect for any occasion. \u00a0There service is usually pretty nice, and there are some servers that are spectacular (Jessie, that's you)"], ["Marina G.", "Best food and service in Nebraska and all neighboring states!!!I would love for them to be open all the time!"]], "Mellow Mushroom": [["Robert L.", "My wife and I have been to the MM in Gatlinburg several times, and we were elated to find that one was in Lincoln, NE on the way home from Denver. We found the location while driving through Kansas, and spend a good 2.5 hours arguing with our stomachs about when we're going to eat.So we ordered maybe a little too much, but we were fine with that. We stared with the buffalo wings and a Muffelotta. The wings were ok, and the muff was pretty good assuming you drown it in marinara. (The wife and I both are not huge fans of olives, and it turns out this thing was covered in them -- not the restaurants fault).We also ordered the \"House Special\" pizza. I could not get that thing in my stomach fast enough, it was simply amazing!The only real downside we can see is that we ordered this shitty amber beer made in Oklahoma, which tastes like giraffe crap and pine trees. I would know what this tastes like.Good times and good food!"], ["Linsey O.", "Just tried the Mellow Mushroom yesterday with my downtown buddy. My favorite part was the atmosphere, when you walk in the door you feel like it's the 60's and I felt like a hippie. Loved it! The drink menu was interesting, lots to choose from. I ordered the TKO and it was delicious. Perfect mixture of tangy and sweet. We ended up ordering the Hummus appetizer with pita bread, it was delivered to our table quickly and was fabulous! The bread was warm and perfectly chewy. Then the time came for our pizza. We ordered a 14\" Maui Wowie to share (six slices). What an interesting combination! One slice in we noticed a hair on our pizza (eek!!) Long, wavy and blonde. But whatever it happens! The manager was just walking by and noticed our faces, quickly asked what was wrong and had our pizza re-fired right away. She even took it off our bill! I feel like it's a good day if a hair in your food doesn't ruin your experience. Well done folks!"], ["Jessica H.", "Yia Yia's has been one of my favorite Lincoln pizza stops for a long time but now Mellow Mushroom is a contender. \u00a0When it comes to pizza, what matters to me is the crust and having a unique blend of toppings. \u00a0Mellow Mushroom offers just that.What might nudge them to the top? Customer service and atmosphere. What a fun, trippy, happy place to be! I'm trying very hard to force myself to visit downtown and the Railyard now that it's full of new restaurants, events, shopping and people, and this proved to be a great adventure. \u00a0The awesome colors and decor and the laid back atmosphere make it a fun place to hang out while Yia Yia's is a dark bar you can't take a family too. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, love Yia Yia's. Always will. \u00a0It's a good place to meet friends for dinner for drinks and pizza kind of place. My friend and I showed up on a busy Friday night. \u00a0We were told we'd have to wait at least 25 minutes but we were actually seated quickly. My very first impression? I was worried. \u00a0The kid seating us looked to be about 14. \u00a0However, he proved me very wrong and was professional and courteous! \u00a0Then our waiter was an \"awesome dude.\" \u00a0Shaggy hair, pretty blue eyes, peace love shirt and a great attitude. \u00a0He knew the menu well, he was very attentive, overall the service was fantastic!So lets get to the real reason we're all here, the food.Drinks! It was ladies night so we each got a drink. My friend had the classic margarita and I had a chill pill. Trust me, I needed it. \u00a0I'm a fan of gin, and the addition of the cucumber was unique and fresh. \u00a0Drinks are kind of pricey at $7 for each small tumbler but it was a nice splurge. Something unique. \u00a0For appetizers, my friend and I shared the stuffed Portobello Mushroom (portobello mushroom cap stuffed with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella. Baked and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.) and the Capri (vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil drizzled with a balsamic glaze). The mushroom ($9) is pretty pricey for what you get (one mushroom, which the waiter was very clear about). \u00a0It was good, not an over the top experience, so for the price, I wouldn't get it again. Now the capri was wonderful. \u00a0It had a larger portion, the mix of flavors fantastic, herbs were fresh, the mozzarella so yummy and smooth. \u00a0To be honest, you don't really NEED appetizers because the pizza will fill you up but I love trying new foods and I wanted to have some to take home. \u00a0For our pizza, we split a large. \u00a0It took some doing but we managed to each eat three pieces, so we both took home a couple slices. \u00a0The waiter let us know we could do a half and half so we had half house special (which is everything but the kitchen sink) and holy shiitake pie. \u00a0I could have eaten probably any of the combinations on there and look forward to returning to try them out. \u00a0If you're wanting something a little traditional (i.e. toppings and red sauce) the house special is a great option. The sausage and bacon, heck all the ingredients, are fresh and yummy. \u00a0The holy shittake was BOMB! \u00a0Olive oil and garlic base, Shiitake, button and Portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, mozzarella and MontAmor\u00e9 cheeses. Drizzled with garlic aioli and black truffle oil. Garnished with fresh chives and shaved Parmesan. \u00a0Yeah, get this! The crust (whole grain) was also very taste. \u00a0Overall it is a little spendy but it was a good experience. I will be back!"], ["Brandon A.", "I think Mellow Mushroom is at a solid 3.5 stars. I went with 4 solely because of the pretzel appetizer. I had gone twice before and didn't even consider getting an appetizer. The other day someone at my table ordered the pretzels. I was expecting little pretzel bites... whatever. These things were big pretzels and they brought a lot out! Dipped in the beer cheese sauce is a dangerous combo. Another veteran move is to save the beer cheese after the pretzels and use it for your pizza crust. As for the pizza: pretty solid. Definitely a fresher, less greasy type of pizza. You can't go wrong with the house specialty or buffalo chicken. I also love that they incorporate bacon a lot. For a vegetarian option, we also tried the kozmic karma and it was pretty good.

While bringing a cool, fun, upbeat atmosphere, the pizza here is average, at best, although after a football or basketball game it remains packed, regardless. They've done a great job with the location here and if you are coming to drink, grab a salad and eat pizza you'll think the pizza tastes far better than if you were sober. However, if you are with a large group or kids, there's a place for you here. It a fun place to eat, just don't come here for the food."], ["Courtney M.", "Went in on a very slow Tuesday night, the restaurant had maybe 5 tables seated when our group came in (8 people). While the server was very friendly, we were amazed at how long we waited to get our drink orders taken. Then how long it took for the drinks to get to us. Once we ordered our food it took an insanely long time for our food to come out...remember there were maybe 5 other tables, and most of them were finishing their meals when we arrived. Several people in our group ordered wings but when they finally came out, they were slightly warmer than room temperature. While they tasted good, for as long as they took to come out they should have been hot. The pizzas came out nice and hot and while most were yummy the house combo was pretty flavorless. We were surprised that the sandwiches came out after the pizzas. I'd say that we'd be back, but we won't. Based on the \"speed\" of service if you're attending an event near by, I recommend coming in well before event time or going somewhere else. If they're that slow on a slow night I can only imagine what it's like when they're busy."], ["Gabriel G.", "Summary [4/5 Stars]:The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best pizza I've ever had in Lincoln. The catch? You'll want someone else to pay. The medium pizza costs upwards of $20 (for 6 slices)... which really puts a damper on the evening if you have a large appetite. Food [5/5 Stars]:I had the Mushroom Stew alongside slices of the Mellowterranian and Hawaiian pizzas. Everything was filling and incredibly scrumptious. Value [2/5 Stars]:If you and a friend are going out for a big dinner, stay away. If you have an adult's appetite, your ticket will end up being $45+ (before tip). The food may be filling, but it's not quite filling enough to warrant a half-Benjamin price tag. This is really what stops MM from making it to 5-Stardom.Customer Service [4.5/5 Stars]:All of the employees, especially our waiter and hostess, were incredibly friendly and helpful. The smiles are just as much part of their uniform as the tie-dye shirts. If you don't tip atleast 20%, even on your large bill, you're heartless.Atmosphere [4.5/5]The interior is really something else. The entire restaurant's structure is built to look like the underside of a mushroom... and the walls are covered in funky murals. Though perhaps not a great place for a business meeting, it's a whole lot of fun."], ["Jordan J.", "The atmosphere at Mellow Mushroom is straight out of Austin Powers. It's fun, inviting and fosters an environment that everyone will love. My only experience here was on a balmy Saturday in January. It was about six hours prior to a concert across the street, so it was only about a five-minute wait for five people.The food was reasonably priced -- except the pizza, which was far too expensive, even for a specialty pizza joint. It's a shame, though, because the pizza was almost* delicious. The waitress warned us that the kitchen was abnormally busy and it would be about 30 minutes to get our food. No sweat; we were in no hurry. However, when 30 minutes turns into over an hour to get pizza, it becomes a problem. It's like they weren't prepared for someone to order a few 'zas. When it finally arrived (with no genuine apologies for the wait), we found that the pizza was rather burnt. *It was edible, but would have been much better without the char. Not a great first impression for a place with such an inviting atmosphere. It wouldn't be my first choice for pizza -- due to price, wait time and the way the pie was prepared, but I'd give it another chance and order something other than pizza."], ["Laurel C.", "Mellow Mushroom is like the pizza joint on your corner that sucks but you still go because it is there. The pizza is always bland and the beers couldn't be more expensive, yet you find yourself there because of location. Tonight I showed up at 9:15 only for the manager Jeff to tell me they decided to close early. I should have told him to close for good because what he lacked for in courtesy he made up for in rudeness. Don't go to this place as they don't care about you and certainly don't care about quality of food. I tolerated poor service and taste for location- place is a complete joke.

I had to explain/special order a \"Jamaican jerk chicken pizza\", our medium pizza ended up being around $36 (jerk chicken, pineapple, and we added onions...how is that an almost $40 pizza??).

They were even nice enough to split our pizza in half the other way with cheese and no cheese for my husband and I.They have GF crust options, Vegan cheese options, and even Tofu that you can sub for the meat (it sounds weird, but totally works.)The thing that strikes me even more than the food, though, is their customer service. One time when we were there they messed up and put one wrong half on our pizza. It wasn't a big deal to us because we had wanted to try that one too, but before we even had the chance to notice it, they owned it and told us they had another large pizza of the other flavor in the oven for us. When they brought that out, they realized that they didn't have any cheese on the one half, so they made us another medium pizza of that flavor with the cheese (BOTH for FREE.) Needless to say we left a good tip, but the way they handled it was really impressive.The one catch to this place is that it is really expensive. \u00a0We normally get the medium and polish it off wanting more, but not wanting to pay for more. \u00a0If it was cheaper, I would probably buy stock and go everyday."], ["Travis F.", "I'm so disappointed! We were really looking forward to eating here. Everything we ordered was all over the board, from \"outstanding\"to \"You've gotta be joking\". First, we ordered drinks.

If you like Muffalettas you have to give it a run. Unfortunately, that's is where they peaked. My wife ordered a Mole' Chicken Burrito off their 'limited time' menu and the chicken was so dry, she had to order extra sauce and sour cream just to get it down. The flavor was good, but dry chicken? Come on. I ordered a 10\" \"Mighty Meaty\" pizza and added 2 extra toppings... $20 YIKES-O-RAMA! Now, don't get me wrong, I'll pay for good pizza but this wasn't it. First it was burnt on half of the bottom. There was not much sauce and the flavor was just so-so.

Before I even talk about the food (which was average) the price is what you have to know about. We had 2 side salads, a medium (14\") pizza, and soda's - the bill with a 20% tip was...$47! In Lincoln, NE I could easily feed a family of 4 for $47. The pizza alone, 6 pieces mind you, was $23, and side salads were almost $6 each. And, on to the food. I had a Caesar salad, which was good, lettuce crisp and fresh, good dressing. The pizza was their BBQ chicken, and it was average at best. The crust is thin, but instead of being crisp it was chewy, nearly wore out my jaw trying to eat it. There was very little chicken on the pizza, the sauce was good, but not enough of that either, and not a lot of cheese. I don't need my pizza to be overloaded or anything, but for $23, I would have expected it to have a LOT more toppings. The service was great, very friendly and helpful. They did a good job of keeping up with our drinks, brought the bill right on time, etc. There are plenty of places to get Pizza in Lincoln, and across the country, that have better food for a much better price.

My party of 5 all ordered a variety of drinks from cocktails to beers. Everything we had was great. They offer wide selection of wine and beer and a moderately sized bar. The appetizers were pretty much gone when I got there but they sounded good. I ordered the baby back ribs which were really good! They do have a bit of a kick to them.

The food was delicious. We had the black truffle Mac and cheese, spinach artichoke dip, sp\u00e4tzle, crab bisque, asparagus and the turkey Apple sandwich. If you're a Mac and cheese person, I wouldn't strongly recommend it, but it's a good dish to share. The flavor is delicious, but there was definitely something missing to it. The sandwich was well made, with modifications honored perfectly. The bacon was perfectly cooked and was overall a delicious sandwich.The asparagus was delicious as well. I personally don't love asparagus that is super thick, so I wouldn't order it again myself, BUT if that is how you like it, definitely get it! The sp\u00e4tzle was amazing. It's my first time trying it and I LOVED the flavor, texture, etc. The crab bisque was hands down the best I've ever had! I live in Southern California, and get it pretty much everywhere they offer it, and this beat all of those out and then some. If you like crab, get it. You won't be disappointed.

We walked in late (around 9:15) and sat ourselves in the bar area. We were greeted immediately. Service was good, not overly friendly, but prompt and efficient and not rude :-)We ordered the Rhode Island calamari for an appetizer, it was perfect. Maybe the best calamari I've had. Very fresh and flash fried just enough to make the breading barely crunch. Flavor was on point. For entrees we decided to share the three by the sea and drunken noodles. The seafood on the 3 by the sea was absolutely perfect. It was a salmon filet, either 2 or 3 scallops, and 3 huge shrimp on a bed of creamy risotto. I can't believe how fresh this seafood was. Living in the Midwest, fresh seafood is not too easy to come by, but I have my few places. Wow. I seriously do not have enough nice things to say about how perfectly prepared this dish was. The combination of the risotto and the teriyaki reduction brown sauce with each bite of skillfully prepared fish was almost orgasmic. As for the drunken noodles, they were served in a bowl with disposable chopsticks. The noodles were very nice, mixed with out of the shell edamame, red bell peppers, cashews, red onion, and cilantro tossed in a perfectly spicy hoisin type sauce. The menu gave the option to add beef tips but we thought it sounded good without meat. I work at a Thai restaurant, so I wanted to try a different take on the traditional Thai dish. I have to say, it was very different at venue. Delicious, but we should have added the beef tips. I feel that the dish was missing something, whether it be egg, more veggies, beef tips, just needed a little more substance in my opinion, but I suppose I am a little biased. Thank you venue!

Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the gluten free menu options. Food came out in perfect timing and all the courses were spot on.

Parking was plentiful, since it was in a public lot. Decor was modern and chic. Hostess was friendly and was seated immediately upon entering. I expected to wait or possibly be turned away, especially since it was a Friday evening. Ambiance was moderately loud and at times, it was difficult to carry a conversation. Service was mediocre, and took more than ten minutes before she arrived. She did tell me that she would be with me in a few minutes, which did linger on; but it was a given, since it was pretty busy. For an appetizer, I tried the Ahi Tuna which was cooked to perfection and had the Tuscan Gnocchi for a main entree. Although the Gnocchi was tasty, I was disheartened that it was pan fried, compared to the regular version in boiled salted water. It was not bad at all, just not what I expected and craved for. The wine menu was plentiful and when I requested the Prosecco, I received a confused look from the waitress. She stated that she wasn't sure that she had that, especially because she noticed that I didn't have a wine menu. I reassured her that it was on the wine menu, since I had done my research ahead of time and checked their website. She returned a few minutes later and notified me that it was only sold by the bottle, which I had no problem with and complied.My overall experience was above average, but not superior.

We were directed to The Venue by a friend of ours so we decided to give it a go. Upon entering, we were greeted by two younger looking hosts, one of which was obviously unimpressed by our appearance/ and demeanor due to the snide comments she muttered under her breath about our casual appearance.We were seated promptly and given menus to peruse. Upon scanning the room a couple things were brought to my attention. One, the head chef was eating on the cooking line in plain site for the all the guests to see, a big no no being from the service industry myself. Two, the main dining floor had a hotel lobby restaurant vibe that almost sterilized the entire experience. Three, the ambiance that was trying to be set was trumped by the cafeteria like clamor of the guests' conversation.After were seated, a server approaches us and takes our drink order, not two minutes later, another server approaches us and greets us again to take our drink order. Once the staff figured out who was going to serve us, we proceeded to order our starter.We started out with the crab rangoon dip, which was pretty tasty. For our entrees, we decided to split the baja fish tacos with a cashew cilantro rice, the chicken lavouche pizza (cheese, chicken, artichokes), and a flank steak with Bearnaise sauce and bersain cheese and chive mashed potatoes. Much to our dismay, almost every dish fell short of our expectations and the hype that seemed to be generated about this restaurant and its \"well rounded\" menu. The fish tacos and rice were room temperature at best, and upon returning to the table, we were unimpressed with the tacos bland flavor and overall lackluster appeal. So we pushed the tacos aside and moved on to the pizza that was served with a garlic dipping sauce. When the pizza hit the table, you could tell it had been sitting for a while before it was served as the cheese was already starting to solidify again, and in the first couple of bites, my friend found a large bone in the chicken. The third dish that we order was a steak that was actually really tasty, however, its nearly impossible to screw up a steak in Lincoln, NE so that dish seemed to be a no-brainer.Our server Dayton was more than helpful and hospitable to us and our every request, but unfortunately, the venue is not an establishment i care to return to again."], ["Kaitlynn K.", "My boyfriend and I went to the Venue for my birthday and for Valentine's Day. \u00a0Each time was amazing. \u00a0They have a great wine selection and the menu is to die for. \u00a0Each time he had steak while I enjoyed seafood. \u00a0The waitresses were always great and explained any questions we had in detail. \u00a0Their suggestions were equally as great. \u00a0The atmosphere is great, dimly lit but just enough.

Perhaps doing it to two steaks?My girlfriend had fond memories of this restaurant, so on a recent trip to Lincoln we decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a couple of steaks. We would have been far more satisfied eating at the Culver's next door. When you're dropping $100 on a meal (it would have been more if the waitress had ever asked if we wanted another cocktail), regret should not be the first emotion you feel when you walk out the door.I shoud mention the pros: the drinks were great (again, the one drink we were served, as our glasses sat empty through our entire meal). The appetizer -- the crab rangoon dip -- was pretty stellar as well. Ideally, we should have just enjoyed a few drinks and an appetizer and gone somewhere else for dinner.But, back to those steak dinners: it is CRAZY easy to cook a steak that is, at worst, passable. Our filets were brown all the way through... the difference between a steak ordered medium and a steak ordered well done is not something that happens within seconds on a grill. These steaks were essentially ruined. My side, the asiago crusted sweet potatoes, were okay, but basically just tasted like pumpkin pie filling with rice krispies on top. My girlfriend was far more unlucky, with her risotto cake just coming out bland and sticky. Disappointing. Forgettable. A shame because we loved the look of the restaurant, especially since it's part of a much longer strip mall setting.

Both food takes forever, water glasses empty, plus the guy that does the tastings always forgets you and your server has to keep reminding him you've been waiting. Last time he left without even giving us the option to buy wine. Or server did, we paid for two bottles he apparently was out of. So we were given replacement ones, of a different type..So.. The wine night could use some organization.Price is really affordable for the quality of ingredients and portions. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. Seems to be hit or miss for a lot of yelpers, but overall I've been pleased."], ["Cherie L.", "I am giving this experience two stars only because the waitress was trying so hard and a nice person. We started out our \u00a0by ordering a sweet Brandy Manhattan, only to be told that they had no sweet vermouth. A small matter, unless you run a fully functioning bar. My S.O. ordered the sea Bass which he has had before and it was beautiful and delicious. \u00a0I generally have their scallops, but took a leap and decided on the filet, at $27.00. I ordered it medium rare and when I cut into it, it was well on the outer edge, then medium well with a pink center. We asked out wait person to ask the cook to try it again because it was clearly over cooked. \u00a0After a bit, she returned my original steak and said that they had thrown it back on the grill since the middle of the steak appeared \"under cooked\". \u00a0So ridiculous that we were rendered nearly speechless. We requested that unless they could cook it correctly, we would not ne paying for it and asked to see a manager. The waitress returned and said that she felt the grill was defective, not the chef, and that she had been communicating with the manager via telephone. Needless to say, we never saw the manager. RED ALERT! A fine ding establish running itself?? The waitress was very apologetic I sincerely felt sorry for her with no back-up. I took my meal to-go since my friend had long since finished eating. I have eaten at Camelias several times, and the only thing consistent about the place is it's inconsistency!

I ordered the million dollar burger which I mistakenly believed was the same great Kobe beef burger I'd had there many times before (not inexpensive at $16 for a burger, but in the past had been worth it). \u00a0Well, have you ever grilled too many burgers on the grill for your family at home and refrigerated the leftover burgers for a few days and then warmed them up in the microwave? \u00a0The meat has an old meat flavor. That's what the burger tasted like at Carmela's tonight. \u00a0Had to return it as I just couldn't eat it. So I ordered the pasta with marinara and Meatballs. Same problem with the meatballs and couldn't eat this entire either. Not sure what has happened with their beef supply but it will keep us from returning. We spent over $80 for dinner and a couple of drinks and I had to warm up some leftovers out of our fridge when we arrived home to finally have something that tasted decent. \u00a0I understand now why only a third of there tables were full Saturday night at 7pm when we left.

However, shortly after that, they changed their menu and each of the 6 or 7 times I have been back I have been seriously underwhelmed. The food is heavy, greasy, and the the ingredients seem cheap. The bread they bring to the table is tasteless and soaked in oil, the pastas are all drowning in butter, and the pizza crust is bland.

I never received a reply from them so I'm copying it here to let others know about our experience.Here's the email:I'm writing to comment on an extremely poor dining experience at your restaurant last night (Friday, March 7). My husband and I have been to your restaurant at least 6-8 times, but it's been at least 6 months since we've been there. The last time we ate at Carmela's was during restaurant week. At the time we were disappointed because of the way that Carmela's approached restaurant week (compared to other restaurants) but we decided to give it another try.There were problems with both the service and the food, and I don't expect we will be back. However, I thought that I would send an email describing some of the problems so that things can be improved. Particularly with service, there were things that seemed like poor training. None of the personnel who helped us were rude at all. In fact, they were all very friendly. However, they didn't seem competent. Here are several of the things that were problems:1) We didn't get a wine list when we were seated. This wouldn't be a problem if it was fixed quickly, but no one noticed this until our server asked us for our drink order. We had to tell her that we needed a wine list to make a decision. This was after she already stopped at our table once to ask if we wanted appetizers. She should have asked about drinks and made sure we had a drink menu before asking about appetizers, not afterward.2) The salad was served with the wrong dressing (twice). I ordered a side salad with my dinner. The server said that the house salad was the Sonoma Signature, which is supposed to come with a dijon vinaigrette. It was served with a creamy dill dressing instead. When I asked the server if she could bring the vinaigrette instead, she agreed, and quickly brought out a RASPBERRY vinaigrette (not a dijon). The salad was edible, but not good, especially since I didn't like either dressing. There's a reason I ordered a salad with the listed dressing and didn't request a substitute dressing when I put in my order. The server should ask if someone wants the standard dressing or an alternative.3) Our salad/soup were brought out before our drinks. This is just bad.4) No one seemed to fill waters. We both had empty water glasses for awhile. Finally, the server came over and asked if I wanted more water or wine. Water should just be refilled automatically if it's empty! This isn't just the server's problem. Host staff and others can do this.5) The jacket with the bill was so greasy we didn't want to pick it up to put the card in.My husband liked his dinner (the burger) although I really disliked my food. However, that's not related to the service problems so it doesn't really seem relevant to this email. However, related to the service, the server didn't seem to notice that something was wrong when my meal was mostly untouched. I'm sending this to make you aware that additional training is essential to remedy some of these problems. As I mentioned, all of the service staff were friendly, so it didn't seem like it was a problem with a lack of willingness to do a good job or a poor attitude, but a lack of training on some of these basics.End of email"], ["Sarah A.", "Went for brunch and it was just okay.

I'd come in most excited about their bourbon offerings, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. They have a great selection of bourbons, with really reasonable prices on most things. They even have some pretty rare offerings that you're unlikely to find in many other places (I got to try a 30 Year old Jefferson's Presidential Select, which was an incredible experience). As great as the whiskies are, I was really impressed by the food. The Single Barrel is particularly proud of their locally-sourced meats, but as a vegetarian, I wasn't able to take advantage of them. That said, I tried their roasted veggie sandwich, and it was absolutely amazing. Rather than just being a bunch of bland veggies stacked on soggy bread (which I've had far too often), the wide variety of vegetables were perfectly seasoned and cooked until they were just tender. A layer of amazing fried eggplant chips added a great crunch, and the pesto aoili kept everything moist and creamy. Oh, and do yourself a favor and order the maple black pepper grits - they're astounding, and pair extremely well with bourbon! Finally, I need to acknowledge the service - we were served by Kait, the head bartender at The Single Barrel, and she was incredibly welcoming and hospitable. She really knows her stuff (both about bourbon and the menu), and her passion for the restaurant was absolutely clear. This is a great place, and I can't wait to go back."], ["Elisabeth E.", "I came here for restaurant week and was very pleased with both the special menu they put together as well as their usual menu.

There's a long bar on one end and the restaurant itself is one large room with lots of tables placed throughout.We dined early on a week day and were seated quickly and our order was taken promptly. The server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about gluten free options.For restaurant week they had only a 20.00 menu with three very nice appetizers, entrees, and desserts to choose from. I had the bacon, egg and fingerling potato fris\u00e9e salad, the pork lion with a cherry thyme cornbread sauce, and the banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for a dessert. The salad and dessert were pretty good but the entree was excellent.

What a meal! \u00a0 How has this place not been on Man Vs Food yet?We had a difficult time deciding what to order, as it all looked pretty good. For an appetiser we started with cornbread, which comes with bacon jam (delicious!) and jalape\u00f1o honey. We also ordered a barrel of crispy bacon (which again comes with the jalape\u00f1o honey) (picture included). Bacon was extra crispy, and standing upright- heaven!For dinner, I ultimately chose the PB&J pork chop- as it looked mouthwatering tempting: charred pork chop over a peanut butter sauce with that bacon Jam (seriously - how had I never had bacon jam before?) with maple black pepper grits. It was all better than I imagined! The pork chop was prepared beautifully- and the combination had so much flavour! Our server explained many people substituted out the grits- oh heavans no! Get the grits- it completes the flavour experience!My colleague ordered the brisket- which was also smoked to perfection. We both agreed that this place would be amazing and packed in the winter- something about smoked meats and whiskey would definitely warm up a Person during a Nebraska winter.Lastly- it is a whiskey house- and their list is deep, and relatively inexpensive compared to other parts of the country.

Specifically this meant that there were far less talbles than would be normal for a restaurant setup. The decor was sparse and nothing special. Again probably to accomidate the concert scene. The place seemed a bit unclean from the aspect that the menus were sticky and it looked like it had seen many people that day which we came to find out that there were from a concert given earlier that day. We were told that this was the reason for the gin we wanted and several menu items being out of stock due to 2 heavy days. Not sure that is an excuse for a venue that has been around for a while and does this type of operation probably nearly every weekend. You also present yourself as a butcher and offer meats to take home and cook as well as catering and you are out of bacon and some cuts of steak? Moving onto the food. The menu has emphasis on bbq. There are some non-bbq items like a few salads and steaks. We tried the cornbead appetizer. It came with 3 different spreads which were a jalepeno oil, bacon and sour cream butter. It sounded more promising than it was. Nothing special just plain old corn bread which is about what you get out of a box mix. My wife had the bbq sampler which consisted of ribs, pulled pork and beef brisket. It came with a side of brisket baked beans as one of the many choices offered. All of this was outstanding. Really good bbq. I ordered the 18 oz. ribeye steak medium rare with a side of sour cream and chive mashed potatoes. The steak was very good and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was good but would have been better if served hotter than luke warm. All in all it was a decent place.

We yelped for restaurants in Lincoln not too far from Hwy 80. We stopped in at Single Barrel. We Sat at the bar and were greeted with a great big friendly smile from Jessica. Super sweet.

Definitely would make a point to stop here again."], ["Kycgeek J.", "steak was excellent, service was good, the only reason not 5 stars was a somewhat strange listing of sides and nothing \"normal\" like a baked potato"], ["John B.", "Stopped in for a steak on a business trip. \u00a0I passed the smoker in the alley that wasn't active. I ordered the cowboy ribeye and couldn't resist a half pound of brisket as an appetizer. I had been told there was no good BBQ anywhere near Omaha. The BBQ sauce was thick and KC style, not my thing. But the brisket didn't need it!! \u00a03 perfect slices with a great smoke ring, rendered fat, and very tasty!! \u00a0The ribeye was good too!! Kait provided top notch service and I will be back!!"], ["Alan B.", "You know how when you're grilling a hamburger and it smells so delicious, but the taste never quite matches the aroma? Well, The Single Barrel serves a hamburger that tastes like that smell. Best burger I've ever had. The thick-cut brisket is equally outstanding. Additionally, this place has one of the most extensive bourbon selections around."]], "Ding-A-Ling Bar": [], "Longwell's": [["Ashley Rae T.", "Longwell's is the perfect place to catch your favorite team playing. With multiple big screens throughout the bar and restaurant area, you won't have to miss out on anything. If it's a (relatively) nice day you can sit outside and catch the game on the Railyard's Cube (a 14x40 feet behemoth that can be seen throughout the Railyard's open pavillion). Dependent on how busy they are or what team is playing seating can get a bit cramped, but the outdoor seating option seems to still be viable, at least till the first snowfall. The interior is what most people have come to expect from a modern bar/restaurant of this elk; a dual bar, one with seating that gives you a front row glimpse at the many many beers on tap, (surprisingly, Longwell's doesn't actually brew its own beer, instead opting to provide many Lincoln staples like Empryean and ZipLine), lots of high tops and a glass encased party room. I was a bit disappointed that they play music instead of audio from the game on the big screen but it only slightly affected the experience. My friend and I decided on three items to share: a half order of the Fries Rule add pulled pork, Spinach and Artichoke Dip and the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Sliders. The Fries Rule w/ pulled pork are Longwell's super delicious version of loaded fries/potato skins. The half order was so big that even after splitting it with my friend there was leftovers for my lunch the next day. At first I liked that the pulled pork didn't come pre sauced, but as with most loaded fries it needed a little bit of moisture so I ended up topping it with bbq sauce. The fries were super crispy, although I do wish they were lightly seasoned.The spinach and artichoke dip was really creamy and didn't separate into an oily mess when it got cold. Would have liked more spinach or artichokes in the actual dip but that's my complaint with most restaurants dip. Would have also liked 1) handmade and 2) warm tortilla chips as the side. Overall pretty decent but you should definitely eat this first unless you want to battle with a top layer of cheese to get to the dip underneath when it does cool off.The last thing I tried and certainly my favorite of the night were the BBQ bacon cheddar sliders. We got three nice sized sliders on pretzel buns, not too much sauce, not super small burgers patties in comparison to the bun and shredded cheddar which I like a bit more on sliders (no worries about cutting a slice of cheese to fit). Also no bacon skimping which was a plus. Would order these little guys again."], ["Lianna N.", "For a 1 hour stop on a bar hop to grab a few craft beers and watch some sports or socialize- 4 stars. 1. I cannot speak for the food since we did not eat there. 2. I cannot speak for the fall nebraska football season or any big game night for professional sports- but on a fairly \"normal\" night which we visited, I had a great time.The beer menu is huge, and they have about 70 something beers on tap. We wasted no time asking for the 6 page menu and scouring it for our favorites. We had some out of town guests from the west coast visiting, and pointed out some of the local (zipline) or fairly local beers from the midwest, which they were excited to try. I thought the pricing was fair, about $5 ish for the 10oz and $6-8 for the 16oz. The bartender was fairly attentive to me after helping the people who had arrived first. He at least acknowledged me, which to me is the most important thing when there is a big crowd waiting to be served at the bar. It's sorta \"Hey I see you there and am mentally taking note in the order which I need to help the customers\". I was pleased with this service and it is much better than other bars I have been to when busy. There are 2 or 3 wall sized screens on one side of the room, and smaller TVs on the other. When you are there at night I swear it will blind you everytime they are on a white screen. However, its a HUGE screen which means yay you get to see the game. Just depends on what you care about. I could see this place getting nuts \u00a0during the Huskers season, and having a lot of high energy that comes with Nebraska's favorite team."], ["Jennifer A.", "Service was terrible. \u00a0Lots of beer selection. \u00a0Had to go get silverware for food and own drinks. \u00a0Would not return. \u00a0Fun atmosphere and giant tvs"], ["Rachel Y.", "Not a bad place. Food was excellent. Got the burger and added mushroom and Swiss. Partner got the brisket. They asked the temperature on my burger but then delivered it well done. If you're gonna ask, make sure that's what I get :) also, we walked in and there was a table full of people working that day (with staff shirts on) and, I assume, other coworkers who were not working that day. The on duty employees would get up, take care of their tables and go right back to socializing with the table of off duty employees/friends. Not the best environment to walk into. But our server was great! He was not a part of the Sunday funday crowd. I'd definitely return. Especially to watch a game. The tvs here are huge!! Great beer selection, just a little too early in the day for me."], ["Drey C.", "I love the stuff jalape\u00f1o cream cheese burger always my goto. I like to add barbecue sauce on top, and it's very convenient because it's always at your table. I feel their services is a little shaky at times when not busy."], ["Kendall D.", "If you want to grab a few beers from a VERY large selection, watch sports, and have a decent stuffed burger, all while having your ear drums blown out and having to shout across the table, you're in luck! It's a sports bar; however, they do have private rooms up for reservation. They actually do have delicious stuffed burgers, but I wouldn't stumble in again unless the main purpose was to have a bunch of different kinds of beer with my meal."], ["Anthony A.", "Ryan the bar man knows his stuff.

If you like beer apparently, this is not good according to others' reviews.

My boyfriend had the duffified and it was really good as well! The only bad thing was that our sides were cold. I think it was because it was a Friday night maybe. Or the burgers took way longer to cook than fries? I'm not sure. But I got sweet potato fries! SO good. We'll probably come back :) They also have 24oz burger called the big arse burger and if you finish, you get a picture on the hall of fame haha."], ["Timothy P.", "Best thing is location, walked down to the bar after a Nebraska Huskers football game.

Anyways, managed to find a seat outside with some friends. \u00a0Had some pretty solid nachos, couple good beers and left. \u00a0Price a bit more then I like but what are you going to do?"], ["Jill V.", "This is a nice place if you want to sit back and enjoy a game on the big screens. The food is a bit above typical bar food and the beer selection is incredible. The downsides are: I've been there 3 or 4 times and every time they're out of one of my order selections, the beer (even inside) came in a plastic cup. I understand the plastic for the outdoor area but I expect glass inside."], ["William P.", "The location is obviously great and it seems initially nice that they have so many beers on tap.It does seem that they don't quite know what it is they want to be. They have a lot of beers, but quite a few of them are domestics, which makes it not as comparable to other regional tapped-beer destinations. You can get these domestic beers anywhere, and they probably have twenty of them. I get that they need to have some of these to satisfy event crowds, but it really takes away from what it could be...THE area craft beer destination. But it isn't. They are often out of the few beers that you can't get many other places, but they never seem to run out of say, Bud Light. It's not an altogether bad place, but it is a bit disappointing. How many people are going to be drawn to a place with \"76 taps\" and order a Coors Light? Perhaps it's more than I realize, but it seems that by trying to please everyone, they are thereby pleasing no one."], ["Christina H.", "Coming back the next time we are in the Pinnacle Arena area. \u00a0The beer selection is five-star with more than 100 to choose from. \u00a0For $8.00 I was able to choose four different kinds of beer from a list they called a \"flight\" each flight has a different theme; foreigner, local, coastal are just a few examples. The menu included burgers, brisket, ribs and wings. We tried the dip n share beer cheese bread bowl appetizer, which was delicious. I had a turkey burger and my husband had creole wings, both tasty. I ordered a cornbread muffin which came with honey on the side. If you want mouth nirvana put these two things in your mouth in quick succession 1.) cornbread muffin dipped in honey. 2.) a swallow of Boddington's English Pub Ale. The service was a bit inexperienced, which is why it wasn't a five-star overall. The servers haven't tried many of the menu items themselves and so were unprepared to advise on the food. Also, we tried to access the free WiFi there and couldn't for unknown technical difficulties."], ["Erik Y.", "Cool little bar, with over 70 beers on tap. \u00a0You can take your beer outside and enjoy it at some outdoor seating. \u00a0Great location, right by Pinnacle Bank Arena, and great view of the jumbo screen. \u00a0They also have a number of large TVs in the bar. \u00a0Fun place but as with a lot of places in the Haymarket, I would like it if it were a little bigger. \u00a0 If you try to go on a night where there is a event at Pinnacle Bank Arena, you won't get in unless you get there early, or late."], ["Tim S.", "When we arrived they told us to sit anywhere. Then another person stops by the table and tells us we have to move because we are just drinking. So we move. We wait a little while then someone comes by and informs us that they don't have table service for those tables and we will have to order from the bar if we want anything. At $8 to $12 a beer and at least that for a drink I'm old school enough to expect a little better treatment. Maybe just me but Longwells gets a big ole thumbs down on their server friendliness and customer policy's."], ["Luke V.", "Been here a few times service never too great, food is just okay. Recently I had the pork belly sliders and first off after trying them I am almost sure they are not using pork belly. Pork belly usually melts away in my mouth but this stuff was tough as a cutlet with none of that bacon-like crisp. Was sorely disappointed as I have known some great pork belly sliders in the past but this simply does not even compete."], ["Alexander A.", "It was busy before the Rush concert, but the service was horrible. Everyone had an awful attitude and acted like they were doing you a favor to serve you. I asked for food and got a sigh and she said \"it'll take awhile.\" Safe to say that was my only visit to Longwell's. Disappointing from a bar with such a great beer selection."], ["Christina B.", "Service was great and friendly! The food was pretty good I got ribs tried brisket and had a side of Mac n cheese which was yummy. I also did the beer flight. 3 of the four beers I wanted they were out of stock, so I asked for three different ones and two of those were out too! I mostly came for the beer so it was disappointing to see they were out of many of them. Then when I needed a box they didn't have any so I had to stuff my food into a small container which was not ideal. Don't display beers if you don't them."], ["JP F.", "Rude service, uneducated staff, long lines! Won't come here again! Also way to many rules! You can't sit here or there!"], ["Sarah K.", "I will give this a 2-star review.Pros: several beers on tap, something for everyone. Can accommodate large groups of people (with food order) and of course is in the rail yard so area is enjoyable. Had pleasant experience here prior. Cons: yesterday with a wedding party (about 20 people) got beers and headed outside. Well aware that the seating indicates to see a hostess but we took up a table outside when there was plenty open area. We were rudely advised that we had to leave the area since we were not ordering food or go inside to drink (where we would have taken up much more of the restaurant) Working out the issues with seating and servers \u00a0is necessary before I will ever return to long wells- go to Gate 25 if you have a large group they were more than accommodating."]]}
