Tea is brewed fresh for each order and it isn't too sweet. Great way to finish the meal. We'd recommend the Thai black tea.

Years ago, China Inn was hands-down the best Chinese (Americanized and authentic) food in Lincoln. The line during lunch hours was nearly out the front door. No longer.Now, you can wander in right after noon and get any table you want with zero waiting. In other words, other people have figured out just how bad the food has gotten. Unfortunately for us, it took two visits in mid 2012 to figure it out for ourselves. On both visits the food was cold, poorly timed (one person got their food 10 minutes before the other on both occasions) and simply terrible. On the first visit I opted for one of the authentic Chinese dishes. Bland and tasteless. On our second visit, I thought I'd go the safe route -- there is no way in hell anyone can screw up sweet and sour shrimp, right? After 20 minutes of waiting in the empty restaurant (and listening to some confused, angry bickering in the kitchen) my dish finally appeared. And let me tell you, we could not get out of there fast enough. The fried rice was simply a glob of greasy brown rice reeking of peanut oil. I tried one bite cautiously and nearly spat it out. The shrimp was hardly fried with tons of watery breading slimed onto it. But I am nothing if not persistent. Seeing as how we were starving and in a rush, I figured I'd drown this nightmarish concoction in sweet/sour sauce and gulp it down. But China Inn has apparently fallen into such dire straits that they are watering down the sauce and even the spicy mustard. Both were literally soupy and tasteless, as if they'd been cut several times over with water. Upon seeing this, I shook my head at my wife and then headed to the counter. I told the woman that the food was terrible and that we wouldn't be paying for it. She apologized profusely (but without any surprise on her face at all) and we walked out. We loved China Inn during its heyday. Very sad to see it has fallen so far."], ["Foe M.", "The food was not tasty; not a good chinese restaurant.

Peanut butter chicken and four seasoned green beans are a staple every visit"], ["emily v.", "Upon entering, we found our way to a booth on the far end of the \u00a0restaurant. The dimly lit space was welcoming on a cold, wintry night. Light flashed through the ceiling fans as if a film noir was being shot; if only a man in a fedora and trench coat had been smoking in the booth behind us! In all seriousness, the food is great. Fresh, crunchy veggies and succulent meat. The chicken we ordered was fried crisp without the inch-thick breading that comes on most other Chinese-American restaurant's chicken. Noodles had a great pan scorch on them that gave extra flavor. We ordered our dishes extra spicy, and they had a fantastic balance of flavor (as opposed to the burning your palate without delivering a modicum of taste).On my radar for the next visit is the crispy duck. Be sure to check out the back page for tasty authentic treats.My husband and I ate our fill and the bill was under $15. Definitely one to put on your list."], ["Andy M.", "Absolutely THE BEST CHINESE in Lincoln. I was introduced to this place by friends years ago, and I still can't get enough. The location is unassuming and the decor is a bit \"hole in the wall,\" but the food is always great. This is not Chinese-American food like many people think of when they think \"Chinese\" (though those dishes are certainly available and great), but honest, authentic Chinese food.Some favorites for the less adventurous: Crispy Chicken (fried whole bone-in cutlets cut up and served in a sweet mild chili sauce), Peanut Butter Chicken (fried bite-size pieces).Moderately Adventurous favorites: Ma Po Tofu (spicy and flavorful with ground pork), Peking Duck (on Fridays and Saturdays), Stewed Fat Pork (pork belly in a sauce of pork fat and soy), Fish With Crispy Bean Sprouts....and my absolute favorites, for the true foodies: Salty Shrimp (eat head-on and shell-on, as they come), Spicy Intestines in Hot Pot (half tofu, half intestines, all delicious).Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything on the inside of the menu is traditional Chinese-American favorites you'd find on menus everywhere else in town. These are well-made renditions. But by far, my favorite dishes at China Inn come from the back page of House Specialties. Be adventurous and try one (or see my recommendations above)! I'm still working my way through the list - for the adventurous eater, you can't go wrong.Perhaps most importantly, YOU WILL FEEL GOOD HOURS AFTER YOU EAT THIS FOOD! I guarantee you can't say that about any other Chinese restaurant in town. Go ahead, take the challenge. They use restraint in their use of oil, salt, and starch, so the food is healthier and you feel better. My stomach is always happy when I leave, and this feeling continues throughout the day/night.Service is friendly (if a bit scatter-brained) and prices are incredibly reasonable: under $15/person for a great, filling meal with leftovers to take home. Meals are served family-style, so go with a group to experience the most variety. You seem to get bonus points for using chopsticks and ordering the more adventurous dishes - these things will only enhance your meal.I have introduced probably 20 people to this place in the last year. After you have a great meal, be sure to tell your friends and post another review on here. They could always use the business, and they deserve great success. If you have any doubts, take a look at the clientele and tell me it's not a sign that the food is really, really good :)"], ["YS Z.", "I cannot believe this restaurant is still running.

A nice, varied mix of tender-crisp vegetables in a good sauce with plenty of seafood and meat and nice crisp noodles.The crab ragoon were also yummy, fried nice and crisp without being too greasy and well-stuffed with filling.The disappointment of the evening was my mom's dish. She was curious about the Pork Chop Noodle Soup and probably should have asked the waitress, but her English did not seem that great so she just ordered it and it turned out the pork chop was fried, like really thin chicken fried steak. Neither of us likes fried meat that much and the whole soup had a fried sort of aftertaste from the pork so it wasn't what we expected and wasn't to our taste.Otherwise, a very good experience and the other solid dishes we passed on the way out looked as good as mine, so we will definitely go back sometime when we're in Lincoln again."], ["Nikki B.", "I heard a rumor that China Inn is owned by the same folks that run Windchimes. \u00a0I'm unsure if it's true, but they both have FANTASTIC Chinese food, & this place is cheaper than Windchimes. \u00a0I highly recommend the Peanut Butter Chicken.My complaint: \u00a0If you ever eat here in the winter, don't take your coat off, or get it to-go. \u00a0The door opens directly into the seating area (no vestibule), and it's freezing!"], ["Xinrou T.", "China Inn is one of the best Chinese restaurants with close-to-authentic Chinese food.

(Note: we did not eat breakfast, and it wasn't food from the night before, because we felt pains right after dinner, which meant it couldn't be dinner we just ate. And we eliminated all other possibilities.)One more downside about this place is the hospitality and service. Not the best I know of all the restaurants I've been to. To me, I'm quite used to this unfriendliness and \"strictly-business-attitude\", because quite a number of restaurants back in Malaysia have that sort of attitude. But China Inn's main boss can be quite unfriendly and mean, and could care less about me (because I've worked there before for a short while and couldn't take the stress and unfriendliness). Other than that, the food is pretty awesome for Chinese cuisine. I say that because even though I've been treated really badly before by them, and do not enjoy working there, I still go there often to have my fix of Chinese food.

The first time I came in with my family, I was worried about the quality of the food. I ordered an order of crab rangoon to share with my family as well as the General Tso's Chicken combo. When I first come to a new Chinese restaurant, I use these two dishes to set the standard on the quality of their food. When the food arrived, I was impressed with the filling of the crab rangoon that had a nice blend of cream cheese and krab. I then moved on to the chicken and was very pleased with the sauce that was not taking over the flavor of the chicken. Instead, it added a sweet, tangy-yet-spicy enhancement to the perfectly fried chicken. From then on, this restaurant has been a favorite of my family. Although I do prefer Imperial Palace in the city to Zhang's, this is always a great place to go with the family, especially when we just want to go out to a restaurant near home."], ["Greg S.", "Outstanding!!!!The Chinese food in Lincoln is not the greatest.

The Kung Pao is fresh tasking and just great. I ordered General Tso's and again it was very good. The sauce's flavor was PERFECT. I only wish it was a little spicier. No big deal though, it was so good. The fried rice...most restaurants here serve rice that is old and dry.

The issue with coming at 5 is the food tasted as if it was left overs from lunch or the afternoon and hadn't been switched out for dinner yet. Everything was just off and not what we are used to getting. The hot and sour soup tasted bitter and the egg drop soup had no salt which is weird for a Chinese buffet where I am pretty sure salt is the main ingredient.

They serve crab legs on Friday and Saturday night, and the night I was there, they did a great job keeping them refilled. I didn't see a single pan that had run out of food all evening.

We def would go back..just not on a sunday after the lunch rush. ;)"], ["Brad S.", "The Kung Pao Chicken is really, really good. Best I've had. Fried rice is excellent."], ["Jade E.", "Fast, amazing service.. Huge portions! Hands-down the best hot sour soup I have ever had! Kung pao shrimp has incredible flavor.. I ordered it extra spicy and the temp was perfect! I recommend this place to any chinese food lover!"], ["Renae N.", "My husband and I eat here from time to time, and I heard of it from a Vietnamese friend of mine studying at UNL who has lots of Chinese friends. I like that you can get traditional American/Chinese food here, but they also offer REAL Chinese food. So if you are feeling up to trying something new, you can. When I go to a restaurant that serves \"foreign\" food, and I see natives of that part of the world eating there, I always trust the place a little more. This is the case with Mr. Hui's. I see mostly asians when I go, and they're speaking unfamiliar languages, therefore I feel I can trust I'm getting authentic food, which I appreciate. I mean, I appreciate a good, well made generic General Tso's chicken once and a while, but I'm glad we have Mr. Hui's in Lincoln."], ["Guanbo S.", "This is my second review for this business. The service is OUTSTANDING! Unlike many other typical Chinese restaurants you would normally expect, you actually get high quality service dining here. The food comes in large portions and as a Chinese myself, they are very authentic! Always having exceptional experiences here bringing my friends with me. Highly recommend!"], ["Jodi Z.", "We had carryout on January 28. \u00a0we ordered beef lo mein without onion, garlic chicken with steamed rice, hot and sour soup, crab Rangoon and egg rolls. \u00a0the beef lo mein had onion even though we ordered without but the worst part is the noodles were overcooked and mushy. \u00a0We threw it away. \u00a0The garlic was in a spicy sweet sauce but they didn't include any rice so we ate without. \u00a0the soup, egg roll and crab Rangoon were all very good but it wasn't worth the trip across \u00a0town for it. \u00a0I don't think we will return anytime soon."], ["Cara G.", "This is the best Chinese food in town! Service was outstanding, this is a hard line to tow, my boyfriend and I both serve/bartend so to say someone was outstanding is a lot. The servings are huge for the price, the only down side was the hot tea tastes off. I'm not sure if they add an herb or something but it definitely tasted off. I definitely recommend going there!!"], ["Duane C.", "Never been to Mr Hui's before, but I will say that I will be going back. \u00a0Called in a take out order at 4pm on a Friday night, phone person said about 15 minutes, \u00a0I showed up in 10 minutes and it was ready. \u00a0The restaurant isn't real fancy, locate in a strip mall with a simple but clean seating area. \u00a0I had the Mongolian beef, spring roll and the veggie mix, all \u00a0were very good. \u00a0One thing I didn't care for was a employee sitting at a booth in the lobby rolling/preparing some type of food, Mr Hui,, please keep food prep in the kitchen. \u00a0Here's another weird observation. \u00a0The containers that the food were served in were fairly substantial plastic, and I will admit, \u00a0I ran them through the dishwasher and kept them."], ["Mitch G.", "Try the Hot Sour Soup! It's amazing!!! So is everything else on the menu that I've tried..."], ["Amber C.", "This place rocks!!!! Consistent north restaurant to south restaurant food quality. Friendly, quiet ambiance, prompt service. Portion to $ is respectable. Amazing, do yourself a favor and check it out! Favorite out of 7 dishes tried: CRAZY SPICY CHICKEN (simplest dish of all, packs a bunch)"], ["Ro B.", "Great meal. Friendly service. Quick food preparation. Order the steamed buns early as they take some time, but well worth any wait. Great place overall."], ["Jordan G.", "Have ordered takeout for 6+ people several times and the food has been consistently great. \u00a0Lots of menu options and better quality of food than your typical Chinese restaurant."]]}
