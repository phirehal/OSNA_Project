I wish they had a 3.5 stars. That would be my rating. I don't think the food was quite as good as King Kong's overall, but, had a better atmosphere and service for a \"date night\". I would go back if in the area, but, I wouldn't make a special trip. Had the Gyro Platter. Meat was good. I ordered extra meat and couldn't really tell the difference from those who had the regular portion. I wasn't overly impressed with the Greek Potato. Sald as good. Their Tzaziki sauce was very good, probably the best I've had in Nebraska. Again, not bad, just didn't meet my expectations."], ["Danielle R.", "Decent Greek food and excellent service! The babaghanoush wasn't the best I've ever had but it was decent. The Greek salad that came with the meal was huge, enough to split with another person. It had great flavor, as well as the dressing, but they went a little heavy on the dressing. I'll know to ask for it on the side next time. We ordered the eggplant pita, which was \"lightly fried\".

I wasn't impressed the first time but I decided to give them a second chance since I love Greek food so much.I found their pita bread to be fairly tasteless. This is not bread I would eat by itself, like I do some others. I was unhappy that that the only choice of hummus had roasted red pepper. I am allergic to red pepper and hummus is one of my favorite foods and I couldn't have it.Instead of the hummas, I tried the roasted garlic and feta dip. I LOVE roasted garlic, but I did't like it at all. It was very bitter and hot. It tasted like they put a LOT of raw garlic in it and little, if no, roasted garlic.Every side dish they have is a carb. They have 2 side dishes of the day that might be vegetables. The first day they were both vegetables that I could not eat. They have a entree served with asparagus but they would not serve it to me as a side dish. The second time they had a stewed cabbage and carrot dish that was okay. It was over cooked and bland but at least it was vegetable I could eat. The Greek salad was pretty good. It had a lot of ingredients unlike a lot of restaurants. My only complaint is that there was too much dressing both times I ordered it.On the first night, I ordered the portabello chicken and it was cooked very well, I just thought the cheese overwhelmed the flavors. The second night I ordered the stuffed salmon. The \"stuffing\" is basically a crab cake on top of the salmon. The flavor was pretty good, but the salmon was cooked well done instead of medium or even medium well.As for the service, it seems to be hit or miss. The first night it was pretty busy and my service was good. The second night it was much slower and the service was pretty bad. The waiter came up to tell me to ask him if I had any questions. As I was starting to ask him a question, he turned and walked away. At the end of my meal I sat for 10 minutes waiting for my check. There were only 3 other tables filled at this time.I don't see how people are saying this is the best Greek food they have ever eaten. This may be the best Greek restaurant in Lincoln, but it isn't great Greek food."], ["Matt M.", "We were in Lincoln last week and I saw this place had great reviews. Needless to say we were not impressed. The service was very odd and the food was mediocre. A few of the appetizers (stuffed grape leaves & hummus) were ok but the entrees were lackluster.

It seemed, as one might expect on a Saturday, to be date night. With the exception of two large groups and then another table of three gays, everyone else was coupled off and leaning in closely to one another. \u00a0I didn't notice the it being loud, and even though this establishment is in a strip-mall the interior was \u00a0comfortable enough.The service was good. The hostess, wine guy, waiter were all very attentive. I did feel like they were pushing the wine menu a bit hard, though. Our waiter and the wine guy both suggested one of the \"specials,\" which I think were all in excess of forty dollars. \u00a0My buddy mention that it recently became legal for restaurants to re-cork bottles in Nebraska, so that probably why they were pushing it so hard. \u00a0It didn't really matter to me and if the waiter had maybe suggested a cocktail after I said I wasn't having wine, he could have probably made the sale that way. \u00a0 However, there was an advertisement on the table to a six course wine and food pairing, which priced at $50 seemed very reasonable to me. This sort of event is likely the only reason I would return, unless I had out-of-town guests that absolutely needed \u00a0Greek food on their trip to Nebraska.For dinner I had one of the \"Kazas Family Recipes\" which was named the Parthenon Pasta Platter. \u00a0It was just fine, nothing spectacular but solidly good: pasta on a bed of spinach with shrimp, artichoke and feta cheese. The Really Good feta cheese (and the bed of spinach) is probably what made the dish for me. \u00a0My side was pumpkin risotto, which I actually enjoyed more then my main course. \u00a0In retrospect, I should have just ordered appetisers for dinner, as those that i could see on other tables looked good. \u00a0After we were done eating, a man who I would have guessed was a manager or owner stopped by the table. He \u00a0cleared out dishes and asked how everything was, eyeballing my half eaten meal. \u00a0He looked genuinely concerned and I appreciated that, explaining \u00a0I can rarely finish a restaurant sized portion of anything. \u00a0In closing the meal, the waiter offered to split the ticket which was very nice because my friend and I were obviously not on a date. \u00a0 The hostess held the door open as we left the building. \u00a0However, I am still only rating this establishment a three, because it is a restaurant and the food would have needed to be more memorable for me to consider myself \"a fan.\""], ["Carrie B.", "WOW! \u00a0This place is great! \u00a0Probably the best Greek food I have ever had and definitely an unexpected find in Lincoln! \u00a0The gyros are definitely the best I have ever had. \u00a0We ordered a fried calamari appetizer and got a HUGE serving that was fried to perfection. \u00a0Although we barely had room for the combination plate for 2 that followed, we made room for the delicious combination of meats and sides. \u00a0The side dish made from orzo was tremendous, and I'd love to have the recipe! \u00a0The service was just as spectacular as the food, and the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. \u00a0Very impressive place! \u00a0If you'd like to have a nice, sit-down meal in Lincoln and don't mind spending a little more money than the average meal, I would absolutely recommend the Parthenon."], ["Frans S.", "Very nice modern decor!

Many of them, including Sultan's Kite, are open after last call. Those other joints are ok, but the food and service I get at Sultan's Kite makes it vastly superior to anywhere else I've had falafel. Ever. In my life. They have a menu on the back wall, but since falafel is the only vegan option (besides my side of potatoes) that's all I care about. Even their lentil soup is somehow not appropriate for vegetarians, and that is clearly stated on the menu. There is no vegan sauce option, either. In any case, the falafel is the greatest. For real.So, normally a joint that really doesn't have a lot of variety for me won't get a 5 star review, but I'm going to cut the Sultan some slack because I always leave completely stuffed and can get my falafel 4 ways: wrap, pita, rice bowl, or salad. I always get a wrap, and the guys give me a nice smear of hummus as a substitute for the sauce. One could also ask them for a drizzle of olive oil and I'm sure they'd oblige. Lettuce, red onion, and tomato, and I'm set in terms of my wrap. But there's one more awesome thing I need: a side of real potato wedges! Don't eat them with your fingers because they use turmeric in the preparation of said wedges and you'll turn yellow. In conclusion, they're great for lunch, after last call, and any time you want falafel. Be prepared to be stuffed as the portions are generous. Get potatoes, use a fork. Superior to all falafel joints in the known universe and all of recorded history.

I've long fantasized of an Amsterdam Falafel in falafel deprived Lincoln, now my dream is a reality, except for the nightmare that is parking in the Haymarket.I haven't tried the Chicken yet, but I love the beef and the falafel. I think lamb would be a very welcome addition, but I can't complain about this too much.PROS:1) The atmosphere is quaint, but adequate. I like sitting on the patio or at the bar facing the street. It is an excellent point from which to observe the many species of hipster pedestrians that frequent the area and to critique their waxed mustachery and neck beards.2) The Lincoln location is spatially superior to Dundee in that patrons are able to enjoy their food without becoming intimately acquainted with the hygienic habits of their fellow patrons. Yes, some patrons smell better than others, this is a reality in the realm of hipster food, I accept this.3) The music isn't all rockabilly, indie, my favorite-obscure-band-is-better-than-your-passe-mainstream-band, but mostly it is. Thankfully, I have yet to hear them play techno or anything else that might induce awkward Roxbury-like neck seizures. I consider this a public service and am forever grateful.4) The hours are fantastic, especially if you have glaucoma and a penchant for mass quantities of savory finger food at 2 AM, I won't judge and neither will that oh so sexy Mr. Amsterdam.5) The Moroccan soup is very good, albeit different from my original expectation of a Grateful Bread-esque Moroccan Tomato soup. There are no scones involved with Amsterdam cuisine, so it is a bit unfair of me to compare them to Lincoln's premier institution of homemade soup, patchouli and kitschiness. Unlike GB, they do accept Visa/Mastercard...bonus.CONS:1) The feta fries are a genuine threat to my BMI, if it wasn't for these fries, I would no doubt be as svelte and attractive as Mr. Amsterdam himself. Alas, I can only allay my endomorphic angst by stuffing my rotund face with massive quantities of curry feta cheese and golden, crispy french fries.2) I have been known to wear suspenders in public and am occasionally mistaken by college students as an employee of Amsterdam Falafel. This doesn't bother me much, but really Mr. Amsterdam, I would greatly appreciate an official Amsterdam Falafel t-shirt to complement my pant-suspension proclivities and also that I might better fulfill my role as falafel evangelist.SUMMARY:With or without a complimentary t-shirt, I will go out into the world and spread the falafel gospel.

Everything was really great, to say the least.. The felafel themselves were indeed spicy, which I demand when seeking something with a kick; some things are just not as spicy as advertised.

Just to be clear, it wasn't \"too hot\" in the sense of being overwhelming or unpleasant (I'd say it was just a bit spicier than standard sriracha or the like), but it wasn't a very well-rounded flavor.

Hands down, you will not find better Persian food in Lincoln. And by Persian, I mean a combination of various Mediterranean dishes. There are gyros, baklava (lots of different kinds), and dishes from all throughout the Mediterranean - not just Greek.The atmosphere is a little bit different, so just be prepared. It's a very small place and you will sit really close to the food, which is laid out much like it would be for a catering event. The owner is very friendly and will let you try anything. She'll also let you mix choices so you end up with a plate of whatever you want. The Pomegranate Chicken is delicious. So is the Walnut Chicken and the meatballs.They also have really good gyros that are prepared in the back. Anything can be carried out, but the gyros are especially quick. It's a homey atmosphere, and the service is a little bit weird, but don't pay attention to that. Just go and enjoy the food.

So delicious. And very filling. It is such a treat to have a great Persian place here in Lincoln. The only complaint is that you should expect to be here for a while. Even though all of the food is already prepared, the owner will chat with you during your entire meal. It feels a little like you have been invited into her living room.

The turkey chipotle sandwich is delicious! I would recommend getting it on a bagel instead of the regular multigrain bread. It was definitely worth the stop. I didn't try the coffee, so I can not attest to its quality, but several women walked in after me and ordered lattes, so I imagine it is probably pretty good too. An inexpensive, tasty lunch!"], ["Gabby A.", "Bruegger's is the best bagel you're going to find in Nebraska. \u00a0Unfortunately, we have a major lack in authentic east coast style bagels and most Nebraskans have become accustomed to the puffed up knock offs they serve at places like Big Apple Bagels. \u00a0Bruegger's comes close to what you'll find in NYC or other big cities on the east coast. \u00a0 \u00a0An authentic bagel should always have a crackly, crispy exterior and a chewy interior. They do a good job of hitting that standard. \u00a0They actually boil their bagels which is the traditional way to cook them, and gives them their unique crackly outside. \u00a0 They also have very friendly, fast and efficient service."]], "King Kong Restaurant": [["Jacob B.", "Get the gyro! I'll just throw that out there first. The restaurant itself has a burger-joint feel but with a gorilla themed twist that is fun. However, King Kongs has some interesting pieces to their menu including a Philly cheese steak and a gyro.I couldn't resist trying the gyro platter, and I was not disappointed. The platter came with crispy fries, a tasty Greek style salad, and a loaded gyro that tastes great. The price was fair and the service was very fast. The parking lot and drink machine could use a little maintenance but I consider those minor problems.If you are looking for good fast food, I would recommend trying King Kongs."], ["Frosty D.", "Hit the drive thru and got a gyro.
