Lots of egg and great flavor, I also enjoyed the crispy wonton chips that came with it. I do have to say the portions are HUGE, I think my chicken/broccoli/rice container must have weighed at least 3 lbs, definitely could split one between two people.

Sun Ming doesn't serve the best Chinese food I've ever eaten, but it is by far the best in this area.A random note for anyone that might be interested: I have heard that Sun Ming also serves dim sum, but I have not confirmed on what days they do this, nor the quality and breadth of the dim sum they offer.At Sun Ming, the menu have two sections, one with the standard Chinese dishes (served in individual portions) and one labeled as traditional Chinese cuisine (which I would suggest ordering off, it is in the center of the menu they provide at the restaurant). The dishes in this section are prepared family-style, meaning that they are served with the intention of everyone sharing in the dish, instead of one individual dish for each person.

The ingredients were obviously of a higher quality and the recipes a little different.

One of the best deals if you want one of the basic rolls is their sushi lunch special!Drinks are a little high priced and occasionally inconsistent, but usually well-made. My biggest complaint with Miyo's is the boxing of to-go orders. Their go boxes are not sized appropriately for sushi, so when I order sushi to pick up, it's often kind of squished flat and any sauces on top end up just stuck to the box instead of on the food.

The spring rolls are great, as are the drunken noodles and massaman curry. \u00a0We stopped in and ordered and had our food in less than ten minutes. \u00a0Can't wait to try the other options on the menu."], ["Jason B.", "This is a great place. I love the pad Thai and the Curry is really awesome. I have been here plenty of times and will continue to keep going."], ["W T.", "I ordered Pad Thai with chicken, and while the service was relatively fast (I didn't call ahead) there was way too much peanut and it overpowered the dish. I also ordered the highest spice level and was really disappointed - my dish was not spicy at all. In fact, it was really quite sweet. On the upside, the menu is extensive and the food was flavorful, just not the flavors that I wanted. I may try another dish in the future."], ["Jodi S.", "We routed our trip specifically to come to Columbia \u00a0and return to this yummy restaurant. Once again the food was made to order, fresh and delicious. I had the pad Thai with chicken and Rick had tom yom ga soup and massiman curry with chicken. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back next time we are up this way."], ["S C.", "Great Thai food! Humble little takeout restaurant. If you're going out with the guys and looking for inexpensive Chinese/Thai, do it. It will surprise you how good it is especially for the price. Can't be beat. If you're taking your girlfriend or wife on a date, get it to-go. The food will taste just as good if not better than the extremely more expensive Thai rivals. The interior and service is just like every other strip mall Chinese take out. Better yet pick it up yourself and they will never know. Just know what to expect when you go."], ["Bonnie H.", "As others stated, this place is a small hole in the wall BUT the food is so tasty! I got both the drunken noodles chicken and pad thai chicken. The Pad Thai was not the best I have ever had but it is still really good, about an 8/10. \u00a0The drunken noodles were the best I have ever had though! The thai ice tea was probably the worst I have had, but still good. I did finish the cup but too sweet for me and I was expecting it to be sweet but not as much as it was.."], ["Matthew R.", "The Pad Thai is not the best that Columbia has to offer but it is good enough to mention, as I ordered it twice this week. \u00a0There is never a lunch crowd so ordering is quick and easy."], ["Joseph K.", "This is a standard take-out style Chinese/Thai restaurant. Having said that, I think that it's more freshly prepared than most places I've tried. The fried rice is fluffy and not as greasy as most places. The chicken is freshly battered (or at least tastes like it). It's also nice that they have a wide variety of both Chinese and Thai dishes. \u00a0Overall, a very clean, nice place with great tasting food, the prices are low and they're very friendly."], ["Ravi P.", "One of the best thai places in Columbia.Service is slow because of all of the customers and only 1 cook but it's worth the wait. \u00a0Pad thai is the dish, I usually get mine extra spicy."], ["Tom S.", "This place has kick ass pad Thai. Also tried the rad na it was pretty good as well. The fried egg rolls were crispy and delicious. The proportions could probably be split into three meals. I wish they had I bigger menu, but what they offer seems to be pretty good. For a hole in the wall Asian cuisine that won't break the bank this is the place to go."], ["Joshua T.", "I ordered on the phone to avoid the wait because the food is decent and affordable. In still here 40 minutes later with no food. Not a good way to stay in business."], ["Jennifer H.", "Had to wait just a bit, but it was well worth it. Came in with a party of 11 and everybody had positive things to say about each meal. Would definitely come back again!"], ["Mark H.", "Much, much better than you'd expect. Non-greasy, made to order. Some of the freshest Pad Thai I ever had. For $10, you get A LOT of food. Looking forward to coming back. Don't let the low-brow ambiance fool you. This food is fantastic."], ["Shawn E.", "Worst Chinese AND Thai food in Columbia but don't worry the service is extra slow. This place is a stone's throw from my house but I've never had a decent or quick meal. Learned my lesson this time though. Never coming back."], ["Mary W.", "Food seemed fresher than most Chinese places particularly with the eggrolls that tasted homemade. \u00a0I got sweet and sour chicken and veggie fries rice. The rice was PHENOMENAL! The chicken was pretty typical but also seemed fresher than most places. I didn't like that they didn't have wontons but what they do have they do well."], ["Marko S.", "This is an old location for taste of china. \u00a0The new owners serve Thai food also. It is very well prepared. Fried bananas, drunken noodles, lo mein and Thai vegetables all excellent. \u00a0We had.a large family there and shared food. Cook willing to make most dishes vegetarian when possible."]], "China One Chinese Restaurant": [["Linda K.", "Really good braised wings! Crispy wings even with the sauce. The food was a bit salty but the braised wings were defiantly delicious. 6.75 +tax for a 7 piece with rice."], ["Denell J.", "Guy Spit in a drink and tried to serve it to me!! Hood spot needs to get shut down!!!!"], ["Pamela C.", "Braised wings & Pork fried rice!!! OMG!!! Best thing smokin....not in the best of neighborhoods but the food is good & it's my teenager's favorite...."]], "King's Chef Chinese Restaurant": [["Linda F.", "Delicious chinese food and you get more than what you paid for. How much better can it get?"], ["Pamela C.", "A \"C\" is on the door. \u00a0That should explain it all....as long as there a \"C\" on the door you won't have to worry about me spending any money here. \u00a0I don't have time to be getting sick from eating food....."]], "Chen's Chinese Restaurant I At Polo Plaza": [["Enrique C.", "Great taste! \u00a0The best from all other chain locations. \u00a0I will be back for more orange chicken."], ["Tina J.", "Haven't tasted the food yet, but the service is scandalous. \u00a0While we were ordering, the person at the counter answered the phone: seriously in the middle of our order, twice! \u00a0He then assured us that our order would be twenty minutes. \u00a0After 30 we are checking and it seems like our order hasn't even been started. \u00a0We were offered our money back. \u00a0No, what we want is service. \u00a0Hope the food is worth it!!!"], ["S S.", "Best take out Chinese in Columbia. They are always busy around dinner time, so definitely call in your order."], ["Eli A.", "Every time I come to school this is this best Chinese place to eat at..food is delish...customer service is amazing...prices perfect!!!"], ["DeMorian P.", "Great food food prices. I was looking for a Chinese place on this side of town and I think I found it. The staff is great and there are many choices to choose from."], ["Tessa G.", "I've been coming here for about 15 years and it continues to be some of the best non-fancy Chinese food in columbia. Their fried rice is always tasty. Food is nothing fancy but is always fresh. Same family has been running the restaurant since I've been going there."]]}
