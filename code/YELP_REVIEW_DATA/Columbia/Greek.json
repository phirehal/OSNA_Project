The cashier ended up serving my food and brought me a side of the rice as well to try at no charge! Nice! The gyro was loaded with juicy chicken, not overdone with seasoning but tasty. There was tazicki sauce on it but not a lot so I paid 20 cents for extra and I'm glad I did (I tend to like a lot of it). The roasted potatoes were flavorful but not my favorite since I tend to like them browned more. These were fully cooked and soft but not a hint of browning. The basmati rice was good but bland all by itself. If you got a meal where the meat and veggies were served over it then it'd be great. But as a side not so much. Gave them 4 stars just because the sides weren't spectacular. All in all it seemed like a pretty good value for the prices, great customer service and a nice ambience (I sat on the patio)."], ["Angie W.", "Customer service is good, Katrina is always smiling.Mediterranean salad, lemon chicken soup, dolmades, salmon are all delicious.The atmosphere is easy going and relaxed."], ["Mitch K.", "Really nice place with good menu, plenty of drink refills and lots of management attention asking if you need something and just checking on you.It is Greek and otherwise Mediterranean, as the title suggests, so they offer pitas, lots of salads and a variety of hot plates.

I wish the onions had been sliced thicker and I'm always up for more asparagus but I was still quite happy."], ["L R.", "Cool place. I have seen it all the time. A neighbor mentioned that it was good and today I was hankering for some Mediterranean, so figured why not and drove there from campus. The lunch time rush was pretty crowded. Not so much that it annoyed you, but there was a good enough wait which is always a nice sign. I had already peeked at the menu online and knew I wanted the dolmades since stuffed grape leaves are one of my favorite foods of all time. Anyway, the ordering process was really quick, ordered the dolmades plate and an unsweet tea. Just a little over $13 bucks, so not super cheap, but not expensive either. I asked if they would be able to see me if I went outside, and the very nice cashier said that they walk all over the place so they'd find me. :) I got my number and went outside.The food came out faster than I had anticipated. I was seated for five minutes before a server came out to give me my food. YAY. I was anticipating my dolmas all day so I saved them for last. The meal comes with a Greek salad, some dressing, their 'taziki' sauce, and a crispy pita wedge. The wedge is crisp, like a cracker, not soft and chewy like I would have preferred but it was still good. The salad was GREAT and the dressing was YUMMY. I really enjoyed that and next time I will get the greek salad and a protein. Then the dolmades. Unfortunately they disappointed me. :'( They weren't tightly wrapped and were awkward to eat as a finger food. The leaves kept unwraveling. I tried a knife and fork and that was worse. Oh well, I went with it. The 'seasoned' rice was yellow (turmeric?) and not very flavorful. The grape leaves didn't taste nice and brine-y like I like. But it was very filling thanks to all that rice. At the end of my meal, I realized that I didn't have a drink. I asked one of the runners and she said that I was supposed to pick it up on the counter, but no problem she would pick it up for me. She was quick on that. I usually get unsweet tea but she gave me a sweet (not her fault - I didn't think to specify) and it wasn't the usual diabetes in a cup that is the norm. Still too sweet for me, but palatable enough on this warm day. While I didn't like the dolmas too much the service was EXCELLENT and the staff and runners were just SO FRIENDLY and all smiles. It was a great experience and I will be back! Just remember to pick up your drink at the counter before you sit. ;)"], ["Gregory A.", "The food here is awesome! You will get addicted to their famous tomato chutney aioli sauce. I put it on everything! They also give you large portions.

I liked the atmosphere, the inside is decorated nicely and there are lots of large windows.I split an appetizer sampler wtih hummus, taziki dip, and dolmades. The hummus was chunky and tasty, seemingly made on-site. The taziki dip (a chunky version of taziki sauce) was great but the pita chips were too thin, cut too large, and over seasoned. I'm not sure why they aren't using flatbread or making the pita thicker, what they are doing just isn't working. If the chips had been better, I'd be much happier. The dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were tasty but difficult to eat. They were too big and kind of soft on the outside, but the inside was seasoned well and tasty.Also got the spanikopita \"roll ups\" - essentially 4 greek empanadas? The chicken was very tasty and juicy and came with a tomato salsa kind of thing on the side that was very good. The side tomato and cucumber salad was tasty and the tomatoes were BRIGHT red, obviously very very fresh and ripe.One annoying thing: the staff behind the counter has to get you a drink.

The salad was iceberg lettuce, store bought feta cheese with two tomatoes and a rip off dressing they called Greek. It was $9 and I could've just bought the ingredients at the store for cheaper.

To my amazement, I see that I have never reviewed this restaurant that we have been coming to for over 30 years. We visit about twice a month or so and have rarely had anything to complain about. The service is always great, and the kooky decor only adds to it's local charm. Almost without exception, their portions are so large that I have enough left for a meal the next day. Their large salads, although not my personal favorite, are famous for their size and popularity. Their pizza is the best in Columbia, in my opinion, but only if you like cheese. Of their pizzas, the Greek pizza is just scrumptious, but only if you like feta. If I had to pick a favorite for value and taste, it would have to be a draw between their beef souvlaki platter and their gyro platter. Their greek potatoes are now excellent thanks to a recipe change quite some time ago. We love Mediterranean food, and have been to every Greek or Mediterranean or Lebanese or Syrian restaurant in Columbia. Some are more \"gourmet\" than Zorba's and I love them. But for a great blend of Greek and Italian with super value, convenience, and local flavor nothing beats Zorba's in our eyes."], ["Bob H.", "This restaurant is the one of the fastest restaurants that I have ever been to.I ordered water and I ordered the chicken tips for lunch.Before I got my water I already received my chicken tips the salad.

The almond added an extra sweetness to the cheese that made it feel more like a dessert but not so overdone that I couldn't justify eating it as an appHummus-I know, sounds boring. But it was so so fresh and if it wasn't homemade then they definitely fooled me. Only downside is it was a little heavy on the oil for my taste, but others may prefer that. Then we proceeded to order the bruschetta, which was a plate of two medium size slices of toasted baguette covered with a heaping of one of my favorite types of tomato dishes. We finished things off with the salmon, which wasn't particularly seasoned, but was so fresh and cooked just the right amount that I didn't even need the sauce they served with it on the side.

We made reservations which was nice because the place is quite small, a lot smaller than we expected. We were sat in a small room in the back against the wall which gave us some privacy but for a tapas place the table was very small. You would think when needing to accommodate 5-6 plates at one time that they would select larger ones.We started with the bruschetta which was really good. Two large pieces of French bread topped with a lot of tomatoes and a thick balsamic vinegar. We then had the olive plate which I loved, but I never met an olive I didn't like so maybe that's just me. We then had the Moorish pork kabobs with gorgonzola fondue for dipping; warm almond brie with mango chutney; gambas (spicy shrimp with roma tomatoes, sherry, bacon & garlic); and the garlic-parmesan fries with spicy aioli. We also ordered the petite filet mignon but our waitress never brought it out and we were full so we told her to just forget it. Overall our food was delicious and filling. With those 5 plates (olive plate doesn't count) we were SO full. Plenty of food for two. The service was great; our waitress was so nice and knowledgeable and made great recommendations.

My husband and I have been going here regularly for at least 6 years. We LOVE the food and atmosphere, and in all times past, the service. Tonight we went in for dinner, with a reservation, and were taken into the back room to be seated. The hostess asked if the table was okay, and my husband asked if it would be possible for us to sit in the front part of the restaurant. This was met with an undisguised eye roll and sigh that was loud enough for me to ask, \"Is that a problem?\" The hostess responded, in a clearly mocking tone, \"No problem at all.\" She proceeded to seat us only one table away from the hostess stand (which was fine) and then discuss my response to her eye roll and sigh, quite loudly, with the other staff (which was NOT fine). This was all done loudly enough that my husband then asked the server, who was included in the hostess stand conversation, if our seating was a problem. Initially, I took this quite personally, but as we sat and continued with our meal, I saw this process repeated with at least half of the customers that were seated. Eye rolls, loud discussion among the staff nearly mocking the patrons, and general attitude of annoyance from the staff. We have never left the restaurant without ordering at least one bottle of wine, several orders of tapas, and at least two desserts. I was so uncomfortable by the end of our meal that we opted to head to Kaminsky's for after dinner drinks and dessert. (Which, by the way, was FANTASTIC!)

I've recommended it to several friends. Today (10/9/2014) at lunch was the worst experience I had ever had there. I would give it one star if the food I ordered was awful. However, the tasty salmon burger and Parmesan fries are the ONLY things keeping this from being a one star review.I arrived and there was a party of 8, however they were already in the process of having their meal served to them. I placed my order and waited and waited and waited. Did I mention I waited? By this time, other diners had come to the restaurant and were seated and ordered. The place was nowhere near being packed, mind you. As I continued to wait, a 4-top, 3-top, and 2-top (all arriving after me) had already been served. The 8-top that was having food delivered to their table had long since finished eating and had left. The only table besides mine that hadn't been served their lunch was a 3-top that arrived much later than me. I think my server was avoiding me since he rarely came to check on me or when he did, would assure me that my salmon burger was on the way. At this rate, I'm thinking that my salmon is still on a boat off the coast of Alaska. So the food finally appears AFTER ONE HOUR. And the salmon burger is piping hot, so it was comforting to know that it had just been cooked and hadn't been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes, however, this means that somehow my order was the next to the last put in with the kitchen. I normally take photos of my food so I can post them to yelp, but given the serious rumbling in my stomach, the primal urge to feed took over. My server was completely oblivious to the fact that I had been clearly waiting and inexcusably long time. I think he may have been high or had a NyQuil hangover since I didn't get the sense he was 'all there' today. Needless to say, Gervais and Vine is one of my favorite places for happy hour with girlfriends or for a low key lunch, however today's experience greatly disappointed me."], ["Sherrie M.", "The food was great from what we were able to enjoy as we we forced to cut our dinning experience short do to an annoyingly LOUD patron.

It was simple but well seasoned, reminding me of Mexican-style rice. I also made sure to sample the fresh-made hummus and cornichons. (Love those!) The hummus had a nice, subtle mustard flavor.

The best summation is to describe the pizza we ordered as one of our dishes. The Greek Pizza we ordered was not well cooked and in some ways could be considered soft. The dough just was not cooked well enough to serve as a base for the ingredients nor were the ingredients tasty enough to serve as the toppings alone. With tapas food, each ingredient, each dish, must boldly carry itself with spices and flavors.

To give you an idea, we sat down at 8, and we didn't leave until 10:30p.m. And we all only had 1 or 2 drinks - it wasn't a crazy party by any means. The food is ok - nothing special, at all. The cheese plate is something you could easily create yourself from Publix. I had the scallops last time and they were horrible. They were served cold and I felt like they had been sitting awhile.

The filet tasted as though it was thrown on the grill haphazardly after being cut. It was dry and boring. The brussels were overcooked and the goat cheese was an unnecessary addition. The bacon worked though. Notwithstanding slow service and a bit of disappointment with some of the dishes the wine selection was quite interesting.

About 10 years ago, my job had me traveling in this area a few months out of the year. I got to know the restaurants in Columbia very well! Gervais & Vine was one of my favorites! For the uninitiated, tapas consists of small portions of different dishes meant to share, like appetizers, but the whole meal is that way! Today was a blast from the past of sorts! I started with an Ensalada Verde, basically mixed greens w/ balsamic vinaigrette. Next I tried Grilled Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Feta and a White Balsamic Reduction. This was a stretch for me because I've never had Brussels Sprouts before. I have to say, personally, that the addition of the other ingredients didn't make it particularly palatable. I only managed to eat two of the ten sprouts! Luckily, the waiter was able to remove it, even though I was perfectly ok with it remaining on the ticket. I had to add Garlic Parmesan fries mainly to get the taste of Brussels Sprouts out of my mouth and rounded out the dinner with Herb Grilled Lamb Chops! Perfection!

My first experience at Gervais & Vine consisted of many different plates of overpriced, undersized, and mediocre (at best) food that was shared between a group of six friends. We came for \"jazz night\", which was listed at two different times on the menu and website, but that wasn't an issue since there was no jazz anyway. Our waiter told us that sometimes they play jazz over the sound system, but that there hadn't actually been a live jazz band in a long time. When asked how their sangria was (it is watery, flavorless, no fruit), our waiter told us it would \"get us drunk\", and while we were all pretty taken back by this unprofessional remark at the time, in hindsight- I wish it did. Perhaps then we would have been intoxicated enough to not care about the rubbery, insipid cheese plate and cold empanadas. Our group of friends had multiple Living Social deals between us, so we all fought over who could use their's on the check (only 1 per table), because nobody wanted to go back. Unfortunately, I did not win that battle, so a couple of weeks later my girlfriend and I went back to burn the Living Social deal on some wine and dessert because how bad can that be, right? Bad. It can be real bad. After a brief glance at the uninspiring, grossly overpriced wine menu, we decided on ordering a couple of glasses of port to go along with dessert. Being a fan of both the Sandeman Ruby and Sandeman Tawney ports (which they had listed on their menu), I asked our waitress how the Sandeman Reserve compared to the two. Laughing, the waitress told us that she has no idea, because \"usually, people don't ask about the dessert wines so we sort of just pour them whatever\". She said that she wasn't even sure if they actually had those wines in stock. Nevertheless, she went in the back to see if she could find out any more information on it, and came back with a sample for me to try. She said they did not have the Ruby nor the Tawney in stock, and the wine I was about to taste wasn't actually a Sandeman Reserve, it was \"something else that they just say is Sandeman\". After I asked what wine it was then, she went in the back to fetch the bottle, came back with it, placed it down on the table, and said, \"this one.\" For dessert, we ended up ordering the almond joy bread pudding, which was miserable as well.

On a different occasion I ordered the hummus and salad plate and was disappointed to find only 6 small pieces of pita bread that wasn't nearly enough to finish the hummus with.

Shortly after we arrived, I thought: Let's check Yelp and see what folks say we shouldn't miss here. \u00a0I was shocked at some of the vitriol from what appeared to be people who must not dine out very often. \u00a0For example, if you show up at 2:30 in the afternoon, you shouldn't be surprised that a restaurant (closing down lunch, and getting ready for the dinner service) can't accommodate your large party. There's more I could say about the poor reviews, but that's not why you should give this spot a chance.I've learned with my bizarre collection of food allergies (colitis... so no bell peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, radishes, meat) and other things I have to avoid (diabetes... white rice) to let wait staff know as soon as we arrive. Our waitress quickly figured out which foods to make sure I avoided, and made some suggestions that turned out to be real winners. \u00a0My husband and I made dinner of several appetizers. We split the Feta \u00a0Kai Elies, a feta cheese and Kalamata olives sampler, as well as the spanakopita (technically spanikotyropita, since it contains cheese) which had a tomato and basil cause with surprising textures, that was baked into an equally surprising pastry shell. \u00a0That dish by itself will bring us back -- so many other spanakopita offerings in and around the Soda City are so bland and flat. I thoroughly enjoyed the Buranee Kado, a dish of fresh pumpkin, olive oil, and other spices; I haven't seen anything else like it in this town. \u00a0I'm willing to guess that the tzatziki sauce (alas, allergies) would have made it even better. \u00a0My husband enjoyed the beef sambosa, with more perfectly prepared pastry, filling, sauces (tomato and red pepper and taziki) and a sprinkling of cheese. \u00a0The wine list was consistent with what you might expect in a strip shopping center, which is why they got 3 stars (I'd give 3.5 if Yelp would let me). \u00a0They've put their energies into handcrafting perfect portions of food, at least the ones we tried. \u00a0This included the piece of baklava we split for dessert. In my experience, other \"Greek\" places on Sunset (Grecian Gardens and Nick's House of Pizza) are about as \"Greek\" as Zorba's or even Zesto's.Moe has done a nice job of interpreting the cuisine of his parents' homelands (Greece and Turkey) rather than relying on a sprinkling of feta cheese over iceberg lettuce to stand as proxy for real Greek cuisine. \u00a0Check them out!"], ["Adam B.

Do they like to show only the bad ones? This is a good Greek restaurant."], ["Rachel O.", "If you are on 378 and looking for Greek food I'd suggest you keep driving and go to Grecian Gardens.Ariana's has blue walls with a giant mural, a carpet on another wall and gold/bronze plates on another wall. \u00a0Pretty typical decor. \u00a0They had fake flowers in vases with water (???) but the plates, glassware and napkins were nice. \u00a0I liked the style of them. \u00a0They have a handful of booths and about the same number of tables. \u00a0It's a small restaurant.We stopped in for a late lunch. \u00a0It was around 2:30pm. \u00a0There were only 3 other tables while we were there. \u00a0When we arrived all but 2 tables were taken or dirty so had a bit of a limited selection of where to sit. \u00a0There seemed to be a meeting going on at the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen. We took a seat and a waitress came over quickly to take our drink orders. \u00a0We received our drinks from a new waitress and ordered our food. \u00a0I almost immediately received my salad (premade?). \u00a0It arrived in a small bowl that seemed better fit for an appetizer or soup. \u00a0The salad was overflowing out \u00a0of the bowl and some of the cheese and dressing dripped on the table when the waitress sat the bowl down. \u00a0As carefully as I could , I began eating it but everything was falling out of the bowl. \u00a0I used my napkin to wipe it up and it was such a mess that I had to ask for a new napkin. \u00a0 The salad was fine. \u00a0Typical Greek salad. \u00a0I did try the \"Turkish\" salad dressing which was a bit different but I won't miss it. After waiting about 25 minutes our Spanakopita appetizer came. \u00a0I honestly can't imagine what took so long because it was 4 small pieces and a little bowl of marinara. \u00a0The spanakopita was crispy on the edges of the filo but gooey in the center. \u00a0This led me to think that they are frozen. \u00a0I've definitely had better frozen ones from the grocery store. \u00a0Also, for the price of this appetizer I expected a lot more. \u00a0I almost could have bought an entire extra meal for what I paid for the app.We then received our meals. \u00a0First off, the plates were \"decorated\" along the edges with stretched out slices of brown tinted peppers and some herbs. \u00a0It was very unappetizing and I immediately removed it from my plate. \u00a0I had the chicken souvlaki platter. \u00a0It consisted of 6 bite sized pieces of over seasoned chicken on top of plain white rice with a side of Greek potatoes (to me they seemed more like boiled potatoes with tomato sauce poured over it) and 2 pieces of pita bread. \u00a0Boyfriend had salmon which was a small, overcooked (his word) filet on top of white rice. \u00a0We both had tzatziki sauce. It is my favorite sauce by far and so I ordered an extra cup. That was a waste because it was the worst I have ever had. \u00a0It was incredibly runny (it wouldn't even stay on the pita bread I tried dipping it into) and was virtually flavorless. The ambiance was nonexistent. \u00a0The waitresses were cleaning the tables for the last half of the time we were there but never seemed to make much progress. They moved all the dirty plates onto one of the tables in the dining room instead of taking them to the kitchen and then tried to wipe down all the remaining tables and then sweep the floor which was a mess. \u00a0About 2 minutes before we left they turned on music. And I don't understand this part... all of the plates left water all over the table. \u00a0Condensation kept accumulating under them and the table was a mess. \u00a0Same thing with the glasses and no coasters were provided.When we asked for our check the waitress asked how everything was. \u00a0We told her it was OK. \u00a0It was. The food was fine. \u00a0I feel like I over paid considering the quality and the portion size but it wasn't bad. I ate it. \u00a0She then immediately walked to who I believe was the manager and whispered something to him and then he came over to ask us how everything was. \u00a0When I said it was fine he then said that the waitress indicated to him that we felt something was wrong. \u00a0I told him \u00a0that it was fine. \u00a0And it was. \u00a0It was fine. \u00a0But do you want fine? No. \u00a0You return to places that are great and Ariana's was definitely not great or even good. \u00a0 I've had much better for less money at every other Greek restaurant I've been to in Columbia. \u00a0Let's just say that we will not be returning and would suggest you don't waste your time."], ["Rane W.", "Moved from Pittsburgh where we had good Mediterranean.

That's what he said we ought to ask for every time we visit. Mo likes to walk around the tables and talk to the customers, and I think that makes a big difference to the dining experience.

See photos - I should've snapped one of the app and salad, they were gorgeous. My wife's opinion of her Gyro Wrap? \"OMG, good.\" And my Falafel Wrap was perfect. Again, even distribution of ingredients is key for me and they nail it. We took some to go because the portions exceed the average appetite but not the wallet. This place is underrated. They've got some local competition from other popular Mediterranean joints but they are slightly unique in some subtle ways. See for yourself. I think they get a bad wrap sometimes because the service is spotty but it's typical of a restaurant this size that doesn't have a ton of money to throw around and over staff with blonde cheerleader types who couldn't care less.

Expressing our displeasure in the consistency in the online menu versus reality, the owner then told me that my salad, which COMES FREE AT LUNCH TIME, cost me an additional $3.00 on top of my FOURTEEN DOLLAR eggplant parm.

But I have to be honest so people who read this will get a more accurate picture of the experience at Arabesque.I went there with my wife and another married couple that loves Lebanese cuisine. The first thing that went wrong, although small, was that they were out of the only Lebanese beer they carried. It's a Lebanese restaurant, they had Lebanese beer on the menu, but were out of it. This is a very small setback, although a little disappointing. But it turns out, they were out of a lot of beers that were on the menu that they didn't have so they server had to make a hand-written list of available beers, which was appreciated. Second, the server, although very nice, was scatter-brained. She was extremely nice but she kept forgetting things, giving people wrong drinks, leaving lots of plates and empty bottles on the table, and seeming very unsure of what she was doing and saying. She would start to say something, then say \"never mind\". \u00a0But again, she was very polite. My food was pretty good, so there is nothing to complain about there. But my friends ordered a pizza and they put ground beef all over it even though it was only supposed to be on half the pizza. I love ground beef, but evidently one of them hated it and did not want it. The server said it might take a while to make another one since they were busy. What she should have said was that they will make another one immediately since we had already been there a long time before it got busy. The manager did come out and say she would take it off the bill, which was very kind of her. And, she offered each one of us a free drink, which seemed awesome at the time. You're probably wondering why in the world I would only give it two stars at this point. I'll get to that. When the bill came, I was charged full price for an appetizer even though it was supposed to be half price due to happy hour. And the thing that got me was that I was billed for something that I didn't even order. On the menu, they have beef kabobs for $13, and beef tenderloin kabobs for $16. I ordered the beef kabobs for $13 but was billed for the beef tenderloin kebabs. I showed the server the appetizer discrepancy and where I was billed for the wrong item. She admitted that the appetizer should be half off and also admitted that she did bill me for the wrong item. She said she rung it in as the beef tenderloin and that is what I did get, but she remembered that I only said beef kebab, not tenderloin. She came back to the table with the amended check and said the manager was willing to take half off the appetizer but would not change the charge for the beef tenderloin even though we all know I did not order it. Had I known it was the beef tenderloin, I would have said something. I was eating it and it tasted no more tender than a sirloin steak, not a tenderloin. The manager personally came out to us when things went wrong at first, making things right. But when it came to wrongly billing me, she hid in the kitchen and let the server come out and deliver the bad news. I am the most forgiving and understanding restaurant patron, but the manager was basically saying that I was lying. The server even told her just to take it out of her tip, which I told her that I was NOT going to do. This was something I could not deal with, although I actually did and paid the dang bill. The free drinks for the screw ups were a nice gesture, but telling me that the bill would not be corrected to accurately depict what I actually ordered crossed the line. The manager just lost a future customer over $3. She told the server that she had already taken enough off the bill. The service was slow, the server kept forgetting things and seemed frazzled the entire time, and food came out incorrectly. All that would have been fine until the manager insisted I pay for something I did not order. That was an unwise move because I will never go back now. And I'll tell everybody I know never to go there. $3 is almost nothing to me. But not changing the bill to what I actually ordered because I ate it unknowingly wasn't cool. The server messed up, the manager was unwilling to make it right. The pizza my friends ordered was mediocre. My food was pretty dang good, not great though. But the manager insinuating I was a liar by not making the bill right and hiding in the back to let the server tell me.....well, that is pathetic and disrespectful. And that is just bad business."], ["Stephanie S.", "Amazing food, fantastic service. They treat you like family.

One of the best ethnic cuisines in all of Columbia.The hummus is fantastic. I love the shawarma wrap."], ["Gilbert T.", "Wow this place was great. Tried the lamb shawarma wrap. It's was amazing. \u00a0Will def come again. The only reason I giving 3 stars is because the service wasn't that great. I get there before a waiter is about to go home and he didn't want to help me. He was waiting for someone else to get there so he could clock out. Then the waiter that ended up helping me took off to Starbucks while I was eating. I understand it's Sunday and I'm the only one here. But wtf really? He couldn't wait until I was done?"], ["Carl R.", "It didn't take long to try this place again. Another good experience.

Have to try Damascus bread too!"], ["Naomi R.", "Everything about our experience was wonderful! It's like eating at your Middle Eastern Grandmother's house. Well it was for us. Victoria prepared our food for us. We had the grape leaves and falafel for an appetizer. The grape leaves were perfect. Not too vinegary or oily. Falafel was fresh just like you find it in Jerusalem! We had the Damascus bread with lamb. Yummmmm..... The portion sizes were great and were fitting for the prices charged. Forget Al Amir. Arabesque is far above any Al Amir location which is run by the same owner anyhow. We are now Arabesque customers only!"], ["Maggie s.", "Fantastic as always. Beautiful day to sit outside and enjoy the hummus and very authentic swarma. Owners are always delightful and staff is very friendly."], ["Riz S.", "Amazing food with solid service. They're menu has something for everyone. If your a vegetarian they're falafel is crispy and delicious. Looking for ethnic fare? They're Damascus bread/Baba ghanouj/Hummus/grape leaves is filled with rich flavor and seems to be made with quality ingredients, all of which comes in the Arabesque sampler! You may not expect pizza to be a hot item at a Lebanese restaurant but it was amazing. Thin crust, beef pepperoni, chicken, and gyro meat all under a layer of melty mozzarella will make you weep in awe!"], ["Ken H.", "THE EXACT SAME MENU as Al Amir's right down the street EXCEPT everything here is about $5 dollars more expensive!

A candle store really!!?? (There is a newer random overpriced candle store nearby) I guess they thought they would \u00a0just change the name and raise the prices thinking no one would notice?? \u00a0How can anyone think this is acceptable!! Spend 30 cents more in gas and go to the same restaurant on Main st. a mile down the road For less! But at this point, really who cares if it saves you money... Do it on principle!!"], ["S H.", "I love the food here, specifically the falafel, veggie curry and hummus with damascus bread. I'm thrilled they are within walking distance to my home. :)That being said, do yourself a huge favor and do NOT go here if you are in any sort of hurry or ravenously hungry. Because you will have an angry, long wait. They have a more European approach to service and while that's great when you've got time to relax at one of their outdoor tables, it's not so great when you are hungry and pressed for time. (They do have one server that works very hard and I've seen him scrambling about trying to cover all of his tables while another server lazily half-skips to her smaller number of tables. It's a weird description, but if you've ever spoken with her, you'd understand what I mean.)This place is very vegan friendly as well, which always gets more respect from me. We love to get it for take-out or we'll often bring our dogs and sit on their patio. They are kind enough to provide water (and one time, treats!) for our babies. This location has changed names numerous times but the food is always the same. I'm not entirely sure what's going on, I just hope they stick around!"], ["Kara B.", "My boyfriend and I dropped into Arabesque so that we could switch it up from our typical wing night. We had THE BEST experience. Not only is the food very authentic and YUMMY, our server was great. By great, I mean she got my email address so that she can email me about the local middle eastern grocery store here in Columbia, made fantastic recommendations and explained how things were made and about the ingredients, etc. This is definitely a great date night spot, but a little on the pricier side. Our meal: Babaganoush, Fatoush Salad, Mussles & Damascus Bread, Lamb Shawarma, Lebanese beer"], ["Laura H.", "I want SO badly to love this restaurant. Growing up in a Lebanese family left me with very high standards for this type of cuisine and let me just say that the food here is not the problem. It is actually the only reason our party did not walk out of the restaurant after a nearly 2.5 hour wait for our meals. The birthday girl ended up taking her entree in a to-go box because it was such an ordeal. \u00a0Our appetizers (all dips and spreads) took an hour to make it to our table and \u00a0the Damascus bread we were to eat it with took 15 more minutes. \u00a0That left us all staring at a bunch of food we weren't able to eat. \u00a0Entrees were an hour longer and one of them came out cold. Our waitress was young and inexperienced but apologized profusely as anyone should. \u00a0Mind you, we were only one of two tables in the entire restaurant. \u00a0I don't expect to ever return to this establishment solely based on the fact that if I wanted to wait 2.5 hours on Lebanese food, I would just drive the distance to Leila's in Charleston and save myself the disappointment."], ["Chuck W.", "I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. They have middle eastern music playing softly over the intercom which helps set the mood. The wait staff is VERY friendly. The humus is by far the best I have ever eaten. I had the beef tips over rice. Came with a salad. Everything was seasoned to perfection. I was a little skeptical of Lebanese food, because to be honesty, I was not really sure what it was. So glad I tried it. There was six in our party. We all love it.

I am not sure where the commenter Katie D. ate, but I can assure you that I have eaten at Arabesque over a dozen times and never had a bad experience. Yes, there are times when they are busy, but a meal is to be enjoyed, not rushed through at all costs to hurry back to work.

Grecian Gardens didn't have it and I've not found it anywhere other than the old Santorini's out in NE Cola, which has been closed now for a couple of years. \u00a0Even Santorini's wasn't that good as they served it with a marinara sauce, rather than just flaming it with ouzo and lemon. \u00a0But that's another story.Regarding Grecian Gardens, I had been there for lunch with co-workers about 10 years ago and can't even remember what I had, but I thought I'd give it a try on a Friday night. \u00a0We were surprised that they had quite a bit of open tables at 7:30PM on a Friday. \u00a0We were seated promptly in a booth and a server immediately took our order. \u00a0As with a lot of Greek restaurants, they have a very full menu, with a lot to choose from. \u00a0The atmosphere is sort of a diner type atmosphere, booths and tables, and gives a certain feel unlike a fancy intimate restaurant.Based on reading other reviews my wife and friend both ordered the baked half chicken with green beans as a side. \u00a0I usually don't order Prime Rib but decided to give it a try. \u00a0My other neighbor ordered baked Tilapia and shrimp. \u00a0The girls won hands down. \u00a0The chicken was fabulous. \u00a0Very tender and juicy. \u00a0I would order this next time. \u00a0I ordered my Prime Rib medium to medium rare and it came out well done. \u00a0The taste was good but definitely was well done. \u00a0I'd order it again, but make sure I asked for it medium rare. \u00a0The neighbor liked his Tilapia/Shrimp. \u00a0We all agreed that the Chicken was the best meal. \u00a0Prices were very reasonable and both the women loved the green beans. \u00a0Service was very responsive and the only mistake of the night was that our waiter forgot to put the Tilapia/Shrimp order in with our meal so it came out about 8 minutes after the three of us had been served. \u00a0The waiter apologized \u00a0and was very nice about it being his mistake. \u00a0I would go back here just try the Baked Chicken. \u00a0The pizza looked very good so we'd like to try that also.BTW - the bread they served before dinner was some of the freshest bread that I've had at any restaurant in Cola. Excellent.Someone.... please learn how to make Saganaki and put it on the menu. \u00a0In Chicago the Greek Isles and other places always have Lamb as a special. \u00a0I would always order the nightly special of lamb regardless of what it was...it was always the best. \u00a0Wish I could find a similiar place in Cola!"], ["Evelyn E.", "Went to columbia to visit friends decided to try out greek food.

It's a lot of food, so I eat half of the chicken and the Greek salad that comes with it at the restaurant, and take the other half of the chicken home along with the vegetables or Greek potatoes. 2. Broiled salmon. So delicious. I get it with the Greek rice and squeeze lemon all over both. 3. Prime rib. I get it medium rare and it's \u00a0super tender and one of my favorites when I crave red meat. 4. Cheeseburger. It's a huge, fresh, hand pressed patty and it comes with steak fries and it's cheaper than you would get at a fast food place. If you want a burger, this is a great place to go that you might not immediately think of. 5. Small pizza with gyro meat, feta cheese, pepperoncini, tomato, and onions. The crust is made out of the same dough as the fresh bread they serve with the meals, and there is something else I can't put my finger on, but it's the best pizza in town.

My pita bread had already fallen apart by the time my sandwich came to the table and the steak kabobs inside had spilled out, there was way too much yogurt sauce on the kababs that it overpowered any flavor the meat may have had. Although the vegetables were fresh, they were cut and place haphazardly in the sandwich where i ended up having to eat the kababs and veggies like I would a steak salad. the bread lay in a soupy mess at the bottom of the plate.

The atmosphere is nice and sunny, it's in a house and very open with a large patio to eat on. There is a long list of fresh lebanese drinks so skip the soda! I had a very unusually tasty mint/rose/lime/orange (something else I'm forgetting) lemonade. I had vegetarian meze plate and my favorite part was the falafels they were well seasoned \u00a0and well beyond the typical bland friend chick pea. I also liked their hummus a lot (I prefered it to the babaganoush) it was seasoned so tastfully (I got a stong taste of tahini, cumin ?, and sumac) \u00a0~ again well beyond what hummus usually is (bland mashed chick peas)."], ["Swetha G.", "Don't walk, jog, or run to this place, jump in your car and step on the gas. Seriously! I don't know where to start with Elie's, you will be so excited after you have a meal there, before you even leave, you will already be planning your second trip, it IS THAAAAT good! First off, SUPER accommodating. Our group was close to 25 and they basically reserved about 70% of their space for us! Not only that, they even split checks! We had two servers regularly checking in on us and keeping up with our fast and crazy pace. Almost everyone in our party ordered an appetizer (some even two!), a drink, an entree, and dessert. Some people were getting multiple drinks. I don't know how they did it, but they didn't miss a beat, it was impressive! The atmosphere is simple and small. The whole place is pretty tiny with not a lot of decor, but after eating their food, you can tell where the real investment in Elie's is. So on to the most important part - the food! Oh my gosh, there are just too few places in Columbia that give you that kick and that feeling of consistent foodgasms, but Elie's will leave you MORE than satisfied but wanting more at the same time, if that's possible. On just my side of the table, amongst 5 very hungry people, we probably sampled close to 40% of the menu in just our first setting. Everything, I mean, EVERYTHING, was insanely delicious! We couldn't stop throwing food in our mouth, like vultures, like crazy people who hadn't eaten in years, we were on a food gorging marathon, it was absolutely ridiculous. I loved all the appetizers I tried, but the spinach and feta pie was a home-run. I ordered the eggplant pita for my entree, and it was soo excellently seasoned and cooked, though at that point, I had inhaled four different appetizers and was completely stuffed, I couldn't control myself and still finished my meal! We were on a roll and went ahead and got all three desserts on the menu and were lucky enough to sample their Lebanese baklava (it IS better than Greek baklava imo!), their strawberry cake (YUM, YUM!), and even their dark chocolate cake (oooh lala!). I wish I had found out the name of the cook, because that man or woman back there, really knew what they were doing, everything was sooo freakin absolutely amazing. I will absolutely without a doubt go back. Oh and people in our group who had never had Lebanese or Middle Eastern food and came out loved everything they ordered as well. The food pleased everyone!"], ["Eva F.", "Excellent food!"], ["M D.", "There needs to be another star added to this. \u00a0This place is Columbia's hidden treasure. \u00a0The food is so fresh and so flavorful! \u00a0Dont even get me started on the deserts... \u00a0They are beyond amazing! \u00a0A fair warning about the coffee though... you wont sleep for a week once you drink it.Service is superb and the quality of the food is the best. \u00a0I have spent 5 times as much on some restaurants in Columbia, but only for a quarter of the amount of satisfaction I get from here."], ["Brandon F.", "Authentic food great lunch prices and portion sizes. Always a good favorite dish is the Shish Taouk! Try it!!!"], ["Rebekah P.", "Delicious creative fare with excellent service. Heads and Tails above the apathetic renderings of Al-amir and the Mediterranean Cafe. I actually like the aforementioned restaurants but Elie's puts them in the shade. I wish the location was more in the mainstream so it would get more recognition. If you like food that is adventurousand not afraid to be bold, give Elie's a chance. With a preponderance of Greek restaurants is the area, this place outshines them all in their Mediterranean cuisine. I suggest they they give restaurant.com or groupon a chance to spread the word."]], "Bellis House of Pizza": [["Mrs. C.", "I could seriously eat their Greek salad with grilled chicken and house dressing daily. It's that delicious and huge!!! Also, try their baklava cheesecake. Holy. Crap!!! So, so good!!! The owners and staff are incredibly nice and are great at their jobs. Go here and eat!"], ["John G.", "I've beenhere a few times now and have always experienced good food with fast and friendly service.I definitely recommend."], ["Clay L.", "This was a pleasant surprise while visiting some friends in Columbia. Bellis has a good mix of items on their menu, from burgers and gyros to moussaka and pizza Bellis has a variety of food to offer.I went off on a limb and decided to try their greek burger. This ended up being a fantastic option with a great sized burger that had feta/bacon/lettuce/tomato/and some of their greek dressing on it.The burger had a fantastic mix of flavors, the meat was juicy and the dressing gave it some good acidity and tang. The only downside to the meal was the fries, they were ok, nothing special just frozen steak fries.Everyone at the table left happy, if were in the area again I could see us going back."], ["Amy Lauren S.", "Last weekend, my husband and I were in Lexington with some friends and we went out to Belli's House of Pizza for dinner. Our friends went there for pizza earlier in the week and liked it, and they had the right idea. Belli's is a local joint and seems to be family-owned, mom and pop, and the food was delicious. Like the name says, it's pizza restaurant, but they also serve Greek food like sandwiches, salads, calzones, and traditional Greek dishes like moussaka, souvlaki, gyros, and spanokopita. If you're not in the mood for pizza, you should still check it out because they offer a LOT of menu options. I had the spanokopita entree, which came with garlic bread and a house salad. The house salads are simple, they don't come with feta (but you can order it- we did), but the dressing is delicious. I like how it came on the side, and all of us agreed it was some of the best Greek dressing we've had. The salads were pretty large and came out quickly. The garlic bread was also buttery, hot, and tasty. The spanokopita I had was some of the best I have tried. The phylo dough was light and fluffy, and it was full of spinach. I could not finish my spanokopita but it was still good reheated the next day. It was a huge piece portion for only $10.95. Belli's is a great place for authentic Greek food- or many other foods- on a budget. The restaurant is not super fancy on the outside or inside, but it is one of those hidden gems beside a Publix in a shopping center. We would definitely return the next time we're in the area."], ["Emily E.", "Meh. \u00a0Greek salad was just OK. \u00a0Dressing needed more flavor. \u00a0Kept adding more to no avail. \u00a0Got the Tuscan pizza and it was good but prices here and atmosphere won't entice me to return."], ["Russel G.", "Delisous calamari and the calzone we had was amazing. Friendly staff. Definitely will go back"], ["Keegan C.", "This is a freat go to for greek pizza. Very friendly family owned. I usually opt for the Greek salad and a Pepperoni Pizza, excellent crust. I have also tried some of the pasta dishes all of which were delicious"], ["Ms. P Y.", "This place is awesome great customer service the menu is exceptional, so many item to choose from wonderful atmosphere, will definitely be back the people are very friendly"], ["Lillian C.", "Portions are ample, service is fantastic (local mom and pop joint.) Free Captain's Wafers at the table. Calamari is great (and quite affordable) and pizza looks pretty decent, but I'd steer clear of the Greek though. The kebab tasted a bit freezer burned and the chicken was something that could have been executed in a college dorm room (used to make something remarkably similar as an undergrad using herbs de provence and the chicken tenderloins). Pita is the standard food service style flatbreads you get a gyro joint. I cried a little on the inside that two mediocre greek entrees and a calamari basket came out to 37 dollars. Next time, I'll do as the locals and order pizza."], ["Jennifer B.", "Its ok....not a fan of the goo on a cracker...at least bring a plate. Pizza was solid but better is down the road."], ["Celeste P.", "We had the Greek pizza and it was very tasty and mouthwatering. \u00a0Highly recommend this restaurant. They make a salad dressing that is outstanding."], ["Kelley H.", "So much more than pizza!!! Great authentic Greek & Italian dinners. Wine & beer as well. Very needed here in Lexington."], ["Ralph S.", "Excellent!! We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on our way to VA. We reviewed Yelp for local restaurants and found Bellis. \u00a0It was close and it had gotten good reviews. My wife, Susan, was craving Greek cuisine so we ordered take out.  \u00a0 \u00a0I wish they had told us about their specials on the phone. \u00a0When I walked in I read they were featuring potato soup and liver and onions. \u00a0I would have ordered the liver and onions special but we had already placed our order. I did, however, get the soup to go, Lamb Gyro, and souvlaki. All terrific. \u00a0 \u00a0We wanted to eat in the room after a five hour trip.  \u00a0 The staff was very friendly and attentive. \u00a0I, of course, tipped the young waitress very well \u00a0who bagged our food and made certain it was correct. I was very happy."], ["Greg P.", "Great food with exceptional service. I had the Lasagna. My wife had the souvlaki. We were both very pleased and will certainly return when we get the chance."], ["Rocky R.", "There is nothing bad on the menu. \u00a0You can't go wrong with the house special or buffalo chicken pizza. \u00a0The super sub with house dressing hits the spot no matter if it's for lunch or dinner.Make sure to try the house dressing on some crackers located on every table. \u00a0It's addicting. \u00a0This is the favorite Greek restaurant my wife and I go to and go there at least once a week."], ["Wardlaw F.", "Some of the best food in the area. This place is much bigger than it looks, has a really friendly and direct staff as well as a feeling of family. Will be a constant place for us"], ["Joel W.", "Dinner: gyro sandwich, potatoes and salad. Food was good, not mind-blowing, but good. Service was fine, restaurant is nice inside, very comfy. Good crowd. I would go back."], ["Rebekah P.", "Great little place at the old Parthenon location. \u00a0This has a very small store front, so that you are very surprised at how large it really is when you walk in the door. So far, we have only eaten there once, but we will definitely be back. typical Italian and Greek mash up with salads, subs and burgers added for good measure. \u00a0We have not had their pizza yet, but going by the steady stream of customers coming in to pick up their take-out orders, it must be pretty darn good! Casual but not divey. \u00a0We felt right at home. Can't wait to try some more dishes on their menu, and of course, the pizza."], ["Brandy W.", "Bellis is now my favorite local pizza. \u00a0It may be the best in the Columbia area, but I can't say that for sure. \u00a0We ordered a salad with Greek dressing and the Tuscan pizza with red pizza sauce instead of the olive oil base. \u00a0I have been a Ray's fan for a long time, but this even tops Ray's! \u00a0Their salads are MUCH better than Ray's and they have more interesting pizza choices/toppings. \u00a0The crispy light crust was so wonderful and dipped int eh Greek dressing I was in heaven. \u00a0I ate everyone else's crusts! \u00a0I can't believe this undiscovered jewel has been sitting in the where many other dinky takeout places once were! \u00a0The prices were a little better too."]]}
