The decor has been updated since the Al Amir days but some of the furniture still looks old and tired. They also added a dessert case but most of the dessert seem like different versions of the same baklava. And their baklava is only made with pistachios or cashew, no walnuts.

But, I would come back for the Damascus hummus, for sure."], ["Leigh B.", "Great food. For appetizer we ordered Damascus bread and Babaganous which was enough to share with 6 light eaters and fantastic. Highly recommend. As my main dish I ordered a gyro and feta salad.

My favorite is the beef gyro with pickled cabbage. I love pickled cabbage! It's pretty solid middle eastern food. I once ordered the curry chicken and didn't care for it.

The salad was served with warm pita bread - again very fresh and tasty. It was loaded with tomato and cucumber which was a plus as well. However, the entire salad was iceberg. For some reason I expected romaine or some other dark leafed variety in addition. There was almost too much feta cheese. I also expected kalamata olives - there was one. Yes - just one olive and one small \u00a0pepperoncini!

Two large pieces of French bread topped with a lot of tomatoes and a thick balsamic vinegar. We then had the olive plate which I loved, but I never met an olive I didn't like so maybe that's just me. We then had the Moorish pork kabobs with gorgonzola fondue for dipping; warm almond brie with mango chutney; gambas (spicy shrimp with roma tomatoes, sherry, bacon & garlic); and the garlic-parmesan fries with spicy aioli. We also ordered the petite filet mignon but our waitress never brought it out and we were full so we told her to just forget it. Overall our food was delicious and filling.

The hostess asked if the table was okay, and my husband asked if it would be possible for us to sit in the front part of the restaurant. This was met with an undisguised eye roll and sigh that was loud enough for me to ask, \"Is that a problem?\" The hostess responded, in a clearly mocking tone, \"No problem at all.\" She proceeded to seat us only one table away from the hostess stand (which was fine) and then discuss my response to her eye roll and sigh, quite loudly, with the other staff (which was NOT fine). This was all done loudly enough that my husband then asked the server, who was included in the hostess stand conversation, if our seating was a problem. Initially, I took this quite personally, but as we sat and continued with our meal, I saw this process repeated with at least half of the customers that were seated. Eye rolls, loud discussion among the staff nearly mocking the patrons, and general attitude of annoyance from the staff. We have never left the restaurant without ordering at least one bottle of wine, several orders of tapas, and at least two desserts. I was so uncomfortable by the end of our meal that we opted to head to Kaminsky's for after dinner drinks and dessert. (Which, by the way, was FANTASTIC!)

I've recommended it to several friends. Today (10/9/2014) at lunch was the worst experience I had ever had there. I would give it one star if the food I ordered was awful. However, the tasty salmon burger and Parmesan fries are the ONLY things keeping this from being a one star review.I arrived and there was a party of 8, however they were already in the process of having their meal served to them. I placed my order and waited and waited and waited. Did I mention I waited? By this time, other diners had come to the restaurant and were seated and ordered. The place was nowhere near being packed, mind you. As I continued to wait, a 4-top, 3-top, and 2-top (all arriving after me) had already been served. The 8-top that was having food delivered to their table had long since finished eating and had left. The only table besides mine that hadn't been served their lunch was a 3-top that arrived much later than me. I think my server was avoiding me since he rarely came to check on me or when he did, would assure me that my salmon burger was on the way. At this rate, I'm thinking that my salmon is still on a boat off the coast of Alaska. So the food finally appears AFTER ONE HOUR. And the salmon burger is piping hot, so it was comforting to know that it had just been cooked and hadn't been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes, however, this means that somehow my order was the next to the last put in with the kitchen. I normally take photos of my food so I can post them to yelp, but given the serious rumbling in my stomach, the primal urge to feed took over. My server was completely oblivious to the fact that I had been clearly waiting and inexcusably long time. I think he may have been high or had a NyQuil hangover since I didn't get the sense he was 'all there' today.

I have eaten here half a dozen times over the past couple of years and I have never ordered anything that was great. The menu is very large, but my favorite items are: Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops, Petite Filet Mignon, Warm Almond Brie, Beef Paillardes, and Spanish Asparagus. MMMM....my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it! They also boast a large wine menu, which pairs nicely with my love of wine! If you visit Gervais & Vine during the weekend you'll dine to live music. The atmosphere is quaint, trendy, yet fancy. I will tell you that the prices are a bit on the high end, so we usually reserve eating here for special occasions and celebrations. Have something to celebrate, but don't know where to go? Look no further than Gervais & Vine!!"], ["S H.", "Gervais & Vine did a GREAT job welcoming our large group last night. They prepared a special vegan menu, set out a small spread free of charge and the chef seemed authentically happy to have us. (I did feel badly for the server who handled several odd, borderline rude questions from a lady at my table though.) I ordered the artichoke paella and was very pleased with it. It was simple but well seasoned, reminding me of Mexican-style rice. I also made sure to sample the fresh-made hummus and cornichons. (Love those!) The hummus had a nice, subtle mustard flavor. Thanks again to G&V for accommodating all of us and doing it so well!"], ["Stephanie S.", "Enjoyed a night out with the girls here. The wine selection is top notch and so it the food! We ordered 6 different items and tried them all. The garlic Parmesan fries and Brussel sprouts were yummy! Definitely check it out!"], ["Leah M.", "Excellent wine list with lots of Spanish options. We always start with a spread tray and the Costa Brava never disappoints. Keep in mind tapas are smaller portions, so be prepared to order a couple of rounds. Fingerling potatoes are a personal favorite, and actually come with enough to split. Go on a wine tasting night to chat up the expert. The price is good, and atmosphere cozy."], ["Adam B. J.", "Gervais and Vine was great when it was the only place in town that did tapas (small plates), but as owners, chefs, and managers changed it's hard not to ignore so did the quality. \u00a0I fully understand the idea of tapas, but some of the dishes here are just two small for the price. \u00a0I realize that you go here for an experience and you order several small plates etc, etc,etc. \u00a0My last four dining experiences would have me ranking this lower, but the history of the place makes me say A-OK, as I'm sure I will be back again.

One of the best scallops we ever tried. Downside was the pizza, we had better, and it didn't tasted that great honestly. \u00a0It was the last thing to finished andOur waitress was friendly and even when the first pitch of sangria tasted watered down, \u00a0she fixed it and it tasted somewhat better.

I am hoping that our next visit here will improve our regards for the restaurant, but it will be some time before that happens. There was not anything that overly impressed us, service was slower than expected and the wine did not color my memories of Gervais & Vine in a positive light. The best summation is to describe the pizza we ordered as one of our dishes. The Greek Pizza we ordered was not well cooked and in some ways could be considered soft. The dough just was not cooked well enough to serve as a base for the ingredients nor were the ingredients tasty enough to serve as the toppings alone. With tapas food, each ingredient, each dish, must boldly carry itself with spices and flavors. The flavors here fell flat about halfway through the palate and only satiated our hunger, not our desire."], ["David A.", "Loved this place. My new favorite in Columbia. Went with my daughter and her friend. We ordered a bunch of different dishes/tapas to share. All different cuisines and everything was excellent.Highlights:The flatbread with pesto was very good. The crust has a unique texture and it works!The mussels with chorizo were great. Nice sized portion as well.The hummus seemed to be blended with edamame. Not sure, but it was delicious.Had to get something not so healthy. Been trying hard to stick to my plan. When you cheat it needs to be worth it. The eggplant fries were worth every bite!Scallops were recommended by our waitress. I am not always a fan. These can be fishy. These were awesome. Melt in your mouth.The chocolate cake for dessert was devoured as well.Service, by Roxie, was very good. My only suggestion would be to space out the dishes more.

There's a very nice man who I assume to be the manager, who serves as the hostess/bus boy/waiter - basically everything. He clearly needs some reliable help. The last time I was there was for a friend's birthday, we had a table of 7. When we finished our food, we waited so long for the check that a friend had to get up and go find our waitress. To give you an idea, we sat down at 8, and we didn't leave until 10:30p.m. And we all only had 1 or 2 drinks - it wasn't a crazy party by any means. The food is ok - nothing special, at all. The cheese plate is something you could easily create yourself from Publix. I had the scallops last time and they were horrible. They were served cold and I felt like they had been sitting awhile.

The filet tasted as though it was thrown on the grill haphazardly after being cut. It was dry and boring. The brussels were overcooked and the goat cheese was an unnecessary addition. The bacon worked though. Notwithstanding slow service and a bit of disappointment with some of the dishes the wine selection was quite interesting. Hopefully this was a one-off that won't occur again. Our advice: do dinner on a weeknight for a better experience! \u00a0 Stay away from the filet!"], ["Damon S.", "LOVE this restaurant!

About 10 years ago, my job had me traveling in this area a few months out of the year. I got to know the restaurants in Columbia very well! Gervais & Vine was one of my favorites! For the uninitiated, tapas consists of small portions of different dishes meant to share, like appetizers, but the whole meal is that way! Today was a blast from the past of sorts! I started with an Ensalada Verde, basically mixed greens w/ balsamic vinaigrette. Next I tried Grilled Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Feta and a White Balsamic Reduction. This was a stretch for me because I've never had Brussels Sprouts before. I have to say, personally, that the addition of the other ingredients didn't make it particularly palatable. I only managed to eat two of the ten sprouts! Luckily, the waiter was able to remove it, even though I was perfectly ok with it remaining on the ticket. I had to add Garlic Parmesan fries mainly to get the taste of Brussels Sprouts out of my mouth and rounded out the dinner with Herb Grilled Lamb Chops! Perfection!

My first experience at Gervais & Vine consisted of many different plates of overpriced, undersized, and mediocre (at best) food that was shared between a group of six friends. We came for \"jazz night\", which was listed at two different times on the menu and website, but that wasn't an issue since there was no jazz anyway. Our waiter told us that sometimes they play jazz over the sound system, but that there hadn't actually been a live jazz band in a long time. When asked how their sangria was (it is watery, flavorless, no fruit), our waiter told us it would \"get us drunk\", and while we were all pretty taken back by this unprofessional remark at the time, in hindsight- I wish it did. Perhaps then we would have been intoxicated enough to not care about the rubbery, insipid cheese plate and cold empanadas. Our group of friends had multiple Living Social deals between us, so we all fought over who could use their's on the check (only 1 per table), because nobody wanted to go back. Unfortunately, I did not win that battle, so a couple of weeks later my girlfriend and I went back to burn the Living Social deal on some wine and dessert because how bad can that be, right? Bad. It can be real bad. After a brief glance at the uninspiring, grossly overpriced wine menu, we decided on ordering a couple of glasses of port to go along with dessert. Being a fan of both the Sandeman Ruby and Sandeman Tawney ports (which they had listed on their menu), I asked our waitress how the Sandeman Reserve compared to the two. Laughing, the waitress told us that she has no idea, because \"usually, people don't ask about the dessert wines so we sort of just pour them whatever\". She said that she wasn't even sure if they actually had those wines in stock. Nevertheless, she went in the back to see if she could find out any more information on it, and came back with a sample for me to try. She said they did not have the Ruby nor the Tawney in stock, and the wine I was about to taste wasn't actually a Sandeman Reserve, it was \"something else that they just say is Sandeman\". After I asked what wine it was then, she went in the back to fetch the bottle, came back with it, placed it down on the table, and said, \"this one.\" For dessert, we ended up ordering the almond joy bread pudding, which was miserable as well.

There was tazicki sauce on it but not a lot so I paid 20 cents for extra and I'm glad I did (I tend to like a lot of it). The roasted potatoes were flavorful but not my favorite since I tend to like them browned more. These were fully cooked and soft but not a hint of browning. The basmati rice was good but bland all by itself. If you got a meal where the meat and veggies were served over it then it'd be great. But as a side not so much.

A neighbor mentioned that it was good and today I was hankering for some Mediterranean, so figured why not and drove there from campus. The lunch time rush was pretty crowded. Not so much that it annoyed you, but there was a good enough wait which is always a nice sign. I had already peeked at the menu online and knew I wanted the dolmades since stuffed grape leaves are one of my favorite foods of all time. Anyway, the ordering process was really quick, ordered the dolmades plate and an unsweet tea. Just a little over $13 bucks, so not super cheap, but not expensive either. I asked if they would be able to see me if I went outside, and the very nice cashier said that they walk all over the place so they'd find me. :) I got my number and went outside.The food came out faster than I had anticipated. I was seated for five minutes before a server came out to give me my food. YAY. I was anticipating my dolmas all day so I saved them for last. The meal comes with a Greek salad, some dressing, their 'taziki' sauce, and a crispy pita wedge. The wedge is crisp, like a cracker, not soft and chewy like I would have preferred but it was still good. The salad was GREAT and the dressing was YUMMY. I really enjoyed that and next time I will get the greek salad and a protein. Then the dolmades. Unfortunately they disappointed me. :'( They weren't tightly wrapped and were awkward to eat as a finger food. The leaves kept unwraveling. I tried a knife and fork and that was worse. Oh well, I went with it. The 'seasoned' rice was yellow (turmeric?) and not very flavorful. The grape leaves didn't taste nice and brine-y like I like. But it was very filling thanks to all that rice. At the end of my meal, I realized that I didn't have a drink. I asked one of the runners and she said that I was supposed to pick it up on the counter, but no problem she would pick it up for me. She was quick on that. I usually get unsweet tea but she gave me a sweet (not her fault - I didn't think to specify) and it wasn't the usual diabetes in a cup that is the norm. Still too sweet for me, but palatable enough on this warm day. While I didn't like the dolmas too much the service was EXCELLENT and the staff and runners were just SO FRIENDLY and all smiles.

I liked the atmosphere, the inside is decorated nicely and there are lots of large windows.I split an appetizer sampler wtih hummus, taziki dip, and dolmades. The hummus was chunky and tasty, seemingly made on-site. The taziki dip (a chunky version of taziki sauce) was great but the pita chips were too thin, cut too large, and over seasoned. I'm not sure why they aren't using flatbread or making the pita thicker, what they are doing just isn't working. If the chips had been better, I'd be much happier. The dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were tasty but difficult to eat. They were too big and kind of soft on the outside, but the inside was seasoned well and tasty.Also got the spanikopita \"roll ups\" - essentially 4 greek empanadas? The chicken was very tasty and juicy and came with a tomato salsa kind of thing on the side that was very good. The side tomato and cucumber salad was tasty and the tomatoes were BRIGHT red, obviously very very fresh and ripe.One annoying thing: the staff behind the counter has to get you a drink.

The major difference is your waiter / waitress no longer brings your bill to you at the end of the meal (but you still get the Andre Mints!), your bill is electronically put on here. The tip is figured automatically (depending on how much you want to tip percentage wise) and you sign electronically (even though I wish there was a stylus available to use). Even though we were not splitting our bill on our recent visit, there's that option (but not 100% sure how it works). Also , you have to use a credit card to pay on the thingy, and if you're paying cash, assuming the wait staff would need to handle your bill.A couple of other features I saw, but didn't use was there was a \"call server\" button - so not sure 100% if that works, as well as an \"order beverage\", button as our waitress took our drink orders (though we were ordering non alcoholic beverages) and if you in fact use this feature, if it's only for \"adult beverages\"."], ["David W.", "Olive Garden is my wife's favorite restaurant and we travel a good bit so we've been to Olive Gardens all over the country.

It was big for two people, and every piece of it was great. The damascus bread is especially good--soft, airy, with a lovely tahini taste.For lunch, we both got kebabs (I got the kufta, my friend got the lamb).

Ordered eggplant parmesean and lamb schwarma at 6:55 pm. Told over the phone it would be a 35-40 minute wait with zero explanations offered for this longer-than-usual wait time Arrived 50 mins after placing my order (just to give them enough time), and believe it or not, our food STILL wasn't ready. But this pales in comparison to what I'd face next...After receiving our food around 8:00 pm, we were told that our eggplant parm (listed online at $7.95) cost FOURTEEN DOLLARS. Expressing our displeasure in the consistency in the online menu versus reality, the owner then told me that my salad, which COMES FREE AT LUNCH TIME, cost me an additional $3.00 on top of my FOURTEEN DOLLAR eggplant parm. Even after discussing with the owner our obvious displeasure in the way things had gone down, we were offered no discount, and simply told \"Sorry\". This is my first Yelp review, and hopefully my last, but it was well worth it to create an account just to tell the world what a mistake it would be to come here. Oh, and top of that, the \"garden\" salad I paid $3.00 extra for came with only 1)apples, 2)lettuce, and 3)ranch dressing, despite being listed on the menu as containing sunflower seeds, cranberries, and green peppers. And the eggplant parmesean that i paid FOURTEEN DOLLARS for was below average, at best, and simply came with a PILE of unwanted, and unmentioned, spaghetti.

I must say I did enjoy their hummus and babaganoush (combo appetizer recommended by the waiter-which by the way is half off all appetizers before 7pm). Both the service and the food was good. It was pretty slow at the restaurant but on a weekday i guess that's expected. For my entree i got the lamb shwarma and it was gooooood. In fact, it was so good i was talking about going there again earlier. What can i say, shwarma warms my heart and my belly.

I had the salad that was cucumber and tomato based and others had the salad that was parsley based. Both were excellent and healthy.Our entrees were unbelievably good--truly, the best part of visiting this restaurant. I had the veggie dish that had lentils, rice and onions. The other dishes were also excellent (although I can't remember the names because I can't find the menu DARN, but they were:) lamb and rice, steak and rice, and chicken and rice. Everything was phenomenal. Huge portions. Vegetarian friendly, everything. The only aspects of this restaurant that bumped it down a star for me were that they were out of Lebanese beer on a Saturday evening, and that our server was just an odd dude. There is no other way to explain the latter, just someone who is awkward and is trying very hard. I felt for him, though.

That said, though, the service at this place was among the worst I've ever experienced. When we were seated, there was only one other group, and it filled up slowly over the almost two hours that we were there. It took forever to get our food. It was almost impossible to get a refill on water --- and when we did, the water tasted the pitcher had iced tea in it and hadn't been washed. Our salad plated sat on the table forever after we finished with them. \u00a0The waiter had zero personality and if anything seemed annoyed that we were there. He was downright crabby about having to split our check, even though he never asked how we were paying at the beginning. The food was good, though, and if the service had been better I would have given this a much, much better rating. The only thing I didn't like was the apple/feta (don't remember the name) salad.

At other times - I want nothing more than to give them 5 stars.The problem here is that they CANNOT seem to get take out food done with any amount of quality. It's the most amazing thing I have ever seen. My girlfriend and I love eating there in person. Food is traditional and made with care. We love ethnic food of all stripes but really enjoy Mediterranean. Add to that, the restaurant is right in the neighborhood. So, if you grab a table and they know you will see the food on your plate - chances are you will love it. If you happen to want to grab some food on the way home. PASS THIS BY. I held off writing this until the 4th time our take out was screwed. 1st was a burnt pizza. 2nd was a screwed up Damascus bread. 3rd was a really messed up salad that remained messed up after opening it to check (after the first two times) and still got it wrong. Fourth was another messed up salad that looked like to may have been dug out of the trash. I was just too tired to remember to look and correct their inevitable mistakes.So, I am conflicted. Amazing experience in-house. \u00a0However, I may never go back, period since they don't give a crap enough to take care of their customers that won't catch their errors in time to do anything about it.

We keep going back hoping it will be quicker because we do enjoy the food. \u00a0Last time we went if was incredibly warm inside, maybe their air conditioner broke, but if was hard to eat the food. \u00a0Overall I do love the place, just might get carryout next time."], ["Tyler L.", "I was really looking forward to eating here. I hadn't had Lebanese/Arab cuisine in a while and really love that type of food. I noticed the good ratings on Yelp and knew it would be great. I must be the exception because my experience was a disappointment and I will not go back on principle. Keep in mind, I love giving good reviews because they are usually shorter. But I have to be honest so people who read this will get a more accurate picture of the experience at Arabesque.I went there with my wife and another married couple that loves Lebanese cuisine. The first thing that went wrong, although small, was that they were out of the only Lebanese beer they carried. It's a Lebanese restaurant, they had Lebanese beer on the menu, but were out of it. This is a very small setback, although a little disappointing. But it turns out, they were out of a lot of beers that were on the menu that they didn't have so they server had to make a hand-written list of available beers, which was appreciated. Second, the server, although very nice, was scatter-brained. She was extremely nice but she kept forgetting things, giving people wrong drinks, leaving lots of plates and empty bottles on the table, and seeming very unsure of what she was doing and saying. She would start to say something, then say \"never mind\". \u00a0But again, she was very polite. My food was pretty good, so there is nothing to complain about there. But my friends ordered a pizza and they put ground beef all over it even though it was only supposed to be on half the pizza. I love ground beef, but evidently one of them hated it and did not want it. The server said it might take a while to make another one since they were busy. What she should have said was that they will make another one immediately since we had already been there a long time before it got busy. The manager did come out and say she would take it off the bill, which was very kind of her. And, she offered each one of us a free drink, which seemed awesome at the time. You're probably wondering why in the world I would only give it two stars at this point. I'll get to that. When the bill came, I was charged full price for an appetizer even though it was supposed to be half price due to happy hour. And the thing that got me was that I was billed for something that I didn't even order. On the menu, they have beef kabobs for $13, and beef tenderloin kabobs for $16. I ordered the beef kabobs for $13 but was billed for the beef tenderloin kebabs. I showed the server the appetizer discrepancy and where I was billed for the wrong item. She admitted that the appetizer should be half off and also admitted that she did bill me for the wrong item. She said she rung it in as the beef tenderloin and that is what I did get, but she remembered that I only said beef kebab, not tenderloin. She came back to the table with the amended check and said the manager was willing to take half off the appetizer but would not change the charge for the beef tenderloin even though we all know I did not order it. Had I known it was the beef tenderloin, I would have said something. I was eating it and it tasted no more tender than a sirloin steak, not a tenderloin. The manager personally came out to us when things went wrong at first, making things right. But when it came to wrongly billing me, she hid in the kitchen and let the server come out and deliver the bad news. I am the most forgiving and understanding restaurant patron, but the manager was basically saying that I was lying. The server even told her just to take it out of her tip, which I told her that I was NOT going to do. This was something I could not deal with, although I actually did and paid the dang bill. The free drinks for the screw ups were a nice gesture, but telling me that the bill would not be corrected to accurately depict what I actually ordered crossed the line. The manager just lost a future customer over $3. She told the server that she had already taken enough off the bill. The service was slow, the server kept forgetting things and seemed frazzled the entire time, and food came out incorrectly. All that would have been fine until the manager insisted I pay for something I did not order. That was an unwise move because I will never go back now. And I'll tell everybody I know never to go there. $3 is almost nothing to me. But not changing the bill to what I actually ordered because I ate it unknowingly wasn't cool. The server messed up, the manager was unwilling to make it right. The pizza my friends ordered was mediocre. My food was pretty dang good, not great though. But the manager insinuating I was a liar by not making the bill right and hiding in the back to let the server tell me.....well, that is pathetic and disrespectful. And that is just bad business."], ["Stephanie S.", "Amazing food, fantastic service. They treat you like family.

I'm thrilled they are within walking distance to my home. :)That being said, do yourself a huge favor and do NOT go here if you are in any sort of hurry or ravenously hungry. Because you will have an angry, long wait. They have a more European approach to service and while that's great when you've got time to relax at one of their outdoor tables, it's not so great when you are hungry and pressed for time. (They do have one server that works very hard and I've seen him scrambling about trying to cover all of his tables while another server lazily half-skips to her smaller number of tables. It's a weird description, but if you've ever spoken with her, you'd understand what I mean.)This place is very vegan friendly as well, which always gets more respect from me. We love to get it for take-out or we'll often bring our dogs and sit on their patio. They are kind enough to provide water (and one time, treats!) for our babies. This location has changed names numerous times but the food is always the same. I'm not entirely sure what's going on, I just hope they stick around!"], ["Kara B.", "My boyfriend and I dropped into Arabesque so that we could switch it up from our typical wing night.

Growing up in a Lebanese family left me with very high standards for this type of cuisine and let me just say that the food here is not the problem.

The birthday girl ended up taking her entree in a to-go box because it was such an ordeal. \u00a0Our appetizers (all dips and spreads) took an hour to make it to our table and \u00a0the Damascus bread we were to eat it with took 15 more minutes. \u00a0That left us all staring at a bunch of food we weren't able to eat. \u00a0Entrees were an hour longer and one of them came out cold.

The atmosphere is warm and cozy. They have middle eastern music playing softly over the intercom which helps set the mood. The wait staff is VERY friendly.

I had a very unusually tasty mint/rose/lime/orange (something else I'm forgetting) lemonade. I had vegetarian meze plate and my favorite part was the falafels they were well seasoned \u00a0and well beyond the typical bland friend chick pea.

Seriously! I don't know where to start with Elie's, you will be so excited after you have a meal there, before you even leave, you will already be planning your second trip, it IS THAAAAT good! First off, SUPER accommodating. Our group was close to 25 and they basically reserved about 70% of their space for us! Not only that, they even split checks! We had two servers regularly checking in on us and keeping up with our fast and crazy pace. Almost everyone in our party ordered an appetizer (some even two!), a drink, an entree, and dessert. Some people were getting multiple drinks. I don't know how they did it, but they didn't miss a beat, it was impressive! The atmosphere is simple and small. The whole place is pretty tiny with not a lot of decor, but after eating their food, you can tell where the real investment in Elie's is. So on to the most important part - the food! Oh my gosh, there are just too few places in Columbia that give you that kick and that feeling of consistent foodgasms, but Elie's will leave you MORE than satisfied but wanting more at the same time, if that's possible. On just my side of the table, amongst 5 very hungry people, we probably sampled close to 40% of the menu in just our first setting. Everything, I mean, EVERYTHING, was insanely delicious! We couldn't stop throwing food in our mouth, like vultures, like crazy people who hadn't eaten in years, we were on a food gorging marathon, it was absolutely ridiculous. I loved all the appetizers I tried, but the spinach and feta pie was a home-run. I ordered the eggplant pita for my entree, and it was soo excellently seasoned and cooked, though at that point, I had inhaled four different appetizers and was completely stuffed, I couldn't control myself and still finished my meal! We were on a roll and went ahead and got all three desserts on the menu and were lucky enough to sample their Lebanese baklava (it IS better than Greek baklava imo!), their strawberry cake (YUM, YUM!), and even their dark chocolate cake (oooh lala!). I wish I had found out the name of the cook, because that man or woman back there, really knew what they were doing, everything was sooo freakin absolutely amazing. I will absolutely without a doubt go back. Oh and people in our group who had never had Lebanese or Middle Eastern food and came out loved everything they ordered as well. The food pleased everyone!"], ["Eva F.", "Excellent food!"], ["M D.", "There needs to be another star added to this. \u00a0This place is Columbia's hidden treasure. \u00a0The food is so fresh and so flavorful! \u00a0Dont even get me started on the deserts... \u00a0They are beyond amazing! \u00a0A fair warning about the coffee though... you wont sleep for a week once you drink it.Service is superb and the quality of the food is the best. \u00a0I have spent 5 times as much on some restaurants in Columbia, but only for a quarter of the amount of satisfaction I get from here."], ["Brandon F.", "Authentic food great lunch prices and portion sizes.

Heads and Tails above the apathetic renderings of Al-amir and the Mediterranean Cafe. I actually like the aforementioned restaurants but Elie's puts them in the shade. I wish the location was more in the mainstream so it would get more recognition. If you like food that is adventurousand not afraid to be bold, give Elie's a chance.

The side of hot sauce was some of the best I've had."], ["Matt H.", "This is one of those places that has potential, but is not living up to it...yet. The food was very nice! I had a mediterranean chicken salad. Everything was crisp, fresh, and tasty. However, there are a number of things that make this place sub par:The servers are nice, sweet, but seem to lack some basic service training, and it showed in a few ways, in addition to coming across insecure. There were also not enough people working here- either that, or the servers are not active enough. The food also took quite a long time to come out considering there were only 3 or so seated tables.The decor is ok, could be more interesting and warm. Architecturally, there is a lot of wasted space (huge walk way between table areas). They could make better use of this in design.On my salad, I asked for no cheese, and an added side of tahini. Most places I go to (and I eat a lot of Mediterranean) do not charge for a small side of tahini. My bill listed 1.50 for it...now, I don't mind a small charge, but this is quite high for a few ounces, especially since I had feta removed from my salad which saved them money.So, overall- the food is worthy...the wait, the service, overall atmosphere, and billing choices, basically everything else is all questionable and sub par. I say this because I like small businesses and I want them to succeed. Make some changes, and you can be a great!"], ["Will C.", "This is where the old Mio's was - they kept the \"nice\" inside and added some generic outdoor tables. It was nice yesterday so we sat outside for lunch.The waitresses are nice, friendly and helpful. We ordered quickly and got our food quickly. I got the Shepard's salad and the vegetable curry. The Shepard's salad is pretty much just cut up cucumber, tomato and onion which is great, but it was poorly if at all seasoned and the puddle at the bottom wasn't oil or vinegar any more than it was juice from the tomatoes. The curry was probably the worst I have ever had out to eat - it consisted of zucchini, squash which were fine in a yellowish, tasteless \"curry\" broth with absolutely no spice other than the pretty dusting of seasoning across that and the rice. It's this exact kind of meal that gives vegetarian meals a bad rep! Also no salt or pepper on the table which could be because we were outside.Anyway, I was left disappointed wishing I had ordered a different dish. The other dish ordered by our table was the eggplant and it looked spectacular while receiving rave reviews. At this point I surmised I was just unlucky with my ordering choice and sitting at a pepperless table. I'm sure the Gyro, eggplant, etc are much better - what was I thinking ordering curry at a Greek-centric Mediterranean place?The bill came and it was reasonable for a lunch for two at close to $18. I had received good enough service and I had a $20 and a $5 dollar bill which means if I left that I'd be giving almost a 40% tip. Now, having worked in the service industry for a longish time, I am often empathetic of service industry workers and would just leave the $25 instead of asking for change and awkwardly taking a couple dollars back.I put $25 in the bill folder and didn't expect it back. Now, knowing people usually don't go leaving 40% tips the waitress brought it back with change in it - a $5 and a $1. THIS IRRITATED ME - I wanted to leave them a really nice tip and I did anyway but in this situation you ALWAYS bring back 6 $1's. Always. I know this is just a small detail, but it's something that really rubbed me the wrong way - it's either completely thoughtless or thoughtful with the wrong intention.So 2 stars while ordering the vegetarian curry which should be wiped off the menu, if not this entire earth. I might update my review if I venture back here to try something else."], ["Rick T.", "As I arrived the staff had just finished setting up for lunch today service. I quickly ordered the lamb curry lunch special at once on the menu instead of beef or chicken and red bean lentil soup instead of salad. It may have been a dollar or two more dollars but I like lamb dishes. The soup had a golden color with small beans shredded up in the bowl with small onions. It was the highlight of the meal, it would be great to try in the middle of winter or on a cold rainy day. Now moving onto the lamb curry, everything was cooked perfect I felt it may have needed something more to make it pop. But anyways I enjoyed the meal and the service. This place is open 7 days a week from 11am to 10 pm except on Sunday's which is 9pm one hour earlier. They are located right beside Wich Wich and right behind the State House. Street Parking is available if you get there early enough before the lunch rush."], ["Suman K.", "Good Food.. every time :)"], ["Milini M.", "Tucked away near the State House, this restaurant is like the cute guy/pretty girl that sneaks up on you. \u00a0You know what I mean -- the person you didn't realize was cute enough to date until they were right in your face? \u00a0That is what Green Olive is like. \u00a0With its simple exterior, the Green Olive is another addition to Columbia's sea of Mediterranean restaurants.
