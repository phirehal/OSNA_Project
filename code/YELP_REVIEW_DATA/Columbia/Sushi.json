{"M Grille": [["Jennifer E.", "I introduced my spitfire mom to my whipsmart new beau at M Grille last night. It was important, ya know? Bottom line? Perfect perfect perfect. My mom got the Jasmine Pear cocktail and I got the Peach Jalape\u00f1o. Delicious! My beau seemed to have no problem finding a suitable bourbon (guess he needed something a bit stronger, ha!).The entrees looked yummy (the Thai curry duck looked particularly tempting), but we opted for variety. VERY easy to do here, as you can order not only a slew of eclectic and tempting appetizers but also toss in a plate of sashimi, a salad, a sushi roll or two, whatever! The sashimi was stellar, mmmmmm, the fried rock shrimp were comfort-food-guilty-pleasure delish, the short ribs were unusually shaped but full of umami goodness, the seaweed salad was totally boiler plate which is, in my opinion, \u00a0how it should be. I'm from Maryland and therefore a VERY hard sell on a crab cake, but this one held its own very well (this never happens!), though I thought the sauce served with it was overpowering and I went without after the first dip. The tempura asparagus was delightfully fresh but rather bland; its sauce was the weakness, too.If you can believe it, we still wanted more food. Jacob, our waiter (have I not mentioned him yet? He was so awesome. It's a rare server who can balance being always available, never in the way, respectful and polite, charming and irreverent, talkative not a blowhard, informative not stuffy or preaching, willing to advise not dictatorial...I think you get the picture), recommended the Aloha Roll based on the flavors my beau was seeking (that's how he \"rolls\", get it? Har dee har), \u00a0and it was exactly perfect. Once we demolished it and Jacob asked how it was (he asked how everything was, and seemed like he really cared!), we were enthusiastic and he then said the Strawberry Honey Roll was another popular fruity roll so we ordered that too. Exquisite. Dessert was a huge slab of White Chocolate Cheesecake, \u00a0some unbelievably smooth sorbet and the best damn coffee I have had in a restaurant since I can remember.I hate to sound like a pretentious hipster jerk (too late, right? Lol), but I have just returned to the Southeast from 12 years in the SF Bay, and I am definitely familiar with Asian Fusion. This place wowed and surprised me. And Jacob is a total gem. My mom and my beau got along famously in this perfect setting. Thanks Jacob, the chefs, and the owner of the M Grille for an enchanting experience. We will be back."], ["Ellen D.", "Cute little place right across from my hotel! Loved the free edamame promo from Yelp!! I had the palmetto roll. Excellent! I also had the Thai Basil with Shrimp. It was good, nothing extraordinary. The martini I had was just okay too.Service was great for the first half of my meal. The server got a large table seated in his section and forgot about me. I was without water for 20 mins. Definitely try the palmetto roll!"], ["Yinka O.", "It's rare that I give a glowy review. Four stars! If you love to try fresh and innovative sushi combinations, come here. Also, the deals are amazing at happy hour, drinks, apps and sushi deals. If I lived here in town id be a regular. Lovely ambiance perfect for an intimate date night or ladies night out. I especially loved the fruit sushi with cream cheese and avocado."], ["Erika K.", "I love the ambience- chic, modern, and sophisticated. \u00a0I like that it's not too loud, so I was able to enjoy conversations with everyone at the table. \u00a0The service was friendly. \u00a0I liked that the menu had a wide variety of options. \u00a0I'm vegan but the rest of my part was not and we were all able to find something to suit our tastes. \u00a0I also liked that there were a variety of cocktails, wines and beers. \u00a0This would be a good venue for a girls night out or a birthday celebration. \u00a0The food is moderately priced, so you can enjoy a full 5 course meal with alcohol and not break the bank. \u00a0Best of all, everything on the menu is fresh and healthy and presented beautifully on the plate."], ["Melissa I.", "Passing through Columbia for business, used my yelp app, typed in Foodie. A few places popped up and M Grill caught my eye due to the great reviews and pics. Had the surf n turf, Red Dragon and spicy Tuna along with side of edamame. Everything was delicious and well presented. Packed with lots of flavor and great technique. Hands down one of my favorite sushi experiences outside of UMI in Atlanta. Loved the openness of the space and the beautiful open kitchen"], ["Robin J.", "Omg the food at this place is great. The service was on point and attentive. The deco was awesome. Nice chill music and comfy seating. I really enjoyed my dinner. Portion size is large for a redo noble price. I had the tofu red curry dish and cashew cheesecake."], ["Lauren O.", "Visited during Restaurant Week b/c of their amazing deal! This was my second visit and I will definitely be back. While a sister restaurant to the Miyo's & MGrille, the menu is quite different. I'd say, a little more up-class and a little healthier than the others.My jumbo shrimp & broccoli entree was wonderful, perfectly cooked & sauced. I was not as impressed with our wonton appetizer (not enough texture for me). And the roll we had was not my favorite (strawberry shrimp) but I'm not a \"sweet\" fan. My husband adored his short ribs w/ saut\u00e9ed spinach, although his mashed potatoes were overly mashed (more like pur\u00e9ed). We with definitely be back, especially for lunch (and that may be a more affordable option for people)."], ["Linda K.", "The salads here are so good. They make their dressings here and it was pretty good. The fresh squeezed juices are good too. They make it in front of you! It's a healthy dining option"], ["B B.", "We are here and loving the grille! Very nice night very nice place for a very nice occasion! !"], ["Brandy B.", "I discovered this new location last night on Yelp - the pics and menu were so enticing that I had to go today!We got there around 11:50am for lunch, parking was super convenient (metered parking in front of the main entrance and free 2-hr parking along Lady St near the other entrance). \u00a0The decor was very modern clean Asian - I loved it. \u00a0I also liked the fact that the cooks prepared the food virtually \"in\" the dining area - behind a half glass partition (I feel it not only allows the customers to see the presentation and preparation of the dishes - it also allows us to see the cleanliness of where our food is coming from).I ordered the M Grille salad to start - it only had a few ingredients, I wanted something light and healthy to start with - I didn't care too much for the yuzu dressing, but the salad was very pretty to look at.For my entree I got the Surf & Turf roll - which is described on the menu as...crab salad tempura inside, pickled beet, soy braised beef on top, eel sauce, microgreens.The tempura was on the outside of the roll, the soy braised beef was basically jerky, I don't know if that was intentional or what (I thought the purpose of braising was to make the meat tender), and there were no microgreens - unfortunately it was not enjoyable at all.We've been to all of her other restaurants and thoroughly enjoy everyyyyything, everytime. (multiple Miyos locations, M Vista, M Fresh). I was hoping to add M Grille to the list, but I guess I'll have to stick with the old reliables."], ["Chris S.", "Was in town for work and found this restaurant came with high reviews. Definitely worth stopping in! The eggplant appetizer and rock shrimp salad were awesome. My server, Taylor, was excellent (great food suggestions, attentive and just a sweetheart in general). \u00a0The other staff were very friendly and professional. Great lunch experience ~ I'll be a repeat customer here for sure."], ["Logan R.", "One of the best dining experiences I've ever had! Food was phenomenal and the server, Jacob, was just as good. If you like sushi and a great dining experience, your a fool to not frequent this place!"], ["Kristina J.", "I had the crab cake for an appetizer and the Asian slaw complimented it so well! \u00a0I kept the waiter (Chandler) busy refilling my sweet tea, it was so good. \u00a0Our waiter was delightful and awesome! \u00a0The fried rice was my ultimate favorite! \u00a0Will be back for sure!"], ["James J.", "Wonderful wonderful wonderful!!!! I began the dining experience with the crab cake appetizer. WOW! That was followed up by my main course which was the Honey Brined Southern Chicken with the curry sauce. I normally despise curry and hummus, for that matter. Not this time though.... Amazing!!!!!!! I couldn't be any happier really."], ["Michael T.", "As dancers on tour, we are always happy to find an unexpected gem. M Grill is one. From the moment our foursome arrived we were treated like royals. The handcrafted cocktails were unique - really enjoyed the Cucumber Basil and Peach Jalepeno and the wine, beer and sake list extensive. Delicious appetizers and salads - crispy pork belly, seaweed salad and M Grill salad were some of our favorites. Sushi rolls, especially the Mango and Spicy Tuna were delicious! The creator of M Grille and the family of M restaurants in the area, Michelle Wang, stopped by our table to intro the specials - she was lovely, incredibly warm and definitely committed to serving healthy delicious food. She succeeds!!! Entrees were fresh and flavorful - the evening's special whitefish, simply grilled with a light garlic soy sauce and asparagus and the flavorful vegetable curry hit the spot! With the restaurant quieting down for the evening, Ms. Wang visited our table again, pulled up a chair to chat about her own dance life in NYC and strong commitment to the dance community here in Columbia, SC and surprised us with an on the house, sweet chocolate bite to end our meal. Can't wait to visit all of her restaurants next time!"], ["Roma A.", "At first glance, I thought this place would be my new favorite spot in town. However, to my dismay, I was wrong. I will commend the hostess when first walking in though. I called a few minutes prior to arriving and she had the table set up for us by the time we got there! But that's where the good review ends.Was not pleased whatsoever. The service was very slow. I understand that dinner rushes can be chaotic, but waiting for some soy sauce for about 10 minutes after I received my food... What's the point? I ordered the m grill sushi roll, and it was extremely bland for my taste. I was not pleased with the taste but the portion size was great. My friends ordered, seaweed salad, a risotto dish, tomato basil soup, and a fried rice dish. The soup was fantastic, I do wish they served some toasted bread with it; maybe they do and we just never got it? I did not like the risotto, but the seaweed salad was nice and refreshing. I didn't try the fried rice so I can't give my opinion on it but my friend seemed to like it. I wouldn't give this place a second chance."], ["Amanda R.", "This is my favorite place for sushi in Columbia! \u00a0I love the modern decor - it is beautiful inside with warm lighting and lots of neutrals. \u00a0I had the rock tempura shrimp, which was a perfect size for sharing. \u00a0The sushi is always fresh and on this visit I had my favorite roll - -the strawberry honey. \u00a0It's the perfect combination of sweet and savory. \u00a0You really can't go wrong with any of the sushi. \u00a0I also love how many healthy options are on the menu. \u00a0I sat in the bar area and service was great, as usual. \u00a0 The owner, Michelle, stopped by the table and was very welcoming and made sure we were enjoying ourselves."], ["Brandon P.", "Michelle and her staff take exceptional care to ensure my meal is perfect - which is why we continue to return 2-3x per week. Keep it up Michelle - we love what you have done in Columbia!"], ["Anthony A.", "Good food. Terrible service. My Food took an hour to come out while my friends came out 30 minutes earlier, they were done by the time I got my food."], ["Eric S.", "Incredibly efficient service during lunch time: our server took good care of us and exceeded expectations. The food was typical generous portion sizes and quality Asian fusion cuisine that the Miyo's chain is known for."], ["Josh H.", "First time eating here. Had read some past reviews about the service being bad, but in my experience the service was fine/good. Absolutely great ribeye. Phenomenal. Tried my friend's duck dish and it was good, but again the ribeye is great."], ["Lindsay K.", "The customer service is the worst in Columbia. I'm not sure if the owner is oblivious or just doesn't care, but waitstaff at M. Grille and M. Vista is abysmal at best. \u00a0Luckily, the food is so poorly prepared that it isn't much of a loss to stop going."], ["Ryan B.", "Went there last night for my birthday...the sushi and service was absolutely awesome !!! cant wait to go back."], ["Hannah M.", "Last minute decision to eat here but man was it good! I've never heard of sushi with fruit in it but it was amazing! Happy hour 4-7! Highly recommend! Also this restaurant is one of 9 different restaurants owned by the same couple! M Vista is right down the road!"], ["Anna S.", "Ambiance is lovely clean crisp contemporary! Sunday brunch menu was amazing. I had the shrimp infused with ham with a side of asian slaw. It was delicious. The staff was attentive and the prices were reasonable and portions were good. I would enjoy coming here again."], ["Hima V.", "Good food. I tried the miso salmon. Nice ambience."], ["Katharine K.", "Yum, yum, yum! The sushi rolls are very creative and tasty, and the cucumber gin cocktail was delicious. Definitely order several rolls for the table to split so you can try all the amazing things they have."], ["Wayne H.", "This place is great for lunch, prompt service and excellent food for the price. It has a great atmosphere but could use another remodeling to close up the ceiling space and other open areas... etc."], ["Jia K.", "This is an Asian American food. If you ever think that this is how Asian food really taste then you are far off. If you are comfortable eating at a Chinese Buffet think of this place as an upgraded version of that and the price that reflects that. Also their desserts are purchased nothings really made in store. The sushi is expensive for what you get and its not fresh. Everything can taste good when fried, coated in soy sauce base, and with cream cheese. If you are from here and haven't tasted a lot of Asian Food in general, you will enjoy the atmosphere and it will be a good place to just try something different...But if you know Asian food. You will not like this place... 3 stars are more for the atmosphere, cleanliness, and customer service... But nothing more than that. GET TakeOUT!"], ["Jason M.", "Excellent sushi, the Palmetto roll is fantastic and one of their top 2 favorites. Highly recommended. Staff was friendly, and the service was fast. Decent selection of wine, but I was a little put off that the wine is served in small water glasses. The Korean BBQ appetizer had good flavor but was too chewy and a bit fatty. It was like chewing bubble gum. I'd definitely go again but would skip the Korean BBQ."], ["Lawry F.", "Great food, nice ambiance, very uneven service. \u00a0But, some of the 5-star reviews read like they are from shills (note the reviewers who've only ever posted once). Because so many other reviews extol the service I'll start there.Everyone from hostess to wait staff was very personable. However, our server was very inexperienced - well below par given the food and prices. Four of us dined and one entree arrived - no joke - 15-20 minutes after the other three. One side never arrived \u00a0but remained on the bill. Don't want to be too picky but she did something I've never seen - took a dirty plate from our table, laid it on top of a plate in front of a diner at another table and them removed the stack from the other guests setting. Some of the screw-ups may have been the kitchen because appetizers arrived at a pace consistent with a tapas restaurant - as prepared. We were never clear if this was intentional or accidental. One other oddity. There are two entry doors to the restaurant. But the hostess is at only one. We waited for five minutes at one before walking to the other to find the hostess. As we waited for our table, we noticed that the hostess seemed to ping-pong between entrances. That said, the food is quite good and the prices are reasonable considering the food. The ambiance is great although not terribly sound deadening, e.g., a raucous crowd of birthday celebrants dominated the place until they left. They do have a semi-private room for larger parties - looks like it can hold 10 or 12. All in all we had a very good meal, at a reasonable price in a very nice setting. The open kitchen design is very nice and fun to watch. Overall our experience was 3-star, but the place is new I could have gone 4, except I spent far too much time wondering wtf the waitress was up to. Once the startup kinks are worked out, could be a five-star experience."], ["Michael S.", "Ate at the bar. Great service and good food but the owners should visit and make repairs to the obvious areas that customers see like the bathrooms and cleanup the area in the back by the sushi bar."], ["Chad H.", "I went in to M Grille for the first time yesterday. \u00a0Wow.All the employees seemed genuinely happy and excited to be there, and for a relatively new establishment they were all extremely knowledgable on everything that the restaurant has to offer.Now lets talk about the drink, THE BEST DRINK I have ever had. \u00a0When you go to eat at M Grille, order the Peach Jalapeno. \u00a0And if you like a spicy drink ask the bartender to ad a little extra kick to yours.The baby back ribs were good, nothing to rave about, but still very, very good.In summary, if you are looking for a great date spot, place to get a casual drink, or amazing dinner venue with a killer atmosphere, look no further than M Grille."], ["Mark H.", "In the interest of full disclosure, I am an avid patron of M Vista and they receive 100% of my sushi patronage. So this is more a review for people who are devoted to their sushi place of choice and reluctant to try something new. \u00a0Michele Wang is one of Columbia's most respected entrepreneurs and this new venture at the foot of the Lady Street Vista deserves serious attention.I had occasion to sample the seared tuna sashimi (the bed of organic field greens it was served with was poetically arranged and rivaled the tuna itself), and their meaty-not-bready crab cakes (and being from Maryland, I am a crab cake snob).The sushi I tried was all new to me: their mango, prosperity, blossom, and crazy crab rolls were all distinctive. The chopped onion on the crazy crab was particularly thrilling. But what was truly life-changing was the \"Salmon Berry\" roll and that may very well make me adjust my hours just to experience this sweet and savory delicacy. If you live in Columbia, you need to get into M Grille to try it and expand your short-list of excellent restaurants. \u00a0If you're visiting Columbia, M Grille will give you a sample of the world-class sushi for which Michele is renowned. I entertain out of town guests from all over and they are amazed that a city the size and location of Columbia can have such amazing sushi. \u00a0Bravissima!"], ["William B.", "I really enjoyed this place for the following reasons: it has a modern atmosphere that is both chic but also feels neighborly, great prices, the menu allows for some creativity (I am not into sweet things but the strawberry sushi rolls are gangbusters!), and I got the pleasure of meeting the owner of the M-Restaurants. She is a wonderful person that at least for me makes supporting her restaurants even more enjoyable."], ["J B.", "My first visit to M Grille left my foodie side throughly satisfied!!! \u00a0Ladies the cocktails are DELISH! \u00a0I tried three different one and they would give LA or Chicago a run for their money ANY day! \u00a0 The meal was incredible and portioned correctly and the best ingredients! \u00a0I can wait to come back to corporate to dine at M Grille again. \u00a0The staff was awesome as well!"], ["A B.", "Excellent first experience. \u00a0Rock shrimp ROCK! \u00a0 Very cool decor. \u00a0Will be back to try more options but sushi was awesome. \u00a0Flounder was delicious. \u00a0Enjoy!"]], "Tsunami Japanese Sushi Bar": [["Todd I.", "Guy waiters suck. But the women work their tail off. Food is awesome. Only complaint is that it takes a long time to get served. We came in on a night that wasn't that busy and it seemed like they are not attentive to their customers at all!! The only reason it gets 4 s from me is that the cooks, chefs, food preps do a great job! The wait staff don't even know their name half the time. It's like an episode of South Park."], ["James S.", "This place is simply mediocre. It acts like it's a whole lot more, but it's not.Service was slow but otherwise adequate. I had the Philly sushi, which was OK. I've had better at buffets and grocery stores. The server didn't offer soy sauce until I asked.The shrimp over fried rice was pretty good. It was unevenly cooked - some of the broccoli and zucchini were cooked until mushy, while some was practically raw. The dish was merely warm. My dining partner had the chicken and pineapple, which was pretty much the same as my entree.We saw a friend who ordered sushi to go using Tsunami's app an hour earlier. She sat with us for a solid half hour but couldn't convince any employees to care that her food still wasn't ready after 90 minutes. Our server and a manager promised to get her food but didn't."], ["William B.", "Really great food, and the service was awesome. \u00a0I liked the presentation, and everything seemed to be really fresh. \u00a0It does take a little while for the food, but the waiter kept us posted on things, and it gave us time to enjoy a couple of beers. \u00a0I'd probably go here a lot more if there were some better parking options. \u00a0It's also a little pricey."], ["Denell J.", "I had the gm and crab roll here. The sushi was amazing, very fresh and tasty. My date had the chicken and shrimp fried rice and it was scrumdillyumptious!! All the staff was pleasant and cheerful.

Great food great service."], ["Taylor S.", "The food here basically tastes like hibachi food, just without the hibachi grill. \u00a0I had the filet and it was very good. \u00a0I would recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for hibachi but don't have the time for it. \u00a0I wouldn't say it tastes as good as food from a hibachi grill, but it's still really good. \u00a0Overall, the service was fast and the staff was friendly, it was a little pricey, but still really good."], ["Rebecca A.", "It's just decent. I don't think I have anything overwhelmingly positive to say about this place. It has really classy decor and is kept chilly during the warmer months. There is always a wait in the evening and they have a happy hour food special where you can get a couple of certain rolls for cheap. The sushi is mediocre and the wasabi is weak. The regular priced rolls were way too expensive. I don't know, this place is kinda like the hot girl who is really shallow. I wasn't particularly impressed. It certainly looks upscale, but the food doesn't reflect that. Parking is a pain, too."], ["Brian S.", "My first impression of Tsunamis was \"meh.\" Firstly it was difficult to find because it sits back in a cut and has no street signage directing the way. I ordered their \"potstickers,\" which turned out to be deep fried wontons and not true pan seared dumplings. Also, I witnessed a waiter sitting on a table while taking an order. Pretty disgusting since someone will be eating in that exact spot shortly thereafter. The service was OK, although I did have to ask for a refill. My plate had a huge wasabi thumb print, but the sushi was good. Tsunamis is only middle-of-the-road in overall ambiance, with a loud, echoey, almost warehouse type feel."], ["Natasha C.", "If you haven't been to Tsunami Japanese Sushi Bar, do yourself a favor and get over right now! I'm a native South Carolinian and I was introduced to this spot in college. I went to college in Orangeburg, South Carolina, but it's only 45 minutes or less from Columbia. So, my friends and I visited the City of Columbia often. This is one of our favorite spots to this day. I'm writing this review because Tsunami is always consistent. I've been a fan since my college days (2003-2006). They still have great food and really good service. The outside appearance has changed slightly, but the food and service are still great. I usually order the My...my..Mai Roll (that's the name). It's one of my favorites. I believe it's very popular. During my last visit, I ordered three rolls because it was \"Happy Hour\" and they offered three rolls for $9.99, which was a steal. Additionally, you can't visit without trying hot sake. Tsunami offers apple, peach and other flavored sake. However, my favorite drink to order is the Pineapple Upside Down Martini...... amazing. Because I was there celebrating my birthday, I got a FREE \u00a0Fried Cheesecake! I enjoyed it and appreciated the generosity on my birthday. I'd like to try the Lava Cake next time. It was recently added to the menu. The only grievance I have about this restaurant is the bathrooms. They were clean, but the stalls didn't lock. Other than that, the parking is good, the service is good and the food is great. They have a bar and televisions, so if you enjoy sports of any kind, it's always playing. This is my go-to celebration spot in Columbia, SC. Forever in my Favs!"], ["Stephen R.", "So far so good, greeted immediately, a/c works great too!

A friend and I went in for a drink and bite to eat.

We asked to start with a salad, which he brought out right away. However we didn't see him for another 15min and that's when the rest of our party started to join us. He got their drinks and then he obviously gave up the table to a coworker because he never came back. We ended up having one extra than the booth could fit so we pulled a table up. The hostess said we couldn't do that because it blocked the servers from running food. There was NO ONE else in the back of the restaurant. It took 45 minutes before we got our 4 orders of sushi. They didn't come with ginger and the server said they don't bring it unless asked. In the mean time our old server showed up again but only to take a picture of us when he thought we weren't looking. He made the mistake of not turning the flash off. When he was confronted he said he was taking a picture of the table he was cleaning. The quickest part of our experience was when we asked for our checks. We didn't get any pins with 4 credit card slips. At our table we had over 30 years of service industry experience.

They have no idea what they are serving. The location is good because it's in central vista. Good location to bar hop, get some desserts and plenty of parking. But the food is horrible, portion sizes are sad, it's over priced, horrible waitstaff, and it's all just marinated in soy no matter what you get. The only nice thing is the location and the decor.

I think it may be because of the fact that who they hire, and who is frequenting this establishment use it as a spring board to get hammered before they even leave the place and while that may seem like a sellable item on the \" Pro's Vs. Cons\" list of places to go for some.. its definitely one that is a NO GO for me as well as my girlfriend, so again I say, stick to wine and beer, or maybe a Seven and Seven, although we were asked if the Seagrams we wanted was Gin.......................... for a Seven and Seven.......................... get the picture?

The remainder of us showed our IDs, as we didn't know we had to have pay stubs (seems silly to be showing that private information anyway?!)- The GM, Jen, came over and immediately started talking down to us and scolding us like small school children (we are all mid 30's and behaving professionally). She sternly told us that we needed pay stubs each, but she gave in after an uncomfortable and EMBARASSING scene infront of my co-workers. - One reason she gave for pay stubs needed was that management \"were on at her about finances\"...

He just abruptly said there weren't any...Anyway, service isn't everything, so we decided to sally onward and try to enjoy the actual meal. We ordered the fried goat cheese appetizer, then one of the hibachi meals for my dining companion and the Oishii sampler for me. I will say our food was decent.

When our waitress came to us with our drinks, we viewed a bottle that had been previously opened from a previous order and she approached us with the bottle and started pouring, saying she would compensate what was taken with a glass per person (being 2) to balance out the loss. When the bottle was finished she presented us with one glass that had been chilled with the wine and an empty glass saying \"you guys can divide\". After waiting for everyone's food to come out sporadically, a missed order and having to remake a dish because it wasn't properly executed, we asked for a manager who kindly and politely helped us out. The remade dish however didn't arrive until 8pm when we had to leave. Apparently timing isn't their finest quality, not to mention the ability to execute happy customers. ... Should I even mention the duration of time it took to close out our party of 8. ... Leaving by a quarter after 9, needless to say it won't be revisited on my behalf, nor the rest of out party.

The vegetable sushi rolls seemed to be made up of mostly lettuce and raw vegetables... And the batter on the tempura shrimp in the spider roll seemed to have the consistency of amateur homemade flour batter..not very inspiring. \u00a0Seems like just another place on Gervais that is more flash and glamour and caters to the trendy college crowd.

What happened to this place? Once a go-to for me but now an oh-no place for me. Ordered the crispy fried shrimp appetizer. The batter was doughy and anything but crispy. On the inside the shrimp seemed over cooked and rubbery. Seems they may be using pre-cooked shrimp for this dish. Ordered the special Chilean Sea Bass special. It took forever to get it and when it arrived it was tough, not flaky and way under cooked. I realize this is a sushi restaurant but when something is supposed to be cooked it should be cooked. Am I right? If this was a one time bad experience I forgive and don't write this review. However on a previous occasion I ordered salmon sushi. It tasted fishy and off. They gladly replaced it with another fish but I can still taste it in my mind and will not order raw fish there again. They claim they receive fresh fish everyday but is it possible they do not run out of all fish everyday? On the positive side the cooked sushi rolls are awesome and generally the other cooked items are good as well. The ambience is a little noisy but a decent place to grab a pre dinner drink however they do run out of certain draft beers more often than I have experience elsewhere.

The bartender informed me it would only take 10 minutes, and unfortunately, for such a simple order, it very disappointing when it arrived 35 minutes later.And this particular night the restaurant was only about 40% full. This night also happened to be Game 7 of the NBA Finals. The establishment has music videos it plays on TV screens around the bar, and instead of allowing everyone in basketball jerseys watching the game the ability to hear the game as well, the restaurant left the teeny-bopper music videos with annoying sound on the entire time.Sadly, my sushi tasted like nothing other than squishy, wet, soggy, rice. I had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I still cannot believe I had crab and smoked salmon in my sushi at all, because I didn't taste any of it.The price you're paying for the sushi at this establishment is for the high fees the interior designer charged the business's owner, but I may consider giving this restaurant another chance, only based on the fact that sushi isn't everyone's forte, and that it may just be this business's weakness.Another menu item caught my eye while I was waiting for my sushi, and that is the Saki Salmon.

Others who ordered different dishes seem to have paid a lot money for little portions. I ordered the Rainbow Roll expecting fresh tasting fish as described by other reviews.

The size of the dishes wouldn't have bothered me if the quality was much better. The drinks and the drink specials, however, aren't bad deals. I was pretty happy to get a Sapporo draft for $3.50. Those who ordered a mojito were happy with their drinks. The apple flavored sake wasn't bad either.I will probably return to try the 50 cent sushi on Thursdays and some Sapporo. It's hard to complain when you're getting a deal in this case. I doubt I'll return any other day after the expirience with the Rainbow Roll.

I can say whole heartedly that this is one of the best I have been to by leaps and bounds. The saddest part to this short review is that its a small place, perhaps too small but we cant all have it the way we want. ok I think that is really the ONLY negative thing about this place I can really think of. The service, Very good to excellent (when not busy)... slower when busy.. to be expected for the size of the place I think because they pack as many people as they can fit into the space available which makes getting around kind of difficult from table to table.. again, the only REAL complaint. The Service of the chefs is all very very good, served with smiles, even if the language barrier is apparent, but the visuals at the bar while they prepare foods are in and of itself a live art gallery and a pleasure to watch while you wait with your Saki or Beer, or Sweet Tea for your morsiles The Sushi and menu... tremendous, very well laid out, with a wide array of choices in proteins, all of which were extremely fresh tasting( some places will serve their fish and you can still taste the frozen ice..) where ever they are getting their product has to be commended as well for packaging, it feels direct from Japan its that fresh tasting. To say a few, they have Conch, Squid, Octopus, Ebi, Abalone, Tuna, Yellowtail, to name a few that I can remember.They do traditional Ramen dishes to Natto with Maguro...Shu Mai.. Quail Egg, Raw and Cooked Sushi, Sashimi etc. too many to list from my memory. Inakaya has my vote and I will be going back again and again..

The firecracker roll just tasted fried and covered in sauce. I couldn't even have more than one piece. I ordered a chicken yakisoba as a backup in case the sushi wasn't good. I'm glad I did.

I should add that we have two favorite waitresses here, an older lady and younger girl who are always there. But if you don't get one of them, you're pretty much screwed. Once loved, but not in a hurry to go back. Sadly, can't really recommend it right now.

Aside from that, everything else I've tried during the last 5 visits have been consistently delicious and worth what I paid. The una ju reminds me of my grandmother's fish, which is a wonderful thing!!!The service, however, may change depending on who's there. I usually get nice waitresses who are very attentive, but there has been a time where I had one who didn't come back and allowed the bus boy and another waitress to finish serving us. I returned a couple of months later to fulfill a sushi craving and was serviced by good waitress as usual.

The boy had a steak, that was prepared on a fajita skillet with herbed butter, potatoes, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, onions and zucchini, and cantaloupe.

We got the firecracker roll and it was good for the price but wasn't anything I'd particularly return for. And the fish tacos this time gets a thumbs downs. It was really bland and I didn't get that zingy taste as I usually do. We ordered a Bloody Mary and I don't know if it was the mix they used or something but we had them take it back.

Background - I have spent significant time in Atlanta and New York, and know a good sushi from a bad one. After waiting 45 minutes after my reservation, my party of 3 was seated. Note that there is really no place to wait here because the restaurant is so tiny, so you kind of just stand around and look at everyone trying to eat their dinner. Sushi was terrible. I literally could not finish my sushi because I was starting to get that gut feeling that I would get sick if I continued to eat this food. Location is great, right across from the Statehouse. Parking is free if you can find a spot in their parking lot with maybe 15 spaces. The experience was rushed and cramped, especially for the price. There is a lot of room for improvement."], ["Stephen R.", "Ok finally ate here, tried a few times but they had standing room only and I do not wait for food.

They were fantastic....not nuclear but filling and the wasabi sauce was perfect. They were covered in a homemade like crust and filled with cheese.Then I made room for scallop tacos. They were fried (crispy on outside juicy inside) and all the ingredients were fresh (guacamole, tomato, lettuce). The beans were plain, and the salsa was meh but it was a filling lunch for sure!The waiter was all over it, refilled my drink, made great recommendations and got me a to go cup for my tea."], ["Arlene D.", "I don't get it and the sushi was horrible. Rice was hard flavors not good. We started with calamari for an appetizer and they were chips. Calamari should not be hard like chips. Rainbow roll, spider roll were dry and unflavorful.

The Fish Takos are the best and the sushi is amazing."], ["Eric H.", "I went into Tako Sushi not realizing that \"Tako\" in context of their title isn't meant to be \"Octopus\" in Japanese (plenty of places do this). Rather, after my experience I'm pretty sure it's a deliberate and confusing play on words where \"Tako\" is literally replacing \"Taco\" with a k. Let me explain. The concept this place has going for itself is Mexican-Japanese fusion. The interior reminds me of a diner (with a sushi bar) in Albuquerque--southwestern art/pottery everywhere. That's totally cool/hipster/modern and I'd be willing to buy in. The problem is the majority of their menu items don't fully commit to any combination of Mexican and Japanese cuisine and the few that do are pretty weak offerings that feel/taste like neither. Smoked salmon quesadilla/southwest tuna tartare... really though? Honestly all of that would have been okay if their distinct menu items (I had a few rolls) were good. Unfortunately, they weren't anything spectacular. Bottom line, if you're looking for nigiri/sashimi/Japanese food in general, this is not the place. Their burgers or their tacos might be alright but I wouldn't have high expectations based on my experience with the sushi. It's beyond me why this place doesn't try and sell itself more as a fusion place because I wouldn't be opposed to having a beer or two with some chips and guac here. Don't get it twisted though, go elsewhere for your sushi fix."], ["Robert V.", "Interesting mix of Far East meets southwest. This was just my first visit, so I can't comment too much on the menu, other than my wife had some delicious carne asada that made me jealous!I had the grilled tuna, which was good, but I didn't like the pairing with beans...odd aftertaste.

I had extra veggies, which were great.The decor and atmosphere were well done, and the hot green tea excellent."], ["Toni S.", "The service was good. The waiter was friendly. The hostess was wearing a really short thin romper and whenever she bent over to do something her butt came out. The food was good but I was just confused. It wasn't even a fusion.

Wouldn't be great for large parties or kids. Its pretty quiet when we came. The waitstaff was friendly. My boyfriend and I both ordered sushi. I can't remember what he ordered but I had this veggie sushi that was defried on the outside. It had carrots and i believe edamame. I can't recall what else was in there but it was so good! I haven't had such a unique sushi in forever! I don't know what it is but the outside of the sushi (the fried part) was such an amazing texture! It was so yummy! We both enjoyed our sushi. We both ordered a meal, he ordered a burger. I can't recall the name. But he said it was alright. While I ordered the stir fry mix. veggies with chicken. It was horrible. The chicken was over cooked and the dish came out to look like a soup. There was nothing \"stir-fried\" about it. The veggies had so much variety and it was minced. I was confused. I didn't ordered a soup.. I ordered just a plain stir-fried chicken and veggies. How do you make a soup out of that? The broth defiantly had soy-sauce in it.. but strangely enough there wasn't any seasoning. It was very bland. The only thing I enjoyed about my dish was the tiny rice they gave me.

We lived in Hawaii for a year (yes, hate me now) and ate poke all over the place. This was as good as any I had there. The beer was good - nice selection and happy hour drafts were less expensive.

It was kind of strange.-I don't quite get the concept. As a lot of the previous reviewers have mentioned, from the name one expects a Mexican-Japanese fusion, but it's not fusion.

The tuna, which I ordered medium rare came out well done and drier than what I have eaten out of a can. To add insult to injury, the dish which was priced at $9.95 came in at $2 more because of some sticker they put on the very bottom of the menu that said tuna was upcharged (no mention by the server). I have never been a fan of the dimly lit restaurant, odd mix of food, lousy preparation and awful floor plan, but this was the final straw.

We arrived at about 7:30 pm and put our names on the list. We were told we'd have to wait an hour. Well, if you've ever been in Columbia this time of year, you know you don't hang out on the sidewalk waiting to get devoured by the mosquitoes, so we headed down the street to Flying Saucer for a drink. We came back forty minutes later, but the hostess shocked us with \"Oh, sorry. I looked for you, but you weren't here. It'll be another 45 minutes because you're back on the bottom of the list.\" We argued with her a bit, but she just kept whining this unacceptable response. The manager was unfortunately no better, unable to explain to us why they couldn't seat us at an open four-top just 10 feet away. It surely wasn't the kind of Southern hospitality my mama taught ME to show to MY guests.So, here's my two cents worth: If a host or hostess wants to overestimate your wait time so they can then become your hero when they call you early, that's a real gamble. Better to give an honest estimate so they don't screw over their clientele like Takosushi did last night. Or maybe at Takosushi, they're just so inept they don't know how to estimate wait times. Either way, it's time for somebody to get a new job.Thankfully, Motor Supply Company was able to take us, and we ended up having a marvelous dinner with great food, top-notch cocktails, and fantastic service.Too bad Takosushi ruined its reputation for me before I ever tasted something out of their kitchen.

There always seem to be a lot of regulars, suggesting that I'm not the only devoted fan.The place is pretty quiet and would be good for a date; the decor is understated. The service is professional, but not intimidating - good for folks who might have a lot of questions about the menu. The sushi seems very high-quality and carefully made - they have both sushi rolls and nigiri sushi. I'm no expert on this, but it seems like they have a mix of rolls that are popular with Americans as well as more traditional items.

For being one of the \"better\" sushi places in Columbia it definitely felt like more people should've been there. Maybe its the location?Don't be fooled by the Japanese sliding door when you first step inside. Moving it aside reveals the low key, unassuming, clearly family owned and operated establishment that hides within.We ordered a few items that I like to think of as standard for any first time sushi experience: miso, seaweed salad, rainbow roll, spicy cruncy tuna, a few pieces of nigiri (mackrel, yellow tail and scallop), and one of the house specials: the Camon roll. We also ordered the cold sake they offered on the menu.I thought the miso was excellent (usually a good sign), and one of the best I've had. Seaweed salad was ok, didn't stand out in anyway. Sushi itself was done right, rice was perfect, and fish was fresh. I particularly enjoyed the scallop nigiri - good flavor and large size. I had hoped for some thin slices of avocado on top of the rainbow roll, but other than this missing ingredient I thought it matched up favorably to other sushi I've eaten. The sake was also excellent.I definitely recommend Camon as a quality sushi restaurant, and would encourage folks to stop in and try it if they are in the mood for something different. All in all I'd give it 3.5 - 4 stars."], ["M D.", "Im not a big fan of Sushi, but my Japanese wife is. \u00a0She heard of this place and wanted to give it a try. \u00a0I have lived in Japan for 5 years and I can honestly say that this is the most authentic japanese resteraunt in Columbia... \u00a0Its a little pricy though, and they have plenty of good dishes for those that prefer cooked food. \u00a0The major beef I have with that place is that the service is glacial!!!"], ["Talib K.", "My rule on \"foreign\" restaurants is that I must see people from that country eating at the establishment for me to faithfully eat there. \u00a0Every time I go to Camon, I see older Japanese people eating, relaxing, and talking to the owner. \u00a0This is the only place I eat sushi in Columbia. \u00a0The food is well prepared by skilled hands \u00a0with purpose and pride. \u00a0Real good Japanese in Columbia starts with Camon."]], "WaSabi Sushi": [["Micah L.", "I love to eat at this place.

I ordered a hot sake (basic house sake) that was $2 for a small vase. \u00a0My wife ordered a chardonnay. \u00a0The waitress brought our drinks and also brought out a free appeitizer of cold edamame. \u00a0I usually like my edamame steamed but it was good. My wife didn't care for it being cold. \u00a0The waitress then brought out two more appetizers that I guess are included with all orders? \u00a0We didn't order them. But she had a small portion of cucumber kimchee and then an egg plant in some type of sweet soy sauce. Both were excellent, \u00a0The cucumber kimchee had a sweet/sour sauce that was really good. \u00a0Had a good tang but just right. \u00a0The eggplant was just as good in the sweet soy sauce dip. \u00a0I'm not an eggplant fan, but loved it.The miso soup was excellent. \u00a0Would order it again. \u00a0She brought out the two rolls ( I think she forgot to put in the asparagus roll, which we probably shouldn't have ordered, but she returned shortly with it) \u00a0My wife said the tempura shrimp roll was a little too spicy for her. \u00a0This is unusual because she does like spice. \u00a0The sauce seemed to be a little different than other Japanese restaurants we've been to - it was a darker red sauce rather than a red/orange. I tried it and liked it. \u00a0My tuna roll was excellent. Had the orange sauce on top along with a little dollop or dash of the red sauce to give it some spice. \u00a0It took a while to get our order (the rolls) but I generally find ordering sushi sometimes takes a while, especially when there's one sushi chef behind the counter and the restaurant was getting filled up. \u00a0My wife doesn't care for unagi (Eel) and a lot of the special rolls had eel on them. \u00a0She said she'd come back but didn't enjoy it as much as Miyos (she loves the MCafe roll and one of the dragon rolls there). \u00a0I would go back. \u00a0The two appetizers were great, I liked everything that they served."], ["William C.", "Went on a slower night.

The quality of the food gave me the feeling that it's made by people who love to cook regularly for their friends and family, and there's just that extra touch of goodness. Between my friend and I, we ordered a misu soup, eggplant salad, avocado roll, and wasabi roll. The kimchee was gratis. For such an array of dishes, our bill was only $20 and change. The portion size was perfect imo, not over the top but not frugal. The quality of the food was very good. The avocado they used was fresh and the teriyaki flavored sauce glazed over the eggplant salad was delicious. Our server was very friendly and really helpful with answering our questions. Last thing I'd like to add is that I am vegetarian (I don't eat seafood or chicken) and I know Japanese food is not always the best place to dine at for my kind of diet. However every now and then I like to get Japanese food because it's light and healthy and I like the diversity in my cuisine.

We spend more at Wasabi than we do at Sumo (one of those neat Japanese hibachi-type steakhouses where they cook directly in front of you), where we order filet mignon & seafood in addition to our sushi, drink much more alcohol, and always have tons of extra food to take home. We just recently moved back to Columbia from Cali and can't believe we are paying far more for sushi here than we did there, where everything is more expensive.

In addition, my boyfriend ordered a specialty roll I don't remember the name of. The first thing I didn't like was that they put a pinch of wasabi in the rice of each piece of all the sushi. If you detest wasabi like me, you should probably ask for no wasabi regardless of what type of sushi you get. The fish also tasted odd. I know I was unfamiliar with 3 of the fish in my dish, but the salmon and tuna (which I eat regularly) tasted bad. The gyoza is very mushy. It was almost like a paste inside rather than a small ball of meat. There was one great thing though. The teriyaki dishes my group mates had were delicious. It reminded me of the meat dishes we make at home- a good thing if you're a fan of Vietnamese food too!All in all, this restaurant gets 3 stars simply because I can't guarantee myself I'll enjoy most of their dishes.

Spoon fulls of roe and other unessentials were 'dumped' on top of the rolls and nearly buried them making an awful presentation. The server must have come straight from a party of his own - definitely had challenges articulating his thoughts and communicating, frequently forgot requests and things we'd ordered.

The reason Sakura isn't the best in this area in my book is because the sashimi has occasionally suffered from the \"frozen\" problem I've encountered at almost every Japanese restaurant in this area (but only at lunch, thankfully) - namely, sometimes the sashimi, when served, is still a tiny bit frozen (which I know is probably a problem that can't be avoided, considering where we are and the difficulty of obtaining fresh fish for sashimi, but still). Sakura also has a lot of different cooked dishes, from various combination platters of chicken or beef teriyaki, tempura, to other dishes, like udon.

The space is large enough and not fancy--which is fine for ramen, while Crane and some trendy ramen joints in America are high-gloss, traditionally ramen is a simple comfort food and shops selling it are low on fanfare. Still, if the restaurant isn't very busy, it feels just every so slightly depressing and forlorn. The space is long, narrow, and a bit dim. The staff are friendly though and the menu, for a ramen house, is appropriate and features all the expected varieties of ramen. The quality however I found lacking in a couple regards. For one, while they also sell shumai and gyoza, I asked if these dumplings are made in-house and the girl at the counter admitted, no, they are purchased frozen and steamed or fried. So, you're getting exactly what you could buy at an Asian grocery yourself from its freezer and take home to cook but at a restaurant. I find that disappointing: food in a restaurant I feel should be made in the restaurant in nearly all cases, and should not be frozen. And frozen shumai tends to be soggy when steamed in my experience, too.Then there is the ramen itself. My shoyu ramen had in general the right taste but the noodles were too thick and the pork was a very meager portion. The onions were too few in number and although the shoyu flavor was there, it seemed meek somehow, though perfectly salty. Again, to be fair, ramen sold at simple shops late in the night in Tokyo on average probably is no better, but having had the fruits of the recent American trend in gourmet ramen, I expect fresh, sharp, and very flavorful ramen, I suppose. Menkoi is probably fine to get a bite to eat after the clubs and they do stay open into the wee hours on weekends, so there is that, but compared to ramen I've had elsewhere it doesn't really stack up."], ["Amanda B.", "Delicious ramen for a great price. Service is quick. The spicy ramen is delicious. The salt rice ball is scrumptious. The restaurant itself could be kept up better but it still has the vibes of a cool hole in the wall.

The pork slices were a little too big and thick to contend with. The noodles were fine. The shu mai were frozen out of a box and then microwaved for a minute in front of my eyes. Microwaved shu mai become gummy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and get cold from the middle to outside quickly. \u00a0The shu mai were $6.75 for 6.

It's in a nice little spot also called The Vista, where other nice restaurants are around. It's a casual sit-in or take-out type place, so you order at the register and then take a seat waiting for your delicious ramen to be brought out to you. And you get a huge bowl for about $7.50!

The seating could be more thoughtfully done but it works for the order at the counter and we'll serve you type of restaurant that it is.The food was just as good as I had in Brooklyn. The broth was more opaque, more nutty and less soy saucy but I think all of those differences are good.

We also split an order of gyoza. The food came out reasonably fast and everything was very tasty. I'll definitely be ordering the gyoza again but I personally preferred the spicy ramen over the cha su men. The cha su men was good but it didn't have nearly as much flavor as the spicy but they keep a shaker of ramen seasoning at the tables (it has pepper, onion, and garlic) that gave my soup the kick I was looking for.

At first glance, I was a touch skeptical about finding even just decent ramen in the south. I dont think alot of people are accustomed to the Nuance of a good Ramen.. there is alot going on in a bowl, from the noodles themselves, to the acoutramount that goes with it. its about layers of flavor underneath a well developed broth. its far from the Bag of Top Ramen at the store. Menkoi does Ramen ... and it does Ramen pretty darn well. the Broth base is good and the noodles are above average for sure. Depending on what you decide to do with your broth, whether is Miso or Tonkotu, Vegatable, or Soy, you are going to get a very good bowl.The down side of Menkoi is generally the seating as it would be nice to have something a bit more comfy like booths.. but its hard to say whether this could be accomplished in a limited space like they have. the Ordering system also seems a bit disjointed as you walk in.. I was confused as to whether I had to order first before I sat down? or whether I should have been seated first. I think since I've been there more than once now, I think I see the system in place.. but for the new customers, they may not be sure whether they have to order first or not.. this is somewhat confusing also based on the layout of the establishment.. space conservation since it is located in between thin and shallow buildings. Seating numbers also seem to top out at like 25-30, not terrible.. but I havent been there and seen a line standing outside yet.. but that would be interesting.wait service is limited since you can help yourself to drink refills.. and since there isnt too much else on the menu besides small appetizers and Ramen.. it just kind of works out for what it is. I definitely recommend Mekoi for Good Ramen.. just go there knowing its not a full service restaurant over say more of a bistro or Ramen Cafe lol, but I dont think you will be that dissapointed."], ["Jennifer B.", "I had the beef curry and my friend had the ramen with the pork and a rice ball.

Considering the veg option was literally the meat soup without the meat - no added vegetables or even tofu - it was /at least/ a rip off. Then, we asked for \"spicy\" and were charged (without notice) an extra dollar each. Again, this is for the same spicy soup served at a lower price and minus the beef. Then we were charged .55 cents each for a cup of water. It's not much, but,again, we weren't told and, come on, spring for the cheap styrofoam cup if you're a restaurant. The food itself was good, flavorful, and spicy. But for a bowl of ramen with a dash of veggies, it's just not that impressive and nothing I couldn't have easily done at home.

Don't be fooled by the various items on the menu however, because at least three of the flavors taste the same- a pork type flavor with a fishy undertone.

Service is efficient and friendly, though seating can be a bit difficult, as they have only a few tables, and a bar against the wall.

Just like the reviews said the servings worse huge we all could actually eaten from 1 large bowl the servant for however we order to spicy ramen split it with the girls and were full not too stuffed that felt really good. Overall this was a fantastic find can't wait to locate a noodle house in Atlanta.Try this place if you like ramen noodles or soup of any kind opt for that matter.

I was excited to see that Columbia's Asian food market has gotten better. There is even a Boba place here now as well. So, I decided to stop by today after hearing good things.The decor is nice, a bit minimalistic. I got he spicy ramen & inari. The broth is crazy delicious. Not really spicy to me, but I tend to like really really spicy food. The noodles were the perfect size, texture, & chewiness. The pieces of pork are flavorful and tender. I really really enjoyed it, and they give you such a large portion that \u00a0you can eat off it twice which is great being that it only cost $7.50This was my 1st time trying inari. It had a good flavor, but I am not a huge fan of a lot of tofu. I like it, just not too much of it. So, while it was tasty I did not love it just because amy not that big on tofu.This restaurant was a very good addition to Columbia.

It's enough for two meals and all for around $8.I would add that I could have gone up to 5 stars if the place was more aesthetically pleasing. The least they could do is organize and straighten up the place a bit."], ["Angela M.", "The sushi is just about as fresh as you can get in this god-forsaken fried food city, and the $5 daily deals are unbeatable.

It was a risk, \u00a0but I'm pleasantly surprised the tuna was still tasty & fresh. Hibachi was just ok, veggies were nicely cooked (not overdone, soggy, & swimming in sauce, as is the custom around these parts). Go for the rice, instead of noodles.

With Sushi & Hibatchi To Go, they have an amazing Buy 1, Get 1 deal for $6.95 on sushi rolls, which means that I can treat myself to sushi more frequently than I usually would. The $6.95 deal is for the more standard, California roll, crunchy roll, spicy tuna roll, etc. without all of the bells and whistles but definitely gives me the sushi fix I want when I'm craving it! The prices are great and the sushi is good. I wouldn't say it is the most amazing sushi but for the price and serving size, it hits the spot. I enjoy the crunchy roll the most! I have also had the spicy tuna and yellowtail rolls but the crunchy roll is by far my favorite. I also enjoy their shrimp tempura and gyoza as appetizers. Don't let the outside appearance scare you away, it's just a great hole-in-the wall spot.

I hate to write such a bad review because the girl at the front (her name was Summer) was so sweet and fun to talk to...I was really excited to eat their sushi. It looked so good in the togo container, with fresh fish and big pieces. I got home and set up shop (soy sauce, chopsticks, and TV). The first roll (Salmon Lovers) was good...until I found a bone!!! I thought, eh, well at least I know it's real salmon. Haha. Then I got mad when 3/8 pieces had bones. Moving onto the rainbow roll (CA roll topped with fresh fish). Weeellllll....the \"cucumber\" in the CA roll was zucchini!!! I tasted this awkward flavor with a weird crunch and examined further. Whoever does their shopping or delivery orders bought zucchini instead of cucumber. Big mistake and made my sushi experience beyond forgivable at this point. If you do decide to go here, DO NOT order sushi. Their egg rolls were good, so I would stick to anything cooked at this place...If you go here.Sad day."], ["W T.", "I'd been passing this place for weeks without trying it out but decided (based on the sign outside advertising their BOGO sushi rolls deal) that today was the day. I decided to get a spicy tuna roll and a crunchy shrimp roll, because I figured they'd be safe first-try options for this place. \u00a0The spicy tuna left a lot to be desired. The fish didn't seem fresh and mostly ended up just being really mushy bites. The crunchy shrimp, however, was fabulous. Excellent flavor and consistency, and even though I ended up not finishing the boring spicy tuna, I'd come back to get double the amount of crunchy shrimp for the same price ($6.95, if I remember correctly). The place is worth checking out."], ["Kate P.", "1 star service, 4 star food, but it really doesn't matter that the food is delicious and cheap when they consistently forget to give you everything you ordered.

Anything less would be just a shame. Servings are gigantic + delicious,which is a dangerous combination. In fact, you might want to fast for a couple of days prior. And wear pants with an elastic waistband. All lunch/dinner hibachi entrees come with your standard rice, vegetables, miso soup, and salad. And sherbet! - such a nice touch. My favorite entrees are the filet mignon and scallops. I've tried just about everything over the years though, and I've never met a meal at Yamato that I didn't like.Always ask for extra ginger and shrimp sauce, and don't forget to ask for some to-go sauce containers to include in your to-go box. (You will need a to-go box, and if not, I'd like to meet you and shake your hand.)Sunday afternoons are very busy, so expect a wait. Dinner on weekdays seems to be your best bet. Prices vary from ~$15-24. Chefs are hilarious and I often hear new jokes when I go - a feat in itself since I've been hundreds of times.Come on in and give Yamato the chance to become your family tradition. My personal tip? Grab a handful of those delicious breath mints on your way out."], ["Jared B.", "My wife and I go to Yamatoes about once every two weeks.

The 2 hostesses we had last night (09/21/2015) were probably 16-17 years old and spent most of their time literally running and playfully screaming at each other. It was extremely unprofessional and I get they were young but it's the owner and managers job to groom these new people in the work field. After we were seated we could hear them laughing and screaming at each other and the younger male bus boys the whole hour we were there. When we left the two teenagers were gossiping and didn't mind telling us to have a good night or thank us for coming. The waiters are always usually rude, take forever to take your order and bring back orders. The cooks usually have to ask if our order has been taken, apologize, and have to go get the waiters.

NoT noodles, And at the end of the meal they brought out ice cream. Don't know if it was JUST b/c or if they do that for everyone. We did notice he was kinda sloppy, a lot of rice and things were thrown about the place. The prices weren't too bad, I saw alot of \"special\" signs and \"early bird\" specials.

When I was younger my best friend and I used to frequent pretty regularly for sushi, but never really stayed for the show. I did notice, however, that they have a culturally diverse staff. I think that this is actually an interesting addition because in my prior experience majority of the staff of any hibachi restaurant is typically not Japanese, but normally Central American, South American, or Pacific Islander. I don't think that ethnicity should dictate anything in an atmosphere for eating and it's highly racist to suggest such. Regardless, my fiance and I were seated and promptly brought our drinks, the chef came out within 15 minutes of being seated and began to prepare our fare. I always stick with steak and chicken, and my fiance got shrimp and scallops. One thing that I will say is I was ALWAYS a fan of Miyabi's (the restaurant all other reviewers are posting about which is a few doors down) UNTIL that evening. I ordered my steak medium well as usual, but what I must note is the chef used a limited or miniscule amount of oil while preparing the steak. I was a little bit curious about this, but when I tasted it I was blown away by the flavor. Furthermore, the scallops he prepared for my fiance were impeccable. I usually don't order seafood in the midlands simply because I rarely receive well prepared seafood here, but this scallop was perfectly caramelized on the outside and tender in the middle.Aside from the entree preparation the show was also fantastic. Ironically, as I revert back to the ethnicity of the staff our chef was caucasian. While I agree that the atmosphere in miyabis may be miles apart. I respect Yamato's because of their obvious equal opportunity practices, and their lack of over oiling their food. Usually, my stomach is upset or I'm overfull after leaving a hibachi restaurant but the food didn't sit too heavy - primarily because of our chef's insight and lack of a need to use too much oil like I've experienced at Miyabi's. All in all 5 stars, and keep up the fantastic work. Also, the sushi was fantastic as always and I highly recommend the Almond Sake as well."], ["Karen S.", "I am surprised this is located where this is since there is a similar restaurant just a few doors down from here.The concept is unique - they cook your main dish right in front of you. \u00a0Their table seats ten. \u00a0For those planning to visit with a large party, due to the nature of the meal, they will not seat you until your whole party has arrived. (On a side note - say if there is a few of you - like anywhere between 2-5 people - they will seat you at a \"table\" with another party to get as close to 10 people that they can get at a table.) \u00a0One member of our party was running extremely late last night and we went to sit down without him, and he had yet to arrive before they started cooking dinner, and if he had not shown up when they started cooking the main dish, he would have not been able to order.The rice that comes with the meal is fried - not sure if they do have steamed rice - you might have to ask the waitress when she is taking orders that you want steamed rice. \u00a0Prices are a little on the high end - since the soup, salad, and sorbet were small portions (as well as the meat). \u00a0It seemed like we did get lots of rice!Our cook did try to be entertaining as he could be while cooking, but have to admit - most of the cooks are not Japanese."], ["John F.", "We were seated and promptly left to wait without being acknowledged again for 15 minutes before we decided to walk out.

Where else can you get two specialty sushi rolls for less than $20?! And they were great! Fresh and well-prepared.The service itself left something to be desired. Our sushi rolls sat prepared and sitting for quite some time before the waitress got around to bringing them to our table; the other half of our table opted for Hibachi (without the fanfare of watching it prepared) and that took nearly an hour to get to us as well.

They have a pretty good selection of specialty hand rolls. If you're not feeling sushi or hibachi, they also offer a variety of noodle dishes which are also wonderful!

They're very good about working around any allergy or vegetarian requests, so don't hesitate to ask!I always order the teriyaki chicken dish, which is always delicious. You are first served with a cinder block sized serving of fried rice (don't forget to ask for a to go box) and they are quite liberal with the white sauce.

It was strong...So strong in fact that I could only have one. When we were seated, no one spoke. The waitress was spread really thin and was rushed. We weren't there more than an hour or so in total. The cook that we had was an asshole. He made a few smart remarks that upset a few of the men at the table and even gave a few customers the evil eye. He claimed that he did not like them. Strange! When the cook was making our food, he was about to put tomatoes on the grill with everyone else's food. I have a tomato allergy and have never seen tomatoes at a Japanese restaurant. He ultimately had to make the tomatoes on the grill behind us. I thanked the customers that ordered it and apologized tremendously for their inconvenience. They seemed like nice people but the experience just wasn't what I'm use to at a Japanese hibachi restaurant.

So here's what I liked: \u00a0The decor is very nice and I have to say it looks like an authentic Japanese restaurant with a lot of bamboo touches and nice dim lighting that translates to warm and inviting. \u00a0Service was really good too, from the guys at the sushi bar to our server and her trainee, everyone was very friendly. \u00a0The food was good and quantity was generous. \u00a0I had their tempura combo which for $12 came with a choice of tempura, a choice of sushi, white rice or fried rice, and a choice of soup or salad. \u00a0Since I'm vegetarian they accommodated subbing the crab for cream cheese in my california roll and it turned out to be just fine. \u00a0What could use a little improvement: \u00a0The dessert was good but not great. \u00a0Fortunately the price was only $5 so it was not bad, but quality was just mediocre. \u00a0Miyabi is a great city spot that offers great atmosphere and good food. \u00a0I am looking forward to going back!"], ["Loretta G.", "I went and sat on the sushi side since I was by myself... The staff was very kind but service was slow. When I got my hibachi it was REALLY salty. I ended up only eating half of it. The price was much too high for the quality of the food....

Normally the girlfriend and I head straight for the sushi bar and order two rolls each, an appetizer and saki and the final bill normally hovers around $40. The Miyabi chowder soup is less than $6 and loaded with seafood and fresh vegetables. Their fried rice is delicious. Experiment with their extensive sushi and maki roll menu.

They give you enough food for two meals, though it's a bit over priced in my opinion. \u00a0The shrimp and steak were really good, but the chicken was stringy and over cooked. The rice was good and the sauces were tasty. It's a fun atmosphere for the most part, but I could do without all the sexual innuendo that my table's chef kept throwing out along with the food. He used a squirt bottle to squirt oil on the grill while making an orgasm face and then looked at the ladies at the table and went ''Ooops, sorry ladies\". \u00a0 There were several other not so subtle references to going at it all night with a wink and a smile. \u00a0It was pretty inappropriate considering we had teens in our group and it distracted from the meal."], ["Tony Y.", "Very good food!

This was typical for our family of five (5). \u00a0We gave the waiter the credit card to pay and received a receipt with 18% gratuity added into it! Now I'm used to paying gratuity without the mandate but normally if we are required to pay the mandated gratuity it's for parties of 6 or more , it's printed on the menu, and on your receipt BEFORE you pay. So of course we were a bit annoyed that it was added in after the fact and without a warning. Before signing the receipt we asked what was going on and the server stated the Manager said he could charge gratuity for parties of five. That would have been nice to know when we received the receipt. We called the manager over and he admitted to this and to the fact that this 18% gratuity rule is not printed anywhere in the store or menu. We asked for a refund of the gratuity and of course left less than the $23 gratuity (they added it after taxes). I may not have argued the issue if the server was like the one we previously had at Harbison, but he did not give us $23 worth of service. \u00a0I had a much better experience at the Harbison location. \u00a0Everyone should beware of this trickery (18% gratuity on parties of five) that's not even posted in menu or store. Avoid this store, and if you don't mind the additional time/distance drive to Harbison, try that location instead.Another note, on a previous occasion instead of the rice which comes with a dinner meal I ordered, I requested salad (nothing spectacular, just that green stuff) and I was told the store used to much produce and would not substitute salad (lettuce) for rice but would give me extra green beans. I didn't know lettuce cost more than green beans but ok. IJS - Be wary to eat at this Miyo's location."], ["Ellisa V.", "Food was very good, but service was a little spotty. Sushi and Pad Thai were both excellent, probably our favorite from any of the Asian inspired places around town. We saw a handful of dishes we'd like to try if/when we come back again.

If you could, try not to go there on Friday or Saturday nights. We went there last night and it was very noisy. It also took them some time to serve dinner....We had mojitos, ma-po tofu (which is no longer on the menu, just ask for it), and sweet and sour pork last night. Miyo's does special entree very well- a little bit more authentic than other chinese food around. The sweet and sour pork isn't worth the price. The Miyo's VIP card got us free california roll -- wouldn't recommend it unless it's free. Their special rolls and sushi are usually good though. Mojitos, delicious - wouldn't complain much about it other than they ran out of proper glasses. Nice decor and attentive service - besides the noise, it was a pleasant dinner."], ["Tom K.", "Great priced New Asian.

Was here on business and desperately wanted a good sushi roll and boy did I find it. Ganbei is located in a shopping center area and features a robust menu from hibachi to sushi to salads. When you walk in you are welcomed by a modern and upscale motif consisting of ambient lighting and dark woods/marbles. We happened to be here on a Wednesday night which featured an amazing happy hour deal on sushi, sashimi and tempura priced between $1 - $3 each. I had checked in, so I was able to use my free coupon for some pot stickers (Thanks Yelp!) before diving into ordering my sushi. The pot stickers were brought out pretty quickly. They were hot, crunchy and served with a tangy dipping sauce that worked well. As for the sushi, they have a plethora of options to choose from...I mean, at least 2.5 full pages of rolls! I ended up getting a usual for me, a spicy tuna roll and went with their house roll, the Ganbei Roll for my specialty roll. Simply put, this was easily one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. Yeah, ever. I was just as surprised when I ate it as you are reading this right now. Overall, Ganbei was an awesome find in an assuming area of South Carolina.

They were fried and crispy but still light.The sushi menu is pretty extensive and looked very flavorful so it was difficult to settle on two rolls. Black Pearl and Eel Delight were excellent choices for me on this night.

And each time, we checked in on Yelp and got a free order of Potstickers, which clearly is an easy way to bribe us into coming here again and again. But truthfully, we really enjoy Ganbei. We have sampled a wide variety of the menu, and it all has both satiated us and enticed us for more. The bar has a good Happy Hour, and management has enough specials and \"half price\" events to keep Ganbei on our weekly rotation. The restaurant has a fun atmosphere for a couple on a date or a small group of friends. (I would say leave the kids at home for this venue and enjoy Ganbei on date night.) Come here for sushi, come here for the wide variety of other well known Asian dishes, or just come here to say, \"Hi\" to the Paul, the general manager.

It's quality sashimi grade tuna with avocado, cilantro, and some sort of soy ponzo sauce. It's served over crispy wonton chips. Typing it out makes me want to go back for more. The pork potstickers were crispy and delicious. We also had the baked mussels which had crabmeat and fishroe baked into a spicy mayo. It was killer too!For my entree I had eclipse roll which was \u00a0tempura shrimp, avocado, cucumber (DELISH!) and the monster which is essentially the same ingredients reimagined. Hey, I like what I like. A friend of mine had the singapore rice noodle dish with a substitution of tofu (I \u00a0would have done the same) that had a spicy curry sauce.

The spicy mayo is not spicy; you can really taste the mayo. I order extra sriracha on the side but can't quite get the perfect mixture of the 2. Makes me miss home along those same lines, the spicy tuna is not spicy at all. These were my 2 favorite sushi items to order but I do not like them here and therefore don't order them anymore. The service is touch and go. The first time we went we waited 10 minutes at the (not full) bar to get one drink. The bartender was disinterested and didn't even make eye contact with us. On our third visit we watched two couples sit down after us and receive their sushi orders FIFTEEN minutes before we did. Hard do believe since you're sitting directly in front of the sushi chefs.Somewhere I read this is a \"hibachi\" restaurant.

It was loaded with steak, pork and chicken. The steak was so tender it could melt in your mouth. I had some of the best miso soup and seaweed salad, ever.

There were quite a few things crossed out on the sushi menu and they apparently no longer have a sushi lunch special. The low point was when I was told they were out of miso soup and then served lukewarm tea. The spicy tuna roll was ok and while I appreciate the ingenuity of using red chili flakes instead of spicy mayo, it totally overpowered the fish.

It's close to my office so it will probably continue to get my business from time to time but there are definitely better options in Columbia."], ["Simon T.", "I'm disappointed:exceptionally priceylukewarm tempura."], ["Amy K.", "My husband and I love this little hidden gem. \u00a0Love the shrimp hibachi and their hibachi rice is great, \u00a0they use a delicious aromatic sticky rice. \u00a0Love the spicy tuna roll, \u00a0best in Columbia...not pureed and he uses a crushed pepper rather than a spicy mayo. \u00a0 There is never a wait to get a seat. \u00a0 Service is generally good, \u00a0but if it's a little more crowded, or may take a little longer to get your food, \u00a0but still nothing to complain about."], ["Suzannah M.", "Love this place, never have to wait & food is amazing. The sushi is exceptional & hibachi delicious & sauces are exceptional. I love this little gem & am kicking myself for never trying it before!"], ["Jaymie M.", "Upon entering, the decor is pretty unimpressive and the space seems cluttered. But I don't mind that if there's good quality food to be had. So I took a seat and ordered a diet pepsi, because I'm addicted to fizzy things, that's why.At any rate, I noticed only two other tables with diners at them while I was there at 6:30pm, on a Friday night. As it turns out, there's a reason for that. Looking over the menu, I noticed that prices seemed high, especially considering the location.I shrugged and ordered a tempura appetizer. To be completely fair, the tempura is pretty good. It was the usual assortment, minus onions, but with a slice of acorn squash, which I wasn't expecting, but loved.Next up was the rainbow roll, which, to me, is one of the benchmarks of any sushi joint. When it came out I eyed it a little suspiciously. The fish was sliced thinly and even had skin left on a couple pieces of the roll, a sign of very poor fileting skills. I tried a piece and was not thrilled, the fish wasn't fresh and for my money I really could have just picked up something at Harris Teeter. After choking down a few more pieces, I gave up and decided to just read my book and call it a day. The waitress asked if everything was ok. \u00a0I informed her of the problem and that the fish still had skin on it. She tried to tell me that 'everyone' does their own version of a rainbow roll. I replied that I know what's on the roll, the problem is the poor quality of the contents. She told me I could like them on facebook for a 10% discount, but there wasn't much she could do, otherwise. I rolled my eyes and just asked for the check.Maybe I'll go back for hibachi sometime, but I really have my doubts considering their prices. Disappointed in what I had hoped would become a regular restaurant for me here in Columbia. My hunt for decent sushi in the area continues...."], ["James N.", "Fujiyarrhea. There's a reason we called it that. The hibachi was expensive but tasted very good, however, it tore up my friends and my stomach every time we ate it. The last straw was a whole night in the bathroom. I can't be sure it was food poisoning, but I never took another chance. Two stars because it tasted good but not really worth the suffering."], ["Ebee J.", "Sushi is rancid. I'm not some huge germaphobe whatsoever, but sketchily prepared raw fish is not something I'm gonna get from just anywhere. My friend ordered some and from one look of it I knew it was going to make her sick. It was very rice heavy as well. My hibachi was sub par, could have gotten ten times better hibachi from sato, just a few miles away. The location is ghetto and the decor is awful. Do not recommend at all. If you want to support local business and get fantastic sushi, head to inakaya. It's a bit far away, but hands down the best sushi I have ever had. If you want to support local and get hibachi, head to satos. Absolutely delicious and for a better price. Over all, fujiya is disgusting."], ["Meredith B.", "Delicious gyoza! Wait staff are friendly and attentive."], ["Matt O.", "This place is good. \u00a0Not exceptional and not poor, service is good and food is good. \u00a0All around, it's a good spot. \u00a0I've certainly hand much better and I've had worse. \u00a0If you want good hibachi at a good price this is the place."], ["Heather S.", "In town for a campus tour and my daughter wants to go to USC now just to be able to eat sushi at Fujiya. It was freshly made at the bar and was worth the wait. Open Sundays, but no alcohol so too bad for Dad who wanted to try the Japanese beer. We will definitely be back the next time we're in town! :-)"], ["S W.", "Good hibachi-style Japanese with a sushi chef (not on Sunday, when he's at church). Shrimp, steak, chicken or various combo platters for $10-$12. The portions are good and there is always a bonus shrimp or two thrown in - nice! Comes with miso soup and small salad. It's our neighborhood local Japanese place, and fills that niche very very well.Not sure why the two other 5-star posts got filtered...Yelp?"], ["Kelly K.", "Great lunch spot near Fort Jackson! The service is always friendly and fast. The food is always tasty and the portion sizes are great for lunch prices. The \"lunch box\" is great. Getting hungry just writing about it!"], ["Gwonk B.", "It's standard hibachi fare cooked by a non-Japanese chef and you'll pay $12 for it. You can get better food at Egg Roll Chen. The wait staff sometimes has problems with large orders. This place isn't spectacular, but it's adequate. I never tried the sushi, but it's appropriately expensive like you'd expect. It's not a bad place; there's just not the value for the cost. \u00a0You can get this same kind of experience anywhere else in Columbia."], ["Rebelyelp R.", "Went with a big group. \u00a0Restaurant was empty. Service was good, but food was mediocre. \u00a0Had chicken hibachi dinner. \u00a0Way to much teriyaki on the chicken. \u00a0Rice was not flavored/cooked very well."], ["H T.", "My favorite Japanese restaurant in Columbia. Delicious and at the average price point for hibachi and sushi. I've had both and they are both tasty. Would absolutely recommend to others."]], "Sushi Yoshi": [["Rachel O.", "Can I eat here everyday? By the time I was leaving I had already planned what I was going to get the next time. I tried to talk my friend into going the next night to no avail but I'm totally hitting it up on the 3rd before/after/during A Starry Night in Five Points partay.Anyway, Sushi Yoshi is super cute and cozy. My friend and I were seated in the front by the door. Christmas music was playing and I felt like I was in a scene from Love Actually. (When is Colin Firth going to come busting down a door to tell me he loves me anyway?) We were promptly waited on. I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and a Crunchy Roll. My friend ordered a Japanese Pickled Roll (it's called something... I forget what) and something else that I 100% can't remember now. We got our drinks and they never ran dry. Refills were always at the ready. Our food arrived and it was beautiful. Visually, I didn't want to mess it up, but I was also super hungry so on we go. The shrimp tempura roll was super delicious. The tempura was still warm and the rice to filling/non-rice stuff ratio was near perfection on all the rolls. The crunchy roll was... wait for it... crunchy! And also super tasty but the flavors were not that pronounced. I don't think they should have been... it's just maybe not a super flavorful roll. I'm not sure though since it was my first time trying one. I also tried my friend's pickled roll and I'm totally getting one of those next time I go. The pickling gave it a nice little kick! Noms all around peeps! Don't delay! Stop by today. If Colin shows up tell him to wait. I'll be back soon."], ["Mark C.", "Had to come here twice to make sure they get a fair review. \u00a0All I can say is WOW! \u00a0Excellent sushi, fair portions but best of all was the fried rice. \u00a0It was as good as it gets for a sushi place.I WILL be back."], ["Megan B.", "Not the best sushi I've ever had, but the place was really cute and the people are very nice."], ["Regular C.", "I ate at Sushi Yoshi at least one time before my recent bad experience. I remembered the main woman that worked there as a very vibrant and nice person, while the male sushi chef working in the back was passive-aggressive and emotionally removed. With the exception of the mediocre food they offered (Inakaya is better for real Japanese food), I decided to give them another chance when I was hungry, during the Columbia flood last week (October-4-9, 2015).I went to the restaurant and ordered my food at the bar with the chef. When he asked me if I wanted to drink anything, I said water and asked about their water bottles. In a very rude way with an angry expression, he told me their water was four dollars. I decided that four was too much for water, in my opinion, so I told him I would like to order my food without a drink. Rolling his eyes and wearing a look of annoyance on his face, he walked to the kitchen.After deciding that I didn't need this treatment when I was nice to the chef and his establishment, I snuck out as soon as he went to the kitchen. Later, I found out through other people that the price of the water was not only ridiculous, but illegal. With the state of emergency last week due to the flood, many restaurants made their water half-off or entirely free, and this restaurant was price-gouging. I reported them to the S.C. attorney general. I refuse to ever eat at this restaurant again, and it's pretty bad that my second time there was worst than the first. I do not recommend this restaurant, and I hope that they have reasonable prices in the future, especially during states of emergency. I also hope they treat all their costumers with respect in the future, not just yuppies and people spending big money on drinks. Thank you."], ["Leslie H.", "I went to Sushi Yoshi for lunch a few weeks ago and was very pleased. Its a quaint little place with just the environment I enjoy. They do more than sushi but it doesn't have that hibachi-place-that-also-has-sushi feel. The tea was hot (and not from a tea bag) and the miso soup was yummy. Had the chef make me a spicy tuna and \"whatever is good today\" roll. Both were fresh, quick and delicious!"], ["Roxanna M.", "Recently transplanted to S.C. we have been in search of a sushi restaurant. We would have settled for decent, however, instead what we found is Sushi Nirvana! Sushi Yoshi is glorious! Everything we have tried is delicious, fresh, and well just amazing!

My suggestion to anyone who loves sushi is go here, go here now!!"], ["Paul L.", "Outstanding sushi restaurant. \u00a0The gentleman who prepares it does a superb job. \u00a0It is like a work of art. \u00a0I travel to Columbia a couple times per year, and this restaurant is always on the \"must visit\" list. \u00a0Very friendly, prompt service. \u00a0If you love sushi, look no further!"], ["Elisabet A.", "Great service!!! Food came out fast. Amazing food! Had four different rolls, hibachi and yakisoba. Super friendly staff and very nice atmosphere. Two thumbs up!!!"], ["Jia K.", "Horrible place for sushi! It was so hot inside I was wondering how they could possibly keep the fish fresh! The space for the location deserves a better place. They need to shape up. I cringe every time I walk by the place. I really don't have much to say to this place. \u00a0The food price is reasonable for a reason and feel bad for his wife who is the waitress she is so skinny seems like she never eats. It's dark and dingy. If you want asian get TAKEOUT! it's cheaper and you can eat it in the comforts of your living room in an air conditioned place!!!"], ["ChristiAnn B.", "Super fresh sushi! Came here on a Thursday night. We asked the waitress what fish was the freshest. She pointed out 4-5 fish that had just arrived that day. So of course we order it. We ordered about 18 pieces of sashimi (has no rice) and one super spicy roll. I didn't like the roll and wished I would have ordered more of that really fresh sashimi. \u00a0Service was really good. Nice for a casual dinner."], ["Rick T.", "One of my favorite sushi restaurant in Columbia, the staff are really friendly and don't mind toasting a warm glass of sake with you when your celebrating birthdays or something special, oh and the sushi is GREAT!"], ["Mel S.", "I started visiting this place since 2007 and it remains my favorite sushi place for my trips to Columbia. It's quaint, cozy and the hostess is an absolute doll! The food is always great and reasonably priced. We will definitely be back!"], ["Spence R.", "This place has an excellent bento box lunch special. Cozy atmosphere. Good saki. Reasonable prices."], ["Jon G.", "I came in with a large group, and we ordered a ton of food and sake. I liked the fact that they had a pretty decent selection, so there really was something for everyone. Then why only two stars?-Most of the sushi had mayonnaise or avocado in them (common in the US, but still gross and not very authentic)-Service was not very prompt. We stood in the door for a while, then sat ourselves, having to push tables and chairs together because no one had approached us to seat us.-Most of us got sick the next day because the fish was not very fresh. I recall my sashimi wasnt cold, but was room temperature, and the fish in the rolls was room temp and not very flavorful as well.I was super disappointed that Sushi Yoshi had such short comings because I feel like with the kind of selection and prices they could be a good spot. But quality control and service needs to go up, and since most sushi rolls come with mayo or avocado, I would really suggest varying up the ingredients a bit because a lot of people dont like those things. Just my opinion anyways."], ["Mike H.", "This place gets 4 stars on atmosphere alone. You want to feel like you're in Japan while actually being in the US? This place is legitimately the real-deal. Having been to 'Nihon' (Japan), I can say that I've never found a \"Japanese\" restaurant that made me think I was actually there, until now.And the best part about it, the food tastes amazing! As a topper, the dishes offered come at decent price.But, best of luck finding a parking spot in five-points."], ["Phillip S.", "Atmosphere in this place is rad, sushi is fine I like his spicy tuna roll add crunch or any of his wraps or anything he might give u as a special.. no one makes it better on the spot!"], ["Kim Z.", "Overall, kind of a disappointment, even though we gave it 3-4 chances. Because it was close by in Five Points, we came back hoping it would get better.The cooking is really inconsistent here. Also, EVERYTHING is really sweet. The tempura is sweet, the rice is sweet, the meat is cooked in sweet sauce. It's a little gross after a while! I also got fried rice there one night that was so greasy that it was inedible. Gross."], ["Paul B.", "Nice little sushi restaurant!This is a cozy little sushi place in five points. The price is right and the sushi \u00a0is very nice! Nothing else too remarkable about the place. The skinny little hostess waitress was very nice and very helpful- she told what was fresh and good, and she recommended a good sake for us.I would defiantly try this place again- nice location in five points, not too expensive- we ordered 4 different rolls, a nice scallop appetizer, and a bottle of sake for about 50 buckeroos- Not too bad!"], ["Zacc Z.", "I am impressed.As an avid traveler, I have visited more than my share of sushi restaurants. The perfect pricing allows you to not break your budget, and be able to return in the near future.During my last visit, I ordered 3 sushi rolls of 6 pieces each, for a total of 18 total pieces (Yes, I was hungry). Each order was priced at ~$6. I enjoyed this meal with a sweetened iced tea. My total including taxes was $21.26.I have only one problem with this location, and that is its business hours. My experience with Sushi restaurants has always been that they are lunch & dinner businesses. Sushi Yoshi is a dinner only location.Their hours are:Mon-Thurs from 5pm to 10pmFri & Sat \u00a0 \u00a0 from 5pm to 11pmClosed SundaysIf their business hours allowed for lunch, I would definitely make the commute mid-day for some sushi.

I've gotten to know Han and Mia, the owners, and they welcome me every time and make me feel right at home. I feel very comfortable there and know I'm going to get high-quality and fresh food. I had never had sashimi or sushi until this place so it definitely set a high standard for me on how it should be prepared and taste. I love this place, especially when I get to sit up at the bar and watch Han prepare the sushi and other various items for other people. It is pricey, but if it weren't then that would probably mean there is something wrong with it. There should never be cheap sushi or sashimi."], ["Ashley M.", "I love this place. We go all the time. The lady that owns it is very nice (albeit a little difficult to understand sometimes). It's small, only a few tables. The food is delish! The five points roll is one of my all time favorites. Her miso is spot on. It's going to be a little $$, but it's good. Never had a bad meal there."], ["Alice L.", "I love sushi and I used to come to sushi yoshi very often. But this business has gone downhill. Freshness is key in any restaurant business, especially when you are serving raw fish. Sushi Yoshi used to have one of the best sushi in town. But based on my last couple of visits, the quality of freshness has declined rapidly. It was quite disappointing. Its location is awesome though. Being at the center of 5 Points, I hope that their business would turn around."]]}
