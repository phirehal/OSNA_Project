My family and I have come here multiple times over the years and it has slowly declined in quality. The good used to be incredible, and it was one of my favorites. The service has always been great, and have never had a complaint, but the food has left much to be desired. We ordered shrimp fried rice, and the shrimp were incredibly small and looked like the frozen kind you buy from Walmart. Their coconut soup had a strange after taste, and a funny fishy smell as well. The food was very sodium heavy, and I felt almost ill afterwards. I'm disappointed in the quality of the food this time and will probably not return in the future. It makes me sad that such an incredible restaurant that I reccomended for years has gone down hill. I'm not sure if they've gone under new management recently, or have a new cook.

I frequently order the Tom Yum Goon (spicy shrimp soup). It is very simple, but hits the spot. The warm broth is \u00a0flavored and spicy--complimented with tail on firm shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onions. My other go to dish is the Pad Kraprow (basil \u00a0with peppers and onions) I usually have it with fried tofu and add broccoli. The flavor profile isn't very complicated, but it's a great lunch portion for the price.

Ok, we pretty much know what we like, but it still took about 25 minutes for her to take our order. Beers arrived with warm mugs!! We were very reluctant to order the whole meal at once and made it VERY clear that we did NOT WANT appetizers and main dishes brought at the same time. Well guess what Chuck, everything came together about 45 minutes later. Sorry, but I had to raise my voice. Her answer \"you said you wanted it all together\" .... NOT!!! When she brought the main dishes back, they had completely dried under the heat lamps. What a huge disappointment, not only to new guests, but especially to patrons who have frequented your restaurant for 3 years (ever since we moved to Aiken) and have bragged about it to many , many people. By 8:30 the waitress said she was starting to clean up now, because she wanted to get home.

They did bring me more peanut sauce when I asked, but it was the consistency of a thin soup. It also did not have a strong flavor or the spice it used to have, possibly because it was so watered down. There was always something special about the fried rice here.

The place inside is definitely small and fills up fast so that is something you will want to take into consideration when visiting i.e. day of the week and time of day. We got there a little past 7pm on a Friday and there was one table.. and it stayed that way until 10pm. So, the best option to ensure some decent seats would be to get there between 5 and 7.. probably after Thursday til the weekend... We started with appetizers and like many reviews, we tried the Calamari and the Angel Wings... While the Calamari was larger and tasted pretty fresh, the batter was somewhat bland and a bit too greasy, but not something that I wouldn't try again if the place was a bit slower. The Angel Wings (6 per order), well they were downright awesome, similar to a Rangoon, but altered with the type of cheeses inside, definitely Rich, but if sharing, with 2 or more people, totally worth a try. The main course choices were the Drunken Noodles and the Pad Thai(beef) ... I feel as though Pad Thai , albeit street style food, represents an important cultural link to know how well a Thai joint is linked with flavors and spices, so I tend to order this every time I try a new place, to see how they treat their version. I was not overly disappointed at all, the noodles were good, the spices and flavors were all well balanced, the beef was good although slightly bland, when mixed as an all in one bite with the other ingredients, it was tasty... I felt like they could have added just a touch more veggies, but I would get this again... The Drunken Noodles were also very well done, with solid flavor profiles, spice levels were on point ( low to med ) doneness and chew of the noodle itself, with only a similar comment about the amount of veggies which could have been a touch more, but totally worth getting again.The price points on this meal were definitely in the bargain range.. both of us with Saki and wine, appetizers, Food, Tip came to a few bucks shy of under 50bucks and we went home with leftovers, so to me this is what makes this place a definite return stop in the future. I cant say this place is the BEST in Columbia, as I haven't tried all of the other places yet, and there are \"a lot\"... and my 4 is based on a few things... 1. it was my first time there, so I don't know about consistency just yet and that is important when giving 5 ratings , at least to me... 2. there were on this visit, some very minor things with the calamari being just a bit greasy; which could have been attributed to the level of business at the time.The Service was good even when busy, but do not expect rocket fast service, go there with the aim of having some time between orders, so don't be in a rush if you go at the times I quoted in this review. all in all, great place!.. look forward to a second trip to see if the 5 comes out in an update!"], ["Mary S.", "First time eating Thai. Had the sweet and sour beef and it was very good, loved the pineapple chunks."], ["Dawn W.", "Lovvvved! We pulled up and debated about how good it could really be based of how it looked from the lot.

Chicken a tad better. \u00a0I asked for level 3 spice because I'm from Seattle where Thai is spicy!

The space and number of tables is highly limited and they won't let you sit at the bar because it \"blocks the take-out service.\" I waited 15 minutes before I decided to find a staff member to ask if I could be seated.

On our most recent visit, my husband got the panang curry w/ chicken and I got the drunken noodles w/ veggies only. We also split the spring roll appetizer. He was in love with his curry, so much so that before I could even eat 1/4 of mine, his was completely gone. Somehow I managed to save 1/2 of mine to take home, but it wasn't easy. Both dishes had great flavor, with mine having small hints of anise and perfectly cooked vegetables - crisp but cooked just right, no hint of sogginess. The spring rolls were very simple but did not disappoint. (Tip: This is the place to order an appetizer b/c the wait for food is longer than you'd typically expect. So worth it though!)During our meal, we looked at each other and said, \"Why do we even go to Basil when Mai Thai is so much better?\" This last experience has caused me to revamp my Basil review. Somehow Mai Thai is just so much fresher, more flavorful and they aren't trying to rush you out the door, meaning you can enjoy your meal or date night with your significant other. :)The icing on the cake was when I forgot my take-out container on the table. We were driving out of the parking lot when I realized what I'd done and ordered my husband, \"Go back!\" He turned the car around and we spotted the waitress running across the parking lot, taking my container to various parked cars looking for us. How sweet!"], ["Pamela L.", "The food is great... However the service leaves much to be desired. Waited 30 mins before someone even came to get our drink order, at the end of the night we had been sitting there for 2 hours before we got our food.

Unfortunately that was not the case during our visit."], ["Liz D.", "Mai Thai is wonderful! Looks like a closed store front in an ugly little strip mall. Once you open the door, it's beautiful!The service can be a little slow sometimes, but it's always nice. The food is fantastic! My favorite things on the menu are the curries (particularly the Panang curry) and the Drunken Noodles, but I've had so many things and they've all been fantastic.Went yesterday for lunch, and the place was packed. Still, we got a table for 2 in under 10 minutes. Lunch specials are really decently priced (we got food for 2 with Thai teas and an extra drink for under $25), so this is a good way to enjoy them inexpensively. Everything was fantastic!"], ["Jennifer N.", "My absolute favorite Thai restaurant of all time! I've been to Thai restaurants in Greenville, Atlanta, Spartanburg, etc. Nothing compares to Mai Thai. I highly recommend their signature pad Thai or pad see ew! My boyfriend loves their duck curry. The quality and taste is consistent. Don't let the sketchy area fool you, Mai Thai is the best around. You can't get better Thai food anywhere else. Love, love, love!!!!!"], ["Carolyn G.", "You must ignore the exterior of this restaurant to get to the treasure inside. Looks like an X rated dive from the outside, but inside it is a nice, small sit down restaurant. The service was fine, but it did seem to take a while for the food to arrive. We ordered the spring rolls to start. My entree, the drunken noodles was awesome with just the right amount of spice. I ordered them with the steamed tofu. The dish was loaded with vegetables and good enough to order again. My daughter ordered the chicken pad Thai which was good, but next time she will try another dish.

Don't let the scary run down strip mall setting fool you. When you walk through the doors its super cute and run by the sweetest little Thai ladies.

How could I even think of sharing such a box of delicately fried deliciousness with anyone??). \u00a0If you're not in the mood to splurge, just get the Mai Thai roll - it's amazing. \u00a0My go-to dish was panang curry. \u00a0The green curry is similar and also delicious, but a good bit spicier - *almost* too spicy for me, and I have an above average tolerance. \u00a0To top it off, I would sometimes order the cheesecake tempura. \u00a0You would love it, unless you hate things that taste good. \u00a0Once I ate the whole damn piece sitting in my car right there in the sketchy parking lot, and I didn't care who saw.Oh, and the prices are pretty cheap, too - I'd usually get all of that for about $30 - so go ahead and indulge."], ["Qi G.", "Worst dining experience ever.

The interior is well-decorated and intimate, but it can get pretty noisy on busy nights.You should definitely plan ahead if you want to take a date here, though, because there is frequently a wait to get a table, and the food preparation takes a while (which is, as others have said, a testament to the freshness).

One piece of advice, though, if you like your Thai food decently spicy then you should ask for a spiciness of five on their scale of five! The entrees of the other people at my table were also very nice. (Granted, we had to wait for a little while longer before the entrees came out.)

I used to love to frequent Thai Lotus when they were around but their prices were a bit high for basically the same amount and quality as Thailand. I have explored the menu and had a number of items but I always go back to my tried and true. The mussaman curry with tofu is delightfully sweet and I add a touch of chili paste to balance it out. The tofu is a little crispy and the potatoes cooked perfectly al dente to me, I don't like soggy potatoes in my curry.The \"noodle soup\" if I am correctly recalling it's name, comes with your choce of beef, chicken, seafood or tofu. The broth is on point and comes with noodles, onion and cilantro, it cures what ails ya. Portion size is huge, I always have a ton left over.

First of all, the fried samplers were too fried and burnt that you couldn't even taste the calamari inside and the spring rolls, and fried gyoza didn't seem that authentic to me. I don't recommend that you order any samplers because to be honest it wasn't worth $9 to me. The yellow curry was very spicy and I believe all of their curries are spicy. What disappointed me was that the curry was more of like a soup consistency rather than a traditional Thai curry. I tried the carrots and potatoes in my curry which was not fully cooked and literally could hear the potatoes and carrots go \"crunch crunch\" in my mouth. I really enjoyed the flavor of the curry so that was the only thing that kept me eating. I've been craving thai food but very sad to say my cravings were not satisfied.

Then, after our food was done, she handed us the bill which we paid by our credit card(s). we did not include any tip as the food was spicy contradictory to what we had ordered and also the price was higher than normal lunch hours. She said its dinner-time rates that were applied.Today, when we went there for lunch, she arrongantly said \"We serve here only for tips. The other day you two guys did not tip.\" She also commented about our country-of-origin and said that you people always do this kind of stuff.Before today, I was eating there regularly and tipping her even for to-go orders!

But, in not judging a book by its cover, once you enter in, has a pleasantly warm interior, with a decent amount of natural light set against hardwood flooring. \u00a0The menu is helpful (great for Thai first-timers who have no idea what they're looking at, awesome for Thai experts looking to expand their taste horizons), and whimsical (wine menu posts descriptions in haiku, and food is decoded with a spice meter that helps you rationalize your selection).How it continued - my brother and I shared everything, family style:Appetizer - Calamari - lightly battered, impeccably tender, with a sauce providing a faint kick of spice and the light tang of sweetness... like a stiff jab to get your senses flowing in anticipation of the...Main Courses - Three Flavor Duck - listed as a regular menu item, this was intensely flavorful, juicy, with the right amount of heft.... just like a right cross combination, dizzying us just in time for the...Bison Sausage Noodle - sold as one of the specials of the day, featuring tender bison on a bed of mixed vegetables and flavorful gravy, this was the knockout punch we were waiting for...How it ended - by way of 3-round knockout, we declared Baan Sawan the heavyweight Thai champion (at least of the Southeast, and possibly of the U.S., besting even Las Vegas' Lotus of Siam)!"], ["Anita F.", "If you are looking for imaginative flavor (and aren't afraid of some heat); a rather cool, fun atmosphere for adults (wouldn't consider taking a few kids - Mom won't appreciate the atmosphere and food); Great \"date night\" kinda place; with great desserts and an exquisite unusual beer & wine selection - this is it! A perfect place to sit back, take your time, experiment and spend a fun evening. Alex makes the food sing (w/ interesting presentation) and Sammy knows how to be refined yet not stuffy (great at suggesting the newest and most unusual from the bar).If you really aren't into trying new flavors, don't want to dress up a bit, looking for a quick bite with the kids, don't get into unusual wine &/or beer (either don't drink or are a Bud Light kinda person) - you may be somewhat disappointed ...Just sayin' ... ;-)"], ["Trey G.", "A friend of mine suggested we try Baan Sawan for dinner last night. \u00a0I had never seen it (though, I spend little time on Devine Street, so I've missed much) but found it and was even happier to find they have their own parking! \u00a0 My friend had already arrived and had a table. \u00a0The place is small, but well appointed. It was somewhat distracting to see an office door in the wall of the bar area. \u00a0From my seat, you could see it constantly open and close. \u00a0A bit distracting. \u00a0A curtain or something else that made less noise and draws less attention would be a far better thing. The wine/beer menu surprised me - it wasn't, say, Barley's or Liberty Tap Room in scope of size - but what they did offer was excellent and very reasonably priced. \u00a0I started with the spring roll with meat and my friend started with the veggie spring roll. Both tasted excellent and had clear, clean flavors. The sauce that was on the plate, however, needs work. It really did not compliment or enhance the flavor of the rolls and occasionally became a bit too bitter on the tongue. \u00a0The beer helped. \u00a0Staying away from the sauce - the roll was excellent.She had shrimp pad thai and and I had three flavored duck. A noteDuring the ordering process the spice scale was explained. \u00a01-3 are your typical mild/medium/hot - 4 and 5 are significantly hotter - and Holly (our excellent waitperson) said the chef doesn't eat above a four. \u00a0 \u00a0Thinking that was serious business on the spice end, I opted for a 3 with a side of spice. \u00a0 Caveat: I'm one of *those* people who loves Phaal and all things spicy. \u00a0The 3 wasn't even warm. \u00a0The extra spice didn't help (think garlic/chili paste with something else in there - about a \"medium\" salsa heat). \u00a0If you know you can handle heat and you like heat - I'd start with 4. \u00a0Holly did warn us that the food would lose quality after 4. \u00a0I disagree. For some people, yes, that is true. The palate gets lost with all the heat and you can't taste anything. \u00a0For some of us others, though, the heat opens up everything and flavor profiles are enhanced. \u00a0 The duck, though mild, was incredibly good. \u00a0The flavors were clean, bright, and paired well with the duck. \u00a0 The shrimp pad thai looked incredible. In some places you get three or four shrimp and a ton of veggies. \u00a0In this case there were plenty of shrimp and I am told it was some of the best pad thai my friend has ever had. We opted to split the fried bananas for dessert. \u00a0My friend and I agreed it was a bit too much dough and not enough banana, but not bad. \u00a0 On the whole, Baan Sawan is a rare jewel in Columbia - \u00a0and I look forward to returning there."], ["Tanya M.", "Really small, but really good.

Along with the combo steak and shrimp hibachi combo meal that came with rice, saut\u00e9ed cabbage which is the best cabbage I've ever experienced. The shrimp were jumbo big shrimps. The steak was nicely marinated. The Alligator roll had a wonderful flavor beginning to end. Our waiter made sure our drinks were always filled and the atmosphere you just wanted to meditate and take a nap there because it had such a relaxing zen-like atmosphere. The icing on the cake was my visit to the ladies room where I discovered a nice updated music soundtrack as I danced over to the sink to find scope mouthwash, dixie cups and gourmet flossing sticks.

It was in some sort of barely-there broth without even a hint if spice. Upside was that, unlike other places, it was not dripping in oil. It seemed like many people ordered egg roll and wing type dishes, so maybe their bland lunch reflects consumer preference?

I got a soup that had a decent broth, but the chicken was rubbery and tasteless, and the soup was full of woody leaves and lemon grass stems (a few are normal and good, but it has hard to take a spoonful without ending with something inedible in my mouth). \u00a0*To top it off, the table cloth was damp and my arm started burning after I rested it on the table.

I tried this place since the hotels off the highway are in a sea of garbage fast-food and chain restaurants. I'm a tenured Thai food eater, and I appreciate a range of quality. Two major flubs. I ordered green curry \"as mild as humanly possible.\" I also ordered Tom Ka Gai and Thai iced tea. The Thai iced tea was smallish and the sweet overwhelmed the smoky flavor of the tea. it's always sweet, but usually the tea balances it out. Not so with this one. The waitress delivered the green curry first (no soup?) with enough rice to feed a Thai family for a month and a smallish portion of green curry (with chicken). The first bite was a shock. It burned my face off. It was also full of bamboo shoots which I'm not terribly fond of and the only other discernible vegetable was green and red peppers. Disappointing. The chicken tasted like cardboard. Why\" I dunno. Maybe it was frozen or cheap or who knows. The hotness was disappointing. I told the waitress that I ordered this mild and she just smiled wryly and subtly communicated with a look, \"I'm not taking it back and you're going to pay for it.\" She said, \"I know,\" and walked away smiling with Southern Girl fake charm. Well... OK then. I ate it and suffered the consequences... I sweat profusely even thinking about hot spicy food. I really do like the flavor of it, but my body hates it. I could only stomach half of the dish when another waitress appeared with some water. I told her that if the soup wasn't ready, I don't want it anymore. She smiled wryly again and said, \"They made it.\" Again, no explanation or apology. She took another 5 minutes bringing it to me. Whatever. It was unremarkable with flabby limp lifeless ingredients. The chicken tasted like cardboard, the mushrooms looked beat up and the kaffir lime leaf seemed to have been frozen or something. Anyway. I paid the $30 for my dinner and won't be back. I might have given the food another chance with different choices, but I really didn't like how they didn't care that I wasn't satisfied or that they ignored my request for mild spice and didn't care about that."], ["Scott W.", "Walked in, nobody was there...

It's funny, cause the waiter dropped one of them on the floor and apologized and came out with a new set. Great service!The main event was the combination seafood pad thai. Great serving which included fried talapia, mussels, shrimp and squid. Ordered mine not too spicy and it was outstanding! Couldn't even finish it and decided to take the rest home. Prices were ok, $4.95 for the Satay Chicken, $5.95 for the rolls and $8.95 for the Pad Thai. Add in the Sweet Ice Tea and it cost a bit over $20. However, they do honor a 10% military discount so don't forget to ask if you work/live in Shaw AFB. They also do take out and give you a take out menu before you leave.

My medium spice Pad Thai had no heat to it at all.The Pad Thai was still tasty and my husband's Red Curry Chicken was tasty. He thought that for the price, they could have put more chicken in the dish."], ["Karen S.", "I so really want to like this place, but might have had too high of expectations. A group of us was in the area and came here sort of at the last minute. Have to admit we got seated pretty quickly for not having a reservation and 10 people were in our group (but then again it was a Thursday night). The place looked nice (since it's sort of on the new side) and has ample seating.Really what went downhill was the only Thai Dish I've had and like is Chicken Pad Thai. So went to order and apparently the dish is Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. Since everything is cooked to order, they were able to make the dish without the shrimp. Food did come out quickly after we ordered, but portions seemed smaller than I was anticipating (given price and what I've had at other places."], ["Michael M.", "On a recent trip to visit a friend in our old neighborhood in the Rosewood/Devine St. Area of Columbia we had the wonderful pleasure of dining at \"Basil\". The restaurant is a lovely and lively place with excellent service and the best Thai food I have ever come across. This area needed some better choices in the dining realm \u00a0and now it has this jewel in its crown. Bravo and bon appetite. It will be a regular on my list of must dos in Columbia."], ["Rick T.", "Wonderful Thai lunch at Basil today I tell ya ! Seated quickly and then the crispy wings with dipping sauce came out in a flash. But the real reason why my lunch was so great was the red beef curry with bamboo shoots and rice, spot on. I sampled other dishes and they were delicious too. Can't wait to try more dishes next month."], ["T E.", "Second time having dinner at Basil and they didn't disappoint. Both times the service and food were great. I've had appetizers stuffed shrimp, fried wontons which are so different than any other Thai restaurant, and several cocktails and entrees. I have not been disappointed and will continue to dine."], ["Brandy B.", "My first visit was shortly after they opened. \u00a0I loved the decor, music and ambiance of the place.I ordered the Crispy Red Curry Duck and I wasn't impressed... I've eaten duck many times and love it (I've always had it baked or rotisserie style), so when I read the menu description (deep fried to perfection and spicy), I just knew I'd enjoy it... unfortunately that wasn't the case, the skin was wobbly and fatty (yes, I know duck is fatty, but I wasn't expecting the squishy texture when it's described as \"crispy\").I'd never had red curry before either and haven't had it since. \u00a0The presentation of the dish was beautiful, the taste just wasn't to my liking.My friend ordered the Beef Pad See Eu, I tasted a bite (and wished I'd ordered that instead).I went again a few weeks later and met a friend at the bar, we just had drinks and were able to chat with one of the owners for a bit (he made drink suggestions and chatted about favorite hangouts in Charlotte), very friendly! \u00a0The drinks were good.My boyfriend and I went again on a whim, we were in the area and it was a little after 9:30... Basil was open until 11pm.We sat outside, the temperature was perfect.We ordered the fried wontons (so freakin yummy) as our starter.We split the Beef Pad See Eu (playing it safe), and Basil Chicken... I loved the Pad See-Eu, perfect blend of sweet and salty, the beef was tender and paired well with the noodles, broccoli and egg. \u00a0My boyfriend loved the Basil Chicken, it too was very tender.For dessert we got the fried bananas and the strawberry shortcake cheesecake (which is also sold next door at Whole Foods - lol).Both were delicious!!!! Since I've stopped eating meat, I've been back and ordered a shrimp dish (can't remember the name) and tofu pad see-eu, which is no where near as good as the beef! :(Service has always been great... we'll be back!"], ["Pam J.", "We just had an incredible experience here! \u00a0Food was amazing, as was service! Our server, Arnim was so personable & his suggestions were outstanding! \u00a0The manager, Sue, made us feel so special! \u00a0Highly recommend & we will be back! This will be listed among our favorites!"], ["Chad A.", "While there food here is good, I can't justify the price for it. I feel that I am paying for a high rent and interior designer. The service was the most on point part of the meal, VERY attentive.For this place to be a bit more successful, just come down on prices a bit, and see why the Greek place across the parking lot stays busy. I know apples to oranges, but my point is still valid."], ["Jessica D.", "I went to dinner here last night with my mom.Atmosphere- it's more upscale than most Thai restaurants. It reminds me of some of the Thai restaurants I've visited in DC or Atlanta. It's sleek and modern, and my only complaint is that the tables are kind of close together. I could easily overhear what the table behind us was talking about throughout the meal.Service- Our server was aloof. She dropped the food off and then didn't come back. Fortunately, another server refilled our drinks and took our dishes away to pack up the leftovers. Price- For two entrees it was close to $40.Food- I ordered the green curry with chicken. It was really good with delightful chunks of eggplant mixed in and the seasoning was great with just enough heat that didn't overpower the flavors of the curry. My mom ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish and really enjoyed it as well.Cleanliness- I don't usually include this in reviews, but this place was extremely clean. I ran to the bathrooms and was impressed that it was spotless and everything (even the garbage can) is hands-free. \u00a0Extra star just for the above-average cleanliness."], ["Emily E.", "Why is this place SO expensive?! \u00a0Their food is good but there are many other Thai places in columbia with food that's just as good but at lower prices. \u00a0The larb was good but I found the duck dish to be overly sweet. \u00a0Masaman curry was delicious."], ["Kim L.", "A little pricey but it is really good food. The service and atmosphere were excellent. I went with a big group so we tried several appetizers. Chicken satay was a 5 star, eggrolls get 5, and the soup gets a 3, but everyone else loved the soup so it is probably just me. I loved my pad see eu dinner. I highly recommend it."], ["Brand\u00ed M.", "Fantastic dish---we are simple kind of boring Thai eaters.....we like the pad see ew and it was brilliant. \u00a0But for three dishes to take out, it was $60. \u00a0And there was barely enough for a lunch leftover. \u00a0Very pricey for what you get. \u00a0I'm a fan, but probably only going back for lunch. \u00a0The flavor was delicious though. \u00a0So, yay there."], ["J K.", "Highly overpriced. Just spent over a hundred and twenty dollars at this place and didn't like the appetizer or dinners. We shared the Tom Yum Kung and the fish sauce was so overwhelming I couldn't a lot of it. The Basil Duck was extremely fatty and there was not much flavor. We also had the Red Curry Crispy Duck which was also one note. Both dishes had more fat than meat. For these prices the food should be amazing which it wasn't. Very disappointing."], ["Mary D.", "Very happy to see this particular type restaurant in this area. \u00a0Love it! \u00a0We had dinner, my husband & I shared the Pad Thai It was enough for two. The Pad Thai was so delicious, the service was excellent. \u00a0The ambience was so relaxing after a long day. \u00a0Our waitress Caroline was very attentive to our needs & service. \u00a0Thank you very much Caroline, we will be back."], ["Rachel A.", "Great food. Service was a little slow, but I wasn't in a rush. And the food made it worth it. A little pricer for a Thai restaurant than I've seen compared to other restaurants but if you're prepared for that then it's fine."], ["Mark B.", "We sat at our table for a good while before a waitress finally came over and took our order to spite the fact that it was a slow night and the wait staff was mostly hanging out and socializing at the food pick up area. \u00a0I ordered a bowl of Tom Ka Guy soup. \u00a0When my soup arrived I noticed the portion was much smaller than I had gotten in the past. \u00a0I mentioned this to my waitress who agreed it was less than it should be. \u00a0Later the manager came over and I showed him my portion and he got a small cup of soup and added it to my bowl that still fell short of what I had gotten many times in the past. \u00a0Later he brought over a soup bowl full of water to show me what a normal portion should be. \u00a0(This made it worse in my opinion.) I doubt we will ever come back. \u00a0I noticed the owner was not in the building. \u00a0I will try to contact him at the Charleston location to let him know whats going on when he is not there. \u00a0One thing I know for sure, South Carolinians wont tolerate cut portions especially at the prices they charge. \u00a0What a shame.04/04/15 Followup: I called the Charlotte branch 2 days ago after finding out that is where the owner was located. \u00a0I left a message with the manager about my experience at the Columbia branch and was promised a return phone call from the owner but to this day I have not received a phone call. \u00a0I'm starting to think nobody gives a rat's ass."], ["Simon T.", "Mediocre Thai.Comically expensive.Pretty light fixtures?"], ["Grace M.", "This place is great. I typically eat dinner later in the evening, so it is never super busy. But, I have been here when it is busy, and the food and service is still quick and great. Aaron is a great server. Their is a great cocktail selection and the bar is a good size in comparison to the establishment itself. I love the Thai hot pad Thai, red duck curry, and Tom yum soup! Fabulous. Be forewarned, the \"Thai hot\" is fairly spicy! But I love it. I tried the medium, and it just didn't cut it. Their peanut chicken skewers are good as well, if you don't want to venture off too far, in terms of trying new food."], ["M M.", "Ambiance is great. \u00a0Hostess was quick and attentive. Server was also quick to greet me. \u00a0Food is healthy, served hot and shortly after ordering. \u00a0Not many vegetarian options but my order (Red Curry with Tofu) was great. \u00a0Definitely recommend this place."], ["Bonnie H.", "Too pricy. Everything we tried was really tasty. Nice little cafe/bar. Terrible wait staff."], ["Tammy H.", "I love this Resturant. The Pad Thai with peanut sauce is excellent. The service is great!!!!"], ["Elyn B.", "So, I've been to the Charleston location several times and I've always loved it. Yes, it is expensive, but I've felt it was worth the price.Sadly, the Columbia location does not seem up to par. The dishes just weren't very special. I'd rather go to Bangkok (on Garner's Ferry) and pay half the price for twice the food and just not worry about the ambiance. I'll take the money I save and put it towards my next trip to Thailand."], ["Sotith S.", "Jesus what a great find. Ordered the beef larb and it was so good. This is coming from a family that makes larb constantly. Sorry mom. This was very very good. Then had the crispy red curry duck which was amazing. Everyone here is right. Ask the whole doing on that martini. Really good martinis."], ["Melissa C.", "well, I got an entire plate of pad Thai dropped in my lap tonight. don't worry, we paid for everything but the entree that ended up on me and the floor. likely to smell like Thai food for at least a year. stay classy."], ["Amanda F.", "If I loved the atmosphere here more, then I could have given more stars. But considering they just built this place from the ground up, you would think that they would have put more thought into the design.They do not take reservations so we showed up at 6:45 on a Friday and were told it would be about 45 minutes for a table for 5. There is a large communal table in front of the bar and they let us know we can drink there but not eat. (Odd, but ok?) We sit at the table thinking they had a cocktail server or something for it, but no, you must go to bar, order, and they will \u00a0bring it to you. Which would be fine, however this bar is TINY and they have HUGE chairs with tall backs on them blocking every access to the bar. So we yelled over a poor couple to try and get drinks while we waited.One hour and 15 min later they get us a table. We are sitting there and have ordered our drinks from the server, when the owner comes over and wants to know what our last name is because they think they sat the wrong table. Ummm what? We told him our last name and he said \"Ahhh, ok I will take care of this\". He didn't ask us to get up but what an odd thing to tell your table - you texted us to let us know that our table was ready so how did everything get so confusing?I will say that the food was very good - everyone loved their meals. It did take alot longer than expected for the food to come out, especially since by this point they were not that busy anymore. Highly recommend the duck salad - similar to a lettuce wrap and very good! Also the wontons were delicious! We will most likely come back and hope they have more kinks worked out!"], ["May L.", "Good ambience but expensive small plates of food. I now understand why their review was pretty bad. I probably will not eat here again until I have extra money I just like to throw on food can't even filled me up."], ["esther p.", "Tried this place for the first time last week. Went in for lunch at 2 PM, because we didn't know they closed at 2:30. My husband and I are pretty quick eaters, so we decided to eat and try to get out before they closed. Hostess was extremely nice and seated us quickly. The food was pretty good as well, but it came out within just a few minutes so I don't think they cook it as orders come in. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because our waitress was short with us and a bit rude. She answered questions with short responses; I'm assuming she was agitated that we came in so close to closing. Also, she didn't inform us that it would cost extra for some peanut sauce for the fresh spring rolls (they came with a sweet and sour type sauce...most other places give peanut sauce). The food was okay, but they lacked for service. I don't think I would come back here again."], ["Carl R.", "This place gets 5 stars. The waitress was perfect. Food was excellent. Everything went smoothly. I ate the pad Thai which was very good. It was a nice portion. Some would need a box. The chicken and shrimp wontons were great also! There is happy hour till 7pm and the drinks are $5. A bit pricey for Happy Hour, as many other places charge $3. However, I would recommend this place, and will be going back to try new dishes. Apparently, each one has a unique flavor."], ["Drew E.", "Love the one(s) in Charleston. Food is great here--and a welcome sight in this part of Columbia.

The atmosphere and service was excellent, but the food was not my favorite. \u00a0I got the egg rolls to start, which were very tasty, but the pad Thai I ordered was kind of mediocre, the cilantro on top was black around the edges, and I found the tips of the green onions that you would normally discard in my food.
