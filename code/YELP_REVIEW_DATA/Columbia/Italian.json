Still, they appear to fill it up, and I chalk that up to a matter of taste.I really struggled with what to order. \u00a0The folks next to us had a pizza and an order of seared scallops over risotto which looks fabulous. \u00a0Precious ordered the 6 oz filet and I ended up with the grilled pork chop. \u00a0Both of the meat dishes were very good, and Precious declared her tenderloin magnificent. \u00a0My problem was that both dishes were served with these things called potato cakes and a serving of grilled bok choi. \u00a0Now, I am a fan of bok choi, so my beef is not with it per se. \u00a0I just wonder about it being served at an Italian restaurant as a side on most of the dishes. \u00a0Getting past that, it was cooked by a quick grilling to pick up a char and then added to the plate. I don't think it was seasoned or oiled at all. \u00a0The green leafy end was tasty but 75% of it was devoid of flavor and otherwise inedible.My biggest complaint is with the creature called a potato cake. \u00a0It was ground something and then coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. \u00a0I truly could not pick up the taste of potato at all. \u00a0It had a ground mealy texture which I would have guessed as pureed beans before I would have guessed as potatoes. \u00a0In the end, the outside crunchy part had nice texture, but the dish was flavorless. \u00a0They should serve risotto or pasta as sides before they serve this concoction.Having said that, we are going back to order some of the pasta dishes and perhaps the pizza. I'd avoid the pricey meat dishes with very disappointing sides, or ask if they'll substitute."], ["Samantha A.", "We had a great meal here on a Saturday night. We made a 745 reservation the day of, and we were greeted and seated promptly upon arrival. We had a lovely little table by the window. Our server, Lilly, was amazing. We both started our meal with cocktails (a blood Orange martini and a gun fresco). Both of them were very fancy and very tasty. For the first course, we split a cheese plate. It wasn't overly large, but the array of things was very nice, the cheese was fresh, and it was plenty for two people. I paired mine with an Italian pinot grigio, he had a martini, which he loved. We decided to go old school Italian with our entrees. The menu had a little something for everyone, including some lovely seafood items. I had a Chicken Parmesan, he had a Veal Piccatta. Everything was absolutely perfect, and tasted great with the Super Tuscan we ordered. This place is a real gem, with a great, not overly fussy ambiance.

Then I ordered Buffalo chicken livers, they tasted great at only 8.00 for an appetizer I thought was good. After that I ordered the wood fired beef tongue which was good but not great. The bread came out after i was on my second appetizer piping hot accompanied with balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping. My wife had their spaghetti something or other, I'm not good with weird Italian name dishes. The pork meatballs were huge and kinda messed up the noodle to meat ratio. It's a hearty dish that is well worth the 17.00 price. Really liked this place and give it around 3.5 stars because I would like the beer prices to be shown on the menu and it's kinda of expensive here. Don't get me wrong the stars will rise if I find better items to eat on my next visit. Would also like to see the place open at 4:30pm so people can post up to the bar and wet their appetite with some seasonal cocktails.

I tried it for a second time mainly because I had a gift card for the first meal they screwed up and thought ok it's an Italian restaurant how could they mess up pasta? Well they succeeded admirably.

The last time I went was for my birthday and I ordered the mozzarella fritters and the most amazing Ragu di Bolognese--a new favorite. It was amazing, extremely flavorful with perfectly cooked pasta. It was love at first bite. I considered proposing (to the chef or the pasta, I'm not sure, but the experience definitely left me extremely happy).The service is always very attentive without being obtrusive.

The food is excellent and ingredients are sourced from local suppliers. My go to dish is their charcuterie board, which is a staple on their app menu. They also have a great wine selection and very competent bar tenders. What really sets this place apart from other places in Columbia is the service.

Desserts were not so exciting to me-there is usually a standard tiramisu and in the summertime some sort of limoncello based dessert."], ["David C.", "Eaton W's review is spot on. I will try and piggy back off of his well written review. In terms of gourmet restaurants in Columbia, I think it's between Rosso and Motor Supply for who has the best food in town. They have a pretty epic happy hour from 4:30-6:30. I seriously know people who plan their Friday schedules around this happy hour. I have eaten here a half dozen times, the menu changes daily. I have never had anyhting less than an excellent meal here. As girly as it is, I am a huge fan of their Rosso-Tini, it might be a perfect drink. \u00a0The atmosphere is spot on with dark cherry wood and deeply hued shades of red pain throughout. The kitchen is semi-open: you can't see the kitchen prep tables but you can watch your pizza cook in their wood burning oven. My only complaint with this place is from time to time the service is spotty. Which is weird because the service at the other Niemi eateries is top notch. Still, who cares when you consider the quality of the food and the fairness of the price."], ["Melanie C.", "I'm a huge fan of Rosso. I've eaten there many times and have never been disappointed by the food. For antipasti, I highly recommend the risotto fritto. Although fantastic on its own, the fire-roasted tomato jam is a wonderful side. Next, the insalata di casa is a must! The greens are always crisp and fresh and the gorgonzola and glazed walnuts add wonderful texture. The citrus vinaigrette is amazing and (although I've tried), it just can't be duplicated. Amazing salad! For the main course, the chicken parmigiana is wonderful and is a perfect-sized portion. I've also had the rack of lamb and was pleasantly surprised not to see the mandatory mint jelly that everyone thinks makes the dish \"classy\". Instead, it was dijon grilled and tender enough to cut with a fork. Yum! If you are looking for a vegan option, the maltagliati is a good choice if you don't want the typical pasta and marinara dish. It was light and filling, but honestly, I would call it more of a soup rather than a pasta dish. Next, I've read some negative reviews on the desserts, but I've found them to be delicious and not bland as other reviewers have said. I think some people just aren't used to authentic Italian desserts as we here in the USA are used to our sweets having ridiculous amounts of sugar. The Italians know how to make their sweets without causing diabetic comas. Finally, the wine list is fantastic and the decor and ambience makes it a great place to enjoy a meal. It should also be noted that they partner with local farms and co-ops for their produce and use organic, free-range chicken so if supporting local farms and sustainable farming practices is important to you, then this is another incentive to try Rosso."]], "Ristorante Divino": [["Ron V.", "Based on yelp reviews we decided to give this restaurant a try after 12 years living in Columbia! \u00a0We went here for the first time Friday night. \u00a0Complementary valet parking awaits you right in front of the restaurant and eases the pain of finding parking. \u00a0We had reservations for 7:00 but arrived about 25 minutes early and were immediately seated. \u00a0I guess it may have been a little early but the restaurant wasn't too busy at this time. \u00a0Not sure if this is normal or not for a Friday night. \u00a0The restaurant is smaller than what I expected, but the atmosphere is great. \u00a0Nice lighting, tables and booths, and a it is just right for a nice dinner or a more romantic setting for a special occasion dinner. \u00a0Not too loud and you can actually hear the person your with as compared to some of the other spots we've been to.The wait staff was excellent. \u00a0Our waitress was Casey and promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. They have a nice selection of wines on the wine list and she brought out waters, fresh hot bread with olive oil/pepper dipping sauce. \u00a0I wanted to order the calamari, as most yelp reviewers had given high grades for, but when we heard the Bruschetta description we ordered it instead. \u00a0The Bruschetta came with four crustinis; two with an avocado spread with tomatoes on top and the other two had a boursin/goat cheese spread with pulled pork meat from pork shanks on top. \u00a0Both were good but the pulled pork/boursin cheese was by far our favorites. \u00a0We would order this again in a heart beat.The Wedge salad looked appetizing but we passed on a salad since we had the crustini. My wife went out of the box and ordered the Parpadelle with a wild boar bolognese sauce. \u00a0She is not a big beef person but based on the waitress recommendation she ordered it. \u00a0I had a hankering for spaghetti and meatballs earlier in the week and decided to got with that. \u00a0I generally do not order spaghetti and meatballs and was tempted to try the short ribs or the gnocchi. \u00a0The waitress hadn't said anything about the spaghetti prior to me ordering it, but when I placed my order she said \"We have the best Spaghetti and meatballs in the city\". \u00a0Our entrees came very quickly. \u00a0To my surprise my wife loved the Parpadelle. I tried a bite of it and it was extremely good. \u00a0There was a taste that was unusual and after talking with the owner that came around to our table he said that they cooked the boar meat bolognese and add cinnamon and nutmeg. That was the taste that I recognized once he said it. \u00a0We both would order this again.My spaghetti came out and looked great. The meatballs were very tender and are made with the traditional veal, pork and beef mixture with a lot of spices. They were mixed with the spaghetti and had a little melted cheese (I believe mozzarella) over the top. \u00a0This truly was the best spaghetti and meatballs that I've had in Columbia. My wife tried a bite and also said it was excellent.We had to pass on desserts for the evening. \u00a0Total bill was $78 and that was for 3 glasses of Chardonnay ($8/glass) (not including gratuity). \u00a0We decided that this was one of our favorite restaurants and will definitely go back for special occasions."], ["Jane E.", "Quiet and upscale, but comfy in the busy downtown of Columbia. \u00a0Take advantage of the valet parking.

Not wanting to interrupt the flow of the meal, and feeling pretty full from other courses (which were not bad), I ate around the fish (the mussels, shrimp, pasta and sauce were OK). When the waiter asked how the meal was, I told her the truth, and even asked her to take the fish pieces back to the chef so he or she could see what they had sent out. A manager did come out and apologize, and they subtracted the amount of one cocktail from the bill (I did not ask for any kind of compensation).

While the meal was half way decent, the service and staff were deplorable. Skip this place and head up the road to The Pizza Joint (or anywhere else) -- I wish I had.I walked in to a cashier slouching all over the register. I told him it was my first time with them and I wanted to know how everything worked. He said, \"you order here and sit there (pointed finger).\" Clearly he didn't want to be there. I then asked what their most popular items were on the menu. He said, \"the pizza.\" Clearly he didn't want to be there. I ordered a medium pepperoni, mushroom and onion pie along with cheese bread and marinara sauce with an unsweet tea.He handed me my change and a styrofoam cup and said \"Here's your cup and your number. Enjoy.\" Clearly he didn't want to be there.I pick a table and walk over to it while I wait for my order. The table is set and looks clean. There were three different televisions to watch, which was nice.Apparently it's a \"fill your own cup\" type of place. So I did. I was never told this, even though I was a first time guest and even said as much. I sort of waited to see if someone was going to do it, and I eventually just got up and did it myself. At this point, clearly no one wanted to be here....The cheese bread was actually nicely done with a light crunch on the crust but not burnt at all. I enjoyed it. The pie I ordered came out shortly thereafter and was just \"ok\" by any standard. There was certainly nothing wrong with it, but I found nothing unique about it either. Throughout the entire meal I was approached twice by two people and clearly neither of these college-aged individuals wanted to be there... In fact, one (the same man who took my order at the register) was complaining to the other about cleaning a table. She complained back to him. Clearly they didn't want to be there.When I walked in I actually wanted to be there, but by the time I was done, I, along with their front of house staff certainly did not want to be there. Also? The takeout box was so flimsy (super thin cardboard -- NOT a regular pizza pie box) I nearly dropped the thing. I can't stand it when restaurant owners get cheap and cut corners on necessary things of this sort. The only reason I didn't give one star here, is because the food wasn't terrible.**Update** the pizza pie and cheese bread do not get better overnight. I took them both home and immediately put them in the refrigerator -- I have a penchant for cold pizza pie while I watch The Today Show in the AM. I'm disappointed in this one.

The atmosphere is trendy and metropolitan (which I LOVE), with stained wood, metal, and brick being the decor. The servers were knowledgable, friendly, and very attentive. The food was excellent - The three of us split the appetizer of guacamole and still had some left over. For my entree, I ordered the Spicy Sausage & Black Pepper Honey brick oven pizza, which was SO good! The spice in sausage paired perfectly with the sweet honey glaze that was drizzled across the pizza.

My lasagna was delicious, the bolognese sauce was 80% beef and 20% pork (or something close to that, I had to ask). There was a lot of meat, I got at least one chunk with every bite. The pasta was tender and so gooey and cheesy, perfect! My husbands shrimp fettuccine was also great, the shrimp were really tender and had a great flavor. The sauce on the fettuccine was lemon based and great. I'd have to say I do think it's on the pricey side (my lasagna was $16) BUT it was great tasting.

There seem to be a plethora of country kitchen type restaurants in the area, I was just not in the mood for that type of comfort food and I didn't want to make the drive to Columbia. Travinia came highly recommended by one of my local coworkers, had decent ratings and was not far to drive from where I was staying.I stopped in on Tuesday night and since I was dining alone, chose to sit at the bar. I was somewhat surprised to learn this was a small chain with locations in both Woodbridge and Leesburg. The menu and wine list had some nice options. This evening I was in the mood for pasta so I ordered the wild mushroom carbonara. The dish had a nice flavor and paired well with the glass of wine I had ordered, but I would have liked to see a bit more mushroom and prosciutto.So third night in Lexington and I am craving a steak and not the chicken fried variety. I remember that Travinia had a madeira filet on the menu - grilled angus filet, wine demi glace, cremini mushrooms topped with goat cheese. That with one of their wonderful wines by the glass sounded great so I headed back.I will say both times, the service was excellent. Bartenders were attentive and friendly. The hostess greeted everyone with a smile and a warm welcome. I noticed the bartenders knew many people by name - lots of regulars in this place. The space is cozy and inviting.This visit however is what caused my rating to dip. I ordered my filet medium rare - it came out more medium well to well. It was served only with garlic mashed potatoes, no vegetable. Yes, I could have sent it back, but frankly I was tired after a long day at work and just didn't want to wait for it to be recooked. The quality of the meat was not up to par especially for the price. My cut of filet was tough and grisly in parts. They were quite skimpy with the demi glace and it appeared as if the goat cheese had been scraped off the top of the steak - there was only the slightest smear. I have to admit I would have liked to see a bit more mushroom as well since it was advertised on the menu as a component of the dish. Frankly I have had better steaks at another well known Italian chain. While the atmosphere and service were great, the restaurant fell short in what I consider most important - the food. If Yelp had a half star rating, I would have bumped this to 2 1/2, but after my steak....I'll stick with a solid 2.

The Caesar and Giorgione salads are well-balanced and very tasty, the pasta is heavenly, and the Siciliana pizza... WOW. It would be worthwhile to return to Gio's just for this pizza.

For dessert, I am especially partial to the apple cake when they have it.Beverages: Gio's has a fun selection of beer and wine. I have yet to try any of their cocktails or martinis. They do carry limonata and aranciata, if you are looking for that.Ambiance: Gio's has an intimate, cozy setting that can suit any sort of occasion. Want to pop in for a casual dinner in jeans and a T-shirt? Fine. Celebrating a birthday or graduation? That works, too. Looking for a spot for that perfect date or anniversary dinner? Gio's is perfect. They also have seating in a lovely little \"courtyard\" area outside.Staff: Joshua has always waited on my table so far, and he is awesome. He's very cheerful and attentive and is certainly knowledgable about everything on the menu. I get the sense that he is super happy and excited to work at Gio's, which I suppose is not very surprising. :) I met Monica, one of the owners, the first time I ate here, and she is lovely.

If you don't know where it is, it is literally attached to the former Dianne's on Devine. Just park out in front of Dianne's and you'll see it. \u00a0 All wines are Italian (as should be in an Italian restaurant), and the food is clearly made by people who know and have traveled Italy. The pizzas are traditional, very thin crust, and very tasty. \u00a0Mozzarella is made in house every day which is obvious when you taste it with any of their salads. I had the Prianese salad to start. Fresh arugula, Italian tuna, mozzarella, fresh lemon, and olive oil. That's it....simple and delicious. The mozzarella oozes a little bit of milk when you cut it, mixing with the olive oil and lemon, to form a dressing. \u00a0The small portion of Italian canned tuna on top is a revelation for those who have only eaten Starkist or Chicken of the Sea. My wife's Caprese salad was also delicious. \u00a0We had a Margherita pizza and the Quattro Stagioni, a \"fpur corners\" pizza with an oozy egg in the middle. Cut the egg and it oozes on the pizza. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0Crisp crust and a good balance of ingredients, again very fresh and their own herbs from out back as well. The desserts are also homemade. Our son had the chocolate gelato and devoured it. My wife and I split the little cannolis which are 2 bites each and were also superb. Since moving to Columbia from big cities, we always lament over the food scene here. Good restaurants are rare and we had sort of given up, just preferring to cook ourselves instead of waste money. \u00a0Over dinner here, we kept saying to each other how excited we were to find this spot, and it's close to 5 Points! Our server Melissa also just moved here from Atlanta and studied in Italy with the same USC international program as George the owner. If you love true Italian (and PLEASE don't call Pasta Fresca true Italian), get \u00a0the word out....GOOOOO!!!!!!"], ["Christy W.", "Wonderful meal. The Caprese Salad was easily the best I've had.

All the entrees are included but there is a $4 upcharge for the ribeye and the salmon (which were the most expensive items on the menu).

It was slightly greasy cause it was deep fried and then had been drizzled in olive oil but we didn't mind it. I got the sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza which was delicious.
