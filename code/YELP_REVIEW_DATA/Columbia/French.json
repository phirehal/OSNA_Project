All of the crepe places in Paris, Japan, LA, Charelston, that I have had crepes in were given to me in a cone shaped paper and they never got soggy even with whipped cream put into them.

The fellow who took my order and prepared my Paris crepe seemed only interested in leaving work. He let my crepe sit for 6 minutes before bringing it to my table while he made my husband's crepe. Why he didn't use two crepe makers instead of letting my crepe get cold, I can only imagine was so he wouldn't have to clean two separate griddles.The lattes we ordered weren't prepared until after we had our breakfast, about 30 minutes after we ordered them. It wasn't overly busy either. Three tables, including ours, seemed to be too great a number for the 3 employees that were working behind the counter. Two of them though never so much as lifted a finger to help cook or prepare our lattes on time.I had ordered two sweet crepes as a treat for after breakfast but, unsurprisingly, they hadn't even started making them until we had already been there 45 minutes. Yes, it took them 45 minutes to even start thinking about making the second half of our order. Once the lattes and savory crepes had been made, I almost wish they hadn't. The latte tasted as if it was made with espresso dredged in burnt coffee grounds. It was so acrid we left the store with them and poured them out in the nearest trash can. My crepe was lukewarm at best after having spent 6 minutes chilling.

I think they should use pesto instead of the measly \"basil marinade\" on the chicken which you can hardly taste at all. My dad thought his Norway was just alright as well. Not special at all. My parents were disappointed. The decor inside is totally lacking, this place looks bizarre like it was supposed to be a waiting lobby but then they decided to make a kitchen on one end. The table we ate at appeared to be a conference table. Weird. Also, the owner is supposedly French.

Got the call pot roast (good, but not fantastic) and the lamb stew. The stew was SWIMMING in oil, I mean I spooned out a few spoons of oil and I didn't even make dent. The waitress did ask if I wanted to change it, so I got the mac and cheese, which was my second option anyways. I've had this before and it was good, but it didn't taste tight. The noodles were chewy and there was ALOT of oil. I ate it because it was edible, though I had to drain it of oil (yikes a million calories!!!). Not to mention the prices kinda suck all around.

Fresh ingredients and careful craftsmanship were evident in the food.The ambiance was rustic but friendly. The service was outstanding; our waitress deserved more than we could tip.

My sons and I loved all the food we ordered and the local beer I selected was very good."], ["Linda K.", "I had a lunch date with my sister here and had a pretty bad experience. The food took a long time coming out and when it did some of the items were cold and some were hot. Same goes for my sisters dish."], ["Jennifer B.", "We came in for a Sunday brunch, it was busy around the noon hour. We have to admit it was a great experience. \u00a0An 8 minute wait, but it was nice to see a nice crowd. \u00a0Dress was casual, but those coming from church were in their Sunday best. The portions looked small, but it was just enough. \u00a0Perhaps I was too hungry. It was refreshing to not roll out of the restaurant knowing I overate. My hubby finally enjoyed grits for the first time that were actually seasoned nicely. I attached some photos from Sunday Brunch. We will be back!"], ["Jansen T.", "Visiting the Vista of Columbia, my colleagues from here raved about this place. They delivered in my opinion. I had the hand cut pork shoulder with their special BBQ sauce over mashed potatoes. It was a great portion and tasted delicious. The service was prompt and friendly and I loved the fact the menu changes daily. It's a truly unique Columbia restaurant that should be on every visitors list."], ["Mathew H.", "Fantastic locally sourced food with a daily menu that changes. Handwritten for an extra splash of southern hospitality, this is a great restaurant in a beautiful setting. Service, food, ambience and creativity were all outstanding."], ["Arnold B.", "An excellent restaurant. A fresh eclectic (hand written by the chef) daily menu. The duck confit sandwich was absolutely memorable. Lunch prices are reasonable. Dinner is a little pricey. But truly a wonderful restaurant."], ["Robert V.", "My wife and I just found Motor Supply Co a couple weeks ago, and have already been back twice. This will be one of our regular spots from now on. It has a cool atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, and an amazing menu that (I think) changes every day. This place is one of the hot spots in town, so if you're not booking a reservation in advance, you will probably be waiting a bit. We made that mistake last time, but lucked out with a couple spots at the bar after a 15 minute wait.Street parking on Gervais isn't usually too bad, but they have a valet in case you don't find something on your first pass."], ["Hailey H.", "My boyfriend and I had a delicious meal at the Motor Company Bistro during a short stay in Columbia. Most impressive to us was how the restaurant sources all their ingredients from local farms. The ambiance was very nice as well. We would definitely recommend this to anyone!"], ["Erika K.", "The quality of the food is top-notch. \u00a0Everything tasted fresh and was artfully arranged. \u00a0I really liked the farm-to-table concept and the fact that the menu always changes. \u00a0Service was prompt and friendly. \u00a0While I enjoyed the ambience, I did find it a bit noisy. \u00a0Everything I tried was delicious, however the portions were way too small for the prices being charged. \u00a0My husband and I ordered one soup, one salad, two entrees (one of which was vegetarian) and one soda and our bill was $75 before the tip. \u00a0No alcohol, no dessert. \u00a0I left feeling hungry and ended up making a sandwich when I got home. \u00a0As previously mentioned, the quality of the food was superb, but one should not leave a restaurant hungry after dropping $75. \u00a0I think the restaurant needs to either lower the prices or increase their portion sizes in order to make a night out here worth the while."], ["Julie R.", "I really love the food here! I got the duck duo the last time I went here and everything was cooked perfectly. The duck had a crispy skin and was seasoned well. My husband had the porkchop which was excellent as well. Just know what you are getting into as far as the price goes! You pay \u00a0a lot for a little bit of food. I thought their portions were skimpy. There was literally a smear of sweet potato on my plate under my duck. Total of two entrees, a cheese plate, 2 cocktails and 2 beers was $122.00 without a tip. Excellent food, just some of the most expensive food in columbia!"], ["Charles M.", "Favorite nicer place in Columbia, SC hard to beat this place. They have a different hand written menu everyday and everything I have had is phenomenal here.The last time I went was for brunch, this was the first time I had been for brunch and man I have been missing out on probably the best brunch in Columbia.I had the Buttermilk biscuit plate with sausage gravy scrambled eggs with cheese grits and side of bacon. Definitely suggest trying this place for dinner or brunch if you go when it's nice out they have a sweet patio to eat on. A nicer place but definitely worth the $$ for some very high quality food."], ["Christopher K.", "This review is being written by someone that prefers to eat as close to vegan as possible but knows Columbia isn't up to speed yet so I try to eat low dairy, low/no egg vegetarian at restaurants.There aren't many nicer places in Columbia that have good vegetarian options. \u00a0Motor Supply is at least vegetarian aware and always has a vegetarian option on the menu. \u00a0When I went, that option was a cauliflower gratin. \u00a0The staff was also aware of the base stocks on the soups and thankfully one of them was fully vegetarian. I didn't order it but it's worth checking on.The cocktail list was fantastic and many of the drinks featured obscure Italian herbal liquors -something I enjoy. \u00a0I tried the playfully named 'shark with lasers'. \u00a0Delicious.If I need somewhere to fancy to take a business associate, this is not a bad option for me."], ["Roger F.", "This restaurant is currently enjoying a big financial turn-around, and you'll find it busy most nights. The mixology program is far and away the best in town, and the renovated patio is a very welcome (if loooooong overdue) improvement. They remain, however, at a concerning crossroads. The new chef seems a little more concerned with being a famous chef, and a little less concerned with consistent execution. Their commitment to local ingredients is very admirable; but if those ingredients end up in numbingly pedestrian entr\u00e9es, then who cares? And the pastry program is on life support. On great nights, main courses at Motor can be world class. The desserts, however, are stuck in an amateurish rut. Motor needs to recapture the excitement and unpredictability that made their menus the best in Columbia for a while. I really, really hope they do."], ["Ray D.", "Decent food, good cocktails, menu has confusing abbreviations, valet, excellent creme brulee. Visited South Carolina for a business trip and decided to find the \"Nicest/Best\" restaurant in the area. Read a lot of good things about this place on Yelp as well as some locals said it's trendy and has a \"hand written\" menu.Parking here sucks, but they do have a Valet service which is almost necessary. \u00a0Walked in, greeted by a hostess and took to our seats. Our server only checked on us a few times and she wasn't aware of what \"gluten\" was, so I had to educate. That made me deduct a star on it's own for such a \"fancy\" joint. The inside is very odd and doesn't really remind of you a Motor Supply Company at all, the bar was bland and not much was themed. It's a cozy romantic spot with wooden floors and tables shoved in there. Started with a Carpaccio appetizer which wasn't the best I've had and lacked in flavor and the cheese was almost like eating salt. The drinks however were excellent, I chose an Old Fashioned which was properly made and served with fresh fruit. The menu had 3 or 4 confusing abbreviations as to what stuff was so we had to wait for our server to ask what certain abbreviations on the menu was. Finally we were ready to order and one in our party ordered the \"fish\" and bam she told us they were out of the fish, could have said that first! Also to note the Ribs off the bone menu option is not \"ribs off a bone\" by any means, it looks like a filet Mignon cut into slices if your thinking about that option. Tasted nothing like ribs whatsoever. My friend & I ordered the $28 rib-eye and got 2 pieces of the most fat/gelatinous filled steak I have ever had. You could literally eat only one third of this rib-eye, hence the reason for 3 stars. Was probably the worst steak I've ever eaten for a \"fancy\" restaurant. Another one of us chose the Pork Steak with Sweet Potato Puree and I have to say that was the best dish out all of them. The sweet potato was delicious as well as the pork. The dessert Creme Brulee was excellent and tasted properly cooked and toasted just the right on the top. Was a great ending to a not so good meal. Pros:--Great Drinks/Bartenders--Great Desserts--Great Pork Chop/Sweet Potato--Valet ServiceCons:--Unreadable Menu Abbreviations--Confusing style of deco/theme--Rib-eye was pure fat--Ribs off the bone was misleading (it's a filet sliced up)--Service was not on par with pricesNext time I visit SC, I will probably drive to Charleston to try out their nice restaurants, Columbia has let me down."], ["Anna L.", "Excellent service and atmosphere but waited 30min for the food to come and was not delicious. I didn't quite understand the hype. I would not go back because portion is so small and very pricey."], ["Canita C.", "I just recently met a friend, that I have not seen in a while (my daughter's god mother), for brunch after church. \u00a0I had never heard of MSCB before she chose this place to eat. I was excited, because I love farm to table restaurants. But I was a slightly bummed, because I am a planner, and it's kind of hard to check the menu for future dates. \u00a0This was also a little exciting - I must admit.I had a very hard time finding the location, I didn't use GPS, but once I got out and walked, I found it right away. \u00a0I love the d\u00e9cor! \u00a0I could add a couch, TV, call it home and host some fabulous parties there for sure. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient. \u00a0I almost always get a mimosa when I brunch (and it's available). \u00a0But, I just wanted to something different. \u00a0We talked about a few other things, that I said no to, and I decided on the good ole mimosa. \u00a0She said if you really want something different you can get a bellini. \u00a0I said yes right away. It was not on the menu, but it was delicious!!She let us know what items were running out, which helped me decide. \u00a0I ordered the biscuit and gravy plate. \u00a0It's one of my favorite items for breakfast. \u00a0My friend ordered the same. \u00a0It did not disappoint. \u00a0The plate came with a biscuit on top of grits, covered in gravy, with a tomato and asparagus spear on the side. \u00a0It was so good, I ate everything on my plate. My one complaint would be - not enough gravy. \u00a0It was delicious and I wanted more.Earlier I mentioned that I had not seen my friend in a while. \u00a0I included that because apparently MSCB closes between brunch and dinner. \u00a0My friend had another mimosa, and me a cup of coffee, after eating. \u00a0So we were the last ones to leave. But I didn't feel rushed at all, in fact I was offered another cup of coffee. \u00a0BTW - the coffee was smooth enough to drink black.I am looking to go back again and try something different. \u00a0I wish I had thought to take a picture of my food.

I parked and walked around until I found it. Second I walked in and the host and hostess were more involved with their conversation than they were I greeting me. I felt rude for interrupting. Maybe I wasn't received well because I came by myself to brunch on Sunday. I watched others come in after me and get sat before me. Third the waitress just came said \"hi\" and looked at me. No explanation of the menu. Just hi. I asked for a water and she dropped it off and went to talk at the host station. No explanation of the menu or anything. So I just left. Walked by my waitress (that was still talking at the host station) on my way out and she didn't even acknowledge me. I was stopped at the door because an older couple was stopped at hostess station talking before they left.  New to Columbia and trying new restaurants. Felt let down by this."], ["Lea L.", "Inconsistently delicious.I have been here multiple times for both brunch and dinner and have found myself everywhere from elated to disappointed and in-between. Brunch is consistently impressive, dinner not as much.Decor is funky and modern with walls adorned by eclectic local art. It is a cozy place that may be a little too tight for some on the most crowded of nights. There is a cute back covered patio that is enclosed in the winter. It is a nice spot for dinner but the metal \"garden chairs\" are not the most comfortable for a long laid-back meal.It is chic enough for more formal dinner wear but still appropriate for casual dress.Unless you arrive early enough to snag a convenient parking spot, use the valet.The menu is released only a few hours before each meal and features offbeat pairings (sometimes TOO offbeat) and local fares. You can expect to find a steak (usually N.Y. strip or porterhouse) dish, a pork dish, a duck dish, a pasta dish and a fish dish.I have had steaks with 75% fat and dishes that seemed like they were just thrown together. On the flip side, I have also had the best Triggerfish I have ever had. Again, inconsistently delicious.The cocktails are always above average and I cannot boast enough about the Bloody Mary's--the best I have yet to taste in Columbia, though I do wish they were larger ;). Tip: splurge for the bacon bloody.The servers are consistently knowledgeable though at times they do seem to be understaffed.I seem to leave more impressed with their brunch than dinner every visit and highly recommend the chocolate ganache stuffed french toast if you are lucky enough to catch it on the menu.Definitely worth a visit--or two. One of the best spots in Columbia.Pros:- Locally sourced ingredients- Eclectic and ever-changing dishes- Great drinks/bartenders- The brunch- Valet service- Knowledgeable waitstaffCons:- Small space- (sometimes) odd art- Inconsistent and disjointed dishes- Parking- Menu difficult to read"], ["Will D.", "Definitely weighted by location. Probably wouldn't return if located in NYC or even Charleston, but the bar here, the daily menu printing, and the dedication to farm to table are 5+ stars for Columbia.

Always fresh farm-to-table food with local farmed ingredients often from City Roots.I have never had a salad from Motor Supply that has disappointed and tonight was no exception. The crab claw meat salad with sweet chili vinaigrette was so tasty! My mouth waters thinking about it. I also had the beet salad tonight (my staple at any restaurant if it is offered). There were so many coarse salt grains on it that the saltiness completely dominated the dish. I actually have never ever sent food back, but fortunately our waitress very graciously offered to remake it. It was much more to my liking when the salad returned without all the salt grains. Fish such as the mahi mahi are also consistently well cooked and not dry. I have had their salmon in the past as well. \u00a0The pork porterhouse was really amazing. Served with creamy sweet potatoes, the bacon gravy had a subtle cheesy quality to it. Wow, what a combo! They really complemented each other. I have had their duck (either confit or thigh form) at least twice now and it is not my favorite in terms of preparation ...it is often medium well done on the drier side as opposed to medium. For duck, I highly recommend Momo's.Finally, my only \"complaint\" is that their desserts never really impress me. Items are usually \"safe\" like a flour less chocolate cake or creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is usually on the menu. I would love to see something more innovative from their pastry chef, like at Terra. For that, I'll be docking one star because my sweet tooth demands it. :)FYI There are limited parking spots in the lot but they also offer complimentary valet parking if you dine with them.

Our server was exceptional. Bottom line : I enjoyed our dining experience but was hoping to have my first experience with fois gras and truffles. I didn't come to eat mashed potatoes and grits, however, they were delicious. The food and service was excellent which is why I gave it four stars.

We then ordered our entr\u00e9e's, I ordered the steak cooked medium with mashed potatoes and my husband ordered the pork with bacon steak and sweet potatoes.

So as you can imagine we were pretty hungry. Our meals finally arrived and my husband's was perfect. My steak was completely raw, like purple raw, not even rare. It took 5 minutes to flag the waiter down, which is long considering how small the place is. I showed him the meat and explained that I ordered it medium. He responded with \"the chef likes to prepare the meat rare.\" SO WHAT. I ordered it medium. He took it back and several minutes later they returned with what looked like a new steak and plate. Amazing how quickly it came out. O_o My steak was over peppered and salty, my husband agreed.

Yes the patio! \u00a0They've got this semi enclosed seating area with some amazing heaters mounted on the walls and it was perfectly comfortable. \u00a0That area's loaded with ambience: brick walls, leafy plants, dimmer lighting - which was great since the inside is pretty plain: mostly bare walls, plain wood tables and much brighter lighting.After that there isn't much to say: the asparagus soup wasn't bad, the wine was just ok, the pork roast was probably good but the sauce spread all over it was too spicy and not indicated on the menu. Since the plates weren't pre-heated the food cooled off quite fast outside.All in all it was a lot of money to spend for very little enjoyment. \u00a0We'll try another restaurant or three (for the price) next time."], ["Erin H.", "My boyfriend (who is a farmer, and was visiting from Colorado) and I came here. We didn't realize how fancy it was. We sat down and each ordered a beer. The waiter walked us through the hand-written menu, giving us recommendations and a more in-depth description. We also ordered a cheese plate as a starter. Not gonna lie, I was concerned when three cheeses came out with 4 slices of bread, because it wasn't going to be enough. Thankfully the waiter brought out more bread as needed. The cheese plate was delicious. They also brought out some fresh bread with a balsamic vinaigrette and oil to dip in, again, delicious. We both ordered a bone-in pork chop and purlough. When it got out to us, we were pleasantly surprised at the portion of the pork chop, as it was a pretty hefty portion. Seasoned perfectly and the purlough was great too. We left feeling like we hadn't been ripped off for the price and portion. We both agreed that some times when you go to a higher end restaurant like this, they charge a lot of money for a plate, and you're left wondering where the rest of it is, but that wasn't the case here.

Demi glaze, garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus and a big hunk of perfectly cooked meat. I'm still thinking about it a month later.

My other daughter had broccoli & cheese soup ($4) plus a turkey sandwich. \u00a0They were fresh & she enjoyed them very much.I had the twisted pasta in a cheese wince sauce with sun dried tomatoes, no meat, for $10. \u00a0Also added a salad ($10), hands down one of the best salads ever. \u00a0 Grilled asparagus & organic broccoli w/ 1/2 grilled corn, plus slices of cucumber & tomatoes on top of mixed greens, all topped with feta cheese & olive oil. Everyone tasted the salad & agreed it was the best of 5 dishes, with the steak being 2nd.Do yourself a favor, stop by for lunch & try it out. You will be back. \u00a0MSCB has the most reviews on Yelp w/average 4 stars. Personally we think it should be higher. Just for comparison, I spent $300+ (5 people) for my wife birthday later that night at a fine dining restaurant & we all said it wasn't as good as MSCB. \u00a0 Sorry no photos, we were too anxious to dive into the beautiful foods. \u00a0Sorry for the long post, but it was too good."]], "Beef 'O' Brady's": [["Mrs. C.", "Great customer service, very clean and good food.

I am hoping that our next visit here will improve our regards for the restaurant, but it will be some time before that happens. There was not anything that overly impressed us, service was slower than expected and the wine did not color my memories of Gervais & Vine in a positive light. The best summation is to describe the pizza we ordered as one of our dishes. The Greek Pizza we ordered was not well cooked and in some ways could be considered soft. The dough just was not cooked well enough to serve as a base for the ingredients nor were the ingredients tasty enough to serve as the toppings alone. With tapas food, each ingredient, each dish, must boldly carry itself with spices and flavors. The flavors here fell flat about halfway through the palate and only satiated our hunger, not our desire."], ["David A.", "Loved this place. My new favorite in Columbia.

Not sure, but it was delicious.Had to get something not so healthy. Been trying hard to stick to my plan. When you cheat it needs to be worth it. The eggplant fries were worth every bite!Scallops were recommended by our waitress. I am not always a fan. These can be fishy. These were awesome.

To give you an idea, we sat down at 8, and we didn't leave until 10:30p.m. And we all only had 1 or 2 drinks - it wasn't a crazy party by any means. The food is ok - nothing special, at all. The cheese plate is something you could easily create yourself from Publix. I had the scallops last time and they were horrible. They were served cold and I felt like they had been sitting awhile.

About 10 years ago, my job had me traveling in this area a few months out of the year. I got to know the restaurants in Columbia very well! Gervais & Vine was one of my favorites!

I started with an Ensalada Verde, basically mixed greens w/ balsamic vinaigrette. Next I tried Grilled Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Feta and a White Balsamic Reduction. This was a stretch for me because I've never had Brussels Sprouts before. I have to say, personally, that the addition of the other ingredients didn't make it particularly palatable. I only managed to eat two of the ten sprouts! Luckily, the waiter was able to remove it, even though I was perfectly ok with it remaining on the ticket.

I also had stuffed grape leaves that were mouthwatering. \u00a0The Roman pizza was just as good today as it was when I had it the first time. \u00a0The spinach artichoke spread was heavenly. \u00a0But my ultimate and final foodgasm came from the Chocolate Hazelnut Torte, which was THE best way to end an already over the top dining experience. I fell head over heals for the chocolate fluffy ecstasy, there's no other way to say it. \u00a0Todd my man, you've got mad culinary skills!"], ["Joe G.", "This place is an absolute joke. My first experience at Gervais & Vine consisted of many different plates of overpriced, undersized, and mediocre (at best) food that was shared between a group of six friends. We came for \"jazz night\", which was listed at two different times on the menu and website, but that wasn't an issue since there was no jazz anyway. Our waiter told us that sometimes they play jazz over the sound system, but that there hadn't actually been a live jazz band in a long time. When asked how their sangria was (it is watery, flavorless, no fruit), our waiter told us it would \"get us drunk\", and while we were all pretty taken back by this unprofessional remark at the time, in hindsight- I wish it did. Perhaps then we would have been intoxicated enough to not care about the rubbery, insipid cheese plate and cold empanadas. Our group of friends had multiple Living Social deals between us, so we all fought over who could use their's on the check (only 1 per table), because nobody wanted to go back. Unfortunately, I did not win that battle, so a couple of weeks later my girlfriend and I went back to burn the Living Social deal on some wine and dessert because how bad can that be, right? Bad. It can be real bad. After a brief glance at the uninspiring, grossly overpriced wine menu, we decided on ordering a couple of glasses of port to go along with dessert. Being a fan of both the Sandeman Ruby and Sandeman Tawney ports (which they had listed on their menu), I asked our waitress how the Sandeman Reserve compared to the two. Laughing, the waitress told us that she has no idea, because \"usually, people don't ask about the dessert wines so we sort of just pour them whatever\". She said that she wasn't even sure if they actually had those wines in stock. Nevertheless, she went in the back to see if she could find out any more information on it, and came back with a sample for me to try. She said they did not have the Ruby nor the Tawney in stock, and the wine I was about to taste wasn't actually a Sandeman Reserve, it was \"something else that they just say is Sandeman\". After I asked what wine it was then, she went in the back to fetch the bottle, came back with it, placed it down on the table, and said, \"this one.\" For dessert, we ended up ordering the almond joy bread pudding, which was miserable as well.

I ordered a burger and fries, which should be easy enough. The burger was horribly dry, the tomatoes were over ripe and mushy, \u00a0and the fries tasted like off-brand freezer fries, which were also terribly dry. I tried to get my waitress' attention to ask for some ketchup or anything to save the burger, and I was ignored.

The questions are hit or miss, but it's a very popular spot for the game. Food-wise, it's pretty legit. I'm a gigantic cheese fries fan, and I must say that they could afford to put a little (read: a lot) more cheese on theirs. Apparently they make their own ranch dressing, and though it's not as thick as others, it's very tasty. The au jus sauce for their roast beef dip is tangy aka excellent. My boyfriend always gets the spinach and goat cheese salad and he basically worships it. Parking is decent because it has a back lot.

I asked that my party (girlfriend and 20 month old child) be seated on the enclosed patio in the non-smoking section of the patio. We were promptly seated in that section and served almost immediately by Jennifer and a trainee. Our experience with them was fine. While we were eating our food a couple sat in the table next to us, which was part of the non-smoking area as well. We asked the server to do something about this issue. She informed us she would ask the manager (Robert Stolberg) to address the issue. Several minutes passed and Mr. Stolberg had not come out to address the patrons who were smoking (two cigarettes completed by this time). I got up from my table and asked the server where he was and she told me he would eventually come to our service. I instead went to the back of the restaurant and requested that Mr. Stolberg do something or clear our check if he would honor the non-smoking section of the restaurant due to health concerns. He refused and explained he was powerless to do anything since he was not issues a summons for a non-smoking offense. I was very frustrated and asked one last time if he would do anything for me and my family. He dismissively said he would not. I was upset that Mr. Stolberg did nothing, he didn't even bother to offer different seating to help relieve the smoke bothering me and my party, which included a small child. In addition the table across from us also complained about the issue and he did not come out to address them either. I was very upset about this and his lack of concern with loyal patrons and his dismissive demeanor towards those of us who complain about things that affect our health. I have mentioned this issue to a friend of mine who works at DHEC and city code enforcement since Mr. Stolberg feels he cannot control the issue himself. I told both contacts I would let them know the results of my inquiry via this letter.I am saddened by the response I received from management on this issue. I have been a loyal customer for a number of years! In summary,* Two customers complained about the smoking and the manager did not come out to address the issue, ever and we were there for close to an hour and a half.* I directly brought the matter to the manager's attention and he refused to address the customers who were smoking. I seems to me, If I performed ANY activity deemed inappropriate by management (disorderly conduct, fight, swearing, theft, etc.) management has the right to remove me from the property. By extension, management's lack of action appears to condone the act of smoking in an area in which smoking is not permitted. Please note the area was enclosed since it was raining. Does this mean those who smoke indoors would not be asked to leave. His position does not make sense to me. He never tried!* The manager refuse to accommodate my family or the table across from us who also complained. I thought if he was going to condone the idea at least accommodate me and my family since the smokers are more important. At the time I really wanted one of several things from the manager ask that he address the offending table who was smoking, a comped check for lack of action, \u00a0move my party to a different area, etc. none of this occurred!The food is great but the manager I dealt with that day it was not a good experience."], ["M.

My overall impression: Good food, but overpriced. I went for dinner on a week night and had no issue walking right in. The space is huge and the atmosphere is nice. They have a nice drink menu, but $10 for a martini isn't something I'm used to in Columbia. That's Atlanta or Charleston pricing. Next time I'll stick with beer.To start, we had the bloody mary fried oysters - good, but not great. I wouldn't order them again, and I love oysters. I had the special entree which was a Parmesan encrusted pork chop and it was to die for. I really enjoyed it. This was the best part of the meal (luckily)The food was definitely good, however it wasn't amazing. The prices are on the level of Oak Table, and I just didn't feel like the experience was the same. I think for a \"casual fine dining\" restaurant in Columbia, $10 for a drink is just insane."], ["Jessica D.", "I absolutely love this place! I always get the almond-crusted tilapia with a substitute of their homemade Mac and cheese on the side. Their Mac and cheese is absolutely killer! I always have to get it! I love their strawberry mojito and their wine selections are amazing! The servers are always polite and knowledgeable. The only bad time I've had is when they were out of mussels and the bartender was not notified and after my date received his food did the bartender find out they were not able to make my food. The management handled it great from there.

They had the giant windows open, which created a nice breeze and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. However I was blown away by the prices and lack of pizzazz on the menu. Nothing stood out to me, nothing made me say \"wow that sounds fantastic\". I can get steak and potato anywhere, the prices and lack of creativity made it seem a bit pretentious. So I ended up spending more time trying to figure out which protein came with the most sides. I ended up with the cedar plank salmon.When it came out, again I was taken aback at how small my portion was. To make matters worse it was presented on a very large plate, making it seem even smaller. But, the saving grace is that the salmon was good. It was moist, with perfect texture and had a very nice sweetness to it. The sides seemed to be more of a garnish, since I did not get many. The salmon saved my review from being lower than three stars.

When we finally get seated we ordered three appetizers which all ended up being great! We ordered the BBQ springrolls, the hummus trio and the shrimp dumplings. The BBQ eggrolls were the favorite and they came with this amazing mustardy BBQ sauce I wanted to dip my whole meal in. After appetizers our group ordered shrimp and grits (to die for), crab cakes (lots of crab), pork tenderloin (didn't try), spiced chicken (ehhh..ok), and a lamb burger (told it was good). Then as no dinner out is complete without dessert, we ordered bread pudding, hazelnut mousse and the chocolate brownie which came with homemade coffee icecream. I know this sounds gluttonous but we did have Five people!! The best dessert was by far the bread pudding..OMG It was delicious. It came \u00a0out with a vanilla icing drizzle and it didn't have raisins (which I hate). \u00a0Also notable was their strawberry basil mojito. It was the best I have ever had!

I ordered the lamb meatball with potato dumplings. \u00a0I was expecting perhaps knodel or gnocchi with a savory and moist meatball. \u00a0The dumplings were more like coquettes, but not lightly fried, and a bit too starchy and raw tasting. \u00a0They were bland--some egg, flour, and salt would have greatly improved their texture. \u00a0The meatball was far too lean, leaving it dry. \u00a0I'd suggest sticking with ground chuck or introducing some fat to the lamb for texture and flavor. \u00a0The tomato sauce was good. \u00a0Portion sizes were acceptable, leaving us with enough food for another meal.We couldn't decide between the s'mores mousse and berry milkshake, so we got both. \u00a0Both were pretty good, but I'd suggest picking just one and splitting it. \u00a0We suffered from sugar overload by the end of our meal.The reason, though, that I give this restaurant 2 out of 5 stars, is that I just don't think the food or ambiance quite stacks up to other restaurants in Columbia, or at least exceeds any of them. \u00a0The quality of the menu items was inconsistent, in spite of what we ended up paying for the meal. \u00a0Cola's is going to be one of those restaurants for me that was an okay dining experience that I don't plan on repeating; it's not something I'll ever be in the mood for--Cola's lacks the character in a restaurant that keeps me coming back.If you haven't tried it yet, go for it. \u00a0I won't be surprised if you have a much better experience that we did--I'd chalk that up, again, to inconsistency."], ["Noel H.", "Atmosphere was comfortable.

Was told by the hostess that she already had 8 people on her waiting list and she wasn't taking anymore names for the day. That is just bad business. I'm here an hour and a half before closing and you are telling me you won't take my money? That's confusing to me. Also, I love your brunch and I'm rarely off on Sunday's and when I am, I just want to be able to get my hash browns ok?Most of the male staff here is awesome. We love Ryan and John most of all. All but one of the female staff have attitude problems. I don't know if that's supposed to add to their local charm, but it's obnoxious. I've held off on writing a review for here for a long time, but it was time to interrogate reality and ask myself why I am tolerating rude waitresses, abnormally long wait times, being turned away and even in one case my fianc\u00e9 and her friend were asked to leave while they were drinking coffee because they needed the table. And honestly it always feels that way, like you're being rushed to leave. Sunday funday is not about being rushed, it's about sipping mimosas and relaxing. 116, we've had some good times, but I'm really going to question myself before coming back because I just can't accept the mediocrity and refusal to expand your seating or change venues to accommodate your ever growing customer base. I want to return but I want you to interrogate reality yourself and come to these conclusions on your own. Read the book Fierce Conversations and let me know how that goes.

I topped my wonderful meal off with a delicious coffee cordial which is so rare in this area. Even though this didn't effect my food, I am taking off 1 star because the bartender added chocolate chips to another customer's food item with his bare hands; no immediate hand washing prior."], ["Lea L.", "Simply put, this is one of the best brunch spots in Columbia.I have been here a handful of times for brunch and have enjoyed each visit. Be prepared to wait, we have sat at the bar a majority of our visits and still had to wait 30+ minutes.It is a small hipster-ish place with local art adorning the exposed brick walls. It gets very noisy and is always packed. All the bartenders and patrons around the bar area seems to know each other giving it a neighborhood joint kinda feel.The cocktails are amazing; inexpensive and strong. I did not like the Gazpacho Bloody Mary, it was too thick and tomato-y for me. The Nutty Rusputin was incredible, a must try if you like frangelico/hazelnut/kahlua.The biscuits and chorizo gravy plate makes frequent appearances on the specials menu and is a great twist on the classic dish. Highly recommend if you are biscuits and gravy fan.Most recently, I had a black bean and cheddar baked stuffed poblano pepper with cheddar grits and two sunny side up eggs. I have never had anything quite like it. It was one of those meals you find yourself daydreaming about.It is very well priced (Shrimp & Grits for $7? though I have heard not great things about it) staff is friendly and attentive and menu selection is unique.If you find yourself in the area on Sunday, I highly recommend getting out of bed early for this place!"], ["Allison P.", "My go-to place for Sunday brunch! You can't go wrong with a couple mimosas and an omelette. They let you get whatever toppings you want without charging extra. It's a small place but definitely worth the wait."], ["Tonia R.", "This is the best place in the Columbia area by far for brunch. \u00a0Since I eat out everyday I feel to give this local charmer 5 stars is making quite a statement. Service is prompt and polite. We'll worth the drive across the Gervais St bridge."], ["Daniel B.", "Great and unique menu full of fresh options. Excellent bar (bloody Mary's) selections. I very much enjoyed my brunch"], ["Frank M.", "This place is pretty fantastic. \u00a0Overall, the restaurant is pretty small and I'm sure would be filled up pretty fast on a busy day but it has a very nice look/feel. \u00a0I visited on a Tuesday night \u00a0(2/24/15) for dinner and there were only a few people there. Sat myself at the bar, which is a pretty decent size, and the bartender introduced himself and listed off some specials. \u00a0Decent selection of beer.I had the warm blue cheese dip for an appetizer and one of the specials, sweet potato raviolis, for an entree. \u00a0The blue cheese dip was very flavorful and hit the spot, bread was very fresh. \u00a0The raviolis were, how you say, amazing...came with a thick creamy white sauce topped with blue cheese....couldn't get enough of it. \u00a0Ryan, the bartender, is a pretty cool guy and knows his stuff. \u00a0Definitely makes the dinning experience better. \u00a0I can tell this place takes care of their customers. \u00a0If I were to go back to Columbia, this place would be on the top of my list!"], ["Rick T.", "My dining experience was once again super fantastic at 116 Espresso and Wine Bar. The moment you arrive you are greeted and have delicious drink within minutes depending on how many people are here. Last night the place was quite full, but that never stops the staff from taking care of business. We started off with a scotch egg which is local sausage fried around a egg, very tasty. Then we had a Cuban pizza with plantains which is good but I like the flank steak pizza here much better . After going through that we had another round Bells two Hearted a great beer from Michigan. And soon after that with had Cuban style shrimp on toasted baguette that paired well with the beers we were drinking. This is only my second dinner here, but I might have to change that, I hit this place for brunch at least once a month. Eating local is the best don't let anyone convince you otherwise!"], ["Theodore D.", "Showed up at 10:25 on Friday night. Kitchen closed. \u00a0Advertised as being open to 11. \u00a0 So, call ahead to make sure. \u00a0NOT a complaint. \u00a0Just the facts. I like the place and go fairly often-great limited menu and wine list--but seeing the carpets rolled up all over town on Friday nights at 10:00 is irritating. \u00a0I'll go for make-up brunch soon."], ["Anthony A.", "Great food, great service. The restaurant is a bit small, and crowded. But the dining experience is still wonderful. \u00a0The service won me over and the food was fantastic. It really wasnt all that expensive either."], ["Adrianna S.", "Great food, great wine, great service! Sat at the bar during Happy Hour...loved it! Ryan is fantastic and makes you feel very comfortable. Had the crab cakes, plate with chimichurri sauce and paella. I would recommend all of them. When and if I am back in Columbia, I will definitely be back!"], ["Tiffanie C.", "I came 8pm on a Tuesday . Not too crowded , convenient parking . LIVE music! I ordered a bottle of wine $26 which I was allowed to cork and take the rest home. Ordered the daily special which was shrimp and andouille sausage over cheddar grits. Awesome and rich. Took half of it home. Also tried the cheese plate which tonight consisted of a balsamic soaked parmigian, a smoke bleau, and an apricot Stilton cheeses served with orange slices, strawberries and almonds. Total bill $53 with tax but worth it!"], ["Collin S.", "A few weekends ago, I decided to check out the brunch scene in Cola since I'm new to town and coming from the northeast corridor (DC-to-NY), brunch is a weekend pastime.Relying on the Yelp reviews, I was hyped to learn about the stuffed french toast. \u00a0However, it was all gone when I arrived. \u00a0Unfortunate, since the place was only open for about 2 hours at that time. \u00a0So next time, I suppose I'll try to get up and arrive by opening at 10AM.I got the shrimp and grits. \u00a0I normally like shrimp and grits, but this was interesting. \u00a0The standalone grits were very, very good. \u00a0However, the tabasco topping/sauce was gross and overpowered the rest of the food. \u00a0Also, there were too many peppers/onions/tomatoes in the grits. \u00a0Lastly, the shrimp was very clearly undercooked. \u00a0Veins were not visible, the shrimp was all white, and a few pieces tasted gritty and tasted like seawater...the hallmarks of undercooked and/or raw shrimp or shellfish. \u00a0Since I didn't want to spend the rest of the day listening to the NFL playoffs from the comfort of my face in a toilet, I picked around it and tried to choke down the grits.My recommendation would be to simplify the grits dish. \u00a0No need to change up what are clearly very tasty grits on their own. \u00a0And actually grill the shrimp if it's supposed to be grilled, come on.Despite my rating, I'll try to come back and try again...hopefully with french toast available."], ["Ashly G.", "Food is decent but getting a table on a Sunday for brunch is heinous. After waiting for half an hour for our table, it was given to someone else who claimed to be us. \u00a0After the hostess was informed of this, she did go and ask the couple about it. They admitted to taking our table but didn't bother getting up. Rude! \u00a0To add insult to injury, the hostess did nothing about the situation and we waited another 10 mins to be seated at the bar. \u00a0Was the food worth the wait? No. \u00a0The bartenders were, however. \u00a0They were not only professional but very charismatic which made the wait ok. \u00a0Might consider revisiting on a less busy day."], ["Ashlee F.", "Shrimp and grits were quality well seasoned, good portion with plenty of shrimp. Crustless quiche bacon spinach and Swiss the eggs were fluffy and creamy very light with Bacon crumbles, I just with the spinach were beat into the eggs rather than on top. Caramel apple stuffed French toast was good. Very rich. For a small city like Columbia the brunch was good."], ["Kenny K.", "Incredible brunch! HUGE fan of 116! In my opinion, it's the best brunch in the city. I had the chicken and waffles and it was incredible. My wife had the steak and eggs and she loved hers too. I've never eaten there in the evening, but please believe that their brunch is worth a trip. I'll be back this weekend!"], ["Amanda R.", "Their brunch is absolutely amazing. \u00a0High quality, delicious food at great prices. \u00a0Wonderful mimosas. \u00a0The hashbrowns are a must-try. \u00a0Great service and friendly staff. \u00a0I need to try dinner now!"], ["Neal S.", "Went there for a pre night at the zoo snack.Great food and service."], ["Kristy Q.", "This is a great local spot. The food is Spanish inspired and really delicious. Very small interior - but feels cozy, not cramped. \u00a0Creative cocktail list!"], ["Amanda F.", "Becoming one of my favorite gems in Columbia. \u00a0Finally got to make our way in for dinner with another couple. Server was attentive and offered great suggestions. Started off with a round of drinks - I got the American Harvest drink special - some sort of basil and vodka concoction and it was delish! Moved on to apps to share - baked Brie with peach chutney (app special), mussels, fried green tomato and crab cake Napoleon. Yum yum and YUM! One of the people with us doesn't even like mussels and said he is now a fan! The broth with the mussels is to die for! Moving on to entrees - I got the Huevos rellanos and the ensalada 116. Just stop what you are doing now and GO GET THE HEUVOS RELLANOS! Sounds weird - tuna and deviled eggs?! Just trust me and go get it!Food coming out was perhaps a tad slow but for a tapas style restaurant, I am fine with that."], ["Schylur W.", "We had krisslynn and received excellent service. The menu had a pretty good variety and the server was very knowledgable of it. Did a great job recommending items. Drank an old fashion. Wasn't a fan of their version with the sugar cube. The drink was very strong, which is good and bad. Taste was off, but obviously can't complain about strong drinks. Food tastes excellent. Great date spot as well."], ["Damon S.", "My favorite tapas restaurant in Columbia! VERY small, it's a hole in the wall. Love how they have small tapas plates as well as larger, entree size plates as well. We haven't had anything bad here! The fried green tomato small tapas plate is AMAZING! I always recommend this place to anyone looking for a new restaurant to hit up if they haven't been there."], ["Gregory G.", "This is one of my favorite spots in all of greater Columbia! If you don't mind driving across the bridge in Cayce/WestCola then check this place out. I've been coming here for years and the food is always delicious. The restaurant itself is a bit on the small side, kind of Brooklyn, NY style, but the decor is cool. The bar staff is fantastic and table service is usually great, even though some of them give you \"hipster indifference\" during the service interaction. I really have never had a bad meal here and I always bring my out of town friends here for a great bite. If you're looking for a great brunch spot too, then this is your place. Tri-Color hashbrowns...mmmm...Enough said."], ["Danita R.", "You know how you drive by a place all the time on your way to everywhere else, and you look over, see it and think, \"That looks like a cute spot,\" and you keep on driving? 116 looks like that kind of place. I was passing through town myself when a couple of friends lulled me into what seriously looks like a hole-in-the-wall. And you know what they say about gettin' your eat on in the hole-in-the-wall ...And if you don't know what they say then I suggest you go and grub on the Grilled NC Berkshire Pork Chop. \"P\" is for pork chop and perfection. (I am a terrible food photographer, but y'all 'twas scrumdiddlyumptious.) The accompanying Greek orzo pasta salad was fresh and light, and overall the plate made for a filling and tantalizingly tasty combination. You know it's good when someone else at your table keeps one eye on your plate the whole time they're eating their food! That is not at all a cheap shot to the chimichurri tasting plate, but it's just what it says--a taste. The pork chop is perfectly portioned and righteously grilled.My friends and I shared the spinach and artichoke dip. It was warm and rich and plentiful, a great setup for a filling, but not too full meal.Marvelously attentive and courteous staff; artsy-neat decor in a sweet 'n small intimate setting (just a few tables in this spot); interesting variety on a menu that uses fresh and local (and delicious) fare. A bit bummed I didn't enjoy a cup of coffee, but the sangria hit the sweet spot :) If you keep driving by this place you're missing out on good people and great food (at really great prices, too)! Stop going for the same ol', same ol' and try something new--116's staff won't disappoint!"], ["Amber G.", "I really wanted to like this place. My friends and family rave about it, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that I just had a bad experience. It wasn't especially busy when went, but it took an unusually long time to get our food. \u00a0The service was friendly, though. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which I usually love. These simply weren't very good. The grits themselves were tasty, but the Tabasco sauce topping wasn't even mildly spicy and resembled canned condensed tomato soup in both flavor and appearance. The shrimp had an odd texture as well. I'd be willing to give 116 another try, but I would definitely order something different next time."], ["Michael M.", "Great food at this little restaurant on State Street. We just had a Sunday brunch 25 dollars which includes 3 entrees for 2 people. Definitely try the 3 potato hash browns."], ["Stephanie V.", "My favorite restaurant in Columbia. I've been here several times and each time the experience was close to perfect. \u00a0Food is consistently spot-on, especially the crab cakes, cioppino, and smoked tomato bisque (this coming from a girl who loathes tomato soup - seriously, just try it). \u00a0Service is always friendly, ambiance is hip enough that the place would be at home in some city infinitely cooler than Columbia, and from that side of the river, downtown glitters and gleams like somewhere you'd actually want to visit. \u00a0And reasonable prices to boot!My one gripe is that for a restaurant that bills itself as a wine bar, I think the wine list is pretty unexciting. \u00a0But if you don't find an appealing vino, a tiramisu martini or one of the other intriguing concoctions should make for a good consolation prize.Also, be forewarned that it gets super loud and crowded during peak hours (people know what's good!), and parking can be a bit of a mess, so I'd suggest going later in the evening if you want to have a conversation with someone, or with yourself."], ["Ken H.", "After deciding to visit Columbia for the first time on a whim to see a concert, we stumbled upon this little place as it was right near the New Brookland Tavern. We lucked out and scored the last table. The restaurant is setup shotgun style - very narrow. For this tapas place, it definitely adds to the ambiance. Almost all of the small plates - baked feta, mussels, and portobello cap were delicious. The only miss was the jam\u00f3n y melon. The ham wasn't quite salty enough and the melon a bit under ripe. The large plates - chimmichurri sampler and pork shank special were excellent. The drinks were inspired and surprisingly cheap at $6-7 a pop. The service was very friendly and paced appropriately. You can tell they have a small staff but still work together well to get the job done. Should another trip to the Midlands be in the cards, I'd definitely double down on 116 again."], ["K P.", "We found this wonderful spot just after moving from Atlanta. We had high expectations, but 116 didn't disappoint. AND THE PRICES - what?? We're not in Atlanta anymore and maybe that's a good thing! Great little spot for dinner and brunch. We take everyone here when they're in town to visit! The restaurant is also located close to the Cayce RIverwalk, which is convenient for an after meal walk when you're just too full from all that goodness!"], ["Annie D.", "This adorable neighborhood cafe is the cafe every neighborhood should have. Especially at brunchtime. Or at wine time, I imagine.The service was so.damned.friendly for brunch. It's a small venue, so the staff let us know there would be a bit of a wait. We shared the little waiting area with some charming older ladies, who were on a double date with their husbands. It was kinda rainy and the husbands dropped them off first before they parked the car. Gentlemen, take note.I ordered the three-potato hash with gold, purple and sweet potato, peppers, jalapenos, onions and goat cheese. Also, fried eggs on top. It was spicy, tasty, starchy, eggy... exactly what I was in the mood for. It was delicious enough that I can't even remember what my fiance ordered.It's a wine bar, but they also offer a full set of Bloody Marys, spiked coffee drinks, cocktails and margaritas. Also... four kinds of Russians (not just the white ones!).Thanks for a lovely morning, 116!"], ["Brandy W.", "This place just keeps getting better and better. \u00a0My first visit was over a year ago and I remember the plantains were fabulous. On my second \u00a0visit, \u00a0they were a bit disappointing. \u00a0On my third visit they were very good but I branched out and tried the Lebanese eggplant. \u00a0IT. \u00a0WAS. \u00a0SO. AMAZING. \u00a0FOODGASM! \u00a0The dish was totally different than I expected but so light and refreshing! A flavor explosion! \u00a0 In our most recent visit, every dish was excellent. \u00a0 We started with the Lebanese eggplant with some awesome bread to soak up that tasty broth, then an amazing artichoke bisque, \u00a0the delicious chefs pie (flatbread pizza), \u00a0then a fantastic key lime pie from Florida. \u00a0Did I mention the $18/bottle wine special???? \u00a0And the excellent service??? \u00a0 Sometimes it's very crowded and loud, \u00a0and this is why!!!"]]}
