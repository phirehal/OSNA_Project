My favorite things to order are:Tempura asparagus (one of the best apps in town)Crazy caprese salad (a perfect summer lunch)Chorizo nachos or chicken & chorizo tacosQueso (with beans) dipAnd most of their rolls are fantastic It's a small place, so it can be hard to get in but it's totally worth the wait, just get a drink at the bar (they do take reservations for parties of 5 or more)."], ["Joshua F.", "Amazing restaurant!

We got the firecracker roll and it was good for the price but wasn't anything I'd particularly return for. And the fish tacos this time gets a thumbs downs. It was really bland and I didn't get that zingy taste as I usually do. We ordered a Bloody Mary and I don't know if it was the mix they used or something but we had them take it back. Too spicy (and I like spicy so that's telling you something)I probably will only go back if I plan on just ordering sushi and oysters.

Background - I have spent significant time in Atlanta and New York, and know a good sushi from a bad one. After waiting 45 minutes after my reservation, my party of 3 was seated. Note that there is really no place to wait here because the restaurant is so tiny, so you kind of just stand around and look at everyone trying to eat their dinner. Sushi was terrible. I literally could not finish my sushi because I was starting to get that gut feeling that I would get sick if I continued to eat this food. Location is great, right across from the Statehouse. Parking is free if you can find a spot in their parking lot with maybe 15 spaces. The experience was rushed and cramped, especially for the price. There is a lot of room for improvement."], ["Stephen R.", "Ok finally ate here, tried a few times but they had standing room only and I do not wait for food. I ate here during lunch when most roads were closed for a run. I started with the largest jalape\u00f1o poppers known to man. They were fantastic....not nuclear but filling and the wasabi sauce was perfect. They were covered in a homemade like crust and filled with cheese.Then I made room for scallop tacos. They were fried (crispy on outside juicy inside) and all the ingredients were fresh (guacamole, tomato, lettuce). The beans were plain, and the salsa was meh but it was a filling lunch for sure!The waiter was all over it, refilled my drink, made great recommendations and got me a to go cup for my tea."], ["Arlene D.", "I don't get it and the sushi was horrible. Rice was hard flavors not good. We started with calamari for an appetizer and they were chips. Calamari should not be hard like chips. Rainbow roll, spider roll were dry and unflavorful.

The Fish Takos are the best and the sushi is amazing."], ["Eric H.", "I went into Tako Sushi not realizing that \"Tako\" in context of their title isn't meant to be \"Octopus\" in Japanese (plenty of places do this). Rather, after my experience I'm pretty sure it's a deliberate and confusing play on words where \"Tako\" is literally replacing \"Taco\" with a k. Let me explain. The concept this place has going for itself is Mexican-Japanese fusion. The interior reminds me of a diner (with a sushi bar) in Albuquerque--southwestern art/pottery everywhere. That's totally cool/hipster/modern and I'd be willing to buy in. The problem is the majority of their menu items don't fully commit to any combination of Mexican and Japanese cuisine and the few that do are pretty weak offerings that feel/taste like neither. Smoked salmon quesadilla/southwest tuna tartare... really though? Honestly all of that would have been okay if their distinct menu items (I had a few rolls) were good. Unfortunately, they weren't anything spectacular. Bottom line, if you're looking for nigiri/sashimi/Japanese food in general, this is not the place. Their burgers or their tacos might be alright but I wouldn't have high expectations based on my experience with the sushi. It's beyond me why this place doesn't try and sell itself more as a fusion place because I wouldn't be opposed to having a beer or two with some chips and guac here. Don't get it twisted though, go elsewhere for your sushi fix."], ["Robert V.", "Interesting mix of Far East meets southwest. This was just my first visit, so I can't comment too much on the menu, other than my wife had some delicious carne asada that made me jealous!I had the grilled tuna, which was good, but I didn't like the pairing with beans...odd aftertaste. They're good with substitutions, so be creative and ask away! I had extra veggies, which were great.The decor and atmosphere were well done, and the hot green tea excellent."], ["Toni S.", "The service was good. The waiter was friendly. The hostess was wearing a really short thin romper and whenever she bent over to do something her butt came out. The food was good but I was just confused. It wasn't even a fusion.

Other than that it was just ok."], ["YumYum Y.", "Boyfriend and I were hungry and we were in the area. So we looked this place up. The place is pretty small. It had parking behind the building. Wouldn't be great for large parties or kids. Its pretty quiet when we came. The waitstaff was friendly. My boyfriend and I both ordered sushi. I can't remember what he ordered but I had this veggie sushi that was defried on the outside. It had carrots and i believe edamame. I can't recall what else was in there but it was so good! I haven't had such a unique sushi in forever! I don't know what it is but the outside of the sushi (the fried part) was such an amazing texture! It was so yummy! We both enjoyed our sushi. We both ordered a meal, he ordered a burger. I can't recall the name. But he said it was alright. While I ordered the stir fry mix. veggies with chicken. It was horrible. The chicken was over cooked and the dish came out to look like a soup. There was nothing \"stir-fried\" about it. The veggies had so much variety and it was minced. I was confused. I didn't ordered a soup.. I ordered just a plain stir-fried chicken and veggies. How do you make a soup out of that? The broth defiantly had soy-sauce in it.. but strangely enough there wasn't any seasoning. It was very bland. The only thing I enjoyed about my dish was the tiny rice they gave me.

We lived in Hawaii for a year (yes, hate me now) and ate poke all over the place. This was as good as any I had there. The beer was good - nice selection and happy hour drafts were less expensive.

It comes with a wasabi vinaigrette on top, which is a little sweet (not spicy at all) but it works. It comes rice-less anyway, so no substitutions needed.

It was kind of strange.-I don't quite get the concept. As a lot of the previous reviewers have mentioned, from the name one expects a Mexican-Japanese fusion, but it's not fusion.

I ordered a simple dish of grilled fish, vegetables, rice and beans. The vegetables were reasonably well prepared but were piled like slop next to an ice cream scoop of white rice with some burnt tasting red sauce. The tuna, which I ordered medium rare came out well done and drier than what I have eaten out of a can. To add insult to injury, the dish which was priced at $9.95 came in at $2 more because of some sticker they put on the very bottom of the menu that said tuna was upcharged (no mention by the server). I have never been a fan of the dimly lit restaurant, odd mix of food, lousy preparation and awful floor plan, but this was the final straw.

Unfortunately, their inept hostess and completely unhelpful manager on Sunday night (Sept. 2) alienated me forever before I ever got to sample their faire. We arrived at about 7:30 pm and put our names on the list. We were told we'd have to wait an hour. Well, if you've ever been in Columbia this time of year, you know you don't hang out on the sidewalk waiting to get devoured by the mosquitoes, so we headed down the street to Flying Saucer for a drink. We came back forty minutes later, but the hostess shocked us with \"Oh, sorry. I looked for you, but you weren't here. It'll be another 45 minutes because you're back on the bottom of the list.\" We argued with her a bit, but she just kept whining this unacceptable response. The manager was unfortunately no better, unable to explain to us why they couldn't seat us at an open four-top just 10 feet away. It surely wasn't the kind of Southern hospitality my mama taught ME to show to MY guests.So, here's my two cents worth: If a host or hostess wants to overestimate your wait time so they can then become your hero when they call you early, that's a real gamble. Better to give an honest estimate so they don't screw over their clientele like Takosushi did last night. Or maybe at Takosushi, they're just so inept they don't know how to estimate wait times. Either way, it's time for somebody to get a new job.Thankfully, Motor Supply Company was able to take us, and we ended up having a marvelous dinner with great food, top-notch cocktails, and fantastic service.Too bad Takosushi ruined its reputation for me before I ever tasted something out of their kitchen.

I always get the deluxe mean bean burrito, with hot salsa, and add lots of free toppings. The free toppings you can add are chopped up fresh jalapenos (my favorite 'cause I like the heat), extra hot salsa, chopped onions, lime wedges and cilantro. I think that is really, really cool.Sometimes I also get guac, and let me tell you, their guac is really good! It's got actual 'cado chunks in it, so you know it didn't come out of a big plastic guac bladder or anything like that. They also have free chips and salsa one day a week (Wednesday?), and other really good daily lunch and dinner deals. They have good beer and soft drink options too--pretty sweet!I think you should go eat here because it is so good. The menu is small, but everything on it is the best possible version of itself. The folks who work at El Burrito are also the best! The hire nice, offbeat people who do a really good job with the food and with the customers.

But if you're just craving a burrito and don't want to go the corporate Moe's/Qdoba/Chipotle route, then this is your place. Try the extra spicy salsa. It's not that spicy, but it adds a good flavor to the otherwise unmemorable chips and/or whatever entree you order. The hot salsa that they add to the meal isn't by any definition actually hot---and this is by Midwestern white girl standards, so a pretty low bar to hurdle--so if you want any sort of spice, you have to add the extra-hot."], ["Meg F.", "Really yummy food.

I had the mean bean burrito (black beans with brown rice), deluxe (tomatoes and lettuce), no cheese or sour cream with mild salsa. My husband had the same with spicy salsa. We split guacamole and chips. The burritos were HUGE, fairly priced, fresh and the black beans weren't a soggy mess that soaked through the burrito. (See? It can be done Moe's, Chipotle, Salsarita's, etc.!) The guacamole was great and while the chips were pretty salty, I enjoyed them. While I was eating, I noticed a sign on the menu board saying the rice and beans were never cooked in animal products and everything was fresh, etc. Being vegan, I was THRILLED.

I'd say it's closest in quality to Moe's, because I remember the only time I had Moe's the burrito was dry and the most memorable part was the undercooked beans. Similar deal at El Burrito.El beans were frustratingly undercooked and bland. If they'd had a flavor, I could probably have overlooked their dry, chalky interior. Maybe they salt the water when they soak the beans. Maybe they just don't soak them long enough. Whatever it is, it was unfortunate. The chipotle chicken was also dry and somehow watery at the same time. Overcooked. It was like something made in a crockpot and reheated for lunch the next day. It was the culprit for the water that oozed out constantly. Also, the regular burrito is $5.50. The \"deluxe\" is $7. All the \"deluxe\" option adds is tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream. At first I wasn't sure if that was a joke. But I ordered it anyway and thought they'd forgotten to add the \"deluxe\" additions until I discovered the romaine lettuce quintet in my burrito. Call me cheap, but a dime for each one-inch piece of lettuce is somewhat steep. Oh, and two pieces of a flavorless tomato. Twenty-five cents a pop, same size as lettuce. At this point I'm wondering if these vegetables were blessed by the Pope, hence the price. No sign of the $0.50 sour cream until I spotted a tiny smudge one of the five pieces of lettuce.

Ugh! \u00a0But you have no problem about packing guac over the rim of the container for the people before me. \u00a0How's that portion control?!It couldn't have been because I was overweight. \u00a0I'm not bigger than a green branch from a tree, so I don't know where this BS came from. \u00a0I know every time I go to the Forest Drive Chipotle, I never have a problem with my order so I guess I'll be going there from here on out. Maybe I'll give the one downtown a try. \u00a0I'm going to \"portion control\" my money from this Harbison location."], ["Dixi S.", "I was just thinking about dinner and thought \"Chipotle.\" Then I thought \"no.\" This is the reason why...Service. I was quite a regular at this location until several months ago. \u00a0I believe it was around March of this year. \u00a0I used to get the same thing every time - same salad, same drink. It was really good. One time, there was a long line at the counter. \u00a0When I finally got to order, they didn't have the steak for the salad. \u00a0I had to wait for it. I had to wait after a long line the next two times I was there. \u00a0On the third time, I told the person at the register about it because there were several people ahead of me who also had to step aside because they also wanted steak. \u00a0He basically said that they don't keep a lot of inventory because they don't want the meat to sit too long because it was a sensitive meat. \u00a0A woman who worked there was next to the counter, and she explained the same thing to me. \u00a0She gave me a buy one get one free coupon card. \u00a0So, I got home and opened my food to eat it. \u00a0And guess what? \u00a0There was no steak in my salad. \u00a0Omg! \u00a0I called to let them know. \u00a0I talked to another person. \u00a0I explained to him what happened, and he told me to use my coupon to get my replacement salad. \u00a0Ugh! \u00a0I was pissed I was leaving to go out of town for the week, and when I got back, I got my replacement salad. \u00a0I didn't use my coupon. \u00a0I just wanted what I paid for . They did give it to me free. \u00a0I never used the coupon card. \u00a0I think it expires soon. End of this month. I do like the steak salad that I got there. \u00a0The prices are fairly okay. \u00a0But in my experience there, I spoke to a few people, and they all told me the reason why they run out of meat. \u00a0No one ever acknowledged the other side of why they should NOT run out of meat so they can better serve their customers. \u00a0No one ever said about talking to their management to see if they can improve their process. \u00a0All I got was the reasons why it is the way it is, so I took it as that, and whether I'll take it or leave it. \u00a0I choose leave it."], ["Kam O.", "Good & Good!

Let me start off by saying I've been to several other Chipotle's before and have always been a fan. My visit to this location in particular felt like all that was missing was a parade of dancing dogs...because I felt like I was at a Circus. The staff looked like a bunch of clowns, from the service I received to the way the staff looked. \u00a0One person on the line (poor girl was trying her best) she yelled to the clowns in the back twice for help, they were too busy booty dancing in plain view and adjusting their nose ring to care. \u00a0When they finally decided to help the service was terrible, they simply just lacked common sense or don't give two sh!ts! I won't spare you with all the details that occurred at checkout (it got worse).

I have never had a problem with the waitstaff or the service. The biggest problem I ever have is parking, but that is everywhere in Columbia. Every time I eat here, my mouth is watering for more and I cannot wait to come back to stuff my face full of the chips and salsa, tacos, or taco salad. Their margaritas even rival the ones in Texas. They are so good! (even though I prefer them frozen most of the time) They are worth the price tag. So overall, this is a great place to bring friends and family or if you are just craving some good Mexican food, I highly recommend coming here."], ["Anna B.", "Cantina 76 is always uber busy on weekday evenings. In my experience, though, that usually means that a restaurant serves items that keep people coming back. I get the chicken pesto and chicken teriyaki every. single. time. I know, I know -- I should branch out. But why mess up a perfect combination? The thing I don't like about Cantina 76 is that the salsa and chips aren't included. I know it's a \"step up\" from San Jose's and Monterrey's, but I really, really wish they were included. That being said, if you can splurge and get the queso and/or guacamole, it's totally worth it. In my experience, the original margarita (super cheap at happy hour) is great. The waitresses/waiters/hostesses/hosts are always uber young, and sometimes it seems like they're more interested in looking good or talking to one another than delivering great service. Even so, it's still worth taking a chance on Cantina 76. They always have sports games on the TVs and the bathrooms are (mostly always) clean."], ["Heng T.", "When I want Mexican food in Columbia, this is my go to spot. They also have another restaurant on Main St, just minutes away. This place can get really busy on weekend evenings so be ready but they have a waitlist system that uses texting to alert you so you can go somewhere else while you wait which is great since there are some small shops around the area. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating with tvs all around so it is a great place to come watch sporting events. It has a small parking lot so most of the times you are going to have to find street parking.One of the downsides of this restaurant is that chips and salsa aren't complimentary with your meal unlike most Mexican restaurants. You have to pay 3.49 if you want chips and salsa but we never do that since they have a Tres Hombres option for 9 dollars but is a combination of salsa, queso, and guacamole. All of their dips are fantastic and they will bring you refills for your chips. That trio is definitely enough for a few people to share. As for the regular menu, they have an assortment of entrees such as quesadillas, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, and much more. As for drinks, they have margarita specials throughout the week so be sure to check those out. The tacos are probably their best feature but I enjoy their enchiladas as well since they come with chili sauce surrounding the enchilada. They have a variety of different tacos including fish, shrimp, beef, chicken, and pork and the majority of them are 2.99. I generally get a few tacos combined with the Tres Hombres and that is plenty of food for about 10 dollars. For service, I have had ups and downs. It just depends on your server and how busy the place is. The food itself comes out pretty fast and I have never had an issue waiting long for my food even with a packed house. Nice environment combined with great food so it never fails to disappoint!"], ["Rick T.", "Service here today was terrible at best my friends. Had to leave my table after ten minutes to get water from the bar after ordering with our waitress. Queso dip wasn't hot or even warm.

This place seems good for casual outings with a friend (outside area), the office happy hour (bar area), or a family dinner (restaurant). The prices are reasonable, the service was quick, and the food was great. There is typically a bit of a wait here and, in our experience, the estimated time to be sat was off by a good amount but it's worth the time. Definitely a solid choice for Tex-Mex while in the area!"], ["Sherry C.", "Cantina 76...... Mexican........ Oh the dips and chips were good. I could have just made a meal off those. I got the Queso Dip, Guacamole, and Salsa combo. That was so good!! I was stuffed already just eating the trio. But since I had already ordered other food, I might as well stuff myself. I had the Beef Enchilada and the Vege Refried Beans. It was really good. I had a bite of the Chimichanga and it was also really good.We had a great server.

There's nothing particularly BAD about the food, but nothing that really makes me say WOW. I think the real problem, is that I was expecting Cantina 76 to be kind of like Taco Boy is in Charleston. Taco Boy has a similar concept, but executes on a much higher level. But this isn't a TB review, so I'll keep the focus on C76.I went for my second time last night with a fairly large group. Food came out quickly, which was nice, but none of the flavors were great. I ordered three tacos: BBQ Brisket, Buffalo Chicken, and Roasted Chicken. The roasted chicken was BY FAR the best of the three. The BBQ Brisket was advertised as having a mustard-based sauce, but came out with a red sauce. Kind of confused my flavor anticipation. The service was pretty okay. Like I said, the food seemed to come out pretty quickly, but the actual server was not very attentive. I ordered a beer when we sat down and I was never asked if I wanted a second one. Luckily, I had a water, too so that helped extinguish the mouth fire that the buffalo chicken taco ignited. If I come back here I'll probably just stick to the chips and cheese dip, which are both great. The tacos don't do much for me."], ["Paige F.", "Adorable Mexican restaurant. \u00a0Every time I visit my best friend in Columbia, she takes me here. \u00a0That outside seating area is really nice. \u00a0We came around 8:00 on a Saturday night and it was crowded. \u00a0We waited about 20 minutes and then were seated outside. \u00a0It was so cute out there with lots of string lights. \u00a0The margaritas are really good. \u00a0I had the Devine and the Prickly Pear. \u00a0I recommend both. \u00a0The tacos were delicious and reasonably priced as well. \u00a0I had the buffalo chicken and the fish. \u00a0Both were excellent. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner with friends."], ["Ashley H.", "If you're looking for tapas style Tex-Mex this is the place for you.

We went in on a Wednesday night and our bottle of wine was surprisingly half off, score! The chips and salsa (or in our case, queso) you had to order. This was at a minimal cost so no biggie.

The tres hombres is great for sharing since it has salsa, guac, and queso. I typically get the tacos. My favorites are the chicken pesto, BBQ brisket, and the smoked pork. I've heard the Peruvian shrimp is good too and I would try it if I wouldn't go into anaphylactic shock. I'm not much of a margarita person, but they do have two for one margarita Wednesdays, so I don't mind breaking the rule every now and then. Parking can be a pain since their parking lot is tiny, but parking along the streets isn't too difficult to find.

The menu is simple, food on one side with drinks on the other. The menu is all a la carte and from the taste, its southwest flavors. We had a cheese dips, enchiladas, a fish taco, and chimichanga. The cheese dip and chimichanga were great. I got a bean, chicken, and beef enchiladas with the green sauce and the bean and beef were great. The chicken enchilada suffers from what every chicken enchilada I have had suffers from. The chicken was dry and stringy.. The search for the great chicken enchilada continues. The fish taco was good they just need to go a bit lighter on the amount of jalape\u00f1os they put on top. So a lot to like about this place now for the things that I found a bit off. If you want chips they will cost you extra(not really that bad since gorging on chips isn't a great thing), the table we had was so wobbly it took a little engineering with napkins to level, and even though I like simple menus I feel the menu was too simple or maybe the explanation of exactly what the dish is was a bit lacking. When I say what the dish exactly is, a la carte to me means I order a few things(almost like tapas) like I ordered 3 enchiladas since they are priced per enchilada, the tacos are per taco, which works right up to the chimi in that the thing was huge and came on some rice which made it plenty for a full meal. some niggles but wouldnt keep me from going back"], ["S H.", "This is currently my favorite restaurant in Columbia, hands down.

They gave him a generous portion of meat and the broth was flavorful and steaming hot. The lengua tacos are great too, served on corn tortilla shells with cilantro, lime and onion. My ultimate favorite though is their chillaquilles.

I asked for something the waitress would eat here, she recommended the chipotle grand quesadilla with a green tortilla so I said what the hell give it to me.

Yes it's different than the other local Mexican places in town, because most burritos are served smothered in a red sauce, etc. This was a burrito you pick up with your hands and eat - a real man's meal.Anyway, the food was pretty OK in my opinion. I feel like every time I come here that I must be ordering wrong, because everyone else is so blown away by this place.

Certainly nothing to write home about.I've certainly had worse but at the same time you may as well just go to Taco Bell and save yourself a couple of bucks in a few minutes.

That's why I like this place. The owner is nice too. However, food became mediocre a few years ago, but has been getting better.

They became tasteless, and appeared to be previously frozen. The unlimited chips and salsa still tastes good to me. As I said, it has gotten better since a few years ago. They have remodeled some too. I have to agree with the other reviews though regarding the margaritas being too sweet. They are! They may seem pricey, but the serving size is huge!

The salsa hit on one of my pet peeves as it was very, very mild and hard to distinguish from poor quality marinara. Yea, they're free with your meal, but so what?I ordered 3 tacos asada(steak tacos) with a bowl of hotter salsa on the side. I was speaking to the waiter in Spanish, and he asked me what I wanted on my tacos. I said, 'con todo los cosas tipicas'...he continued to ask me repeatedly if I wanted 'cilantro', 'cebolla', etc. Yes, I know, white people speaking Spanish are suspect, but I swear I know what comes on a taco in most places.After a while my plate finally came out, I guess it was getting towards post-lunch and the kitchen was slowing down. But the meat wasn't very tender, more on the chewy side with bits of fat and gristle in it. The saving graces were the many slices of lime on the side and tomatillo sauce.

The food did come out fast, though with fajitas I would prefer they come out grilled and tasty. The meat looked more boiled then grilled and the onions and peppers taste like stew. Like the cheese dip, both meats were bland in flavor. Overall it wasnt the worst experience in Mexican food we ever had.....but doesnt even rank in the top 100.

I've noticed a trend in \"Mexican food\" here around the Columbia / Sumter / Florence areas... I think its a regional thing because having been to mexico on more than one occasion, the food in southern mexico tends to be different than northern mexico and the food around here feels northern all the way. That Said, Eric's cooks and his menu do a good job with the preperation of the food. If you had to look at the cross section of a mexican restaurant and decide... what makes it good over bad... besides the general cleanliness, menu, dining room concept, service, and staff... and IMO... are the basics of rice and frijoles preperation, sauces, and tortillas... On these points alone, Erics falls just a bit short in Tortillas and Rice, as these items just didnt feel like they were homemade in the least. the Tortillas definately had a out of the bag feel.. and the rice was dry and fairly bland... the beans were ok... but I think they could use some more love from seasoning and depth of flavor.. and less of that canned taste... realizing that hig volume foods make it more difficult to prepare these kind of things.. and keep them cheap.. plus you have to consider where the restauant is located in the grand scheme of things ecomonically... I get some of that to a point.. that it can't always be helped.. but I believe you CAN enhance flavors regardless of what container they come out of.. now, the good points, the rest of the food was seasoned well and came out fast.. temperatures were good and the chips and salsa with Quesso was also not bad. The Service was good and the waiters were always walking around and checking to see the levels of drinks and food was without always asking if you were doing ok... there is a subtle art to doing that well. overall I would reccommend going here for the lunch specials... some of the drink specials and dinner menu... I would just temper that with some of the things I highlighted below... and a bit of a dated dining room concept which I think could use some modernization... this is a good place and I think for the money most everyone with a normal palet for lightly seasoned northern mexican food will be happy."], ["Stacy C.", "The owner was very nice!

We opted to sit down as opposed to stopping for take out, and San Jose seemed like a viable option. The interior is large and the place is definitely family-owned, which is always nice to see. The menu features your typical Mexican fare such as the combination platters as well as Mexican specialties. For dinner I ordered my Mexican go-to...carniatas ($10.50.) The carnitas were prepared differently compared to how I usually see them, as the meat came out still attached to the bone. The meat was a little fatty but overall was very tasty. The rice and beans were both cooked well, which is something I don't always find at Mexican restaurants. The missus ordered the vegetarian combo A ($7.50), which consisted of a bean burrito and a cheese enchilada. The cheese enchilada was stuffed with rich, heavy cheese which ended up not being too appetizing, as it was simply too much. San Jose ended up being nothing spectacular, but was still a decent stop. I don't know if I'd go out of my way to stop back in again, but if we happen to be in the area around dinner time again then maybe I would go back."], ["Oscar B.", "***LUNCH VALUE, BUT NOT FOR DINNER***Here's the blunt of my review: For the quality and flavor of the food, paying for higher-priced plates doesn't make a difference. Go cheap here instead.Lunch Specials are available 11:30--2:30 Mon-Sat, with most specials priced at $5.50 and higher. ESTABLISHMENT: The restaurant looks deceptively more appealing from the outside. As you park and walk up to the building, your expectations are higher than they should be. (I advise that you check your expectations at the door or you'll experience a disappointing reality.)As you walk in, there is a bar immediately to the left and a reception booth directly in front of the entry. The interior cleanliness and maintenance of the furnishings are not on par with the expectation set forth by the grand presentation as you walk in from the outside. For the location of this restaurant, you would think they would at least spiffy up the place in order to attract more local diners and keep their business. The salt shaker was greasy. The floor was dirty. The workers were loud and vulgar (speaking vulgarly in Spanish). If I went to a hole-in-the-wall, I'd expect this type of ambience but in exchange for better food.SERVICE: The server was quick. He refilled my cup when it went empty, took my order and had my food out just 9 minutes later. (It could be due to little business at the time I arrived) FOOD: -Chips and Salsa- The flavor of the chips hit me like cigarette smoke in my mouth. I don't know if this could be due to old chips or 'recycled' chips being used. Once the thought crossed my mind, I left them alone so as to not disgust myself at the table. The salsa (for the chips) tasted as if it was sitting in an open container for days in a fridge full of other food...definitely not a fresh taste. I usually LOVE eating chips and salsa while I my food arrives at Mexican restaurants. This put a damper on my taste buds and my meal already.-Carne Asada- Let's start with the bad; the meat did not have enough (or perhaps any) seasoning. It tasted as if it had been cooked on the iron over remnants of other food, allowing some browning on the steak. But the meat itself did NOT have flavoring as if there was absolutely no preparation of the steak before it hits the heat. The rest of the platter was actually delicious. The avocado, tomato, lettuce preparation seemed fresh. Also, the beans and rice actually had plenty of flavor--surprisingly better tasting than the steak itself.-side of tortillas- I had asked for flour tortillas, but was given corn instead. I decided not to raise the issue. By this time, I just wanted to enjoy what I could from my meal and make the best of it. OVERALL: They have a happy hour and a bar, so perhaps their fort\u00e9 is partying and not food. If you do chose this place, come when you have a lunch crave for Mexican during your work day. But seek out better places if you have the time. It doesn't have to be more expensive for Mexican food to be of higher quality. It just requires a staff that prides themselves in maintaining a high standard for quality Mexican food.

The mole sauce is the best I've ever had. They offer a wide variety of authentic Mexican dishes.

If you like a real Mexican food and not just the stuff that's on the combination menu head to Cecilia's and you'll be pleasantly surprised with steaks, chicken and seafood and many many more options than you're used to at traditional Mexican restaurants. \u00a0Oh and I almost forgot to mention their burritos are almost as big as your head and their chimichangas are as big as your forearms so bring an appetite because you're sure to need it because Cecilia's is going to fill you up."], ["Robert B.", "I don't get the negative reviews here. This is a friendly, relaxed place with good food. My tamale and enchilada, while having too much cheese on it, was delicious. I love tamales and the one I had here was as,good as any I've had. The tortilla chips seem home made, corn based. If you prefer the thin flour based chips in your chain restaurants, too bad. Please give this place a try."], ["Horace G.", "Although Cecilia's sits rather inauspiciously in a non-descript strip mall, the food and the service are anything but ordinary. \u00a0First, the food is delicious and the portions are very generous. \u00a0Free, bottomless baskets of nacho chips are served while you wait. \u00a0The chips are saltier than most that I've had before, and the added salt actually offered a slightly new flavor, which blended well with the fresh, tomato-paste based salsa (tasty but rather spicy salsa verde is also available on request). \u00a0I ordered a Salmon Burrito with Mexican Potatoes on the side. Dish was nicely mixed, with delicious fresh guacamole, tomatoes, and cilantro complementing the burrito's flavors perfectly. \u00a0Melted cheese \"drizzled\" (dumped?) over the top was a little on the heavy side. \u00a0In addition to the great food, \u00a0Senora Cecilia is a most attentive and generous hostess, who shares not only her food but her language and heritage with pride and dignity. \u00a0This makes the experience that much richer. \u00a0She does almost everything in two languages, so that anyone with an interest has the opportunity to build/practice her Spanish as part of the experience. \u00a0I've eaten at many, many Mexican restaurants all over the East coast, and in Nevada, New Mexico, and California, and this was among the very best. \u00a0!Muy bien, Senora!"], ["Shekhar P.", "My family has become a regular at Cecilia's (once every two weeks) and have spotted many regulars in the past two years we have been enjoying authentic and tasty Mexican fare.The welcoming Chips (always fresh and warm) & Salsa (my favorite is the green concoction which is extra hot) are great. Goes very well with a pitcher of perfect Sangria. The menu is fantatstic (even the Combos ROCK!)Pork in Mole is excellent so are the shrimp dishes (wife loves Cozumel). The beans are from scratch and so is everything else. Cecilia's is the only place in Columbia that serves tender and succulent \"Cabrito\". Do not miss the flan - even if you have to pack 1/2 of your dinner in a doggy bag. Cloyingly sweet and heavenly creamy, a perfect ending for a memorable meal.Service is exceptionally good; during my first visit, I was told : No senor, the cabrito is not very tender and cabrito is the costliest dish no the menu; go figure! . Mrs Cecilia takes care of the front and her husband tends the kitchen.Totally unassuming place but with great menu (prices are between $9 & $14) and great service (priceless)."]], "Taqueria Jalisco": [["Elizabeth R.", "Ok, so for five years I had this really tough job over in the Irmo area, which is just not my jam. Nothing against the place, I'm just more of a downtown kinda lady. It was a pretty grueling stretch of time, but ultimately I got a lot out of it, not the least of which being Taqueria mothertrucking Jalisco. (Incidentally, this one odious coworker from that job always used to \"correct\" my pronunciation of the restaurant's name like, \"Actually, it's tok-eee-AIR-uh Jalisco,\" and I got so sick of it, I finally sent him a link to the entry for \"taqueria\" on this website that had audio pronunciations of Spanish words, and he never apologized, but he also never said it again, so that worked out pretty well.)Look, there's nothing fancy about this place, but what it does have is a hell of a lot of magic! They have the best free chips and salsa in town, a huge menu with a million good options and tasty simple cocktails. Their quesadillas fill me with joy--the spinach one and the mushroom one are my favorites. Get some beans with 'em, and then you've got a bean dip to go with your salsa dip to go with your magical quesadilla! ABRACADABRA!More great things about Taqueria Jalisco:- Incredibly friendly folks work there, exclusively, and they work FAST! Your waitperson is going to get your drink order right away when you sit down, and that drink is gonna ride up to your table with some chips and salsa in tow, in about 2 minutes flat. I think there must be a time machine back there in the kitchen because orders fly out of there like nonviolent flavor missiles. This is really important when the place gets jammed up with hungry people come lunch time.- They have a nice mix of tables, booths and bar seating for solo diners and groups of all sizes. They have a great big booth for large parties, and if the party's too large for the jumbo booth, they're gonna add some more tables and chairs to it until everybody fits. - The prices are INCREDIBLE, like to the point that I almost want the place to raise them a bit 'cause I feel like they deserve it. I guess the fast turnover and killer good eats/happy bellies keep them well in the black, but damn, you get some good quality and quantity for your dollar when you eat at Taqueria Jalisco. Like, more than you even deserve.- The ladies room is always clean; no frills, but clean and functional and spacious, so you can transact your turlet business, wash up, and then stand back to check your various parts in the mirror without bumping into anything. It's probably great for ladies with kids too, but I wouldn't know about that. I also can't vouch for the men's room. I'm just not a man, ok? If you're over in the St. Andrews area, and you want a good meal, quickly and for a bargain basement price, you'd be crazy not to hit up the Taqueria Jalisco!"], ["Prashanth R.", "Hands down best authentic Mexican restaurant around, people serving are very friendly, and the food is awesome."], ["Megan H.", "Excellent food and outstanding service.
