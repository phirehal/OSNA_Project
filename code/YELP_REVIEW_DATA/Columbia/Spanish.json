{"Tienda Jasmine Authentic Mexican Restaurant": [["Joshua C.", "It's a Mexican grocery store and restaurant. Hands down the best Mexican food I've had outside of Mexico. If you're feeling a little adventurous and want to try some authentic Mexican, Tienda Jasmine is the spot. Chips and guacamole are handmade. I agree, the pescado frito is superb. I could see why locals would feel apprehensive to go to Tienda, the area in West Columbia is not so good. But it's a must try in the city! Chances are that no gringos will be there. If your Spanish is rusty, might be pointing to the menu but well worth it. Menus are in Spanish but they also have some in English they just came out with. I go here at least once a week. Highly recommend."], ["Tiffanie C.", "I've had awesome authentic Mexican food, and this was not it. Anyone can have a bad day, so I probably will try them again, but this was disappointing. First of all, not everything on the menu is available all the time. I wanted either the chicken or the beef soup but only the seafood soup was available. \u00a0I also wanted carnitas tacos but that wasn't available either, so I got the carne asada tacos.The tacos : I liked the fresh cilantro and onion, but the meat was disappointing. It was full of gristle, dry, tough, and pretty bland. I've definitely had Better, and I WON'T be ordering that again. \u00a0The soup: I know it's most likely a cultural thing, but... I'm American. \u00a0I don't eat my shrimp with the heads or the shells on, so I took on the arduous task of deshelling the shrimp. \u00a0I have to admit that there were at least a \u00a0dozen of them in my bowl. \u00a0A problem besides being completely whole was that they were so overlooked that they fairly disintegrated once out of the shell. \u00a0Also in the bowl was a whole, poorly cleaned blue crab. \u00a0It was so mushy, and the meat in the body had latched onto so much of the spice that it was impossible to taste the sweetness of the blue crab. \u00a0The shells were so soft that trying to get to the meat was nearly impossible, the meat itself incredibly mushy. There were hints of other seafood, I got a small piece of fish, and a small piece of baby octopus tentacle. \u00a0The broth was very flavorful, and maybe a bit too spicy as I felt the heat overwhelmed the potential of the seafood to give you great flavor. I will NOT be ordering the seafood soup again. \u00a0It's just not my thing. \u00a0If you can tolerate the soup the way it's served, it's a great value for the amount of seafood you get. \u00a0Also note, no one speaks English, and they indicated they didn't serve beer even though beer is on the menu. \u00a0Also I'm not certain if chips and salsa is something you have to order or if it's complimentary. \u00a0I was not offered chips and salsa but all the other tables ( with Latinos) got served chips and salsa. \u00a0So ... It just made me wonder if maybe I'd got snubbed."], ["Diana M.", "I couldn't agree less with the previous review. I've been going to Tienda Jasmine now for months- every time I visit Columbia, SC (once or twice a month) I stop by. This is where you go to get real Mexican food in the area. You can tell because the restaurant is always busy with the Mexican locals. The outside and inside is nothing to write home about...but the food is amazing! Best Mexican food I've ever had in the states, and on par with the food I've had in Mexico. Tortilla chips are homemade and so is the guacamole...always so fresh. The pescado frito is my favorite, and portions are very generous. Definitely worth a visit!"], ["J M.", "TRUE Autentic Mexican food! The staff is very pleasant. The food is always fresh to order hot and tasty. Any one that doesn't agree obviously needs to head back to Taco Bell because they don't know what good food is.

A deli inside with marinated fresh meat too!"], ["Shekhar P.", "The one star is for the Horchata (because try you may, it is difficult to screw up a horchata)Now the food:The \"welcome\" chips were dripping with oil. Some of the chips were limp!The tacos were overly greasy and overly seasoned. The \"Al Pastor\" was more like ground seasoned pork, and very very sour. The chorizo had less sausage amd more ground mush.My partner had ordered chicken flautas. once again no flavor, boiled ground chicken wrapped in a tortilla and dipped in warm oil.

I finally decided on the Crab Cake and Fried Green Tomatoes as my appetizer. It was delicious! \u00a0I also ordered a Pizza with Portobello Mushrooms, Pepperoni and Chorizos. It was excellent.

I understand that you have limited space, but after a busted trip to the Food Truck Festival- all I wanted was a good brunch and some good Soda City eats, which is WHY I went to 116!!

I'm not sure I understand this type of business. She only had 8 tables ahead of my party of 2?? Why were we turned away??

Great food and friendly staff make this one of my favorite places to dine in metro Columbia."], ["Somer P.", "Let me start my review by saying this is my 2nd favorite place in the city. No one does hash browns like 116, but there are issues with the running of this establishment that really grind my gears. Let's start with today: arrived at 1:30pm, they close at 3. Was told by the hostess that she already had 8 people on her waiting list and she wasn't taking anymore names for the day. That is just bad business. I'm here an hour and a half before closing and you are telling me you won't take my money? That's confusing to me. Also, I love your brunch and I'm rarely off on Sunday's and when I am, I just want to be able to get my hash browns ok?Most of the male staff here is awesome. We love Ryan and John most of all. All but one of the female staff have attitude problems. I don't know if that's supposed to add to their local charm, but it's obnoxious. I've held off on writing a review for here for a long time, but it was time to interrogate reality and ask myself why I am tolerating rude waitresses, abnormally long wait times, being turned away and even in one case my fianc\u00e9 and her friend were asked to leave while they were drinking coffee because they needed the table. And honestly it always feels that way, like you're being rushed to leave. Sunday funday is not about being rushed, it's about sipping mimosas and relaxing. 116, we've had some good times, but I'm really going to question myself before coming back because I just can't accept the mediocrity and refusal to expand your seating or change venues to accommodate your ever growing customer base. I want to return but I want you to interrogate reality yourself and come to these conclusions on your own. Read the book Fierce Conversations and let me know how that goes. In conclusion, this is still my 2nd favorite place in the city for now, but if you want to visit them arrive at least 30 mins before open on Sunday's and ask for John or sit at the bar. I hope they decide to expand in the coming years or I just don't see how they can continue to get business.I will also add that this was originally going to be a 2 star review but I added a star because other days of the week are not this difficult, I also enjoy their specials for events such as New Years and Valentine's Day."], ["Jill B.", "Amazing food, service and atmosphere. \u00a0I had the hash browns with goat cheese and it was the perfect combo of flavors. \u00a0All the food is fresh and perfectly cooked. \u00a0Highly recommend."], ["Linda O.", "Flawless personal first time experience here on a weeknight. Friendly, informative, and attentive service. While the menu was limited, they did have specials, and each food item was well chosen; unique food combinations and pairings that totally worked! The flavors in the watermelon and feta salad as well as the Brie were perfectly balanced. There was no way to conceal that this was fresh fresh! The small plate sizes fit perfectly into my diet. While the place is narrow and compact like a deep alley, I found it cozy and if you are claustrophobic, they have seating outside. The atmosphere was enchanting. I am making plans to go back again as they do have several lacto-ovo vegetarian offerings as well as waist-friendly options. I topped my wonderful meal off with a delicious coffee cordial which is so rare in this area. Even though this didn't effect my food, I am taking off 1 star because the bartender added chocolate chips to another customer's food item with his bare hands; no immediate hand washing prior."], ["Lea L.", "Simply put, this is one of the best brunch spots in Columbia.I have been here a handful of times for brunch and have enjoyed each visit. Be prepared to wait, we have sat at the bar a majority of our visits and still had to wait 30+ minutes.It is a small hipster-ish place with local art adorning the exposed brick walls. It gets very noisy and is always packed. All the bartenders and patrons around the bar area seems to know each other giving it a neighborhood joint kinda feel.The cocktails are amazing; inexpensive and strong. I did not like the Gazpacho Bloody Mary, it was too thick and tomato-y for me. The Nutty Rusputin was incredible, a must try if you like frangelico/hazelnut/kahlua.The biscuits and chorizo gravy plate makes frequent appearances on the specials menu and is a great twist on the classic dish. Highly recommend if you are biscuits and gravy fan.Most recently, I had a black bean and cheddar baked stuffed poblano pepper with cheddar grits and two sunny side up eggs. I have never had anything quite like it. It was one of those meals you find yourself daydreaming about.It is very well priced (Shrimp & Grits for $7? though I have heard not great things about it) staff is friendly and attentive and menu selection is unique.If you find yourself in the area on Sunday, I highly recommend getting out of bed early for this place!"], ["Allison P.", "My go-to place for Sunday brunch!

Then we had a Cuban pizza with plantains which is good but I like the flank steak pizza here much better . After going through that we had another round Bells two Hearted a great beer from Michigan. And soon after that with had Cuban style shrimp on toasted baguette that paired well with the beers we were drinking.

Almost all of the small plates - baked feta, mussels, and portobello cap were delicious. The only miss was the jam\u00f3n y melon. The ham wasn't quite salty enough and the melon a bit under ripe. The large plates - chimmichurri sampler and pork shank special were excellent. The drinks were inspired and surprisingly cheap at $6-7 a pop. The service was very friendly and paced appropriately.

He had trouble getting past the decor and how LOUD it is. However, he really enjoyed the Caesar salad (dressing is excellent) with anchovies, and the Cuban shrimp. The Cuban shrimp is buttery and garlicky and spicy. I wanted to drink the broth. We wanted to try the Scotch eggs,but they were out. I enjoyed the cheese plate too. The Cuban Pizza was ok, needed more chorizo and less roasted red peppers. Try the Cherry Moch Manhattan, it has Kahlua in it but trust me, it works. Husband had streak and mashed potatoes. I tasted them of course. Loved the wine reduction. Steak was more done than medium rare which was a little disappointing. I want to try the Sunday Brunch but will have to go without him! Oh, if you like Cabernet, try the Gladiator, it was wonderful. Almost forgot dessert. We ordered the lemon bars, Key lime pie and blueberry lemon cheesecake. All were great. The lemon bar was tart and had a great texture, not eggy at all. The raspberry sauce it sat upon was perfect. Tart, and not sicky sweet or gooey."], ["David W.", "Hands down, this is the best food in Columbia and the perfect spot for a date night.

I love the state street crowd. I understand that many do not, but I \"grew up\" sitting at Courtyard (old name, same location) drinking coffee and \"discussing philosophy.\" The things that I do not like about this place is that they food was not memorable. I have heard that their brunch is much better; however I'm not sure that I will give it a chance after the two times that I have eaten dinner here. The wine list was also not memorable considering it is a wine bar.

You will love it!"], ["Brian H.", "116 is not simply a restaurant, it's not just a cozy bistro tucked in a familiar warm happy place at the corner of State and Meeting Streets. It doesn't simply contain a happy group of epicureans who are overjoyed to deliver their wares to both wide-eyed newcomers and longtime friends.And it sure as heck ain't just an Espresso and Wine bar.Generations ago, talented chefs would open their homes to both travelers and neighbors. This being a regular activity for them, they would often either grow their own food or collaborate with a few local farmers who offered the best quality options. With these ingredients, they created culinary masterpieces which complemented their highly-creative beverage offerings.It wasn't done because market research showed that this would lead to higher profit margins. It wasn't because they wanted to win any national awards. It wasn't because they expected the folks from Stouffer's to show up one day and offer to license their recipes.It was because they didn't know any better.Run by a couple of Ryans (Whitaker - chef and owner, Ditman - cocktail crafter and longtime family friend), 116 is not a cause, it is an effect. The cocktails are beyond creative, they are inspired by the tastes of a well-traveled, well-educated functioning alcoholic. Whitaker, who was slated to be an engineer or doctor or some other allegedly \"higher\" pursuit, instead found a path which allowed him to explore his true joy - being complimented daily and fully deserving it (while also being given a constant excuse to eat, drink, and be merry).Odds are, if you step into your average nightclub, approach the bar, and order a \"Chioggia Beet American Harvest Cocktail\", you'll be quickly escorted out by security and asked to never return. However, this is just one of the many custom cocktails designed by folks who have nothing better to do than figure out how to get drunk off of beets.Next time you're ordering the \"seasoned\" grilled chicken at your nearby chain grubbery, be sure to ask if they're using \"North African\" spices, or see if you can get a Chili Coffee rub on your steak. When the server explodes, flinging button-ized messages of \"If God didn't want us to eat bacon, why did he make it out of bacon.\" and \"ask me about our Chicken Chili Flingers\" throughout the room, just tell 'em to cook your steak well done and reconstitute it with your tears as you think of the meal that could have been.\"Oh, well that steak's gotta be expensive!\", you say, and you'd be right... but only if this were 1934. $10 is pretty damned cheap for a specialized culinary masterpiece and you know it.Frankly, I've worked in food and beverage for years, I've seen the margins and food costs and etc. etc. and I have NO idea how they do it. These are no fools, they've got to be making enough to at least get by, but with $3 sangria/wine/draft beer specials during happy hour, $7 shrimp and grits during their Sunday Brunch, and a whopping $5.50 for a pizza (of course, they NAIL you on the toppings - .75/ea for Capicolla Ham, Chorizo Sausage, Portabello Mushrooms, etc), I just don't see how they do it. Every morning after I go there, I double-check my bank account just to make sure the $100+ meal and beverages I've just consumed didn't put me over my limit, only to find that I spent $30.$30 by myself? Well, I've been known to 'enjoy' their drink specials a bit much, and as a beer man, I'll tell you that this \"Espresso and Wine bar\" sells itself short on the name. Sadly \"Beer Bar\" doesn't sound as classy, but their selection is extensive, and far from pedestrian (yet they're cool enough not to give you stinkeye if you order a Bud Light... they may, however, offer for you to taste an alternative).After an appetizer, dinner, a 'few' drinks and a well-deserved generous tip, you'll eventually manage to force yourself out the door only to long for the cozy and warm speakeasy atmosphere, the inspired and devoted servants, the \"this is so much better than a gin & tonic\" libations, and the truly unmatched dining experience. The good news? They're open Tuesday through Sunday and they're always happy to see you come back and assuage yourself of the burden of having to dine anywhere else."], ["Cheryl W.", "Specials are always a great choice...

Take note: the three potato hash browns are not actually made with a quantity of three potatoes, but rather from 3 different kinds (yukon gold, sweet potatoes, and PURPLE potatoes) of spud.

The almond added an extra sweetness to the cheese that made it feel more like a dessert but not so overdone that I couldn't justify eating it as an appHummus-I know, sounds boring. But it was so so fresh and if it wasn't homemade then they definitely fooled me. Only downside is it was a little heavy on the oil for my taste, but others may prefer that. Then we proceeded to order the bruschetta, which was a plate of two medium size slices of toasted baguette covered with a heaping of one of my favorite types of tomato dishes. We finished things off with the salmon, which wasn't particularly seasoned, but was so fresh and cooked just the right amount that I didn't even need the sauce they served with it on the side.

We made reservations which was nice because the place is quite small, a lot smaller than we expected. We were sat in a small room in the back against the wall which gave us some privacy but for a tapas place the table was very small. You would think when needing to accommodate 5-6 plates at one time that they would select larger ones.We started with the bruschetta which was really good. Two large pieces of French bread topped with a lot of tomatoes and a thick balsamic vinegar. We then had the olive plate which I loved, but I never met an olive I didn't like so maybe that's just me. We then had the Moorish pork kabobs with gorgonzola fondue for dipping; warm almond brie with mango chutney; gambas (spicy shrimp with roma tomatoes, sherry, bacon & garlic); and the garlic-parmesan fries with spicy aioli. We also ordered the petite filet mignon but our waitress never brought it out and we were full so we told her to just forget it. Overall our food was delicious and filling. With those 5 plates (olive plate doesn't count) we were SO full. Plenty of food for two. The service was great; our waitress was so nice and knowledgeable and made great recommendations.

My husband and I have been going here regularly for at least 6 years. We LOVE the food and atmosphere, and in all times past, the service. Tonight we went in for dinner, with a reservation, and were taken into the back room to be seated. The hostess asked if the table was okay, and my husband asked if it would be possible for us to sit in the front part of the restaurant. This was met with an undisguised eye roll and sigh that was loud enough for me to ask, \"Is that a problem?\" The hostess responded, in a clearly mocking tone, \"No problem at all.\" She proceeded to seat us only one table away from the hostess stand (which was fine) and then discuss my response to her eye roll and sigh, quite loudly, with the other staff (which was NOT fine). This was all done loudly enough that my husband then asked the server, who was included in the hostess stand conversation, if our seating was a problem. Initially, I took this quite personally, but as we sat and continued with our meal, I saw this process repeated with at least half of the customers that were seated. Eye rolls, loud discussion among the staff nearly mocking the patrons, and general attitude of annoyance from the staff. We have never left the restaurant without ordering at least one bottle of wine, several orders of tapas, and at least two desserts. I was so uncomfortable by the end of our meal that we opted to head to Kaminsky's for after dinner drinks and dessert. (Which, by the way, was FANTASTIC!)

I've recommended it to several friends. Today (10/9/2014) at lunch was the worst experience I had ever had there. I would give it one star if the food I ordered was awful. However, the tasty salmon burger and Parmesan fries are the ONLY things keeping this from being a one star review.I arrived and there was a party of 8, however they were already in the process of having their meal served to them. I placed my order and waited and waited and waited. Did I mention I waited? By this time, other diners had come to the restaurant and were seated and ordered. The place was nowhere near being packed, mind you. As I continued to wait, a 4-top, 3-top, and 2-top (all arriving after me) had already been served. The 8-top that was having food delivered to their table had long since finished eating and had left. The only table besides mine that hadn't been served their lunch was a 3-top that arrived much later than me. I think my server was avoiding me since he rarely came to check on me or when he did, would assure me that my salmon burger was on the way. At this rate, I'm thinking that my salmon is still on a boat off the coast of Alaska. So the food finally appears AFTER ONE HOUR. And the salmon burger is piping hot, so it was comforting to know that it had just been cooked and hadn't been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes, however, this means that somehow my order was the next to the last put in with the kitchen. I normally take photos of my food so I can post them to yelp, but given the serious rumbling in my stomach, the primal urge to feed took over. My server was completely oblivious to the fact that I had been clearly waiting and inexcusably long time.

I have eaten here half a dozen times over the past couple of years and I have never ordered anything that was great. The menu is very large, but my favorite items are: Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops, Petite Filet Mignon, Warm Almond Brie, Beef Paillardes, and Spanish Asparagus. MMMM....my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it! They also boast a large wine menu, which pairs nicely with my love of wine! If you visit Gervais & Vine during the weekend you'll dine to live music. The atmosphere is quaint, trendy, yet fancy. I will tell you that the prices are a bit on the high end, so we usually reserve eating here for special occasions and celebrations. Have something to celebrate, but don't know where to go? Look no further than Gervais & Vine!!"], ["S H.", "Gervais & Vine did a GREAT job welcoming our large group last night. They prepared a special vegan menu, set out a small spread free of charge and the chef seemed authentically happy to have us. (I did feel badly for the server who handled several odd, borderline rude questions from a lady at my table though.) I ordered the artichoke paella and was very pleased with it. It was simple but well seasoned, reminding me of Mexican-style rice. I also made sure to sample the fresh-made hummus and cornichons. (Love those!) The hummus had a nice, subtle mustard flavor. Thanks again to G&V for accommodating all of us and doing it so well!"], ["Stephanie S.", "Enjoyed a night out with the girls here. The wine selection is top notch and so it the food! We ordered 6 different items and tried them all. The garlic Parmesan fries and Brussel sprouts were yummy! Definitely check it out!"], ["Leah M.", "Excellent wine list with lots of Spanish options. We always start with a spread tray and the Costa Brava never disappoints. Keep in mind tapas are smaller portions, so be prepared to order a couple of rounds. Fingerling potatoes are a personal favorite, and actually come with enough to split. Go on a wine tasting night to chat up the expert. The price is good, and atmosphere cozy."], ["Adam B. J.", "Gervais and Vine was great when it was the only place in town that did tapas (small plates), but as owners, chefs, and managers changed it's hard not to ignore so did the quality. \u00a0I fully understand the idea of tapas, but some of the dishes here are just two small for the price. \u00a0I realize that you go here for an experience and you order several small plates etc, etc,etc. \u00a0My last four dining experiences would have me ranking this lower, but the history of the place makes me say A-OK, as I'm sure I will be back again.

One of the best scallops we ever tried. Downside was the pizza, we had better, and it didn't tasted that great honestly. \u00a0It was the last thing to finished andOur waitress was friendly and even when the first pitch of sangria tasted watered down, \u00a0she fixed it and it tasted somewhat better.

I am hoping that our next visit here will improve our regards for the restaurant, but it will be some time before that happens. There was not anything that overly impressed us, service was slower than expected and the wine did not color my memories of Gervais & Vine in a positive light. The best summation is to describe the pizza we ordered as one of our dishes. The Greek Pizza we ordered was not well cooked and in some ways could be considered soft. The dough just was not cooked well enough to serve as a base for the ingredients nor were the ingredients tasty enough to serve as the toppings alone. With tapas food, each ingredient, each dish, must boldly carry itself with spices and flavors. The flavors here fell flat about halfway through the palate and only satiated our hunger, not our desire."], ["David A.", "Loved this place. My new favorite in Columbia. Went with my daughter and her friend. We ordered a bunch of different dishes/tapas to share. All different cuisines and everything was excellent.Highlights:The flatbread with pesto was very good. The crust has a unique texture and it works!The mussels with chorizo were great. Nice sized portion as well.The hummus seemed to be blended with edamame. Not sure, but it was delicious.Had to get something not so healthy. Been trying hard to stick to my plan. When you cheat it needs to be worth it. The eggplant fries were worth every bite!Scallops were recommended by our waitress. I am not always a fan. These can be fishy. These were awesome. Melt in your mouth.The chocolate cake for dessert was devoured as well.Service, by Roxie, was very good. My only suggestion would be to space out the dishes more.

There's a very nice man who I assume to be the manager, who serves as the hostess/bus boy/waiter - basically everything. He clearly needs some reliable help. The last time I was there was for a friend's birthday, we had a table of 7. When we finished our food, we waited so long for the check that a friend had to get up and go find our waitress. To give you an idea, we sat down at 8, and we didn't leave until 10:30p.m. And we all only had 1 or 2 drinks - it wasn't a crazy party by any means. The food is ok - nothing special, at all. The cheese plate is something you could easily create yourself from Publix. I had the scallops last time and they were horrible. They were served cold and I felt like they had been sitting awhile.

The filet tasted as though it was thrown on the grill haphazardly after being cut. It was dry and boring. The brussels were overcooked and the goat cheese was an unnecessary addition. The bacon worked though. Notwithstanding slow service and a bit of disappointment with some of the dishes the wine selection was quite interesting. Hopefully this was a one-off that won't occur again. Our advice: do dinner on a weeknight for a better experience! \u00a0 Stay away from the filet!"], ["Damon S.", "LOVE this restaurant!

About 10 years ago, my job had me traveling in this area a few months out of the year. I got to know the restaurants in Columbia very well! Gervais & Vine was one of my favorites! For the uninitiated, tapas consists of small portions of different dishes meant to share, like appetizers, but the whole meal is that way! Today was a blast from the past of sorts! I started with an Ensalada Verde, basically mixed greens w/ balsamic vinaigrette. Next I tried Grilled Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Feta and a White Balsamic Reduction. This was a stretch for me because I've never had Brussels Sprouts before. I have to say, personally, that the addition of the other ingredients didn't make it particularly palatable. I only managed to eat two of the ten sprouts! Luckily, the waiter was able to remove it, even though I was perfectly ok with it remaining on the ticket. I had to add Garlic Parmesan fries mainly to get the taste of Brussels Sprouts out of my mouth and rounded out the dinner with Herb Grilled Lamb Chops! Perfection!

My first experience at Gervais & Vine consisted of many different plates of overpriced, undersized, and mediocre (at best) food that was shared between a group of six friends. We came for \"jazz night\", which was listed at two different times on the menu and website, but that wasn't an issue since there was no jazz anyway. Our waiter told us that sometimes they play jazz over the sound system, but that there hadn't actually been a live jazz band in a long time. When asked how their sangria was (it is watery, flavorless, no fruit), our waiter told us it would \"get us drunk\", and while we were all pretty taken back by this unprofessional remark at the time, in hindsight- I wish it did. Perhaps then we would have been intoxicated enough to not care about the rubbery, insipid cheese plate and cold empanadas. Our group of friends had multiple Living Social deals between us, so we all fought over who could use their's on the check (only 1 per table), because nobody wanted to go back. Unfortunately, I did not win that battle, so a couple of weeks later my girlfriend and I went back to burn the Living Social deal on some wine and dessert because how bad can that be, right? Bad. It can be real bad. After a brief glance at the uninspiring, grossly overpriced wine menu, we decided on ordering a couple of glasses of port to go along with dessert. Being a fan of both the Sandeman Ruby and Sandeman Tawney ports (which they had listed on their menu), I asked our waitress how the Sandeman Reserve compared to the two. Laughing, the waitress told us that she has no idea, because \"usually, people don't ask about the dessert wines so we sort of just pour them whatever\". She said that she wasn't even sure if they actually had those wines in stock. Nevertheless, she went in the back to see if she could find out any more information on it, and came back with a sample for me to try. She said they did not have the Ruby nor the Tawney in stock, and the wine I was about to taste wasn't actually a Sandeman Reserve, it was \"something else that they just say is Sandeman\". After I asked what wine it was then, she went in the back to fetch the bottle, came back with it, placed it down on the table, and said, \"this one.\" For dessert, we ended up ordering the almond joy bread pudding, which was miserable as well.

The appetizers were good with the hot sauces she had on hand. After scarfing down the apps we moved on to the roasted pork mofongo. Picture a bread bowl w roasted pork, but instead of bread it's plantains. It was really filling and it took both of us to finish it. This is a no frills small mom and pop place that is what it is.

Yes, the parking is crazy and crowded; exactly like in Puerto Rico. Yes, the dining room is small; exactly like in many places in Puerto Rico. This is not a watered-down-for-mainland-American customers version of cooking. It is comida criolla cooked by Puerto Ricans for Puerto Ricans the way you would find at abuela's house, if you are lucky enough to be invited. The rice and beans brought back great memories. The mofongo was something you can't find done right most places. Classic salsa music playing on the stereo. The clack and rattle of the domino playing near the cash register was like I heard so many weekends in Puerto Rico. Icing on the cake, as far as I was concerned.

We sampled three appetizers. All were deep fried, which isn't a problem, but it seemed like the plantain ball was over cooked and the empanada did not appear to have been made on site. It looked and tasted like a frozen, mass-produced product. What a disappointment!We ordered the Mofongo with garlic-saut\u00e9ed shrimp and the rice with roasted pork. The shrimp were frozen salad shrimp and although the sauce was okay, I couldn't get past the disappointment of those salad shrimp. I expect that kind of thing from a big line buffet, but not a specialty ethnic restaurant. The plantain basket had little flavor. I added a good bit of salt.The rice with roasted pork was more disappointing. The pork looked like it had been cooked at least one, maybe two days earlier. It was dry around the edges. You could tell that there was potential for goodness, because the sauce had a good taste, but frankly, it was like getting leftovers. It wasn't fresh. The rice was okay, but seemed old, too. It broke too easily, like it had been cooked and held and then over steamed. The fried plantain that came with the plate needed seasoning. It was bland. The salad dressing they brought to the table added some flavor to the plantain.I'd never eaten Puerto Rican food, so I asked my friend if he thought it was supposed to be bland. He has been to Puerto Rico and said that he'd expected it to be much more seasoned. It was as if there were no spices or seasonings added to the food. It was bland and boring. I was disappointed.The place is small with cheap tables and chairs and plastic tablecloths. That's okay. I sort of expected that kind of thing. Everything was served on styrofoam plates. The bottled water ($1) was brought out with a small paper cup. On the plus side, it seemed clean and neat and I had no stomach upset after eating there, so they are probably taking care of the kitchen cleanliness and food handling. It seemed like everyone who was there knew each other, possibly family? Which is great. Love to see that kind of support, but I do not believe the quality of the food will bring non-family members back for a second time. Once was enough for me. I was hopeful that this would a great, local flavor type place where I could take friends for an unusual dining experience. But I won't return and definitely would not take another friend there.

The salsas were also fresh and exceptionally balanced between sweet and spicy.We ordered several martinis around the table.

All of them were expertly mixed and very good.For the main course I had the Shrimp and Grits and the other three had the Chimichurri Steak. My entree was superb. It was rich and creamy with a bit of spicy flavor from the andouille sausage and chorizo.

We ordered some drinks and some guacamole. I guess the owner thought we waited long for my wine so he gave us a free order of salsa for the wait; it was really nice and showed that he went out of his way to please us! The salsa was good and the guac was ok, I think it was little on the limey side for our liking. \u00a0My husband ordered the Pollo Loco (chicken tacos) that he said were excellent. They came with wonton strips and he really liked the lime aioli! I ordered the Camarones Gordos, which was a shrimp and chorizo salad. This might be one of the best salads I have ever had. The serrano-lime vinaigrette was SO GOOD. From the first bite to the last I loved it. Instead of croutons my salad came with wonton strips which I thought was different but fit so well, it also came with bacon. I think I probably had 5-6 strips of the crispiest most delicious tasting bacon. Overall it was a fantastic meal. We really enjoyed the atmosphere; the string lights and music are a perfect setting.

The Brie and blueberry filling was okay, but it only had evidence of blueberries (not mixed as stated). The taste of the Brie didn't stand out either. The outside of the thick french toast was oily (not buttery which would be more becoming of french toast). I ended up only eating the filling because of this. If they would have coated the grill with butter for this entree, used a variety of berries per menu description (or maybe say seasonal - not mixed - berries?), had sugar free syrup or offered a fresh fruit puree, and gave me utensils for my to-go order, this entree COULD have been good.I did have friendly service, liked the uniqueness of a Brie stuffing, and I admired the trendy interior.

I tried the Ginger Bliss first, which was refreshing. But the real prize of the night was one of their signature drinks - Some kind of Martini made with Alvacado. I know what your thinking...Alvacado? But its blended with orange and mango and its so smooth you could easily get in trouble drinking them.We will be back for dinner and as fast as we can get there. We were also told they serve brunch on Sunday's but its best to make reservations."], ["Elisha B.", "Great food (both dinner and brunch), great drinks, and great service.There's not many places in Lexington that have interesting menu selections like Arkos, but what really sets this place apart is the service; especially from the owner, who always makes it a point to talk to everyone. \u00a0It's really the best customer service I've seen anywhere. \u00a0The martinis are also equivalent to martinis to martinis you'd find at 4 and 4 star restaurants, like Oak Table (but without the 4 or 5 star prices). \u00a0My favorites there are any of the fusion tacos, the avocadotini, the plantains, and anything on the brunch menu."], ["Lisa S.", "Unacceptably slow service. Shrimp appetizer was burnt. We were seated in the back next to a closed door, which I assumed was not in use during busy times because it was literally 6 inches from my chair, but it was used by all the waitstaff with outside tables, so I was constantly grazed by servers running in an out. A manager of sorts did apologize about the slowness, but only after the server had said \"it'll be right out\" several times. When the food finally came out, half of it was cold. Again they apologized, and we did get a discount, but I was totally turned off by this point. I had lukewarm fish tacos, which were meh."], ["Merry D.", "Very happily surprised to find this gem in Lexington! Great cocktails, try the Avocadotini. Don't worry, you can't taste the avocado, but it gives it nice texture. We tried the jerk quesadilla, spices were very good. Ahi tuna tacos were very good, but the wonton \"taco\" shells were a little odd. The Cuban sandwich is VERY good. Great bread, yummy ham. The mofongo was yummy but I felt it needed either more or larger shrimp and some rice to help cut the richness of the sauce and plantains. Caipirinha(Brazilian cocktails) were excellent. The space is small, \u00a0little dark, odd layout. Not enough seating. But the staff was great. We will definitely be back."], ["Jim M.", "This has become our regular hangout. The staff is super friendly and the food and drinks are excellent."], ["Courtney G.", "Great drinks but unless you like seafood or really spicy food, you're out of luck for dinner. I'd go there for a drink but wouldn't stay for the food. If the menu was a little more diverse I'd stick around. The drinks are still good though!"], ["Paul M.", "Lexington has been suffering a lack of restaurants that actually serve good food outside of the usual SC comfort food crap. \u00a0They have a nice menu influenced by Spanish and Latin cuisines without being generic Mexican food. Think ceviche, interesting guacamole, gourmet tacos, and other tapas-like food. The atmosphere is nice too. You can eat on the patio if the weather is habitable. It's one of the few places in Lexington that you can grab a drink and not feel out of place for forgetting to wear your Guy Harvey t-shirt."], ["Jeffrey H.", "We went to Arko,s for the second time last night. For the second time service was polite but painfully slow. The food arrived to the table Luke warm. I had ordered the chimichurri beef with crema corn. The steak was overdone with no evidence of a rich fresh chimichurri as expected. The corn was obviously frozen corn in an area with some of the finest in season corn around. It was a disappointment for me and my date,"]], "Pepe At Soda City": [["Rebecca A.", "I love Pepe! The people who run it are very friendly and will answer any questions you have. My favorite is the sirloin pastelito, which has a slightly sweet filling. It is SO GOOD. I will come every Saturday that I can for sure. Stop by while you're at Soda City, you won't regret it!"]]}
