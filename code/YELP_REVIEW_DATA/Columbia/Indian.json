I mean, it might be a little weird eat alone but I wanted to. The buffet is pretty decent, and had a variety of dishes that are not regular standards on most Indian restaurant buffets, which I appreciated.

I was greeted and seated immediately. Service was attentive the entire time. I had no idea what to expect when I ordered the rava dosa but was pleasantly surprised it was nothing like I envisioned. It does have some heat to it but the accompaniments helped mellow it out. The flavors worked together beautifully in this unique dish. They presented several vegan options and offered to prepare items without butter if needed. So they were very accommodating.Everything looked clean and I liked the linen napkins. The only two suggestions I have for improvement is that I would've liked to have seen glassware (instead of plastic) and the booth cushion had a tear in it. Regardless, I would like to go again and try some other things."], ["Katy L.", "I went to 2 Gingers for the first time the other night on the recommendation of a friend who lives down the street.

We are excited to go back and try more dishes!Only had a couple of minor complaints: the service is a little slow, our finished plates sat in front of us for about 15 mins before they were cleared, our check wasn't brought until about 10 more minutes later. We also had to flag a waiter down to bring us more water, and even so, he only brought enough for one person so we had to split it. This would not have irritated me as much of the food hadn't been so spicy! Everyone at our table ordered \"mild\" and we were all sweating. Idk if they just have the spice ratings for funsies or what but it was hot, and we all eat spicy food quite often. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but if you're wimpy about spice be careful!Overall, I would recommend it. Delicious food for a reasonable price, friendly (albeit slow) service, and good size portions."], ["Ellen A.", "2 Gingers had a rough transition from Bombay and it took a few months to get the kinks worked out, but judging by our latest meal, they are spot on again.

Started with their tasty samosas that had a bit of heat to them. Then we had saag with potatoes (also tasty) and their 2 Gingers Special Kofka (tomato based creamy sauce was yummy).

This place used to be called Bombay but recently changed their name to 2 Ginger. Other than minor decor changes, the place looks the same. Their buffet is until 2:30 pm and a great way to sample various dishes. We were disappointed with their selection. There was only three chicken dishes and the rest were vegetable. I was hoping for lamb, goat or something different. After talking to the waitress, Wednesday and Saturday have different meat options. There was only one desert option, rice pudding, and the rice was undercooked and slightly hard. They were confused about honoring the 10% deal from Yelp. Overall the food was ok at best. I'll stick with Delhi Palace for now."], ["Daniel G.", "If this does not say enough...... I ate here for lunch and the buffet was spectacular and so resonable priced.

Showed up at that time and they hadn't even started making my order. I was told there was some kind of \"miscommunication\" and told to sit down with no apologies. I sat there in front of the host, waiter, and manager for 35 minutes with no info, long enough to see a dissatisfied couple pay and give the waiter a stern lecture about why they would never come back. When my food finally came out I reiterated my situation to the manager and he looked at me disgusted and gave me $3 off a $40 order. I would have just left the food and refused to pay, but I was pretty starving by then. By the way they are treating people I think they might be trying to close.

I'm not quite sure what authentic Indian food is like, but either way I think that most people would like this place. None of the food is particularly unusual and I'd have any of it.

I said I had never been there before and so the guy told me how it worked. You get a bowl or a plate. The plate has two meats and two sauces while the bowl has one. I picked a bowl. He asked where I normally go for Indian food and I told him. Then he started to explain all the food items which considering I just told him two other restaurants I go to for Indian food I don't think that was really necessary. I told him I don't like spicy food and asked him for the least spicy options. He also suggested I mix two different kinds if rice and mix two sauces. I said ok on the rice and no on the sauce. \u00a0I got a samosa. The bowl does not come with naan which was disappointing. \u00a0My food was so spicy I couldn't even finish it. He asked for feedback as we were leaving and I told him i thought it was too spicy and that I didn't even finish my meal he made some kind of noise and shook his head. I felt like he was being very dismissive. The cauliflower was the only thing that had any flavor and not just heat. The quality of the food, service and the development of flavors was far below what I have experienced at other Indian restaurants. Parking is also difficult."], ["W T.", "This place is an innovative idea, but the food is just ok.

They're really just thin sauces - the korma is spicier than I'm used to rather than creamy and rather sweet, but the makhni is perfectly spiced and delicious. I also ordered a samosa and raita, and while the samosa was pretty well-spiced, the raita was not good to me and definitely nothing to write home about. I should note, however, that the channa masala was delicious.

My samosa had entire leaves of herbs and spices hanging out of it in the midst of the vegetable pur\u00e9e that also filled it. The taste was overwhelming and I couldn't eat it.

It's a winning combination for lunch especially because you can get a whole lot of great Indian food for under $10.My only ding is that their food is not spicy and there are no options for upping the spiciness.

And for a while (when I dated an Indian guy), I even cooked my own Indian food. As a result, I am a bit of an Indian food snob.My friend was passing through town and we decided to get together for dinner. I found out that she had never tried Indian food before (which is crazy) so I combed Yelp for Indian restaurants. I had only been to one other Indian restaurant in Columbia- which was a huge letdown and have never ventured out for Indian food in Cola again. (It was that bad.)BUFFET: 2 stars. We came on a Friday night and had the buffet. There are several options on the buffet. I tried to get a little bit of everything. My favorite was the dahl. [If a restaurant doesn't get dahl right, then you know the place is doomed.] Other items that were good but nothing special were the tandoori chicken and the chicken masala. Some items I really didn't like. The saag paneer was not tasty and there weren't even any cubes of paneer. I love paneer, so I was disappointed. \u00a0The whole wheat naan didn't taste very fresh.For dessert, there were three options: mango pudding, rice pudding, and carrot halwa. I love halwa, so I got that. It was a little different, but pretty good. My friend got the rice pudding (which looked like ranch dressing). She didn't like it. There was no gulab jamon for dessert and that's my favorite. I thought it was standard on Indian buffets? Guess not here.SERVICE: 4 stars. The service was great. We were seated right away. The servers weren't particulary friendly, but they were always clearing our plates and refilling our water glasses. Plus, my friend and I got to talking and were there for probably two hours. Nobody rushed us to leave[, but they didn't really come back to the table either]. Ambiance is pretty nice for a casual restaurant. You can check out the Yelp pics to get an idea.Buffets are always tricky when it comes to food quality. I was disappointed with this one. Maybe ordering from the menu is better?"], ["Tiffanie C.", "The buffet has a nice assortment of items both vegetarian and with meat. \u00a0They told me the heat scale is 1-5 and that the buffet was a 3. \u00a0I found the buffet to be a bit mild, but then I like spicy food. Don't let yourself get distracted by the buffet though. I ordered the LAMB Biryani and asked for it be a 4 on the spicy scale and it was AWESOME! A healthy portion I ate on for 2 days. The only thing I would say is that they ran out of Naan on the buffet and it took them a while to replenish it."], ["James G.", "Loved our time at the Delhi Palace.

The food is decent quality, but one would expect better for the price. I have eaten at many Indian restaurants that are much better and at the same price-point. My wife did not enjoy her food as it was too spicy; yes we enquires about its spiciness beforehand and were given a snooty answer about how it wouldn't be a \"true Korma \" if it were to be made more mild... It was an answer which amounted to telling the customer they were wrong, without giving a positive solution to remedy her desire for something more mild.There wasn't really much meat at all in the see of red green yellow sauces, and once again, I've had way better at other places.The place was empty when we went there at dinner time.The people that work there ended up being nice enough, but we just weren't pleased with the food.

I opted for the hot which has a nice red silky hot flavor and the brown which is mild that has a totally different flavor I cannot place. Two types of rice are served with the chicken curry dish for 6.99 and that comes with naan bread. The bread was warm and buttery perfect for dipping into the curry and rice. I tried to buy two more smaller pieces of naan but the owner said it was no charge as I asked nicely.

Apparently though, they used to have it but decided on regular lunch plates. My hubby and i ordered:chicken tandori (not white meat!) which makes it a thumbs up in my book. I HEART DARK MEAT. whenever it's white meat it's just too dry. So when this came out I welcomed it without having to drink any extra water or soda just to get it down. combo curry dish (lamb and your choice (spinach curry)... good but small. i mean, i can't complain about the taste. i just wish it was a little more bang for your buck. Remember though, this is coming from a person (piggy) who is used to all you can eat indian buffets)Overall, i liked the food and not the amount or price for the portions. I also didn't like that there wasn't refills on drinks and that the location was kind of in the middle of no where. The good thing about being in the middle of no where... you get a ton of parking options.

Perhaps 3 stars on a good day, then.But now the place is no longer a buffet, but a cafeteria that serves sub-par fare on Styrofoam plates under harsh fluorescent lighting. \u00a0You get a bunch of (cheap) starches and pathetically small cups of curry-slop reheated, which you get to spoon out of your kiddie cup with the cheapest plastic utensils imaginable. \u00a0For the questionable pleasure of this you are charged $9 - $12. \u00a0The food is edible, but completely unjustifiable. \u00a0I'm sorry, but I cannot in good conscience recommend going here. \u00a0For that price you can toodle on down to Trader Joe's and buy a handful of their frozen Indian dinners and sides, which, frankly, are superior IN EVERY WAY to what you'll find at Spice Junction.For an example of what $12 can get you in another town, try the Sunday lunch buffet at the sublime Mela in Asheville. \u00a0Fresh, made in house dishes and chutneys with lots of vegetarian options for the same price simply puts wretched places like Spice Junction to shame eternal. \u00a0Save your money, kids."], ["Rae H.", "I have been a fan of Spice Junction for years now, and it's absolutely my favorite Indian restaurant in town.It's a little hidden gem, and while in West Columbia, is still convenient to most places because it's so near I-26. \u00a0It's always clean and airy, and the food is always hot, fresh, and flavorful.I went there last night and was surprised that it's no longer a buffet, so I felt it appropriate to write a review to tell y'all alllllll about it:The menu options are basically the same classics that I know and love, but now it's actually even more affordable. \u00a0I got the chicken and vegetable Thali--it came with a chicken curry of my choice (butter chicken YES), two vegetable curries (spinach, mushroom, and corn in a creamy sauce, and daal), semolina pudding, bread (paratha), vegetable appetizers, and it was more than I could eat. \u00a0I think I got more ordering the Thali dinner than I would had I gotten it off a buffet, and now you can take your extras with you.Everything is still delicious, it has an amazing selection of classics and that semolina pudding is worth going there for alone. \u00a0It's so much saffron, so much cardamom, so much amazing in my mouth. \u00a0They seriously make the best naan in town.I often take \"novice\" Indian food eaters here because the family that owns it is so wonderful at describing everything and while it has the complicated spice and taste profiles I love in Indian food, it's \"accessible\" to people who aren't adventurous eaters, too. \u00a0As is common with Indian cuisine, this place is great for vegetarians. \u00a0Not so sure about how well they accomodate other dietary needs, but as helpful as they are, I'm sure a quick call ahead might make some things workable."], ["Lissa J.", "Finally had a chance to try Spice Junction recently and was delighted. As soon as you walk in the door you are enveloped in the delicious curry-based aromas of Indian cooking. BTW what is it with those people who say they can't stand the smell of curry? I think it's one of the tastiest, most mouth-watering aromas in the cooking world. Must be one of those genetic things like licorice (yuck) and cilantro (yum!). Anyway - since I am a new customer, the buffet idea was long before my time, so I can't say one way or another if its passing is to be mourned or celebrated.This is a family-owned business, so the staff who greets you actually owns and runs the place. They are wonderfully friendly and very helpful with newbies like myself. They suggested one of the sampler platters aka 'thalis', so I got to try different types of curry and rice together. Disclaimer: if I have gotten any of the names of the foods wrong, that's on me. The menu is very complex and I am very new to Indian cuisine.First let me say something about the rice. I am not a very good cook, and I don't eat a lot of carbs, so rice is not exactly in my culinary wheelhouse. After eating the rice at Spice Junction, I don't know why I would ever want to cook rice at home again. The thalis come with biryani rice and cumin rice. I'm not sure which is which. One is the simpler version, with just some herbs and very light seasoning. The other has more seasonings and is more colorful with hints of yellow and orange. \u00a0Both are outstanding. The way they prepare their rice, it is light and fluffy, not at all sticky. I had the impression that if I wanted to sin with some carbs, if I did it with this rice, it would hardly be sinning at all.On to the stars of the show: the curry. I had the chicken tikka masala; the butter chicken (I think?); the vegetable; and the spinach/corn. All of the curries have a heat rating, mild medium and hot. The chicken tikka masala was medium and was pretty hot IMO. I am looking forward to trying one of the hot varieties as I love spicy food. I think the others were rated mild.When trying to describe curry to an SC friend, I told her it was similar to the SC dish called hash that is served over rice. The curry is in a thick gravy-type base with meats, vegetables and spices depending on which one you order. \u00a0The base may come in different colors depending on what you order; for example the chicken tikka masala was a deep orange-red; the butter chicken was more of a golden orange, and the vegetable curries were even lighter and more neutral in color. The two meat curries had generous chunks of meat. The vegetable curry was similar to a very thick veggie stew. The spinach curry was not quite as thick as the others but was very tasty. I never thought of pairing spinach with corn but the corn really sweetened it up. All of these are very good on their own without the rice if you are watching your carbs.Speaking of carbs, the naan was also very good. You know those Mexican restaurants that offer fresh-made tortillas on premises? Naan is very similar, a little lighter, maybe more of a pita or lavash flavor. They also garnished the thali platter with a little chip-like thing. I am not sure what it was. Think lighter, fresher, tortilla chip seasoned with some type of herb, maybe? IDK but it was great.I was too stuffed to enjoy much of the mango dessert but it was good also. Now that I have had a delicious introduction to Indian cuisine, I am looking forward to going back and having a run at their complex menu and ordering something else. Def want to try something they consider 'hot'."], ["Anita M.", "Excellent, fresh homemade food. We ordered off the menu and were not disappointed. This place is a hidden gem. The owners are warm and friendly. I was pleased to see items that I had not seen on an Indian menu before. We ordered a spread of 6 dishes and appetizers and each tasted everything. The food makes you feel happy, like it was made with love. Don't let the strip mall exterior fool you; you need to try this place. As an added bonus, their food safety rating is 100%. How many places can say that? :)"], ["Heather J.", "Spice Junction has been my favorite Indian restaurant in town since it opened. They used to have a buffet, but now they are a menu-only establishment. At first, this upset me, because I am way more experiential with my food choices when I know I can try a bite of this and that, and not have to commit to something that I may not like. However, I discovered that in addition to some delicious-sounding menu items, they also have meal platters (Thalis). This was the best option for me! You could pick how many different curries you wanted, and of what variety (veggie, chicken, lamb, etc.). In addition to the curries, the meal platter came with two different kinds of rice, an appetizer of your choice, papaddam (fried lentil cracker), 1/2 a piece of paratha (griddle bread), and a dessert! You also could pick two different chutneys to go with your meal. When the tray full of my hand-selected goodies was given to me, I was astounded by the amount of food...there is a LOT of food!! In this respect, the menu-style is better than the buffet because with buffets, you're not allowed to take home left overs. I don't know about you, but I can only fit so much food in my tummy at one time...regardless of how DELICIOUS it is! I was able to get another whole meal just from my left overs! And, to add the icing to the cake, all of this food only set me back 11 bucks!There are plenty of other items on the menu (to include an entire page dedicated to vegetarian choices), and I will definitely be back to explore them, but in my opinion, you really can't go wrong with the Thalis. And don't let the price of this one particular meal fool you. What I ordered was the 2nd most expensive item on the menu (2nd only to the lamb meal platter). Everything else on the menu is easily under 10 bucks. Go forth and eat my friends! You won't regret it!"], ["TheGlamMadame K.", "My husband and I were devout customers of the restaurant which serves delicious food. \u00a0However, with the changes to the business model where this is no longer a buffet, and with the limited choice of plates served to you by the owners that they plate for you from the buffet... was too much change for us. \u00a0The whole dining experience is non-existent.

I would recommend eating at the restaurant instead of getting it to go so you can really take advantage of the buffet and get a better sample of their many great offerings."], ["Martina G.", "I rarely rush home to write a review but I just want to shout from the rooftops about how wonderful Spice Junction is. \u00a0It was well worth the drive across town, and before I leave Columbia, I will go out of my way to eat there again. $8.99 for lunch/dinner buffet for a spread this size is a great deal. It's delicious too. There are different rates for children's buffet and take out. As you enter, head towards the rear of the restaurant to the buffet line. There is always someone there to answer any questions about the food or help you with anything else. Water is also self-serve. We filled a pitcher with ice and water. What a cool concept!My favorite items were the naan, butter chicken, almond chicken, fruit salad in pudding, semolina pudding and the vegetable samosas. But everything was delicious. Next time I will try one of their salty lassis. The most impressive thing about Spice Junction is the great customer service. \u00a0Reheena (I'm sorry for the misspelling), the owner, is an incredible hostess. She greeted us warmly and brought fresh naan to our table. She offered us more bread and checked on us regularly. Her sons help out at the restaurant also. The youngest one at the register is very sweet.Another reviewer mentioned that there wasn't much of an atmosphere. I would have to disagree. It was quiet and perfect for conversing with others at your table. \u00a0My husband and I did not have to talk over any loud music or TV. The place is simply but tastefully decorated. If you're looking for something fancy, this isn't it. \u00a0I've been living out of a suitcase for weeks now and I'm grateful for places that have good food without prevention. Lastly, I judge a business on how clean its restrooms are. Spice Junction \u00a0did not disappoint. It was very clean."], ["Greg W.", "First I'm just going to say, this place was a little hard to find. \u00a0I had an address, but no description/map (I was navigating via phone), so I drive by it twice (the exterior signs were very hard to see in the traffic pattern that I was following) before I found it tucked away in the strip. \u00a0If you're looking for it as a first time customer, it's South of Carolina Wings, almost at the corner.With that out of the way: Wow! \u00a0This was my first foray into the world of Indian cuisine, so I didn't know what was in store for me. \u00a0I had my own preconceived assumptions and expectations (I was thinking spicy and hot), but was completely off in what I had imagined. \u00a0The flavors of each dish were boldly spiced, but I found everything to be sweeter than I thought it would be. \u00a0A couple people in my lunch group had mentioned heat, but I didn't get that at all (maybe my senses are dulled from years of abuse...). \u00a0Everything else has already been explained in previous reviews, so I'll just add to the notion that I can't wait to go back!"], ["angela l.", "Butter Chicken is the Best in Town.  \u00a0 This Indian scrumptiousness will make you want to become the adopted child of the family that own the restaurant, even if that means you will have to run the register part time. Despite the weird paranoia of all the cameras mounted to the ceiling and walls this family is very pleasant. If they are not real familiar with you they may \"linger\" around the buffet while you make your plate but I believe it is out of helpfulness in case a newbie comes in and does not know what the dishes are.  \u00a0 They do have a concern of the typical American that will over fill and waste a plate without respect, and the general rule is if you leave a plate of food uneaten you will have to pay extra. This ain't no Golden Corral folks! However with that said if you appreciate food and the ones that put their hearts into it than there will not be any food left on your plate. This family truly seems to want to share with you a little piece of their culture and home so that you can find peace in the butter chicken and joy in the samosas.  \u00a0 \u00a0In case you didn't get the clue, the food is amazing! They bring you fresh hot naan to your table which is a special treat if you are having a buffet. Our usual plan of action is to get a bite or two of everything, taste and then try to decide what to fill up on. Our second trip to the buffet is to get a plate full of our favorites, our third trip is to get just a few more bites of the one thing we will be thinking about for the rest of the week, and then our fourth trip is for the mango semolina dessert. This beautifully orange colored stuff is a yummy finale to a fantastic dinner, buttery, sweet and fruitful you may want two bowls. My words of wisdom is open your mind and try it all you may find a surprise in the roasted cauliflower or a wow in the weird -what is that?- corn mixture. And be nice to the family and they may very well take you in."], ["Monica M.", "without a doubt the best Indian food around!! I was hesitant at first, after reading reviews of harsh buffet rules...but tried it anyway. I can honestly say, the rules listed (will be charged full plate price for too much food left on plate) are there because of a small few. My daughter had never tried Indian food before, and we were told not to worry about that rule, that a sample plate was acceptable for first timers. Its too bad a small few have to spoil for the rest of us, but I wanted to clarify that rule for others who may be considering this restaurant. Excellent service, a great family restaurant with caring, professional, attentive staff and AMAZING currys and Naan :)"], ["Jackie P.", "Can't get enough of this buffet. Loved the fresh naan, the paratha, all the delicious curries, and that yummy mango pur\u00e9e. Best Indian buffet I've ever been to. \u00a0Wanted to go back the next day for round two, but they are closed on Sundays :("], ["James G.", "Was looking for $$ to $$$ restaurant, this place kept coming up with good ratings. So what the heck. This was my first time eating Indian food so judge from there. I was greeted with a smile and warm welcome, told them this was my first time eating Indian fair, they gave me some directions and away i went. It was buffet, I got a little of every thing my plate could hold. Every bite was wonderful, warm bread was brought out, went back for a sample of the rest again it was wonderful. The only problem I had was my last trip to the buffet was to choose again. This is a Mom & Pop place two young sons working also. Food is prepared by the Husband and Wife with a little friendly competition.I would eat here once a week if I didn't live in B'ham."], ["Tim N.", "The definition of \"hole-in-the-wall\". Family-owned restaurant with fantastic service. The food is fresh and delicious with lots of vegetables. Clean, simple dining room filled with happy customers. Can't recommend this place enough!!!"], ["Jane D.", "There is a lunch buffet marked with what each dish is."], ["David B.", "We left the interstate in search of this gem, and were not disappointed. They brought fresh Naan to our table, but everything else was conveniently self-serve. \u00a0The buffet is quite extensive with lots of variety. \u00a0 The location is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area, however we called on the phone and the owner was very gracious in helping us find our way."], ["Beth And Jim S.", "He said: place is buffet only. Family running it seems nice. Naan brought to table and very good. Curry chicken spicy. Butter chicken delicious. Goat biryani tasty but spicy. Mint chutney spicy. I guess the locals found out about this place because by 6, half the tables were full. Tandoori chicken a little dry but good flavor. The semolina dessert was really tasty. \u00a0 Will be back.She said: We had the dinner buffet. Not a bad selection for the price ($8.99), The butter chicken was very good, as was the fresh naan."], ["S W.", "Sooji Halwa (semolina porridge) is possibly the best thing that I have ever tasted. Go read the comments about the butter chicken; yes, it really is that good, but did you know the secret? It's cashew nuts.Still the tastiest Indian food in Columbia or the Midlands."], ["Tessa G.", "Seems they have changed their restaurant from buffet to combination platters only (at least for lunch). You now have the option of several combinations (veggie, chicken, or both) and can also order single orders of their items. I ordered a combo lunch which comes with one chicken dish and two veggie dishes along with rice, samosa, small piece of naan, papadum, and something else (sweet) that I don't know the name of. \u00a0All was good especially the veggie dishes but not great. Naan could have been a little fresher. Overall I enjoyed it and will most likely go back for lunch again but I wouldn't say it quite lived up to expectations."], ["T H.", "Best Indian in Columbia, and I have tried them all. Great family owned place with excellent and consistent service and immaculately maintained. But the food is the best part. \u00a0The complimentary naan is provided fresh from the oven instead of cold on the buffet. \u00a0Great value and one of my all time favorites in town."], ["Kel B.", "I was SO excited to try this place because of all the great reviews. \u00a0I had never eaten Indian food before and really wanted to try it.All of the food was good! \u00a0They didn't have a big selection, but I tried everything on the buffet and everything was delicious! \u00a0Worth the ten bucks a piece for the food. \u00a0The naan was sooooo good - the other reviews are right!!!BUT!, what in the heck is up with the owners staring you down the ENTIRE time?! \u00a0As soon as we walked in we were glared at by the woman behind the buffet who just stared at us and followed as we walked down the buffet...... \u00a0It was so awkward! \u00a0Also there were about seven video cameras pointing at the dining area. \u00a0It's a TINY one room restaurant. \u00a0Also, violently worded signs all over the walls about the buffet rules. \u00a0What in the world!?It was very creepy. \u00a0I liked the food, but jeez... \u00a0pretty sure I won't be coming back due to the prison-like atmosphere."], ["Gregg W.", "Great food and great service! \u00a0The proprietor was genuinely nice and friendly. \u00a0She was pleasant to talk to and was a positive addition to the meal. \u00a0She was a great server and great help. \u00a0She helped my wife navigate the buffet, since my wife has never ha Indian food before. \u00a0The naan is great...as is everything else I ate, which was just about everything!This is a small and humble restaurant that delivers the perfect match of cuisine and customer service....I left the restaurant feeling very satisfied gastronomically and emotionally....a great local business to support instead of another shoddy national chain."], ["B H.", "at first glance, I was skeptical, the exterior and the fact that it was empty when we went in made me a little worried. But I was thoroughly surprised. LOVED the food. so good. Would go back again and again. I've eaten indian food in various parts of the country and this is top notch. very nice employees and it was a clean place."], ["Denise K C.", "This restaurant has a 99% approval rating on Urban Spoon. We have been a fan of another Indian restaurant near Dutch Square, and we still are. But when the family wanted Indian, we decided to venture out to somewhere new.Spice Junction has NO Atmosphere, but it buffet style, prices are cheap and the food is delicious. And the Naan - WOW! Yes, I'll have more please."], ["Thomas B.", "Excellent naan. Buffet style...owner keeps the hot fresh naan coming. Ask for less ghee on it BTW. Vegetable dishes better than the chicken. Chicken rather dry. Incredible value. Dinner $9.62. Was so cheap I left a $5 tip. Excessive largess?"], ["Becca D.", "This is, without a doubt, one of the best restaurants in town. I've been here more than a handful of times, and the quality has never changed. The fresh naan is delicious, and they have added a warm, spicy tomato soup to the buffet which is really nice for the cold winter months. I am a vegetarian, but my boyfriend says that the buttered chicken is somewhat like tikka masala and is one of the best things that he's ever eaten. This is a $9 all-you-can-eat buffet, but the quality of the food is akin to the most expensive Indian food that I've eaten in cities like New York and London.I don't remember the exact price for carry-out, but it is less than the mediocre per-pound hot lines at places like Whole Foods and Earth Fare, and obviously the food is way better. A carry-out box would definitely hold enough food for two meals.I like Spice Junction so much that I've asked my parents to bring me here for my college graduation dinner.And as a bonus, the sweet family that runs the restaurant is almost as much incentive to love it as the food itself.In response to the post about being charged for a second adult buffet if you don't clean your plate - I saw the signs but assumed that they were a joke. My boyfriend and I both left some sauces and pickles on our plates, and no one batted an eyelash.I don't think it would be unreasonable for a restaurant to have extra charges for customers who repeatedly waste significant amounts of food."], ["Cassie M.", "Found this little gem here on yelp. \u00a0 Food was amazing and reasonable. \u00a0We had the lunch buffet, which runs $8.99. \u00a0The owners are extremely friendly and kept the hot naan coming to our table. \u00a0Just make sure to finish your plates, kids, or you'll pay for the buffet twice."], ["Jo I.", "Don't let the strip mall location fool you - the food here is excellent. Buffet-style Indian like you've never seen it. Choices change daily, so there's always something for everyone.

NO! but i have the kid enlighten me on the rules of the buffet once more, you HAVE to chose 4 items or more, and you HAVE to have 1lbs or more of food. once you are ready to pay, you will be paying a pretty penny for your to-go box. another thing i don't like, its how they charge for uneaten food, and watch you very VERY closely while eating. i thought it was just me feeling out of place until my boyfriend says to me, \"is it me, or are they really watching us\".what a shame the food is great, but the rules can leave you feeling a bit uncomfortable :/"], ["John P.", "Have tried 3 different Indian restaurants in Columbia and this one is the best. \u00a0I introduced my girlfriend to Indian food and now she suggests that we go here every Sunday. \u00a0Food: 5 starsGreat selection of some of my favorite Indian dishes. \u00a0All spiced well and good variety. \u00a0Love finishing my buffet lunch with the mango pulp and rice pudding, very refreshing.Atmosphere: 4 starsSimple decor, but its all about the food.Service: 5 starsThe owner goes to the kitchen to fix a fresh naan as soon as we walk in and they are always willing to explain dishes and answer any question that we have."], ["Todd T.", "Went here one Sunday night. \u00a0Great food!! The owners are really helpful in describing the food. Great variety of options on the buffet"], ["Paul G.", "Food is always good, although it'd be nice if they offered some variety and changed the items a little. They're always pretty much the same. But that's not what this review is about. This is about their odd customer service. They are extremely strict about their 'no wasting' ruke even going as far as pointing out to you that it's strict whike you're getting food from the buffet. They always watch you with evil looks in their eyes, like thinking you're always up to something. They're paranoia is further enhanced by the 15 cameras all over the whole restaurant. Very weird indeed for a small restaurant. Anyway, like I said... Good food, they just need to stop being so...

They will cook more for you. Help yourself to the free water station. You can refill by the glass or jug. Sodas are also available for purchase if you want.The food is so yummy & flavorful & we always walk out completely stuffed. \u00a0 \u00a0:)We have been coming here regularlyfor 3 weeks now & we absolutely love it.It is well worth the drive.

This is the only Indian buffet in the area that doesn't saturate their dishes with ungodly piles of salt. \u00a0Their use of spice is very sparing--too sparing for my tastes--but they do provide ample options for adding spice, such as green chiles and assorted chutneys. \u00a0The buffet is a bit heavy on chicken, but they seem to always have one (fairly good) goat dish for the fowl-phobic among us. \u00a0Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options too. \u00a0Nothing exceptional, but everything is consistently palatable, which is (again) more than I can say for other Columbia-area curry dens.The folks who work here are pleasant, helpful, and apparently dedicated to providing good customer service. \u00a0And at 9 bucks for a dinner buffet, the price is right for a night of all-you-can-eat curry."], ["Scott G.", "This Indian buffet is off the charts compared to the others in Columbia! \u00a0Super clean, amazing, gracious, kind owners who seriously love their customers. \u00a0Oh yeah the food, well it is amazing in its own right. \u00a0The tandoori chicken it's actually served spicy on the buffet and is awesome along with everything else."], ["Tabitha S.", "Great place.
