I don't know if it is still under the same ownership. Early this spring on a Tuesday evening the place was closed without any notice. Today May 29 for lunch it was open. \u00a0There were several customers seated. I stood by the front door in a bright red shirt for several minutes totally ignored by the gray-haired man behind the counter. I noticed at least two tables did not have their food. One couple with menus who were also ignored by the staff got up and left. I took that as my cue to leave since I got couldn't even get eye contact from any of the staff. I could see a dark-haired woman working in the kitchen. The gray-haired man totally ignored me waiting at the door and the other customers \u00a0waiting to order at the tables. \u00a0I did notice he was on the phone filling a to go order. I guess that is more important than live customers waiting for their food or to be seated. It's a shame the only Greek restaurant in Oak Cliff fails to be appropriately staffed and fails to pay attention to walk-in customers. \u00a0Lucky for me I can just go to the grocery store and start making my own Greek food. I have a lot of friends that eat out and I certainly won't be recommending this place anymore.Update: Another Yelp reviewer filled me in that the family running this business was experiencing some medical issues that likely caused the inattentiveness back in the recent past. I will revisit the Greek Cafe since the food has always been good.Revisited for a late lunch August 2014...service very slow. It appears that the owner is handling all seatings, taking phone and carry out orders, and waiting tables. I could see another person is the cook. My side salad was very fresh and tasty. Gyro sandwich generous and also tasted good. No refill offered for my water. I had to get up from my table to ask for my check and pay. The owner (cashier) could not remember what I had ordered even though he took my order and served me. I believe the guy is just trying to make ends meet by wearing too many hats in keeping this restaurant afloat. I'm no doctor but he obviously is not fit to handle all the tasks attempted. I very much want this \u00a0cute neighborhood Greek Cafe to thrive but service is just bad here even at 2pm for a late lunch with most tables empty. Please get competent and attentive servers. I'll try take out next time to hopefully avoid the frustrating table service. Three hopeful stars."], ["Alex L.", "Really good place to satisfy your gyro craving.

Daugher Joanna and father Mike make up half of the staff here and they are wonderful! Customer service is bar none the best you can experience. My parents owned a small business in the late 90s and early 2000s and this reminds me of the service they'd give at their own business. I met Joanna the first time when I moved into Kessler Park and ordered a couple Gyros. I told her I love hummas and would have to try it next time. She packed me a sample of her hummas to go. Before that I asked her I'm looking for a good local gym and she made 2 suggestions. When I returned the following week she had remembered me and even grabbed some of the gym fliers for me! She said, \"I grabbed these specifically for you!\" Amazing! Mike is a really amazing person too. Even if the food was mediocre I'd be a regular here. Now for the food. The food is NOT mediocre. It is absolutely amazing. I've only lived in the area for a month and I've been back half a dozen times already. I go for take-out, I go to dine-in, I take friends and family.. I do it all there! They Gyros are the best this side of Chicago. In fact, their meat is imported from a Chicago based distributor and that is a good thing considering how many awesome Gyros can be found in Chicago. They have a Greek lasagna that you have to try.. But be aware, it's so good that they'll sometimes run out if you go for a late dinner! So go early!!!

I greated the owner in Greek, which was followed by some bantering. I had to show him my ID to proove I was authentic Greek guy lol! After Leo looked at the menu, lost for a few minutes, he asked what he should get. So I ordered for both of us, just off the appetizer section: Dolmas, tiziki, humus, some wonderful salad the guy made on his own, spanakopita . . . . OMG all delicious! It was difficult for us to carry on a conversation because everyone there kept going on and on about whatever was coming to mind. JUST like home!!!

Lucky us, it was delicious. \u00a0We ordered babaganoush, which was delicious. The moussaka with perfectly cooked vegetables, also delicious. The baklava, which was very good, but not the best I have ever had - otherwise i might have given the place 5 stars. I prefer my baklava with a more buttery, and slightly lemony flavor, and no chocolate.Service was good and friendly, if just a little casual. \u00a0We will go back. I really want to try some of their other offerings.It would benefit with a few minor changes in decor, like softer lighting, maybe some candles..."], ["Jo R.", "Beyond good...especially the gyro platter and their numerous dessert options.

My lunch was $13.95 for today and then $1.79 for coffee. There was only one other customer in the restaurant. There was a table that looked to be done with some stuff lying on top of it. But the owner was sitting down at another table chilling. The food was good, especially their flaky crusted tilapia. The salad was okay..standard pre-mixed lettuce with tomatoes and cucumbers. There were only two dressings..some creamy one and a red vinaigrette dressing. It wasn't a great place but it wasn't bad. Too few of a selection for my hungry self."], ["dean d.", "Small, dumpy, not much to look at inside or out, and they run out of menu items between lunch and dinner time for some reason, but dang, is this food really good.On a recent visit for an early supper, they ran out of Spanakopita (why no one knew) so I settled for the huge and flavorful Dolmas: you get four large stuffed grape leaves, just squeeze lemon on each and enjoy with the yogurt dip.I have my favorite over here: Mousaka. Layered Eggplant/potato/ground beef that is very tasty and comes with a huge greek salad that is enough to share.Don't skip dessert: shredded wheat Baklava is what I normally get, although you must try the new Chocolate Baklava (dark chocolate that let's the Baklava shine)."], ["R.

So when my glass appetizer plate landed on the table linen, I could see food, hair and guck under my plate. \u00a0That did it for me right there- but we had already ordered, so I had to press on despite this issue. \u00a0I went ahead and put a paper napkin under my plate so I couldn't see underneath, but it didn't keep me from focusing on what was under there.We ordered the hummus appetizer for $5.50 and out came a tiny ball of hummus and pita bread. \u00a0The lady came over and told us that her food processor broke and she had to make it by hand. \u00a0That conjured up too many bad images of her with her actual hands smooshing chick peas. \u00a0Which made me think of the hair on the table linen. \u00a0We ordered water and when I squeezed my lemon- the lemon guts swirled in the water. \u00a0Normally that is great, but not this time as I kept thinking of the guck on the table linen. \u00a0They do not have lunch specials. \u00a0The gyro was small and just one piece of pita bread, not a \"wrap\" like I am used to. \u00a0Plus the meat inside wasn't shaved- it was like little meat balls. \u00a0So while I am eating this meatball pita sandwich, I am freaking out about what is on the table linen.Bottom line- it is like an older couple (Greek/not Greek I have no clue) decided that they liked to cook at home so thought why not open a restaurant."], ["Justin P.", "Great service and gyros that are out of this world! \u00a0Nice family-owned business."], ["Steve W.", "I cannot say enough good things about this tiny \"hole in the wall\".

I would recommend getting the mousaka, rack of lamb, \u00a0grecian chicken or the lamb skewers.

I ordered the egg plant dish which was mostly a halfed baked potato - barely any ground beef and very little egg plant. The dish was very overpriced for what I got. I was very disappointed. The service was good, and the deccor was very attractive. I wish I could say that my food was really \"GREEK\". Thus far I agree with other restaurant experts who say that there is really not any good authentic Greek food in the DFW area - they are correct.

Today I had the distinct pleasure of dining for lunch at Zizikis at Forest and Preston in Dallas. The service was prompt and polite and the waitress was able to accommodate my substitution request with ease. For an appetizer I went with the artichoke dip and pita bread. This was a Greek hummus with artichokes, garlic, lemon and warm pita bread. While the hummus was fantastic, it was the pita bread that was distinctly rememberable. So much so I asked what made it so tasty. The owner informed me this all came down to Greek oregano with some salt, pepper and garlic. For lunch I opted for Salmon Souvlaki (skewers) and a side Greek salad with Ziziki dressing. I preferred the light salad compared to the standard potatoes. The meal arrived promptly and the skewers were served atop a large round pita bread. The salmon was perfectly moist and fell apart with the touch of my fork. It was pretty easy to clean up my plate. I opted for a coffee to close out the meal and the addition of cinnamon was a welcome surprise. Overall, this place bleeds of authentic Greek food and I'd highly recommend it. Also learned they are building an outdoor patio which will open soon. Be sure to check this place out!"], ["Lori B.", "If you haven't been to Zizikis lately. The Salmon Salad alone is worth a trip!

Lucky for me I had Sara as my waitress. She walked me through the menu and recommend a few things I might like. I started with the Lamb Lolipops 2 generous chops nicely seasoned and grilled, served with a rich mushroom sauce which lifted the flavor of the lamb. Next was the Pastichio a Greek version of lasagna. Lamb, macaroni, tomatoes and b\u0117chamel. This was baked stacked and rich with flavor. Of course I ate it all. They say to save the best for last and the Baklava Ice Cream Cake was my favorite. Layers of Baklava and homemade ice cream with a drizzle of honey on top. It was a great end to a great lunch.

My friend had the Veggie Souvlakis and was extremely pleased and highly recommends the dish. The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable which was perfect for lunchtime conversation. We decided to split the BaklavaIce Ice Cream for desert which is a signature item created by Chef Costa. The layers of Baklava were a nice compliment to the cold creamy ice cream which was served with a light honey, Grand Marnier Orange sauce. It was an absolutely amazing experience."], ["Mia G.", "I don't enjoy much greek food, but this place has amazing pita and humus. The humus tastes very fresh, the seasoning is perfect.

The Ziziki plate's spanakopita and the pistachio was all very fresh. We would probably come here again."], ["Aquilina C.", "The dessert was amazing! Meal not so much.

The new remodel in the front room looks amazing and the patio will definitely be where we sit once it cools off some. We were told that there are new owners that are eager to try some new things such as food of course, but the $40 and under 1/2 price bottles of wine on Monday and Tuesday's is a great start!

Chicken was tender and moist but for 18? Hmmm. The plate also came with roasted potatoes that were DELICIOUS. I loved these the most. My friend ordered the Greek Island Chicken, which was basically \u00a0the same chicken as my dish, but in a semi-creamy sauce, along with the potatoes. Again, good but also 19 dollars. Service was on point, the server was polite and efficient. Ambiance is cute, with white table cloths and dim lighting with candles.

If you are waiting, they have a wonderful paper gift shop called Paper Affair that you can scope out awesome things to look at and see.If you have never been, the one appetizer I recommend is the Artichoke Dip which is has wonderful soft pita bread with an artichoke garlic hummus dip that will not only keep you eating but wont prevent you from eating the main course.To be frank, you cannot eat there without ordering something with Lamb. If you don't try it - you're missing out. Perfectly cooked to your specific preference, the rack of lamb is served with excellent mashed potatoes and yummy asparagus.Other dishes to try are the Lamb Salad and the Greek Burger ( pita bread with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, their special sauce, and lamb )The pan roasted potatoes are great to eat with the Lamb Salad and the Greek burger.

The seed it planted gave way to the solution to the ever-challenging riddle of \"Where is some place different that we can eat?\" Despite being under-dressed for such nice environs, we were treated like valued customers. Our server was polite, friendly and did a great job keeping up with our needs. However, that was simply a bonus on top of the great food we had.We shared a large appetizer platter to start. Personally, I thought the combination of feta and Ziziki sauce on the grape leaves was a bit much but the others thought it was fantastic. I enjoyed the spanikopita despite not being a Spinach fan.We split three main courses. Believe it or not, I did not order the Greek cheeseburger but wish I had. It was juicy and flavorful, plus the pita actually provided a perfect complement to the patty. I had the Grecian chicken , which featured two Christina Hendricks' sized breasts, smothered in a delicious becamel sauce and ample amounts of mushrooms. This dish was indeed the hit of the night! Finally, we had the pastichio (Greek Lasagna?) which was nicely put together but slightly off-putting due to inclusion of an unknown spice (I think cinnamon)We left agreeing that we would certainly revisit Ziziki's again. The only downside is that it will undoubtedly become a regular part of our restaurant roulette rotation so it will stop being \"different\" relatively soon. Of course, that is a risk that I am willing to take."], ["Aliyah K.", "You know when you look at the clock in the car and think to yourself...\"2pm? No wonder I am so hungry, I forgot to eat lunch.

I could have started, middled and ended with this too! It was fantastic! The lemon and garlic added a nice complimentary pairing of flavors and the pita was so flavorful and warm.

I only wish they had Lavosh, but the stuff they did have was wonderful. Most of the salads have cheese on them already, so if you're not a dairy person, it might not be a great spot to get your salad on. There are a lot of digestion-inducing ingredients in the buffet: eggplant, fried cauliflower, mushrooms, olive oil. There are also some anti-digestion foods: cheese, spinach, nuts, pita. So whether you want to speed up, slow down, or maintain your digestive activities, Cedars probably has something for you. The dining room is really nicely styled with big wooden chairs and tables arranged in a manner that allows for communal dining as well as large groups. Once seated (after ordering/paying at the counter and then grabbing your grub), a waiter will come by to get your drink order. I overheard some lady say the peach tea is amazing.

BUT, if you get to-go, it's $4.99/lb. If you do the math, you see that you'd have to eat 2 lbs of food in one sitting for the dine in option to get the same bang for your buck to-go. I certainly can't do that and would rather take out 2 lbs of food that i could eat over several days!And oh the variety and delicious tastes! Many of the items are minimally seasoned with salt, pepper, herbs, and olive oil in accordance to a mediterranean diet, but the flavors of the food is all super on point. There're several delicious cold salads, curried couscous, tabouli, grilled eggplants, carrots, zucchinis, hummus, babaganoush, pasta salads, flatbread pizzas. Then don't forget to turn your head to the hot foods section which is also part of the \"vegetarian feast\" deal. You won't see any meat except shrimp on any of these items, but who needs meat when you have delicious fried cauliflower, mediterranean stewed okra, seasoned mashed potatoes, wilted spinach, rice pilaf with caramelized onions, marinated mushrooms and zucchini, and so much more!

I know...it sounds confusing, and my writing isn't helping that fact, but trust me...the temporary confusion is totally worth it!Like Trinh T. says in his review, you have to get the bread when it's hot. There are times during the less busy hours that you may come across some bread that's been sitting out for a while, but trust me and wait until some more comes out! I always get some hummus for one of my sides! They have multiple options in the hummus department...regular, spicy, there's some kind of spinach, and some kind of mushroom hummus as well. I always stick to the spicy, and it has a pretty decent kick to it too! The falafel is done extremely well too! It's some of the best falafel in the area that I've tried (if someone knows of some better, please let me know!). They bring it out to you after you order it so it's always hot and crispy on the outside, and soft and flavorful in the center. The falafel platter or the falafel sandwich are both excellent choices..you can't go wrong with either. Sometimes going through the line I get overwhelmed!

That night I went to pick up the order. Dealt with the owner and he was extremely nice. Offered me water while I waited on my order. He went out of his way to make sure our first experience was a good one. Other than the lid to the tzakiki sauce not being closed all the way and spilling all over everything else in the bag the experience was great. The food was amazing.

I have a 15 month old and a 4 year old which makes it very hard to go out and \"sit down\" and eat dinner as a family. This experience was no wear near as pleasant as the first and that's why I'm giving them one star. The star is for the food... not the service.

I told her forget the kids orders and just make the chicken gyros/soulvaki. I hung up and told my husband & he said, the kids need to eat too. I called back and cancelled the order immediately. The lady on the other end of the line was so rude. I said I would like to cancel the order I just placed and she said okay, then hung up. She did not even ask my name. I called back to make sure she knew to cancel my order and again she was extremely rude. I told her about my pleasant experience the previous week with the owner and asked for her name so I could speak with him regarding her attitude. She said, I'm Ruby, the owner's wife.

Since I was really watching my carb intake I decided to just get the special, which you get one dip, salad choice, rice or veggie, and one protein. I went with spicy hummus, a Greek salad, steamed broccoli and the baked chicken breast. For the price, I think it was $11.95? I got a TON of food! They loaded up my plate with plenty of hummus and sides. The chicken was a decent size and had this great flavor. The white meat was nice and juicy and not so dry. The spicy hummus was delicious, and Greek salad with the balsamic was great. I will for sure be back here for a nice treat meal without over doing it!"], ["Amanda J.", "I ordered Fadi's through Favor for lunch today. I got the falafel wrap and a side of plain hummus with pita bread. Pretty basic! I've had better hummus, but it was still very tasty, and was more than enough for 2 people.

Spinach hummus and spicy hummus won't do it for you? Well you can add a scoop of regular hummus and red pepper hummus as well! \u00a0They have a bunch of salads and pasta salads, and my favorite is the veggies section. Try the roasted cauliflower :D \u00a0The plate comes with one meat though, so choose wisely-- they had chicken, fish, and lamb shank laid out, but you can ask for schwarma that they'll go and carve for you. \u00a0Lamb shank was very tender, but schwarma always makes my heartstrings sing~ ^^ \u00a0The pita bread is tender and warm, and the wheat one is slightly sweet, yummy! \u00a0To-go boxes are available right beside the soda fountain for you to bring home your inevitable leftovers.

I got a gyro sandwich with spicy hummus to go. It was expensive. They gave me a full side to go when its obvious that I cannot possibly eat the whole thing.

Less than an hour later, my Postmate delivered us this amazing spread. I got the vegetarian sampler (comes with a Greek salad, 3 types of hummus, cous cous, pickled veggies, and other deliciousness I can't really describe) & a side of falafels. My friend is a huge meat & potatoes guy so he chose a 1lb of gyro meat & roasted potatoes. We both loved our food, it was huge portions and just super affordable, I think this whole meal was about $23. The potatoes are some of the best roasted potatoes I've had in a long time. I also loved the gyro meat and veggie sampler. I'm a salt fiend, as in there was a time in my life where I carried salt on me to put on things - but I do think the gyro here is pretty salty...I liked it but others might not take to it as easily. Also, I think we could have done without the falafels, I've had better elsewhere, but I don't fault Fadi's for it. You can't shoot 100%, 100% of the time, can ya? ;)Order from Postmates and you won't have to wait in the long lines, apparently it gets pretty busy during lunch time.

It's a bunch of people scattered. I saw a lot of people eating alone or in pairs. It would also be easy to pull together a few tables for a larger group. In general, this place is easy going.I prefer the beef shawarma sandwich ($6.29). I've also gotten the dolmas (4 for $2.99) which was very good and the tabbouli which was perfect.

This time, however, the cashier said it was actually a beef/lamb combo and always has been. I was fine with the meaty duo if he was correct, I was just a bit taken aback. Despite the cashier's insistence, I have my doubts about the accuracy of his assertion. Confused, but undaunted, we also ordered our usual side dish of hummus and pita.Fadi's fresh homemade pita bread is amazingly fluffy. It's always warm too. The hummus is incredibly creamy, and is definitely the best I've ever had. It's packed with flavor too, more than you'd expect from chickpeas.My shawarma was crisp on the outside with tender slices of meat(s) beneath. The accompanying side of yogurt-based sauce adds a great flavor. All of the pickles give this sandwich a nice crunch, but the tomatoes don't add much of anything. I guess I need the vitamins though, so I won't complain too much. Pro tip: forgo the yogurt sauce and spread hummus on your shawarma instead. The added creaminess and combination of flavors is spectacular!We got a free slice of baklava for checking in on Yelp. My wife usually gets embarrassed by my use of Yelp offers, but she was more than happy to sample the baklava this time. At her behest, we got the walnut variety rather than pistachio. The baklava was very sweet, but sort of dry. I liked the walnut flavor though. Oh well, it was free.This wasn't the best I've had at Fadi's, but it was still a very tasty meal nonetheless."], ["Jayci G.", "Cafeteria style Mediterranean food - huge variety of salad choices and meat to order.

Whenever you ask them you want more of an item on your plate they get mad and will put only a little bit. They want you to fill your plate only with the cheapest things like rice and couscous. The meat is very bad quality and with not even half of the options that they claim they have on their website. There are much better mediterranean places than this Fadi's here in Dallas.

Fantastic break from my work day!"], ["Jared K.", "My wife and I have talked about trying Kostas Cafe for years now, but this was our first time inside. Overall, I wasn't very impressed. The blue and white decor was very Greek, though extremely dated. They are in dire need of a Restaurant: Impossible makeover. There wasn't much of a lunch rush at 12:30 on Saturday, so we had no trouble finding a table. The first thing that caught our attention were the dirty tablecloths on our table. Kostas had only been open for 30 minutes thus far, suggesting that the soiled linens had been there for quite some time. Not exactly appetizing.We started with an appetizer order of hummus and pita. The pita was warm and tasted homemade, as did the creamy hummus. There was a good amount of garlic to the hummus. It was all really tasty, but there wasn't near enough pita bread to go around.My entree was a gyro plate, which apparently comes with green beans and potatoes, as well as a Greek salad.The salad was really good. It was loaded with fresh, green lettuce and plenty of feta. The dressing was really light, the perfect combination of oil and vinegar. I'm not really much of a salad person, but this one was very enjoyable.I usually like green beans, but the ones that came with my gyro plate weren't very good. They were big, flat beans and tasted canned. The potatoes had a decent flavor, but were a little too al dente. I discarded both of my side dishes after the initial tasting.As for the meat, it was tasty but oddly crisp. I'm guessing all of my slices came from the outer layer of the spit. I much prefer thicker, tender cuts of meat. The pita bread that comes with the gyro plate is somewhat thicker and fluffier than the appetizer version, which worked better for the gyro. The tzatziki sauce had the consistency of tartar sauce and had far too much dill. Rather than continue on with the unsatisfying tzatziki, I loaded my gyro meat up with the leftover hummus from our appetizer course.Our server was very friendly. That being said, he refilled my glass of iced tea after every 2-3 sips. I appreciated the attentiveness, but it really jacked up my sugar ratio.I really wanted to like Kostas Cafe.

The inside could use a little update but I think they are going for the \"Grandma's house in Greece\" feel."], ["Emily C.", "After living within walking distance of Kostas for a few years, I finally decided to give this little Greek restaurant on Greenville a try.We were greeted by a very personable server who took care of us throughout the meal. There seemed to be just maybe three waiters working, but with such a small restaurant, it was fine. Our waters were kept filled and food came out fairly quickly. Great service overall.We were started with warm bread and butter, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside (just how I like it), followed by the salad that came with our entree plates. The salad was a good size, fresh crispy lettuce with plentiful feta cheese, and I enjoyed the garlicky dressing it came with. I tried the chicken souvlaki, which was perfectly tender without falling into the common pitfall of being too dry. It came with a side of okra and rice. My fiance got the gyro plate, which ended up being served with the potatoes instead of the vegetables stated on the menu - no problem though, since he ended up liking the potatoes a lot more. The plate came with a lot of tasty meat, but the highlight was definitely the pita. It was so soft!I'm no Greek food expert, but I do know what I do and don't enjoy, and Kostas is definitely one Greek place i DO enjoy."], ["Jessica D.", "Had my first date here...this place has the best food in town! The chicken lemonato is to die for!"], ["Edward F.", "3.5/5 good food, ok service, ok location. I recommend it, it's like home cooked food.Small place"], ["Victoria S.", "My six-year-old is an emerging foodie, and when he tells us he's craving something, we cave. Last Friday it was spanakopita and gyro. Our usual place closed over a year ago when the owner decided to retire, and we've been searching for a replacement ever since.We tried Kostas Cafe based on solid Yelp reviews, and we weren't disappointed. The basics:1) Logistics. The place is tiny. Our family is a party of five with three kids in the mix. We know better to hit places during peak dinner rush for seating accommodations and for the comfort of other diners. (We're not stupid!) We were running late last Friday, but we didn't have a problem getting seated at 6PM on a Friday night, which was shocking since the place is tiny. By 7PM the place was humming, and there is absolutely no waiting area. You walk in, and if you can't get seated, you might as well walk out.2) Service. This was our second visit with about six months in between visits. We had the same server both times, and she is absolutely outstanding. She is a broad and comes off like one. At first you might think she's rude, and yes, she's brusque, but she is kind, funny, efficient, and helpful. And she didn't bat an eyelash at our traipsing in on the front end of the dinner rush with my three tired, bedraggled kids. That always scores points with me.Both times we were at Kostas Cafe, the owner was on the premises making sure guests were comfortable and happy with their food. He really seems to stay on top of his business.3) Food. Vampires beware. The amount of garlic in the food at Kostas Cafe would ward off vampires in all of Texas, its border states, and possibly across the Gulf of Mexico. But to our family, that's a good, good thing. We opened with a trio of spreads and pita bread. The trio included tzatziki sauce (duh!), hummus (duh!), and an eggplant spread. I don't know what to call the eggplant spread because it's not like any babaganoush I've ever had, but it was delicious. Their tzatziki sauce is thick and creamy. (I hate runny tzatziki.) Their hummus is not as smooth or thick as some that I've had, but I loved it because of the garlic factor. We had to get seconds on pita to devour all that spread. There wasn't a drop of any of those three spreads left.On to the gyros. Warm pita piled high with lamb, and the onions, tomato and tzatziki are on the side so you can dress your gyro as you see fit. Yum. The gyro platter comes with two sides, and I don't know if they change from day to day. Last Friday the sides were Greek style green beans and potatoes. Yum. And even before you get to your gyro platter, you're given a choice between a salad or cup of avgo lemono soup. My husband had the salad, and it was huge for a pre-dinner salad, and they don't skimp on the feta like some places do. I got the avgo lemono. And it was good.I can't speak to the other menu items, because my family won't ever be able to get past that trio of spreads and gyro. But we have found our gyro home for sure! We'll definitely go back! Definitely recommended!"], ["Ian F.", "Fantastic food. We had the chicken plate I would highly recommend! !!! Also the pita bread is wonderful"], ["James O.", "Atmosphere is scary when you first enter, but the food is alright. \u00a0A nice little gem to eat at."], ["Mario C.", "Hidden gem! Highly recommend the veal lemonata and the freshly baked pita +tahini appetizer."]]}
