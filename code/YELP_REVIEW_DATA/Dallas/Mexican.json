They have a great patio as well."], ["Scott L.", "Hanging out with a pretty girl on a mission to day drink on a Saturday, horrible words came out of her mouth \"I want to go to Maracas.\" I cringed. \u00a0She's vegetarian so I knew her choice was influenced by their history of always having a few vegetarian offerings besides salads and cheese centric entrees.I frantically blurted out other options since my last experience was \u00fcber mediocre.Like a cab ride to average.I conceded, and the next thing I know I'm scarfing down chips on a pleasant covered patio with enough eye candy to somewhat assuage the insult. Then three words came into play. One dollar mimosas. After ordering a mimosa, six words from my waitresses mouth were thrown against my head like a swiftly volleyed dodgeball.\"You have to buy an entree.\"Pretty girl was happy with black bean soup and tilapia. \u00a0 I inquired about mole enchiladas, which were available off the menu. \u00a0 The mole was the non sweet kind and felt a bit dull but the chicken meat was decent. \u00a0The paint interior has been updated to a cheery cream color from the former sundried tomato red and overall the recent change in ownership has seemed to have improved things from my last failed visit. \"They always seem to have drink specials.\" She pointed out. \u00a0This always makes things better. Chips were still not highly rated, they were cold and though not stale, had a certain lifelessness from being bagged. Maracas isn't a place Id suggest for tex mex in Dallas, but the environment is pleasant and the daily drink specials make things liveable. Food - just ok but not super horribleAtmosphere - liveable $1 mimosas - Bomb"], ["Jenna H.", "One of my new Mexican favorites! When I was visiting Dallas, my best friends said this place that they recently discovered in Deep Ellum was better than any other Mexican restaurant in Dallas, so of course I was willing to go! The 5 of us went at 8pm on a Saturday night and half the place was empty. I was shocked considering the great Yelp reviews and weekend timing, but we were happy because the patio was immediately available. The patio is decent size and fun!!They have valet, so that's a plus, but we used Uber since it's easier. Must Try Items- Avocado margarita: It has fresh avocados and pineapple mixed in it. I was skeptical at first, but love avocados and had to try it...on the rocks and SO good!! I had two of them and was feeling very good. I asked for Patron instead of the brand on the menu, and they were made strong!- White queso: AMAZING! A large bowl can be shared by 5 people easily. It's huge and super yummy!Pros- Chicken flautas: I love flautas, but do not like the standard green sauce that Mexican restaurants serve. My flautas were half-covered in a green sauce, so I was bummed at first, but then I tried it, and it was incredible!! I don't know how they make it, but it's not the typical green sauce you get elsewhere. It was sooooo good! They came with yummy rice and beans as well. Everything had wonderful flavor!- Our waitress was attentive and awesome. I was chugging water like crazy, and she consistently refilled my glass!I typically like places like Blue Goose, and this is a new favorite. Everything was amazing, and my meal was only $12. My total was around $40 for a meal and two Patron margaritas.Warning: Their house salsa is very hot, so if you don't like spicy, the chips and salsa won't work for you. Loved it!"], ["Gricelda P.", "Went to Maracas for the first time on a Sunday at dinner time.I thought the place was a little too dark and dingy, I wasn't very sure what to think.After looking at the menu, I saw that they had several things that sounded very good. I ordered the potato enchiladas with chipotle sauce. First, I have to say THANK YOU for not making vegetarians eat just cheese enchiladas. Is nice to see a couple of choices! The food was very good, the service was great and they have daily drink specials, which is hard to find on weekends.I had a mango margarita and I liked it a lot. The special was $4.50 for margaritas of any flavor. I loved the fact that the mango one was not a gross pre-made mix like most places, you could taste little pieces of mango pulp in the drink, very refreshing. My friend had the raspberry one and he loved it too. The people who ordered the regular margarita were not happy though, they said it was flavor-less.I think I would go back, but maybe during the day because I did find the place strangely lid which made me feel like maybe it was secretly dirty."], ["Gabriela C.", "This place is amazing!!!! $1 mimosas Sunday brunch speciala. Not to mention the best Mexican lasagna ever had! Great staff and the music brightens up the atmosphere too. Enjoy!"], ["Han N.", "Just unforgettable Authentic Mexican food. Amazing queso I have ever tasted. Chips came out hot and fresh, salsa had bountiful flavor of fresh and savoring taste. We ordered the combo fajitas that came with beef and chicken. The beef was amazingly tender and juicy, cooked to perfection. The juicy chicken was so flaky right when you place your fork in it. We had a wonderful waiter that sold us on desert, cuatro leches. The slice was huge! Delicious, moist, and perfect, not overly sweet. Overall, great experience and a delightful atmosphere to capture the authenticity of the restaurant."], ["Jackie C.", "Went here on Wednesday...read an ad in the Observer about $1 Margaritas when purchasing an entr\u00e9e. Well the menu also had as a Wednesday special $8 Fajitas (that's an entr\u00e9e). Wait staff was very rude about this stating they have no specials on Wednesday.... So okay, I ordered a full price entr\u00e9e. We had to literally hunt down the waiter for another Margarita. Ordered food they brought the adult food out first before the children's meals!?!?? The food is very bland, no taste and it is very over priced! Will not be recommending this restaurant to any one!!!!"], ["Amy B.", "My family went to Maracas to celebrate my brother's 27th birthday. We were TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED! My dad found this place in the Dallas observer and decided to yelp it- we were all intrigued with how great the reviews were. KNOW THIS PEOPLE- IT'S A DUD. DO NOT GO THERE. The service is TERRIBLE! The black beans had no flavor. I was constantly asking the waiter to refill our chips/salsa. If you're in Dallas and want some REAL Mexican food, go to the El Corazon in Oak Cliff. \u00a0They has the best margaritas and service staff. Don't go here, it's a waste of money. . ."], ["Thu N.", "Sunday brunch. $1.00 mimosas. Best mimosa ever. I'm not big on mimosas because I think there's too much of an orange to champagne composition. It should be 1 part orange juice (or your choice of fruit juice) and 1 part champagne. At Maracas, it's more like 2 parts champagne and 1 part orange juice. \u00a0And for $1.00? My Eggs Florentine was not so great because it was served with a tomato sauce that ended up making my English muffin super soggy. I basically ate the eggs only with my side of potatoes. \u00a0Would I come back? Yes, for the $1.00 mimosas, \u00a0light and crispy tortilla chips, \u00a0and fresh tasting salsa dip."], ["David F.", "Decent Tex-Mex place what I like the most about the place is the location and the margaritas. On the weekends they have their house band which is pretty entertaining. I would describe the music they play as something you would hear in a Robert Rodriguez movie. The service is pretty good and its rarely over crowded. I would say this is the best place in Deep Ellum for Mexican food."], ["Minh C.", "We came in on a Wednesday evening and got the Wed special, which was the fajitas at half price. The portion sizes are good, but we had big appetites so we each had two of the fajitas. The white queso was delicious - I mixed it with the salsa, which made it even better! Try it!The staff was very friendly and always refilling our waters, salsa, and chips without us asking."], ["Michelle D.", "Good food and great service. The salad was great! Nice and spicy with good flavor and the Mexican lasagna was good it was a nice portion. The waiters were really friendly and prompt; you didn't have to wave anyone down for service."], ["Isaac G.", "Food is always great. Service is EXCELLENT,and you can't beat the $1 mimosa brunch special. Robert is the best server there so ask for him if you get a chance.

Went for a family dinner Saturday night, my wife and I just got married and they put a table right in front of the band, who were awesome!!! They had us dance and that was all amazing. The food made the place a 5 star! I and the main street special and it was to die for! Not too pricey and honestly for all the great staff and band of Saturday night I wouldve paid twice as much! Little hidden Mexican gem I would recommend to everyone!!!"], ["Milree V.", "Truly blown away at the current average rating for this place. The blandest texmex I have ever had in my 25 years in Texas. Poor service (understaffed, but staff was busting tail) and terrible food. Everything from the queso to the enchiladas were underseasoned and weirdly cold.The happy hour deals are nice - today was half price appetizers... Will never go back."], ["Shannon C.", "I really cannot say enough good things about Maracas - it is definitely my go to place for Mexican food, for the good food, yes, but also for the fun atmosphere and the great service. \u00a0They have specials almost every night, but my go to night is Thursday, because they have $4.50 flavored margaritas (try the watermelon - it's amazing!) and half off appetizers. The white queso is one of my favorite things on the menu! Fridays and Saturdays you get live music aka MANNY!!!! You'll have to go to understand my love for Manny, but he's very interactive with the guests, and there is a Conga Line! Also, if it's your birthday, you won't escape the tambourine and the little dance floor they'll create in front of the stage for you. Doesn't this place already sound amazing? And I haven't even touched on the food yet! I do have to admit that I always get the same thing. Queso (try it with beef - YUM!) and Beef or Cheese Enchiladas with, yes, MORE QUESO, on top! Oh, the flautas are also really good. Try those too! Maybe on your second visit, because you'll definitely be back once you try it once. Food comes out fast and hot! You'll know when people order fajitas, just look for the smoke!! Jose is the manager, possibly the owner, but either way he is really great and makes me feel special every time I go in! He is very accommodating. We came in with no reservation for a group of 20 and Jose explained to us that the restaurant was booked up with reservations, however, he made an effort to open up the back party room and was able to stuff us in there. Great! Wait staff is very friendly and attentive! \u00a0To say the least, GO EAT AT MARACAS!!!! Great specials, Great Prices, Great Food, Great Drinks, Great Service. You will love it."], ["Mikhael G.", "Awesome prices, awesome food, awesome service. I ALWAYS get the nachos...so I don't really know how anything else tastes.

Best brunch place in the DFW metroplex. Located in cozy quirky Deep Ellum, Maracas is right on Main St. They have $1 mimosas, the service is always speedy and the servers are always kind.

I've had their nachos, breakfast omelet, and tacos. Everything is always so yummy. This is my favorite place for brunch. You can't go wrong with $1 mimosas! They have patio seating too. I favorite this place over Gloria's and any other Mexican restaurant for brunch."], ["Jalyn S.", "Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name...This. Is. My. Spot. I love coming to Maracas. The food is good, there's never a wait, and the staff treats us like family. AND, the whole menu is half off on Tuesdays. The Mr. and I can eat a full meal for under $10 so it doesn't get much better than that.My faves are: sour cream chicken enchiladas, tortilla soup, mexican lasagna and the white queso.

This place is on the edge of Deep Ellum. I was glad I was able to find the one latin place in all of Deep Ellum (felt like it anyway) and it called to me from the opposite side of the street. We walked in and found the mexican martinis were good and strong and worth the $9. .. vs the watered down drinks we got at our hotel bar (at the Downtown Dallas Sheraton called Draft) We were given chips and salsa. The salsa was dissappointing b/c it was more sweet than heat. which is good b/c that means less calories!FOOD: We decided we needed to get some kind of dinner. . and decided nothing too heavy to ruin my buzz, we split the fish tacos. OMG that was freaking delicious.The fish was moist and had great flavor, grilled not fried fish! and the taco itself had the right amout of sauce/toppings, etc. So good. blk beans and rice were great, I'd order it again in a heart beat. \u00a0I had my heart set on Canne Rosso b/c we had it bk in April but I'm glad I stopped here. LIVE BAND: they had some band here (their picture is listed on their fotos page. the band was ok, more of a musical only kinda band, not too many words and the song had words they were on repeat . . nothing too intricate. . THE GOOD PART ABOUT THE MUSIC... was that while the band was on a break, 50% of the songs were MANA! THE best band in the world. ive seen mana there in Dallas at the AA center and Houston at the Toyota Center and again in Dallas at the H20 Mio water tour. .

I live across the street from it and am there either Tuesday or Wednesday (sometimes a Thursday) of each week due to the awesome specials and fantastic customer service. And the food still rocks!I always just sit at the bar. The manager opens the door for me when I walk up, shakes my hand, asks how things are going and escorts me over to the bar and half the time pulls out a bar stool for me. So awesome. What's nice is that the vibe is genuine--not like some fake act.Now, the real gold. The bartender. You can just tell he is very smart, a humble man. And really, really good at what he does and at anticipating what you need when you need it. The margaritas are among the best I've had, especially the \"skinny\" one without the fake sweet-n-sour/margarita mix that tastes like bathroom sanitizer. Its just lime juice, tequila and triple-sec for all I can tell. Really, really fresh and excellent, and half-price on Tuesdays!The \"spicy\" hot sauce on the menu is superb. I can't get enough of it. It is served piping hot and is a good contrast from the normal sauce you get for free (which is excellent in its own right). Wednesdays are $8 fajitas and Thursdays are half-price appetizers. The queso blanco + spicy hot sauce is meal enough, though. All really good and I highly recommend it.They also have a good mole, one of my favorites."], ["Arturo E.", "This place was a let down.

I think Maracas has replaced Monica's - not sure why - but the air conditioning was blasting, the drinks strong, and the food delicious, so who really cares what the place is called? We had 6 mixed drinks, guac/salsa/chips, a chicken salad, and a 3 chicken taco plate. The total charge was $44: AMAZING! The chicken breast on the salad was fresh and there was a good amount of it, but the dressing wasn't as salty as I hoped. I realize this is a weird desire, but I'm used to the fast food chain Pollo Loco's creamy cilantro dressing, and anytime creamy cilantro dressing is less flavorful than that, it makes me wish I were in the Pollo Loco drive thru instead. The chicken tacos were good, nothing super special (but chicken tacos are frequently nothing special). The fresh salsa and guacamole were the real meal makers, and they were so perfect. The salsa was perfectly spicy, and super fresh. The chips were warm. The drinks were also strong, so perhaps that is why my memory of the food eaten after the chips is hazy. It was a good base for the ridiculous amount of drinks I had after we left Maracas around Deep Ellum, the food assuredly being the only thing that prevented my death from alcohol poisoning. Thank you Maracas for saving my life!Also, the servers were extremely attentive and sweet, and the interior was clean. I will definitely be back, and I'll try to drink less this time so I can report back on their entrees with more authority."], ["Chaka C.", "If you're looking for a cheap brunch that'll get your Sunday Funday started off on the right foot, look no further than Maracas.

With that much orange juice flavored champagne coursing through your veins, it's easy to overlook the actual food, but it actually isn't bad. Standard tex-mex fare and they're very open to substitutions, if that's your thing. I've spent hours here \u00a0with large groups of friends on Sunday mornings, and my tab has never gone over $20.

My bf and I stopped in here earlier tonight for dinner, and I had some high expectations, given how popular this place was before it disappeared. I was a little apprehensive, as I am usually a poultry girl when it comes to tacos. I saw none on the menu. What they DO have is a roll call for authentic D.F. tacos. (That's Mexico City's Federal District, for those of you who were not aware) Bistec, pastor, tripas, cabeza, lengua, chorizo, and suadero. I ordered three al pastor tacos, and then my bf and I got curious as to what the suadero tacos were all about. The taquero explained it to me (it is beef that comes from an area above the udders), and even offered to let us have a taste. We happily agreed, and downed that sucker FAST. It was absolutely delicious. My al pastor tacos looked as appetizing as they were tasty. I loved how juicy the meat was, and the fact that the tortillas didn't rip in two in my hand. Everything about those tacos, from start to finish, was amazing. The tacos are inexpensive...about $1.35 per taco. What will get you are the Mexican sodas. Those are $2.50 a pop. But nonetheless, you CAN'T have D.F. tacos without Mexican soda, so just buy one and you will be glad you did. I can't wait to go back.

I've been to all the Tacos La Banqueta locations around the metroplex (Arlington, Fort Worth, and 2 in Dallas).

It's a $9 'rita, and worth every tequila soaked penny. My fella had the mole enchiladas, and they were spectacular. The mole has a very rich, deep, flavor. He is a Santa Fe food snob, and he was extremely impressed with the mole. I had the combination fajitas, and they were tasty. Our server was attentive and checked on us often.

Definitely a positive sign when looking for authenticity. ;) Second, good Mexican beverages. It was busy when we arrived that Saturday night, so we first sat at the bar and had drinks. I tried the Pacifco (one of several Mexican beers available) and enjoyed it. My friends opted for margaritas and a spicy concoction that I can't recall the name of. All good.Third, yummy food in generous portions. I had the fried catfish filet, which came with enough fish for two people. The fish was flaky and yummy (I kinda believe anything's good once you deep fry it). ;) We also helped my friend with the Parridilla, which was beef, chicken, shrimp, and sausage on a grill. We ate the Parridilla with awesome corn tortillas and guacamole (which had to be ordered separately). So good.Finally, the entertainment: mariachi! There was a mariachi group playing music for patrons who paid (which seemed kinda silly because even non-paying patrons could listen to the music). Really set a fun, festive tone. The only downside was that it felt too loud at times, making dinner conversation a struggle.What a fun place to eat Mexican food.

I know, I know, I have a sizzling platter of chicken and beef in front of me, but all I could think about was how good those tortillas were going to be. I was not disappointed. They were fresh, delicious, and the absolute perfect medium for the meat. The beans are cooked in lard and the guacomole was spot on. I sampled a bit of my girlfriend's plate, and the tomatillo sauce on the chicken enchilada was up there with the best I've had. I walked away satisfied and can't wait to try out more places in the area. If you are craving real Tex-Mex, and appreciate a good tortilla when you taste one, you must come here.

The wife thought it was a bit too acidic but she was comparing it to what we had in Costa Rica. I did not think it was too acidic at all. I did wish for chips bigger than the strips, however. The portion is quite generous and more than enough for two people to share. We could not finish ours. Based on Yelp reviews I ordered to Carne Asada and it was superb ($21). I ordered it medium and the meat was juicy and tender. The best part is the wonderful flavor from the marinade. The sweet corn tamale was excellent also. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat. The manager stopped by and congratulated me for ordering the best thing on the menu. The wife got the duck (Pato al Pasilla, $22) and thought it was excellent. The duck was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. The only thing she did not like was the tiacoyo which is sort of like a fried black bean pancake with napolitos and red chile sauce. The black bean thing was just plain weird and she did not eat it.The service was very helpful, although a tad slow. But it was a busy Friday night so it was understandable.

We got ceviche as an appetizer and it was delicious! My husband ordered the tenderloin enchiladas and those were very good as well. The meat was tender and the tomatillo sauce was delicious. I had the lobster enchiladas, which were fantastic. My only complaint is that the wait for the food was a bit long and so was the wait on my drinks. Granted, they only had 1 bar tender. I had a Jamaica Paloma and my husband had the Mesa Martini. Both were very good! I especially liked the Mesa Martini. For desert we had the stuffed plantains.

The chips weren't good enough to be finished, neither was the ceviche. I don't eat factory farm meat, so ordered black bean tamales of some sort with plantains. The plantains tasted like fried bread? sugar? Not sure what was happening, but everything on my plate was fried-ish with too much oil happening. A plus was the flavorful sauces that accompanied. I'd have liked something better to eat them with.My buddy got shrimp and rice, basically. It was *fine*.The best part of the meal was the spicy margarita I ordered.

They all left loving it and looking forward to coming back the next time they're in town. I got a good taste of at least half the brunch dishes amongst all the members of our table, and for me the standouts were the:-The first item on the brunch menu.. delicious, heavenly mole and eggs!- Chilaquiles: best version I've ever had and i normally don't jones for the dish much- the Huevos/pancake egg dish: a great classic, more familiar dish for those shy of this whole authentic vera cruz thing ... the egg scramble was perfectly fluffy, the pancakes well-sized, fluffy as well, and not leaving a brick in one's stomach after, and the Mexican style tomato salsa I had was a great addition to the eggs.- The Ceviche: as with the dinner app. version, this stuff is crack. Amazing amazing amazing. I just want to eat it all day. You HAVE to get if it's your first time to Mesa!-All their cocktails have been standouts, and this time the Caipirinha and Horchata at our table were spot on, again.I also had a bite of the tres leches cake, which was delicious and perfectly moist without being drenched at all. I still favor the chocolate/flan dessert cake slice that I had the first time I was here though, that was the best flan i've had!...Sadly, I read over at Side dish that the early hype has come crashing to a halt and that Mesa is at a /risk of closing if attendance doesn't pick up again. :-(. This has been one of if not my all time favorite dining experience in Dallas since i moved here a year ago, for the heart with which the delicious and unique food is served, and it makes me disappointed in Dallas if a place like this cannot make it but some of the flashy yet culinarily-vacuous scenes in west village continually thrive.I couldn't agree more with Sidedish that \"this is a gem of a restaurant.

Once we got seated at our table, we ordered the shrimp empanadas. The mole sauce complimented the empanadas so well that I continued eating the sauce after the empanadas were gone. For the main entree, I ordered the lobster while my boyfriend had the mole duck dish. My plate consisted of jasmine rice, avocado stuffed with tuna and mango salsa (absolutely amazing), and two lobster enchiladas. I normally don't like lobsters but this dish was super delicious. I managed to sample some of the mole duck which was also amazing! We had two drinks which were the old fashioned and Mesa horchata.

The latter two were unfamiliar to us both, but super delicious. Although Mesa doesn't seem to be a chips and salsa type restaurant, we asked our waiter he happily brought some out. Maybe that's because their chips seem to be homemade and only served with the guacamole? Their salsa that day was super spicy, but really great. A few other tables (including a large group) had the great-looking guac and pretty drinks. We then shared the chicken mole enchiladas, because MOLE. One of the best sauces in the universe when made well. And wow, Mesa's mole is probably one of the best I've ever had. Like I could probably eat it as a soup.

Don't be fooled by the small reception area as you enter. The real treat is in the patio in back. It is an air conditioned covered patio that is definitely one of the most romantic patio designs in Dallas. Carlos is the bartender that I'm pretty sure never gets a day off as I have never been there when he wasn't working. \u00a0He always greets with a smile and has great suggestions for the delicious cocktails they offer.

It was one of those Friday nights where we knew the extent of our activities were going to be dinner after running errands, but just nothing sounded particularly good. Then I remembered Mesa - Coastal Veracruz Cuisine. When does that ever not sound good? We arrived around 9pm not sure whether to expect a Friday night crowd and to hope for seats at the bar or to hope it was an off/slow night for them without jinxing the livelihood of their business. This is located down the street from the Texas Theatre, but surrounded by a few slightly rougher looking laundromats, thrift stores, etc.It happened to be the latter - the smaller inside was fairly full, but they have maybe the best heated patio ever (warmth wise) and we were immediately seated at a lovely table for two out there. They also have a second bar set up on the patio which is nice for those busier times when you don't want to have to wonder if your drink is ever coming. I had the spicy margarita and the boyf just had a modelo especial. This is one of the best margaritas I've had in some time and had just the right amount of kick, while proving to be quite strong without tasting that way.The Ceviccheee. Ceviche is one of my favorite foods in the world - the idea of using the acidity in lime juice to cook something just fascinates me and it fascinates my taste buds even more. The menu states either shrimp or red fish (on this night), and we asked for a combination of both. This was enough to be a meal for one person - we did run out of chips but it didn't really even need chips and instead of asking for more I ate it by the spoonful because it was that good.I had the Guiso Del Rey for my entr\u00e9e since I basically always defer to the seafood category and I didn't see duck offered this particular evening. My bf had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas. Neither of us is usually a fan of mole at all, but I'd heard so much about this 20 ingredient mole that I was more than thrilled when he decided to bite the bullet and give it a shot (so I'd still get to try it without risking ruining my own entr\u00e9e - I'm unselfish like that). Both were served with simple, plain sides of rice but itMy dish was chock full of seafood: good sized shrimp, mussels, octopus, clams etc. in what was described as a Dos XX broth with jalapenos. It was accompanied by a side of garlic bread for sopping. I could have used more flavor in the broth, as served over rice it was still lacking something - with the bread on the side I started to think this broth would be like the super rich, winey, flavorful broths served with some of the best mussel dishes). The Chicken Mole Enchiladas were also really good and definitely changed my mind a little about mole, but just a few bites would have been enough for me. We did take the tiny amount of enchiladas leftover to go, which they packaged for us in the cutest little teeny tupperware. This leftover portion was the perfect amount of mole for me before I it became too much and I did wake up the next morning excited to eat it for breakfast :)Service from Carmen was great and the prices were actually really reasonable. Will definitely be back in the future although not close enough to us to rush back this week or month."], ["Lainey H.", "We heard that Mesa was having some financial difficulty, so we decided to lend a hand.

Though I left the same girl, I left with a full belly and a healthy appreciation for the hundreds of flavors that create the perfect mole.Going with a group of friends? I would suggest the dessert sampler - try a little bit of everything. The rice pudding is covered in cinnamon and probably the best choice - but everything else, especially the chocolate flan, deserves a chance to dance on your tastebuds.I can't wait to go back and try more of the Veracruz menu - I doubt they can do any wrong."], ["Allison L.", "Whoa.

I'm sure it's hard to find a TexMex \u00a0restaurant that doesn't rely on machines to pump out the hundreds of tortillas that are served each day. \u00a0Sisters have a special place in the back of the restaurant where they make each one literally with love.I decided on the chicken chipotle quesadillas as my meal and I was so happy with that decision. Plump pieces of chicken and deliciously fresh spinach line the inside of this quesadilla but there was also a surprise that laid within. I thought to myself that these quesadillas seem to be a little richer in taste and perhaps more messy than the ones that I normally eat-Come to find out that's because there is a thin layer of sour cream within each one. Not exactly diet friendly but they sure are delicious!Be sure to order a seasonal margarita while you are here since the restaurant utilizes fresh fruit from urban acres!"], ["Madeline D.", "We have been searching for a Mexican food place and we have FINALLY found it!! We came to Bishop arts to go to another Mexican place, and saw El Corazon and had to try it instead!! The salsa was great, food was great, and service was excellent. Only complaint was that my marg wasn't very strong. We will definitely be back!!!"], ["Joel G.", "Upon entering, the aroma of sizzling fajitas filled the room so I didnt need to pour over the menu as I usually do. The chicken/beef combo was a good portion with all the usual fixings and I wish the meats had a little more flavor. The whole fried jalapeno did add a little kick. Cilantro rice and boracho beans were very tasty as was the salsa. \u00a0Our server was also okay (had to ask for things he forgot) but observed other servers who were much more engaging with their guests.I'll go back but just order something different."], ["Chris D.", "It was okay, the steak was however above average and the drink will put you on your ass!"], ["Jackie C.", "My husband and I come to El Corazon at least once a week. I absolutely love the bartenders Jackie and Amy, they have the best attitudes and super great service! I love the cilantro rice and the Layered Bean Dip is awesome not to leave out the fajitas excellent. \u00a0This is the best place for a House Frozen Margarita and inviting environment!! \u00a0Love the El Corazon :)Jackie & Abe Back"], ["Shondip C.", "Great food, casual ambiance, but on the loud side. Guacamole not worth it, mostly lettuce."], ["Dave G.", "El Corazon de Tejas is a new/old place for terrific Mexican food and enormous margaritas. Some will have visited the spot when it was Tejano, a much beloved joint \u00a0in the OC. While the place has had a makeover, the ownership has only changed slightly. The Cuellars of El Chico fame still own and run the place but just a different branch of the family. Happy hour is a great way to begin exploring the El Corazon. Domestic and import beers are (if memory serves) $3-ish and soup-bowl sized margaritas are $3. They will bring you the standard chips-and-salsa to accompany your drink. Your first taste of the good things to come will be a wonderful red salsa that is bright and full of smokey chipotle flavor. For dinner, the overall impression is that everything is freshly made and subtly flavored. It is easy for lazy Tex-Mex cooks around town to clobber their food with the spices of the Mexican flavor profile and call it a day. Not so at El Corazon. I chose the mole enchiladas, and though I am not a huge mole fan, these were great. The sauce was delicate, mildly chocolatey, and delicious. A friend chose the Guiso de Res and pronounced it phenomenal. Corn and flour tortillas are made to order. I verified that there is a person in the kitchen who scoops dough into one of those cast iron tortilla clappers and then slaps them onto a grill for each diner. It may seem like a small thing, but fresh tortillas really do add a dimension to the meal. El Corazon's atmosphere is open and congenial. The service was good. The prices are reasonable. The food is much better than most Mexican places in town and reasonably priced."], ["Joe S.", "Ate there Friday, October 31. \u00a0Service was great and the meat fried pie I ordered was great also. \u00a0Free Parking was a plus. \u00a0Near the Bishop Arts district"], ["Rob K.", "This food was not only delicious, it is worth writing home about. Here is a place worthy of Tex-Mex in Dallas."], ["David L.", "We dined here last night. The last time that we dined here is when they transitioned from Tejano's and they had a limited menu. We were not impressed then but chalked it up as new restaurant kinks. Last evening we decided to give it a try. \u00a0First off, the food was really good. \u00a0I wish I could rate food and service separately. Food would have a 4 for sure. \u00a0Service lacked something to be desired and the restaurant was not all that busy. When it came time to pay the check, the waitress brought the check. We laid down the credit card and waited for her to pick it up to process. We waited and waited and waited. \u00a0I finally walked to the hostess and asked if i could pay the bill at the bar. \u00a0She said I had to pay the server I explained we had been waiting almost 15 minutes. \u00a0She begrudgingly took the check to run the credit card. \u00a0She brought it back to me a few minutes later for me to sign. \u00a0I asked for a pen and she did not have one. \u00a0Once again she walked off to get one. \u00a0I signed, asked for the manager and told him our experiences. \u00a0He had no words for us. We advised that we would not be returning and would not recommend the restaurant to any one."], ["Michael V.", "Best Tex-Mex we have found in Oak Cliff so far!The food is always delicious and the service is prompt and friendly.Their happy-hour deals are great, and the food itself is reasonably-priced.Do yourself a favor and get an order of the churros with caramel for desert. They are amazing!"]], "Desperados Mexican Restaurant": [["Nicole H.", "Food couldn't have been better. Hands down best Mexican food I've had in a long time. They blew the roof off with their Margaritas... Especially their award winning \"La Margarita\".

It's another #dontmissgoodeats"], ["Ashlee B.", "(+) Pros: Amazing top shelf margarita (it's like a Mexican Martini if you've ever had them from Trudy's in Austin) and so delicious & healthier option! Service was great & quesadillas were yummy. (-) Cons: Sangria frozen swirl margarita was SO sugary it gave me an instant headache. Queso was not very good. Best Queso (coming from an avid fan-addict) is Gloria's. Great little patio area - would definitely come back but doesn't top my list as somewhere I'm craving or would take visitors from out of town to because there are so many great mexican food places in dallas with great atmosphere, drinks & food."], ["C.

I wish lived in Texas so I could come back here!"], ["Jason B.", "Best cheese enchiladas in Big D? They are certainly in the running. Perfect texture and just the right amount of cheese and chili sauce. Beans and rice are a solid version, as well. Also, service is great and I love the old school atmosphere. JB"], ["Eddie C.", "3.5 stars, but I'm feeling nice, so I rounded up.Desperados is a good, no nonsense Tex-Mex restaurant. When I lived in The Village, I came here more, but when I'm in the area, I'll still drop by. My favorite time to come is on Thursdays, when their famous tacos are reduced in price. These tacos are not the street tacos you are accustomed to. They are real tortillas that are deep fried, then filled with either chicken, beef, or both, pico de gallo, and a slice of avocado. I know it's just a taco, but they really are that good. Aside from the tacos, I really enjoy the build your own plate option. Here, you can chosse from any 1,2, or 3 of your standard Tex-Mex favorites. Options include different types of enchiladas, tamales, tostadas, and more. To me, the enchiladas are 3 stars, but having the freedom to build your own dish is a nice touch.If you're feeling more carnivorous, the fajitas are some of the better ones around. Very well seasoned and always served sizzling. Definitely worth trying at least once."], ["Edwin S.", "Food is decent, \u00a0but nothing to write home about. \u00a0 Portions are pretty small, \u00a0especially for a state that prides itself on big portions. \u00a0 \u00a0Prices are on the high side as well. \u00a0 I can't understand the high ratings for this place when there are so many other options around."], ["Lauren D.", "Good but not great. \u00a0We were looking for a tex mex place for lunch to replace our current lunch options so we decided to give this place a shot. \u00a0Unfortunately everyone agreed that this place falls short of our other two options. \u00a0The fajitas are \"fine\". \u00a0They're not great but they're not bad. \u00a0The lunch size portion is plentiful but I found them to be lacking in seasoning. \u00a0Mine did not come out sizzling. \u00a0They also don't come with sour cream so you must ask for that. \u00a0El Fenix does better fajitas. \u00a0My friend says that Banditos does better fajitas. \u00a0Both of us agreed to disagree about which one did it better, but both of us agreed that these are not the best...they're just ok. Better than what you could get at say...Chilis but not as good as what you'd get at the average chain tex mex place.The chips and salsa were solid. \u00a0The chips came out hot, but I think they were sitting under a heat lamp, not actually freshly made. \u00a0They tasted fine. \u00a0The salsa had a great flavor to it so I wavered between 3 and 4 stars for this alone.My friend got a bad order of rice that had to be sent back. \u00a0We couldn't tell what was wrong but it just tasted...off. \u00a0Everyone else had rice that tasted fine but his was bad. \u00a0They fixed the issue quickly. \u00a0The prices are in line with everyone else. \u00a0It's not super cheap but not expensive.Ambiance was decent...the place is dark but has a certain charm to it. \u00a0 Parking can be pretty tight if you go during a popular time.We probably won't be back since it wasn't really amazing. \u00a0If someone else chose to go here and invited me, I wouldn't have a problem going back and giving it another try though."], ["Ruth C.", "We went with a group of 12 last night. If you are not a \"foodie,\" then you'll love this place. Worst fish tacos I ever had--tasted like very old frozen fried fish that was microwaved. Most of us at the table did not care for our food. Restaurant looks like it did in 1980s. Needs a facelift and maybe the floors cleaned. It's basic Tex-Mex \"slop\"--but it's popular. We prefer Mi Cocina hands-down."], ["Stefanie L.", "I'm only giving this place 1 star because I absolutely LOVE the food that this place has and it's the only thing that keeps me coming back, the service however...From the moment we walked in we were greeted by an uninterested hostess that looked like she wanted nothing more than to be away from the restaurant. (FYI, you're supposed to set the vibe of the restaurant, at least fake a smile for us!) We were then taken to a table and when asked how we were doing, we attempted to reply to her only to be interrupted by an \"Enjoy\" and her walking away. Oh, okay, thanks for asking I guess. Service wasn't any better, our server took his sweet time getting to us, (we were seconds away from just returning the menus and leaving) unfriendly and uninterested. Really disappointed with this place which is a shame because they have really good food."], ["Lori G.", "I have been coming here since 1994. I have tried most of the menu but always end up ordering the Desperadoes tacos.

Chips/salsa were good, food was nothing special and service was forgetful.
