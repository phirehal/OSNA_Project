BUT GOOD.We only had takeout, so we cannot comment on the in-dining experience. Overall opinion, good food, but very expensive compared to most Indian restaurants.Pros:- Best Indian we have had in our 2 months in Dallas.- Rich sauces, full flavored- Nice location if you are dining in- Decent amount of chicken in dishes- Good real pakoras. Too many places frying onion strips and calling it pakoras. These were actual pieces of vegetables.- Free gulab jamunCons:- Most expensive Indian I have ever seen. I have probably eaten at 30-40 Indian restaurants across the US and in Europe and this place is at least 25% more expensive than any of them.- Rice not included with dishes... dishes that are $3-4 more expensive than most Indian places that include rice.- $5 for a side of rice? This one blows my mind.Overall, I have to give this place the benefit of the doubt because of how good the food was, however, I am not rushing to order there again because I am not convinced the food is good enough to justify spending $20-30 more than the just-OK Indian restaurants closer to us.If you are looking for a nice restaurant with good Indian and go into knowing the prices, you will enjoy this place.

Super moist and well seasoned to be a tiny bit spicy but not overbearing.

Anyway, whatever it was, it tasted good. Seems like they mixed chicken curry with separately FULLY cooked rice...just didn't feel Biryani-like. Also, the chicken pieces were very white and it was boneless which is very uncommon in Biryani and the presence of ripe tomatoes in the mix giving the mushy consistency was a big-no for Biryani.The amount of food was really a lot, good enough for two people and it was accompanied with great tasting raita-like sauce and the desi-salad: carrots, lots of onions and a slice of lime.There was a decent-size lunch crowed, seems like they have pretty good kababs and other items but Biryani not-so-much. With small size and modest lunch crowd, it felt like food items are made fresh here unlike most of the Indian restaurant where they keep days old curry-base and use it as long as possible.

Regardless, they offer enough to satiate those with the deepest stomachs.Since it's a buffet style, I would recommend grabbing/trying everything a little bit.

I even saw a small backyard vegetable garden across the street that Kalachandji's probably owns to grow some of their own food supply.The line for the weekend buffet started to form around the door before it was opened as I was entering the temple, which by the way is just across the hallway.The thing to remember is, their food is prepared using Vaishnavi tradition and thus lack onion and garlic; two very important ingredients of Indian cooking, not sure, if they use ginger as I didn't get any hint of it.Thus, it is no surprise the food lacks the depth and flavor of regular Indian vegetarian food.The buffet included a salad bar, brown/white rice, daal, steamed veggies, mustard greens, two main dishes: ocra-potata fry and tofu, papad and raisin bread made in-house. The buffet items gets rotated, so check their website, which can be somewhat useless as I found. The paneer/peas was on the menu that day and they served rather awkward tasting tofu, a really bad substitution.The tamarind water that comes with buffet is very refreshing. The food was just OK, nothing special. The okra/potato fry had unusually big potatoes and felt like something prepared with utter indifference. The sauce that came with tofu was somewhat sweet thus rendering useless for my taste. The best part was the dessert items. At the end of meal request for dessert, if they forget to ask you. When given the choice, ask for both the items. The pudding and halwa were both really awesome. The buffet area being small and always crowded is not really ideal if you want to go for additional food. The place is small, even the beautiful courtyard where you should really dine is small. There are two inside dining areas one, on the same enclosure as the buffet display and another a little inside to the right. The courtyard, albeit small, is beautiful to sit on a nice weather day.

I do wish they would hit all the dishes with a little more red pepper and warm things up a bit, but it was still yummy. If you have never been here, it has some interesting smells. But then again, downtown Dallas during a hot day has some pretty special aromas too. Just bear in mind that the dining area is second to none for being tranquil and the food is basic vegetarian. For kids you may want to think twice. My 10 ten year old really tried.... but he only ventured out for a salad and some rice. He tried at bit of everything we had and gave me the knitted brow \"you told me this was as good bacon\" look. Okay, I may have bent the truth a little. He did suck down the rice pudding though.

( I recommend looking out for their spinach casserole dish.. it will blow your mind). If the weather is nice I highly recommend sitting outside. When I came here with my friend the design of the outside area impressed me. The combination of the beautiful building, the tree, and mini fountain just took me to another place. When I came here to have lunch I felt the serene environment was perfect for our deep and semi philosophical conversation. The service here is amazing. The temple followers are really nice and super attentive. p.s. If you do visit please check out the prayer room to the left is so ornate and breathtaking.

The food line up is the same - a flavorful soup, brown or white rice, vegetables and a vegan and vegetarian entree. \u00a0The vegetarian entree is always eggplant parmigiana when I come and it's good.For $9.95 you get daily fresh made bread, salad bar, hot buffet, dessert and tea. \u00a0The candy section is gone in the coolgift shop, with Indian art, jewelry and clothes, but I was informed I could getsome fresh baked vegan cookies to go. \u00a0My waiter didn't charge me.The courtyard and restaurant decor are very cute like being in an Indian animated movie set.Food - basic but vegetarian, clean, flavorful and cheap.Environs - spooky turns spectacularThere is a certain quit careful attention to detail here that radiates a spiritual ideal.They turned the knob up on a more 20th century palette which is probably good for business."], ["Sarah J.", "I absolutely loathe onions! So I love that their food (by religious custom) is onion free. The salad bar is always fresh, never wilted and suspicious looking. The main dishes are of high quality as well.

Do not expect to eat Indian food. The food here may be inspired by the tastes and spices of India, but I would never classify it as traditional Indian cuisine.2. When you first walk in, it might look a little disappointing. There are only a few hot dishes in the buffet and then a salad bar. However, the hot dishes we ate were very delicious and memorable and made up for not having 10 different dishes to choose from. Also, I probably wouldn't even take anything from the salad bar next time as I was stuffed from the hot food items.3. The Cinnamon raisin bread is amazing.

I'm a garlic lover, and didn't even miss it in these dishes! The menu changes daily, although they do have some dishes that are routine.

I'm Indian and not vegetarian, and I have to say, the first two times I went there, I wasn't too impressed by the food. I went back because the ambiance of the restaurant situated inside the Hare Krishna temple more than made up for it. I've been there at least 5 times now, and I love it more and more each time I go.1. Food - buffet-style, completely vegetarian, I think it's cooked without onion and garlic (but don't quote me on this!). A wide variety of dishes - steamed vegetables, traditional Indian curries, daal, papad, a full salad bar, and even a lasagna-type dish which I'm not sure is Indian, but it's delicious. They have this amazingly wholesome, unique cinnamon-raisin bread. They also have cottage cheese (for protein fanatics like my boyfriend). Indian food is typically oily and heavy, but not so at Kalachandji's. The food has that simple, uncomplicated, fresh-ingredients feel to it.2. Ambiance - simply magical. It's small, quaint, and beautiful. You will leave in a calmer, happier mood, guaranteed. I love the temple atmosphere with the incense and devotees everywhere, but really, you can easily avoid this part if you're not into it. Just enter the restaurant immediately to the left when you enter, instead of going all the way down the hallway.

I've tried calling to verify what's actually being served, because of that disclaimer, but received a lot of attitude from the staff for asking.

The 8 or 9 dollar lunch buffet was very reasonable for the quality of food and the unique setting. \u00a0 \u00a0 I pretty much tried everything because I'm a glutton and there were lots of standouts. First of the cold chicken tandoori salad was very good along with some jasmine basmati rice, multitude of wonderful different chutneys and some delicious flat-bread called naan. \u00a0 \u00a0Couldn't help but notice the similarities to Greek pita, basmati and tzaziki during my food inhalation. \u00a0 \u00a0Next it was on to the curries and tandoori chicken! Having heard that chicken tikki masala is like the soft cheese taco of Indian food ( i.e. comfort food with a flavor safety net) I decided to go for this first and compare and contrast the other ones against this. \u00a0 \u00a0On my lineup was Goat, mushroom, pea and potato, and chicken tikki. I rank them in this order 1: mushroom 2: Chicken tikki 3: Pea and Potato 4: Goat. \u00a0 \u00a0Goat is lambs harsher whiskey drinking drug abusing cousin and must be burned with fire. The only good goat I have ever had has been jerk goat in Jamaica and spit roasted cabrito, both had lots of seasoning and flame grilled flavor. This Indian goat curry tasted like creamy old billy goat. \u00a0 \u00a0I soon forgot about all of this though when I tried the tandoori chicken, man this is some good chicken! Super moist, tender, and a mild grilled charcoal flavor,great with some more chutneys and naan! \u00a0 \u00a0Dessert offering was were pretty weird, one tasted just like a soggy cake bread donut hole with karo corn syrup.

Gross!! \u00a0They use reheated chicken in all their chicken dishes and almost never use fresh food. They also are super, super inconsistent.

Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, and originally from NYC, I'm a bit of a food snob. My favorite food category is \u00a0Indian, and I spent 6 months in India some years ago. The first thing I did after booking my flight and hotel, was to look for Indian restaurants in the area. I saw a review for India Garden, and this is how I found it. WOW, am I glad I went! First of all, they have Dosa, a paper thin, crispy crepe, served with coconut chutney and rasam. This alone could bring me here. This is a South Indian specialty, and not something you find in any old Indian restaurant. \u00a0Then the Goan Shrimp dish, took me right back to Goa, a place I have happy memories of. The chicken curry was so tender and flavorful I'm salivating as I sit here remembering it. And the Palak Paneer, full of beautiful green spinach was so fresh I felt like my friend's mother was in the kitchen in her sari cooking for me. (when I traveled in India it was with an Indian friend from college, so we ate in her relatives homes and were so spoiled with great food) This was such a great meal... I didn't even mention the rice, the naan, everything else... We ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. Well, I knew that before I left I had to come back for one more meal, so the night before I left I came back with more friends and we tried other foods, each one a delight. Oh, and the owner, Mr. Sunny, lived in NYC for many years and both times we came he gave us individual attention, making sure everything was perfect, which it was, and giving us little complementary treats to add to our feast. If I lived here I would eat here once a week. God knows if I'll ever have a reason to return to Texas again, but if I do, I'll be back.

The salad was good. However I guess they don't use chicken tikka, because it was simply cooked chicken breast: Chicken Masala. It was good, but I missed the extra flavor in the chicken. To their credit, they acknowledged the slow service, took off the salad from the bill, and gave me a free rice pudding.

Seriously though it's really good. First of all, they are located behind the Grandy's and Denny's so don't think they aren't there anymore because I promise you they are and worth the visit. Taj is a buffet style Indian restaurant, I made sure to try everything just so I could give a fair review. The food was great none of the dishes were over powered by the spices. They have a absolutely delicious tandoori chicken, and by that you are now safe to assume it is not strictly vegetarian. Taj does a great job of offering an equal mix of vegetarian dishes and meat dishes. In fact they even had a beef dish, which is something I have yet to really see at an Indian food restaurant. The palak paneer was perfect, and lentil and red beans tasted just like red beans and rice, and the Naan was light, fluffy, and fresh from the oven. It was the perfect side staple to the meal. As a side note, they do have music playing that we found very interesting. When we first arrived it would be what I considered traditional Indian music, by the time we left they were playing American music with a Bollywood theme. Imagine \"Desperado's in the Sky\" with a sitar being played instead of a guitar or bass, and yes they really did play that song. Very interesting and a touch comical."]]}
