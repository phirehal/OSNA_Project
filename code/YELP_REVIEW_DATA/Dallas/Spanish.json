{"Dragonfly": [], "Lark On the Park": [["Matt G.", "Let me start off by saying this place is one for those who know high quality service and high quality taste. All the servers and the manager Santiago was very friendly and knowledgeable of the product the bar and restaurant has in stock. Angel the bar tender was very nice and professional.Cons. Not too impressed with the flavor of the charcuterie plate and I don't like the fact I can't order a CUP of soup"], ["Michelle N.", "When the weather is beautiful, you'll want to enjoy it outdoors over a weekend brunch. \u00a0Where better to have it than at Lark in the Park!It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. \u00a0I was in a party of 4 and to my surprise, we were quickly seated without reservations! \u00a0They certainly had ample outdoor seating for small groups (two tops & four tops) but I can see more a challenge for larger groups.Expect service to be slow... but this will force you to actually sit back and relax. \u00a0Take a break from the hustle and bustle and enjoy yourself!The table shared a carafe of the seasonal mimosa. \u00a0We got lucky with mixed berries which was soooo refreshing and perfect for the day. \u00a0A friend had a bloody mary and enjoyed it so much, he had two.Among the group, we shared 4 entrees and had a bite of each:Vital Farms Eggs & Quinoa Bowl - the egg is perfectly poached to add the yolky creaminess to the quinoa and kale. \u00a0Sounds healthy but I assure it was comforting. \u00a0My guy friend who has a hefty appetite ordered this and he could barely finish his dish.Smoke Salmon & Pumpernickel - I love the twist they put on this traditional brunch dish. \u00a0The pumpernickel bread goes even better than your typical bagel. \u00a0Everything tasted sooo fresh.Lark Benedict with Duroc Ham - YUMMY! \u00a0The hollandaise sauce was perfect!Shishito Omelet - delicious! \u00a0We ordered a side of house-made sausage patties which went perfectly with this entree.You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! \u00a0I can't wait to go back to try more.Also, don't forget to appreciate the chalkboard art which is commissioned by different artists on a quarterly basis. \u00a0All your senses will certainly be enticed here! Once you're done, take a quick hop skip away to Klyde Warren Park to enjoy the rest of your day. \u00a0Now THAT is one beautiful afternoon!"], ["Steven N.", "Lark on the Park is a very nice looking restaurant. It's a classy place that's good for a date or with a large group of friends. Unfortunately, the great looks don't translate to the food, as I didn't really enjoy the two dishes that I tried. I ordered the lamb shank, which sits on top of cous cous with pine nuts, olives, and some pieces of feta. A majority of the lamb shank is covered in muhammara, which is some type of Turkish hot pepper dip. The meat was good, but nothing special or mind blowing. I didn't like the muhammara at all, and had to scrape all of it off as I couldn't stand the taste. I didn't enjoy the cous cous either as the pine nuts sprinkled throughout added a sweet taste when it should've been savory. I'm not really a fan of mixing flavors. My girlfriend had the moo krob, which was a Thai pork belly. I didn't really like the flavor on this one either. The service here is good though and if it's your birthday, you can pick out any dessert from the menu at no charge. Come for the atmosphere and view, but not so much the food."], ["Andi W.", "Good ambiance, cocktails and the brunch is pretty great. Proabalby the best and crispiest bacon I have had at a restaurant. On my last visit we sat outside and I'm not sure that was the best option for that day. Our server was a little inattentive and didn't seem super thrilled to be there. Don't really blame him, I'd probably be resentful if I was working on a Saturday morning serving brunch instead of eating it. I'm sure that was a fluke and I won't hold it against the place as a whole. This is a great location and after you are done eating you can always go across the street to hang at Kylde Warren."], ["Ivy W.", "Came here to celebrate Father's Day so we had reservations but it wasn't packed at all. I want to give this place 5 stars but our waiter forgot our bread, barely came by to check on us, and the food took more than 30 minutes to come out. Other than the service, I love the environment! It's so modern chic. There's these chalk like art canvases all around the restaurant. Also, the place is decked out with glass walls so it gives off such a refreshing feel. Music isn't too loud and the decor isn't over bearing. The food was amazing! The menu seems to have a strong Asian influence with items like bok choy, toke poke, and braised ox tail. The drinks were strong and flavorful! Try the Peruvian fields. I recommend the curry pillows appetizer and the seared scallops."], ["Emmy F.", "Took my family here one night and enjoyed everything about it. Complimentary valet parking (but tip is expected), and right next to Klyde Warren Park where we walked around right after dinner. Great atmosphere, great service, and great food. It's a pricier establishment but it's in an awesome location of Dallas and you definitely get your money's worth. I had relatives come from out of country and wanted to show them Dallas. I had made a reservation a week prior for 6, I would recommend reservations for weekend peak hrs bc this place does get packed! Especially around the bar where it gets crowded and happens to be right between the entrance and dining area. \u00a0For food I would recommend Seared Scallops, Braised Lamb Shank and Moo Krob. Very good dishes! I had a special which was a fish wrapped in bacon and it was amazing! So keep on eye for cool specials too. Good place for special occasions, highly recommend."], ["Beth D.", "An absolutely perfect business lunch destination, Lark on the Park has quickly soared to the top of my Dallas list. They have the kind of attentive service you expect at this level of dining - upscale, business casual, high-end gastropub feel, Standard American fare with a hint of elevation. Every time I've been, a suit-clad manager has opened the door for me, a smiling hostess has seated me immediately. Sitting at the bar, I'm brought a water without being asked - the manager breezes through afterwards and supplies the straw I'm sorely missing... also without having to ask. They just know what a patron wants. The atmosphere is bright and breezy with lots of light, and lots of clean, metal surfaces, urban wood and wrought iron furniture. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, facing Savor Gastropub (which could take a cue or two from its neighbor) and Klyde Warren Park. A favorite of mine here is their fruit & herb Spritzes - a menu of very bright and refreshing non-alcoholic drinks such as the Blackberry Sage Spritz or the Strawberry Basil Cooler, which will be mixed, crushed, shaken and served with all the care of a true cocktail, served with a pretty garnish and fully enjoyable. For a slight upcharge, you can make it \"stout\" with Gin. But for those who abstain at lunch, or, say, for the expectant mommy, it's nice to have an NA option that's not soda or tea. I've enjoyed their menu basics and a few entree salads (which appear to be seasonal and always fresh). But what I'll be back for is the 44 Farms Burger. This gem easily ranks near the top of my Best Burger in Dallas list and I'd recommend it to anyone who claims to be a burger aficionado. The beauty is in its simplicity: An extremely thick all beef patty seasoned with nothing but salt and boasting a height of at least a full inch, I recommend ordering it medium. It's completely juicy and tender, slightly salty and all things savory. Topped with beautifully caramelized onions, thin-sliced cucumbers which have been soaked perfectly in vinegar and salt, a thick steak cut tomato slice, a wedge of bleu cheese and a single leaf of green lettuce. And *muah* that's it. I've actually been complimented before on the fact that, as a lady, I manhandle my burgers and rarely ever cut them in half. But this sweet thing is so tall, you'll have to cut it down to make it manageable. French fries are the perfect side dish - this is just an American fact. And I know that truffle fries are all the rage. But Lark on the Park has come up with the perfect answer to the oft overwhelming truffle fry trend: Frying Rosemary and Sage leaves in with the fries, and serving them all tossed together. You'll grab a cluster of fries, dip them in ketchup, take a bite, and realize you're also enjoying a crisp, tiny element of Rosemary which adds the perfect flavor pop. It's all just so good. They also deserve praise for featuring (not just on the walls, but on their menu) local artists who come in and, during service, will create their chalkboard art for the season right there in front of the patrons if they're so lucky as to dine in on the right day. The work featured is beautifully impressive for being simply white chalk art. Local businesses supporting local art serving an amazing burger while supporting a local farm - these are some of my favorite things. Pro-Tips: If you're not coming for lunch, from walking distance, you'll want to valet instead of search for parking, you'll do this across the street at Savor. If you're at Klyde Warren park for the afternoon and have already situated your parking, I highly recommend hopping over to give this place a try :) I reservation is a must during peak hours if you're coming anything but solo and sitting at the bar. Price Point: You'll drop $14 on a burger, $20 on an entree and somewhere between $7-$17 on a salad."], ["Angel B.", "LARK On The Park is another restaurant that's located at Klyde Warren Park. My good friend was heading off to Thailand and we decided to do dinner. Upon arrival, the hostess checked us in immediately. I made reservations to avoid any issues. Complimentary valet parking is available right next door. Just make sure you have the waiter or hostess to validate. Luckily, we were seated by the windows and could people watch. At first, it took us some time to warm up to our waiter. Initially, he was moving so fast we could barely ask questions. Come to find out he was working the inside and the patio area. He suggested the scallops and stated we couldn't go wrong.Both of us ordered the scallops and they were okay. It wasn't anything to write home about. Then a birdie whispered to us that brunch is much better. Not to be defeated we ordered dessert. I had the Lemon Coupe and my friend had the Sorbet. Our dessert were very refreshing and a pleasant surprise. We both decided we would come back for brunch. I want to give it another chance. Honestly, the hostesses are nice, the ambiance is great but the food is just ok. Hopefully, brunch will redeem this restaurant for me."], ["Hollie B.", "I had really high hopes for this place! This review could change after my next visit though...First off, the decor and cleanliness of this establishment is beautiful. Simply amazing. The service was great and very attentive.We started with the charcuterie board, about 7-8 different meats. The spicy pepperoni looking ones were the best! Served with warm bread and butter. My mother got the steak and it was pretty good! She raved about the spinach that came with it-I decided to brand out and get the braised oxtail, it was a mistake. The waitress said of all the places you should try it here... It was a lot of effort for little meat. It comes with two portions, they were very fatty and very challenging to maneuver off the bone! It was served with barley (which I cook often) and it was NOWHERE near done. It was as crunchy as dried rice. I couldn't eat more than one bite! I should have gone with my gut and chosen the lamb shank. Lark on the park is raved about, so I will definitely give it another try-"], ["Colleen M.", "Loved this spot. Cocktails were great. Service was friendly and enthusiastic. Not quite \"on\" the park but near enough to stroll over after a bit of people watching. I will definitely return before my visit \u00a0to Dallas is over - the Botanical Mule is not to be missed. An herb-y refreshing cocktail, perfect for the summer! This place is SO worth checking out."], ["John N.", "This review is solely for their drinks and service. Hopefully I'll have the time to try out their food.I had their peaches and cream drink to start off the night because I had a bit of a sweet tooth. Think of the orange dreamsickle ice cream, but not quite. I'm not sure what to think of it but something wasn't on point. Overall an okay drink or maybe your date might like it if she wants a drink with minimal to no alcoholic taste.The bartender was nice in accommodating and taking care of my party of 7. Professional and knowledgeable enough to recommend a beer when I told him what beers I like. I forgot the name of the beer I got, but it was a nice beer and I enjoyed it.As a bonus if you don't know already from the name, this place is across the street from the park. Weather permitting it would probably be nice to sit outside and catch up with friends over some good drinks."], ["Scott L.", "I woke up around 9am.Got a coffee around noon.Gym at 1pmLunch at 3pm.Happy hour at 5pm.Coffee around 7pm.Suddenly it was dinner time.

My friends got the Braised Lamb Shank and Braised Oxtail, and I ordered the Seared Diver Scallops. They were all delicious, but I enjoyed my dish the most. The scallops were seared to perfection and blended very well with the greens and mashed potatoes. I also loved the addition of pine nuts and pomegranate seeds on top. My only complaint was the portion size. I finished that plate clean, and I usually always go home with leftovers. Since it was my friend's birthday, they let her choose a complimentary dessert. After much contemplating, she chose the Butterscotch Panna Cotta. It was superb! The ingredients seemed a little odd, but they worked so well together. A must! Service was on point... our server came back multiple times for our order because we were indecisive, but he was still a good sport and offered great menu recommendations."], ["Mary S.", "I believe a refined diner is one who parks at the bar so that's is usually where I partake my meal. \u00a0The cocktail menu here is one of the best lineups in Dallas. \u00a0I know if Matt is behind the bar slinging my drinks I am in for a treat to sip on. \u00a0Featuring notable modern American cooking, a range of influences and flavors, Lark on the Park hits the Mark!

Kinda $$$"], ["Nickie G.", "Went to Suze with the BF Saturday night. \u00a0This restaurant really wasn't even on my radar so I was definitely surprised when he pulled up. \u00a0It is flanked by an Albertson's...literally between the front and side door of the grocery store.We walked in and I was surprised to see how small it was. \u00a0And that many of the diners were my parents' age and older. \u00a0AND no bar! \u00a0We had reservations but had to wait for about 10 minutes so the lady that was seating people brought us some wine. \u00a0Wine prices were a little steep by the glass...from $8 to $15 for glasses. \u00a0We got a glass of some malbec for $10 (and later bought an entire bottle for $42 which seemed more reasonable). \u00a0Seating is most definitely tight and close beside your other diners so don't go there for a breakup talk! \u00a0They bring out bread with some pesto to dip it in which we polished off in no time. \u00a0For a starter we ordered the sesame lavosh pizza - thin crispy sesame cracker almost with spinach pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella, and parmesan. \u00a0Crunch-a-licious good! \u00a0They also have other choices like a Medeterranean platter with hummus, olives, etc and fried green tomatoes. \u00a0Another table got those and I was jealous immediately. \u00a0Next time I'm getting those.For my entree I got one of the specials of the evening: the center cut pork chop. \u00a0Honestly one of the biggest freakin pork chops I have ever seen - it was almost as big as the plate. \u00a0It came with mashed potatoes, carrots, and the sauce on it was a cherry sauce. \u00a0It was sweet and savory all together and tasted amazing! \u00a0The BF got the baby rack of lamb. \u00a0The lamb was pepper crusted and came with a zucchini feta cake. \u00a0I thought the lamb was great but that zucchini thing was eeeeh not my favorite so I am glad I stuck with the pork chop.The dessert selection didn't really wow me. \u00a0We chose the creme brulee of the day which was cinnamon. \u00a0It was perfect on the top...super crunchy and had that almost burned sugar taste that I loooove and good hint of cinnamon.Must mention that our waiter was awesome! \u00a0He was always on top of our requests and he joked around with us when we did with him. \u00a0Good service, good sense of humor, loved him! \u00a0Overall I'd say the food was really good and the evening was nice. \u00a0I don't know when I'll ever make it back but if someone wanted to go I definitely wouldn't complain!"], ["Daisy C.", "Suze is cozy and intimate, yet they have no problem accommodating large parties. \u00a0My favorite dish is the porcini pappardelle. \u00a0I can't wait to eat the leftovers today.The service is unpretentious and flawless...way better than a lot of so-called 5-star restaurants."], ["Jennifer S.", "What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. \u00a0Last night was my second visit to Suze and it did not disappoint! \u00a0All 4 of our meals were fantastic - short ribs, porcini pasta, almond crusted trout, and duck breast. \u00a0The chocolate gob dessert is to die for too! \u00a0Cozy restaurant with good service."], ["Shane O.", "As a long time visitor to Suze, I returned after a break. As some others here have remarked, the menu seems to be pretty static. Imagine my surprise to see some new additions to menu. As usual we brought our wine (love the BYOB). One of the nice additions to the menu was the Dover sole, w/ shrimp and it was exceptional. I had the usual Trout Almondine, which is always exceptional. The option to add a portion of Foie Gras to any entree for $6 also hits the mark. The fried green tomatoes were the only mediocre flavor of the evening. Service was efficient and unobtrusive. Always a good value, two people $85.00Edit- Fried Green Tomatoes, the issue I had was a slight undercooked, for my taste, while the other 3 diners did not share that opinion."], ["Neena W.", "Don't be fooled by the look from the outside, it's one of the few place in DFW area (at least what i could found) that serves capaccio, and it was a fresh and tasty one.

This place has such an adorable, cozy romantic interior and feel as you walk in. Once you shuffle past the traffic jam of cavorting patrons-in-waiting clustered toe-to-heel along the entrance hallway leading up to the hostess stand. The hostess was sweet and seemed new, and had a chance to seat us about 20 minutes after our reservation time. The food was delicious. Not the best I've had, but pretty great. We had the lavash pizza appetizer, which I eagerly awaited to compare the lavash pizzas I make at home. No shame in white flagging it, this was definitely the best crisply-roasted thin crust lavash pizza I've eaten. For entrees, my date had the steak, and I had their much-acclaimed almond-crusted trout dish. This is where the experience began to shift from meal-centered to lousy service-centered. My date's steak, which he ordered medium rare, came out very obviously medium well-done. I urged him to politely mention it at the first chance, since I knew he'd be tempted to swallow his complaints out of politeness or whatever. However, our waitress didn't seem to be around for a bit, and our chance to mention it only came when a different unfamiliar male server (or kitchen hand? not sure?) came to ask us how we were doing. My date showed him and he agreed that it was not medium rare at all, and rushed it back to the kitchen for a do-over. We figure they either handed us another table's steak, or our female server wrote it down wrong, or just a simple kitchen error. Anyway, he was back in less than two minutes, with a delicious medium-rare (more rare than medium) cut of steak. Our female server missed the whole episode, because the first time we heard from her after getting our plates was a few minutes after my date had already started upon his new steak. When she asked us how everything was, we just replied, \"great.\" I'm sure somebody told her, but she made no mention of it, and nor did we, no big. Nobody's died of inattentiveness. Both the steak and the trout were delicious, though I would have enjoyed some kind of sauce or moist component to my trout dish. The trout itself was moist, but it was served on just a bed of quinoa, and I found myself dipping in my date's mashed potatoes and sauce once or twice to take away the dryness of my bites. That's just a small detail and personal preference, though.The rest of the night, our server seemed to get more unpleasantly inattentive, and we got a general impression that regulars were much more highly-prized here than new patrons. Her tables on both sides of us seemed to be regulars, and she would chat with them at length. After she cleared our plates, we sat there for a good long while wondering whether we would be offered a dessert menu, or if that would just be forgotten and we'd have the check slapped on our table. At one point when my date went to the restroom, I had the perfect view of the server's nook (behind hostess stand), where our server was drinking a glass of wine. My date suggested that that indicated she was probably off for the night, and our table was just in the middle of the awkward handoff to another server. 5-7 minutes later though, we saw her seat a new table of regulars right next to us, as she opened a bottle for them and chatted amicably. Anyway, eventually someone other than her brought us the dessert menu (might have been the same guy who replaced our steak), and we split the creme brulee. It was a bit deep, with less caramelized surface area than I prefer in the ideal creme brulee, but a good standard version nonetheless.Our female server took our finished dessert plate silently, and gave us the check a minute later with the ever-eloquent, \"and heere's this when you're ready.\"Service sucked, food was generally delicious with a few minor kinks, and overall I would definitely recommend becoming a regular here to enjoy the full potential of the greatness Suze has to offer. Had it not been for the service, which I'm sure we just got unlucky with, I would rate this place a 4 stars."], ["Tucker M.", "Suze is among my favorite restaurants in Dallas.

I read the great reviews on Yelp and it definitely lived up to its reputation. The restaurant is tucked in between an Albertson's which gave us a little bit of a \"Are we in the right place?\" feeling. And the restaurant itself is very small. Some might say intimate, but I would have liked to be a little farther away from the table we were seated next to. We made our reservations online and didn't have to wait at all for our table. The olive oil they have to dip the bread in at the beginning of the meal was soooo yummy! It was hard not to fill up on that. We ordered the Kobe beef carpaccio for our appetizer. I enjoyed the salty, oniony taste. The bf ordered lamb chops which he seemed to really enjoy, except for the side dish that came with it (I can't remember what it was), but we both didn't like it. I ordered the almond crusted fish which I had read was good, but I found it rather bleh. It was pretty tasteless. And I didn't like that the skin had been left on the fish. I spent some time peeling it off. So I wouldn't recommend that. For dessert, we shared a creme brulee, which was as good as any other creme brulee I've eaten. Service was great. We seemed to probably be the youngest people in the place, but the place took on a nice quaint feeling as our meal went on. Although I didn't like my entree, I would still want to go back and try their other offerings."], ["Lisa R.", "I've been dying to try this restaurant for years, so decided to take my boyfriend here on Saturday for his birthday dinner. Pulling up, it definitely doesn't look like much sitting in a shopping center with a florist, nail salon, Albertson's, etc... But no worries, the inside is warm and lovely and intimate -- albeit a little small. We had a reservation, so were seated within just a couple minutes in a perfect little corner table. The wines were priced a little high - and I forgot that we could bring our own - but we settled on a lovely Argentinean Malbec and perused the menu. After getting a glimpse at the appetizers at the table next to ours, we decided to start with the Fois Gras. (yeah... we're fancy) Wow. It was deliciously seared and covered with a cherry balsamic sauce that was just heavenly... perhaps a little overpowering for the fois gras' delicate flavor though. We also split a yummy caesar salad and decided on our entrees...I had the almond crusted rainbow trout with artichoke and caper red quinoa -- it was very tasty! The fish was flaky and the quinoa was hearty and delicious. But I have to say that I was suffering from some serious plate envy -- boyfriend ordered the seared filet with garlic whipped potatoes. Oh. My. Goodness. This was the most perfectly cooked melt-in-your-mouth piece of steak I've had in years. It was perfection. \u00a0We also had a little birthday espresso creme brulee that was heavenly -- as creme brulee should be. The service was good, but not quite as attentive as I'd hope in a nicer restaurant -- empty plates were left on the table a little long, etc. Otherwise, we really really loved everything about this place. It was cozy and bustling, but not too noisy or crowded.

I am glad I got to go and my experience was generally positive. Some of the food was \"best ever\" and some was cause for a good head scratching. Case in point - my entree was a 45 day dry aged ribeye. It was a very small $48 steak (the diner at the next table over got one that was about twice the size of mine). Half the steak was tough and overcooked. Boo! The other half was as good and flavorful a steak as I have ever had. Yay! I had fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. The thing about fried green tomatoes is you have to be careful because if they are served too soon, they can be hard. My first one was perfect texture. Yay! The second and third ones - hard as a rock. Boo! The place is very small and looks like a Turkish hookah parlor. You walk through (literally) curtains covering the glass doors at this strip center location. You walk right through the middle of the dining area to get to the hostess stand. You are packed in pretty tight. The service was fine but nothing special. Our waiter seemed unaffected. We had our two 13 year old daughters with us and he seemed put off that we brought kids. One of the girls asked for ranch dressing on her salad and it came with blue cheese (which is some of the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had btw). Our server actually seemed much more accommodating to the couple sitting next to us. He kept asking them how things were and he never asked us. Maybe he hates kids? They were out of cobbler but only after we ordered it (memo to kitchen staff - when you run out of something, tell your waitstaff). We joked as we were walking up to the restaurant that since they were located next to a large supermarket, we didn't have to worry about them running out of food. Ruh Roh - no such ruck on that front! I substituted the cheese tray for dessert instead and would highly suggest they take it off the menu. The cheeses are mundane at best, the tray is overloaded and the accompanying tortilla chips (tortilla chips on a cheese tray???) were senseless. I would give this place a smiley face and half a star but I would go back with a more discerning attitude."], ["Jaime A.", "The food here is absolutely outstanding! We started with the Kobe Beef Carpaccio and as quickly as it was finished it didn't prepare me enough for the delight that was to come as an entr\u00e9e. The Cerven Venison blew me away!! For those of you who are find it cruel and intolerable to eat Bambi, you should relax and realize that there isn't exactly a shortage of deer in the world. From the first bite to the last the gala held in the ballroom that is my mouth had ever taste bud doing the Rumba. My dinner companion was equally impressed with her Sayklay Salad. I'll admit it is very hard to see Suze for anything else but its great food. The neighborhood setting makes it feel less like trendy spot and more like a diner on the corner. Once inside though you definitely don't feel like you're in corner diner. The seating is a bit cramped, but if you are that big chances are you're eating at a buffet style cafeteria and not at Suze. Go with a friend, go with a group, but if you go make sure you go with an open mind and open stomach.Happy dining!"], ["Mark W.", "This is my favorite restaurant in Dallas.

I'm not sure how true to the concept they stay, but it was there. I wasn't super hungry when I went the first time so I ordered the pork sliders which came with a slightly spicy (think sriracha) slaw, the grilled asparagus, and the macaroni and cheese. I was worried the mac & cheese was going to be soupy (pet peeve), but it wasn't. The cheese was pretty mild, and the pasta was maybe slightly under al dente. It is topped with breadcrumbs and a almost too much very salty ham. The asparagus was just slightly under cooked, which beats over cooked in my book. My partner in crime ordered the steak and loved it. The second time we went, I ordered the chicken fried steak. It might have been the mood I was in, but I personally did not enjoy it. The breading had a weird flour feel. I wanted a salad and the waitered suggested a half order of the pear walnut salad. It was really good. A little heavy on the dressing so maybe consider getting the dressing on the side. But a very good salad. Reordered the mac and cheese because apparently New Year''s resolutions don't stick with me. Also went for the banana not pudding in a jar. It was a pretty small serving if you were thinking of splitting it. It was good, not great. Overall, this is really good for a restaurant in a hotel.

I had 3-4 bites of the steak, and from first to last could not overcome the awful metallic, yolky, buttery bearnaise sauce...its suffocating richness infected every bite. Got on the mushroom risotto too, but a small salvaged bite of that was nice. My date was pretty unenthusiastic about it as well, and left quite a bit. - My scallops were cooked deliciously though, and the portion was very large - 3 scallops so sizeable I couldn't even finish. I probably couuuuld have finished, but it was paired with some sort of sweet almond sauce that got too rich and cloying about 2/3 of the way through, and the rich buttery flavor of the scallops became too much as well.We concluded that, were we individuals with a taste for butter and a scorn for subtlety or longevity, we could definitely see the allure of this fine dining experience.

Salum actually has a very romantic ambiance that is great for dining. A very smart use of the space. However, it is located in what looks like a sort of mini strip mall that is a little uninviting.

My opinion is that good service is service that doesn't detract from your enjoyment of your meal; great service adds to it. You waiter makes you feel welcome and seems happy to serve you, even if you are the last table dining. He or she treats his or her job like a craft and excels at it. This is what we got at Salum, and from reading other reviews, it does not sound like an anomaly.The food is very good, but I don't believe it is worthy of its price tag. For the price, I would expect every bite to blow me away, and frankly, it came up short. I think if the prices were a little lower, or the food were a little better, I'd give this place 5 stars. Some notes:1. The entree menu changes every month, so whatever anybody recommends in their reviews probably won't help you decide what to try (save the lamb, which is apparently their one constant). 2.

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for our 2 year anniversary. We made it in a littler earlier than our 9:00 reservations so we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited for our table. First impression was how \"open\" the restaurant is - you can even see into the kitchen. What I didn't like was how noisy it was. I was expecting it to be noisy based on the other reviews, but I suppose I was hoping it would be LESS noisy - definitely not intimate dining. We were brought from the bar to our table by the owner, which I thought was totally cool. I noticed he made his rounds, checking on tables - he even brought a lit birthday cake to our neighboring table. It's not often you see head chef/owners who are so involved with their clientele - kudos to Mr. Salum. Here's the rundown of the meal: Appetizer: Goat Cheese and Garlic w/Bread - This was a nice dish...flavors went well very together Salad: We both had Cesar salad which I was not to impressed with. The Parmesan cheese was fried into a flat block and laid over the romaine, which I didn't care for. Also, not like I am finicky when it comes to anchovies, but I really do prefer them chopped onto my salad...the single dude hanging out amongst the greens just didn't do it for me. Entrees: He had the duck - can't comment on it, but he liked it. I went with the scallops which were the best part of my meal. Dessert: We split the creme brulee - nothing special As much as I wanted to like Salum, I probably won't be back. For what we paid I would rather dine somewhere that I found more enjoyable or try a new dining experience in Dallas since there are so many other options. P.S. I totally did not know the correct pronunciation of the restaurant so I sheepishly asked our waitress (who was very nice by the way) and for those of you wondering it's pronounced just like \"Saloon\" only with an \"m\" ^.^"], ["Maud S.", "My husband and I read the glowing review in Dallas Morning News and decided to try it out. \u00a0It's a very interesting dining room with spectacular lights that Chef Abrams told us changes colors with the season.

The chimichurry sauce was a little heavy for me, but that's just me. Lots of garlic, which I love. \u00a0For the kid, I ordered the same dish without the chimichurry sauce. In addition, the pomme frites which come with the mussles, I had them bring those with his steak. Perfect combo!! They should have it listed on the menu!! \u00a0We both had a five-star dinner! \u00a0Unlike some other's experience, these pomme frites were crispy and done just perfectly! Wonderful flavor!

I had the capresse salad with serrano and the ribeye and my wife had the fried green tomatoes and the ravioli.Both salads were the best of our lunch. The green tomatoes were perfectly cooked and went pretty well with the chipotle mayo that they serve them with. My capresse salad was small but had really good quality mozzarella. The serrano wasn't my favorite (too mild for me) and had only one slice, but still was good.Now, the entrees weren't nearly as good as the salads. My wife's ravioli came with three grilled shrimp that, at first sight looked great, but once you tried them, you could tell they were previously frozen and had that \"fridge\" flavor. The ravioli were okay, but after a while my wife got bored of their creaminess due to the mascarpone and the heavy cream that they used for the sauce. My ribeye was perfectly cooked, however you could tell that it was lower grade meat (probably select or choice) as it didn't have as much marbling as a prime and, thus, lacked some flavor. The lunch wine list has a good selection however they are a little pricey. I'll give it one more try, this time for dinner to make a final assessment.

Finally, to celebrate a special occasion we went and Salum restaurant lived up to all the praises. The restaurant is food focused and not trend focused, and the menu rotates regularly, celebrating what the seasons bring us...not what South American can ship us. The restaurant is rather small, but sophisticated in design. The dinning room was half empty when we arrived at 7pm, but by 8pm the room had a loud roar over it, because by now all seats were filled. The open kitchen is just that...it truly is apart of the dinning room. Salum is a certified Park Cities neighborhood spot...regulars dot the dinning room. Chef Salum was occasionally in the kitchen by mostly he would float from table to table (regulars only) shaking hands and kissing babies. He has a short must see list. Just doing business right? I digress. Our waitress was outstanding right from the start. Friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the menu and wines. As the night went on and the restaurant got busier she disappeared in the weeds, which we can't really blame her for. On to the food. The goat cheese and roasted elephant garlic was wonderful. The milder elephant garlic (compared to regular) spread like butter on the crostinis. Paired with the ice cold acidic goat cheese was a delicious combination. Even though it was a blast furnace outside I could not pass on the soup of the day; a puree of local peas. A full flavored soup with just a hint of mint. The texture was a bit grainy though. For the entrees, my grilled pork T-bone was okay. A cut like this should not be cooked any more than medium and this one was done. Nonetheless it had good flavor but it could have been better. The Gruyere stuffed chayote squash was excellent with its deep rich flavor. The rack of lamb was the highlight on the table. A staple of the restaurant, it never leaves the menu. It was one of the best lamb dishes I have had. Every component was spot on. The dijon truffle crust to the mushroom bread pudding were all delicious. Heavy flavors for the summer but once you have the first bite, then you will know why it's always on the menu. Both the lemon sole and the ahi tuna were reviewed as excellent as well. We could not have such a wonderful dinner and pass on dessert so we ordered the creme brulee of the day (Meyer lemon) and bread pudding. Dessert wasn't the grand finale of the meal. The creme brulee was grainy and flavor was lacking depth. The bread pudding was very good but I personally enjoy a traditional bread pudding with hot bourbon sauce. Overall a wonderful meal. Salum has been around for several years and it still feels like the neighborhood secret. We will definitely be back and next time I'm getting that rack of lamb."], ["Michael G.", "Salum is a great somewhat hidden gem. My wife and I go there often.

The tomatoes were fresh and the breading was nice and tight but the sauce on top was non-descript and I guess I missed the part about the crab cake infusion. If it was on the menu and I missed it, my bad, because I hate crab cakes.We then sat and waited for our entree. And waited. And waited. I was impressed the first time here because they got me in and out quickly. That was not going to be the case this time. Our waiter passed by us several times but not once did he say \"your entrees are almost ready\", \"They're putting the finishing touches on your meal\" or even \"sorry for the delay\". We just waited. During our wait I did overhear a waitress comment to another waiter \"Look how much the anorexic ate\" (speaking about another customer who had just left). Wonder what they said about us after we left? Memo to staff, this is a small place, your voice carries.We finally got our entrees (without apology) and my ribeye was great. The sauce was wonderful and it was well cooked. The french fries (sorry, you can't call these pomme frites) were very soggy. You could swing a cat, hit any burger joint in Dallas and come up with better fries than this. My wife's Nicoise salad with tuna was not good. She felt that the tuna was fishy. It was also bland and flavorless. She was suprised that it came with a cold wedge potato but maybe that is how Nicoise salads are supposed to come. Needless to say, she did not eat much of it. The waiter came and asked if everything was okay. My wife said \"the garlic and goat cheese was great\". She does not like to cause a fuss and this was the nicest way she could address her meal. The waiter said \"was the tuna not good\" and she said \"well, it might have been a little fishy but I'm very particular about my fish\". The waiter said \"Then by all means, we will take it off your bill\". My wife said \"you don't have to do that\". He then went and conversed with the owner (I heard the majority of their conversation..remember, this is a small place) and then the owner came over. He asked \"was there something wrong with your tuna?\" and my wife again said \"I thought it was fishy but maybe it's just me\". The owner said \" we get our fish in daily but if you didn't like it, I would be happy to give you a complimentary dessert\". I am in the customer service business and I was always taught when someone says you gave them a bad product or service, you should apologize profusely and take steps to make things right. If I say the fish is fishy and you say \"Our fish is brought in daily\" you might as well say \"You, Mr. Customer, are wrong!\" You can do it however you want. It's your place. We said no thanks to the free dessert but thanks for offering. When we had finished I put my credit card on the corner of the table (I know this may not be how it's done in high society but dammit, I was ready to go). The waiter made two passes before he brought the bill. He brought the bill, stood it on the table and said \"I'll take care of that when you are ready\" and walked off. Okay, I'll put the credit card that was sitting out on the table for the last five minutes in the little pocket book. After another few minutes he came and got my card. He brought the bill back and guess what - there was the nicoise salad with tuna in all its glory right there on the ticket. Long story short - the ambience, decor and setting is nice, Some of the food is out of this world good. Some of the food is bad but don't tell them that. The service was world class the first time (I should have asked for Kristen) and downright shitty the next. Nice shitty but shitty nonetheless. I now know why there were only two tables occupied at 12:20 on a weekday. Won't be back!"], ["Brian C.", "I recently went to Salum with my wife for Restaurant Week and had one of the best meals I've ever had in Dallas. The appetizers (mussels with pomme frites, goat cheese with elephant garlic) were incredibly rich and flavorful without being overwhelming. My beef tenderloin was an incredibly tender and flavorful cut, and the mild peppercorn sauce was perfect. My wife's entree was just as good, pork and cabbage slow-roasted in apple cider. We will definitely be going back in the winter months when the warmth and richness of Salum's food would best hit the spot!"]], "Gloria's Restaurant": [["Michael B.", "Great Latin fusion restaurant with some of the best salsa in the area and a delicious black bean dip. \u00a0Everything here is good and prices are quite reasonable. \u00a0The meats are well prepared and service is always good.

The family moved up to north Dallas in the early 2000s and have been going to this location since.To be fair, this review is not about the food. It has been and still is 4+ stars. Love the chips, black bean dip, salsa, Salvadoran food, etc.I HATE what they have done to the inside of this restaurant. It was set apart from the franchise Gloria's that have been popping up in Austin, Houston and elsewhere and now it is terribly generic. I am not just a traditionalist. I love modern architecture. In fact, I am an architect. This place is loud, bland (aside from a tacky bar), sterile and it kind of just looks like a slightly edgier high school cafeteria. They clearly just wanted to squeeze in as many plastic crap tables as they could. The ambiance of old hodgepodge Mexican charm that the place used to have is totally gone.Will be eating exclusively on the patio at this location from now on. I just can't.

Great quality Latin cuisine (and yes it is not tex-mex) I tend to gravitate towards the same items all the time: their Queso is great, but I suggest a cup unless it's a larger party. The Chimichanga is delicious but splitting is recommended unless you have a VERY large appetite. The fajitas are also good...not the best I've ever had, but good, as well the chicken soup, Plantains, and the Happy Hour Margaritas!! Let's face it, those things are why most people go and in fact, I think the house Margarita is better than their top shelf. They are pretty strong so drink at your own risk! This location is new and is beautiful inside! Becomes a salsa club at night so that explains the decor. Have never danced there but heard it's fun."], ["Brad S.", "Revisiting Gloria's after so many years away, is kinda like striking up a romance with an old flame, who you never really had that much chemistry with from the start. Back in 2005, when I worked on lower Greenville, that original location was where I lunched with co-workers, good friends and even alone many times. It was always about the black bean dip and strong drinks, more so than the entrees. Flash forward to 2015, on a stormy Thursday in Addison, where I gave my former love another go. It's not so busy that I can't get a table for one quickly, but it's busy enough that the waitstaff is running around with their collective heads cut off. I keep it simple with spinach and cheese enchiladas and a swirl margarita, and in less than 10 minutes my food has arrived - and that's not a good thing. I've been here before (see Meso Maya), but not when a restaurant is this busy. I'm pretty sure that even before I take a bite, something will be off. Of course, the entire dish is barely lukewarm and the spinach is so overcooked you can barely chew it. And then it seems like an eternity before a manager walks by and asks how my meal is: \"Oh, it's fine. I've just pushed my plate to the edge of the table to admire it from afar.\" I could go on forever about the endless parade of servers/managers that attended to me after I pointed out the inadequacy of the food presented, but you've got a life to lead, so I shall spare you. They offered me another dish, I accepted, I washed it down with another stout margarita and made the walk of shame home (I actually drove, but I'm painting a picture here for you, so just go with it! ). I'm not sure what I saw in Gloria's from the start, and I'm not 100% sure why I gave them another chance. Still, we all have that one romance we go back to, no matter how foolish we feel when it's all said and done. Have a little self respect, my friends, and just move on. She/he's just not worth it..."], ["Jolly J.", "Luv Gloria's! Awesome food and even better drinks! Enjoyed my chicken fajita chimichanga smothered in queso!

When I got my bill, mine were $7 each. When I asked why, they told me that they had just changed their prices and menus today. But I looked up their online menu and Happy Hour pricing as I sat there, and it had not been changed. This is deceptive business practices and unacceptable.

And how can I turn down the pea tendrils on top. Sooo good. B tacos- good. But too spicy for me to eat as much of. Note- I'm a lightweight for spicy but my husband really liked them! He loves spicy. Price- not too bad honestly for downtown. So pretty good. Overall- I'll come back! Although- please get valet. It's a madhouse down there trying to find our own parking.

They served complimentary hot crossed buns, which are typically dried out a flavorless, but these were fantastic. I had the eggs benedict which were fine, but the real showcase brunch item is the Hangover. For those in my party who might have missed having a typical Easter buffet, this was the option for them! It had a little bit of everything in between an oversized biscuit. Just to name a few items in this mountain of breakfast heaven, fried chicken, ham, sausage and eggs. It was pretty impressive.For dinner, I've tried many of their dishes and haven't been disappointed. They have signature cocktails and make all of their mixes on site. The restaurant is intimate, on the second floor of an older building. I'm always surprised it's not busier, and I like to think its my little downtown secret.

We tried the meatballs (por-something...don't remember the name), calamari fries, crab nachos and Caprese lollipops. I loved the Lollipops--super refreshing and light. The meatballs were probably the best thing. Very very tasty. The crab nachos I expected to be hot but were cold? They were on plantain chips and had a slew of sauces. Being the priciest thing I expected more. They were just ok. And finally the calamari--free! If you post their hashtag (#thewoolworthdallas) you get a free order of either truffle fries, chips or calamari. The calamari was super good and tender. Drinks were great but pricey. Tried the smoke and water? Smoke and somethin. Really spicy and delicious! The boy had the mule kick which was also good. No copper mug though. At 12 bucks a pop we only had one each then opted for whiskey sours, which were good!We'll definitely be back.

I realize how much servers have to juggle and how stressful that can be, so I don't see any point in being overly hard on them if the meal was good overall.This was NOT the case at The Woolworth, and I will not be coming back here! My friend and I came on a Wednesday night and entered the restaurant only to be greeted by a server with a snobby, arrogant attitude. She made it seem like we were idiots for not making a reservation, though there were many available tables in the restaurant AND it was a weeknight! The night was already off to a rough start.To make matters worse, she was extremely rude when we ordered our food. The menu lists several shared plates as well as main entrees, so my friend and I decided to order two small plates each for our meal since those dishes sounded more appetizing. Not weird, right? Our server (the same one from the front of the restaurant) came back to our table to take our order, though when I ordered my two plates, she told me that my combination was WEIRD. She didn't suggest something else or tell me that I might enjoy a different combination instead, but she laughed and told me that the food I wanted to order was WEIRD.First of all, I am a paying customer and can order anything that I want off the menu. And second of all, it is incredibly rude to make such a comment about someone's food choice. What if I was restricted to those options due to an allergy or illness? I was really offended, and it was hard to enjoy my WEIRD meal after that.The food itself was terribly ordinary, plus that whole exchange left a bad taste in my mouth so perhaps I was influenced by that.

The place is, I would say, little small compared to how much people love them. Valet parking is your best option. One tip: Always make reservations even if it's a weekday. and be warned, you may still have to wait even after making reservations. We once had to wait 30 mins even after making reservation because the folks at our table didn't want to end their chitchat even after paying the bill. I guess people just love the ambiance.Coming to food, their food portions are just enough to justify the price. I am vegetarian so cannot comment on non vegetarian n dishes but all of their vegetarian dishes are great. Surprisingly, their default plain hummus is not as great as their red pepper hummus. I will put the blame on my spice seeking tongue :PService is by default slow and crawls during busy hours. You have to wait to get check even when you can see hordes of people waiting outside to be seated. I believe this has all to do with their limited kitchen capability. I haven't seen it so cant comment on it.Cheese platter was a huge disappointment as there was only one cheese type on the plate with olives, almonds, grapes and pita bread. Not sure if they ran out of cheeses!With all of time and service issues, their food really takes over. Great place. Recommend it when you have lots of time at hand and you are not hungry as a lion :D"], ["Nga N.", "I really wanted to like this place, but I didn't. I gotta say, the waiter we had that night was pretty cool. He was super enthusiast and seemed like he loved his job. Even though our waiter was great, the service ended up kindna slow as they got busier. Anyways to the food, I really like how this place offers tapas style so I can try more stuff. We pretty much got what the waiter recommended. \u00a0The hummus was the best and only thing that was good that night. It was garlic-y, smooth and fine in texture. Most hummus elsewhere is too gritty for me. The chicken, lamb, and falafel were alright at most. The meat was too dry. Even though the lamb wasn't gamey, it lacked the true essence of lamb, and wasn't good. I ended up only eating the hummus with pita bread to get full while neglecting the rest of the food...that's always a bad sign.We had a Groupon, but the $10 for $20 deal via Yelp with a free hummus for a check-in is a much better deal. With a Groupon, it didn't allow the waiter to enter more than one code for the free hummus. I highly recommend getting the Yelp deal, and might return for a second chance because of it."], ["Naser A.", "I love this place beautiful atmosphere, great music & delicious food.

Major plus so we didn't get drenched on our way in.When you walk in the place is very tiny but cozy. The night we went they had live music which was very nice and completely set the mood for the night. Great ambiance! Not a super fancy place but such a nice change to the typical Dallas atmosphere.While we waited for our table we sat at the cozy bar where the man was singing and playing guitar. They have a nice wine selection that isn't overpriced as well has house made sangria. The conversation and entertainment from the man serving us was worth the entire trip there (and we hadn't even eaten yet - If you are a David Bowie fan and like to talk to interesting people ask for Nick)! You will not be disappointed! He is fabulous and has a handle bar mustache, which I love! Our table is ready, so off to the patio we go. You can still hear the music, so it's perfect. There is seating inside but the patio is the way to go. It's covered and was enclosed for weather like we had that night. On to the food. One word...HUMMUS! Oh my! It may be the best I've ever had! Amazing! The owner said it was his mothers recipe (she was there too by the way-so cute) and that she doesn't even like hummus...and didn't even want to put it on the menu. She only agreed if she could modify the recipe. I don't know what she did to it, but she made the most delicious modification ever! Now dinner...how could things get any better! Rewind to us sitting at the bar...I see a plate of lamb chops pass by! I'm a huge fan so I immediately know I want to try some without having seen the menu. My friend and I shared a safron chicken kabob plate and the lamb chops. They did not disappoint! Definitely a must try! I will be back just for those. The chicken came with some veggies, grilled tomato and some fantastic rice! \u00a0We were too full for desert but I can't wait to try some Turkish coffee (almost every table had some) and baklava next time!

That is some very fancy chicken breast. And that is all I have to say about Casa Rubia. I predict an early death for this place, judging from the other reviews it has garnered here on Yelp."], ["Jason S.", "This is labeled as 'Tapas/Small Plates' for a reason: \u00a0They are small plates.If you acknowledge that fact, then 'Casa Rubia' can be a wonderful experience.The servers were friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was fun & hoppin'.They have cocktails & sangrias. \u00a0The wine list is all Spanish, and they have an impressive variety of Sherrys & Ports.All of the dishes were presented very well. \u00a0Photogenic food. \u00a0I love admiring my food, even with all the groans that it incites from my dining buddies who are forced to wait whilst I soak in the captivating sights.By the kitchen, they prominently display a 'PolyScience' 'Anti-Griddle'. \u00a0I am a big fan of modern technology & techniques for cooking, both at restaurants \u00a0& at home. \u00a0Displaying such a fascinating piece of tech so openly, it felt like they were mocking my inability to rationalize such an expensive cooking related purchase. (Curse you fiscal responsibility!) \u00a0It was fun to actually see one in person; 'twas a shame I didn't get to see them actually use it on my visit.Food:-Bunuelos de Pollo: \u00a0These little fried balls were good, but not for the reason I was expecting. \u00a0They are listed as having a chicken, jamon & a cream, yet I couldn't taste any of those. \u00a0It was all cheese to me. \u00a0Therefore, they were fried cheesy goodness instead of fried meaty goodness. \u00a0In the end, goodness is still goodness, but the menu is still misleading.-Boquerones: Anchovies & a potato salad. \u00a0'Twas okay, anchovies were less briny that lesser anchovies, and the potato salad was slightly better than a store bought salad. \u00a0Ultimately, it ended up just feeling like I paid a lot for stuff I could easily buy in any grocery store for much cheaper. -Alcachofas: Crunchy artichoke hearts with aioli and Mojama (cured Tuna). \u00a0I enjoyed the crispiness of the hearts with some Majoma.-Monkfish: \u00a0The fish was very flaky. \u00a0I would almost say cooked too much for my tastes. \u00a0However, it came with a broth and kale to moisten it and make it more palatable. \u00a0A rather fishy dish.-Seats: Awesome dish! Mushrooms & a (I assume) sous-vide egg! \u00a0The mushrooms were great, but that egg was stellar. \u00a0At first, I thought it was a raw egg, but then I took a bite and instantly recognized that texture that I've experience elsewhere. \u00a0Even if it was not made sous-vide, it was the same texture, and therefore still outstanding. \u00a0-Costillos de Cordero: I had just had lamb ribs at 'Hibiscus' a few weeks prior, so inevitably these have to be compared. \u00a0I thought that 'Casa Rubia's rendition was inferior. \u00a0They were still good, and had I prolly would have loved them had they not had such competition on my taste buds. \u00a0These just weren't as flavorful, tender or crunchy as those at 'Hibiscus'.-Pork Spare Ribs: Cured & Tender. \u00a0These were like tender 'Rib Bacon'. \u00a0More tender & flavorful than the lamb ribs. \u00a0The figs on the side were nice and made the dish more presentable, but I can't really say they added much to the flavor profile of the dish.-Pan Calatrava: Genius! I love custard, and this is custard heaven. \u00a0Custard on Custard on Custard! It's just like meetin' a whole Custard Family, and then proceeding to eat 'em all (politely obviously, I must be cordial with the custard family). \u00a0Did you know custard was the first dessert to cross the Atlantic on its own? \u00a0It was also the dessert of choice for the great Roman Emperors. \u00a0Maybe those little factoid aren't true (maybe, I didn't do rigorous fact checking for this review, but it could be true) , however these tidbits display the greatness that custard has achieved. \u00a0My thought process whilst eating went as such: \u00a0\"Mmm, this custard is delicious - \u00a0 and this custard is delicious - and this custard is delicious. \u00a0Mmmm, these custards together are delicious, and these custards together are delicious, and...\" \u00a0Hopefully you get the idea. \u00a0-- \u00a0I like custard; these were good custards. \u00a0I was especially happy with the bread puddin' which was very moist, which is what most bread puddins lack. \u00a0 I understand it is such a simple concept, just combining 3 different desserts, but each element was a good rendition of its respective dish, then combining them just enhanced my enjoyment of 'em. \u00a0I am in love._______________Conclusion:As long as I could ignore the price & portions, 'Casa Rubia' was a delightful experience. \u00a0'Trinity Groves' is pleasant, the atmosphere was fun, the food was presented well & it usually had flavor to match. \u00a0They make use of modern techniques and technologies that really make fancier restaurants stand out to me, and thus makes me more willing to part with my money to witness how professionals utilize 'em.And of course, that Flan+Bread Pudding+Ice Cream Combo just blew my mind."], ["Janet T.", "The food and cocktails were wonderful. \u00a0We think you should certainly try this pace of you have interest in food was a Spanish flair."], ["Kathy L.", "I had an overall good experience at Casa Rubia.

I would have to say that almost every plate was cooked perfectly and we even ordered a few items twice because we wanted more. The short rib was the highlight of the night in my opinion. The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 was because one person out of the group ended up sick later in the night but I think it's because he ate shellfish and he might be allergic. \u00a0Other than that setback the service was great and I would highly recommend coming here for a casual night with friends and a big appetite."], ["Lee R.", "Each of the Trinity Groves restaurants is great in its own way, but Casa Rubia is heads and shoulders above them all in the level of skill from the chef and in terms of service, ambiance, and mixology from the bar.

These discriminating epicures from Seattle were very impressed.Casa Rubia is now my favorite special occasion restaurant in all of Dallas.After dinner, we walked around to the north side of Trinity Groves for dessert at the more casual Cake Bar *and* to assemble a box of take-back-to-Seattle jewels from Kate Weiser Chocolates.Following that, we walked up the walkway to the Continental Pedestrian Bridge for incredible views of the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and Dallas skyline. \u00a0Dozens of visitors and families of all demographics were out having great fun and seeing the view.NOTE: I do wish Trinity Groves would make it easier to *get* to the walkway. \u00a0Between sudden stops of sidewalks and massive parking signs blocking sidewalks (hello, ADA?) you have to tromp through grass on step into traffic to get from the restaurants to the east side of Gulden.

Prices are for \"entree-level\" dishes but sizes are tapas-style (too small). Repeat. Sample sizes too small (for the price). Dishes are unnecessarily intricate and cocky, focused too much on \"cool combinations\" and flashy presentations, rather than on authentic Spanish taste.

We went on a weeknight right before closing, and it was not crowded. Our waitress was quite friendly and helpful and informed us about the tapas style servings. We knew that going in, and having been at other tapas restaurants, we thought we knew what to expect. We saw the prices and we figured we were in for an unforgettable, gourmet treat.Not quite. We ordered the mussles with roe. About a dozen were presented cold, in a row out of their shells. The citrus flavors were not exactly my favorite. I guess I prefer my mussles served in the shell and warm.The corn meal and chorizo balls were not bad, but they seemed like glorified hush puppies. The scallops served were cooked perfectly, but the bf and I were not sold on the herby flavor used. The saving graces of the meal were my bf's Estrella, my red wine, and the octopus - pulpo a la plancha. The pulpo was delicious. It had a nice grilled flavor, and the accompanying sauce was flavorful and complimented the octopus well.Be aware, the serving size really are small, (no s**t, Sherlock, I know), but I wasn't expecting tiny.Overall, the food was underwhelming. I don't mind paying for amazing food, even if it is a small portion. But the fact that one out of four of our tapas was mind-blowing delicious makes me not want to go back. \u00a0I'll stick to tapas happy hours with pretty good food that won't break the bank. \u00a0Props to our waitress for being friendly and helpful, though."], ["Jackie K.", "A good evening...The rabbit pate was delicious, as were the pork cheek and shrimp entrees. \u00a0The jamon iberico and chocolate dessert were the standouts, though--delightful! \u00a0And I found it really fun and different that they also included a sherry menu instead of only a normal wine/cocktail menu. \u00a0Food was definitely good but nothing that makes me want to go back immediately.And...it's always a big no-no in my book for a restaurant to take reservations and yet require guests to wait, even when they arrive on time. \u00a0We arrived on time for our reservations and had to wait 20 minutes...not a great start to the evening. \u00a0It would have been nice for the restaurant to at least provide free drinks to enjoy while it made us wait."], ["Matt R.", "Casa Rubia \u00a0might be the best new restaurant in Dallas.

Who ordered the grated Unicorn horn and Loch Ness Monster ribs? Who requested that Jesus come down and go back in the kitchen to make the wine and come out for autographs and selfies? There was not a single dish that I tasted that WOW'ed me. There was absolutely no remarkable plate that I will rave to all my friends about or come back and ask for. To boot, not a wine or cocktail in the house could be paired with the dishes to pull them out of the weird culinary purgatory they rested in and unlock their potential for excellence. Nothing was gross or bad in the least; everything was cooked appropriately so that tenderness or texture was superb... but overall it was just a MEH. There was no \"... MMMMM. Oh my god that was amazing...\" arising from anyone at our table... just a bunch of head nodding and the occasional \"it's good.\"Complex experiences were minimal (despite choosing a bunch of items listed on the \"Complex\" end of the menu) and quite frankly I think it's a bit pathetic that places like this exist in a city where I can pay less than $50 for a pretty spectacular and satisfying plate of outstanding cuisine that sings and dances on your palette (I told our host that we should have gone to Gemma on Henderson instead). Mind you, there was a lot (of options, not food in general) brought to our table... Octopus, Lamb, Duck, Squid Ink, Clams, Mussels, Pork Cheeks, the daily Paella (which was good, but takes 40 minutes to come out, yet packs less of a punch to your tastebuds than a side of rice from a random Taqueria... YIKES), a couple charcuterie boards, and all three desserts that CR offers, among other items. While each choice was naturally covered in various sauces, glazes, or complementing carbs, they may as well have been cooked and served as is. There was barely a flavor distinction between the lamb, the duck, and the pork cheeks from a dish composition standpoint. Every dish was like a model that is amazing and otherworldly when she's alone or in a room of average people, but once she's in a lineup of other models she blends right in and becomes a regular ol' wallflower. The lesson here is that pretty food that lacks individual personality is awfully depressing, but especially at these prices. \u00a0The waiter was good and the service seemed worthy of the ambience... but the taste of the food was so gah-damn uninspiring that I have to wonder if I have to have some specially trained tongue that can taste something unique, something wonderful, something flavorful, some sort of X-factor to justify the expense under the pretension and window dressing.Needless to say, I won't return.

We got pitchers for the table, which after review, weren't worth it. Don't get me wrong, they were cheap and the sparking was definitely better tasting and stronger.

They sell it by the pitcher if you choose to share! For food their bacon wrapped dates are absolutely amazing! Sweet with a nice meaty flavor. The garlic shrimp is awesome! If you're on a date beware! They are heavy in garlic flavoring and coated with olive oil but oh so good! The clams and muscles are amazing. They are served in a garlic sauce with chorizo and potato chunks! So much flavor and spice. Honestly I haven't had anything new here I didn't like. Prices are reasonable and portions fitting to the price. I'm one who doesn't like picking just one dish and sticking to it so the idea of tapas is ideal for someone like me who wants lots of options to pick at. The service here is wonderful.

Perhaps it's better during happy hour, but the normal prices for this food and drink aren't quite worth my while. I'd rather spend money across the street...at any of those places. The pomegranate sangria is funny. It has nothing to do with pomegranates and tastes like apple juice. $6.50 is not worth that glass. The caprihini is strong. Better. We got clams and mussels dish, shrimp and crab croquettes and some toasted mushroom feta ravioli. All solid, but nothing wow-ing. The ravioli is fried basically and had a lot of feta inside. The shrimp and crab croquette reminded me of an asian shrimp ball. And the clams and mussels were flavorless (but not fishy which is good). It's a bit of a joke though bc you get about 10 of a combined amount of clams and mussels...for $10. Whereas I could go to the porch and get a pound of awesome mussels for $13. \u00a0In reality, mussels cost $2 a pound, so perhaps that is expensive...It's not about the money, it's about the value!

This situation makes things awkward because there is no waiting area, literally, & the bar area is SO SMALL (which is where we ended up waiting). Then 2 other people arrive after us saying they have a party reservation as well BUT THEY GET SEATED! I was obviously outraged about this because they had our exact same situation but were given an exception. From the bar I see all of this, so I return to the hostess station to inquiry about it. I am told that they are part of our party & that we can join them. I did not think they were part of our party (they were pretty old) but I didn't know all the attendees, so I go over there & nope; they were not part of our party. In fact, I find out that they didn't even have a reservation and were just given our table. Back to the hostess station, and the host tries to scramble for words. She tells me she will take care of it. After waiting some time they put together a table right next to the walk way & makes for a terrible location as people keep rushing behind us and we're VERY CRAMPED through dinner. Back to the bar, the bartenders were very nice. They make 2 special drinks every weekend and have them pre-made. I wanted to sample one before ordering a glass of it and they allowed me to, so I was very pleased. The drink had a good flavor, but could have used more alcohol. The lamb chops we ordered (3 very small pieces) ended up being $28, which is completely ridiculous for a tapas place. It wasn't that it was bad, but it just wasn't that good either; pretty bland without sauce. We also ordered the cured meats platter, but they charged extra for bread/pitas (unusual). There was a surprising amount of seafood dishes on the menu too. Some of the guests we went with only ordered 1 plate and even shared because of the expensive price (I presume), so it wasn't a normal tapas experience.

Wrong. Beer was good. Mushroom soup was wonderful, but - as with almost all their dishes it seems - they rely on extreme amounts of cream and butter and salt to make anything taste so wonderful. The creamed spinach is another example. Creamed spinach is, well, creamed, but this was more like spinached cream rather than creamed spinach. Couldn't handle more than a few bites. At least the cream and butter in the mushroom soup made that dish irresistible, but the creamed spinach was just obnoxious. Service was a little awkward. We had two waiters who didn't seems to really know the menu. And they forgot our order of the vegetable sides. The petit filet was very petit and the carrots that accompanied the filet were even more meager. Chicken was suspiciously buttery as well. I'm not sure what they did to that meat, but I'll probably have clogged arteries for the next month. Chocolate cake dessert was wonderful and so was the lemon meringue pie, but brace yourself for that first very tart bite. Compared to other top-dollar restaurants, this menu was uninspiring. Nothing left me excited or intrigued. Plain menu selections and ingredients. This was by far my least favorite restaurant week dinner (and most expensive) compared to Boulevardier (absolutely mind-blowing), Central 214 (also wonderful), and The Grape (go get their 41-year-old mushroom soup recipe instead!). Overall, dinner fail. After my awful cocktail and review of the menu, I wanted to leave. Mushroom soup and view and a local Ft Worth lager held me through... Do not go."], ["Debra T.", "I've only been to SER twice. The first time I was here was for a very special Valentine's Day Dinner. I was blown away by SER and could not stop raving about it to my friends. My boyfriend and I ordered the Steak Tar Tar, Half Maine Lobster which was fried in tempura w/ ginger aioli, Mac & Cheese, 45-Day Aged Prime Ribeye and the Berkshire Pork Chop. For dessert we had the Pistachio Layer Cake w/ morello cherry compote, and milk crumb. All in all, everything was spectacular. The Steak Tar Tar was bland, but the Half Maine Lobster made up for it. We devoured it within seconds. The waiters were extremely accommodating and friendly. It was such an amazing experience.The second time around at SER, some friends and I came to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. It was that delicious that we agreed to come back for such a special occasion. My boyfriend ordered the 45-Day Aged Prime Ribeye again and I ordered the Day Boat Sea Scallops. Some new things my friends and I ordered were the Hudson Valley Foie Gras Sliders, Brussels Sprouts and House-Made Tator Tots. The second experience at SER unfortunately wasn't as great as the first. The waiters forgot one of my friend's order of House-Made Tator Tots (But damn those tator tots were the best tator tots I have ever had!). My boyfriend also mentioned that his 45-Day Aged Prime Ribeye did not taste extraordinary like it did originally.The view of Dallas however, was beautiful. The restaurant is very spacious and clean and has a posh ambiance. Not sure what is going on behind the scenes at SER, but I hope they figure out a way to be consistent. There is so much potential here (Hence the 4 stars) and if I do come back to SER, I expect to be amazed like I was the first time."], ["M K.", "Went to SER last night and enjoyed the 27th floor view of Dallas but was unimpressed with the food. I got the lobster bisque which was good but a bit toosalty and the pork chop. The chop was not tender and lacked flavor. The molten chocolate cake was quite good however. For the high price, I think you can do better."], ["Bobby L.", "When someone says, \"meet at the 27th floor of the Hilton,\" you know it's turning out to be a good night. \u00a0That's pretty much how last Saturday went. \u00a0Ended up at Ser with a few friends and let me tell you, I was more than pleased. \u00a0The night started off with a nice glass of Macallan 18. \u00a0Should have asked for it straight because the bartender loaded the glass up with about 78 cubes of ice. \u00a0We were promptly seated and my awe of the city scape that was visible from the restaurant quickly turned to excitement when I perused the menu. \u00a0I knew I had to start with the foie gras sliders. \u00a0Foie gras with a burger bun? Madness? \u00a0No my friends. \u00a0Genius. \u00a0It was perfectly cooked bun and piece of liver. \u00a0The symphony of warm and cool, crunchy and creamy, filled my mouth. \u00a0I took the smallest bites I could of these already small sliders JUST so I could make the experience last. \u00a0The oysters were ordered by another person in the party and one was stolen by your's truly. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0Between appetizer and our entree the good times kept coming. \u00a0Wine and some more scotch. \u00a0I ordered the filet medium rare topped with some lobster. \u00a0This was the only disappointing thing about the night. \u00a0The lobster was a bit rubbery and I really didn't care for it. \u00a0The filet however was well cooked and quality piece of meat. \u00a0I had the opportunity to try some of the wagyu spinalis, wagyu rib, and the lamb chops. \u00a0The wagyu rib was wild. \u00a01 rib, large and in charge. \u00a0Seeing that one rib made me realize how large cows actually are. \u00a0The other two dishes were just as good but I can't think of enough synonyms and for the sake of making this review sound a little less repetitive, I'll leave it at that.So my only critiques are, if you're thinking about adding on the half lobster, I wouldn't. \u00a0Add on the foie gras instead. \u00a0If you like your scotch watered down, don't specify how you want it, you'll get more than enough melted ice to suit your wants. \u00a0The End.By the way, the espresso was nice a nice way to end the meal."], ["Chris L.", "Great views, service and food!

The steak just melts in your mouth and the salmon was perfectly cooked. The creamed spinach, French fries, onion peels, and wedge salad were all amazing. My only dislike was for the condiments. They make the ketchup and ranch there and both had some strange elements to them that just weirded my taste buds out. Don't try to fancify ketchup or ranch, people! That's American staples you're tampering with! ;)"]], "Si Tapas": [["Margaret B.", "So the thing is, there is no way you can taste the majority of their extensive menu in one night. \u00a0Not even with unlimited funds and unlimited time. \u00a0It's not going to happen. \u00a0I want, no, I NEED to go back to try some more.Between my mom, dad and sister we made a pretty impressive dent. \u00a0There is no way I'll use the Spanish names since most of you won't care but we had the Orange Salad with Carrot and Fresh Mint, Salted Chicken in Beer Sauce, Sauteed Artichokes in Lemon Cream Sauce, House Mussels, Baby Eels in Garlic Sauce, Mixed Croquettes, and the Pork Tenderloin on Caramelized Onions.My biggest revelation? \u00a0Baby Eels taste like noodles. \u00a0Who knew? \u00a0Safe yet delicious orders are always going to be your mussels and croquettes. \u00a0The artichokes and pork tenderloin was also lightly spiced and tasty. \u00a0The salted chicken got assistance from some capers but was otherwise a little on the bland side. \u00a0The Orange and Carrot salad is a nice refreshing side.I gotta go back. \u00a0Parking is pretty sucky, since it's non existent but I think I can brave it to go back and try more."], ["Kevin M.", "After trying a few drinking establishments in Dallas, it was time to move onto the meal portion of this exploration. With this in mind, I stumbled upon Si Tapas when scrolling through Yelp.Located in a residential neighborhood, Si Taps blends in with the surrounding homes. The inside actually looks like a large house that was converted into a restaurant. Very unique in that sense. The food though? Not so unique.To start, the happy hour prices here are phenomenal. You can do some serious damage here without breaking the bank if you arrive before 7pm. With that said, we ordered a bunch of tapas plates and dug in.The Patas Bravas were pretty good, but not amazing. We also got an order their \"bread with toppings\" plate, which was just ok. The toppings were a mix of different meats, which was interesting, but not necessarily great in taste. The chicken wings with garlic was pretty good, but again, nothing special... Noticing a theme?The peak of the meal was the garlic shrimp. Truly a delicious dish and that was done perfectly. Then came the low pint of the meal which consisted of two dishes: Chicken in wine sauce and chicken in beer sauce. Both dishes were really bland and overall not enjoyable.I'd say this overall experience was average from a food standpoint. Service was ok and the venue itself was really cool and unique. However, I'll definitely dine elsewhere in the future."], ["Maria C.", "Food is still good but please do not expect good service (they USED to have really good service...).We ordered jam\u00f3n serrano instead we got some type of chorizo.

Not even apology received..."], ["Cat N.", "I had a pleasant early dinner here, just wish service was up to par. I waited 15 minutes before the waiter came back to take my order. They never came back to check on me and I had to go get them to give me a check. The waiter was actually no where to be found. I still tipped, silly me. What was I thinking? Food was good and unique but not the service. I had the pick three bruschetta with toppings: smoked salmon, some type of sausage that tasted like pepperoni, and some type of cheese. I also got the marinated baby shark and the clams in garlic white wine sauce. I liked everything I got. The best was the clams in garlic white wine sauce. The marinated baby shark was deep fried. It was a good thing it was fried because if it was raw or in some other type of ways, I think I might have a hard time trying it."], ["Janice C.", "I highly recommend this place! The restaurant is set in a nice little neighborhood, in what I believe is a renovated house. We arrived at 6:45 and was sad to find that last call for happy hour was 5 mins ago. While I thought it was weird, every restaurant has their own policy. We ordered the mixed croquettes, peppered tuna and fried pork belly. I can easily say that the croquettes were my favorite! While a cod croquette can easily be off putting bc of the name, it was quite tasty! The corn inside the croquettes added a certain sweetness and lightness to such a typically heavy food. The ham one was very tasty as well. I would really recommend getting the mixed, bc I didn't not like one over the other. The ham has a stronger taste and is more savory while the cod is lighter and sweet. The fried pork belly was deep friend and served with a chocolate sauce. The pork belly was cooked well, and tasted okay. The fried pork belly was my bf's favorite but I'm not a fan of fatty meats so I didn't think much of it.... The peppered tuna was tasty and cooked well, and I would have no problems ordering it again, but I would rather try something else on my next visit! The food was excellent, the service was a little cold but I was fine with it. And I would definitely be coming again despite the horrible parking situation!

If you've never been over to this neck of the woods, it is so cute and different and has a very nice neighborhood vibe.As for the food - for three girls we ordered five tapas and cocktails and it was just enough food for the three of us to be full but not too full. If you've never had tapas before, they are spanish small plates meant to be shared. All of them were very delicious. We ordered the Tortilla Espanola which is one of my favorite dishes and reminds me of a meal my grandma used to make. It is the size of a quiche and is sort of like a potato and egg omelette. We also ordered the cauliflower, scallops, and the starter toast with spread. Everything was delicious.I will definitely be coming back here! Great spot!"], ["Tiffany S.", "Spanish cuisine is my absolute favorite. I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain for 5 weeks and developed a deep appreciation for the food and culture in my short time there. Dallas has a shortage of Spanish restaurants and of the few that it has, Si Tapas is the clear winner. I stumbled upon Si Tapas about 5 years ago after a brief internet search and was surprised by their happy hour prices. A friend and I ventured out to Dallas to try it out and were amazed at the high quality of food. Since that initial visit, I have been back at least 3 or 4 additional times. It's that good.Fast forward to last week and I am still a fan. I was in the neighborhood so I decided to stop by for an impromptu tapas meal. When I walked in I was greeted and given an option of seats. I opted to sit downstairs at a small table. I made up my mind relatively quickly and ordered a sangria to start off with and a few tapas plates (chicken with garlic, Spanish omelette, and calimari). The winner of my dinner was the sangria and the tortilla espa\u00f1ola (Spanish omelette made of potatoes). I ordered the tinto de verano, a summer drink, but I swear it was a calimocho because it was darker than normal and didn't taste right. My server was very kind and switched my drink for another tinto de verano. Is this the best Spanish food I've ever tasted? No, not by a long shot. But it is an authentic Spanish dining experience and the best Spanish food I've had in Dallas. For me, it's all about the nostalgia of eating Spanish food. Tip: Go during happy hour. The small plates (tapas) are $3 each, drinks are cheap, and you can sample different things to discover what you like. Also, order a pitcher of Agua de Valencia and thank me later."], ["Jennie J.", "Si Tapas was such a lovely place! \u00a0I was immediately impressed with the charm of this little restaurant in an old house. \u00a0The layout of the restaurant is great. \u00a0I absolutely loved the atmosphere here!Their food was also very good. \u00a0I tried the lamb chops, seared tuna and fried okra. \u00a0The lamb chops and okra were excellent!!! Definitely try those. \u00a0I can't wait to go back here again sometime! \u00a0Only negative is that is is rather loud indoors due to the small space and the valet was full when I got there so I had to go elsewhere to valet and had to pay extra for that. \u00a0This was on a Saturday night, by the way."], ["Danielle S.", "We found this place by looking for paella in Dallas. First it was confusing because there is nowhere to park. You have to valet and apparently there was not valet offered on a Wednesday night so we had to valet down the street. Valet in the area ranges from $7-$15. There was not a hostess inside but a waitress greeted us and I'm not sure what she said after we let her know there were three in our party. Another guy walked up and sat us though. We sat for about ten minutes before anyone greeted us. Then a server took our order for drinks. Took about ten minutes to get a martini and a mojito. It appeared the servers were having to make all their own drinks. We then ordered one of the mix and match 4 meat and cheese plates. We went with zamorano and manchego cheeses, with cured chorizo and salami. It was served with a fruit pate, grapes, walnuts and died fig. Could have used mustard and something pickled rather than everything so sweet, but the meats and cheese were mouth watering. For dinner we shared the seafood paella. It was everything I had hoped and more. I've had equally tasty paella but none this loaded with seafood. There was meat in every bite; calamari, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp! So so so GOOD. Everything tasted fresh and the saffron rice was cooked perfectly, not fishy or mushy. I think the prices were really good considering the quality and amount of food. I can't wait to go back and try more tapas. I would absolutely give it five starts but the service was very slow to start, they didn't start music until we were halfway done with dinner so instead of calming music for our first half of dinner, it just felt like really loud conversations all around us and it was too dark at the beginning of dinner service. Not until around 8:30 did they start lighting the candles on the tables so it just felt like we were sitting in the dark for half the meal. Maybe they were down a server and/or bartender. I will definitely go back, maybe in the fall since they had a great patio."], ["Meena N.", "Ohh. Emmm. Geeee. Where do I start? As a goodbye happy hour for my student assistant, we decided to hit this place upon recommendation of another colleague. Parking looked spotty, so we opted for valet. Open arriving, I was hesitant. How are they fitting a kitchen and tables in this small space... And then we walked outside. An oasis in uptown! I haven't seen that much grass in uptown.... Ever?! Our table ordered the following: fried calamari, the Spanish potato omelette, garlic shrimp, olives, chicken in garlic (nom nom), and fried okra (we ARE in the South). And that was just the first round :) after sampling the above, we recorded okra, chicken and shrimp. Why not? They were $3/plate!We also ordered three pitchers of Echegaray ($12/each). Having never known about this drink, I found it very refreshing/light on a humid Dallas afternoon, and quite strong! Quick comment about service: super fast! As soon as we ordered, plates of food started emerging from the kitchen. Our waiter (a manager.. Don't remember his name) was also super friendly.

First off, it's something different in Uptown, so I'm up for returning partially for the variety they offer amidst the bars and bar food of Uptown.The artichokes were a hit, as was the sauce for the saffron chicken; however the chicken was overcooked a bit to the point of chewiness. We also had the manchego cheese (can't go wrong with cheese) and the tomato marmalade with goat cheese. The latter we were unimpressed with since the tomato marmalade was spread on thick, and there was very very little cheese. The result was that the sweet marmalade was too much for the little toasts, and there wasn't any saltiness from the cheese to balance it out. Finally, we got the carafe of sangria which I'd recommend. It's on the sweet side but very tasty. Our neighbors also had great things to say about the croquettes, and cauliflower au gratin so those are on my list for next time."], ["Ashley A.", "The patio is so beautiful and romantic. You can enjoy your food in a lush green alcove in the middle of a lovely section of uptown. This secret garden is surrounded by very nice buildings on all sides and in view of the skyline to the left. We had a lovely evening, and a fantastic meal. The food is delicious. Tapas are romantic by nature, because they are meant to be shared. To start we ordered the Tuna with cracked black pepper in olive oil, and brussel sprouts in garlic. Next we had octopus with potatoes, the quail, pork and blue cheese on toasted bread, the sole, and dijon sirloin. Service was fast and friendly. My favorite dishes were the sole and the dijon sirloin. The sole had an incredible flavor combination. It was topped with ham and almonds and a perfect crunchy layer. The Dijon Sirlon was beautifully robust and rare. Sinewy and delicious. My least \u00a0favorite dish of the evening was the quail, which was very over cooked. I wouldn't recommend it. Stop re-killing the bird. It's already dead. The olive oil in a lot of the dishes was so delicious. We were scraping our plates with the crunchy bread to absorb the flavors. Ask for the dessert menu, we adored the creme brulee with white chocolate shavings. I had the red wine cake, but the creme brulee was better by far. You'll have a very romantic evening on the prettiest patio in Dallas!Definitely drink Txomin Etxaniz txakoli with your meal. It's scrumptious Spanish white that pairs beautifully with tapas.

The pallea was delicious. It is enough to share for 2-3 people and definitely worth the price. They pack on the seafood so you get almost more than what you pay for. It's great quality and full of flavor. Finally, the sangria. I've been trying to find good sangria in dallas and most are sugary Americanized versions of the Spanish drink.

The dish that did stand out, however, was the seafood paella. It was a good size and we shared it between three adults. I loved that it came with plenty of mussels, clams, and shrimp.

Bottom line, everything is great and I would recommend it to anyone."]], "Cafe Madrid": [], "Abacus": [], "The Grape Restaurant": [["Sarah S.", "My Sunday morning binge eating started out with the complimentary banana nut bread muffins (?) which I found very dry and too nutty. \u00a0This sort of scared me for the meals to come. \u00a0We also ordered a Cinnamon Pull-Apart for the table (warm from the oven with pecans and caramel), which I also found disappointing and too nutty. \u00a0It was also very sticky, but not in a delicious cinnamon roll way, but in a stuck in your teeth like peanut butter on the roof of a dogs mouth way. \u00a0Now I was really dreading what was to come.For my meal, I got The Haystack (roesti potatoes, grilled tomatoes, half-scrambled eggs, Muenster, avocado, and sriracha chili sauce). \u00a0When the meal came out, my hindsight kicked in, as I do not like spicy sauces and forgot to ask for them to leave it off. \u00a0Besides the few bites of my mouth burning, I mostly successfully avoided the heat and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. \u00a0Avocados make everything better. \u00a0Although the picture is not exceptionally mouth-watering, the combination of eggs, potatoes, and avocado is a breakfast delight.We also ordered a Classic Cheeseburger to share between the four of us (grilled 10 oz fresh ground patty, homemade peppered bacon, Vermont white cheddar, with homemade frites on the side). \u00a0It is literally one of the best hamburgers I have ever had in my life. \u00a0100% it beats Fred's in FW, Maple and Motor, and any hamburger joint outside of Dallas or Texas. \u00a0The patty was huge, yet so fluffy. \u00a0I generally do not enjoy cheese, but the whole package of patty, bacon, and cheese just worked. \u00a0I really wish I got it as my meal and will be going back shortly to devour the whole thing myself. \u00a0Additionally, the fries were so addicting, which created the perfect compliment to the delicious hamburger.Overall, I left The Grape very pleased and feeling like 50 bucks (not quite 100 bucks due to my excessive drinking the day before, but halfway there). \u00a0It is definitely worth a stop in, just make sure they are serving the hamburger the day you go!"], ["Greg L.", "Have been to the grape for dinner years ago but took the family for Sun brunch. We all had burgers. Needless to say they were all inhaled within minutes. Will be back."], ["Tanya A.", "The Grape was far below expectations. Had the triple cream mezzalune for apps, including salmon tartare and cheese plate. I was looking forward to the mezzalune since morels are in season; it sounded good but the watercress and spinach pasta just didn't seem to pair well, especially with the morels. The salads seems to come out of a package; nothing special. While the entrees were good, I don't think anyone said they were amazing, and definitely not worth coming back for. The dessert (rhubarb and chocolate terrine) were also subpar. I was looking forward to those, and they didn't excite me.Service was slow towards the end, but the restaurant itself was cute (nice patio). I've heard good things about brunch and mushroom soup, so maybe I have to come back for that? We'll see though!"], ["D. F.", "The Grape is an amazing restaurant. \u00a0The ambiance and most importantly food is not anything short of outstanding. I have been here 3 times for brunch, and not once have I been disappointed. Their hushpuppies are mouthwatering. Their waffle is scrumptious, and the famous burger lives up to all the rave. Every time I have shown up on Sunday, there is a line out the door. So reservations are your best bet.You will not be disappointed."], ["T.J. B.", "Just go. It's small and gives off a great date night vibe. Valet is right by the door. Exceptional service and food."], ["Lissa B.", "My family has lived in the Dallas area for over 35 years, so all of us were willing to try my mom's recommendation. (Granted, apparently The Grape was just a wine tasting bar last time my mom had been there for a meal). We made reservations for Sunday brunch and dove right in!Parking in complimentary valet for The Grape, thankfully, but it was awkward figuring out the parking when I first pulled up. Literally drove by three times, trying to pull in. We were there before the restaurant doors even opened. For brunch, I tried the fried polenta with sriracha (appetizer) and the pull apart cinnamon rounds (appetizer), which were both what you would expect and nothing exceptional. The frittata featured a queso fresco on top that ended up sticking to my stomach and keeping me from even eating half of my plate, but damn it was good. Note on service: I've taken Spanish for over seven years, so I was pretty surprised to hear a couple waiters saying loudly to \"give the witch some coffee,\" while talking about the table next to us. In Dallas, even white people speak Spanish, so this kept bothering me, given how loudly it was said. Multiple times. Good (not great) food. Much money. Drink menu looked good (didn't try any). Weird experience with servers."], ["Megan M.", "I love The Grape. \u00a0Until my most recent visit, I'd only been for a couple of happy hours but those hours were spent truly happy. \u00a0The cozy atmosphere of the bar, the friendly staff and the fantastic happy hour menu (all at very affordable prices) make me feel like a little girl playing dress-up in her mother's closet.Imagine how excited I was to finally be able to try the best burger in town at Sunday brunch. \u00a0Father's Day couldn't have been spent on a better reservation.Except the burger didn't live up to the hype. \u00a0Everything else about the Grape is still outstanding. \u00a0We had a wonderful lunch on the patio thanks to a rare June cold front and I enjoyed the hell out of our $22 splurge on a carafe of mimosas. \u00a0But that burger...oh, that burger. \u00a0While I can see where they were going, I just don't enjoy having a burger pee all over my plate. \u00a0I hadn't even taken more than a couple of bites and the bottom of my bun was completely soggy. \u00a0Ew.On the flip-side, the hand-cut fries were amazing and the burger toppings were about as high class as high class gets.I love The Grape. \u00a05 stars for happy hour and 3 stars for brunch. \u00a0I'm sure my next brunch visit will bring The Grape to a solid 5 stars overall."], ["Steve C.", "I've had the mushroom soup and it is to die for. The classic cheeseburger is equally awesome. Steak on a bum without the cutting. Cooked medium with melted cheese and crisp bacon, this is a savory delight with sauce and crunch! The bum is soft and crisp and the meaty tomato paired with crisp sweet pickles and butter lettuce tops off the burger. The fries are good. The price point is higher than Maple and Motor but you won't be disappointed. Sit at the bar and get a drink from Kara."], ["Cat A.", "I am a huge burger fan, and I came here specifically to get this burger that everyone raves about. I do agree, it is a damn good burger! it's huge and i took half home, which is great considering it was a $15 plate. The fries are something I hadn't really heard about, but my husband I I both just LOVED them!! Perfect balance of crispy and soft. \u00a0I also ordered their coffee which was surprisingly good too. \u00a0Came out piping hot with a very good flavor, not too bitter or anything. We sat at the bar countertop to avoid waiting for a table and had a great time chatting it up with the very friendly female bartender while watching the Steelers game. \u00a0I never had a problem getting coffee refills even though on one of the waiters had to handle it. \u00a0We also got an order of the sausage and sweet cornmeal hush puppies, and they were delicious and addicting. I was trying to save room for my burger, but couldn't eat just one. \u00a0One star gone because my husband also ordered the wounded yellow bird and was not at all impressed with the cocktail. They have complimentary valet, so as long as you aren't in a huge rush, parking is easy as well. \u00a0And remember that Sundays they close at 2pm and re-open at 5pm I believe."], ["Lauren T.", "I have been meaning to try this cute little spot out for YEARS. I finally got around to it after a random morning at church; the weather was crappy, but we braved the arctic blast for a shot at landing brunch. First of all, this restaurant is very small, so it is usually pretty packed and they are big on reservations (yes, for brunch too). We didn't have any reservations, but we got seated quickly (I'm pretty sure it was solely due to the awful weather). The food was delicious! I ordered the Country Style Frittata with a side of grits. The grits were pretty mind-blowing! Both were tasty items, and my guest thoroughly enjoyed their meal as well. Apparently, the \"Hay Stack\" is one of the most popular choices on the brunch menu, because I ooo'ed and ahh'ed over it when I saw a waitress set one on the table next to us (I was sad I didn't order it... I'll know next time!), and literally every table around us ordered one as well. It looks like an ahi tuna tower of breakfast items... I cannot wait to taste it for myself.The waitress was super friendly, and the service was great. Something about this restaurant reminds me of Toulouse on Knox Street (maybe it is the quaint, European cafe vibe). I've heard The Grape has an amazing burger as well as a deliciously upscale dinner menu, so this is a solid choice for just about any time of day. I will definitely be back!"], ["Reena D.", "I've had The Grape bookmarked for so long and finally came here for Sunday Brunch. \u00a0 You definitely need to make a reservation or you'll be waiting for a long time. \u00a0I started with a cappacino which was really good.For the table:We ordered the fried polenta cheese fritters and the sausage &sweet cornmeal hushpuppies. \u00a0The polenta cheese was so good. The sriracha complimented it. \u00a0The fritters were not too rich either. \u00a0My favorite was the hushpuppies. \u00a0There were big pieces of sausage in each hushpuppies. \u00a0This has to be one of the best hushpuppies I've had especially when there is sausage in them! YummyEntrees:My friend and I decided to split the fried chicken biscuit. \u00a0 \u00a0Who doesn't like crispy fried chicken, cheddar cheese & honey butter on a jalapeno cheddar biscuit??? \u00a0I thought the biscuit was good but felt like the fried chicken was a little on the dry side. \u00a0Next time I may ask for more honey butter or a sauce to go with the chicken. \u00a0I thought it was decent though.We ended our meal with the pull apart cinnamon roll. \u00a0It had way too much honey on it and it was so sweet. \u00a0I could barely finish my bite. \u00a0Talk about sugar overload! Ha! \u00a0We did enjoy our time here and can't wait to go back and try other items off the menu including dinner items too!"], ["J G.", "Came today specifically to get their burger. First their bloody is solid. Lots of horseradish which I love. The Courtney salad is also solid. Just the right amount and priced right at $5. As far as the burger goes, it lives up to the hype. I love that it's a big bastard at 10ozs unlike these new places and their BS 6oz patty. F that! I'm a man. I'm 45. I want a big burger.I'd happily give 5 stars but their fries are soggy. Not even approaching crispy."], ["Jennifer S.", "I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Grape before, but here goes! \u00a0I met a friend here for dinner tonight and had a wonderful experience. \u00a0The Grape has been voted the Most Romantic restaurant in Dallas many times over and you can see why once you step inside...it is oozing with charm. \u00a0The happy hour is killer - 1/2 price glasses of wine, $2 beer and reduced price appetizers.I enjoyed the poached pear salad with blue cheese to start and then enjoyed a half portion of the mustard crusted salmon with potatoes and cabbage. \u00a0It was absolutely delicious!To sum it up...great atmosphere, great service and great food - a winning combination!"], ["Steve V.", "This is the blue chip recruit of restaurants in the Dallas area. You know you are going to get something solid every time. We were here in early January and they were still serving their December menu. This was fine with me since the menu had some appetizing options.I had a reservation and we were seated on the left side of the quaint restaurant at a small table for 2 against a wall. We started off with the gnocchi and lamb tartine. The lamb tartine had way more meat than I thought it would have, but the sauce was a bit overwhelming and runny. Still a great dish though. The gnocchi was soft and melted in your mouth.For my entree, I had the shortrib. Again, this dish was a good amount of food and the meat was so soft. There was a large amount of pure fat though, which I was not a fan of. The flavors were bold and enticing. The chard that it came with was great, and the farro a bit al dente, just the way it should be.The service was a perfect blend of attentiveness, but not overbearing. There is complimentary valet as well."], ["Lana H.", "This was the place my ex first took my parents when he was meeting them. It seems like you have to valet park! It is a tiny place but the food is spectacular. Id recommend dressing up! The portions are smaller and so are the tables, but it very delicious and worth it!

Having been before, for our 1st wedding anniversary, we decided to spend the night at a familiar and quality restaurant instead of trying one of the many new options in the area. Unfortunately, we should have let the first meal here be the only meal here. Tonight was beyond disappointing. We waited 30 minutes after finishing each coarse before the following was delivered to the table. The mushroom soup came out as expected, which is a relief because that is one of their signature dishes. Although we are still wondering why it took 30 minutes for something that should be prepared ahead of time. My husband had the cheeseburger and was fairly pleased. I had the very sad looking/burned on the bottom/ very small for 28 dollars lasagna, which I sent back to the kitchen without a replacement. We were not asked if we wanted dessert or coffee, never received a visit from the manager, and had to flag down our waitress for the check. As we walked by about 10 staff on the way to the exit, not one asked us how our meal was, including the manager. Sadly, we will probably not be returning despite the exemplary service we received on our first visit."]], "Nazca Kitchen": [], "Stephan Pyles": []}
