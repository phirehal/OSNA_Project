The Mister and I had drinks, he had beer and I had the ginger mint mojito. My drink was nice, it was more ginger than mint which was alright with me! We started out with spicy edemame and steamed potstickers. The edemame was great but they basically just threw powdered spices on the top of the pile (to make them spicy) so unless you're down to mix up the bowl to really get the spices spread out, I would stick to just regular edemame. Can't complain too much since the edemame was free with my Yelp checkin, so it was still a win in my book. The potstickers though? THEY WERE SO MEATY!!! These were the MEATIEST potstickers I've ever had. They were just DELIGHTFUL! Not soggy nor over-crisp on the panned side. Everything on the menu sounded great and I couldn't figure out what I wanted which is usually a great sign. Our server was nice and suggested the lo mein. Figured it was a safe bet even though I usually don't go that basic. I got the chicken and pork lo mein and it was wonderful! The noodles were perfectly cooked (not slimy, not overdone) and the meats and veggies were cut in pretty big pieces which I like as it's easier on your chopsticks. The veggies were crisp and the flavor was fresh. Chinese food can sometimes have an odd, lingering, smell or flavor but none of that was happenin. The Mister got the Mandarin sweet and sour chicken and shrimp. The meats and veggies were awesomely cut with the veggies being crisp just like my meal but the FRUITS TOOK THE CAKE! Not only was there pineapple but there was mango and dare I say it....lychee....yes folks...there was lychee....add the sweet and sour sauce and the fact that it had JUST the right batter to meat ratio on the crust and this dish was the perfect sweet and sour. For dessert we had the fried vanilla. It was GREEEAAAT. A ball of vanilla ice cream fried with a light batter. The outside isn't really sweet but it's nice. A big drizzle of chocolate on the outside. It's enough for 3 people to have a good taste. So if you can handle a dessert, it's worth a try. Given everything tasted really light and fresh so nothing seemed too processed. Great decor and vibe inside the restaurant. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I'll be back for sure!"], ["Kat D.", "What an awesome dining experience! \u00a0Loved the food, but had great service by DAVID (who is actually new there). \u00a0 I've become a regular since December...recently moving to Dallas. \u00a0Prior to my recent lunch visit, I felt it wasn't memorable...food tasty...but service experience was not memorable. \u00a0 DAVID, however, and the GM during the shift last \u00a0Friday midday made it a visit to remember. \u00a0With a visiting cousin from Florida, they were helpful also in giving ideas for things to and places to go while in Dallas. \u00a0THE MUSIC IS ALWAYS PERFECT in this place - clean - tasty - ....you know you're in a good place when the SOUP is memorable. \u00a0 GO. \u00a0I promise you will not be disappointed!"], ["Elisa T.", "The food is good but most of the time I do delivery and they are always missing items or sauce.

Absolute nonsense. I could see if they were at the entrance to the garage and saving me a few steps (still absurd and ridiculous still, but at least you'd be giving the appearance of making my life easier), but this was not the case.

Another great dish to try: Sweet and Sour with your choice of shrimp, beef, chicken, etc. Or how about the General Tsos Chicken?

Betty's is the reason I LOVE Dallas night life! Open until the early morning hours and the best part.... THEY DELIVER until the early morning hours. This is my FAVORITE spot! Highly recommended!!!"], ["Renee E.", "Let me start off this review by saying this is the first EVER negative review I have posted on yelp. Having worked in the customer service industry for most of my life, I usually take a situation that doesn't go quite right and chalk it up to a bad night or bad circumstances; however in this case I could not just let it go. The reason I am compelled to write this review simply boils down to customer service and expecting the same level which I have delivered on many different occasions. So on Sunday of this Labor Day weekend 2015 we placed an order for delivery while visiting a friend of ours. We had placed orders in the past with Betty's Best and had great experiences so thought nothing of ordering as well as recommending this place as we have to friends many times before. On this night however, after placing our order at 10:23 PM, when an hour past and we hadn't received our order in the time promised, we called to locate it. \u00a0From this point on, over the course of several calls, we were told several times it would be delivering shortly (which was never the case), I was hung up on 3 times, told I was being unreasonable, at one point I was handed off to a customer to I guess convince me we were being unreasonable?, was at one point asked \"who else can you call for delivery food at this time?\" (See below for other options), asked if I just wanted to cancel my order, and finally told I should live in a better area for their delivery. \u00a0When we finally got the food......over 2 hours after initially ordering it.....I not only got better customer service and understanding from their delivery person, but it was at that point I learned that the person I had been talking to for over an hour was the OWNER, John! I am sorry, but where is your pride? And why not acknowledge that earlier when we asked to speak to a manager or owner? \u00a0After tipping their delivery person 20% of the total amount of the bill and not penalize them for John's rudeness, I called back to inform John I would not be signing the receipt for the charge given our interactions over the past hour. He finally and reluctantly told me our charge would be refunded, but still showed no remorse for his behavior or apologized for ANY of the interactions that had transpired.Let me say this, as I told John on our final interaction on the phone, this entire situation could have been made right by simply delivering ANY customer service. When you are short staffed and overloaded on a busy holiday weekend, simply tell people that up front. I have dealt with many establishments that do that and it works quite well. If you make a mistake on quoting a time when you can fulfill an order, simply apologize and people will generally understand, BUT under no circumstances should you EVER hang up on a customer. \u00a0John didn't deliver any customer service though. Instead he resorted to defensiveness, blame and excuses.......and at the final interaction when I told him I had hopes he would at some point adjust his behavior so I didn't feel the need to write this review......I got indifference.It is sad because they really do make quite good food, but the level of customer service that their owner delivered is inexcusable and not worth ones time.So in response to John's question on who else you can call for late night food I say this.........for pizza try Greenville Ave pizza Co. and for Asian Cuisine try Sunrise Asian Cuisine. This business is not the only late night game in town and certainly isn't worth the rudeness you may receive for an order you could have made yourself in the same amount or less time. Save yourself the grief in dealing with John, who clearly doesn't care to maintain any customer relationships."], ["Kaia V.", "Why don't the chinese places near me velvet their chicken!?

As minutes passed, we watched her bring them a number of things as she hurried from the kitchen (right past us) to their table over and over. We tried to flag her down after about 15 minutes of watching her do so, and she gave us the \"just a minute\" hand gesture from afar. Alas, her focus from the table of what I can only assume was royalty could not be broken, so we tossed some cash for our drinks on the table and went next door to Better Burger (yum).

I like a lot of other places for various reasons (close to home, good soup, etc.)...but this place has them all beat hands down. Food is always hot, fresh and delivered with a smile. Everything tastes right. Egg drop soup is addictive and has real flavor...unlike other places that literally taste like an egg dropped in water. No amount of soy sauce or chili oil can save bad egg drop soup. Thankfully, Ming's is awesome. Egg roll is always hot. I like a meat egg roll, but the one that comes with the combo is good. Moo goo gai pan is a 5-star dish for me. Chicken and veggies in white sauce is boring to most...and a lot of places don't get it right. Ming's does.

It was super delicious. Other main plates we tried were good but I couldn't stay away from the sesame chicken goodness! Two things:1- They don't deliver and sometimes it's a hassle to drive in this area (traffic and all) but it's so worth it.2- They are incredibly nice! The first time we ordered online and got a phone call regarding our order of Green Tea Ice Cream. It wasn't their season for ice cream and they kept apologizing profusely to not give it to us. The bf upon return with our yumminess immediately went, \"I can't explain it, but they were so incredibly nice I want to go back tomorrow.\" That's always a huge plus with us!Try the wontons, orange peel chicken, etc but 1st try the sesame chicken!"], ["Tony S.", "Combination Fried Rice was really good. \u00a0Egg rolls need some help."], ["Harvey A.", "Been going to Ming Place China Bistro for a few years now.

Chinese food usually equates to awesome levels of spicy that make my tongue dance. I am sad to report the Hunan chicken and tofu stir fry with veggies was not to my standard of spice. The chicken was tender, the tofu was fried just right, and the veggies were on par. However, it left a lingering of bland on my taste buds. Although, the hot and spicy soup was delish! It was thick and full of peppery flavors, but the entree lacked that umph. You know? Needless to say, the food is not bad or poor quality, just not to my liking of Chinese fare. The service, on the other hand was beyond friendly and fast. I will definitely return mainly because the service was impeccable. They even bring you a complimentary egg roll once you sit down. This establishment serves well as a speedy lunch destination. Therefore, I am eager to explore their dinner options as the food might have better quality.

So I told my husband to pick a chicken dish and our table neighbors suggested General Tso's. We ordered the crab rangoons, the soup and the General Tsos and shared everything. The crab rangoons were some of the best I've ever had - hot and fresh. The soup was very light and the vegetables were still crisp and not cooked to mush. The general tso's was the 2nd best I've ever had - lightly breaded and stayed crisp without an overload of sauce.But the real highlight is the service here, friendliest chinese restaurant I've ever been to.

The sauce that comes with the dumplings isn't just soy.. it's soy + vinegar + one or two other ingredients. This place is good if you know what authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food looks like and tastes like. It compares to some of the better Chinatown hot spots in NYC.

They ran out and were completely dry of soup broth. HUGE BUMMER. And especially because we drove quite the distance just for their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. We made do though -- ordered their Spicy Wontons and Dan Dan Noodles (sans broth).The BAD -- maybe because it was towards the end of the night, and they were closing within the half hour, but the Spicy Wontons were quite salty. It didn't help that the Spicy Sauce was doused all over the wontons, saturating it completely. Edible, but you'd have to take sips of water in between bites.Although great for food-styling photos, the bowls that the Dan Dan Noodles were served in, were terrible for actual usage and consumption. Because the ground beef and sauces were overflowing on top and the noodles were packed tightly underneath, it was difficult to get a bite in with both noodles and toppings, without spilling all the goodies everywhere. And especially hard to mix everything together for the perfect meat:noodle bite. Suggestion -- serve noodles/noodle soups in larger/wider brim bowls.

Like I said, the noodles themselves were fresh, but the topping (\"Wok-toasted peanuts and garlic, house chili oil, and hints of sesame and soy + cilantro\" according to their website) was just plopped on top. Really hard to spread around in the carton. Consequently, I ate a lot of the noodles plain, and when I got to the bottom of the carton there was a lot of topping just sitting there, uneaten. - These noodles are SPICY! I realize now that on their website they warn you of this by calling the dish \"Spicy Garlic Peanut Noodles\", but that's not on the menu at the restaurant. Usually I don't have a problem with spicy, but this dish made my eyes water and my nose run. I probably would have ordered a different noodle dish if there had been any other vegetarian option, but this one was my only choice if I wanted noodles. - My meal isn't sitting very well in my stomach. In fact, as time has passed, I've felt progressively worse. Greasy, unsettled, vaguely ill. The eating experience itself was adequate, it's the aftermath I'm having trouble with.

It was close to closing time so I quickly ran up to the window and ordered. I simply got an order of the edamame and tofu dumplings and a bottled water. Trust me, the one order of dumplings were pretty filling, they give 10 of them. Keep that in mind so you won't over order. It was only a 10 minute wait, so it wasn't that bad, plus I was being entertained by the guy making noodles in the window. It's hard to look away from the tossing and spinning of the noodles that he makes look so easy. Once I got the dumplings, I cracked open the plastic container. A lot of steam and the wonderful aroma of the dumplings poured out of the plastic case. The dumplings were done perfectly! The flavorful, creamy inside of the sealed dumpling matched perfectly with the salty dipping sauce! So good! Writing this review is making me want more. I killed them and went on my way.

The people working there were super nice and even though there were a ton of people there on a saturday night, the wait to get the food was less than 15 minutes.The only real downside was that I felt like there were too many noodles in relation to the amount of meat.

However, I would suggest installing misting fans or something of that nature. We did stay and enjoy our noodles here though, but sat at one of the stools in front of their kitchen/cashier area. The broth was savory and flavorful, and not overly spicy. The noodles were al dente, while the beef was very well seasoned.

Yesterday, we had lunch there and it was an utter disappointment. We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the soup dumplings which seemed to be two of the more popular dishes. As other yelpers stated, the seating was not so great but that is ok if the food were to make up for it. We got our food and it didn't look very appetizing from the start. The soup dumplings were hard and almost looked if they had been sitting out for a couple hours. The consistency was terrible and when I bit into them to try and drink the soup out before I ate the dumpling the soup would pour out everywhere. As for the spicy beef noodle soup, it was extremely bland and I \u00a0not sure why they call it a soup because it was pretty much a cup full of some kind of chili oil. The beef on the soup was extremely tough and chewy. For being such a \"hole in the wall\" I would expect much higher quality food than what I was served yesterday.

Sure the prices are alright and the setup is cute, but the food fails to deliver.Today, I asked if the Dandan noodles could be made with less spice, and the curt response was \"it's not that spicy.\" \u00a0I only asked because I found it too spicy last time. They could've said, \"sorry, it's a premixed broth,\" or something to that effect -- in which case I'd order something different. After all, it's my own fault that I can't handle spice like a good Asian. As it turned out, the lady at the counter was right - it's not that spicy this time, thanks to their inconsistency. But it was excessively oily, and I now feel nauseated although I didn't slurp on the broth. The dandan noodles themselves have a consistent texture, but the width is quite varied, with the thinner strands resembling the beef noodles. The spicy beef noodle soup is \"alright\" according to my various companions. The soup dumplings have a good amount of broth, but are very salty.I understand they're trying to appeal to an Americanized palate with the heavy-handed ingredients, but it doesn't fly in my books."], ["Heather S.", "In my mouth.. right now.. Monkey King is just amazing.. granted I'm not a hardcore dumpling snob- but I enjoy them \u00a0just the same. I've been here 5 times now and they are if anything consistent regardless of how busy they are or what time of day. I agree with my fellow yelpers about the huge awkward tip screen when you pay with a CC. There is no service beyond taking your order at the window and screaming your name from the same tiny hole in the building when its ready for pick up. So the food- I cant agree with some of my yelp homies, ive had some pretty foul dumplings and I really flove MKNC and everything on the menu. Where else in DFW can you see a lovely, strong-armed tall drink of water flinging noodles around with that intensely focused face? uh, nowhere.. I could just sit and stare at him roll that dough the whole time, and I usually do, but not in a creepy way.. haha. But for real try to wiggle into the window and watch the magic- this dude is hardcore and you know the noodle are fresh off his manly floured hands cause he drops them straight into the boiling pot when he's done.The chili wontons are by far my favorite- there is always the perfect amount of saucy heaven on top of the generously bulging dumplings. I am also of fan of the spicy beef noodle soup- but I ask for an extra side of the chili sauce and cilantro to pump it up. The Chicken soup is bland to me- but again you can doctor it up and its very satisfying on a rainy day. I'm not a big fan of the soup dumplings only cause I'm so uncoordinated when it comes to the bite and slurp technique and I usually have to commit and stuff the whole thing in my mouth- not cute on a date, ladies.

It's a culinary show and a great way to pass the time while waiting for your food. The process is fascinating and gives you a real sense of the artistry in the kitchen. Side walk tables and a roof top \"dinning room\" for seating. MKN is not a high church dinning experience. No one will unfold your napkin and put it on your lap for you, but if you care about food this is a great place. You will wait in line. The seating will be ad hoc.

My friend noted, it was faster than fast food.Based on the demand, they might have come up with an efficient way of getting people their food, but I feel like it probably jeopardized the quality of the food itself. It's no wonder they got it to me so quickly. It was cold, and the sauce/gravy was not mixed in the noodles. It seems like it was thrown on top of the noodles and defrosted not so well. Had they just had a wok nearby and heated it up/mixed it up before handing it me, I'm sure it would have tasted way better. None the less, I liked the flavors. I got the spicy garlic peanut noodles. My friend got the beef noodles, and she said the beef was terrible. It was chewy, not melt in your mouth, and did not taste fresh.

The egg rolls reminded me of something I might pick up in the frozen section of the grocery - no flavor. The hot and sour soup was not up to par and was the worst of the selections we tried.

The food here is authentic, though the menu features a bit of a mix of northern and southern Chinese food. The highlights of the yearly Chinese dinner I attend here include the duck, the spicy cabbage banchan-type premeal dish, the fish soup, and separately, the dessert soup that contains little rice dumplings and is just the most delicious and one of the strangest things I've ever found myself squee over. As for their other offerings - the whole fish always seems to be mostly skin. Not sure where the fish meat goes but it is hard to locate on the platter! I'm not a fan of their sliced rice patty dish as I find it too chewy. Their spicy squid is quite nice, however, and tastes the way you'd expect any spicy squid dish at any Asian restaurant to taste. The whitefish in what seems to be a cornstarch sauce, and the baby shrimp in a similar sauce were both tasty and cooked perfectly. The fish soup is super light on the fish but the pieces you do find are again perfectly tender and well seasoned. If you like pork, they also make a pork shank that the rest of the folks in my group devoured like wild animals, so it must have been remarkably delicious.

Some of the meat dishes (e.g., soup dumplings, lobster) were overly seasoned. If you have any food restrictions, things will be a challenge. \u00a0I was invited to a special event attended by ~50 people. I'll start with the positives. The banquet menu was expertly crafted, and included some dishes that were exclusive to the celebration of the Lunar New Year. The execution, from start to finish, was extremely impressive for such a small restaurant (~10 tables, 4 of which we occupied). The service, overall, was accommodating enough.But it seemed as though the supply could not keep up with the demand. The food came at irregular intervals (overlapping dishes to start, then 10-15 min in between), and without any announcement of what ingredients each dish comprised (despite the servers being forewarned of food restrictions). As an omnivore, I jokingly (but actually, seriously) took the role of taste-tester for some of my dinner companions, as it was sometimes difficult to visually distinguish vegetable from meat, and red meat from poultry. Who would have thought that a huge pot of soup, brimming with green veggies, would contain chunks of fish lurking beneath its surface? Some of the dishes, including the soup dumplings and most of the seafood, were overly seasoned. The lobster tasted as though its meat had been pulled out of the shell before being soaked in brine, tossed with pepper, and put back in. As the night went on, the service began coming apart at the seams. The intervals between courses stretched longer and longer. Glasses of water were only served to a select few. A long awaited wine glass eventually came in the form of a styrofoam cup... which was amusing at best. But there were some food highlights. The veggie dishes were actually the most pleasing. The tofu skin, wrapped around mushrooms or cut into strips and served with edamame, was savory and delicious. The flavors of the bok-choy served with shiitake mushrooms, sauteed green beans, and eggplant in garlic sauce were very well-balanced. Looking at the seafood, the fish filet in sauce, though salty, was enjoyable in small amounts. Finally, a glutinous rice dessert, served with pockets of red bean paste in its center, was near unforgettable (though probably exclusive to the New Year event). It is unfortunate that I could not review this restaurant in its \"normal\" setting. \u00a0Heck, it's harsh to criticize a restaurant that was willing to bravely take on an order for 50 people, and came up just a little short. But if the banquet experience was any indication, this place is worth a visit if you're in the area... but not worth a long trip."], ["P H.", "Very disappointing. \u00a0We ordered the large wonton soup. The wontons were mushy in the middle. The Kung Pau Shrimp and Shrimp in garlic sauce tasted exactly the same. The only difference was one had peanuts in it. The fried pot stickers were very greasy.

This year we had 40+ people around 3 banquet tables. This restaurant isn't very big at all, so the three 12-14 seaters dominated more than 2/3 of the dining room space. The service is top-notch, 5 stars for sure. We had about 15 courses preplanned by the restaurant, brought out one after the other, with all three tables getting the dishes at the same time, hot and fresh. If this little chinese restaurant felt the heat, us diners were none the wiser. they satisfied the incessant requests for water, forks, tea, more water, another plate, hot sauce from 40 people with patience and speed. the owners seem to have been doing a lot of the heavy lifting themselves serving and cooking, which i enjoy seeing at chinese restaurants because it's personal.The food was above average (but not really 5 stars) and for the big part, authentic and traditional. Keep in mind that the pre fixe chinese new year dinner is NOT their typical menu offerings. I think it is more authentically chinese and better prepared than their regular menu. Standouts were the xiao long bao (soup dumplings...probably best in dallas that i've had) that were beautifully plump, filled to the brim with soup, and importantly not leaky, and had tasty meat filling. Also good were the green beans, peking duck, assorted small cold dishes, and the tang yuan dessert (sweet gluttonous rice soup). However, there were several other dishes that i felt like could easily be replicated in an americanized chinese restaurant. For this dinner service, it was $28/per plus tax...which is a fantastic price for the amount and variety of delicious food that we had. We had a lot of leftovers too!

I ordered the edamame and this was good because it wasn't too salty. I also order the pork roll and this was good...full of pork! The pot stickers were also pretty good.

I was the only person there Saturday at lunch. Should've \u00a0taken the hint. Scallion pancake was average to poor. XLB dumplings tasted frozen or store bought...yuck. Take my advice: go to Royal China where they are expensive ($8.50) but made by hand right in front of you. Finished with panfried mixed noodles. No flavor to any ingredient. Chewy beef. Ate like 5 bites. Only bright spot: hearing waitress take a phone order and say about 8 times \"the suicide pork comes with rice\". Suicide pork?? Damn. Why did I eat here? \u00a0I can only hope it was her accent on sweet and sour pork, but she repeated it so many times that's the only thing I enjoyed in the whole meal. Not coming back."], ["Christina K.", "I came here searching for xiao long bao's (juicy steamed dumplings), although we also ordered green onion pancakes (meh, not impressed). I was pretty impressed by their XLBs: good size, decent amount of soup filling, black vinegar/ginger dipping sauce and 2 choices of fillings - pork and crab powder. I personally would stick to the pork ones since i'm not a fan of crab powder. Don't expect great service...we slurped our water for a good 20 minutes before someone finally got up from hand making their crab rangoons to refill our glasses. However, the prices are decent and their food is very authentic."], ["Yaofu Z.", "The food taste pretty authentic, but tend to be on the salty side. The owner and the waitress seemed to argue over something. And the owners' kids seem to play around in the dining area as well. It is definitely quite casual and family feel. It also seems somewhat empty during meal time."], ["Josh M.", "A very quiet family owned restaurant located right behind spring creek BBQ. The one thing I really recommend is the juicy dumplings located under the appetizer list. Usually when you order soup dumplings in Dallas they come out as wet dumplings. I ate:Green onion pancakeBraised pork ribPork soup dumplingsPeking style pork minced noodleAll of these dishes were pretty good but the dumplings were the main event"], ["M. L.", "Food is mediocre and service is terrible. The only time I would order from them is when nothing else is available."], ["Jessica N.", "Such a great family owned spot for Chinese! They carry both an \"American Chinese\" menu as well as more of an authentic menu.Easy website for online ordering. Offer both delivery, done in and pickup. Would recommend the xiao long bao!!!!"], ["Steven R.", "I was caught between 3-4 stars. I went with three after careful deliberation.The food was pretty fine. It's the same basic Chinese menu as many places but was still delicious. I had beef in a garlic sauce of some sort (spicy). My friend had some strange raw vegetable sort of meal in soup. It was very authentic looking.The menus are very vague about what things are, and some of the wait staff is not so good with their English. I think it would have been good for someone to advise us more on what we were getting. We did ask what something was but got a pretty vague explanation.There was a little boy sitting near us by himself - I believe the child of someone who worked there - playing a video game on his phone or some handheld console that we found somewhat annoying. I wish someone had asked him to turn the volume lower.Service was fast and responsive.I would probably dine here again and feel okay about recommending it. Ultimately a good experience."], ["Katrina M.", "This place has very authentic Chinese food for relatively cheap. The language barrier made communicating with the server a little difficult, which would probably deter most people, but talking to his wife later was quite enjoyable. If you don't know what to get, I suggest trying some of the dishes I ordered:Shanghai style pork - bite size chunks of tender pork braised in a very tasty brown sauce Stewed pork with taro - slices of pork belly braised with slices of taro and steamed bok choi. The meat melts in your mouth. It was a near perfect dish. Soup dumplings aka xiu long bao - the wrapper was a little thick for my liking, but the flavor made these my favorite (compared to Kiran Court and Monkey king noodle company- sorry guys!). Pretty cheap too, if I remember correctly. Drunken chicken - a cold dish of boiled chicken soaked overnight in rice wine and broth. I make this quite a bit at home. While this one was good, it was a little too salty for my liking. I would probably still order it again.. Black bean spicy fish - I don't know if that is the correct name which is unfortunate because I will try to get this again. It was my favorite dish of the night, and definitely rivals the spicy fish dishes I've had at royal sichuan and sichuanese cuisine. We only ordered it after asking our waiter's wife about her favorite fish dish. Saut\u00e9ed pea vines - again not sure about the name. This was delicious and the veggies tasted very fresh. Shanghai style duck - served cold. Also too salty for my liking. This is the only dish that I would not get again. Overall, I highly recommend this place. Definitely a hidden gem in Dallas. It wasn't the best Chinese food ever but it was very authentic, good, and cheap. Service will be fine if you just say the letter-number codes for each dish."], ["\u5b87\u4f73", "so delicious!!! like it! will come second time!the environment is so good!!! so many kinds of dishes\uff01the cheesecake is so good as well as the soup!"], ["Denise H.", "Not even 1 star!

Service was good."], ["A S.", "Man and I were doing a roaming food tour of Dallas when we stopped in at Shanghai exclusively for their xiao long bao! They offered two types of the juicy soup dumplings (on the appetizer menu): pork and pork with crab. We ordered the pork and sat back for a 15 minute wait during a very slow mid-afternoon. At this point, all we could do was the inspect the scenery: typical Chinese restaurant with about 20 plastic covered tables and booths, posters of Asian cities plastered on the wall, and golden cat and buddha greeters at the door. No flatscreen tv mentioned in earlier Yelps, but there was a laptop sitting at a back table blaring Asian sports and variety shows. The menu itself seemed Americanized, with descriptions fully rendered in English, but there were definitely some authentic gems listed. Too bad, we were on our one-dish tour...but we are definitely intrigued enough to come back for more.The xiao long bao of course were great! I loved that these were big, super juicy and well seasoned. I've had Royal China and Jeng Chi and found theirs anemic and dry, so I have to say these are the best I've tried yet.Service was admittedly slow-paced (after all, we had ordered only one make-from-scratch appetizer split between two people) and typical of other ethnic Chinese places we usually haunt, meaning we're no strangers to neglect. Despite that the staff were sitting down to their own lunch by the time we polished off the XLB, they still managed to take care of our refills and our check.We'll be back."], ["Melissa R.", "Honestly the food is good but to be honest the customer service is terrible.

They did not get our order correct. They were 0 for 2 getting the entr\u00e9es right (the chicken was OK and the beef was not edible).

Ever. \u00a0I have literally NEVER had such a bad experience. \u00a0Yeah, it's \"authentic Chinese\" which means \"authentic service\" which means crappy service, and I'm used to that. \u00a0But this service was in a league of its own: absolutely jaw-droppingly bad.First of all, we walk in and aren't even greeted for a good five minutes. \u00a0Finally, someone takes us to a table. \u00a0We're seated RIGHT under a TV that's so deafeningly loud that we can't even hear each other. \u00a0We ask them to turn it down, and it takes them about 30 minutes to finally get around to doing that.Two tables are seated immediately after us -- one couple and one group of five. \u00a0Both of those tables are delivered menus and drinks first. \u00a0Both of those tables are delivered their food first. \u00a0Once we finally get our menus, the waitress returns in under a minute to take our order. \u00a0When we tell her we're not ready (hello!!), she ignores us for the next fifteen minutes. \u00a0We finally order and proceed to watch those two other tables get their food -- including some of the same dishes we ordered, like soup dumplings -- before us.Another 30 minutes goes by without a single waitress stopping to ask how we're doing or refill our drinks or anything. \u00a0We never got a single refill the entire evening, and considering how salty all the dishes were, I was feeling almost dehydrated by the end of the meal. \u00a0Oh, and my boyfriend's tea was served as a tea bag in a cup of hot water, instead of the traditional pot-and-tea-leaves that all the other tables around us received. \u00a0He was not happy about that.Finally we get our food -- some of it, at least: soup dumplings and a plate of steamed veggies. \u00a0No sign of our two main dishes. \u00a0We finish the soup dumplings and the veggies. \u00a0They finally bring us our first main dish (duck in an admittedly yummy but sugary and salty sauce). \u00a0This is about an hour after we ordered. \u00a0We eat the duck (or what there is to eat of it, since it's mostly bones and wing pieces with no meat). \u00a0We're still waiting for our other entree, walnut prawns. \u00a0We watch another table near us get a plate of walnut prawns.Almost TWO HOURS after we first ordered, we give up on our second entree. \u00a0Not a single waitress in the place has bothered to stop by our table the entire evening. \u00a0Our drinks are never refilled, and only 1 out of 2 entrees ever arrives. \u00a0We give up on the walnut prawns and decide to ask for a check. \u00a0We can't even get a waitress to pay attention to our waving arms to get us a check.My boyfriend walks up to the counter, where about three OTHER customers have taken it upon themselves to dig through the pile of bills, find theirs, and bitterly fork over some money so they can leave. \u00a0(But hey, I bet they at least got all of their food.) \u00a0When my boyfriend finds our bill and basically tackles a woman so that he can pay, she mentions that no one is leaving tips tonight. \u00a0NO SHIT. \u00a0In fact, I was so pissed that I was trying to convince him to walk out with me without even paying. \u00a0If I had been able to speak Chinese, I would have demanded to have our meal comped. \u00a0But my boyfriend, being a softie, feels bad for the lady and leaves a tip anyway.I snag five fortune cookies on our way out so that we at least get our money's worth out of the tip. \u00a0I'm about to tell the woman standing by the door (who has been standing there waiting for someone to help her for almost an HOUR) not to bother, but at that moment, she gives up anyway and leaves without her takeout order. \u00a0Good call.The lady who finally took my boyfriend's money apologized for forgetting our entree and said that they were just exceptionally busy. \u00a0Um, okay, you have a TINY restaurant with an ABUNDANCE of waitresses. \u00a0There is NO EXCUSE for service this bad. \u00a0They had absolutely NO system for waiting tables (we never even had a regular waitress).Furthermore, why did the two tables near us get their food before us? \u00a0And actually GET their food? \u00a0Was it because our table had me, the only white person in the place? \u00a0Man, I hope not. \u00a0I don't even want to go there.Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE. \u00a0I'd sooner starve than go back there (because you'll starve or die of dehydration either way, but you'll save money by not going).UPDATE: I GOT FOOD POISONING LATER THAT NIGHT!!! \u00a0YAAAY!!! \u00a0{death glares}"], ["S Z.", "Horrible experience we had at the restaurant at Christmas Eve.

Bringing it into my mouth to savour the taste that is.. wha.. what is this!? This isn't what I came for!? All the reviews on Yelp and Chowhound and Citysearch have all blindsided me on this one. Perhaps it was some sort of sick karma that I was led to this so called dumpling house that specialized in my favorite type of dumpling. I look away, disgusted at what I bit into. The meat is cold, even though it gives off the impression of freshly steamed, and that alone just makes me spit it out in disgust. Xiao long bao? Not coming back.Next, I move to my fried rice. I like fried rice because one, I can eat at a Chinese establishment without looking like I don't know what else I'm ordering and two, I just like fried rice. However, Shanghai Restaurant was just egging me on, making me dislike it even more. It was oily, days old rice (I can tolerate a few days, but this rice was.. at least a week + taste wise) and drowned in soy sauce and saltiness.Thanks for the horrible memories!"]]}
