The condensed milk on top of the two was lovely. Overall, some dishes were good and others were okay. The price also seemed a bit steep for the moderate portions you get.

The portions are reasonable, but they're still smaller than you might want or expect when paying 7-11 bucks a pop.  \u00a0 (2) They were gracious and helpful to me when I asked for no animal products in my meal.

A great place to take a date or a friend for a nice dinner. Nice colors, and contemporary decor make this place very comfortable. Although, it was the coldest day in Dallas in years, and I don't think the heater was working.

He finally brought the point home (literally) when he picked up a bottle of their ginger dressing to use on our monster Easter Sunday salad. I immediately got the girlfriend on the horn (heh heh) to let her know to clear her schedule so we could trek on over. . .I was not disappointed.You have to look hard to find Ginger Thai. Heck, we drove right past it and didn't even see it. It's hidden between a Boston Market and a laundry place so use them as your beacons to taste town. \u00a0The menu's got all your standard fare like pad thai, curries, pad kee mow, crispy whole fish, etc. Like most other Thai places in Dallas, there weren't any real surprises on the menu. We opted to start with the steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings and I ordered the sizzling mixed seafood and the girlfriend got lemongrass chicken. I'm completely serious when I say these are some of the best dumplings I've ever had. The perfect balance of shrimp to chicken with great flavor from the ginger and other seasonings, all wrapped and steamed with some roasted garlic on the top. The sauce was a sweet soy that had been reduced a little bit to get a thicker texture and it was so good I found myself scraping the plate with my fork to make sure I got it all. I felt bad until I looked across the table to find the girlfriend doing the same thing. I feared that I would be let down with my meal after such an awesome appetizer, but it's hard to be let down by a gigantic platter of huge mussels, shrimp, squid and scallops in a spicy sweet sauce with mixed vegetables. I hate when you order the seafood and you get one or two wimpy bits of squid. Lucky for me it looks like Ginger Thai slaughtered the giant squid from Calico Clones (look it up) and gave me the whole thing. . .it was squid madness in the best kind of way.The lemongrass wasn't as good as I've had at other places, but it was still a home run in my book. It was a much more subtle flavor than the seafood so maybe I'm not giving it a fair shake by trying to compare the two. \u00a0The service was great. Our servers made sure our drinks were as full as our stomachs at all times and were honest with their opinions of the menu (they say avoid the herbal chicken). Two drinks, two entrees and an appetizer cost us under $35 and we were in and out in under an hour without ever feeling like we were being rushed. I'll definitely be heading back.

Look for it behind the Spring Creek BBQ. Plenty of parking available for everything here.So far, this is the best Thai food I've found anywhere in the Dallas area. The interior is traditionally decorated, long and narrow leading to a private back room for groups where we sat. Had the pad kee mao (drunken noodles, delicious with pork) and a cup of the tom kha gai soup that was absolutely perfect. We shared several appetizers and not a single complaint was heard from anyone.Portions are large, prices are reasonable to downright affordable, especially with the BYOB option. Heat levels can be easily adjusted (just tell them on a 1-5 scale). Menu is not extremely extensive but large enough to cover all the bases from curries to seafood, and accompanying photos of the dishes is a plus. Service was exceedingly gracious, even with handling our own beer/wine, and order customizations were handled without complaint. Tippy herself is a personable dynamo worthy of her own television show. The only complaint I can even faintly entertain is that they are closed on Sundays, but that may change as they grow.

Eat here as soon and as often as you can manage. Scroll to the bottom for my dish recommendations. I first stopped by Tippy's in December of 2012. I'd been having a Thai food craving for a while, and I had been pretty dissatisfied with most of the Thai food I could find in the area. It was a Saturday at 2, so most of the lunch rush had cleared out. When Tippy herself came out to greet me, I was so impressed by her personal warmth that I closed the menu and asked her to \"Surprise me.\" She sure did, making me a Thai country style Tom Yum soup with rice noodles, fish cake, and ground pork that absolutely blew me away. I immediately called my foodie friends (luckily they like a late lunch as much as I do) and waited until they arrived. They ordered some food, and we stayed for over three hours, tasting and enjoying every item we could cram in our stomachs. Since the end of that holiday season, I have been back to Tippy's on a weekly basis. I've brought friends, dates, and family to Tippy's. I've brought people who didn't think they liked Thai food to Tippy's. Every single one of them has walked away pleased, and most of them come back to the restaurant on a regular basis. Recommended dishes:Best things on the menu? Tippy's Shrimp Boat is amazing, you'll want to drink the sauce. The duck curry is amazing, when she has it (ask ahead). If you like Tom Yum soup, don't miss her Tom Yum fried rice. As for the soup she first served me, it's not on the menu. But she will make it for you if you ask. And my favorite thing she makes was something she whipped up for me. If you're a fan of noodle dishes, as for Spencer's Whatever Special. Tippy's Thai Cafe serves food that will make you wish you had an extra stomach so you could have seconds.

From the moment of entering the restaurant I was warmly greeted and sat down at my table. You'll find Tippy is incredibly accommodating in being attentive in ensuring you enjoy your meal. The kitchen brought out a delectable array of food that hooked me from the first bite. I can't say I left anything on my plate! It was a dream come true. I concluded my meal with a Thai Coconut Ice Cream - and WOW! It sent me right back to when I was a kid. Incredible!! I can truly say I will never go to another Thai Restaurant in Dallas.

I ordered the Pad Thai, and I don't think I've had that much flavor from that dish in a while! My date ordered the Pad See Lew, which was equally as tasty. Tried the mango dessert with sweet rice, which was a good call from the waitress since mangos certainly were in season at the time. Overall, this place was fantastic! The service was frequent yet not invasive, the place was exactly what I wanted, and I was happy with the price I paid too.

They resembled the frozen ones you can get at a store to microwave at home (waste of $8).

Though I've been several times for both dining in and pick up, I can honestly say that the consistency of their dishes is one of the main things that keep me coming back. Also, their meals are incredibly tasteful and well seasoned beyond the typical \"salt and pepper\". The first time I dined here, I had the pad thai which was seriously yummy but every time after that, I have always gotten the red thai curry with tofu. I am vegetarian and it's very rare to find a restaurant that makes really good tofu which is another reason why I enjoy eating from this establishment. Now let's talk about the location, it's a tad bit small and one can feel crammed but it provides for a very intimate setting to dine at.

The wait staff was very attentive and nice. Came here after purchasing the $15 for $30 yelp deal. I didn't realize my order hadn't reached $30 and they didn't ask me to purchase something else to reach that total. I was taken aback at first after I realized it (especially after deducting tax which is not included in the yelp deal) since I was stuffed and nothing else on the menu caught my eye. I could have grabbed another appetizer or so but oh well, I don't plan on returning.The food was underwhelming. I ordered two appetizers (curry puffs and fried shrimp rolls) and pad thai for my entree. The curry puffs were surprisingly good but a different curry taste not like a spicy curry. It was actually sweet, almost like a pastry and the interior of the curry puff was mushy (think chunky mashed potatoes) with a sweet cucumber sauce on the side that I didn't care for. \u00a0The fried shrimp rolls were a little better but they didn't have that bursting flavor of cilantro like the comparable fried shrimp rolls I love (known as the shrimp blanket) from Banana Leaf Thai. Their spicy cream cheese dipping sauce actually complemented their fried shrimp rolls but I prefer the sweet and sour chili sauce instead.The pad thai was mediocre. I have had better. My heated leftovers with a dash of salt tasted better than when I ate it in the restaurant. I noticed they offer delivery.

Like a lot of Thai restaurants, their food is prepared sweet with an adjustable level of spice. I prefer my food to be more savory than sweet so this particular place didn't match well with what I like. The cup of tom yum was very generous but sweet. The same sweetness was present in the beef pad kee mao and chicken red curry. \u00a0The spice tray contains this potent chili powder. Be careful with it, it may look like benign chili flakes but that stuff burns. I added it to my curry and it definitely brought up the spice level. The curry reheats well the next day.

Said it would take 30 minutes. Shows up an hour and a half later. After calling them twice wondering where it was. To top it off, I open up the order and it's WRONG.

The only Thai place we like better is Si Lom, but that place can get pricey. This place is close to Baylor medical center where I work and they deliver to my place so we've had this a few times.

Overall favorites are Pad-See-Ew with beef and Avocado Thai Curry - be still, my heart. The Pad-Thai is a bit disappointing if you're a true Thai lover, but if you steer clear of that you'll likely be very happy! PS. The dishes are huge - enough for two servings."], ["Derek V.", "Food is very good for dine in.

I had the papaya salad, which was very tasty, but didn't have that spicy kick that I have come to love in the dish.I also had the panang curry with chicken. I LOVED the way the chicken was cooked. Some places give you these big chewy/over cooked pieces, but this was perfect. The curry flavor however just was missing something.

They said it's already out on the car. I ask again why it has taken so long - it is literally 10 blocks away. I didn't get take out because I just moved and am unpacking so I figured it'd be easy. Then she asks my address again, I tell her the same address and she said they had it wrong. I even spelled it with the person on the phone so I don't know how that is possible. She said it came back because there wasn't the address (whichever one they had). So clearly they hadn't planned on ever calling me to let me know they had the wrong address. She said I can get it to you in twenty minutes. So in other words two hours for mediocre thai food that is probably going to be cold. Then she said, well how about you pick it up? I said no. She said do you want it or not? I said not at this point and she just hung up on me."], ["Karen B.", "Delicious as always.

Disappointing compared to Si Lom.I have tried their pad ki mao, pad thai, curries, etc. but there's something about their shrimp pananag curry that really hits the spot. They don't skimp on portion sizes, their meat is real and fresh, the delivery is relatively fast, and they rarely mess up orders.

IF you like spicy food, they can definitely amp up the spice level. I only asked for \"a little spicy\" and I thought it was actually spicy, hahaha, but it was still really good.

The larb was good, but they should have seperated the lettuce so it didn't get soggy, and the curry was a little too sweet for me, but what threw me over the edge was THAT THERE WAS A LARGE BUG IN MY SOUP.

Any of the noodles5. Big Bowl Noodle Soups: Really enjoyed the Coconut Noodle Soup and Kao Soi (If you are a big fan of spice though, get 2-3 levels spicier than you normally would with the noodle soups.

The decorations are a bit modern with some traditional Thai influences. Something about the atmosphere made me feel very relaxed. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. Now, here's the best part - THE FOOD! When we got there it was still happy hour, so it was $2 off appetizers, as well as drink specials. We had thai beef jerky and the chicken satay. Both were way above average, with well cooked meats, and tasty sauces. My mom got the Tom Kha soup and I'm still craving it right now as I write. For entrees we got Si Lom Crying Pork, Pad See Ew, Pad Kee Mow, and Pad Bahmee. I honestly couldn't pick a favorite. Each one had an aromatic sauce, with perfectly crisped veggies, just the right amount of meet, and delicious noodles or rice.

I have been a patron of this place on several occasions, especially now that I live in Uptown. I love the ambience of the restaurant and its location near several of my favorite stores.

My fianc\u00e9 loves the wings and the samosas as well and he is very picky about wings and food in general. Now that I am Vegan, their menu is still accommodating.

My expectations were SO high for this restaurant and my party as a whole was let down. Things started OFF on a bad note. I made reservations for my brother's birthday on a Thursday for 20 people for a Sunday brunch at 1pm. I arrived to Malai Kitchen right at 1pm that Sunday, my name was on the list and the hostess, she said we'll get your table together. Twenty minutes passed and my party started to show up one by one. Table still wasn't ready. As the last of my party showed up, 30-35 minutes had passed and I asked the hostess what was going on?! She said, \"we're waiting on the people at the table to finish up and then your table will be ready.\" *blank stare* wait, WHAT?!?! What's the point of making a reservation if my table is not ready at the time it's supposed to be?! Secondly, WHY sit anyone at the table(s) for a party of 20 anytime CLOSE to the reservation time?! The people that were seated at our table didn't leave until 1:45pm...totally UNACCEPTABLE. So upset. Handled horribly.So we finally sat down, thankfully we got a great waitress, Daisy. The whole time, she was calm and cool and even when mistakes were made, she was very apologetic and solved the problem. She explained any drinks that we had questions about and made suggestions, which was really sweet. She was pretty much the only positive thing about our experience. Her, the Imperial Rolls, the Vietnamese Meatballs and the Pad Kee Mow. When it came to ordering, the Thai Eggs Benedict was a hit. I heard it was delicious. I ordered the Shrimp Pad Kee Mow, which was delicious, but I feel like I didn't get my money's worth because more than half of the bowl was filled with lettuce. I DID appreciate the five pieces of juicy shrimp though. The French Toast was pretty much moist, sliced pieces of baguette. Dry. The bread was barely soaked in egg mixture. Two people at my table had it sent back. THEN, one of my girls ordered the omelette. It was like they threw a salad/veggie mix inside, grilled up three pieces of shrimp and literally threw it inside. So sloppy, terrible presentation. On top of that, the potatoes on the side were burned to a crisp and I believe there were about thirteen on the plate. So here's where things went HORRIBLE. My friend that ordered the shrimp omelette, she returned it and asked for the Shrimp Avocado Salad. It took so long to come that she asked one of the passing waitresses to tell the kitchen to cancel it. It was brought out anyways and my friend said, \"oh I don't want it anymore.\" The woman, in the rudest and most blunt way possible says, \"oh we already made it.\" Places it on the table with attitude and walks away. We found out later, from our waitress Daisy, that the woman with attitude was the OWNER of all people, Mrs. Yasmin Wages. No personality, straight up rude and to work in the hospitality industry, she failed MISERABLY and treated us like crap. Daisy apologized on behalf of the restaurant and we definitely let her know that it wasn't her, but her owner made our experience, just bad.

The imperial rolls were not too good--the fried crispy rice paper wrapping were more just hard than crispy. The chicken wings and the entrees were all super tasty though. And the coconut biscuits that were the base for the eggs benedict? SO good. The two entrees that we ordered definitely seemed the most interesting on the menu; nothing else sounded particularly good.

It's made with a coconut biscuit instead of English muffin. And shrimp instead of ham. So I added their homemade sriracha sauce to it & it was oomph ! I love their sriracha sauce with anything. No, it is not the same like the store bought one. You have to try it! Imperial rolls were good. Chicken wings too. Peach ginger green tea & iced Vietnamese coffee was all good.

This is fine by me because it might be even better as an afternoon snack."], ["Farheen I.", "My last visit should serve as a warning to anyone with nut allergies, this place simply cannot accommodate you (but they won't tell you). I have an anaphylactic reaction to cashews. I told the waitress this and specifically asked if my curry has cashews. She said no. When my curry came out, i took a few bites and felt a little something. I fished around to see what was in there, and there was a whole huge cashew floating around. When I called the waitress over, she apologized and said the kitchen must have accidentally dropped one in there. Excuse me?!?! This is completely unacceptable, especially since I told her I was very allergic. I didn't end up in the ER, but I spent the rest of the night sick to my stomach and drowsy from my cocktail of medicine I have to take whenever I've been exposed to cashews. I will never come back. Thanks for almost killing me, Royal Thai."], ["Ann P.", "Be prepared to look around for a parking spot during lunch hours. I know I did!I was thoroughly impressed with the service because even while it's busy they brought out the food quickly. The waitress brought everything correctly. She did not ask me how spicy I wanted it but at least my food came out mild because I would rate 0 on the spicy scale anyways. :)I ordered the yellow curry with tofu and rice. It was delicious. It's definitely not the best Thai food I've tried but it was good for what it was. It's all affordable and the menu is extensive."], ["Jacqueline C.", "This is gonna sound weird, but I have a \"favorite\" thai place that I've been loyal to for years, and going to Royal Thai kinda felt like I was both cheating on my local restaurant and setting myself up for disappointment. I'm so glad I cheated! I refuse to say it's the better than my long time favorite, but I will admit that it's equally good. Plus, in all honesty, it's more upscale than most Thai places (if you're looking for \"date night appropriate\"), and the portions to price ratio is above average."], ["Robert G.", "A lovely gem of Thai cuisine in north Dallas. \u00a0There menu is made up of all of the Thai classics you would expect. \u00a0Service is usually spot on and even with consistent crowds it is usually easy to get a table. \u00a0 If you are in the mood for Thai, this is a solid option."], ["Ivy W.", "One of the better Thai restaurants I've tried in the DFW metroplex. The menu is more diverse compared to other Thai restaurants. Instead of just the typical Pad Thai and curry, they offer sea bass in chile sauce and other dishes I haven't tried at other Thai places. I highly recommend the minced beef lettuce wraps and the pad Thai. The Thai iced tea was a little too sweet for my likingMy favorite thing about this restaurant isn't the food - it's the decor and the atmosphere. The waitresses are dressed in what I believe is traditional Thai dresses and they have Thai inspired trinkets and pictures everywhere. Nothing basic about their set up and accessories."], ["Adam M.", "I love Thai food and had a really nice first experience here. I went for lunch solo, was pleased to see a packed house and accordingly sat at the bar. The lunch menu has a lot to choose from and all of them come with either a salad or the soup of the day, plus a spring roll. Pretty sweet sides if you ask me, all for a reasonable price.I ordered the panang curry with tofu and enjoyed it immensely. The star was the SOTD though, some sort of spicy cabbage in a light broth. It had a ton of flavor and was very clean, pairing well with the tasty iced coffee I got.It was a quick experience, but successful. The price for lunch is excellent, the food tasty, and the service snappy; they got me in and out. I will be back for dinner one day to spend more time and enjoy the inviting atmosphere of the space."], ["Britney Thuy T.", "I should have known it was not catered towards the quality of the food but towards trying to be a fake \"fine dining\" experience by the strict dress code and a guy in a suit that greets you as you walk in. Strike 1.Then we began to order our food, when I noticed the waitress did not even ask how spicy we would like our food......at a Thai restaurant.....a THAI restaurant. \u00a0Strike 2.The food came out and sure enough, was not spicy nor flavorful, unless you count \"1 bag of sugar sweet tea\" level of sweetness in your pad Thai as good Asian flavor. Strike 3. I would discuss the slow service but honestly what's the point."], ["Stephanie M.", "It's 4:40 pm on a Sunday afternoon and we decide to go get some Thai food. It's 100\u00b0 outside and my brother is wearing a tank top. There's three of us in our group and the restaurant is empty besides one other couple. 5 people. The one other woman in here is wearing a tank top as is our waitress. However, my brother is being refused service due to dress code. This is NOT a 5 star restaurant, there is nothing posted about dress code, and it's Sunday afternoon. I am super unimpressed with this experience and will not be returning. A lame ass hole in the wall Thai food place trying to pose as fine dining. I'm sorry, you are located in a shopping strip, next to a Subway and a Massage Envy. Keep it classy, Royal Thai. You are a joke.Update: the waitress is also wearing flip flops."], ["Camille K.", "Delicious! We had pad Thai, cashew chicken and chicken fried rice. Everything was very flavorful. Can't wait to go back and try something else. My only complaint was it was way too hot in the restaurant. Too many people to have the heat so high."], ["Thomas P.", "The food was fantastic. The spicy catfish bursted with flavor, and the calamari was really good. The soup also had a lot of flavor. The pork Preaw Wan had a very sweet and tasty sauce. The problem I had was that the food wasn't incredibly spicy. They assume because that we're Americans, we don't appreciate spicy food,(we do.) Tell them that you'd like your food (x) spicy, or they probably won't add any spice."], ["Paige G.", "Great food, but staff was weird at the bar while we were waiting for our table. Ordered a glass of wine and had to ask 3 people to actually get it after ordering."], ["Marianne C.", "Cozy, warm and intimate yet casual place for a really good Thai food. Found this place because of other Yelpers. I wished I lived near the area to get my hands on their lunch specials. :-)This place is tucked inside Old Town shopping center. Parking is hard to come by especially during lunch/dinner rush hour. Their waiting area is small and I didn't think they have any benches right out front. Service is fast, food is great. We ordered the Panang Curry(11.99) and Pad Thai with Beef (10.50) both of which is very good. The curry is creamy, sweet and very exotic to the taste, I can't stop eating it while the Pad Thai, compared to other Pad Thai's around have a much better quality ingredients (talking about the meat quality). Would definitely come back and try other food items. I highly recommend this place."], ["YaGritza J.", "I called here to place a to go order. The individual that answered sounded very rushed. Almost as if he didn't want me to place my order. It was more than an hour before closing. When I was trying to finish my order, he said \"ok got it\" and hung up. When I went to pick it up, the order was completely wrong and there were no utensils or condiments with my meal. When I returned with my food, he didn't seem apologetic or anything. Then said I had to ask for utensils for dinner. Very horrible service."], ["Jennifer W.", "The best Thai Restaurant in town. i highly recommend pad thai and orange beef."], ["Valerie W.", "Good food, good atmosphere.Tucked away next to a chicken joint but once you get inside your transported!Really good soups. I always get fried rice which is hard to mess up.Worth a trip if you have more refined taste you will definitely like it and go back!"], ["Stephanie L.", "I keep coming back to Royal Thai time after time. Maybe because it's conveniently located near SMU, maybe because the service is always prompt, maybe because the food is always on par. Probably all the above.My go-to is the chicken Pad Thai, which is very cliche (I know), but I can't help it! It's so good and you just can't go wrong with it. They always ask you how spicy you'd like your entree so that's great -- especially since I can't handle spicy, haha. Their portions are great and I'm always very satisfied every time I come here to eat.I have also tried the Panang Curry which is also delicious! My only complaint is that for the giant bowl-size of curry that they give you, they definitely don't give you enough rice. (Just a small bowl of rice. If you want more, you have to pay an extra $1.) The consistency of the curry is kind of thin so you can pretty much drink it like soup though. Not overly salty but still very tasty.I always feel like I should branch out and try other items on the menu, but I keep coming back to that Pad Thai. But I'll keep coming back as a happy customer. :-)"], ["Emily C.", "One of the best Thai food places in the area. The food quality and taste is consistent and service is pretty decent.Like all Thai food, food can tend to be a little on the oily side; however, flavors are always good at Royal Thai. They have a special duck curry that is delicious, and you can't go wrong with one of their noodle dishes. They are located in the Old Town shopping center on Greenville, so parking is easy"], ["Lindy C.", "This wouldn't be on the top of my list for thai food but it's okay. I came with a group of 8 friends and not unusual they did not seat us until everyone arrived. It wouldn't have been an awkward situation but the inside of this place has no room. There is no room inside for guests to wait so 5 of us awkwardly stood inside the bar seating/hostess stand/front door so we had people walking through us and we had the hardest time trying to move out of peoples way. Luckily after 20 minutes the hostess decided to seat us even though 3 of our friends had not arrived yet.The food took slightly longer to arrive at our table than what I normally see with a party this size but they were very quick to get our drinks. I had the thai tea and it is a must order. I feel like they make it a bit stronger to account for the watering down effect from the ice. I had the pad see ew with pork and my bf had the spicy noodles. My noodles were good, good size portion but I had to season it with many of the sauces on the table to make it flavorful. The spicy noodles looked delicious and being a wimp when it comes to spicy foods (I like them I just can't tolerate them well) but it was good and VERY spicy. My bf who orders everything spicy found it to be quite spicy too.Overall, I like this place but I don't love it. I suggest avoiding this if you plan to have a party size over 4 people and if you do come you must order the thai tea."], ["Derek S.", "If this is what royals eat, bring me peasant food!The establishment had a nice vibe inside and the menus looked good as well- plenty of options to choose from- and the service was decent. \u00a0But that's about as many nice things as I can say about this place.I ordered the garlic shrimp and it came out faster than s toasted pop tart- which was a little suspicious. \u00a0We were there just before close so it's possible we were getting pre-cooked leftovers. \u00a0It ended up being mostly a plate of chewy broccoli with 10 pretty small shrimp for $14- not really enough to fill me up or make me feel like I received a good value at all.My roommate and his fianc\u00e9 got the pad Thai and weren't impressed either. \u00a0The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if our bad experience may be partially due to his fianc\u00e9 wearing a sleeveless tank (which was strictly forbidden by a printed notice upon entering the restaurant). \u00a0We did not expect this or mean to disrespect their dress code. \u00a0However, in turn, it was our taste buds that felt disrespected.I wouldn't doubt the positive reviews here, maybe we just came at a bad time, but it will be hard giving this place another look when there are so many good restaurants in the area. \u00a0I don't mean to go on a Thai-rade but I was overall very disappointed in Royal."]]}
