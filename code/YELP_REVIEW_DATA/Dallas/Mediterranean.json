YES, it is BYOB. I would recommend you bring your own cork screw for your wine bottles, since well theirs are not in the best condition. I gave this place 3 stars simply because the ambiance was nice, sat outside and had a nice lady from Lebanon as our server. However, this is a place that could use a little more service oriented people. While our server was sweet, the lady that greeted us was not so inviting. If you work in a place of service, smile, it does wonders.The food came out, and well we ordered sampler appetizer, and kebob sampler. The food was good, I think I enjoyed it more since I had a bottle of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio that I paid only $15 for, instead of the ridiculous markups of the same bottle at another restaurant, where I know I would have paid at least $40 for. The group of people that we met outside let us know the food was good, but to expect the service to be a little slow. We didn't experience that the service was too slow, but it was not that busy to begin with. If it had been slow with not that many people, my rating would have dropped \u00a0a star. The 3 stars is for decent food, nice server, and ok prices. When a Mediterranean place gives me cold pita and the gyro is from a frozen box, I just can't be the biggest fan, but I can see myself going back for the BYOB, and that Baba ghanoush.. now that was delish!"], ["Erica T.", "The bf and I decided try Sevan G&G after reading about it in the Observer. We were especially intrigued by their hummus with lamb. It was quite tasty-the toasty lamb pieces and pine nuts add dimension and texture to an already tasty hummus. The spices used were delicious. The dolmas were delicious as well. We shared the gyro platter which was perfect for two since we shared apps. The gyro meat was cooked well and had great flavor. We should've brought some wine, as it's BYOB, but be prepared to spend $30 per couple to not pay the $15 corking fee. The only downside was service was slow at the beginning and we had to flag down staff for water.

The waitress half body toward me, the other half out to the table in the center of the room, \u00a0told me I needed to order because the kitchen was going to close and that I couldn't order any food after 8.

Recipes vary greatly. You're served an unusually large breast, covered with a creamy sauce that's got savory, sweet, and tangy notes. For a breast this large, it's very velvety, too. How is it that I've never had such a delicious sauce on chicken before? I don't know why, I just enjoy that mystery!BYOB, without a cork charge. Wine greatly enhances this cuisine.

As for the rest of my experience- \u00a0my pick up order was ready in under 15 minutes (during our recent \"snow storm\"), the Kashmir Chicken alone was worth going back for, \u00a0 and the total was around $35 for hummus, one side and one entree (as for how the cost breaks down, I have no idea, since there were no prices on the menu)."], ["Abi G.", "This place is the biggest culinary secret in Dallas.

My expectations were low to begin with and this proved it right. The first experience here was sloppy because even if the food isn't great, the service should be easy to compensate. There were about three other tables and the restaurant fits about ten tables and it took about 10 minutes to even get noticed and get some water. This could be understaffing or just operational mishaps, so let's move past that to the food. I had tilapia and falafel for my entree and mouhamra spread as an appetizer. So, the mouhamra is awesome. It's so different than other ones. This is a hummus-like spread for you folks who aren't familiar with types of Mediterranean spreads. It has walnuts and peppers in it and it's pretty light and delightful. I come back just to get this appetizer to go. But besides this app, the other food is very subpar. The fish was dry and bland and the falafel was just ok. If you're in a bind waiting for the libertine and can settle for less, then Sevan's is a slower alternative, but at least you can have some mouhamra."], ["Allison L.", "Mmmmmmm. \u00a0I said Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

Situated inside a little courtyard, Ziziki's is one of the best, if not the best, brunch buffets around. For $20/person, you get access to the buffet, unlimited mimosas/coffee, and a great ambiance. Sometimes, when people hear the word buffet, they think of an abundance of low quality food and fillers. Not the case here. The buffet is full of fresh Greek dishes, as well as some American dishes for a more traditional brunch. Sample foods include scrambled eggs (Greek style), pancakes, chicken, lamb, pasta, salads, bagels with salmon and cream cheese, cake, fruit, pasta, dolmades, and really good baklava. Also included with your meal is Ziziki bread. This is pure deliciousness. Think of a cheese pizza without the marinara. The bread is served with their house tzatziki sauce, which is one of the best I've had. $20/person may seem like a lot for brunch, but trust me, it's worth it. Other places will cost at least $10/plate, and then there's drinks to consider. Here, you have a buffet of great food to choose from and as many mimosas as you want. If you don't plan on having some mimosas, then maybe it's best to save this place for another time where you can get your money's worth. Definitely one of the better brunch options in the area."], ["Helen H.", "Came here for lunch. Delicious! Will come backZiziki bread is delicous. And the Ziziki sauce is grewt!!!

Upon being seated, they gave us pita bread with cheese to dip in their tzaziki sauce which was pretty good. For the buffet food, they had a good variety ranging from salmon & bagels, hot marinara pasta, cold white sauce pasta, blueberry pancakes, cinnamon french toast, fish, chicken, lamb, roasted potatoes, mushrooms, salad and pastry and fruits for dessert. I really liked the french toast and pancakes. They were soft fluffy and flavorful. The mushrooms were good and so were the pastas. However, I didn't like any of the meat dishes. The fish was extremely fish, like it was old and the chicken and lamb were very tough and dry. Pretty disappointing considering the place was pretty busy yet the food wasn't that great. We also have the option of getting an egg benedict or omelette from the back.

It was seasoned just right and the lamb itself had great flavor. \u00a0My wife's veggie souvlaki also was bursting with Greek flavors. \u00a0The veggies were cooked to the point that they had great texture but were hearty because they were not soggy. \u00a0The roasted potatoes were amazing! \u00a0They were Golden brown on the outside and soft on the inside. \u00a0 The ambiance of this restaurant was very romantic. \u00a0We sat outside on a beautiful night. \u00a0My only complaint was that the bathrooms were in need of a cleaning and maybe even a painting/remodeling. \u00a0Strange that such an amazing restaurant in the wealthiest area in Dallas had a men's room that is so run down. \u00a0My wife said her bathroom was ok. \u00a0It's the ONLY reason I did not give it 5 stars.Anyways, the next time the Greek Craving hits us, we will be back!"], ["John H.", "I went for brunch which is buffet style and an 80/20 mix of Greek/American.First, the buffet is full of GOOD food. \u00a0Most buffets have a lot of \"filler\" items and this one is just a long string of gems. \u00a0There are breakfast staples such as scrambled eggs and pancakes but there are also amazing vegetable dishes, fresh fruit, dolmas, goat cheese, smoked salmon, lamb, roasted garlic, an omelet station... the list goes on... it's a huge selection and again, all top notch.They're very fair w/ the bottomless mimosas too. \u00a0I don't see them over serving but given that we were there an exceptionally long time, my glass didn't go empty often either.Now, here's the hook...I can appreciate a restaurant needing to turn tables and I try to keep that in mind if I know I've been there a while. \u00a0I'm fair. \u00a0But I happened to be having a really good time and even met some new friends at a nearby table. \u00a0This was somewhat of an impromptu extension.90% of restaurants in Dallas would have found a way to run me out the door. \u00a0Ziziki's staff were gracious to let us stay, enjoying a slow meal and newfound company.There are a lot of brunch choices in Dallas but this one has exceptional quality food, pleasant and friendly location (parking underneath is plentiful and free!), gracious services and staff, and has been consistently doing me right for me for 10+ years.THAT is something worth writing about and worth going back. \u00a0I tip my hat to Ziziki's."], ["Bill F.", "Really disappointed with the quality of the food on the last visit.

Ziziki's is a different kind of greek restaurant from what I've came across within the Dallas suburbs.

I loved the finishing dessert, the bakalava ice cream and espresso. The ziki sauce, however, was a little too on the buttery side and the starting appetizer was good but just different from what I've experience. Overall, I loved the ambiance on how cozy it was and the happy hours, from what i can recollect and this restaurant almost resembles a lot of what New York establishments are set up similar like; Small, Chic, Cozy and great service!!

I ordered the lamb lasagna and it was very very yummy! I love lamb and have been very pleased with all the lamb dishes The Greek offers and Zizikis was almost as delicious. I wish the lasagna came with some sides because $17 for just a square serving of lasagna wasn't enough. My bf ordered the lamb with orzo risotto and it was ungodly good! I didn't let him eat the whole thing so that I could have leftovers for lunch the next day, and it's even better the next day! The primary reason I wanted to eat Zizikis was for the baklava ice cream cake. These yelp reviews made me salivate and it was so worth the wait! I wish the The Greek offered this dessert! My only criticism about Zizikis is regarding the waiter who served us. While our hostess was very sweet, our waiter was dismissive of my bf and me. We probably look like common riffraff compared to the rich WASPs of Highland Park but my (boyfriends's) money can buy the same damn lasagna as the the rich folks next door!

As I expected, she also became hooked on this place and was thankful for my suggestion. For our appetizer, we had the Spanakopita. It's a flaky dough pastry filled with spinach , onions, and feta cheese and served along with olives, sliced onions, and Roma tomatoes. The ingredients were a perfect combination for flavor and texture. If you want to prolong the enjoyment of the Spanakopita, I suggest ordering it for yourself or sharing it with no more than 1 other person due to the portion size.For the main entree, we ordered the \u00a0Chicken souvlaki. Let me tell you, Ziziki's is VERY generous on the portion size for the Chicken Souvlaki. Both my friend and I wanted to share that entree and expected for only one gyro to be served. BUT when the dishes came out with our food split, we each had our own gyro and roasted garlic potatoes. It literally looked like one meal size for a \"shared portion\". So if you're hungry and you order the Chicken Souvlaki expect to see 2 gyros. Otherwise, if you want to share, this portion will leave both parties very full and happy.Another small treat I liked about this place is that they offer free Andes chocolates in the bathroom! If you love Andes, be sure to grab some. (Sometimes the little things \u00a0in life do matter you know!) Note that Ziziki's location off Knox and Travis is hidden in the complex. When you valet or park your car, you'll have to walk further into the plaza to find the restaurant as it is not visible along the street.

I think I must set land-speed records every time I devour it. The sliced lamb served on a pita with great sauce and closely resembles a high-class pita. For the life of me I can figure out how it differs from the lamb souvlakis, other than the souvlakis are described as medallions. I'll stick sliced.Desserts are good- The Baklava Ice Cream Cake was the resounding favorite of our table on separate occasions.Drinks are what you'd expect, not too expensive, not too cheap. They do have a good list of wines by the glass and there are some pretty good tasting ones in the lowest-priced tier. Because in today's economy, you take every penny you can get.To keep it fresh, they have three potential dining spaces- Their main restaurant area, a smaller space (looks to be for events) across a breezeway or out in the courtyard al fresco style. If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, sit outdoors with caution as smoking is allowed in the courtyard.I would eat at Ziziki's once a week if I could and, now that you mention it, I think I just found my next great idea."], ["Steven C.", "I'd just like to say, I LOVE Ziziki's! I've always had the best Sunday Brunch here. They make the bottomless mimosa's with a better grade of champagne than most the places in Dallas. Also they also keep them flowing and you never have to worry about getting a refill. Quality of service is outstanding. Despite it being a buffet they find ways to make sure the service is still great. When you first sit down they bring out some cheesy pita bread add that to a little of their artichoke hummus and get ready for some amazing. The restaurant is fairly quiet, I enjoy that its a relaxing way to start a Sunday. Also although the buffet is tiny compared to most, the phrase \"quality not quantity\" comes to mind. I really enjoy the Dolmas. But my very favorite thing about Ziziki's.... The Chocolate Cake. I had been telling my girl friend about this cake for months when we came here for brunch. I was surprised to find she had passed it by several times. I asked her \"why didn't you get a slice of cake?\" She said it just looks too plain and not very good. Frustrated I went up there and grabbed a slice of this very unassuming, unfrosted, plain chocolate cake and sat a slice down in front of us... Yeah, Lets just say if I ever need to say I'm sorry for something I'll skip the roses! You should have seen her face after that first bite! This cake reminds me of The little engine that could. By far my favorite cake in the world! Maybe her's too. I've gone back and picked up a couple of slices to go, just to get our fix since then. I will say that over the years the quality here has gone down. Kinda seems they have stopped using the secret ingredient, Love. But I still love it. I hope they get back on the ball and bring this back to being the place I can't stop thinking about once again. Even with the secret ingredient missing I'm giving it 5 stars."], ["Megan B.", "Ziziki's has been a long term favorite in our family. The rich smell of garlic and roasting lamb immediately relaxes me, like being in my mother's kitchen as a child. The wine list is always good. Even the inexpensive wines will be tasty. The food is fantastic! There's vegetarian, lamb, chicken, and fish. The salads are addictive, and I love the chicken fettucine with white wine sauce. I recommend the mediterranean pita bread for an appetizer. The calamari is the best I've had any where, ever! For desert, the chocolate liquor cake with vanilla ice cream is delicious, but you might be too full to eat it! Portions are generous, and there is no shortage on flavor.The staff has always been the best part. They always make an effort to remember you, so you are greeted with familiarity when you arrive.

Smaller selection but much more delicious and quality food. None of that french toast and carbmaster breakfast foods, but instead you'll have smoked salmon, shrimp, meats, olives, and not feel like a huge fatty.

Will definitely come back for brunch."], ["Alex N.", "For some reason I thought Ziziki's was a Deli. I was quite wrong. We stumbled upon the original location on a Thursday evening after looking for a restaurants on Knox that had more than two people inside. Dining while being outnumbered by waitstaff is AWKWARD. We were seated immediately, 30 minutes into our meal the room started to fill up and it had a pretty good ambiance. I do think their hood vent needs updating however, the dining room does get pretty smelly since most of their foods are grilled.For me, the most pleasant surprise I had was the spanikopita. I typically never eat this since I am not a fan of feta. But this version was more spinachy and well balanced in flavors. I had the kefta kebab entree and it was well seasoned, moist, with a slight lamb flavor.It is a bit pricey.

Their service is friendly and attentive, especially for just eating their lunch buffet.Onto the food: the meats here are excellent. They're all seasoned great and bursting with flavor. The rice dishes they have are also a nice addition. Despite the awesome meat and rice dishes, the rest of the buffet is a little underwhelming. While they do change up the selection on a daily basis, the meats and rice are consistently the only good things. Sadly, their pita bread is flat and cold. With Sahara Restaurant, I'm torn between the juicy, mouth watering meats and the cold flaccid pita and other buffet options. While the only major negative is the pita bread, the rest of the dishes pale in comparison to the meats. You almost have a slope of different food qualities, with the pita being at the very rock bottom, then slowly climbing you have the various vegetarian buffet options, and then the rice dishes, and then finally, at the pinnacle of excellence, their meats. I definitely plan on coming back here, and would recommend giving them a try."], ["Janice C.", "For all the vegetarians out there, be warned this buffet is not for you!

The tahdig was a good starter: we got it with the lentil stew, and they were crispy, flavorful bites that I really enjoyed. The hummus and grape leaves are good also: vegetarian filling on the grape leaves and quite soft and delicious-almost like I remember back at the old Vincent's Seafood when I was a child.If they could solve the pita bread conundrum (it's just kind of average), improve the grilled tomatoes (maybe not ripe enough for me because I'm psycho about ripe tomatoes), and make the saffron rice a little less dry (I liked the rice-a-roni type rice at Ali Baba better), then I would gladly roll out star number five."], ["Kiran V.", "I visited this restaurant for the first time last week.

They have hummus, tabuli and Shirazi plus yogurt and cucumbers. And dessert- the milk and rose water cream.... They bring pita bread to your table.Everything is delicious!

Their hot tea was refreshing, and they also serve Turkish coffee.

There is a varied selection for lunch. Weekday buffet is under $10, weekend are just a little above $10, I believe.I drank some nice Persian hot tea afterwards. Its nice and aromatic and soothing to drink after the meal. They make their own blend! I even bought half a pound at the \"convenient store\" tucked away in the corner by the door. $12.99 a pound ( I believe) but a half pound goes a long way.

Very much home-cooking flavors, almost basic, not too Americanized at all. Went with a slice of baklava for dessert, which was disappointing (tasted chewey and store-bought).

Potatoes were just boiled with same spices. For $20. From the special menu. I have to add that our dinners came with a small cup of lemon chicken soup, a dolma and bread. The soup was extremely tangy. Dolma was fresh and tasty.The biggest disappointment was the service. My partner ordered a soda and noticed lipstick on the glass - right after he filled it. I had my own iced-tea and wore only lipgloss that nite. We flagged down a busboy who came over and didn't say one word.

This was a Greek hummus with artichokes, garlic, lemon and warm pita bread. While the hummus was fantastic, it was the pita bread that was distinctly rememberable. So much so I asked what made it so tasty. The owner informed me this all came down to Greek oregano with some salt, pepper and garlic. For lunch I opted for Salmon Souvlaki (skewers) and a side Greek salad with Ziziki dressing. I preferred the light salad compared to the standard potatoes. The meal arrived promptly and the skewers were served atop a large round pita bread. The salmon was perfectly moist and fell apart with the touch of my fork. It was pretty easy to clean up my plate. I opted for a coffee to close out the meal and the addition of cinnamon was a welcome surprise. Overall, this place bleeds of authentic Greek food and I'd highly recommend it.

The chicken was seasoned and grilled well, my salad was fresh and the pita bread was soft and warm.I do feel like the prices are a little too high for lunch, though.

Gyro for lunch was all lamb cooked to perfection. Came back for dinner and had the Greek Paella."], ["Laura P.", "Came here for lunch on a weekday. In the past I haven't exactly had good luck with Greek food so I'm usually wary to try another place out. So glad my mother wanted to come here! It's a nice looking restaurant with pleasant service. We started with the Ziziki bread, which is just a pita with some cheese and herbs served with their wonderful Ziziki sauce. First off, that sauce was a pleasant surprise for me since what I've had in the past has been either overly cucumber-y (not my favorite flavor) or too heavy with the sour yogurt flavor. This was a nice balance of cucumber, herbs, and yogurt. The cheese pita was nothing special when it comes to what they do to it, but it sure tasted great. My mother ordered the lamb burger (on a pita bun), which was delightfully drippy with that sauce and piled high with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and purple onions. The burger itself was a very good size and was cooked to about medium. I had the pleasure of the other half of it the next day and can attest to how well that pita held up after a day in the fridge and a turn in the oven to reheat. I ordered the lamb souvlaki and it was also very nicely done. They didn't ask how I wanted the lamb but it came out perfectly to me. Some pieces were a bit past medium, and some were a little more medium rare, but all in all it was terrific. It was also laid out on a pita with more of that sauce drizzled over. Everything came with a side of so-so roasted potatoes which were on the far side of having too much salt. I'm getting really tired of every restaurant I go to having such a liberal hand with salt. A little salt enhances flavor, we all know that. But someone needs to tell these people that more salt doesn't exactly enhance even more. We originally planned on having two desserts but we were close to full so we ended up sharing a tiramisu, which was very nice with a heavy espresso flavor. I also had a lovely cup of coffee that was fairly strong with a hint of cinnamon which was a nice touch. My only real negative (besides those salty potatoes) is that I thought the prices were a tad on the high side for lunch. But overall I'll be very happy to return!"], ["Carly K.", "I love coming here when I visit my dear friend in Dallas. She got me hooked the first time I can for a visit, and we have come back on every visit since. The Zaziki's salad with skewered chicken is to die for, and it's really one of my favorite salads anywhere. The lettuce is always at the peak of freshness, and the chicken is never overdone. It has a hint of smoke to it, and it perfectly grilled. The cucumbers, tomatoes, and kalamatas are always fresh, and the feta is to die for.I love to get an order of pita with the fresh feta. The pita is always warm and fresh out of the oven, and the feta melts onto the pita, and it is just divine.Maybe next time I'll branch out and try something different, but I just love this salad too much.

My friend ordered the Greek Island Chicken, which was basically \u00a0the same chicken as my dish, but in a semi-creamy sauce, along with the potatoes. Again, good but also 19 dollars.

Because of this, the food was lukewarm by the time I got back to work. A quick zap in the micro took care of it, and it was delicious.

If you are waiting, they have a wonderful paper gift shop called Paper Affair that you can scope out awesome things to look at and see.If you have never been, the one appetizer I recommend is the Artichoke Dip which is has wonderful soft pita bread with an artichoke garlic hummus dip that will not only keep you eating but wont prevent you from eating the main course.To be frank, you cannot eat there without ordering something with Lamb. If you don't try it - you're missing out. Perfectly cooked to your specific preference, the rack of lamb is served with excellent mashed potatoes and yummy asparagus.Other dishes to try are the Lamb Salad and the Greek Burger ( pita bread with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, their special sauce, and lamb )The pan roasted potatoes are great to eat with the Lamb Salad and the Greek burger.

Sometimes you do get what you pay for in a very positive way. The quality was absolutely worth the elevated price.Ziziki's can thank a well-placed ad in the Observer for our attendance. The seed it planted gave way to the solution to the ever-challenging riddle of \"Where is some place different that we can eat?\" Despite being under-dressed for such nice environs, we were treated like valued customers. Our server was polite, friendly and did a great job keeping up with our needs. However, that was simply a bonus on top of the great food we had.We shared a large appetizer platter to start. Personally, I thought the combination of feta and Ziziki sauce on the grape leaves was a bit much but the others thought it was fantastic. I enjoyed the spanikopita despite not being a Spinach fan.We split three main courses. Believe it or not, I did not order the Greek cheeseburger but wish I had. It was juicy and flavorful, plus the pita actually provided a perfect complement to the patty. I had the Grecian chicken , which featured two Christina Hendricks' sized breasts, smothered in a delicious becamel sauce and ample amounts of mushrooms. This dish was indeed the hit of the night! Finally, we had the pastichio (Greek Lasagna?) which was nicely put together but slightly off-putting due to inclusion of an unknown spice (I think cinnamon)We left agreeing that we would certainly revisit Ziziki's again.

The first time I got the beef shwarma with the salad bar I had to ask the cleaning lady who picks up trash and cleans tables for it. The second time I had to walk to the counter and ask t he guys for my chicken. They then scooped some pre-cut chicken from the hot hold instead of cutting it off the cone. Another complaint about the meat is that unless you're getting it in a pita they will cut it and then sautee it on the grill top almost burning it. The chicken was dry when they did this.

I only wish they had Lavosh, but the stuff they did have was wonderful. Most of the salads have cheese on them already, so if you're not a dairy person, it might not be a great spot to get your salad on. There are a lot of digestion-inducing ingredients in the buffet: eggplant, fried cauliflower, mushrooms, olive oil. There are also some anti-digestion foods: cheese, spinach, nuts, pita. So whether you want to speed up, slow down, or maintain your digestive activities, Cedars probably has something for you. The dining room is really nicely styled with big wooden chairs and tables arranged in a manner that allows for communal dining as well as large groups. Once seated (after ordering/paying at the counter and then grabbing your grub), a waiter will come by to get your drink order. I overheard some lady say the peach tea is amazing. They also have some kind of super caffeinated tea. The plates are ginormous, making it easy to only need one trip to the buffet, but you can go back as much as you want.

I've dined in (on the lamb gyro platter $8) and to-go, and the trick to affordability and variety is definitely to-go! The first thing on their menu is the $9.99 vegetarian feast all you can eat salad bar deal, which allows you to frequent their massive and delicious non-meat hot and cold dishes as many times as you want when you dine in. BUT, if you get to-go, it's $4.99/lb. If you do the math, you see that you'd have to eat 2 lbs of food in one sitting for the dine in option to get the same bang for your buck to-go. I certainly can't do that and would rather take out 2 lbs of food that i could eat over several days!And oh the variety and delicious tastes! Many of the items are minimally seasoned with salt, pepper, herbs, and olive oil in accordance to a mediterranean diet, but the flavors of the food is all super on point. There're several delicious cold salads, curried couscous, tabouli, grilled eggplants, carrots, zucchinis, hummus, babaganoush, pasta salads, flatbread pizzas. Then don't forget to turn your head to the hot foods section which is also part of the \"vegetarian feast\" deal. You won't see any meat except shrimp on any of these items, but who needs meat when you have delicious fried cauliflower, mediterranean stewed okra, seasoned mashed potatoes, wilted spinach, rice pilaf with caramelized onions, marinated mushrooms and zucchini, and so much more!

But, I do suggest they start a by the glass special or something in order to get more HH customers in. We started our dinner off with Hummus and Pita Bread. The hummus was some of the best I've ever had. It had just the right amount of tang that I like. I highly recommend it!

The dolmas, however, were a bit more oily and soggy than I was used to, and I would've preferred more of the lemon sauce taste. I cannot comment on the falafels because I do not have much prior experience with them (they were good nonetheless!). The baba ghanoush was delicious in a salty, textured way, but I think I personally preferred the hummus more.I ordered the baklava last. It was quite tasty!

Some unique dishes I haven't seen before like braised lamb over smoked eggplant pur\u00e9e. Hummus was very flavorful if not as smooth as I prefer. Great flavors, good prices, good portions.

I would highly recommend for the picky eater like me!! Lisa from Pittsburgh"], ["Luke D.", "This place is awesome! I am excited to see good Mediterranean food so close to where I live. So far I have had the falafel and the gyro. Both were some of the best that I have had. I would highly recommend paying this place a visit. I agree with Tracy's review in that sharing dishes is a good idea as their plates are large and you should try everything they have to offer.

The staff is friendly and does a good job at making sure you have everything you need. I could write an essay on how great their food is. From the chicken to Gyro, everything is top-notch. Most places over cook and dry out their gyro/lamb meat so I was pleasantly surprised (and ecstatic) that Pera's was tender and flavorful. The pita bread and hummus is excellent, definitely better than most others I have tried. Their wine selection is also on point. This place just has goodness written all over it. Everyone should give it a try and enjoy some good authentic Mediterranean/Lebanese food!"], ["Chad S.", "This is by far and away the greatest new restaurant in Dallas. It's a place where you can grab great food and meet the greatest business owners in all of Texas. Their food is a combination of Mediterranean/Turkish and it will rival any of the best restaurants in Dallas.

Warm crispy bread, a glass of free champagne for the women, and delicious tapas. The stuffed dates, lamb chops and meat and cheese tray were the favorites, but everything was fresh and flavorful! The sangria was also great and we enjoyed the live music. At the end of the evening, we were treated to three complimentary desserts- definitely a good choice for the evening."], ["Bejoe M.", "I live in downtown Dallas and was craving Mediterranean food. I use yelp often and saw this place. I've never seen this place before and decided to try it. Very glad I did! The food was amazing. I got the beef doner and my wife got the chicken kebabs. It was delivered warm and I was very surprised by the quantity. They offered free delivery and it even came with a free dessert. I asked the driver, who I swear was also the cook, how long they have been open and he told me only 4 months. He was a super nice guy too.

The food was fantastic. We shared the hummus appetizer, and I ordered the gyro for an entree. My husband had the lamb chops.

I spoke with who I assume was the owner and he informed me that the order was ready to pick up an hour ago and the driver just showed up. He informed me that he was not going to allow a meal he prepared more than an hour prior to go to one of his customers so he is making the driver wait till he can prepare my order from scratch.

I don't know if we just had a bad string of luck or what, but nothing had any flavor to it. The chicken just tasted like boiled chicken with no flavor whatsoever, the beef tenderloin tasted like unseasoned beef, and the mint tea wasn't strained and you couldn't take a sip without sucking up a mint leaf.All in all, I was really disappointed in paying 90 bucks (after tip) for a lackluster meal, and I'd highly suggest having Olivella's Neo Pizza Napoletana instead that's a few doors down."], ["Blanca G.", "OMG I have to say their food is incredible!I'm not big on trying new things but I have it a shot and it was astonishing.My boyfriend and I had a bottle of tasty wine two entrees and desert and it ended up being about 100 It was totally worth itThe chef really knows what he's doing here!"], ["Brooke C.", "Not sure what the hype is.

Having eaten at all Turkish restaurants in the metroplex and throughout the country, I can confidently say this is the best one! Quality and taste are superb. Every Sunday they have a brunch buffet, which is very popular, so I suggest you make reservations. The price is very reasonable ($13) and the selection is very good. My favorite is lentil soup and steak (little pieces of beef marinated overnight and grilled to perfection). Very good vegetarian options.They have a wonderful lunch deal that gets you an appetizer, an entree and a drink (I think) for $10. They should post it on their website and Yelp to attract more people.Complimentary bread comes piping hot, which is one of the highlights of the meal. Hummus, cacik (yogurt dip) are good. Sigara boregi is a bit oversalted. My favorite is Adana Kebab. In addition to rice, I wish they had bulgur, which is a very common Turkish side (they list it on their menu, but never seem to have it). Lahmacun is my other favorite, not soggy like at Turkish Cafe and Lounge.The owner is a very caring man who greets people personally (if you get to know him). You can see him running around catering to the patrons, making sure everything is taken care of. The staff is attentive. I frequently come to this place if I want to have dinner with a friend and be able to talk - it's not too loud.To all the reviewers who rated it less than 4 stars, I bet you don't know what Turkish/Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food tastes like.

It was buffet - variety I saw was a lot for someone who knows what kinda food is expected. You need to ask for fresh pita bread - that was too good. Hummus was too good. There were a lot of add-ons: potato, tomato-onion paste, three kinds of cheese, baboush (eggplant hummus kinda thingy - not sure if I spelt it correctly), parsley, beetroot etc [Too many to name], everything needs to be mixed and eaten, which was really good. Everything tasted fresh. There was a salad as well, spinach pastry - which was awesome. Then a lot of meat - fried/baked : chicken, fish, beef,sausage,etc. For desserts there was baklava, cheesecake, carrotcake and something else - which was milk mixed with coconut and something.Overall - Really good place.

Good thing I did too. Probably the best tabouleh I've ever had. It had really fresh well prepared ingredients, just the right amount of lemon, but what sent this tabouleh to stratospheric status was the pomegranate. So colorful and SO well paired to the rest of the salad. It was perfectly tart and oh so very good.The entrees were really good too. Small romaine and carrot house salad with a very tasty dressing on a plate with rice and meat, in my case chicken kebobs. The rice was great, the salad was great and the chicken was also really good.

The delightful herbs and spices tickled my senses with utter disbelief that this. is. food. Your toes curl from the explosion of flavors, thrashing against every corner and walls of your mouth from the moment they bring out fresh bread and feta cheese dip. . Every bite is a phenomenal conquest. You learn to truly enjoy the art of masticating through each bite. There has never been a time where I felt defeated, with the exception of severe gluttony. Nothing comes short here. And did I mention, BYOB (quite literally speaking). What can beat such gluttonous delight? Two things: their desserts which will leave you to crave them like a 7 month pregnant lady and impeccable service. They will become your second family. I made sure I did. And if you're planning to visit Turkey, this is a GREAT place to start training your taste buds (there won't be much training)."], ["Martin H.", "Probably the best kebab that I have ever had, and that was a very bold statement. \"The Pera's Signature Adana\": I honestly don't know how they cooked it, but the kebab was seasoned and grilled perfectly with certain spices. I also tried the Lamb Shish: \"Special marinated cubes of lamb grilled to delight on skewers\". The cubes were served on a tomato-based yogurt base, and it was simply divine. The Turkish bread for the hummus was delicious too. Can't wait to go back to see what else they have to offer. p.s. it is BYOB."], ["Ol' Dirty B.", "Loved everything about this place. The service was fantastic from the jump, and management does a great job of keeping an eye out on customers so that if you look up to ask them something, he's already got someone on the way to your table.As far the food goes...The free bread and feta dip they give is so great. The bread is chewy but very soft. It has a little toughness on the surface but once you break through, you get soft and fluffy, warm bread. Add the feta dip they give you, and you'll have the bread finished in no time at all. For lunch, my wife ordered the lamb adana. The dish, while not particularly visually appealing, is quite delicious. The meat is flavored perfectly, and cooked to where the outside has developed a very thin crust and the inside is very moist. I ordered the doner kebab for myself and gees.. You talk about excellent lamb.. The plate comes full of sumptuous thin shavings of lamb. The outside of the pieces of lamb has slight browning which gives an incredible flavor and the inside is just as juicy as the adana.For dessert we ordered the baklava. We found the baklava to be one of the best we had ever had. The whole piece was moist but the texture ranged from crunch at the very top, chewy in the middle, and a soft, sponge-like texture at the bottom where the phylo had soaked up goodness. They give you the baklava with some whipped cream and chopped nuts. I don't know if they make the whipped cream in-house but if they don't, then damn they fooled the hell outta me. The whipped cream helped to cut through the sweetness of the baklava and what is normally a very intensely sweet dessert for me, wound up being absolutely perfect thanks to the pairing with the whipped cream.I'll definitely be back at Pera in the near future and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for Turkish food in the area."], ["Manoj R.", "Amazing amazing n just amazing. First of glad tat gyros here are lamb. Not the mix of lamb n beef which spoils the taste. Secondly, their pita bread is best in the world. Am sure i wont get such pita in future too.

The service was extremely friendly and generous - they gave us free baklava for dessert which was just insanely good, and I'm normally not a fan.Unfortunately, despite the super duper friendliness of the staff, they were very slow. VERY slow. Our lunch hour ended up being a few minutes shy of two hours long. Luckily, management was out of the building that day, otherwise we would have been screwed.They start the meal with some really yummy bread that I'm unfamiliar with. For their lunch deal, you choose an appetizer and an entree. I went with hummus and wasn't disappointed. It had pepper in it, which was a nice touch. For my entree I had the vegetable casserole and this is where things sort of fell apart for me. It was bland and uninteresting to me, just vegetables in tomato sauce with no real flavor.My coworkers have been here many times and love it, so maybe I just need to give it another shot and order something else.

If you haven't guessed by my food reviews, I am partial to anything from Mediterranean to Middle Eastern, to Persian to Indian. This area is the cradle of the world and where food traditions go back to before recorded history. It's where \"comfort food\" originates. Cafe Istanbul, located in the Inwood Village Shopping Center at Inwood Rd and Lovers Lane, serves great dishes from the eastern Mediterranean; a good deal of which is often overlooked or has morphed into neighboring countries cuisines. The Ottomans had a vast empire that lasted for centuries; a time during which tantalizing food choices and preparations evolved. Cafe Istanbul serves some of those tasty options at their restaurant.The meal starts with Turkish flat bread and aromatic olive oil for dipping. The bread's preparation dating back to the time of Sultan Selim and beyond. It is light, airy, and warm. And it paired well with the oil. During our first visit my wife and I each had a kebab dish: mine lamb and my wife's chicken. Each was served with a nice rice pilaf and vegetable relish; both paired nicely with the meat on the plate. We chose a Turkish pinot noir that was surprisingly good, considering Turkey is not known as a wine producing country; at least to the Western world. We didn't have any desert, but during another visit, I had the Armut Tatlisi or pear delight. It's a pear poached in wine and spices and served with fresh whipped cream and walnuts. Heavenly.Service is good to very good. On occasion it was a little spotty, but always friendly. I had the borek or meat pie, which was okay, but not great. This is a dish my fellow Bosnians took into their kitchens at the time the Ottomans came to visit. Since it's introduction to the central Balkan region it has become a constant on the table as well as becoming decidedly Bosnian in its current preparation. I am partial to the Bosnian version, which is more of a savory strudel. For me, there is no comparison. The only other criticism I have is the prices are a little high. All that said though, Cafe Istanbul as a whole is very good to excellent. I have not been to the restaurant when they have belly dancers, but I bet that would make the experience even that much more worthwhile."], ["Rhea V.", "Would be 5 stars but its $$$.

There is a constant production of wood-fire bread to be served fresh with your meal. It was fun watching him spread the dough, pat it just right, then lightly sprinkle it with the perfect amount of salt.The most entertaining, however, was the maitre'de. He cracked me up!

The chicken is dry and the fish is overly-salty (based on my & friends' experiences on several occasions).Their managers & chefs are quite ignorant when it comes to food allergies (gluten, lactose, etc.) ... which is fine but what was upsetting was they still claimed certain dishes were gluten-free when they obviously contained wheat (as we found out too late)."], ["Don J.", "**Update. After I posted my review, the owner sent me a nice note to apologize for the issues, which he promised to fix. While I didn't have a good experience, maybe Fadi's just had a bad night. \u00a0I give them credit for the prompt follow-up. Below is my original review.**After our first (and last) visit to Fadi's, I'm struggling to understand how this place gets such good ratings. \u00a0The restaurant is cafeteria-style. \u00a0Upon entering, you're immediately confronted by a complex, billboard-style menu. \u00a0Better read fast, because if someone walks in behind you there is no time to study your choices. \u00a0We had to pick up a tray and get moving, but unfortunately the dishes have no labels or prices. \u00a0The person behind the counter was not very helpful - I guess I took too long choosing my dishes because after my second item, he inexplicably heaped half my plate full of fried caulflower and sent me to the next station. \u00a0Mystified, when I reached the register I learned that I had ordered the \"Fadi's Special\". \u00a0The food was fair to mediocre. \u00a0The one thing you can usually count on at a Middle Eastern restaurant is plenty of good fresh pita bread. \u00a0On the night of our visit, the traditional white pita was all gone and all that was left was whole wheat. \u00a0Not a fan. \u00a0By the time we snaked through the line and payment process, the first dishes we picked up were already cold. \u00a0The gyros-style lamb meat was too heavily seasoned with something too strong. \u00a0I did find some solace in the fried cauliflower, but it wasn't enough to save the meal.I'm very unforgiving rating a restaurant if the bathroom is not clean. \u00a0The floor was so greasy that I almost slipped and fell. \u00a0For about the same amount of money you might as well go to a sit-down restaurant, where at least you get a menu with service and you can send the food back if it's not hot."], ["Hashem D.", "I have been to Fadi's several times, and I keep coming back and bringing my friends. Fadi's represents all what Lebanese and mediterranean restaurants should be:- laid back and relaxed environment- cheap (middle eastern food is simple and the ingredients are cheap, therefore it is not acceptable to inflate prices as most places do).- delicious food and in large quantities (i hate it when middle eastern restaurants skimp on the amount of food you get... Growing up in the Lebanon, the central dogma of presenting food is make it delicious and make it plentiful, and that rule was there whether you had guests at home or you were eating at a restaurant.)- open, spacious seating area- smiling, friendly, and helpful staffAnd now that i've outlined what I love about Fadi's, let me get back to the food and focus on that. You walk into the restaurant and you're faced with a long display of all the available food, and after choosing what meal option you want, you go through the line and ask for what you want at each station (dips, salads, rice, extras, and meats). The baba ghanouj is good, but the hummus is delicious: i've tried the regular and love it, but also the spinach hummus (an american thing, honestly, you wouldn't find this in the middle east) is fantastic! Gobble that hummus up with some toasted pita or some of the piping hot, fresh pita that you can pick up at any point during your meal... YUM! When it comes to salads, i usually shy away but i have a weakness for Tabboule, and theirs is pretty good, refreshing and juicy. I cheat and actually add some tabboule to my hummus... it's a good trick (you're welcome!). The rice is tasty and the meat dishes are good: i've had their chicken kebabs and those are great! Also, the chicken shawarma is absolutely delicious! Tender chunks of chicken with a perfect garlic sauce side! LOVE it! Finally, if you still have space for dessert (which only happened once and that time i took home half my main dish), the baklava is great! One of the best baklavas i've had in any restaurant in the US so far!I HIGHLY recommend Fadi's! ALSO, it's BYOB (they don't serve alcohol) so you won't get super upcharged for your drinks!

Sometimes when you're starving, you judge a meal more harshly than you would otherwise. You're so hungry that if the food doesn't completely satisfy you, it must not have been any good. The times I've been able to enjoy a meal at FFG, I've only ever been in culinary bliss and comfort.Can I just say falafel? Anyone who enjoys some great digs from the Middle East will tell you that the quality of falafel will make or break the restaurant. The falafel from Food From Galilee is, in a word, perfect. It's REALLY hard not to order this every time. Crisp, flavorful and shockingly light on the stomach, I even have a hard time utilizing their great tahini because the flavor is so rewarding. If you're craving falafel, order the falafel plate. At a ridiculous lunch price of $7.45, you get 8 crispy falafel, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, some pita bread and the choice of a soup or salad. I normally go with the Fettoush or Tabbouli salads, dishes that can easily stand on their own.These guys are the masters of deep frying; I've never had fried food that was so light. Normally, a ball dunked in oil is going to fill your stomach leaving you sluggish. Not the fried digs at FFG. Falafel with tahini paired with a dazzlingly fresh fettoush salad restores all of my energy. I am ready to face the rest of the day, instead of having the strong desire to face plant on the nearest couch and nap (I'm looking at you, Kuby's!! (...I still love you)).Continuing the awesomeness, the pita bread here is the best I've ever had. Nearly paper thin, they are light and flavorful, the perfect accompaniment to falafel, roasted lamb or their elegant hummus. I strongly recommend Food From Galilee to anyone looking to try out Mediterranean/Middle Eastern or attempting to find a nice place for lunch to keep you going through the day. The owners are generous, the food comes out fresh and fast, and the prices are great.EDIT.I continue to go to FFG often as I work in Snider Plaza. I have been traipsing through other lebanese/mediterranean dives and I have come to this conclusion: FFG has the best falafel in DFW!!! I am quickly becoming a connoisseur of these fine fried balls, and I have to say the ones at FFG are the best.

They were not the ordinary sized ones but probably each was a little smaller than a golf ball. Which is a lot since there were 10 of them. The pita was really good and fresh, and the lettuce and tomato that came on the side with the falafel was also quite fresh. The hummus tasted amazing. The only thing I really did not think was great was the falafel itself. I'm used to very big falafel balls which have a bit of crunch to it, but these were super soft on the inside and almost felt like vegetarian meatballs. It was good enough that I ate them all though, but just not want I am used to. My friend got the chicken schwarma platter which looked good as well. The tabbouli salad was great too and my fattoush salad was just delicious. I overall would come here again since it was so close and conveniently located in Snider Plaza right next to Creme de la Cookie!"], ["Carissa B.", "CABBAGE ROLLS!!!! Excellent, they could b bigger.

The babbaganoush is excellent (the best we've found in Dallas) as is the hummus (similar to what you'd expect to get at a typical restaurant in Israel). Of course, you will have better hummus when in Israel :-) but this is very authentic. Also really enjoy the falaffel, tabbouli and cabbage rolls. The chicken rice soup is also really nice. Also, it's BYOB which is a plus. Prices:Very reasonable.

What more could you want in a Mediterranean place? Well, one thing I'd wish for would be better parking, but this area is generally a bit difficult to navigate and can get quite crowded, but once you've safely parked your car, it's so worth the trouble.I spent a few weeks in the West Bank and Israel while I was still an undergrad and I've really developed a love for Mediterranean and Middle eastern food. I am NOT claiming to be an expert or that I have the most refined palate of all time, but I've eaten truly delicious meals in Palestine and the Galilee. It's a bit disappointing to dive into a plate of food expecting something similar to the real thing and to come up empty.Food from Galilee definitely doesn't fall into the disappointing category. The place is really tiny, but the staff/owners are so nice and the menu is a pretty average sampling of Mediterranean food that you can expect to find in most cheaper places around the area. The last time I was there with a friend, we shared dolmas and the hummus plate. I loved the hummus, it was smooth and creamy and not full of too much olive oil. The flat bread was delicious too, not to dry but still hot and tasty. The dolmas were pretty good too, some of the better ones I've had in the area, but I do prefer them with both meat and rice instead of the meatless ones you're going to get here.I ordered the falafel sandwich (I can't resist it!) and it was superb, full of crispy falafel that wasn't overly greasy with fresh tomatoes and pickles. \u00a0My friend had the chicken shawarma, which she reported was delicious as well. \u00a0The portions were really big for such a low price of both our meals, and the quality was great. \u00a0I really wanted to take more dolmas and hummus for the road, but it probably wouldn't keep very well in the heat.

The hummus goes great with it, though I wouldn't bet on it being the best hummus I've had in Dallas. The fattoush salad with the crispy pita bread pieces and its vinegary sauce was amazingly perfect! I really loved the combination and how the flavors from the tomato and the sauce go together. The baba ganoush was tangy and had a burnt taste to it (is it meant to be that way?

You can get meat instead of falafel, but we were feeling all healthy-like.Everything was A-OK. Nothing blew my mind, but did you see how cheap this place is? Uh-huh. The cucumber salad was fresh and flavorful, and definitely my favorite. There was more than enough to go around. I even had enough for leftovers.

It's simple, unassuming and cozy, with framed posters of famous middle eastern sites on the walls. Lunch is ordered at a small counter at the back of the dining room, and the man behind the counter was friendly.I was disappointed to learn that kabobs aren't served at lunch, which is what I almost always get at middle eastern restaurants, but my disappointment didn't last long. I ordered the Kafta Platter ($7.95 at lunch), an order of hummus and an order of baba ghanoush ($2.75 ea.). It came with the standard Arabic pita bread. I got it to go, but I couldn't wait to get back to the office to try it so I sampled the dips in my car.The hummus was very good; great consistency, smooth flavor. I had been excited to try the baba after I had heard good things about it, but I'm sorry to say it let me down. It was pretty bland, and the taste of burnt eggplant overpowered any other flavor that was there. It also had a strange, gel-like consistency. Maybe I just got it on a bad day, but I'd be hesitant to get it again.The Kafta Platter was a different story. Generally, I think of kafta and kibbe as being kind of lackluster dishes, and so I didn't have very high expectations for this meal. Boy, was I surprised! The meat had a wonderful texture, and the tahini sauce was so delicious that I wiped up and ate what was left with my bread. The side of rice was a not as oily as I'm used to, but very tasty nonetheless, and the cucumber salad that came with the meal was crisp and flavorful.Overall, I'd give Food From Galilee a solid 3.5.

I've had them warm, moist and delicious and then other times really dry.During my most recent visit, they've added a \"show\" portion, in the form of a belly dancer. I thought it was cute that was giving lessons to patrons.What's always spot on are the drinks. I think I've tried the whole menu and there isn't one that I dislike. They are fresh and definitely fit the Moroccan vibe."], ["John O.", "We ordered for delivery. I was skeptical of delivery lamb chops, but they were outstanding! The entire meal was excellent!"], ["Stephanie P.", "Don't be a babgha-douche, eat at Baboush! Haha, I just crack myself up. Seriously love this place though. The decor is awesome (good date spot) and they have about 6 tables outside on their sidewalk. The food is ah-mazing. I love their hummus, kebabs, falafel, and their beef cigars (think Mediterranean eggrolls). The food and their cocktails are a little on the pricey side so I don't go when I'm starving and just stick to wine instead of cocktails. Service is also ah-mazing. They're very nice and attentive. I went a couple of times during the summer but when I walked by the other day and the hostess called out to me because she remembered me from just two visits!There's street parking in front and a free garage on the south side of the building, so you have no excuses to not go!"], ["Jake R.", "I love this place and don't go enough. The service is amazing, and the food is perfect every time. Anything on the menu is a great choice."], ["Michelle N.", "Fantastic service; our server was so kind and sweet. Order hummus that came with pita bread, kebib that came with a lovely cucumber and greek yoghurt dip with a little side of a delicious salad, and grilled chicken breast kebabs with a side of basmati rice-it all tasted wonderful. Great calm ambiance to the place at night too with dim lights and comfy seating. Would definitely love to come back."], ["Jen H.", "This Moroccan Lebanese Egyptian restaurant was such a pleasure, \u00a0both aesthetically and to the palate. It is a gorgeous restaurant, very romantic. We got the sampler, which contained a sweet tolmatoe sauce, babagonoush, hummus, olives, harissa, and they were all amazing, like I'd never had before. The taste was very different. We also got the Lham, which came with vegetables that are very tasty and hummus. So delish. Also try the bamy, very good! The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the baklava and dates, very tiny portion size for $7 and ours at least didn't turn out good, the baklava tasted like the shredded wheat cereal and the dates didn't taste to my liking."], ["Tommy F.", "I spent a month traveling around morocco and felt both the food and atmosphere/decorations here were pretty authentic. The chicken with apricot curry had complex sweet and spicy flavor, and everything from the pillowed seating to the Moroccan iron lamps made it feel like a small restaurant in Fes.The manager was also very accommodating. My friend ordered a vegetarian tangine (off menu) that he found lacked flavor, and the manager happily made some of my apricot honey sauce for him on the side.In addition, we decided to get some classic Moroccan mint tea after having already paid for our meal, and they generously comped it for free rather than have us get a new bill.I'm definitely bringing friends back here again"], ["Joseph B.", "The best Mediterranean in Dallas. Hands down. They have the best hummus, babagnoush, falafal, and dolmas around. Incredible service and wonderful atmosphere. If you drink, I would highly recommend their Margarita. In my opinion it's one of the best crafted margaritas in Dallas."], ["Lynne K.", "We went with friends that are regulars.. We had hummus, tomato dip, wings which were yum and beef cigars that were amazing for appetizers. We all had the shawarma totally delicious. They have an awesome cocktail menu but that's where they loose a star I feel the cocktails are very expensive for a small pour... $12 for a green tea martini maybe 4oz is outrageous."], ["Aida B.", "The food is great. I really enjoyed having drinks and appetizers. In my opinion the portions are a bit small for the prize. The waiters were really friendly. Great costumer service."], ["Amber L.", "Baboush was a welcome find at the end of a long, hot day! It was one of those days in which you go, go, go...and realize you haven't eaten much throughout it all. Baboush was unique, flavorful, and had a great atmosphere overall. First, I love the decor! It definitely has the Moroccan flair. The bathrooms are even gorgeous! Service was friendly and prompt. My husband and I ended up splitting the Chicken Teffaya (braised chicken breast with cinnamon, honey golden raisins, chickpeas & caramelized onions with moroccan couscous) and Chicken Shawerma Hummus (marinated shawerma meat in Lebanese spices, lemon juice, garlic & olive oil atop hummus.Topped with pickles & pine nuts.) All was delicious!"], ["Seema P.", "Came here to meet up with my friends visiting from Hawaii and it was a great pick on my part. \u00a0The food and drinks were delicious! \u00a0We shared the starter platter with the tomato spread, hummus, spiced yogurt, green olive mixture, and a eggplant mix with pita bread. \u00a0SO GOOD! \u00a0After lunch, we went out to the patio for some hookah and the passion fruit mojito did not disappoint. \u00a0The manager was great in hosting us and checking in often. \u00a0We ended up staying for 4 hours. \u00a0It was a great day. \u00a0Thank you Baboush!"], ["Veronica J.", "The location is great! \u00a0I live in walking distance so that was a plus. The Violin Guy was there that night so that was awesome. \u00a0The restaurant is small but very nice. \u00a0The food is a bit expensive for what you get. I also have had better at other restaurants. \u00a0The service was ok. Our waiting could've been a little faster. The drinks were pretty good though.The hookah was expensive. \u00a0They had all the same flavors as every other place in Dallas. I believe it was $30 plus an automatic 20% gratuity on your bill. Total our bill came to $109. That was two small plates, 2 margaritas, 2 sangrias, and a hookah. \u00a0That was a bit much. \u00a0I will probably go back to the place in Addison that I've been going to instead of coming back here."]], "Qariah Lebanese Restaurant & Lounge": [["Jeremiah R.", "We were curious to see families on the patio, in lower greenville, on a Friday; we had to try it. Ambience: The patio is large, and we went on a night the weather was perfect. Young love was in the air; along with party truck exhaust, annoying fraternity patrons, and the faint waft of hookah. Food:The pita came out with a zatar sauce; a dipping oil with herbs. Pies: I ordered the mini pies - they are essentially flat bread with topping. The meat pie was actually good; generally ground meat is either too salty or too seasoned. The cheese pie was also excellent. The pies are served with pickled cucumbers and tomatoes. Entree:Falafel: This was well prepared and fresh. They didn't use dry ingredients, but rather the falafel had a crispy and light outer layer with a crushed garbanzo inner layer. 1st side was the fried cauliflower; which was very well seasoned with a strong citrus dressing. 2nd side was the tabouli; which didn't have too much barley but was heavy on the dressing. Lamb:The lamb kabob was well seasoned; but not very tender. I also tried a bite of my wife's spicy hummus and cucumber tomato salad. The salad was a simple salad with a heavy citrus dressing. The hummus was a standard hummus with a spicy after-taste."], ["Pat B.", "Did not have quite a few things we tried to order. This seems to be an ongoing problem according to V & E."], ["Priyanka P.", "Really good food, ambiance, and service ! Love the byob and the free pita and Zatar at the beginning of the meal"], ["Dan B.", "Great experience. We got the feast for 2 and hummus and it was delicious. We had 2 boxes of food left over and we BYOB'd."], ["Diana V.", "I came here a while back with a couple of friends and let me just tell you that my food was delicious! Service was great and the hookah was good as well. The only bad thing was that it took too long for us to be seated which I get because it was packed that day, and that it took forever for us to get our food."], ["Leigh P.", "Holy hummus, this was a fantastic lunch. Lunch is buffet only but it works well and there are LOTS of yummy options. I loved everything. Unfortunately, this is one of those situations where i couldn't really name what i ate (gah) but the chicken and mushroom dish in a creamy sauce was my favorite. The rice was fantastic. Hummus rivals my other faves. Pita was fresh. I've had better falafels... but besides that, everything was perfect.Night time seems like it would be a cool spot.. there's a hookah lounge and the restaurant itself looks like it would be pretty at night. I want to go back!"], ["Sarah Y.", "$9.99 hookah is a great deal here! The servers come around to refill the coals often, and the tobacco didn't run out for the almost 3 hours that we were there! We also didn't feel rushed to vacate the table at any point during our afternoon of hanging out on the patio with the hookah. We took the server's recommendation and choose the rose and mint mixed flavor, and it was a great cooling blend. All of the folks who work here that we came in contact with were very sweet and hardworking, and did their best to make sure we had waters, fresh coals, and checked on us frequently."], ["Hyunjoo S.", "Lunch was so good today! Came here during a slow time and the chef was cooking up fresh items. Everything was clean and tasted so good. I've been here 4-5 times now and this was the best. Typically a place can go downhill after the initial opening but this place is proud of their food. Kudos to them."], ["Jay G.", "I hosted my wife's birthday party here with 15 guests over. Everyone applauded my choice of the venue. The weather was gorgeous so the patio by Greenville Avenue manifested as the perfect background for enjoying a few rounds of BYOB drinks and smoking some Hookah with friends. The Kebabs and the Kaftas were well marinated, delicious and tasted close to authentic (I've spent \u00a0time in the middle east). The hallmark was the freshly baked pita served to the table straight from the oven. In my opinion, unless you knead the dough and roll the bread with your hands, you can't get that soft and thin texture of pita. I must give a shout out to the service we received, reminded me of warm Lebanese hospitality. The two reasons impeding me from giving these guys a 5 star are the cork fee for BYOB and not carrying tobacco-free Hookah."], ["Isela V.", "I had the lamb kabob sandwich and was pretty happy with the flavor. \u00a0The lamb had a smoky, chard flavor which I love. \u00a0The menu is simple an not overwhelming. \u00a0The smell of the place makes you want to try everything, deliciousness everywhere! \u00a0Service was great and the place is nicely kept and clean. \u00a0The prices are extremely reasonable. \u00a0If you are a smoker, they have hookahs for your enjoyment. \u00a0The patio seemed inviting and will return on a not so cold day to enjoy it."], ["Christian R.", "A"], ["Laura B.", "Qariah is one of favorite hangouts on Greenville. They have a great patio (lots of huge fans for summertime) and big, comfy chairs. The hookah is excellent (love the Lebanese Bomshell flavor) and it lasts a very long time. I've been half a dozen times and everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious.It's BYOB.... BUT.... there's a $10 bottle fee. Not bad if you're splitting it with a big party but it's too much if you're having a beer or two. They seem a bit understaffed during the rush on weekend evenings, so be prepared to wait for your check."], ["Cristy E.", "The Weekly Yelp was about gyros, and sadly, it did not include Qariah.This is a GREAT restaurant with very reasonable prices.

The mint tea is perfect and i loved my falafel wrap sandwich. My roommate had the lemonade & thought it was mighty fine (refills on all) & her chicken sharwma was a 9 out of 10. The service is still working out the kinks but they mean well. (Been open 2 weeks)"], ["Samir R.", "Went here for dinner this past Friday night and the place was busier than I expected based on previous drive bys. \u00a0The sight of a number of Arabic families choosing to dine there definitely lent the kitchen some credibility. \u00a0Our dining experience was so-so. \u00a0The waitstaff was friendly although not necessarily overly attentive. \u00a0Our grouped tried a wide sample of items - the sampler plate, most of the sides, falafels, and lamb chops. \u00a0For the most part the food was good with subtle flavors, but not anything special. \u00a0The lamb chops were particularly disappointing. \u00a0But personally, the two shining stars from what we had were the baba ghanoush and the tabbouleh. \u00a0I've never been much of a fan of either at other mediterranean spots, but loved both of these at Qarah's.Other tips of note:- It's BYOB -- so definitely remember to bring your own- They also offers hookahs which a number of folks were enjoying on the patio."], ["Bryan F.", "I've been impressed with Qariah on both visits. I haven't had an overwhelming amount of Middle-eastern cuisine in my day, but this is objectively good food. The sampler appetizer allows you to try a little bit of everything, which is all delicious. If you need to pick one, go with the grape leaves. They're the best I've ever had. For dinner, the shish tawook is out of this world, but the real show stopper is the lightly fried cauliflower side that you can order with it. I'll be back just for that!"], ["Rahiel M.", "The hookah here was horrible, the service was ok and the food wasn't too great. I prefer the lebanese food I make at home."], ["S H.", "Not very impressed. Our waitress comes to the table wearing a hoodie over her uniform....weird. Hummus was awful tastes very earthy. Yuk! Bread was good but gets dry quick. Open kitchen so you hear the staff and the cooks gossiping so annoying. We had the meat pie it's was disappointing no flavor. Almost felt like it wasn't cooked through. Has this place never heard of a curtain, drapes, anything?? Such a bland atmosphere. What a let down hopefully change hits this place .....

We all know lunch hour is the busiest time to go anywhere and everyone is in a rush. I came into here knowing I would probably have to wait longer than usual because the line was to the door. Fortunately the line moved very quickly and the cashiers were friendly \u00a0and efficient. I ordered Togo then stood off to the side while I waited for my order. There were a million tickets in the window and what looked like to be the manager was on the line pushing the orders out to the servers, very hands on and efficient. He seems super busy but at no time did he seem frazzled which is impressive ( I've worked in many restaurants and it's hard not to let it get to you ). Anyways the orders were coming out fast and seemed to be working very efficiently. Everyone seemed to know their role and be good at it. I was in and out in about 15 mins and that was during rush hour! My to go order was perfect too, silverware, napkins, not missing a thing! I will definitely be coming back here :) Ps. Even the server was friendly and had a smile on his face when speaking with customers . Though we all saw him running around back and forth all these orders all by himself ! He kept it together too, which is rare you see these days . You really get a feel for a place and how it is run when you see how it performs under pressure so 5 stars from me!!!"], ["Lily M.", "I came to Zoe's to order takeout. This was my first time at this location, but I've been to others in the metroplex. It wasn't busy when I went in, so the cashier allowed me to roam the menu and ask questions before placing my order, which was nice. I decided to get the Shrimp Kabob with fruit, grilled vegetables, and cucumber salad as my entree. The shrimp were great; they had a lot of flavor and were not over cooked. The vegetables were good, I only wish there were more. The cucumber stuff had so much Greek yogurt that it was overpowering. I really hope it was yogurt and not mayonnaise. $11 later and I was still hungry. Perhaps if I ate the mushrooms and onions that accompanied the meal, I would have been full, but since I didn't want any of that, I was left hungry. If I ever go back, I'll choose more wisely on what to get to feel the value was there."], ["Hollie B.", "So glad they built this zoes kitchen!! It's in a great location. You can never go wrong with zoes. Everything I've ever had is always delicious.. However j suggest the salmon kabobs. For $12 you get 2 skewers with zucchini, greek salad, hummus and pita, AND the awesome cucumber mix. Simply fresh and delicious!"], ["Rachel R.", "I came here for a quick lunch on the way to work. Upon entering the restaurant, I was warmly greeted by whom I assume to be the manager. I always order the steak kabobs with potatoes and grilled veggies. The marinade on the steak is to-die-for. I love the potatoes and the veggies. Make sure to save room for dessert, as the chocolate chunk cookies are delicious!"], ["Louie R.", "I am happy to see a location in the city of Dallas. If your looking for something delicious, filling, and still healthy, this is the place to go. The Chicken and orzo soup is clean and fresh in flavor. Chicken kabobs are light in flavor but always fresh and delightful. The steak kabobs are fantastic! I don't know what kind of glaze they use for the beef but it's phenomenal! Ordered a chicken Greek salad (thinking it was a small salad) which was so fresh and delicious. The Greek dressing is killer and the Chicken was seasoned perfectly. The salad portion is huge! Definitely try the hibiscus tea. It's absolutely refreshing. Can't wait to go back."], ["Jenna K.", "I love the food at Zoes, and have been going to many of the locations regularly for years, so when this one opened up in the same plaza as my office building, I was very happy.I go here between one and three times a week. The food is great as always, but this place is awfully managed. I know lunch hour is busy around offices, but this place gets so overwhelmed. They really need to hire more staff. I've been brought the wrong plate three times in one sitting before they got it right (but neglected to bring me back my receipt like I had asked twice about). Sad, but I am never surprised when my to go order is incorrect. The ice machine is always on the fritz and they often run out of silverware or beverage bar items. The staff runs around like crazy and it's hard to get their attention. They are visibly frazzled and need more help. Today, I had a particularly bad experience. I ordered a to go sandwich on white pita, and they put it in the computer as wheat pita. When I pointed the mistake out to an employee while waiting, he went to the kitchen and brought out my order - on wheat! He didn't even check the bread when he was specifically getting my order because I asked about the bread. I notified them of the mistake, and the guy gave me white small pita bread triangles on the side. Not the same as the sandwich being on the correct bread! I left with my incorrect order because the whole exchange seemed fruitless.My advice is to check your to go order before you even leave the to go counter, and bring a sweater if you are eating in. It's always freezing cold in there.Since I love the food and its about 100 yards from my office, I will continue to go here, even though the service is lacking."], ["John H.", "New location: second visit there. \u00a0Good food, very nice setting with patio (quick before Texas heat takes over); beer & wine with reasonable prices."], ["Shannon B.", "Love this place. Ask about the Goodies. Fresh and fast. Very good food. Love the salad and chicken kabob. Be sure to get the aps and get free goodies. Best chocolate cake in town."], ["Kaitlin M.", "So excited they opened this location. I would eat here every day if I could. Healthy, greek-ish food! Their dressing is so good I could drink it. Everything is really good here, but I have a special place in my heart for their kabobs, veggie pizza and quinoa salad. If you haven't ever tried a Zoe's, get there fast. You're missing out!"]]}
